<doc id="1108337" wikidata="Q314978" url="?curid=1108337" title="Ali al-Sajjad">
<text>Ali ibn al-Husayn al-Sajjad (, 712), also known as Zayn al-Abidin () was the great-grandson of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, and the fourth imam in Shia Islam, succeeding his father, Husayn ibn Ali, his uncle, Hasan ibn Ali, and his grandfather, Ali ibn Abi Talib.

Ali al-Sajjad was born around 658 CE. He survived the Battle of Karbala in 680, in which Husayn and his small caravan were massacred en route to Kufa by the forces of the Umayyad caliph Yazid I (). After the battle, al-Sajjad and other survivors were treated poorly and taken to the Umayyad capital Damascus. Al-Sajjad was eventually allowed to return to his hometown of Medina, where he led a secluded life, without participating in the numerous pro-Alid uprisings against the Umayyads during the civil war of the Second Fitna. Instead, he devoted his life to worship and learning, and was highly esteemed, even among proto- Sunnis, as a leading authority on Islamic tradition (hadith) and law (). He was also known for his piety and virtuous character. Being politically quiescent, al-Sajjad had few followers until late in his life, for many Shia Muslims were initially drawn to the anti-Umayyad movement of Mukhtar al-Thaqafi.

Ali al-Sajjad died around 712, either from natural causes or having been poisoned by the Umayyads. After his death, the mainstream Shia followed his eldest son, the equally quiescent Muhammad al-Baqir. Some others followed Muhammad&#x27;s much younger half-brother, Zayd ibn Ali, whose rebellion was crushed by the Umayyads in 740, marking the birth of Zaydism. Some supplications attributed to al-Sajjad are collected in (), which is highly regarded by the Shia. Ali al-Sajjad is seen by the Shia community as an example of patience and perseverance when numerical odds are against one.

==Life==

===Birth and early life===
Ali al-Sajjad was born in Medina, or perhaps in Kufa, in the year 38 AH (658659 CE). Shia Muslims annually celebrate the fifth of Sha&#x27;ban for this occasion.

Al-Sajjad was the great-grandson of Islamic prophet Muhammad, and the grandson of the first Shia imam, Ali ibn Abi Talib, by the latter&#x27;s marriage with Muhammad&#x27;s daughter, Fatima. After his grandfather was assassinated in 661, al-Sajjad was raised by his uncle Hasan and his father, Husayn, the second and third Shia imams, respectively. Husayn also had two other sons named Ali, both of whom were killed in the Battle of Karbala in 680. The first one was an infant, identified in Shia literature as Ali al-Asghar (). The second one was Ali al-Akbar (), although some historical accounts suggest that al-Sajjad was instead the eldest son of Husayn.

Al-Sajjad&#x27;s mother is named variously in sources as Barra, Gazala, Solafa, Salama, Shahzanan, and Shahrbanu. According to some Sunni accounts, she was a freed slave girl () from Sind. In contrast, Shia sources maintain that al-Sajjad’s mother a daughter of Yazdegerd III (), the last Sasanian Emperor, who was overthrown during the Muslim conquest of Persia. Shia tradition thus refers to al-Sajjad as Ibn al-Khiyaratayn (), a title that signifies his noble descent on both sides. However, the claim that al-Sajjad&#x27;s mother was a Sasanian princess is specific to Shia sources. Shia accounts add that Yazdegerd’s daughter was brought to Medina as a captive during the reign of the second caliph, Umar (). She was then allowed to choose her husband, Husayn, and died shortly after giving birth to her only son, Ali al-Sajjad.

===Karbala===

On 10 Muharram 61 AH (10 October 680), Husayn and his small caravan were intercepted and massacred in Karbala, present-day Iraq, by the forces of the Umayyad Caliph Yazid I (), to whom Husayn had refused to pledge his allegiance. Ali al-Sajjad was also present there, in the Battle of Karbala, but was too ill to fight. After killing Husayn and his male relatives and supporters, the Umayyad troops looted his camp and some were intent on killing al-Sajjad but his life was ultimately spared.

After the battle, al-Sajjad and the women were taken prisoner and marched to the nearby Kufa. They were badly treated along the way. Once in Kufa, they were paraded in shackles, and the women unveiled, around the city, along with the heads of the fallen. The captives were then presented to the Umayyad governor Ubayd Allah ibn Ziyad, who boasted of killing Husayn and his relatives, calling it divine punishment. When al-Sajjad responded that Ibn Ziyad was a murderer, the governor ordered his execution but relented when al-Sajjad was protected by his aunt Zaynab, who asked to be killed first. Ibn Ziyad imprisoned the captives for a time and then sent them to the Umayyad capital, Damascus.

As the captives were taken to Damascus, they were displayed from village to village along the way. A letter to Yazid, attributed to Muhammad&#x27;s cousin Abd Allah ibn al-Abbas, chastises the caliph for treating the captives poorly, suggesting that such treatment was worse than the massacre.

===In Damascus===
In Damascus, captives were paraded in the streets, and then imprisoned for a while, before being brought to the caliph. Yazid’s reaction to, and his culpability in, the events in Karbala have been debated in medieval and modern sources alike.

The first narrative is that he treated the captives kindly after an initial, harsh interrogation, saying that he regretted the conduct of his governor, and that he would have pardoned Husayn if he were alive. Such accounts are offered by the Islamicists L. Veccia Vaglieri, W. Madelung, and H. Halm. In contrast, M. Momen, another expert, believes that Yazid, fearing social unrest, released the captives as public opinion began to sway in their favor. Similar views are expressed by some other authors, including J. Esposito, R. Osman, K. Aghaie, D. Pinault, H. Munson, and the Shia scholar M. H. Tabataba&#x27;i. In particular, the Islamicist H. M. Jafri writes that Yazid is not known to have reprimanded his governor in the wake of the massacre, which does not suggest any remorse to Jafri. At any rate, such claims of remorse are in stark contrast to Yazid&#x27;s earlier orders to his governor to either exact homage from Husayn or kill him. 

The alternative narrative suggests that the captives were brought to the caliph in a ceremony, who gloated over avenging his pagan relatives killed fighting Muhammad. Such accounts are given by the Islamicists T. Qutbuddin and R. Osman. According to some reports, Yazid also dishonored the severed head of Husayn with blows from a cane, although this last episode is sometimes attributed to Ibn Ziyad instead, in line with the Sunni tendency to exonerate the caliph of killing Husayn and blaming Ibn Ziyad. Part of the great mosque in Damascus, known as Mashhad Ali, marks where al-Sajjad was incarcerated.

The captives were eventually freed and escorted back to Medina. Their caravan may have returned via Karbala, where they halted to mourn the dead. Sunni sources report of Yazid&#x27;s remorse for the massacre and that he compensated the captives for the properties plundered by his soldiers. In contrast, Shia authorities contend that it was the captives&#x27; activism that compelled the caliph to eventually distance himself from the massacre. Similar views have been expressed by some contemporary authors.

===Later life===
Ali al-Sajjad led a quiet and scholarly life after returning to Medina, confining himself to a small circle of followers and disciples. He kept aloof from politics and dedicated his time to prayer, which earned him his honorifics. 

For many years, al-Sajjad commemorated the Karbala massacre in private gatherings, fearing the Umayyads&#x27; wrath. Such gatherings were a form of protest against the Umayyad regime, and the precursor of Shia Muharram rituals. Personally, al-Sajjad was deeply affected by the Karbala massacre, to the point that for many years he frequently wept over it. He justified his prolonged grief with a reference to the Quranic verse 12:84, which describes the immense grief of Jacob during the absence of his son Joseph.

====Role in the Second Fitna====

After the Karbala massacre, Abd Allah, the son of Zubayr, who was a prominent companion of Muhammad, declared himself caliph in the Hejaz. He gradually gained popular support, to the extent that in 683 the Kufans forcibly replaced their Umayyad governor with a representative of Ibn Zubayr. Ali al-Sajjad remained neutral towards Ibn Zubayr, even leaving town during the unrest in Medina, and never pledging allegiance to Ibn Zubayr, but being left unmolested by him. Ali al-Sajjad was also not harmed by Yazid&#x27;s forces, who later pillaged Medina after their victory at the Battle of al-Harra in 683. On this occasion, al-Sajjad, unlike others, was exempted from a renewed oath of allegiance to Yazid, perhaps because he had earlier sheltered the Umayyad Marwan ibn al-Hakam and his family. Some non-Shia sources describe a friendly relationship between al-Sajjad and Marwan, who in 684 succeeded Yazid&#x27;s sickly son in the caliphate. Such sources even allege that al-Sajjad borrowed from Marwan to buy a concubine or that he was consulted by him about a message from the Byzantine emperor. In contrast, Shia sources contend that al-Sajjad interacted with authorities under the principle of religious dissimulation () to avoid persecution.

In the wake of the Karbala massacre, the Tawwabins () in Kufa were the first to seek revenge. They revolted to atone for having deserted Husayn, meaning to deliver the caliphate to his son, al-Sajjad; but they were crushed in 684 by a much larger Umayyad army. There is no evidence that al-Sajjad was involved in this uprising.

Shortly after Yazid&#x27;s death in 683, Mukhtar al-Thaqafi appeared in Kufa, where he campaigned to avenge Husayn, while claiming to represent Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyya, who was a son of Ali ibn Abi Talib, but not from the latter&#x27;s marriage to Fatima. By some accounts, Mukhtar initially sought the support of al-Sajjad, who refused. Mukhtar&#x27;s campaign in Kufa was nevertheless successful, and he seized control of the city in 686, whereupon he killed some of those thought to be responsible for the Karbala massacre, including Shimr, Ibn Sa&#x27;d, and Ibn Ziyad. Mukhtar may have even made a gift of Ibn Sa&#x27;d&#x27;s head to al-Sajjad. When Mukhtar was himself killed by Ibn Zubayr&#x27;s forces in 687, they did not harm al-Sajjad, which suggests that al-Sajjad had only weak ties to Mukhtar. Sources are contradictory as to what al-Sajjad thought of Mukhtar, although Shia sources are largely unsympathetic towards Mukhtar, in part because he championed Ibn al-Hanafiyya rather than al-Sajjad. Similarly, al-Sajjad was not harmed by the Umayyad commander al-Hajjaj, who defeated and killed Ibn Zubayr in 692.

==Death==
Ali al-Sajjad died in 94 or 95 AH (712714 CE) and was buried next to his uncle Hasan in the al-Baqi cemetery in Medina. Shia Muslims annually commemorate this occasion on the eleventh of Safar. A shrine stood over his grave until its demolition in 1806; and then, after reconstruction, it was demolished again in 1925 or 1926, both demolitions being carried out by the adherents of Wahhabism, a revivalist Saudi-backed movement that considers the veneration of Muslim saints a form of polytheism and a grave sin.().

Ali al-Sajjad either died from natural causes, or, as reported by Shia authorities, he was poisoned at the instigation of the reigning Umayyad caliph al-Walid () or perhaps his brother Hisham ().

==Imamate==

===Succession to Husayn===
Today, most Shias believe that Husayn was succeeded by al-Sajjad, whose imamate coincided with the caliphates of Yazid (), Mu&#x27;awiya II (), Marwan I (), Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (), and al-Walid I ().

As the only surviving son of Husayn, al-Sajjad was the natural candidate for the imamate. There are also some Shia traditions to the effect that Husayn had designated al-Sajjad as his heir and successor. At the time, however, many Shias felt that, like Husayn, their imam should rise against the tyranny of the Umayyads. Given the quiescent attitude of al-Sajjad, these Shias rallied behind Mukhtar, who revolted in support of Ibn al-Hanafiyya. The latter thus initially diverted much support away from al-Sajjad, who led a secluded, pious life after Karbala. Indeed, even though al-Sajjad was widely respected, he had few followers until the collapse of the Zubayrid counter-caliphate in 692. Such was his quiescent attitude that some Western historians are uncertain whether he put forward any claims to imamate. Yet some contemporary Shia figures, including Abu Khalid al-Kabuli and Qasim ibn Awf, are known to have switched their allegiance to al-Sajjad from Ibn al-Hanafiyya. 

For his part, Ibn al-Hanafiyya remained in his hometown of Medina and declined active leadership of Mukhtar&#x27;s uprising. Ibn al-Hanafiyya neither repudiated Mukhtar&#x27;s propaganda in his own favor nor made any public claims about succession to Husayn. On the other hand, perhaps Ibn al-Hanafiyya had secret designs for the caliphate, because he never pledged allegiance to Ibn Zubayr, who even imprisoned him until he was rescued by Mukhtar. Ibn al-Hanafiyya&#x27;s followers among the Shia became known as the Kasaniyya, who continued to trace the imamate through his descendants. Some Kaysanites apparently joined al-Sajjad when Ibn al-Hanafiyya died in 700 or 701. Some others thought that he was concealed by divine will and would eventually return to eradicate injustice on Earth. This was perhaps when the messianic concept of the Mahdi became mainstream in Shia Islam. Most Kaysanites, however, followed Ibn al-Hanafiyya&#x27;s son, Abu Hashim. When the latter died, his imamate supposedly passed on to the Abbasids, that is, descendants of Muhammad’s uncle, Abbas. Kaysanites later proved instrumental in the Abbasids’ overthrow of the Umayyads. As the Abbasids gradually turned against their former Shia allies, they carried most Kaysanites with themselves toward Sunnism.

Among other Shia sects, the Isma&#x27;ilis believe that Husayn had designated Ibn al-Hanafiyya as a temporary imam to protect the identity of the true imam, that is, al-Sajjad. Most Zaydis, by contrast, do not count al-Sajjad among their imams, for his political quietism disqualifies him from Zaydi imamate.

===Successor===
When al-Sajjad died, most of his followers accepted the imamate of his eldest son Muhammad, who is often known by the honorific al-Baqir (). Indeed, popular Shia sources report that, before his death, al-Sajjad designated al-Baqir as his successor.

Zayd, a much younger half-brother of Muhammad al-Baqir, also asserted a claim to leadership. Unlike the quiescent al-Baqir, Zayd was politically active. He revolted against the Umayyads in 740 but was soon killed. Perhaps to widen his support, Zayd accommodated some majority views that were not espoused by the early Shia. For instance, he did not condemn the first two caliphs, namely, Abu Bakr and Umar, who are denounced in Shia Islam as usurpers of Ali ibn Abi Talib&#x27;s right to the caliphate. Such views, however, cost Zayd part of his support among Shias.
Zayd&#x27;s rebellion marks the beginning of the Zaydi (Shia) movement. Especially for early Zaydis, any (religiously) learned descendant of Ali ibn Abi Talib and Fatima qualified for leadership as long as he rose against the unjust government.

===Miracles===
Shia sources attribute some miracles to al-Sajjad: He spoke to a gazelle in the desert, restored youth to an old woman, and the sacred Black Stone in Mecca attested to his imamate in the presence of Ibn al-Hanafiyya.

==Titles and epithets==
Ali&#x27;s teknonym () is reported variously as Abu al-Hasan, Abu al-Husayn, Abu Muhammad, Abu Bakr, and Abu Abd Allah. A reference to his devotion to worship, Ali&#x27;s honorific title is Zayn al-Abidin (), by which he was already known during his lifetime. His other titles are al-Sajjad () and al-Zaki (). He was also known as Dhu al-Thafenat, meaning ‘he who has calluses’ from frequent prostration in worship.

==Character==
Ali al-Sajjad was thin and resembled his grandfather, Ali ibn Abi Talib, both in appearance and demeanor. He spent much of his time in worship and learning, to the point that his face was bruised and his legs were swollen from lengthy prayers, according to his Shia biographer. He was also a leading authority on Islamic tradition (hadith) and law (fiqh), and was well known for his virtuous character and piety. For all these reasons, Muhammad&#x27;s great-grandson was highly esteemed, even among non-Shia Muslims. This was particularly the case within the learned circles of Medina, such that among his associates and admirers were some top Sunni scholars of the time, including al-Zuhri and Sa&#x27;id ibn al-Musayyib. These and some other hadith scholars have copied from al-Sajjad in Sunni sources. A poem praising al-Sajjad, attributed to the renowned poet al-Farazdaq, describes the ire of Hisham, prior to his caliphate, when crowds showed more respect to al-Sajjad than to Hisham during a hajj pilgrimage.

There are also numerous stories about the generosity of al-Sajjad in Shia sources. He bought and freed dozens of slaves in his lifetime, and secretly provided for destitute Medinans, who discovered, after his death, that al-Sajjad was the benefactor who regularly brought them food at night, while covering his face to preserve his anonymity. Among the stories about his forbearance and magnanimity, he is said to have sheltered Marwan&#x27;s family during the anti-Umayyad revolt in Medina. Ali al-Sajjad also prevented ill-treatment of Hisham ibn Isma&#x27;il when the latter was dismissed as the governor of Medina, even though Hisham had regularly insulted al-Sajjad. Ali al-Sajjad is seen by the Shia community as an example of patience and perseverance against numerically superior odds.

==Family==
Ali al-Sajjad had between eight and fifteen children, perhaps eleven boys and four girls. Four of his sons were born to Fatima bint Hasan and the rest were from concubines. Among his sons were Zayd and Abd Allah, and the eldest of them was Muhammad al-Baqir.

==Companions and narrators==
Even though he was widely respected, al-Sajjad had few supporters until the collapse of the Zubayrid counter-caliphate in 692. Shia authors have listed 168 to 237 companions and narrators for al-Sajjad, some of whom believed in his infallibility (). Some senior associates of al-Sajjad were among the companions of Muhammad and Ali ibn Abi Talib, such as Jabir ibn Abd Allah, Amir ibn Wathila al-Kinani, and Salama ibn Kahil. Among other notable companions of al-Sajjad were Abu Hamza al-Thumali, Aban ibn Taghlib, Abu Khalid al-Kabuli, Yahya ibn Umm Tawil, Sa&#x27;id ibn Jubayr, Sa&#x27;id ibn al-Musayyib, Muhammad and Hakim ibn Jubair ibn Mut&#x27;am, and Humran ibn Muhammad ibn Abd Allah al-Tayyar. Transmitters of hadith from al-Sajjad include Aban ibn Taghlib, Abu Hamza al-Thumali, Thabit ibn Hormuz Haddad, Amru ibn Thabit, and Salim ibn Abi Hafsa.

==Works==
 () is the oldest collection of Islamic prayers. Shia tradition regards this book with great respect, ranking it behind only the Quran and , which is attributed to Ali ibn Abi Talib. Fifty-four supplications form the core of the book, which also includes an addenda of fourteen supplications and another Fifteen Whispered Prayers. The book, attributed to al-Sajjad, is often regarded as authentic by Shia scholars of hadith, although its whispered prayers () may have been artistically edited by others.

Regarded as a seminal work in Islamic spirituality, is also a rich source of Islamic teachings. Its prayer &quot;Blessing Upon the Bearers of the Throne&quot;, for instance, summarizes the Islamic views about angels. The book was translated into Persian during the Safavid era; and its English translation, entitled &quot;The Psalms of Islam&quot;, is available with an introduction and annotations by the Islamicist W. Chittick. Numerous commentaries have been written about .

===Supplication of Abu Hamza al-Thumali===
This supplication () is attributed to al-Sajjad, and is transmitted by his companion Abu Hamza al-Thumali.


 () is attributed to al-Sajjad; it was written at the request of a disciple. Available in two recensions, this book is concerned with social and religious responsibilities. It exhaustively describes the rights God bestows upon humans and the rights humans should give themselves and each other, as perceived in Islam. The book describes the social duties each human must observe, and that those are predicated on more fundamental duties, such as faith in God and obedience to Him.

<doc id="1108347" wikidata="Q1411137" url="?curid=1108347" title="Goblin Valley State Park">
<text>Goblin Valley State Park is a state park of Utah, in the United States. The park features thousands of hoodoos, referred to locally as goblins, which are formations of mushroom-shaped rock pinnacles, some as tall as several yards (meters). The distinct shapes of these rocks result from an erosion-resistant layer of rock atop relatively softer sandstone. Goblin Valley State Park and Bryce Canyon National Park, also in Utah about to the southwest, contain some of the largest occurrences of hoodoos in the world.

The park lies within the San Rafael Desert on the southeastern edge of the San Rafael Swell, north of the Henry Mountains. Utah State Route 24 passes about east of the park. Hanksville lies to the south.

== History ==

Evidence of Native American cultures, including the Fremont, Paiute, and Ute, is common throughout the San Rafael Swell in the form of pictograph and petroglyph panels. Goblin Valley is noted for several rock art panels, as well as the rock formations. The secluded Goblin Valley was then found by cowboys searching for cattle. Then, in the late 1920s, Arthur Chaffin, later owner/operator of the Hite Ferry, and two companions, were searching for an alternate route between Green River and Caineville. They came to a vantage point about west of Goblin Valley and were awed by what they saw – five buttes and a valley of strange, goblin-shaped rock formations surrounded by a wall of eroded cliffs. In 1949, Chaffin returned to the area he called the Valley of the Mushrooms. He spent several days exploring the mysterious valley and photographing its scores of intricately eroded rocks.

Publicity attracted visitors to the valley despite its remoteness. In 1954, it was proposed that Goblin Valley be protected from vandalism. The state of Utah later acquired the property and established Goblin Valley State Reserve. It was officially designated a state park on August 24, 1964. In 2019, the state park was expanded by adding 6,261 acres of federal land.

===2013 vandalism===

In October 2013, a delicately balanced hoodoo was intentionally knocked over by a Boy Scout leader while two other men watched, one of whom recorded a video that was later uploaded to the Internet. The men claimed that the hoodoo appeared ready to fall, and that it was intentionally knocked over to prevent park visitors from being hurt. The hoodoo formation had existed for many millions of years, having formed out of rock that dated back as far as 165 million years. The average rate of erosion of a hoodoo is approximately 2–4 feet (0.6-1.3 m) every 100 years.

The two leaders, Glenn Taylor and David Hall, were subsequently dismissed from their leadership roles by the Utah National Parks Council, which is a local council of the Boy Scouts in Utah. The national Boy Scouts then removed the men from the scouting organization altogether. In January 2014, two of the menthe one who toppled the hoodoo and the cameramanwere arraigned on felony charges of &quot;criminal mischief&quot; and &quot;intentionally damaging, defacing and destroying property.&quot; The two men pleaded guilty to lesser charges of criminal mischief and attempted criminal mischief, and received a sentence of one year probation plus fines and case-related fees.

== Flora and fauna ==
The flora of Goblin Valley include Mormon tea, Russian thistle, Indian ricegrass, and various cacti, as well as junipers and pinyon pines at higher elevations.

Fauna include jackrabbits, scorpions, kangaroo rats, pronghorns, kit foxes, midget faded rattlesnakes, and coyotes.

== Geology ==

The unusual stone shapes in Goblin Valley result from the weathering of Entrada sandstone. The Entrada consists of debris eroded from former highlands and redeposited on a former tidal flat of alternating layers of sandstone, siltstone, and shale. The rocks show evidence of being near the margins of an ancient sea with the ebb and flow of tides, tidal channels that directed currents back to the sea and coastal sand dunes.

Joint or fracture patterns within the Entrada sandstone beds created initial zones of weakness. The unweathered joints intersected to form sharp edges and corners with greater surface-area-to-volume ratios than the faces. As a result, the edges and corners weathered more quickly, producing the spherical-shaped &#x27;goblins&#x27;.

The Entrada sandstone from which the hoodoos developed was deposited in the Jurassic period around 170 million years ago.

== Climate ==
Average daytime highs in the summer average between , though the low humidity, high elevation, and sparse vegetation allow evenings to cool off rapidly to about . Also, the intermittent summer monsoon arriving from the south can bring intense and localized thunderstorms. The rugged terrain and intense rainfall can lead to devastating flash floods, while the low humidity combined with gusty winds and frequent lightning can spark wildfires. Winters have colder temperatures and occasional snow, with temperatures above freezing most days, but often dropping as low as at night. The average precipitation is less than .

==Film==
Goblin Valley was prominently featured in the movie &quot;Galaxy Quest&quot; (1999) as an alien planet. The eroded sandstone dunes in the valley inspired the design of the fictional planet’s rock monsters.

<text>The 2006 Africa Cup of Nations was the 25th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, the association football championship of Africa. It was hosted by Egypt, from 20 January to 10 February. Just like in 2004, the field of sixteen teams was split into four groups of four. Egypt won its fifth championship, beating Ivory Coast in the final 4–2 in a penalty shootout after the regulation time had ended in a goalless draw.

== Host selection ==
Bids :
*Algeria
*Egypt 
*Ivory Coast
*Libya

The organization of the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations was awarded to Egypt on 24 October 2002 by the CAF Executive Committee meeting in Cairo, Egypt. Voters had a choice among four countries : Algeria, Egypt, Ivory Coast and Libya.

This marks the fourth time that Egypt has hosted the African Cup after 1959, 1974 and 1986.

It also coincides with the celebration of the 50th anniversary of the foundation of CAF.

== Qualification ==
For the 2006 Africa Cup of Nations, qualification was done through the CAF&#x27;s qualification process for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. Whereas only the winner of each group qualified for the World Cup, the top 3 finishers in each of the five qualification groups gained entry into the Africa Cup of Nations. The exception was qualification group 3, which contained hosts Egypt. Since Egypt qualified for the Africa Cup of Nations automatically as the hosts, the final berth was instead awarded to the fourth-place finishers, Libya.

2006 also marked the first time that the defending champion did not automatically qualify for the finals. Tunisia, 2004&#x27;s champion, qualified for the Cup of Nations by winning their group in the qualification process.

<text>The 2004 African Cup of Nations, known as the [[Nokia]] 2004 Africa Cup of Nations for sponsorship purposes, was the 24th edition of the African Cup of Nations, the biennial international men&#x27;s football championship of Africa organised by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). The tournament was played between 24 January and 14 February 2004 in Tunisia, taking place in the country for the third time following the 1965 and 1994 editions. The organization of the 2004 edition was awarded to Tunisia on 4 September 2000.

The defending champions were Cameroon from the 2002 edition. A total of 32 matches were played, in which 88 goals were scored, at an average of 2.75 goals per match. Attendance at all stages of the tournament reached 617,500, averaging 19,297 viewers per match. Qualification took place from 7 September 2002 to 6 July 2003. Cameroon as title holder and Tunisia as host country automatically qualified for the final phase of the tournament. As in the 2002 edition, sixteen teams, divided into four groups each comprising four teams, took part in the competition. The defending champions Cameroon were eliminated in the quarter-finals after losing 1–2 against Nigeria&#x27;s Super eagles. Tunisia won the title for the first time in their history, after beating one-time champions Morocco in the final match with a score of 2–1, so the Eagles of Carthage are the 13th selection in history to be crowned African champions. Nigeria secured third place after beating Mali in the third place match, which placed them fourth.

Four players scored the most goals at the end of the tournament: Tunisian Francileudo Santos, Cameroonian Patrick Mboma, Malian Frédéric Kanouté and Nigerian Jay-Jay Okocha, however the top scorer title was given to Tunisia&#x27;s Santos as he was the player of the champion team and did not receive any cards throughout the tournament, while Nigeria&#x27;s Okocha won the best player award. As champions, Tunisia qualified for the 2005 FIFA Confederations Cup in Germany, as a representative of African continent.

== Host selection ==
The organization of the 2004 edition was awarded to Tunisia on 4 September 2000 by the CAF Executive Committee meeting in Cairo, Egypt. Voters had a choice between four countries : Malawi and Zambia (joint bid), Tunisia and Zimbabwe. Benin and Togo were both also candidates at the start (joint bid) but withdrew on 4 September 2000 before the meeting. This edition was awarded to Tunisia which represented Africa in the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France by taking the majority of the votes of the CAF Executive Committee members which are 13 after its impressive success in the 1994 edition. This is the third time that Tunisia has hosted the African Cup after 1965 and 1994 editions. Two years before the start of the tournament, an organizing committee (Comité d&#x27;organisation de la Coupe d&#x27;Afrique des Nations; COCAN) was established, headed by Slim Chiboub (who was the head of the organizing committee in 1994).

== Venues ==
The main host cities are concentrated on the country&#x27;s coastal strip: Bizerte, Monastir, Sousse, Sfax and the capital Tunis. The 7 November Stadium is the largest stadium in the country with a capacity of 60,000 spectators, located in city of Radès, in the southern suburb of the city Tunis, it was built to host the 2001 Mediterranean Games and 2003 Tunis Four Nations Tournament and opened on 6 July 2001 during the final of the 2000–01 Tunisian Cup. The stadium obtains the Class 1 Certificate from the World Athletics, which means that it reaches the best standards and specifications in its field.

El Menzah Stadium in Tunis and Sousse Olympic Stadium in Sousse hosted matches of the 1994 African Cup of Nations. Taieb Mhiri Stadium in Sfax was one of the stadiums of the 1965 African Cup of Nations. Mustapha Ben Jannet Stadium in Monastir and 15 October Stadium in Bizerte have also been added to host the event. All stadiums were renovated before the start of the tournament.

=== Stadiums ===

== Qualification ==
Qualification took place from 7 September 2002 to 6 July 2003. The 49 nations registered for the competition are divided into thirteen groups: ten groups of four teams and three groups of three teams. The selections of Guinea-Bissau, São Tomé and Príncipe and Djibouti forfeit before the start of qualifying.

The first of each group qualify for the final tournament in Tunisia, as well as the best of the second. Cameroon, as defending champion, and Tunisia, as host country, are automatically qualified for the final phase of the competition. Benin, Rwanda and Zimbabwe managed to qualify for the African Cup of Nations for the first final phase of their history, after finishing at the top of their group in the qualifiers in front of two former African champions, Sudan and Ghana.

=== Qualified teams ===
The following sixteen teams qualified for the tournament.

== Final draw ==
The draw took place on 20 September 2003 in Tunis. The sixteen teams were divided into four pots according to their performances in past Cup of Nations tournaments. The January 2004 FIFA World Rankings (shown in parentheses).

== Squads ==

<text>Água Doce do Norte is a municipality located in the Brazilian state of Espírito Santo. Its population was 10,909 (2020) and its area is 474 km2. The municipal capital is situated at a height of 200m above sea level. Those born in Água Doce do Norte are called Agua-docences.

== Overview ==

The municipality is currently made up of five districts: Água Doce do Norte, Governador Lacerda de Aguiar, Santa Luzia do Azul, Santo Agostinho and Vila Nelita. The territorial area of Água Doce do Norte was donated by a local farmer named Domingos Marculino to the local population in 1949. In line with popular demand, Domingos Marculino lent his name to the original town. But its current name prevailed after a tradition of those inhabitants of making such a weak coffee as to its taste resembling fresh water more than coffee (&quot;fresh water&quot; being the translation of &quot;Água Doce&quot;). The original village of Água Doce do Norte, which was then part of the municipality of Barra de São Francisco, was founded on 11 October 1949, then soon receiving the status of &quot;district&quot; in 1951. The locality then was mostly geared towards the production of coffee and the rapid growth it experienced then was because then was the golden age of coffee in Brazil. On 6 May 1988 by the law nº 4066, the municipality was separated from that of Barra de São Francisco. It was then officially installed on 1 January 1989. The official change of name from &quot;Água Doce&quot; to &quot;Água Doce do Norte&quot; was made in 1988.

<text>Much Dewchurch is a village and civil parish in Herefordshire, England. The village lies about south of Hereford. The parish includes the hamlet of Kivernoll and part of the village of Wormelow.

The Old Vicarage has stood since the 17th century, and includes a plaque of the number of vicars that served the parish in 1665. Other buildings of note are the pub which still has civil war musket damage on the wooden walls inside.

The Grade I listed Norman square-towered church, dedicated to St David, dates to the 12th century. A Victorian extension to the north transept was built in the high neo-gothic revival period. Inside is a memorial bas-relief to the Biddulph family, lords of the manor.

The Steiner Academy Hereford is at the centre of the village, close to and south of the church.

Large estates in the area include Bryngwyn Manor () and The Mynde (), both lying south of the village. Bryngwyn Manor is a Victorian Gothic manor house constructed in 1868 by F. R. Kempson for Sir James Rankin, later MP for Leominster. The Mynde, a Grade I-listed building, was an ancestral home of the Pye family. Walter Pye was Attorney General in the reign of Charles I. The house was acquired by the Duke of Chandos, who sold the estate to the Symons family in 1729.

<text>The mayor of New York City is elected in early November every four years, in the year immediately following a United States presidential election year, and takes office at the beginning of the following year. The city, which elects the mayor as its chief executive, consists of the five boroughs (Manhattan, The Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island), which consolidated to form &quot;Greater&quot; New York on January 1, 1898.

The consolidated city&#x27;s first mayor, Robert A. Van Wyck, was elected with other municipal officers in November 1897. Mayoral elections previously had been held since 1834 by the City of Brooklyn and the smaller, unconsolidated City of New York (Manhattan, later expanded into the Bronx).

Eric Adams took office 12:01 AM on January 1, 2022, at a private swearing-in, followed by a public ceremony later in the day. He is the second Black mayor in the history of the city. He follows Bill de Blasio, who served two consecutive terms after being elected in 2013 and for a second term in 2017.

==Overview==

===Terms and term limits (since 1834)===

Direct elections to the mayoralty of the unconsolidated City of New York began in 1834 for a term of one year, extended to two years after 1849. The 1897 Charter of the consolidated City stipulated that the mayor was to be elected for a single four-year term. In 1901, the term halved to two years, with no restrictions on reelection. In 1905, the term was extended to four years once again. (Mayors Fiorello La Guardia, Robert F. Wagner Jr. and Ed Koch were later able to serve for twelve years each.) In 1993, the voters approved a two-term (eight-year) limit, and reconfirmed this limit when the issue was submitted to referendum in 1996. In 2008, the New York City Council voted to change the two-term limit to three terms (without submitting the issue to the voters). Legal challenges to the council&#x27;s action were rejected by Federal courts in January and April, 2009. However, in 2010, yet another referendum, reverting the limit to two terms, passed overwhelmingly.

&quot;Principal source:&quot; &quot;The Encyclopedia of New York City&quot; (see Sources below), entries for &quot;charter&quot; and &quot;mayoralty&quot;.
# See List of mayors of New York City.
# Mayor Strong, elected in 1894, served an extra year because no municipal election was held in 1896, in anticipation of the consolidated City&#x27;s switch to odd-year elections.
# George B. McClellan Jr. was elected to one two-year term (1904–1905) and one four-year term (1906–1909)
# David Dinkins was not affected by the term limit enacted in 1993 because he had served only one term by 1993 and failed to win re-election.
# The September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in Manhattan coincided with the primary elections for a successor to Mayor Giuliani, who was completing his second and final term of office. Many were so impressed by both the urgency of the situation and Giuliani&#x27;s response that they wanted to keep him in office beyond December 31, 2001, either by removing the term limit or by extending his service for a few months. However, neither happened, the primary elections (with the same candidates) were re-run on September 25, the general election was held as scheduled on November 6, and Michael Bloomberg took office on the regularly appointed date of January 1, 2002.
# On October 2, 2008, Michael Bloomberg announced that he would ask the city council to extend the limit for mayor, council and other officers from two terms to three, and that, should such an extended limit prevail, he himself would seek re-election as mayor. On October 23, the New York City Council voted 29–22 to extend the two-term limit to three terms. (A proposed amendment to submit the vote to a public referendum had failed earlier the same day by a vote of 22–28 with one abstention.)
#In November 2010, yet another popular referendum, limiting mayoral terms to two, passed overwhelmingly.

====Interrupted terms====

Mayors John T. Hoffman (1866–68, elected Governor 1868), William Havemeyer (1845–46, 1848–49, and 1873–74), William Jay Gaynor (1910–13), Jimmy Walker (1926–32), and William O&#x27;Dwyer (1946–50) failed to complete the final terms to which they were elected. The uncompleted mayoral terms of Hoffman, Walker, and O&#x27;Dwyer were added to the other offices elected in (respectively) 1868, 1932, and 1950 [those three elections are listed as &quot;special&quot; in the table below because they occurred before the next regularly scheduled &quot;mayoral&quot; election; the &quot;regular&quot; mayoral elections of 1874 and 1913, on the other hand, were held on the same day that they would have happened had the mayoralty not become vacant.]

† Became acting mayor as the president of the board of aldermen or (in 1950) city council.

(D) = (Democratic)

(R) = (Republican)

# Mayor Havemeyer was a Democrat who ran as a Republican against the Democratic Tweed Ring in 1872.
# Acting Mayors Coman, Vance and Kline did not seek election as mayor.
# Acting Mayors McKee and Impellitteri were Democrats who lost the Democratic primary to succeed themselves, but still ran in the general election as independents.
# Elected Mayor Oakey Hall won re-election, while Mayor Wickham did not seek it. Mayors Mitchel and O&#x27;Brien lost attempts at re-election, while Mayor Impellitteri did not run for a full term in the 1953 regular general election after losing the Democratic primary.

===Summary tables===

====Principal candidates&#x27; city-wide vote since 1897====

This chart has several purposes. One is to provide ordinary readers with simple, basic information from a very detailed page. Another is to provide a handy index for those looking for a particular candidate or campaign. (Just click on the year, the candidate&#x27;s name, or the party name or abbreviation for more details.)

A slightly more sophisticated purpose is to sketch out on one screen the flow of votes across parties and candidates, as affected by fusion, splitting, cross-endorsement and the emergence of new movements or personalities.

Votes in thousands for principal candidates only, generally those winning more than 4.0% (1/25) of the total vote. (Therefore, low votes may not be shown in a particular year for an otherwise significant party, such as Socialist or Conservative. For some of the lesser left-wing candidates before 1945, see below.) Total vote includes that for all candidates and parties, major and minor.

Abbreviations used in this table: Fu. or Fus = Fusion, Ind. = Independent, Ind Fu. = Independent Fusion (1989), Independence or Indep&#x27;ce = Independence Party of New York, L or Lib. = Liberal Party of New York, Cons. = Conservative Party of New York, ALP = American Labor Party, Soc. = Socialist Party of America, Jeff&#x27;n D = The Democracy of Thomas Jefferson (Henry George, 1897), Civic All&#x27;ce = Civic Alliance (Hearst 1909), Exp = Experience party (Impellitteri&#x27;s label for his independent campaign in 1950), Jobs &amp; Educ. = Independent Jobs &amp; Education party (Bloomberg&#x27;s personal label sharing a ballot line with Independence Party in 2009)

===By borough===
See the table above for more information about the candidates and parties involved. Blue indicates a candidate endorsed by the Democratic Party; pink one endorsed by the Republicans; and buff (or beige) one endorsed by neither party. (Darker shades indicate where a borough voted for a candidate who lost the citywide vote.) In 1981, Ed Koch ran on the tickets of both the Democrats and the Republicans.

Although separate boroughs since 1898, the Bronx and Manhattan shared New York County and reported elections together until the separate Bronx County was formed in April 1912 and started her separate existence on January 1, 1914. The borough of Richmond changed its name to Staten Island in 1975, although the co-extensive Richmond County still retains that name.

Although it was not uncommon for a candidate to carry all five boroughs in the same election, variations in voting patterns are noticeable. Since it started reporting separate returns in 1913, the Bronx has supported a Republican only three times (Fiorello La Guardia in 1933, 1937, and 1941). Manhattan has opposed only two successful candidates (Giuliani in 1993 and Bloomberg in 2001). On the other hand, in the 15 elections since 1961 that were contested between Democratic and Republican candidates (i.e. excluding 1981, when Ed Koch was endorsed by both parties), Staten Island has voted for only two Democratic candidates, Abe Beame in 1973 and Koch in 1985. Prior to this, it had only voted Republican three times (in 1903, 1933, and 1937). Queens has voted for only three Republicans until 1961 (in 1903, 1933, and 1937), but since 1961 it voted for the winner all but twice (in 1977 and 1989). Brooklyn has backed a Republican twice since 1945 (in 1997 and 2005). 1985 was the last election in which any candidate swept all five boroughs.

==Some basic patterns of mayoral elections in New York City==

===Democrats, Republicans, and reformers===
One pattern, stretching back well before consolidation and lasting into the 1960s, is the conflict between, on one side, Tammany Hall, the Democratic political organization largely built on political patronage with a consequent deep skepticism about Civil Service, the merit system of assigning government jobs, and competitive bidding for city contracts, and on the other hand, its various opponents, including Republicans, businessmen opposed to taxation or extorted bribes, middle-class reformers and labor union activists.

Until the election of Fiorello H. La Guardia in 1933, it was almost never possible to unite the disparate anti-Tammany elements in a coalition strong enough to prevail for more than one election. (This was not only for negative reasons: Tammany could listen to and satisfy some of its opponents&#x27; needs, and could on occasion run candidates of undoubted quality, such as Abram Hewitt to oppose Henry George&#x27;s United Labor Party in 1886. ) In the reported words of the Tammany leader George Washington Plunkitt, reformers were only &quot;mornin&#x27; glories —- looked lovely in the mornin&#x27; and withered up in a short time, while the regular machines went on flourishin&#x27; forever, like fine old oaks.&quot;.

Quite apart from Tammany Hall itself, both Republicans and left-wing reform parties have always had to deal with the overwhelmingly Democratic sympathies of New York City&#x27;s voters. Neither the various Socialist and labor parties nor the Republicans were ever strong enough to elect a Mayor alone without the support, or at least the benign non-hostility, of other parties and independents.

===Fusion, second ballot lines, and third parties===
The local term for uniting several constituencies or movements against Tammany was Fusion, which usually required the Republicans to abstain from competing with a non-Republican reform candidate (as in the elections of Seth Low in 1901 and John P. Mitchel in 1913). Later the unusual ability of New York candidates to combine (fuse) votes from several different parties allowed Republicans and Democrats to run their own reform candidates on third party lines, such as &quot;Fusion&quot;, American Labor, Liberal, Conservative and Independence. In fact, no Republican has ever been elected Mayor of consolidated New York without the support of at least one other significant party, from LaGuardia to the ex-Democrat Michael Bloomberg.

Even when a candidate could not gain another party&#x27;s support, they often found it expedient to create a separate line or party name for independent voters to support him, such as &quot;Recovery&quot; (Joseph V. McKee in 1933), &quot;Anticommunist&quot; (Jeremiah T. Mahoney in 1937), &quot;Experience&quot; (Vincent Impellitteri in 1950) or &quot;Brotherhood&quot; (Robert F. Wagner Jr. in 1961). In 1965, Rep. John Lindsay (R-Liberal) won votes on the &quot;Independent Citizens&quot; line, while his opponent Comptroller Abe Beame (D) won additional votes for &quot;Civil Service Fusion&quot;.

Although granting or withholding endorsement was an effective tool for a minor party to influence a candidate&#x27;s policies and actions, it could sometimes lead to counter-pressure from those who felt that candidates were being swayed too far in the wrong direction. This was one of the main reasons for founding the Conservative Party of New York in 1962 by those upset at the liberalism of Republican Governor Nelson A. Rockefeller and (later) Lindsay, against whose 1965 Mayoral campaign the Conservatives ran William F. Buckley, Jr.

More recently, there has been a trend of reformers working not through third parties (such as the now-dormant Liberals) but through Reform Democratic clubs, leading to lively internal contests such as the 1989 Democratic primary where David Dinkins unseated incumbent Mayor Ed Koch who started his own political career in a Reform Democratic Club. On the other side, however, dissatisfied conservatives have created their own new parties outside the Republican Party, such as the New York State Right to Life Party and the Independence Party of New York.

==Recent elections==

===2021===

Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams of the Democratic Party defeated Guardian Angels founder Curtis Sliwa, who ran on the Republican and Independent lines by a margin of 441,416 votes or 66.99% against 27.76%. Notable third-party candidates included teacher Cathy Rojas of the Party for Socialism and Liberation (2.49%/27,982 votes) and retired police officer Bill Pepitone of the Conservative Party (1.12%/12,575 votes). However, this was ultimately a fairly partisan election by New York City standards with 94% of voters voting on the Democratic and Republican lines. This was likely due to the absence of the Working Families Party from the ballot, who elected not to endorse a candidate and the standalone candidacy of the Conservative Party, who typically garner votes by endorsing the Republican candidate.

===2017===

Bill de Blasio, the incumbent mayor, won re-election to a second term, on Democratic and Working Families Party lines, over challengers Nicole Malliotakis on the Republican and Conservative party lines, Sal Albanese on the Reform Party line, Akeem Browder on the Green Party line, independent candidates Mike Tolkin and Bo Dietl, and Libertarian Party candidate Aaron Commey.

===2013===

The principal candidates were Joe Lhota on the Republican and Conservative lines, Bill de Blasio on the Democratic and Working Families lines, and some independents. Bill de Blasio won the election in a landslide

====2013 results by borough====






Democratic primary election, Tuesday, September 10, 2013

Bill de Blasio, the city&#x27;s elected Public Advocate, won 40.8% of the total Democratic primary vote and, by exceeding 40.0%, avoided an October 1 primary runoff with Bill Thompson, who won the second-highest number of primary votes, or 26.1%. (In 2009, Thompson had won the Democratic primary only to lose a close general election to Mayor Michael Bloomberg.) Christine Quinn, the Speaker of the New York City Council, came in third, with 15.7%, while none of the other candidates, including City Comptroller John Liu and former Congressman Anthony Weiner, won as much as 10%. De Blasio carried all five boroughs and Thompson came in second in every borough except Manhattan, where he finished third behind Quinn.

Republican primary election, Tuesday, September 10, 2013,

In the Republican primary, Joe Lhota, a former deputy mayor and former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority carried every borough but Staten Island, which was won by John Catsimatidis, a businessman, publisher and property developer. Catsimatidis, in losing, won nearly as large a percentage of his own party&#x27;s vote (40.69%) as the Democratic winner, Bill de Blasio won of his (40.81%). The 61,111 valid votes cast in the Republican primary were less than one-eleventh of the 691,801 cast in the Democratic one held on the same day in the same polling places.

From the Board of Elections in the City of New York, September 27, 2013 

===2009===
The principal candidates were Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent running for the third time on the Republican and Independence Party lines, and New York City Comptroller Bill Thompson, running for the Democratic and Working Families Parties. Bloomberg had enjoyed pluralities of about 9% to 16% in most independent published pre-election polls and on Tuesday, November 3, he won his third term with 50.7% of votes over Thompson&#x27;s 46%.

Other candidates included:

*Steven Christopher of Memorial Baptist Church in Brooklyn, Conservative Party of New York State
*Joseph Dobrian, Libertarian Party of New York
*Reverend Billy Talen of the Church of Life After Shopping, Green Party of New York
*Dan Fein, Socialist Workers Party
*Francisca Villar, Party for Socialism and Liberation
*Jimmy McMillan, Rent Is Too Damn High Party
*Tyrell Eiland, New Voice Party
*Jonny Porkpie, independent
*John M. Finan, independent

General election, Tuesday, November 3, 2009

Democratic primary, Tuesday, September 15, 2009,

From the Board of Elections in the City of New York, September 26, 2009 

Tony Avella represents a Queens district on the New York City Council. Out of the nearly 400 write-in votes, almost half or 184 (representing about one Democratic voter in 2,000) were some form or spelling of Mayor Michael Bloomberg.

===2005===
In 2005, Mayor Bloomberg won every borough but The Bronx (of which his Democratic opponent was the former Borough President) against a Democratic Party split by a divisive primary, in contrast to his first victory in 2001, when Bloomberg carried only Queens and Staten Island.

===2001===
The 2001 mayoral election was held on Tuesday, November 6.

Republican incumbent Rudy Giuliani could not run again due to term limits. As Democrats outnumber Republicans by 5 to 1 in the city, it was widely believed that a Democrat would succeed him in City Hall. However, billionaire Michael Bloomberg, a lifelong Democrat, changed his party affiliation a few months before the election in order to avoid a crowded primary, and ran as a Republican. The Democratic primary was meant to be held on September 11 but was postponed due to the September 11 attacks; it was instead held on September 25. The primary opened the way to a bitter run-off between the Bronx-born Puerto Rican Fernando Ferrer, and Mark Green, a non-Hispanic who attacked Ferrer&#x27;s close ties to Rev. Al Sharpton, leaving the party divided along racial lines.

Bloomberg spent $74 million on his election campaign, which was a record amount at the time for a non-presidential election (Bloomberg would break his own record in 2005). Thanks also in part to active support from Giuliani, whose approval ratings shot up after the September 11 attacks, Bloomberg won a very close general election.

In his 2005 book &quot;Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning&quot;, historian Jonathan Mahler argues that the New York City blackout of 1977, with its accompanying rioting, enabled the law-and-order advocate Ed Koch to beat out his more left-wing opponents, including incumbent mayor Abe Beame, in the 1977 election.



Other vote was: Kenneth F. Newcombe – Communist – 5,300; Catarino Garza – Socialist Workers – 3,294; Vito Battista – United Taxpayers Party – 2,119; Louis Wein – Independent – 1,127; William Lawry – Free Libertarian – 1,068; Elijah Boyd – Labor – 873. Cuomo&#x27;s total vote included 522,942 Liberal and 64,971 Neighborhood Government.




Runoff-Koch-433,002 55.0%; Cuomo-354,833 45.0% Total vote 787,835
Manhattan-Koch-115,251 65.2%; Cuomo—61,570 34.8%
Bronx-----Koch-69,612 55.7%; Cuomo—55,355 44.3%
Brooklyn—Koch-131,271 53.8%; Cuomo—112,587 46.2%
Queens----Koch-107,033 50.4%; Cuomo—105,522 49.6%
Staten----Koch-9,835 33.1%; Cuomo—19,799 66.9%

Note that the eventual winner, Rep. Ed Koch, could not win a plurality in any of the Five Boroughs for the initial Democratic primary. Rep. Bella Abzug took Manhattan, Mayor Abe Beame Brooklyn, Rep. Herman Badillo the Bronx, and NY Sec. of State Mario Cuomo Queens &amp; Staten Island. In the Democratic run-off with Cuomo, Koch took Queens and three other boroughs, leaving Cuomo with only Staten Island. In the general election, Cuomo kept Staten Island and won back Queens, but lost the other three boroughs (Manhattan, Brooklyn and The Bronx) to Koch.

&quot;In the Republican primary,&quot; Roy M. Goodman, a member of the New York State Senate, defeated Barry Farber, a radio commentator, by a vote of 41,131 to 31,078(57.0% to 43.0%). Farber, however, won the nomination of the Conservative Party of New York and won almost as many votes in the general election (57,437 or 4.0%) as Goodman did as the Republican nominee (58,606 or 4.1%).

Other numbers are from &quot;The World Almanac and Book of Facts&quot;, then published by &quot;The New York World-Telegram&quot; (Scripps-Howard), for 1943 (page 412) and 1957 (page 299), and from &quot;The Encyclopedia of New York City&quot; (see Sources below).

Before 1975, the present Borough of Staten Island was formally known as The Borough of Richmond.

===1973===
note: All the candidates except Marchi had run in the Democratic primary. Candidates votes on their second ballot lines included above were: Beame-Civil Service &amp; Fusion −67,277; Marchi-Integrity – 14,271; Blumenthal – Good Government – 29, 335; Biaggi – Safe City – 8,010. Other vote includes 8,818 Fran Youngstein – Free Libertarian Party; 3,601 Rasheed Storey – Communist; 2,282 Norman Oliver – Socialist Workers; 2,000 Anton Chaiken -Labor; 1,762 John Emanuel – Socialist Labor

===1969===
Note: In one of the most unusual primary seasons since the conglomeration of greater New York, the incumbent Mayor (Lindsay) and a former incumbent (Robert F. Wagner Jr.) both lost their parties&#x27; primaries. Procaccino won with less than 33% of the vote against four opponents, which inspired the use of runoffs in future primaries. In the general election, Lindsay carried Manhattan (the only borough he had carried in losing the Republican primary to Marchi, 107,000 to 113,000) as he did in 1965, but he was only 4,000 votes ahead of giving first place in Queens to Procaccino. Turnout dropped to 2.4 million from 2.6 million in 1965. (In the same election, Lindsay&#x27;s 1965 opponent Abe Beame was easily returned to his old job of comptroller.)

The New York Mets&#x27; unlikely win in the 1969 World Series and Mayor Lindsay&#x27;s participation in their postgame celebration may have given the Mayor a late public relations boost which contributed to his victory.
* The Lindsay vote was 872,660 Liberal (36.5%) and 139,973 Independent (5.9%). 
* Procaccino&#x27;s vote was 774,708 Democratic (32.4%) and 57,064 Civil Service Fusion (2.4%).
* The Marchi vote was 329,506 Republican (13.8%) and 212,905 Conservative (8.9%).
* By themselves, the straight Democratic and Republican lines added up to less than 50% of the mayoral vote (1,104,214 or 46.2%), but more than the total vote for Lindsay (1,012,633 or 42.4%).
* Procaccino&#x27;s general election votes on the Democratic line alone (774,708) were slightly fewer than the total votes received by all candidates in the Democratic primary (777,796).
* Lindsay&#x27;s general election votes on the Liberal line alone (872,660) exceeded Procaccino&#x27;s total votes on all lines (831,772).











===1965===
Almost a quarter of Lindsay&#x27;s vote (281,796) was on the Liberal Party line, while 63,590 of Beame&#x27;s votes were on the Civil Service Fusion line. John Lindsay, a Republican Congressman from the &quot;Silk-Stocking&quot; District on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, carried Manhattan, Queens, and traditionally Republican Staten Island (Richmond), while Abe Beame, the city comptroller, carried The Bronx and his home borough of Brooklyn, both of which he had also won in the Democratic primary. However, while Beame had also carried Queens in the primary, he lost it to Lindsay in the general election. (Five years later, Bill Buckley&#x27;s brother James L. Buckley would win the 1970 New York state election for U.S. Senator on the Conservative Party line against divided opposition.) The Other vote was 11,104- Vito Battista – United Taxpayer Party; 3,977- Clifton DeBerry – Socialist Workers; 2,087 – Eric Haas – Socialist Labor





===1961===
Mayor Wagner broke with the regular Democratic organization which had supported him in 1953 and 1957, defeating their candidate, Arthur Levitt, in the Democratic primary 61% to 39%. At the same time, after running successfully with Lawrence Gerosa for Comptroller in the previous two elections, Wagner chose to run instead with Abraham Beame in 1961. Gerosa ran against Wagner for mayor as the &quot;real Democrat&quot; on a pro-taxpayer platform. 211,000 of Wagner&#x27;s 1,237,000 votes came on the Liberal Party line, and 55,000 on the purpose-built Brotherhood line.
Other vote was: Vito Battista – United Taxpayers Party – 19,960; Richard Garza – Socialist Workers – 7,037; Eric Haas – Socialist Labor – 3,272

===1957===

Other vote was:
; Joyce Cowley – Socialist Workers – 13,453 0.6%; Eric Haas – Socialist Labor- 4,611 0.2%

===1953===

Total vote was 2,207,516
Other vote was David L. Weiss-Socialist Workers-2,054 (0.1%);Nathan Karp-Industrial Government-916; Scattered-180.
&quot;Industrial Government&quot; is a ballot title sometimes used, to avoid confusion or to meet election laws, by the Socialist Labor Party. The Liberal Party of New York won over five times as many votes as the American Labor Party in Manhattan, and eight-to-ten times as many in the other boroughs. The ALP lost its ballot status after the 1954 Governor&#x27;s race, and voted to dissolve itself in 1956.

===1950===

Vincent Impellitteri, the mayor who succeeded mid-term after William O&#x27;Dwyer resigned on August 31, 1950, swept Manhattan, Queens and Staten Island in this special election, while Ferdinand Pecora (aided by the Liberal Party) took very narrow leads in The Bronx and Brooklyn. In this election, the Liberals heavily outpolled the American Labor Party in every borough but Manhattan and Staten Island, where the two parties&#x27; votes were almost equal.

===1949===

Other vote was: Eric Haas – Industrial Government – 7,857; Joseph G. Glass – Socialist – 3,396; Michael Bartell – Socialist Workers – 1,224. The Morris vote was 570,713 Republican, 373,287 Liberal and 12,069 Fusion

===1945===

O&#x27;Dwyer received 867,426 Democratic votes and 257,929 on the American Labor Party line. The Goldstein vote was 301,144 Republican, 122,316 Liberal and 8,141 City Fusion.
The No Deal Party (according to Chris McNickle in &quot;The Encyclopedia of New York City&quot;) was founded by the retiring maverick Republican Mayor Fiorello La Guardia to draw Republican votes towards Newbold Morris and away from the official Republican Party with whom La Guardia was having a dispute. The No Deal Party dissolved soon after the 1945 election. Newbold Morris was a Republican, while Jonah Goldstein was a Democrat until nomination day.
Other vote was: Joseph G. Glass – Socialist – 9,304; Farrell Dobbs – Trotskyist Anti-War – 3,656; Eric Hass – Socialist Labor – 3,465; Max Shachtman – Workers – 585; Scattered – 45.

===1941===
As in 1937, more voters in every borough voted on the Democratic line than on any other single line; but this time (unlike 1937) the Democrat carried Queens and Staten Island over La Guardia, shrinking the Mayor&#x27;s overall citywide percentage lead from 20% to 6%. As in 1937, La Guardia&#x27;s overall margin of victory depended on the American Labor Party, which again won more votes than the Republicans in The Bronx. While the total vote and Republican vote were almost identical in 1937 and 1941, the ALP line lost 47,000 votes (2.4%), almost entirely from Manhattan (−18,000) and Brooklyn (−26,000), as the vote on La Guardia&#x27;s other lines (Fusion, Progressive and United City) dropped from 187,000 (8.3%) to 86,000 (3.7%). The Democratic Party gained about 160,000 votes lost by La Guardia (and about 7½% of the total). In both Queens and Richmond (Staten Island), the swing was even greater: La Guardia lost over 15% of the total vote (and the Democrats gained over 15%) from 1937, as his lead there flipped from roughly 56%–44% to 39%–60%.
===1937===

Note that the leading line in every borough, and in the city as a whole, is the Democratic line for Judge Mahoney. Running on the Republican line alone (as he did when losing the election of 1929), Mayor La Guardia would have lost every borough, but he carried all five when the American Labor Party line was added. The ALP line did better than the Republican line in The Bronx, although worse than the Democratic one.
There were also 2,307 votes for Emil Teichert on the Industrial Government line.

===1933===
While opposed by Tammany Hall, McKee enjoyed the support of Democratic President (and former Governor) Franklin D. Roosevelt, who declared neutrality when his ally Mayor La Guardia was running for reelection in . (See Ed Flynn&#x27;s comments about FDR&#x27;s 1936 contribution to starting the American Labor Party in the below.) According to Michael Tomasky, La Guardia, who had lost the Republican Mayoral primary to Manhattan Borough President Henry Curran, did not enjoy the support of a united Republican Party when he won the party&#x27;s nomination and lost the general election in , but was able to win over Republican organizational support in 1933.
The 1933 LaGuardia vote was 446,833 Republican and 421,689 City Fusion. The O&#x27;Brien vote was 570,937 Democratic and 15,735 Jeffersonian.
There were also 1,778 votes for Henry Klein-Five Cent Fare &amp; Taxpayers; 472 for Aaron Orange – Socialist Labor; and 118 for Adolph Silver – Independent Union.

====Collapse of the Socialist Party vote====
In 1933, a year that might otherwise have favored the Socialist Party&#x27;s chances, the New Deal began, Morris Hillquit died, Norman Thomas refused to run again for mayor, and the Socialist vote (previously as high as one-eighth to one-fifth of the total) collapsed irretrievably from a quarter of a million to sixty thousand (one-thirtieth of the total). Many supporters of Thomas&#x27;s 1929 campaign defected (some, like Paul Blanshard, also leaving the Party) to support Fiorello La Guardia. By the time of the next mayoral election in 1937, which the Socialist Party decided by internal referendum not to contest, many reformers and trade-unionists who wanted to support major-party progressives like La Guardia (R-ALP-Fusion), Gov. Herbert Lehman (D-ALP) and Pres. Franklin D. Roosevelt (D-ALP) from outside the two-party structure backed the American Labor Party (ALP), the Social Democratic Federation and later the Liberal Party of New York. After a disastrous gubernatorial campaign in 1938 (where Thomas and George Hartmann won only 25,000 votes out of over 4.7 million), the Socialist Party lost its separate line on the New York ballot, allowed its members to join the ALP, and indeed encouraged them to do so. In 1939, the Socialist Harry W. Laidler, a co-founder of the Intercollegiate Socialist Society and League for Industrial Democracy, was elected (with the help of proportional representation) to the New York City Council on the ALP&#x27;s ticket, but lost its renomination two years later because of rivalry with the Communists. 
*&quot;[Although not apparent from the table below, the Communist Party&#x27;s vote for other municipal offices, such as City Council and President of the Board of Aldermen, was increasing at the same time that the Socialist Party&#x27;s was declining below the Communists&#x27;. But in 1936, when the foundation of the ALP coincided with world Communism&#x27;s shift from independent action towards the Popular Front, New York City Communists redirected much of their own energy towards supporting the ALP.]&quot; 
&quot;[Click on the year for fuller details. ALP = American Labor Party (see commentary above). Socialist Labor Party candidates and votes not retrievable for every year from the sources used for this article. Readers are encouraged to supply any missing details.]&quot;

† In 1894 and in 1897, Lucien Sanial was the mayoral candidate of the Socialist Labor Party before both the SLP and the Social Democratic Party each split in two. In 1901, one faction of the SLP, led by Morris Hillquit, and one faction of the SDP, led by Eugene V. Debs, united to form the Socialist Party of America, which soon drew away many votes formerly cast for the SLP. For further details, see Hillquit&#x27;s &quot;History of Socialism in the United States&quot; (1910) and Howard Quint&#x27;s &quot;Forging of American Socialism&quot; (1964), both cited in the at the end of this article.

===1932===
Totals after a court-ordered recount:

Joseph V. McKee, as the (popularly elected) President of the Board of Aldermen, became Acting Mayor upon the resignation of elected Mayor Jimmy Walker on September 1, 1932. McKee&#x27;s write-in total is, in fact, the highest any New York City election would ever see. For the election after the next one, voting machines which would make write-in voting much more difficult were introduced. Machines of this basic design are still being used.

Lewis Humphrey Pounds was President of the Borough of Brooklyn from June 1913 to December 1917.

This was the last of many campaigns for different offices by Morris Hillquit, a co-founder of the Socialist Party of America, who died in 1933. Hillquit had won over 21% of the vote for mayor in 1917.

*Borough returns before the recount (which did not significantly affect the outcome):

There were also 24,014 votes 1.2% for William Patterson – Communist and 11,379 0.5% for Olive Johnson – Socialist Labor

===1929===
There were also 5,805 votes for William Weinstone – Communist and 320 votes for Lawrence Tracy – Commonwealth Land.
The great stock market crash hit Wall Street on October 24–29, 1929, less than two weeks before Election Day. Richard Edward Enright was New York City Police Commissioner from 1918 to 1925.

==1897 to 1925==

¶ Basic numbers for the elections of 1897 to 1925 come from &quot;The World Almanac and Book of Facts&quot; for 1929 and 1943. Percentages and borough totals calculated independently. (Because of some anomalies, not all columns and rows add precisely.) First names and informational links gathered from Wikipedia and several external sources, including the free public archive of &quot;The New York Times&quot;.

===1925===

Mayor Hylan, an ally of the newspaper publisher William Randolph Hearst, was unseated in a venomous Democratic primary by &quot;Gentleman&quot; Jimmy Walker, the Democratic party leader in the New York State Senate, who had been recruited to oppose Hylan by Hearst&#x27;s inveterate enemy, Democratic Governor Al Smith. After the death of Tammany Hall leader Charles F. Murphy in 1924, the regular Democratic organizations also split their allegiances, with Hylan receiving support from John McCooey, the leader in Brooklyn, and Walker from Ed Flynn of the Bronx. (Hearst had run for mayor on third-party tickets in 1905 and 1909, while Al Smith had lost a bid for the Democratic nomination for mayor in 1917, instead winning the presidency of the New York City Council as Hylan&#x27;s running-mate.) 


===1921===

Henry Curran was the borough president of Manhattan and heavily defeated Fiorello H. La Guardia, president of the board of aldermen, in the Republican primary election for mayor. There was also 454 votes for Joseph Miller on the Single Tax Line and 443 votes for Benjamin Gitlow on the Workers League Line

===1917===

&quot;Notes:&quot; The Single Tax on land values was the proposal and platform of Henry George, who ran for mayor in 1897 and 1886. D. Leigh Colvin later contested the U.S. presidential election of 1936 for the Prohibition Party.

The Fall 1917 election would have been exciting even had it occurred in peacetime. In September, the City held its first-ever primary elections for mayor. The sitting independent Mayor, John P. Mitchel, who had enjoyed Republican support under Fusion in 1913, narrowly lost the Republican primary to William Bennett, after mistakes and frauds led to a series of recounts. When negotiations between the parties failed, Mitchel ran alone as a Fusion candidate against Bennett, the Socialist Morris Hillquit and John F. Hylan, the regular Democrat supported by Tammany Hall and William Randolph Hearst.

However, the elections happened after the United States had declared war on April 6. Hillquit and the Socialist Party quickly and vigorously opposed the war, which Mitchel vigorously supported. Hillquit&#x27;s anti-war position helped the Socialists win their highest-ever vote for mayor, but also led to vitriolic denunciations by many, including &quot;The New York Times&quot; and former President Theodore Roosevelt. Mitchel and Hillquit each won less than quarter of the vote, while Hylan, who had been non-committal about the war, won the election with less than half the vote. However, as in 1897, the numbers suggest that Tammany Hall might have won even against a unified opposition.

===1897 to 1913===
¶ The Bronx and Manhattan, although separate Boroughs since 1898, shared New York County and reported their votes together until Bronx County was formed in April 1912 and came into its separate existence on January 1, 1914.

[ &quot;The World Almanac&quot; does not list separate returns for the two boroughs until 1917, but &quot;The Encyclopedia of New York City&quot; (see Sources) gives these major candidates&#x27; results for 1913: 
* &quot;Manhattan&quot;: McCall 103,429 – Mitchel 131,280, and &quot;The Bronx&quot;: McCall 25,684 – Mitchel 46,944. ]
Mayor William Jay Gaynor, who had survived being shot in the throat by a disappointed office-seeker in 1910, died at sea from the indirect effects of his injury on September 10, 1913. He was succeeded for the rest of 1913 by Ardolph Loges Kline, the acting president of the board of aldermen. 

The election of 1897 was held just before the Five Boroughs formally consolidated into Greater New York in 1898, so it was the present city&#x27;s first mayoral election. For preliminary results for all the municipal offices, broken down into smaller districts, see &quot;Democrats Take All – The Tammany Ticket Makes Almost a Clean Sweep of the Greater City – Only Two Republicans in the Council...&quot; in &quot;[[The New York Times|&quot;, November 4, 1897 (seen April 11, 2008).

† [[Henry George]], author of &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; and proponent of the Single Tax on land, died (probably from the strain of campaign speeches) on October 29, four days before Election Day; his son was nominated to take his place representing &quot;The Democracy of Thomas Jefferson&quot;. 
&quot;[In 1886, George had been the United Labor Party&#x27;s candidate for Mayor of the smaller City of New York, now the Borough of [[Manhattan]], winning 68,110 votes to 90,552 for the Democrat [[Abram Hewitt]] and 60,435 for the Republican [[Theodore Roosevelt]], although George&#x27;s supporters maintained that he had lost the election through fraud.]&quot; 

For Lucien Sanial, see the table notes under above (1933) and ALL THEY NEED IS VOTES; THREE CANDIDATES FOR MAYOR WHO WOULD MAKE A STIR. in &quot;The New York Times&quot; for Wednesday, November 4, 1894, page 19.

It appears from the percentages to be an open question whether the Republican Party&#x27;s decision in 1897 not to support [[Seth Low]]&#x27;s [[Electoral fusion (New York)|Fusion]] campaign caused his defeat by splitting the vote against [[Tammany Hall]]. Republicans withdrew in Low&#x27;s favor in 1901 (when he won) and in 1903 (when he lost).

<doc id="1108414" wikidata="Q3256763" url="?curid=1108414" title="Burmese literature">
<text>The literature of Myanmar () spans over a millennium. The Burmese language, unlike other Southeast Asian languages (e.g. Thai, Khmer), adopted words primarily from Pāli rather than from Sanskrit. In addition, Burmese literature tends to reflect local folklore and culture.

Burmese literature has historically been a very important aspect of Burmese life steeped in the Pali Canon of Buddhism. Traditionally, Burmese children were educated by monks in monasteries in towns and villages. During British colonial rule, instruction was formalised and unified, and often bilingual, in both English and Burmese known as Anglo-Vernacular. Burmese literature played a key role in disseminating nationalism among the Burmese during the colonial era, with writers such as Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, an outspoken critic of British colonialism in Burma.

Beginning soon after self-rule, government censorship in Burma has been heavy, stifling literary expression.

==Classical literature==
The earliest forms of Burmese literature were on stone engravings called &quot;kyauksa&quot; () for memorials or for special occasions such as the building of a temple or a monastery. Later, palm leaves called &quot;peisa&quot; () were used as paper, which resulted in the rounded forms of the Burmese alphabet. During the Bagan dynasty, King Anawrahta adopted Theravada Buddhism as the state religion, and brought many Pali texts from Ceylon. These texts were translated, but Pali remained the literary medium of the Burmese kingdom. Furthermore, Pali influenced Burmese language in structure, because of literal translations of Pali text called &quot;nissaya&quot; ().

The earliest works of Burmese literature date from the Bagan dynasty. They include proses recording monarchical merit acts and poetic works, the earliest of which was &quot;Yakhaing minthami eigyin&quot; (&quot;Cradle Song of the Princess of Arakan&quot;), dated to 1455. During the Bagan and Inwa dynasties, two primary types of literature flourished, &quot;mawgun&quot; () and &quot;eigyin,&quot; () and &quot;pyo&quot; (), religious works generally derived from the Jataka tales.

Non-fiction and religious works prevailed during this period although &quot;kagyin&quot; (), a war poem by a monarch, was an early form of this genre in history.

As literature grew more liberal and secular, poetry became the most popular form of literature in Burma. The flexibility of the Burmese language, because of its monosyllabic and tonal nature, and its lack of many consonantal finals allowed poetry to utilise various rhyming schemes. By the 15th century, four primary genres of poetry had emerged, namely &quot;pyo&quot; (poems based on the Jataka Tales, &quot;&quot; ( metaphysical and religious poems), &quot;mawgun&quot; (historical verses written as a hybrid of epic and ode), and &quot;eigyin&quot; (lullabies of the royal family). Courtiers also perfected the &quot;myittaza&quot; (), a long prose letter.

Buddhist monks were also influential in developing Burmese literature. Shin Aggathammadi rendered in verse the Jataka stories. During this time, Shin Maha Thilawuntha (1453–1520) wrote a chronicle on the history of Buddhism. A contemporary of his, Shin Ottama Gyaw, was famous for his epic verses called &quot;tawla&quot; () that revelled in the natural beauty of the seasons, forests and travel. Yawei Shin Htwe, a maid of honour, wrote another form of poetry called &quot;aingyin&quot; on the 55 styles of hairdressing.

After the conquest of Siam by the Toungoo dynasty, Thailand became a Burmese colony. This conquest incorporated many Thai elements into Burmese literature. Most evident were the &quot;yadu&quot; or &quot;yatu&quot; (), an emotional and philosophic verse and the &quot;yagan&quot; (), which imitated the themes of the &quot;yadu&quot; genre, which was more emotionally involved, could be inspired by mood, place, incident, and often addressed to sweethearts and wives. Famous writers of &quot;yadu&quot; include Nawade I (1545–1600) and Prince Natshinnaung (1578–1619). Some parts of Laos and Cambodia also became Burmese colonies during Second Burmese Empire and thereby influenced Burmese literature.

In the areas of law, there were two major types of literature, &quot;dhammathat&quot; (), which appeared prior to the 13th century, and &quot;shauk-htone&quot; (), which were compilations of brief accounts of historic cases and events in simple narrative to serve as guides and legal precedents for rulers.

As the Konbaung dynasty emerged in the 18th century, the Third Burmese Empire was founded. This era has been dubbed the &quot;Golden Age of Literature&quot;, with poets such as Letwe Thondara, Hlaing Thate Khaung Tin, Selay U Ponenya. After a second conquest of Ayutthaya (Thailand), many spoils of war were brought to the Burmese court. The &quot;Ramayana&quot; () was introduced and was adapted in Burmese. In addition, the &quot;Ramayana&quot; inspired romantic poems, which became popular literary sojourns among the royal class. Burmese literature during this period was therefore modelled after the &quot;Ramayana&quot;, and dramatic plays were patronised by the Burmese court. The other famous literature are called: &quot;taydat&quot; (), &quot;laygyo&quot; (), &quot;dwaygyo&quot; () and &quot;bawle&quot; ().

===First printing press (1816)===
The arrival of the first printing press in Burma in 1816, sent by the British Serampore Mission, helped to liberalise centuries-old traditions of writing in verse (&quot;lay-lone tha-paik&quot; (), a poetry type, where four syllable lines are linked in a climbing rhyme and grouped into stanzas of 30 lines.).

Monks remained powerful in Burmese literature, compiling histories of Burma. Kyigan Shingyi (1757–1807) wrote the Jataka Tales incorporating Burmese elements, including the &quot;myittaza&quot; (Pali &quot;metta&quot; or love + Burmese &quot;sa&quot; or letter), which are love letters and are important sources of first-hand accounts of the economic and social changes Burma was undergoing before colonialism. During the First Anglo-Burmese War (1823–1826), more solemn and muted moods exuded from Burmese literature, including lyrical music. In addition, &quot;yazawin&quot;, historical chronicles, became important in the Konbaung dynasty, although they had been written since the Inwa dynasty. In 1724, U Kala wrote the &quot;Maha Yazawin&quot; (The Great Chronicles), covering Burmese history until 1711.

In 1829, King Bagyidaw appointed scholars to compile the &quot;Hmannan Yazawin&quot; (Glass Palace Chronicle), covering Burmese history until 1821. A successor king, King Mindon Min appointed a committee of Burmese scholars from 1867 to 1869 to create the &quot;Dutiya Yazawin&quot; (The Second Great Royal Chronicles). The final major royal chronicle the &quot;Konbaung Set Yazawin&quot; was published in 1905 by Maung Maung Tin, a British colonial official and related to Konbaung royalty.

==British Burma (1824–1948)==
When Burma became a colony of British India, Burmese literature continued to flourish, even though the institution of the Burmese monarchy, the leading patron of Burmese arts and literature in pre-colonial times, had been dismantled. English literature was still relatively inaccessible although both English and Burmese, in a curriculum called Anglo-Vernacular, was now taught in schools. Despite the fact that Burmese literature was well entrenched in Burmese culture, the lack of patrons to support literature slowed its further development. The colonial period marked a tremendous change in Burmese literature, which had once been patronised and innovated by members of the royal court, and was now being led by civilians such as university students.

In 1910, J S Furnivall established the Burma Research Society, which further emboldened the Burmese to protect their literary and cultural heritage. Beginning in the 1920s, a nationalist movement emerged, and this influence became evident in modern novels, short stories, and poems. At the University of Rangoon, student writers continued to develop new forms of Burmese poetry.

A major landmark in Burmese literature was called the &quot;Hkit san&quot; (Testing the Times, ) movement, a search for a new style and content, led most notably by Theippan Maung Wa along with Nwe Soe, Zawgyi, Min Thu Wun and Mya Kaytu, while still at university and after, in the decade before the Second World War. During the &quot;Hkit san&quot; movement, University of Rangoon students innovated new styles of writing, with shorter and clearer sentences, and unadorned prose, a radical transformation from royal writings of the pre-colonial eras beforehand. The movement for independence continued to fuel Burmese literature.

Thakin Kodaw Hmaing was greatly influential in spawning this anti-colonial literature with his powerful &quot;laygyo gyi&quot; () and &quot;htika&quot; () verses famous for their patriotic and satirical content. Hmawbi Hsaya Thein was particularly influential, with &quot;Bazat yazawin&quot; (Oral Chronicles), which relied on oral tradition. Novels also came into vogue, with the first being James Hla Kyaw&#x27;s &quot;Maung Yin Maung Ma Me Ma&quot;, written in 1904 and inspired by the &quot;Count of Monte Cristo&quot;. &quot;Kala paw wut-htu&quot; (, &#x27;modern novels&#x27;) became popular during this era, with P Moe Nin writing the first Burmese novels to focus on the individual and place that character at the centre of the plot.

Theippan Maung Wa and Thein Pe Myint were among other original and innovative authors from the colonial period. Female writers, such as Dagon Khin Khin Lay, who wrote about the hardships of peasant life under colonialism, also gained prominence during the nationalist period leading up to independence. The British author George Orwell, who was severely critical of British colonialism, wrote &quot;Burmese Days&quot; published in 1935.

In addition, literary culture in Burma expanded to the masses during this period, with the arrival of printing presses and publishers, such as the Hanthawaddy Press, a major publisher of Burmese and Buddhist works established by Phillip Ripley. In the 1920s to the 1930s, monthly literary magazines like &quot;Dagon&quot; and &quot;Ganda Lawka&quot; (World of Classics) were published to connect readers to writers, who often published novels in serial installations.

== Post-independence literature (1948–present) ==
After independence in 1948, Burmese literature developed further to adopt and assimilate Western styles of writing. A year earlier, the Burmese Translation Society, a government-subsidised organisation, was founded to translate foreign works, especially those related to the fields of science and technology. In 1963, a year after the socialist coup, the society was merged into the Sapay Beikman (), a government publishing house. Another influential publisher was the Pagan Press (est. 1962), which translated Socialist and Marxist works into Burmese. In 1976, the first Burmese Encyclopedia () was published.

The socialist government, like the previous civilian government, was a patron of Burmese literature, believing &quot;enriching literature&quot; to be a goal of socialist democracies, as outlined in the Revolutionary Council&#x27;s &quot;System of Correlation of Man and his Environment&quot;. However, censorship and promotion of socialist ideology became important aims of the government, in regulating literature, as seen in the reorganisation of the Ministry of Information, which censored works according to three primary objectives that aimed to promote socialism:
# To introduce necessary bills, acts and orders concerning literature and information agencies.
# To promote participation of the people in the construction of the socialist state.
# To defend the socialist system from its ideological enemies.
—&quot;Discussion of the National Literary Conference&quot;. Rangoon: Ministry of Information, 1963.
=== Censorship ===
In 1971, the government formed the Burmese literary Commission, to develop Burmese literature further. On 5 July 1975, the Printers and Publishers&#x27; Central Registration Board, the main censorship board of the Home Ministry (four years earlier, the Board had been a part of the Information Ministry), issued a statement to warn publishers to self-censor works (especially those criticising the Burma Socialist Programme Party, the government, pornographic writing and libel), undermining the principle of freedom of expression. Many contemporary works are of history and biographical accounts. Because of strict government censorship beginning in the 1960s with the rule of Ne Win, Burmese literature has become subdued in many ways.

By 1976, only 411 titles were published annually, compared to 1882, when 445 titles were published. Various factors, especially the lengthened bureaucratic process to obtain printing permits, censorship, and increasing economic hardship of consumers because of the socialist economic schemes, contributed to the decline of Burmese literary output.

Popular novels have similar themes, often involving adventure, espionage, detective work, and romance. Many writers also translate Western novels, especially those of Arthur Hailey and Harold Robbins. The flourishing translation sector is the result of the Burmese government, which did not sign the Universal Copyright Convention Agreement, which would have forced Burmese writers to pay royalties to the original writers.

Short stories, often published in magazines, also enjoy tremendous popularity. They often deal with everyday life and have political messages (such as subtle criticisms of the capitalist system), partly because unlike novels, short stories are not censored by the Press Scrutiny Board. Poetry is also a popular genre today, as it was during the monarchical times, but unlike novels and other works, which use literary Burmese, may use the vernacular, instead of literary Burmese. This reform movement is led by left-leaning writers who believe laymen&#x27;s language (the vernacular and colloquial form of Burmese) ought to be used instead of formal Burmese in literature.

One of the greatest female writers of the Post-colonial period is Journal Kyaw Ma Ma Lay. Khin Myo Chit was another important writer, who wrote, among her works, &quot;The 13-Carat Diamond&quot; (1955), which was translated into many languages. The journalist Ludu U Hla was the author of numerous volumes of ethnic minority folklore, novels about inmates in U Nu-era jails, and biographies of people working in different occupations. The prime minister U Nu himself wrote several politically oriented plays and novels.

Other prolific writers of the post-colonial era include Thein Pe Myint (and his &quot;The Ocean Traveller and the Pearl Queen&quot;, considered a Burmese classic), Mya Than Tint (known for his translations of Western classics like &quot;War and Peace&quot;), Thawda Swe and Myat Htun. Distinguished female writers, who have also been an ever-present force in Burmese literary history, include Kyi Aye, Khin Hnin Yu, and San San Nweh.

== Contemporary ==
In 2012, the anthology &quot;Bones Will Crow: 15 Contemporary Burmese Poets&quot; was edited by Ko Ko Thett and James Byrne. It featured poetry from Tin Moe, Thitsar Ni, Aung Cheimt, Ma Ei, Maung Chaw Nwe, Maung Pyiyt Min, Khin Aung Aye, Zeyar Lynn, Maung Thein Zaw, Moe Zaw, Moe Way, ko ko thett, Eaindra, Pandora and Maung Yu Py, and was published by Arc Publications Anthologies in Translation series and, later in 2013, by Northern Illinois University Press in the United States. This bilingual English/Burmese edition of poetry is regarded as the first anthology of modern Burmese poetry in the West.

<doc id="1108415" wikidata="Q941387" url="?curid=1108415" title="Take Me Out (song)">
<text>&quot;Take Me Out&quot; is a song by Scottish indie rock band Franz Ferdinand. It was released as the second single from their eponymous debut studio album in the United Kingdom on 12 January 2004 and in the United States on 12 April 2004, both through Domino Records. It was released as 7-inch vinyl, a CD single, and a DVD single with the music video and a short interview with the band.

The single reached number three in the UK Singles Chart. In the United States, it reached number three on the Modern Rock Tracks chart and number 66 on the &quot; Billboard&quot; Hot 100. It was a number-seven hit on the Canadian Singles Chart and also reached number one on the UK Indie Chart. In December 3, 2024, the single was certified 4× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. The song was voted the best single of 2004 by &quot;The Village Voice&quot; Pazz &amp; Jop poll, and number one on Australian youth radio network Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 of the same year. In July 2009, it was voted number 100 on Triple J&#x27;s Hottest 100 of All Time.

==Background==
Franz Ferdinand formed in Glasgow in 2002 and wrote &quot;Take Me Out&quot; the following year. Songwriter Alex Kapranos said the idea for the song&#x27;s theme came from watching a snipers&#x27; duel in &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; and that &quot;it felt like a very good metaphor for the kind of romantic situations that we sometimes find ourselves in&quot;.

==Composition==
&quot;Take Me Out&quot; has been described musically as post-punk revival, indie rock, dance-rock, garage rock, art rock, and post-Britpop. Its first section is fast tempo guitar driven, with notes of a chord separated into individual notes, which was influenced by Giorgio Moroder, followed by a slower second section with disco hi-hat patterns and snare drums.

The call and answer guitar riff and vocal melody were inspired by blues musician Howlin&#x27; Wolf. The band attempted different arrangements before settling on a mid-song tempo change. Alex Kapranos said: &quot;The verses sounded better played a little bit faster and the chorus sounded better played a little slower and we could never quite work it out... I had this idea that we’re going to take all of the verses, put them at the beginning of the song, and then we’re going to slow it down and play all the choruses, which is kind of the wrong way to do it.&quot;

==Recording==
The song was recorded at Gula Studion in Malmö, Sweden with producer Tore Johansson. The tempo changes were recorded live in the studio. The sound of the cymbal being caught as soon as it was hit was influenced by rock music such as Queen. Producer Johansson said: &quot;there was no editing other than that we compiled the best take. We didn&#x27;t do any tricks of doing that on a different take and then doing the rest of the track.&quot; Johansson used multiple echo effects to achieve a &quot;marching, machinery, industrial feel... It&#x27;s very organic, but we wanted it to sound like you&#x27;re in a big workshop or something.&quot;

==Music video==
The music video for the song was directed by Jonas Odell. It includes the band amid a Dadaist animation involving quirky vintage figures and machinery reminiscent of Terry Gilliam&#x27;s cartoon segments for Monty Python. The video is a blend of the live-action band superimposed into a 3D environment with animated 2D elements. Frontman Alex Kapranos described the video&#x27;s influences as Dada, the films of Busby Berkeley, and Soviet propaganda, and praised Odell&#x27;s direction. Kapranos commented:

Basically it&#x27;s a pop video and it should entertain you, but not just once – there&#x27;re certain things you stare at in life that are just fascinating to look at like a fish tank or an open fire, they&#x27;re actually quite simple things but there&#x27;s something fascinating about them. And I think pop videos should be like that too. There should be something there that just makes you want to come back and look at it.

==Accolades==
The song received high critical acclaim upon its release in January 2004. &quot;Drowned in Sound&quot; called it &quot;a work of sheer clanging wonder&quot;. In March 2005, &quot; Q&quot; magazine placed &quot;Take Me Out&quot; at number 41 on its list of the 100 Greatest Guitar Tracks. In September 2005, the same magazine named it the 34th greatest track ever performed by a British band. &quot;Q&quot; made another list for its television channel, also named Q, of 100 greatest Indie Anthems, where &quot;Take Me Out&quot; appeared at number six. In May 2007, &quot;NME&quot; magazine placed &quot;Take Me Out&quot; at number 16 on its list of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever, whereas MTV2 placed it at number seven on its version of the 50 Greatest Indie Anthems Ever, which was loosely based on &quot;NME&quot;″s list. In October 2011, &quot;NME&quot; placed it at number 27 on its list of 150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked the song number 44 on its top 500 tracks of the 2000s. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Take Me Out&quot; number 327 on the 2010 version of its list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

<text>Alexander Nikolayevich Vinokourov (Kazakh and Russian ; born 16 September 1973) is a Kazakhstani former professional road bicycle racer and the current general manager of UCI WorldTeam . He is of Russian origin. As a competitor, his achievements include two bronze medals at the World Championships, four stage wins in the Tour de France, four in the Vuelta a España plus the overall title in 2006, two Liège–Bastogne–Liège monuments, one Amstel Gold Race, and the gold medal at the 2012 London Olympics Men&#x27;s Road Race. Vinokourov is a past national champion of Kazakhstan, and a dual-medalist at the Summer Olympics. In 2007, he received a two-year ban from cycling for blood doping. In 2019, he was accused of race fixing by prosecutors in Liège but was later cleared of the charges.

Vinokourov began cycling in 1984 as an 11-year-old, competing within the former Soviet Union. He moved to France in 1997 to finish his amateur career, and then turned professional there in 1998. After almost a decade as a professional, Vinokourov was caught blood doping during the 2007 Tour de France, which triggered the withdrawal of the entire Astana team from that year&#x27;s race. After a 2-year suspension from competition, he returned to cycling in August 2009, riding first for the national team of Kazakhstan and then rejoining Astana. A serious crash during the 2011 Tour de France threatened to prematurely end Vinokourov&#x27;s career for a second time, but he announced he would continue for one more season in 2012 – with an eye towards competing in the Olympic Games in London. There, Vinokourov played the role of ultimate spoiler when he dramatically won the gold medal in the men&#x27;s road race after breaking away in the closing miles with Colombian Rigoberto Urán.

Vinokourov retired after the Olympics and assumed management duties with for 2013. He was sacked as the team principal of Astana-Premier Tech in June 2021. However, in August 2021 Vinokourov returned as Team manager. He is an honorary colonel in the Kazakh army but lives in France with his wife and children.

==Racing career==

===1984–1996: Early amateur career===
According to his father, Nikolay, Vinokourov began cycling at age 11 when he joined a branch of the Petropavl&#x27;s Children and Youth Sports School. The Frenchman Vincent Lavenu, who would later offer Vinokourov his first professional contract, reported that the young Kazakhstani was training on the road every day at age 11, and also competing in cyclo-cross. In 1986 at age 13, Vinokourov became an athlete at a sports school in Almaty, then the capital of Kazakhstan, where he would train for the next five years. While fulfilling his compulsory two-year military service requirement, he also trained as part of the Soviet national team. Like some other top cyclists, he trained in Southern California during the winter months.

After Kazakhstan declared independence from the Soviet Union on 16 December 1991, Vinokourov continued to train and race, though as a member of the Kazakhstani national team. He placed third behind Pascal Hervé of France in the Regio Tour amateur stage race in Germany in 1993 (Vinokourov later would win this race as a professional in 2004). Other notable performances during these early years include winning two stages at the 1995 Tour of Ecuador and the overall GC at the 1996 Tour of Slovenia. Vinokourov also competed in the 1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta, where he finished 53rd in the men&#x27;s road race – an event he won 16 years later.

===1997: Amateur career at Espoir cycliste St-Etienne Loire===
In the winter of 1996, Gilles Mas, directeur sportif of the Agrigel-La Creuse team, received a letter from the coach of the Kazakhstani national team, inquiring about the possibility of placing six Kazakhstani cyclists in European professional teams. Mas agreed to take on the best two, but only on condition they first rode for the amateur Espoir Cycliste Saint-Étienne Loire (ECSEL) club for a year. Mas and Pierre Rivory of ECSEL chose Andrey Mizurov and Vinokourov.

Vinokourov arrived in France on 22 March 1997, after a sub-par performance due to illness in the Tour de Langkawi as a member of Kazakhstan&#x27;s national team. While he readily adapted to Europe, Mizurov – who had won the inaugural time trial in the 1997 Tour de Langkawi – struggled with homesickness and contemplated a return to Kazakhstan. Ultimately, in May 1997, Mizurov was replaced by Vinokourov&#x27;s former classmate Andrei Kivilev, who was then racing with an amateur team in Burgos in Spain after having placed 29th in the previous year&#x27;s Olympic road race. Mizurov would later turn professional in 1999 with , and he reunited with Vinokourov in 2007 at .

Vinokourov came second in a stage of the Tour of Auvergne two weeks after he arrived in Europe, and was best climber in a Coupe de France race a week later. Then, during a trial for the Casino professional team at the Tour of Saône et Loire, he won three of the four stages. In total, Vinokourov would win ten races for his amateur club, leading Vincent Lavenu to offer him a two-year professional contract to ride for Casino in 1998–1999.

===1998–2002===
Vinokourov won six races in 1998, his first year as a professional, including the Four Days of Dunkirk, the Tour de l&#x27;Oise, and stages in both the Tour of Poland and Circuit des Mines. In early 1999, he won the Volta a la Comunitat Valenciana stage race, and three months later took two stages of the Midi Libre. Vinokourov also won the Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, beating the American Jonathan Vaughters along the way. (He lost the yellow jersey to Vaughters after the Mont Ventoux time trial but regained it on the following mountain stage.)

In 2000, Vinokourov joined . He won the combination competition in Paris–Nice and finished third in the Critérium International. He came 15th in the Tour de France after working for captain Jan Ullrich. His first win for the German team was stage 18 in the Vuelta a España, in which he caught the two riders in the breakaway and sprinted past Roberto Laiseka and Vicente Garcia Acosta in the last 300 metres. He came second several weeks later in the Olympic Games behind Ullrich and in front of another Telekom teammate, Andreas Klöden.

Vinokourov time-trialed to a stage win in the 2001 Deutschland Tour and took the yellow jersey from his Telekom teammate Erik Zabel. The dominance of the Telekom team was evident the following day when Rolf Aldag won and Vinokourov gained a minute and a half over the peloton to ensure victory. He rode the Tour de France that year in support of Ullrich, where he finished 16th overall.

Vinokourov won Paris–Nice in 2002, taking the leader&#x27;s jersey after attacking Laurent Jalabert and Andrei Kivilev on Mont Faron. The penultimate stage to the Col d&#x27;Eze, a mountaintop finish, Vinokourov kept his lead and won Paris–Nice the following day. Later in 2002, he won the first mountain stage in the Tour de Suisse but several stages later he fell on a mountain descent and was taken to hospital after the stage. Vino abandoned the race to prepare for the Tour but it was discovered two weeks later that he had a broken coccyx and could not ride the 2002 Tour de France.

===2003–2005===

2003 would be a breakthrough year for Vinokourov, but one marred by an early-season personal tragedy that nevertheless drove him to perform inspirationally. His close friend Andrei Kivilev fell heavily during the second stage of Paris–Nice, slipped into a coma, and died during the night. The loss of his compatriot weighed heavily on Vinokourov, but he rallied and declared that he was more motivated than ever to win. Stage three had been neutralized and stage four was a time trial, but on stage five, which featured the race&#x27;s only mountaintop finish, Vinokourov honoured his late-friend with a spectacular attack on Mont Faron that won him the stage and the leader&#x27;s jersey. As he crossed the line, Vinokourov pointed skyward, and later explained to the press:

Most of all, [it&#x27;s a victory for] for Andrei Kivilev. He wanted to win on Mont Faron and also Paris–Nice. I really gave everything for this victory, and today was a coup double, for him and for his family. I found the strength to continue the race, only for him, for his family, for his little boy. I&#x27;m satisfied today for myself and for them. I&#x27;m going to do everything to keep the jersey, and for that I found a double strength, myself and his strength as well. It&#x27;s fantastic, and I&#x27;m very happy. For sure it&#x27;s a victory for him, and I hope to keep the jersey until Nice.

Two days later, Vinokourov won Paris–Nice and in a final gesture to his friend, he displayed a photograph of Kivilev on the podium.
Forty days later, after the traditional period for mourning in Kazakhstan, Vinokourov won the Amstel Gold Race. He had reached the leading group with 10 kilometres to go, and attacked them at the 5 km banner. Vinokourov built an advantage of 15 seconds that he fought to maintain up the steep Cauberg finishing climb, winning by four seconds ahead of Michael Boogerd.

Vinokourov attacked on the flat first stage of the 2003 Tour de Suisse and only the Russian Serguei Ivanov could match him. Vinokourov won the stage and took the lead. Francesco Casagrande dropped Vinokourov on the first mountain stage and closed the gap to six seconds. Casagrande attacked again on the following mountain stage and took the jersey. But Casagrande cracked several days later in an individual time trial as Vinokourov finished fifth to retake the jersey and win the race.

Vinokourov was for the first time riding to win in the 2003 Tour de France. He was to share this role in his team with the Colombian Santiago Botero. Vinokourov finished second on the stage to the l&#x27;Alpe d&#x27;Huez. He attacked the following day on the final climb 9 km from the finish and won the stage. He moved into second overall, 21 seconds short of Lance Armstrong. Several days later in the individual time trial, won by Ullrich, Vinokourov took third position and kept it to the end. He was voted the most combative rider.

Vinokourov missed the break on the second stage of the 2004 Paris–Nice that gained five minutes, but he won three stages. He attacked towards the end of a small climb on the fifth stage with 8 km to go. He built ten seconds and won by four seconds. He dedicated the win to Kivilev. Vinokourov attacked the lead group on the flat windy coastal road in the finale of stage 7, with 5 km to go. He caught and passed Samuel Sánchez with 2 km to go and won the stage. Vinokourov won the final stage in a breakaway sprint against Denis Menchov .

Vinokourov came third in Liège–Bastogne–Liège, behind Davide Rebellin and Michael Boogerd. Boogerd and Vinokourov had been matching each other while Rebellin waited for the sprint and won. Vinokourov crashed on the second stage of the Tour de Suisse, tearing ligaments in his shoulder. That stopped him riding the 2004 Tour de France.

He returned for the Regio Tour at the start of August. In the second stage, he won the time trial. In the following stage, he won the bunch sprint and took the leader&#x27;s jersey to win. He then rode the Vuelta a España but due to food poisoning lost time during the first week. Vinokourov recovered and finished fourth in the time trial. He rode the world championship and took the bronze medal in the time trial.

Vinokourov&#x27;s first win in 2005 and the first for the team was Liège–Bastogne–Liège. He broke away with Jens Voigt with more than 50 km to go. Vinokourov attacked on the final short climb 6 km from the finish but could not get away from Voigt. Instead he waited and beat Voigt in the sprint. In the Dauphiné Libéré, Vinokourov won the stage on Mont Ventoux. He had attacked the favourites for the Tour de France, reaching the breakaway before attacking at several hundred metres on the uphill finish to win the stage. Vinokourov travelled back to Kazakhstan to win the national championship ahead of Mizourov and Kashechkin.
Vinokourov said in July 2005 that he was in as good condition as 2003, when he came third. Vinokourov said he was riding &quot;for the team&quot;. The implication was that he would be leader if he or Andreas Klöden (second in 2004) rode better than Ullrich. Vinokourov came third in the opening time trial, beating Ullrich and Klöden by 15 seconds and 1:08. The American Lance Armstrong followed Vinokourov&#x27;s attacks on stage 8 but let Klöden go. Vinokourov rode separately from his teammates, bringing speculation regarding Ullrich&#x27;s role in the team.

Vinokourov lost time in the mountains. Revenge came when he won stage 11 in a break, outsprinting Santiago Botero.

Tension between Vinokourov and his team boiled on stage 14 into the Pyrenees where Vinokourov was dropped. He chased for 20 km and then attacked, but Kloden and Ullrich reeled him in, bringing criticism of T-Mobile&#x27;s tactics which were apparently just to support Ullrich. Vinokourov settled his differences when he won stage 21 to Paris.

After 3rd place in the time trial in the penultimate stage, losing time to only Armstrong and Ullrich, Vinokourov moved to 6th, trailing Levi Leipheimer in 5th by two seconds. The final stage, usually a formality, became a showdown between Vinokourov and Leipheimer. A sprint prime with time bonuses came at 75 km in Châteny-Malabry. Leipheimer and his Gerolsteiner team came to the front. Leipheimer needed to prevent Vinokourov from getting it. Gerolsteiner set a fast tempo to discourage Vinokourov. But 1.5 km from the sprint, Vinokourov attacked. Soon only Leipheimer could hold his wheel, but he was not able to pass and so Vinokourov gained six seconds, Leipheimer four. Leipheimer was ahead only by a fraction of a second. When they reached Paris officials stopped the clock due to dangerous conditions (the cobblestone road was wet and slippery from rain), and the final sprint prime was cancelled.

Leipheimer said he was informed that normal bonus time for 1st, 2nd and 3rd place on the stage would also not be awarded. He and others thought Leipheimer had 5th place. In the final kilometers, several riders broke clear but were caught. Then, as the pace was increasing, Vinokourov moved to the front. With 2 km remaining, Laurent Brochard attacked and Vinokourov jumped on his wheel. A few seconds later Brad McGee closed the gap. When Brochard cracked, McGee moved to the front, but Vinokourov followed. They achieved a gap that could not be closed. McGee zigged and zagged, making Vinokourov work, but Vinokourov found enough power to pull around McGee and win.

That was victory made of courage and guts – I really gave it all in the last kilometres, although I didn&#x27;t think it was possible until I crossed the line. I just went &#x27;à bloc&#x27; – it&#x27;s unbelievable, magnificent! I have no words for it...I did think a lot about Kivilev yesterday in St. Etienne, and I think that motivated me even more. I&#x27;m very happy to win.

Tour officials awarded time bonuses after all, so Vinokourov gained 20 seconds to put him into 5th place. As his contract with T-Mobile was up in 2005, many speculated on which team he would join, and whether it would give him full support in 2006. The team turned out to be Manolo Saiz&#x27;s team.

===2006–2007===

Liberty Seguros withdrew sponsorship on 25 May 2006 after the arrest of Manolo Saiz relating to blood doping. A coalition of companies from Kazakhstan took over sponsorship, now called . On 30 June 2006, Astana-Würth withdrew from the 2006 Tour de France after five riders were implicated in the Operación Puerto doping case, leaving Vinokourov, one of the favorites, with three teammates, below the required six riders. Vinokourov was never accused or implicated.

In the Vuelta a España, the team was known simply as after Würth departed sponsorship. After losing time in the first mountains, Vinokourov went into attack. He lost the 7th stage to Alejandro Valverde, took revenge by winning the 8th and 9th stages and climbed to 5th place at the end of the first week. After a good time trial, and aggressive climbing on stages 17 &amp; 18 (stage 18 was won by Kashechkin), Vinokourov took first place and claimed the gold jersey from Valverde. After a strong time trial, his 3rd stage victory, Vinokourov won the Vuelta.

Following his one and only Grand Tour victory at the Vuelta, Vinokourov rode to a podium finish at the World Championships TT in Salzburg, where he took third behind winner Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland, and the American runner-up, David Zabriskie – both of . Vino dropped his chain in the middle of the 15 percent climb, but in his typical laconic manner brushed-off the mishap, explaining:

I had a hard time putting it back on, but the time I lost only counted for second or third place, so it wasn&#x27;t that important. Now, I&#x27;ll concentrate on the road race, for which I&#x27;m really motivated.

Vinokourov started the 2007 Tour de France as a definite &quot;Yellow jersey favourite,&quot; with a new team backed by the same Kazakh sponsors who had taken over Liberty Seguros in 2006 – . The Tour started well when he placed 7th in the London prologue, losing only 30 seconds to time-trial specialist Fabian Cancellara. He was ranked inside the top 10 through the second stage, and he remained in contention for the overall until the fifth stage, when he experienced a misfortune. As the peloton accelerated before the final climb, Vinokourov fell heavily at high speed and tumbled into a ditch with 25k to go. He suffered severe cuts and abrasions to both knees and elbows, and serious bruising to his right buttock. The wounded Kazakh could be seen standing on the left side of the road, gesticulating while a frantic teammate struggled to fix his leader&#x27;s damaged bike.

The main field did not slow to allow Vinokourov to reintegrate with the bunch, but instead raced on towards the finish in Autun. He remounted and began to chase, calling back seven of his eight teammates to help his bid to regain the leaders. The Astana train pursued the favorites, until Vinokourov himself surged ahead of his companions and led the last wave of the chase. When he crossed the line, he finished 1–20 behind his main rivals, all of whom arrived together.

After the dramatic crash and the serious injuries, he lost time in the Alps and was dismissed from the list of GC contenders.

But despite his injuries, and after seemingly being written off by the press and his rivals, Vinokourov rallied and won the first individual time trial by 1:14 from Cadel Evans. He explained:

I am happy with my performance, I am finding my legs again. Now I want to attack in the Pyrénées. I want to thank everyone in and around the team that encouraged me to get through the Alps.

He also won stage 15, a mountain stage finishing in Loudenvielle.

===Blood doping suspension===
The next day (24 July) Vinokourov failed a doping control following his time trial victory. His blood had a double population of erythrocytes, which implied a homologous transfusion. He delivered a positive for blood doping on 24 July 2007.

As a result, his team pulled out after being requested to withdraw by ASO president Patrice Clerc.

Vinokourov&#x27;s B sample came back positive a few days later, and Cadel Evans was declared winner of stage 13. Vinokourov was stripped of his stage 15 victory, which was awarded to Kim Kirchen of Luxembourg. According to Phil Liggett, long-time commentator for the Tour, &quot;It is incomprehensible that Vinokourov could do such a thing when he must have known he was under suspicion because of his dealing with disgraced doctor Michele Ferrari in Italy. He must have known he would be tested at every opportunity, and the time trial was the perfect occasion.&quot;

Vinokourov received a one-year suspension from the Kazakhstan Cycling Federation. The UCI was angered by the short ban—a lighter sentence than those received by other cyclists found guilty, such as Tyler Hamilton and Ivan Basso—which would allow him to ride in the 2008 Beijing Olympics. His team Astana then threatened to sue Vinokourov for damages, as did Cadel Evans and team , due to the publicity they lost for Evans not being named the winner at the time of the stage.

In December 2007, Vinokourov announced his retirement.

===2009–2010===

Vinokourov, banned for a year after doping at the 2007 Tour de France, told the Belgian TV program &quot;Sporza&quot; that he wanted to race again in 2009. He said: I love cycling. I want to come back because I didn&#x27;t want to end my career in this way. I feel as if I can win once again the big races.

The UCI then renewed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, asking it to overturn the one-year suspension by the Kazakh federation and to impose a standard two-year ban. This appeal, originally filed in 2007, was dropped when Vinokourov said he was retiring. The case was retabled and the CAS ruled the ban would expire on 24 July 2009.

Vinokourov made his comeback in Tour de l&#x27;Ain in August 2009, riding for Kazakhstan. In the third stage, a time trial over 8.6 km, he won his first race after his ban. Vinokourov re-joined Astana on 24 August 2009 and was named for the 2009 Vuelta a España.

Returning after a blood doping sanction after the 2007 Tour de France and sidelined from the sport, Vinokourov began his first important race the 2010 Giro d&#x27;Italia. He rode well in the early-season Tour of the Mediterranean, where he finished 5th overall, and served as a super-domestique for his Astana teammate Alberto Contador at the Critérium International. He rode to victory in April at the opening time trial of the Giro del Trentino in Italy, where he took 35 seconds out of former Giro winner Ivan Basso in only 12.5 km. He successfully defended his overall lead and won the event over fellow doper, Riccardo Riccò of the Ceramica Flaminia team. It was his first major win since he returned to Astana the previous August, and an unusually-expressive Vinokourov shared his thoughts post-race:

It&#x27;s a great satisfaction. By winning the first stage against the clock I didn&#x27;t think I would keep the jersey until the end. I even thought not to ride this last stage because I would have driven to Liege if there was no plane. Fortunately, the volcano in Iceland has subsided. I have a flight tonight from Bergamo to Belgium. It [the fact that he wouldn&#x27;t have to drive] especially helped me to defend my jersey until the final. Riccó is very strong and I feared him a lot with a uphill finish like today. He arrived second and I went fourth just 12 seconds behind, which means that my legs were not bad either.

Because of his recent doping suspension, Vinokourov could not count on riding the 2010 Tour de France, but Giro organizers had no similar qualms about inviting him to their event. He targeted a strong performance in the Italian grand tour, although he took pains to downplay his chances of overall victory:

I do not talk about winning [the Giro d&#x27;Italia], but I would certainly [aim to] wear the pink jersey for one day. That would be nice for my collection.

With Contador&#x27;s help, Vinokourov won the 2010 Liège–Bastogne–Liège, six seconds clear of breakaway companion Alexandr Kolobnev with Spain&#x27;s Alejandro Valverde coming in third, more than a minute after the pair. In December 2011, Swiss magazine &quot;L&#x27;Illustre&quot; ran a story about how Vinokourov had allegedly bought the victory. It was revealed that Kolobnev (who was not on the same team) received a payment of 100,000 Euros after the race from a bank account owned by the Kazakh in Monaco to Kolobnev&#x27;s bank account in Locarno. The magazine published the e-mail exchange between the two, which started the day after the race. In these, Kolobnev wonders if he had done the right thing by letting him win and shares a copy of his bank info, expressing concerns that they may get caught. Vinokourov replied: &quot;You have done everything properly, do not worry. As you say, the Earth is round and God sees everything [...] Do not worry about the agreement, I will do it.&quot; Vinokourov did not deny a payment was made, but said that he did not buy the race: &quot;It&#x27;s another story to blacken my name. I often loan money left and right.&quot; In 2015 investigators in Liege recommended that Vinokourov be tried for bribery. A trial date was initially fixed for March 2017, but has been postponed and is slated to begin in May 2018. On 12 September 2019, prosecutors requested for Vinokourov and Kolobnev to be sentenced to six months in prison and Vinokourov to be fined €100,000. on 5 November 2019, Vinokourov was cleared of the charge of fraud, with the judge citing &quot;lack of concrete evidence&quot; for the court&#x27;s decision.

Paired with his Spanish teammate in the Ardennes, Vinokourov paved the way for Contador&#x27;s supremacy in July, and pledged fealty to the defending Tour de France champ, whom he vowed to support:

It has always been the plan that I&#x27;d work for Alberto at the Tour and for myself at the Giro.

Barely a month later at the Giro d&#x27;Italia, Vinokourov finished 6th overall after having worn the pink jersey as leader of the general classification for five dramatic stages.

On just his third day ever racing the Giro, Vinokourov inherited the pink leader&#x27;s jersey from Cadel Evans of BMC after the Australian was involved in a seafront crash with 15 km to go to the finish. Vinokourov couldn&#x27;t hide the fact that he was happy to lead the Giro:

I was riding the last ten kilometres without thinking of taking the pink jersey. I had seen that André Greipel was up there, so I was convinced that he&#x27;d win the stage and take the pink jersey with the time bonus. But he didn&#x27;t win, so the jersey is mine. To get it is wonderful. I received it without looking for it, really. This is my first participation to the Giro d&#x27;Italia and I already have the jersey.

Vinokourov fulfilled his promise to Contador and served as his teammate&#x27;s super-domestique during the Tour, which Contador completed ahead of Andy Schleck and Denis Menchov. However Contador&#x27;s victory was vacated when it was determined he had tested positive for a minute amount of the banned drug clenbuterol. Despite this, Astana still saw some measure of success in the Tour, with Vinokourov winning stage 13 after a solo attack over the last climb of the day and a determined effort to hold off the field. He summed up his triumph:

I showed I worked hard in these two years.

===2011–2012===
In the 9th stage of the Tour de France 2011 Vinokourov fell and broke his right femur. On 17 July 2011, his &quot;retirement&quot; from professional cycling was announced, unofficially and without comment, on Twitter pages by fellow cyclists. Later that day he confirmed his retirement. Rehabilitating from the accident he discovered he felt better than he had anticipated, and decided to ride the 2011 Giro di Lombardia before retiring. In September, he decided to postpone his retirement altogether, and announced he would return for the 2012 season and ride for Astana in the Tour de France.
True to his word, Vinokourov returned to pro cycling in 2012 as a rider and debuted at the Tour de Langkawi with his Astana teammates, the same place that Vinokourov started his pro career with Casino with his 1997 performance with the Kazakhstan national team.

Vinokourov stated that the team was aiming for the &quot;overall title&quot;, as opposed to any personal win. He explained,
:&quot;This is my first big race since I crashed at the Tour de France last year and it will be a good start for my season, for me to find my rhythm before heading to Europe for the Classics.

While he had a quiet spring season of racing, barring accident, illness, or another doping scandal, Vinokourov&#x27;s spot on Astana&#x27;s Tour de France 2012 roster was secure owing to his status within the team and the symbolic importance for Kazakhstan of his participation. And while he did not win a stage, Vinokourov featured in several breakaways, including an attack on Stage 18 that saw him win the Combativity award for the day.

One week after the conclusion of the Tour, Vinokourov won the gold medal in the Men&#x27;s Road Race at the London 2012 Olympics. Vinokourov and the Colombian Rigoberto Urán attacked out of a large breakaway group with 8 km to go and worked steadily together until the finish. He then drew ahead of Urán in the final three hundred meters, and crossed the line alone, arms-aloft. Afterward, he said,

It&#x27;s just unbelievable. I finished the Tour de France a little tired, but the Olympics, I must go there.&quot; About the breakaway group, he continued, &quot;It was up-down, up-down, too many people. It was very dangerous. I knew that if I was following the group I would have had no chance in the sprint. I finish my career with this victory.&quot;

He became one of the oldest cyclists male or female to win an olympic medal and had the race been a World Championship he would have been older than the oldest rider to ever win gold with Joop Zoetemelk in 1985. Vinokourov also stated that had this race been a world championship he felt it would have come down to a sprint finish because the teams would have been more complete and would have had better communication by using team radios, which were not used in the Olympics.

Confirming his retirement after collecting his medal, Vinokourov – the only Olympic medalist in the men&#x27;s road race from an Asian country – also became the only cyclist to win two medals in the discipline. Before winning gold in 2012, he claimed silver in 2000 (see Men&#x27;s Road Race for a list of all medalists in this event). Vinokourov&#x27;s last official competition would be the time trial at the Olympics the following week. He explained:

It is nice to finish off my career with a gold medal. I will still race in the time trial on Wednesday, but I will just spin. I have what I have wanted. I have the gold medal and I can envision my retirement.

After his win, he released a statement saying that he may &quot;continue in select events in 2012&quot;.

I just won an Olympic title. It was a dream, so I cannot be sad. This is the last important race of my career, but I might race some other races at the end of this season as an Olympic champion.

Vinokourov rode his last race at the 2012 Clásica de San Sebastián.

On Sunday, September 10, 2023, in Nice, he won the Ironman World Championships in the 50-54 age category, clocking a time of 9 hours and 35 minutes.

==Retirement==

On 16 September 2012, Vinokourov auctioned his Olympic gold-winning Specialized bicycle. It was sold to the Tak Group Company for $243,000. The starting price amounted to $50,000. Vinokourov donated the money from the auction for treatment of five children with serious diseases.

The bicycle brought good luck to me and I can now support the young citizens of Kazakhstan who are having a difficult time by selling this bicycle. I hope that some of them will become champions, not necessarily in sport, but in their own lives. They should be strong in spirit and fight to the end! And this way they will win&quot;, Vinokourov said at the closure of the auction.

In the autumn of 2012, Alexander Vinokourov entered L.N. Gumilyov Eurasian National University to work towards a master&#x27;s degree in Physical Education.

<text>Equal pay for equal work is the concept of labour rights that individuals in the same workplace be given equal pay. It is most commonly used in the context of sexual discrimination, in relation to the gender pay gap. Equal pay relates to the full range of payments and benefits, including basic pay, non-salary payments, bonuses and allowances. Some countries have moved faster than others in addressing equal pay.

==Early history ==
As wage labor became increasingly formalized during the Industrial Revolution, women were often paid less than their male counterparts for the same labor, whether for the explicit reason that they were women or under another pretext. The principle of equal pay for equal work arose at the same part of first-wave feminism, with early efforts for equal pay being associated with nineteenth-century Trade Union activism in industrialized countries: for example, a series of strikes by unionized women in the UK in the 1830s. Pressure from Trade Unions has had varied effects, with trade unions sometimes promoting conservatism. Carrie Ashton Johnson was an American suffragist who related equal pay and wages of women in the industrial workforce to the issue of women&#x27;s suffrage. In 1895, she was quoted by the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; as having said, &quot;When women are given the ballot, there will be equal pay for equal work.&quot; 

Before woman&#x27;s suffrage, women who sought equal pay for equal work used a variety of strategies to convince city and state governments that they deserved the same pay as their male counterparts. For example, the women in the New York City Interborough Association of Women Teachers won their campaign in 1911 by streamlining their goals and emphasizing women&#x27;s important role in the schoolroom. 
Following the Second World War, trade unions and the legislatures of industrialized countries gradually embraced the principle of equal pay for equal work; one example of this process is the UK&#x27;s introduction of the Equal Pay Act 1970 in response both to the Treaty of Rome and the Ford sewing machinists strike of 1968. In recent years European trade unions have generally exerted pressure on states and employers to progress in this direction.

==International human rights law==

In international human rights law, the statement on equal pay is the 1951 Equal Remuneration Convention, Convention 100 of the International Labour Organization, a United Nations body. The Convention states that

:: Each Member shall, by means appropriate to the methods in operation for determining rates of remuneration, promote and, in so far as is consistent with such methods, ensure the application to all workers of the principle of equal remuneration for men and women workers for work of equal value.

Equal pay for equal work is also covered by Article 7 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, Article 4 of the European Social Charter, and Article 15 of African Charter on Human and Peoples&#x27; Rights. The Constitution of the International Labour Organization also proclaims &quot;the principles of equal remuneration for equal value&quot;.

The EEOC&#x27;s four affirmative defenses allows unequal pay for equal work when the wages are set &quot;pursuant to (i) a seniority system; (ii) a merit system; (iii) a system which measures earnings by quantity or quality of production; or (iv) ... any other factor other than sex.&quot; A pay differential due to one of these factors is not in breach of the convention.

==Legal situation by jurisdiction==

===European Union/European Economic Area===
Post-war Europe has seen a fairly consistent pattern in women&#x27;s participation in the labour market and legislation to promote equal pay for equal work across Eastern and Western countries.

Some countries now in the EU, including France, Germany, and Poland, had already enshrined the principle of equal pay for equal work in their constitutions before the foundation of the EU (see table below). When the European Economic Community, later the European Union (EU), was founded in 1957, the principle of equal pay for equal work was named as a key principle. Article 141 of the Treaty of Rome says &quot;each Member State shall ensure that the principle of equal pay for male and female workers for equal work or work of equal value is applied.&quot; While socially progressive, this decision does not necessarily indicate widespread progressive attitudes among the signatories to the treaty:

::While this is often viewed as an example of the progressive nature of the European community, some argue that Article 141 (previously 119) was included largely as a concession to the French who already had equal pay legislation and feared that they would be at a comparative disadvantage.

The EEC&#x27;s legislation was clarified in 1975 by the binding and directly applicable equal pay directive 75/117/EEC. This prohibited all discrimination on the grounds of sex in relation to pay; this and other directives were integrated into a single Directive in 2006 (2006/54/EC).

At the national level the principle of equal pay is in general fully reflected in the legislation of the 28 EU member states and the additional countries of the European Economic Area (EEA), Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The EU candidate countries of Macedonia and Turkey also adapted their legislation to EU standards. The main national legislation concerning pay equity between men and women for different European countries is as follows.

2018 Update
&quot;Law on Equal Pay Certification based on the Equal Pay Standard in Iceland&quot;

Iceland introduced an Equal Pay Standard in 2012, ÍST 85:2012 (Equal wage management system - Requirements and guidance). The standard was developed by the Icelandic trade unions, the employers&#x27; confederation and government officials with the goal in mind that it would help employers prevent salary discrimination and enable them to become certified.

In 2017, the Icelandic government decided to add an amendment to the 2008 laws Act on Equal Status and Equal Rights of Women and Men (#10/2008). The amendment is a law on equal pay certification and was put into effect on January 1 in 2018. According to the amendment companies and institutions employing 25 or more workers, on annual basis, will be required to obtain equal pay certification of their equal pay system and the implementation thereof. The purpose of this obligatory certification is to enforce the current legislation prohibiting discriminatory practices based on gender and requiring that women and men working for the same employer shall be paid equal wages and enjoy equal terms of employment for the same jobs or jobs of equal value.

===United States===
====Federal law: Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964====

By the 20th century, women made up about a quarter of United States workforce but were still paid far less than men, whether it was the same job or a different job. There were different laws for women in some states such as, not working at night and restriction of their working hours. Women started entering more factory jobs when World War II began to replace men who were enlisted in the military. The wage gap continued to escalate during the war. The National War Labor Board put policies in place to help provide equal pay for women who were directly replacing men.

The first attempt at equal pay legislation in the United States, H.R. 5056, &quot;Prohibiting Discrimination in Pay on Account of Sex&quot;, was introduced by Congresswoman Winifred C. Stanley of Buffalo, New York, on June 19, 1944. Twenty years later, legislation passed by the federal government in 1963 made it illegal to pay men and women different wage rates for equal work on jobs that require equal skill, effort, and responsibility, and are performed under similar working conditions. One year after passing the Equal Pay Act, Congress passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Title VII of this act makes it unlawful to discriminate based on a person&#x27;s race, religion, color, or sex. Title VII attacks sex discrimination more broadly than the Equal Pay Act extending not only to wages but to compensation, terms, conditions or privileges of employment. Thus with the Equal Pay Act and Title VII, an employer cannot deny women equal pay for equal work; deny women transfers, promotions, or wage increases; manipulate job evaluations to relegate women&#x27;s pay; or intentionally segregate men and women into jobs according to their gender.

Since Congress was debating this bill at the same time that the Equal Pay Act was coming into effect, there was concern over how these two laws would interact, which led to the passage of Senator Bennett&#x27;s Amendment. This Amendment states: &quot;It Shall not be unlawful employment practice under this subchapter for any employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex ... if such differentiation is authorized by the provisions of the [Equal Pay Act].&quot; There was confusion on the interpretation of this Amendment, which was left to the courts to resolve.
Thus US federal law now states that &quot;employers may not pay unequal wages to men and women who perform jobs that require substantially equal skill, effort and responsibility, and that are performed under similar working conditions within the same establishment.&quot;

====New York state====
In 1944, the state of New York outlawed wage discrimination based on one&#x27;s gender. On 10 July 2019, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law legislation guaranteeing equal pay for equal work regardless of one&#x27;s gender. This builds on the 1944 law by prohibiting employers from asking job candidates about their previously salary, a loophole that has had a history of enforcing pay inequality based on gender. Cuomo signed the law in tandem with the 2019 Women&#x27;s World Cup victory parade in New York City.

====Washington state====

In Washington, Governor Evans implemented a pay equity study in 1973 and another in 1977. The results clearly showed that when comparing male and female dominated jobs there was almost no overlap between the averages for similar jobs and in every sector, a twenty percent gap emerged. For example, a food service worker earned $472 per month, and a Delivery Truck Driver earned $792, though they were both given the same number of &quot;points&quot; on the scale of comparable worth to the state. Unfortunately for the state, and for the female state workers, his successor Governor Dixie Lee Ray failed to implement the recommendations of the study (which clearly stated women made 20 percent less than men). Thus in 1981, AFSCME filed a sex discrimination complaint with the EEOC against the State of Washington. The District Court ruled that since the state had done a study of sex discrimination in the state, found that there was severe disparities in wages, and had not done anything to ameliorate these disparities, this constituted discrimination under Title VII that was &quot;pervasive and intentional&quot;. The Court then ordered the State to pay its over 15,500 women back pay from 1979 based on a 1983 study of comparable worth. This amounted to over $800 million. However, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit overturned this decision, stating that Washington had always required their employees&#x27; salaries to reflect the free market, and discrimination was one cause of many for wage disparities. The court stated, &quot;the State did not create the market disparity ... [and] neither law nor logic deems the free market system a suspect enterprise.&quot; While the suit was ultimately unsuccessful, it led to state legislation bolstering state workers&#x27; pay. The costs for implementing this equal pay policy was 2.6% of personnel costs for the state.

====Minnesota====

In Minnesota, the state began considering a formal comparable worth policy in the late 1970s when the Minnesota Task Force of the Council on the Economic Status of Women commissioned Hay Associates to conduct a study. The results were staggering and similar to the results in Washington (there was a 20% gap between state male and female workers pay). Hay Associates proved that in the 19 years since the Equal Pay Act was passed, wage discrimination persisted and had even increased over from 1976 to 1981. Using their point system, they noted that while delivery van drivers and clerk typists were both scaled with 117 points each of &quot;worth&quot; to the state, the delivery van driver (a male-dominated profession) was paid $1,382 a month while the clerk typist (a female dominated profession) was paid $1,115 a month. The study also noted that women were severely underrepresented in manager and professional positions, and that state jobs were often segregated by sex. The study finally recommended that the state take several courses of action: 1) establish comparable worth considerations for female-dominated jobs; 2) set aside money to ameliorate the pay inequity; 3) encourage affirmative action for women and minorities and 4) continue analyzing the situation to improve it. The Minnesota Legislature moved immediately in response. In 1983 the state appropriated 21.8 million dollars to begin amending the pay disparities for state employees. From 1982 to 1993, women&#x27;s wages in the state increased 10%. According to the Star Tribune, in 2005 women in Minnesota state government made 97 cents to the dollar, ranking Minnesota as one of the most equal for female state workers in the country. Five years later in 2010, full pay equity for women in state employment was finally achieved, with recurring, typically minor pay adjustments in local governments occurring regularly.

====Federal law: Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act====
In 2009, President Obama signed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, permitting women to sue employers for unfair pay up to 180 days after receiving an unfair paycheck. On 29 January 2016, he signed an executive order obliging all companies with at least 100 employees to disclose the pay of all workers to the federal government, with breakdowns of pay by race, gender, and ethnicity. The goal is to encourage employers to give equal pay for equal work by increasing transparency.

==== Massachusetts ====
In August 2016, Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker signed a bill to improve upon the already existing Massachusetts Equal Pay Act. On July 1, 2018, this updated amendment went into effect to protect employees from being asked their previous salary by their current employer. Governor Baker sought change in the current system after recognizing that women in their respective fields, on average, were making 76 cents on the dollar compared to men doing the same job. Under the updated Massachusetts Equal Pay Act, employers are not allowed to have disparity in pay for employees doing a job that requires the same level of skill, effort, and responsibility. The Massachusetts Equal Pay Act only permits differences in pay when it is based on merit, seniority, revenue generated, education, and location or travel. At the time of its arrival in 2018, the Massachusetts Equal Pay Act became the strongest advocate for equal pay between genders in the United States. It became the first state to provide affirmative defense to employers under the condition they have performed a self-audit of their pay practices. In order to be protected, there needs to be proven record of efforts made to close the disparity in pay before they become liable for double of the discriminated employee&#x27;s lost wages.

====State and local laws, 2010s====

California and New York City have adopted laws which prohibit employers from asking about salary history to determine the salary that will be offered for a new job. This is intended to narrow the gender pay gap by reducing the impact of past discrimination. Many other U.S. states were considering similar laws, as of May 2017.

===Australia===

In 1948, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights started to recognize equal pay for equal work. The Equal Remuneration Convention was released in 1951 by the International Labour Organization. The convention stated that it recommends jobs to be classified according to the nature of the work rather than who is performing the work. Women and men participated in protests, calling the government to fix the 1951 convention and make equal pay the law in Australia. Industrial action in some industries set a precedent for change, such as the national granting of equal pay for hotel workers in 1968 by the Federal arbitration commission following stop work meetings and a coordinated strike the previous year. In 1969, there was a case brought to the ACAC by the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union against the Meat and Allied Trades Federation. Workers argued for equal pay for every employee and the ruling of the commission was that the general female award minimum wage at 85 per cent of the male wage. This decision helped equal pay for women who were working the same job that traditionally the men would do, but all the other women got the 85 per cent. In 1972 the decision was reassessed and rules that either women or men who are working at a similar job that has a similar value, are eligible for the same working rate.

Under Australia&#x27;s old centralised wage fixing system, &quot;equal pay for work of equal value&quot; by women was introduced in 1969. Anti-discrimination on the basis of sex was legislated in 1984.

===Canada===
In Canadian usage, the terms &quot;pay equity&quot; and &quot;pay equality&quot; are used somewhat differently from in other countries. The two terms refer to distinctly separate legal concepts.

&quot;Pay equality&quot;, or equal pay for equal work, refers to the requirement that men and women be paid the same if performing the same job in the same organization. For example, a female electrician must be paid the same as a male electrician in the same organization. Reasonable differences are permitted if due to seniority or merit.

&quot;Pay equality&quot; is required by law in each of Canada&#x27;s 14 legislative jurisdictions (ten provinces, three territories, and the federal government). Note that federal legislation applies only to those employers in certain federally regulated industries such as banks, broadcasters, and airlines, to name a few. For most employers, the relevant legislation is that of the respective province or territory.

For federally regulated employers, pay equality is guaranteed under the Canadian Human Rights Act. In Ontario, pay equality is required under the Ontario Employment Standards Act. Every Canadian jurisdiction has similar legislation, although the name of the law will vary.

In contrast, &quot;pay equity&quot;, in the Canadian context, means that male-dominated occupations and female-dominated occupations of comparable value must be paid the same if within the same employer. The Canadian term &quot;pay equity&quot; is referred to as &quot;comparable worth&quot; in the US. For example, if an organization&#x27;s nurses and electricians are deemed to have jobs of equal importance, they must be paid the same. One way of distinguishing the concepts is to note that &quot;pay equality&quot; addresses the rights of women employees as individuals, whereas &quot;pay equity&quot; addresses the rights of female-dominated occupations as groups.

Certain Canadian jurisdictions have &quot;pay equity&quot; legislation while others do not, hence the necessity of distinguishing between &quot;pay equity&quot; and &quot;pay equality&quot; in Canadian usage. For example, in Ontario, &quot;pay equality&quot; is guaranteed through the Ontario Employment Standards Act while &quot;pay equity&quot; is guaranteed through the Ontario Pay Equity Act. On the other hand, the three westernmost provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan) have &quot;pay equality&quot; legislation but no &quot;pay equity&quot; legislation. Some provinces (for example, Manitoba) have legislation that requires &quot;pay equity&quot; for public sector employers but not for private sector employers; meanwhile, &quot;pay equality&quot; legislation applies to everyone.

===India===
==== Constitutional protections ====
As part of its Directive Principles of State Policy, the Constitution of India through Article 39 envisages that all states ideally direct their policy towards securing equal pay for equal work for both men and women, and also ensuring that men and women have the right to an adequate means of livelihood. While these Directive Principles are not enforceable by any court of law, they are crucial to the governance of the country and a state is duty bound to consider them while enacting laws.

While &quot;equal pay for equal work&quot; is not expressly a constitutional right, it has been read into the Constitution through the interpretation of Articles 14, 15 and 16 – which guarantee equality before the law, protection against discrimination and equality of opportunity in matters of public employment. The Supreme Court of India has also declared this to be a constitutional goal, available to every individual and capable of being attained through the enforcement of their fundamental rights set out in Articles 14 through 16. In a popular Supreme Court decision, the conditions of employment of the air-hostesses of Air India was challenged. The terms of employment required the mandatory retirement of females: (i) upon attaining the age of 33; (ii) if they were married within four years of service; or (iii) upon their first pregnancy. The court however struck down these provisions and held them to be arbitrary and discriminatory as it violated Articles 14, 15 and 16 of the Constitution.

====Statutory Protection====
In 1976, the Equal Remuneration Act was passed with the aim of providing equal remuneration to men and women workers and to prevent discrimination on the basis of gender in all matters relating to employment and employment opportunities. This legislation not only provides women with a right to demand equal pay, but any inequality with respect to recruitment processes, job training, promotions, and transfers within the organization can also be challenged under this Act. However, its scope does not extend to situations where: (i) a woman is attempting to comply with the requirements of laws giving women special treatment; and (ii) a woman is being accorded special treatment on account of the birth of a child, or the terms and conditions relating to retirement, marriage or death. Companies and individual employers can both be held accountable to maintain the standards prescribed under this Act. In various cases, the Supreme Court of India has also held that discrimination on the basis of gender only arises when men and women perform the same work or work of a similar nature. However, it clarified that a flexible approach is required to be taken while deciding which kinds of work may be similar by considering the duties actually performed as a part of the job, and not the duties potentially capable of being performed.

===Taiwan===
Taiwan legislated the Act of Gender Equality in Employment in 2002. It regulates that an employer must give the same salary to the workers who do the same work. The law prescribes that employers shall not discriminate against employees because of their gender or sexual orientation in the case of paying wages. Employees shall receive equal pay for equal work or equal value. However, if such differentials are the result of seniority systems, award and discipline systems, merit systems or other justifiable reasons of non-sexual or non-sexual-orientation factors, the above-mentioned restriction shall not apply. Employers may not adopt methods of reducing the wages of other employees in order to evade the stipulation of the preceding paragraph.

==Criticism==
Criticisms of the principle of equal pay for equal work by women include criticism of the mechanisms used to achieve it and the methodology by which the gap is measured. Some believe that government actions to correct gender pay disparity serve to interfere with the system of voluntary exchange. They argue the fundamental issue is that the employer is the owner of the job, not the government or the employee. The employer negotiates the job and pays according to performance, not according to job duties. Others contend that men are perceived to be high performers based on the same skill that a woman would have been able to do. A private business would not want to lose its best performers by compensating them less and can ill afford paying its lower performers higher because the overall productivity will decline. However, the Independent Women&#x27;s Forum cites another study that prognosticates the wage gap possibly disappearing &quot;when controlled for experience, education, and number of years on the job&quot;.

==The difference between equal pay for equal work and equal pay for work of equal value==


According to the Washington Center for Equitable Growth using data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, occupations that are more male dominated tend to be paid better regardless of skill or education level.

For example, it often requires a similar level of skill and education to be an electrician as it does to be a nurse. However, electricians, a male-dominated field, earn more than nurses, a female-dominated field. In situations where, for example, the electrician is performing their job 200 feet above the base floor of an offshore oil rig, then pay should be higher because the risks are likewise higher. However, this does not explain the gap between the average work of electricians.

A criticism to equal pay for work of equal value is the lack of proper comparation mechanisms, it is based on subjective impressions and not based on real facts and statistics. As in previous example, checking statistic data from US BLS, we can prove that it is a false statement that electricians earn more than nurses. Based on the statistics electricians earn ~1015$/weekly while nurses earn ~1223$/weekly, so in this case proving that nurses, a female dominated field, earn more than electricians, a male dominated field.

== Transparency laws ==
Transparency laws require companies to disclose wages to employees or the government. This can reduce the gender pay gap by allowing women to negotiate for equivalent pay (rather than a salary history which may reflect past discrimination) and by shaming employers into treating men and women equally. 

===United States===
A number of jurisdictions in the United States have enacted laws which require employers to furnish salary ranges per role on job advertisements.

==== Colorado ====
In 2019, Colorado&#x27;s Equal Pay for Equal Work Act was passed and signed into law, effective January 21, 2021. During its first year, as the only US state with such a law, software engineer Aaron Batilos noticed that the rising need for remote work during the COVID-19 pandemic was overwhelmingly excluding the state of Colorado. He started a website, &quot;coloradoexcluded.com&quot;, which found hundreds of companies, including Nike, Airbnb, Spotify, and PETA, were excluding Colorado from hiring to avoid posting salary ranges. In July 2022, the Colorado Department of Labor and Employment (CDLE) warning companies with a presence in Colorado that they were required to comply or face fines of $10,000 per violation. Following CDLE&#x27;s warning, the number of companies attempting to circumvent the law was drastically reduced. 

==== New York ====
In December 2020, New York City passed Int. 1208-2018, which was signed into law in January 2021. The law was originally set to take effect on May 15, 2022, but was later delayed until November 1, 2022, after pushback from businesses resulted in amendments which limited the requirement to jobs which are physically located within the city limits. A state-wide bill, Senate Bill (SB) S9427, was passed June 3, 2022, but as of September 2022, Governor Kathy Hochul had not yet signed the bill into law.

==== Washington ====
During 2021–2022, software engineer Cher Scarlett lobbied for an amendment to Washington&#x27;s Equal Pay and Opportunities Act of 2019, which previously only required employers to disclose salary ranges upon request and prohibited the practice of requesting a candidate&#x27;s salary history. SB 5761 expanded the salary range requirement to all Washington job postings, and was signed into law on March 30, 2022, effective January 1, 2023. Scarlett called on the states of New York and California to enact similar laws to end the exclusion of Colorado workers from job postings.

==== California ====
In February 2022, Senator Monique Limón introduced SB 1162. It was passed on August 30, 2022, and signed into law September 27, 2022, effective January 1, 2023. Additionally, under the 2022 amendment, employers with 100 or more employees must also submit an annual pay data report to the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing.

<text>Syndal is a Locality in the Melbourne suburbs of Glen Waverley and Mount Waverley in Victoria, Australia around the intersection of High Street Road and Blackburn Road. It is in the local government area of the City of Monash. From the intersection down to Syndal railway station on Coleman Parade, is the Syndal Shopping Centre. This strip is a highly populated commercial area encompassing a number of diverse local interest stores including several take-away food shops, a laundromat, a bridal store, a dry cleaner and many others in between.

The commercial area is renowned for many long established specialist businesses. The intersection used to have three petrol stations, three banks (the Commonwealth Bank, the State Bank of Victoria, and Westpac), and two supermarkets including Schultz&#x27;s supermarket owned and run by the Brownlow Medal winner John Schultz and his brother Robert Schultz. Today, Syndal has no banks, petrol stations, or supermarkets.

At one point in time there were five schools, three primary schools and two secondary schools, containing the name Syndal – The former schools of Syndal High School, Syndal Technical School, and Syndal Primary School, and the continuing Syndal North Primary School (now Mount Waverley North Primary School), and Syndal South Primary School.

Syndal has a nominated Australia Post postal office, although Syndal is still part of the greater Mount Waverley and Glen Waverley suburbs, and shares the same postal code as Mount Waverley, 3149, or Glen Waverley, 3150.

Syndal was originally the name of a farm owned by Redmond Barry on High Street Road, which was purchased off Barry by the Coleman family who consolidated a number of farms at the time. The name for the locality was reclaimed in 1930 when the Glen Waverley railway line was opened and the name for the station at Blackburn Road and Coleman Parade had to be decided. The centre of the Syndal locality, and the original Syndal property is on High Street Road, west of the Blackburn Road intersection.

<doc id="1108474" wikidata="Q1071907" url="?curid=1108474" title="Chicago Film Critics Association">
<text>The Chicago Film Critics Association (CFCA) is an association of professional film critics, who work in print, broadcast and online media, based in Chicago, Illinois, United States. The organization was founded in 1990 by film critics Sharon LeMaire and Sue Kiner, following the success of the first Chicago Film Critics Awards given out in 1988. The association comprises 60 members.

Since 1989, the CFCA has given out annual awards that recognize the best films in a variety of categories. These awards are noted in the established print media such as &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;. The association has also hosted the annual Chicago Critics Film Festival since 2013, which intends to bring a number of feature and short films to a larger audience.

==Membership==
The Chicago Film Critics Association restricts its membership to professional film critics, who have been employed in the media as a &quot;critical voice or staff authority&quot; on the subject of the cinema for six months. Applicants for membership in the CFCA must provide a letter signed by a producer or editor showing they have been in paid employment as a critic, as well as examples of published work. Applicants must also reside in the Chicago area. By 2004, the CFCA had just over 40 members and now comprises over 60.

Its membership includes writers for such film-related websites and print media as &quot;Ain&#x27;t It Cool News&quot;, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot;, &quot;Paste&quot;, RogerEbert.com and eFilmCritic.com.

== Chicago Film Critics Awards ==
The Chicago Film Critics Awards (also known as the Chicago Flames) have been held annually since 1988 and recognise achievement in film making and acting performances. The first awards were compiled by the CFCA&#x27;s founders and were not presented in a ceremony. In the past, winners received a glass Chicago Flame trophy, which featured an etching of the Chicago skyline created by artist Josef Puehringer. In 2019, following the death of longtime CFCA member Milos Stehlik, the organization&#x27;s Most Promising Filmmaker award was renamed in his honor to the Milos Stehlik Award for Breakthrough Filmmaker.

==20th Century Fox boycott==
In 2007, the CFCA boycotted all 20th Century Fox and Fox Searchlight films, as part of a protest over the studio&#x27;s decision to limit online critics&#x27; access to media screenings. A number of critics complained that the late media screenings affected the quality of their reviews. The CFCA&#x27;s protest garnered support from many other film critics associations, including the Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association and the San Francisco Film Critics Circle.

==Chicago Critics Film Festival==
The Chicago Critics Film Festival was founded in 2013 and is held annually. It is the only film festival in the country that is entirely programmed and produced by a film critics association. Of the decision to host a film festival, Erik Childress, the festival&#x27;s producer and CFCA board member stated, &quot;We really wanted to be a bigger part of the film discussion here in Chicago, and we wanted to bring the discussion about these films to the community. It was an idea that was floating out there until we had the means to pull it off. It&#x27;s really expanded far beyond what we expected.&quot;

The inaugural event was held from April 12–14, 2013 at the Muvico Theater in Rosemont. The festival showcased over 20 films that would have had a low distribution in a bid to expose them to a larger audience. Films shown included &quot;The Spectacular Now&quot; and &quot;The Dirties&quot;. The event also featured Q&amp;A sessions with directors William Friedkin and Sarah Polley. The second festival was expanded to a week, beginning May 9, 2014 at the Music Box Theatre.

<text>The Post Office Rifles was a unit of the British Army formed in 1868 from volunteers as part of the Volunteer Force, which later became the Territorial Force (and later the Territorial Army). The unit evolved several times until 1935, after which the name was lost during one of many reorganisations.

==History==

===Beginnings – 49th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers Corps (Post Office Rifles)===
When the Volunteer Force was formed in 1859/60 Viscount Bury raised the 21st Middlesex Rifles Volunteer Corps (Civil Service Rifles) drawing its recruits from civil servants based in London. There were sufficient recruits from the GPO staff to form a Post Office company, which was placed under Captain John Lowther du Plat Taylor&#x27;s command.

On 13 December 1867 a bomb exploded outside Middlesex House of Detention, Clerkenwell. It was an attempt to rescue two members of Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) detained there awaiting trial. The Government&#x27;s response was to raise special constables to protect London buildings against future &quot;Fenian outrages&quot;.

The GPO special constables had been supervised and trained by Major JL du Plat Taylor (and Civil Service Rifles&#x27; NCOs). After the crisis was over the GPO special constables approached du Plat Taylor to request that they be formed into a Rifle Volunteer unit. Du Plat Taylor, who was the Private Secretary to the Postmaster General, sought permission from the Postmaster General and the War Office to form such a unit. Permission was granted and on 2 March 1868 the 49th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers Corps (Post Office Rifles) was duly raised from the Post Office Companies (Civil Service Rifles) and the special constables all of whom were GPO servants. Du Plat Taylor become its first commanding officer.

In 1880 a reorganisation of the volunteer corps saw the unit renumbered as the 24th Middlesex Rifle Volunteers (Post Office Rifles).

===Service in Egypt===
In 1882 a detachment of two officers and 102 men volunteered for service in Egypt, where they performed postal and telegraph duties under the command of General Garnet Wolseley. As the Army Post Office Corps (APOC) they came under enemy fire at Kassassin in so doing became the first &#x27;volunteers&#x27; to see enemy action. The 24th Battalion was awarded their first battle honour &quot;Egypt 1882&quot;.

===South Africa===
During the Second Boer War the 24th Middlesex contributed a large number of volunteers comprising 16 officers and more than 1,000 other ranks. In 1907 they were awarded the battle honour &quot;South Africa 1899–1902&quot;.

In 1902 the 24th Middlesex (Post office) was one of six rifle corps to form the 4th or City of London Brigade, a volunteer infantry brigade.

===Territorial Force===
More changes were introduced upon the creation of the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907. This Act brought the part-time Volunteer Force infantry artillery and engineer units and Yeomanry (mounted) regiments from across the country together into a single Territorial Force in 1908. As a result of this, the 24th Middlesex became the 8th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment (Post Office Rifles).

===World War I===
The Post Office Rifles served with distinction in the Great War. They arrived in France on 18 March 1915. By the end of the war, 1,800 men from the Post Office Rifles would be dead and 4,500 more would be wounded.

After the outbreak of the war, the existing units of the Territorial Force each formed duplicate (or &quot;second line&quot;) units. The existing Post Office Rifles was redesignated as the 1/8th Battalion, London Regiment when a second Post Office Rifles battalion, the 2/8th Londons, was formed in September 1914. In 1915 a third line battalion, the 3/8th was formed.

Between them, the three battalions earned 19 battle honours.

At the Capture of Wurst Farm, in September 1917, the 2/8th lost over half its fighting strength, dead or wounded, but its men were awarded a total of 40 gallantry medals. These included a Victoria Cross won by Sergeant A. J. Knight, making him the only Post Office Rifleman to win this honour.

====Battle honours====
The battle honours awarded to the 8th (City of London) Battalion, The London Regiment (Post Office Rifles) for the &quot;Great War&quot; were announced in March 1924. Ten honours (shown in bold type) were selected by the regiment to be displayed on the King&#x27;s Colours:

*Festubert, 1915
*Loos
*Somme 1916, &#x27;18
*Flers-Courcelette
*Le Transloy
*Bullecourt
*Messines, 1917
*Ypres, 1917
*Menin Road
*Passchendaele
*Cambrai, 1917
*St. Quentin
*Bapaume, 1918
*Amiens
*Albert, 1918
*Hindenburg Line
*Épehy
*Pursuit to Mons
*France and Flanders 1915–&#x27;18

===After the Great War===
Further reorganisations took place after World War I. Many saw these changes as a dilution of the battalion&#x27;s Post Office identity. Included in these reorganisations was the amalgamation of the 8th Battalion with the non-Post Office 7th (City of London) Battalion, London Regiment in 1921, forming the 7th London Regiment (Post Office Rifles). In 1935, it was converted from infantry to the searchlight role as the 32nd (7th City of London) Anti-aircraft Battalion, Royal Engineers, and the &#x27;Post Office Rifles&#x27; name was finally dropped. In 1939 they expanded from Finsbury Square into newly built drill-halls at Grove Park and Bexleyheath. Shortly afterward the unit was split, forming a duplicate battalion at Bexleyheath called 73rd (Kent Fortress) S/Light Battalion, Royal Engineers, with outstations at Greenhithe and Sidcup. In 1940 both units re-badged as Royal Artillery.

Successor units still occupy Grove Park and Bexleyheath drill-halls, as 265 (Home Counties) Battery, 106th (Yeomanry) Regiment, Royal Artillery and 265 (Kent and County of London Yeomanry) Support Squadron, Royal Corps of Signals. Both units strive to continue and maintain the traditions and history of their predecessor regiments.

==Memorials to the Post Office Rifles==
Memorials to the Post Office Rifles can be found at Paignton War Memorial, at St. Lawrence Parish Church, Abbots Langley, and on a plaque outside the Uckfield village church. A First World War Book of Remembrance is sited in St Botolph Aldersgate EC1, the church traditionally associated with the unit, whilst a Second World War regimental memorial plaque is displayed within the Army Reserve Centre in Grove Park, London.

There is no formal memorial to the Rifles in France, but many of the fallen from the Great War have their names recorded on memorials such as the Menin Gate at Ypres and Sir Edwin Lutyens&#x27;s memorial to the missing at Thiepval. Also on the Pozieres Memorial to the missing of 1918 and notably the Arras memorial. Men of the Rifles are buried in Bedford House Cemetery outside Ypres (Ieper) in Belgium.

<text>Jon F. Merz is a U.S. author, former soldier, and ex-government employee best known for the Lawson Vampire series, the third entry of which won the 2001 National Novel Writing Month competition. He had also begun production on a television adaptation of the &quot;Lawson Vampire&quot; series through his production company &quot;New Ronin Entertainment&quot;, which was set to begin filming in Medfield, Massachusetts.

As of 2019, there has been no known progress towards the &quot;Lawson Vampire&quot; TV series. Merz’s blog has not been updated since 2016 and a &quot;Lawson Vampire&quot; book has not been published since 2015. It is unknown whether or not Merz will be continuing the Lawson series, as he has largely gone inactive on his website. However, he remains quite active on his Twitter and seems mostly focused on side projects and paperback printing of his already published Lawson novels.

Merz has also been a practitioner of Bujinkan Ninjutsu for over two decades, studying under Mark Davis in Boston, Massachusetts, and implements what he has learned from martial arts into his novels.

<text>Szczecin University of Technology () was one of the biggest universities in Szczecin, Poland.
==History==
Szczecin University of Technology was established on 1 December 1946 as School of Engineering in Szczecin (&quot;Szkoła Inżynierska w Szczecinie&quot;). Initially it included three faculties - the Faculty of Electrical Engineering (&quot;Wydział Elektryczny&quot;), the Faculty of Civil Engineering (&quot;Wydział Inżynierii Lądowej&quot;), and the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering (&quot;Wydział Mechaniczny&quot;). In the following academic year, it was expanded with the opening of the Faculty of Chemical Engineering (&quot;Wydział Chemiczny&quot;).

On 1 September 1955 the university took over the departments of the liquidated School of Economics in Szczecin (&quot;Szkoła Ekonomiczna w Szczecinie&quot;) and established the Faculty of Engineering and Economics of Transport (&quot;Wydział Inżynieryjno-Ekonomiczny Transportu&quot;). On 3 September 1955 it was transformed into the Technical University of Szczecin.

In 1985, University of Szczecin took over the Faculty of Engineering and Economics of Transport.

The university ceased to exist on 1 January 2009 when it fused with the University of Agriculture in Szczecin, creating the West Pomeranian University of Technology.

<text>The British Rail Class 317 electric multiple unit (EMU) passenger trains were constructed by British Rail Engineering Limited in two batches: 48 sets were produced in 1981–1982 and 24 sets in 1985–1987. They were the first of several classes of British Rail EMU to be based on the all-steel Mark 3 bodyshell, departing from the &quot;PEP&quot;-aluminium design which had spawned the earlier Class 313 to Class 315, Class 507 and Class 508. The Mark 3 bodyshell was also the basis of Class 318, Class 455 and the diesel Class 150. The Class 317 uses overhead alternating current electrification. All units were withdrawn in July 2022.

==Description==
===Class 317/1===
The first batch of 48 units was built in 1981–1982 and was classified as Class 317/1. Units were numbered in the range 317301–317348, and had a maximum speed of .

Each unit is composed of four vehicles: two unpowered standard-class vehicles with driver&#x27;s cabs, an intermediate trailer with both first- and standard-class seating, and an intermediate motor vehicle with second-class seating. The motor vehicle also carries the roof-mounted Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph.

The technical description of the formation of the units is DTSO(A)-MSO-TCO-DTSO(B). Individual vehicles were numbered in the following ranges:
* DTSO(A): 77000–77047
* MSO: 62661–62708
* TCO: 71577–71624
* DTSO(B): 77048–77095

Bodyshells for the TCO vehicles in this batch were constructed at Derby Litchurch Lane Works, while construction of the other bodyshells and overall assembly was carried out at the Holgate Road Carriage Works in York.

The units were built to operate services on the newly electrified London St Pancras to Bedford route and were due to replace the elderly Class 127 diesel multiple units in October 1982. However, their introduction was delayed until 28 March 1983 due to an industrial dispute with the unions over driver-only operation, and the diesel units lingered on until finally being replaced in mid-1983. Units were delivered in the standard livery of BR blue and grey.

In 1986, the route came under control of the &quot;Thameslink&quot; subsector of newly created Network SouthEast. From 1987, new dual-voltage Class 319 units were introduced on the route, allowing the creation of a new cross-London service, from Bedford to Brighton, via Farringdon and City Thameslink station. The Class 317 units were displaced to outer-suburban services on the WCML out of London Euston to Milton Keynes and Northampton. They replaced the slam-door Class 310 units, which subsequently transferred to the London, Tilbury and Southend railway.

However, the use of Class 317 units out of Euston again proved to be short-lived. In 1989, the second batch of new Class 321 were introduced onto WCML services. The Class 317 units were again displaced, this time to the &quot;Great Northern&quot; and &quot;West Anglia&quot; routes out of London King&#x27;s Cross and London Liverpool Street, where they joined the second batch units. Therefore, for the first time, the entire Class 317 fleet was operating in the same place.

===Class 317/2===

The second batch of 20 units was built in 1985–1986 and were classified as Class 317/2. Units were numbered in the range 317349–317368. A further four units were built in 1987 and numbered 317369–317372. These units have same DTSO(A)-MSO-TCO-DTSO(B) composition as Class 317/1 units, and have vehicles numbered in the following ranges:
* DTSO(A): 77200–77219 and 77280–77283
* MSO: 62846–62865 and 62886–62889
* TCO: 71734–71753 and 71762–71765
* DTSO(B): 77220–77239 and 77284–77287
All vehicles in this batch were constructed at Holgate Road Carriage Works.

The second batch units were built to operate outer-suburban trains on the &quot;Great Northern&quot; route from London King&#x27;s Cross to Stevenage, Cambridge and Peterborough. Like the first batch units, they were delivered in BR Blue/Grey livery. The units replaced the slam-door Class 312 units, dating from 1975, which subsequently transferred to the Great Eastern Main Line and London-Tilbury-Southend routes. Like the DC Class 455 units, several aspects of the exterior were modified, with metal hopper ventilators replaced with larger panes of glass and the &#x27;headcode indicator&#x27; flat front replaced with a rounded design.

In 1986, the route came under the control of the newly created Network SouthEast, which introduced a new blue, red and white livery. The extension of the overhead line equipment soon allowed the units to work services on the &quot;West Anglia&quot; route from London Liverpool Street to Cambridge. In 1992, electrification spread north from Cambridge to Ely and King&#x27;s Lynn, allowing the replacement of locomotive-hauled trains.

The closely related Class 318 units, which were built for the Ayrshire Coast electrification in Scotland, are effectively a three-car version of the same design, but with a lower speed capability of , and with traction motors provided by Brush instead of GEC.

==Operations==

With the privatisation of Britain&#x27;s railways, the Class 317 fleet was incorporated into the West Anglia Great Northern (WAGN) franchise. Since then, various changes occurred to the fleet, as units were swapped and franchises changed. The following companies operated Class 317s after privatisation.

===Greater Anglia===
The Greater Anglia franchise used 15 Class 317/5 units, 24 Class 317/6 units, six Class 317/8 units and 12 Class 317/1 units, the last of which were transferred from Great Northern in 2017. They were mainly used on medium-distance services between London Liverpool Street / Stratford and Broxbourne / Hertford East and on longer distance services between London Liverpool Street/Stratford and Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Harlow Town and Cambridge. They were also used on some Bishops Stortford/Stansted Airport - Cambridge services. These trains were used on rush hour services from Liverpool Street to Witham and Ipswich while some class 321s were being refurbished. There was one class 317/7 demonstrator unit 317722. This unit has now been withdrawn and scrapped.

The fleet of 24 Class 317/6s were all refurbished with the following enhancements:

* New carpets in first vlass cabins
* New hard wearing, &#x27;easy to clean&#x27; vinyl flooring in Standard Class accommodation
* All the seats were re-covered into new moquette trim
* Repainted grab rails
* New dado side panels and wall end coverings
After the Class 317/6 were refurbished, Greater Anglia then carried out an interior refresh to its 15 Class 317/5 trains.

During 2021, all Class 317/6 units were scrapped at Eastleigh works. Between 2019 - 2020, a few Class 317/1s units and 317/5s units were refurbished with the following enhancements:

* PRM accessible universal toilet (replacing the two passenger toilets)
* Call to aid buttons
* PRM door buttons
* Wheelchair spaces
* Improved free Wi-Fi

In addition, eight Class 317/7 units formerly operated by London Overground were brought back into use by Greater Anglia in 2020 as supplementary PRM-compliant units following the withdrawal of the 317/6 fleet.

The final scheduled Class 317 workings took place on 16 July 2022, with the last Class 317s withdrawn at the end of July 2022.

===West Anglia Great Northern, First Capital Connect &amp; Great Northern===


WAGN Railway used the Class 317 fleet on various services, including all London Liverpool Street to Cambridge services on the &quot;West Anglia&quot; route, and many stopping services to intermediate destinations. The fleet also worked services on the &quot;Great Northern&quot; route, from London King&#x27;s Cross to Cambridge, Peterborough, Hertford, Stevenage and King&#x27;s Lynn, plus at weekends when the line to Moorgate was closed, the units operated inner suburban services from London King&#x27;s Cross to Letchworth Garden City, Hertford and Welwyn Garden City.

In 1998/99, WAGN Railway started to refurbish its Class 317/2 fleet. The work was carried out by Railcare at Wolverton Works. The Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph was replaced by the industry standard Brecknell Willis high speed pantograph. Units were reclassified as Class 317/6 and were renumbered into the range 317649–672.

Many of the WAGN Class 317/1 units still wore the Network SouthEast (NSE) blue and red livery dating from 1986. In 2001, a new livery of metallic purple with lilac doors was introduced. The first unit so treated was 317 312, which had recently returned from loan to LTS Rail. The livery was progressively applied to the Class 317/1 fleet, with the final NSE examples (317 328 &amp; 317 345) disappearing by mid-2004. By April 2004, the only units not repainted were 317301–307, which were hired to Thameslink and remained in LTS livery. The WAGN purple livery was also applied to Class 313 and Class 315 EMU trains.

In April 2004, the WAGN franchise was split into the &quot;Great Northern&quot; and &quot;West Anglia&quot; routes. The latter became part of the new National Express East Anglia franchise, which operated under the title of One Railway. Great Northern was temporarily operated independently under the WAGN brand name, until it was merged with the Thameslink franchise in April 2006. These changes resulted in the Class 317 fleet being divided among First Capital Connect and National Express East Anglia.

First Capital Connect carried out a minor interior refresh to its 12 Class 317 EMU trains inherited from WAGN. Govia Thameslink Railway operated the 12 strong Class 317/1 fleet from when the new franchise began on 14 September 2014 until 21 May 2017 where they were replaced by the Class 387. These 12 Class 317 units were later transferred to Greater Anglia.

===London Overground===

On 31 May 2015, London Overground took over operation of the Liverpool Street to Chingford, Enfield Town and Cheshunt via Seven Sisters, using eight Class 317/7 units and six Class 317/8 units. All these trains had an exterior repaint, however not all were internally refurbished. They were all replaced by Class 710 &quot;Aventra&quot; in 2020.

===LTS Rail &amp; c2c===
In 1996, LTS Rail (renamed c2c in 2000) began to hire Class 317/1 units from its sister Prism Rail franchise WAGN for use on the London, Tilbury and Southend railway. At first only two units were hired, but by mid-1997 this had increased to a total of 18 units. Units were maintained at LTS Rail&#x27;s main East Ham Depot.

The Class 317 units enabled LTS Rail to replace the elderly Class 302 slam-door EMUs, the last examples of which were withdrawn in 1998. The Class 317 units also replaced some of the Class 310 fleet on off-peak workings, pending introduction of new Class 357 &quot;Electrostar&quot; units.

Many of the units hired to LTS Rail were repainted in a variation of the existing Network SouthEast blue, red and white livery. The red stripe was replaced with a green stripe, and both the blue band and green stripe extended to the cab ends.

The units were slowly returned to WAGN from 1999, with the introduction of the new &quot;Electrostar&quot; units. The last examples were returned by 2000. However, unreliability of the &quot;Electrostars&quot; meant that four units were still hired on a daily basis until 2002. These units were maintained as part of the main WAGN fleet, and therefore the specific units involved changed when units required maintenance at WAGN&#x27;s Hornsey TMD depot.

===Thameslink===
In 2002, Thameslink began hiring four Class 317/1 units from WAGN to allow it to run additional Bedford to Moorgate services. Unlike when units were hired to LTS Rail, specific units were not involved. Instead, units were still maintained by WAGN and only hired for a fortnight. Two units each week were transferred in each direction, generally being hauled over the non-electrified route by two Class 31 locomotives provided by Fragonset Railways or Class 47 locomotives with barrier vehicles at either end of the Class 317.

In 2004, when the WAGN franchise was split, twelve Class 317/1 units were transferred to Thameslink from the &quot;Great Northern&quot; route. This was because a planned route blockade for engineering works meant that extra units were required for Bedford services. The Class 317 units were replaced on Great Northern by Class 365 &quot;Networkers&quot;, themselves displaced from South Eastern Trains by new Class 375 &quot;Electrostars&quot;.

The Class 317 units transferred to Thameslink were maintained at the newly built Bedford Cauldwell depot in Bedford. They were restricted to services on the Northern half of the franchise only, as only dual-voltage or DC units can operate South of Farringdon . All units were transferred to National Express East Anglia following the end of the blockade.

===National Express East Anglia===

On 1 April 2004, the &quot;West Anglia&quot; and &quot;Stansted Express&quot; routes became part of the new One franchise.

This was operated under the brand name &#x27;one&#x27; until 26 February 2008, when it was rebranded as National Express East Anglia. During introduction, the units had one of six different liveries: the old WAGN white; a de-branded version of &#x27;one&#x27; livery (minus the rainbow car ends); the same but with a white, National Express branded, stripe; three different Stansted Express liveries and the new National Express corporate scheme, similar to that of National Express East Coast and National Express Coaches.

====Stansted Express====

In 2000, nine Class 317/1 units were selected to be refurbished for the dedicated Stansted Express service, from London Liverpool Street to Stansted Airport, replacing the previously dedicated Class 322 units. The work was again carried out by Railcare at Wolverton, and included the fitting of luggage racks and new window frames, identical to existing 317/2 units. The units also received a revised front end design, and a new metallic blue livery. The nine units were reclassified as Class 317/7, and were renumbered such that the last two digits of the set number remained unchanged. Some Class 317/7 units had their original Stone Faiveley AMBR pantograph replaced by the Brecknell Willis High Speed design.

In 2006 12 further Class 317 EMU trains were given a more basic refresh of new carpets, re-trimmed seats in new moquette and new dado side panels; by Wabtec Doncaster and the bodysides were painted in a lighter shade of blue than the Class 317/7. These units were reclassified as Class 317/8.

Both Classes 317/7 and 317/8 could occasionally be found working on West Anglia services and also it was not uncommon for Classes 317/5 and 317/6 units to work Stansted Express services alongside the dedicated Classes 317/7 and 317/8.

Following the arrivals of the new Class 379 units on Stansted Express services, the Class 317/7s and 317/8s were originally used alongside other Class 317s as a common pool. This changed when Abellio took over the East Anglia franchise on 5 February 2012, as the Class 317/7s were deemed too expensive to lease and surplus to requirements, and so they entered storage.

==Aborted proposals==
===Fitting of new traction equipment===
At the end of the National Express East Anglia franchise, Angel Trains opted to use off-lease Class 317/7 unit 317722 as a test-bed unit and engaged Bombardier Transportation to rebuild it as a pre-series unit with new traction equipment. The DC motors, traction electronics and thyristors were removed, though the original transformer remained in place. The original bogies were modified to accept new AC motors, and three-phase converters fitted. Regenerative braking was also fitted. 

At the same time, a £1million interior refurbishment was carried out on two vehicles of the same unit - driving trailer standard open 77021 and motor standard open 62682. The interiors were refurbished in a Metro style layout and provided a direct contrast to the 3+2 and 2+2 seating in use on the remainder of the unit. Trials to test the reaction of passengers commenced with Greater Anglia in mid-2014. Trials were not particularly successful, and the unit was kept at Ilford for several years before being withdrawn in early 2019.

==Accident==
*On 17 September 2015, unit 317346 collided with the buffer stops at King&#x27;s Cross at a speed of . Fourteen people were injured.

==Fleet details==
=== Named units ===

A number of units carried names these were as follows:
* 317345: &quot;Driver John Webb&quot;
* 317348: &quot;Richard A Jenner&quot;

<text>Scott Robert Mills (born 28 March 1973) is an English radio DJ, television presenter and occasional actor. He is best known for presenting the &quot;Scott Mills&quot; show on BBC Radio 1 from 2004 to 2022 and since then, on BBC Radio 2, where he has been hosting the station&#x27;s flagship breakfast show since January 2025. Mills has also been a UK commentator for the semi-finals of the Eurovision Song Contest.

==Radio==
===Early radio career===
Mills began his career at the age of 16 as a DJ on his local Hampshire commercial radio station, Power FM, after barraging the station with demo tapes. Mills was given an opportunity to present a week&#x27;s worth of shows, and based on the success of this, he was immediately offered the &#x27;graveyard slot&#x27; of 1:00 am6:00 am (six nights a week), making him the youngest permanent presenter on mainstream commercial radio. Mills later moved to the late afternoon &#x27;drive time&#x27; slot.

Mills moved from Power FM to GWR FM Bristol, staying with the station for two years, before joining Piccadilly Key 103 in Manchester, starting on the late-night slot before moving to the mid-morning show. In 1995, Mills began to work for the new London station Heart 106.2.

Mills has provided various voice-overs, including the voice of the specialist of the in-store radio station Homebase FM, the voice-over for Blockbuster Inc.&#x27;s in-store infomercial channel Blockbuster TV, and the voice-over for &quot;The VH1 Album Chart&quot; on the UK television channel VH1.

===BBC Radio 1===
Mills joined BBC Radio 1 in October 1998 to present the early breakfast show which was broadcast between 4am and 7am. In January 2004 Mills moved to a weekend afternoon slot, which was followed by a further move later that year to the weekday early-evening slot which was vacant due to Sara Cox&#x27;s maternity leave. Cox did not return and Mills became a permanent presenter of the early evening programme which was renamed &quot;The Scott Mills Show&quot;. The programme moved to an afternoon slot in April 2012 when Mills swapped presenting duties with Greg James.

Whilst at Radio 1, Mills also provided holiday cover for other presenters as well as hosting &quot;The Official Chart&quot; between June 2018 and August 2022. 

On 1 July 2022 it was announced that Mills would be leaving Radio 1 after 24 years to replace Steve Wright in &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; on BBC Radio 2. Scott Mills replaced Wright in the weekday afternoon slot on 31 October 2022.

===BBC Radio 2===
While being a regular daytime show host on BBC Radio 1, Mills hosted shows on Radio 2 as a cover presenter. 

On 20 March 2017, he hosted a late-night show from 10 pm to 2 am for Sara Cox&#x27; Dance-A-Thon. 

On 28 May 2018, he presented a Bank Holiday Monday show, &quot;Radio 2 Remix&quot;, from 4 pm until 7 pm. Immediately preceding the Radio 2 show, Mills presented from 1 pm on Radio 1, being one of the first people ending a show on Radio 1 and starting one on Radio 2 at the same day. 

In April 2019, Mills was a stand in for Rylan Clark on Radio 2&#x27;s Saturday afternoon show from 3 pm to 6 pm.

From 2021–2022, Mills was the regular stand-in for Ken Bruce.

On 1 July 2022, it was announced that Mills was to join Radio 2 permanently to replace &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; at the end of September 2022. Mills&#x27; new show, running from 2-4 pm, debuted on 31 October.

On 19 November 2024, it was announced that Mills would replace Zoe Ball as the presenter of Radio 2&#x27;s breakfast show. He presents that show as of 27 January 2025.

=== BBC Radio 5 Live ===
On 17 October 2019, it was announced that Mills and his Radio 1 co-presenter Chris Stark would start hosting a show on BBC Radio 5 Live. The show was part of the station&#x27;s new weekend line up starting on 9 November 2019. The show was broadcast between 9am and 11am. The final show was on 20 August 2022.

==&quot;Scott Mills: The Musical&quot;==
On 14 May 2009, a musical based on Mills&#x27; life was announced, to be performed at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe 2009. The musical ran for three nights between 11 and 13 August at the Pleasance One Theatre. The musical was born from an internet rumour that Mills would perform in &quot;Rick Rolling The Musical&quot; as Rick Astley and other 1980s musicians. He denied this rumour on his radio show, and listeners&#x27; suggestions to create a musical based on his life became a reality. Some songs for the musical were composed and sent in by listeners to his radio show. The musical is available for viewing on the BBC Radio 1 website.

Mills was challenged to do a one-man show at Edinburgh Fringe in 2010 by his co-hosts and production team. &quot;The Bjorn Identity&quot; was a parody of &quot;The Bourne Identity&quot;, telling the story of Jason Bjorn with the music of ABBA.

==Television work==
In addition to his radio work, he has also appeared on various television shows, playing both as a character and as himself. His main acting role was as reporter Paul Lang in the BBC medical drama &quot;Casualty&quot;, appearing in episodes in both 2006 and 2007. He also had a cameo in the BBC Scotland soap opera &quot;River City&quot; after praising the show highly on his radio show. He also appeared as a police officer in the Channel 4 soap opera &quot;Hollyoaks&quot; in 2008. 

Mills has appeared as a contestant or guest on programmes including &quot;Mastermind&quot;, &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot;, &quot;Children in Need&quot;, &quot;Most Haunted&quot; and &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, and has appeared in the show &quot;Identity&quot;, hosted by Donny Osmond.

He narrated the music TV show &quot;The Pop Years&quot; which, coincidentally, was also narrated by fellow BBC Radio 1 DJ Edith Bowman. He has presented high-profile programmes including the Wednesday night National Lottery draw on BBC One and his own pilot (featured on the radio show) of &quot;Reverse-a-Word&quot;. He has narrated &quot;Dating in the Dark&quot; on Living. In February 2008, he presented &quot;Upstaged&quot; on the newly re-launched BBC Three. He also hosted a BBC Three television show called &quot;Radio 1 on Three&quot;, inspired by his radio show.

In February 2011, Mills presented a documentary for BBC Three called &quot;The World&#x27;s Worst Place to Be Gay?&quot;.

Mills appeared on series 12 of &quot;Strictly Come Dancing&quot; and his dance partner was Joanne Clifton, sister of Kevin, who also dances on the show. They came 11th in the competition after being eliminated in week 6.

Mills won, alongside Stark, the first episode of the two-episode &quot;Robot Wars: Battle of the Stars&quot; (2016) with their robot Arena Cleaner, which was a collaboration with Dave Moulds, who drove Carbide, second place in the preceding series. This was broadcast over the Christmas and New Year period 2016.

Mills and his husband Sam competed in, and won, the second series of Celebrity Race Across The World travelling across South America.

==Other work==
In February 2011, it was announced that Mills would take part in the BT Charity Trek along with other celebrities as part of the 2011 Comic Relief Red Nose Day campaign. The celebrities spent five days in the Kaisut desert in north Kenya, covering in temperatures up to 40 °C.

On 16 and 17 November 2022, Mills raised over £1 million for Children in Need after riding on a treadmill for twenty four-hours.

==Personal life==
Mills grew up in and around Southampton, attending Shakespeare Infant School and Crestwood College Secondary School in Eastleigh. He currently lives in London.

Mills&#x27; parents are separated, although both feature in the show at sporadic intervals.

Mills came out as gay to the press in 2001 to avoid tabloid-style speculation. Occasionally on the show, deflective comments are made, and Mills often jokes that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t have much luck with the ladies&quot;. In his &quot;Guardian&quot; interview he explained, &quot;I&#x27;d just like to be accepted as a normal bloke who is gay and is on the radio and the television.&quot; Mills appeared at number 12 on the &quot;Independent on Sunday&#x27;s Pink List&quot; for 2010. Mills was the 50th most influential gay person in Britain the previous year.

He was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Arts from Southampton Solent University on 2 November 2009. The bridge that crosses the M3 at Fleet services was officially named &quot;The&quot; &quot;Scott Mills Bridge&quot; and a plaque unveiled, on 16 March 2016.

Mills supported the former climate change prevention organisation Global Cool.

In October 2021, Mills announced he had got engaged to Sam Vaughan, his boyfriend of four years. They married in Vilanova i la Geltrú, Spain in June 2024.

In November 2022, Mills&#x27; 24-hour Treadmill walking marathon with Radio 2 raised over £1.2M for Children in Need.

<text>Malcolm John Williamson (2 November 1950 – 15 September 2015) was a British mathematician and cryptographer. In 1974 he developed what is now known as Diffie–Hellman key exchange. He was then working at GCHQ and was therefore unable to publicise his research as his work was classified. Martin Hellman, who independently developed the key exchange at the same time, received credit for the discovery until Williamson&#x27;s research was declassified by the British government in 1997.

Williamson studied at Manchester Grammar School, winning first prize in the 1968 British Mathematical Olympiad. He also won a Silver prize at the 1967 International Mathematical Olympiad in Cetinje, Yugoslavia and a Gold prize at the 1968 International Mathematical Olympiad in Moscow. He read mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating in 1971. After a year at Liverpool University, he joined GCHQ, and worked there until 1982.

From 1985 to 1989 Williamson worked at Nicolet Instruments in Madison, Wisconsin where he was the primary author on two digital hearing aid patents. After that, he moved to the IDA Center for Communications Research, La Jolla, where he worked for the rest of his career.

His contributions to the invention of public-key cryptography, together with Clifford Cocks and James Ellis, have been recognized by the IEEE Milestone Award #104 in 2010 and by induction into the Cryptologic Hall of Honor in 2021.

<doc id="1108499" wikidata="Q1076192" url="?curid=1108499" title="Double wishbone suspension">
<text>A double wishbone suspension is an independent suspension design for automobiles using two (occasionally parallel) wishbone-shaped arms to locate the wheel. Each wishbone or arm has two mounting points to the chassis and one joint at the knuckle. The shock absorber and coil spring mount to the wishbones to control vertical movement. Double wishbone designs allow the engineer to carefully control the motion of the wheel throughout suspension travel, controlling such parameters as camber angle, caster angle, toe pattern, roll center height, scrub radius, scuff (mechanical abrasion), and more.

==Implementation==

The double-wishbone suspension can also be referred to as &quot;double A-arms&quot;, though the arms themselves can be A-shaped or L-shaped. A single wishbone or A-arm can also be used in various other suspension types, such as variations of the MacPherson strut. The upper arm is usually shorter to induce negative camber as the suspension jounces (rises), and often this arrangement is titled an &quot;SLA&quot; or &quot;short, long arms&quot; suspension. When the vehicle is in a turn, body roll results in positive camber gain on the lightly loaded inside wheel, while the heavily loaded outer wheel gains negative camber.

Between the outboard end of the arms is a knuckle. The knuckle contains a kingpin for horizontal radial movement in older designs, and rubber or trunnion bushings for vertical hinged movement. In newer designs, a ball joint at each end allows for all movement. Attached to the knuckle at its center is a bearing hub, or in many older designs, a spindle to which the wheel bearings are mounted.

To resist fore-aft loads such as acceleration and braking, the arms require two bushings or ball joints at the body.

At the knuckle end, single ball joints are typically used, in which case the steering loads have to be taken via a steering arm, and the wishbones look A- or L-shaped. An L-shaped arm is generally preferred on passenger vehicles because it allows a better compromise of handling and comfort to be tuned in. The bushing in line with the wheel can be kept relatively stiff to effectively handle cornering loads while the off-line joint can be softer to allow the wheel to recess under fore-aft impact loads. For a rear suspension, a pair of joints can be used at both ends of the arm, making them more H-shaped in plan view. Alternatively, a fixed-length driveshaft can perform the function of a wishbone as long as the shape of the other wishbone provides control of the upright. This arrangement has been successfully used in the Jaguar IRS. In elevation view, the suspension is a 4-bar link, and it is easy to work out the camber gain (see camber angle) and other parameters for a given set of bushing or ball-joint locations. The various bushings or ball joints do not have to be on horizontal axes, parallel to the vehicle center line. If they are set at an angle, then anti-dive and anti-squat geometry can be dialed in.

In many racing cars, the springs and dampers are relocated inside the bodywork. The suspension uses a bellcrank to transfer the forces at the knuckle end of the suspension to the internal spring and damper. This is then known as a &quot;push rod&quot; if bump travel &quot;pushes&quot; on the rod (and subsequently the rod must be joined to the bottom of the upright and angled upward). As the wheel rises, the push rod compresses the internal spring via a pivot or pivoting system. The opposite arrangement, a &quot;pull rod&quot;, will pull on the rod during bump travel, and the rod must be attached to the top of the upright, angled downward. Locating the spring and damper inboard increases the total mass of the suspension, but reduces the unsprung mass, and also allows the designer to make the suspension more aerodynamic.

===Short long arms suspension===
A short long arms suspension (SLA) is also known as an unequal-length double wishbone suspension. The upper arm is typically an A-arm and is shorter than the lower link, which is an A-arm or an L-arm, or sometimes a pair of tension/compression arms. In the latter case, the suspension can be called a multi-link, or dual-ball joint suspension.

The four-bar linkage mechanism formed by the unequal arm lengths causes a change in the camber of the vehicle as it rolls, which helps to keep the contact patch square on the ground, increasing the ultimate cornering capacity of the vehicle. It also reduces the wear on the outer edge of the tire.

SLAs can be classified as short spindle, in which the upper ball joint on the spindle is inside the wheel, or long spindle, in which the spindle tucks around the tire and the upper ball joint sits above the tire.

====Drawbacks====
Short spindle SLAs tend to require stiffer bushings at the body, as the braking and cornering forces are higher. Also, they tend to have poorer kingpin geometry, due to the difficulty of packaging the upper ball joint and the brakes inside the wheel.

Long spindle SLAs tend to have better kingpin geometry, but the proximity of the spindle to the tire restricts fitting oversized tires or snow chains. The location of the upper balljoint may have styling implications in the design of the sheet metal above it.

SLAs require some care when setting up their bump steer characteristic, as it is easy to end up with excessive, or curved, bump steer curves.

==History==
The double wishbone suspension was introduced in the 1930s. French car maker Citroën began using it in their 1934 Rosalie and Traction Avant models. Packard Motor Car Company of Detroit, Michigan, used it on the Packard One-Twenty from 1935,[1] and advertised it as a safety feature. During that time MacPherson strut was still in the area of aviation technology and was derived from aircraft landing mechanisms. Later on, in 1951, Ford Company decided to use the MacPherson strut on small production cars, the English Ford Consul and Ford Zephyr.[2] Thus, the double wishbone was applied early in automobile history and there is no genetic relationship between MacPherson strut and double wishbone suspension.

Double wishbones have traditionally been considered to have superior dynamic characteristics as well as load-handling capabilities and are therefore commonly found on sports cars and racing cars throughout automotive history . Examples of cars with double wishbone suspension include the Aston Martin DB7, the Mazda MX-5, and the third through eighth generation of the Honda Accord. Short long arms suspension, a type of double wishbone suspension, is very common on front suspensions for medium-to-large cars such as the Peugeot 407, Citroën C5, and the first two generations of the Mazda6/Atenza.

==Advantages==

The double wishbone suspension provides the engineer with more design choices than some other types do. It is fairly easy to work out the effect of moving each joint, so the kinematics of the suspension can be tuned easily and wheel motion can be optimized. It is also easy to work out the loads that different parts will be subjected to which allows more optimized lightweight parts to be designed. They also provide increasing negative camber gain all the way to full jounce travel, unlike the MacPherson strut, which provides negative camber gain only at the beginning of jounce travel and then reverses into positive camber gain at high jounce amounts.

==Disadvantages==

Double wishbone suspensions are more complex, impose more difficult packaging constraints, and are thus often more expensive than other systems like a MacPherson strut. Due to the increased number of components within the suspension setup, it takes much longer to service and is heavier than an equivalent MacPherson design. At the other end of the scale, it offers less design choice than the more costly and complex multi-link suspension system.

<text>Betty JoAnne Trimble (née Conway; born August 15, 1933), known as Bjo (, ), is an American science fiction fan and writer, initially entering fandom in the early 1950s.

== Introduction to fandom ==
Trimble&#x27;s introduction to science fiction fandom was TASFiC, the 1952 Worldcon. She was serving in the United States Navy at Naval Station Great Lakes and happened to see an announcement in &quot;Astounding Science Fiction&quot; about the upcoming convention that weekend. She met a number of other science fiction enthusiasts, including Robert Bloch, Willy Ley, and August Derleth; and claims that Harlan Ellison, &quot;this bespectacled young man who had just sold his first short story&quot;, &quot;decided he liked me and proposed on the spot.&quot; (She declined.) When it was discovered that she was an artist and cartoonist, she was recruited to contribute illustrations for science fiction fanzines. Trimble says that she met future husband John Griffin Trimble under Forrest J Ackerman&#x27;s piano, where several fans had taken refuge during a particularly crowded party. &quot;John was in the Air Force, so he and I traded Stupid Office Stories and discovered we liked each other a lot.&quot;

== Fan activities ==
Trimble helped revive a flagging Los Angeles Science Fiction Society (LASFS) in the late 1950s. In 1958, she put together the &quot;Worldcon Futuristic Fashion Show&quot; at Solacon, the 1958 16th World Science Fiction Convention. She ran once again in 1966 at Tricon, the 24th Worldcon, incidentally giving fandom a glimpse of three early &quot;Star Trek&quot; costumes. Trimble started and directed &quot;Project Art Show&quot;, the first modern convention art show, in 1960. The success of Project Art Show led to art shows becoming a profitable part of most conventions, large and small.

The Trimbles were part of the successful &quot;Save Star Trek&quot; campaign, generally credited with allowing the series to run for a third season rather than being canceled after two. They also helped with the campaign to have the first of NASA&#x27;s Space Shuttles named &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Their efforts earned them uncredited roles as a crew members in &quot;Star Trek: The Motion Picture&quot;, along with a contingent of other members of fandom who were allowed to serve as extras in full costume, portraying crew members (both human and alien) in the Recreation Deck scene (at the time, the largest number of persons ever appearing in a single &quot;Star Trek&quot; scene). Her other film credits include makeup design for &quot;Flesh Gordon&quot;; and a role as &#x27;Ma Cant,&#x27; a satirical version of Superman&#x27;s Martha Kent, in a film short called &quot;Superbman: The Other Movie&quot;. 

Trimble contributed to the first encyclopedic collection of data for &quot;Star Trek&quot;, the &quot;Star Trek Concordance&quot;, which contains cross-referenced details on every character, setting, event and device in every episode of the original &quot;Star Trek&quot;, and, in later editions of the book, its animated incarnation and the &quot;Star Trek&quot; films. The first edition of the book was self-published in 1969, followed by a supplement in 1973 and a mass-market printing in 1976 by Ballantine Books; the work was subsequently updated for a new edition published by Citadel Press in 1995. According to former &quot;Trek&quot; archivist Richard Arnold, the &quot;Concordance&quot; was used as a primary source of official canon by writers of the &quot;Star Trek&quot; Universe when he first started working at Paramount. In 1982, Trimble published a memoir of her experiences in &quot;Star Trek&quot; fandom entitled &quot;On the Good Ship Enterprise: My 15 Years with Star Trek&quot;. 

In 1974, Trimble was among the first group of winners of the Inkpot Award by Comic-Con International. Trimble received the Big Heart Award in 1964, and (in her persona of Flavia Beatrice Carmigniani) the Society for Creative Anachronism&#x27;s Order of the Laurel, an art award. Bjo and John are also both members of the SCA&#x27;s Order of the Pelican for service. (She and John were Baron and Baroness of the SCA&#x27;s Barony of the Angels [Los Angeles Chapter of the SCA] from September 2008 until January 2012.) She and John also received the International Costumers Guild&#x27;s Lifetime Achievement award. The Trimbles were celebrity guests at InterCon in Utah, 1976. Trimble was Guest of Honor at 1995&#x27;s DragonCon, the 6th North American Science Fiction Convention, as well as at many other science fiction and &quot;Star Trek&quot; conventions around the world. Bjo and John Trimble were the Fan Guests of Honor at the 60th Worldcon, ConJosé.

The Trimbles, who owned and operated the business Griffin Dyeworks &amp; Fiber Arts until 2015, lived in Southern California. In April 2024, it was announced John had died.

<text>Stowmarket ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the Mid Suffolk district of Suffolk, England, on the A14 trunk road between Bury St Edmunds to the west and Ipswich to the southeast. The town lies on the Great Eastern Main Line (GEML) between Diss and Needham Market, and lies on the River Gipping, which is joined by its tributary, the River Rat, to the south of the town.

The town takes its name from the Old English word &quot;stōw&quot; meaning &quot;principal place&quot;, and was granted a market charter in 1347 by Edward III. A bi-weekly market is still held there today on Thursday and Saturday.

The population of the town has increased from around 6,000 in 1981 to around 21,000 in 2021, with considerable further development planned for the town and surrounding villages as part of an area action plan. It is the largest town in the Mid Suffolk district and is represented in Parliament by the MP for Bury St Edmunds and Stowmarket, currently Peter Prinsley.

==Historic events==

Disaster struck Stowmarket on 11 August 1871, when an explosion at a local gun cotton factory claimed twenty-eight lives and left seventy five injured. The site of the explosion is now home to a large paint factory.

Stowmarket High School was founded in 1909.

On 8 June 1918, the first UK astronomical observation of nova V603 Aquilae was made from Stowmarket by A. Grace Cook. History repeated itself on 13 December 1934 when amateur astronomer J. P. M. Prentice discovered DQ Herculis from the town.

Just before midday on Friday 31 January 1941, a solitary German bomber plane (eyewitness accounts differ on the model) was spotted over Stowmarket firing its guns. The bomber strafed a large area of the town, before dropping bombs onto the High Street. The Stowmarket Congregational Chapel, a Gothic-style building that was built in the 19th century, was completely destroyed. There was one casualty, Mrs Rhoda Farrow, who had just returned from seeing her son Ronald and his fiancée off at the railway station.

On 17 July 2002, Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, visited Stowmarket during the Golden Jubilee Celebrations. This was the Queen&#x27;s second visit to Stowmarket, having first visited the town in July 1961. During the visit, they visited the local market, meeting stall holders before the Queen unveiled a new Town Sign and met representatives from local organisations while the Duke of Edinburgh met students who took part in The Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Award and viewed a display at the Museum of East Anglian Life.

==Landmarks==

The church of St Peter and St Mary is in the Decorated style and dates to the 14th century. The 16th-century former vicarage, now the town council offices and register office, has associations with John Milton; Milton&#x27;s Tree in its grounds is believed to be an offshoot of one of the many trees he planted there.

Haughley Park is an historical house situated in Haughley to the west of the town, of some significance, listed in the English Heritage Register. It is a large red brick country house built in about 1620 for the Sulyard family who were very prominent landowners in this area.

Opened in 1967, The Food Museum (formerly the Museum of East Anglian Life) occupies a site close to the town centre.

The Karnser is a raised pavement in Station Road West, next to the church. The name is the East Anglian dialect word &quot;caunsey&quot;, meaning a causey (causeway).

==Transport==
Stowmarket railway station, on the Great Eastern Main Line, is served by railway routes operated by Greater Anglia: to (via and ); to Ipswich (via Newmarket, Bury St Edmunds and ); and to London Liverpool Street (via , Ipswich, , and ).

In the 18th century, the River Gipping was made navigable between Stowmarket and Ipswich by a series of locks. The newly created canal was known as the Ipswich and Stowmarket Navigation.

Suffolk County Council has built a road from the Central Roundabout, a short distance to the east of Stowmarket, to Gipping Way in central Stowmarket at a cost of £21 million. The scheme was completed in summer 2010. The new road bridges the railway line and the River Gipping.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from either the Sudbury or Tacolneston transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Suffolk on 103.9 FM, Heart East on 96.4 FM and Greatest Hits Radio Ipswich &amp; Suffolk on 106.4 FM. 

The &quot;Stowmarket Mercury&quot; is the town&#x27;s local newspaper. 

==Governance==

Stowmarket Town Council is the first tier of local government for Stowmarket. Formed in 1974 from the Stowmarket Urban District Council, the Town Council serves a population of approximately 20,000 people in four wards. It is made up of 16 elected members backed up by a staff of over 30. The council is located in the historic Milton House.

<text>Vincent Brome (14 July 1910 – 16 October 2004) was an English writer, who gradually established himself as a man of letters. He is best known for a series of biographies of politicians, writers and followers of Sigmund Freud. He also wrote numerous novels, and was a dramatist.

He was born and brought up in London, and educated at Streatham Grammar School and Elleston School. He failed to enter university, and was found a job at a tea broker. He left home at 18 determined to write for a living. He took up residence in Bloomsbury, where he would live for the rest of his life.

==Early career==
Brome began his career as a journalist and magazine editor. His first short story anthology was published in 1936. Having been declared unfit for active duty, he worked for the British Ministry of Information during World War II. After the war Brome worked under Michael Young as a Labour Party researcher.

==Literary career==
Following the electoral success of the Labour Party in 1945, Brome turned his hand to biography writing. Fittingly, his first subject was the new prime minister: Clement Attlee. He received critical and commercial success with his second work, a biography of H. G. Wells, in 1950. Brome went on to chronicle the lives of Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Frank Harris, J. B. Priestley, and Havelock Ellis. Two of his literary works, &quot;The Surgeon&quot; and &quot;The Embassy&quot;, were international bestsellers. However, his works were not always treated so kindly by critics; his biography of Aneurin Bevan was particularly poorly received.

Brome was a regular at the British Library, and was a member of its advisory committee from 1975 until 1982. He was a vocal supporter of the library&#x27;s move from the British Museum to its own purpose-built building in St. Pancras, even writing numerous letters to such organs as &quot;The Times&quot; and the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; praising the move.

At the time of his death, aged 94, Brome still occupied the third story flat he had lived in for fifty years despite growing frailty and deafness. Eighteen boxes of his personal papers are held at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas at Austin.

<text>Liz Greene (born 4 September 1946) is an American-British astrologer and author. Her father was born in London, and her mother in the United States.

==Career==
Greene is one of the chief writers for astro.com, the website for her company Astrodienst.

Greene has written several astrology books based on Jungian psychology and other forms of depth psychology, contributing to an application of astrology called &quot;Psychological astrology&quot;. She relocated to the UK, then to Zürich, Switzerland to continue her work. Since 2004 she has again been living in the UK.

In 1985 Greene started co-operating with Alois Treindl, founder of Swiss-based Astrodienst, on the development of computer-generated horoscopes, which would present a person with a chart synthesis, simulating Greene&#x27;s own method of horoscope interpretation during a personal reading. Two years later, in 1987, they presented the Psychological Horoscope Analysis, which was followed by several other interpretations. Greene remains Astrodienst&#x27;s most popular author.

With Howard Sasportas, Greene co-founded the Centre for Psychological Astrology in London. After Sasportas&#x27; death in 1992, astrologer Charles Harvey took over as co-director, until his death in 2000. Greene continues directing the organisation. In addition, she also directs CPA Press, a publishing company that focuses on specialist astrological works.

Greene has been one of the most consistently popular astrologers of the 20th century. Almost all of her many books remain in print. Greene became quickly famous with the publication, by Weiser, of &quot;Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil,&quot; in 1976, in which she applied Jungian psychology to revise the image of Saturn as a planet of misfortune, recasting it in a more Jungian image that has continued to be very popular into the 21st century.

Greene wrote a historical novel in 1980, &quot;The Dreamer of the Vine&quot;, dealing with the themes of Nostradamus and Jesus bloodline. Her remaining books have been on topics applying principles of psychoanalysis to astrology (Psychological astrology). Many are transcripts of her lectures, and many are co-authored, especially with Howard Sasportas.

In addition to giving frequent lectures and directing a certificate programme in psychological astrology, Greene has continued to produce many books, all of which are now published by her own company, the CPA Press. She has also co-authored, with Juliet Sharman-Burke, a deck of tarot cards, the &quot;Mythic Tarot.&quot;

Her most influential books include &quot;Saturn: A New Look at an Old Devil,&quot; and the philosophically-inclined &quot;The Astrology of Fate.&quot; &quot;The Outer Planets &amp; Their Cycles,&quot; &quot;The Luminaries&quot; (with H. Sasportas) and &quot;The Dark of the Soul&quot; are other examples of her work.

In April 2010 the History Department of the University of Bristol, UK, granted her a doctorate degree for her thesis &#x27;The Kabbalah in British Occultism 1860-1940&#x27;.

<doc id="1108513" wikidata="Q1879237" url="?curid=1108513" title="Trailing-arm suspension">
<text>A trailing-arm suspension, also referred to as trailing-link, is a form of vehicle suspension. In a motor vehicle it places one or more horizontal arms (or &quot;links&quot;) perpendicular to and forward of the axle on the chassis or unibody, which are connected to the axle or wheels with pivot joint(s). These are typically used on the rear axle or wheels of vehicles, but also found in both front and main landing gear of aircraft. 

A &quot;semi trailing-arm&quot; (or semi trailing-link) is a common form of independent rear suspension on automobiles, particularly those with front wheel drive (where it allows a flatter rear floor pan).
Leading arms are similar horizontal arms, perpendicular to the axle, but connecting the wheels to the vehicle structure via pivot joints &quot;to the rear&quot; of them. These are typically used on the front axle or wheels, as on the Citroën 2CV and its derivatives, and on the Citroën DS, as well as on the M422 Mighty Mite jeep.

== Types ==
=== Trailing-arm ===
Trailing-arm designs in live axle setups often use just two or three links and a Panhard rod to locate the wheel laterally. A trailing arm design can also be used in an independent suspension arrangement. Each wheel hub is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at one point, ahead of the wheel. Seen from the side, this arm is roughly parallel to the ground, with the angle changing based on road irregularities. A twist-beam rear suspension is very similar except that the arms are connected by a beam, used to locate the wheels and which twists and has an anti-roll effect.

Some aircraft also use trailing arms in their landing gear, with oleo struts for shock absorption. A trailing arm landing gear results in smoother landings and a better ride when taxiing compared to other types of landing gear.

=== Semi-trailing arm ===
A semi-trailing arm suspension is a supple independent rear suspension system for automobiles where each wheel hub is located only by a large, roughly triangular arm that pivots at two points. Viewed from the top, the line formed by the two pivots is somewhere between parallel and perpendicular to the car&#x27;s longitudinal axis; it is generally parallel to the ground. Trailing-arm and multilink suspension designs are much more commonly used for the rear wheels of a vehicle where they can allow for a flatter floor and more cargo room. Many small, front-wheel drive vehicles feature a MacPherson strut front suspension and trailing-arm rear axle.

<text>Thomas Washington (6 June 1865 – 15 December 1954) was an admiral in the United States Navy during World War I.

==Early life and career==
Thomas Washington and his brother Richard were twins of Virginia and her farmer husband R.A. Washington, both born at Goldsboro, North Carolina. On May 17, 1883, Thomas Washington accepted an appointment to the United States Naval Academy. He traveled to Annapolis, Maryland, and graduated on 10 June 1887. After the required two years of sea duty during which he served on the European Station in the sloops and , he was commissioned ensign in 1889. Over the ensuing three years, he briefly served aboard the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey ship &quot;Endeavor&quot;, followed by a tour in the gunboat to the Far East. He was assigned to the office of the Navy&#x27;s Judge Advocate General in 1892.

Subsequently, after duty on several trial boards for general courts martial at the Norfolk and Washington Navy Yards, he was assigned to a succession of ships—, and —before joining the battleship in early 1898. He was on this ship when she helped to defeat the Spanish Fleet under Admiral Cervera on 3 July 1898 in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. His younger brother and naval cadet, Pope Washington, was one of the survivors of the explosion of the &quot;Maine&quot;.

After a second tour of duty ashore in the office of the Judge Advocate General, Washington served on the General Board. Ordered thence to the Asiatic Station, he joined the staff of Rear Admiral Robley D. &quot;Fighting Bob&quot; Evans, the Commander-in-Chief, Asiatic Fleet, on 29 October 1902. Quartered on the battleship , the Asiatic Fleet&#x27;s flagship, he remained on Evans&#x27; staff until detached on 1 June 1904.

Special duty at the Bureau of Navigation followed his return from the Orient and preceded his assuming command of dispatch boat , the vessel which was then serving as the Secretary of the Navy&#x27;s yacht. Washington next put in another tour with the Bureau of Navigation for duty before returning to sea in 1912 to command, in turn, the gunboat and cruisers and over the next two years.

==World War I==
On 20 April 1914, Washington—by then a captain—assumed the duties of Hydrographer of the Navy. World War I broke out in Europe less than four months after Washington assumed the Hydrographer&#x27;s duties, depriving the United States of its external sources of oceanographic and hydrographic information. Washington and his small staff responded by independently gathering the necessary data for use by the United States Navy and Merchant Marine.

Relieved as hydrographer on 23 June 1916, Washington was given command of the battleship . A few months after the United States entered the war in the spring of 1917, &quot;Florida&quot; crossed the Atlantic with Battleship Division Nine to operate with the British Grand Fleet. The manner in which he carried out this assignment won Washington the Distinguished Service Medal for &quot;exceptionally meritorious service in a duty of great responsibility.&quot;

==Post-war service==
On 22 November 1918, eleven days after the Armistice, he assumed command of Flagship Division 3, Battleship Force 1, Atlantic Fleet, flying his &quot;flag&quot; alternately in yachts and . He subsequently commanded Divisions 2 and 4, successively, of the Atlantic Fleet. Detached from this duty on 9 August, he assumed the post of Chief of the Bureau of Navigation on 11 August, with the accompanying rank of rear admiral.

Less than a year later, Washington received orders to duty as Commander-in-Chief, Asiatic Fleet (CINCAF). He broke his flag in armored cruiser on 11 October 1923 and commanded the Fleet until 14 October 1925. During his tour, the Asiatic Fleet provided support for the United States Army&#x27;s round-the-world flight in the spring of 1924. Operating from the Kurils to Calcutta, the destroyer squadrons of the Fleet sailed on plane-guard stations, transported supplies and spare parts, and provided radio bearings and communications services for the planes, and thus contributed greatly to the success of the flight.

Relieved as CINCAF on 14 October 1925, Washington became Commandant of the Naval Operating Base, San Francisco, California, on 19 November 1925, and filled the billet until his retirement on 6 June 1929.

==Last years and legacy==
In the 1930s Washington was the Governor of the Philadelphia Naval Home. Advanced on the retired list to the full rank of admiral on 16 July 1942, Washington died at the Bethesda Naval Hospital, Bethesda, Maryland on December 15, 1954.

He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery in Arlington, Virginia.

==History==
Co-founded by John McLaughlin and Randall Cooper, the first BayCon in its current existence as &quot;The San Francisco Bay Area Regional Science Fiction and Fantasy Convention&quot; was held over Thanksgiving weekend in 1982. BayCon &#x27;83 was also held over Thanksgiving weekend. To avoid conflicts with Southern California&#x27;s annual regional convention, Loscon, BayCon moved to Memorial Day weekend, skipping Thanksgiving in 1984. For most of its history, it was held at the Doubletree Hotel in San Jose (formerly the Red Lion). In 2007, it was held at the San Mateo Marriott Hotel. Beginning in 2008, and through 2015, BayCon was held at the Hyatt Regency Santa Clara and Santa Clara Convention Center in Santa Clara, California.

<text>Marquette Airlines was a brief-lived trunk air carrier, a United States scheduled airline that operated between St. Louis to Detroit from 1938 to 1940 before merging into Transcontinental &amp; Western Air (TWA).

==History==
Marquette was founded in 1938 by Winston Weidner &quot;Wink&quot; Kratz, a 33-year-old pilot. It began scheduled service on the St. Louis - Cincinnati - Dayton - Toledo - Detroit route on May 14, 1938, with service four days a week, which soon expanded to six days a week, using Stinson Model A tri-motor aircraft. Marquette&#x27;s line connected with the coast-to-coast route of TWA at St. Louis and Dayton. TWA saw the airline as a potential competitor and opposed Marquette&#x27;s application for an operating certificate. However, the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) certificated Marquette on July 18, 1939 under the grandfather statute (the CAA certificated airlines that could show a bona fide history of operation before the date of the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 that created the CAA).

TWA agreed to acquire Marquette in October 1939, subject to CAA approval. But between then and July 3, 1940, when the acquisition was denied, the airline regulatory functions of the CAA had become the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), which said, regarding TWA&#x27;s application to purchase Marquette for , that &quot;it would be clearly adverse to the public interest&quot; for Marquette&#x27;s operating certificate &quot;to be treated as if it were a speculative security.&quot; The CAB approved the acquisition December 18, 1940 for two reasons:
* Reduced purchase price
* TWA demonstrated that the route would be more valuable to itself than to Marquette by leasing the route from Marquette as of August 15, 1940. Ridership jumped dramatically, which allowed to the CAB to attribute the purchase price to something other than just the speculative value of the Marquette certificate

TWA operation of the route allowed TWA to serve Cincinnati and Detroit for the first time, and offer service from Cincinnati to Pittsburgh and New York. TWA replaced Marquette&#x27;s Stinson trimotors with newer Douglas DC-2s. The CAB announced on October 18, 1941, that TWA could formally acquire Marquette, by which time the airlines were merged in all but name.

Tata Sons Ltd., the predecessor of Air India, acquired five of Marquette&#x27;s Stinson aircraft in 1941 following the requisition of its larger aircraft for war purposes.

<text>Onich (; Gaelic: &quot;Omhanaich&quot;, &#x27;abounding in froth, frothy place&#x27;), also spelled Ounich, is a village in the historic county of Inverness-shire on the east shore of Loch Linnhe, Scotland and, together with North Ballachulish at the entrance to Loch Leven, forms Nether Lochaber.

==Area==
St Bride’s Church was built in 1874 by the Edinburgh architect John Garden Brown. Onich to North Ballachulish Woods forms a Special Area of Conservation because of its old sessile oak woods with &quot;Ilex&quot; and &quot;Blechnum&quot;.

==Climate==
As with much of the British Isles, Onich experiences a maritime climate with cool summers and mild winters. Rainfall is high, approaching an annual average of . Onich holds the record for highest temperature reported, , for this part of Scotland (also the furthest north such a high value has been recorded in the British Isles). It also holds the highest Scottish minimum temperature for July at 20.0.C set in July 1948.

<doc id="1108546" wikidata="Q280946" url="?curid=1108546" title="Packet over SONET/SDH">
<text>Packet over SONET/SDH, abbreviated POS, is a communications protocol for transmitting packets in the form of the Point to Point Protocol (PPP) over SDH or SONET, which are both standard protocols for communicating digital information using lasers or light emitting diodes (LEDs) over optical fibre at high line rates. POS is defined by RFC 2615 as PPP over SONET/SDH. PPP is the Point to Point Protocol that was designed as a standard method of communicating over point-to-point links. Since SONET/SDH uses point-to-point circuits, PPP is well suited for use over these links. Scrambling is performed during insertion of the PPP packets into the SONET/SDH frame to solve various security attacks including denial-of-service attacks and the imitation of SONET/SDH alarms. This modification was justified as cost-effective because the scrambling algorithm was already used by the standard used to transport ATM cells over SONET/SDH. However, scrambling can optionally be disabled to allow a node to be compatible with another node that uses the now obsoleted RFC 1619 version of Packet over SONET/SDH which lacks the scrambler.

==Applications of POS==
The most important application of POS is to support sending of IP packets across wide area networks. Large amounts of traffic on the Internet are carried over POS links. 
POS is also one of the link layers used by the Resilient Packet Ring standard known as IEEE 802.17.

==History of POS==
Cisco was involved in making POS an important wide area network protocol. PMC-Sierra produced an important series of early semiconductor devices which
implemented POS.

==Details about the name &quot;POS&quot;==
POS (packet over SONET) is a double-nested abbreviation. The S represents &quot;SONET/SDH&quot;, which itself stands for &quot;Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy&quot;.
Given this information, POS technically stands for &quot;Packet over Synchronous Optical Network/Synchronous Digital Hierarchy&quot;.

==Complementary Interfaces==
The System Packet Interface series of standards from the Optical Internetworking Forum including SPI-4.2 and SPI-3 and their predecessors PL-4 and PL-3 are commonly used as the interface between packet processing devices and framer devices that implement POS. The acronym PL-4 means POS-PHY Layer 4.

<text>North Carroll High School was a public high school located in Hampstead, Maryland, United States, in Carroll County.

The North Carroll High School building is located at 1400 Panther Drive. The school was one of three county schools that were closed in 2016 due to declining enrollment. The school mascot was a panther, and the school colors were red, white, and black. The school was a part of the Carroll County Public Schools system. The principal was Thomas Clowes.

==History==
In September 1956, Manchester High School and Hampstead High School were consolidated into a new school, to be called North Carroll High School, in Greenmount. The school had 437 students and 20 faculty, and its first graduating class had 79 students. At that time, the school colors were red and gray.

It has been accredited by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools since 1960.

In 1962, the school had its name changed to &quot;North Carroll Junior-Senior High School&quot;, due to the addition of 7th and 8th grade classes, for whom an additional facility was constructed.

Further expansion in the 1970s led to the construction of another new building in the current location near Hampstead, Maryland. 860 high school students and 45 staff members to the new building, the opening of which coincided with the name returning to North Carroll High School. This was also when the current school colors were established.

In 1985 an agriculture classroom and shop were added and the greenhouse relocated. In 2007 the shop closed and was replaced with an attendance room.

North Carroll High School celebrated its 50th anniversary during the 2006–2007 school year. Currently, North Carroll High School&#x27;s student body has exceeded 1,800 students.

The student body of the school was recently split in the 2009-2010 school year with the opening of Manchester Valley High School in Manchester, Maryland. This split was due to over-population in the school. About 5-10 new portables were added to the school&#x27;s campus to fit all the students into classes. The Board of Education had drawn out new boundaries for the school. They split the line between Manchester, a surrounding town, and Hampstead. The population of both these towns used to attend North Carroll High School and even a few from a third town called Finksburg. This was the cause of the continuous rise of population in the school. All Freshman, Sophomore, and Junior students living in Manchester were sent to the new high school. The Senior class of 2010 was allowed to stay at North Carroll High School.

In 2015, it was rumored that the school would be closed at the end of the 2015-2016 school year. However, Governor Larry Hogan allocated money to postpone the closure due to public disapproval of the closing.

On December 9, 2015 despite the public disapproval of the closing and offer of money from Governor Larry Hogan the Carroll County School Board voted to close the school.

==Events==

The school had an annual homecoming for the students and alumni. Usually taking place in October there was a football game set up against an opposing team taking place on a Friday night. The next day there was a homecoming dance for all students and one date/guest of their choice to attend. The dance took place in the main gym with surrounding decorations and a hired DJ. Appropriate attire must be worn at all times.

Other dances include Winter Formal, Spring Fling, Bay Lady, and Prom. Bay Lady is restricted to seniors and takes place on a boat with dinner and dancing. Prom is for Juniors and Seniors only and is typically planned by the Senior Class.

Other activities the school has offered are Mr./Mrs. North Carroll (a talent show in which students participate), North Carroll Idol (a take-off of American Idol), Flag Football Tournament, Senior Class Trip, Senior Class Picnic, Powder Puff Tournament (where the Junior girls play the Senior girls in flag football and the boys of the two classes are the cheerleaders), and many more.

<doc id="1108556" wikidata="Q2293467" url="?curid=1108556" title="Skyway Airlines">
<text>Skyway Airlines was an American ramp and aircraft ground handling services and catering company based in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Until April 5, 2008, it operated as a regional airline and banner carrier exclusively for Midwest Express Airlines (which subsequently changed its name to Midwest Airlines) under the business name Midwest Connect (previously Midwest Express Connection), feeding Midwest&#x27;s hub at General Mitchell International Airport with twelve 32-seat Fairchild-Dornier 328JET regional jet aircraft, and four 19-seat Beechcraft 1900 commuter turboprops. Skyway Airlines, along with its parent corporation, Midwest Air Group, has since ceased operations.

==History==

Skyway Airlines, operating as the Midwest Express Connection, began flight operations on April 17, 1989.

Skyway began operations as a division of Phoenix, Arizona-based Mesa Air Group. Mesa&#x27;s Skyway Airlines division operated Beechcraft 1900C 19-passenger airliners, providing regional airline feed to Midwest Express Airlines in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and Rockford, Illinois.

In 1994, Midwest Express established Astral Aviation, Inc., as a wholly owned subsidiary to take over the operation of Skyway Airlines. The Beech 1900C aircraft were replaced with 15 brand-new Beech 1900D aircraft. The first flight took place from Milwaukee to Flint, Michigan, on February 15, 1994. Skyway grew to connect Milwaukee with communities in Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Iowa, Indiana, Ohio, Nebraska, Missouri, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

In 1999, Skyway became the world launch customer for the Fairchild Dornier 328JET aircraft, a 32-seat jet. It ultimately acquired 12 328JETs. The 328JETs allowed Skyway to provide new service to cities as far as Hartford, New York City, Washington, D.C., and Raleigh-Durham, and to provide more comfortable passenger accommodations on routes previously served by the Beechcraft 1900. Skyway planned to transition to an all-jet fleet by obtaining additional 328JET aircraft, purchasing German manufacturer Fairchild Dornier&#x27;s planned 44-seat version, known as the 428JET, and phasing out the Beechcraft 1900.

While the September 11 attacks severely impacted all U.S. airlines, other events brought about the end of Skyway Airlines. Skyway&#x27;s plans to continue modernizing its fleet with additional Dornier aircraft unwound when Dornier failed, and parent company Midwest Air Group&#x27;s financial problems caused it to end Skyway&#x27;s flight operations.

In 2002, Dornier, an aviation pioneer dating back to the 1930s, became insolvent. Production of the 328JET stopped. This interrupted Skyway&#x27;s plans to further expand its jet fleet and replace the Beechcraft 1900. AvCraft Aviation, a Virginia-based parts supplier for the 328 turboprop and the 328JET, purchased the production rights for the 328JET from Fairchild Dornier&#x27;s receivers, and planned to re-establish production of the type. Then AvCraft went bankrupt. This made further growth of the 328JET fleet effectively impossible.

The other regional jets built by Canadair and Embraer had substantial order backlogs, and the training, maintenance and inventory costs of running a small airline with three different aircraft types made another jet purchase financially impractical. Without having an available replacement aircraft, Skyway began to draw down its Beechcraft 1900 fleet, planning to eventually eliminate that fleet.

In March, 2003, Midwest Express Airlines reincorporated and changed its name to Midwest Airlines. Astral Aviation, Inc., d/b/a Skyway Airlines also reincorporated and changed its name, to Skyway Airlines, Inc., d/b/a Midwest Connect. New logos were designed for both airlines&#x27; aircraft and uniforms, and the connection between Midwest Airlines and Midwest Connect was made more obvious for marketing purposes.

In 2006, Midwest Airlines announced that it would obtain additional regional feed from SkyWest Airlines, an independently owned airline based in St. George, Utah which operated Canadair regional jets. The SkyWest aircraft would also bear the name &quot;Midwest Connect.&quot; Midwest announced that it would operate the SkyWest and Skyway operations side by side.

In 2006 and 2007, Midwest Air Group also fought off a hostile takeover attempt by rival airline AirTran Airways. Midwest Air Group&#x27;s leadership persuaded Northwest Airlines and private equity firm TPG Capital to enter the bidding as a white knight. Northwest and TPG purchased Midwest Air Group, with 47% and 53% ownership stakes, respectively.

Following the Northwest Airlines/TPG purchase, Midwest announced on January 16, 2008, that it would terminate all Skyway Airlines flight operations and transfer the remaining Midwest Connect flying to SkyWest. Midwest also discussed a potential contract with Great Lakes Airlines to provide code-share feed to the Essential Air Service cities they would serve from Milwaukee. The Skyway subsidiary would remain as a ramp services and catering company for Midwest Airlines and for certain (SkyWest) Midwest Connect operations.

Skyway&#x27;s last day of flight operations was April 5, 2008. On the last day of flight operations, Skyway Airlines operated 12 328JETs and 4 Beechcraft 1900D aircraft. The last 328JET flight operated from Indianapolis to Milwaukee. The last Beech flight operated a round-robin from Milwaukee to Muskegon and Manistee, Michigan, and back to Milwaukee.

Midwest, already in a financially weakened condition following the September 11, 2001 attacks and the aforementioned takeover battle, suffered another severe financial blow as a result of the 2008 fuel price spike. Midwest&#x27;s fleet of MD-80 airliners had been well suited to its markets and Midwest&#x27;s high-service business model during the 1990s, but by 2008 it was no longer fuel efficient as compared with newer aircraft designs. Midwest terminated the leases on those aircraft and returned them to their lessors. Shortly thereafter, as the result of a failed lease renegotiation with Boeing, Midwest also lost the leases on 16 of its 25 newer Boeing 717 aircraft, leaving the airline with only 9 of the 38 aircraft with which it had started the year.

On September 3, 2008, Skyway&#x27;s parent Midwest Airlines announced an agreement to transfer most of its mainline flight operations to another independent regional airline, Republic Airways. Republic agreed to operate 12 76-seat Embraer 170 jets under the Midwest Connect name and provide Midwest $20 million in financing. As a result, Midwest furloughed 269 of its 399 pilots and total employee cuts for the year were approximately 1,850.

On February 2, 2009, Midwest Air Group CEO Tim Hoeksema announced in an internal corporate memorandum that all remaining Skyway functions will be assumed by Midwest Airlines, and that Skyway will cease to exist as a separate entity. No end date for Skyway operations had been announced. It remains unclear if Skyway had been fully integrated into Midwest prior to Republic Airways&#x27; acquisition of Midwest from TPG.

==Destinations==
At the end of flight operations, Skyway Airlines flew to 19 destinations in Canada and the United States. The airline&#x27;s hub was at Milwaukee&#x27;s General Mitchell International Airport. Most destinations were taken over by SkyWest on April 6, 2008. The remaining few (part of the Essential Air Service program) saw a termination of service.

Historically, approximately 60 markets were served at one time by Skyway Airlines. Most destinations were served nonstop from Milwaukee; however, some point-to-point services were also operated. Many of these were served in the era when Mesa Airlines operated Skyway, choosing to focus resources outside of the Midwest Express hub in Milwaukee.

<text>The Estádio do Bessa (now &quot;Estádio do Bessa Sec. XXI&quot;) is a football stadium located in the Boavista area of Porto, Portugal, used by Boavista FC

Like other stadiums used in Euro 2004, the Bessa is a new ground but built on top of the old stands, with each new stand being constructed at different times, which allowed Boavista F.C. to continue playing there during the project. The former Campo do Bessa existed on the same place as the new stadium since 1911.

It cost €45,164,726 to build, from which €7,785,735 was supported from the Portuguese state, and has an all-seater capacity of 28,263. Plans for improvement existed before the organization of the Euro 2004 was given to Portugal in 1999, and by then the first works were already underway. It was designed by Grupo3 Arquitectura.

<doc id="1108583" wikidata="Q2914601" url="?curid=1108583" title="Bonken">
<text>Bonken is a Dutch trick-taking card game for 4 players that is played with a standard pack of cards. Everyone plays for themselves. It is a compendium game of 11 rounds, each of which has its own goal. The aim of the game is to score as few penalty points as possible. The player who scores the fewest points is declared the winner.

==Object==
Bonken is fundamentally a trick-taking game with the exception of the Domino contract. A trick is taken by the player who played the highest card of the led suit or, if applicable, the one who played the highest trump. The card rankings are as usual, the Ace being high and 2 low. Players are obliged to follow suit if able to do so. If there are trumps, a player is allowed (not required) to play a trump if he cannot follow suit.

== Deal ==
One of the players starts as dealer and shuffles the deck. After this, he deals every player 13 cards. The cards are dealt clockwise. The player who sits across the table from the dealer can choose which of the rounds is played. He is not allowed to choose a round that has already been played. The player to the right of the dealer starts doubling. After the descriptions of the rounds is the explanation of doubling. The player on the left of the dealer plays the leading card. After the first trick the player who took that trick plays the next leading card. After each round the cards are shuffled and dealt by the player to the left of the previous dealer. 
As noted before, each of the rounds has its own goal.

== Rounds ==
The game is played over eleven rounds, the final four being the same:
#Ducking (&quot;Bukken&quot;): the goal is to take the fewest tricks possible. There are no trumps. Each trick taken by a player scores -5 points.
#No Hearts (&quot;Hartenjagen&quot;): the aim is to avoid capturing hearts in any tricks taken. There are no trumps. A player may not lead with hearts unless he cannot do otherwise. Every heart taken scores -5 points.
#No Men (&quot;Herenboeren&quot;): the goal is to avoid capturing Kings and Jacks in any tricks taken. There are no trumps. Each King captured scores -20 points and each Jack scores -10 points.
#No Queens (&quot;Vrouwen&quot;): the goal is to avoid capturing Queens in any tricks. There are no trumps. Each Queen captured scores -30 points.
#No King of Hearts (&quot;Hartenheer&quot;): there are no trumps. Players may not lead with hearts unless they cannot do otherwise. The player who captures the King of Hearts scores -50 points.
#No Last (&quot;Laatste slag&quot;): there are no trumps. The player who takes the last trick scores -50 points.
#Domino (&quot;Domino&quot;): cards are laid to the table. When on lead, a player must lay either and Eight or a card one rank higher or lower than a table card (e.g. a 6 of diamonds may be laid off against a 7 of diamonds, but not the 7 of spades or 8 of diamonds). Players may only pass if unable to do either. The player who is last out scores -50 points.
#Trumps (&quot;Troeven&quot;): every player is allowed to choose trumps for the round once. The player may choose what a trump suit is or to play with no trumps. A player may not choose a suit that has already been chosen. Each trick won scores 10 points. Note that only 4 out of 5 options are played.
#Trumps: as round 8
#Trumps: as round 8
#Trumps: as round 8

== Doubling ==
Before the chosen round is played all players have the opportunity to double. The player to the right of the dealer may begin doubling. If a player doubles another, the difference in point obtained in that round will be added to his point total and subtracted from the other players total. If a player doubles a player and that player doubles back, the difference is accounted twice.

The person who chose the round can only double back, that is, he cannot double players who haven&#x27;t doubled him.

If the points are divided correctly, the sum of the final scores of all four player will be 0, even if players have doubled during the game.

<doc id="1108598" wikidata="Q1465895" url="?curid=1108598" title="PAQ">
<text>PAQ is a series of lossless data compression archivers that have gone through collaborative development to top rankings on several benchmarks measuring compression ratio (although at the expense of speed and memory usage). Specialized versions of PAQ have won the Hutter Prize and the Calgary Challenge. PAQ is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License.

==Algorithm==
PAQ uses a context mixing algorithm. Context mixing is related to prediction by partial matching (PPM) in that the compressor is divided into a predictor and an arithmetic coder, but differs in that the next-symbol prediction is computed using a weighted combination of probability estimates from a large number of models conditioned on different contexts. Unlike PPM, a context doesn&#x27;t need to be contiguous. Most PAQ versions collect next-symbol statistics for the following contexts:
* &quot;n&quot;-grams; the context is the last bytes before the predicted symbol (as in PPM);
* whole-word &quot;n&quot;-grams, ignoring case and nonalphabetic characters (useful in text files);
* &quot;sparse&quot; contexts, for example, the second and fourth bytes preceding the predicted symbol (useful in some binary formats);
* &quot;analog&quot; contexts, consisting of the high-order bits of previous 8- or 16-bit words (useful for multimedia files);
* two-dimensional contexts (useful for images, tables, and spreadsheets); the row length is determined by finding the stride length of repeating byte patterns;
* specialized models, such as x86 executables, BMP, TIFF, or JPEG images; these models are active only when the particular file type is detected.

All PAQ versions predict and compress one bit at a time, but differ in the details of the models and how the predictions are combined and postprocessed. Once the next-bit probability is determined, it is encoded by arithmetic coding. There are three methods for combining predictions, depending on the version:
* In PAQ1 through PAQ3, each prediction is represented as a pair of bit counts formula_1. These counts are combined by weighted summation, with greater weights given to longer contexts.
* In PAQ4 through PAQ6, the predictions are combined as before, but the weights assigned to each model are adjusted to favor the more accurate models.
* In PAQ7 and later, each model outputs a probability rather than a pair of counts. The probabilities are combined using an artificial neural network.

PAQ1SSE and later versions postprocess the prediction using secondary symbol estimation (SSE). The combined prediction and a small context are used to look up a new prediction in a table. After the bit is encoded, the table entry is adjusted to reduce the prediction error. SSE stages can be pipelined with different contexts or computed in parallel with the outputs averaged.

===Arithmetic coding===

A string &quot;s&quot; is compressed to the shortest byte string representing a base-256 big-endian number &quot;x&quot; in the range [0, 1] such that P(&quot;r&quot; &lt; &quot;s&quot;) ≤ &quot;x&quot; &lt; P(&quot;r&quot; ≤ &quot;s&quot;), where P(&quot;r&quot; &lt; &quot;s&quot;) is the probability that a random string &quot;r&quot; with the same length as &quot;s&quot; will be lexicographically less than &quot;s&quot;. It is always possible to find an &quot;x&quot; such that the length of &quot;x&quot; is at most one byte longer than the Shannon limit, −log2P(&quot;r&quot; = &quot;s&quot;) bits. The length of &quot;s&quot; is stored in the archive header.

The arithmetic coder in PAQ is implemented by maintaining for each prediction a lower and upper bound on &quot;x&quot;, initially [0, 1]. After each prediction, the current range is split into two parts in proportion to P(0) and P(1), the probability that the next bit of &quot;s&quot; will be a 0 or 1 respectively, given the previous bits of &quot;s&quot;. The next bit is then encoded by selecting the corresponding subrange to be the new range.

The number &quot;x&quot; is decompressed back to string &quot;s&quot; by making an identical series of bit predictions (since the previous bits of &quot;s&quot; are known). The range is split as with compression. The portion containing &quot;x&quot; becomes the new range, and the corresponding bit is appended to &quot;s&quot;.

In PAQ, the lower and upper bounds of the range are represented in three parts. The most significant base-256 digits are identical, so they can be written as the leading bytes of &quot;x&quot;. The next 4 bytes are kept in memory, such that the leading byte is different. The trailing bits are assumed to be all zeros for the lower bound and all ones for the upper bound. Compression is terminated by writing one more byte from the lower bound.

===Adaptive model weighting===

In PAQ versions through PAQ6, each model maps a set of distinct contexts to a pair of counts, formula_2, a count of zero bits, and formula_3, a count of 1 bits. In order to favor recent history, half of the count over 2 is discarded when the opposite bit is observed. For example, if the current state associated with a context is formula_4 and a 1 is observed, then the counts are updated to (7, 4).

A bit is arithmetically coded with space proportional to its probability, either P(1) or P(0) = 1 − P(1). The probabilities are computed by weighted addition of the 0 and 1 counts:
* &quot;S&quot;0 = Σ&quot;i&quot; &quot;wi&quot; &quot;n&quot;0&quot;i&quot;,
* &quot;S&quot;1 = Σ&quot;i&quot; &quot;wi&quot; &quot;n&quot;1&quot;i&quot;,
* &quot;S&quot; = &quot;S&quot;0 + &quot;S&quot;1,
* P(0) = &quot;S&quot;0 / &quot;S&quot;,
* P(1) = &quot;S&quot;1 / &quot;S&quot;,
where &quot;wi&quot; is the weight of the &quot;i&quot;-th model. Through PAQ3, the weights were fixed and set in an ad-hoc manner. (Order-&quot;n&quot; contexts had a weight of &quot;n&quot;2.) Beginning with PAQ4, the weights were adjusted adaptively in the direction that would reduce future errors in the same context set. If the bit to be coded is &quot;y&quot;, then the weight adjustment is:
* &quot;ni&quot; = &quot;n&quot;0&quot;i&quot; + &quot;n&quot;1&quot;i&quot;,
* error = &quot;y&quot; – P(1),
* &quot;wi&quot; ← &quot;wi&quot; + [(&quot;S&quot; &quot;n&quot;1&quot;i&quot; − &quot;S&quot;1 &quot;ni&quot;) / (&quot;S&quot;0 &quot;S&quot;1)] error.

===Neural-network mixing===

Beginning with PAQ7, each model outputs a prediction (instead of a pair of counts). These predictions are averaged in the logistic domain:
* &quot;xi&quot; = stretch(P&quot;i&quot;(1)),
* P(1) = squash(Σ&quot;i&quot; &quot;wi&quot; &quot;xi&quot;),
where P(1) is the probability that the next bit will be a 1, P&quot;i&quot;(1) is the probability estimated by the &quot;i&quot;-th model, and
* stretch(&quot;x&quot;) = ln(&quot;x&quot; / (1 − &quot;x&quot;)),
* squash(&quot;x&quot;) = 1 / (1 + &quot;e&quot;−&quot;x&quot;) (inverse of stretch).

After each prediction, the model is updated by adjusting the weights to minimize coding cost:
* &quot;wi&quot; ← &quot;wi&quot; + η &quot;xi&quot; (&quot;y&quot; − P(1)),
where η is the learning rate (typically 0.002 to 0.01), &quot;y&quot; is the predicted bit, and (&quot;y&quot; − P(1)) is the prediction error. The weight update algorithm differs from backpropagation in that the terms P(1)P(0) are dropped. This is because the goal of the neural network is to minimize coding cost, not root mean square error.

Most versions of PAQ use a small context to select among sets of weights for the neural network. Some versions use multiple networks whose outputs are combined with one more network prior to the SSE stages. Furthermore, for each input prediction there may be several inputs which are nonlinear functions of P&quot;i&quot;(1) in addition to stretch(P(1)).

===Context modeling===

Each model partitions the known bits of &quot;s&quot; into a set of contexts and maps each context to a bit history represented by an 8-bit state. In versions through PAQ6, the state represents a pair of counters (&quot;n&quot;0, &quot;n&quot;1). In PAQ7 and later versions under certain conditions, the state also represents the value of the last bit or the entire sequence. The states are mapped to probabilities using a 256-entry table for each model. After a prediction by the model, the table entry is adjusted slightly (typically by 0.4%) to reduce the prediction error.

In all PAQ8 versions, the representable states are as follows:
* The exact bit sequence for up to 4 bits.
* A pair of counts and an indicator of the most recent bit for sequences of 5 to 15 bits.
* A pair of counts for sequences of 16 to 41 bits.

To keep the number of states to 256, the following limits are placed on the representable counts: (41, 0), (40, 1), (12, 2), (5, 3), (4, 4), (3, 5), (2, 12), (1, 40), (0, 41). If a count exceeds this limit, then the next state is one chosen to have a similar ratio of &quot;n&quot;0 to &quot;n&quot;1. Thus, if the current state is (&quot;n&quot;0 = 4, &quot;n&quot;1 = 4, last bit = 0) and a 1 is observed, then the new state is not (&quot;n&quot;0 = 4, &quot;n&quot;1 = 5, last bit = 1). Rather, it is (&quot;n&quot;0 = 3, n1 = 4, last bit = 1).

Most context models are implemented as hash tables. Some small contexts are implemented as direct lookup tables.

===Text preprocessing===

Some versions of PAQ, in particular PAsQDa, PAQAR (both PAQ6 derivatives), and PAQ8HP1 through PAQ8HP8 (PAQ8 derivatives and Hutter prize recipients) preprocess text files by looking up words in an external dictionary and replacing them with 1- to 3-byte codes. In addition, uppercase letters are encoded with a special character followed by the lowercase letter. In the PAQ8HP series, the dictionary is organized by grouping syntactically and semantically related words together. This allows models to use just the most significant bits of the dictionary codes as context.

==History==

The following lists the major enhancements to the PAQ algorithm. In addition, there have been a large number of incremental improvements, which are omitted.

* PAQ1 was released on January 6, 2002, by Matt Mahoney. It used fixed weights and did not include an analog or sparse model.
* PAQ1SSE/PAQ2 was released on May 11, 2003, by Serge Osnach. It significantly improved compression by adding a Secondary Symbol Estimation (SSE) stage between the predictor and encoder. SSE inputs a short context and the current prediction and outputs a new prediction from a table. The table entry is then adjusted to reflect the actual bit value.
* PAQ3N, released October 9, 2003, added a sparse model.
* PAQ4, released November 15, 2003, by Matt Mahoney used adaptive weighting. PAQ5 (December 18, 2003) and PAQ6 (December 30, 2003) were minor improvements, including a new analog model. At this point, PAQ was competitive with the best PPM compressors and attracted the attention of the data compression community, which resulted in a large number of incremental improvements through April 2004. Berto Destasio tuned the models and adjusted the bit count discounting schedule. Johan de Bock made improvements to the user interface. David A. Scott made improvements to the arithmetic coder. Fabio Buffoni made speed improvements.
* During the period May 20, 2004, through July 27, 2004, Alexander Ratushnyak released seven versions of PAQAR, which made significant compression improvements by adding many new models, multiple mixers with weights selected by context, adding an SSE stage to each mixer output, and adding a preprocessor to improve the compression of Intel executable files. PAQAR stood as the top-ranked compressor through the end of 2004 but was significantly slower than prior PAQ versions.
* During the period January 18, 2005, through February 7, 2005, Przemyslaw Skibinski released four versions of PASqDa, based on PAQ6 and PAQAR with the addition of an English dictionary preprocessor. It achieved the top ranking on the Calgary corpus but not on most other benchmarks.
* A modified version of PAQ6 won the Calgary Challenge on January 10, 2004, by Matt Mahoney. This was bettered by ten subsequent versions of PAQAR by Alexander Ratushnyak. The most recent was submitted on June 5, 2006, consisting of compressed data and program source code totaling 589,862 bytes.
* PAQ7 was released December 2005 by Matt Mahoney. PAQ7 is a complete rewrite of PAQ6 and variants (PAQAR, PAsQDa). Compression ratio was similar to PAQAR but 3 times faster. However it lacked x86 and a dictionary, so it did not compress Windows executables and English text files as well as PAsQDa. It does include models for color BMP, TIFF and JPEG files, so compresses these files better. The primary difference from PAQ6 is it uses a neural network to combine models rather than a gradient descent mixer. Another feature is PAQ7&#x27;s ability to compress embedded jpeg and bitmap images in Excel-, Word- and pdf-files.
* PAQ8A was released on January 27, 2006, PAQ8C on February 13, 2006. These were experimental pre-release of anticipated PAQ8. It fixed several issues in PAQ7 (poor compression in some cases). PAQ8A also included model for compressing (x86) executables.
* PAQ8F was released on February 28, 2006. PAQ8F had three improvements over PAQ8A: a more memory efficient context model, a new indirect context model to improve compression, and a new user interface to support drag and drop in Windows. It does not use an English dictionary like the PAQ8B/C/D/E variants.
* PAQ8G was released March 3, 2006, by Przemyslaw Skibinski. PAQ8G is PAQ8F with dictionaries added and some other improvements as a redesigned TextFilter (which does not decrease compression performance on non-textual files)
* PAQ8H was released on March 22, 2006, by Alexander Ratushnyak and updated on March 24, 2006. PAQ8H is based on PAQ8G with some improvements to the model.
* PAQ8I was released on August 18, 2006, by Pavel L. Holoborodko, with bug fixes on August 24, September 4, and September 13. It added a grayscale image model for PGM files.
* PAQ8J was released on November 13, 2006, by Bill Pettis. It was based on PAQ8F with some text model improvements taken from PAQ8HP5. Thus, it did not include the text dictionaries from PAQ8G or PGM model from PAQ8I.
*Serge Osnach released a series of modeling improvements: PAQ8JA on November 16, 2006, PAQ8JB on November 21, and PAQ8JC on November 28.
* PAQ8JD was released on December 30, 2006, by Bill Pettis. This version has since been ported to 32 bit Windows for several processors, and 32 and 64 bit Linux.
* PAQ8K was released on February 13, 2007, by Bill Pettis. It includes additional models for binary files.
* PAQ8L was released on March 8, 2007 by Matt Mahoney. It is based on PAQ8JD and adds a DMC model.
* PAQ8O was released on August 24, 2007 by Andreas Morphis. Contains improved BMP and JPEG models over PAQ8L. Can be optionally compiled with SSE2 support and for 64-bit Linux. The algorithm has notable performance benefits under 64-bit OS.
* PAQ8P was released on August 25, 2008, by Andreas Morphis. Contains improved BMP model and adds a WAV model.
* PAQ8PX was released on April 25, 2009, by Jan Ondrus. It contains various improvements like better WAV compression and EXE compression.
* PAQ8KX was released on July 15, 2009, by Jan Ondrus. It is a combination of PAQ8K with PAQ8PX.
* PAQ8PF was released on September 9, 2009, by LovePimple without source code (which the GPL license requires). It compresses 7% worse, but is 7 times faster compared to PAQ8PX v66 (measured with 1 MB English text)
* PAQ9A was released on December 31, 2007, by Matt Mahoney. A new experimental version. It does not include models for specific file types, has an LZP preprocessor and supports files over 2 GB.
* ZPAQ was released on March 12, 2009, by Matt Mahoney. It uses a new archive format designed so that the current ZPAQ program will be able to decompress archives created by future ZPAQ versions (the various PAQ variants listed above are not forward compatible in this fashion). It achieves this by specifying the decompression algorithm in a bytecode program that is stored in each created archive file.

===Hutter Prizes===

The series PAQ8HP1 through PAQ8HP8 were released by Alexander Ratushnyak from August 21, 2006, through January 18, 2007, as Hutter Prize submissions. The Hutter Prize is a text compression contest using a 100 MB English and XML data set derived from Wikipedia&#x27;s source. The PAQ8HP series was forked from PAQ8H. The programs include text preprocessing dictionaries and models tuned specifically to the benchmark. All non-text models were removed. The dictionaries were organized to group syntactically and semantically related words and to group words by common suffix. The former strategy improves compression because related words (which are likely to appear in similar context) can be modeled on the high order bits of their dictionary codes. The latter strategy makes the dictionary easier to compress. The size of the decompression program and compressed dictionary is included in the contest ranking.

On October 27, 2006, it was announced that PAQ8HP5 won a Hutter Prize for Lossless Compression of Human Knowledge of €3,416.

On June 30, 2007, Ratushnyak&#x27;s PAQ8HP12 was awarded a second Hutter prize of €1732, improving upon his previous record by 3.46%.

==PAQ derivations==

Being free software, PAQ can be modified and redistributed by anyone who has a copy. This has allowed other authors to fork the PAQ compression engine and add new features such as a graphical user interface or better speed (at the expense of compression ratio). Notable PAQ derivatives include:
* WinUDA 0.291, based on PAQ6 but faster
* UDA 0.301, based on PAQ8I algorithm
* KGB, based on PAQ6 (beta version is based on PAQ7).
* Emilcont based on PAQ6
* Peazip GUI frontend (for Windows and Linux) for LPAQ, ZPAQ and various PAQ8* algorithms
* PWCM (PAQ weighted context mixing) is an independently developed closed source implementation of the PAQ algorithm used in WinRK.
*PAQCompress is a graphical user interface for several newer PAQ versions, including the latest releases of PAQ8PX, PAQ8PXD and PAQ8PXV. It is updated whenever a new version is released. The software intelligently appends an extension to the filename which it can use to decompress the file using the correct PAQ Version. The software is open source.
* PerfectCompress Is a compression software which features UCA (ULTRA Compressed Archive). A compression format that featured PAQ8PX v42 to v65 and that now can use PAQ8PF, PAQ8KX, or PAQ8PXPRE as the default UCA Compressor. In addition, PerfectCompress can compress files to PAQ8PX v42 to v67, and ZPAQ, and as of version 6.0, can compress files to LPAQ and PAQ8PF beta 1 to beta 3. PerfectCompress v6.10 introduced support compression for the recently released PAQ8PXPRE. PerfectCompress 6.12 introduces support for the PAQ8KX series.
* FrontPAQ, small gui for PAQ. Latest version is FrontPAQ v8 supporting PAQ8PX, PAQ8PF, and FP8. The software is no longer updated and users are encouraged to use PAQCompress, which implements the latest PAQ releases.

<doc id="1108601" wikidata="Q5467850" url="?curid=1108601" title="Ford Model T engine">
<text>The Ford Model T used a sidevalve, reverse-flow cylinder head inline 4-cylinder engine. It was primarily a gasoline engine. It produced for a top speed of . It was built in-unit with the Model T&#x27;s novel transmission (a planetary design), sharing the same lubricating oil.

The T engine was known for its simplicity, reliability, and economy. The engine remained in production for many years, and millions of units were produced. The engine design&#x27;s lifespan exceeded that of the Model T vehicle itself, with industrial, marine, and military applications extending its production run. The T engine is on the Ward&#x27;s 10 Best Engines of the 20th Century list.

==Fuel choices and fuel economy==
The Model T engine was built as a gasoline engine. While not engineered specifically for multifuel ability, its simple, robust design allowed a modified engine to successfully run on a variety of combustible fuels including benzene, ethanol, or kerosene. According to Ford Motor Company, the Model T had fuel economy on the order of .

==Carburetor and fuel system==

The Ford Model T engine had one carburetor, a side-draft, single-venturi unit. Its choke and throttle valves were controlled manually; the latter was with a hand lever rather than a foot pedal. The carburetor had no accelerator pump. Various vendors supplied Ford with carburetors for the T engine, including Holley, Zenith, and Kingston.

During most of the T&#x27;s production run, its fuel tank was mounted to the frame beneath the front seat. Because Ford relied on gravity to feed fuel to the carburetor rather than a fuel pump, a Model T could not climb a steep hill when the fuel level was low. The solution was to climb steep hills in reverse. In 1926, the fuel tank was moved forward and upward, under the cowl, behind the dashboard on most models, which improved the gravity feed. An aftermarket fuel pump was a common modification made to the Ford&#x27;s original spartan engine design. Even by the standards of the day, the engine was in many ways a half-manufacture when it came to thermal efficiency and other running characteristics which could lengthen the unit&#x27;s life span and improve the car as a whole. The Model T components were made to wide tolerances to accommodate manufacturing techniques of the day to produce reliable devices, and in making these components, the Ford Motor Company engineers used, from a modern perspective, extremely high levels of over tolerance to assure endurance of the end product. 

Since it was up to the end-user to finish what Ford&#x27;s assembly line left unfinished, the Ford Model T gave birth to the modern aftermarket performance engineering market. Later, with the introduction of the Model A Ford&#x27;s flathead V8 in the early 30&#x27;s, and their ease of availability in the post-war 1940&#x27;s and early 1950&#x27;s at a price that was within the reach of teenagers, mating one to a salvageable example of a Model T or a Model A lacking this eight cylinder engine gave birth to Hot Rod culture in the early 40&#x27;s.

==Internal design==

The T engine was an inline-four, with all four cylinders cast into one engine block. Such a monobloc design was an uncommon practice when T production started in 1908. It lent itself to mass production, showing the Ford company&#x27;s prescient focus on design for manufacturability. The head, however, was detachable, which not only aided Ford in manufacturing but also made valve jobs (cleaning, grinding, or replacement of the poppet valves) easier. The block and head were both of cast iron.

The engine&#x27;s bore was and its stroke was even, for a total displacement of . The compression ratio was 3.98 for most engines; early engines were slightly greater. This value is low by modern standards but was typical for the era, making the engine forgiving of poor-quality, low-octane fuel and minimizing cranking effort at starting.

The valvetrain was a side valve (flathead) design.

The crankshaft had three main bearings.

==Cooling system==

The T engine&#x27;s cooling system reflected the T&#x27;s simplicity design theme. The first few hundred Model Ts had a water pump, but it was eliminated early in production. Instead, Ford opted for a cheaper and more reliable thermosyphon system. Thermosyphon was a common engine-cooling method of the era. Hot water, being less dense, would rise to the top of the engine and up into the top of the radiator, descending to the bottom as it cooled, and back into the engine. (This was the direction of water flow in most cars which did have water pumps, until the introduction of crossflow radiator designs.) The thermosiphon system was susceptible to overheating if worked heavily, but served well for most Model T usage.

Many types of water pumps were available as aftermarket accessories.

==Ignition system==

The Model T engine&#x27;s ignition system used a flywheel-mounted magneto to produce the current necessary to produce a spark to initiate combustion. This current was distributed by the timer (analogous to a distributor in a modern vehicle) to one of the four trembler coils, one for each cylinder. The coil stepped up the voltage and discharged it to the spark plug in the cylinder. Ignition timing was adjusted manually by using the spark advance lever mounted on the steering column, which rotated the timer, advancing or retarding the ignition timing. A certain amount of skill and experience was required to find the optimal spark timing for any speed and load.

The magneto was the first Model T component to be assembled on an assembly line, and the method was copied to many other Model T production segments. The ignition system of the Fordson tractor was similar to that of the Model T.

==Electrical System==
In the early years of Model T production, all engines were started with a hand crank. A battery could be used to supply ignition current for starting, since it could be difficult to hand-crank a very cold engine fast enough for the magneto to produce sufficient current. However, although all Model T&#x27;s had a &quot;BAT&quot; (battery) position on the coil box switch and a corresponding terminal on the box, Ford did not supply or even encourage the use of a battery before 1919, when it introduced a battery-driven electric starter. Even this was not standard equipment for all models until sometime in 1926, the last year of production.

Most cars sold after 1919 were equipped with this starter, which was engaged by a small round foot-operated button switch on the floor. These cars included a battery and a generator for recharging it. In keeping with the goal of reliability and simplicity, the trembler coil and magneto ignition system was retained even on cars with the starter system.

When electric headlights were introduced in 1915, the magneto was upgraded to supply enough power for the lights and horn. If a Model T had an electric starter equipped, the upgraded electrical system would also be used to supply power to these items.

==Operation==
Operating the T engine was not difficult after some experience, although the learning curve was longer than today&#x27;s. The various manual control tasks (such as manual choke and spark advance) and the method of use (such as hand throttle) were typical for automobiles of the era, although they might seem more like farm tractor operation to most automobile drivers of today.

Before starting a Model T with the hand crank, the spark had to be manually retarded or the engine might &quot;kick back&quot;. The crank handle was cupped in the palm, with the thumb tucked under the handle (not clasped over top of it), so that if the engine did kick back, the rapid reverse motion of the crank would throw the hand away from the handle, rather than violently twisting the wrist or breaking the thumb. Most Model T Fords had the choke operated by a wire emerging from the bottom of the radiator where it could be operated with the left hand. This was used to prime the engine while cranking the engine slowly; then the engine was started with a rapid pull of the crank handle. In good tune, an already-primed T engine only has to be cranked half a turn for it to successfully start.

The T&#x27;s planetary transmission is famous for its differences from what later became the norm for car transmission operation. The 3 foot pedals are not used in the way later cars use their pedals. Operation is not difficult but requires &quot;unlearning&quot; habits used with later vehicles.

==Design changes over the years==
The following major changes were made (listed by year): 
* 1909: First model year. Water pump was discontinued; subsequent Model T engines used thermosyphoning to circulate the coolant.
* 1911: Valve covers were added.
* 1917: Higher head with larger water jacket.
* 1919: Engine starter introduced as an option.
* 1920: Lighter-weight rods and pistons.
* 1922: The cylinder casting was changed so a single valve cover could be used.
* 1926: An extra boss was added at the rear for two additional bolts stiffening the transmission.
* 1927: The carburetor throttle rod was re-routed over the engine.

==Production run==
The T engine was produced continuously from September 27, 1908, through August 4, 1941, exactly 12,000 days. This makes it one of the longest engines in series production, especially considering that the specifications remained mostly unchanged for this entire duration. Its production run for the U.S. consumer market for passenger cars and pickups was shorter, being the 19 years&#x27; production run of the Model T itself for that market (1908 to 1927). But the engine continued to be produced and sold to various consumer, industrial, military, and marine markets throughout the world until 1941.

==Ford Model A engine==

The engine used in the Model A was a water-cooled L-head inline four with a displacement of . This engine provided , but made substantially more torque, at of torque. The bore and stroke were also enlarged from the original Model T&#x27;s engine; measuring x . There are no interchangeable parts between the Model T and Model A engines.

<text>The , abbreviated DYLJ or , is a political youth organization in Japan. It is the youth wing of the Japanese Communist Party, as well as an organizational body of Zengakuren. Minsei describes itself as a &quot;voluntary youth organization in response to a keen demand of the youth, aiming towards a better life, peace, independence, democracy and social progress&quot;. Its main activities are the peace movement, opposition to tuition hikes, petitions, volunteer work and educational activities and the like.

==History==
The DYLJ was formed on 5 April 1923 in the Empire of Japan as the Japanese Communist Youth League (JCYL), influenced by the Russian Revolution in Russia. Like the JCP, it focused on suffrage for young Japanese aged 18 and above, the overthrow of the &quot;Emperor system&quot;, equal pay for equal work, and opposition to militarization. Also, like the JCP, it was banned under the Peace Preservation Law and some of its members, such as Kawai Yoshitora, Takashima Mato, and Iijima Kimi, were arrested by police and were either killed during interrogations or else died in prison.

After World War II, the JCYL was re-established in tandem with the re-establishment of the JCP. Following a series of violent misadventures in the 1950s, in which the JCP tried to foment an immediate communist revolution and ordered the JCYL into the mountains to help form &quot;Mountain Village Guerrilla Squads&quot;, the JCP hastily retreated from its former militant line and the JCYL was recast as a &quot;force for peace and democracy&quot; and renamed the Democratic Youth League of Japan. Minsei&#x27;s last bit of militant activism took place during the massive 1960 Anpo protests against the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty, in which many Minsei students took part. However, thereafter the JCP and Minsei increasingly eschewed extra-parliamentary street protests. In 1960, during its 6th National Congress, Minsei established its &quot;Agreement&quot; and &quot;Call to the Youth League&quot;, whereby the League promised to pursue &quot;peaceful, scientific socialism.&quot;

At the height of the 1968–1969 Japanese university protests, while other students were hurling rocks and stones at police, Minsei students observed major events such as International Anti-War Day in 1968 by holding peaceful potluck picnics in the park, and emphasized peaceful forms of activism such as petitioning university administrations to improve campus facilities, a focus on mundane daily life that led the more militant students derisively nicknamed the &quot;toilet paper line.&quot; However, when Zenkyōtō activists began barricading university campuses, some Minsei students began arming themselves with helmets and staves and engaged in violent battles with the militant student activists. The Minsei students claimed they were &quot;defending&quot; the university from attack, and whereas other students called their staves &quot;gebabō&quot; (&quot;violence sticks&quot;), the Minsei students called their staves &quot;minshūkabō&quot; (&quot;democratization sticks&quot;).

Minsei membership peaked in 1970 at around 200,000 students before declining steadily thereafter, in tandem with the decline of the Japan Communist Party and the Japanese student movement in general. In recent years, Minsei has consistently listed its membership as &quot;around 10,000&quot; students.

<doc id="1108610" wikidata="Q8043790" url="?curid=1108610" title="Xero (SF fanzine)">
<text>Xero was a fanzine edited and published by Dick Lupoff, Pat Lupoff and Bhob Stewart from 1960 to 1963, winning a Hugo Award in the latter year. With science fiction and comic books as the core subjects, &quot;Xero&quot; also featured essays, satire, articles, poetry, artwork and cartoons on a wide range of other topics, material later collected into two hardcover books.

== History ==
The first issue was distributed September 3–5, 1960, at Pittcon (the 18th World Science Fiction Convention in Pittsburgh). That issue featured an article about Captain Marvel and Fawcett Comics, the first &quot;All in Color for a Dime&quot; installment. In 1961, Lupoff wrote an article for &quot;Comic Art&quot; about the launch of &quot;Xero&quot; and his focus on comics:
:The night of the costume ball, Pat and I showed up in our costumes: hastily devised Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel outfits. Mine was made from a set of long underwear, and hers was nothing but a man’s red T-shirt emblazoned with felt lightning, plus a yellow sash. They were extremely popular costumes. Everyone from Doc Smith on down wanted to take our pictures. Why?… The only conclusion that can be drawn is that it was not us, nor our costumes themselves, that were popular. It was Captain Marvel and Mary Marvel, momentarily embodied in us, that drew the admiration and applause... Further, &quot;All in Color&quot; has been the most letter-provoking feature of &quot;Xero&quot;, numerous people have requested copies, specifying that their motive is to obtain the comics articles, and if all the authors currently committed to write for the series come through with articles, the series will run well into 1962 before material runs out.

In subsequent issues, the articles and letter columns often featured well-known contributors: Dan Adkins, Otto Binder, James Blish, Anthony Boucher, Algis Budrys, Lin Carter, Avram Davidson, L. Sprague de Camp, Roger Ebert, Harlan Ellison, Ed Gorman, Ron Haydock, Roy Krenkel, Frederik Pohl, Larry Shaw, Robert Shea, Steve Stiles, Bob Tucker, Donald E. Westlake, Ted White, Paul Williams and Walt Willis.

== Books ==
The format of &quot;Xero&quot; imitated Ace Books&#x27; Ace Doubles (two novels bound together with cover illustrations on front and back). When &quot;Xero&quot; was flipped over, it revealed a second cover leading into an article on comic books. These articles were mostly about 1940s superheroes: &quot;The Spawn of M.C. Gaines&quot; by Ted White; &quot;Me To Your Leader Take&quot; by Richard Ellington; &quot;The Big Red Cheese&quot; by Dick Lupoff; &quot;The First (arf, arf) Superhero of Them All (Popeye)&quot; by Bill Blackbeard; &quot;OK, Axis, Here We Come!&quot; by Don Thompson; &quot;One on All and All on One&quot; by Tom Fagan; &quot;A Swell Bunch of Guys&quot; by Jim Harmon; &quot;The Four-Panelled, Sock-Bang-Powie Saturday Afternoon Screen&quot; by Chris Steinbrunner; &quot;Captain Billy&#x27;s Whiz Gang!&quot; by Roy Thomas; &quot;The Second Banana Superheroes&quot; by Ron Goulart; and &quot;Comic of the Absurd&quot; by Harlan Ellison. These articles were later collected in the hardcover book &quot;All in Color for a Dime&quot; (Arlington House, 1970), reprinted in paperback by Ace Books in 1971 and Krause Publications in 1997.

Other articles and art from &quot;Xero&quot; were reprinted in &quot;The Best of Xero&quot;, published by San Francisco&#x27;s Tachyon Publications in 2004. John Hertz reviewed &quot;The Best of Xero&quot; in &quot;Emerald City&quot;:
:Davidson, Carter, and Stiles all contributed to &quot;Xero&quot;; Stiles, who in 2004 was on the Best Fanartist ballot, then drew with a stylus on mimeograph stencils, the technology of the day. Pat &amp; Dick Lupoff typed stencils in their Manhattan apartment, printed them on a machine in Noreen &amp; Larry Shaw’s basement, collated by hand, and lugged the results to SF cons or stuffed them in mailboxes. The machine had not been given by Damon Knight, A. J. Budrys explained in a letter after a while, but lent. Eventually drawings could be scanned by electro-stencil, a higher tech. Colored ink joined colored paper, sometimes wildly colored. &quot;Xero&quot; could be spectacular. Knight later founded the Science Fiction Writers of America; he and Budrys were each later Writer Guest of Honor at a Worldcon. James Blish won two Retrospective Hugos in 2004; in &quot;Xero&quot; he reviewed Budrys’ &quot;Rogue Moon&quot; (not reprinted by Tachyon), and Kingsley Amis’ &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot;. You’ll also see Anthony Boucher, Harlan Ellison, Ethel Lindsay, Fred Pohl, Rick Sneary, Bob Tucker as &quot;Hoy Ping Pong&quot;, Harry Warner—fans and pros mixing it up. Roger Ebert, later a movie critic, contributed poetry, often free-style, or formal and funny in his fanziner’s version of Browning’s &quot;Last Duchess&quot;:
::&quot;This crud&quot;
::&quot;I print for you disgusts me; the thud&quot;
::&quot;Is of your fanzine dully falling.&quot;

<text>Mount Parker is the second-highest peak () on Hong Kong Island, after Victoria Peak (). It is the 40th-highest peak in the territory of Hong Kong.

== Name ==
It is named after Admiral of the Fleet Sir William Parker, 1st Baronet, of Shenstone.

== Environment ==

=== Ecology ===
A rare native tree, the Hong Kong camellia (&quot;Camellia hongkongensis&quot;), can be found growing on Mount Parker, while another species, Crapnell&#x27;s camellia (&quot;Camellia crapnelliana&quot;), was first discovered on the peak.

== Road restrictions ==
Much of the mountain is in a protected country park area. The roads that go up this mountain are access-restricted. Motorcycles, cars, bicycles, electric scooters without a special permit are not allowed on these roads, and the people who are caught may incur a penalty.

<doc id="1108621" wikidata="Q115899453" url="?curid=1108621" title="Yandro">
<text>Yandro was an influential science fiction fanzine published from 1953-1986 by Buck and Juanita Coulson. Over that period, they published 259 issues, the final issue not being distributed until 1991. The headquarters was in North Manchester, Indiana. &quot;Yandro&quot;&#x27;s content covered a broad spectrum of topics. It won the Hugo Award for Best Fanzine in 1965, and was a nominee for the Hugo Award 10 years in a row, from 1959 through 1968. 

Among other articles, Yandro featured Coulson&#x27;s incisive reviews of books and, especially, fanzines.

Film critic and one-time fan Roger Ebert wrote: &quot;Locs (letters of comment) were the currency of payment for fanzine contributors; you wrote, and in the next issue got to read about what you had written. Today I can see my name on a full-page ad for a movie with disinterest, but what Harry Warner or Buck Coulson had to say about me — well, that was important.&quot;

&quot;Yandro&#x27;s&quot; title came from the works of Manly Wade Wellman, who took it from the traditional folk song &quot;He&#x27;s Gone Away.&quot; Yandro is the name of a mountain in North Carolina, whose exact location has been lost. Some believe Yandro (the mountain) never existed at all, and was just another name for one of the other mountains in the region. The song itself talks about a lady whose lover has gone on a journey somewhere past Yandro.

<doc id="1108628" wikidata="Q186266" url="?curid=1108628" title="Homo floresiensis">
<text>Homo floresiensis , also known as &quot;Flores Man&quot; or &quot;Hobbit&quot; (after the fictional species), is an extinct species of small archaic humans that inhabited the island of Flores, Indonesia, until the arrival of modern humans about 50,000 years ago.

The remains of an individual who would have stood about in height were discovered in 2003 at Liang Bua cave. As of 2015, partial skeletons of 15 individuals have been recovered; this includes one complete skull, referred to as &quot;LB1&quot;.

&quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; is thought to have arrived on Flores around 1.27–1 million years ago. There is debate as to whether &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; represents a descendant of Javanese &quot;Homo erectus&quot; that reduced its body size as a result of insular dwarfism, or whether it represents an otherwise undetected migration of small, &quot;Australopithecus&quot; or &quot;Homo habilis&quot;-grade archaic humans outside of Africa.

This hominin was at first considered remarkable for its survival until relatively recent times, initially thought to be only 12,000 years ago. However, more extensive stratigraphic and chronological work has pushed the dating of the most recent evidence of its existence back to 50,000 years ago. The &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; skeletal material at Liang Bua is now dated from 60,000 to 100,000 years ago; stone tools recovered alongside the skeletal remains were from archaeological horizons ranging from 50,000 to 190,000 years ago. Other earlier remains from Mata Menge date to around 700,000 years ago.

==Specimens==
===Discovery===

The first specimens were discovered on the Indonesian island of Flores on 2 September 2003 by a joint Australian-Indonesian team of archaeologists looking for evidence of the original human migration of modern humans from Asia to Australia. They instead recovered a nearly complete, small-statured skeleton, LB1, in the Liang Bua cave, and subsequent excavations in 2003 and 2004 recovered seven additional skeletons, initially dated from 38,000 to 13,000 years ago.

In 2004, a separate species &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; was named and described by Peter Brown et al., with LB1 as the holotype. A tooth, LB2, was referred to the species. LB1 is a fairly complete skeleton, including a nearly complete skull, which belonged to a 30-year-old woman, and has been nicknamed &quot;Little Lady of Flores&quot; or &quot;Flo&quot;. An arm bone provisionally assigned to &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;, specimen LB3, is about 74,000 years old. The specimens are not fossilized and have been described as having &quot;the consistency of wet blotting paper&quot;. Once exposed, the bones had to be left to dry before they could be dug up. The discoverers proposed that a variety of features, both primitive and derived, identify these individuals as belonging to a new species. Based on previous date estimates, the discoverers also proposed that &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; lived contemporaneously with modern humans on Flores. Before publication, the discoverers were considering placing LB1 into her own genus, &quot;Sundanthropus floresianus&quot; (); however, reviewers of the article recommended that, despite her size, she should be placed in the genus &quot;Homo&quot;.
In 2009, additional finds were reported, increasing the minimum number of individuals represented by bones to fourteen. In 2015, teeth were referred to a fifteenth individual, LB15.

Stone implements of a size considered appropriate to these small humans are also widely present in the cave. The implements are at horizons initially dated to 95,000 to 13,000 years ago. Modern humans reached the region by around 50,000 years ago, by which time &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; is thought to have gone extinct. Comparisons of the stone artifacts with those made by modern humans in East Timor indicate many technological similarities.

===Scandal over specimen damage===

The fossils are property of the Indonesian state. In early December 2004, Indonesian paleoanthropologist Teuku Jacob, formerly chief paleontologist of the Indonesian Gadjah Mada University, removed most of the remains from their repository, Jakarta&#x27;s National Research Centre of Archaeology, with the permission of one of the institute&#x27;s directors, Raden Panji Soejono, and kept them for three months. Professor Jacob did not believe the specimens represented a different species, contending that the LB1 find was from a 25–30 year-old omnivorous subspecies of &quot;H. sapiens&quot;, probably a pygmy, and that the small skull was due to microcephaly, which produces a small brain and skull. Professor Richard Roberts of the University of Wollongong in Australia and other anthropologists expressed the fear that important scientific evidence would be sequestered by a small group of scientists who neither allowed access by other scientists nor published their own research. Jacob returned the remains on 23 February 2005 with portions severely damaged and missing two leg bones.

Press reports thus described the condition of the returned remains: &quot;[including] long, deep cuts marking the lower edge of the Hobbit&#x27;s jaw on both sides, said to be caused by a knife used to cut away the rubber mould ... the chin of a second Hobbit jaw was snapped off and glued back together. Whoever was responsible misaligned the pieces and put them at an incorrect angle ... The pelvis was smashed, destroying details that reveal body shape, gait and evolutionary history.&quot;, causing the discovery team leader Morwood to remark, &quot;It&#x27;s sickening; Jacob was greedy and acted totally irresponsibly.&quot;

Jacob, however, denied any wrongdoing. He stated that the damages occurred during transport from Yogyakarta back to Jakarta despite the claimed physical evidence that the jawbone had been broken while making a mould of the bones.

In 2005, Indonesian officials forbade access to the cave. Some news media, such as the BBC, expressed the opinion that the restriction was to protect Jacob, who was considered &quot;Indonesia&#x27;s king of palaeoanthropology&quot;, from being proved wrong. Scientists were allowed to return to the cave in 2007, shortly after Jacob&#x27;s death.

==Classification and evolution==

===Phylogeny and evolution===
Because of the deep neighbouring Lombok Strait, Flores remained an isolated island during episodes of low sea level. Therefore, the ancestors of &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; could only have reached the island by oceanic dispersal, most likely by rafting. The oldest stone tools on Flores are around 1 million years old. Stone artifacts are absent from sites over 1.27 million years old, suggesting that the ancestors of &quot;H&quot;. &quot;floresiensis&quot; arrived after this time.

In 2016, fossil teeth and a partial jaw from hominins assumed to be ancestral to &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; were discovered at Mata Menge, about from Liang Bua. They date to about 700,000 years ago. Other remains (including a humerus) were later described from Mata Menge, with the remains subsequently being directly assigned to &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;. These remains are about the same size or somewhat smaller than the remains from Liang Bua, suggesting the size of the species remained stable for hundreds of thousands of years up until its extinction. 

Two hypotheses have been proposed as to the origin of &quot;H. floresiensis.&quot; The first proposes that &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; descended from an early migration of very primitive small &quot;Australopithecus&quot;/&quot;Homo habilis&quot;-grade archaic humans outside of Africa prior to 1.75 million years ago. This is based on various aspects of &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; sketetal anatomy, such as its feet bones being considered as more similar to those of very archaic humans such as &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Homo habilis&quot; than to &quot;Homo erectus.&quot; This position has been supported by several cladistical analyses. Other authors have argued that &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; instead likely represents the descendants of a population of Javanese &quot;Homo erectus&quot; that became isolated on Flores, with the small body size being the result of insular dwarfism, a well known evolutionary trend found among various island animals. These authors alternatively suggest that &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; has several cranial and dental similarities to &quot;H. erectus&quot;, particularly to early Javanese &quot;Homo erectus.&quot; These authors also dispute some of the similarities to &quot;Australopithecus&quot; and &quot;Homo habilis&quot;-grade archaic humans, and suggest that others may have been the result of evolutionary reversals/convergence. 

It has been noted that there is no evidence archaic humans in the adjacent (and likely source) region of Java earlier than 1.3-1.5 or 1.8 million years ago, with the earliest human presence on Java being represented by &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, with there also being no evidence of &quot;Australopithecus&quot; or &quot;Homo habilis&quot;-grade archaic humans anywhere outside of Africa, which supporters of the &quot;Homo erectus&quot;-origin hypothesis suggest makes the descent of &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; from these more primitive hominins unlikely.

===DNA extraction attempt===
In 2006, two teams attempted to extract DNA from a tooth discovered in 2003; however, both teams were unsuccessful. It has been suggested that this happened because the dentine was targeted; new research suggests that the cementum has higher concentrations of DNA. Moreover, the heat generated by the high speed of the drill bit may have denatured the DNA.

===Congenital disorder claims===
The small brain size of &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; at 417 cc prompted hypotheses that the specimens were simply &quot;H. sapiens&quot; with a birth defect, rather than the result of neurological reorganisation. These claims have subsequently been widely rejected.

====Microcephaly====

Prior to Jacob&#x27;s removal of the fossils, American neuroanthropologist Dean Falk and her colleagues performed a CT scan of the LB1 skull and a virtual endocast, and concluded that the brainpan was neither that of a pygmy nor an individual with a malformed skull and brain. In response, American neurologist Jochen Weber and colleagues compared the computer model skull with microcephalic human skulls, and found that the skull size of LB1 falls in the middle of the size range of the human samples, and is not inconsistent with microcephaly. A 2006 study stated that LB1 probably descended from a pygmy population of modern humans, but herself shows signs of microcephaly, and other specimens from the cave show small stature but not microcephaly.

In 2005, the original discoverers of &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;, after unearthing more specimens, countered that the skeptics had mistakenly attributed the height of &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; to microcephaly. Falk stated that Martin&#x27;s assertions were unsubstantiated. In 2006, Australian palaeoanthropologist Debbie Argue and colleagues also concluded that the finds are indeed a new species. In 2007, Falk found that &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; brains were similar in shape to modern humans, and the frontal and temporal lobes were well-developed, which would not have been the case were they microcephalic.

In 2008, Greek palaeontologist George Lyras and colleagues said that LB1 falls outside the range of variation for human microcephalic skulls. However, a 2013 comparison of the LB1 endocast to a set of 100 normocephalic and 17 microcephalic endocasts showed that there is a wide variation in microcephalic brain shape ratios and that in these ratios the group as such is not clearly distinct from normocephalics. The LB1 brain shape nevertheless aligns slightly better with the microcephalic sample, with the shape at the extreme edge of the normocephalic group. A 2016 pathological analysis of LB1&#x27;s skull revealed no pathologies nor evidence of microcephaly, and concluded that LB1 is a separate species.

====Laron syndrome====
A 2007 study postulated that the skeletons were those of humans who suffered from Laron syndrome, which was first reported in 1966, and is most common in inbreeding populations, which may have been the scenario on the small island. It causes a short stature and small skull, and many conditions seen in Laron syndrome patients are also exhibited in &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;. The estimated height of LB1 is at the lower end of the average for afflicted human women, but the endocranial volume is much smaller than anything exhibited in Laron syndrome patients. DNA analysis would be required to support this theory.

====Congenital iodine deficiency syndrome====
In 2008, Australian researcher Peter Obendorf — who studies congenital iodine deficiency syndrome — and colleagues suggested that LB1 and LB6 suffered from myxoedematous (ME) congenital iodine deficiency syndrome resulting from congenital hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), and that they were part of an affected population of &quot;H. sapiens&quot; on the island. Congenital iodine deficiency syndrome, caused by iodine deficiency, is expressed by small bodies and reduced brain size (but ME causes less motor and mental disablement than other forms of congenital iodine deficiency syndrome), and is a form of dwarfism still found in the local Indonesian population. They said that various features of &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; are diagnostic characteristics, such as enlarged pituitary fossa, unusually straight and untwisted humeral heads, relatively thick limbs, double rooted premolar, and primitive wrist morphology.

However, Falk&#x27;s scans of LB1&#x27;s pituitary fossa show that it is not larger than usual. Also, in 2009, anthropologists Colin Groves and Catharine FitzGerald compared the Flores bones with those of ten people who had had cretinism, and found no overlap. Obendorf and colleagues rejected Groves and FitzGerald&#x27;s argument the following year. A 2012 study similar to Groves and FitzGeralds&#x27; also found no evidence of congenital iodine deficiency syndrome.

====Down syndrome====
From 2006, physical anthropologist Maciej Henneberg and colleagues have claimed that LB1 suffered from Down syndrome, and that the remains of other individuals at the Flores site were merely normal modern humans. However, there are a number of characteristics shared by both LB1 and LB6 as well as other known early humans and absent in &quot;H. sapiens&quot;, such as the lack of a chin. In 2016, a comparative study concluded that LB1 did not exhibit a sufficient number of Down syndrome characteristics to support a diagnosis. The noted physical anthropologist Chris Stringer in 2011 wrote of &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; deniers generally, &quot;I think they have damaged their own, and palaeoanthropologist&#x27;s, reputation.&quot;

== Anatomy ==
The most important and obvious identifying features of &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; are its small body and small cranial capacity. Brown and Morwood also identified a number of additional, less obvious features that might distinguish LB1 from modern &quot;H. sapiens&quot;, including the form of the teeth, the absence of a chin, and a lesser torsion in the lower end of the humerus (upper arm bone). Each of these putative distinguishing features has been heavily scrutinized by the scientific community, with different research groups reaching differing conclusions as to whether these features support the original designation of a new species, or whether they identify LB1 as a severely pathological &quot;H. sapiens&quot;.

A 2015 study of the dental morphology of forty teeth of &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; compared to 450 teeth of living and extinct human species, states that they had &quot;primitive canine-premolar and advanced molar morphologies,&quot; which is unique among hominins.

The discovery of additional partial skeletons has verified the existence of some features found in LB1, such as the lack of a chin, but Jacob and other research teams argue that these features do not distinguish LB1 from local modern humans. Lyras &quot;et al.&quot; have asserted, based on 3D-morphometrics, that the skull of LB1 differs significantly from all &quot;H. sapiens&quot; skulls, including those of small-bodied individuals and microcephalics, and is more similar to the skull of &quot;Homo erectus&quot;. Ian Tattersall argues that the species is wrongly classified as &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; as it is far too archaic to assign to the genus &quot;Homo&quot;.

===Size===
LB1&#x27;s height is estimated to have been . The height of a second skeleton, LB8, has been estimated at based on tibial length. These estimates are outside the range of normal modern human height and considerably shorter than the average adult height of even the smallest modern humans, such as the Mbenga and Mbuti at , Twa, Semang at for adult women of the Malay Peninsula, or the Andamanese at also for adult women. LB1&#x27;s body mass is estimated to have been . LB1 and LB8 are also somewhat smaller than the australopithecines, such as &quot;Lucy&quot;, from three million years ago, not previously thought to have expanded beyond Africa. Thus, LB1 and LB8 may be the shortest and smallest members of the extended human group discovered thus far.

Their short stature was likely due to insular dwarfism, where size decreases as a response to fewer resources in an island ecosystem. In 2006, Indonesian palaeoanthropologist Teuku Jacob and colleagues said that LB1 has a similar stature to the Rampasasa pygmies who inhabit the island, and that size can vary substantially in pygmy populations. A 2018 study refuted the possibility of Rampasasa pygmies descending from &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;, concluding that &quot;multiple independent instances of hominin insular dwarfism occurred on Flores&quot;.

Aside from smaller body size, the specimens seem to otherwise resemble &quot;H. erectus&quot;, a species known to have been living in Southeast Asia at times coincident with earlier finds purported to be of &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;.

===Brain===

In addition to a small body size, &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; had a remarkably small brain size. LB1&#x27;s brain is estimated to have had a volume of , placing it at the range of chimpanzees or the extinct australopithecines. LB1&#x27;s brain size is less than half that of its presumed immediate ancestor, &quot;H. erectus&quot; (). The brain-to-body mass ratio of LB1 lies between that of &quot;H. erectus&quot; and the great apes. Such a reduction is likely due to insular dwarfism, and a 2009 study found that the reduction in brain size of extinct pygmy hippopotamuses in Madagascar compared with their living relatives is proportionally greater than the reduction in body size, and similar to the reduction in brain size of &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; compared with &quot;H. erectus&quot;.

Smaller size does not appear to have affected mental faculties, as Brodmann area 10 on the prefrontal cortex, which is associated with cognition, is about the same size as that of modern humans. &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; is also associated with evidence for advanced behaviours, such as the use of fire, butchering, and stone tool manufacturing.

===Limbs===
The angle of humeral torsion was lesser than in modern humans. The humeral head of modern humans is twisted between 145 and 165 degrees to the plane of the elbow joint, whereas it is 120 degrees in &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;. This may have provided an advantage when arm-swinging, and, in tandem with the unusual morphology of the shoulder girdle and short clavicle, would have displaced the shoulders slightly forward into an almost shrugging position. The shrugging position would have compensated for the lower range of motion in the arm, allowing for similar maneuverability in the elbows as in modern humans. The wrist bones are similar to those of apes and &quot;Australopithecus.&quot; They were significantly smaller and more flexible than the carpals of modern humans, lacking contemporary features which evolved at least 800,000 years ago. 

The leg bones were more robust than those of modern humans. The feet were unusually flat and large in relation with the rest of the body. As a result, when walking, they would have had to bend the knees further back than modern humans do. This caused a high-stepping gait and slow walking speed. The toes were thin, long, and halluces were almost indistinguishable from the other metatarsals.

==Culture==

The cave yielded over ten thousand stone artefacts, mainly lithic flakes, surprising considering &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;″s small brain. This has led some researchers to theorize that &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; inherited their tool-making skills from &quot;H. erectus&quot;. Points, perforators, blades, and microblades were associated with remains of the extinct elephant-relative &quot;Stegodon.&quot; It has therefore been proposed that &quot;H.&quot; &quot;floresiensis&quot; hunted juvenile &quot;Stegodon&quot;. Similar artefacts are found at the Soa Basin south, associated with &quot;Stegodon&quot; and Komodo dragon remains, and are attributed to a likely ancestral population of &quot;H. erectus&quot;. Other authors have doubted the extent of hunting of &quot;Stegodon&quot; by &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;, noting the rarity of cut marks on remains of &quot;Stegodon&quot; found at Liang Bua, suggesting that they would have faced intense competition for carcasses with other predators, like the Komodo dragon, the giant stork &quot;Leptoptilos robustus&quot;, and vultures, and that it was possible that their main prey was instead the giant rats like &quot;Papagomys&quot; endemic to the island, which are found abundantly at Liang Bua. While it was initially suggested that &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; was capable of using fire, the supporting evidence for this claim was later found to be unreliable.

==Extinction==

The youngest &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; bone remains in the cave date to 60,000 years ago, and the youngest stone tools to 50,000 years ago. The previous estimate of 12,000 BP was due to an undetected unconformity in the cave stratigraphy. The timing of their disappearance from the cave stratigraphy is close to the time that modern humans reached the area, which may suggest the effects of modern humans directly on &quot;H. floresiensis&quot; or more broadly on the ecosystems of Flores caused or contributed to their extinction. DNA analysis of pygmy modern humans from Flores has found no evidence of any DNA from &quot;H. floresiensis&quot;.

== Paleoecology ==
During the late Early Pleistocene to Late Pleistocene, and before the arrival of &quot;Homo sapiens&quot;, Flores exhibited a depauperate ecosystem with relatively few terrestrial vertebrate species, including the extinct dwarf proboscidean (elephant relative) &quot;Stegodon florensis&quot;; and a variety of rats (Murinae) including small-sized forms like &quot;Rattus hainaldi&quot;, the Polynesian rat, &quot;Paulamys,&quot; and &quot;Komodomys,&quot; the medium-sized &quot;Hooijeromys&quot;, and giant &quot;Papagomys&quot; and extinct &quot;Spelaeomys,&quot; the latter two genera being about the size of rabbits, with body masses of . Also present were the Komodo dragon and another smaller monitor lizard (&quot;Varanus hooijeri&quot;), with birds including a giant stork (&quot;Leptoptilos robustus&quot;) and a vulture (&quot;Trigonoceps&quot;).

==&quot;Hobbit&quot; nickname==

&quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; was swiftly nicknamed &quot;the hobbit&quot; by the discoverers, after the fictional race popularized in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s book &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, and some of the discoverers suggested naming the species &quot;H. hobbitus&quot;.

In October 2012, a New Zealand scientist due to give a public lecture on &quot;Homo floresiensis&quot; was told by the Tolkien Estate that he was not allowed to use the word &quot;hobbit&quot; in promoting the lecture.

In 2012, the American film studio The Asylum, which produces low-budget &quot;mockbuster&quot; films, planned to release a movie entitled &quot;Age of the Hobbits&quot; depicting a &quot;peace-loving&quot; community of &quot;H.floresiensis&quot; &quot;enslaved by the Java Men, a race of flesh-eating dragon-riders.&quot; The film was intended to piggyback on the success of Peter Jackson&#x27;s film &quot;The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey&quot;. The film was blocked from release due to a legal dispute about using the word &quot;hobbit.&quot; The Asylum argued that the film did not violate the Tolkien copyright because the film was about &quot;H.floresiensis&quot;, &quot;uniformly referred to as &#x27;Hobbits&#x27; in the scientific community.&quot; The film was later retitled &quot;Clash of the Empires&quot;.

<doc id="1108629" wikidata="Q5505639" url="?curid=1108629" title="Progress Party's Youth">
<text>The Progress Party&#x27;s Youth (, FpU), is the youth wing of the Norwegian political party the Progress Party. It is generally considered to be more aligned towards classical liberalism than the Progress Party. The organization has active chapters in all counties of Norway as well as in over 50 municipalities.

From 2012 to 2014, Himanshu Gulati was the organisation&#x27;s chairperson. Gulati is the first leader of a youth wing of a major Norwegian political party with multi-cultural background. After being selected to the post of State Secretary in the Ministry of Justice, Gulati stepped down. In 2014, Atle Simonsen was elected chairperson Atle sat as chairman until 2016, when the annual national meeting of FpU elected Bjørn-Kristian Svendrud as the organisation&#x27;s chairman.

The current chairperson is Simen Velle. He was elected in 2022. Velle is a self-described classical liberal, advocating for policies like legalization of drugs, polygamy and sales of organs.

== History ==
The organization was officially founded by members of the Progress Party (FpU) on the annual party convention on 10–11 February 1978, the same convention where Carl I. Hagen was elected chairman of the party. The organization&#x27;s first leader was the future mayor of Oslo, Peter N. Myhre, who served until 1984.

=== 1994 Bolkesjø purge ===

As soon as in 1989, rifts appeared within the FpU between a liberal and conservative faction. In the 1989 election several, hardline libertarians such as Pål Atle Skjervengen and Tor Mikkel Wara gained seats in the Storting and this further weakened the conservatives&#x27; position. That same year saw controversial proposals put forth by the liberals regarding gay marriage and immigration which sparked heated debates within among the youth members.

In 1992, the liberal Lars Grønntun was elected leader after a power struggle with Ingvar Myrvollen. This began a period of large-scale infighting which ultimately led to the board dissolving the organization, only to have the decision reversed by the party. After the expulsion of its entire liberal faction during the 1994 Progress Party national convention at Bolkesjø in Telemark, Ulf Leirstein became the new leader.

=== Recent history ===
Norwegian secondary schools hold school elections. The organization consistently polls better there than its parent party and emerged as the largest party nationwide in 1989, 2003, 2005 and 2009. Recently, they have been out-polled by their social-democratic rivals from AUF. In 2009, FpU set a new membership record of 3,031 members, although this number dipped to 2,892 in 2010. Nevertheless, all political youth-organizations experienced an upsurge in new members in the aftermath of the 2011 Norway attacks.

== Ideology and political positions ==
In the organization&#x27;s manifesto, it states: &quot;The Progress Party&#x27;s Youth supports a free-marked economy, regulated by supply and demand, without interference from government officials. A market economy is the economical system which gives the individual person greatest freedom of action&quot;. It also wishes to reform the welfare state with private insurance arrangements and increase privatization in the health and education sector, for one making the public hospitals &quot;compete&quot; with the privately owned hospitals for best possible care. It supports the legalization of medicinal cannabis, and more liberal drug laws in general.

<doc id="1108640" wikidata="Q1769333" url="?curid=1108640" title="Young Communist League of Norway">
<text>The Young Communist League of Norway (, NKU) was until April 2006 the youth league of Norges Kommunistiske Parti (NKP). The NKP declared on 1 April 2006 that the NKU was no longer its youth organization, and that all youths interested in joining the movement should contact the party directly. The NKU still persisted as an organization, however, and held a congress in the middle of May 2006, where it declared its wish to cooperate with the NKP, but also to continue on its own if necessary. At the same time the NKP organized a conference of their own, where they established a new youth organization for the party, with the same name and logo as the original NKU. This has led to a conflict over the rights to the name, logo, history, international contacts and property of the NKU, which lasted until July 2008. The conflict ended in court, where both the NKU and NKP were found responsible for the problems that had arisen. However, it was decided that the NKU still had the right to their name and logo. Therefore, the NKP&#x27;s re-established version of the Youth League, which had taken up several new members since 2006 had to change its name from Young Communist League of Norway (Norges Kommunistiske Ungdomsforbund) to Youth Communists in Norway (Ungkommunistene i Norge) and also change their logo. UngKom took over for the NKU as the NKP&#x27;s youth league and view themselves as an incarnation of the NKU.

After freezing the NKU&#x27;s membership due to uncertainty over the situation in Norway, the World Federation of Democratic Youth decided to admit both communist youth organizations in February 2010.

==History==
===1903–1940===
In 1903 in the city of Drammen as Young Social Democrats of Norway (NSU) as the youth wing of the Norwegian Labour Party. In 1923 they changed their mother party from the Labour Party to the newly formed communist party, which was formed following a conflict on the membership in Komintern.

In the 1930s, the youth league worked together with the communist party against strikebreakers, fascism and for the establishing of a national front to defend the country against fascism and nazism.

===1940–1949===
When World War II came to Norway 9 April 1940, the youth communists prepared its organization for illegal work in case the Nazi occupation lead to communist organizations being illegalized. This happened in August the same year, a month before the illegalization of the other political parties. In addition to the communists being the fascists&#x27; and nazis&#x27; main enemy, this happened because the communists were the only ones who refused to print Quisling&#x27;s statement of 10 April. By 16 April, communists urged armed resistance, while the other parties urged calm behavior.
Following the illegalization, the youth league&#x27;s resistance sharpened with the creation of some of Norway&#x27;s first illegal papers during the war When the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact of 1939 was violated, the Youth Communists intensified their activities further. In the period 1941–1945 the Youth League was part of numerous sabotage-raids against Germans and German-aiding production, several of their members also contributed directly in the war effort. One example of this is Dagny Siblund from Jacobsnes in Finnmark, northern Norway, who fled to the Soviet Union and received training there before being dropped in a parachute over Norway as Norway&#x27;s first female parachuter. When the war came to an end and the occupation was lifted, the organization had gained so much popularity that several of the Labour Party&#x27;s Youth Wing leagues joined the communist league instead.
In the next few years the youth league would disagree so much with the communist party that it resulted in an open political conflict within both organizations between the so-called Furubotn-fløy and the Løvlien-fløy.

===1949–present===
The youth league became less prominent in Norwegian politics as the communist party lost its seats in the Storting. In 1967 a right-wing faction in the youth league was excluded from the communist party, but the faction had majority control over the central part of the communist youth league resulting in the youth league suspending to be the youth league of the communist party. In response to this the communist party established a new youth league called Communist Youth (KU) which took the NKU&#x27;s seat for a couple of years until the NKU died out and they could reclaim the name and logo of the organization. The NKU again became the youth wing of the communist party.

<text>The Codemasters Software Company Limited (trade name: Codemasters) is a British video game developer and former publisher based in Southam, England, which is a subsidiary of American corporation Electronic Arts and managed under the EA Sports division. Founded by brothers Richard and David Darling in October 1986, Codemasters is one of the oldest British game studios, and in 2005 was named the best independent video game developer by magazine &quot;Develop&quot;. It formerly also published third-party games.

Codemasters Group Holdings plc was the holding company of Codemasters, which was publicly traded and owned Codemasters until being purchased by EA in 2021 for $1.2 billion.

== History ==
=== Background ===

While attending school in Vancouver, Richard Darling and his elder brother, David Darling, had learned programming with punch cards and had access to the school&#x27;s computer room outside of hours through one of the school&#x27;s janitors. Additionally, on weekends, they were allowed to use the Commodore PET computer owned by their father, James, to create a text version of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. Later on, the two brothers and school friend Michael Heibert, whose family possessed a VIC-20 computer, founded Darbert Computers and created video game clones of popular games, such as &quot;Galaxian&quot; and &quot;Defender&quot;.

The Darling brothers later returned to England, where they acquired their own VIC-20 and founded Galactic Software, again with the help of Heibert. An advertisement placed in the magazine &quot;Popular Computing Weekly&quot; caught the attention of Mastertronic, a British software publisher, and the two brothers quit their education to pursue development of budget-priced games for the company. These games included &quot;Space Walk&quot;, &quot;BMX Racers&quot;, &quot;Jungle Story&quot;, &quot;Orbitron&quot;, &quot;Sub Hunt&quot; and &quot;Pigs in Space&quot;. They also developed The Games Creator, a game-making tool that would later be sold commercially. The Darling brothers found success in making these games, gaining by the time they were 16 and 17 respectively. In 1985, the two owned a 50% stake in Mastertronic, which they proceeded to sell in March 1986 when they decided to become independent. By October 1986, the Darling brothers, with help from their father, had founded Codemasters. They initially worked out of the Beaumont Business Centre in Banbury, where their elder sister Abigail managed the front desk.

Codemasters&#x27; first game was &quot;BMX Simulator&quot;, a successor to &quot;BMX Racers&quot;. According to David Darling, the company aimed at making budget-priced games with the quality of full-priced games, as they would gain a larger customer base that would subsequently create better exposure. To produce more games in less time, Codemasters started hiring developers on a freelance basis. Products developed using this strategy include &quot;G-Man&quot; and &quot;Danger Zone&quot; by Mike Clark, &quot;Terra Cognita&quot; by Stephen Curtis, &quot;Super Robin Hood&quot; and &quot;Ghost Hunters&quot; by the Oliver Twins, &quot;Super Stuntman&quot; by Peter Williamson, &quot;Lazer Force&quot; by Gavin Raeburn, and &quot;ATV Simulator&quot; by Timothy R. Miller. By April 1987, Codemasters started seeking programmers that would create platform conversions of Codemasters&#x27; games in exchange for four-digit sums, via placements in &quot;Popular Computing Weekly&quot;.

=== 1990s ===
As the 8-bit computer market diminished, Codemasters turned to develop for the 8-bit and 16-bit console markets, as well as moving away from their budget title legacy to more full-price games on the 16-bit computers — 1992 saw the last title in the &quot;Dizzy&quot; series, &quot;Crystal Kingdom Dizzy&quot;, released at full price rather than budget price. They had major success with the &quot;Micro Machines&quot; series and &quot;Pete Sampras Tennis&quot; on the Sega Mega Drive. Both franchises featured the J-Cart, allowing two extra controllers to be attached to the game cart without requiring Electronic Arts&#x27; &quot;4 way play&quot; or SEGA&#x27;s four-player adaptor.

Codemasters is notable for making the large majority of games published by Camerica, which bypassed Nintendo&#x27;s lock-out chip by glitching it and produced unlicensed NES games. These NES games were known for being shiny gold and silver cartridges. Many Codemasters titles were also featured on Camerica&#x27;s Aladdin Deck Enhancer.

In 1990, Codemasters developed a device called the &quot;Game Genie&quot;, which came out of the lockout bypass work to play unlicensed games. It was a cheat cartridge for the NES, released in the US by Galoob and in Canada and the UK by Camerica. In the case Galoob v. Nintendo, Game Genie was determined not to violate Nintendo&#x27;s copyright under fair use.

In an effort to establish themselves in the United States, they announced that they would launch a new development studio in Oakhurst, using offices that were abandoned by Sierra On-Line and hiring much of Yosemite Entertainment&#x27;s laid off staff in mid-September 1999.

=== 1998–2009 ===
Between 1998 and 2003, Codemasters teamed up with Jester Interactive Limited to publish their range of music creation software, for PlayStation, PlayStation 2 and PC, &quot;MUSICtm&quot;, &quot;Music 2000&quot;, &quot;MTV Music Generator&quot; and &quot;MTV Music Generator 2&quot;. In 2003 this partnership was dissolved, with Jester releasing their own &quot;Music 3000&quot; product. Codemasters released their final music based product, &quot;MTV Music Generator 3,&quot; in 2004.

Codemasters have since continued to release titles for later generation systems, such as the &quot;Brian Lara Cricket&quot; series, &quot;Colin McRae Rally and Dirt&quot; series, &quot;Dizzy&quot; series, &quot;F1&quot; series, &quot;Grid&quot; series, &quot;LMA Manager&quot; series, &quot;Micro Machines&quot; series, &quot;Operation Flashpoint&quot; series, &quot;Overlord&quot; series, &quot;Project CARS&quot; series and &quot;TOCA&quot; series. They owned the rights to use the title &quot;Operation Flashpoint: Dragon Rising&quot; (2011), but have parted with the original developer Bohemia Interactive Studio. In spite of this, Codemasters released &quot;Operation Flashpoint: Elite&quot;, developed by Bohemia, for Xbox in October 2005. The year 2005 also saw the appointment of Rod Cousens, formerly of Acclaim, as managing director.

In December 2006, Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment entered into a game distribution agreement with Codemasters to distribute the company&#x27;s titles in North America. Also in April, Codemasters launched the massively multiplayer online role-playing game, &quot;The Lord of the Rings Online: Shadows of Angmar&quot; in Europe on behalf of Turbine. In June, Codemasters were purchased by equity group Balderton Capital and they changed their logo to an interlocked metallic C and M. Later that month they released the latest in the &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot; series, &quot;Colin McRae: Dirt&quot;. They also published &quot;Overlord&quot; and &quot;Clive Barker&#x27;s Jericho&quot;. Following the death of Colin McRae on 15 September 2007, Codemasters released a public statement expressing their sorrow and support for the family.

In March 2008, Codemasters announced a new partnership with Majesco Entertainment which would focus on titles for DS and Wii, including &quot;Nanostray 2&quot;, &quot;Toy Shop&quot;, &quot;Cake Mania 2&quot; and &quot;Nancy Drew: The Mystery of the Clue Bender Society&quot; for DS, and &quot;Wild Earth: African Safari&quot;, &quot;Our House&quot; and &quot;Cake Mania&quot; for Wii. In May, it was announced that Codemasters had won the rights to the Formula One licence after Sony&#x27;s deal ran out and thus ending Psygnosis and Sony&#x27;s &quot;Formula One&quot; series. The first resulting game, &quot;F1 2009&quot;, was released on the Wii and PlayStation Portable in November 2009, and another similar game, &quot;F1 2010&quot;, on the PC, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360 in 2010.

On 8 April 2008, Sega announced the closure of Sega Racing Studio. The studio&#x27;s only release had been &quot;Sega Rally Revo&quot;, which was greeted with fairly positive reviews but poor sales figures. At a later time Sega announced none of the employees were folded into internal studios. On 25 April 2008, Codemasters bought Sega Racing Studio. The studio was headed by Guy Wilday, who was involved in the &quot;Colin McRae Rally&quot; games and was formerly the series producer.

In the 2008 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, the Darlings were appointed Commanders of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to the video game industry.

=== 2010–2020 ===
On 5 April 2010, Reliance Big Entertainment, an Indian company acquired a 50% stake in the company. Later in 2010, Codemasters launched the free-to-play version of &quot;Lord of the Rings Online&quot;. While originally scheduled for 10 September, it was delayed due to contractual reasons and launched on 2 November. In May 2011, Codemasters transferred control of the European &quot;Lord of the Rings Online&quot; to Turbine.

In May 2011, Codemasters signed a North American distribution deal with THQ. In March 2012, Codemasters renewed its American distribution deal with Warner Bros.

On 3 June 2011, the Codemasters.com website was breached. It is believed that the attacker was able to gain access to the personal information of registered users with Codemasters accounts. Codemasters notified its users about the attack via email on 10 June 2011, after which their websites were pulled down and users redirected to their Facebook page.

In mid-2012, it was announced that Codemasters&#x27; racing games, whether about to be produced or developed, would begin to be branded under the &quot;Codemasters Racing&quot; label. &quot;&quot; and &quot;F1 2012&quot; were the first racing titles to receive the new label name. The label was discontinued in 2016, as Codemasters&#x27; subsequent racing games, &quot;Dirt Rally&quot; and &quot;F1 2016&quot; are branded with the regular Codemasters logo.

On 9 June 2013, Reliance Entertainment increased its stake in Codemasters from 50% to 60.41%, making it the majority owner.

In April 2015 Codemasters CEO Rod Cousens left to join Jagex, leaving COO Frank Sagnier as the new temporary CEO. In April 2016, Codemasters announced that they had hired most of the staff of racing game developer Evolution Studios after Sony closed the company.

The first Codemasters title for eighth generation consoles was &quot;F1 2015&quot;, launched in July 2015. In October 2015 they released &quot;&quot;, their first non-racing game since 2011.

After the disappointing sales of &quot;Onrush&quot;, several members of the Codemasters EVO development division were made redundant and the division was shifted to a support role for other titles.

Codemasters held an initial public offering to list the company on the London Stock Exchange&#x27;s Alternative Investment Market on 1 June 2018. The company&#x27;s shares were valued at 260 pence during trading bringing in a total of . As a result of the IPO, Reliance Entertainment held a 29.5% stake in Codemasters.

Through placings in June and November 2019, Codemasters welcomed new institutional shareholders to the register whilst providing Reliance with a highly satisfactory exit and thus ending their nine-year relationship with them.

Codemasters acquired Slightly Mad Studios, the developers of the &quot;Project CARS&quot; titles, in November 2019 for about . The acquisition brought the total staff at Codemasters to about 700 people.

The studio acquired the exclusive license to the &quot;World Rally Championship&quot; series in June 2020 which will begin as a five-year deal in 2023, with plans to release their first game in 2024.

=== 2020–present: As an Electronic Arts subsidiary ===
Codemasters announced in November 2020 that it had been approached to be acquired by Take-Two Interactive as a buyoff offer valued at . Codemasters said its board was ready to approve the deal, pending the required regulatory approvals and Take-Two&#x27;s own commitment once those approvals were granted. In the same month, both Take-Two and Codemasters agreed to a Take-Two buyout of Codemasters in a stock and cash deal around , which was expected to be completed by early 2021. Following the acquisition, Codemasters would have operated within the 2K label under its existing leadership. In a statement, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said that Codemasters&#x27; racing games would fit well with its own roster of sports games. However, Take-Two&#x27;s bid was subsequently trumped by Electronic Arts in December 2020, which offered to buy all outstanding shares at for an offer valued at about , about 14% higher than Take-Two&#x27;s offer. Codemasters&#x27; board of directors agreed to the EA deal, which closed by the first quarter of 2021. Take-Two formally withdrew its offer in January 2021, ceding to EA&#x27;s bid, while Codemasters&#x27; board signed off on EA&#x27;s bid later that month. The acquisition was completed on 18 February 2021, with all shares transferred to Codex Games Limited, a subsidiary of EA. EA&#x27;s Andrew Wilson said they plan to keep Codemasters as a standalone entity within EA similar to Respawn Entertainment. Codemasters announced in July 2021 that CEO Frank Sagnier and CFO Rashid Varachia will depart the company at the end of the month, as part of the EA acquisition plan. Special vice president of product development Clive Moody and of publishing Jonathan Bunney will take over leadership of Codemasters following this.

In May 2022, EA merged Codemasters subsidiary Codemasters Cheshire into Criterion Games, an existing subsidiary of EA, as to support effort on the &quot;Need for Speed&quot; series as the two companies were already working together on a new title in the series together for months, then later that year in October, announcing a new title called &quot;Need for Speed Unbound&quot;, which was released on 2 December 2022.

In December 2023, an unknown number of employees at Codemasters were laid off by EA.

== Technology ==
Ego is a modified version of the Neon game engine that was used in &quot;Colin McRae: Dirt&quot; and was developed by Codemasters and Sony Computer Entertainment using Sony Computer Entertainment&#x27;s PhyreEngine cross-platform graphics engine. The Ego engine was developed to render more detailed damage and physics as well as render large-scale environments.

<doc id="1108644" wikidata="Q1470731" url="?curid=1108644" title="Young Liberals of Norway">
<text>Young Liberals of Norway () (NUV) is the youth league of the Norwegian political party Venstre. Young Liberals was founded on 27 January 1909, with Anders Kirkhusmo as the first leader. The current president is Omar Svendsen-Yagci, since 2024. Vice presidents are Tejn Rolland and Emma Strandbakke, and the International Officer is Hans Fredrik Jacobsen. It advocates a more liberal version of the mother party&#x27;s social liberal ideology.

Young Liberals of Norway is a member of the international liberal youth organizations:
* European Liberal Youth (LYMEC)
* International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY)

==Name==
The Norwegian name &#x27;Unge Venstre&#x27; has historical reasons, and although it literally translates as &#x27;Young Left&#x27; in English, Young Liberals of Norway are not socialists, but in fact liberals. To avoid confusion, the official English-language name of the party is &#x27;Young Liberals of Norway&#x27;. Proposals to change the name of Unge Venstre to &#x27;Liberal Ungdom&#x27; (&#x27;Liberal Youth&#x27;) have been defeated in successive congresses.

==Policies of Young Liberals of Norway==
* The Young Liberals are strongly in favour of fighting climate change, calling it &quot;the greatest threat of our time&quot; on their website. As a result, the Young Liberals are in favour of helping renewable energy become competitive through subsidies, but believe that the market rather than politicians should determine which technology is best. The Young Liberals oppose the construction gas power stations without Carbon capture and storage, and opposes subsidies for polluting industries. The Young Liberals are also in favour of other types of environmental protection, such as hindering oil exploration of the coast of Lofoten due to the fragility of the environment.
* The Young Liberals are in favour of free trade, especially the removal of tariffs on the products of developing nations. This is seen as an integral part of achieving global economic justice rather than a threat to it.
* The Young Liberals are arguably the most pro-immigration political group in Norway, and advocate free labour immigration. The Young Liberals supports compulsory classes in Norwegian as a prerequisite for gaining citizenship.
* The Young Liberals are in favour of Norwegian membership in the European Union, and criticise the European Economic Area agreement as undemocratic because Norway is not represented when decisions regarding it are taken.
* The Young Liberals have recently become especially prominent in the debate on drug policy, and is advocating harm reduction policies. It is calling for legalization and regulation of all drugs. The youth party also advocates administration of clean heroin to drug addicts who have not succeeded in other means of rehabilitation. Furthermore, the party stresses that more resources must be spent on rehabilitation, health care and follow-ups for both previous and existing drug addicts.

==Relationship with Venstre==
Young Liberals of Norway are independent of Venstre but co-operates closely with them, for example the leader of Young Liberals is automatically a member of the central governing body (Sentralstyret) of Venstre. Venstre and Young Liberals have different opinions on some matters, most prominently in that Young Liberals of Norway supports Norwegian entry into the European Union while Venstre opposes this. The Young Liberals of Norway failed to make Venstre pro-EU during Venstre&#x27;s party congress in April 2009.

The Young Liberals are generally more liberal in their views than the mother party, both on social and economic issues. They aim to influence Venstre views so that they accords more with those of the Young Liberals. Notable recent victories include convincing Venstre to support heroin prescription in the treatment of addiction, to consider drug decriminalization and to support intellectual property reform.

== Organisation ==
Young Liberals of Norway is organized into 19 regional branches, with local clubs in about 50 municipalities. The highest decision-making body of the organisation is the yearly national congress. Between the national congresses, the organisation is governed by a national board and an executive board.

The executive board members of the Norwegian Young Liberals are:

* Omar Svendsen-Yagci (President)
* Tejn Rolland (1. Vice President)
* Emma Strandbakke (2. Vice President)
* Hanna Bakkelund
* Petra Engelien
* Iver Flyum-Bjørlo
* Thyra Håkonsløkken
* Sondre Undheim Lokøy
* Eric Monsen
* Brage Kåsa Skarstein
* Hans Fredrik Jacobsen
Secretary: 

* Dina Bovim (secretary general) 
* Daniel Wessel Grindflek

<text>Candid Records was a jazz record label first established in New York City.

==Early Candid Records==
The CANDID jazz label was founded in New York City in 1960 as a subsidiary of Cadence Records, owned by Archie Bleyer. The jazz writer and civil rights activist Nat Hentoff was the label&#x27;s (A&amp;R) director and, consequently, he attempted to create a catalog that represented the prevalent jazz music of the day. Hentoff also worked with the graphic designer and photographer Frank Gauna to create Candid&#x27;s distinctive album covers.

Candid&#x27;s catalog included Don Ellis, Abbey Lincoln, Booker Little, Charles Mingus, and Cecil Taylor. Later, the label was acquired by pop singer Andy Williams, who either reissued the catalog on his own Barnaby label or licensed them to foreign record companies into the 1970s and late 1980s.

==The Cadence-era Discography==

===The 34 Cadence-era LPs===

In 1964, due to its financial difficulties, Archie Bleyer opted to shut down Cadence Records, parent company of Candid Records and sold the complete &quot;Cadence&quot; catalog (inclusive of the Candid Records recordings) to the singer, Andy Williams, owner of Barnaby Records.

==Post-Cadence Italian/German/British Candid Records==

==Candid Records UK==

In 1989, the Candid recordings were bought by Black Lion Records, which reissued the vintage material on CDs and produced new recordings succeedingly. The new Candid Records (UK) catalogue expanded to include Greg Abate, Kenny Barron, Luis Bonilla, Art Hodes, Lee Konitz, Dave Liebman, Shorty Rogers and Bud Shank, Mongo Santamaría, Shirley Scott and a host of new jazz talent.

<text>Charles Butler McVay Jr. (September 19, 1868 – October 28, 1949) was an admiral in the United States Navy after World War I. In 1907–1909, after the round-the-world cruise of the Great White Fleet, he commanded the tender USS &quot;Yankton&quot;.

<text>Raon-l&#x27;Étape ( or ) is a commune in the Vosges Department in Grand Est in northeastern France.

Inhabitants are called &quot;Raonnais&quot;.

==Geography==
Raon-l&#x27;Étape is positioned at the mouth of the at the point where it converges into the Meurthe, itself a tributary of the Moselle. Because it is on departmental frontier with the adjacent Meurthe-et-Moselle département, Raon-l&#x27;Étape is sometimes known as the &quot;Gateway to the Vosges&quot; (&quot;porte des Vosges&quot;). The town is positioned at a point where relatively flat lands transform into a much more mountainous topography: the mountains have for centuries restricted the options for travellers between francophone France and Alsace (formerly the western reaches of the Empire on the other side of the Vosges). The position of Raon has therefore been critical to influencing the movements of merchandise in peace time and of armies in war time for many centuries.

Saint-Dié-des-Vosges is to the south-east while Nancy is to the north-west, in both cases tracking the national road RN59, much of which has in recent years been upgraded to quasi-autoroute quality. Taking a cross country route, Épinal is approximately to the south-west.

The little town is closely surrounded by woodland, which covers almost 60% of the communal territory.

The town has a long tradition of manufacturing in a wide range of sectors such as paper milling, quarrying, engineering, plastics, textiles, clothing and telecommunications. It is also a major commercial centre for surrounding communes, notably on Saturday mornings, Saturday being market day.

==History==

===The name===
An earlier name for the commune was &#x27;Ravon&#x27;, a word which in the local dialect denotes the confluence of rivers. &#x27;Étape&#x27; has mutated from the word &#x27;Tape&#x27; which was the name given to the right to transit the territory, obtained in return for a toll which was imposed on merchants, whether moving their goods along the river or along the adjacent road.

===Two settlements on either side of the Meurthe===
The old village was founded in the thirteenth century on the &#x27;champ de Rua&#x27;, near the confluence of the Plaine and Meurthe rivers, and dominated by Beauregard Castle which had been rebuilt and extended by Frederick III, Duke of Lorraine. The land was included within the territory of Moyenmoutier Abbey. The Dukes of Lorraine controlled the transit of salt and wheat towards the mountains, and imposed a &#x27;protection levy&#x27; on the &#x27;Saulniers Way&#x27;, a well frequented trade route across the mountains towards Sélestat and Saales.

The foundation of Raon achieved its economic objectives, attracting members of the mercantile class which was growing across Europe at this time. The application of the Beaumont Law in the little town enfranchised the merchants, providing an enhanced contractual basis for commerce. Geography also favoured commerce with the presence of two navigable rivers, and economic success was assured through civic privileges conferred by the dukes and through the security afforded by the growth of fortifications and the maintenance of a military garrison.

On the left bank of the river, the hamlet of La Neuveville dates back further, having been established during the twelfth century with protection and support from Duke of Lorraine by the cannons of Étival Abbey who provided both the necessary land and the expertise. The port at La Neuveville made it possible for loads of both processed and rough-cut timber to be exported along the river. The little town grew rapidly in size and wealth, and the white monks themselves reverted to a more contemplative existence, while the civilian administration of the dukes seized the initiative in founding Raon-l&#x27;Étape on the other side of the river which made it easier to protect transshipment across the river the important Saulniers Way trade route towards the mountains and The Empire beyond.

During the fourteenth century the civil influence of the monks declined at La Neuveville as the little town and its important port facilities came increasingly under the sole control of the Dukes, while the citizens continued vigorously to reject the pressing influence of Raon-l&#x27;Étape.

Neither town grew beyond a population of a few thousand, still separated into two settlements by their river, until the nineteenth century, but by the end of the seventeenth century they nevertheless had grown larger than Saint-Dié up in the mountains to the south-east.

In 1864 it was the left bank, and therefore La Neuveville, that was privileged to receive a rail connection on the line from Nancy. The railway brought industrialisation and also put an end to the transportation of timber by floating it down the river, which had contributed to the development of the little port for so long. Paradoxically, it was the prestige of Raon-l&#x27;Étape which in some ways benefitted more than that of La Neuveville: tourism began to evolve in France for the first time in the late nineteenth century, and the old right bank town with its picturesque medieval streets offered a quaint charm that replaced the industrial and commercial action that grew apace in its left bank rival.

The commune of today results from the merger in 1947 of La Neuveville and Raon-l&#x27;Étape into a single commune. Their strategic position meant that both towns suffered badly in the Second World War, and the remaining residents were strongly supported by humanitarian aid from, in particular, the Swiss Red Cross in the years immediately following the conflagration. The acting mayor of La Neuveville, who was a man named Capel, wondered if rebuilding a separate mairie was worth while at a time of severe economic hardship, given that the mairie of Raon-l&#x27;Étape now looked unnecessarily large for the diminished population level on the right bank.

The proposal to merge the communes was therefore essentially driven by the economics of the situation in which the communities found themselves: the responsible councils and the prefect were persuaded and the fusion of the former rival communes went ahead. Although the two communes had been intended by their founders as complementary settlements, long centuries of rivalry were not so easily set aside, and the different banks of the river continue to value their separate histories.

===Old Wars===

====The Thirty Years&#x27; War 1618-1648====
The closing decades of the sixteenth century and the first half of the seventeenth century were a particularly grim period for Lorraine and for much of Europe. The weather seems to have contributed an above average quota of poor or failed harvests, while the Thirty Years&#x27; War unleashed a catalogue of horrors, especially on the territories such as Lorraine that found themselves buffered between two great continental powers of that time, France and The Empire. Massacres, looting and executions were inflicted both by the locally recruited armies and by the hordes of the dispossessed that often followed in their wake. The Swedish armies, allied with the French, have a reputation for particular savagery in Lorraine during the time of Duke Charles IV. Two battles unfolded before the walls of Raon during the period. The first of them in 1635 found the troops of the recently defeated Duke of Lorraine confronting the French cavalry: on this occasion Lorraine prevailed. But in 1636 there was another battle in which the armies of Lorraine and their imperial allies were defeated. That same year Richelieu, the French king&#x27;s first minister, keen to minimise opportunities for Austrian resistance, arranged for the flattening of all the castles in Lorraine, including Beauregard Castle which for centuries has overlooked Raon. All the passing armies and successive battles left behind them only ruin and desolation. The local economy collapsed: famine and plague ensued. Lorraine was slow to recover. The statistical records show large numbers of people simply disappeared. Even in 1710, a census undertaken for Raon counted only 194 inhabitants.

====The French revolution and its aftermath 1789-1800====
For the most part. the violent and destructive manifestations of the French Revolution and the battles of the ensuing Napoleonic Wars occurred far from Lorraine, though the district suffered its share of economic disruption and the mobilisation of fighting age men. The administrative reforms that occurred across France put and end once and for all to the church-state partnership that had controlled the country for so long under the ancien regime, and left the civil state in control.

====The Franco-Prussian war====
After the French imperial army of Napoleon III was defeated at Sedan on 2 September 1870, and faced with the advance of enemy troops further south in the Vosges region, resistance mobilised rapidly, as disparate companies of Gardes Mobiles and of irregular guerilla fighters sprang to arms.

Several fighters were killed at a battle occurring in the Plaine Valley at a small settlement called Lajus on 20 September 1870, and the region experienced various skirmishes, small scale battles and other incidents including the taking and shooting of civilian hostages during and beyond the closing months of 1870. The most important battle took place on 6 October 1870 in the La Salle - Nompatelize sector (after which the battle would be named), at a gap in the mountains on the route towards Épinal. The battle was won by the Baden Brigade commanded by General Degenfeld.

After the Peace signed at Frankfurt on 10 May 1871, Raon was garrisoned by a battalion of the 9th Pomeranian Regiment who were initially billeted on the citizens, and subsequently installed in a barracks that was completed by the end of December 1871. On 14 November 1872 the Pomeranians were replaced by the 2nd battalion of Prince Albrecht&#x27;s 73rd regiment of Hanoverian Fusiliers. They administered Raon-l&#x27;Étape in collaboration with the civilian authorities without major incident. Nevertheless, the town was obliged to pay financial contributions / reparations totally 33,840 francs. On 30 July 1873 the occupation ended and the German troops withdrew towards Baccarat and the new Franco-German frontier to the north of Nancy. The departure of the soldiers unleashed much celebration in Raon.

==Visitor figures==
The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) publishes monthly visitor figures for the public sector museums and galleries which it sponsors, which include most of the leading museums in London.

The most popular London museum in the private sector is The Sherlock Holmes Museum.

The DCMS totals for the financial year to 31 March 2008 were as follows:


The majority of government-funded museums stopped charging admission fees in 2001 and, although this was challenged in 2007, this has remained the case. Following the removal of admission charges, attendances at London museums increased, with a large percentage of the 42 million annual visitors nationwide.

<doc id="1108654" wikidata="Q1769460" url="?curid=1108654" title="Red Youth (Norway)">
<text>Red Youth (; ; abbr. RU) is a Norwegian youth organisation. It is the youth wing of the Red Party, which was formed from a merger of the Red Electoral Alliance and the Workers&#x27; Communist Party in March 2007. The current leader of Red Youth is Amrit Pernille Kaur.

==Politics==
It is an organisation with three main principles: revolutionary socialism, feminism, and communism. Their goals are typically communist; they aim to organise the working class in preparation for what they perceive as an eventual overthrow of the capitalist system.

Red Youth believes that capitalism is primarily responsible for oppression, class divisions, and hunger. According to RU, a market economy leads to a situation where a minority gains the right to own society&#x27;s most important resources, resulting in private profit being prioritized over human needs. They argue that the exclusion of the economy from democratic control means that important decisions in economic policy are left to the market rather than to elected representatives. Red Youth believes that a capitalist society leads to a situation where the ballot must yield to money, and democracy gives way to plutocracy.

For Red Youth, communism is a social system aimed at abolishing both the state and private property in favor of the collective. The organization views communism as a society where classes and social gender roles are unnecessary. Their vision is for society to be organized as a community of free interests, collectively deciding how humanity&#x27;s creative potential can be utilized in the best possible way. As expressed in their program, they believe that such a society will not be without contradictions and problems. They argue that communism will not necessarily eliminate gender oppression, racism, and the waste of natural resources, but that the conditions for the structures that oppress people today will disappear. Red Youth does not believe that a communist society will mark the end of human development, but rather the end of oppression based on social and economic status.

Since the election of the Red-Green government in 2005, Red Youth has been working to push the Labour Party and the Socialist Left Party in a communist direction. In August 2008, a faction of communist dissidents left the youth organization to form Revolutionary Communist Youth, the youth affiliate of Serve the People.

==Activism==

Red Youth is an activist organisation, and has performed political actions and media stunts directed towards Norwegian politicians. Red Youth interrupted the Christian Democratic Party&#x27;s national meeting in 2004 in an attempt to expose and highlight what they perceived as the Christian Democrats&#x27; anti-homosexual attitude. Also in 2004, members attempted to &#x27;arrest&#x27; the Conservative Minister of Education, Kristin Clemet, for allegedly breaking the Norwegian law that secondary education must be free since students were still required to buy textbooks.

The Red Youth also built a refugee asylum in the garden of the Conservative Minister of Local Government, Erna Solberg, in 2008, as a protest against her immigration policies. In 2010, the Red Youth launched a campaign to collect 100,000 NOK to offer Siv Jensen, party leader of the Progress Party, to leave the country in response to her own party&#x27;s proposal to offer immigrants the same sum to go back to their own countries.

At the end of the 1990s and the early 2000s, Rød Ungdom (Red Youth) campaigned for free school textbooks. In the fall of 2001, Rød Ungdom made 14 school textbooks available for free download on the internet.

<text>Emerald City was a science fiction fanzine published in print and on the internet by Cheryl Morgan. She had assistance from Kevin Standlee and Anne Murphy. The magazine published 134 regular issues and 6 special issues between September 1995 and October/November 2006. &quot;Emerald City&quot; received several Hugo Award nominations during its run, winning once in 2004 in the Best Fanzine category.

==History==
Morgan began publishing &quot;Emerald City&quot; in September 1995, and the magazine contained numerous reviews of books and reports on the current state of science fiction fandom. The vast majority of the published material was written by Morgan herself, though several guest writers also contributed. Ending its run in November 2006, the &#x27;zine was published on a regular monthly schedule, Morgan having produced a total of 134 issues, all of which are still available for download in multiple formats. Morgan also maintained a popular weblog with current news related to science fiction and fantasy writing and publishing.

On August 1, 2006, Morgan announced on her weblog that &quot;Emerald City will be ceasing publication over the next couple of months.&quot; Subsequently, the September 2006 issue (number 133) was described on Morgan&#x27;s email list as &quot;The final(-ish) edition.&quot; A last issue, number 134, was published in November 2006. The closing lines were, &quot;Exeunt, pursued by a giant squid. / Best wishes, / Cheryl.&quot;

==Awards and honors==
In 2004, &quot;Emerald City&quot; won the Hugo Award for Best Fanzine. In 2005, Cheryl Morgan was nominated for three Hugo Awards: the magazine for Best Fanzine, Morgan herself for Best Fan Writer, and the web site for Best Web Site. Subsequently, Morgan declared &quot;Emerald City&quot; to be a semiprozine, and the magazine was nominated in 2006 for Best Semiprozine, while Morgan was again nominated for Best Fan Writer.

In 2008, after continuing to write at her personal website, cheryl-morgan.com, Morgan was nominated for another Hugo Award for best fan writing. She was again nominated and won 2009&#x27;s Hugo Award in this category. In 2010 and 2011, &quot;Clarkesworld Magazine&quot;, a semiprozine on which Morgan worked as non-fiction editor, was nominated and won for Best Semiprozine. On September 1, 2011, Morgan announced her withdrawal from the &quot;Clarkesworld&quot; staff as well as from several other genre projects.

As of 2011, &quot;Emerald City&quot; and Morgan as an individual have been nominated for a total of 10 Hugo Awards, with two wins. The two &quot;Clarkesworld&quot; wins brings her personal Hugo Award collection up to four rockets.

<doc id="1108662" wikidata="Q1929451" url="?curid=1108662" title="Open economy">
<text>An open economy refers to an economy in which both domestic and international entities participate in the trade of goods and services. This type of economy allows for the exchange of products, including technology transfers and managerial expertise. However, certain services, such as a country&#x27;s railway operations, may not be easily exchanged internationally due to practical limitations.

In contrast, a closed economy restricts international trade and finance with other countries. In an open economy, the sale of goods or services to a foreign country is known as exporting, while the purchase of foreign goods or services is referred to as importing. Collectively, these activities form the basis of international trade.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
Open economies offer several advantages to their citizens. One key benefit is that consumers have access to a broader variety of goods and services. Additionally, citizens can invest their savings in foreign markets, potentially offering better returns. However, open economies are also more interdependent with other nations, exposing them to risks from global economic fluctuations.

An open economy also allows a country&#x27;s spending in any given year to differ from its production of goods and services. This flexibility means that a country can spend more than it produces by borrowing from foreign sources, or it can spend less and lend the surplus to other nations.

== History ==
The concept of an open economy is closely linked to the idea of globalization, where individuals, businesses, and governments worldwide are increasingly interconnected. Historical developments such as the Silk Road, which facilitated trade between Eastern Asia, the Middle East, and Europe, and global conflicts like World War I and World War II, which fostered economic alliances, have played a significant role in the development of open economies.

Political ideologies have also influenced the development of open economies. Economic openness as a concept emerged in the 19th century, with two primary schools of thought. Critics argue that open economies may weaken national economies due to heightened competition, while proponents believe that openness encourages trade, fosters job creation, and boosts economic opportunities.

, no country operates as a fully closed economy.

<doc id="1108664" wikidata="Q1032188" url="?curid=1108664" title="Canadian Light Source">
<text>The Canadian Light Source (CLS) () is Canada&#x27;s national synchrotron light source facility, located on the grounds of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. The CLS has a third-generation 2.9 GeV storage ring, and the building occupies a footprint the size of a Canadian football field. 
It opened in 2004 after a 30-year campaign by the Canadian scientific community to establish a synchrotron radiation facility in Canada. It has expanded both its complement of beamlines and its building in two phases since opening. As a national synchrotron facility with over 1000 individual users, it hosts scientists from all regions of Canada and around 20 other countries. Research at the CLS has ranged from viruses to superconductors to dinosaurs, and it has also been noted for its industrial science
and its high school education programs.

==History==

===The road to the CLS: 1972–1999===

Canadian interest in synchrotron radiation dates from 1972, when Bill McGowan of the University of Western Ontario (UWO) organised a workshop on its uses. At that time there were no users of synchrotron radiation in Canada. In 1973 McGowan submitted an unsuccessful proposal to the National Research Council (NRC) for a feasibility study on a possible synchrotron lightsource in Canada. In 1975 a proposal to build a dedicated synchrotron lightsource in Canada was submitted to NRC. This was also unsuccessful. In 1977 Mike Bancroft, also of UWO, submitted a proposal to NRC to build a Canadian beamline, as the Canadian Synchrotron Radiation Facility (CSRF), at the existing Synchrotron Radiation Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, USA, and in 1978 newly created NSERC awarded capital funding. CSRF, owned and operated by NRC, grew from the initial beamline to a total of three by 1998.

A further push towards a Canadian synchrotron light source started in 1990 with formation of the Canadian Institute for Synchrotron Radiation (CISR), initiated by Bruce Bigham of Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL). AECL and TRIUMF showed interest in designing the ring, but the Saskatchewan Accelerator Laboratory (SAL) at the University of Saskatchewan became prominent in the design. In 1991 CISR submitted a proposal to NSERC for a final design study. This was turned down, but in later years, under President Peter Morand, NSERC became more supportive. In 1994 NSERC committee recommended a Canadian synchrotron light source and a further NSERC committee was formed to select between two bids to host such a facility, from the Universities of Saskatchewan and Western Ontario. In 1996 this committee recommended that the Canadian Light Source be built in Saskatchewan.

With NSERC unable to supply the required funds it was not clear where funding would come from. In 1997 the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI) was created to fund large scientific projects, possibly to provide a mechanism to fund the CLS. In 1998 a University of Saskatchewan team led by Dennis Skopik, the SAL director, submitted a proposal to CFI. The proposal was to fund 40% of the construction costs, with remaining money having to come from elsewhere. Assembling these required matching funds has been called &quot;an unprecedented level of collaboration among governments, universities, and industry in Canada&quot; and Bancroft – leader of the rival UWO bid – anckowledged the &quot;Herculean&quot; efforts of the Saskatchewan team in obtaining funds from the University, the City of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan Power, NRC, the Provincial Government of Saskatchewan, and Western Economic Diversification. At a late hour CFI told the proponents that it would not accept the SAL LINAC as part of the proposal, and the resulting shortfall was met in part by the spontaneous announcement by the Saskatoon city council and then Mayor Henry Dayday that they would double their contribution as long as other partners would. On 31 March 1999 the success of the CFI proposal was announced.

The following month Skopik took a position at Jefferson Lab in the USA. He decided not to stay on as director of the Saskatoon facility because his expertise was in subatomic particles, and, he argued, the head of the CLS should be a researcher who specializes in using such a facility. His successor was Mike Bancroft

===Construction: 1999–2004===

At the start of the project, all staff members with the former SAL were transferred into a new not-for-profit corporation, Canadian
Light Source Inc., CLSI, which had primary responsibility for the technical design, construction and operation of the facility. As a separate corporation from the University, CLSI had the legal and organizational freedom suitable for this responsibility. UMA, an experienced engineering firm, now part of AECOM, with extensive experience managing large technical and civil construction projects, was hired as project managers.

The new building – attached to the existing SAL building, and measuring 84m by 83m in area with a maximum height of 23m – was completed in early 2001. 

Bancroft&#x27;s appointment ended in October 2001 and he returned to UWO, with Mark de Jong appointed acting director. Bancroft remained as acting Scientific Director until 2004.

The SAL LINAC was refurbished and placed back into service in 2002 while the booster and storage rings were still under construction. First turn was achieved in the booster ring in July 2002 with full booster commissioning completed by September 2002.

New director Bill Thomlinson, an expert in synchrotron medical imaging, arrived in November 2002. He was recruited from the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility where he had been the head of the medical research group.

The 1991 proposal to NSERC envisioned a 1.5 GeV storage ring, since at this time the interest of the user community was mainly in the soft X-ray range. The ring was a racetrack layout of four to six bend regions surrounding straights with extra quadrupoles to allow for variable functions in the straights. The design contemplated the use of superconducting bends in some locations to boost
the photon energies produced. The drawback of this design was the limited number of straight sections. In 1994 a more conventional machine with 8 straight sections was proposed, again with 1.5 GeV energy. At this time more users of hard X-rays were interested and it was felt that both the energy and number of straight sections were too low. By the time funding was secured in 1999 the design had changed to 2.9 GeV, with longer straight sections to enable two insertion devices per straight, delivering beam to two independent beamlines.

Construction of the storage ring was completed in August 2003 and commissioning began the following month. Although beam could be stored, in March 2004 a large obstruction was found across the center of the chamber. Commissioning proceeded quickly after this was removed, and by June 2004 currents of 100mA could be achieved .

On 22 October 2004 the CLS officially opened, with an opening ceremony attended by federal and provincial dignitaries, including then-Federal Minister of Finance Ralph Goodale and then-Saskatchewan Premier Lorne Calvert, university presidents and leading scientists. October 2004 was declared &quot;Synchrotron Month&quot; by the city of Saskatoon and the Saskatchewan government. Peter Mansbridge broadcast the CBC&#x27;s nightly newscast &quot;The National&quot; from the top of the storage ring the day before the official opening. In parliament local MP Lynne Yelich said &quot;There were many challenges to overcome, but thanks to the vision, dedication and persistence of its supporters, the Canadian Light Source synchrotron is open for business in Saskatoon.&quot;

===Operation and expansion: 2005–2012===
The initial funding included seven beamlines, referred to as Phase I, which covered the full spectral range: two infrared beamlines, three soft X-ray beamlines and two hard X-ray beamlines. Further beamlines were built in two further phases, II (7 beamlines) and III (5 beamlines), announced in 2004 and 2006 respectively. Most of these were funded through applications to CFI by individual universities including UWO, the University of British Columbia and Guelph University

In March 2005 leading infrared researcher Tom Ellis joined the CLS from Acadia University as Director of Research. He had previously spent 16 years at the Université de Montréal.

The first external user was hosted in 2005, and the first research papers with results from the CLS were published in March 2006 – one from the University of Saskatchewan on peptides and the other from the University of Western Ontario on materials for organic light-emitting diodes. A committee was set up in 2006 to peer review proposals for beamtime, under the chairmanship of Adam Hitchcock of McMaster University. By 2007 more than 150 external users had used the CLS, and all seven of the initial beamlines had achieved significant results.

The CLS building was also expanded in two phases. A glass and steel expansion was completed in 2007 to house the phase II medical imaging beamline BMIT, and construction on the expansion needed to house the phase III Brockhouse beamline started in July 2011 and is still ongoing as of July 2012.

Bill Thomlinson retired in 2008, and in May of that year physics professor Josef Hormes of the University of Bonn, former director of the CAMD synchrotron at Louisiana State University was announced as the new director.

Science fiction author Robert J. Sawyer was writer-in-residence for two months in 2009 in what he called a &quot;once in a lifetime opportunity to hang out with working scientists&quot; While there he wrote most of the novel &quot;Wonder&quot;, which won the 2012 Prix Aurora Award for best novel.&quot;

By the end of 2010 more than 1000 individual researchers had used the facility, and the number of publications had passed 500.
From 2009–2012 several key metrics doubled, including the number of users and the number of publications, with more than 190 papers published in 2011. More than 400 proposals were received for beam time in 2012, with approximately a 50% oversubscription rate averaged over the operational beamlines. By 2012 the user community spanned all regions of Canada and around 20 other countries. That year a high school group from La Loche Saskatchewan became the first to use the purpose built educational beamline IDEAS. Also in 2012 the CLS signed an agreement with the Advanced Photon Source synchrotron in the USA to allow Canadian researchers access to their facilities.

==Science==

An international team led by University of Calgary professor Ken Ng solved the detailed structure of RNA polymerase using X-ray crystallography at the CLS. This enzyme replicates itself as the Norwalk virus spreads through the body, and has been linked to other superviruses such as hepatitis C, West Nile virus and the common cold. Its duplication is responsible for the onset of such viruses.

CLS scientist Luca Quaroni and University of Saskatchewan professor Alan Casson used infrared microscopy to identify biomarkers inside individual cells from tissue associated with Barrett&#x27;s esophagus. This disease can lead to an aggressive form of cancer known as esophageal adenocarcinoma.

Researchers from Lakehead University and the University of Saskatchewan used the CLS to investigate the deaths of Royal Navy sailors buried in Antigua in the late 1700s. They used X-ray fluorescence to look for trace elements such as lead and strontium in bones from a recently excavated naval cemetery

Scientists from Stanford University worked with CLS scientists to design a cleaner, faster battery. The new battery charges in less than two minutes, thanks to a newly developed carbon nanostructure. The team grew nanocrystals of iron and nickel on carbon. Traditional batteries lack this structure, mixing iron and nickel with conductors more or less randomly. The result was a strong chemical bond between the materials, which the team identified and studied at the synchrotron.

A team led by the Politecnico di Milano, including scientists from the University of Waterloo and the University of British Columbia, found the first experimental evidence that a charge density wave instability competes with superconductivity in high-temperature superconductors. They used four synchrotrons including the REIXS beamline at CLS.

Using the X-ray spectromicroscopy beamline, a research team led by scientists from the State University of New York, Buffalo produced images of graphene showing how folds and ripples act as speed bumps for electrons, affecting its conductivity. This has implications for the use of graphene in a variety of future products.

A collaboration between the University of Regina and the Royal Saskatchewan Museum has been investigating dinosaur fossils at the CLS, including &quot;Scotty,&quot; a Tyrannosaurus found in Saskatchewan in 1991, one of the most complete and largest T-rex skeletons ever found. They looked at the concentration of elements in bones to study the impact of the environment on such animals.

==Industrial program and economic impact==
From inception, the CLS showed a &quot;strong commitment to industrial users and private/public partnerships&quot;, with then-director Bancroft reporting &quot;more than 40 letters of support from industry indicating that [the CLS] is important for what they do&quot;. The CLS has an industrial group, within the larger experimental facilities division, with industrial liaison scientists who make synchrotron techniques available to a &quot;non-traditional&quot; user base who are not synchrotron experts. By 2007 more than 60 projects had been carried out, although in a speech in the same year, then-CLS director Bill Thomlinson said that &quot;one of the biggest challenges for the synchrotron...is to get private users through the door&quot;, with less than 10% of time actually used by industry.
In 1999 then-Saskatoon mayor Dayday stated that &quot;the CLS will add $122 million to Canada&#x27;s GDP during construction and $12 million annually after that&quot;. An economic impact study of the two financial years 2009/10 and 10/11 showed the CLS had added $45 million per year to the Canadian GDP, or about $3 for every $1 of operating funding.

The CLS has stated that &quot;the primary means of accessing the CLS is through a system of peer review, which ensures that the proposed science is of the highest quality and permits access to the facility to any interested researcher, regardless of regional, national, academic, industrial or governmental affiliation.&quot;

==Official visitors==

Then-Prime Minister Jean Chrétien visited the CLS in November 2000 during an election campaign stop in Saskatoon. He gave a speech on the mezzanine level of the building following his tour of the facility, praising the project for helping to reverse the brain drain of scientists from Canada. In August 2010 then-Governor General Michaëlle Jean visited the CLS as part of a two-day tour of Saskatchewan.
In April 2012 the CLS was &quot;visited&quot; remotely by Governor General David Johnston. He was visiting the LNLS synchrotron in Brazil, during a live link-up, by video chat and remote control software, between the two facilities. January 18, 2017 Canadian Science Minister Kirsty Duncan toured the complex.

==Medical isotope project==

With the NRU reactor at the Chalk River Laboratories due to close in 2016, there was a need to find alternative sources of the medical isotope technetium-99m, a mainstay of nuclear medicine. In 2011 the Canadian Light Source received $14 Million in funding to investigate the feasibility of using an electron LINAC to produce molybdenum-99, the parent isotope of technetium-99. As part of this project a 35MeV LINAC has been installed in an unused underground experimental hall previously used for photonuclear experiments with the SAL LINAC. First irradiations are planned for late summer 2012, with the results to be evaluated by the Winnipeg Health Sciences Centre.

This project lead to the founding a spin-off company — Canadian Isotope Innovations Corporation (CIIC), which was described as part of CEO Rob Lamb&#x27;s &#x27;legacy of accomplishment&#x27; when he departed the facility in 2021. The CIIC declared bankruptcy in 2024.

==Education program==

The CLS has an education program – &quot;Students on the Beamlines&quot; – funded by NSERC Promoscience. This outreach program for science allows high school students to fully experience the work of a scientist, in addition to having the chance to use the CLS beamlines.

&quot;The program allows students the development of active research, a very rare phenomena in schools and provides direct access to the use of a particle accelerator, something even rarer!&quot; said teacher Steve Desfosses form College Saint-Bernard, Drummondville, Quebec.
Dene students from La Loche, Saskatchewan have taken part in this program twice, looking at effects of acid rain. Student Jontae DesRoches commented &quot;Elders have noticed that the landscape, where trees used to grow, there&#x27;s none growing anymore. They&#x27;re pretty concerned because wildlife is disappearing. Like, here there used to be rabbits and now there&#x27;s none&quot;. In May 2012 three student groups were at the CLS simultaneously, with the La Loche students as the first to use the IDEAS beamline.

&quot;The aim for the students,&quot; according to CLS education and outreach coordinator Tracy Walker, &quot;is to get an authentic scientific inquiry that&#x27;s different from the examples in textbooks that have been done thousands of times.&quot; Students from six provinces as well as the Northwest Territories have been directly involved in experiments, some of which have yielded publishable-quality research.

In 2012 the CLS was awarded the Canadian Nuclear Society&#x27;s Education and Communication Award &quot;in recognition of its commitment to community outreach, increasing public awareness of synchrotron science, and developing innovative and outstanding secondary educational programs such as Students on the Beamlines&quot;.
==Technical description==

===Accelerators===

====Injection system====

The injection system consists of a 250 MeV LINAC, a low energy transfer line, a 2.9 GeV booster synchrotron and a high energy transfer line. The LINAC was operated for over 30 years as part of the Saskatchewan Accelerator Lab and operates at 2856 MHz. The 78m low energy transfer line takes the electrons from the below-ground LINAC to the ground level booster in the newer CLS building, via two vertical chicanes. The full energy 2.9 GeV booster, chosen to give high orbit stability in the storage ring, operates at 1 Hz, with an RF frequency of 500 MHz, unsynchronised with the LINAC. This results in significant beam loss at the extraction energy.

====Storage ring====

The storage ring cell structure has a fairly compact lattice with twelve straight sections available for injection, RF cavities and 9 sections available for insertion devices. Each cell has two bending magnets detuned to allow some dispersion in the straights – the so-called double-bend achromat structure – and thus reduce the overall beam size. As well as the two bend magnets each cell has three families of quadrupole magnets and two families of sextupole magnets. The ring circumference is 171m, with a straight section length of 5.2m. The CLS is the smallest of the newer synchrotron facilities, which results in a relatively high horizontal beam emittance of 18.2 nm-rad. The CLS was also one of the first facilities to chicane two undulators in one straight section, to maximize the number of insertion device beamlines.

All five of the phase I X-ray beamlines use insertion devices. Four use permanent magnet undulators designed and assembled at the CLS, including one in-vacuum undulator and one elliptically polarized undulator (EPU). The HXMA beamline uses a superconducting wiggler built by the Budker Institute of Nuclear Physics in Novosibirsk. Phase II added two further devices including another Budker superconducting wiggler, for the BMIT beamline. Phase III will add four more devices, filling 8 of the 9 available straight sections. Longer term development includes the replacement of two of the phase I undulators with elliptically polarizing devices.

Since 2021, the ring operates in a top-up mode during normal user operations, injecting every few minutes to maintain a stable ring current just below 220 mA. Prior to this change, the ring operated with a fill current of 250mA in decay mode, with two injections per day. Facility status is shown on a &quot;machine status&quot; webpage, and using the CLSFC account on Twitter.

==== Superconducting RF cavity ====
The CLS was the first light source to use a superconducting RF (SRF) cavity in the storage ring from the beginning of operations. The niobium cavity is based on the 500 MHz design used at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring (CESR) which allows potentially beam-perturbing high order modes to propagate out of the cavity where they can be very effectively damped. The superconducting nature of the niobium cavity means only 0.02% of the RF power put into the cavity is wasted in heating the cavity as compared to roughly 40% for normal-conducting (copper) cavities. However, a large portion of this power saving - about 160 kW out of the 250 kW saved - is needed to power the cryogenic plant required to supply liquid helium to the cavity. The SRF cavity at CLS is fed with RF from a 310 kW Thales klystron.

<text>The Ford Pilot (&quot;Model E71A&quot;) is a medium-sized car that was built by Ford UK from August 1947 to 1951. It was effectively replaced in 1951 with the launch of Ford UK&#x27;s Zephyr Six and Consul models, though V8 Pilots were still offered for sale, being gradually withdrawn during that year. In its production run 22,155 cars were made.

==Engine and running gear==
The Pilot was the first large post-War British Ford. It was based on the pre-War 22 hp Model 62 chassis, and was initially offered in 1946 with the 2227 cc side-valve V8 60 engine from the 1939 model. That engine proved inadequate for the vehicle size and was quickly replaced by the E71A Dagenham &#x27;Enfo&#x27; (English Ford) 30 hp engine. Dagenham cast its own version of the US 1937 Model 78, 21 stud, 30 indicated hp, 221 cubic inch/3.6 litre block and probably all ancillaries, most of which had Enfo part numbers. The E71A engine had a number of differences from the 1937 US engine. The block had one frost (core) plug at the rear on each side, just below the heads, the heads had the firing order cast in, the crankshaft had a long snout, allowing for the fitting of double pulley fan belts for trucks, and big end bearings were flanged 1/4 shells (4 per journal). The sump was also different, because it had a pear-shaped locating hole to accommodate the Lucas starter. Exhaust manifolds had a flowing design, which was an improvement on US versions.

The E71 30 hp 3622 cc engine developed , with a stroke of and a bore of , and was fed by a single Solex carburettor. The engine, with twin-sheave belt pulleys, was also used in Thames trucks.

The gearbox had three forward ratios and one reverse, and gears were changed by a gear lever on the steering column. Steering used a form of worm and roller mechanism called a Marles steering box, which had an &quot;hour-glass cam and a double roller&quot;. The car was considered old-fashioned even when new, but its front brakes were hydraulically operated. The rear brakes were cable-operated.

The Pilot was built with 6-volt Lucas electrics, including the starter &amp; generator. A twin exhaust system was standard, providing a quality sound.

The wide stud pattern wheels were the same as on 1936 to 1939 US cars. The front and rear brake drums were ENFO-made but had the same dimensions as the 1936 US Model 68.

Most Pilots were four-door saloons, based on the 1935 USA Model 48, but Estate (Shooting Brake (Woody)) versions were also built. The chromed brass front windscreen could be opened for ventilation, pivoted about a top hinge. Leather upholstery was standard, and the trim on all interior window frames and the dashboard was made of Bakelite plastic. Trafficator-type indicators were standard, and a hydraulic four-jack system was optional. Production ended in 1951 when Ford replaced the Pilot with the Zephyr.

Like other Fords of its era, the Pilot had vacuum-driven wipers powered from the engine manifold, with a vacuum reservoir tank to improve performance under load, whereas wipers on US cars without the reservoir tended to work much more slowly or even stop under full throttle or under load. The car was reputed to accelerate from 0 to in 21 seconds, have a top speed of , and return .

Commercial versions of the Pilot saloon were also offered, such as vans, pickups and some coachbuilders also built hearses upon the chassis. Some hearses based upon the Pilot had a lengthened wheelbase and increased length made by using imported American components. The Pilot vans and pickups were the only light commercial vehicle offered with a V8 in the UK, and although that greatly improved their speed and carrying ability, it was not economic for most fleet users. Thus, after the discontinuation of the Pilot range only the E83W models were kept on in production. Pilots were also exported to some European markets, including Norway, where a local company called &quot;Elverum Karosseriverksted&quot; converted them into ambulances.

==Australian assembly==

Ford Australia introduced the Pilot to Australia in 1949, importing the model in both fully assembled and semi-knocked down form. Initially dearer than the Canadian Ford Custom V8, its price was gradually reduced in relative terms until it was cheaper than the Custom. A coupe utility variant was also produced.

In fact the Pilot was sold new in Australia until well into the 1950s.

Such importation (along with that of the Ford Prefect and Anglia) was essential in maintaining a presence in that country after a refusal by the then-Federal Government to provide any direct financial assistance to produce a local car (this despite Ford providing a more detailed and comprehensive proposal than GMH, and despite the fact that many millions of pounds had been invested by Ford US in Australian vehicle assembly plants since 1925). Australian vehicles were also exported to New Zealand.
==Motor sport==
Ken Wharton drove a Ford Pilot to victory in the 1950 Tulip Rally and in the 1950 Lisbon International Rally.

<text>Lone Star is a 1996 American neo-Western mystery film written, edited, and directed by John Sayles. Set in a small town in South Texas, the film deals with a sheriff&#x27;s (played by Chris Cooper) investigation into the murder of one of his predecessors (Kris Kristofferson) decades earlier. The cast also stars Joe Morton, Elizabeth Peña, Clifton James, Ron Canada, Frances McDormand and Matthew McConaughey.

The film premiered at the 1996 South by Southwest Festival and received widespread critical acclaim, with critics regarding it as a high point of 1990s independent cinema as well as one of Sayles&#x27; best films. Sayles&#x27; screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award, BAFTA Award, and Golden Globe Award. The film was also nominated for four Independent Spirit Awards, with Elizabeth Peña winning Best Supporting Female.

&quot;Lone Star&quot; was recognized by the American Film Institute in AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 list in 2008 as a nominated Western Film.

==Plot==
Two off-duty sergeants stationed at a nearby U.S. Army post discover a human skeleton on an old Army rifle shooting range along with a Masonic ring, a Rio County sheriff&#x27;s badge, and, later, an expended .45 pistol bullet. Sam Deeds, sheriff of Frontera, Texas, begins an investigation. Texas Ranger Ben Wetzel agrees with Sam that forensics backs up the identity of the skeleton as Charlie Wade, the infamously corrupt and cruel sheriff who preceded Sam&#x27;s father, Buddy. Wade mysteriously disappeared in 1957, along with () in county funds. Buddy&#x27;s high reputation and election as Sheriff resulted from his being widely believed to have confronted the despised Charlie Wade on his corruption and driven him from town.

Frontera, on the banks of the Rio Grande, is a border town with racial strife among the Tejano, African American, Native American, and white populations, where the white population is no longer the majority. Sam holds that office because he is the son of the recently deceased Buddy. As a teenager, Sam hated and rebelled against his tyrannical father, leaving town as soon as he was old enough. Since his return to the town two years prior, Sam has chafed under constant comparison to the inflated reputation of the beloved Buddy.

The town is enlarging and renaming the local courthouse in Buddy&#x27;s honor and proposing the building of an unneeded new prison. Sam is skeptical about the use of his father&#x27;s name by local business leaders, such as Mercedes Cruz and Buddy&#x27;s former chief deputy, Mayor Hollis Pogue, to promote projects for personal profit using taxpayers&#x27; money. As a teenager, Sam had been in love with Mercedes&#x27;s Tejano daughter, Pilar, but the intimate relationship was strongly opposed by both Buddy and Mercedes, who took steps to separate them.

After a chance meeting in the present, the divorced Sam and the widowed Pilar, now a local teacher, begin to rekindle their lingering passion, again with staunch opposition from Mercedes who Pilar believes objects to Sam because he is white.

Colonel Delmore Payne has returned to town as the commander of the local U.S. Army post. Son of Otis &quot;Big O&quot; Payne, a local nightclub owner and leader of the Black community, Delmore has been estranged from his father since childhood, when the serial womanizer abandoned Delmore and his mother. When a quarrel involving a soldier from the base results in a shooting at Otis&#x27;s club—witnessed by the colonel&#x27;s own resentful underage son who is surreptitiously at the club to scout out his grandfather—Delmore confronts Otis and threatens to make his establishment &quot;off-limits.&quot; Otis counters that his establishment is the only place in town where Black soldiers are welcome. Eventually, Otis and Delmore come to an understanding, and develop a friendly relationship. 

Sam has always doubted the &quot;official story&quot; of Wade&#x27;s disappearance. Despite being warned by Hollis and prominent local figures not to poke into events 30 years ago, Sam doggedly investigates the events leading up to Wade&#x27;s murder. Wade terrorized the local Black and Mexican communities, extorting money from business owners and committing numerous murders by setting up his victims and shooting them for &quot;resisting arrest&quot;. In front of a horrified Deputy Hollis, Sheriff Wade murdered Eladio Cruz, Mercedes&#x27;s husband, who was running a migrant smuggling operation across the border without kickbacks to Wade.

Uncovering secrets about his father&#x27;s nearly 30-year term as sheriff, Sam discovers Buddy&#x27;s own corruption, kickbacks, and use of prison labor for personal building projects. He also finds out that Buddy forcibly evicted residents of a small community so a lake could be constructed, with Buddy and Hollis receiving lakefront property. Going through old boxes of Buddy&#x27;s papers, Sam discovers love letters from Buddy&#x27;s longtime mistress—Mercedes Cruz.

Sam confronts Hollis and Otis about Wade&#x27;s murder. Upon discovering Otis&#x27;s clandestine gambling operation at the nightclub in 1957, a furious Wade ordered Otis to hand over extortion money. Wade was about to use his &quot;resisting arrest&quot; setup to kill Otis when Buddy arrived, just as Hollis shoots Wade to prevent Otis&#x27;s murder. The three buried the body on the Army shooting range and took $10,000 from the county as an alibi for Wade&#x27;s &quot;abscondence&quot;. They gave the money to Mercedes, who was destitute after Wade killed Eladio, to buy her restaurant. Buddy and Mercedes became lovers months later. Sam decides to drop the issue, saying Wade&#x27;s murder will remain unsolved. Hollis is concerned that people will assume Buddy killed Wade to take his job. Sam replies, &quot;Buddy&#x27;s a goddamn legend; he can handle it.&quot;

Showing Pilar an old photo of Buddy embracing Mercedes, Sam tells her Eladio died 18 months before she was born, revealing Buddy is Pilar&#x27;s father. Both are appalled over the years of deception and repercussions, but since Pilar cannot have any more children, they decide to continue their romantic relationship, despite the knowledge that they are half-siblings.

== Cast ==
==Themes==
The film deconstructs the concept of borders, both in the literal and figurative sense. The film takes place in a border town (its name Frontera is the Spanish word for &quot;border&quot;), along the U.S.-Mexico border. In Frontera, figurative barriers exist between different racial and cultural groups, specifically the Anglo, Black, and Tejano communities. The film goes on to subvert the idea of borders, as it depicts literal border crossings (such as Mercedes and Eladio immigrating to Texas from Mexico), as well as border crossings in a racial, generational, and cultural sense.

Through its cross-cultural and time-spanning narrative, the film explores how people from disparate ethnicities and cultures are intertwined, past and present. Nuances and differences within and among specific communities are shown. For instance, Otis is African-American but is also of Indigenous descent. Pilar believes she is fully Tejano, only to discover she is half-white. The Tejano community itself has Mexican, Chicano, Mexican American, Spanish, Hispano, American and/or Indigenous ancestry. Mercedes is herself an immigrant from Mexico, but over the years has chosen to distance herself from that heritage, choosing to identify as &quot;Spanish&quot; and looking down on other Mexican immigrants.

The moral border between &quot;good people&quot; and &quot;bad people&quot; is likewise complicated, as Sam learns the truth about his father and some of his unsavory dealings. Sam is intent on unraveling the inflated myths that surround Buddy as an upstanding sheriff. He ultimately discovers that the father he despises is neither as bad as he has always believed him to be, nor as good as his burdensome legend depicts. Intergenerational borders that divide Sam and Buddy, as well as Otis and Delmore Payne and Mercedes and Pilar Cruz, are eventually bridged as characters learn various truths about their parents and repair the fissures in strained relationships.

Other themes include historical revisionism, mythmaking, and how legends are used to obscure inconvenient truths. The question of who gets to interpret history and why is most evident in the competing stories about Buddy, as well as in the classroom scene in which parents and teachers argue over the appropriate version of Texas history to teach high school students. In historical accounts of the Battle of the Alamo, it is often the heroic feats of Anglo figures like Davy Crockett and Jim Bowie that are celebrated, while the contributions of Mexicans, African-Americans, and Native Americans are relegated to the margins. Sayles stated he wanted the film to address the concept of historical revisionism, saying &quot;One of the things that &#x27;Lone Star&#x27; is about, to me, is the way in which American culture has always, always been many cultures. [But] in many places, the dominant culture gets to write the history.&quot;

The dismantling of myth is encapsulated with the film&#x27;s final lines, &quot;Forget the Alamo.&quot; &quot;Remember the Alamo&quot; is a famous battle cry that honors Texans&#x27; loss to the Mexicans at the Battle of the Alamo. The &quot;Forget&quot; line deconstructs the mythmaking behind the Alamo story and the barriers that separate Pilar and Sam—the racial barrier, as well as the barrier of their blood relation. In an essay for The Criterion Channel, Domino Renee Perez writes, &quot;The Alamo, both as a historical site and as a symbol, looms large in Texas mythmaking. But Sayles&#x27;s film is more about revealing the dark secrets behind, rather than building up, a myth—the myth of Buddy Deeds. Pilar and Sam&#x27;s resolve to forget represents a turn away from that legacy as they attempt to write their own futures, ones not beholden to any history.&quot;

Writers noted that the opening classroom scene of parents challenging teachers takes on a prescient meaning in regards to the contemporary political climate and controversy over critical race theory. In 2021, Texas passed a law that limits the manner and extent to which students learn about issues of race and racism in relation to American culture and history.

== Production ==

=== Background ===
John Sayles decided to make a film about the Texas border after going there in 1978 to shoot a cameo for an earlier film he wrote, and then visiting the Alamo in San Antonio, and coming up with a script that &quot;had elements of a Western, but it was more of a detective story. It was one of those rare instances where I wrote it and we got the money to make it right away.&quot;

=== Casting ===
Sayles cast newcomer Matthew McConaughey, whose biggest role prior to &quot;Lone Star&quot; was in Richard Linklater&#x27;s &quot;Dazed and Confused&quot;, in a major role because &quot;I needed a guy who didn&#x27;t have any star weight but who had the presence to play off against Kristofferson.&quot;

=== Filming ===
Filming took place on-location throughout southwestern Texas and along the Rio Grande, mainly in the towns of Del Rio, Eagle Pass and Laredo.

Sayles did not want to film the flashback scenes with visible cuts to the present-day scenes, and instead utilized pans so the transitions occurred within a single camera shot. These allowed the transitions to &quot;feel like it was just a flow like time or like [a] river&quot;. An example is the scene where a present-day Sam is seen in the same place in present day where he and Pilar have just strolled together discussing their past, and where Sam lingers to recollect a scene that took place on the same spot 23 years before between his 15-year old self and a 14-year old Pilar.

=== Music ===
Mason Daring″s soundtrack uses music from a variety of genres, including juke joint music, conjunto, and country music, to highlight the melting pot of cultures in Rio County.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Lone Star&quot; premiered at South by Southwest on March 14, 1996. It later screened in the Directors&#x27; Fortnight section at the Cannes Film Festival on May 10, 1996. It was released in North American theaters on June 21, 1996 and ultimately made $13 million at the box office on an estimated budget of $3–4.5 million.

===Critical response===
 On Metacritic, it has a score of 78 out of 100 based on reviews from 22 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

Writing at the time of release, Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, &quot;This long, spare, contemplatively paced film, scored with a wide range of musical styles and given a sun-baked clarity by Stuart Dryburgh&#x27;s cinematography, is loaded with brief, meaningful encounters... And it features a great deal of fine, thoughtful acting, which can always be counted on in a film by Mr. Sayles&quot;. &quot;All the film&#x27;s characters are flesh and blood&quot;, Maslin added, pointing particularly to the portrayals by Kristofferson, Canada, James, Morton and Colón.

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″s Kenneth Turan praised the film, writing its triumph is &quot;how well it integrates Sayles&#x27; [social] concerns with the heightened tension and narrative drive the thriller form provides&quot;. Film critics Dennis West and Joan M. West of &quot;Cineaste&quot; praised the psychological aspects of the film, writing, &quot;&quot;Lone Star&quot; strikingly depicts the personal psychological boundaries that confront many citizens of Frontera as a result of living in such close proximity to the border&quot;.

Roger Ebert awarded the film 4 out of 4 stars. His review read, &quot;&#x27;Lone Star&#x27; is a great American movie, one of the few to seriously try to regard with open eyes the way we live now. Set in a town that until very recently was rigidly segregated, it shows how Chicanos, blacks, whites and Indians shared a common history, and how they knew one another and dealt with one another in ways that were off the official map. This film is a wonder -- the best work yet by one of our most original and independent filmmakers -- and after it is over, and you begin to think about it, its meanings begin to flower.&quot;

Ann Hornaday, then writing for the &quot;Austin American-Statesman&quot;, declared it &quot;a work of awesome sweep and acute perception&quot;, judging it &quot;the most accomplished film of [Sayles&#x27;] 17-year career&quot;. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; writer Hal Hinson characterized it as &quot;a carefully crafted, unapologetically literary accomplishment.&quot;

In 2004, William Arnold of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot; said that the film was &quot;widely regarded as Sayles&#x27; masterpiece&quot;, declaring that it had &quot;captured the zeitgeist of the &#x27;90s as successfully as &quot;Chinatown&quot; did the &#x27;70s&quot;.

In 2020, Hornaday compiled a list for &quot;The Washington Post&quot; titled &quot;The 34 Best Political Movies Ever Made&quot;, in which she ranked &quot;Lone Star&quot; at number 10. Describing &quot;Lone Star&quot; as Sayles&#x27; masterwork, she wrote, &quot;A simultaneously epic and finely drawn intergenerational and time-shifting murder mystery set on the Texas-Mexico border, &#x27;Lone Star&#x27; interrogates history, narrative and tidal shifts in power through the lens of race and immigration, but never at the expense of their complexities. Timely when it first came out, today it feels more relevant than ever.&quot;

In 2024, &quot;Lone Star&quot; was rereleased in a brand new 4K restoration leading to further critical analysis of the film. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Peter Bradshaw lavished the film with praise, calling it an &quot;overlooked strand of indie movie-making and myth-making in 90s Hollywood, distinct from the brilliant ironies and shocks of Tarantino or the literary noir of the Coen brothers.&quot; He gave the film five stars saying &quot;it is thoughtful and complex and grownup.&quot;

===Accolades===

The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Screenplay for John Sayles. The film also won the Belgian Grand Prix, and the awards for Best Director and Best Screenplay from the Society of Texas Film Critics Awards. The screenplay was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award, a BAFTA Award, and a Golden Globe Award.

Elizabeth Peña won the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female and the BRAVO Award for Outstanding Actress in a Feature Film. The film was nominated for three Independent Spirit Awards: Best Male Lead (Chris Cooper), Best Film, and Best Screenplay.

The film is recognized by the American Film Institute in AFI&#x27;s 10 Top 10 list in 2008 as a nominated Western Film.

==Home media==
In 2023, The Criterion Collection announced they were releasing a 4K digital restoration of &quot;Lone Star&quot;, supervised by Sayles and cinematographer Stuart Dryburgh. The restoration was released on Blu-ray disc on January 16, 2024. The edition includes a new interview with Dryburgh and a conversation between Sayles and filmmaker Gregory Nava.

<doc id="1108698" wikidata="Q2464703" url="?curid=1108698" title="Burma Socialist Programme Party">
<text>The Burma Socialist Programme Party (BSPP) was the ruling party of Burma (now Myanmar) from 1962 to 1988 and the country&#x27;s sole legal party from 1964 to 1988. Party chairman Ne Win overthrew the country&#x27;s democratically elected government in a coup d&#x27;état on 2 March 1962. For the next 26 years, the BSPP governed Burma under a totalitarian military dictatorship, until mass protests in 1988 pressured party officials to adopt a multi-party system.

== Founding and programme ==
The BSPP was established on 4 July 1962, after the declaration of the &quot;Burmese Way to Socialism&quot; (BWS) by the Union Revolutionary Council (URC) on 30 April 1962. The BWS set out the political and economic ideology of the URC which had taken over power in the military coup of 2 March 1962.

The BSPP advocated a programme of the &quot;Burmese Way to Socialism&quot; which, according to Ne Win, incorporated elements of Buddhism, humanism, and Marxism. The programme was described by some scholars as anti-Western and isolationist. A booklet entitled &quot;Special Characteristics of the Burma Socialist Programme Party&quot; was published in January 1963 in both Burmese and English. The booklet distinguished the BSPP&#x27;s ideology from those of both &quot;bourgeois&quot; social democratic parties and communist parties. The BSPP, the booklet stated, rejected the &quot;bourgeois&quot; belief and practices of social democratic parties that socialism could be reached through parliamentary methods (even before the announcement of the BWS, the URC had already abolished, by decree, the parliament that was established under the 1947 Burmese Constitution, stating in effect that parliamentary democracy was not suitable for Burma). The booklet further stated that, although there was much to be learnt from the doctrines of Marx, Engels and Lenin, it did not regard their word as &quot;gospel&quot; unlike the Burmese communists, which the booklet referred to as &quot;vulgar materialists&quot;.

Later in the same year the BSPP elaborated on its ideology in a book published in both Burmese and English entitled &quot;The System of Correlation between Man and His Environment&quot;, commonly referred to simply as &quot;correlation&quot; (). The book used both Buddhist and Marxist rhetoric to espouse what came to be known as the &quot;Burmese Way to Socialism&quot;. Its most memorable line was borrowed from an old popular expression, &quot;One can only afford to be moral on a full stomach&quot;, which struck a chord with the people trying to eke out a living in increasingly dire economic circumstances under the rule of the BSPP. These economic conditions were a consequence of the policies implemented by the BSPP-led Socialist Economy Construction Committee (&quot;hsa sa ta ka&quot;), starting with the nationalisation of all businesses across the board.

== One-party state ==
On 23 March 1964, the URC issued a decree entitled &quot;The Law Protecting National Unity&quot; whereby all political parties except the BSPP were abolished and their assets appropriated. This was repealed on the day the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) seized power in the military coup of 18 September 1988.

The now-defunct 1974 Constitution of the Socialist Republic of the Union of Burma constitutionalised the BSPP&#x27;s leading role in Burmese politics. Article 11 of the 1974 Constitution stated that, &quot;The State shall adopt a single party system. The Burma Socialist Programme Party is the single political party and it shall lead the State&quot;. This provision merely formalised what was already a fait accompli—a one-party state—since March 1964.

All government servants from all sectors including doctors, teachers, engineers, scientists, managers from the nationalized industries and businesses as well as civil administrators were compelled to undergo a three-month political indoctrination and basic military training at the Hpaunggyi Central People&#x27;s Services Training School, accommodated in military barracks, starting in the early 1970s. The phrase &quot;socialist consciousness&quot; (, ) became a pun for socialist friend or connection that one must have to get anything or anywhere. The Military Intelligence Service (MIS) and its army of informers served the function of the secret police to sniff out and extinguish any political dissent.

== Cadre to mass party ==
In 1971 BSPP was opened up for mass membership as &quot;a people&#x27;s party&quot;. During the 1960s, there were three types of membership in the BSPP. The first type or tier was that of a &quot;friend of the party&quot; (). The second type or tier was &quot;alternate or provisional membership&quot; (, lending itself to mockery as means &quot;reckless&quot;) and the third type was that of a &quot;fully-fledged&quot; party member (). Under the party rules of the time once a person became a &quot;full party member&quot;, unless there were extraordinary reasons such as those of ill-health one could not &quot;resign from the party&quot;. A full party member could only be dismissed from the party. The BSPP continued to be dominated by the military, and in 1972 more than half of its 73,369 full members was still made up of army or police personnel; Dr. Maung Maung was notably the only civilian in the higher echelons of the party.

== Congresses ==
Prior to being transformed from a cadre party to a mass party, the BSPP held four seminars, the last one from 6 to 11 November 1969.
* The first Congress of the BSPP was held from 28 June 1971 to 11 July 1971
* The second in October 1973
* The third in February 1977
* The fourth in August 1981
* The fifth in October 1985
Extraordinary Congresses of the BSPP were held in:
* April 1973
* October 1976
* November 1977
* July 1988
* September 1988
At each regular Congress of the BSPP starting from June 1971 to October 1985, Ne Win was elected and re-elected by the BSPP as its chairman. Each Congress also elected a 150 to 200 member Central Committee and in the later Congresses a Central Executive Committee (roughly equivalent to that of the Politburo in one-party Communist States though the term &quot;Politburo&quot; was never used) of about 10 to 15 members were elected.

== Student wing ==

The URC merged the Union of Burma Boy Scouts and the Union of Burma Girl Guides Association in 1962 to create the coeducational Union of Burma Boy Scouts and Girl Guides (UBBSGG). The URC dissolved the UBBSGG on 1 March 1964 and turned over its assets to the Ministry of Education, which subsequently formed the Programme Youth Organisation (PYO; , ) as the UBBSGG&#x27;s replacement.

All students, from elementary to university level, were required to join the PYO. The organisation had three branches: The Glorious Youth (, ) for primary school students (5 to 9 years old), the Pioneer Youth (, ) for middle and high school students (10 to 15 years old), and the Programme Youth (, ) for college or university students and youths (16 to 25 years old). Upon reaching the age of 18 years old, members of the Programme Youth could apply to become provisional members of the BSPP. At the age of 21 years old, a provisional member could apply to become a full-fledged member of the BSPP.

=== Inspirations ===
Although the BSPP was anti-communist and neutral in Cold War politics, the student wings of BSPP were based on the model of the Young Communist Leagues of Eastern Bloc countries, particularly the Soviet Union&#x27;s &quot;Komsomol&quot;.
* တေဇလူငယ်: တေဇ (Teiza) has nothing to do with the meaning of its words, but it was the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; of Aung San (ဗိုလ်တေဇ, Bo Teiza), who was one of the Thirty Comrades. The photo of Aung San as Bo Teiza is their badge, and they wore blue scarf and uniform like children organizations from communist countries.
* ရှေ့ဆောင်လူငယ်: ရှေ့‌ဆောင် (Sheihsaung) is translation of Pioneer. It was formed as the pioneer movement. They wore school uniform and the red scarf like pioneer movement of communist countries.
* လမ်းစဉ်လူငယ်: လမ်းစဉ် (Lansin) means either &quot;programme&quot; (as in Burma Socialist Programme Party) or &quot;way&quot; (as in Burmese Way to Socialism) or &quot;path&quot; (as in Magga Path). They did not wear scarf, but top white and bottom blue uniform either westernized or traditional.

== Purge ==
In November 1977 a purge of the BSPP including those on the Central Committee took place. This schism in the BSPP was seen as a power-struggle or in-fighting between the military faction and the ex-communist faction (mainly consisting of some ex-communist rebels who had surrendered to the government, joined and risen in the ranks of the BSPP hierarchy and their sympathisers) in the BSPP. Among the thousands that were purged from the party were leftists or communist sympathizers.

== Crisis ==
An Extraordinary Congress of the BSPP was held from 23 to 26 July 1988. In his inaugural speech on 23 July 1988, party chairman Ne Win stunned the nation when he, &quot;taking indirect responsibility for the sad and bloody events of March and June 1988&quot; (whereby many students and civilians in largely peaceful protests against the BSPP regime were shot and killed by the Military Police &quot;Lone Htein&quot;) tendered his resignation as party chairman. Ne Win also announced that four of his colleagues vice-chairman and State President San Yu, General Secretary Aye Ko, Joint-General Secretary Sein Lwin and Member of the Central Executive Committee Tun Tin, also a Deputy Prime Minister, had expressed their desire to resign. Referring to the student-led demonstrations against the government in March and June 1988 Ne Win stated that these events indicated that some people &quot;don&#x27;t like the government and the Party that led the government&quot;. He also proposed that a nationwide referendum be held in late September 1988 to determine whether the people preferred the one-party system or wished to shift to a multi-party system.

== Fall from power ==
The BSPP Congress accepted the resignations of Chairman Ne Win and Vice-chairman San Yu but rejected the resignations of General Secretary Aye Ko, Joint General Secretary Sein Lwin and Central Executive Committee member Tun Tin. Joint-General Secretary Sein Lwin (former Brigadier, d. 9 April 2004) was chosen and appointed as the new Chairman of the Party by the Party Congress. The appointment of Sein Lwin, who was widely perceived to be mainly responsible for the shootings and killings of more than 100 students at Rangoon University on 7 July 1962, shortly after Ne Win&#x27;s coup d&#x27;état, as well as the killings of students and civilians in March and June 1988, earning the epithet &quot;Butcher of Rangoon&quot;, sparked widespread protests in the country.

The Extraordinary Party Congress of July 1988 also rejected Ne Win&#x27;s call for a national referendum. The election of Sein Lwin as Party Chairman as well as the refusal by the BSPP to take steps to move towards a multi-party system led to massive demonstrations to which the military responded by shooting and killing hundreds if not thousands of demonstrators in many towns and cities across the country from 8–12 August 1988. On 12 August 1988 Sein Lwin resigned as both Party Chairman and State President. After the selection by the BSPP Central Committee of Dr Maung Maung (31 January 1925 – 2 July 1994) as Party Chairman on 19 August and later by the &quot;Pyithu Hluttaw&quot; as State President on 20 August 1988, the uprising against the BSPP government intensified.

On 10 September 1988 in yet another hastily reconvened Congress, the BSPP decided to hold multi-party elections and the next day the Pyithu Hluttaw passed a resolution to hold multi-party elections &quot;not earlier than 45 days and not later than 90 days&quot;. However massive demonstrations in Rangoon and the rest of the country continued, demanding for the resignation of the BSPP government led by Dr Maung Maung in favour of a neutral interim government to supervise multi-party elections. On 18 September 1988 the State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC or &quot;na wa ta&quot;), led by the army Chief of Staff General Saw Maung (d. July 1997) took over after crushing the failed 8888 Uprising of 8 August 1988.

The party changed its name to the National Unity Party (NUP) on 24 September 1988. The NUP contested the 1990 general election and was seen as a proxy party of the military and the main rival to Aung San Suu Kyi&#x27;s National League for Democracy. The NUP was defeated in the election, but the results were not recognised by the military and subsequently voided.

<text>Direct-view bistable storage tube (DVBST) was an acronym used by Tektronix to describe their line of storage tubes. These were cathode-ray tubes (CRT) that stored information written to them using an analog technique inherent in the CRT and based upon the secondary emission of electrons from the phosphor screen itself. The resulting image was visible in the continuously glowing patterns on the face of the CRT.

DVBST technology was anticipated by Andrew Haeff of the US Naval Research Laboratory, and by Williams and Kilburn in the late 1940s. Tek&#x27;s (Tektronix) Robert H. Anderson refined Haeff&#x27;s concepts in the late 1950s to produce a reliable and simple DVST.

==Principle==
The DVBST implements two electron guns: a &quot;flood gun&quot; and a &quot;writing gun&quot;. The writing gun scans across a wire grid, charging the grid to create the negative image. The flood gun then floods the grid. Previously charged areas repel the incoming electrons so that electrons only pass through the grid to the phosphor in those areas not previously charged.

The technology offered several advantages and disadvantages.

===Advantages===
* No refreshing is needed. 
* Very complex pictures can be displayed at very high resolution without flicker.
* The cost is much lower.

===Disadvantages===
* They ordinarily do not display color.
* Selected part of the picture can not be erased.
* The erasing and redrawing process can take several seconds for complex pictures.
* No animation in DVST.
* Modifying any part of image requires redrawing of entire image.

==Applications==
Tektronix-made DVBSTs were used for analog oscilloscopes (first in the 564 oscilloscope, then the type 601 monitor (1968), the 611 monitor, the 7313 and 7514 plug-in mainframe oscilloscope, all from Tektronix) and for computer terminals such as the archetypal Tek 4010 and its several successors including the Tektronix 4014. Portions of the screen are individually written-to by a conventional electron beam gun, and &quot;flooded&quot; by a wide, low velocity electron gun. Erasure required erasing the entire screen in a bright flash of green light, leading to the nickname &quot;the mean green flashin&#x27; machine&quot;.

Some DVBST implementations also allowed the &quot;write-through&quot; of a small amount of dynamically refreshed, non-stored data. This allowed the display of cursors, graphic elements under construction, and the like on computer terminals.

== Skiatron ==

An alternate solution for storage tubes was the &quot;dark trace&quot; CRT, also known as the skiatron. This CRT replaced the conventional light-emitting phosphor layer on the face of the tube screen with a scotophor such as potassium chloride (KCl). KCl has the property that when a crystal is struck by an electron beam, that spot would change from translucent white to a dark magenta color. By backlighting such a CRT with a white or green circular fluorescent lamp, the resulting image would appear as black information against a green background or as magenta information against a white background. A benefit, aside from the semi-permanent storage of the displayed image, is that the brightness of the resultant display is only limited by the illumination source and optics.

The image would be retained until erased by flooding the scotophor with a high-intensity infrared light or by electro-thermal heating. Using conventional deflection and raster formation circuitry, a bi-level image could be created on the membrane and retained even when power was removed from the CRT. By using an array of dots, say 8 × 8, a larger pixel could be formed to represent 64 gray levels. One such device, the D36 Image Display, was made by DICOMED Corporation and a technical paper was presented at the 1972 Electro-Optical Conference in Geneva, Switzerland.

== History ==
The town was first mentioned in 1043 as &quot;Scirnbeci&quot;. From 1180, the Scharmbeck belonged to the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen. The monastery in Osterholz was founded in 1182 and persisted until 1650, when Lower Saxony became mostly Protestant. In 1648 the Prince-Archbishopric was transformed into the Duchy of Bremen, which was first ruled in personal union by the Swedish and from 1715 on by the Hanoverian Crown. In 1823 the Duchy was abolished and its territory became part of the Stade Region in the Kingdom of Hanover.

In 1927, the two communities of Osterholz and Scharmbeck were merged under the name of Osterholz-Scharmbeck and in 1929 town privileges were granted.

Between 1978 and 1992, 4,200 soldiers of the U.S. Army&#x27;s 2nd Armored Division (Forward) were stationed, and another 4,000 family members resided in Osterholz-Scharmbeck.

<text>A sandhill is a type of ecological community or xeric wildfire-maintained ecosystem. It is not the same as a sand dune. It features very short fire return intervals, one to five years. Without fire, sandhills undergo ecological succession and become more oak dominated.

Entisols are the typical sandhill soil, deep well-drained and nutrient poor. In Florida, sandhills receive of rainfall per year, just like the more hydric ecosystems surrounding them. Sandhills are xeric because they have poor water holding capacity.

Dominant vegetation includes longleaf pine (&quot;Pinus palustris&quot;), American turkey oak (&quot;Quercus laevis&quot;), and wiregrass (&quot;Aristida stricta&quot;). A number of rare animals are typical of this habitat including the gopher tortoise (&quot;Gopherus polyphemus&quot;), red-cockaded woodpecker (&quot;Picoides borealis&quot;), Sherman&#x27;s fox squirrel (&quot;Sciurus niger shermani&quot;), and striped newt (&quot;Notophthalmus perstriatus&quot;). Invasive species that are a problem on sandhills include Cogongrass (&quot;Imperata cylindrica&quot;), camphor laurels (&quot;Cinnamomum camphora&quot;), and Natal grass (&quot;Melinis repens&quot;).

<text>Cypress Mountain is a ski area in West Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, located in the southern section of Cypress Provincial Park, operated under a BC Parks Park Use Permit.

The ski resort is a 30-minute drive north of downtown Vancouver, and has 53 named alpine ski runs (many accessible for night skiing) and 19 km of cross country trails. Snowshoeing tours are also popular. Snow schools and rentals, Cypress Creek Grill, Gold Medal Cafe and Crazy Raven Bar and Grill and a Big Bear Sports retail shop are also located on the premises in the Cypress Creek Lodge.

Cypress Mountain hosted the Freestyle Skiing and Snowboarding events of the 2010 Winter Olympics, including SkiCross as a demonstration sport, and the first running of Snowboardcross as a Medal sport.

The ski area&#x27;s downhill runs are built on two mountains (Mount Strachan – and Black Mountain – , on a vertical rise of .

The resort is legally known as Cypress Bowl Recreational Limited Partnership, previously owned by Boyne Resorts, then sold to CNL Income Properties, then Och-Ziff Capital Management, but Boyne Canada has continued to run the ski operation for several years under a lease-back agreement. Boyne repurchased the resort in March 2018.

The ski resort name Cypress Mountain is derived from the name of the bowl between the three mountains, Mount Strachan, Black Mountain, and Hollyburn Mountain – &quot;Cypress Bowl&quot;, which was the original and still-used common name of the resort (the facilities by Cypress Bowl Recreations Ltd.). The term &quot;cypress&quot; comes from the yellow cedar tree &quot;Cupressus nootkatensis&quot; which is common in the park at altitudes over 800 metres, and is also known as yellow cypress, as well as from the name of the park in which the ski operation is located.

Despite the resort name, there is in fact no mountain named Cypress Mountain in the park.

==History==
In the 1870s, a logging road was cut through the thick forest on the mountain now known as Hollyburn Mountain. By the 1920s and 30s, multiple ski clubs had established themselves there, and the Hollyburn Lodge was built there in 1926. In 1951, the Hollyburn single person chairlift was built in the area; however it burned down in 1965.

On November 23, 1963 a Royal Canadian Navy T-33 Jet crashed while on a training flight near the present day Sky Quad chairlift on Mt. Strachan, killing both pilots. In 2014, a memorial plaque was erected at the crash site. 

The present day downhill ski area was initially opened by BC Parks in the 1970, after two Murray-Latta double-chairs, the Green chair and the Black chair, were constructed on Mt. Strachan and Black Mountain. The Cypress Bowl road leading up to the resort was completed in 1975, at the cost of $13 million. Night skiing was initially added in 1985 on those two chairs. In 1987, the Sky Chair was installed at the peak of Mt. Strachan, opening up new terrain and reaching the highest point on either mountain. The chair was a Mueller double relocated from Apex Mountain Resort.

Cypress was the first ski resort in BC to allow snowboarding, doing so on March 15, 1987.

Another double-chair, the Midway Chair, was installed in 1990 on the lower slopes of Mt. Strachan. In 1997, the original double chair on Mt. Strachan was replaced with a Poma fixed-grip quad, the Sunrise chair, following the same lift line. After Cypress was purchased by Boyne Resorts in 2001, the original chairlift on Black Mountain was replaced by the Eagle Express, a detachable quad chair built by Doppelmayr. Additionally, the rope tow in the beginners area was replaced with a fixed-grip quad chair, the Easy Rider Quad Chair.

In 2007, the Sunrise quad chair was replaced with the Lions Express Quad Chair. This reduced the ride time up Mt. Strachan by nearly half. The previous Sunrise chair was moved across to Black Mountain and was installed on new terrain, which opened 9 new ski trails. This chair is now called the Raven Ridge Quad Chair.

In 2022 Cypress closed the aging Sky Chair and built the &quot;Sky Quad&quot;, A fixed-grip quad lift with a loading conveyor belt. The lift opened December 18, 2022 according to social media posts. after delays due to a construction helicopter needing to conduct an emergency drop of a construction load due to unexpected sudden weather. No persons were injured during the mishap. 

== Climate ==
Cypress Mountain has a subarctic climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;) using the 0˚C isotherm or an subpolar oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfc&quot;) using the -3 ˚C isotherm. Summer days are mild with cool nights, while winters are long, moderately cold, and contain extreme amounts of precipitation.
== Amenities (Alpine skiing) ==
Cypress Mountain Resort has six chair lifts which include two high-speed detachable quad chairlifts (Eagle Express and the Lions Express), three fixed-grip quad chairs (Raven Ridge, Sky Quad and Easy Rider) and one double chairlift (Midway.) There is also a magic carpet and magic go round in the kids camp area and a tube park tow.

==Runs==
There are 53 runs including 5 green runs, 23 blue runs, 21 black runs, and 12 double black runs which 8 of them being glades. The longest run is a combination of runs, the T-33-Collins combination, which measures 4.1 km and the shortest run is the run Rideout, which measures about 10 meters. Below is a list of runs. 

== Amenities (Nordic skiing) ==
Cypress Mountain Resort is home to the only Nordic (cross country) ski trails in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, and is located on 30 minutes from the downtown core via car. The Nordic trails at Hollyburn Ridge provide a mix of terrain over 19 kilometers of groomed and track set trails with 7.5 kilometers of trails being lit for night skiing. Hollyburn Lodge (constructed in 1926, renovated in 2016) has a long and rich history supporting early backcountry ski enthusiasts, Nordic skiers, and snowshoers. Nordic operations elevation: 886 metres.

== 2010 Winter Olympics ==
During the Vancouver 2010 Olympic Winter Games, Cypress hosted all of the freestyle skiing and snowboarding competitions (moguls, aerials, ski cross, half-pipe, snowboard cross and parallel giant slalom). The half-pipe and the venues for the moguls and aerials were completed in the summer of 2007. Just before the games and due to unseasonably mild conditions, the ski resort was almost free of snow, where the snow had to be airlifted by helicopters and transported by trucks from higher elevations.

<doc id="1108737" wikidata="Q647984" url="?curid=1108737" title="Argo Records (UK)">
<text>Argo Records is a record label founded by Harley Usill and Cyril Clarke in 1951 with the intention of recording &quot;British music played by British artists&quot;, but the company&#x27;s releases expanded to include spoken word recordings and other projects.

==Genres==
Argo&#x27;s first issue, &quot;Music from Bali&quot;, was dedicated to the Indonesian gamelan (ensemble) recorded at the Winter Garden Theatre, London. The catalogue eventually ran to 1,000 items.

In 1953, Usill was introduced to Indian musician Deben Bhattacharya, who was responsible for field recordings of traditional music in India. Bhattacharya had been frustrated by the absence of recordings he could use for his BBC Radio broadcasts. Around the same time, Walter Harris recorded an amateur Brazilian choir in Rio de Janeiro. Such recordings as these appeared in the labels &quot;Living Traditions&quot; series.

Taking advantage of the capacity of the longer playing time of LP records, Argo embarked on recording the complete works of William Shakespeare. Cambridge University&#x27;s Marlowe Players participated in the series, which was the responsibility of Dadie Rylands, a fellow at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Recording began in 1957 and was completed by 1964. Initially professional actors had been reluctant to work for the project, but in time Judi Dench, Derek Jacobi and Prunella Scales participated.

&quot;The Poet Speaks&quot; series consisted of contemporary poets reading their work. It included Ted Hughes, Sylvia Plath, and Anthony Thwaite.

In 1954, the company recorded the &quot;Festival of Lessons and Carols&quot; (Christmas) service at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, a venue where the acoustics had previously defeated the abilities of engineers at other companies. A series of the masses of Joseph Haydn, initially recorded at the same venue, commenced in 1960, though after the first release with the London Symphony Orchestra, later recordings were made with the Choir of St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields under George Guest. One of their biggest sellers was &quot;Under Milk Wood&quot; featuring Richard Burton in the BBC production of Dylan Thomas&#x27; radio drama.

==Bought by Decca==
Argo was bought by British Decca in 1957. Usill remained in charge and the company was able to maintain autonomy from the parent company.

The company at this time recorded dramatised versions of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1958) and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, both directed by Douglas Cleverdon and both starring Jane Asher in the title role, with actors Tony Church, Norman Shelley, and Carleton Hobbs, with Margaretta Scott as the narrator; and &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; (1960), adapted and produced by Toby Robertson, with Richard Goolden as Mole, Frank Duncan as Rat, Tony Church as Badger, and Norman Shelley as Toad, with Patrick Wymark as the narrator. Another significant recording from this era is the premiere recording of Benjamin Britten&#x27;s one-act opera/miracle play for children, &quot;Noye&#x27;s Fludde&quot; (1961).

A series of recordings of steam locomotives (then in the early stages of being phased out in the UK) was masterminded by the film sound recordist and mixer Peter Handford, selling up to 30–40,000 copies per year under the name Transacord. It also did some other unusual pressings such as &quot;London&#x27;s Last Trams&quot; using early amateur mobile sound recorders.

The repertoire diversified into modern British jazz through the poetry and jazz movement of the early 1960s. This meant that recordings by pianist Michael Garrick were particularly well represented. The radio ballads of Ewan MacColl and Peggy Seeger, originally produced by BBC Radio (1958–64), were leased and issued by Argo from 1965. MacColl and Seeger also issued a 12-volume series of LPs called &quot;The Long Harvest&quot;, which featured variant British and U.S. versions of traditional ballads from the collection of Francis James Child. A small cluster of folk artists joined the label around this time, including Tom Paley (with his New Deal String Band), the Druids, the Clutha, the Songwainers, and the Garret Singers.

In the 1970s, Decca extended their children&#x27;s audiobook series the Railway Stories on the Argo label, with six further books (3 LPs) narrated by William Rushton. In 1974, they produced an abridged, dramatic version of &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, read by Nicol Williamson, and released the soundtrack to the film &quot;Tarka the Otter&quot; (1979), which featured Peter Ustinov&#x27;s narration and David Fanshawe&#x27;s music score.

The label passed to PolyGram when the conglomerate acquired British Decca in 1980. Harley Usill left the company and co-founded ASV Records. Argo as an independent entity ceased in 1988.

==Argo relaunches==
The label was relaunched in 1990 as an imprint of Decca with the intent to concentrate on choral, organ, and British and American classical music. Releases continued throughout the 1990s. The most recent release was in 1998.

After more than 20 years of dormancy, Decca announced that it revived Argo in July 2020 after partnering with HarperCollins&#x27;s imprint William Collins to release certain spoken word recordings, recently unearthed from the label&#x27;s archives, digitally for the first time.

The audio books (in cassette and CD form) continue in the Argo name but under a different logo.

The Argo catalogue is now controlled by Universal Music Group.

<text>Colin Purdie Kelly Jr. ( ; July 11, 1915 – December 10, 1941) was a World War II B-17 Flying Fortress pilot who flew bombing runs against the Japanese navy in the first days after the Pearl Harbor attack. He is remembered as one of the first American heroes of the war after ordering his crew to bail out while he remained at the bomber&#x27;s controls trying to keep the plane in the air before it exploded, killing him. His was the first American B-17 to be shot down in combat.

==Life==
Kelly was born in Madison, Florida in 1915 and graduated from high school there in 1932. He went on to West Point in 1933, graduated in the Class of 1937, and was assigned to a B-17 bomber group. He was the first Army officer to fly the Boeing Flying Fortress in the Far East.

==Battle and death==
On December 10, 1941 (December 9 in the United States), Kelly, with 14th Bombardment Squadron, 19th Bombardment Group, United States Army Air Forces was in command of B-17C Flying Fortress heavy bomber, #40-2045, which departed from Clark Field, on the island of Luzon, Commonwealth of the Philippines, alone and without escort, to search for an enemy aircraft carrier which had been reported near the coastal city of Aparri, at the northern end of the island. Kelly&#x27;s Flying Fortress had not been fully fueled or armed because of an impending Japanese air raid. It carried only three demolition bombs in its bomb bay. While en route to their assigned target area, Kelly and his crew sighted a Japanese amphibious assault task force north of Aparri, including what they believed was a &quot;Fusō&quot;-class battleship. The crew was unable to locate the reported aircraft carrier and Kelly decided to return to attack the ships that they had seen earlier.

Kelly made two passes at while the bombardier, MSgt Meyer Levin, set up for a precise drop. On the third run, Msgt Levin released the three bombs in trail and bracketed the IJN light cruiser &quot;Natori&quot;. It and an escorting destroyer, IJN &quot;Harukaze&quot;, were damaged during the attack:

...The battleship, actually the light cruiser IJN Natori, was seen about 4 miles offshore and moving slowly parallel with the coastline... A quartering approach to the longitudinal axis of the ship was being flown. The three bombs were released in train as rapidly as the bombardier could get them away. The first bomb struck about 50 yards short, the next alongside, and the third squarely amidship... A great cloud of smoke arose from the point of impact. The forward length of the ship was about 10 degrees off center to portside. The battleship began weaving from side to side and headed toward shore. Large trails of oil followed in its wake...
:— Narrative Report of Flight of Captain Colin P. Kelly, Air Corps, O-20811 (deceased) on Dec 10, 1941, by Eugene L. Eubank, Colonel, Air Corps, Commanding, Headquarters, 5th Bomber Command, Malang, Java, Feb 19, 1942.

On its return flight, the bomber was then engaged by the Tainan Air Group A6Ms which had been patrolling over Vigan. They attacked it, followed it, and attacked again. Kelly ordered his crew to bail out and though the fire had spread to the flight deck, Kelly remained at the bomber&#x27;s controls while he tried to keep the plane straight and level. Staff Sergeant James E. Halkyard, Private First Class Willard L. Money, and Private Robert E. Altman were able to escape from the rear of the B-17. The navigator, Second Lieutenant Joe M. Bean, and the bombardier, Sergeant Levin, went out through the nose escape hatch. As co-pilot Lieutenant Donald Robins tried to open the cockpit&#x27;s upper escape hatch, the Flying Fortress exploded. Robins was thrown clear and was able to open his parachute. Boeing B-17C 40-2045 crashed approximately east of Clark Field. The bodies of Kelly and Technical Sergeant William J. Delehanty were found at the crash site.

The wreckage was found along a rural road west of Mount Aryat (Mount Aryat is about east of Clark Field). The tail assembly was missing. Parts ... were scattered over an area of . The right wing with two engines still in place remained almost intact although it was burning when the search party arrived. The fuselage and left side of the plane were badly wrecked and burned. T/Sgt Delehanty’s body was lying about north of the wreckage. Kelly&#x27;s body ... was found very near the wreckage with his parachute unopened...

The attacking planes did not see this, and initially were credited only with a probable &quot;kill&quot;, shared jointly by Toyoda, Yamagami, Kikuchi, Nozawa, and Izumi. Saburō Sakai, who has often been credited with destroying this aircraft, was indeed a flight () leader engaged in this fight with the bomber, but he and his two wingmen do not appear to have been given official credit for its dispatch.

Early reports misidentified ship attacked as the Japanese heavy cruiser &quot;Ashigara&quot;, which was present, or as the battleship &quot;Haruna&quot;, which was not. While initial reports incorrectly stated that the ship was sunk, it was hit but did not sink, although Kelly&#x27;s crew did report major damage was inflicted.

==Honors==
Kelly was posthumously awarded the Distinguished Service Cross For &quot;extraordinary heroism&quot; and &quot;selfless bravery&quot;. Kelly had earlier in peace time also been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.

The United States Junior Chamber of Commerce posthumously gave its 1941 distinguished service award to Kelly on January 22, 1942, in Chicago. The award is given annually to the man under 35 years of age who has rendered the “most significant” service to the nation.

Aviation artist Robert Taylor painted a picture entitled &quot;The Legend of Colin Kelly.&quot;

On December 17, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt wrote a letter, &quot;To the President of the United States of America in 1956&quot; asking for an appointment for Kelly&#x27;s infant son. Colin P. Kelly III went to West Point, but did it on his own taking the examinations and declining the Presidential nomination. He graduated from West Point in 1963.

Colin P. Kelly Jr. Street in San Francisco, near Oracle Park, was named in his honor in 1942. The street had previously been named Japan Street. Colin Kelly Dr. in Dayton, Ohio, is one of many streets near Wright Patterson Air Force Base named to honor Air Force heroes. Colin Kelly Drive in Forest Acres, South Carolina, is also named in his honor, as is Colin Kelly Street in Cranford, New Jersey. Colin Kelly Rd in South Portland, Maine was one of multiple streets in the city named to honor WW II heroes.

The patriotic song &quot;There&#x27;s a Star-Spangled Banner Waving Somewhere&quot; by Paul Roberts and Shelby Darnell (recorded by Elton Britt) places Kelly alongside other legendary Americans in the line &quot;I&#x27;ll see Lincoln, Custer, Washington, and Perry, / Nathan Hale, and Colin Kelly too&quot;.{Published by Bob Miller, Inc., 1619 Broadway, New York, New York. Copyright 1952. Source:sheet music.

He is cited in the 1946 song &quot;Listen Mr. Bilbo&quot; by Bob and Adrienne Claiborne, sung by Pete Seeger, as along with Sgt. Levin &quot;foreigners like those kept America free&quot;.

The &quot;Four Freedoms Monument&quot; and Colin Kelly Highway, both in Madison, Florida, are dedicated in his honor.

Colin Kelly Middle School in Eugene, Oregon, was named in his honor in 1945 by the school&#x27;s first students, who preferred an &quot;ordinary Joe&quot; as a namesake, rather than prestigious military or political figures. The school colors are kelly green and white, and the nickname originally was &quot;Bombers.&quot; In 2009, the nickname was changed to &quot;Pilots.&quot; Since the naming in 1945, the school has been renamed to just &quot; Kelly Middle Schools&quot;. -Grayson W.

Colin P. Kelly Elementary School in Compton, California, is named in his honor. The school&#x27;s mascot is a plane and motto is &quot;soaring to academic excellence&quot;.

The Colin Kelly Heights public housing development, in the City of Tonawanda, NY, was named after him. This development was completed in 1943.

Colin Powell adopted the pronunciation after friends who were impressed by Kelly began pronouncing Powell&#x27;s name the same way.

<text>In economics, a country&#x27;s national saving is the sum of private and public saving. It equals a nation&#x27;s income minus consumption and the government spending.

== Economic model ==

===Closed economy with public deficit or surplus possible===

In this simple economic model with a closed economy there are three uses for GDP (the goods and services it produces in a year). If Y is national income (GDP), then the three uses of C consumption, I investment, and G government purchases can be expressed as:

* formula_1

National saving can be thought of as the amount of remaining income that is not consumed, or spent by government. In a simple model of a closed economy, anything that is not spent is assumed to be invested:

* formula_2

National saving can be split into private saving and public saving. Denoting T for taxes paid by consumers that go directly to the government and TR for transfers paid by the government to the consumers as shown here:

* formula_3

(Y − T + TR) is disposable income whereas (Y − T + TR − C) is private saving. Public saving, also known as the budget surplus, is the term (T − G − TR), which is government revenue through taxes, minus government expenditures on goods and services, minus transfers. Thus we have that private plus public saving equals investment.

The interest rate plays the important role of creating an equilibrium between saving S and investment in neoclassical economics.

* formula_4

where the interest rate r affects saving positively and affects physical investment negatively.

===Open economy with balanced public spending===

In an open economic model international trade is introduced. Therefore the current account is split into exports and imports:

* formula_5

The net exports is the part of GDP which is not consumed by domestic demand:
* formula_6

If we transform the identity for net exports by subtracting consumption, investment and government spending we get the national accounts identity:

* formula_7

The national saving is the part of the GDP which is not consumed or spent by the government.

* formula_8

Therefore the difference between the national saving and the investment is equal to the net exports:

* formula_9

===Open economy with public deficit or surplus===

The government budget can be directly introduced into the model. We consider now an open economic model with public deficits or surpluses. Therefore the budget is split into revenues, which are the taxes (T), and the spendings, which are transfers (TR) and government spendings (G). Revenue minus spending results in the public (governmental) saving:

* formula_10

The disposable income of the households is the income Y minus the taxes net of transfers:

* formula_11

Disposable income can only be used for saving or for consumption:

* formula_12

where the subscript P denotes the private sector. Therefore private saving in this model equals the disposable income of the households minus consumption:

* formula_13

By this equation the private saving can be written as:

* formula_14

and the national accounts as:

* formula_15

Once this equation is used in Y=C+I+G+X-M we obtain

* formula_16

By one transformation we get the determination of net exports and investment by private and public saving:

* formula_17

By another transformation we get the sectoral balances of the economy as developed by Wynne Godley. This corresponds approximately to Balances Mechanics developed by Wolfgang Stützel:

* formula_18

<doc id="1108756" wikidata="Q5944921" url="?curid=1108756" title="Hunting Island State Park">
<text>Hunting Island is a secluded semitropical barrier island located east of Beaufort, South Carolina, United States in between Harbor Island and Fripp Island. Since 1935, it has been classified as a state park. It is the most-visited state park facility in South Carolina and is a part of the ACE Basin estuarine reserve area. Known for its natural environment, the island remains one of the few remaining undeveloped Sea Islands in the Lowcountry. The park is known for its 19th century lighthouse which bears its name. The park&#x27;s beach has been featured in several travel publications and was listed in 2013 as a Top 25 beach in the United States by TripAdvisor.

==History==
Hunting Island retains its colonial designation of the &quot;Hunting Islands,&quot; which served as hunting preserves for Lowcountry planters and elite in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Hunting Island Lighthouse was constructed in the 1850s and soon thereafter destroyed by Confederate forces in the early days of the Civil War. Ten years after the Civil War ended the lighthouse was rebuilt, and later relocated to its current position. The 1893 Sea Islands hurricane swept Hunting Island and other nearby Sea Islands clean, but the lighthouse survived.

In the 1930s, the island was developed into a state park by the Civilian Conservation Corps as bridges were constructed to connect the outer Sea Islands with Beaufort. Thanks to limited human development, the island remains a preserve for its abundant wildlife. There are more than of beach, a dense maritime forest in the interior areas, and an extensive saltwater marsh on the western side. The most notable attraction is the 19th-century lighthouse, listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While not operational, the lighthouse tower features a rotating light in the tower that is turned on at night.

The southern terminus of U.S. Route 21 has been on Hunting Island since 1953. US 21 extended to the south end of the island until about 1980, when erosion destroyed a portion of the highway, forcing the state to create a new entrance to the park and a set of one-lane roads through the palmetto forest. US 21 now ends at the point where it formerly veered east toward the lighthouse.

Since 1980, Hunting Island has suffered major beach erosion as a result of heavy tides from the confluence of the Atlantic Ocean and Saint Helena Sound, and is expected to shrink in size by ten per cent over the next forty years. At times there is ride-able surf on the island, which is best three hours before high tide due to the large continental shelf effect on incoming waves.

In 1993, most of the Vietnam War scenes in &quot;Forrest Gump&quot; were filmed on Hunting Island and neighboring Fripp Island. Sequences from 1997&#x27;s G.I. Jane were also filmed in forests on the island.

In 2017, South Carolina purchased St. Phillips Island from Ted Turner, which is now operated as part of Hunting Island State Park, with a regular ferry to take tours of the island.

==Wildlife==
The wildlife includes loggerhead turtles, deer, alligators, raccoons, minks, diamondback rattlesnakes, and hundreds of species of birds. The island has an abundance of herons and egrets, as well as summertime sightings of the painted bunting. The interior lagoon (which was created by sand dredging in 1968) has become naturalized and home to such species as seahorses and barracuda.

Each summer loggerhead turtle hatchlings emerge from the sand and walk out to the ocean. Around 60 and 130 nests are laid annually on the beach. A volunteer organization, the Friends of Hunting Island has a permit from the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources to find and protect the nests. Each morning during nesting season, volunteers walk every mile of the beach to help find and protect nests.

==Facilities==
Hunting Island provides locations for recreational vehicles and tent campers on the northern portion of the island. There used to be many private cabins along Cabin Road on the south half of the island. They have all been destroyed by high beach erosion, leaving behind broken pavement and fallen trees, nicknamed &quot;The Bone Yard&quot; by local staff. The old ranger&#x27;s cabin, next to the lighthouse, has been updated and is now the only rental cabin on the island. All other dwellings are for staff. As of 2024, land on the island is being prepared for more public rental cabins, well away from the beach erosion.

A lagoon is adjacent to a washed-out cabin road and serves as a popular location for fishing.

Hunting Island Visitors Center is located in the middle of the island, overlooking a small lagoon. The center provides general information on the island, a virtual tour of the lighthouse, and has space for activities and offices for park staff. The center is also connected with Hunting Island&#x27;s extensive trail system and is a short distance to several beach access points.

The Hunting Island Nature Center features live animals and exhibits about the habitats and history of the park. The center is located at the entrance to the Paradise Pier fishing pier, which juts into the Fripp Inlet between Hunting and Fripp Island.

The lighthouse is open year round to the public when maintenance is not being performed. Visitors are able to climb to the viewing deck of the tower for a nominal fee. While not in true operation, a light on a thirty second delay has been installed in the lighthouse to provide the signature blink of the lighthouse.

Hunting Island&#x27;s of beachfront provide a pristine, natural experience for visitors. Although the beach is heavily eroded towards the southern end of the island, ample shore remains in the central section and in the campground areas towards the north end.

The state park also features several trails for hiking and biking, including a loop trail that cuts through the maritime forest and along the lagoon. The trail also connects to the Marsh Boardwalk, a popular stop for photographers. A short 5-minute walk leads visitors across a section of marsh onto a hammock and towards a deck along a tidal creek.

There are plenty of public restrooms and showers near the lighthouse and in the campground. There is a small snack and novelty shop near the lighthouse and a larger general store in the campground.

<doc id="1108758" wikidata="Q3502015" url="?curid=1108758" title="Hasse's theorem on elliptic curves">
<text>[[Helmut Hasse|Hasse]]&#x27;s theorem on elliptic curves, also referred to as the Hasse bound, provides an estimate of the number of points on an elliptic curve over a finite field, bounding the value both above and below.

If &quot;N&quot; is the number of points on the elliptic curve &quot;E&quot; over a finite field with &quot;q&quot; elements, then Hasse&#x27;s result states that

:formula_1

The reason is that &quot;N&quot; differs from &quot;q&quot; + 1, the number of points of the projective line over the same field, by an &#x27;error term&#x27; that is the sum of two complex numbers, each of absolute value formula_2

This result had originally been conjectured by Emil Artin in his thesis. It was proven by Hasse in 1933, with the proof published in a series of papers in 1936.

Hasse&#x27;s theorem is equivalent to the determination of the absolute value of the roots of the local zeta-function of &quot;E&quot;. In this form it can be seen to be the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis for the function field associated with the elliptic curve.

== Hasse–Weil Bound ==

A generalization of the Hasse bound to higher genus algebraic curves is the Hasse–Weil bound. This provides a bound on the number of points on a curve over a finite field. If the number of points on the curve &quot;C&quot; of genus &quot;g&quot; over the finite field formula_3 of order &quot;q&quot; is formula_4, then

:formula_5

This result is again equivalent to the determination of the absolute value of the roots of the local zeta-function of &quot;C&quot;, and is the analogue of the Riemann hypothesis for the function field associated with the curve.

The Hasse–Weil bound reduces to the usual Hasse bound when applied to elliptic curves, which have genus &quot;g=1&quot;.

The Hasse–Weil bound is a consequence of the Weil conjectures, originally proposed by André Weil in 1949 and proved by André Weil in the case of curves.

<text>Saint-Paul-de-Vence (, literally &quot;Saint-Paul of Vence&quot;; ; ) is a commune in the Alpes-Maritimes department in the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region of Southeastern France. One of the oldest medieval towns on the French Riviera, Saint-Paul-de-Vence is well known for its modern and contemporary art museums and galleries such as the Fondation Maeght, and for the 17th-century Saint Charles-Saint Claude chapel, which in 2012–2013 was decorated with murals by French artist Paul Conte.

Until 2011, the commune was officially called Saint-Paul.

==Notable people==
Saint-Paul-de-Vence has long been a haven of the famous, mostly due to the La Colombe d&#x27;Or hotel, whose former guests include Jean-Paul Sartre and Pablo Picasso. During the 1960s, the village was frequented by French actors Yves Montand, Simone Signoret and Lino Ventura, and poet Jacques Prévert.

Saint-Paul is also well known for the artists who have lived there, such as Jacques Raverat, Gwen Raverat and Marc Chagall and more recently the couple Bernard-Henri Lévy and Arielle Dombasle. Former Rolling Stones bassist Bill Wyman has a home there. American writer James Baldwin lived in Saint-Paul-de-Vence for 17 years until his death in 1987. British actor Donald Pleasence lived there until his death in 1995.

Former football player Vincenzo Rennella was born in Saint-Paul-de-Vence. Actress and artist Rebecca Dayan was raised in a hotel there.

American comic actors Gene Wilder and Gilda Radner were married in Saint-Paul-de-Vence by its mayor on 18 September 1984.

<doc id="1108772" wikidata="Q342489" url="?curid=1108772" title="Careca">
<text>Antônio de Oliveira Filho (born 5 October 1960), better known as Careca (), is a Brazilian former professional footballer who played as a forward.

During his career, Careca played for several clubs, most notably with Italian side Napoli. He was also capped over 60 times for the Brazil national team.

==Club career==
Careca began his footballing career in his home state of São Paulo with local side Guarani in 1978. With his finishing ability and devastating pace quickly established himself as one of his country&#x27;s best young strikers. With Guarani, he won the Brazilian Championship during his first season and the Brazilian Second Division in 1981.

By 1983 he had been signed by São Paulo, he continued to gather notoriety because of his impressive goals to games ratio and by 1986, Careca led São Paulo to the Brazilian Championship, beating his former club Guarani in the final. He was awarded &quot;Bola de Ouro&quot; the same year, which is the Brazilian equivalent of Footballer of the Year.

===Move to Napoli===
In the summer of 1987 Careca moved to Italian Serie A champions Napoli, where he was part of the &quot;Ma-Gi-Ca&quot; forward lineup with Bruno Giordano and Diego Maradona. Careca&#x27;s first season at Napoli was an unsuccessful one, despite his 13 goals: the team were knocked out in the first round of the European Cup by Real Madrid and they lost the title in the final games of the season.

However, his second season was far more successful. The team won the UEFA Cup, with Careca scoring a goal in each leg of the final, one a memorable lobbed goal, and finished second in Serie A, also reaching the Coppa Italia final that season. In 1990, Careca finally won the Scudetto with Napoli, following the success up with the first ever Supercoppa Italiana later that year. Careca spent a further three years with Napoli, establishing a partnership with Gianfranco Zola, during which Napoli failed to win any silverware.

===Later stages of playing career===
In 1993 Careca left Italy to play for new Japanese J.League team Kashiwa Reysol. Careca spent three years with the team, during which time he helped them to promotion to the J1 league in 1994. He returned to Brazil in 1997 with Santos, he spent a year with the club and another year with Cambinas (1998) before joining the lower-league team São José (RS), where he finished his career in 1999.

Careca retired having played 64 games for Brazil, and scored 30 goals.

Garforth Town owner and manager, Simon Clifford, persuaded Careca to play the majority of a friendly game against Guiseley in the summer of 2005.

===Footballing name===
The word careca is Portuguese for &#x27;bald&#x27;. It was a nickname given to Careca as a child because of his admiration for a famous Brazilian clown of the same name.

===Other Carecas===
Two contemporaries of Careca, who like him played for the Brazil national football team, were also called Careca and are thus sometimes confused with him: Careca II and Careca Bianchezi.

==International career==
Careca first broke into the national side of Brazil during 1982, but was forced to miss the 1982 World Cup in Spain due to a thigh injury suffered in practice three days before Brazil&#x27;s debut in that tournament. His place in the squad for that tournament was taken by Roberto Dinamite. He was also part of the Brazilian squad that came in second in the 1983 Copa América.

It was during the 1986 World Cup, in Mexico, that Careca really established himself in world football. He ended the tournament, during which Brazil were memorably eliminated on penalties by France at the quarter-final stage, with five goals which placed him second in the Golden Boot rankings behind England&#x27;s Gary Lineker. In 1990, Careca was part of the Brazilian team that was defeated by Argentina in the second round. He scored two goals in the tournament. His last cap was earned in August 1993.

==Style of play==
Careca is regarded as one of the greatest strikers in the history of Brazilian football. He was a prolific, fast, opportunistic, and powerful striker, with excellent technique and great striking ability. Despite being right-footed, he was also capable of scoring with his left foot, and he was known for his ability to score goals off-balance from angled shots even when running with the ball. Careca was also good in the air, and he had an excellent positional sense, which along with his intelligence, sense of space, and attacking movement, made him known for frequently being in the right position at the right time in the penalty area. Although he was usually deployed as a striker, he was also capable of playing in deeper positions, as a creative forward, due to his ability to play off of his teammates and provide them with assists, as well as his tendency to make attacking runs starting from outside the area in order to create space for other players. After scoring a goal, Careca often celebrated by mimicking an aeroplane&#x27;s wings with his arms outstretched.
