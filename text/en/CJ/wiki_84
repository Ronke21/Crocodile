==History==

===Lembaga Letrik Pusat (1949–1965)===
The &quot;Lembaga Letrik Pusat&quot; (Central Electricity Board, CEB) was established and came into operation on 1 September 1949. The Board was to become heir to three major projects considered by the Electricity Department following its re-establishment in April 1946 which were the Connaught Bridge Power Station, Cameron Highlands Hydroelectric Project and the development of a National Grid. CEB eventually became the owner of 34 power stations with a generation capacity of 39.88 MW, including a steam power station in Bangsar with a capacity of 26.5 MW, a hydroelectric power station at Ulu Langat with a capacity of 2.28 MW, and various diesel powered generators with a total capacity of 11.1 MW.

===Lembaga Letrik Negara (1965–1990)===
On 22 June 1965, Central Electricity Board (CEB) of the Federation of Malaya was renamed the &quot;Lembaga Letrik Negara&quot; (National Electricity Board, NEB) of the States of Malaya. By the 1980s, the Board was supplying the whole peninsula with electricity, replacing the Perak River Hydro Electric Power company (PRHEP) and its subsidiary Kinta Electrical Distribution Co. Ltd (KED) in 1982, Penang Municipality in 1976, and areas supplied by Huttenbach Ltd in 1964, which included Alor Setar, Sungai Petani, Kulim, Lunas, Padang Serai, Telok Anson, Langkap, Tampin and Kuala Pilah.

On 4 May 1988, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad announced the government&#x27;s decision on a policy of privatisation. Two pieces of legislation were passed to replace the Electricity Act and to provide for the establishment of a new corporation. Tenaga Nasional Berhad (TNB) was formed in 1990 by the Electricity Supply Successor Company Act 1990, to succeed the National Electricity Board (NEB) of the States of Malaya.

<doc id="1110351" wikidata="Q2917890" url="?curid=1110351" title="Mauro Mina">
<text>Mauro Mina Baylón (November 22, 1933 – June 1, 1993) was a Peruvian Light Heavyweight boxer known as the &quot;Bombardero de Chincha&quot;, remembered as the best Peruvian boxer of the twentieth century.

He was born in Chincha on November 22, 1933. It had been a long road for Mina. He began life in a rural African-Peruvian community, was a child worker in Chincha, Peru and struggled as a young man in Lima before becoming a professional boxer. As his career and fame progressed, he became the toast of the city, the hope of Peru and a national symbol in a fragmented society.

== Boxing career ==
As an amateur he obtained the Latin American championship in the middleweight division in February 1952 in Lima, Peru. He started boxing professionally at the age of 22 defeating Chilean Manuel Vargas in 10 rounds on October 22, 1955. After a few fights in Lima, he had his first loss against Luiz Ignacio, in São Paulo.

After the loss to the Brazilian Mina won five straight fights before challenging Uruguayan Dogomar Martinez for the South American Light Heavyweight Title in October 1958. The fight was held in Montevideo, Uruguay and Martinez came out a victorious on a close decision to retain his title.

After that fight, Mina would not lose again for the next eight years of his career. In 1960 he was proclaimed South American Light Heavyweight Champion, a title he held until he vacated it in 1966. He was a new talent that arrived on the U.S. boxing scene in the 60s. Mauro Mina had become one of the best light heavyweights in the world by fighting exclusively in South America. Just one more obstacle stood between him and international stardom. He continued boxing and winning during the 60s in fights against Gregorio &quot;Goyo&quot; Peralta, Freddie Mack, Sugar Boy Nando, Guillermo Dutschmann, Henry Hank, Eddie Cotton all of which he won. He also won a fight against future champion Bob Foster, in 1963.

In 1962, after defeating Eddie Cotton by decision in 10 rounds in Lima, he had been ranked the number one contender by the prestigious Ring Magazine. He was ready for a shot at the Light Heavyweight title held by Harold Johnson but the discovery of a retinal injury acquired in one of his previous fights (allegedly against Cuban Lino Rendon) prevented such challenge from ever taking place.

== After Boxing ==
After his retirement in 1965, he became a boxing professor in his own gym, and is remembered as a former glory in Peru. He had even a song composed to him by Peruvian singer Chabuca Granda, called &quot;Puños de Oro&quot;.

He died in 1993 from a heart attack with a professional record of 58 fights, of which he won 52 (25 by KO), Lost 3, and Drew 3.</text><links>

<doc id="1110353" wikidata="Q745103" url="?curid=1110353" title="Bob Jones University v. United States">
<text>Bob Jones University v. United States, 461 U.S. 574 (1983), was a decision by the United States Supreme Court holding that the religion clauses of the First Amendment did not prohibit the Internal Revenue Service from revoking the tax exempt status of a religious university whose practices are contrary to a compelling government public policy, such as eradicating racial discrimination.

== Background ==
Because of its interpretation of Biblical principles regarding interracial dating, Bob Jones University completely excluded black applicants until 1971, and from 1971 until 1975, admitted black students only if they were married. After 1975, the university began to admit unmarried black applicants, but continued to deny &quot;admission to applicants engaged in an interracial marriage or known to advocate interracial marriage or dating.&quot; The university also imposed a disciplinary rule that prohibited interracial dating.

Under pre-1970 IRS regulations, tax exemptions were awarded to private schools regardless of their racial admissions policies, and Bob Jones University was approved for a tax exemption under that policy. Pursuant to a 1970 revision to IRS regulations that limited tax-exempt status to private schools without racially discriminatory admissions policies, the IRS informed the University on November 30, 1970, that the IRS was planning on revoking its tax exempt status as a &quot;religious, charitable . . . or educational&quot; institution. In response, the university filed suit in 1971 in &quot;Bob Jones University v. Schultz.&quot;

The United States District Court for the District of South Carolina granted a preliminary injunction, but the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed in 1973, citing the Anti-Injunction Act.

The university petitioned for a rehearing in the Appeals Court in &quot;Bob Jones University v. Connally.&quot; The Appeals Court ruled March 21, 1973, stating that &quot;Americans United v. Walters&quot; did not conflict with the decision in 1973.

The Supreme Court affirmed the Court of Appeals decision in &quot;Bob Jones University v. Simon&quot; (416 US 725). The case was decided May 15, 1974, in an 8–0 decision (Douglas not participating). They stated that there was a lack of proof of &quot;irreparable injury.&quot; Justice Powell wrote the decision.

The IRS again notified the University on April 16, 1975, of the proposed revocation. Officially, the IRS revoked the university&#x27;s tax exempt status on January 19, 1976. The university paid $21 in unemployment taxes for one employee for tax year 1975 and then filed for a refund in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina. The Government counterclaimed for unpaid federal unemployment taxes for the taxable years 1971 through 1975, in the amount of $489,675.59, plus interest.

The District Court ruled December 26, 1978, that the IRS had violated the university&#x27;s First Amendment rights, and ordered the IRS to refund the university the $21 of taxes that it had paid.

The United States Court of Appeals of the Fourth Circuit ruled that the case be sent back to the District Court.

== Supreme Court decision ==
&quot;Bob Jones University v. United States&quot; was decided May 24, 1983, in an 8–1 decision with majority opinion written by Warren E. Burger, and joined by William J. Brennan, Byron R. White, Thurgood Marshall, Harry A. Blackmun, John Paul Stevens, and Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor. The Court, speaking through Burger, read a &quot;common law&quot; public interest requirement into the statute governing tax-exempt charitable status based on IRS Revenue Ruling 71-447, and cited Congress&#x27; refusal to intervene as proof that they approved of the IRS&#x27;s construction of the statute. The Court applied a strict scrutiny analysis and found that the &quot;Government has a fundamental, overriding interest in eradicating racial discrimination in education . . . which substantially outweighs whatever burden denial of tax benefits places on [the University&#x27;s] exercise of their religious beliefs.&quot; The Court made clear, however, that its holding dealt &quot;only with religious schools—not with churches or other purely religious institutions.&quot;

Lewis F. Powell wrote a separate concurring opinion, emphasizing the importance of Congressional approval for administrative policy changes. William H. Rehnquist was the sole dissenter, arguing that the literal terms of the governing statute could not be read to exclude Bob Jones from charitable status.

== Aftermath ==
The case has been cited in many decisions that followed as well as by commentators, due to the significance of the precedent established in this case.

In 2000 BJU president Bob Jones III announced on &quot;Larry King Live&quot; that its ban on interracial dating had been dropped. The change was stimulated by a media uproar prompted by a visit of then-presidential candidate George W. Bush. In February 2017, BJU president Steve Pettit announced that Bob Jones University had regained its tax-exempt status.

<text>Linda Laughlin McIntosh (born December 14, 1943) is a former politician in Manitoba, Canada. She was a member of the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba from 1990 to 1999, and a cabinet minister for most of this period. Among other awards and recognitions, McIntosh has received both the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal and the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal, for her contributions to Canada.

== Early life ==
McIntosh was born in Montreal, Quebec. She’s the daughter of Hugh Laughlin a career military officer (RCAF) and Gwen Ruth Hopper. She was educated in Canada and Europe, attending eleven different schools during the course of her elementary and high school education. In 1960 she graduated from Royal George High School in Greenfield Park, Quebec and moved to Manitoba (the province in which her parents were raised and to which they eventually retired) and began studies at St. John&#x27;s College, University of Manitoba. McIntosh graduated with honors from the Manitoba Teachers&#x27; College in 1963.

==Personal life==
In 1988, She married Donald John McIntosh. McIntosh’s nephew Hugh McFadyen, is the former Leader of the Opposition in Manitoba, her grandfather John Bell Laughlin and her great grandfather Andrew Laughlin were also MLA’s in south western Manitoba.

== Career ==

=== Teacher, artist/illustrator, TV Commentator, School Board, Civil Service ===

McIntosh worked as an elementary school teacher and freelance commercial artist for several years, and was also a political commentator on CBC TV&#x27;s Friday Night News &quot;Week In Review&quot; segment in 1985-86. She was the weekly cartoonist/illustrator for local Winnipeg Community Newspapers and the province wide Rupertsland News. She enjoyed a brief stint as an illustrator the Winnipeg Tribune prior to its untimely demise in 1980.

McIntosh was elected as a school trustee in the Winnipeg region of St. James-Assiniboia in 1980, and served until 1989, becoming its first female chair in 1984. She was elected to serve as president of the Manitoba Association of School Trustees in the mid-eighties.
In June 1988, she was hired as Special Assistant to Progressive Conservative leader Gary Filmon, who had become Manitoba&#x27;s Premier the previous month.

=== Legislature ===

McIntosh was herself elected to the Manitoba legislature in the provincial election of 1990, defeating incumbent Liberal Ed Mandrake by 1324 votes in the western Winnipeg riding of Assiniboia.

On February 5, 1991, she was named Minister of Cooperative, Consumer and Corporate Affairs, with responsibility for the Liquor Control Act. In those roles she had the Residential Tenancy Act re-written and established a Residential Tenancy Court which enabled landlords and tenants with disputes to have their issues resolved quickly and inexpensively without lengthy civil court battles.

McIntosh was appointed to the Manitoba Provincial Treasury Board on January 14, 1992 where she served for two years.

On September 10, 1993, she was transferred from Consumer and Corporate Affairs to the Ministry of Urban Affairs and Housing. In this portfolio she worked closely with then Winnipeg Mayor Susan Thompson on a wide variety of inter-provincial issues such as the Shoal Lake Aqueduct agreement and the Municipal/Provincial/Federal Infrastructure Agreements.

Her work in the Housing Department earned her public recognition from public housing tenants. McIntosh was easily re-elected in the provincial election of 1995, defeating Liberal Allen Green by 1130 votes. On May 9, 1995, she was appointed Minister of Education and Training, responsible for K-12 education in public and independent schools and for post secondary education in universities, colleges and apprenticeship programs. As Minister of Education, she was responsible for developing measurable standards for literacy and numeracy at three-year intervals at grades 3, 6, 9, and 12. Mainly diagnostic in nature, these standards tests also counted for a portion of students&#x27; final marks at the upper levels of learning.

McIntosh felt that her most significant work was the undertaking of a two-year-long Special Needs Study, culminating in recommendations, widely praised, which recommended how to best meet the challenges and opportunities of inclusivism; and how to create the most enabling learning experience for all students, in regular and special needs categories.

As the minister responsible for all post-secondary education, she created the Council on Post-Secondary Education to be responsible for co-ordinating efforts amongst Manitoba&#x27;s Universities and Colleges, to better avoid duplication and overlap, and to ensure seamless movement from one level of learning to another throughout the province.

It was under McIntosh&#x27;s tenure that the Canadian Mennonite University was established, and that a Task Force was established and completed recommendations on what needed to be done to arrange better opportunities for Apprenticeship and Trades training.

She increased the student representation on the Universities&#x27; Boards of Governors and approved the University of Manitoba&#x27;s Student Union&#x27;s Pathways to Excellence brief to the provincial government. Under her Tenure the Red River Community College expanded and was granted new nomenclature, becoming Red River College. She also imposed a number of surcharges for certain university categories in 1995 and 1996, which were regarded by some as particularly severe on foreign students, since foreign students would no longer be given a preferential tuition rate and would have to pay the same fees as Canadian students.

McIntosh was no stranger to controversy. Amongst many items which became the topic of public debate during her tenure as Education Minister was the whole question of patriotic exercises in schools and the significance of the monarchy in Canada. In 1998, school principals brought to her attention that the portion of the Manitoba Schools Act concerning patriotic exercises was not being followed in many schools. McIntosh won the support of the Monarchists across the province, and the ire of Canadian republicans, when she sent out a memo to School Divisions reminding them that the Act was to be followed.

It became a provincial controversy, with many complaining that semestered school timetables made such exercises difficult to successfully accomplish since not all students would be present for them. In one memorable moment during this controversy, the entire opposition NDP caucus stood and with great gusto sang all the verses of God Save the Queen in the Legislative Assembly of Manitoba.

MLA Doug Martindale (NDP, Burrows) said afterwards that the performance was a &quot;serenade&quot; for Minister McIntosh.

In the final cabinet shuffle of Filmon&#x27;s government on February 5, 1999, McIntosh was named Minister of Environment with responsibility for the Manitoba Public Insurance Corporation Act.

McIntosh was very narrowly defeated by New Democrat Jim Rondeau in the 1999 provincial election. McIntosh actually led Rondeau on election night, but fell three votes behind when the institutional and absentee ballots were counted. McIntosh did not seek a return to office in 2003.

=== Other Career Experience ===

In 1999 and 2000, McIntosh was Marketing Director for Winnipeg&#x27;s Portsmouth Retirement Residence during its construction, development and start up, ensuring that accommodation was appropriate for prospective clients&#x27; needs.

From 2000-2003 McIntosh was president and owner of Roaming Buffalo Communications, a company specializing in speech-writing, brochure design, editing, communications consulting and the production of a magazine, {&quot;The Roaming Buffalo Magazine&quot;} highlighting Manitoba&#x27;s people and places.

McIntosh was on the local Board of Directors for the federal Canadian Alliance Party of Canada Canadian Alliance prior to its merger with the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada in 2003. She was a strong supporter of the &quot;Unite The Right&quot; movement which led to that merger. She subsequently was elected to the local Board of Directors for the new Conservative Party of Canada. During the federal election of 2004 McIntosh campaigned for successful Conservative candidates Steven Fletcher and Joy Smith.

McIntosh served as Constituency Assistant for M.P. Steven Fletcher from June 2004 to June 2005.

=== Author ===

McIntosh is the author of three biographies of heroic Canadians.

Her first book, &quot;What Do You Do If You Don&#x27;t Die?,&quot; published by Heartland Associates of Manitoba in 2008, is the story of geological engineer and award winning athlete Steven Fletcher&#x27;s struggle to return to a full life after becoming paralyzed from the neck down. An inspirational book, it has been praised by advocates for the catastrophically injured, the severely disabled, and those who are struggling to overcome adversity. Linda McIntosh and Steven Fletcher have been friends and confidants since the mid-nineties.

McIntosh&#x27;s second book, &quot;Child of Lamposaari&quot;, published in 2010, is the birth to death biography of Hilkka Nygard, the matriarch of the Nygard Fashion Empire, and a personal friend of McIntosh. The book has been praised by those who are interested in the history of Finland, in which much of the story takes place; and by those who are interested in the many challenges faced by Canadian immigrants. McIntosh has indicated that the book is a tribute, not just to Hilkka Nygard; but to all Canadian immigrant mothers, to the lands they loved and left behind and to the great country to which they came.

A third book, Master of My Fate, a continuation of Steven Fletcher&#x27;s saga, was written in response to a request for &quot;more&quot; from readers of the first book about Fletcher. This book takes readers through Fletcher&#x27;s life from 2006 to 2015 and details the many challenges and circumstances he had to overcome during that period. It deals extensively with Steven Fletcher&#x27;s mission to legalize physician-assisted-death (PAD)in Canada. It includes stories and opinions from advocates and opponents of PAD and the text of the two Bills Fletcher introduced as an MP into the Canadian House of Commons on the topic. At the time of writing the Parliament of Canada had not acted upon the Canadian Supreme Court&#x27;s order to develop PAD legislation. Hence the book became widely read, discussed and debated.

McIntosh is active as a community volunteer in her current locale in northwestern Ontario. She has been elected to the Board of Directors of the Mary Berglund Community Health Centre, serving the township of Ignace and surrounding area including Savant Lake; and to the Board of Directors, Conservative Party of Canada, Kenora, Ontario.

<doc id="1110359" wikidata="Q973573" url="?curid=1110359" title="Donation of Pepin">
<text>The Donation of Pepin in 756 provided a legal basis for the creation of the Papal States, thus extending the temporal rule of the popes beyond the duchy of Rome.

== Background ==
In 751, Aistulf, king of the Lombards, conquered what remained of the exarchate of Ravenna, the last vestige of the Roman Empire in northern Italy. In 752, Aistulf demanded the submission of Rome and a tribute of one gold per capita. Pope Stephen II and a Roman envoy, the silentiary John, tried through negotiations and bribes to convince Aistulf to back down. When this failed, Stephen led a solemn procession through the streets of Rome and nailed the treaty which Aistulf had violated to a crucifix. He then sent envoys to Pepin the Short, king of the Franks, with a letter requesting his support and the provision of a Frankish escort so that Stephen could go to Pepin to confer. At the time, the Franks were on good terms with the Lombards.

In 753, John the Silentiary returned from Constantinople to Rome with an imperial order () that Pope Stephen accompany him to meet Aistulf in the Lombard capital of Pavia. The pope duly requested and received a letter of transit from the Lombards. With the Frankish envoys who had by then arrived, the pope and the imperial envoy set out for Pavia on 14 October 753. The Roman magnates did not accompany them past the border of the duchy of Rome. At Pavia, Aistulf denied the requests of Stephen and John to return the conquered exarchate to the empire, but he did not prevent Stephen from continuing with the Frankish envoys to the court of Pepin. They left Pavia on 15 November 753. John the Silentiary did not accompany them. This was the first time a pope had crossed the Alps. The decision to act independently of the imperial envoy was of the immense moment. It is likely that the pope saw himself as acting on behalf of the Italian province subjugated and threatened by Aistulf. 

== Original promise ==
Pope Stephen met Pepin the Short at the royal estate at Ponthion on 6 January 754. The king led the Pope&#x27;s horse, while the pope in sackcloth and ashes bowed down and asked Pepin . Pepin responded by promising . The exact nature of this commitment cannot be known, but it is unlikely that Pepin had in mind the Roman Empire. It has been suggested that the two parties exchanged oaths on this occasion, but that is unlikely.

Over the next two years, Pepin dispatched three embassies to Aistulf demanding that he honour his treaties with the Romans. In April 754, he held a general assembly at Quierzy-sur-Oise. Some noblemen left the proceedings in opposition to the policy, but Pepin restated publicly his promise to the Pope and enumerated the territories that he would restore. Afterwards, this promise was put into writing. On 28 July in the Basilica of Saint-Denis, the Pope anointed Pepin and his sons Charles and Carloman as kings of the Franks and patricians of the Romans. He also pronounced a blessing on Queen Bertrada and the assembled nobility. The pope&#x27;s right to grant the patrician title is doubtful.

== Military actions ==
In the spring of 755, Pepin summoned the army to muster at Braisne-sur-Vesle. He sent envoys ahead to offer Aistulf an indemnity if he restored the Roman territories he had taken in violation of his treaties. The Frankish army crossed the Mont Cénis and defeated the Lombard army near Susa. Defeated, Aistulf submitted to some form of Frankish overlordship and promised under oath to return Ravenna and the other cities he had occupied to the Pope. The peace treaty was signed by the without direct reference to the Empire. 

As soon as the Frankish army left Italy, Aistulf disregarded the treaty. On 1 January 756, he put Rome under siege. The Pope appealed to the Franks. After three months, Aistulf abandoned the blockade. In April, a Frankish army invaded Italy again and defeated the Lombards. Aistulf was forced to give hostages and pay annual tribute to the Franks. He also had to promise in writing to return the occupied territories to the Pope. 

== Final agreement ==
The treaty officially conferred upon the pope the territories belonging to Ravenna, even cities such as Forlì with their hinterlands, the Lombard conquests in the Romagna and in the Duchy of Spoleto and Benevento, and the Pentapolis (the &quot;five cities&quot; of Rimini, Pesaro, Fano, Senigallia and Ancona). Narni and Ceccano were former papal territories. The territories specified in the treaty of 756 had belonged to the Roman Empire. Envoys of the Empire met Pepin in Pavia and offered him a large sum of money to restore the lands to the Empire, but he refused, saying that they belonged to St Peter and the Roman church. The boundaries of the grant to the Pope can only be approximated, since the text of the treaty has not survived. It is possible that the boundaries were the same as those in a previous Imperial–Lombard treaty. Abbot Fulrad was charged with collecting the keys of the cities to be handed over and depositing them along with the written agreement on the tomb of St Peter.

The Donations made the Pope a temporal ruler for the first time. This strip of territory extended diagonally across Italy from the Tyrrhenian to the Adriatic Sea. Over these extensive and mountainous territories the medieval Popes were unable to exercise effective sovereignty, given the pressures of the times.

== Charlemagne ==
In 774 Pepin&#x27;s son Charlemagne visited Rome and again confirmed and reasserted the Donation. Some later chronicles falsely claimed that he also expanded them, granting Tuscany, Emilia, Venice and Corsica.

<text>A battle axe (also battle-axe, battle ax, or battle-ax) is an axe specifically designed for combat. Battle axes were designed differently to utility axes, with blades more akin to cleavers than to wood axes. Many were suitable for use in one hand, while others were larger and were deployed two-handed.

Axes designed for warfare ranged in weight from just over , and in length from just over to upwards of , as in the case of the Danish axe or the sparth axe. Cleaving weapons longer than would arguably fall into the category of polearms.

==Overview==

Through the course of human history, commonplace objects have been pressed into service as weapons. Axes, by virtue of their ubiquity, are no exception. Besides axes designed for combat, there were many battle axes that doubled as tools. Axes could be modified into deadly projectiles as well (see the francisca for an example). Axes were often cheaper than swords and considerably more available. 

Battle axes generally weigh far less than modern splitting axes, especially mauls, because they were designed to cut legs and arms rather than wood; consequently, slightly narrow slicing blades are the norm. This facilitates deep, devastating wounds. Moreover, a lighter weapon is much quicker to bring to bear in combat and manipulate for repeated strikes against an adversary.

The crescent-shaped heads of European battle axes of the Roman and post-Roman periods were usually made of wrought iron with a carbon steel edge or, as time elapsed across the many centuries of the medieval era, steel. The hardwood handles of military axes came to be reinforced with metal bands called langets, so that an enemy warrior could not cut the shaft. Some later specimens had all-metal handles.

Battle axes are particularly associated in Western popular imagination with the Vikings. Certainly, Scandinavian foot soldiers and maritime marauders employed them as a stock weapon during their heyday, which extended from the beginning of the 8th century to the end of the 11th century. They produced several varieties, including specialized throwing axes (see francisca) and &quot;bearded&quot; axes or &quot;skeggox&quot; (so named for their trailing lower blade edge which increased cleaving power and could be used to catch the edge of an opponent&#x27;s shield and pull it down, leaving the shield-bearer vulnerable to a follow-up blow). Viking axes may have been wielded with one hand or two, depending on the length of the plain wooden haft. See Viking Age arms and armor.

== History ==
===Europe===

====Prehistory and the Ancient Mediterranean====

Stone hand axes were in use in the Paleolithic period for hundreds of thousands of years. The first hafted stone axes appear to have been produced about 6000 BCE during the Mesolithic period. Technological development continued in the Neolithic period with the much wider usage of hard stones in addition to flint and chert and the widespread use of polishing to improve axe properties. The axes proved critical in wood working and became cult objects (for example, the entry for the Battle-axe people of Scandinavia, treated their axes as high-status cultural objects). Such stone axes were made from a wide variety of tough rocks such as picrite and other igneous or metamorphic rocks, and were widespread in the Neolithic period. Many axe heads found were probably used primarily as mauls to split wood beams, and as sledgehammers for construction purposes (such hammering stakes into the ground, for example).

Narrow axe heads made of cast metals were subsequently manufactured by artisans in the Middle East and then Europe during the Copper Age and the Bronze Age. The earliest specimens were socket-less.

More specifically, bronze battle-axe heads are attested in the archaeological record from ancient China and the New Kingdom of ancient Egypt. Some of them were suited for practical use as infantry weapons while others were clearly intended to be brandished as symbols of status and authority, judging by the quality of their decoration.

The epsilon axe was widely used during the Bronze Age by irregular infantry unable to afford better weapons. Its use was limited to Europe and the Middle East.

In the eastern Mediterranean Basin during the Iron Age, the double-bladed labrys axe was prevalent, and a hafted, single-bitted axe made of bronze or later iron was sometimes used as a weapon of war by the heavy infantry of ancient Greece, especially when confronted with thickly-armored opponents. The sagaris—described as either single bitted or double bitted—became associated by the Greeks with the mythological Amazons, though these were generally ceremonial axes rather than practical implements.

The Barbarian tribes that the Romans encountered north of the Alps did include iron war axes in their armories, alongside swords and spears. The Cantabri from the Iberian peninsula also used battle axes.

====The Middle Ages====
Battle axes were very common in Europe in the Migration Period and the subsequent Viking Age, and they famously figure on the 11th-century Bayeux Tapestry, which depicts Norman mounted knights pitted against Anglo-Saxon infantrymen. They continued to be employed throughout the rest of the Middle Ages, with significant combatants being noted axe wielders in the 12th, 13th, and 14th centuries.

King Stephen of England famously used a &#x27;Dane axe&#x27; at the Battle of Lincoln 1141. One account says that he used it after his sword broke. Another says he used his sword only after his axe broke.

Richard the Lionheart was often recorded in Victorian times wielding a large war axe, though references are sometimes wildly exaggerated as befitted a national hero: &quot;Long and long after he was quiet in his grave, his terrible battle-axe, with twenty English pounds of English steel in its mighty head...&quot; – &quot;A Child&#x27;s History of England&quot; by Charles Dickens. Richard is, however, recorded as using a Danish Axe at the relief of Jaffa. Geoffrey of Lusignan is another famous crusader associated with the axe.

Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, used an axe to defeat Henry de Bohun in single combat at the start of the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. Given that Bruce was wielding the axe on horseback, it is likely that it was a one handed horseman&#x27;s axe. They enjoyed a sustained revival among heavily armored equestrian combatants in the 15th century.

In the 14th century, the use of axes is increasingly noted by Froissart in his Chronicle, which records the engagements between the kingdoms of France and England and the rise of professional and mercenary armies in the 14th century. King John II is recorded as using one at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356 and Sir James Douglas at the Battle of Otterburn in 1388. Bretons were apparently noted axe users, with noted mercenaries Bertrand du Guesclin and Olivier de Clisson both wielding axes in battle. In these instances the type of battle axe - whether a Danish axe, or the proto-pollaxe - is not recorded.

Most medieval European battle axes had a socketed head (meaning that the thicker, butt-end of the blade contained an opening into which a wooden haft was inserted), and some included langets—long strips of metal affixed to the faces of the haft to prevent it from being damaged during combat. Occasionally the cheeks of the axehead bore engraved, etched, punched, or inlaid decorative patterns. Late-period battle axes tended to be of all-metal construction.

Such medieval polearms as the halberd and the pollaxe were variants of the basic battle-axe form.

Steel plate-armor covering almost all of a knight&#x27;s body, and incorporating features specifically designed to defeat axe and sword blades, become more common in the late 14th and early 15th century. Its development led to a generation of hafted weapons with points that concentrated impact, either to penetrate steel plate or to damage the joints of articulated plate. Increasingly daggers called misericords were carried which enabled a sharp point to be thrust though gaps in armour if an opponent was disabled or being grappled with. Swords styles became more diverse – from the two-handed zweihänders to more narrow thrusting instruments with sharply pointed tips, capable of penetrating any &quot;chinks in the armour&quot; of a fully encased opponent: for example, the estoc.

A sharp, sometimes curved pick was often fitted to the rear of the battle axe&#x27;s blade to provide the user with a secondary weapon of penetration. A stabbing spike could be added, too, as a finial. Similarly, the war hammer evolved in late-medieval times with fluted or spiked heads, which would help a strike to &quot;bite&quot; into the armour and deliver its energy through to the wearer, rather than glance off the armor&#x27;s surface. Strikes from these armour penetrating picks were not always fatal. There are many accounts of plate armored knights being struck with said weapons and while the armour was damaged, the individual underneath survived and in some cases completely unharmed.

It eventually became common for these various kinds of impact weapons to be made entirely from metal, thus doing away with reinforced wooden shafts.

A useful visual guide to high-medieval battle axes, contemporary with their employment, are the scenes of warfare depicted in the Maciejowski Bible (Morgan Bible) of c. 1250.

Battle axes also came to figure as heraldic devices on the coats of arms of several English and mainland European families.

====Post-medieval axes====
Battle axes were eventually phased out at the end of the 16th century as military tactics began to revolve increasingly around the use of gunpowder. However, as late as the 1640s, Prince Rupert—a Royalist general and cavalry commander during the English Civil War—is pictured carrying a battle axe, and this was not merely a decorative symbol of authority: the &quot;short pole-axe&quot; was adopted by Royalist cavalry officers to penetrate Roundhead troopers&#x27; helmets and cuirasses in close-quarters fighting, and it was also used by their opponents: Sir Bevil Grenville was slain by a Parliamentarian pole-axe at the Battle of Lansdowne, and Sir Richard Bulstrode was wounded by one at the Battle of Edgehill.

In Scandinavia, however, the battle axe continued in use alongside the halberd, crossbow and pole-axe until the start of the 18th century. The nature of Norwegian terrain in particular made pike and shot tactics impracticable in many cases. A law instituted in 1604 required all farmers to own weaponry to serve in the militia. The Norwegian peasant militia battle axe, much more wieldy than the pike or halberd and yet effective against mounted enemies, was a popular choice. Many such weapons were ornately decorated, and yet their functionality shows in the way that the axe head was mounted tilting upwards slightly, with a significant forward curve in the shaft, with the intent of making them more effective against armoured opponents by concentrating force onto a narrower spot.

During Napoleonic times, and later on in the 19th century, farriers in army service carried long and heavy axes as part of their kit. Although these could be used in an emergency for fighting, their primary use was logistical: the branded hooves of deceased military horses needed to be removed in order to prove that they had indeed died (and had not been stolen). Napoleon&#x27;s Pioneer Corps also carried axes that were used for clearing vegetation—a practice employed by similar units in other armies.

===Middle East===
The &quot;tabarzin&quot; (, lit. &quot;saddle axe&quot; or &quot;saddle hatchet&quot;) is the traditional battle axe of Persia. It bears one or two crescent-shaped blades. The long form of the tabar was about seven feet long, while a shorter version was about three feet long. What made the Persian axe unique is the very thin handle, which is very light and always metallic. The tabar became one of the main weapons throughout the Middle East, and was always carried at a soldier&#x27;s waist not only in Persia but Egypt, and the Arab world from the time of the Crusades. Mamluk bodyguards were known as &quot;tabardiyya&quot; after the weapon. The tabarzin is sometimes carried as a symbolic weapon by wandering dervishes (Muslim ascetic worshippers).

===Asia===

====China====
Different types of battleaxes may be found in ancient China. In Chinese mythology, Xingtian (), a deity, uses a battle axe against other gods. The &quot;qi&quot; () and &quot;yue&quot; () are heavy axes. They were common in Zhou dynasty but fell out of favor with users due to the lack of mobility. The eventually became used only for ceremonial purposes and such battleaxes made of bronze and jade have been found. The dagger axe (ge) is another form used in ancient times.

Chinese battleaxes can be divided in three subgroups: Fu (), Yue () and Ge (). The distinction between a Yue and a Fu is that a Yue is, as a general rule, broader than a Fu. In the Shang dynasty the Yue was also a symbol of power, the bigger the Yue, the greater the power. There are a few rare examples of Yue with a round blade and a hole in the middle. 

The Chinese Fu appeared in the Stone Age as a tool. In the Shang dynasty (–) the Fu began to be made from bronze, and began to be used as a weapon. However, the prominence of the Fu waned on the battlefield as the Zhou dynasty came to power. In the Warring States era iron axes started to appear. Up until the Han and Jin dynasty, after having lost its importance on the battle-field, the Fu once again appeared as the cavalry was used more often.
In the Sui and Tang dynasties there is evidence of the subdivision of the Fu. During the Song dynasty axes were popularized and many types of axes began to exist. The types include Phoenix Head Axes ( ), Invincible Axe ( ), Opening Mountain Axe ( ), Emei Axe ( ) and Chisel Head Axes ( ).
A well known novel from the Ming dynasty (1368–1644) knows as the Outlaws of the Marsh (or the Water Margin - Shui Hu Zhuan ) features a character known as Li Kui, the Black Whirlwind who wields two axes and fights naked.

In the Yuan and Ming dynasties, axes retained their use in the army. In the Qing dynasty new types of axes emerge among the Eight Banners Army with straight edges. The Green Standard Army among the Eight Banners used double axes weighing each, with a length of .

In modern Chinese wushu and Chinese opera there are many depictions of the axe. Many of these axes look thick and heavy, however, the axe heads are hollow.

====Indian Subcontinent====
The battle axe of ancient India was known as a parashu (or farasa in some dialects). Made from iron, bamboo, wood, or wootz steel, it usually measures though some are as long as . A typical parashu could have a single edge or double edge, with a hole for fixing a shaft. The haft is often tied with a leather sheet to provide a good grip. The cutting edge is invariably broad and the length of the haft could be about three to four feet. The parashu is often depicted in religious art as one of the weapons of Hindu deities such as Shiva and Durga. The sixth avatar of Lord Vishnu, Parashurama, is named after the weapon. Parashu are still used as domestic tools in Indian households, particularly in the villages, as well as being carried by certain sects of eremitic sadhu.

====Philippines====
The panabas (also known as nawi among some ethnic groups) is a traditional battle axe favored by the Moro and Lumad tribes of Mindanao, Philippines. It was also used as an agricultural or chopping tool. It ranges in size from and usually long and can be held with one or two hands. Hilts were often wrapped in rattan bindings or had metal collars. Due to its clean cutting capabilities it was also sometimes used as an execution weapon. It is said that the Moro warriors wielding panabas would follow the main group of warriors up front and would immediately charge in on any American survivors of the first wave of attack during the Philippine–American War.

Among the various Cordilleran peoples of the northern Philippines, another type of traditional battle axe, the head axe, was favored for headhunting raids. It was specialized for beheading enemy combatants but was also used as an agricultural tool. They were banned, along with headhunting practices, during the American colonial period of the Philippines in the early 20th century.
====Sri Lanka====
The keteriya was a type of battle axe that was used in ancient Sri Lanka. A keteriya consisted of a single edge and a short handle made of wood. This would allow the user to wield it with a single hand.

====Vietnam====

The battle axe is one of the most common type of weapons found in Vietnamese ancient cultures, particularly the Dong Son culture.

<doc id="1110373" wikidata="Q2158813" url="?curid=1110373" title="Robert Semple (fur trader)">
<text>Robert Semple (26 February 1777 – 19 June 1816) was an American-born fur trader and merchant who served as governor of the territories controlled by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company in the Canadas from 1815 until his death in 1816.

== Background ==
Semple was born on 26 February 1777 in Boston, Mass. He was the son of Robert Semple, a prominent London merchant and Anne Greenlaw. Semple&#x27;s parents were loyalists, and sometime during or after the American Revolution, the family returned to England.

Because he was not a British citizen, but an American, Semple was able to travel to many countries that British subjects would barred from entering due to wartime restrictions. During his travels he wrote travel books including &quot;Walks and sketches at the Cape of Good Hope; to which is subjoined a journey from Cape Town to Blettenberg&#x27;s Bay&quot; (London, 1803); &quot;Observations on a journey through Spain and Italy to Naples; and thence to Smyrna and Constantinople: comprising a description of the principal places in that route, and remarks on the present natural and political state of those countries&quot; (2v., London, 1807); A &quot;second journey in Spain, in the spring of 1809; from Lisbon, through the western skirts of the Sierra Morena, to Sevilla&quot;, &quot;Cordoba, Granada, Malaga, and Gibraltar; and thence to Tetuan and Tangiers&quot; (London, 1809); &quot;Sketch of the present state of Caracas; including a journey from Caracas through La Victoria and Valencia to Puerto Cabello&quot; (London, 1812); and &quot;Observations made on a tour from Hamburg, through Berlin, Gorlitz, and Breslau, to Silberberg; and thence to Gottenburg&quot; (London, 1814). It is possible that it was while he was traveling that he met Thomas Douglas, the 5th Lord of Selkirk who appointed him as Governor of Assiniboia and Governor in chief of Rupert&#x27;s Land. Semple began his position 12 April 1815 and was paid 1,500 pounds annually for his work. He then left for the Red River Settlement. It is not clear why Semple was given the position of governor.

== Red River Settlement ==
Selkirk&#x27;s settlers first arrived at the Red River settlement in August 1812. The governor at this time was Miles Macdonell. Under the rule of Macdonell, the settlement had been attacked and destroyed by North West Company members. Due to this failure, Macdonell lost support. Red River Settlers were anxious for the arrival of Semple, who was expected to be much more popular than Macdonell.

At the age of 38, Semple landed at York Factory in August 1815 with other settlers. They had to journey from York to the Red River Settlement, which they arrived at on 3 November.

Lord Selkirk appointed Semple to be the governor of the territories owned by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. He controlled the land known as the Forks which consisted of Fort Douglas, Fort Gibraltar, and Seven Oaks. The committee meeting held, resolved to appoint Semple. However, there was no information provided in the minutes from the meeting as to why Semple was chosen for the position. He was not proven to be qualified for the position of governor.

=== Colin Robertson ===
Colin Robertson, was a member of the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company who helped rebuild the Red River Settlement prior to Semple&#x27;s arrival. The two men had a complicated relationship. as Semple wanted to prove himself as master through his powerful decisions. Meanwhile, Robertson did not approve of many of the decisions that Semple was making. His disapproval led Robertson to leave the Settlement on 11 June 1816 and he intended to return to England. After Semple began achieving success and support, Robertson asked to return to the settlement, which Semple rejected.

=== Semple as Governor ===
Semple did many things in the first few years of being governor. During his first December at the settlement, he went to Fort Daer (Pembina, N.Dak) and visited settlers who had moved there for the winter due to a shortage of food. He then continued and visited all of the different posts on the upper Assiniboine and Qu&#x27;Appelle rivers that belonged to the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company. When he returned, Semple began to attack his neighbours, the North West Company and the Metis. Semple encouraged his colonists to settle on farms two miles down the river from Red River and he blocked the rivers at The Forks.

Controversy arose at the Red River settlement when on the tenth of June, 1816 Semple decided to attack and dismantle Fort Gibraltar, the Fort owned by the North West Company. After seizing the fort, Semple took all of the usable belongings and shipped them to Fort Douglas. Everything that was left he burned so that it could not be rebuilt by the North West Company. Colin Robertson disagreed with what Semple was doing and his means to prove a point. This was when Robertson decided that he would no longer support Semple as the governor and left the settlement. Semple&#x27;s actions played a large role in the feud between the two men. The Metis also view the destruction of the fort with disgust, they saw the burning and dismantling of the Fort as an act of war. Due to Semple drastic measures, he essentially ensured no way for a peaceful settlement to occur between the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, the North West Company, and the Metis.

After destroying Fort Gibraltar, Semple then took over the North West Company&#x27;s post at Pembina on 23 March 1816. After another attack by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company, the North West Company and the Metis who were all living in close proximity to Semples land, began to prepare for war. Cuthbert Grant, the leader of the Metis, wanted to take back Qu&#x27;appelle. They fought and took back the Brandon house from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company on 1 June 1816.

== Seven Oaks ==

Seven Oaks was a clash between the Metis, North West Company members, and Selkirk settlers. The skirmish began when a man by the name of Moustouche Boutino let Semple know that Cuthbert Grant and his men had prepared for war, and wanted to take Semple as a prisoner. When Semple heard a few days later that a watchman at Fort Douglas had seen the Metis half a mile down, Semple asked 20 men to follow him to meet them. The men at Red River liked Semple, and were loyal to him. All of the men wanted to follow him, however they obeyed and limited their numbers to 20. Semple said he was not going to fight, and that he only wanted to ask them what the Metis wanted; meanwhile, his men that came were all given muskets, bayonets, as well as ball and powder. &quot;In this discrepancy in Semple&#x27;s actions lay the cause of the events of 19 July. He had no desire for a conflict, and much reason to avoid one, but his actions and his position made one most likely.&quot; While Semple and his men were preparing to meet them, the Metis started to move away from Fort Douglas. However, instead of letting them pass, Semple insisted on meeting them.

The two groups met at close range, the Metis forming a semicircle, and the Selkirk settlers forming a line so that the Metis could not pass. At first, the Metis had 15 men whereas Semple had 24. However, other Metis and North West Company men were quick to arrive, and Semple was now outnumbered.

François-Firmin Boucher, a Canadian member of the North West Company, moved forward to speak with Semple. There are a few different versions of how the next events took place.

John Pritchard, an eyewitness, stated that when the two men met, they both asked the other what they wanted. Boucher finally told Semple, &quot;We want our fort back&quot;. Semple fueled the Canadian&#x27;s anger by telling him, &quot;Then go get your fort&quot; and reached to grab Boucher&#x27;s gun.

Michael Heyden states that Boucher asked the governor, &quot;Why did you destroy our fort, you damned rascal&quot;. Semple then went to grab Boucher&#x27;s horse&#x27;s reins and told his men to take Boucher as a prisoner.

It is not clear whether Semple was reaching for Boucher&#x27;s gun, or his horse&#x27;s bridle. But, while Semple was reaching for him, Boucher dismounted his horse and began running back to his side. Boucher&#x27;s account differs slightly, in that Semple and his men disarmed him, and that his horse took flight and that he was fired upon while riding the frightened animal away. One of Semple&#x27;s men fired his gun, which triggered the fighting. Within 15 minutes nearly everyone from Semple&#x27;s group was either injured or dead.

Semple was still alive when the fighting ended, but had a non-fatal injury. Semple asked Grant to allow him to go back to the fort so he would live and Grant agreed. However, before he could leave an Indian rode past and shot him in the chest, killing him.

In total, 22 men died in the battle, 21 were from Semple&#x27;s side, including himself. On the other hand, only one man died from the Metis group. Nearly all of Semple&#x27;s men died, but John Pritchard, one of the few to survive, wrote on what happened at the battle. The recount that he left remains one of the best and most reliable Anglophone accounts on the Battle at Seven Oaks.

Miles Macdonell was the first from the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to hear about the massacre, and told Lord Selkirk on 24 July what had happened at the Red River Settlement. Selkirk, infuriated, went to the North West Company headquarters to confront them on what their men and the Metis had done.

In total, 17 men, including Cuthbert Grant, were charged with the murder of Robert Semple. Due to his actions and the outcome at Seven Oaks, Cuthbert Grant became one of the most hated men to the Red River settlers.

== Controversy of Seven Oaks as a massacre ==
The battle that happened at Seven Oaks has traditionally been viewed by historians as a massacre. Dick Lyle argued that it was not a massacre, but that the incident at Seven Oaks was depicted that way by Anglo-Canadians to portray the métis as violent and as a result, justify taking their homes on First Nations lands. On the other hand, the story entered Métis lore as proof of their supremacy over the land and other people, as in Pierre Falcon&#x27;s song, &quot;La chanson des Bois-brûlés,&quot; and especially &quot;La chanson de la Grenouillère&quot; (see below).

=== Coltman&#x27;s Report ===
One of the first accounts of what happened at Seven Oaks is known as Coltman&#x27;s report. Today, Coltman is praised for providing one of the best sources on the incident. Unfortunately, this source was largely ignored by many historians until 1910. Coltman gathered information from an equal number of people, from both sides of the battle, and analysed their credibility. Coltman also did not let his personal beliefs cloud his report. Overall, the information that he gathered was mostly unbiased and very extensive. The conclusions that Coltman made in his report did not support the ideals that many of the white-Anglo historians wanted to convey. This source was intentionally ignored as historians would choose sources that agreed with their opinions rather than those that told the truth.

Coltman&#x27;s report determined that the Selkirk men fired the first shot and began the battle. He argued that the battle should not be called a massacre because Semple had begun the battle. The fight was lost due to the Selkirk men being unaccustomed to the way the Metis fought. The Metis were skilled at close combat, allowing them to win the battle with such a high rate of success.

Coltman examined the rumours of the Metis &quot;finishing off the enemy&quot;, meaning killing men that would have otherwise lived. He determined that this practice did happen but it was not an act of extreme violence. Rather, they did this because the Metis did not take prisoners.

Other rumours such as the Metis did not bury the bodies and left them to be eaten by animals were found to be true. Coltman argued that some Metis did behave cruelly, but it could not be applied to the whole group.

=== Chanson de la Grenouillère ===
Pierre Falcon a Métis, wrote the &quot;Chanson de la Grenouillère&quot; a song about what happened at the battle of Seven Oaks. This song was not ever looked at by historians for the same reasons that Coltmas report was not utilised; because it did not support the ideals of the white-Anglo historian.

=== Alexander Ross ===
Alexander Ross wrote a book on the battle in 1856. Modern historians explain that &quot;Ross&#x27;s interpretive framework is uncomplicated: it is a straightforward expression of the theme of &quot;civilization versus savagery&quot;. The civilized white man versus the savage Indian that Ross portrayed became a theme that repeated in the majority of history books afterwards. The Metis were labeled as the ones who fired the first shot and killed Semple and his men. The writing of the book was an &quot;effort by Ross to privilege his own European ethnicity in opposition to the posited savagery of all Native people within the Red River Settlement, including persons of mixed race&quot;.

Ross&#x27;s book had success and was widely accepted by historians despite much of the account being false and lacking in proper evidence. It was this book that began the false telling of what happened at the Red River Settlement between Semple and Grant.

The stereotypes he created would then be repeated throughout history. The history that Ross wrote is said to have been the tool used by white Anglos to justify having settled on native land without reasonable grounds.

=== George Bryce ===
Similar to Ross, George Bryce was asked to write Manitoba&#x27;s history from his white, European, and upper class perspective. The history that he wrote was one sided and promoted Selkirks actions. Bryce describes &quot;Selkirk and his party [as] the unproblematic heros, and the NWC and the Metis the villains, underscored by their putative role at Seven Oaks&quot;. There were many problems with the credibility of Bryce&#x27;s research. &quot;In researching 7 oaks, [Bryce] simply looked for testimony from the Selkirk side alleging Metis savagery, quoted it at length and ignored contrary evidence&quot;. Thus, the same problems and stereotypes that were present in Ross&#x27;s history were then repeated and set further precedent for other historians poorly representing the incident at Seven Oaks. Bryce, like Ross understood that &quot;representing 7 oaks as a &quot;massacre: was therefore integral the construction of a new master narrative of progress in the West&quot;.

=== French Canadian writings ===
Writings on the Seven Oaks incident by French Canadians were kinder to the Metis, but still stated that the Metis were responsible for the battle and coined the event as a massacre.

=== W. L. Morton ===
W. L. Morton&#x27;s history further discredited the Metis. He states in his history that either Deschamps or Machicabou (an Indian) killed Semple and repeatedly represents the Metis as savages who terrorised Semple&#x27;s group. Like the other white-Anglo historians before him, Morton wrote a biased history that promoted his ethnic group and class. His history was also used to discredit the Riel resistance. In his writings, Morton was harsher on the description of the Metis. Whereas older historians had presented the Metis as wild but noble (a mix of positive and negative characteristics) Morton describes the Metis as completely negative.

== Legacy ==
To justify white-Anglo actions, the Metis needed to be shown as violent and lacking judgement and a prime example of this was done through the histories written on the battle at Seven Oaks. &quot;Seven oaks provided a convenient vehicle for the presentation of an alleged metis weakness of character, implicitly justifying the disposition of their lands&quot;.

Today, the myths of what happened at Seven Oaks have become nearly &quot;resistant to revision&quot; due to the original histories on the topic.

<doc id="1110375" wikidata="Q7551222" url="?curid=1110375" title="Social judgment theory">
<text>In social psychology, Social judgment theory (SJT) is a self-persuasion theory proposing that an individual&#x27;s perception and evaluation of an idea is by comparing it with current attitudes. According to this theory, an individual weighs every new idea, comparing it with the individual&#x27;s present point of view to determine where it should be placed on the attitude scale in an individual&#x27;s mind. SJT is the subconscious sorting out of ideas that occurs at the instant of perception. The theory of Social Judgement attempts to explain why and how people have different reactions and responded toward the same information or issue. Social Judgment Theory can be used to improve the way people communicate with one another. The theory is also widely considered in persuasions. The Social Judgement Theory depends on the individual&#x27;s position on a certain issue occurring. Depending on three elements Social Judgement Theory has, they are followed by their anchor, alternatives and ego-involvement.

==Overview==
Social judgment theory is a framework that studies human judgment. It is how people&#x27;s current attitudes shape the development of sharing and communicating information. The psychophysical principle involved for example, is when a stimulus is farther away from one&#x27;s judgmental anchor, a contrast effect is highly possible; when the stimulus is close to the anchor, an assimilation effect can happen. Social judgment theory represents an attempt to generalize psychophysical judgmental principles and the findings to the social judgment. With the person&#x27;s preferred position serving as the judgmental anchor, SJT is a theory that mainly focuses on the internal processes of a person&#x27;s own judgment in regards to the relation within a communicated message. The concept was intended to be an explanatory method designed to detail when persuasive messages are most likely to succeed.

Originally conceived as an explanatory method, SJT seeks to unravel the intricacies of persuasive communication, honing in on attitude change as its central objective. Within this theoretical framework, the conditions conducive to successful attitude change become focal points of investigation. SJT not only aims to predict the occurrence of attitude change but also endeavors to delineate the direction and magnitude of these shifts. This multifaceted approach involves an exploration of individuals&#x27; propensity to alter their opinions, the anticipated trajectory of such changes, their receptiveness to the opinions of others, and the depth of commitment to their existing positions.

Attitude change is the fundamental objective of persuasive communication. SJT seeks to specify the conditions under which this change takes place and predict the direction and extent of the attitude change, while attempting to explain how likely a person might be to change their opinion, the probable direction of that change, their tolerance toward the opinion of others, and their level of commitment to their position. The SJT researchers claimed expectations regarding attitude change could be based on the message receiver&#x27;s level of involvement, the structure of the stimulus (and how many alternatives it allows), and the value (credibility) of the source.

== Founder of Social judgment theory ==

=== Muzafer Sherif ===
Muzafer Sherif, a Turkish native born into a Muslim family in 1906, studied at a Christian school. Sherif attributes his understanding and fascination with social movements in emerging African and Asian countries to the nationalistic movements in his youth in the former Ottoman Empire. Sherif obtained his Master&#x27;s Degree in psychology from Harvard University in February 1932. Sherif then acquired a Ph.D. from Columbia University. Sherif was fluent in German and French, but throughout the years, he relied on English more. Sherif sympathized with the political left.

=== Roger Nebergall ===
Roger Nebergall, from Iowa, was a speech professor. He was a co-author of the book &quot;Attitude and Attitude Change: The Social Judgement- Involvement Approach&quot; alongside Muzafer Sherif. As they worked with each other they found that the Social Judgement Theory suggests an individual&#x27;s position on certain issues depending on the three factors: anchor, alternatives, and ego-involvement.

==Development==
SJT arose from social psychology and was based on laboratory findings resulting from experiments. These experiments studied the mental assessment of physical objects, referred to at the time as psychophysical research. Subjects were asked to compare some aspect of an object, such as weight or color, to another, different object. The researchers discovered that, when a standard was provided for comparison, the participants categorized the objects relative to the aspects of the standard. SJT focuses on the conceptual structure of the framework and traces its development from the roots in Brunswik&#x27;s probabilistic functionalism to its present form. 
For example, if a very heavy object was used as the standard in assessing weight, then the other objects would be judged to be relatively lighter than if a very light object was used as the standard. The standard is referred to as an &quot;anchor&quot;. This work involving physical objects was applied to psychosocial work, in which a participant&#x27;s limits of acceptability on social issues are studied. Social issues include areas such as religion and politics.

The traditional view of attitude neglects an individual&#x27;s emotional and motivational influences as well as the social context in which the attitude(s) are formed, meaning an individual is more likely to assume a speaker with authority will be informative, truthful, relevant, and clear. Wyer and Gruenfeld (1995) noted that &quot;much of our theoretical and empirical knowledge about social information processing has been obtained under laboratory conditions that only faintly resemble the social situations in which information is usually acquired in everyday life&quot;.

==Judgment process and attitudes==
Rooted in judgment theory, which is concerned with the discrimination and categorization of stimuli, it attempts to explain how attitudes are expressed, judged, and modified. A judgment occurs when a person compares at least two stimuli and makes a choice about them. With regard to social stimuli specifically, judgment processes incorporate both past experiences and present circumstances. Sherif et al. (1965) defined attitudes as &quot;the stands the individual upholds and cherishes about objects, issues, persons, groups, or institutions&quot; (p. 4). Researchers must infer attitudes from behavior. The behavior can be in response to arranged or naturally occurring stimuli. True attitudes are fundamental to self-identity and are complex, and thus can be difficult to change.

One of the ways in which the SJT developers observed attitudes was through the &quot;Own Categories Questionnaire&quot;. This method requires research participants to place statements into piles of most acceptable, most offensive, neutral, and so on, in order for researchers to infer their attitudes. This categorization, an observable judgment process, was seen by Sherif and Hovland (1961) as a major component of attitude formation. As a judgment process, categorization and attitude formation are a product of recurring instances, so that past experiences influence decisions regarding aspects of the current situation. Therefore, attitudes are acquired.

The theory has three strict factors that create different positions an individual can have on a specific issue. Social Judgement Theory is the way opinions and thoughts are formed on specific issues or beliefs. It is used to explain the reasoning behind why and how people have different reactions and responses towards information or any specific issue. Social Judgement Theory is influenced by the values of individuals and the environments they are in or around.

The following are some ways that SJT can be used in the context of social norms campaigns that target risky behaviors like drinking, smoking, and engaging in hazardous activities:

According to SJT, people should evaluate incoming messages in light of their preexisting attitudes and convictions. Perceptual contrast is a useful tool for campaigns that draw attention to the discrepancy between perceived and actual norms. For instance, the campaign can highlight this contrast to dispel misconceptions if people think that &quot;everyone smokes at parties,&quot; but in reality, the majority of guests rarely smoke. SJT emphasizes the significance of anchor points, or reference points, in people&#x27;s decision-making processes. 

Campaigns can offer relatable and unambiguous reference points to help people form their own opinions about social norms. For example, presenting anecdotes or data regarding abstainers of alcohol or tobacco use can act as anchor points to solidify this idea.

Social judgment theory suggests that individuals assess incoming information based on their preexisting attitudes and beliefs, ultimately shaping their judgments and decisions.

==Latitudes of rejection, acceptance, and noncommitment==
Social judgment theory also illustrates how people contrast their personal positions on issues to others&#x27; positions around them. Aside from having their personal opinion, individuals hold latitudes of what they think is acceptable or unacceptable in general for other people&#x27;s view. Social attitudes are not cumulative, especially regarding issues where the attitude is extreme. This means that a person may not agree with less extreme stands relative to his or her position, even though they may be in the same direction. Furthermore, even though two people may seem to hold identical attitudes, their &quot;most preferred&quot; and &quot;least preferred&quot; alternatives may differ. Thus, a person&#x27;s full attitude can only be understood in terms of what other positions he or she finds acceptable or unacceptable, in addition to his or her own stand. The three factors people have towards an issue are broken up into three different latitudes: rejection, acceptance, and non-commitment. The latitude of acceptance refers to the range of ideas that an individual finds acceptable or favorable. This could vary between ideas, messages, or positions. Usually, the messages that fall within this range are more likely to be accepted and incorporated into an individual&#x27;s existing beliefs.

The latitude of rejection is quite the opposite. Latitude of rejection represents the range of ideas that an individual finds unacceptable or unfavorable. The messages that end up falling within this range are most likely to be rejected.

The latitude of non-commitment lies between the middle of the latitudes of acceptance and the latitude of rejection. This is where the individual is indifferent or noncommittal. The messages in the range of non-commitment are neither accepted nor rejected by an individual. The three factors show how the attitude of an individual is imagined as a spectrum of different opinions. Showing that one accepts, ranging from rejection on one end and acceptance on the other end.

These degrees or latitudes together create the full spectrum of an individual&#x27;s attitude. Sherif and Hovland (1961) define the latitude of acceptance as &quot;the range of positions on an issue ... an individual considers acceptable to him (including the one &#x27;most acceptable&#x27; to him)&quot; (p. 129). On the opposite end of the continuum lies the latitude of rejection. This is defined as including the &quot;positions he finds objectionable (including the one &#x27;most objectionable&quot; to him)&quot;. This latitude of rejection was deemed essential by the SJT developers in determining an individual&#x27;s level of involvement and, thus, his or her propensity to an attitude change. The greater the rejection latitude, the more involved the individual is in the issue and, thus, harder to persuade.

In the middle of these opposites lies the latitude of noncommitment, a range of viewpoints where one feels primarily indifferent. Sherif claimed that the greater the discrepancy, the more listeners will adjust their attitudes. Thus, the message that persuades the most is the one that is most discrepant from the listener&#x27;s position, yet falls within his or her latitude of acceptance or latitude of noncommitment.

Social judgment theory (SJT) is applied in &quot;Kinky Boots,&quot; as seen in a number of story points. Firstly, the concepts of SJT&#x27;s latitude of acceptance, rejection, and noncommitment are reflected in the characters&#x27; attitudes and responses to outlandish concepts, such as the creation of durable yet stylish boots for drag queens. Charlie, the main character, first finds it difficult to embrace this new course for his family&#x27;s failing shoe factory, illustrating the difficulties in broadening one&#x27;s acceptance range. The interactions between the characters also emphasize how SJT shapes people&#x27;s attitudes and actions. In the narrative, Lola, the drag queen who works with Charlie, experiences differing degrees of acceptance and rejection from various people, demonstrating how people&#x27;s opinions are shaped by their preconceived notions. Furthermore, as characters like Charlie and Lola go through personal journeys of overcoming societal expectations and embracing their authentic selves, the theme of self-acceptance is central to the plot. This examination of self-acceptance aligns with SJT&#x27;s focus on how people internalize social norms and how that affects how they behave.

All things considered, &quot;Kinky Boots&quot; offers a wealth of illustrations that show how social judgment theory functions within the framework of social norms, personal identity, and interpersonal relationships. The musical provides insights into the intricacies of human judgment and the transformational potential of acceptance through its gripping story.

==Assimilation and contrast==
Sometimes people perceive a message that falls within their latitude of rejection as farther from their anchor than it really is; a phenomenon known as contrast. The opposite of contrast is assimilation, a perceptual error whereby people judge messages that fall within their latitude of acceptance as less discrepant from their anchor than they really are.

These latitudes dictate the likelihood of assimilation and contrast. When a discrepant viewpoint is expressed in a communication message within the person&#x27;s latitude of acceptance, the message is more likely to be assimilated or viewed as being closer to the person&#x27;s anchor, or his or her own viewpoint, than it actually is. When the message is perceived as being very different from one&#x27;s anchor and, thus, falling within the latitude of rejection, persuasion is unlikely, due to a contrast effect. The contrast effect is what happens when the message is viewed as being further away than it actually is from the anchor.

Messages falling within the latitude of non-commitment, however, are the ones most likely to achieve the desired attitude change. Therefore, the more extreme an individual&#x27;s stance, the greater his or her latitude of rejection and, thus, the harder he or she is to persuade.

==Ego involvement==
The SJT researchers speculated that extreme stands, and thus wide latitudes of rejection, were a result of high ego involvement. Ego involvement is the importance or centrality of an issue to a person&#x27;s life, often demonstrated by membership in a group with a known stand. According to the 1961 Sherif and Hovland work, the level of ego involvement depends upon whether the issue &quot;arouses an intense attitude or, rather, whether the individual can regard the issue with some detachment as primarily a &#x27;factual&#x27; matter&quot; (p. 191). Religion, politics, and family are examples of issues that typically result in highly involved attitudes. They contribute to one&#x27;s self-identity.

The concept of involvement is the crux of SJT. In short, Sherif et al. (1965) speculated that individuals who are highly involved in an issue are more likely to evaluate all possible positions, therefore resulting in an extremely limited or nonexistent latitude of non-commitment. People who have a deep concern or have extreme opinions on either side of the argument always care deeply and have a large latitude of rejection because they already have their strong opinion formed and usually are not willing to change that. High involvement also means that individuals will have a more restricted latitude of acceptance. According to SJT, messages falling within the latitude of rejection are unlikely to successfully persuade. Therefore, highly involved individuals will be harder to persuade, according to SJT.

In opposition, individuals who have less care in the issue, or have a smaller ego involvement, are likely to have a large latitude of acceptance. Because they are less educated and do not care as much about the issue, they are more likely to easily accept more ideas or opinions about an issue. This individual will also have a large latitude of non-commitment because, again, if they do not care as much about the topic, they are not going to commit to certain ideas, whether they are on the latitude of rejection or acceptance. An individual who does not have much ego involvement in an issue will have a small latitude of rejection because they are very open to this new issue and do not have previously formed opinions about it.

==Attitude change==
To change an attitude, we must first understand the audience&#x27;s attitudes. Positive attitude change increases as the discrepancy goes up. Then we will see how it relates to the listeners&#x27; judgments of the persuasive messages. It is also essential to judge how close or far away one&#x27;s position is. The next step is to shift one&#x27;s position in response to the argument made. An individual adjusts an attitude once he or she has judged a new position to be in his or her latitude of acceptance. If someone judges that message to be in his or her latitude of rejection, they will also adjust their attitude, but in the opposite direction from what they think the speaker is advocating.

Sometimes, an attitude change may be incidental. In the boomerang effect, an attitude changes in the opposite direction from what the message advocates—the listener is driven away from, rather than drawn to, an idea. This explains why oftentimes fear appeals used in advertising do not work on the audience. As the threat perceived by the audience increases and the capacity to produce the desired effect is low, people will tend to do the opposite of what is advocated. Attitude change can also be influenced by the immediate social environment. In the interpersonal domain, people tend to shift their attitudes to align with those of their significant others. The general picture of social influence thus remains one of conformity and alignment attitudes.
A major implication of social judgment theory is that persuasion is difficult to accomplish. Successful persuasive messages are those that are targeted to the receiver&#x27;s latitude of acceptance and discrepant from the anchor position so that the incoming information cannot be assimilated or contrasted. This suggests that even successful attempts at persuasion will yield only small changes in attitude. SJT also suggests persuasion can occur over time with multiple messages.

Central to this process is the concept of the &quot;latitude of acceptance.&quot; Individuals are inclined to modify their attitudes when they perceive a novel position falling within this latitude. Conversely, if a message is deemed to be within the &quot;latitude of rejection,&quot; the audience may still undergo an attitude adjustment, but in the opposite direction of the advocated stance.

A significant implication emerges from the social judgment theory: the arduous nature of persuasion. Successful persuasive messages must be finely tuned to the receiver&#x27;s latitude of acceptance and strategically discrepant from the anchor position. Even in cases of successful persuasion, the anticipated changes in attitude may be modest. Furthermore, the theory suggests that persuasion is not a one-time event but a cumulative process, with attitudes potentially evolving over time through exposure to multiple messages.

==Simulations==
SJT has mainly been tested in small experimental settings, only rarely in more extended ways that include an investigation of opinion changes on a collective level in modeling studies. Stefanelli and Seidel conducted a large-scale simulation of SJT, based on real-life data. They collected survey data from 1302 Swiss citizens, regarding their attitudes towards building a deep-ground-repository for nuclear waste. Attitudes were ranked on three scales: risk, benefit, and process. The data was fed into an agent-based social simulation. In each time period, two random agents were selected to interact. Their opinions on these three topics (risk, benefit, and process) were compared. If they were in the latitude of rejection, the opinions were pushed away from each other; otherwise, the opinions were pulled towards each other. The results showed a four-opinion cluster solution, representing four types of opinions: opposing, supporting, ambivalent, and indifferent.

Their study unfolded as a substantial simulation rooted in the attitudes of 1302 Swiss citizens toward the construction of a deep-ground repository for nuclear waste. The participants&#x27; attitudes were gauged across three dimensions: risk, benefit, and process. This rich dataset was then utilized in an agent-based social simulation, introducing a dynamic element to the study.

The outcome of this intricate simulation revealed a fascinating four-opinion cluster solution. This cluster represented distinct types of opinions held by the participants: opposing, supporting, ambivalent, and indifferent. This nuanced categorization underscores the complexity of collective opinions and how they evolve within the framework of SJT. The study by Stefanelli and Seidel not only expanded the application of SJT beyond controlled settings but also provided insights into the diverse manifestations of opinions within a real-world context.

== Studies utilizing SJT ==
A recent study by Melike Acar uses SJT to evaluate Turkish teachers’ social judgments on students with special needs being excluded and included in primary schools. This study&#x27;s main purpose was to research teachers&#x27; decisions and justifications related to students with autism and how some teachers struggle to include students with special needs. This study discusses the difficulties in having relations with children in both mainstream and special needs schools. One can see the perspectives of teachers regarding the exclusion of students with different needs. The study goes into depth about how social judgment theory affects both exclusive and inclusive special needs schools. The results concluded that teachers with more training on inclusion had a more positive acceptance than teachers who had not had the training when it came to games. However, when it came to school projects, those who had not had the inclusion training were more excepting than those who had the training. Fifty-four teachers participated in the study.

Another study from 2021 by Yao Song, Ameersing Luximon, and Yan Luximon studied the effects of different human-robot faces and whether or not people trust them. Experiments showed that big eyes, medium vertical and horizontal eye position, and medium horizontal mouth position all helped to increase trustworthiness. To be able to receive a latitude of acceptance from the social judgment theory of people, they experimented with people’s reactions to different facial features on robots.

Another study conducted by Agbolagh and Zamani examined SJT in simulations and its connections to balance theory. Results indicate that in a given group of people, opinions will tend to either cluster or form consensus or bipartite consensus when beliefs begin to form into two groups in a community. Interactions among those within a group remain largely positive, while those between groups are negative. Findings suggest once the bounded confidence model was adapted to include negative responses, those with like-minded opinions had a higher likelihood of persuading. Findings of this study indicate that opinions changed to align with the average view of trusted individuals among participants.

An Ohio State University tested the study participants&#x27; moral judgment of characters in media through the lens of SJT. The study findings indicate that during interactions between heroes and villains, people morally disengage from the violence committed by the hero because they know the villain to be morally worse. Because of their past experiences in observing heroes in media, people are inclined to believe that the hero is acting in a way that is less immoral because of their preconceived notions of who a hero is. A reason for this may indicate that the hero committed violence to stop the villain. This moral disengagement occurs between the boundaries of their latitudes of rejection and acceptance.

An early study utilizing SJT from 1966 by Bochner and Insko, students read an &quot;expert&quot; article about how much sleep young people truly need in a night, and then were surveyed about how much sleep they believed they needed. Most students came into the study with the knowledge that 7-8 hours of sleep each night constitutes a good night&#x27;s rest. The difference between the articles the students read was the amount of sleep recommended ranging from 8 to 0 hours each night. Persuasion increased as the recommended amount of sleep lowered until it was reduced to 3 hours. At that point, students gradually stopped believing the article given to them. This study shows the students&#x27; latitude of acceptance on the topic ranged between 8 and about 3 hours. While within the latitude of acceptance, persuasion increased the more radical the idea presented was. But once the latitude of acceptance was hit, persuasion starkly decreased.

A study done in 2020 used SJT to research the viewpoint Israeli Jews held about African refugees and asylum seekers in Israel. It was found that extreme messaging was most effective in influencing social judgements in Israeli Jews about African refugees compared to moderate or very extreme messaging. When moderate messaging was used, views were not moved far from their anchor. When too extreme messaging was used, it fell out of the receiver&#x27;s latitude of acceptance, and the receiver completely disregarded the message. The most impact was found when a middle ground message was used. 

In a study done concerning teenagers attending alternative high schools, students reported a statistically significantly latitude of acceptance around substances positively correlated to past gateway drug use and future hard drug use. SJT helps to explain why the latitude of acceptance around substances is important. The higher the latitude of acceptance around substances, the more open a person is to trying said substance. The study proposes that in order to reduce substance abuse rates overall, having programs to reduce the latitude of acceptance around substances in teens is a potential solution.

Concerning online shopping data privacy, a 2020 study researched how perceived warmth in online shopping relates to personal disclosure from the customer. It was found that customers perceived a higher level of warmth and a lower level of privacy concerns when asked to disclose information (such as their phone number, email address, and home address) towards the end of the online shopping interaction as opposed to right away. This makes customers more likely to disclose information towards the purchase or post-purchase phases of shopping. Perceived warmth can persuade customers into giving out personal information. Companies can use this to establish warmth within their online presences.

One study by Goglia and Vega analyzed social interaction in Reddit communities, specifically subreddits where the original poster asks for judgement from the community on a certain issue. Using the lens of SJT, the study underlines the importance of previous responses read before a user is to add their own comment/opinion. Users are often persuaded by comments from other users before making their final judgement on the original post.

In a study done in 2019, Florida residents were surveyed about their opinions on genetically modified foods. They were given messages on the topic to either accept or reject based on their beliefs. Messages that genetically modified foods had no health effects on humans at all and messages that genetically modified foods caused cancer were most often rejected. Messages that stated genetically modified food carried some health risk to humans were most often accepted. This study shows where the common latitudes of rejection and acceptance on the topic lie within the population surveyed.

== Conservatism of COVID-19 ==
The concept of conservatism and the political spectrum have a strong connection to the anti-vaccine sentiments observed in social judgment theory. In order to lessen anti-vaccination sentiments, people&#x27;s perceptions of attitude change from acceptance to rejection, and intellectual humility can either narrow or widen their latitudes of rejection and acceptance. Anti-vaccination sentiments included disapproval of vaccines for a number of different causes. The four most common reasons are doubts about the effectiveness of vaccines, worries about possible adverse effects, and references to or beliefs about the superiority of natural immunity over vaccinations from pharmaceutical corporations, which earn huge profits from vaccinations. These four categories of anti-vaccine sentiments, which are not all-inclusive, sum up the main causes of anti-vaccine sentiment in the general public.  In terms of vaccine and mask mandates these violations of one’s freedom, particularly over a topic that has a high degree of ego involvement, would likely lead to the anchoring of one’s attitude about vaccinations within the latitude of rejection. It&#x27;s hardly surprising that social judgment—especially with regard to vaccination attitudes—plays a big part in the COVID-19 pandemic. Tweets and other social media content can give important information about how the general public feels, thinks, and behaves in relation to vaccination campaigns. In order to gauge public opinion, spot new trends, and evaluate the effectiveness of communication tactics, researchers and public health specialists frequently examine social media data, including tweets. Researchers can learn about a variety of factors influencing people&#x27;s opinions, including misinformation, personal experiences, cultural beliefs, and political ideologies, by looking at tweets about vaccines. But it&#x27;s crucial to proceed cautiously when analyzing social media data and to be aware of the presumptions that underlie this kind of study.

== Conclusion ==
An evaluation of the social judgment theory in light of several standards that define a sound scientific theory is presented in the final part. A good theory should first and foremost be consistent with the available data. It should, in theory, summarize and explain a certain collection of information and events. These veracity criteria are where social judgment theory performs rather well. It has been based on empirical data from the beginning and has been successful in absorbing a significant number of known facts. Not everyone has the same upbeat opinion. While the discrepancy debate suggests that social judgment theory is somewhat broad, there are at least some situations at which it is unmistakably false. For example, the theory would not be able to handle an anomaly when contrast happened at a tiny discrepancy and assimilation at a huge discrepancy. Similarly, the theory would not be able to elegantly include such a set of facts if there were a U-shaped function between disagreement and opinion change in response to a communication. However, this theory has a number of valuable concepts and ideas, as well as a number of areas that may be studied further within the framework of this theory. When the growing body of information is examined, the hypothesis is expanded upon, and any necessary revisions are made.

==Alternative models==
* Elaboration likelihood model – emphasizes the two routes of persuasion – central (cognitive arguments) and peripheral (emotional influence).
* Social impact theory - emphasizes the number, strength, and immediacy of the people trying to influence a person to change their mind.
* Error Parsing: An alternative method of implementing social judgment theory. Error Parsing focuses on errors that can occur with SJT, such as human error, error due to noise, error due to cue weighting and error due to inconsistency.

<doc id="1110392" wikidata="Q2315255" url="?curid=1110392" title="Radio Atlanta">
<text>Radio Atlanta was an offshore commercial station that operated briefly from 12 May 1964 to 2 July 1964 from a ship anchored in the North Sea, three and a half miles off Frinton-on-Sea, Essex, England. The radio broadcasting vessel was owned, at that time, by Gordon McLendon and Clint Murchison of Dallas, Texas, and leased to a British company for day-to-day operations. It was named after Atlanta, Texas,

While the station was dubbed as a pirate radio station, its actual operation took place within the laws of the day and its offices were located in the heart of the Soho district of London. Its radio advertising sales management was vested in company known as Project Atlanta, Ltd., which had been specifically formed by British political, banking, theatrical and music publishing interests.

==Origin of the station==
The on air studio and 10,000 watt AM transmitter of Radio Atlanta were located on board the motor vessel . This radio ship had been originally converted and outfitted (under the name MV &quot;Bon Jour&quot;) as the home of the offshore Swedish station Radio Nord by the radio interests of Gordon McLendon and financed by fellow Texan Clint Murchison. Jack Kotschack had previously represented the sales operation in Stockholm, Sweden as Radio Nord, and Australian music publisher Allan Crawford represented the sales and programming operation in Britain under the new name of Radio Atlanta. Crawford was doing business and residing in England.

==Station history==

Following the closure of Radio Nord by Swedish legislation, the radio ship sailed for Galveston, Texas, where she remained for a year until 1963. The vessel was stripped of its broadcasting equipment. This meant that when Crawford finally managed to acquire the ship, it was necessary to refit it as a radio station. Crawford&#x27;s backers included his friend the translator Dorothy Black.

Meanwhile, Ronan O&#x27;Rahilly had acquired the Mclendon business plan from Crawford and showed it to associates of Jocelyn Stevens, and used the blueprint to create another station called Radio Caroline. O&#x27;Rahilly offered Crawford the use of the O&#x27;Rahilly family port at Greenore in Ireland in exchange for use of the Crawford recording studio for the venture represented by O&#x27;Rahilly.

Both Crawford and O&#x27;Rahilly admit that, while the two ships were being fitted out, numerous acts of mutual sabotage occurred, with each company doing its best to delay the other&#x27;s launch. The &quot;Mi Amigo&quot; was first to leave Greenore, but problems with the rigging supporting its antenna mast meant that the ship had to put in at Falmouth for repairs, and because of this delay Radio Caroline went on air first, on 28 March 1964.

Radio Atlanta began test broadcasts on 12 May 1964. Its earliest tests were on 1520 kHz (197 metres), the same frequency as Caroline, after Caroline&#x27;s evening closedown and were clearly intended to steal Caroline&#x27;s audience. Official programming began shortly afterward on 1493 kHz (201 metres). The DJs never referred to the &quot;Mi Amigo&quot; by name, but as &quot;The Good Ship Radio Atlanta&quot;.

The majority of Radio Atlanta&#x27;s programmes were pre-recorded in London and were rushed out to the ship for transmission on the same day or the next. On occasions when bad weather made this impossible, the onboard DJs had to present more live shows.

Radio Atlanta remained on the air for less than 2 months, until 2 July 1964. Audiences and advertising revenue had not lived up to expectations, and Crawford was reluctantly forced to join with O&#x27;Rahilly&#x27;s Caroline, and become Radio Caroline South. Crawford remained in charge of Caroline South until late 1965, when he left and O&#x27;Rahilly took overall control of both Carolines.

==After Atlanta==
Crawford&#x27;s &quot;Project Atlanta&quot; remained in control of Caroline South until late 1965, but the station continued to lose ground as new stations came on the air, notably Radio London. Eventually Crawford pulled out, leaving O&#x27;Rahilly in charge of both Caroline ships, and Caroline South&#x27;s audience figures improved under its new management.

<doc id="1110393" wikidata="Q287258" url="?curid=1110393" title="Martin Cauchon">
<text>Martin Cauchon (born 23 August 1962) is a Canadian lawyer and politician in Quebec Canada. He served as a Liberal Cabinet minister in the government of Jean Chrétien. He unsuccessfully ran for the leadership of the Liberal Party of Canada in 2013, losing to Justin Trudeau.

Cauchon worked as a lawyer from 1985 to 1993, and from 2004 to present. Today, he is counsel at the Montreal office of DS Lawyers Canada LLP, an international law firm. He is also a Vice-Chairman of the Canada China Business Council.

==Early life and career==

Cauchon was born in La Malbaie, Quebec and studied law at the University of Ottawa and the University of Exeter in the United Kingdom. He practised law in civil and commercial litigation from 1985 to 1993. Cauchon was counsel with Gowlings and with the now-defunct law firm of Heenan Blaikie.

He is married to Dorine Perron and, together, they have three children.

==Politics==
Cauchon first ran for public office in the 1988 federal election when he challenged Prime Minister Brian Mulroney in the riding of Charlevoix, however he was unsuccessful in this bid. In the 1993 federal election, Cauchon once again sought a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. In this election, he was elected in the Montreal riding of Outremont. He was re-elected in the 1997 and 2000 elections.

Cauchon was appointed Secretary of State for the Federal Office of Regional Development - Quebec by Prime Minister Jean Chrétien in 1996. He became a full cabinet minister in 1999 when he was given the position of Minister of National Revenue. On 15 January 2002, he became Minister of Justice and Attorney General of Canada, and Quebec lieutenant. As justice minister, Cauchon argued in cabinet in favour of same-sex marriage and the decriminalization of marijuana (indeed, when asked whether he had used marijuana in the past, he responded &quot;Yes, of course&quot;). As a minister, Cauchon leave its marks on many files. As Secretary of State for regional development, he solidified the community future organisation in the province of Quebec. During his tenue as minister of national revenu, he introduced the customs action plan opening the door for the use of more technologies in managing the Canada-US border. As Minister of Justice, he fought for equality right and tabled the bill on same-sex marriage. He also introduced a bill decriminalizing marijuana. Even though that latter bill wasn&#x27;t pass into law, it was the precursor of the legalization of marijuana.

 In 2009, Cauchon indicated he was interested in re-entering politics and running in his former riding of Outremont, which was then held by New Democratic Party (NDP) Deputy Leader Thomas Mulcair. The Liberal Party&#x27;s Quebec Lieutenant Denis Coderre, who was tasked with finding Quebec candidates for the next election, announced that the riding was closed off to Cauchon and was being reserved for a female candidate. Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff originally sided with Coderre in opposing Cauchon return, and instead planned to appoint prominent businesswoman Nathalie le Prohon as the candidate in the riding. However, after facing pressure from within his caucus Ignatieff reversed his earlier decision and decide to allow Cauchon to seek the nomination, after Le Prohon indicated she would seek the Liberal nomination in Jeanne-Le Ber. The controversy over the nomination led to Coderre&#x27;s resignation as the Liberal&#x27;s Quebec Lieutenant and Defence Critic, saying he no longer had the &quot;moral authority&quot; to continue.

In the federal election held on 2 May 2011, Cauchon was unsuccessful in his bid to unseat Mulcair. The NDP&#x27;s support in Quebec, and throughout most of Canada, had surged in the final weeks of the campaign, at the expense of the Liberals and Bloc Québécois. The NDP won 59 seats in Quebec and replaced the Liberals as the Official Opposition in the House of Commons. Ignatieff had also failed in his bid to win re-election and resigned as party leader days later.

===Leadership===

Cauchon was a Chrétien loyalist and opposed Paul Martin&#x27;s attempt to force Chrétien to retire. When Chrétien announced his resignation, Cauchon was touted as a possible candidate to succeed him but did not end up running in the 2003 leadership election. Cauchon refused to back Martin&#x27;s leadership bid, and decided to support John Manley. Martin was elected leader and did not include Cauchon in his cabinet. Following this he announced he would not seek re-election in the 2004 federal election.

Cauchon was considered a potential candidate in both the 2006 and 2009 Liberal leadership elections, however in both cases he announced he would not run. In 2006, he endorsed former Ontario Premier Bob Rae who placed third.

At the Liberal Party&#x27;s 2012 biennial convention, Cauchon hosted a hospitality suite leading to speculation that he was interested in running for leader in the 2013 leadership election. In December 2012, it was reported that Cauchon was planning a lately entry into the race after some Liberals feared the top tier of contenders were supporting right-wing policies. On the last weekend before the registration cutoff on 14 January 2013, Cauchon was trying to gather the 300 signatures needed to enter the leadership race. Fellow leadership contender David Bertschi sent out an email to Liberals asking for their help to get enough signatures so that Cauchon could enter the contest. On 14 April 2013, he lost the leadership election to Montreal MP Justin Trudeau.

==Legal-post political career==
Following his exit from politics, Cauchon returned to practicing law. From 2004 to 2012, he practised commercial law at Gowling Lafleur Henderson. In February 2012, Cauchon joined the firm of Heenan Blaikie in Montreal. He is now counsel at the Montreal office of DS Lawyers Canada LLP.

He is also member of numerous boards. He is a Vice-Chairman of the Canada China Business Council.

Between March 2015 and August 2019, he also bought from the Desmarais family the newspaper chain that he baptized Groupe Capitales Médias (Le Nouvelliste, Le Quotidien, Le Soleil, La Tribune, La Voix de l&#x27;est and Ontario-based Le Droit) and he asked Claude Gagnon to manage it for him. Faced with lower subscription rate, declining advertising rates, and delays in federal government aid, it ended in bankruptcy protection and relaunched as a co-op in December 2019.

<text>Mikhail Semyonovich Tsvet, also spelt Tsvett, Tswett, Tswet, Zwet, and Cvet (Russian: Михаил Семёнович Цвет; 14 May 1872 – 26 June 1919) was a Russian-Italian botanist who invented chromatography. His last name is Russian for &quot;colour&quot; and is also the root word of &quot;flower.&quot;

==Biography==
Mikhail Tsvet was born on 14 May 1872 in Asti, Italy. His mother was Italian, and his father was a Russian official. His mother died soon after his birth, and he was raised in Geneva, Switzerland. He received his BS degree from the Department of Physics and Mathematics at the University of Geneva in 1893. However, he decided to dedicate himself to botany and received his PhD degree in 1896 for his work on cell physiology. He moved to Saint Petersburg, Russia, in 1896 because his father was recalled from the foreign service. There he started to work at the Biological Laboratory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. His Geneva degrees were not recognized in Russia, and he had to earn Russian degrees. In 1897 he became a teacher of botany courses for women. In 1902 he became a laboratory assistant at the Institute of Plant Physiology of the Warsaw University (now in Poland). In 1903 he became an assistant professor and taught also at other Warsaw universities. After the beginning of World War I, the Warsaw University of Technology was evacuated to Moscow, Russia, and in 1916 again to Gorki near Moscow. In 1917 he became a Professor of Botany and the director of the botanical gardens at the University of Tartu (Yuryev) (now in Estonia). In 1918 when German troops occupied the city, the university was evacuated to Voronezh, a large city in the south of Central Russia. Tsvet died of a chronic inflammation of the throat on 26 June 1919 at the age of 47.

==Chromatography==
Mikhail Tsvet invented chromatography in 1900 during his research on plant pigments. He used liquid-adsorption column chromatography with calcium carbonate as adsorbent and petrol ether/ethanol mixtures as eluent to separate chlorophylls and carotenoids. The method was described on 30 December 1901 at the XI Congress of Naturalists and Physicians (XI съезд естествоиспытателей и врачей) in St. Petersburg. The first printed description was in 1905, in the &quot;Proceedings of the Warsaw Society of Naturalists, biology section&quot;. He first used the term &quot;chromatography&quot; in print in 1906 in his two papers about chlorophyll in the German botanical journal, &quot;Berichte der Deutschen botanischen Gesellschaft&quot;. In 1907 he demonstrated his chromatograph for the German Botanical Society.

For several reasons, Tsvet&#x27;s work was long ignored: the violent political upheaval in Russia at the beginning of the 20th century, the fact that Tsvet originally published only in Russian (making his results largely inaccessible to western scientists), and an article denying Tsvet&#x27;s findings. Richard Willstätter and Arthur Stoll tried to repeat Tsvet&#x27;s experiments, but because they used an overly aggressive adsorbent (destroying the chlorophyll), were not able to do so. They published their results and Tsvet&#x27;s chromatography method fell into obscurity. It was revived 10 years after his death thanks to Austrian biochemist Richard Kuhn and his student, German scientist Edgar Lederer as well as the work of A. J. Martin and R. L. Synge.

==Botanical author abbreviation==
The standard botanical author abbreviation Tswett is applied to plants that he described.

<text>Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn was a global pharmaceutical company formed by the merger of Sweden-based Pharmacia AB and the American company Upjohn in 1995. Today the remainder of the company is owned by Pfizer. In 1997, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn sold several brands to Johnson &amp; Johnson, including Motrin and Cortaid.

==History==
===Amersham===
In 1997, the biotechnology division of the company Pharmacia Biotech merged with Amersham Life Science with the new merged entity being known as Amersham Pharmacia Biotech. In 2001, the company was renamed Amersham Biotech. In 2002, Pharmacia sold its share of the company to Amersham plc. In 2004, Amersham Biosciences was acquired by GE Healthcare.

In 1998, the nutrition division of the company was sold to Fresenius.

===Monsanto===
Monsanto acquired the pharmaceutical company G. D. Searle &amp; Company in 1985. In 1998, Searle and the Monsanto Pharma Sector partnered with Pfizer to develop and promote celecoxib, an anti-inflammatory drug used to treat arthritis. Branded as Celebrex, celecoxib was approved by the FDA in 1998. In December 1999, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn merged with the American biotechnology and medical company, Monsanto and renamed itself Pharmacia. The company retained Monsanto&#x27;s pharmaceutical division - then known as Searle - and spun off the remaining interests as the &quot;new Monsanto&quot;. The newly merged pharmaceutical entity changed its name to Pharmacia Corp.

===Pfizer===
In July 2002, Pharmacia Corp. and Pfizer announced an agreement that Pfizer would purchase Pharmacia; control of celecoxib was often mentioned as a key reason for Pfizer&#x27;s acquisition of Pharmacia. The deal was finalized in April 2003.

===Later developments===
*The remnant of the Stockholm-based part of Pharmacia was partly spun off to Biovitrum in 2001, which sold off its plasma products division to Octapharma in 2002.
*In 2004, the allergy-diagnostic division of Pharmacia was sold off as Pharmacia Diagnostics. Later in 2004, the Uppsala-based ophthalmology division was sold to Advanced Medical Optics.
*In April 2006, Pharmacia Diagnostics changed its name to Phadia, which ended the use of the &quot;Pharmacia&quot; trademark. In September, Phadia was acquired by PPM Capital. In April 2006, Indian company Kemwell acquired Pfizer&#x27;s Uppsala manufacturing plant that used to be under Pharmacia. The company&#x27;s facilities in Strängnäs Sweden are currently being expanded for the production of Genotropin, a growth hormone.

===Overview===
The following is an illustration of the company&#x27;s mergers, acquisitions, spin-offs and historical predecessors:

<doc id="1110425" wikidata="Q7546579" url="?curid=1110425" title="Smudge (band)">
<text>Smudge are an Australian rock and indie pop trio formed in 1991 by Paul Duncan on bass guitar, Alison Galloway on drums and Tom Morgan on guitar and vocals. Morgan is known outside Australia as a song writing collaborator of Evan Dando and his band, the Lemonheads. In 1994 Duncan was replaced on bass guitar by Adam Yee and in 1997 Pete Kelly joined on guitar. Smudge signed with Half a Cow to issue four studio albums, &quot;Manilow&quot; (1994), &quot;Hot Smoke and Sassafras&quot; (1994), &quot;You Me Carpark . . . Now&quot; (1996) and &quot;Real McCoy Wrong Sinatra&quot; (1998), before going into hiatus from late 1999. Since 2002, Smudge play a few times a year. There has been no new music since 1998.

== History ==

Smudge were formed in 1991 in Sydney by Paul Duncan on bass guitar, Alison Galloway on drums and Tom Morgan on guitar and vocals. Galloway and Morgan were also bandmates in Godstar alongside Nic Dalton, who was the co-owner of the record label, Half a Cow. Duncan and Morgan were former school friends.

Smudge had formed after Galloway and Morgan were asked by Dalton to contribute a song, &quot;Tea, Toast and Turmoil&quot;, to the 1991 Half a Cow 7-inch four-track split extended play, &quot;Slice&quot; (with one track each from Swirl, Jupiter and Studley Lush). The group&#x27;s first gig was at the Lansdowne Hotel – where Galloway had worked as a barmaid – to launch the EP. An &quot;Oz Music Project&quot; reporter described Smudge&#x27;s track as &quot;a short, melodic pop song with colourful lyrics which set the blueprint for the future output of [the band].&quot; In mid-year Morgan met Evan Dando (of the Lemonheads) via Dalton; Morgan and Dando subsequently developed a song writing partnership.
They released a 7-inch single, &quot;Don&#x27;t Want to Be Grant McLennan&quot; (referencing the Go-Betweens&#x27; Grant McLennan) in October 1991, which was also issued on a four-track EP of the same name, for the UK market, in March 1992. It was named by John Peel as his record of the week and &quot;NME&quot; provided a favourable review.
Smudge appeared at the inaugural Big Day Out, January 1992 in Sydney. &quot;Love Lust &amp; Lemonjuice&quot; (September 1992), their second EP, included the track, &quot;Divan&quot;. According to Australian musicologist, Ian McFarlane, the two EPs demonstrated &quot;rough-hewn yet sprightly power pop wrapped around witty lyrics, squalling, fuzzy guitars, urgent melodies and grungy production.&quot; They followed with a third EP, &quot;Superhero&quot;, in May 1993, which included covers of the &quot;Laverne &amp; Shirley&quot; theme &quot;Making Our Dreams Come True&quot; and John Waite&#x27;s &quot;Missing You&quot;. Steve Bell of &quot;theMusic.com.au&quot; observed that they had &quot;by this time released a string of catchy, infectious EPs ... so from the outset there was a lot more going on in the Smudge world than mere association or nepotism.&quot; In 1993 the group issued a compilation album, &quot;Tea, Toast &amp; Turmoil&quot;, for the international market on Canadian label Shake/Cargo. It contained material from their three Australian EPs and Various Artists&#x27; compilations.

In 1994 Duncan was replaced by Adam Yee on bass guitar (ex-Headache). In March of that year the band released its debut album, &quot;Manilow&quot;, produced by Dalton, on Half a Cow Records. The first single from the album, &quot;Impractical Joke&quot; (November 1993), was released in three different countries, each with different B-sides culled from a number of home-made four-track recordings conducted independently by each of the band members. Twenty years later Morgan recalled &quot;we did alright with the EPs and stuff, I guess... I think we already had three EPs plus a compilation for overseas, so [&quot;Manilow&quot;] was our first proper album. It was done pretty quickly, in about five days or something. [Dalton] was producing – he was there every day. He played guitar on a couple of songs, plus helped us with some arrangements and stuff. It was such a long time ago.&quot;

In October 1996 they released their second album, &quot;You, Me, Carpark...Now!&quot;, which was recorded at Idful Music Corporation in Chicago, with producer Casey Rice (Liz Phair, Dirty Three) and number of additional studio musicians, including John McEntire (Tortoise). The release saw a decisively less lo-fi sound. The album provided &quot;Mike Love, Not War&quot; as a single in April, with the cover art featuring a parody of the Beach Boys&#x27; album, &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;. Its second single was a three track, &quot;Slight Return&quot;, in August. In 1997 the band released a compilation of rarities, &quot;Mo Poontang&quot;.

During 1997–1998 the band had two guitars in line-up – Pete Kelly (ex-Disneyfist, Sea Life Park, Decoder Ring) joined the band on second guitar and helped record the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Real McCoy, Wrong Sinatra&quot;. It was recorded in a home built eight-track studio in Gerroa, New South Wales, which peaked at No. 10 on the Australian Music Report&#x27;s Top 10 Localternative Albums.

From late October 1999 until 2002 the band went on an extended hiatus while drummer Alison Galloway went trekking across the world. She joined Her Name in Lights, which issued their debut album, &quot;Into the Light Again&quot;, in October 2004, but she had already left that band before it appeared.

The band re-united for a limited number of performances in Sydney and Melbourne at the end of 2004. In October 2008 they again performed together at the inaugural Sounds of Spring Festival in Brisbane which was followed by two performances in Melbourne the following weekend. In August 2010 the band released a compilation album, &quot;This Smudge is True&quot;. In November and December that year they supported The Lemonheads on an Australian tour playing all thirteen songs from the 1992 album &quot;It&#x27;s a Shame about Ray&quot;, plus a selection of songs from other albums. Morgan and Galloway played with Dando in the encore performance of &quot;The Outdoor Type&quot;. Smudge performed as part of the lineup for the 2011 Big Day Out Festival.

<text>Travis Lamont Taylor (born March 30, 1979) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL) for eight seasons during the 2000s. Taylor played college football for the University of Florida. A first-round pick in the 2000 NFL draft, he played professionally for the Baltimore Ravens, Minnesota Vikings, Oakland Raiders and St. Louis Rams of the NFL.

== Early years ==

Taylor was born in Fernandina Beach, Florida. He started his high school career at Camden County High School in Camden County, Georgia, but transferred to Jean Ribault High School in Jacksonville, Florida. As a senior at Ribault High School, Taylor was a first team Class 4A All-State selection, won All-America honors from SuperPrep, and was named to &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; Area Super 24 Team.

== Professional career ==
=== Baltimore Ravens ===

The Baltimore Ravens selected Taylor in the first round (tenth pick overall) in the 2000 NFL draft; he was the third receiver taken in the 2000 draft. The Ravens had high hopes of him making an immediate impact. However, Taylor would only make twenty-eight catches for 278 yards in nine games as a rookie in . That season, Taylor showed early promise for himself and for his team by scoring two touchdowns in the second game of the season, a shootout victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars—a team the Ravens had never beaten. In 2000, the Ravens would go on to win Super Bowl XXXV. Taylor&#x27;s best season with Baltimore came in , when he compiled sixty-one catches for 869 yards and six touchdowns. Baltimore released Taylor after a lackluster 2004 season.

=== Minnesota Vikings ===

Taylor was then picked up by the Minnesota Vikings, where he played the 2005 and 2006 seasons and led the team in receiving both years. In 32 games (29 starts) with the team, Taylor caught 107 passes for 1,255 yards and seven touchdowns. He became a free agent in the 2007 offseason.

=== St. Louis Rams ===

Taylor worked out for the New Orleans Saints on October 11, 2007, but was not signed. He was signed by the St. Louis Rams a week later. He appeared in one game for the team, catching one pass for four yards and recording a solo tackle on special teams. The Rams released him in November.

=== Carolina Panthers ===

On December 26, 2007, the Carolina Panthers signed Taylor to a two-year contract. He was inactive for the team&#x27;s regular season finale. He was released from the team on August 30, 2008.

=== Detroit Lions ===

Taylor was signed by the Detroit Lions on December 16, 2008, after wide receiver Shaun McDonald was placed on injured reserve. He was released on May 4, 2009.

<text>Javon Liteff Walker (born October 14, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a wide receiver in the National Football League (NFL). He was drafted by the Green Bay Packers 20th overall of the 2002 NFL draft. He played college football for the Florida State Seminoles.

Walker also played for the Denver Broncos and Oakland Raiders. He was selected to the Pro Bowl with the Packers in 2004.

Walker attempted to start a clothing company called JWalk.

==Early life==
Javon played for St. Thomas More High School in Lafayette, Louisiana. Walker holds the record from his high school for most career touchdowns, most touchdowns in a game, and longest play from scrimmage. Walker was drafted by the Florida Marlins in the 12th round (366th overall) of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft, and spent three years in the minor leagues of the organization.

==College career==
Walker attended Jones County Junior College in Ellisville, Mississippi, where he was Deion Branch&#x27;s teammate, before enrolling at Florida State University. He was also a triple jumper, with a best jump of 15.40 meters, and had a personal-best mark of 6.91 meters in the long jump.

==Professional career==
===Green Bay Packers===
After being drafted by the Green Bay Packers, Walker became the fourth player in NFL history to have 100 receiving yards in each of his first two playoff games (2002 vs. Atlanta, 2003 vs. Seattle). He was selected to the NFC&#x27;s Pro Bowl team for the first time for the 2004 season, following a breakout year.

After the 2004 season, Walker, backed by new agent Drew Rosenhaus, stated that he would not play for the Green Bay Packers again and would retire if he was not traded. Walker had been at odds with the organization since management refused to renegotiate his contract that had two years remaining on it after his Pro Bowl season in 2004, when he caught 89 passes for 1,382 yards and 12 touchdowns. &quot;I just don&#x27;t like the way the organization runs itself&quot;, Walker told ESPN.com. &quot;They want players to come up there and play hard and work hard, but when it comes time to be compensated, it&#x27;s like, &#x27;We forgot what you&#x27;ve done.&#x27;&quot; Walker also said quarterback Brett Favre&#x27;s comments on his plans to hold out for a better contract last year made living in Wisconsin difficult, and he felt it was unfair that the team let Favre interfere with Walker&#x27;s squabble with management. &quot;There&#x27;s an unwritten rule that players stick together,&quot; Walker said. Walker said he would not show up for training camp or come back at all for the final season of his contract regardless of whether Favre decided to retire or return. He said he&#x27;ll repay the Packers the prorated portion of his signing bonus to leave Green Bay. &quot;Why should I risk another year of getting beat up playing for a team that I don&#x27;t want to play for? That&#x27;s stupid&quot;, Walker said. Walker said he&#x27;ll be ready for the 2006 season wherever he lands. &quot;If I&#x27;m going to go out and take hits, it&#x27;s going to be for a team that I love playing for&quot;, Walker said. &quot;I&#x27;m not going to grandstand. I just want the Packers to give me peace of mind.&quot;

Ted Thompson released the following statement regarding the interview:
Walker eventually backed off of his threats to hold out and reported to camp. In the first game of the 2005 season, Walker injured his ACL on a pass from Favre. The Packers placed Walker on injured reserve for the remainder of the season.

===Denver Broncos===
The Packers traded Walker to the Denver Broncos for a second round pick in the 2006 NFL draft (later used by the Atlanta Falcons to select Jimmy F. Williams) on April 29, 2006. He signed a five-year deal worth more than $40 million, including roster bonuses totaling $15 million in 2007 and 2008. Walker recovered from his previous injury, and was productive during the 2006 season. He caught sixty-nine passes for 1,084 yards and eight touchdowns. Following the Broncos&#x27; season finale against the San Francisco 49ers, Walker was in a vehicle that was shot at in downtown Denver, killing teammate Darrent Williams. After Williams was shot, he fell into Walker&#x27;s lap. In memory of Williams, Walker wore a hairstyle called the &quot;fro-hawk&quot;, made famous by Williams, to begin the 2007 season. Walker said in an interview with Andrea Kremer of HBO&#x27;s &quot;Real Sports&quot; that the attacks likely stemmed from a confrontation with bar patrons involving rookie wideout Brandon Marshall and his cousin.

On February 29, 2008, the Broncos released Walker after being unable to trade him.

===Oakland Raiders===
On March 4, 2008, the Oakland Raiders signed Walker to a six-year, $55 million contract that included $16 million in guaranteed money. In November 2008, Walker announced that he&#x27;d miss the rest of the season due to injury. For the season, Walker played in eight games, had 15 receptions for 196 yards and one touchdown.

For the 2009 season, Walker played in only three games and had no statistics. He was released by the team on March 8, 2010.

For his two seasons of employment with the Raiders, Walker collected $21 million.

===Minnesota Vikings===
On August 23, 2010, it was reported Walker would sign with the Minnesota Vikings, who had also tried out Brandon Jones to make up the depth at wide receiver. Jones would later sign with the Seattle Seahawks. The signing was largely brought about due to Sidney Rice undergoing hip surgery and missing half of the season and health concerns about Percy Harvin, who suffered from recurring migraines.

Walker was released September 5, 2010, before the regular season opener.

===Suspension===
On December 11, 2010, Walker was suspended by the NFL for four games. Although four-game suspensions were at that time handed out by the league for violating either the league&#x27;s substance abuse policy or steroids policy, it was unclear which applied to Walker&#x27;s situation.

==Robbery incident==
Just after 7 A.M. on June 16, 2008, Walker was found unconscious in Las Vegas, Nevada, on a street just off the Las Vegas Strip. The previous evening, he had been at Body English, a nightclub at the Hard Rock Hotel in Las Vegas, and left at approximately 5 A.M. the following morning. After being found unconscious, Walker was taken to a local hospital with what police described as &quot;significant injuries,&quot; including a concussion. He was listed in fair condition and released from the hospital on June 18.

Police said Walker was the victim of an apparent robbery, as a large amount of cash and some jewelry were taken from him. Police arrested two suspects, one in late June (Arfat Fadel) and the other in early July. On July 7, 2010, Deshawn Lamont Thomas, an 11-time convicted felon, was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole for his part in the crime.

<doc id="1110441" wikidata="Q557630" url="?curid=1110441" title="Nechirvan Barzani">
<text>Nechirvan Idris Barzani (; ; born 21 September 1966) is an Iraqi Kurdish politician serving as the second President of the Kurdistan Region. He was elected into office by the Kurdistan Region Parliament in June 2019. Nechirvan Barzani was appointed as Vice President of the Kurdistan Democratic Party since 2010. He previously served as Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government from March 2007 to August 2009 and March 2012 to May 2019. Nechirvan Barzani is also the founder of the University Of Kurdistan Hewlêr, the region&#x27;s top ranking university located in Erbil.

==Early years==
Nechirvan Barzani was born in 1966 in Barzan, Kurdistan Region. The name Nêçîrvan means &quot;hunter&quot;. Barzani&#x27;s surname originates from his birthplace of Barzan. He is the grandson of Mustafa Barzani, a legendary Kurdish leader who led the Kurdish Revolution and armed resistance against the regimes of Iraq and was also the founder of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP).

Nechirvan Barzani&#x27;s father, Idris Mustafa Barzani, was a senior KDP leader and prominent political figure; he dedicated his entire life to fighting for the rights and freedoms of the Kurdish people alongside his father, and brother, Masoud Barzani, who served as the first president of the Kurdistan Region. In 1975, Nechirvan Barzani and his family, along with tens of thousands of Kurds living under Iraqi rule, were forced into exile into Iran to seek safety from Iraq&#x27;s Ba’ath regime which committed mass killings, forced displacement, cultural genocide, and tremendous brutality as part of its policies culminating with the Anfal genocide.

Following the footsteps of his father, uncle, and grandfather, Nechirvan Barzani became actively involved in Kurdish activism and politics. Often accompanying his father on official political visits to Middle Eastern and European countries lobbying for the Kurdish cause, he began developing his platform of political positions based on bringing about peace, stability, and justice to the Kurdish people.

==Education and personal life==
Nechirvan Barzani studied politics and international relations at the University of Tehran, Iran. He was awarded an honorary Doctor of Public Service degree from Washington and Jefferson College in Pennsylvania, United States in a ceremony held on 17 May 2008. Nechirvan Barzani is fluent in Kurdish, Persian, and English. He is fond of Kurdish and Persian poetry and literature. He is married to Nabila Barzani and they have five children together (Idris, Cheyavan, Danyal, Ranya and Maya).

==Political career==
Nechirvan Barzani was first elected to the KDP central committee at its tenth Congress in 1989 and re-elected at the 11th Congress in 1993, when he assumed a position in the political bureau. After the 1991 Gulf War, he participated in negotiations with the Iraqi government.

In 1996, Nechirvan Barzani was appointed Deputy Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG), established following the 1992 regional elections. In 1999, Nechirvan Barzani was appointed as Prime Minister of the Kurdistan Regional Government. He actively participated in the 2005 unification process between the main Kurdish Parties on forming a unified KRG.

===Prime Minister (2006–2009)===
In March 2006, Nechirvan Barzani lead the fifth cabinet, the first unified cabinet of the Kurdistan Regional Government. Many of Barzani&#x27;s supporters believe that he played an important role in developing the Kurdistan Region. During his first term as prime minister, his supporters nicknamed his cabinet as &quot;The Development Cabinet&quot; praising his work in the development of the Kurdistan Region. From September 2009 through January 2012, a Kurdish politician from the ruling KDP–PUK coalition, Barham Salih, assumed office as Prime Minister of the KRG.

===Prime Minister (2012–2019)===
Nechirvan Barzani was re-elected as prime minister in 2012. His political priorities focused on improving the standard of living in the Kurdistan Region, and strengthening peace, security, stability, foreign relations, and foreign investments. He presided consolidation and promotion of rights for women, as well as the ethnic and religious groups in the Region. Under his tenure, the Kurdistan Region underwent a widespread development program in its electricity, water, housing, and road infrastructure. During his tenure, more than thirty countries established their official representation offices in the Kurdistan Region.

In 2014, the war against the Islamic State impacted the Kurdistan Region. In addition to defense, the Kurdistan Region also hosted nearly two million displaced people who sought refuge in Kurdistan. Also, with the fall in international oil prices and Iraq&#x27;s failure to deliver the Region&#x27;s budget portion, the Region also entered a massive economic crisis. Barzani successfully used diplomatic means to rebuild relations with Baghdad and resume budgetary allotments peacefully.

Following the 2017 Kurdistan independence referendum, the Federal Iraqi Government took hostile policies and military actions against the Kurdistan Region. Barzani used his position to again normalize relations with Baghdad and to strengthen ties with the international community with an increased international diplomacy effort.

Nechirvan Barzani is also the Founder of the University Of Kurdistan Hewlêr (UKH), the highest ranked university in the region. He served as Chancellor of the institute from 2010 to 2019, with Dr. Mohammed Mochtar as his Vice Chancellor.

===President of the Kurdistan Region (2019–present)===

On 28 May 2019, out of 81 MPs who participated at the session, Nechirvan Barzani was elected as the President of Kurdistan Region by the votes of 68 MPs. Nechirvan Barzani was inaugurated as President of the Kurdistan Region in June 2019, succeeding his uncle. Citing democracy as one of the Kurdistan Region&#x27;s greatest achievements, in his inauguration speech he stated his duty as President of the Kurdistan Region is to continue strengthening Kurdistan&#x27;s democratic values and developing the government&#x27;s political, social and economic policies to improve those sectors as well as education, healthcare, and industry.

He has been recognized for his promotion of the rights of all ethnic and religious groups, continued inter-faith dialogue, and women&#x27;s rights. For this reason, Nechirvan Barzani received support from various ethnic and religious groups in the Kurdistan Region who believe his presidency enhances the likelihood that they will continue to be treated fairly with equal rights and freedoms in Kurdistan Region. His election as president signaled a mandate by the Kurdistan Region Parliament to continue advancing fair and equal treatment under his leadership. This has positioned Kurdistan as a leader that serves as an example for other nations in the Middle East.

President Barzani affirmed during his inauguration speech that he will continue plans to build solidarity with neighboring countries, strengthen relations with the international community, and to work closely with the federal government in Baghdad to jointly agree on solutions within the framework of the Constitution of Iraq.

As President, Nechirvan Barzani remains dedicated to continue his Yezidi rescue mission. Barzani established a special office in 2014 devoted to rescuing Yezidi survivors in ISIS terrorist captivity. More than 3,340 Yezidi victims have been liberated with the support of the office.

<doc id="1110443" wikidata="Q1059243" url="?curid=1110443" title="Chaim of Volozhin">
<text>Chaim of Volozhin (also known as Chaim ben Yitzchok of Volozhin or Chaim Ickovits; 21 January 1749 – 14 June 1821) was a rabbi, Talmudist, and ethicist. Popularly known as &quot;Reb Chaim Volozhiner&quot; or simply as &quot;Reb Chaim&quot;, he was born in Volozhin (now Valozhyn, Belarus) when it was a part of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. He died there while it was under the control of the Russian Empire.

The title of his major work is .

==Student of the Vilna Gaon==

Both Chaim and his elder brother Simcha (d. 1812) studied under Rabbi Aryeh Leib ben Asher Gunzberg, the author of the &quot;Shaagas Aryeh&quot;, who was then rabbi of Volozhin, and afterward under Rabbi Raphael ha-Kohen, (the author of the &quot;Toras Yekusiel&quot;), later of Hamburg.
Aged 25, Chaim became a disciple of Vilna Gaon. Using his new teacher&#x27;s method, he began his studies anew, returning to Torah, Mishnah, Talmud, and Hebrew grammar. His admiration for the gaon was boundless, and after his death Chaim virtually acknowledged no superior.

==Establishing the Volozhin Yeshiva==

It was with the view of applying the methods of the Vilna Gaon that Chaim founded the Volozhin yeshiva, then called Yeshivat Etz Chaim, in 1803 a yeshiva that remained in operation for almost 90 years until it was closed in 1892. The yeshiva became the &quot;mother of all Lithuanian-style yeshivas&quot;. He began with ten pupils, young residents of Volozhin, whom Chaim maintained at his own expense. It is related that his wife sold her jewelry to contribute to their maintenance.

The fame of the institution spread, and the number of its students increased, necessitating an appeal to which the Jews of Russia generously responded. Rabbi Chaim lived to see his yeshiva housed in its own building, and to preside over a hundred disciples. He saw one of his students establish his own yeshiva, in Mir.

Chaim continued to teach the Vilna Gaon&#x27;s study method of penetrating analysis of the Talmudic text, seeking to elicit the intent and meaning of the writing of the &quot;Rishonim&quot;. This approach was followed by all the great Lithuanian yeshivas, such as Slobodka yeshiva, Mir Yeshiva, Ponevezh yeshiva, Kelm yeshiva, Kletsk yeshiva, and Telz yeshiva.

== Works ==

Rav Chaim&#x27;s major work is the &quot;Nefesh Ha-Chaim&quot; (&quot;Living Soul&quot;). It deals with complex understandings of the nature of God, but also with secrets of prayer and the importance of Torah, and the purpose being &quot;to implant the fear of God, Torah, and pure worship into the hearts of the upright who are seeking the ways of God&quot;. It presents a clear and orderly kabbalistic &quot;Weltanschauung&quot; that addresses many of the same issues as the Hasidic texts of the day. The work is generally viewed as the Lithuanian response to Hasidism, albeit in a much less harsh manner than the criticisms of Hasidim voiced by Rav Chaim&#x27;s predecessors such as the Vilna Gaon and Rav Yechezkel Landau. Norman Lamm described its structure:
In addition, Chaim wrote &quot;Ruach Chaim&quot;, published posthumously. It is a commentary on &quot;Pirkei Avoth&quot;. Both titles also play on his name, &quot;Chaim&quot;. Thus, for example, &quot;The Spirit of Life&quot; can also be translated as &quot;Chaim&#x27;s Spirit&quot; or &quot;Chaim&#x27;s Soul&quot;.

Many of Chaim&#x27;s responsa on halakhic subjects were lost by fire in 1815.

==Family==

Chaim&#x27;s brother, known as Zalman of Volozhin, is considered to have been among the greatest students of the Vilna Gaon. Zalman of Volozhin&#x27;s biography, the hagiographical Toldos Adam, includes many anecdotes related to the author by Rabbi Chaim. Rabbi Chaim&#x27;s son, Yitzchak, took over the leadership of the yeshiva upon his father&#x27;s death in 1821. Yitzchak&#x27;s daughter, Rivka, was married to Rabbi Eliezer Yitzchak Fried, her first cousin. (Eliezer Yitzchak&#x27;s mother, Esther, was Yitzchak&#x27;s sister.) Another of Yitzchak&#x27;s daughters married Naftali Zvi Yehuda Berlin aka the &quot;Netziv&quot;. Among Rabbi Chaim&#x27;s descendants are the Soloveitchik family, such as his great-grandson Yosef Dov Soloveitchik.

<text>The Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Song () was written to commemorate the Generalissimo and President Chiang Kai-shek of the Republic of China. There are two songs: the second song was written by Hwang Yau-tai or Huang Yu-ti (Huang Youdi, 黃友棣) in 1975, who later also wrote Chiang Ching-kuo Memorial Song in 1988.

&quot;Jiang Gong Memorial Song&quot; used to be sung in schools and was also popular with military song competitions; when Chiang Kai-shek died, this song was also played for one month as an act of mourning. However, with the democratization of politics, this song is no longer included in current music textbooks, and schools no longer teach this song. However, on Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s birthday and the Veterans&#x27; Day, veterans sing this to express their condolences; this song is also played on folk festivals.

==Official version==
This was the officially adopted version of Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Song written by Li Chung-he and Zhang Ling.

==Initial version==

The initial version was written by 秦孝儀 (Chin Hsiao-I) and 黃友棣 (Hwang Yau-tai) shortly after Chiang&#x27;s death. However this version was officially replaced by the officially adopted version written by Li Chung-he (李中和) and Zhang Ling (張齡).

Compared to the officially adopted version, this version was written in vernacular language and was longer in context. The melody was also completely different.

At the time of the harvest of the maize crop, which is the main crop of this region, to express happiness and to enjoy after a hard toil, locals celebrate Minjar festival. This week long fare/ Mela is the most popular Mela of Chamba. 

* Chaurasi Temple : Nestled on the bank of the river Ravi, Chamba town complete 1000 years of its existence. The town stands on a plateau on the right bank of the Ravi river valley between Dhauladhar and Zanskar ranges south of the inner Himalayas. This town was founded by Raja Sahil Varman in the beginning of 10th century. In the genealogical rolls of the Chamba Rajas, a reference occurs of place, which was adorned with highly fragrant Champaka trees and guarded by Goddess Champavati.

The temple was built by Sahil Varman in the honour of his daughter Champavati who is worshipped as a goddess in Chamba. This journey of one thousand years is a repository a civilised, cultured and developed society which existed in the lap of the Himalayas. The unique architect of houses and temples, splendid wood and metal craft, world fame Chamba Rumal and Chappal and the pahari paintings are some salient features of this one thousand years young town.

The Chamba town has a number of temples, Palaces and stylised buildings. Laxmi Narayana Temple, which is the main temple of Chamba town, was built by Sahil Varman in the 10th century AD. There are several other temples within the complex.

The temple of Radha Krishna, Shiva Temple of Chandergupta and Gauri Shankar Temple are among these. The ancient temple of Vajreshwari is believed to be 1000 years old and is dedicated to Devi Vajreshwari-Goddess of lightning.

The Sui Mata temple can be divided into three parts which can physically spread apart. The Hari Rai temple is dedicated to Lord Vishnu and dates back to 11th century.

Reference of Chamba town would be incomplete without the majestic Chaugan. It is the heart and hub centre of all activities in Chamba. Tradition is silent as to its use as a polo ground and the name is etymologically distinct from Chaugan, the Persian name of Polo, being of Sanskrit origin and meaning &#x27;four-sided&#x27;. Initially the five Chaugan were a single patch of meadow.

To mark the completion of 1000 years of this town, the Government of Himachal Pradesh had celebrated the millennium of this town from 14 to 20 April 2006 in a most befitting way. The celebrations has provided the people the opportunity to have a firsthand knowledge of the rich cultural and historical past of the Chamba town.

<doc id="1110450" wikidata="Q140289" url="?curid=1110450" title="N-Acetylmuramic acid">
<text>&quot;N&quot;-Acetylmuramic acid (NAM or MurNAc) is an organic compound with the chemical formula . It is a monomer of peptidoglycan in most bacterial cell walls, which is built from alternating units of &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) and &quot;N&quot;-acetylmuramic acid, cross-linked by oligopeptides at the lactic acid residue of MurNAc. 

==Formation of NAM==
NAM is an addition product of phosphoenolpyruvate and &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine. This addition happens exclusively in the cell cytoplasm. 

==Clinical significance==
&quot;N&quot;-Acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) is part of the peptidoglycan polymer of bacterial cell walls. MurNAc is covalently linked to &quot;N&quot;-acetylglucosamine and may also be linked through the hydroxyl on carbon number 4 to the carbon of L-alanine. A pentapeptide composed of L-alanyl-D-isoglutaminyl-L-lysyl-D-alanyl-D-alanine is added to the MurNAc in the process of making the peptidoglycan strands of the cell wall.

Synthesis of NAM is inhibited by fosfomycin.

NAG and NAM cross-linking can be inhibited by antibiotics to inhibit pathogens from growing within the body. Therefore, both NAG and NAM are valuable polymers in medicinal research.

<doc id="1110452" wikidata="Q518920" url="?curid=1110452" title="Fox Chase, Philadelphia">
<text>Fox Chase is a neighborhood in Northeast Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States.

==History==

Fox Chase was historically part of Lower Dublin Township, also known as Dublin Township, a defunct township located in Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania. The township ceased to exist and was incorporated into the City of Philadelphia following the passage of the Act of Consolidation, 1854.

Philadelphia&#x27;s elite once flocked to opulent vacation homes built in the lush fringes bordering the city. The area&#x27;s character changed with the arrival of the railroad in 1876. Many of Philadelphia&#x27;s aristocracy began to discover the attractiveness of suburban living, and built mansions here, using the railroad for convenient transport into the city. The neighborhood was named after affluent colonists came to hunt in the region. 

Fox Chase was the setting for one of America&#x27;s longest running cold cases. In February 1957, the battered body of a small boy was found in a cardboard box off in the woods off Susquehanna Road. Investigators were mystified and were unable to determine his identity. Nicknamed &quot;The Boy in the Box&quot;, &quot;America&#x27;s Unknown Child&quot;, and sometimes &quot;The Fox Chase Boy&quot;. He was identified as Joseph Augustus Zarelli in 2022.

==Location and surrounding areas==
The Fox Chase section is located on the border with Montgomery County and there is an active and cooperative business community that crosses the county line into Rockledge and Huntingdon Valley.

One of many parks located within Fox Chase is Pennypack Park. It is composed of woodlands, meadows and wetlands. The banks of the Pennypack Creek runs through the park from Pine Road in Fox Chase all the way to the Delaware River. The area also includes playgrounds, hiking and bike trails as well as bridle paths for horseback riding. The Pennypack Environmental Center on Verree Road is also located within the neighborhood. Many historic structures are still intact throughout Fox Chase. The Verree House on Verree Road was the site of a raid by British troops during the American Revolutionary War. The trained eye can rediscover abandoned railroad grades, remnants of early mills, mill races and other reminders that generations of mankind have gathered in the &quot;Green Heart&quot; of Northeast Philadelphia.
Fox Chase Farm is one of the few remaining active farms in Philadelphia County and is used extensively by the School District of Philadelphia. It began in 1683 as a land grant from William Penn to Lord Stanley and then passed to the McVeigh family for over 100 years. Later, the Wistar family developed it into a self-sufficient farm until it became a Gentlemen&#x27;s Farm owned by two farmers, Lorimer and Butler. Friends of Fox Chase Farm, an all-volunteer group, currently assists in maintaining and preserving this pastoral treasure for present and future generations.

William Rhawn, president of the National Bank of the Republic in 1879, built a summer residence here. To design the project, he chose architect Frank Furness, whose work was synonymous with the mansions and public buildings of the Gilded Age. The banker&#x27;s country estate includes a carriage house and gatekeeper&#x27;s house. He called the estate “Knowlton” because it resembled the estate in England of Rhawn&#x27;s wife&#x27;s great-grandfather, John Knowles. It has since been converted into a catering establishment.
Ryerss Mansion is also located in Fox Chase. The house was built by merchant Joseph Waln Ryerss in 1859 and dramatically overlooks Burholme Park, one of the highest vistas in Philadelphia. The mansion is home to a massive and eccentric collection of artifacts and antiquities from around the world, collected during the Ryerss family&#x27;s extensive travels and exotic sojourns, from Europe, to Africa, to the Far East.

Among the historic properties located in this neighborhood are:
* Knowlton Mansion, designed by Frank Furness; on the National Register of Historic Places
* Ryerss Mansion, home of Joseph Waln Ryerss; on the National Register of Historic Places
* The Verree House, site of a raid by British troops during the American Revolutionary War

==Demographics==

The median age is 36.6 years for males and 39.0 years for females. Married couples made up 40.3 percent of the neighborhood&#x27;s population. The neighborhood was 80.37 Caucasian, 8.63 percent African American, 4.75 percent Asian, 2.58 percent mixed race, .07 percent Native Hawaiian and 3.6 percent other race.

The median household income for Fox Chase was $54,870 in 2011, compared with $34,207 for Philadelphia as a whole. The population below the poverty level in Fox Chase was 10 percent, compared with 28.4 percent for Philadelphia.

==Business==

The largest employer of Fox Chase is the internationally known Fox Chase Cancer Center, a unique facility that merges cancer research with the treatment of cancer. Its researchers have won Nobel Prizes for their contributions.

<doc id="1110459" wikidata="Q970914" url="?curid=1110459" title="James Hall (paleontologist)">
<text>James Hall Jr. (September 12, 1811 – August 7, 1898) was an American geologist and paleontologist. He was a noted authority on stratigraphy and had an influential role in the development of paleontology in the United States.

==Early life==

James Hall was born in Hingham, Massachusetts, the oldest of four children. His parents, James Hall Sr. and Sousanna Dourdain Hall, had emigrated from England two years earlier. Hall developed an early interest in science and enrolled in Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, a recently established college that emphasized student participation and focused on science. He was a student of Amos Eaton and Ebenezer Emmons, both notable geologists. Hall graduated with honors in 1832, received his master&#x27;s degree in 1833, and remained at Rensselaer to teach chemistry and later geology.

In 1836 a multi-year survey was established to collect information on the geology and natural history of New York. For purposes of the survey, the state was divided into four districts, and Hall became assistant geologist for Ebenezer Emmons, chief of the Second District. Hall&#x27;s initial assignment was to study iron deposits in the Adirondack Mountains. The following year the survey was reorganized: Hall was put in charge of the Fourth District, in western New York. Other notable geologists working on the survey included Lardner Vanuxem and Timothy Conrad. Working together, the survey staff developed a stratigraphy for New York and set a precedent for naming stratigraphic divisions based on local geography.

At the end of the survey in 1841, Hall was named the first state paleontologist. In 1843 he made his final report on the survey of the fourth geological district, which was published as &quot;Geology of New York&quot;, Part IV. (1843). It was received with much acclaim and became a classic in the field. Hall had built a solid reputation and was to devote the rest of his life to stratigraphic geology and invertebrate paleontology.

He was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1854.

Hall built a laboratory in Albany, New York, which became an important center of study and training for aspiring geologists and paleontologists. Many notable scientists began their career serving an apprenticeship with Hall, including Fielding Meek, Charles Walcott, Charles Beecher and Josiah Whitney. Now known as the James Hall Office, the laboratory was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976.

Among his many works, James Hall identified that stromatolite fossils discovered at Petrified Sea Gardens, a site near Saratoga Springs, New York that is now also a National Historic Landmark, were originally organic.

==Later years==

After his work in New York, Hall extended his studies to other regions of the country. In 1850 Hall participated in a geological survey of northern Michigan and Wisconsin, where he identified the first fossil reefs ever found in North America. He was appointed state geologist for Iowa (1855–1858) and Wisconsin (1857–1860). In addition, several other state survey programs sought out Hall for his expertise and advice. In 1866 he was made director of the New York State Museum of Natural History in Albany. In 1893 he was appointed the State Geologist of New York.

Between 1847 and 1894 Hall published 13 volumes of &quot;The Palaeontology of New York&quot;, his principal contribution in the field. This massive work consisted of over 4500 pages and 1000 full-page illustrations. In addition, Hall wrote more than 30 other books, published over 1000 works, and contributed sections to several federal and state publications on geology.

He was a founding member of the National Academy of Sciences and the first president of the Geological Society of America. He was one of the founders of the International Geologic Congress and served as a vice-president at their sessions in Paris, Bologna, and Berlin. He was elected one of the fifty foreign members of the Geological Society of London in 1848, and in 1858 was awarded its Wollaston Medal. In 1884 he was elected correspondent of the French Academy of Sciences.

At the age of 85 he traveled to St. Petersburg to attend the International Geological Congress and also participate in an expedition to the Ural Mountains. Hall died two years later in Bethlehem, New Hampshire. He is buried at the Albany Rural Cemetery, Albany, New York.

A residence hall at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute is named after James Hall. It is officially known as Hall Hall.

==Family==
In 1838 Hall married Sarah Aikin, the daughter of a Troy lawyer. They had two daughters and two sons. Sarah helped illustrate some of Hall&#x27;s publications. In 1849 she published an illustrated book of poetry, &quot;Phantasia, and other poems&quot;. Included in this volume was her English translation of Schiller&#x27;s &quot;Ritter Toggenburg&quot;. She died in 1895.

<doc id="1110468" wikidata="Q609931" url="?curid=1110468" title="Norman Shelley">
<text>Norman Shelley (16 February 1903 – 21 August 1980) was a British actor, best known for his work in radio, in particular for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot;. He also had a recurring role as Colonel Danby in the long-running radio soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot;.

Perhaps Shelley&#x27;s single best-known role was as Winnie-the-Pooh in &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; adaptations of A.A. Milne&#x27;s stories; for many British people of the mid-20th century, his is the definitive voice of Pooh.
Other roles for &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; included Dr. Watson (opposite Carleton Hobbs as Holmes) in the 1952–1969 Sherlock Holmes radio series; Toad in Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;; and the role of Dennis the Dachshund in the specially written &quot;Toytown&quot; series. Shelley also played the parts of Gandalf and Tom Bombadil in the 1955-56 radio adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. In the 1973 BBC television series &quot;Jack the Ripper&quot; Shelley played Detective Constable Walter Dew.

== Life and career ==
Shelley was born in Chelsea, London, the son of Frank Shelley, a painter, and his wife, Alice Campbell, née Glover. He originally intended to make a career as an aircraft designer, but took up stage acting on the advice of the actress and teacher Rosina Fillipi. His public debut was at the Old Vic in 1919, and in the early 1920s he toured with the Charles Doran Shakespeare Company, performing such roles as Trebonius in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and Sebastian in &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;. During the 1920s and early &#x27;30s he worked principally in London, and was particularly associated with Peter Godfrey&#x27;s experimental productions at the Gate Theatre Studio.

Shelley&#x27;s first BBC broadcast was in 1926, having earlier made a reputation in radio in Australia and New Zealand. By the late &#x27;30s he established a reputation as a respected and versatile British radio actor. In 1937 he married Monica Daphne, née Brett. During the Second World War he was a member of the BBC&#x27;s wartime repertory company, but left to serve as a ferry pilot in the Air Transport Auxiliary. He worked regularly under producer director Raymond Raikes.

In the 1930s and &#x27;40s he was a &quot;Children&#x27;s Hour&quot; regular, famous as Dennis the Dachshund in earlier episodes of &quot;Toytown&quot;, and as Winnie-the-Pooh, whom he first played in 1939. For seventeen years, he played Dr Watson alongside Carleton Hobbs&#x27;s Sherlock Holmes from October 1952 to July 1969. Their long-running series of adaptations aired on the Home Service and later, the Light Programme.

In the late 1950s he took part in recorded dramatised versions by Argo Records of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1958) and &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;, both directed by Douglas Cleverdon and both starring Jane Asher in the title role. For the same company he also recorded his impersonation of Toad in &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; (1960) with Richard Goolden as Mole.

Late in life he found new fame as Colonel Freddy Danby in the BBC radio serial &quot;The Archers&quot;. He was still recording episodes of &quot;The Archers&quot; at the time of his death. He collapsed suddenly at Finchley Road tube station, London, on 21 August 1980, and was declared dead in the Royal Free Hospital, Hampstead. His wife had predeceased him; he was buried near her at Long Hanborough, Oxfordshire, on 28 August.

== Churchill impersonation ==
A recurring rumour holds that, because the House of Commons was not set up for location recording at that time, some of Winston Churchill&#x27;s most famous speeches to Parliament during the Second World War were subsequently recorded for radio broadcast by Shelley, impersonating Churchill. The rumour has been promoted by David Irving, to support his unflattering view of Churchill.

It is difficult to prove or disprove Irving&#x27;s claims. Analysis of the voice patterns in 20 of Churchill&#x27;s recorded speeches show that three made in May and June 1940 do not match those provably by him, although Churchill might have recorded them after his voice had changed. According to one source, it is unproven whether Shelley is the speaker and, if so, whether the speeches were broadcast as having been spoken by Churchill.

One report states Shelley did record a performance of Churchill&#x27;s &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot; speech, which is claimed to be one of the three non-matching speeches. However, Shelley&#x27;s 78rpm record is dated 7 September 1942, whereas Churchill&#x27;s speech was broadcast on 4 June 1940, key parts being read out by a BBC announcer. Shelley claimed that, with Churchill&#x27;s permission, he did once voice Churchill for an introduction to a wartime propaganda film for distribution overseas, because the Prime Minister could not find time for the necessary visit to the studio.

According to Shelley&#x27;s great friend, former BBC radio and TV producer and presenter, Trevor Hill, Shelley did stand in for Churchill on at least three occasions, specifically when Churchill was ill or out of the country. That would never have been divulged at the time. Shelley&#x27;s party piece, apparently often requested, was for everyone to close their eyes while he impersonated Churchill, and on those occasions, according to Hill, it was impossible to tell the difference.

In 1949, Churchill re-recorded most of his speeches at his home at Chartwell. The EMI engineer responsible for the recordings has told the BECTU History Project that he used one of the then new British Tape Recorders, and that Churchill usually did the recording in bed, so the speeches have a more relaxed air than the original broadcast. They are often the versions that are played today.

<text>Chernyshevskoye (; , from 1938: &quot;Eydtkau&quot;; ) is a settlement in Nesterovsky District in the eastern part of Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, close to the border with Lithuania. Between Chernyshevskoye and Lithuanian Kybartai is an important 24-hour border crossing point on the A229 principal road (part of the European route E28) and the railway route connecting Kaliningrad with Moscow through Lithuania and Belarus.

==History==
The settlement was first mentioned in the 16th century, when the area was part of the Polish Duchy of Prussia, near where its eastern border ran as stipulated by the 1422 Treaty of Melno. 

Incorporated into the Prussian province of East Prussia, Eydtkuhnen became the eastern terminus and border station of the Prussian Eastern Railway in 1860, connecting Berlin with the Saint Petersburg–Warsaw Railway in the Russian Empire. To continue their voyage, passengers—e.g., of the &quot;Nord Express&quot; luxury train coming from Saint Petersburg—had to change over from Russian broad gauge to standard gauge railcars to Berlin and Paris, leaving on the other side of the platform. The same interchange in the opposite direction was provided at the Russian train station in neighboring Virbalis (&quot;Wirballen&quot;). The Eydtkuhnen station building, erected according to plans by Friedrich August Stüler, offered luxuriously furnished waiting rooms and restaurants. 

The railway connection decisively promoted Eydtkuhnen&#x27;s development: the Neo-Romanesque Lutheran parish church was built according to plans by Friedrich Adler and consecrated in 1889; the settlement received town privileges in 1922, when the population reached 10,000. Nevertheless, Eydtkuhnen was devastated during the Russian invasion of East Prussia in 1914 and again in 1945 during the East Prussian Offensive of the Red Army. After World War I and the Act of Independence, the border crossing led to Lithuania, while corridor trains provided the railway connection to Berlin.

With the implementation of the Oder-Neisse line after World War II, the area became part of the Soviet Union, while the remaining German population was expelled. Up to today, large parts of Chernyshevskoye are a military restricted area.

==Notable people==
* Gertrud von Puttkamer (1881–1944), writer
* Wilhelm Gaerte (1890 (Eydtkuhnen) – 1958 (Hanover)), archaeologist, museum director 
* Felix Bressart (1892–1949), actor
* Barnett A. Elzas (1867–1936), rabbi and historian
* Herbert Kirrinnis (1907–1977), gymnasium teacher and historian

<text>Un-Led-Ed is the debut album by Dread Zeppelin, released in 1990. The album received a public endorsement by Led Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant, who claimed he preferred Dread Zeppelin&#x27;s cover of &quot;Your Time Is Gonna Come&quot; to the Led Zeppelin original.

==Recording==
Initial recording sessions for the album took place exclusively at The Chapel in Encino, California in 1989. Co-producer, Rasta Li-Mon (R. Lee Manning) was the house engineer for owner, Dave Stewart of Eurythmics. The first sessions yielded two vinyl 45 singles, &quot;Immigrant Song&quot; b/w &quot;Hey Hey What Can I Do&quot; and &quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; b/w &quot;Tour-Telvis: A Bad Trip&quot;. Both singles were released by Birdcage Records in 1989.

After selling out multiple runs of the singles in various vinyl colors, Birdcage gave the go-ahead to record a full album. The original concept was to lampoon each Led Zeppelin album in its original order but that was scrapped for more of a hodgepodge approach that could include Dread Zeppelin live favorites like &quot;Black Dog&quot; and &quot;Heartbreaker.&quot;

Un-Led-Ed was 90% finished when Dread Zeppelin were signed to I.R.S. Records who arranged for the final recording sessions at Club 56 Studio in Burbank, California. Two songs were recorded: &quot;Black Dog&quot; and &quot;(All I Want For Christmas Is) My Two Front Teeth.&quot; Both songs feature new drummer, Fresh Cheese &#x27;n&#x27; Cheese (Paul Maselli). Original percussionist, Cheese (Curt Lichter), had left the band after the Chapel recordings.

&quot;Hey Hey What Can I Do&quot; and &quot;Tour-Telvis: A Bad Trip&quot; were not included on &quot;Un Led-Ed&quot; but appear on a Birdcage Records cassette-only compilation called &quot;Kom Gib Mir Deine Zeppelin&quot; and various I.R.S. single B-sides. &quot;All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth&quot; appears on a 1990 I.R.S. Christmas sampler called &quot;Just in Time for Christmas&quot;.

A fourth extra track, &quot;Un-Led-Ed,&quot; a psychedelic pastiche incorporating several songs from the album and meant to be somewhat of an overture, was cut from the album due to copyright considerations. The song appears as &quot;Un-Led-Eddd (in 3D)&quot; on Dread Zeppelin&#x27;s 1995 album for Birdcage Records, No Quarter Pounder.

The album features a guest appearance by former Lemony Sykes vocalist George-John Chocolatto.

==Album cover==
Birdcage Records art director, Bryant Fernandez, and producer, Jah Paul Jo, envisioned the album to incorporate a gameboard. A mock Monopoly board was created using Led Zeppelin, reggae music and Elvis Presley references for the properties and utilities. This concept was eventually used for the inside of the album. When the band signed to I.R.S., the idea was pitched to do a cover along the lines of the children&#x27;s toy where magnetic shavings are manipulated by a magnet to make different hair styles. Artist Hugh Brown created a mock-up for this cover, but the idea was rejected as being too costly. Brown then created the cover that is now used, pictures of the band surrounded by branches and colored lights.

==Controversy==
At the behest of the Elvis Presley estate, the photo of Tortelvis (Greg Tortell) on the cover of &quot;Un Led-Ed&quot; was blacked out. Later editions of the album have Tortelvis&#x27; giant Elvis coif replaced by a multi-colored rasta wig. The photos of Tortelvis on the Monopoly-style gameboard were also blacked out.

The first pressings of &quot;Un Led-Ed&quot; were distributed by MCA Records in the United States. These copies show Tortelvis with original hair and photo on the gameboard. Within a month, I.R.S. changed distributors to EMI who distributed copies of the edited cover.

The original Ed Zeppelin was played by Bryant Fernandez. His photo is on the gameboard in the inside of the CD. When Bryant left the group after DZ&#x27;s first North American tour, his twin brother, Bruce Fernandez, took over the Ed Zeppelin role. His photo is on the front cover.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated that the album &quot;works partly because the idea is so weird and partly because the band members (Ed Zeppelin, Jah Paul Jo, Carljah, Put-Mon and Fresh Cheese) are actually rather impressive musicians.&quot;

<text>Berowra railway station is a suburban railway station located on the Main Northern line, serving the Sydney suburb of Berowra. It is served by Sydney Trains T1 North Shore Line services and intercity Central Coast &amp; Newcastle Line services.

==History==
Berowra station opened on 7 April 1887 when the Main Northern line was extended from Hornsby to Hawkesbury River. In 1909, the line was duplicated and the present island platform built.

On 23 October 1983, a passing loop was opened opposite the platform. This allowed suburban services to terminate, and from January 1992, Berowra became the northern boundary of the Sydney suburban network replacing Cowan.

On 28 August 2006, Platform 3 opened on the passing loop as part of the Rail Clearways Program, to allow suburban trains to terminate clear of the running lines. Trains now terminate on the middle Platform 2, allowing through trains to overtake any terminating trains standing in the station. The upgrade also included provision of lifts, a new over-rail bridge for general station access and additional wet weather protection.

On 22 January 2007, Berowra station was almost engulfed as bushfires swept the Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park. Efforts from firefighters saved the station and a train which had terminated there.

In February 2024, a man and woman were struck and killed by a freight train while attempting to cross the tracks at Berowra station. The incident was ruled an accident.

<doc id="1110484" wikidata="Q2830607" url="?curid=1110484" title="Alan Tonks">
<text>Alan Tonks (born April 2, 1943) is a former Canadian politician. He was the Liberal MP for the federal riding of York South—Weston in Toronto from 2000 to 2011, and was the Metro Toronto Chairman from 1987 to 1997.

==Background==
Tonks is the son of the late Christopher Alexander Tonks (1917-2006), who was a reeve (1957-1960), deputy reeve, Board of Control member and alderman in what was first the Township and then the Borough of York (1969-1988) in Metropolitan Toronto. After graduating from York Memorial Collegiate Institute Tonks&#x27; father ran Tonks Hardware and Electric at 452 Rogers Road founded by his grandfather. Alan Tonks attended York University, where he earned a master&#x27;s degree in political economy, and the University of Toronto, where he received a master&#x27;s degree in education. He spent time working for a Canadian aid agency in Jamaica before becoming a junior high teacher for the Scarborough Board of Education for several years.

Married to Cecile, Tonks has three adult children, Chris, Matthew, and Alison. His son Chris is a former trustee on the Toronto District School Board.

==Local/municipal politics==
Tonks entered municipal politics in 1978 and served as a member of the Board of Control in York from 1978 to 1980. He lost his first bid for they mayoralty in 1980 before serving as mayor from 1982 to 1988.

Due to a change in the Act governing Metropolitan Toronto, the position of Metro Chairman, beginning in 1988, had to be elected from Metro Councillors who were themselves elected to represent specific wards. Mayors continued to sit on Metro Council on an ex-officio basis but were now ineligible to be candidates for Metro Chairman as were former or non-members of Metro Council. Accordingly, incumbent Metro Chairman Dennis Flynn, a former mayor of Etobicoke, had to run for Metro Councillor in a specific ward if he wanted to remain Metro Chairman. Similarly, Tonks, who wished to become Metro Chairman, could not run for that position while being Mayor of York. Accordingly, in the 1988 municipal election, he did not run for re-election as Mayor of York and instead ran for the position of Metro Councillor representing one of York&#x27;s two Metro wards.

At the first Metro Council session following the municipal election, Tonks was elected Chairman of the Municipality of Metropolitan Toronto by the other members of Metro Toronto Council defeating incumbent Metro Chairman Dennis Flynn, the only time a sitting Metro Chairman would be defeated by a challenger.

Tonks served as Metro Chairman until 1997 when the position was replaced with that of Mayor of Toronto. Tonks led the Transition Team responsible for administering the new City of Toronto. He did not run in the 1997 election for the position of mayor and retired from elected municipal politics. In 1999, he was appointed chair of the Greater Toronto Services Board and served until 2000 when he became a federal member of parliament.

==Provincial politics==
He first ran for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1975 provincial election as a candidate of the Ontario Liberal Party, and finished third in York South against former New Democratic Party leader Donald C. MacDonald. He was also unsuccessful in the 1987 Ontario election, losing to NDP leader Bob Rae by only 333 votes in York South.

==Federal politics==
He was elected to the House of Commons of Canada in the 2000 election as the Liberal MP for York South—Weston defeating Independent MP (and former Liberal) John Nunziata by 1,497 votes. In 2003 he served as a parliamentary secretary to the Minister for the Environment. He was re-elected by a much greater margin in the federal elections held in 2004. He served as a member of the official opposition from 2006 to 2011, when he lost his seat by around 2500 votes to the NDP&#x27;s Mike Sullivan.

<doc id="1110492" wikidata="Q1309785" url="?curid=1110492" title="Almondvale Stadium">
<text>Almondvale Stadium, also known as The Home of the Set Fare Arena for sponsorship purposes, but commonly referred to as &#x27;The Spaghettihad&#x27; (alluding to Manchester City&#x27;s Etihad Stadium), is a football stadium, located in the Almondvale area of Livingston, West Lothian, Scotland. It has been the home ground of Scottish Championship club Livingston since 1995, and has an all-seater capacity of 9,713.

==History==
The stadium was constructed in 1995 as a joint venture between Edinburgh football club Meadowbank Thistle F.C. and the Livingston Development Corporation (LDC). Part of the deal involved the relocation of Meadowbank Thistle to the town and a name change to Livingston. When the LDC was wound up, ownership of the Stadium was transferred to West Lothian Council. It is hired by Livingston from West Lothian Council every year. Livingston initially rapidly moved up the divisions of Scottish football, and the stadium was expanded to meet Scottish Premier League (SPL) standards in time for the club&#x27;s promotion to the top flight in 2001. The record attendance for a Livingston match at Almondvale is 10,112 and was set during that first season in the SPL, for a match against Rangers on 27 October 2001.

The stadium has changed names several times due to sponsorship deals. However, supporters of the club continue to call the stadium Almondvale or the &#x27;Vale. It was previously officially titled the City Stadium in the early 2000s due to a sponsorship deal with the City group. It had also been called the West Lothian Courier Stadium before that. However, after the club were taken over by the Lionheart Consortium in 2005, it reverted to its original name, Almondvale Stadium. It was renamed &#x27;Braidwood Motor Company Stadium&#x27; in a three-year naming rights deal in May 2010. In June 2013, it was renamed again for sponsorship reasons to &#x27;Energy Assets Arena&#x27;. In September 2015, it was renamed again for sponsorship reasons to its current name of &#x27;Tony Macaroni Arena&#x27;. The club announced the end of the sponsorship deal in March 2024.

On 7 April 2011, there were rumours that the stadium could be sold off to a supermarket development, and in turn finance a new stadium, of slightly smaller design, a mile away. However, nothing came of these rumours.

==Structure and facilities==
Almondvale is a 9,713 capacity all-seater ground. It has four stands which are all roughly of the same height and two corners of the ground are filled with covered seating. There is an open corner on one side of the West Stand and there is also the 5-storey stadium house in the other corner of the ground which is primarily used for conferences and offices. All the stands are one tier high and the stadium has four large floodlights, one situated at each corner of the ground. The stadium is covered and shielded from the weather elements by the roof and the windshields at the side of the stands. Almondvale also has a red blaes pitch and fully operational under-soil heating.

==Women&#x27;s football==
In August 1997, Almondvale hosted the Scotland–England women&#x27;s international match. In 2001, Almondvale was named the Scottish Football Association&#x27;s centre for women&#x27;s football. It hosted the Scottish Women&#x27;s Cup final and the national team&#x27;s matches from 2001 to 2004.

The stadium has become the home ground of Hibernian W.F.C. in 2021–22.

==Other uses==
In 2008, Gretna played one match in the stadium, a 3–0 loss against Celtic, when their temporary home (Fir Park) had problems with its pitch.

In 2013, Albion Rovers played their cup tie against Rangers at Almondvale in front of a crowd of 5,345.

Over the years it has also been chosen to host Scotland under-21, under-19 and under-17 matches.

The stadium has hosted the 2012 and the 2013 Challenge Cup finals. On 27 May 2012, the stadium hosted the 2012 Scottish Junior Cup Final.

Hibernian Reserves also used the Stadium.

==Location and transport==

The town of Livingston is situated in the central belt of Scotland, approximately 18 miles west of Edinburgh and 33 miles east of Glasgow, and easily accessible from the M8 motorway. The stadium is located at the centre of the town, in the Almondvale district, near the shopping centre and situated by the River Almond. The ground is signposted reasonably well around the town for the convenience of road traffic. Parking spaces are abundantly found in close proximity to the stadium, either near the shopping centre or at the stadium.

There are two railway stations in reach of the ground; Livingston North and Livingston South. The North station is served by trains from Edinburgh and Glasgow and is about a 30-minute walk away from the ground. The South station also receives trains from both Edinburgh and Glasgow and is about a 40-minute walk away from the stadium. In addition to the train stations, the central bus terminal at Livingston is located on Almondvale Avenue, 5 minutes walk from the ground.

<doc id="1110499" wikidata="Q3115511" url="?curid=1110499" title="Higman–Sims graph">
<text>In mathematical graph theory, the Higman–Sims graph is a 22-regular undirected graph with 100 vertices and 1100 edges. It is the unique strongly regular graph srg(100,22,0,6), where no neighboring pair of vertices share a common neighbor and each non-neighboring pair of vertices share six common neighbors. It was first constructed by and rediscovered in 1968 by Donald G. Higman and Charles C. Sims as a way to define the Higman–Sims group, a subgroup of index two in the group of automorphisms of the Hoffman–Singleton graph.

==Construction==
===From M22 graph===
Take the M22 graph, a strongly regular graph srg(77,16,0,4) and augment it with 22 new vertices corresponding to the points of S(3,6,22), each block being connected to its points, and one additional vertex &quot;C&quot; connected to the 22 points.

===From Hoffman–Singleton graph===
There are 100 independent sets of size 15 in the Hoffman–Singleton graph. Create a new graph with 100 corresponding vertices, and connect vertices whose corresponding independent sets have exactly 0 or 8 elements in common.
The resulting Higman–Sims graph can be partitioned into two copies of the Hoffman–Singleton graph in 352 ways.

===From a cube===
Take a cube with vertices labeled 000, 001, 010, ..., 111. Take all 70 possible 4-sets of vertices, and retain only the ones whose XOR evaluates to 000; there are 14 such 4-sets, corresponding to the 6 faces + 6 diagonal-rectangles + 2 parity tetrahedra. This is a 3-(8,4,1) block design on 8 points, with 14 blocks of block size 4, each point appearing in 7 blocks, each pair of points appearing 3 times, each triplet of points occurring exactly once. Permute the original 8 vertices any of 8! = 40320 ways, and discard duplicates. There are then 30 different ways to relabel the vertices (i.e., 30 different designs that are all isomorphic to each other by permutation of the points). This is because there are 1344 automorphisms, and 40320/1344 = 30.

Create a vertex for each of the 30 designs, and for each row of every design (there are 70 such rows in total, each row being a 4-set of 8 and appearing in 6 designs). Connect each design to its 14 rows. Connect disjoint designs to each other (each design is disjoint with 8 others). Connect rows to each other if they have exactly one element in common (there are 4x4 = 16 such neighbors). The resulting graph is the Higman–Sims graph. Rows are connected to 16 other rows and to 6 designs == degree 22. Designs are connected to 14 rows and 8 disjoint designs == degree 22. Thus all 100 vertices have degree 22 each.

==Algebraic properties==
The automorphism group of the Higman–Sims graph is a group of order isomorphic to the semidirect product of the Higman–Sims group of order with the cyclic group of order 2. It has automorphisms that take any edge to any other edge, making the Higman–Sims graph an edge-transitive graph. The outer elements induce odd permutations on the graph. As mentioned above, there are 352 ways to partition the Higman–Sims graph into a pair of Hoffman–Singleton graphs; these partitions actually come in 2 orbits of size 176 each, and the outer elements of the Higman–Sims group swap these orbits.

The characteristic polynomial of the Higman–Sims graph is (&quot;x&quot; − 22)(&quot;x&quot; − 2)77(&quot;x&quot; + 8)22. Therefore, the Higman–Sims graph is an integral graph: its spectrum consists entirely of integers. It is also the only graph with this characteristic polynomial, making it a graph determined by its spectrum.

==Inside the Leech lattice==

The Higman–Sims graph naturally occurs inside the Leech lattice: if &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are three points in the Leech lattice such that the distances &quot;XY&quot;, &quot;XZ&quot; and &quot;YZ&quot; are formula_1 respectively, then there are exactly 100 Leech lattice points &quot;T&quot; such that all the distances &quot;XT&quot;, &quot;YT&quot; and &quot;ZT&quot; are equal to 2, and if we connect two such points &quot;T&quot; and &quot;T&quot;′ when the distance between them is formula_2, the resulting graph is isomorphic to the Higman–Sims graph. Furthermore, the set of all automorphisms of the Leech lattice (that is, Euclidean congruences fixing it) which fix each of &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; is the Higman–Sims group (if we allow exchanging &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;, the order 2 extension of all graph automorphisms is obtained). This shows that the Higman–Sims group occurs inside the Conway groups Co2 (with its order 2 extension) and Co3, and consequently also Co1.

<doc id="1110503" wikidata="Q1797273" url="?curid=1110503" title="Punkin chunkin">
<text>Punkin chunkin or pumpkin chucking is the sport of hurling a pumpkin by mechanical means for distance. The devices used include slingshots, catapults, centrifugals, trebuchets, and pneumatic (air) cannons.

Punkin chunkin competitions, formal and informal, exist throughout the United States in the autumn, particularly in early November as a means to dispose of surplus pumpkins from Halloween. World Championship Punkin Chunkin, held annually in November in Delaware by the World Championship Punkin Chunkin Association (WCPCA), was the first and largest annual competition. The event ran annually from 1985 to 2013; a myriad of legal and logistical problems caused multiple events to be cancelled after that, and subsequent championships have been more sporadic. A European Championship has been held in Bikschote, Belgium, each year since 2004.

The Guinness world record shot is held by a pneumatic cannon dubbed &quot;Big 10 Inch&quot;, at , on September 9, 2010, in Moab, Utah. The shot received certification from Guinness World Records in early February 2011. Big 10 Inch has also competed many times at the WCPC event in Delaware. The WCPCA World Record, which includes only shots made at the annual World Championship event, is currently held by The American Chunker air cannon, captained by Brian Labrie, at on November 1, 2013, in Bridgeville, Delaware. The difference in results between Delaware and Utah may be due to the higher, thinner, drier air found in Utah providing less resistance and drag, thus greater range.

The range achieved by devices depends on their mass, shape, and size; the yield limits, stiffness, pitch, and elevation of the hurler, and the weather. The choice of pumpkin is another important variable; Casper, Lumina, and La Estrella are the most common varieties used for competitions since they tend to have thicker rinds than other varieties and can thus withstand greater forces during launch. One of the core rules for competition is that the pumpkin must remain whole after leaving the device until hitting the ground for the chunk to count. Pumpkins that burst after leaving the barrel or sling are referred to as &quot;pie&quot; (short for &quot;pumpkin pie in the sky&quot;); such launches are disqualified under WCPC rules.

Punkin Chunkin events, usually independently organized, are held throughout the United States, with active annual contests in Lake County, California; Clayton, New York; Ellicottville, New York; Brasstown, North Carolina and Bald Eagle State Park in Centre County, Pennsylvania.

A variant of the competition, the pumpkin shoot, emphasizes accuracy over distance, as competitors aim to hit a specific target. A &quot;Great Pumpkin Shoot&quot; has been held in Olean, New York, most years since 2010.

== World Championship Punkin Chunkin ==

World Championship Punkin Chunkin (WCPC) was the name of an annual contest held the first full weekend after Halloween in Delaware from 1986 through 2013 and in 2016. It was also held in 2019 in Illinois and is scheduled to take place in 2023 in Oklahoma. It is governed by the World Championship Punkin Chunkin Association (WCPCA).

Teams competed in the following divisions: Air Cannon, Female Air Cannon, Centrifugal, Catapult, Torsion, Trebuchet, Human Powered, Centrifugal Human Powered, Youth Air Cannon, Youth Catapult, Youth Trebuchet, Youth Human Powered, Youth 10 &amp; Under, and Theatrical. Each division competed strictly for distance except for the Theatrical division which relies on a fan vote. The teams get three shots, one taken on each of three consecutive days. Only a team&#x27;s longest shot is scored for official results. Spotters riding on ATVs find the impact point, and then a professional surveyor calculates the distance based on GPS coordinates of the impact and the machine. The impact point is marked with color-coded spray paint.

The event also featured amusement rides, food vendors, fireworks, live concerts, a pumpkin cooking contest, a chili cook-off, the Miss Punkin Chunkin pageant, and other attractions.

The event originated in 1986, and early in its history convened in Lewes, Delaware. Due to increasing space requirements (distance of shots, number of teams, and number of spectators) new locations in Sussex County had to be found. In 2007, WCPC moved to Bridgeville (at ), near the intersection of Seashore Highway and Chaplains Chapel Road. About 75 teams competed, the event drew more than 20,000 people, and grossed more than $800,000 in ticket sales and associated revenues. More than 70% of that money would be donated to a variety of community organizations. Starting with the 2014 WCPCA event, festivities were to be held at Dover International Speedway in Dover, after the landowner who hosted the event evicted the event from his property due to a 2011 lawsuit (one that was eventually settled out of court). However, the 2014 event was canceled due to logistics problems (the speedway did not have long enough of a straightaway to cover the one-mile distance the competition requires), and the contest was expected to be permanently shuttered prior to the 2015 contest due to insurance companies refusing to cover the contest.

After considering a move to a location in Maryland, the organization announced plans to revive the World Championship Punkin Chunkin contest for 2016 at its previous site in Bridgeville after the insurance concerns were addressed.

No World Championship was held in 2017 because of another injury-related lawsuit; before the decision to cancel, the organizers had suggested that the 2017 championship would have been the last one due to the lawsuit and the related withdrawal of its television partner. 2018 came and went with the organization having gone silent, and no championship was held that year.

In May 2019, the World Championship announced its intent to relocate to Chanute Air Force Base in Rantoul, Illinois, and return for 2019. Organizers cited better state protections against liability in Illinois compared to Delaware, Illinois&#x27; status as the country&#x27;s most prolific pumpkin growing state, the fact that the former air force base is a brownfield that does not need to be cleared of crops (allowing the event to be held a few weeks earlier in the season), and lower costs for police and fire protection.

The 2019 World Championship was substantially downsized (in terms of number of competitors) due to the relocation, as many of the Delaware regulars were unwilling to trek across several states to partake. This allowed for a more intimate experience (spectators could visit the contestants in the pits before the competition began), but also led the organizers to believe the event would run at a financial loss for them.

For 2020, the organizers sought to return to the eastern United States but were unable to do so because of coronavirus restrictions; the event was to be held in 2020 in an altered format, but organizers again claimed they could not find a host &quot;in (a state) with favorable liability laws;&quot; they also declined to hold the event in 2021, citing &quot;many obstacles in our path in recent years - some well known and others, not so much(.)&quot; The organizers stated that though they loved Delaware, they were convinced that &quot;certain organizations within our state (...) will work to see that (the changes necessary to return the event to Delaware) never happen&quot; and that it was outright illegal to host the event in Maryland due to firearms laws in that state, limiting options for returning the contest to Delmarva as they had hoped.

There was no event in 2020, 2021, 2022 or 2024. In 2023, the World Championship Punkin Chunkin, in lieu of holding their own competition, licensed the brand to Punkin Chunkin International, who held a World Championship in a field east of Vinita, Oklahoma, on October 28 of that year.

=== Television coverage ===

The Science Channel carried the World Championship from 2009 to 2016. WCPCA and the Science Channel agreed to a new 3-year contract that ran through the 2016 WCPC. In 2009 and 2010 the &quot;Punkin Chunkin&quot; special aired on tape delay on Thanksgiving Day. Each year of coverage thus far has featured an hour long special titled &quot;Road to the Chunk&quot; that preceded coverage of the WCPC event. The previous year&#x27;s contest is shown around Halloween and sporadically throughout the year. &quot;Road to Punkin Chunkin 2011&quot; featured three 30-minute episodes airing weekly leading up to Thanksgiving.

The first televised Punkin Chunkin special was aired by the Discovery Channel in 2002, hosted by Bryan Callen. In 2008, after a six-year hiatus, Punkin Chunkin returned to cable television on the Science channel as a 1-hour program, hosted by Brad Sherwood. 2009 brought a two-episode broadcast covering the teams heading to the event, and then the event itself, each hosted by Zach Selwyn and Mike Senese. 2010 was hosted by Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage of the Discovery Channel program &quot;MythBusters&quot;. From 2011 to 2013, the special was hosted by &quot;MythBusters&quot; &quot;Build Team&quot; members Tory Belleci, Kari Byron, and Grant Imahara. Clip shows compiling footage of previous Punkin Chunkin events aired in 2014 and 2015.

During taping of the 2016 festivities, one of the event&#x27;s air cannons malfunctioned and chunks of flying metal struck a member of the TV production staff in the head seriously injuring her; after the injury, Science Channel opted to discontinue filming and not air Punkin Chunkin that year. The staffer is believed to have recovered from her injuries. The producer filed a lawsuit against the WCPCA, its officers and the landowner in 2017, prompting them to cancel the World Championship for 2017. The lawsuit was dismissed in early 2019.

The 2019 event was not televised on a traditional broadcast, cable or satellite outlet. The organizers streamed most of the festivities on Facebook Live. The 2023 event was also scheduled to stream on Facebook live but was disrupted when a rainstorm disrupted the Starlink Internet connection, with hopes of airing a pre-recorded package via Facebook by Thanksgiving.

<doc id="1110504" wikidata="Q4215877" url="?curid=1110504" title="Rail Clearways Program">
<text>The Rail Clearways Programme was conceived in 2004 with the aim of easing congestion of Sydney&#x27;s suburban railway network, by reducing the amount of infrastructure shared by multiple services. The disparate projects at pinch points throughout the network were designed to increase passenger capacity and improve reliability. All projects were delivered by the Transport Construction Authority until it was subsumed in November 2011 by Transport for New South Wales. A new timetable was introduced in October 2013 that realised the benefit of many of the projects, and by January 2014—the programme was complete.

==Conception==
In the mid-2000s, the Government of New South Wales suffered heavy criticism for its perceived mishandling of the Sydney rail network, which had very poor on-time performance following the January 2003 Waterfall train disaster. The safety regime introduced after this crash required drivers to stick to the speed limit, which often caused delays due to the expectations of the timetable for higher speeds. A slower timetable was introduced in September 2005, which significantly improving on-time running of services. The Clearways Programme was intended as the next step in improving the network.

==Clearways routes==
The Clearways Programme aimed to divide fourteen rail lines into five independent &quot;clearways&quot;, reducing the heavily interwoven nature of the Sydney system. This was intended to isolate incidents to one part of the network so other lines would still run as scheduled. The &quot;clearways&quot; feed the existing lines through the Sydney Central Business District.

As the Carlingford line did not run through the CBD, it was not included in a &quot;clearway&quot;. Track upgrades to the Carlingford Line were still included in the program, but this was cancelled in the November 2008 Mini-Budget. The Carlingford line north of Camellia was later converted to light rail and permanently closed south of Camellia.

The five clearways routes are:

===Clearway 1: Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra===
This route did not change from the pre-Clearways Eastern Suburbs &amp; Illawarra Line. The projects undertaken on this route have increased passenger capacity.

===Clearway 2: Bankstown===
After the Airport line opened in May 2000, most trains from the East Hills line used the new line to approach the city. This eased congestion on the older line between Sydenham and Erskineville, where tracks were shared with services from the Bankstown line. Under the programme, new dedicated tracks for the Bankstown line between Sydenham and Erskineville were to be constructed to the west of the existing four tracks to allow express East Hills line trains from Clearway 3 to again run via Sydenham. The Airport line would be served by all-stops East Hills Line trains from Clearway 4.

St Peters and Erskineville railway stations were expected to continue to be served by the Bankstown line. This would have required platforms—partially completed in the 1970s from the Eastern Suburbs line construction—to have been activated at these two stations. The works were cancelled in November 2008, and the plan for frequent operation of express East Hills line services via Sydenham was abandoned.

A second Bankstown line project involved the construction of a new turn-back platform at Lidcombe, separating the Bankstown line&#x27;s operations from trains on the Main Suburban line. This worked in concert with the Homebush turn-back project, which provided a terminating point for all stations Inner West Line services on the Main Suburban. This separation was enacted in the October 2013 timetable. The turn-back platform at Lidcombe was also marked in 2012 as a terminal for Sydney Metro Southwest, with original plans to convert the Bankstown line through to Lidcombe and Cabramatta into rapid transit. This plan has since been altered to have Bankstown as the terminus of the metro line.

===Clearway 3: Campbelltown Express and Clearway 4: Airport &amp; South===
The Campbelltown Express Clearway would have separated the section of the East Hills Line east of Revesby by quadruplicating between Kingsgrove and Revesby and sending express trains to the City Circle via Sydenham. This was to allow more frequent express services to the city, relieve pressure on other parts of the network and improve the distribution of passengers.

On the Airport &amp; South Clearway, express services would have begun at Glenfield and made their way through Liverpool, Cabramatta, Granville, Lidcombe and Strathfield stations to the City Circle, while all-stations services to the City started at Homebush. After passing through the City Circle, trains would have headed south-west via the Airport Line to Revesby (running parallel with the Campbelltown Express line from Wolli Creek to Revesby).

In the October 2013 timetable, these two clearways were merged to create the Airport, Inner West &amp; South Line. Differences from the original plan include via-Revesby and via-Granville trains sharing tracks between Glenfield and Macarthur, and all-stations and express trains via-Revesby sharing tracks between Revesby and Central. Most trains from Macarthur via Revesby use the local (pre-existing) tracks between Revesby and Wolli Creek, and make a number of stops along the route. These trains approach the City via the Airport. The route via-Sydenham and the express tracks between Wolli Creek and Revesby are only used by a limited number of peak-hour services as well as NSW Trains services to Goulburn, Canberra, Griffith and Melbourne.

In the November 2017 timetable, in addition to peak-hour trains from Macarthur via Sydenham utilising the express tracks between Wolli Creek and Revesby, most Macarthur via Airport services throughout the day now operate via the express tracks, resulting in the full separation of Macarthur express trains from Revesby all-stations trains which continue to use the local tracks. This has resulted in the removal of express trains for Padstow and Riverwood as the express tracks are unable to serve those stations where there are no platforms.

===Clearway 5: North West===
The North West Clearway provides an independent corridor for the North Shore &amp; Western Line and Northern Line to improve reliability and capacity. Trains from the west start from the Richmond, Penrith or Epping branches, meet up at Strathfield and travel through the city to Chatswood. Here trains used to split, either continuing up the North Shore Line to Berowra, or via the Chatswood to Epping Line to Hornsby, prior to its conversion to Sydney Metro Northwest in 2018.
==Projects==
Many infrastructure upgrades needed to be completed in order to implement the Clearways plan. These projects included upgrading stations, adding extra tracks, stabling facilities, or upgrading junctions.
The projects were:

==Non-clearways projects==
Other projects of the era which were not part of the Rail Clearways programme:
*Epping to Chatswood railway line – opened February 2009
*Southern Sydney Freight Line by the Australian Rail Track Corporation – gives freight services their own dedicated line through southern Sydney – opened January 2013
*South West Rail Link – includes an additional platform at Glenfield and a flyover at Glenfield North Junction – opened February 2015
*Northern Sydney Freight Corridor – a series of projects to increase capacity for freight services – completed June 2016

Resignalling:
*Sefton – completed January 2006
*Oatley – Cronulla – completed April 2010
*North Sydney – St Leonards

Cancelled projects included:
*Redfern to Chatswood line – announced in 2005, cancelled in 2008
*CBD Relief Line – announced in 2010, cancelled in 2011

<text>Daniel Lamont &quot;Bubba&quot; Franks (born January 6, 1978) is an American former professional football player who was a tight end for nine seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Miami Hurricanes, earning first-team All-American honors in 1999. He was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the first round of the 2000 NFL draft with the 14th overall pick.

==Early life==
Bubba attended Big Spring High School in Big Spring, Texas and was an all state tight end there.

==College career==
Franks played collegiate football at the University of Miami, where he was known for his extraordinary one-handed receptions. He redshirted in 1996, but was very productive in the 1997, 1998, and 1999 seasons, setting the University of Miami record for most touchdowns by a tight end, with 12. He was also named to the All-Big East team twice and was named as an All-American in 1999.

Franks waived his final year of eligibility to enter the 2000 NFL draft and was selected in the first round, with the 14th overall selection, by the Green Bay Packers.

===Awards and honors===
* Second-team All-Big East (1997)
* &quot;Sporting News&quot; Freshman All-American (1997)
* First-team All-Big East (1998–1999)
* First-team All-American (1999)

==Professional career==

===Green Bay Packers===
After a promising but unspectacular rookie season, he reached the Pro Bowl his second NFL year, during which he caught nine touchdown passes in the 2001 season. Franks went to three Pro Bowls altogether (2001, 2002, and 2003). He missed much of the 2005 season with knee and neck injuries.

On February 20, 2008, Franks was released by the Packers after an unproductive and injury-plagued 2007 season in which he was demoted to second string tight end behind Donald Lee.

===New York Jets===
On March 16, 2008, Franks agreed to terms with the New York Jets on a one-year deal. Franks was released on July 13, 2009.

<doc id="1110508" wikidata="Q111944705" url="?curid=1110508" title="Corroboree frog">
<text>Corroboree frogs ( ) comprise two species of frog native to the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales in Australia. Both species are small, poisonous ground-dwelling frogs. The two species are the southern corroboree frog (&quot;Pseudophryne corroboree&quot;) and the northern corroboree frog (&quot;Pseudophryne pengilleyi&quot;). They are unique among frogs in that they produce their own poison rather than obtain it from their food source as is the case in every other poisonous frog species.

==Description==
The northern form of the corroboree frog deviates slightly in having narrow yellow to greenish stripes and is slightly smaller.

==Distribution==
The corroboree frogs have historically only been found in a few patches across two regions of the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and southern New South Wales (NSW), and these areas have contracted significantly in recent years.

Southern corroboree frogs live at altitudes of above sea level, historically in an area now within Kosciuszko National Park in the Snowy Mountains of NSW, from Smiggin Holes in the south, and northwards to the Maragle Range.

Northern corroboree frogs live above sea level, in three distinct regions, with the frogs displaying three distinct genetic characteristics. These populations live in the following areas: spanning the Fiery Range and Bogong Peaks in Kosciuszko National Park, the Bondo, Micalong and Wee Jasper State Forests in NSW; along the Brindabella Ranges in Namadgi National Park in the ACT; and Bimberi Nature Reserve and Brindabella National Park in NSW.

==Biology==

===Reproduction===

The southern corroboree frog (&quot;Pseudophryne corroboree&quot;)
is critically endangered (CR)
. Sexual maturity of &quot;P. corroboree&quot; is reached at four years of age, with one year as an embryo/tadpole and two years as a juvenile/subadult. Adults primarily have only one breeding season. Breeding occurs around December terrestrially near shallow pools, fens, seepages, wet grassland or wet heaths, where the males build chamber nests within the grasses and moss. Males compete for females via song. Each male will attract up to ten females to his burrow sequentially and may dig a new burrow if his first is filled with eggs. The female lays up to 38 eggs and the male grasps her and deposits sperm directly onto the eggs. Tadpoles develop but remain within the protective egg coat until hatching occurs when high ground-water levels after rain cause the nest to become flooded at 4 to 6 months. Tadpole development takes six to eight months. Metamorphosis occurs between December and February.

Northern corroboree frog (&quot;Pseudophryne pengilleyi&quot;)
Endangered (EN)
&quot;P. pengilleyi&quot; prefers to breed in sphagnum bogs and wet heath in sub-alpine areas and dense patches of herbs in openings or seepages amongst fallen tussocks at lower elevation (bog pools at high altitudes above and in shallow seepage pools in gullies at lower altitudes of ). Other reproductive details are as for &quot;P. corroboree&quot;. Both species are restricted to mountain and sub-alpine woodlands, heathlands and grasslands.

Non-breeding habitat for both species occurs in forest, woodland and heath adjacent to breeding sites.

===Diet===
The typical diet of a mature southern corroboree frog includes beetles, mites, ants and insect larvae. However, as tadpoles they also tend to eat algae and other small pieces of organic material found in their pools.

===Toxicity===
Corroboree frogs are the first vertebrates discovered that are able to produce their own poisonous alkaloid, as opposed to obtaining it via diet as many other frogs do. The alkaloid is secreted from the skin as a defence against predation, and potentially against skin infections by microbes. It has been described as potentially lethal to mammals if ingested. The unique alkaloid produced has been named pseudo-phrynamine.

==Behaviour==
Corroboree frogs are quite unusual in their nature. Not only do they not start breeding until four years of age, they also hibernate during winter under whatever shelter they can find. This may be snow gum trees, or bits of bark or fallen leaves. Males stay with the egg nests and may breed with many females over the course of one season.

==Conservation status==
The southern corroboree frog was considered relatively numerous within its very small distribution in the 1970s, as of June 2004 it had an estimated adult population of 64, but suffered declines of up to 80% over the 10 years up to 1989, at which time it was found only within a fragmented region of less than within Kosciuszko National Park. It has been listed as critically endangered since at least 2004 and is considered to be one of Australia&#x27;s most endangered species. There are fewer than 30 individuals left in the wild .

The northern corroboree frog has not suffered as badly as the southern. It is more widely distributed across about of the Brindabella and Fiery Ranges in Namadgi National Park in the ACT, and Kosciuszko National Park and Buccleuch State Forest in NSW. In 2004 it was downgraded from an IUCN assessment of critically endangered to endangered, though in 2022 this decision was reverted .

===Cause for decline===
The main threats to the survival of the frogs are thought to be infection with the chytrid fungus and bushfires.

Severe bushfires in the Victorian and NSW high country in January 2003 destroyed much of the frogs&#x27; remaining habitat, especially the breeding sites and the leaf litter that insulates overwintering adults. The fire affected almost all southern corroboree frog habitat, although later surveys showed that the fire resulted in a lower than expected decline in population.

The 2019–2020 bushfires in Australia destroyed a significant portion of Kosciusko National Park, and killed two-thirds of the southern corroboree frogs contained in specially designed disease-free enclosures built by conservationists.

Other threats to the southern species include residential and commercial development (including ski resorts); climate change (causing drought and fires); and pollution.

Other causes such as habitat destruction from recreational 4WD use; feral animals; degradation of the frogs&#x27; habitat; and increased UV radiation flowing from ozone layer depletion. The drought affects these frogs by drying out their breeding sites so that the breeding cycle, which is triggered by seasonal changes and may require moistening of the bogs in autumn and spring to bring on specific developmental events, is delayed. This may mean that tadpoles have not metamorphosed by late summer when their bogs dry out, and so perish.

===Conservation efforts===
The Amphibian Research Centre had already begun a rescue programme under which eggs were collected and raised to late tadpole stage before return as close as possible to their collection site. Research is now under way into captive breeding and on which life cycle stage – eggs, tadpoles or adults – promises the best chance of survival following return to the wild. The national parks authorities in the ACT, NSW and Victoria have developed conservation programmes, including a captive husbandry programme at Tidbinbilla, ACT; Taronga Zoo in Sydney; and at Healesville Sanctuary, by Zoos Victoria.

Conservationists have stepped up efforts to increase the population of the southern corroboree frog since the 2019–20 bushfires. In March 2022, 100 frogs were released into the park as part of a joint breeding program between Taronga Zoo, Zoos Victoria, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service and the NSW Government&#x27;s &quot;Saving our Species&quot; program. At this time there are five enclosures for the frogs, with the newest one built to better withstand the effect of fire.

<text>Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil (; ) is a former commune in the Dordogne department in Nouvelle-Aquitaine in southwestern France. It was created in 1973 by the merger of two former communes: Les Eyzies-de-Tayac and Sireuil. On 1 January 2019, it was merged into the new commune Les Eyzies.

Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil lies in the Périgord Noir area. It is served by the Gare des Eyzies railway station. This locale is home to the (National Museum of Prehistory) and the area contains several important archaeological sites, including the Font-de-Gaume, and Lascaux cave prehistoric rock dwellings. The many prehistoric sites and cave paintings in the area were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List as &quot;Prehistoric Sites and Decorated Caves of the Vézère Valley&quot; in 1979.

==Geography==
===Location===

The commune is located at the confluence of the Vézère and the Beune rivers. It is accessible by the SNCF network at the Gare des Eyzies, by the A89 motorway, exit 16 Périgueux-East (Bordeaux – Périgueux axis) and then by the D710 road or by Montignac via Terrasson (Lyon - Terrasson-Lavilledieu axis). In the north-west, the commune is also watered by another small tributary of the Vézère, the Manaurie.

===Climate===
In the Dordogne department, the highest temperature was recorded on 4 and 5 August 2003 at Les Eyzies-de-Tayac-Sireuil, with 43°C.
===Neighbouring communes and villages===
===Population===

==Toponymy==
In Occitan, the commune bears the name Las Aisiás de Taiac e Siruèlh.

==History==
In March 1868, the geologist Louis Lartet, financed by Henry Christy, discovered the first five skeletons of Cro-Magnons, the earliest known examples of &quot;Homo sapiens sapiens&quot;, in the Cro-Magnon rock shelter at Les Eyzies-de-Tayac. These skeletons included a foetus, and the skulls found were remarkably modern-looking and much rounder than the earlier Neanderthal.

==Economy==
As at 31 December 2013, the municipality has 209 establishments, including 151 in the field of commerce, transport or services, twenty relating to the administrative sector, education, health or social action, eighteen in construction, thirteen in the industry, and seven in agriculture, forestry or fishing.

==Places and monuments==

* &quot;L&#x27;Homme primitif&quot; is a statue by Paul Dardé, inaugurated in 1931 and placed on a natural platform that dominates the village of Les Eyzies; It can be approached during the visit of the National Museum of Prehistory.
===Natural Sites===
* Grotte du Grand Roc, cave with natural eccentric crystallisations comparable to corals.
===Prehistoric sites===
The municipality has many prehistoric archaeological sites including:
* The Grotte de Font-de-Gaume, the last cave with prehistoric polychrome paintings still open to visit in the region
* Les Combarelles - 600 pre-historic engravings of animals and symbols
* Grotte de la Mouthe - ornate cave of the Upper Paleolithic period
* La Grotte de Bernifal
* The deposit of &quot;La Micoque&quot; - discovery of numerous testimonies of the lithic industries of the Paleolithic (Tayacian, Micoquien and Mousterian)
* Abri Chadourne, named after its owner
* L&#x27;abri Audi|
* L&#x27;abri de Cro-Magnon, the eponymous site of the Cro-Magnon man.
* L&#x27;abri Pataud, a site studied under the responsibility of the National Museum of Natural History. The stratigraphic sequences comprises Upper Paleolithic levels, in particular, from bottom to top, Aurignacian, Gravettian, and Protomagdalénien
* Laugerie-Basse and Laugerie-Haute - paleolithic sites
* L&#x27;abri du Poisson - carved in low relief at the ceiling of the vault, raised in red colour a salmon
* Le vallon de Gorge d&#x27;enfer - ( private site ) - home to the grand abri and the vallée éternelle scientific research foundation.
* Les grottes du Roc de Cazelle constitute a troglodytic site occupied from prehistoric times until 1960.

Many of these sites have been classified as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO as Prehistoric Sites and Decorated Caves of the Vézère Valley. The discovery of these shelters within a restricted radius around Les Eyzies, their methodical exploration and the study of the deposits they concealed allowed prehistory to build up as a science and explains why the city claims the status of world capital of the prehistory, as the publicity leaflets recall.

===Museum===
The National Museum of Prehistory, where many prehistoric discoveries are preserved, is located in the heart of the village. Very rich in carved flints, it is especially aimed at specialists.

===Historical Sites===
* Château de Commarque, 12th century, 14th century, 15th century, classified.
* Château de Tayac and its dependencies, 12th century 14th century 15th century.

<doc id="1110527" wikidata="Q2126070" url="?curid=1110527" title="Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons">
<text>Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons is the 1999 soundtrack album from &quot;The Simpsons&quot;. It takes many of the musical numbers from the series which were either not included in the previous album, &quot;Songs in the Key of Springfield&quot;, or were created since the previous album&#x27;s release. The album has 53 tracks, most of which were written by Alf Clausen. It was well received by critics, being named the Best Compilation Album of 1999 by Soundtrack.net, and charted at number 197 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Hollywood Records released the album on digital and streaming platforms on December 9, 2021.

==Background and release==
&quot;Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons&quot; is a soundtrack album that features songs that have appeared on the American animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, as well as some songs that never made the final cut. It is a sequel to the album &quot;Songs in the Key of Springfield&quot;, and the second album to feature songs from the show. The third and latest soundtrack album, &quot;The Simpsons: Testify&quot;, was released eight years after &quot;Go Simpsonic&quot; in 2007.

Most songs on the album were written by Alf Clausen, who is the composer on &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and co-writes, arranges, produces, and conducts almost all music that is featured in the show. Although the album also features covers of songs written by others. For example, a cover of &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; sung by the character Bleeding Gums Murphy, and a cover of Terry Cashman&#x27;s &quot;Talkin&#x27; Baseball&quot; called &quot;Talkin&#x27; Softball&quot;, that Cashman himself sung on the show, are included. The main theme song of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, written by Danny Elfman, is also featured.

The album was released on the Rhino Records label on November 2, 1999, during the eleventh season of the show. It peaked at number 197 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, number two on Top Kid Audio and number 14 on Top Internet Albums. The album remained on the Top Kid Audio chart for 17 weeks.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Go Simpsonic with The Simpsons&quot; received positive reviews from most music critics upon its release. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a five out of five rating, writing that &quot;it serves as a reminder of the sheer brilliance of the music within this peerless show. Much of that musical brilliance is due to Alf Clausen [...] Hearing all of this music, ranging from the first to the ninth season, in one place confirms how Clausen and his collaborators can master everything from show tunes to commercial jingles. What&#x27;s really impressive is that the music is every bit as funny, sometimes more so, than the lyrics — and that&#x27;s no easy trick to pull off.&quot;

Soundtrack.net named &quot;Go Simpsonic&quot; the Best Compilation Album of 1999. The creator of that website, David A. Koran, said the album features some of his all-time favorites from the show, including the song &quot;Canyonero&quot;. He also wrote that &quot;one of Alf Clausen&#x27;s other great talents besides working well along great lyricists is his ability to parody without sounding like an exact knock-off. In &#x27;The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase&#x27; medley, the &#x27;Chief Wiggum, P.I&#x27; cue was great invention in the style of Jan Hammer&#x27;s original orchestrations for &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.&quot; Koran also praised the &quot;Scorpio&quot; and &quot;McBain&quot; songs for their similarities with John Barry&#x27;s James Bond tunes. Similarly, Elysa Gardner of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; commended the parodic nature of many songs on the album. She wrote that &quot;this showcases the brilliant work of series composer Alf Clausen and his delightful knack of spoofing various musical forms. Included are sendups of musicals, movies (&quot;Mary Poppins&quot; and Bond themes) and commercials, each lovingly and lethally delivered. There are 53 cuts in all, and most of them, like the show itself, stand up to repeated listenings. A treasure.&quot;

Alan Sepinwall of &quot;The Star-Ledger&quot; was more critical, writing that &quot;Unfortunately, &quot;Songs in the Key&quot; [...] used up most of the show&#x27;s best musical inventory, leaving only assorted scraps for &quot;Go Simpsonic&quot;. There are some wonderful tunes, including the &#x27;Mary Poppins&#x27;-ish &#x27;Cut Every Corner,&#x27; Bart and Sideshow Bob performing the score to &#x27;HMS Pinafore,&#x27; the SUV parody commercial &#x27;Canyonero,&#x27; and Homer and Marge&#x27;s take on the &quot;All in the Family&quot; theme [...], but too much of it is filler.&quot;

He was elected to Parliament as a candidate of the Liberal Party of Canada in the 1993 election, and was re-elected in the 1997, 2000, and 2004 elections. From 2000 to 2003, he was Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for International Trade.

Before leaving the party, O&#x27;Brien was often considered as representing the right-wing of the Liberal party. He was one of the fiercest opponents of same-sex marriage in the Liberal caucus, along with Tom Wappel. He has frequently chastised Prime Minister Paul Martin for not allowing a free vote among his Cabinet on Bill C-38, which is the act to legalize same-sex marriage in Canada. He has repeatedly called for the notwithstanding clause to be used to override the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which courts have repeatedly ruled requires the government to recognize same-sex marriages. He is also strongly against abortion.

On June 6, 2005, O&#x27;Brien left the Liberal Party to sit as an independent, citing his opposition to same-sex marriage, and his discomfort with the revelations coming out of the Gomery Commission on the sponsorship scandal.

On June 14, O&#x27;Brien issued an ultimatum to the government, indicating that he and an anonymous Liberal MP would vote against the government in a series of confidence votes that evening unless the same-sex marriage bill is delayed until the fall session of Parliament. However, the Liberals went on to survive the confidence votes and eventually got the same-sex marriage bill passed in the summer session of parliament.

In the fall of 2005, O&#x27;Brien announced that he and a former Conservative MP were founding an advocacy group to try to reverse the legalization of same-sex marriage.

O&#x27;Brien has stated that up to 90% of his constituents were opposed to same-sex marriage, and in the 2004 election, he defeated New Democrat candidate Irene Mathyssen by over 3,000 votes, a supporter of same sex marriage. In the 2006 election, although he did not run, he endorsed a Conservative who opposed same-sex marriage; but this time, Mathyssen won the riding.

Since leaving Parliament, he has remained active in conservative Canadian politics, appearing at the REAL Women of Canada convention in 2010.

<text>The Communist League is a New Zealand communist party.

==History==
The party was founded in 1969 by students from Victoria University of Wellington, and was originally named the Socialist Action League. The new party rejected the more established groups such as the Communist Party as too authoritarian, conservative, and unimaginative, but at the same time, rejected many of the newer communist groups in New Zealand as disorganised and unfocused. It was aligned with the Fourth International (FI), an international grouping of Trotskyist parties. The party achieved a certain amount of public recognition for its role in protests against the Vietnam War, and regularly engaged in protests against adventurist United States foreign policy, South African apartheid, in defence of the pro-choice side of the abortion debate, as well as supporting LGBT rights in New Zealand, during the 1970s and 1980s. During those decades, the SAL maintained a newspaper of its own, &quot;Socialist Action&quot;. According to the National Library of New Zealand serials catalogue, it ran from 1969 to 1988.

In the 1980s, the Socialist Workers Party in the United States broke away from Trotskyism, and left the FI. A number of other parties in FI also chose to leave, including the Socialist Action League in New Zealand. Those members of the Socialist Action League who did not agree with this departure from Trotskyism and the FI were expelled or resigned. Later, the Socialist Action League renamed itself the Communist League, following the pattern of the other pro-SWP parties that had left the FI. Today, the party is still associated with the Socialist Workers Party&#x27;s so-called Pathfinder tendency.

The League has held public meetings called Militant Labour Forums. The &quot;Militant newspaper&quot; and books published by Pathfinder Press have been distributed from the Pathfinder Bookshop in the Auckland suburb of Onehunga.

=== Candidacy for parliament ===
In every general election between 1990 and 2020, at least two candidates have sought election to parliament under the Communist League name. None have been successful, with each candidate only receiving a few dozen votes each time. Candidates have also stood at multiple city council elections and at least one by-election, also without success. The Communist League did not run any candidates in the 2023 general election.

==Electoral results (1990–2020)==

==Auckland mayor (1990–2019)==

The Communist League did not contest the 2022 Auckland mayoral election.

<doc id="1110537" wikidata="Q379181" url="?curid=1110537" title="Shingo Suetsugu">
<text>is a Japanese sprinter. He is a former Asian record holder in the 200 metres and 4×100 metres relay.

== Running career ==
Suetsugu won a bronze medal in the 200 metres event at the 2003 IAAF World Championships in a time of 20.38 seconds. The same year he set an Asian record of 20.03 seconds at the Japanese national championships, and also won the 100 metres in 10.13 seconds. Participating in the 2004 Summer Olympics, he reached the second round in the 100 metres.

=== Olympics ===
Suetsugu represented Japan at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He competed at the 4×100 metres relay together with Naoki Tsukahara, Shinji Takahira and Nobuharu Asahara. In their qualification heat they placed second behind Trinidad and Tobago, but in front of the Netherlands and Brazil. Their time of 38.52 was the third fastest out of sixteen participating nations in the first round, and they qualified for the final. There they sprinted to a time of 38.15 seconds, the third fastest after the Jamaican and Trinidad teams, winning the bronze medal. The medal was upgraded to a silver after the Jamaicans were DQ&#x27;ed due to Nesta Carter&#x27;s positive doping sample. Suetsugu also took part in the 200 metres individual race, finishing sixth in his first round heat, with a time of 20.93 seconds, which was not enough to qualify for the second round.

<doc id="1110541" wikidata="Q5257587" url="?curid=1110541" title="Denis Wood">
<text>Denis Wood is an artist, author, cartographer and a former professor of Design at North Carolina State University. Born in 1945, Wood grew up in Cleveland, Ohio, receiving a BA in English (in 1967) from then Western Reserve University (now Case Western Reserve University). He received an MA (in 1971) and a PhD (in 1973) in geography from Clark University, in Worcester, Massachusetts. Wood taught environmental psychology, landscape history, and design in then School of Design (now College of Design) at North Carolina State University from 1974 through 1996, living and raising his family in Boylan Heights. Beginning in 1996, Wood spent over two years in prison on a conviction for molesting a teenage boy.

==Academic career==

His book &quot;The Power of Maps&quot; (1992) was considered radical when it was published. &quot;The Power of Maps&quot; has been a linchpin of the “new cartographies” in which maps are redefined as socially constructed arguments based upon consistent semiotic codes.

Wood&#x27;s consistent critique “of the ideals of modern academic cartographers and of modern cartographic ideology” has been wide-ranging, informed, and decisive. In 2004, John Pickles, Early N. Phillips Distinguished professor at the University of North Carolina summed up Wood&#x27;s contributions this way: “For over twenty-five years, Denis Wood has been provoking us to think differently and critically about maps and map use.” The book was first issued in 1992 as a catalogue accompanying a major exhibition called &quot;The Power of Maps&quot; at the Cooper-Hewitt National Museum of Design in New York. That show was later remounted at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington in 1994. These exhibitions were the graphic genesis of the 1992 book which has been the subject of both scholarly commentary and popular interest.

As opposed to those who insist maps “represent” reality the critical cartographers, led by Wood, have insisted maps represent nothing. Instead, they present an argument about the world through the careful choice of content arranged graphically at a specific scale. This thesis, and the mechanisms of its activation, is at the heart of Wood and John Fels 2008 University of Chicago Press publication, &quot;The Natures of Maps&quot;. As one reviewer put it: “In 1986 Wood and Fels took apart the map; describing ten codes through which its signs create meaning. Their argument was subsequently enfolded into Wood’s &quot;The Power of Maps&quot; …Twenty-one years later, Wood and Fels have put the map back together again ‘by replacing the whole idea of the map as a representation with that of the map as a system of propositions.’” “The map is not a picture,” Wood and Fels insist in this new book, “It is an argument … everything about a map, from top to bottom, is an argument.”

This idea of the map as an argument presented rather than a reality represented extends a more general thesis on the manner in which we “construct” the world through a range of socially-conditioned perspectives, and do so at various scales. A relevant but quite distinct title in this area of work is Wood&#x27;s 2004 volume, &quot;Five Billion Years of Global Change: A History of the Land&quot;.

==Cartographic art==
More recently, Wood has joined his expertise in cartography with his interest in art and art history. A collage artist and painter, he has created in recent years a bibliography and history of cartographic art; work that from the Dadaist to the present have used maps as a medium for the exposition of cultural and political ideas and ideals. Again, the general thesis is the same as in Wood&#x27;s other work: images—whether map, art, or artful maps—present a thesis through selection of subject matter self-consciously arranged through a medium&#x27;s tools of exposition.

==Conviction==
In April 1996, Wood pleaded guilty to &quot;crimes against nature&quot; (viz. fellatio) and &quot;taking indecent liberties with a minor&quot;, on more than one-hundred and thirty occasions.
From 1996 to 1998, he spent 26 months in the North Carolina penal system as a result of his conviction. He is not on any national or regional register of sex offenders and has spoken publicly about his incarceration and the charges that led to it.

The urbanist writer and activist Jane Jacobs has wondered in press whether Wood&#x27;s arrest and incarceration may be one reason why some of his work receives less attention than it deserves. Despite the conviction, his writing and work continued and since his release he has continued to live in Raleigh, NC, while lecturing and working internationally in his field. For example, in 2008 he presented a plenary at the Royal Geographical Society in London.

In a 1998 interview with the &quot;News and Observer&quot;, Wood announced plans for a book based on his prison experience. It was described as planned for publication by the Johns Hopkins University Press. The book is currently scheduled for publication by The Center for American Places, distributed by University of Chicago Press. Wood offered a presentation with the same title at the 2003 annual meeting of the American Public Health Association.

==Publications==
Wood has published several scholarly articles and books. His books include:
*&quot;The Power of Maps&quot; with John Fels - 1992
*&quot;Home Rules&quot; with Robert J. Beck - 1994, Johns Hopkins University Press,

<doc id="1110544" wikidata="Q161391" url="?curid=1110544" title="Georgian uprising on Texel">
<text>The Georgian uprising on Texel () (5 April 1945 – 20 May 1945) was an insurrection by the 882nd Infantry Battalion &quot;Königin Tamara&quot; (Queen Tamar or &quot;Tamara&quot;) of the Georgian Legion of the German Army stationed on the German-occupied Dutch island of Texel (pronounced &quot;Tessel&quot; in Dutch, and &quot;Texel&quot; in English, Frisian, and German). The battalion was made up of 800 Georgians and 400 Germans, with mainly German officers. It was one of the last battles in the European theater.

==Background==
The heavily fortified island was part of the German Atlantic Wall system of defense. However, after the Allied landings in Normandy it was relegated to relative insignificance. The men of the rebellious battalion were former Red Army soldiers from the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic captured on the Eastern front. They had been given a choice: the captured soldiers could choose either to remain in the prisoner of war camps, which would have meant abuse, starvation, and very possibly death, or to serve in the German military and be allowed a degree of freedom. The battalion was formed of men who chose the latter option. Anti-communist émigrés living in Western Europe also joined these units, such as the Georgian Legion.

The battalion had been formed at Kruszyna near Radom in occupied Poland in June 1943 and was used initially to fight partisans. On 24 August 1943 it was ordered to the West to relieve troops of the Indische Freiwilligen-Legion Regiment 950. The battalion arrived at Zandvoort in the Netherlands on 30 August. From September 1943 to early February 1945 it was stationed at Zandvoort as part of the &quot;Unterabschnitt Zandvoort&quot;. On 6 February 1945, the battalion was posted to Subsection Texel. Preparations then started in late March 1945 for the transfer of several companies of the Georgian battalion to the Dutch mainland to oppose Allied advances, triggering the rebellion.

==Uprising==
Shortly after midnight on the night of 5–6 April 1945, the Georgians rose up and gained control of nearly the entire island. Approximately two hundred German soldiers were killed in the initial uprising, in their quarters or while standing guard, walking the roads of the island in groups or individually that night and the following day. Members of the Dutch resistance participated and assisted the Georgians. However, the rebellion hinged on an expected Allied landing which did not occur. Furthermore, the Georgians failed to secure the naval batteries on the southern and northern coasts of the island; the crews of these artillery installations were the only Germans still alive on the island.

A counterattack was ordered and the intact artillery batteries on the island began firing at sites where rebels were suspected to be. Approximately 2,000 riflemen of the 163rd &quot;Marine-Schützenregiment&quot; were deployed from the Dutch mainland. Over the next five weeks they re-took the island; fighting was particularly heavy in the northern part of the island at Eierland and around the lighthouse. The German troops then combed the length of the island for any remaining Georgian soldiers, while the Dutch inhabitants sought to hide them. The German commander of the 882nd battalion, Major Klaus Breitner, stated long after the war that the uprising was &quot;treachery, nothing else&quot;; the captured mutineers were ordered to dig their own graves, remove their German uniforms, and be executed.

During the rebellion, 565 Georgians, at least 812 Germans, and 120 residents of Texel were killed. The destruction was enormous; dozens of farms went up in flames, with damage later estimated at ten million guilders (US$3.77 million). The bloodshed lasted beyond the German capitulation in the Netherlands and Denmark on 5 May 1945 and even beyond Germany&#x27;s general surrender on 8 May 1945. The fighting continued until Canadian troops arrived 20 May 1945 to enforce the German surrender, and disarmed the remaining German troops.

==Aftermath==
The Georgians lie buried in a ceremonial cemetery at the Hogeberg near Oudeschild. The survivors may have feared facing the same fate as most Soviet collaborators: forced repatriation, under the terms of the Yalta Conference, often followed by incarceration and banishment and, for officers, execution. According to one account, 236 Georgian survivors were protected &quot;from Stalinist reprisals.&quot; by the testimonies of their heroism submitted by the Allies. According to another one, the 228 Georgians who survived by hiding from the German troops in coastal minefields, or who were concealed by Texel farmers, were turned over to Soviet authorities. After arrival at a collection camp in the Soviet Union, 26 Georgians were singled out and banished together with their families and others were sent to Gulag. Those still alive in the mid-1950s were rehabilitated and allowed to return home. Until 1991, the ambassador of the Soviet Union to the Netherlands visited the graves of the Georgians on 4 May every year, and, at least during the latter visits, called the Georgians &quot;Heroes of the Soviet Union&quot;. The Soviet Union donated a number of memorials to the war dead on Texel, including a pillar in the island&#x27;s main cemetery as well as various sculptures in the Georgian cemetery.

Over time, the number of local participants in the memorial events declined as the Dutch Communist Party, which had played a key role in keeping the memory of the Georgian rebellion alive, dwindled in size and eventually disappeared.

In the late 1960s, the Soviet memorialization of the Texel rebels culminated in the release of a feature film known as &quot;Crucified Island&quot;. It depicted the rebels as being prisoners of war who somehow managed to steal weapons from the Germans.

On 4 May 2005, Mikheil Saakashvili visited the graves for the first time as the president of independent Georgia. His visit was officially described as a private one, and he was accompanied by his Dutch-born wife.

The German dead were initially buried in a part of the general cemetery in Den Burg. In 1949 they found their final resting place at Ysselsteyn German war cemetery, Limburg province, the Netherlands. The cemetery is administered by the German War Graves Commission. Den Burg General Cemetery also contains a plot of 167 World War II Commonwealth burials, most of them airmen; 44 of the burials are unidentified.

A permanent exhibition dedicated to these events can be found &quot;in a corner&quot; of the Aeronautical Museum at Texel International Airport.

One of the last Georgian survivors of the uprising died in July 2007 and was buried with military honors in Zugdidi, Georgia. There were two Georgian survivors still alive in 2010: Grisha Baindurashvili, who was then 88 years old and lived in Kaspi, a village 40 km west of Tbilisi, and Eugeny Artemidze, who had been one of the main organizers of the rebellion; he died at age 90 on June 22, 2010, on the same day he had gone to war 69 years earlier. Baindurashvili was still alive in 2015, when an interview with him was published. On August 6, 2021, Baindurashvili died at age 102 in his resident village Kaspi (as published in the &quot;Reformatorisch Dagblad&quot; of Texel, August 13, 2021).

==Number of casualties==
Canadian troops led by Lieutenant Colonel Kirk landed unopposed on Texel on 17 May 1945, effectively liberating the island. Over a two-day period the Canadians disarmed 1,535 Germans. Soviet SMERSH forces arrived on Texel and took charge of 228 Georgians still alive. A Canadian report prepared for the commander of the SMERSH contingent recorded 470 Georgian and 2,347 German casualties on Texel.

In 1949, the German War Graves Commission disinterred 812 bodies (including the 400+ killed in their sleep by the Georgians in their shared quarters) on Texel for reburial at Ysselsteyn German war cemetery. The numbers given by the Texel district list &quot;565 Georgians, 120 Texel islanders and approximately 800 Germans killed&quot;; followed by &quot;other sources… speak of more than 2,000 Germans killed.&quot; The &quot;other sources&quot; comment in all probability refers to the Canadian report to SMERSH that lumped together under &quot;casualties&quot; the 1,535 disarmed Germans with their 812 dead.

<text>The intensification of the class struggle along with the development of socialism is a component of the theory of Stalinism.

==Description==

The theory was one of the cornerstones of Stalinism in the internal politics of the Soviet Union. Although the term class struggle was introduced by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels and the aggravation of the class struggle was an expression originally used by Vladimir Lenin in 1919 to refer to the dictatorship of the proletariat, the theory itself was put forward by Joseph Stalin in 1929 and supplied a theoretical base for the claim that ongoing repression of capitalist elements is necessary. Stalin believed that residual bourgeois elements would persist within the country and that with support from Western powers they would try to infiltrate the party.

A variation of the theory was also adopted by Mao Zedong in China as the Continuous Revolution theory.

== Origin ==
Vladimir Lenin believed that the Russian Civil War represented the peak of class struggle that had been resolved in 1920s through the establishing the workers&#x27; state in Russia where the bourgeois class was effectively rooted out. Contrary to such position, Joseph Stalin proposed that the further the country moved forward in constructing socialism, the more acute the forms of struggle that would be used by the doomed remnants of exploiter classes in their last desperate efforts. Therefore political repression was necessary to prevent them from succeeding in their presumed goal of destroying the Soviet Union.
Stalin put forth this theory in 1929 in the special section of his speech &quot;The Right Deviation in the C.P.S.U.(B.)&quot; at the plenum of the Central Committee and Central Control Commission, C.P.S.U.(B.) held 16–23 April 1929, which concluded:
The dying classes are resisting, not because they have become stronger than we are, but because socialism is growing faster than they are, and they are becoming weaker than we are. And precisely because they are becoming weaker, they feel that their last days are approaching and are compelled to resist with all the forces and all the means in their power.

Such is the mechanics of the intensification of the class struggle and of the resistance of the capitalists at the present moment of history.

Stalin believed that the class enemy could even worm its way into the Bolshevik Party claiming to lead a socialist state. He evaluated his associates of the day based on whether they acted on that belief or the belief that a party could have no enemies inside it. Tolerance inside the party to those who disagreed with the official party line was called &quot;rotten liberalism&quot; by Stalin. He believed such tolerance would make the party weak and eventually lead to its destruction. As a result, he argued that purges were sometimes necessary.

The notion of the aggravation of class struggle under socialism was not shared by many other prominent leaders, such as Nikolai Bukharin or Leon Trotsky, who argued that there was no longer any bourgeoisie in the Soviet Union to have to struggle with and that the very definition of socialism implies there are no longer antagonistic classes.

According to historian Timothy Snyder, the &quot;theory&quot; served the Stalinist regime both as self-justification for the failures of its policies of collectivization (which were to be blamed on saboteurs rather than on the implementation of the programme) and as an ideological tool for the continuation of mass repression:

== Maoism ==

Mao Zedong&#x27;s theory of class struggle in socialism changed over time, having some similarities with Stalin&#x27;s theory but also differences with it.

In 1956, Mao criticized Stalin&#x27;s theory and agreed with Khrushchev: &quot;After the elimination of classes, the class struggle should not continue to be stressed as though it was being intensified, as was done by Stalin with the result that the healthy development of socialist democracy was hampered. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union is completely right in firmly correcting Stalin&#x27;s mistakes in this respect.&quot;

However, after China officially entered the primary stage of socialism in 1956–58, Mao&#x27;s theory changed as he came into conflict with his rivals. Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping argued that since China was now socialist and the bourgeoisie was virtually nonexistent, class struggle was over. Mao instead warned against the small remaining bourgeoisie and lingering bourgeois ideas in society, and began speaking of class struggle in socialism, such as in the famous slogan &quot;Never forget class struggle!&quot; once plastered across China.

Mao&#x27;s greatest divergence with Stalin was during his radical phase in the 1960s when he said that there is the possibility of an entire bourgeoisie developing inside the Communist Party bureaucracy in a socialist (pre-communist) society, and restoring capitalism from within. The leaders of this domestic bourgeoisie were the &quot;people in positions of authority within the Party who take the capitalist road&quot;, i.e. Mao&#x27;s rivals like Liu and Deng. Mao stressed the domestic origin of the bourgeoisie while Stalin had focused on presumed Western spies and believed restoration could only come through a foreign imperialist invasion. After the end of the radical phase of the Cultural Revolution, Mao stopped targeting the alleged bourgeoisie within the party, and changed from judging people&#x27;s class based on economic or political power (past or present), to instead being based only on their &quot;class standpoint&quot;.

== Criticism ==
Martemyan Ryutin, a staunch opponent of Stalin, eventually executed in 1937, argued in his manuscript &quot;Stalin and the Crisis of the Proletarian Dictatorship&quot;, secretly circulated and known as the Ryutin Platform, that this theory is groundless. Ryutin concluded that this theory serves to justify the political repression of Russian peasants conducted by Stalin.

Nikita Khrushchev in his Secret Speech at the 20th Congress of the CPSU in 1956 argued that it was &quot;a theoretical justification of the mass terror policy&quot;.

Similarly, György Lukács criticized the theory in 1968 as non-Marxist and as a vehicle to serve Stalin&#x27;s tactical maneuvers:

<text>Samlor machu ( – &#x27;sour soup&#x27;) is a Khmer term for a category of sour soups.

The sour flavour of the soup comes from the use of tamarind (), however variations also include other tangy fruits and vegetables such as tomatoes (), pineapples (), water spinach (), leaf celery, as well as &quot;Tiliacora triandra&quot; leaves (). 

Meat in this type of soup is usually that of either chicken, fish, pork, beef, lobster or crab. In the U.S. and Canada, instead of using fresh tamarind like in Cambodia, a powdered tamarind soup base mix is also used by the diaspora. One popular brand is manufactured by Knorr.

== Types ==
There are many types of Khmer sour soups such as: 
*&quot;Samlor machu yuon&quot; () with meat, such as chicken or fish, tomatoes, pineapple, and other vegetables and herbs.
*&quot;Samlor machu srae&quot; () with fresh and dried fish, crab and green papaya;
*&quot;Samlor machu kroeung&quot; ():
:*&quot;Samlor machu kroeung sach ko&quot; () with beef tenderloin, yellow &quot;kroeung&quot;, water spinach, fish sauce and/or &quot;prahok&quot;, as well as green beans, and eggplants.
:*&quot;Samlor machu kroeung sach chrouk&quot; with pork ribs, yellow &quot;kroeung&quot;, watercress, wax gourd, fish sauce and/or &quot;prahok&quot;.
*&quot;Samlor machu ktis&quot; () with pork, pineapple and coconut milk.

<doc id="1110558" wikidata="Q5455837" url="?curid=1110558" title="Five Billion Years of Change">
<text>Five Billion Years of Change: A History of the Land (2003, ) is a book by Denis Wood that attempts a holistic view of reality that ranges from the Big Bang to the World Wide Web. Specifically, this books deals with the formation of various structures:
*the universe
*the Earth and its atmosphere, oceans, and continents
*the origin of life
*the evolution of humans
*the development of agriculture
*the rise and fall of civilizations
*contemporary globalization

A key theme is repeated through this book: humans have a tendency to divide our understandings into &quot;history&quot; and &quot;prehistory&quot;. People are shocked when some event from prehistory intrudes upon their current lives; Wood likens the shock of this intrusion to an expulsion from the Garden of Eden. This division is a metaphor for various artificial divisions; for example:
*the formation of the Earth, the pre-biotic chemistry, and the origin of life
*before the Industrial Revolution and our subsequent modern era
Instead of thinking in terms of artificial divisions of &quot;now&quot; and &quot;back then&quot;, readers should develop an intuitive mindset of graduated changes in which the &quot;fossils&quot; of the ancient past are intermingled with contemporary objects; for instance, the &quot;oxygen holocaust&quot; of the paleoproterozoic eon exists in today&#x27;s oxygen-rich atmosphere.

Also, the heroic saga induces another faulty thinking style that obscures the true nature of the world. To understand the real story of humanity, Wood argues that people must focus on the mass actions of people or of large impersonal forces rather than a few heroes or kings. Hollywood movies dealing with ecological threats are especially misleading; rather than imparting an accurate image of ecological issues, movies present a villain such as a mad scientist or a greedy, evil business person. Instead, such entertainment and much news reporting distracts us from our individual actions that are at the heart of ecological problems.

Inaccurate ways of thinking induce a passive helplessness. Instead, by presenting a sweeping story of successive, interlinked, long term trends, the author hopes to give readers a flexible, authentic model of the world. With that model, readers will be capable of understanding (and possibly dealing with) current global challenges.

<text>Braddon is an inner north suburb of Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, Australia located adjacent to the Canberra CBD.

The suburb is one of the oldest suburbs in Canberra, a relatively young city, settled in 1922 and gazetted as a division name in September 1928. It contained Canberra&#x27;s first light-industrial area. In recent years this area has begun to be redeveloped as an entertainment and residential precinct. Other areas have been redeveloped with flats. It is now Canberra&#x27;s most densely populated suburb.

==History==
The construction of the Braddon Garden City heritage precinct the area bounded by Donaldson, Elimatta, Batman and Currong streets began in 1921 and 1922. This was the only completed example of a design for a residential area in Canberra by Walter Burley Griffin. The suburb was gazetted as a division name in September 1928.
Braddon is named after Edward Braddon, a Federalist, legislator and a participant in the writing of the Australian Constitution. Streets in Braddon were named for Aboriginal words, legislators and pioneers. The first light-industrial area in Canberra was established in Braddon in the 1920s and subsequently became the centre of automotive trades, before these businesses were established in the service areas of Phillip, Belconnen and Tuggeranong and in Fyshwick and Mitchell. In recent years the light-industrial area has begun to be redeveloped as an entertainment and residential precinct. Most of the residential areas of the suburb have been redeveloped with flats.

===Heritage listed areas===

The following areas are heritage listed:
*The Braddon Garden City heritage precinct, bounded by Donaldson, Elimatta, Batman and Currong streets.
*Gorman House
*Hotel Ainslie (Mercure Canberra)
*Ainslie Primary
*The Whitley House at the corner of Limestone Avenue and Ipima Street, a modernist house built in 1939, considered by the ACT Heritage Council to be &quot;among the first government designed and built single-storey detached houses in the Functionalist style in Australia.&quot; The Heritage Council has permitted flats to be built behind the house, but the view of the house from Limestone Avenue has been preserved.
*Haig Park.
*Northbourne Oval.
*The former Coggan&#x27;s Bakery, 36 Mort Street, Braddon.

==Description==

Braddon contains a commercial area centred on Mort and Lonsdale streets, which run parallel to Northbourne Avenue. The area includes several small art galleries, car rental agencies, a few mid-market restaurants, cafes and bars, trendy gift and clothes shops, as well as liquor stores and a Centrelink office. It formerly contained many car dealerships and businesses providing automotive services, but some of these are being redeveloped with six-storey apartment buildings with commercial uses on the ground floor. There are also a number of popular pubs and low-rise office blocks in the suburb.

Away from the commercial areas, much of the previously suburban housing in Braddon has been replaced with apartment buildings that are popular due to their relatively close proximity to the city. The old Fenner Hall, a residence of the Australian National University, is located along Northbourne Avenue, now as the Canberra Accommodation Centre. The suburb is socially mixed with its population including many younger professionals and students, along with some recipients of public housing assistance. Some traditional single-family homes do remain where the suburb borders Ainslie and Dickson.

===Current zoning===
Most of the single houses north of Haig Park and in Section 22 (surrounded by Torrens, Girrahween, Fawkner and Elouera streets) have been replaced by two or three-storey flats in recent years as a result of being zoned in the Inner North Precinct. Land adjoining Northbourne Avenue is now zoned to permit redevelopment with 25 metres (about 8 storeys) high flats or 32 metres (about 11 storeys) at the corners of Wakefield Avenue with Northbourne Avenue. The area south of Haig Park between Mort and Torrens streets in zoned to allow mixed use developments, generally 22 metres high (6 or 7 storeys), but 16 metres high (5 storeys) facing Torrens street and up to 30 metres high (about 10 storeys) facing Cooyong street.

The area between Ainslie Avenue, Cooyong, Donaldson and Currong street, currently occupied by four and eight-storey government flats (Allawah Court and Currong Apartments) and Catholic church land, is currently proposed for redevelopment with mixed-use buildings, with a range of building heights between 5 and 12 storeys. Originally two buildings at the corners of Ainslie Avenue were proposed to be 15 storeys high. The eastern parts of the suburb continue to be zoned for low-rise suburban housing except the sections adjacent to Ainslie Avenue, which are zoned for three-storey flats, except for Gorman House—which is heritage listed—and the Hotel Ainslie (Mercure Canberra) site—which is also heritage listed and zoned for a two-storey hotel.

==Features==
===Ainslie School===

Ainslie School fronts onto Donaldson Street is one of Canberra&#x27;s oldest schools. It was opened in 1927 as the first official act of the Prime Minister Stanley Bruce following his arrival in Canberra. It is described by the ACT Heritage Commission as having &quot;a high degree of integrity with intact street and site planting and relatively intact built elements and original internal fittings in the Art Deco style.&quot; It is also believed to be &quot;the first in Australia to be planned with a library, a lecture room and a needlework room&quot;. The original building was completed in 1927 and, with the opening of a larger building for the primary in 1938, it became the infants school. From 1980, the building was occupied by Questacon (until 1988) and the School Without Walls (until 1997). In recent years it has been occupied by the Ainslie Arts Centre.

===Allawah Court and Currong Apartments===

The three-storey Allawah Court flats (containing 114 two-bedroom flats) were completed east of Cooyong street and north of Ainslie Avenue in 1956, the three-storey Bega Court was completed south of Ainslie Avenue in Reid in 1957 and the eight-storey Currong Apartments (184 one-bedroom flats and 28 of two bedrooms) were completed east of Allawah Court and west of Currong Street in 1959 in order to cope with a critical lack of accommodation for public servants transferred to Canberra. The ACT Heritage Council described them as having been designed in the Post-War International style &quot;similar to post-war housing in Europe, particularly in English new towns. The fine proportions, crisp detailing and low scale of [the Allawah and Bega Courts]
and their siting continuing the street pattern made them more architecturally successful than the three eight-storey blocks of flats along Currong Street which completed the development.&quot; The Heritage Council declined to heritage list the buildings and despite some local opposition it was proposed that they be demolished and replaced by more modern and denser accommodation along with some commercial uses. The demolition was completed in August 2017.

===Braddon Garden City heritage precinct===
The area bounded by Donaldson, Elimatta, Batman and Currong streets, including the street furniture, are heritage listed as &quot;an early 20th century &#x27;Garden City&#x27; planned subdivision&quot; and as an example of early Federal Capital planning philosophy and architecture among other things. This area was originally named the &quot;Ainslie Cottages Project&quot; and the first houses were constructed between 1921 and 1922 to meet the urgent need for housing for lower grade public servants and workmen to build the civic centre and other parts of the city. It is the first expression of the Garden City concept in Canberra and it is the only completed example of a design for a residential area in Canberra by Walter Burley Griffin.

===The Former Coggan&#x27;s Bakery===

According to the ACT Heritage Council, the former Coggan&#x27;s Bakery, 36 Mort Street (actually facing Elouera Street), &quot;has a special association with the cultural phase of early planning and development of the nation&#x27;s capital in the 1920s.&quot; It formed part of the Federal Capital Commission&#x27;s early planning and was established with the designation of the Braddon area as a light-industrial zone. The Heritage Council said that Coggan&#x27;s Bakery &quot;remains as the most historically distinctive structure in the Braddon industrial area.&quot;

===Gorman House Arts Centre===

The Gorman House Arts Centre is a significant heritage complex that has been adapted for arts use. It is occupied by some of the ACT&#x27;s key arts organisations, smaller arts groups and individual artists.

The centre accommodates intimate performance spaces, dance studios and workshops, a gallery, artists&#x27; studios, small offices for arts business, meeting rooms and a weekend art, craft and second-hand market.
Braddon&#x27;s theatres and galleries are located within the Gorman House Arts Centre. They are: Bogong Theatre; Canberra Contemporary Art Space; Canberra Youth Theatre; Currong Theatre Studio; and Ralph Wilson Theatre

===Haig Park===

Haig Park lies on either side of Northbourne Avenue in Braddon and Turner and comprises fourteen rows of trees planted to form a windbreak and shelterbelt. It is listed on the ACT Heritage register.

===Hotel Ainslie (Mercure Canberra)===

The Hotel Ainslie (currently operating as the Mercure Canberra) was built in the English Arts and Craft style as a government hostel to accommodate the transfer of public servants in 1926 and 1927. Since 1928 it has operated as a hotel (at times called the Ainslie Rex and Olims Canberra Hotel) and has been extended significantly to the southwest. The exterior of the original structure, the garden in front of the hotel, including the Atlas cedars, Mediterranean cypresses and the Atlas cedars along Batman Street and the landscaped central courtyard are heritage listed.

===Lonsdale Street===

Historically an industrial area comprising car yards and factories, Lonsdale Street has in recent decades transformed into a cosmopolitan hub and the commercial centre of Braddon. Lonsdale Street is home to shops selling items by original Canberra designers, stylish Australian fashions, imported designer shoes and handcrafted gifts and homewares. There is also a mix of restaurants, bakeries, bike shops, food vans, camping stores, car yards and hairdressing salons. 

During the Summernats car festival, Lonsdale Street is the site of an annual unofficial street parade, the &quot;Lonsdale Street Cruise&quot;. The parade features all types of cars and draws crowds of spectators.

Lonsdale Street was named Canberra&#x27;s &#x27;hippest hood&#x27; by The Sydney Morning Herald in September 2013.

===Merici College===

Merici College is a private Roman Catholic girls&#x27; high school catering for years 7 to 12.

===Northbourne Flats===
The Northbourne Flats are located on both sides of Northbourne Avenue in Braddon and Turner. The flats provided the first high-density housing project on Northbourne Avenue, now characterised by high-density living. In 2011, the ACT Government ran a national design competition to remodel the flats, to make way for the new development current public housing tenants will be relocated to other properties.

===Northbourne Oval===

Northbourne Oval was established in 1925, making it North Canberra&#x27;s oldest enclosed oval. It is listed by the ACT Heritage Council. Since 2020 the oval has been in used by the Canberra Raiders as their training ground.

===Places of worship===
* St Patrick&#x27;s Catholic Church, built in 1935.
* St Columbus Uniting Church
* Salvation Army Canberra City Temple
* St Mary&#x27;s Catholic Church
* Sisters of Mercy
* Australian Episcopal Conference

Braddon&#x27;s vegetation is predominantly exotic, belonging to the cedar, ash, oak and pine varieties, although there are a significant number of eucalypts which are planted mainly around the perimeter of the suburb (Northbourne Avenue, Limestone Avenue, Ainslie Avenue) and within Haig Park. Most of the neighbourhood&#x27;s streets are lined with avenues of mature exotic trees. Torrens Street, planted with oak (Quercus palustris), is a particularly fine example of a &#x27;garden city&#x27; streetscape. Haig Park has mixed plantings including cedar, eucalypt, pine, cypress, ash and oak (Cedrus deodara, Eucalyptus cinerea, Pinus radiata, Cupressus sempervirens, Fraxinus velutina and Quercus palustris respectively).

Poisonous mushrooms are known to grow in Braddon, including death caps which are commonly found near established oak trees.

<doc id="1110566" wikidata="Q354510" url="?curid=1110566" title="Ernie Chambers">
<text>Ernest William Chambers (born July 10, 1937) is an American politician and civil rights activist who represented North Omaha&#x27;s 11th District in the Nebraska State Legislature from 1971 to 2009 and again from 2013 to 2021. He could not run in 2020 due to term limits.

Chambers is the longest-serving state senator in Nebraska history, having represented North Omaha for 46 years. For most of his career, Chambers was the only nonwhite senator. He is the only African-American to have run for governor and the first to have run for the U.S. Senate in Nebraska history. For years he was the only openly atheist member of any state legislature in the United States.

==Early life==
Chambers was born in the Near North Side neighborhood of Omaha, Nebraska, to Malcolm Chambers, a local minister, and Lillian Chambers. His father&#x27;s family originally came from Mississippi and his mother&#x27;s family originally came from Louisiana. He has six siblings, who were all born in Omaha.

In 1955, Chambers graduated from Omaha Tech High School. In 1959, he graduated from Creighton University with a B.A. in history, with minors in Spanish and philosophy. He attended Creighton University School of Law in the early 1960s and completed his degree in 1979.

He refused to join the Nebraska State Bar Association, so was unable to practice law; in 2015, he explained his refusal on the grounds that he had earned the right to practice by passing law school, and should not have to pay the Bar Association dues as well.

==Career==

===Omaha Post Office===
In 1963, when Chambers was 25, he worked for the Omaha Post Office. He has said he was fired for insubordination because he spoke out against the management at the Post Office calling the black staff &quot;boys&quot;. He picketed the Postmaster General&#x27;s speech in Omaha with a sign that read, &quot;I spoke against discrimination in the Omaha Post Office and was fired.&quot;

===Summer 1966 riots===
During a series of heat waves in 1966, there were two disturbances in Omaha. In July, the Nebraska National Guard was summoned to restore order after police and black teenagers clashed three nights in a row. In early August, a series of riots occurred over three nights. Chambers worked as a spokesperson for the community during both conflicts, meeting with Mayor A.V. Sorenson and helping to end the riots.

During this period, Chambers emerged as a prominent leader in the North Omaha community, where he successfully negotiated concessions from the city&#x27;s leaders on behalf of North Omaha&#x27;s African-American youth. Chambers headed a committee of the Near North Side Police-Community Relations Council, collated information, and presented numerous complaints about the police to city officials. The African-American community had previously been led by more established organizations like Omaha Urban League and the local chapter of the NAACP, not an emerging young anti-establishment leader like Chambers.

Chambers was working as a barber at the time, and appeared in the Oscar-nominated 1966 documentary film &quot;A Time for Burning&quot;, where he talked about race relations in Omaha.

===Nebraska Legislature===
In 1968, Chambers ran for a position on the Omaha School Board, but was not elected. He also failed as a write-in candidate for the Omaha City Council in 1969. In 1970 he was elected to represent North Omaha&#x27;s 11th District in the Nebraska State Legislature, replacing George W. Althouse, who had been appointed to replace Senator Edward Danner, who had died in office. During the election, a policeman was killed in a deserted house by a bomb. Two Black Panthers, David Rice and Edward Poindexter, were charged in the death. Chambers protested, as he thought the men had been framed by COINTELPRO.

Chambers was reelected to the Legislature in every ensuing election through 2004. On April 25, 2005, Chambers became Nebraska&#x27;s longest-serving state senator, having served for more than 35 years. He was not allowed to seek reelection in 2008 because of a constitutional amendment Nebraska voters passed in 2000 that limits Nebraska state legislators to two consecutive four-year terms. But the amendment permits senators to seek reelection to their office after sitting out for four years, and Chambers defeated incumbent Brenda Council in 2012 by a &quot;landslide&quot;.

Chambers also ran for the United States Senate in 1988 as a New Alliance Party candidate. He petitioned to be included on the 1974 ballot for governor of Nebraska and also ran for governor in 1994, receiving 0.43% of the vote.

==== South African divestment ====

Because of a legislative resolution Chambers introduced in 1980, Nebraska became the first state to divest from South Africa in protest of apartheid. Upon discovering that the University of Nebraska held several hundred gold Krugerrands as an investment, Chambers introduced a nonbinding resolution calling for reinvestment of state pension funds that had been invested directly or indirectly in South Africa. The resolution argued that apartheid was contrary to Nebraska&#x27;s principles of human rights and legal equality.

Nebraska&#x27;s divestment caused little immediate change in business practices; David Packard of Hewlett-Packard said, &quot;I&#x27;d rather lose business in Nebraska than with South Africa.&quot; But other state governments and eventually the federal government followed Nebraska&#x27;s example, contributing to the end of apartheid. Chambers spearheaded a stronger 1984 law mandating divestment, resulting in Nebraska&#x27;s public employee pension funds divesting $14.6 million in stocks issued by companies that did business with South Africa. Archbishop Desmond Tutu later visited Lincoln, where he remarked that Nebraska had helped to end apartheid. The state government conspicuously did not invite Chambers to Tutu&#x27;s speaking event.

====&quot;Marsh v. Chambers&quot;====

Chambers filed a lawsuit in 1980 attempting to end the Legislature&#x27;s practice of beginning its session with a prayer offered by a state-supported chaplain, arguing that it was unconstitutional under the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The district court held that the prayer did not violate the Constitution, but that state support for the chaplain did. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals held that both practices violated the Constitution, but in &quot;Marsh v. Chambers&quot; (1983), the Supreme Court held by a 6–3 vote that both practices were constitutional because of the United States&#x27; &quot;unique history&quot;.

==== 1986 NCAA student athletes as state employees ====
Chambers has promoted recognizing NCAA student athletes as state employees since the 1980s, arguing that they are generating revenue for their universities without any legal benefits for doing so, which encourages illegal payments and gifts. A bill on this issue was passed by the Legislature but was unable to overcome the governor&#x27;s veto. After it was revealed that requiring student athletes to be recognized as state employees would jeopardize any university&#x27;s NCAA standing, the language of the bill was changed so that a university could allow for players to be paid a stipend, after which the bill passed and was signed by the governor in 2003.

====1989 Franklin scandal====
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, unidentified people present at a closed meeting reported that Chambers claimed he heard credible reports of &quot;boys and girls, some of them from foster homes, who had been transported around the country by airplane to provide sexual favors, for which they were rewarded.&quot;

Investigating what became known as the Franklin child prostitution ring allegations, a Nebraska grand jury was convened to investigate the allegations and possibly return indictments. Eventually, the grand jury ruled the entire matter was &quot;a carefully crafted hoax,&quot; although they failed to identify the perpetrators of the hoax.

====1993 LGBT anti-discrimination bill====
Nebraska&#x27;s LGBT community has considered Chambers an ally since the 1970s. In 1993, he co-sponsored a bill to prohibit employment discrimination by sexual orientation. The bill faced fierce opposition. Opponents of the anti-discrimination legislation formed a Nebraska chapter of the Traditional Values Coalition and brought activist Lou Sheldon to Lincoln to organize antigay rallies outside the Capitol building.

Despite the opposition, Chambers sponsored another LGBT anti-discrimination bill in 1995. He continued to support similar measures throughout his career in the legislature. None of them has been successful.

====2006 Omaha Public Schools controversy====
In April 2006, Chambers introduced legislative bill (LB) 1024, an amendment to a bill that would divide the Omaha Public Schools district into three different districts. The bill and its amendment were created in response to an effort by the district to &quot;absorb a string of largely white schools that were within the Omaha city limits but were controlled by suburban or independent districts.&quot; Omaha Schools claimed that the usurpation was necessary to avoid financial and racial inequity, but supporters of LB 1024 contested the district&#x27;s expansion, favoring more localized control. The bill received national attention and some critics called it &quot;state-sponsored segregation&quot;.

LB 641, passed in 2007, repealed and superseded LB 1024, restoring pre-2006 Omaha-area school district boundaries, after which a &quot;learning community&quot; was created to equalize student achievement in Douglas and Sarpy counties.

====2007 lawsuit against God====

Some members of the Nebraska legislature attempted to ban frivolous lawsuits from Nebraska&#x27;s court system in 2007. Chambers believed that this attempt was misguided, and that access to the court system should not be restricted. To dramatize his point that the court system must be entirely open, Chambers filed a lawsuit against God in Douglas County district court in September 2007. It argued that God has caused &quot;widespread death, destruction, and terrorization of millions upon millions of the Earth&#x27;s inhabitants.&quot;

Nebraska media inaccurately reported that Chambers&#x27;s lawsuit against God was intended as an ironic protest against frivolous lawsuits. Chambers clarified that, on the contrary, his lawsuit against God &quot;emphasized that attempts by the Legislature to prohibit the filing of any lawsuit would run afoul of the Nebraska Constitution&#x27;s guarantee that the doors to the courthouse must be open to everyone.&quot;

The Westboro Baptist Church filed an amicus brief in the lawsuit arguing that Chambers did not have standing to sue, and that he was &quot;fully deserving of the outpourings of God&#x27;s fierce wrath.&quot; In response, Chambers voiced disagreement with the church but argued that the church&#x27;s access to the court system must be protected, just like his.

The lawsuit was dismissed in October 2008 because a summons notifying God of the lawsuit could not be delivered to the defendant, who has no listed address. Chambers countered that, because of God&#x27;s omniscience, God had been notified, but decided not to pursue the suit further.

====Capital punishment====
Chambers is a firm opponent of the death penalty, and introduced a bill to repeal Nebraska&#x27;s capital punishment law at the start of each legislative session, 36 times over 40 years. The bill, LB268, passed the legislature in 1979 but could not overcome Governor Charles Thone&#x27;s veto; the issue remained a primary focus of his while in office.

In 2015, Chambers again introduced LB268. The measure passed the legislature over Governor Pete Ricketts&#x27;s veto. Following the veto, a petition drive was undertaken to reject the bill and maintain capital punishment. Enough signatures were secured to suspend LB268 until the November 2016 general election; in the election, 60% of the votes cast favored rejecting the repeal and keeping the death penalty.

====Assorted legislation====

* Chambers has long advocated on behalf of David Rice and Ed Poindexter, who were convicted of the murder of an Omaha police officer; Amnesty International considers them political prisoners.
* Often clashing with fellow senators, Chambers has taken on several issues of concern to rural Nebraskans during his tenure, such as a bill requiring landowners to manage the population of black-tailed prairie dogs on their property and a proposed constitutional amendment to preserve the right to fish, trap and hunt in the state. Chambers described the latter measure as one of the most &quot;asinine, simple-minded pieces of trash&quot; ever considered by the legislature. In 2004 Chambers co-authored an opinion piece with U.S. Representative Tom Osborne opposing a set of initiatives that would allow casino gambling and slot machines in Nebraska. Chambers also opposed proposed funding of the state&#x27;s ethanol plant incentive programs, calling them &quot;a boondoggle&quot;.
* Chambers has long supported feminist goals. For example, he argued forcefully in favor of a law against sexually assaulting one&#x27;s spouse in 1975 that made Nebraska the first US state to outlaw marital assault.
* In 2006, Chambers withdrew support from two tax incentive bills that would have provided funding for Omaha and Lincoln civic building projects. He said he withdrew support because Omaha business leaders had insulted the legislature and the North Omaha community he represents by criticizing the passage of LB 1024. He was also insulted by the Omaha City Council&#x27;s refusal to name a North Omaha park after him despite that neighborhood&#x27;s request to do so.
* In 2015, Chambers introduced LB473, opposing the Keystone XL pipeline.
* In 2016, Chambers filibustered a bill that would have changed Nebraska&#x27;s congressional district method of electoral college vote splitting into a winner-take-all system like that of other US states. Because the vote-splitting method was preserved, one district in Nebraska assigned an electoral college vote to Joe Biden in the 2020 presidential election.

==Outreach activities==
* On November 4, 2008, Chambers was elected to the new Douglas and Sarpy Counties&#x27; Learning Community Board; he was sworn in during 2009.
* Chambers hosted a weekly call-in public-access television cable TV show on Omaha&#x27;s Community Telecast, Inc. (CTI22), broadcast on Cox Channel 22.
* In 2014, after ending his regular &quot;Omaha Star&quot; column, Chambers said he was going to write a blog.
* Chambers distributes &quot;Erniegrams&quot; to other legislators that consist of typed poems and commentary about recent events and legislative topics in the current session, as well as photocopied articles and political cartoons of note, which are sometimes posted by other legislators on Twitter as Chambers does not use computers.

==Controversy==
===Term limit law===
In 2000, a term-limit amendment was passed that essentially forced Chambers—and half of Nebraska&#x27;s state senators—out of office in 2008. The amendment required legislators sit out one term, after which they could run for election. In 2012, Chambers was once again elected to represent north Omaha&#x27;s 11th district in the Nebraska Unicameral, defeating Brenda Council by 3,408 votes, with 10,336 votes cast. He was forced to sit out the 2020 election due to the same law.

===&quot;My ISIS is the police&quot;===
On March 20, 2015, during a Judiciary Committee hearing on allowing guns in bars (LB 635), Chambers said, &quot;My ISIS is the police.&quot; He said his comments were intended to criticize the failure to prosecute Alvin Lugod, the Omaha police officer who fatally shot Danny Elrod on February 23. Although fellow senators did not react to his comments during the hearing, there was backlash. Omaha Police Chief Todd Schmaderer responded, &quot;The comments that Senator Ernie Chambers made today at the Nebraska Unicameral are not only reprehensible but are completely without merit.&quot; Omaha Mayor Jean Stothert also criticized Chambers, saying in a press release that he should be looking for ways to improve public safety instead of &quot;comparing police officers to terrorists.&quot;

Governor Pete Ricketts called Chambers&#x27;s comments &quot;irresponsible&quot; and asked for an apology. Stothert, Police Chief Todd Schmaderer, and Nebraska Attorney General Doug Peterson were also critical, and the hashtag #supportblue was organized in response to Chambers&#x27;s comments. Senator David Schnoor of Scribner called for his resignation.

Senator Bob Krist of Omaha said he regretted that he had not immediately protested the remark. Several other senators disagreed with Chambers&#x27;s opinion but defended his right to express it. Senator Dave Bloomfield of Hoskins remarked, &quot;It&#x27;s a wonderful opportunity to pile onto Senator Chambers.&quot; Chambers said he would continue to be vocal in his criticism of the police and would not apologize.

===Residency challenge===
On November 8, 2016, Chambers was reelected to the legislature, defeating his opponent, John Sciara, by a vote of 7,763 to 1,726. In January 2017, Sciara filled a protest challenge to the legislature, claiming Chambers did not live in the district he was elected to represent and was thus ineligible to hold office. Chambers denied the allegation, calling it &quot;busybody, gossipy, vengeful cud that already has been chewed.&quot; On April 20, 2017, Nebraska state senators voted 42-0 to dismiss Sciara&#x27;s challenge, following the recommendation of a special legislative committee formed to evaluate the claim.

== Legacy ==
Chambers is a longtime civil rights activist and the most prominent and outspoken African-American leader in the state. He has been called &quot;the Maverick of Omaha&quot; and the &quot;angriest black man in Nebraska&quot;, and has called himself a &quot;Defender of the Downtrodden&quot;.

In the 1990s, the apartment complex Strehlow Terrace was renamed Ernie Chambers Court. In 2008, a room at the Nebraska Capitol used for Judiciary Committee meetings was named the Ernie Chambers Memorial Hearing Room.

=== Awards ===

The Freedom from Religion Foundation awarded Chambers a plaque naming him a &quot;Hero of the First Amendment&quot; at their annual convention in 2005 in Orlando.

Chambers was offered a Distinguished Service award from the American Humanist Association in 2007, but he turned it down. He accepted a Lifetime Achievement Award from the association in 2016 at its 75th anniversary conference in Chicago.

==Personal life==
Aside from serving in the United States Army, Chambers has lived in Nebraska all his life. He is known for his casual attire of blue jeans and short-sleeved sweatshirts, even when in session at the Nebraska Legislature. He often brings his dog with him to work. Chambers is a sketch artist, a therapeutic activity he adopted during long legislative sessions.

Chambers was married to Jacklyn Adele (née Lee) Chambers (January 31, 1940 – July 15, 2000), with whom he had four children before they divorced.

===Atheism===

Chambers is an atheist. He views Christianity as a tool of oppression that white people use against Black Americans. For example, in 1965 he called the shooting of fellow Omaha native Malcolm X a &quot;brutal, American-Christian style assassination.&quot; Chambers is very familiar with and quotes frequently from the Bible, which he jokingly calls &quot;the Bibble&quot;.

For years Chambers was the only openly atheist member of any state government in the nation. A 2015 &quot;State Legislatures Magazine&quot; survey confirmed that he was the only atheist in a state legislature. He was still the only one in the nation in 2017 according to Kurt Andersen in &quot;The Atlantic&quot;. In 2019 another atheist, Megan Hunt, joined Chambers in the Nebraska legislature.

Despite not being religious, in January 2009 Chambers obtained credentials as a non-denominational minister so he could officiate at weddings.

<text>Raphael Saadiq (; born Charles Ray Wiggins; May 14, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and record producer. He rose to fame as a vocalist for the R&amp;B group Tony! Toni! Toné!, which he formed with his brother D&#x27;Wayne and cousin Timothy Christian Riley in 1986. Along with his groupwork and solo career, he has produced and written songs for other R&amp;B artists, including Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Stevie Wonder, Beyoncé, Total, Joss Stone, D&#x27;Angelo, TLC, En Vogue, Kelis, Mary J. Blige, Ledisi, Whitney Houston, Solange Knowles and John Legend.

Saadiq released four albums—&quot;Who!&quot; (1988), &quot;The Revival&quot; (1990), &quot;Sons of Soul&quot; (1993), and &quot;House of Music&quot; (1996)—with the group before their indefinite hiatus. Prior to the latter, he formed the music production unit the Ummah (with D&#x27;Angelo, Q-Tip, Ali Shaheed Muhammad, and J Dilla) and released his 1995 debut solo single, &quot;Ask of You&quot;, for the soundtrack to the John Singleton film &quot;Higher Learning&quot;. In 1999, he formed the supergroup Lucy Pearl with fellow singers Joi and Dawn Robinson, as well as Ummah cohort Ali Shaheed Muhammad; the group&#x27;s self-titled debut album (2000) was supported by the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100-top 40 single &quot;Dance Tonight&quot;, and served as their only project before disbanding in 2001. Additionally, &quot;Ask of You&quot; peaked within the top 20 of the chart and led him to sign with the now-defunct Universal Records as a solo act. 

He has since released five solo albums, including the critically acclaimed, retro-styled &quot;The Way I See It&quot; (2008) and &quot;Stone Rollin&#x27;&quot; (2011). The contemporary-sounding &quot;Jimmy Lee&quot; was released in 2019, and earned Saadiq further acclaim.

Music critic Robert Christgau has called Saadiq the &quot;preeminent R&amp;B artist of the &#x27;90s&quot;. Saadiq has won two Grammy Awards for his songwriting work, as well as two Golden Globe Award nominations and an Academy Award nomination. Outside of music, Saadiq also co-founded the independent video game developer IllFonic in 2007, which has developed &quot;Friday the 13th: The Game&quot; (2017), &quot;&quot; (2020) and &quot;&quot; (2022), among other titles.

==Early life==
Saadiq was born in Oakland, California, and was the second-youngest of 14 siblings. He attended Castlemont High School. He has had four siblings die at early ages. Saadiq states that he does not want his music to be reflective of the tragedies he experienced, saying that &quot;And through all of that I was makin&#x27; records, but it wasn&#x27;t comin&#x27; out in the music. I did it to kinda show people you can have some real tough things happen in your life, but you don&#x27;t have to wear it on your sleeve.&quot;

He has been playing the bass guitar since the age of six, and first began singing at age nine in a local gospel group. At the age of 12, he joined a group called &quot;The Gospel Humminbirds&quot;. In 1984, shortly before his 18th birthday, Saadiq heard about tryouts in San Francisco for Sheila E.&#x27;s backing band on Prince&#x27;s Parade Tour. At the audition, he chose the name &quot;Raphael&quot;, and had difficulty remembering to respond to the name when he heard that he got the part to play bass in the band. He says of the experience, &quot;Next thing I was in Tokyo, in a stadium, singin&#x27; Erotic City. We were in huge venues with the biggest sound systems in the world; all these roadies throwin&#x27; me basses, and a bunch of models hangin&#x27; round Prince to party. For almost two years. That was my university.&quot;

==Career==

===1987–1999: Tony! Toni! Toné! and The Ummah===


After returning to Oakland from touring with Prince, Saadiq began his professional career as the lead vocalist and bassist in the rhythm and blues and dance trio Tony! Toni! Toné! He used the name Raphael Wiggins while in Tony! Toni! Toné!, along with his brother Dwayne Wiggins, and his cousin Timothy Christian. In the mid-1990s, he adopted the last name Saadiq, which means &quot;man of his word&quot; in Arabic. His change of surname led many to speculate that he had converted to Islam at that point; in reality, Saadiq is not a Muslim, but rather just liked the way &quot;Saadiq&quot; sounded and changed his last name simply to distinguish himself from and avoid potential confusion with his brother, Dwayne Wiggins. As he confirmed by telling noted R&amp;B writer Pete Lewis of the award-winning &#x27;Blues &amp; Soul&#x27; in May 2009, &quot;I just wanted to have my own identity!&quot;

In 1995, Saadiq had his biggest solo hit to date, when &quot;Ask of You&quot;, featured on the &quot;Higher Learning&quot; Soundtrack peaked at #19 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #2 on the R&amp;B chart. In 1995, Saadiq produced and performed on Otis &amp; Shug&#x27;s debut album, &quot;We Can Do Whatever&quot;.

Tony! Toni! Toné! would become major R&amp;B superstars throughout the late 1980s and 1990s. However, after the 1996 album entitled &quot;House of Music&quot; failed to duplicate the group&#x27;s previous success, Tony! Toni! Toné! went their separate ways in 1997.

===1999–2004: Lucy Pearl and first string of solo albums===
In 1999, Saadiq&#x27;s next big project became the R&amp;B supergroup Lucy Pearl. He recorded the self-titled album with Dawn Robinson (En Vogue) and Ali Shaheed Muhammad (A Tribe Called Quest). The group only lasted for one album.

Also in 1999, he collaborated with rapper Q-Tip on the single &quot;Get Involved&quot;, from the animated television series &quot;The PJs&quot;. It samples The Intruders&#x27; 1973 song &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Love My Mama&quot; and charted at number 21 on the US Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks.

His 2000 song collaboration &quot;Untitled (How Does It Feel)&quot; won D&#x27;Angelo a Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance; it was also nominated for Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song. The song was ranked #4 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s &quot;End of Year Critics &amp; Readers Poll&quot; of the top singles of 2000. D&#x27;Angelo&#x27;s album &quot;Voodoo&quot; won a Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Album at the 2001 Grammy Awards.

In 2002, Saadiq founded his own record label, Pookie Entertainment. Among the artists on the label are Joi and Truth Hurts. In 2002, he released his first solo album &quot;Instant Vintage&quot;, which earned him three Grammy Award nominations in addition to another two Grammy nominations for his writing work on “Love of My Life (An Ode to Hip-Hop)” the following year. He released a two-disc live album &quot;All the Hits at the House of Blues&quot; in 2003, and his second studio album &quot;Ray Ray&quot; in 2004, both on Pookie Entertainment.

===2004–2010: Expanded output and second string of albums===
In 2004, Saadiq produced a remix of the song &quot;Crooked Nigga Too&quot; by Tupac Shakur, which is featured on the album &quot;Loyal to the Game&quot;. Other artists he has collaborated with include Whitney Houston, Mary J. Blige, The Isley Brothers, A Tribe Called Quest, Teedra Moses, The Roots, Erykah Badu, Jill Scott, Macy Gray, Angie Stone, Snoop Dogg, Mac Dre, Devin the Dude, DJ Quik, Kelis, Q-Tip, Lil&#x27; Skeeter, Ludacris, The Bee Gees, Musiq Soulchild, Jaguar Wright, Chanté Moore, Lionel Richie, Marcus Miller, Noel Gourdin, Nappy Roots, Calvin Richardson, T-Boz from TLC, Jody Watley, Floetry, Leela James, Amp Fiddler, John Legend, Joss Stone, Young Bellz, Anthony Hamilton, Babyface, Ledisi, Goapele, Ghostface Killah, Ginuwine, The Grouch, Stevie Wonder, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, Bilal, Chali 2na, Larry Graham, Luniz as well as many others. In 2007, Saadiq produced &quot;Introducing Joss Stone&quot;, the third album of British soul singer Joss Stone. According to J. Gabriel Boylan of &quot;The New York Observer&quot;, &quot;he&#x27;s produced artists including Macy Gray, the Roots, D&#x27;Angelo, John Legend, Whitney Houston, Mary J. Blige, and more. With all of them he&#x27;s pushed a classic aesthetic, heavy on organic sounds and light on studio magic, deeply indebted to the past and distrustful of easy formulas.&quot;

Saadiq&#x27;s third solo album, &quot;The Way I See It&quot;, released on Columbia Records on September 16, 2008, available in a collector&#x27;s edition box set of 7&quot; 45 rpm singles as well as on traditional CD, was critically well-received, made several critics&#x27; 2008 best albums lists, and garnered three Grammy nominations including Best R&amp;B Performance by a Duo Or Group With Vocals (for &quot;Never Give You Up&quot;, featuring Stevie Wonder &amp; CJ Hilton); Best Traditional R&amp;B Vocal Performance (for &quot;Love That Girl&quot;) and Best R&amp;B Album for &quot;The Way I See It&quot;. Music from &quot;The Way I See It&quot; was featured in the following motion pictures: &quot;Madea Goes To Jail&quot;, &quot;Bride Wars&quot;, &quot;Cadillac Records&quot;, &quot;Secret Life of Bees&quot;, &quot;In Fighting (Rogue)&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Complicated&quot;.
Touring with a nine piece band, Saadiq hit the 2009 summer music festival circuit with performances at Bonnaroo, Hollywood Bowl, Outside Lands, Pori Jazz, Stockholm Jazz Festival, North Sea Jazz, Essence Music Festival, Summer Spirit Festival, and Nice Jazz Festival, Bumbershoot Music Festival and Austin City Limits. Saadiq has been touring Europe extensively, and held a five-night residency at the House of Blues in Tokyo, Japan, in June 2009. In 2008, Saadiq formed a new label called Velma Records, a place where he promises &quot;people can express themselves like I did with &quot;The Way I See It&quot;... where they can dream something up and just go with it&quot;.

He produced songs for LeToya Luckett&#x27;s forthcoming second album &quot;Lady Love&quot;, released August 2009. In 2009, Saadiq produced &quot;Please Stay&quot; and &quot;Love Never Changes&quot; for Ledisi&#x27;s August 2009 release &quot;Turn Me Loose&quot;. Saadiq also was the executive producer for an emerging group called Tha Boogie. Tha Boogie&#x27;s first EP was released on iTunes and is titled &quot;Love Tha Boogie, Vol. 1 (Steal This Sh*t)&quot;.

In 2009, Saadiq announced his video game development company called IllFonic. The first video game in development by IllFonic is titled &quot;Ghetto Golf&quot;, with an expected release late in 2010. In 2009, Saadiq teamed up Bentley Kyle Evans, Jeff Franklin, Martin Lawrence, and Trenten Gumbs to create a new sitcom called &quot;Love That Girl!&quot; starring Tatyana Ali. Raphael is an executive producer and composer for &quot;Love That Girl!&quot; The show airs on TV One and debuted on January 19, 2010. That same year, Saadiq performed The Spinners hit &quot;It&#x27;s A Shame&quot; in a legendary Levi&#x27;s commercial and sang as part of the chorus in the 2010 remake of &quot;We Are the World&quot; for Haiti.

===2011–present: &quot;Stone Rollin&quot;&#x27;, &quot;Jimmy Lee&quot; and other work===

In 2011, Saadiq was the guitarist/bandleader for the group backing Mick Jagger for Jagger&#x27;s tribute performance of the Solomon Burke R&amp;B classic, &quot;Everybody Needs Somebody to Love&quot; at the 53rd Grammy Awards in Los Angeles and on CBS. The band that accompanied the performance was Saadiq&#x27;s touring band called Stone Rollin. In 2011 he and his band performed as the ESPY&#x27;s house band for the night, where he performed his latest compositions.

Saadiq&#x27;s 2011 album &quot;Stone Rollin&#x27;&quot; was released to great critical acclaim. &quot;He&#x27;s always had a boyish enthusiasm for performing, and a flexible, naturally joyous voice that suggests a young Stevie Wonder,&quot; wrote Greg Kot of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;but with his latest album, Saadiq finds a new gear. The album and his current tour demonstrate that there&#x27;s a big difference between retro and classic, and the artist consistently finds himself on the right side of that divide.&quot; Kot ranked the album number seven in his year-end list, in which he dubbed it Saadiq&#x27;s &quot;finest achievement&quot; and stated, &quot;He&#x27;s always written songs steeped in soul and R&amp;B, but now he gives them a progressive edge with roaming bass lines and haunted keyboard textures. He&#x27;s no longer a retro stylist – he&#x27;s writing new classics.&quot; Critic Jim Derogatis called it &quot;a stone cold gas of a party disc.&quot;

In fall 2011, he performed on the fourth results show of &quot;Dancing with the Stars&quot; season 13. In December 2011, he performed a cover compilation of several Neil Diamond songs at the Kennedy Center Honors award ceremony.

In 2012 he signed a deal with Toyota to do a TV commercial for the Toyota Prius. In 2013 Raphael partnered with Bay Area/ Atlanta Production company EL Seven Entertainment/ Republic Records and then-new R&amp;B singer Adrian Marcel and released his first promotional mixtape &quot;Raphael Saadiq Presents Adrian Marcel 7 Days of Weak&quot;.

Saadiq is a featured bass guitar player on Elton John&#x27;s 2013 album, &quot;The Diving Board&quot;.

In 2016 he executive produced Solange Knowles&#x27; album, &quot;A Seat at the Table&quot;, which debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart in the United States. He also guest starred in &quot;Luke Cage&quot;, where he performs his songs &quot;Good Man&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot; at Harlem&#x27;s Paradise.

In 2017 he appeared in the award-winning documentary film &quot;The American Epic Sessions,&quot; directed by Bernard MacMahon, where he recorded the Memphis Jug Band&#x27;s 1928 song &quot;Stealin&#x27; Stealin&#x27;&quot;. live on the restored first electrical sound recording system from the 1920s. Of recording on the system he said, &quot;it&#x27;s amazing to just look at how it&#x27;s built, you know just look at the machine itself. It just has this like magical sound the way that it&#x27;s built. It&#x27;s true. It&#x27;s just the truest sound you could ever get&quot;.

In 2017, Saadiq collaborated with Mary J. Blige as a songwriter for the movie &quot;Mudbound&quot; (2017), for which they both received Academy Award nominations for Best Original Song.

In 2018, he produced the John Legend holiday themed album, &quot;A Legendary Christmas&quot;.

On August 23, 2019, Saadiq released his fifth album &quot;Jimmy Lee&quot;, to critical acclaim.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, he released a song on his website called &quot;Rony! Roni! Roné!&quot;, as a nod to his group &quot;Tony! Toni! Toné!&quot;.

In 2022, Saadiq was credited as a collaborator on multiple songs from Brent Faiyaz&#x27;s album &quot;Wasteland&quot;, which debuted at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Saadiq also collaborated with Beyoncé on her seventh and eighth studio albums &quot;Renaissance&quot;, for which he received two Grammy award nominations, and 2024&#x27;s Cowboy Carter.

== Equipment ==
Through the course of his career, Saadiq has often played Fender Telecaster and Stratocaster electric guitars.

=== Signature guitar ===
In 2024, Fender announced a collaboration with Saadiq to produce a signature guitar model he designed to be available for purchase. The limited edition Raphael Saadiq Telecaster features a Dark Red Metallic finish, black binding, black headstock, custom acrylic pickguard, and custom Raphael Saadiq single-coil pickups. The model was designed with help from fellow musician Eric Gales, and aesthetically inspired by Saadiq&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Instant Vintage&quot;.

<text>BH (renamed on 2 July 2012; formerly known as Berita Harian) is a Malay-language daily newspaper published in Malaysia. It is owned by the New Straits Times Press. BH was first published on 1 July 1957, marking its debut as a major newspaper in Malaysia. Its Sunday Edition, &quot;BH Ahad&quot; (renamed on 1 July 2012; previously known as &quot;Berita Minggu&quot;), was launched on 10 July 1960.

==Overview==
The newspaper was printed in broadsheet format until 5 July 2008, when it transitioned to a more compact format. In the 2000s, it also began targeting younger readers.

On 1 July 2012, the paper underwent a significant transition, including renaming the &#x27;Ekonomi&#x27; section to &#x27;Bisnes&#x27;, changing the pullout &#x27;Ratu&#x27; to &#x27;Famili&#x27;, and &#x27;Rona&#x27; to &#x27;Kembara&#x27;. Additionally, adjustments were made to the layout, typography, and pagination.

== History ==

On 1 July 1957, Berita Harian, the first romanized Malay morning newspaper, published its inaugural issue. Subsequently, on 10 July 1960, the first romanized Malay Sunday newspaper edition, Berita Minggu, was introduced. During its early stages, Berita Harian emulated the content of the Straits Times and maintained a price of RM0.15, employing a staff of eight individuals to operate the newspaper. Abdul Samad Ismail was appointed as the first editor in April 1958. 

On 1 January 1966, Berita Harian underwent a revision of its masthead. In 1968, the Sunday edition of the newspaper introduced the cartoonist Lat&#x27;s Keluarga Si Mamat cartoon series. In 1972, Ismail was replaced by Abdul Wahab Zain as editor. In 1974, the newspaper underwent an expansion, increasing its page count from 10 to 12. This expansion allowed for the inclusion of additional content about trade, photography, advice, foreign news, and entertainment. Subsequently, on 1 July 1975, the price of the newspaper was raised to RM0.25. Abdul Samad Said became editor in 1976 before being replaced by Salim Kajai in 1978. Edisi Bandar Berita Harian was launched on 29 November 1979. 

In 1981, Berita Harian underwent a comprehensive overhaul, including a change in masthead colour, the introduction of new sections, and an expansion of entertainment content. The price of the newspaper subsequently increased to RM0.35, followed by another raise to RM0.45 in 1983. Adibah Amin assumed the role of editor in the same year, and Ahmad Sebi Abu Bakar took on the position of group editor the following year.

Berita Harian and Berita Minggu were merged into Berita Harian Sdn Bhd on 19 June 1985, and on 20 October, Akhbar Dalam Darjah was launched. Bakar was replaced as group editor in April 1986 by Abdul Kadir Jasin, before being replaced himself by Ahmad Nazri Abdullah on 8 April 1988. The newspaper&#x27;s sports section was expanded on 8 August 1989, to include Jaguh, a 16-page special tabloid pullout. Berita Harian and Berita Minggu were overhauled in December 1991. Berita Harian gained a new tagline, &quot;Sumber Ilmu dan Maklumat Mutakhir&quot;, while Minggu saw its format changed. Special daily supplements were added: Berita Pelajar, Berita Wanita, Berita Teknologi, Jaguh, Perspektif, and Dunia on 1 June 1992. In May 1993, a Komputer subsection was added to the technology content. The subsection would be expanded to a pullout on 5 January 1994, before Berita Komputer was launched on 11 August. Later in 1993, Minda Pelajar was added, and the newspaper price was raised to RM0.70. At this point, the paper was printing 50,000 issues weekly. The newspaper was again overhauled in January 1995, where fonts, images, layouts, and sections were edited. The newspaper then shifted its attention from regional to national and foreign news. A weekly edition, titled Citra, was launched in February, sold at RM1.00. It was discontinued, and its last edition was published on 31 January 2000. Ahmad Rejal Arbee was appointed group editor in July 1998. Later, in November, the price was increased to RM1.20, and the sections were reorganized.

Berita Harian and Berita Minggu were both redesigned in 1999. Its educational sections were expanded in 2001. Their aesthetics were again edited in January 2003, mainly to target younger readers, adding a pullout called IKON on Saturdays in October for youth. In March, the entertainment sections were revamped as well. Hishamuddin Aun was appointed group editor on 18 July. By 2004, circulation had increased to 238,000 daily, and the paper added front-page stories for each region. Malaysia Super League content was added in February on the first Thursday of every month. Zian Johari became Executive Editor of Berita Minggu on 1 June 2004. The cover price of Berita Harian was raised to RM1.50, except for in Sabah and Sarawak, where it was raised to RM2.00. Berita Minggu&#x27;s price was raised to RM2.00 nationally. The two papers were again revamped in June. Come April 2006, Datuk Manja Ismail was appointed Group Editor and Director of Malay publications, and the newspaper added a cellphone service for readers to receive news digitally. In March 2008, Datuk Mustapa Omar was appointed Deputy Group Editor. In July, Berita Harian and Minggu ceased their broadsheet format after 51 years and went compact. In July 2009, Datuk Mior, Kamarul Shahid, and Mahfar Ali were appointed Group Editor and Deputy Group Editor at Berita Harian. After launching in 2009, Berita Harian became, by October 2010, the number one online newspaper in Malaysia.

== Digital Transformation ==
In the 21st century, &quot;Berita Harian&quot; expanded its presence online and became one of the prominent digital newspapers in Malaysia by 2010. The newspaper also introduced mobile services to provide readers with easier access to news updates.

== Editorial Leadership ==
Notable journalists who have served as editors of &quot;Berita Harian&quot; include Abdul Samad Ismail, Adibah Amin, and Datuk Manja Ismail. Their leadership contributed to shaping the newspaper&#x27;s editorial policies over the years.

== Format Changes ==
In 2008, &quot;Berita Harian&quot; transitioned from a broadsheet to a compact format to adapt to changing reader preferences. This shift also included updates to its content structure, including youth-oriented sections such as the &quot;IKON&quot; pullout.

== Circulation and Regional Reach ==
In 2004, the daily circulation of &quot;Berita Harian&quot; reached approximately 238,000 copies. Pricing strategies were implemented to cater to readers in different regions, such as Sabah and Sarawak.

== Educational Contributions ==
&quot;Berita Harian&quot; introduced several educational pullouts, including &quot;Berita Pelajar&quot; and &quot;Minda Pelajar&quot;, aimed at engaging students. In 1994, the newspaper launched the &quot;Berita Komputer&quot; pullout, focusing on technology and education.

Also participating in the 2004 Summer Olympics, he achieved second place in his 100 metres heat, thus making it through to the second round. Heading into the second round, he was victorious in a tough sprint, before achieving qualification from his semi-final. This good form was not able to continue, as he failed to finish in the final, staged on August 22, renowned as possibly the fastest collective 100 metre race in history, where six of the seven finishing athletes completed the race in ten seconds or less.

He finally, for the first time, achieved a sub-10 second run on June 14, 2005, in Athens when he ran 9.99 seconds in Asafa Powell&#x27;s world record breaking race. The Ghanaian record currently belongs to Leonard Myles-Mills with 9.98 seconds.

In July 2006, Zakari was reported to have failed a drugs test for the banned substance stanozolol. The test was conducted In-Competition on 29 April 2006 at the IAAF Grand Prix Meeting in Dakar. On 25 September 2006 the IAAF suspended him for two years. After his suspension Zakari participated at the 2008 Summer Olympics in which he ran the fourth time in his 100 metres heat, behind Richard Thompson, Martial Mbandjock and Simone Collio. His time of 10.34 was the third losing time after the 10.25 of Nobuharu Asahara, advancing him to the second round. There he improved his time to 10.24, but finished in fifth place of his heat, causing his elimination from the competition.

<doc id="1110595" wikidata="Q382557" url="?curid=1110595" title="Simon Mayo">
<text>Simon Andrew Hicks Mayo (born 21 September 1958) is an English radio presenter and author who worked for BBC Radio from 1982 until 2022.

Mayo has presented across three BBC stations for extended periods. From 1986 to 2001 he worked for Radio 1, including a five-year stint on the &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast Show&quot;. From 2001 he presented on BBC Radio 5 Live: from his debut until 2009 on a daily afternoon programme, and since then until 2022 with &quot;Kermode and Mayo&#x27;s Film Review&quot; on Fridays. Between January 2010 to December 2018 he was the presenter of &quot;Simon Mayo Drivetime&quot; on BBC Radio 2, for the final six months with co-host Jo Whiley. Since March 2021, &quot;Simon Mayo Drivetime&quot; has returned on Greatest Hits Radio.

In 2008, Mayo was recognised as the &quot;Radio Broadcaster of the Year&quot; at the 34th annual Broadcasting Press Guild Awards, and the &quot;Speech Broadcaster of the Year&quot; at the Sony Radio Academy Awards, receiving the latter for his &quot;ability to paint colourful pictures of location and event and his ability to bring the very best out of his guests, encouraging conversation and interaction between them while skilfully nudging and controlling them&quot; and for being &quot;a master of light and shade, handling serious and lighter issues with aplomb.&quot;

Mayo is also a published author. His works include a book titled &quot;Confessions&quot;, based on the &quot;Confessions&quot; slot from his radio shows, and several fictional thrillers.

==Early life==
Simon Mayo was born in September 1958. His father was a headteacher, and his mother, who had worked as a BBC studio manager in the 1950s, also taught for a time. His father was the headmaster of the Junior School section of Royal Russell School, Croydon, in the late 1960s, which the actor Martin Clunes attended at that time. In the early 1970s, his father was the headmaster of the Herbert Shiner School in Petworth, West Sussex, a middle school or intermediate school.

He attended St John&#x27;s Primary School in Croydon, the Arden School in Knowle in the West Midlands (for one term), the independent Solihull School and Worthing High School for Boys in West Sussex, which was then a state grammar school for boys. He graduated from the University of Warwick in 1981, with a degree in history and politics.

==Early career==
His mother had undertaken part-time work in radio, and having occasionally experienced it with her, Mayo had wanted to work as a studio manager. But as a result of a frequency deficiency in his left ear, he failed the required hearing test, and refocused his career on presenting. Mayo spent some time honing his skills at Southlands Hospital Radio, He had fully planned to start a PGCE course, but instead was offered work, for five years as a presenter with BBC Radio Nottingham from 10:45am to 2pm. With a Radio Nottingham colleague he developed a programme format called &quot;Globe Phone&quot; and sent it to Johnny Beerling, head of Radio 1, who offered him a job.

He joined BBC Radio 1 in 1986, presenting a two-hour Saturday evening show from 7:30pm to 9:30pm. In October 1987 he progressed to the weekend early slots from 6am to 8am, and then became presenter of the weekday evening show in January 1988, which went out from 7:30pm to 10pm. Five months later he was offered the BBC Radio 1 breakfast show, regarded as the most prestigious presentation job in UK radio.

== Shows ==

=== BBC Radio 1 ===

====&quot;Breakfast&quot;====

Mayo spent five years presenting &quot;Radio 1 Breakfast&quot; on BBC Radio 1. Throughout his tenure on the breakfast show, which was based on a &quot;zoo&quot; format, Mayo was joined by news anchor Rod McKenzie and by a sidekick weather and travel presenter: first Carol Dooley, then Sybil Ruscoe, Jackie Brambles, and Dianne Oxberry. Weather and travel news reader stand-ins include Mayo&#x27;s Radio 1 colleague Lynn Parsons, Caron Keating (from &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and &quot;Songs of Praise&quot;), and Philippa Forrester (from CBBC). The show&#x27;s producer was Ric Blaxill, who also made regular speaking contributions.

He started his first breakfast show by playing &quot;Somewhere in My Heart&quot; by Aztec Camera, which was preceded by a montage of previous breakfast show hosts and then Mayo himself saying &quot;It&#x27;s me, Simon Mayo, good morning.&quot;

The programme became known for various features, including &quot;On This Day in History&quot;, sound-tracked by a looped version of George Michael&#x27;s &quot;I Want Your Sex&quot;; the long-running cryptic game &quot;The Identik-Hit Quiz&quot;, where Mayo and his co-hosts would act out a short scene which cryptically led listeners to the title of a hit song; and his &quot;Confessions&quot; feature where members of the public sought absolution for their (often frivolous or humorous) &quot;sins&quot;. Mayo had already presented the dilemma show &quot;Scruples&quot; for BBC television and had joined his Radio 1 colleagues on the host roster for &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Both &quot;On This Day in History&quot; and &quot;Confessions&quot; spawned spin-off books.

Due to frequent plays from Mayo, several unlikely hit singles reached the UK charts, including &quot;Kinky Boots&quot; by Patrick Macnee and Honor Blackman; &quot;Donald Where&#x27;s Your Troosers?&quot; by Andy Stewart; and &quot;Always Look on the Bright Side of Life&quot;, sung and written by Eric Idle. For helping Monty Python have a hit with the latter, thirteen years after it first appeared on the soundtrack to &quot;The Life of Brian&quot;, Idle presented Mayo with a model bare foot, in the style of the animated version which used to end the opening titles to the TV show.

Like all Radio 1&#x27;s high profile presenters of the time, Mayo would take his turn to spend a week in a coastal area of the UK during the Radio 1 Roadshows which ran for two months of the summer. For a short while, he also presented an additional weekend show for the station on a Sunday afternoon, provisionally titled &quot;O Solomon Mayo&quot;, to cover for the absent Phillip Schofield, who was working in the West End.

====Mid-mornings====
Mayo formally gave up the breakfast show in 1993, though he had been on an extended period of paternity leave when the announcement was made. His stand-in Mark Goodier was his replacement.

Mayo took over the station&#x27;s mid-morning slot on 25 October 1993, where he remained until February 2001. In addition to this, in May 1994, he presented &quot;Simon Mayo&#x27;s Classic Years&quot;, where he played two hours of classic pop tunes. The show originally went out on a Sunday lunchtime from noon till 2pm, but in November 1994 went out from 10am till noon on Sundays. This lasted until October 1995.

In January 1997, Mayo made a brief return to the breakfast show for three weeks after Chris Evans was dismissed, but both Mayo and Radio 1 ruled out the possibilities of a permanent return to the programme. On his first morning as breakfast stand-in, Mayo read out an email from a man who had emigrated to New Zealand four years earlier and had arrived back in the UK that morning and was &quot;delighted to hear you&#x27;re still doing the breakfast show&quot;.

In 1999 Mayo broke a world record by broadcasting for 37 hours in aid of that year&#x27;s Comic Relief.

Mayo remained on the mid-morning slot until he left Radio 1 in 2001, seeing breakfast show presenters Mark Goodier, Steve Wright, Chris Evans, Mark and Lard, Kevin Greening, Zoe Ball, and Sara Cox, come and go from the slot, but the slot went to Jo Whiley.

His final show was on Friday 16 February 2001, and before signing off, he said: &quot;One of the reasons I&#x27;m not going to &#x27;do a DLT&#x27; is that I&#x27;ve nothing to complain about at all – though as I&#x27;ll still be employed by the BBC it&#x27;d be a stupid thing to do. I always thought as a kid working at Radio 1 would be the most fun and the best place for any presenter to work and I still think that&#x27;s true.&quot; His final track played on Radio 1 was &quot;Ace of Spades&quot; by Motörhead.

===BBC Radio 5 Live===

In May 2001, after 15 years of broadcasting with Radio 1, Mayo moved on to another national BBC station, BBC Radio 5 Live, to present an afternoon programme. He began broadcasting every weekday from 1pm to 4pm, where he remained until 18 December 2009. He was on air in 2001 when the 9/11 attacks took place in the United States, broadcasting live as the events unfolded.

The programme generally combined topical debates, interviews and reviews. It came live from Westminster each Wednesday for live coverage of Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions, with discussion and debate afterwards with political correspondents and MPs. The programme also featured Mayo&#x27;s former Radio 1 sidekick Mark Kermode reviewing the new movie releases each Friday afternoon. The banter between Mayo and Kermode in this section of the programme was described by both men as &quot;wittertainment at its most wittertaining.&quot; (The neologism &quot;wittertainment&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;&quot; and &quot;entertainment&quot;, and was coined in a now deleted Wikipedia entry. However, Kermode and Mayo took note of the article before its deletion and have since been using the term regularly to refer to their show.)

In a May 2008 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Mayo mentioned he &quot;signed a contract for the next two years&quot; and was uncertain whether he would still be at 5 Live when it moved to Salford. It was later confirmed that Mayo was to move to BBC Radio 2&#x27;s drivetime slot, though he continued to host a weekly two-hour film review show, &quot;Kermode and Mayo&#x27;s Film Review&quot;, on 5 Live with Kermode until April 2022. In May 2009, Mayo and Kermode won a Gold Sony Radio Award in the Speech Award category.

===BBC Radio 2===

In addition to his daily programme on 5 Live, from October 2001 to April 2007, Mayo hosted the Album Chart show each week for BBC Radio 2. Alongside this, on 2 January 2006, he presented &quot;The Ultimate Music Year&quot; for the station, where listeners got the chance to vote for their favourite year for music. He has also presented many &quot;Sold on Song&quot; projects, presented the Top 100 Albums and provided holiday cover for Johnnie Walker on Sundays. From April 2007 to April 2008 Mayo took over the &quot;Radio 2 Music Club&quot; every Monday night from 11:30pm to 12:30am.

In January 2010, Mayo took over from Chris Evans on the Drivetime show, noting he was &quot;very lucky to be given a second chance in such a high-profile slot.&quot; The programme included a number of regular daily features including &quot;Nigel&#x27;s Recipes&quot;, &quot;Confessions&quot;, &quot;Homework Sucks&quot; and &quot;The Showstopper&quot;. Every Friday he hosted &quot;All-Request Friday&quot; where listeners rang the show and had their favourite song played on the radio after a short interview. The show ended on 4 May 2018 after eight years, as Mayo was to begin hosting a revamped drivetime show with co-host Jo Whiley from 14 May 2018. On 22 October that year, the station announced that Mayo would be leaving Radio 2 altogether after a backlash against the change, with Whiley moving back to an evening slot. Their last show together aired on 20 December, with Mayo presenting his last show after 17 years with the station the following day.

As his opening theme Mayo used the 2003 recording by Jools Holland and Prince Buster of the 1948 song &quot;Enjoy Yourself&quot; by Carl Sigman and by Herb Magidson. Later editions of the show also used the popular 1950 hit version by Guy Lombardo and his Royal Canadians. Incidental music included &quot;Light My Fire&quot; by Edmundo Ros.

In May 2011, Mayo won a Sony Award for &quot;Best Music Show&quot; for his work and that of his team on the Radio 2 drive time slot.

On 21 December 2018, Mayo presented his last show on BBC Radio 2, it being an All-Request Friday, which featured his jingles previously used on his drivetime show. The last song to be played was &quot;Bring Me Sunshine&quot; by Morecambe and Wise.

===Scala Radio and Magic Classical===
On 4 March 2019 at 10am, Mayo presented the launch of a new classical music digital radio station, Scala Radio, for which he was one of the lead presenters. He presented a daily mid-morning show for two years, until starting work for Greatest Hits Radio; he continued to present his &quot;Essential Albums&quot; show for Scala on Saturdays until May 2023. He then presented a two-hour show on Sunday mornings, which continues after Scala was rebranded as Magic Classical in September 2024.

===Greatest Hits Radio===
In addition to his daily programme on Scala, Mayo joined Greatest Hits Radio in September 2020, firstly taking over a weekly album show on Sundays from 1-4pm. He then returned to his Monday to Friday drivetime radio show on 15 March 2021 on Greatest Hits Radio, resurrecting many staples from his former BBC Radio 2 drivetime shows, including &quot;Confessions&quot;, &quot;Tunesday&quot;, &quot;Nigel&#x27;s Recipes&quot; (Foodie Thursday, sponsored by Heinz), and &quot;All-Request Friday&quot;. Mayo is joined on the weekday drivetime show by Matt Williams, the show&#x27;s sports presenter, who previously had worked with him for some time on the Radio 2 drivetime show, during Mayo&#x27;s time presenting the show – another example of the show resembling its BBC Radio 2 format. He continues to present his &quot;Album Show&quot; on Sunday afternoons.

==Other work==

===BBC Radio 4===
Mayo presented &quot;Act Your Age&quot;, a panel game for BBC Radio 4, first broadcast on 27 November 2008.

In January 2024 Mayo was the guest on the Radio 4 programme &quot;Great Lives&quot;; his choice was Alan Freeman.

===Television projects===
Between 1995 and 1998 Mayo presented a TV version of &quot;Confessions&quot;, based on the hit feature from his BBC Radio 1 breakfast and mid-morning shows.

Starting in 1999 he was the original presenter of National Lottery game show &quot;Winning Lines&quot; on BBC One until 2000 when he was replaced by Phillip Schofield in 2001.

In 2005 he presented a series &quot;The Big Dig&quot; on BBC TV about allotments in the Rhondda Valley contrasted with others in Highgate, London.

Mayo hosted a revival of the classic quiz show &quot;Blockbusters&quot;, which began airing on Challenge on 14 May 2012 until 3 August 2012.

He was the announcer for the concert celebrating Queen Elizabeth II&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee on 4 June 2012.

===Podcast===
Following the end of the BBC Radio 5 Live show &quot;Kermode and Mayo&#x27;s Film Review&quot;, the pair started the podcast &quot;Kermode and Mayo&#x27;s Take&quot; in May 2022. In July 2018 Mayo, along with Matt Williams, began presenting a weekly podcast: &quot;Simon Mayo&#x27;s Books of the Year&quot;.

===Books===
&quot;Confessions&quot;, based on the hit feature from his BBC Radio 2 drivetime show, and his former BBC Radio 1 breakfast and mid-morning shows. was released in October 2011. The book is a compilation of the best confessions sent to the show by listeners.

Mayo&#x27;s debut novel, &quot;Itch&quot;, was released on 1 March 2012. The titular protagonist is a fourteen-year-old boy who discovers a previously unknown chemical element. &quot;The Guardian&quot; called it &#x27;a great and thrilling book with an easy to read storyline that will help kids to understand elements!&#x27; His second novel &quot;Itch Rocks&quot; was released in February 2013 and the third instalment, &quot;Itchcraft&quot;, came out in September 2014.

&quot;Itch&quot; and &quot;Itch Rocks&quot; were adapted into an opera, &quot;Itch,&quot; which premiered on 22 July 2023 at Opera Holland Park. It was commissioned by Opera Holland Park, and composed by Jonathan Dove with libretto by Alasdair Middleton.

His first young adult novel, &quot;Blame&quot;, was published in July 2016.

Mayo&#x27;s first novel for adults, &quot;Mad Blood Stirring&quot;, was published in April 2018 and received mixed reviews. It is a historical novel set in Dartmoor Prison in 1815. Clare Clarke, for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, said: &quot;With its huge, amorphous cast and little interior characterisation, its pages rich with Shakespeare’s poetry and the rousing gospel music for which Block 4 was reputedly renowned, the dialogue-heavy &quot;Mad Blood Stirring&quot; reads more like a first-draft film treatment than a finished novel. Mayo has served up all the ingredients he could find, but longer cooking would have given it greater depth and subtlety of flavour.&quot; The novelist John Boyne said: &quot;Bristling with energy, written with passion, &quot;Mad Blood Stirring&quot; is a joy to read.&quot;

In 2020 &quot;Knife Edge&quot;, a first thriller for Mayo, was published. Its setting is drawn from his experiences when an undergraduate at Warwick University, and the denouement is in the neighbouring city of Coventry. The book was promoted as a &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Top 10 bestseller. 

&quot;Tick Tock&quot;, a thriller based on a mysterious global illness, was published in 2022.

<text>Malaysian Malay () or Malaysian ()endonymically within Malaysia as Standard Malay () or simply Malay (, abbreviated to BM)is a standardized form of the Malay language used in Malaysia and also used in Brunei Darussalam and Singapore (as opposed to the variety used in Indonesia, which is referred to as the &quot;Indonesian&quot; language). Malaysian Malay is standardized from the Johor–Riau dialect of Malay, particularly a branch spoken in the state of Johor south of the Malay Peninsula. It is spoken by much of the Malaysian population, although most learn a vernacular Malay dialect or another native language first.

==Terminology==

=== In Malaysia ===
Article 152 of Malaysia&#x27;s Constitution as drafted in 1957 (revised in 1963) merely mentions &quot;Malay&quot; (&quot;Bahasa Melayu&quot;) as the designation of its &quot;national language&quot; without any further definition, but the term &quot;bahasa Malaysia&quot; () is used in official contexts from time to time. The latter term was endorsed by Tunku Abdul Rahman during his premiership.

The exact wording of either names above can be politically contentious. Between 1986 during Mahathir Mohamad&#x27;s tenure and 2007, the term &quot;bahasa Malaysia&quot; was replaced by &quot;bahasa Melayu&quot;; even in 1999 the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka rejected the publication of some short stories as the preface to the publication used the term &quot;bahasa Malaysia&quot; instead of &quot;bahasa Melayu&quot;. In 2007, to recognize that Malaysia is composed of many ethnic groups (and not only the ethnic Malays), the term &quot;bahasa Malaysia&quot; became the government&#x27;s preferred designation for the national language. Internally as of present since 2002, the affiliating Dewan Bahasa prefers the term &quot;bahasa Melayu&quot; in its literature as well as Ministry of Education&#x27;s syllabi (as of 2023); the latter ministry&#x27;s official communications used &quot;Bahasa Malaysia&quot; for a period of 2011 to 2015.

=== Other countries ===
In Singapore, &quot;Malay&quot; as an official language allocated in its constitution&#x27;s &quot;General Provisions&quot; (Part 13) is not defined in detail other than &quot;in the Roman script&quot;, the name as well as &quot;Bahasa Melayu&quot; is used continuously in its own educational literature; however, there is presumption that the standard &quot;Malay&quot; used by Singapore is the same as that utilised by the Malaysian government in contrast to the standard used by Indonesia (though with little differences in vocabulary).

The national standard variety of Malay employed in formal communications of Brunei dubbed &quot;Standard Brunei Malay&quot; (or internally &quot;Standard Malay&quot;) is observed to largely follow the Malaysian standard; the main differences being minor variation in pronunciation and some lexical influence from Brunei Malay, the local non-standard vernacular variety of Malay.

==Writing system==

The Latin alphabet, known in Malay as &quot;Rumi&quot; (Roman alphabet), is prescribed by law as the official script of Malaysian Malay, and the Arabic alphabet called Jawi (or Malay script) is not legally prescribed for that purpose. Rumi is official while efforts are currently being undertaken to preserve the Jawi script and to revive its use in Malaysia. The Latin alphabet, however, is still the most commonly used script in Malaysia, for both official and informal purposes.

==Borrowed words==

While literary Malay throughout the region has mostly absorbed from Sanskrit, Tamil, Hindustani (Hindi–Urdu), Arabic, Persian, Portuguese and Sinitic languages; the variety spoken within British colonies that eventually make up Malaysia following the 1824 Anglo-Dutch Treaty borrowed majorly from English (in particular many scientific and technological terms) compared to Dutch as spread within the East Indies.

Since Malayan independence and later Federation formation, its own Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka followed a purist approach in lexicography away from Western loanwords (even favouring established roots like Sanskrit and Arabic) as well as neologizing from native roots. In recent years, Malaysian has also been influenced lexically by the Indonesian variety largely through the popularity of neighbouring mass media like dramas, soap operas, and musicakin to the effect of American media towards other Englishes like those of Britain and Australia.

# Sanskrit: This language had a significant influence on the Malay language through trade and the spread of Hindu-Buddhist religions that arrived in the Malay Archipelago from the 1st to the 14th century. Borrowed words include &quot;bahasa&quot; (language), &quot;raja&quot; (king), &quot;syurga&quot; (heaven), &quot;neraka&quot; (hell), &quot;desa&quot; (village).
# Arabic: With the arrival of Islam in the region during the 7th century, Arabic began influencing the Malay language, especially in religious and philosophical terminology. Examples include &quot;kitab&quot; (book), &quot;masjid&quot; (mosque), &quot;ilmu&quot; (knowledge), &quot;iman&quot; (faith), &quot;zakat&quot; (almsgiving).
# Tamil: The influence of the Tamil language came primarily through maritime trade between India and the Malay Archipelago. Borrowed words from Tamil include &quot;kedai&quot; (shop), &quot;mangga&quot; (mango), and &quot;vadai&quot; (a type of snack).
# Chinese: Trade relations between Chinese merchants and the local population led to the borrowing of words such as &quot;tauhu&quot; (tofu), &quot;mi&quot; (noodles), &quot;lombong&quot; (mine).
# Portuguese: The Portuguese occupation of Malacca in the early 16th century introduced words like &quot;gereja&quot; (church), &quot;keju&quot; (cheese), &quot;jendela&quot; (window), and &quot;almari&quot; (cupboard).
# Dutch: Borrowing from Dutch occurred during the Dutch colonial period, including words like &quot;kabin&quot; (cabin), &quot;sekolah&quot; (school), &quot;kontrak&quot; (contract).
# English: The English language introduced many technical and modern words into Malay, especially during British colonial rule. Examples include &quot;telefon&quot; (telephone), &quot;komputer&quot; (computer), &quot;bank&quot;, &quot;internet&quot;, and &quot;stesen&quot; (station).

==Grammar==
==Colloquial and contemporary usage==
Colloquial and contemporary usage of Malay includes modern Malaysian vocabulary, which may not be familiar to the older generation, such as:
*&quot;Awek&quot; (means girl, in place of &quot;perempuan&quot;).
*&quot;Balak&quot; (means guy, in place of &quot;jantan&quot;).
*&quot;Cun&quot; (means pretty, in place of &quot;cantik / jelita&quot;).

New plural pronouns have also been formed out of the original pronouns popularly nowadays and the word &quot;orang&quot; (person), such as:
*&quot;Korang&quot; (&quot;kau&quot; + &quot;orang&quot;, &quot;you all&quot;, in place of &quot;kalian / kamu semua&quot;).
*&quot;Kitorang&quot; (&quot;kita&quot; + &quot;orang&quot;, the exclusive &quot;we&quot;, in place of &quot;kami&quot;).
*&quot;Diorang&quot; (&quot;dia&quot; + &quot;orang&quot;, the exclusive &quot;they&quot;, in place of &quot;mereka&quot;).

In addition, Arabic terms that is originally used in Standard Malay nowadays has been popularly changed where some of the words and pronunciations in the involved terms have been added by the local conservative Muslims by disputing the terms suggested by the &quot;Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka&quot; (DBP), claiming that the involved terms with implementation of the additional words and pronunciations is the real correct terms as same as stated in the Qur&#x27;an, where it is predominantly used by the local Muslim netizens in the social medias nowadays. The several involved terms in comparison to Standard Malay that is popularly used, such as:
*&quot;Ramadhan&quot; (means the holy fasting month, in place of &quot;Ramadan&quot;).
*&quot;Aamiin&quot; (means asking Allah (Islam) to verify the prayer (&quot;Du&#x27;a&quot;); real term is Ameen, in place of &quot;Amin&quot;).
*&quot;Fardhu&quot; (means obligatory (&quot;in Islam&quot;), in place of &quot;Fardu&quot;).
*&quot;Redha&quot; (means accepting, in place of &quot;Reda&quot;).
*&quot;Mudharat&quot; (means harm, in place of &quot;Mudarat&quot;).
*&quot;Dhaif&quot; (means poverty, in place of &quot;Daif&quot;).
*&quot;Zohor&quot; (means mid-day or noon time, in place of &quot;Zuhur&quot;).
*&quot;Hadith&quot; (means Prophet (Mohamed) terms or speeches, in place of &quot;Hadis&quot;).

Code-switching between English and Malaysian and the use of novel loanwords is widespread, forming Bahasa Rojak. Consequently, this phenomenon has raised the displeasure of linguistic purists in Malaysia, in their effort to uphold use of the prescribed standard language.

<doc id="1110600" wikidata="Q408658" url="?curid=1110600" title="Oxaloacetic acid">
<text>Oxaloacetic acid (also known as oxalacetic acid or OAA) is a crystalline organic compound with the chemical formula HO2CC(O)CH2CO2H. Oxaloacetic acid, in the form of its conjugate base oxaloacetate, is a metabolic intermediate in many processes that occur in animals. It takes part in gluconeogenesis, the urea cycle, the glyoxylate cycle, amino acid synthesis, fatty acid synthesis and the citric acid cycle.

==Properties==
Oxaloacetic acid undergoes successive deprotonations to give the dianion:
:HO2CC(O)CH2CO2H −O2CC(O)CH2CO2H + H+, pKa = 2.22
:−O2CC(O)CH2CO2H −O2CC(O)CH2CO2− + H+, pKa = 3.89

At high pH, the enolizable proton is ionized:
:−O2CC(O)CH2CO2− −O2CC(O−)CHCO2− + H+, pKa = 13.03

The enol forms of oxaloacetic acid are particularly stable. Keto-enol tautomerization is catalyzed by the enzyme oxaloacetate tautomerase. &quot;trans&quot;-Enol-oxaloacetate also appears when tartrate is the substrate for fumarase.

==Biosynthesis==
Oxaloacetate forms in several ways in nature. A principal route is upon oxidation of -malate, catalyzed by malate dehydrogenase, in the citric acid cycle. Malate is also oxidized by succinate dehydrogenase in a slow reaction with the initial product being enol-oxaloacetate. &lt;br&gt; 
It also arises from the condensation of pyruvate with carbonic acid, driven by the hydrolysis of ATP:
:CH3C(O)CO2− + HCO3− + ATP → −O2CCH2C(O)CO2− + ADP + Pi
Occurring in the mesophyll of plants, this process proceeds via phosphoenolpyruvate, catalysed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase. &lt;br&gt;Oxaloacetate can also arise from trans- or de- amination of aspartic acid.

==Biochemical functions==
Oxaloacetate is an intermediate of the citric acid cycle, where it reacts with acetyl-CoA to form citrate, catalyzed by citrate synthase. It is also involved in gluconeogenesis, the urea cycle, the glyoxylate cycle, amino acid synthesis, and fatty acid synthesis. Oxaloacetate is also a potent inhibitor of complex II.

===Gluconeogenesis===
Gluconeogenesis is a metabolic pathway consisting of a series of eleven enzyme-catalyzed reactions, resulting in the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrates substrates. The beginning of this process takes place in the mitochondrial matrix, where pyruvate molecules are found. A pyruvate molecule is carboxylated by a pyruvate carboxylase enzyme, activated by a molecule each of ATP and water. This reaction results in the formation of oxaloacetate. NADH reduces oxaloacetate to malate. This transformation is needed to transport the molecule out of the mitochondria. Once in the cytosol, malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate again using NAD+. Then oxaloacetate remains in the cytosol, where the rest of reactions will take place. Oxaloacetate is later decarboxylated and phosphorylated by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and becomes 2-phosphoenolpyruvate using guanosine triphosphate (GTP) as phosphate source. Glucose is obtained after further downstream processing.

===Urea cycle===
The urea cycle is a metabolic pathway that results in the formation of urea using one ammonium molecule from degraded amino acids, another ammonium group from aspartate and one bicarbonate molecule. This route commonly occurs in hepatocytes. The reactions related to the urea cycle produce NADH, and NADH can be produced in two different ways. One of these uses oxaloacetate. In the cytosol there are fumarate molecules. Fumarate can be transformed into malate by the actions of the enzyme fumarase. Malate is acted on by malate dehydrogenase to become oxaloacetate, producing a molecule of NADH. After that, oxaloacetate will be recycled to aspartate, as transaminases prefer these keto acids over the others. This recycling maintains the flow of nitrogen into the cell.
===Glyoxylate cycle===
The glyoxylate cycle is a variant of the citric acid cycle. It is an anabolic pathway occurring in plants and bacteria utilizing the enzymes isocitrate lyase and malate synthase. Some intermediate steps of the cycle are slightly different from the citric acid cycle; nevertheless oxaloacetate has the same function in both processes. This means that oxaloacetate in this cycle also acts as the primary reactant and final product. In fact the oxaloacetate is a net product of the glyoxylate cycle because its loop of the cycle incorporates two molecules of acetyl-CoA.

===Fatty acid synthesis===
In previous stages acetyl-CoA is transferred from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm where fatty acid synthase resides. The acetyl-CoA is transported as a citrate, which has been previously formed in the mitochondrial matrix from acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate. This reaction usually initiates the citric acid cycle, but when there is no need of energy it is transported to the cytoplasm where it is broken down to cytoplasmic acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate.

Another part of the cycle requires NADPH for the synthesis of fatty acids. Part of this reducing power is generated when the cytosolic oxaloacetate is returned to the mitochondria as long as the internal mitochondrial layer is non-permeable for oxaloacetate. Firstly the oxaloacetate is reduced to malate using NADH. Then the malate is decarboxylated to pyruvate. Now this pyruvate can easily enter the mitochondria, where it is carboxylated again to oxaloacetate by pyruvate carboxylase. In this way, the transfer of acetyl-CoA that is from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm produces a molecule of NADH. The overall reaction, which is spontaneous, may be summarized as:
:HCO3– + ATP + acetyl-CoA → ADP + Pi + malonyl-CoA

===Amino acid synthesis===
Six essential amino acids and three nonessential are synthesized from oxaloacetate and pyruvate. Aspartate and alanine are formed from oxaloacetate and pyruvate, respectively, by transamination from glutamate. Asparagine is synthesized by amidation of aspartate, with glutamine donating the NH4.
These are nonessential amino acids, and their simple biosynthetic pathways occur in all organisms. Methionine, threonine, lysine, isoleucine, valine, and leucine are essential amino acids in humans and most vertebrates. Their biosynthetic pathways in bacteria are complex and interconnected.
===Oxalate biosynthesis===
Oxaloacetate produces oxalate by hydrolysis.
:oxaloacetate + H2O oxalate + acetate
This process is catalyzed by the enzyme oxaloacetase. This enzyme is seen in plants, but is not known in the animal kingdom.

<text>Maroubra Force was the name given to the ad hoc Australian infantry force that defended Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea from the Japanese, and was involved in the Kokoda Track Campaign of the Pacific War, World War II. The force was established by the Allies under the codename &quot;Maroubra&quot;, referring to the troops in the forward area, it was one of many units forming the body of the New Guinea Force, the main Allied army formation in the South West Pacific Area during 1942.

Formed on 21 June 1942, it initially consisted of part-time Militia units and was under the command of Major General Basil Morris&#x27;s New Guinea Force. Reinforced by veteran Second Australian Imperial Force units, Maroubra Force was instrumental in blunting the Japanese advance on Port Moresby, fighting it to a standstill in September, before elements of the 7th Division undertook a counter-attack in October and November 1942, which drove the Japanese back to their beachheads around Buna–Gona, which was the scene of heavy fighting between November 1942 and January 1943.

==History==
In mid-1942, Major General Basil Morris, commander of New Guinea Force, ordered the 39th Infantry Battalion, which had previously been deployed as a garrison force around Port Moresby, sent overland via the Kokoda Track to secure the Kokoda area and prepare to defend against a Japanese advance. The Papuan Infantry Battalion of about 300 native troops with white officers, was already north of the Owen Stanley Range at the entrance of the Kokoda Track. These units were subsequently grouped together as &quot;Maroubra Force&quot; – named for Operation Maroubra, which was the Allied name for the troops in the &quot;forward area&quot; on the Kokoda Track – formed around the units of Brigadier Selwyn Porter&#x27;s 30th Brigade, which was made up of part-time Militia soldiers. On 21 July 1942, the Japanese landed on the northeast coast of Papua and the Papuan Infantry Battalion was overwhelmed by the Japanese troops, and the entrance was captured on 29 July 1942.

Bolstered by the arrival of the 53rd Infantry Battalion in early August, Maroubra Force then successfully fought to delay the Japanese advance through the Owen Stanley Range, before being reinforced by Second Australian Imperial Force troops from the 21st Brigade and finally halting the Japanese around Ioribaiwa. The 25th Brigade, later reinforced by the 16th Brigade, then pursued the Japanese north from Ioribaiwa as the Japanese withdrew back to their beachheads at Buna, Gona and Sanananda on the Papuan north coast. Within sources dealing with the fighting in New Guinea, Maroubra Force remains an enigmatic entity. While authors such as Eustace Keogh, Brune and McCarthy largely fall silent on the formation after the Battle of Ioribaiwa in mid-September, Chant states that Maroubra Force later participated in the fighting around Gona. Nevertheless, the last mention of the Maroubra codename in the New Guinea Force Headquarters War Diary appears on 28 October.

During the fighting around Buna and Gona, between November 1942 and January 1943, Porter&#x27;s 30th Brigade, which had been withdrawn earlier, reinforced elements of the 7th Division – the 18th and 25th Brigades – and eventually took part in the reduction of the Japanese beachhead there. The 21st Brigade also took part in the fighting around the Japanese beachheads, suffering heavy casualties.

==Commanders==
An ad hoc command, Maroubra Force was variously commanded by the senior officer in the forward area of the battle, which meant that command changed hands on a number of occasions. Major (later Lieutenant Colonel) Allan Cameron took command of the formation during the fighting around Kokoda after the death of Lieutenant Colonel William Owen, while Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner filled the role during the brief period between Kokoda and Isurava. Brigadier Selwyn Porter (30th Brigade) and Brigadier Arnold Potts (21st Brigade) also held the position. Potts was later relieved of his command in controversial circumstances following actions at Isurava, Eora Creek and Templeton&#x27;s Crossing, and Efogi. He was replaced by Porter in early September prior to the Battle of Ioribaiwa. Maroubra Force then passed to Brigadier Kenneth Eather, commander of the 25th Brigade, for the fighting around Ioribaiwa and the counter-offensive that followed.

==Strength and casualties==
According to Chant, &quot;at its peak strength, Maroubra Force consisted of the 39th and 53rd Infantry Battalions, and the 21st Brigade (2/14th, 2/16th and 2/27th Infantry Battalions). The 53rd Militia Battalion saw action briefly during the Battle of Isurava but was defeated and subsequently withdrew greatly demoralised, especially after the commanding officer and many senior officers of the 53rd were killed in action&quot;. Williams provides a contrasting assessment, though, stating that just prior the fighting around Ioribaiwa, following the arrival of the 25th Brigade, Maroubra Force totaled 2,957 personnel – up from 2,292 at the start of Isurava – with a combined headquarters from both the 21st and 25th Brigades, the 25th Brigade&#x27;s three infantry battalions, a composite 21st Brigade infantry battalion, and various supporting elements including a signals detachment, medical support and a small reconnaissance element. These forces lacked artillery support, as the Australians&#x27; limited artillery resources were concentrated around Port Moresby at the start of the campaign, and due to logistical issues they were unable to move the guns forward along the track to support the infantry in the forward areas.

The fighting around Kokoda and Buna–Gona resulted in heavy casualties for Maroubra Force. According to James, the fighting along the Kokoda Track left over 600 Australians dead with more than 1,600 wounded over a four-month period for the total force engaged (not just Maroubra Force); there were further casualties around Buna and Gona also. The example of the 39th Infantry Battalion highlights the intensity of the fighting. By the end of the fighting in January 1943, according to Chant, the 39th Battalion had been so heavily depleted there were only 30 fully fit personnel available from a nominal strength of between 600 and 800. The remainder were either &quot;dead, missing, wounded, or in hospitals in Port Moresby and northern Australia suffering from disease and exhaustion&quot;. It was subsequently evacuated to Port Moresby before returning to Australia, where the 30th Brigade was eventually disbanded, with many of its personnel being redistributed to 2nd AIF units. Maroubra Force, and its commanding officers Honner and Potts are sometimes cited as some of &quot;the men who saved Australia&quot;, having played an important part in the successful defence of Port Moresby.

<text>Hijacking Catastrophe: 9/11, Fear &amp; the Selling of American Empire is a 2004 documentary film narrated by Julian Bond and directed by Jeremy Earp and Sut Jhally. It examines the possibility that neoconservatives used the September 11 attacks to usher in a new doctrine of expanding American power through military force under the guise of a &quot;war on terror&quot; and that the doctrine, known as the Project for the New American Century (PNAC), had been laid out prior to 9/11 by its authors, which include Dick Cheney, Paul Wolfowitz, Donald Rumsfeld, Jeb Bush, and Dan Quayle.

==Summary==
The film maintains that fear of terrorism was manipulated to support goals which are in step with the PNAC; namely the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Not just for control of regional strategic resources (natural gas and oil), but to reassert American dominance on the world stage as a warning to potential adversaries. Interviews were conducted with critics such as Noam Chomsky and Nobel Peace Prize laureate Jody Williams. It also interviews policy analysts, military brass, journalists, insider observations from Chief UN Weapons Inspector Scott Ritter and Pentagon whistleblower Lt. Colonel Karen Kwiatkowski.

The historical context of the &quot;Bush Doctrine&quot; is examined and compared to Wolfowitz&#x27;s PNAC philosophy. The film goes on to look at the &quot;selling of American empire&quot; and the possible economical, social, cultural and political implications it will have in America, and on the world if implemented further during Bush&#x27;s second term.

<text>Bacteria biooxidation is an oxidation process caused by microbes where the valuable metal remains (but becomes enriched) in the solid phase. In this process, the metal remains in the solid phase and the liquid can be discarded.
Bacterial oxidation is a biohydrometallurgical process developed for pre-cyanidation treatment of refractory gold ores or concentrates. The bacterial culture is a mixed culture of &quot;Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans&quot;, &quot;Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans&quot; and &quot;Leptospirillum ferrooxidans&quot;. The bacterial oxidation process comprises contacting refractory sulfide ROM ore or concentrate with a strain of the bacterial culture for a suitable treatment period under an optimum operating environment. The bacteria oxidise the sulfide minerals, thus liberating the occluded gold for subsequent recovery via cyanidation.

The BIOX® process is a proprietary technology owned by Biomin South Africa and used under licence by a number of operating mines. The BIOX® process involves bacterial oxidation in agitated tanks for pre-treatment of refractory ores and concentrates ahead of conventional cyanide leach for gold recovery.

Under controlled continuous plant conditions, the number of bacterial cells and their activity is optimised to attain the highest rate of sulfide oxidation. The bacteria require a very acidic environment (pH 1.0 to 4.0), a temperature of between 30 and 45 °C, and a steady supply of oxygen and carbon dioxide for optimum growth and activity. The unusual operating conditions for the bacteria are not favourable for the growth of most other microbes, thus eliminating the need for sterility during the bacterial oxidation process. Because organic substances are toxic to the bacteria, they are non-pathogenic and incapable of causing disease. The bacteria employed in the process do not, therefore, pose a health risk to humans or any animals.

The bacterial oxidation of iron sulfide minerals produces iron(III) sulfate and sulfuric acid, and in the case of arsenopyrite, arsenic acid is also produced. The arsenic is removed from the liquor by coprecipitation with the iron and sulfate in a two-stage neutralisation process. This produces a solid neutralisation precipitate containing largely calcium sulfate, basic iron(III) arsenate and iron(III) hydroxide. The iron(III) arsenate is sufficiently insoluble and stable to allow the neutralisation product to be safely disposed of on a slimes dam. The neutralisation liquor, purified to contain an acceptable level of arsenic, can be re-used in the milling, flotation or bacterial oxidation circuits.

<text>A model building code is a building code that is developed and maintained by a standards organization independent of the jurisdiction responsible for enacting the building code. A local government can choose to adopt a model building code as its own. This saves local governments the expense and trouble of developing their own codes. Many smaller governments lack the expertise to do so.

==Overview==

The concept of the &quot;model building codes&quot; has successfully been applied since the early 1900s in the countries where regulation of building construction is a responsibility of the local authorities. The popularity of model building codes can be attributed to two factors: (a) the developing of proprietary building codes is prohibitively expensive and (b) the ability of the model codes to accommodate local conditions. Since modern building regulations are very complex, their development and effective maintenance are far beyond the technical and financial capabilities of most jurisdictions. Rather than drafting its own building codes, a local authority might choose to use the model building codes instead. The model building codes are either adopted (accepted without modifications) or adapted (modified) to a particular jurisdiction and then enforced by the adopting authority.

Model building codes are developed by standards organizations through a network of development committees with representatives from the various affected entities, both government and private. This method allows the pooling of financial and intellectual resources to produce codes that remain current and technically sound. The model code developers are constantly working to update their codes to incorporate latest research results and building technologies.

The model code developers are generally funded by the sales of the model codes, the reprint royalties, and the consulting services they may offer to the adopting authorities and code users.

==Application==
===European Union and Canada===

===United States===

In the United States, model building codes are adopted by the state governments, counties, fire districts, and municipalities. A number of federal agencies—including the U.S. Department of Defense, the National Park Service, the Department of State and the Forest Service—use private-sector model codes for projects funded by the federal government.

Normally, model building codes have a 3–5 year update cycle. That is, a new edition of the building code comes out every 3 to 5 years. However, due to the length of time that it takes for a jurisdiction to review and approve a new code, the currently enforced version of the local code is often not the most recent edition of the model building code on which the adopted code is based.

Also, when any given jurisdiction adopts a model building code, it adopts a specific edition of the model code (for example, the 1997 Uniform Building Code or the 2006 International Building Code), which then becomes the law of that jurisdiction. As a result of this practice, the adopted codes are not automatically updated. When a new edition of the model code is released by the model code developer, the adopting authority may choose to ignore it and continue using the older version of the model code it adopted. Otherwise, the jurisdiction must vote to update its code and bring its inspectors up to date on the changes being made to the code. Most jurisdictions update their codes regularly to avoid backlash from architects and building contractors who respond to outdated codes by seeking variances to permit the use of more efficient design solutions and technologies accepted in areas using more modern codes.

The model codes may either be adopted outright as the building codes for a jurisdiction, or they may be adopted with amendments or additional rules. In some cases, the amendments or additional requirements and exemptions are issued as a separate document or, in other cases, the jurisdiction may print, under its own title, a merged code, incorporating all of the local revisions. For example, the City of Los Angeles 2011 Building Code is based on the 2009 International Building Code, which is a model code developed by the International Code Council (ICC).

In the wake of the 2002 case &quot;Veeck v. Southern Building Code Congress Int&#x27;l, Inc.&quot;, the organization Public Resource has published a substantial portion of the enacted building codes on-line, and they are available as .pdf&#x27;s which are freely downloadable. The &quot;Veeck&quot; case has had the effect of placing the text of the adopted model codes into the public domain, although the model codes themselves, until they are adopted into law, are not in the public domain.

Some model building codes commonly used in the United States:
* &quot;International Building Code&quot; by the International Code Council
* &quot;NFPA 5000&quot; by the National Fire Protection Association
* &quot;National Electrical Code&quot; by the National Fire Protection Association

<text>Muscle contraction is the activation of tension-generating sites within muscle cells. In physiology, muscle contraction does not necessarily mean muscle shortening because muscle tension can be produced without changes in muscle length, such as when holding something heavy in the same position. The termination of muscle contraction is followed by muscle relaxation, which is a return of the muscle fibers to their low tension-generating state.

For the contractions to happen, the muscle cells must rely on the change in action of two types of filaments: thin and thick filaments.

The major constituent of thin filaments is a chain formed by helical coiling of two strands of actin, and thick filaments dominantly consist of chains of the motor-protein myosin. Together, these two filaments form myofibrils - the basic functional organelles in the skeletal muscle system.

In vertebrates, skeletal muscle contractions are neurogenic as they require synaptic input from motor neurons. A single motor neuron is able to innervate multiple muscle fibers, thereby causing the fibers to contract at the same time. Once innervated, the protein filaments within each skeletal muscle fiber slide past each other to produce a contraction, which is explained by the sliding filament theory. The contraction produced can be described as a twitch, summation, or tetanus, depending on the frequency of action potentials. In skeletal muscles, muscle tension is at its greatest when the muscle is stretched to an intermediate length as described by the length-tension relationship.

Unlike skeletal muscle, the contractions of smooth and cardiac muscles are myogenic (meaning that they are initiated by the smooth or heart muscle cells themselves instead of being stimulated by an outside event such as nerve stimulation), although they can be modulated by stimuli from the autonomic nervous system. The mechanisms of contraction in these muscle tissues are similar to those in skeletal muscle tissues.

Muscle contraction can also be described in terms of two variables: length and tension. In natural movements that underlie locomotor activity, muscle contractions are multifaceted as they are able to produce changes in length and tension in a time-varying manner. Therefore, neither length nor tension is likely to remain the same in skeletal muscles that contract during locomotion. Contractions can be described as isometric if the muscle tension changes but the muscle length remains the same. In contrast, a muscle contraction is described as isotonic if muscle tension remains the same throughout the contraction. If the muscle length shortens, the contraction is concentric; if the muscle length lengthens, the contraction is eccentric.

==Types==

Muscle contractions can be described based on two variables: force and length. Force itself can be differentiated as either tension or load. Muscle tension is the force exerted by the muscle on an object whereas a load is the force exerted by an object on the muscle. When muscle tension changes without any corresponding changes in muscle length, the muscle contraction is described as isometric. If the muscle length changes while muscle tension remains the same, then the muscle contraction is isotonic. In an isotonic contraction, the muscle length can either shorten to produce a concentric contraction or lengthen to produce an eccentric contraction. In natural movements that underlie locomotor activity, muscle contractions are multifaceted as they are able to produce changes in length and tension in a time-varying manner. Therefore, neither length nor tension is likely to remain constant when the muscle is active during locomotor activity.

=== Isometric contraction ===

An isometric contraction of a muscle generates tension without changing length. An example can be found when the muscles of the hand and forearm grip an object; the joints of the hand do not move, but muscles generate sufficient force to prevent the object from being dropped.

=== Isotonic contraction ===
In isotonic contraction, the tension in the muscle remains constant despite a change in muscle length. This occurs when a muscle&#x27;s force of contraction matches the total load on the muscle.

==== Concentric contraction ====
In concentric contraction, muscle tension is sufficient to overcome the load, and the muscle shortens as it contracts. This occurs when the force generated by the muscle exceeds the load opposing its contraction.

During a concentric contraction, a muscle is stimulated to contract according to the sliding filament theory. This occurs throughout the length of the muscle, generating a force at the origin and insertion, causing the muscle to shorten and changing the angle of the joint. In relation to the elbow, a concentric contraction of the biceps would cause the arm to bend at the elbow as the hand moved from the leg to the shoulder (a biceps curl). A concentric contraction of the triceps would change the angle of the joint in the opposite direction, straightening the arm and moving the hand towards the leg.

==== Eccentric contraction ====

In eccentric contraction, the tension generated while isometric is insufficient to overcome the external load on the muscle and the muscle fibers lengthen as they contract. Rather than working to pull a joint in the direction of the muscle contraction, the muscle acts to decelerate the joint at the end of a movement or otherwise control the repositioning of a load. This can occur involuntarily (e.g., when attempting to move a weight too heavy for the muscle to lift) or voluntarily (e.g., when the muscle is &#x27;smoothing out&#x27; a movement or resisting gravity such as during downhill walking). Over the short-term, strength training involving both eccentric and concentric contractions appear to increase muscular strength more than training with concentric contractions alone. However, exercise-induced muscle damage is also greater during lengthening contractions.

During an eccentric contraction of the biceps muscle, the elbow starts the movement while bent and then straightens as the hand moves away from the shoulder. During an eccentric contraction of the triceps muscle, the elbow starts the movement straight and then bends as the hand moves towards the shoulder. Desmin, titin, and other z-line proteins are involved in eccentric contractions, but their mechanism is poorly understood in comparison to cross-bridge cycling in concentric contractions.

Though the muscle is doing a negative amount of mechanical work, (work is being done &quot;on&quot; the muscle), chemical energy (of fat or glucose, or temporarily stored in ATP) is nevertheless consumed, although less than would be consumed during a concentric contraction of the same force. For example, one expends more energy going up a flight of stairs than going down the same flight.

Muscles undergoing heavy eccentric loading suffer greater damage when overloaded (such as during muscle building or strength training exercise) as compared to concentric loading. When eccentric contractions are used in weight training, they are normally called &quot;negatives&quot;. During a concentric contraction, contractile muscle myofilaments of myosin and actin slide past each other, pulling the Z-lines together. During an eccentric contraction, the myofilaments slide past each other the opposite way, though the actual movement of the myosin heads during an eccentric contraction is not known. Exercise featuring a heavy eccentric load can actually support a greater weight (muscles are approximately 40% stronger during eccentric contractions than during concentric contractions) and also results in greater muscular damage and delayed onset muscle soreness one to two days after training. Exercise that incorporates both eccentric and concentric muscular contractions (i.e., involving a strong contraction and a controlled lowering of the weight) can produce greater gains in strength than concentric contractions alone. While unaccustomed heavy eccentric contractions can easily lead to overtraining, moderate training may confer protection against injury.

===== Eccentric contractions in movement =====
Eccentric contractions normally occur as a braking force in opposition to a concentric contraction to protect joints from damage. During virtually any routine movement, eccentric contractions assist in keeping motions smooth, but can also slow rapid movements such as a punch or throw. Part of training for rapid movements such as pitching during baseball involves reducing eccentric braking allowing a greater power to be developed throughout the movement.

Eccentric contractions are being researched for their ability to speed rehabilitation of weak or injured tendons. Achilles tendinitis and patellar tendonitis (also known as jumper&#x27;s knee or patellar tendonosis) have been shown to benefit from high-load eccentric contractions.

==Vertebrate==

In vertebrate animals, there are three types of muscle tissues: skeletal, smooth, and cardiac. Skeletal muscle constitutes the majority of muscle mass in the body and is responsible for locomotor activity. Smooth muscle forms blood vessels, the gastrointestinal tract, and other areas in the body that produce sustained contractions. Cardiac muscle makes up the heart, which pumps blood. Skeletal and cardiac muscles are called striated muscle because of their striped appearance under a microscope, which is due to the highly organized alternating pattern of A bands and I bands.

===Skeletal muscle===

Excluding reflexes, all skeletal muscle contractions occur as a result of signals originating in the brain. The brain sends electrochemical signals through the nervous system to the motor neuron that innervates several muscle fibers. In the case of some reflexes, the signal to contract can originate in the spinal cord through a feedback loop with the grey matter. Other actions such as locomotion, breathing, and chewing have a reflex aspect to them: the contractions can be initiated either consciously or unconsciously.

====Neuromuscular junction====

A neuromuscular junction is a chemical synapse formed by the contact between a motor neuron and a muscle fiber. It is the site in which a motor neuron transmits a signal to a muscle fiber to initiate muscle contraction. The sequence of events that results in the depolarization of the muscle fiber at the neuromuscular junction begins when an action potential is initiated in the cell body of a motor neuron, which is then propagated by saltatory conduction along its axon toward the neuromuscular junction. Once it reaches the terminal bouton, the action potential causes a ion influx into the terminal by way of the voltage-gated calcium channels. The influx causes synaptic vesicles containing the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to fuse with the plasma membrane, releasing acetylcholine into the synaptic cleft between the motor neuron terminal and the neuromuscular junction of the skeletal muscle fiber. Acetylcholine diffuses across the synapse and binds to and activates nicotinic acetylcholine receptors on the neuromuscular junction. Activation of the nicotinic receptor opens its intrinsic sodium/potassium channel, causing sodium to rush in and potassium to trickle out. As a result, the sarcolemma reverses polarity and its voltage quickly jumps from the resting membrane potential of -90mV to as high as +75mV as sodium enters. The membrane potential then becomes hyperpolarized when potassium exits and is then adjusted back to the resting membrane potential. This rapid fluctuation is called the end-plate potential. The voltage-gated ion channels of the sarcolemma next to the end plate open in response to the end plate potential. They are sodium and potassium specific and only allow one through. This wave of ion movements creates the action potential that spreads from the motor end plate in all directions. If action potentials stop arriving, then acetylcholine ceases to be released from the terminal bouton. The remaining acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft is either degraded by active acetylcholine esterase or reabsorbed by the synaptic knob and none is left to replace the degraded acetylcholine.

====Excitation–contraction coupling====
Excitation–contraction coupling (ECC) is the process by which a muscular action potential in the muscle fiber causes myofibrils to contract. In skeletal muscles, excitation–contraction coupling relies on a direct coupling between two key proteins, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) calcium release channel identified as the ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR1) and the voltage-gated L-type calcium channel identified as dihydropyridine receptors, (DHPRs). DHPRs are located on the sarcolemma (which includes the surface sarcolemma and the transverse tubules), while the RyRs reside across the SR membrane. The close apposition of a transverse tubule and two SR regions containing RyRs is described as a triad and is predominantly where excitation–contraction coupling takes place.

Excitation–contraction coupling (ECC) occurs when depolarization of skeletal muscles (usually through neural innervation) results in a muscle action potential. This action potential spreads across the muscle&#x27;s surface and into the muscle fiber&#x27;s network of T-tubules, depolarizing the inner portion of the muscle fiber. This activates dihydropyridine receptors in the terminal cisternae, which are in close proximity to ryanodine receptors in the adjacent sarcoplasmic reticulum. The activated dihydropyridine receptors physically interact with ryanodine receptors to activate them via foot processes (involving conformational changes that allosterically activates the ryanodine receptors). As ryanodine receptors open, Ca2+ is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the local junctional space and diffuses into the bulk cytoplasm to cause a calcium spark. The action potential creates a near synchronous activation of thousands of calcium sparks and causes a cell-wide increase in calcium giving rise to the upstroke of the calcium transient. The Ca2+ released into the cytosol binds to Troponin C by the actin filaments. This bond allows the actin filaments to perform cross-bridge cycling, producing force and, in some situations, motion.

When the desired motion is accomplished, relaxation can be achieved quickly through numerous pathways. Relaxation is quickly achieved through a Ca2+ buffer with various cytoplasmic proteins binding to Ca2+ with very high affinity. These cytoplasmic proteins allow for quick relaxation in fast twitch muscles. Although slower, the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum calcium-ATPase (SERCA) actively pumps Ca2+ back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum, resulting in a permanent relaxation until the next action potential arrives.

Mitochondria also participate in Ca2+ reuptake, ultimately delivering their gathered Ca2+ to SERCA for storage in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. A few of the relaxation mechanisms (NCX, Ca2+ pumps and Ca2+ leak channels) move Ca2+ completely out of the cells as well. As Ca2+ concentration declines to resting levels, Ca2+ releases from Troponin C, disallowing cross bridge-cycling, causing the force to decline and relaxation to occur. Once relaxation has fully occurred, the muscle is able to contract again, thus fully resetting the cycle.

====Sliding filament theory====

The sliding filament theory describes a process used by muscles to contract. It is a cycle of repetitive events that cause a thin filament to slide over a thick filament and generate tension in the muscle. It was independently developed by Andrew Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke and by Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson in 1954. Physiologically, this contraction is not uniform across the sarcomere; the central position of the thick filaments becomes unstable and can shift during contraction but this is countered by the actions of the elastic myofilament of titin. This fine myofilament maintains uniform tension across the sarcomere by pulling the thick filament into a central position.

=====Cross-bridge cycle=====

Cross-bridge cycling is a sequence of molecular events that underlies the sliding filament theory. A cross-bridge is a myosin projection, consisting of two myosin heads, that extends from the thick filaments. Each myosin head has two binding sites: one for adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and another for actin. The binding of ATP to a myosin head detaches myosin from actin, thereby allowing myosin to bind to another actin molecule. Once attached, the ATP is hydrolyzed by myosin, which uses the released energy to move into the &quot;cocked position&quot; whereby it binds weakly to a part of the actin binding site. The remainder of the actin binding site is blocked by tropomyosin. With the ATP hydrolyzed, the cocked myosin head now contains adenosine diphosphate (ADP) + Pi. Two ions bind to troponin C on the actin filaments. The troponin- complex causes tropomyosin to slide over and unblock the remainder of the actin binding site. Unblocking the rest of the actin binding sites allows the two myosin heads to close and myosin to bind strongly to actin. The myosin head then releases the inorganic phosphate and initiates a &quot;power stroke,&quot; which generates a force of 2 pN. The power stroke moves the actin filament inwards, thereby shortening the sarcomere. Myosin then releases ADP but still remains tightly bound to actin. At the end of the power stroke, ADP is released from the myosin head, leaving myosin attached to actin in a rigor state until another ATP binds to myosin. A lack of ATP would result in the rigor state characteristic of rigor mortis. Once another ATP binds to myosin, the myosin head will again detach from actin and another cross-bridge cycle occurs.

Cross-bridge cycling is able to continue as long as there are sufficient amounts of ATP and in the cytoplasm. Termination of cross-bridge cycling can occur when is actively pumped back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. When is no longer present on the thin filament, the tropomyosin changes conformation back to its previous state so as to block the binding sites again. The myosin ceases binding to the thin filament, and the muscle relaxes. The ions leave the troponin molecule to maintain the ion concentration in the sarcoplasm. The active pumping of ions into the sarcoplasmic reticulum creates a deficiency in the fluid around the myofibrils. This causes the removal of ions from the troponin. Thus, the tropomyosin-troponin complex again covers the binding sites on the actin filaments and contraction ceases.

====Gradation of skeletal muscle contractions====

The strength of skeletal muscle contractions can be broadly separated into twitch, summation, and tetanus. A twitch is a single contraction and relaxation cycle produced by an action potential within the muscle fiber itself. The time between a stimulus to the motor nerve and the subsequent contraction of the innervated muscle is called the latent period, which usually takes about 10 ms and is caused by the time taken for nerve action potential to propagate, the time for chemical transmission at the neuromuscular junction, then the subsequent steps in excitation-contraction coupling.

If another muscle action potential were to be produced before the complete relaxation of a muscle twitch, then the next twitch will simply sum onto the previous twitch, thereby producing a &quot;summation&quot;. Summation can be achieved in two ways: &quot;frequency summation&quot; and &quot;multiple fiber summation&quot;. In frequency summation, the force exerted by the skeletal muscle is controlled by varying the frequency at which action potentials are sent to muscle fibers. Action potentials do not arrive at muscles synchronously, and, during a contraction, some fraction of the fibers in the muscle will be firing at any given time. In a typical circumstance, when humans are exerting their muscles as hard as they are consciously able, roughly one-third of the fibers in each of those muscles will fire at once, though this ratio can be affected by various physiological and psychological factors (including Golgi tendon organs and Renshaw cells). This &#x27;low&#x27; level of contraction is a protective mechanism to prevent avulsion of the tendon—the force generated by a 95% contraction of all fibers is sufficient to damage the body. In multiple fiber summation, if the central nervous system sends a weak signal to contract a muscle, the smaller motor units, being more excitable than the larger ones, are stimulated first. As the strength of the signal increases, more motor units are excited in addition to larger ones, with the largest motor units having as much as 50 times the contractile strength as the smaller ones. As more and larger motor units are activated, the force of muscle contraction becomes progressively stronger. A concept known as the size principle, allows for a gradation of muscle force during weak contraction to occur in small steps, which then become progressively larger when greater amounts of force are required.

Finally, if the frequency of muscle action potentials increases such that the muscle contraction reaches its peak force and plateaus at this level, then the contraction is a &quot;tetanus&quot;.

====Length-tension relationship====

Length-tension relationship relates the strength of an isometric contraction to the length of the muscle at which the contraction occurs. Muscles operate with greatest active tension when close to an ideal length (often their resting length). When stretched or shortened beyond this (whether due to the action of the muscle itself or by an outside force), the maximum active tension generated decreases. This decrease is minimal for small deviations, but the tension drops off rapidly as the length deviates further from the ideal. Due to the presence of elastic proteins within a muscle cell (such as titin) and extracellular matrix, as the muscle is stretched beyond a given length, there is an entirely passive tension, which opposes lengthening. Combined, there is a strong resistance to lengthening an active muscle far beyond the peak of active tension.

====Force-velocity relationships====

Force–velocity relationship relates the speed at which a muscle changes its length (usually regulated by external forces, such as load or other muscles) to the amount of force that it generates. Force declines in a hyperbolic fashion relative to the isometric force as the shortening velocity increases, eventually reaching zero at some maximum velocity. The reverse holds true for when the muscle is stretched – force increases above isometric maximum, until finally reaching an absolute maximum. This intrinsic property of active muscle tissue plays a role in the active damping of joints that are actuated by simultaneously active opposing muscles. In such cases, the force-velocity profile enhances the force produced by the lengthening muscle at the expense of the shortening muscle. This favoring of whichever muscle returns the joint to equilibrium effectively increases the damping of the joint. Moreover, the strength of the damping increases with muscle force. The motor system can thus actively control joint damping via the simultaneous contraction (co-contraction) of opposing muscle groups.

===Smooth muscle===

Smooth muscles can be divided into two subgroups: single-unit and multiunit. Single-unit smooth muscle cells can be found in the gut and blood vessels. Because these cells are linked together by gap junctions, they are able to contract as a functional syncytium. Single-unit smooth muscle cells contract myogenically, which can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system.

Unlike single-unit smooth muscle cells, multiunit smooth muscle cells are found in the muscle of the eye and in the base of hair follicles. Multiunit smooth muscle cells contract by being separately stimulated by nerves of the autonomic nervous system. As such, they allow for fine control and gradual responses, much like motor unit recruitment in skeletal muscle.

====Mechanisms of smooth muscle contraction====

The contractile activity of smooth muscle cells can be tonic (sustained) or phasic (transient) and is influenced by multiple inputs such as spontaneous electrical activity, neural and hormonal inputs, local changes in chemical composition, and stretch. This is in contrast to the contractile activity of skeletal muscle cells, which relies on a single neural input. Some types of smooth muscle cells are able to generate their own action potentials spontaneously, which usually occur following a pacemaker potential or a slow wave potential. These action potentials are generated by the influx of extracellular , and not . Like skeletal muscles, cytosolic ions are also required for crossbridge cycling in smooth muscle cells.

The two sources for cytosolic in smooth muscle cells are the extracellular entering through calcium channels and the ions that are released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The elevation of cytosolic results in more binding to calmodulin, which then binds and activates myosin light-chain kinase. The calcium-calmodulin-myosin light-chain kinase complex phosphorylates myosin on the 20 kilodalton (kDa) myosin light chains on amino acid residue-serine 19, enabling the molecular interaction of myosin and actin, and initiating contraction and activating the myosin ATPase. Unlike skeletal muscle cells, smooth muscle cells lack troponin, even though they contain the thin filament protein tropomyosin and other notable proteins – caldesmon and calponin. Thus, smooth muscle contractions are initiated by the -activated phosphorylation of myosin rather than binding to the troponin complex that regulates myosin binding sites on actin like in skeletal and cardiac muscles.

Termination of crossbridge cycling (and leaving the muscle in latch-state) occurs when myosin light chain phosphatase removes the phosphate groups from the myosin heads. Phosphorylation of the 20 kDa myosin light chains correlates well with the shortening velocity of smooth muscle. During this period, there is a rapid burst of energy use as measured by oxygen consumption. Within a few minutes of initiation, the calcium level markedly decreases, the 20 kDa myosin light chains&#x27; phosphorylation decreases, and energy use decreases; however, force in tonic smooth muscle is maintained. During contraction of muscle, rapidly cycling crossbridges form between activated actin and phosphorylated myosin, generating force. It is hypothesized that the maintenance of force results from dephosphorylated &quot;latch-bridges&quot; that slowly cycle and maintain force. A number of kinases such as rho kinase, DAPK3, and protein kinase C are believed to participate in the sustained phase of contraction, and flux may be significant.

====Neuromodulation====
Although smooth muscle contractions are myogenic, the rate and strength of their contractions can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system. Postganglionic nerve fibers of parasympathetic nervous system release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, which binds to muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) on smooth muscle cells. These receptors are metabotropic, or G-protein coupled receptors that initiate a second messenger cascade. Conversely, postganglionic nerve fibers of the sympathetic nervous system release the neurotransmitters epinephrine and norepinephrine, which bind to adrenergic receptors that are also metabotropic. The exact effects on the smooth muscle depend on the specific characteristics of the receptor activated—both parasympathetic input and sympathetic input can be either excitatory (contractile) or inhibitory (relaxing).

===Cardiac muscle===

There are two types of cardiac muscle cells: autorhythmic and contractile. Autorhythmic cells do not contract, but instead set the pace of contraction for other cardiac muscle cells, which can be modulated by the autonomic nervous system. In contrast, contractile muscle cells (cardiomyocytes) constitute the majority of the heart muscle and are able to contract.

====Excitation-contraction coupling====
In both skeletal and cardiac muscle excitation-contraction (E-C) coupling, depolarization conduction and Ca2+ release processes occur. However, though the proteins involved are similar, they are distinct in structure and regulation. The dihydropyridine receptors (DHPRs) are encoded by different genes, and the ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are distinct isoforms. Besides, DHPR contacts with RyR1 (main RyR isoform in skeletal muscle) to regulate Ca2+ release in skeletal muscle, while the L-type calcium channel (DHPR on cardiac myocytes) and RyR2 (main RyR isoform in cardiac muscle) are not physically coupled in cardiac muscle, but face with each other by a junctional coupling.

Unlike skeletal muscle, E-C coupling in cardiac muscle is thought to depend primarily on a mechanism called calcium-induced calcium release, which is based on the junctional structure between T-tubule and sarcoplasmic reticulum. Junctophilin-2 (JPH2) is essential to maintain this structure, as well as the integrity of T-tubule. Another protein, receptor accessory protein 5 (REEP5), functions to keep the normal morphology of junctional SR. Defects of junctional coupling can result from deficiencies of either of the two proteins. During the process of calcium-induced calcium release, RyR2s are activated by a calcium trigger, which is brought about by the flow of Ca2+ through the L-type calcium channels. After this, cardiac muscle tends to exhibit diad structures, rather than triads.

Excitation-contraction coupling in cardiac muscle cells occurs when an action potential is initiated by pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial node or atrioventricular node and conducted to all cells in the heart via gap junctions. The action potential travels along the surface membrane into T-tubules (the latter are not seen in all cardiac cell types) and the depolarisation causes extracellular to enter the cell via L-type calcium channels and possibly sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) during the early part of the plateau phase. Although this Ca2+ influx only count for about 10% of the Ca2+ needed for activation, it is relatively larger than that of skeletal muscle. This influx causes a small local increase in intracellular . The increase of intracellular is detected by RyR2 in the membrane of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which releases in a positive feedback physiological response. This positive feedback is known as calcium-induced calcium release and gives rise to calcium sparks ( sparks). The spatial and temporal summation of ~30,000 sparks gives a cell-wide increase in cytoplasmic calcium concentration. The increase in cytosolic calcium following the flow of calcium through the cell membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum is moderated by calcium buffers, which bind a large proportion of intracellular calcium. As a result, a large increase in total calcium leads to a relatively small rise in free .

The cytoplasmic calcium binds to Troponin C, moving the tropomyosin complex off the actin binding site allowing the myosin head to bind to the actin filament. From this point on, the contractile mechanism is essentially the same as for skeletal muscle (above). Briefly, using ATP hydrolysis, the myosin head pulls the actin filament toward the centre of the sarcomere.

Following systole, intracellular calcium is taken up by the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum ATPase (SERCA) pump back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum ready for the next cycle to begin. Calcium is also ejected from the cell mainly by the sodium-calcium exchanger (NCX) and, to a lesser extent, a plasma membrane calcium ATPase. Some calcium is also taken up by the mitochondria. An enzyme, phospholamban, serves as a brake for SERCA. At low heart rates, phospholamban is active and slows down the activity of the ATPase so that does not have to leave the cell entirely. At high heart rates, phospholamban is phosphorylated and deactivated thus taking most from the cytoplasm back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Once again, calcium buffers moderate this fall in concentration, permitting a relatively small decrease in free concentration in response to a large change in total calcium. The falling concentration allows the troponin complex to dissociate from the actin filament thereby ending contraction. The heart relaxes, allowing the ventricles to fill with blood and begin the cardiac cycle again.

==Invertebrate==
===Circular and longitudinal muscles===

In annelids such as earthworms and leeches, circular and longitudinal muscles cells form the body wall of these animals and are responsible for their movement. In an earthworm that is moving through a soil, for example, contractions of circular and longitudinal muscles occur reciprocally while the coelomic fluid serves as a hydroskeleton by maintaining turgidity of the earthworm. When the circular muscles in the anterior segments contract, the anterior portion of animal&#x27;s body begins to constrict radially, which pushes the incompressible coelomic fluid forward and increasing the length of the animal. As a result, the front end of the animal moves forward. As the front end of the earthworm becomes anchored and the circular muscles in the anterior segments become relaxed, a wave of longitudinal muscle contractions passes backwards, which pulls the rest of animal&#x27;s trailing body forward. These alternating waves of circular and longitudinal contractions is called peristalsis, which underlies the creeping movement of earthworms.

===Obliquely striated muscles===

Invertebrates such as annelids, mollusks, and nematodes, possess obliquely striated muscles, which contain bands of thick and thin filaments that are arranged helically rather than transversely, like in vertebrate skeletal or cardiac muscles. In bivalves, the obliquely striated muscles can maintain tension over long periods without using too much energy. Bivalves use these muscles to keep their shells closed.

===Asynchronous muscles===
Advanced insects such as wasps, flies, bees, and beetles possess asynchronous muscles that constitute the flight muscles in these animals. These flight muscles are often called &quot;fibrillar muscles&quot; because they contain myofibrils that are thick and conspicuous. A remarkable feature of these muscles is that they do not require stimulation for each muscle contraction. Hence, they are called &quot;asynchronous muscles&quot; because the number of contractions in these muscles do not correspond (or synchronize) with the number of action potentials. For example, a wing muscle of a tethered fly may receive action potentials at a frequency of 3 Hz but it is able to beat at a frequency of 120 Hz. The high frequency beating is made possible because the muscles are connected to a resonant system, which is driven to a natural frequency of vibration.

==History==

In 1780, Luigi Galvani discovered that the muscles of dead frogs&#x27; legs twitched when struck by an electrical spark. This was one of the first forays into the study of bioelectricity, a field that still studies the electrical patterns and signals in tissues such as nerves and muscles.

In 1952, the term excitation–contraction coupling was coined to describe the physiological process of converting an electrical stimulus to a mechanical response. This process is fundamental to muscle physiology, whereby the electrical stimulus is usually an action potential and the mechanical response is contraction. Excitation–contraction coupling can be dysregulated in many diseases. Though excitation–contraction coupling has been known for over half a century, it is still an active area of biomedical research. The general scheme is that an action potential arrives to depolarize the cell membrane. By mechanisms specific to the muscle type, this depolarization results in an increase in cytosolic calcium that is called a calcium transient. This increase in calcium activates calcium-sensitive contractile proteins that then use ATP to cause cell shortening.

The mechanism for muscle contraction evaded scientists for years and requires continued research and updating. The sliding filament theory was independently developed by Andrew F. Huxley and Rolf Niedergerke and by Hugh Huxley and Jean Hanson. Their findings were published as two consecutive papers published in the 22 May 1954 issue of &quot;Nature&quot; under the common theme &quot;Structural Changes in Muscle During Contraction&quot;.

<text>Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison () is a 1975 book by French philosopher Michel Foucault. It is an analysis of the social and theoretical mechanisms behind the changes that occurred in Western penal systems during the modern age based on historical documents from France. Foucault argues that prison did not become the principal form of punishment just because of the humanitarian concerns of reformists. He traces the cultural shifts that led to the predominance of prison via the body and power. Prison is used by the &quot;disciplines&quot; – new technological powers that can also be found, according to Foucault, in places such as schools, hospitals, and military barracks.

==Summary==
The main ideas of &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; can be grouped according to its four parts: torture, punishment, discipline, and prison.

===Torture===
Foucault begins by contrasting two forms of penalty: the violent and chaotic public torture of Robert-François Damiens, who was convicted of attempted regicide in the mid-18th century, and the highly regimented daily schedule for inmates from an early 19th-century prison (Mettray). These examples provide a picture of just how profound the changes in Western penal systems were after less than a century.
Foucault wants the reader to consider what led to these changes and how Western attitudes shifted so radically.

He believes that the question of the nature of these changes is best asked by assuming that they were not used to create a more humanitarian penal system, nor to more exactly punish or rehabilitate, but as part of a continuing trajectory of subjection. Foucault wants to tie scientific knowledge and technological development to the development of the prison to prove this point. He defines a &quot;micro-physics&quot; of power, which is constituted by a power that is strategic and tactical rather than acquired, preserved or possessed. He explains that power and knowledge imply one another, as opposed to the common belief that knowledge exists independently of power relations (knowledge is always contextualized in a framework which makes it intelligible, so the humanizing discourse of psychiatry is an expression of the tactics of oppression). That is, the ground of the game of power is not won by &quot;liberation&quot;, because liberation already exists as a facet of subjection. &quot;The man described for us, whom we are invited to free, is already in himself the effect of a subjection much more profound than himself.&quot; The problem for Foucault is in some sense a theoretical modelling which posits a soul, an identity (the use of soul being fortunate since &quot;identity&quot; or &quot;name&quot; would not properly express the method of subjection—e.g., if mere materiality were used as a way of tracking individuals then the method of punishment would not have switched from torture to psychiatry) which allows a whole materiality of prison to develop. In &quot;What is an Author?&quot; Foucault also deals with notion of identity, and its use as a method of control, regulation, and tracking.

He begins by examining public torture and execution. He argues that the public spectacle of torture and execution was a theatrical forum, the original intentions of which eventually produced several unintended consequences. Foucault stresses the exactitude with which torture is carried out, and describes an extensive legal framework in which it operates to achieve specific purposes. Foucault describes public torture as a ceremony.

The intended purposes were:

* To make the secret public (according to Foucault, the investigation was kept entirely secret even from the accused). The secret of the investigation and the conclusion of the magistrates was justified by the publicity of the torture.
* To show the effect of investigation on confession. (According to Foucault, torture could occur during the investigation, because partial proofs meant partial guilt. If the torture failed to elicit a confession then the investigation was stopped and innocence assumed. A confession legitimized the investigation and any torture that occurred.)
* Reflecting the violence of the original crime onto the convict&#x27;s body for all to see, in order for it to be manifested then annulled by reciprocating the violence of the crime on the criminal.
* Enacting the revenge upon the convict&#x27;s body, which the monarch seeks for having been injured by the crime. Foucault argues that the law was considered an extension of the sovereign&#x27;s body, and so the revenge must take the form of harming the convict&#x27;s body.

&quot;It [torture] assured the articulation of the written on the oral, the secret on the public, the procedure of investigation on the operation of the confession; it made it possible to reproduce the crime on the visible body of the criminal; in the same horror, the crime had to be manifested and annulled. It also made the body of the condemned man the place where the vengeance of the sovereign was applied, the anchoring point for a manifestation of power, an opportunity of affirming the dissymmetry of forces.&quot;

Foucault looks at public torture as the outcome &quot;of a certain mechanism of power&quot; that views crime in a military schema. Crime and rebellion are akin to a declaration of war. The sovereign was not concerned with demonstrating the ground for the enforcement of its laws, but of identifying enemies and attacking them, the power of which was renewed by the ritual of investigation and the ceremony of public torture.

Some unintended consequences were:

* Providing a forum for the convict&#x27;s body to become a focus of sympathy and admiration.
* Redistributing blame: the executioner rather than the convict becomes the locus of shame.
* Creating a site of conflict between the masses and the sovereign at the convict&#x27;s body. Foucault notes that public executions often led to riots in support of the prisoner. Frustration for the inefficiency of this economy of power could be directed towards and coalesce around the site of torture and execution.

Public torture and execution was a method the sovereign deployed to express his or her power, and it did so through the ritual of investigation and the ceremony of execution—the reality and horror of which was supposed to express the omnipotence of the sovereign but actually revealed that the sovereign&#x27;s power depended on the participation of the people. Torture was made public in order to create fear in the people, and to force them to participate in the method of control by agreeing with its verdicts. But problems arose in cases in which the people through their actions disagreed with the sovereign, by heroizing the victim (admiring the courage in facing death) or in moving to physically free the criminal or to redistribute the effects of the strategically deployed power. Thus, he argues, the public execution was ultimately an ineffective use of the body, qualified as non-economical. As well, it was applied non-uniformly and haphazardly. Hence, its political cost was too high. It was the antithesis of the more modern concerns of the state: order and generalization. So it had to be reformed to allow for greater stability of property for the bourgeoisie.

===Punishment===
Firstly, the switch to prison was not immediate and sudden. There was a more graded change, though it ran its course rapidly. Prison was preceded by a different form of public spectacle. The theater of public torture gave way to public chain gangs. Punishment became &quot;gentle&quot;, though not for humanitarian reasons, Foucault suggests. He argues that reformists were unhappy with the unpredictable, unevenly distributed nature of the violence the sovereign would inflict on the convict. The sovereign&#x27;s right to punish was so disproportionate that it was ineffective and uncontrolled. Reformists felt the power to punish and judge should become more evenly distributed, the state&#x27;s power must be a form of public power. This, according to Foucault, was of more concern to reformists than humanitarian arguments.

Out of this movement towards generalized punishment, a thousand &quot;mini-theatres&quot; of punishment would have been created wherein the convicts&#x27; bodies would have been put on display in a more ubiquitous, controlled, and effective spectacle. Prisoners would have been forced to do work that reflected their crime, thus repaying society for their infractions. This would have allowed the public to see the convicts&#x27; bodies enacting their punishment, and thus to reflect on the crime. But these experiments lasted less than twenty years.

Foucault argues that this theory of &quot;gentle&quot; punishment represented the first step away from the excessive force of the sovereign, and towards more generalized and controlled means of punishment. But he suggests that the shift towards prison that followed was the result of a new &quot;technology&quot; and ontology for the body being developed in the 18th century, the &quot;technology&quot; of discipline, and the ontology of &quot;man as machine.&quot;

===Discipline===
The emergence of prison as the form of punishment for every crime grew out of the development of discipline in the 18th and 19th centuries, according to Foucault. He looks at the development of highly refined forms of discipline, of discipline concerned with the smallest and most precise aspects of a person&#x27;s body. Discipline, he suggests, developed a new economy and politics for bodies. Modern institutions required that bodies must be individuated according to their tasks, as well as for training, observation, and control. Therefore, he argues, discipline created a whole new form of individuality for bodies, which enabled them to perform their duty within the new forms of economic, political, and military organizations emerging in the modern age and continuing to today.

The individuality that discipline constructs (for the bodies it controls) has four characteristics, namely it makes individuality which is:
* Cellular—determining the spatial distribution of the bodies
* Organic—ensuring that the activities required of the bodies are &quot;natural&quot; for them
* Genetic—controlling the evolution over time of the activities of the bodies
* Combinatory—allowing for the combination of the force of many bodies into a single massive force

Foucault suggests this individuality can be implemented in systems that are officially egalitarian, but use discipline to construct non-egalitarian power relations:

:&quot;Historically, the process by which the bourgeoisie became in the course of the eighteenth century the politically dominant class was masked by the establishment of an explicit, coded and formally egalitarian juridical framework, made possible by the organization of a parliamentary, representative regime. But the development and generalization of disciplinary mechanisms constituted the other, dark side of these processes. The general juridical form that guaranteed a system of rights that were egalitarian in principle was supported by these tiny, everyday, physical mechanisms, by all those systems of micro-power that are essentially non-egalitarian and asymmetrical that we call the disciplines.&quot;

Foucault&#x27;s argument is that discipline creates &quot;docile bodies&quot;, ideal for the new economics, politics and warfare of the modern industrial age – bodies that function in factories, ordered military regiments, and school classrooms. But, to construct docile bodies the disciplinary institutions must be able to constantly observe and record the bodies they control and ensure the internalization of the disciplinary individuality within the bodies being controlled. That is, discipline must come about without excessive force through careful observation, and molding of the bodies into the correct form through this observation. This requires a particular form of institution, exemplified, Foucault argues, by Jeremy Bentham&#x27;s panopticon. This architectural model, though it was never adopted by architects according to Bentham&#x27;s exact blueprint, becomes an important conceptualization of power relations for prison reformers of the 19th century, and its general principle is a recurring theme in modern prison construction.

The panopticon was the ultimate realization of a modern disciplinary institution. It allowed for constant observation characterized by an &quot;unequal gaze&quot;; the constant possibility of observation. Perhaps the most important feature of the panopticon was that it was specifically designed so that the prisoner could never be sure whether they were being observed at any moment. The unequal gaze caused the internalization of disciplinary individuality, and the docile body required of its inmates. This means one is less likely to break rules or laws if they believe they are being watched, even if they are not. Thus, prisons, and specifically those that follow the model of the panopticon, provide the ideal form of modern punishment. Foucault argues that this is why the generalized, &quot;gentle&quot; punishment of public work gangs gave way to the prison. It was the ideal modernization of punishment, so its eventual dominance was natural.

Having laid out the emergence of the prison as the dominant form of punishment, Foucault devotes the rest of the book to examining its precise form and function in society, laying bare the reasons for its continued use, and questioning the assumed results of its use.

===Prison===
In examining the construction of the prison as the central means of criminal punishment, Foucault builds a case for the idea that prison became part of a larger &quot;carceral system&quot; that has become an all-encompassing sovereign institution in modern society. Prison is one part of a vast network, including schools, military institutions, hospitals, and factories, which build a panoptic society for its members. This system creates &quot;disciplinary careers&quot; for those locked within its corridors. It is operated under the scientific authority of medicine, psychology, and criminology. Moreover, it operates according to principles that ensure that it &quot;cannot fail to produce delinquents.&quot; Delinquency, indeed, is produced when social petty crime (such as taking wood from the lord&#x27;s lands) is no longer tolerated, creating a class of specialized &quot;delinquents&quot; acting as the police&#x27;s proxy in surveillance of society.

The structures Foucault chooses to use as his starting positions help highlight his conclusions. In particular, his choice as a perfect prison of the penal institution at Mettray helps personify the carceral system. Within it is included the Prison, the School, the Church, and the work-house (industry) – all of which feature heavily in his argument. The prisons at Neufchatel and Mettray were perfect examples for Foucault, because they, even in their original state, began to show the traits for which Foucault was searching. Moreover, they showed the body of knowledge being developed about the prisoners, the creation of the &quot;delinquent&quot; class, and the disciplinary careers emerging.

==Reception==
The publication of the book was &quot;widely noted in major French cultural venues&quot; of the time such as &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; and &quot;Le Monde&quot;. After its publication in English in 1977 it was &quot;widely reviewed in non-academic venues&quot;, however scholarly reviews were &quot;far less common&quot;.

The historian Peter Gay described &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; as the key text by Foucault that has influenced scholarship on the theory and practice of 19th-century prisons. Though Gay wrote that Foucault &quot;breathed fresh air into the history of penology and severely damaged, without wholly discrediting, traditional Whig optimism about the humanization of penitentiaries as one long success story&quot;, he nevertheless gave a negative assessment of Foucault&#x27;s work, endorsing the critical view of Gordon Wright in his 1983 book &quot;Between the Guillotine and Liberty: Two Centuries of the Crime Problem in France&quot;. Gay concluded that Foucault and his followers overstate the extent to which keeping &quot;the masses quiet&quot; motivates those in power, thereby underestimating factors such as &quot;contingency, complexity, the sheer anxiety or stupidity of power holders&quot;, or their authentic idealism.

Law Professor David Garland wrote an explication and critique of &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;. Towards the end, he sums up the main critiques that have been made. He states, &quot;the major critical theme which emerges, and is independently made by many different critics, concerns Foucault&#x27;s overestimation of the political dimension. &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot; consistently proposes an explanation in terms of power—sometimes in the absence of any supporting evidence—where other historians would see a need for other factors and considerations to be brought into account.&quot;

Another criticism leveled against Foucault&#x27;s approach is that he often studies the discourse of &quot;prisons&quot; rather than their concrete practice; this is taken up by Fred Alford: &quot;Foucault has mistaken the idea of prison, as reflected in the discourse of criminologists, for its practice. More precisely put, Foucault presents the utopian ideals of eighteenth-century prison reformers, most of which were never realized, as though they were the actual reforms of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. One can see this even in the pictures in &quot;Discipline and Punish&quot;, many of which are drawings for ideal prisons that were never built. One photograph is of the panopticon prison buildings at Stateville, but it is evidently an old photograph, one in which no inmates are evident. Nor are the blankets and cardboard that now enclose the cells.&quot;

<doc id="1110636" wikidata="Q4329724" url="?curid=1110636" title="Education in Burkina Faso">
<text>Education in [[Burkina Faso]] is structured in much the same way as in the rest of the world: primary, secondary, and higher education. As of 2008, despite efforts to improve education, the country had the lowest adult literacy rate in the world (25.3%).

The Human Rights Measurement Initiative (HRMI) finds that Burkina Faso is fulfilling only 61.2% of what it should be fulfilling for the right to education based on the country&#x27;s level of income. HRMI breaks down the right to education by looking at the rights to both primary education and secondary education. While taking into consideration Burkina Faso&#x27;s income level, the nation is achieving 78.0% of what should be possible based on its resources (income) for primary education but only 44.3% for secondary education.
==Primary and secondary==
The Education Act makes schooling compulsory from age 6 to 16. The official language for education is French.

By law, education is free, but the government does not have adequate resources to provide universal free primary education. Children are required to pay for school supplies, and communities are frequently responsible for constructing primary school buildings and teachers’ housing. Children from poor families can continue to receive tuition-free education through junior high and high school, if their grades qualify. 

In 2002, the gross primary enrollment rate was 46 percent, and the net primary enrollment rate was 36 percent. Gross and net enrollment ratios are based on the number of students formally registered in primary school and therefore do not necessarily reflect actual school attendance. In 1998, 26.5 percent of children ages 6 to 14 years were attending school. As of 2001, 66 percent of children who started primary school were likely to reach grade 5.

School conditions are usually reasonable with very basic equipment. Legally the size limit for one class is 65 students, but in many rural areas classes are much bigger because of the lack of schools. If a school is full, children may get turned away and will have to try again the next year.

There is an International School of Ouagadougou open to foreign nationals and Burkinabè.

===School session===
A week runs from Monday to Saturday, with the schools closed on Thursday. Burkina Faso has a national curriculum. The subjects taught include Production, where children may learn to plant maize and trees or keep chickens, on school land. They have a break between noon and 3pm.

==Higher education==

As of 2010 there were three main public universities in Burkina Faso: The Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso, the University of Koudougou and the University of Ouagadougou. The first private higher education institution was established in 1992 and the Université Libre de Ouagadougou began operations in 2000. The Université Catholique de l&#x27;Afrique de l&#x27;Ouest opened its Burkina campus in Bobo-Dioulasso in 2000 with a food and agriculture speciality, and the Catholic in 2004 in Ouagadougou. Supervision rates are different from one university to another. At the University of Ouagadougou there is one lecturer for every 24 students, while at The Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso they have one lecturer for every three students.

Higher education provision is highly centralized in Ouagadougou. In 2010/2011 the University of Ouagadougou had around 40,000 students (83% of the national population of university students), the University of Koudougou had 5,600 students, and the Polytechnic University of Bobo-Dioulasso had 2,600. The private universities each had less than 1,000 students. 

The University of Ouagadougou closed its doors for two months in 2008, following student protests about working conditions and non-payment of their grants. One outcome was the creation of University of Ouagadougou II 20km away at Saaba, to relieve pressure on overcrowded facilities. It now teaches the law, politics, economics and management students formerly at the main campus and students receive University of Ouagadougou degrees. There are also online classes through the Institut de Formation Ouverte à Distance (IFOAD).

In 2014, University of Ouagadougou received funding from OPEC for new facilities. None of the country&#x27;s universities are ranked in higher education listings like the Time Higher World Universities, probably because the language of instruction is French, lecturers do not have time for much research, there is reliance on international aid to support some aspects of public education, and class sizes at the main public university are large. Nonetheless, there are opportunities to study right through to doctoral level. 

===Administration===
The University Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso are composed of five levels of decision making: the board of directors, the university assembly, the university council, institutions, and departments.

==Influencing factors==
* The number of actual schools (for primary)
* A shortage of qualified instructors (for higher education)
* Families have to pay for school supplies and school fees
* Families have very low income
* Sending a child (or children) to school limits the money being earned for the family
* Many families are only able to send one child to school, leaving the others to earn money for the family. They usually send the oldest able male.
* Language barrier. Education is mainly conducted in French, which only 15% of Burkinabè can speak, rather than in first languages of the country.

<doc id="1110641" wikidata="Q838502" url="?curid=1110641" title="Douche and Turd">
<text>&quot;Douche and Turd&quot; is the eighth episode of the eighth season of the animated television series &quot;South Park&quot;, and the 119th episode overall. Written by series co-creator Trey Parker, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on October 27, 2004, shortly before the 2004 U.S. presidential election, which the episode satirizes.

The episode follows South Park Elementary holding an election to determine the new mascot for the school. The two candidates—a Giant Douche and a Turd Sandwich―are respectively suggested by Kyle and Cartman, and each purports that their nominee is superior to the other. Stan, who sees the election as pointless, refuses to vote and is consequently exiled from South Park.

==Plot==
During a pep rally at South Park Elementary, demonstrators for PETA protest the use of a cow as the school&#x27;s mascot. As a result, South Park Elementary has to adopt a new mascot, for which the students are told to vote. Embarrassed by the bland choices, Kyle Broflovski jokingly suggests that one of the choices be a &quot;giant douche&quot;, while Eric Cartman instead suggests a &quot;turd sandwich&quot;. Eventually, the two joke candidates get the most votes, so an election is scheduled to be held. Kyle and Cartman aggressively promote their respective candidates, using bribery and fear mongering to gain support.

Stan Marsh does not see the point in the choice between a giant douche and a turd sandwich and declares his refusal to vote. Stan tells his family about it at dinner, but his parents stress the importance of voting to Stan and argue over who he should vote for. Kyle, meanwhile, informs Sean &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs, who, along with his entourage, intimidates Stan with threats to shoot him dead. Stan agrees to vote in response to the threats, but when he is about to vote for Turd Sandwich, Kyle demands Stan to vote for Giant Douche instead. Disgusted with everyone&#x27;s actions, Stan again refuses to vote. The school administration decides that Stan must be exiled from town until he realizes the importance of voting. Stan is publicly shamed by the townspeople, bound with a bucket over his head, and placed on a horse, which leaves the town to roam while carrying Stan.

Stan and the horse are eventually approached by PETA members, who lead them to their compound. Stan finds that the compound&#x27;s inhabitants live closely with the animals, practicing bestality and interbreeding with them. Stan explains his banishment to the PETA members, who explain to him that an election is always between a &quot;douche&quot; and a &quot;turd&quot; because they are the only candidates who adulate enough to get that far in politics. Combs appears to kill Stan, but is distracted by a PETA member who stains his fur coat. Combs and his entourage retaliate by murdering all the PETA members, while sparing the animals. Stan is wounded by a stray bullet but manages to escape.

Returning to South Park, Stan is finally convinced to vote and casts a ballot for Turd Sandwich. Despite his vote, Giant Douche still wins the election, 1,410 to 36. Stan incredulously points out that his vote did not matter, but Randy and Sharon tell him that all votes matter, even if it is for the losing candidate. Mr. Garrison arrives at school and alerts everyone of the PETA members&#x27; murders. As a result, the cow is reinstated as the school mascot. Randy tells Stan that &quot;now&quot; his vote did not matter, leaving the latter irritated and feeling that the election was indeed pointless.

==Reception and release==
&quot;Slate&quot; described the episode as being &quot;the epitome of everything great about the show&quot;. &quot;Douche and Turd&quot;, along with the thirteen other episodes from &quot;South Park&quot;″s eighth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 29, 2006. The set includes brief audio commentaries by series co-creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone for each episode.

== Politics ==
According to Nick Gillespie of &quot;Reason&quot; magazine, this episode &quot;pretty much sums up how most libertarians approach politics&quot;. Douche and Turd are used again in the season 20 episode &quot;Member Berries&quot; and subsequent episodes of the season, in which they refer to Donald Trump (represented by Mr. Garrison) and Hillary Clinton, respectively, in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The episode has been used to demonstrate the near-zero value of an individual vote, the intrinsic value individuals place on the act of voting itself, problems arising when voters must choose amongst undesirable candidates rather than issues, and the role of political campaigning.

<doc id="1110651" wikidata="Q436951" url="?curid=1110651" title="Diego Walsh">
<text>Diego Costa Bastos Walsh (born 8 December 1979) is a Brazilian footballer who last played for TOT S.C. in the Thai Premier League.

==Career==

===Youth and College===
While growing up in Brazil, Diego played in the youth system of Santos FC, before moving to Miami, Florida at the age of 14. He played club soccer for Miami Strike Force, and was a major part of a talented team which won 5 consecutive state championships, 2 regional championships, and finished second in the National Championship.

Diego turned down numerous other university scholarships to play four years of college soccer for Southern Methodist University, from 1999 to 2002, on a full scholarship. In both his junior and senior years, Diego was a NSCAA first team All-American. He is also currently SMU&#x27;s all-time leader in assists, with 39, and ranks fifth in goals, also with 39. He was later named in the NSCAA &quot;Team of the Decade,&quot; in 2010.

===Professional===
Upon graduating, Diego was drafted seventh overall in the 2003 MLS SuperDraft by the Columbus Crew. Walsh did not garner much time with the Crew, although playing extremely well when he was given the opportunity earning Columbus Crew Goal of the Year for 2003. He was traded at the end of the season to the Kansas City Wizards.

Although Diego started the season with a starting role in the Wizards&#x27; offense because of an injury to Preki, Diego did not fit into the Kansas City style of play. He was released by Kansas City Wizards during the 2005 season. After a brief stint with Real Salt Lake in the 2006 pre-season, he was released again, and played for Miami FC along with Brazilian superstar Romario where the pair helped the team make it to the USL playoffs in its first year in the league.

Diego joined Adelaide United in the Australian A-League during the 2006/2007 season after impressive displays during two Miami FC friendlies in Adelaide, which were organised by former Adelaide United chairman Mel Patzwald who facilitated both the Romario transfer as well as the sister relationship between both clubs and was instrumental in the Adelaide United Brazilian connection. which also netted United former World Player of the Year Romario. Diego was recommended to Adelaide by Romario himself, who regarded him highly as a player.

He debuted impressively against Sydney FC on 14 January 2007, with an assist to Fernando for an 88th-minute winner. During his second season with Adelaide United, he established himself as an excellent defensive and central midfielder, not only for Adelaide but in the whole A-League, and was regarded by his teammates as the outstanding player of the 2008 Asian Champions League campaign. He was the team&#x27;s top goal scorer with 4 goals helping Adelaide United reach the 2008 Asian Champions League final for the first time. Adelaide United ended up losing the final to Gamba Osaka of Japan.

In a shock decision for Adelaide fans, Diego was released by the club on 20 January 2009. Adelaide coach Aurelio Vidmar cited Diego&#x27;s 19 starts out of a possible 41 in two seasons, as a key factor in the decision. &quot;He missed 50 per cent of the games due to injury – hamstrings, quads and back,&quot; said Vidmar. He was signed up by the Wellington Phoenix, on a two-year contract and became a firm favorite with the Wellington Phoenix supporter&#x27;s group Yellow Fever.

On 20 May 2011 it was announced that he had signed a temporary contract with Charleston Battery. On 6 July 2011 it was announced in the Thai media that Diego had taken up a contract with Thai Premier League team TOT S.C.

He is currently an assistant coach at NCAA D1 program Grand Canyon University.

<text>Luis Aquilino Gonzalez (born July 14, 1980) is an American soccer coach and former player who was recently the head coach of San Jose Earthquakes in MLS.

==Youth and college==
Gonzalez was born in Hialeah, Florida, to a Peruvian father and an American mother.

Gonzalez represented the United States U17s at the 1997 FIFA U-17 World Championship making 3 appearances in their group stage exit.
He played four years of college soccer at Southern Methodist University, emerging in 2001, his senior season, to win the Hermann Trophy as college soccer&#x27;s best player. He had 128 points during his career, including 48 goals and 32 assists.

==Playing career==
Upon graduating, Gonzalez was drafted 6th overall in the 2002 MLS SuperDraft by the San Jose Earthquakes. Gonzalez failed to make a mark with the Earthquakes, however, playing only 47 minutes in his rookie season. In the offseason he was acquired by the Columbus Crew and made the roster, but could not agree to a deal.

He left the United States for Sweden, where he signed with second-division club Bodens BK. Gonzalez scored 8 goals and had 4 assists in his first season in Europe; along with Leighton O&#x27;Brien, Gonzalez was one of the most respected players in the squad. He left Boden in late October 2003. 
Gonzalez joined Peruvian Sporting Cristal, where he was acquired to be a backup striker. Gonzalez appeared in the prestigious Copa Libertadores tournament, playing against the likes of Boca Juniors during his time.

Gonzalez came back to MLS in 2005. He signed with the Colorado Rapids, but following the 2006 season he was waived. He signed for Miami FC in 2007.

==Coaching career==

In December 2018, Gonzalez was named Head Coach of FC Dallas in MLS, earning a promotion from his academy director role. Gonzalez has adopted a style of play dubbed &#x27;Luchi Ball&#x27; by fans, emphasizing possession and counter-pressing.

Gonzalez coached Dallas to playoff appearances in 2019 and 2020. On September 19, 2021, he was fired by FC Dallas after missing the playoffs.

On December 4, 2021, Gonzalez was appointed assistant coach of the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team. 

On August 17, 2022, it was announced that Gonzalez would take over as head coach of the San Jose Earthquakes prior to the start of the 2023 Major League Soccer season. He would officially join the club following the conclusion of the 2022 FIFA World Cup.

Gonzalez qualified his team to the playoffs in his first season, but the Earthquakes were eliminated by Sporting Kansas City on penalties in the first edition of the Wild-card round as part of the new playoff format. However, in 2024, he was only able to coach his team to three wins in their first 19 matches and a placement at the bottom of the league table, and Gonzalez was fired on June 24.

<doc id="1110664" wikidata="Q6971140" url="?curid=1110664" title="National Building Code of Canada">
<text>The National Building Code of Canada is the model building code of Canada. It is issued by the National Research Council of Canada. As a model code, it has no legal status until it is adopted by a jurisdiction that regulates construction.

==History==
The Constitution of Canada includes the regulation of building construction as a provincial responsibility. In a few cases, municipalities have been given the historic right of writing their own building code. In the early years of regulating building construction, this caused a patchwork of building codes across Canada.

In 1941, the federal government of Canada published the first National Building Code. This was adopted by the various provinces and municipalities in Canada during the next 20 years.

On 1 August 1947, the Division of Building Research, later named the Institute for Research in Construction (NRC-IRC) and today known as NRC Construction Research Centre, was established to provide a research service to the construction industry and to help ensure affordable and safe housing for a growing population of Canadians. Its founding head was Robert Legget. The new organization was also given the mandate to lead the development of the National Building Code of Canada. Since then, NRC&#x27;s Construction Research Centre has grown to encompass emergent areas of research in support of the Canadian construction sector. Early photographs of activities are available in the archives.

The Northern Research Program was housed at the Division of Building Research over the period from 1950 to 1986, and information gleaned from the Building Materials Section in York Redoubt made its way into the Code.

Since 1960, there has been a revised document about every five years up to 1995. The 2000 edition of the building code was supposed to be an objective or performance-based building. However, this took considerably longer to write than foreseen and the next edition of the National Building Code of Canada was not published until 2005. The 2010 National Model Construction Codes was published on 29 November 2010. and the National Building Code of Canada 2010 incorporates energy efficiency requirements.

The first National Farm Building Code of Canada (NFBC) was first published in 1960. The Model National Energy Codes for Buildings and Houses were first published in 1997.

The Historical National Construction Codes on-line in PDF format is a single collection provided by the NRC of the English and French editions of all Code documents published between 1941 and 1998.

On behalf of the Canadian Commission on Building and Fire Codes (CCBFC) the National Research Council (NRC) Canadian Codes Center publishes national model codes documents that set out minimum requirements relating to their scope and objectives. These include the National Building Code, the National Fire Code, the National Plumbing Code, the National Energy Code of Canada for Buildings (NECB) and other documents. The Canadian Standards Association (CSA) publishes other model codes that address electrical, gas and elevator systems.

Requirements on the specification of structural wood products and wood building systems is set forth in the National Building Code which is concerned with health, safety, accessibility and the protection of buildings from fire or structural damage. The Code applies mainly to new construction, but also aspects of demolition, relocation, renovation and change of building use. The current NBCC was published in 2015, and is usually updated on a five-year cycle. The next update began in 2020. While final public review of proposed changes to the 2015 edition ran from January 13-March 13, 2020, completion was delayed due to covid-19; reportedly the updated edition will be published in December 2021.

==Implementation==
The National Building Code is the model building code that forms the basis for all of the provincial building codes. Some jurisdictions create their own code based on the National Building Code, other jurisdictions have adopted the National Building often with supplementary laws or regulations to the requirements in the National Building Code.

===Alberta===
By agreement with the National Research Council of Canada, Alberta is committed to using the National Building Code of Canada as its base document with changes and modifications to suit Alberta needs in regulating the design, construction, alteration, change of use and demolition of buildings.

The Alberta Building Code 2006 was established by the Building Technical Council, a
technical council of the Safety Codes Council, after consultation with municipal authorities, provincial government departments, associations, other affected parties and Code users. The Code is published for Alberta by the National Research Council of Canada.

The Alberta Building Code 2006 was adopted by provincial regulation on 2 September 2007.

The National Building Code – 2019 Alberta Edition came into force on December 1, 2019. This code is based on the National Building Code of Canada 2015. It establishes design and construction standards, including barrier-free access in new buildings and energy efficiency for housing and small buildings. It also applies to the alteration, change of use and demolition of existing buildings.

Safety Codes in Alberta are developed and administered by Alberta Municipal Affairs. In addition to the production of the National Building Code - Alberta Edition, Municipal Affairs is responsible for the development and dissemination of code interpretations and alternatives known as STANDATA which come in three forms:

#Building Code Variances - acceptable alternative solutions to the prescriptive requirements (known as Alternative Solutions) in Division B.
#Building Code Interpretations - interpretations on Code items
#Building Code Bulletins - additional explanatory information on Code items or general Code topics

===British Columbia===
The British Columbia Building Code is based on the core concepts of the National Building Code with some variations specific to the province. The Code applies throughout British Columbia, except for some Federal lands and the City of Vancouver. The Code is published by Crown Publications.

====Vancouver====
Under the Vancouver Building Bylaw, Vancouver has developed its own building code based on the National Building Code.

===Ontario===
The Ontario Building Code is administered by the Building and Development Branch of the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing.

Prior to the enactment of the first Ontario Building Code Act in 1974, individual municipalities were responsible for developing their own building codes, resulting in a fragmented and potentially confusing regulatory environment. The introduction of a provincial Building Code Act and a provincial Building Code addressed this problem by providing for uniform construction standards across Ontario.

As of Jan. 1, 2012 the benchmark requirements for energy efficiency regarding houses and large buildings was enhanced. Updated compliance paths for energy efficiency requirements in large buildings are set out in Supplementary Standard SB-10. Residential buildings intended for occupancy on a continuing basis during the winter months must meet the performance levels specified in Supplementary Standard SB-12.

As of July 1, 2012 the Ontario Building Code was amended to address the issue of balcony glass breaking on newly constructed buildings. The new amendment, Supplementary Standard SB-13, &quot;Glass in Guards&quot; is intended to help minimize the likelihood that balcony glass will break on newly constructed buildings and help reduce the chance of broken pieces falling to the ground below if balcony glass does break.

===Quebec===
The Building Act provides for the adoption of a Construction Code and a Safety Code for buildings, equipment intended for use by the public, and electric, plumbing, and pressure installations as well as installations intended to use, store, or distribute gas. Whereas the Construction Code applies to plan and estimate designers (architects, engineers, technologists) and contractors, the Safety Code is intended for owners of buildings, equipment, and facilities.

These two codes are adopted chapter by chapter and are progressively replacing the seven laws and thirty-odd regulations that were previously in effect. The goal of this process is, obviously, to simplify regulations, but also to better define the responsibilities of owners and construction professionals.

In force since November 7, 2000, the &quot;Code de construction du Québec&quot; consists of the National Construction Code – 2005, amended, and includes Part 10 for existing buildings.

The Quebec &quot;Code de Construction&quot; is not compulsory in the province. Municipalities have the option of adopting the code of their choice, with or without modifications. In fact, many municipalities do not have any building code officially in effect.

For example, since 2013 the &quot;Régie du bâtiment du Québec&quot; has adopted a new code (Bill 122) that requires all owners of buildings that are 5 storeys and higher which are older than 1958 to conduct a facade inspection of the building by an engineer. This code is exclusive to the province.

===Other provinces===
Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and Newfoundland and Labrador have legislation enforcing the current version of the National Building Code of Canada. Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Saskatchewan have adopted the 2010 National Building Code as regulations under provincial acts.

===Federal jurisdiction===
For most construction under federal jurisdiction the National Building Code of Canada is the applicable Code. Property under federal jurisdiction includes military bases, federal government land and airports. First Nations land (as defined by the Indian Act - land set aside for the exclusive use of First Nations) may choose to adopt the National Building &amp; Fire Codes through a Band Resolution or By Law, however the National Building and Fire codes are not legally enforceable.

==Content==
The intent of the Building Code is to detail the minimum provisions acceptable to maintain the safety of buildings, with specific regard to public health, fire protection, accessibility and structural sufficiency. It is not a textbook for building design. The Building Code concerns construction, renovation, and demolition. It also covers change of use projects where the change would result in increased hazard and/or maintenance and operation in the existing building. The Code sets out technical requirements for the aforementioned project types and does not pertain to existing buildings.

The 1995 National Building Code is split into 9 parts.
*Part 1 Scope and Definitions
*Part 2 General Requirements
*Part 3 Fire Protection, Occupant Safety and Accessibility
*Part 4 Structural Design
*Part 5 Environmental Separation
*Part 6 Heating, Ventilating and Air-conditioning
*Part 7 Plumbing Services
*Part 8 Safety Measures at Construction and Demolition Sites
*Part 9 Housing and Small Buildings

Part 1 gives the definitions and describes how the building code is applied. Houses and certain other small buildings (less than 3 storeys high and 600 m2) are considered &quot;Part 9 Buildings&quot; and Part 9 drives the majority of the code requirements, with references to other parts where the scope of Part 9 is exceeded. Larger buildings are considered &quot;Part 4 buildings&quot; and parts 1 through 8 apply. Part 4 is the largest and most complicated part of the building code. It is intended to be used by engineers and architects. Part 9 is very prescriptive and is intended to be able to be applied by contractors.

The building code also references hundreds of other construction documents that are legally incorporated by reference and thus part of the enforceable code. This includes many design, material testing, installation and commissioning documents that are produced by a number of private organizations. Most prominent among these are the Canadian Electrical Code, Underwriters Laboratories of Canada a subsidiary of Underwriters Laboratories, documents on fire alarm design, and a number of National Fire Protection Association documents.

<text>In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Hall–Janko graph, also known as the Hall-Janko-Wales graph, is a 36-regular undirected graph with 100 vertices and 1800 edges.

It is a rank 3 strongly regular graph with parameters (100,36,14,12) and a maximum coclique of size 10. This parameter set is not unique, it is however uniquely determined by its parameters as a rank 3 graph. The Hall–Janko graph was originally constructed by D. Wales to establish the existence of the Hall-Janko group as an index 2 subgroup of its automorphism group. 

The Hall–Janko graph can be constructed out of objects in U3(3), the simple group of order 6048:
* In U3(3) there are 36 simple maximal subgroups of order 168. These are the vertices of a subgraph, the U3(3) graph. A 168-subgroup has 14 maximal subgroups of order 24, isomorphic to S4. Two 168-subgroups are called adjacent when they intersect in a 24-subgroup. The U3(3) graph is strongly regular, with parameters (36,14,4,6)
* There are 63 involutions (elements of order 2). A 168-subgroup contains 21 involutions, which are defined to be neighbors.
* Outside U3(3) let there be a 100th vertex C, whose neighbors are the 36 168-subgroups. A 168-subgroup then has 14 common neighbors with C and in all 1+14+21 neighbors.
* An involution is found in 12 of the 168-subgroups. C and an involution are non-adjacent, with 12 common neighbors.
* Two involutions are defined as adjacent when they generate a dihedral subgroup of order 8. An involution has 24 involutions as neighbors.

The characteristic polynomial of the Hall–Janko graph is formula_1. Therefore the Hall–Janko graph is an integral graph: its spectrum consists entirely of integers.

<doc id="1110671" wikidata="Q3815254" url="?curid=1110671" title="Copper-clad steel">
<text>Copper-clad steel (CCS), also known as copper-covered steel or the trademarked name [[Copper-clad steel|Copperweld]] is a bi-metallic product, mainly used in the wire industry that combines the high mechanical strength of steel with the conductivity and corrosion resistance of copper.

It is mainly used for grounding purposes, line tracing to locate underground utilities, drop wire of telephone cables, and inner conductor of coaxial cables, including thin hookup cables like RG-174 and CATV cable. It is also used in some antennas for RF conducting wires.

==History==
The first recorded attempt to make copper clad steel wire took place in the early 1860s. Although for over 100 years people had been suggesting various ways of uniting copper and steel, it was not until the period mentioned that Farmer and Milliken tried wrapping a strip of copper about a steel wire. American engineers in 1883 and again in the 1890s made attempts to produce a copper-steel wire, in one instance at least, by electroplating copper on steel.

The Duplex Metals Co. traces its beginning to John Ferreol Monnot between 1900 and 1905. He had been very interested in the work of Mr. Martin in Paris.
:&quot;After several years devoted to experimenting, [he] organized the Duplex Metals Company. Prior to his discovery of the process under which this company operates in producing its copper clad, probably almost every other possible way of welding copper and steel together had been tried by Mr. Monnot, but found useless for the purpose.&quot;

==Uses==
Copper-clad steel wire find applications in grounding, connection of ground rods to metallic structures, ground grid meshes, substations, power installations, and lightning arresters. 
This wire is also sometimes used for power transmission.

Copper coated welding wire has become common since wire welding equipment has become popular.

Copper-clad steel is occasionally used for making durable radio antennas, where its HF conductivity is nearly identical to a same-diameter solid copper conductor. It is most often used in antennas with long spans of unsupported wire, which need extra strength to withstand high tension which would cause solid copper or aluminum wire to break or stretch excessively.

==Properties==
The main properties of these conductors include:
* Good corrosion resistance of copper
* High tensile strength of steel
* Resistance against material fatigue

==Advantages==
Since the outer conductor layer is low-impedance copper, and only the center is higher impedance steel, the skin effect gives RF transmission lines with heavy copper-cladding a low impedance at high frequencies, equivalent to that of a solid copper wire.

Tensile strength of copper-clad steel conductors is greater than that of ordinary copper conductors permitting greater span lengths than with copper.

Another advantage is that smaller diameter copper-clad steel conductors may be used in coaxial cables, permitting higher impedance and smaller cable diameter than with copper conductors of similar strength.

Due to the inseparable union of the two metals and the low amount of the more costly one, it deters theft since copper recovery is impractical and thus has very little scrap value.

Installations with copper-clad steel conductors are generally accepted as fulfilling the legal specifications for a good electrical ground. For this reason its use is preferred by industrial companies and utilities when cost is a concern.

<doc id="1110685" wikidata="Q6889739" url="?curid=1110685" title="Modular representation theory">
<text>Modular representation theory is a branch of mathematics, and is the part of representation theory that studies linear representations of finite groups over a field &quot;K&quot; of positive characteristic &quot;p&quot;, necessarily a prime number. As well as having applications to group theory, modular representations arise naturally in other branches of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, coding theory, combinatorics and number theory.

Within finite group theory, character-theoretic results proved by Richard Brauer using modular representation theory played an important role in early progress towards the classification of finite simple groups, especially for simple groups whose characterization was not amenable to purely group-theoretic methods because their Sylow 2-subgroups were too small in an appropriate sense. Also, a general result on embedding of elements of order 2 in finite groups called the Z* theorem, proved by George Glauberman using the theory developed by Brauer, was particularly useful in the classification program.

If the characteristic &quot;p&quot; of &quot;K&quot; does not divide the order |&quot;G&quot;|, then modular representations are completely reducible, as with &quot;ordinary&quot; (characteristic 0) representations, by virtue of Maschke&#x27;s theorem. In the other case, when |&quot;G&quot;| ≡ 0 (mod &quot;p&quot;), the process of averaging over the group needed to prove Maschke&#x27;s theorem breaks down, and representations need not be completely reducible. Much of the discussion below implicitly assumes that the field &quot;K&quot; is sufficiently large (for example, &quot;K&quot; algebraically closed suffices), otherwise some statements need refinement.

==History==

The earliest work on representation theory over finite fields is by who showed that when &quot;p&quot; does not divide the order of the group, the representation theory is similar to that in characteristic 0. He also investigated modular invariants of some finite groups. The systematic study of modular representations, when the characteristic &quot;p&quot; divides the order of the group, was started by and was continued by him for the next few decades.

== Example ==

Finding a representation of the cyclic group of two elements over F2 is equivalent to the problem of finding matrices whose square is the identity matrix. Over every field of characteristic other than 2, there is always a basis such that the matrix can be written as a diagonal matrix with only 1 or −1 occurring on the diagonal, such as

:formula_1

Over F2, there are many other possible matrices, such as

:formula_2

Over an algebraically closed field of positive characteristic, the representation theory of a finite cyclic group is fully explained by the theory of the Jordan normal form. Non-diagonal Jordan forms occur when the characteristic divides the order of the group.

== Ring theory interpretation ==

Given a field &quot;K&quot; and a finite group &quot;G&quot;, the group algebra &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] (which is the &quot;K&quot;-vector space with &quot;K&quot;-basis consisting of the elements of &quot;G&quot;, endowed with algebra multiplication by extending the multiplication of &quot;G&quot; by linearity) is an Artinian ring.

When the order of &quot;G&quot; is divisible by the characteristic of &quot;K&quot;, the group algebra is not semisimple, hence has non-zero Jacobson radical. In that case, there are finite-dimensional modules for the group algebra that are not projective modules. By contrast, in the characteristic 0 case every irreducible representation is a direct summand of the regular representation, hence is projective.

==Brauer characters==
Modular representation theory was developed by Richard Brauer from about 1940 onwards to study in greater depth the relationships between the
characteristic &quot;p&quot; representation theory, ordinary character theory and structure of &quot;G&quot;, especially as the latter relates to the embedding of, and relationships between, its &quot;p&quot;-subgroups. Such results can be applied in group theory to problems not directly phrased in terms of representations.

Brauer introduced the notion now known as the Brauer character. When &quot;K&quot; is algebraically closed of positive characteristic &quot;p&quot;, there is a bijection between roots of unity in &quot;K&quot; and complex roots of unity of order coprime to &quot;p&quot;. Once a choice of such a bijection is fixed, the Brauer character of a representation assigns to each group element of order coprime to &quot;p&quot; the sum of complex roots of unity corresponding to the eigenvalues (including multiplicities) of that element in the given representation.

The Brauer character of a representation determines its composition
factors but not, in general, its equivalence type. The irreducible
Brauer characters are those afforded by the simple modules.
These are integral (though not necessarily non-negative) combinations
of the restrictions to elements of order coprime to &quot;p&quot; of the ordinary irreducible
characters. Conversely, the restriction to the elements of order coprime to &quot;p&quot; of
each ordinary irreducible character is uniquely expressible as a non-negative
integer combination of irreducible Brauer characters.

==Reduction (mod &quot;p&quot;)==
In the theory initially developed by Brauer, the link between ordinary representation theory and modular representation theory is best exemplified by considering the
group algebra of the group &quot;G&quot; over a complete discrete valuation ring &quot;R&quot; with residue field &quot;K&quot; of positive
characteristic &quot;p&quot; and field of fractions &quot;F&quot; of characteristic
0, such as the &quot;p&quot;-adic integers. The structure of &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] is closely related both to
the structure of the group algebra &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] and to the structure of the semisimple group algebra &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;], and there is much interplay
between the module theory of the three algebras.

Each &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module naturally gives rise to an &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module, and, by a process often known informally as reduction (mod &quot;p&quot;),
to a &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module. On the other hand, since &quot;R&quot; is a principal ideal domain, each finite-dimensional &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module
arises by extension of scalars from an &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module. In general, however, not all &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-modules arise as reductions (mod &quot;p&quot;) of
&quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-modules. Those that do are liftable.

== Number of simple modules ==

In ordinary representation theory, the number of simple modules &quot;k&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) is equal to the number of conjugacy classes of &quot;G&quot;. In the modular case, the number &quot;l&quot;(&quot;G&quot;) of simple modules is equal to the number of conjugacy classes whose elements have order coprime to the relevant prime &quot;p&quot;, the so-called &quot;p&quot;-regular classes.

== Blocks and the structure of the group algebra ==

In modular representation theory, while Maschke&#x27;s theorem does not hold
when the characteristic divides the group order, the group algebra may be decomposed as the direct sum of a maximal collection of two-sided ideals known as blocks. When the field &quot;F&quot; has characteristic 0, or characteristic coprime to the group order, there is still such a decomposition of the group algebra &quot;F&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] as a sum of blocks (one for each isomorphism type of simple module), but the situation is relatively transparent when &quot;F&quot; is sufficiently large: each block is a full matrix algebra over &quot;F&quot;, the endomorphism ring of the vector space underlying the associated simple module.

To obtain the blocks, the identity element of the group &quot;G&quot; is decomposed as a sum of primitive idempotents
in &quot;Z&quot;(&quot;R&quot;[G]), the center of the group algebra over the maximal order &quot;R&quot; of &quot;F&quot;. The block corresponding to the primitive idempotent
&quot;e&quot; is the two-sided ideal &quot;e&quot; &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]. For each indecomposable &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module, there is only one such primitive idempotent that does not annihilate it, and the module is said to belong to (or to be in) the corresponding block (in which case, all its composition factors also belong to that block). In particular, each simple module belongs to a unique block. Each ordinary irreducible character may also be assigned to a unique block according to its decomposition as a sum of irreducible Brauer characters. The block containing the trivial module is known as the principal block.

== Projective modules ==

In ordinary representation theory, every indecomposable module is irreducible, and so every module is projective. However, the simple modules with characteristic dividing the group order are rarely projective. Indeed, if a simple module is projective, then it is the only simple module in its block, which is then isomorphic to the endomorphism algebra of the underlying vector space, a full matrix algebra. In that case, the block is said to have &#x27;defect 0&#x27;. Generally, the structure of projective modules is difficult to determine.

For the group algebra of a finite group, the (isomorphism types of) projective indecomposable modules are in a one-to-one correspondence with the (isomorphism types of) simple modules: the socle of each projective indecomposable is simple (and isomorphic to the top), and this affords the bijection, as non-isomorphic projective indecomposables have
non-isomorphic socles. The multiplicity of a projective indecomposable module as a summand of the group algebra (viewed as the regular module) is the dimension of its socle (for large enough fields of characteristic zero, this recovers the fact that each simple module occurs with multiplicity equal to its dimension as a direct summand of the regular module).

Each projective indecomposable module (and hence each projective module) in positive characteristic &quot;p&quot; may be lifted to a module in characteristic 0. Using the ring &quot;R&quot; as above, with residue field &quot;K&quot;, the identity element of &quot;G&quot; may be decomposed as a sum of mutually orthogonal primitive idempotents (not necessarily
central) of &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]. Each projective indecomposable &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;]-module is isomorphic to &quot;e&quot;.&quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] for a primitive idempotent &quot;e&quot; that occurs in this decomposition. The idempotent &quot;e&quot; lifts to a primitive idempotent, say &quot;E&quot;, of &quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;], and the left module &quot;E&quot;.&quot;R&quot;[&quot;G&quot;] has reduction (mod &quot;p&quot;) isomorphic to &quot;e&quot;.&quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;].

==Some orthogonality relations for Brauer characters==
When a projective module is lifted, the associated character vanishes on all elements of order divisible by &quot;p&quot;, and (with consistent choice of roots of unity), agrees with the Brauer character of the original characteristic &quot;p&quot; module on &quot;p&quot;-regular elements. The (usual character-ring) inner product of the Brauer character of a projective indecomposable with any other Brauer character can thus be defined: this is 0 if the
second Brauer character is that of the socle of a non-isomorphic projective indecomposable, and 1
if the second Brauer character is that of its own socle. The multiplicity of an ordinary irreducible
character in the character of the lift of a projective indecomposable is equal to the number
of occurrences of the Brauer character of the socle of the projective indecomposable when the restriction of the ordinary character to &quot;p&quot;-regular elements is expressed as a sum of irreducible Brauer characters.

==Decomposition matrix and Cartan matrix==

The composition factors of the projective indecomposable modules may be calculated as follows:
Given the ordinary irreducible and irreducible Brauer characters of a particular finite group, the irreducible ordinary characters may be decomposed as non-negative integer combinations of the irreducible Brauer characters. The integers involved can be placed in a matrix, with the ordinary irreducible characters assigned rows and the irreducible Brauer characters assigned columns. This is referred to as the &quot;decomposition matrix&quot;, and is frequently labelled &quot;D&quot;. It is customary to place the trivial ordinary and Brauer characters in the first row and column respectively. The product of the transpose of &quot;D&quot; with &quot;D&quot; itself
results in the Cartan matrix, usually denoted &quot;C&quot;; this is a symmetric matrix such that the entries in its &quot;j&quot;-th row are the multiplicities of the respective simple modules as composition
factors of the &quot;j&quot;-th projective indecomposable module. The Cartan
matrix is non-singular; in fact, its determinant is a power of the
characteristic of &quot;K&quot;.

Since a projective indecomposable module in a given block has
all its composition factors in that same block, each block has
its own Cartan matrix.

== Defect groups ==

To each block &quot;B&quot; of the group algebra &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;], Brauer associated a certain &quot;p&quot;-subgroup, known as its defect group (where &quot;p&quot; is the characteristic of &quot;K&quot;). Formally, it is the largest &quot;p&quot;-subgroup
&quot;D&quot; of &quot;G&quot; for which there is a Brauer correspondent of &quot;B&quot; for the
subgroup formula_3, where formula_4 is the centralizer of &quot;D&quot; in &quot;G&quot;.

The defect group of a block is unique up to conjugacy and has a strong influence on the structure of the block. For example, if the defect group is trivial, then the block contains just one simple module, just one ordinary character, the ordinary and Brauer irreducible characters agree on elements of order prime to the relevant characteristic &quot;p&quot;, and the simple module is projective. At the other extreme, when &quot;K&quot; has characteristic &quot;p&quot;, the Sylow &quot;p&quot;-subgroup of the finite group &quot;G&quot; is a defect group for the principal block of &quot;K&quot;[&quot;G&quot;].

The order of the defect group of a block has many arithmetical characterizations related to representation theory. It is the largest invariant factor of the Cartan matrix of the block, and occurs with
multiplicity one. Also, the power of &quot;p&quot; dividing the index of the defect group of a block is the greatest common divisor of the powers of &quot;p&quot; dividing the dimensions of the simple modules in that block, and this coincides with the greatest common divisor of the powers of &quot;p&quot; dividing the degrees of the ordinary irreducible characters in that block.

Other relationships between the defect group of a block and character theory include Brauer&#x27;s result that if no conjugate of the &quot;p&quot;-part of a group element &quot;g&quot; is in the defect group of a given block, then each irreducible character in that block vanishes at &quot;g&quot;. This is one of many consequences of Brauer&#x27;s second main theorem.

The defect group of a block also has several characterizations in the more module-theoretic approach to block theory, building on the work of J. A. Green, which associates a &quot;p&quot;-subgroup
known as the vertex to an indecomposable module, defined in terms of relative projectivity of the module. For example, the vertex of each indecomposable module in a block is contained (up to conjugacy)
in the defect group of the block, and no proper subgroup of the defect group has that property.

Brauer&#x27;s first main theorem states that the number of blocks of a finite group that have a given &quot;p&quot;-subgroup as defect group is the same as the corresponding number for the normalizer in the group of that &quot;p&quot;-subgroup.

The easiest block structure to analyse with non-trivial defect group is when the latter is cyclic. Then there are only finitely many isomorphism types of indecomposable modules in the block, and the structure of the block is by now well understood, by virtue of work of Brauer, E.C. Dade, J.A. Green and J.G. Thompson, among others. In all other cases, there are infinitely many isomorphism types of indecomposable modules in the block.

Blocks whose defect groups are not cyclic can be divided into two types: tame and wild. The tame blocks (which only occur for the prime 2) have as a defect group a dihedral group, semidihedral group or (generalized) quaternion group, and their structure has been broadly determined in a series of papers by Karin Erdmann. The indecomposable modules in wild blocks are extremely difficult to classify, even in principle.

<text>Pennant Hills is a suburb in the Northern Sydney region of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Pennant Hills is located 18 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Hornsby Shire.

==History==
The area was first explored by Governor Arthur Phillip shortly after 15 April 1788. It was noted that the party saw &#x27;fine views of the mountains inland&#x27; (the Blue Mountains). Governor Phillip &#x27;did not doubt that a large river would be found&#x27; nearby.

The first white settlement occurred in the area with the establishment of convict timber camps in the time of Governor Lachlan Macquarie. Permanent white settlement of Pennant Hills began only in the 1840s and took off with the arrival of the Northern railway line in the 1880s. In August 1912 the federal government opened a Wireless Telegraphy Station, the first of its kind on a national level. The suburb has grown considerably since the 1950s, when the motor car became commonplace.

There are two distinct theories about the origin of the name Pennant Hills. One suggests the area was used as a site for raising flags, or pennants, for signalling purposes. However, the only recorded evidence of such a signalling system in the vicinity was one operating from 1824 to 1829 in the present suburb of Ermington and the use of the term &#x27;Pennant Hills&#x27; is found in much earlier documents. In an 1801 muster list, &#x27;Pennant Hills&#x27; is recorded as the place of residence of Ann Fay, wife of William Bellamy. In 1802 correspondence from Governor King to Joseph Banks, King refers to &quot;the range of Pennant Hills&quot;. In 1920 the historian James Jervis suggested that the locality had been named after the naturalist Thomas Pennant, a prominent British ornithologist and zoologist and prolific author of the eighteenth century. Although Pennant never visited Australia his friends and acquaintances included Sir Joseph Banks, Captain James Cook and Francis Grose (whose son Francis administered the colony of New South Wales when Arthur Phillip returned to England in 1792). Under the patronage system of the time, colonial administrators and explorers often acknowledged their English supporters by naming geographical features in their honour.

The name Pennant Hills originally applied to the area now known as West Pennant Hills, located in the Hills District. However, when the northern railway line was built it passed through what is now Pennant Hills, so a suburb grew around the station and took on the name. The area around Thompsons Corner was renamed West Pennant Hills. Pennant Hills is hilly and the highest altitude is at Observatory Park on Pennant Hills Road, which once was the site of the old astronomical observatory.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Pennant Hills was the site of Chelmsford Private Hospital, where the unorthodox psychiatric Deep Sleep Therapy conducted by Dr Harry Bailey resulted in the deaths of dozens of patients.

==Commercial areas==
Pennant Hills is one of the major commercial centres of Hornsby Shire. Several dozen shops are located at the north-west of the railway line, along with the local Pennant Hills Library. Several restaurants and cafes are located around Yarrara Road. Pennant Hills Marketplace, a local shopping centre, is located along Hillcrest Road.
Residential houses are found in all areas in Pennant Hills, with recent modern apartments and office towers found along Pennant Hills Road. A significant commercial/industrial area can be found along Pennant Hills Road.

Pennant Hills is home to several entertainment venues including the Pennant Hills Hotel.

==Transport==

Pennant Hills railway station is on the Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network.

Pennant Hills Road is one of Sydney&#x27;s major thoroughfares. Bus services by CDC NSW have their terminus in Pennant Hills and run to West Pennant Hills, Castle Hill and Cherrybrook.

==Schools==
Pennant Hills has two public schools: Pennant Hills Public School established in 1925 and Pennant Hills High School established in 1966, and two Catholic schools, Mount St Benedict College a girls secondary school and St. Agatha&#x27;s Catholic Primary School.

=== Parks and reserves ===

Pennant Hills is surrounded on two sides by large swathes of bushland. To the east, the suburb is bordered by the upper reaches of the Lane Cove River and its associated national park, whilst in the north-west, Pennant Hills borders Berowra Valley National Park. Both of these reserves contain extensive walking tracks within the boundaries of the suburb, with some linking to the Great North Walk.

Pennant Hills also contains many public parks, the largest being the Pennant Hills Park sportsground. This complex hosts many sporting facilities consisting of the Ern Holmes Oval for Australian Football and cricket, tennis and netball courts, a rugby union field, a football pitch, two hockey fields and an archery range. The Ern Holmes Oval was the home ground of the Pennant Hills Demons Australian Football Club until 2011.

Lilian Fraser Garden is also located in Pennant Hills. Originally maintained for many years by the noted government biologist Dr Lilian Fraser, after her death in 1987 her collection of rare and exotic plants was passed on to Hornsby Shire Council. Open free of charge to the public for viewing, the garden can also be hired for special events for a fee.

=== Sport and leisure ===
Pennant Hills, due to its wide array of sporting facilities, plays home to a large number of sporting organisations. These organisations include the Pennant Hills Football Club, which was established in 1957, and the Pennant Hills Demons AFC, which has seen nine players go on to compete in the AFL. Although the Ern Holmes Oval is no longer the home ground of the Demons premiership team due to its size, many of the club&#x27;s junior teams still compete in Pennant Hills.

Pennant Hills is also home to the Baden Powell Scout Centre, which borders the Lane Cove National Park. Opened in 1929, it initially served as a permanent camp for the unemployed during the Great Depression, and was visited by the Lord Baden-Powell himself in 1931. Situated on 36 acres of bushland, the centre is now home to the John Hill training centre and provides accommodation, catering and conference facilities for large groups, as well as activities such as high-ropes and rock climbing for camps.

The Pennant Hills area is home to the Pennant Hills Cherrybrook Rugby League Club affectionately known as the Stags. Whilst originally based at Pennant Hills Park, the club now plays out of Greenway Oval at Cherrybrook. The club competes with distinction in the North Sydney District Junior Rugby League competition.

The Pennant Hills Park Tennis Centre is now part of Northwest Sydney Tennis. It has 16 floodlit courts and a number of social tennis groups, including the Soldiers Point Tennis Club.

==Churches==
Pennant Hills was established as a Catholic parish in 1928 and a number of Catholic churches have been built since then. The parish&#x27;s current church, St. Agatha&#x27;s, was built in 1979. 

Pennant Hills is also home to the first Danish Church in Australia. Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary of Denmark made an official visit there on 6 March 2005.

Other churches located in Pennant Hills include:

* St Mark&#x27;s Anglican Church, 

* Pennant Hills Baptist Church 

* Pennant Hills Uniting Church

* Thornleigh Seventh-day Adventist Church located in Pennant Hills

==Demographics==

<text>Leeds City Credit Union Limited is a not-for-profit member-owned financial co-operative, trading as Leeds Credit Union, formed in 1987 and based in the West Yorkshire city of Leeds.

==History==

The credit union began life as the Leeds Council Employees Credit Union, offering savings and loans to local authority staff. In 1997, it became a community credit union, open to everyone living or working in the local authority area.

Leeds is the second largest metropolitan borough council in the UK with a population of 800,000. While continuing to serve members from 2006 to 2008, Leeds City Credit Union experienced a number of management and governance challenges. This led to an independent review of governance and the appointment of a new management team and a number of new directors.

Since 2009, Leeds City Credit Union has re-emerged as the country&#x27;s largest credit union with over 35,000 members. In 2012, members adopted a new constitution to take advantage of The Legislative Reform (Industrial and Provident Societies and Credit Unions) Order 2010. This has given the credit union new powers including the ability to extend its common bond to employers and organisations outside Leeds, to offer business accounts and interest on savings. In 2013, Leeds City Credit Union selected Intermarketing Agency as its marketing agency, following a pitch process.

In 2014, Lloyds Bank piloted a project in conjunction with Leeds City to encourage its staff to direct customers towards credit unions. It was awarded a grant of £50,000 by the Lloyds Banking Group Credit Union Development Fund to help support its reserves and enable it to bring forward plans for growth more quickly.

In July 2015, Leeds City Credit Union became members of Leeds Citizens, a new diverse alliance of organisations which aims to campaign for social justice and the common good. On 3 September 2015, Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Harriett Baldwin visited the credit union to discuss the important role that credit unions play in the financial sector. On 11 September 2015, a Your Loan Shop information point at the Compton Centre, Leeds was officially opened by LCC Executive Member for Communities, Cllr. Debra Coupar (Lab. Cross Gates and Whinmoor) and rising Leeds Rhinos RLFC star, Liam Sutcliffe. 

===Mergers===
Seacroft Credit Union (established 1997) transferred engagements to Leeds City Credit Union in 2001, followed by Skyrack Credit Union (established 1991 as South Headingley and Burley Savings and Co-operative Credit Union) and Halton Moor Co-operative Savings and Credit Union (established 1988) in 2002. More recently, White Rose Credit Union (established 1997 and incorporating the engagements of United Stream Credit Union) transferred in 2014.

==Activities==
Registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Acts, Leeds City Credit Union is governed by a volunteer board of directors who are elected at the Annual General Meeting. It has branches in Armley, Merrion House Leeds, Middleton, Kirkgate, Dewsbury Road and Seacroft. In 2014, it extended its reach to cover Wakefield where it has branches in the WDH City Centre Hub and the library building in Hemsworth. 

In June 2015, Leeds City Council teamed up with the credit union to as part of a scheme to tackle empty homes.

Leeds City Credit Union also has two other customer facing outlets named &#x27;Your Loan Shop&#x27;. For August and September 2014, Your Loan Shop had 364 visits in person and 118 web enquiries, resulting in 103 loans being issued to the value of £87,718. In August 2015, Your Loan Shop celebrated its first birthday by announcing it has helped over 600 people in Leeds and saved the people of Leeds approximately a quarter of a million pounds in higher interest charges compared to other loan shop lenders.

Membership of Leeds City Credit Union is restricted by common bond to individuals living or working in the cities of Leeds, Wakefield, the London Borough of Barking &amp; Dagenham and Harrogate where it continues to trade under the White Rose name in partnership with Harrogate Borough Council. Residents of certain housing associations and staff of select employers are also eligible to join.

===Products===
Leeds City Credit Union runs a payroll deduction savings and loans scheme in conjunction with Leeds City Council and select local employers. The credit union is responsible for the operation of the scheme, with the employer facilitating monthly deductions from salary. A payment card, accepted at Post Office and PayPoint outlets, can also be issued to members on request.

Credit unions do not pay a fixed rate of interest on savings balances. Instead, they distribute any trading surplus to members in the form of an annual dividend calculated on average savings or as a rebate of loan interest paid.

Leeds City Credit Union is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and PRA. Ultimately, like the banks and building societies, members&#x27; savings are protected against business failure by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme. As a current account provider, the credit union also subscribes to the Banking Code.

<doc id="1110702" wikidata="Q421373" url="?curid=1110702" title="Trypsinogen">
<text>Trypsinogen () is the precursor form (or zymogen) of trypsin, a digestive enzyme. It is produced by the pancreas and found in pancreatic juice, along with amylase, lipase, and chymotrypsinogen. It is cleaved to its active form, trypsin, by enteropeptidase, which is found in the intestinal mucosa. Once activated, the trypsin can cleave more trypsinogen into trypsin, a process called autoactivation. Trypsin cleaves the peptide bond on the carboxyl side of basic amino acids such as arginine and lysine.

==Function==

Trypsinogen is the proenzyme precursor of trypsin. Trypsinogen (the inactive form) is stored in the pancreas so that it may be released when required for protein digestion. The pancreas stores the inactive form trypsinogen because the active trypsin would cause severe damage to the tissue of the pancreas. Trypsinogen is released by the pancreas into the second part of the duodenum, via the pancreatic duct, along with other digestive enzymes.

==Activation of trypsinogen==

Trypsinogen is activated by enteropeptidase (also known as enterokinase). Enteropeptidase is produced by the mucosa of duodenum and it cleaves the peptide bond of trypsinogen after residue 15, which is a lysine. The N-terminal peptide is discarded, and a slight rearrangement of the folded protein occurs. The newly formed N-terminal residue (residue 16) inserts into a cleft, where its α-amino group forms an ion pair with the aspartate near the active site serine, and results in the conformational rearrangement of other residues. The amino group of Gly 193 orientates itself into the correct position, which completes the oxyanion hole in active site, thereby activating the protein. Since trypsin also cleaves the peptide bond after an arginine or a lysine, it can cleave other trypsinogen, and the activation process therefore becomes autocatalytic.

==Safeguards against trypsinogen activation==

Trypsin is produced, stored and released as the inactive trypsinogen to ensure that the protein is only activated in the appropriate location. Premature trypsin activation can be destructive and may trigger a series of events that lead to pancreatic self-digestion. In normal pancreas, around 5% of trypsinogens are thought to get activated, therefore there are a number of defenses against such inappropriate activation. Trypsinogen is stored in intracellular vesicles in the pancreas called zymogen granules whose membranous walls are thought to be resistant to enzymatic degradation. A further safeguard against inappropriate trypsin activation is the presence of inhibitors such as bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI) and serine protease inhibitor Kazal-type 1 (SPINK1), which binds to any trypsin formed. Trypsin autocatalytic activation of trypsinogen is also a slow process due to the presence of a large negative charge on the conserved N-terminal hexapeptide of trypsinogen, which repels the aspartate on the back of trypsin&#x27;s specificity pocket. Trypsin may also inactivate other trypsin by cleavage.

==Serum trypsinogen==
Serum trypsinogen is measured using a blood test. High levels are seen in acute pancreatitis and cystic fibrosis.

==Trypsinogen isoforms==
Three isoforms of trypsinogens may be found in human pancreatic juice. These are the cationic, anionic, and meso trypsinogen, and they account for 23.1%, 16%, and 0.5% of total pancreatic secretory proteins, respectively. Other forms of trypsinogen have been found in other organisms.

==Diseases==

The inappropriate activation of trypsinogen in the pancreas can lead to pancreatitis. Some type of pancreatitis may be associated with mutant forms of trypsinogen. A mutation at Arg 117, a trypsin-sensitive site, in cationic trypsinogen has been implicated in hereditary pancreatitis, a rare form of early-onset genetic disorder. Arg 117 may be a fail-safe mechanism by which trypsin, when activated within the pancreas, may become inactivated, and loss of this cleavage site would result in a loss of control and permit autodigestion resulting in pancreatitis. Other mutations have also been found that are linked to pancreatitis.

<doc id="1110704" wikidata="Q141622" url="?curid=1110704" title="Albatros B.II">
<text>The Albatros B.II, (post-war company designation L.2) was an unarmed two-seat reconnaissance biplane designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Albatros Flugzeugwerke. It was the aircraft that brought Albatros Flugzeugwerke to the world&#x27;s attention.

The design of the B.II, which included an unusually strong fuselage and an atypically flexible trailing edge, drew heavily upon the preceding Albatros B.I. Various measures were incorporated to elevate its usefulness as a reconnaissance aircraft, such as the presence of large square cutouts in the lower wing spars to increase downwards visibility from the observer&#x27;s position. The pilot was seated behind the observer, rather than in front as later convention would dictate. In terms of flying performance, the B.II was inherently stabile and relatively docile, characteristics that naturally lent itself to the trainer role for which a dedicated variant, the &quot;B.IIA&quot;, would be developed. Further developments, including a floatplane and the Albatros B.III, would also be produced.

The B.II was active from the onset of the First World War, being operated by the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; during the opening year of the conflict primarily to perform aerial reconnaissance. It was displaced from frontline service due to the arrival of more capable armed reconnaissance types, and was then used as a primary trainer. The B.II proved to be an export success, being adopted by multiple countries, both inside and outside of the Central Powers. Some of these overseas operators, such as the Swedish Air Force in 1919 and the Polish Air Force, continued to operate the type even after the Armistice of 11 November 1918 that ended the conflict.

==Design and development==
There is some dispute over the origins of this B.II; the aeronautical engineer Ernst Heinkel claimed to have designed the aircraft, however this claim is widely considered untrue by many aviation historians. It is commonly accepted that the aircraft&#x27;s actual designer was Robert Thelen. Irrespective of this controversy, the design process commended during peacetime and drew extensively upon the preceding Albatros B.I. One of the most clear visual distinctions between the B.I and the B.II was a noticeably shorter wingspan of the latter.
The fuselage of the B.II, which was atypically strong for the era, was primarily composed of plywood. The primary structural members of this fuselage comprised four longerons of mixed construction, comprising ash forward of the cockpit and spruce to the aft, that tapered sharply towards the rear. The design of the fuselage was commonplace amongst the company&#x27;s twin-seat aircraft. The nose of the aircraft features a rounded metal panel along with the aircraft&#x27;s engine; various engines would be used to power the type, such as the Mercedes D.II, which was capable of up to 89 kW (120 hp). The majority of the engine block was uncovered. Cooling was achieved via radiators fitted to the sides of the forward fuselage alongside the cockpit.

The B.II was operated by a crew of two; as was commonplace at the time, the pilot was seated in the rear cockpit while the observer was seated in the forward position. The field of view from observer&#x27;s position was partially obstructed downwards by the center-section trestle while the forward view was negatively impacted by the protruding engine block. To improve the downward field of view, large square cutouts were present in the lower wing spars; the lower wing also had a shorter span than its upper counterpart. The structure of the wing followed the company&#x27;s established practices, comprising a pair of spars, the rearward of which being roughly in the middle of the wing, making the trailing edge atypically flexible and thus gave the B.II a level of inherent stability. It had ailerons with an inverse taper while the operating cables ran externally over the surface of the lower wing.

The B.II was furnished with a large triangular tail, akin to the B.I; it had an unbalanced rudder and elevator control surfaces. Both the tailplane and fin were braced via a streamlined steel strut. The structure was mainly composed of lightweight steel tubing, while the exterior covering was fabric. The undercarriage used a traditional V-shaped chassis and was also composed of steel tubing; a claw-type break was fitted to the center of the axel. The tailskid, which was made of ash, featured an elastic shock chord and was installed upon an inverted pylon structure.

Various improvements and modifications were made to the B.II following its entry to service. Many aircraft would receive strengthening, particularly around the tail unit, while the radiators were also relocated from the fuselage sides to the center of the wing&#x27;s leading edge. A floatplane variant of the B.II was developed, known as the &quot;W.1&quot; or &quot;B.II-W&quot;, as was a purpose-built trainer with increased wingspan, dual flying controls, and different engines, designated the &quot;B.IIa&quot;. Further developments of the design led to the Albatros B.III, which was produced in small numbers. Across multiple variants, large numbers of the B.II were built both on behalf of the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; and various other military air services, typically those amongst the Central Powers.

==Operational history==

===Germany===
First flown in 1914, the B.II was already operationally active by the outbreak of the First World War during July 1914. It was heavily used through the first 12 months of the conflict in the aerial reconnaissance role; however, as the Allies fielded increasing numbers of armed military aircraft, the B.II was relatively defenseless due to its lack of armament. Thus, following the introduction of the armed C-type two-seaters that took over the reconnaissance role, the B.II was relegated from frontline duties. However, largely due to its relatively docile flight characteristics and economic engine, the B.II found a new life, remaining in use as a trainer, and thus remained active with the &quot;Luftstreitkräfte&quot; throughout the conflict.

During 1914, the B.II established a world altitude record of 4,500 m (14,800 ft).

A B.II from Feldflieger Abteilung 41 was one of the first landplanes (as opposed to Zeppelin) to drop bombs on England that caused some damage; on 16 April 1915, ten bombs were dropped by hand in the area of Sittingbourne and Faversham. No significant damage or casualties resulted.

===Sweden===
During 1914, Albatros Flugzeugwerke toured several countries across northern Europe, performing displays of the then-new B.II. It was considered one of the best primary trainer aircraft available at that time. However, both the landing gear and propeller of the demonstrator aircraft were damaged upon its arrival in Sweden. Due to the outbreak of the First World War, no spares could be sent and the aircraft was interned. It was subsequently repaired and operated in the trainer role by the Swedish Air Force. This aircraft was later copied and manufactured in Sweden by six different aircraft companies: &quot;Svenska Aeroplanfabriken&quot; (SAF), &quot;Södertelge Werkstäder&quot; (SW), &quot;Marinens Flygväsende&quot; (MFV), &quot;Nordiska Aviatikbolaget&quot; (NAB), AB Thulinverken as the Thulin C and &quot;Flygkompaniets Verkstäder Malmen&quot; (FVM). It was the first military trainer aircraft in Sweden and received the designation Sk 1 and Ö2 in the Swedish Air Force (the two types differed slightly, mainly by choice of engine). An FVM-built Sk 1 Albatros is on public display in the Swedish Air Force Museum near Linköping. The type was used until 1935. One aircraft was later sold to Finland.

===Finland===
NAB Albatros Type 9 (and SW 20 Albatros), Type 12 and Type 17 were among the first aircraft of the Finnish Air Force. It was in use between 1918 and 1923. There were two Type 9s, and one each of the Type 12 and 17. There was also one SW 20 Albatros, which was similar to the Type 9. The Type 12 aircraft was destroyed in the ferry flight to Finland; the remains of the aircraft were found near Eckerö, Åland. Type 12 was actually a modified Curtiss Twin JN with floats made by NAB.

===Austro-Hungary===
The Albatros B.II was widely used by the K.u.K; somewhat confusingly, it was assigned the designation &quot;Albatros B.I (series 21)&quot;.

<text>Thornleigh is a suburb in the Upper North Shore region of Sydney in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Thornleigh is located 22 kilometres north-west of the Sydney central business district in the local government area of Hornsby Shire. The source of the Lane Cove River is located in Thornleigh.

==Geography==

Thornleigh is bounded to the north by Waitara Creek and south by the Lane Cove National Park. Thornleigh borders the suburbs of Normanhurst, Hornsby, Wahroonga, Westleigh and Pennant Hills. 
Thornleigh offers great district views, and the topography varies greatly with many established areas built around bushland settings and into the hills to afford the great views. The northern areas of the suburb bounded by Larool Creek and Waitara Creek are leafy and lush with vegetation and native fauna including rainbow lorikeets, kookaburras, cockatoos, and bush turkeys. Majorie Headen Lookout is a vantage point which overlooks Larool and Waitara Creek Valley.
The area bounded near the train station and the Comenarra Parkway include early examples of Federation and Californian Bungalow style properties.

==History==

Thornleigh was originally part of the land that the Kuringai people settled. The first non-indigenous people to explore the area of Thornleigh were a party led by Governor Arthur Phillip in 1788. Settlers moved into the area in the 1830s and among them were James Milson, Patrick Duffy, John Thorn and Samuel Horne. Thornleigh is named after Constable John Thorn, who, along with Constable Horne, captured bushrangers Dalton and John MacNamara, leader of the North Rocks gang, on 22 June 1830, and were granted land as a reward in 1838. Horne&#x27;s land became Hornsby (now Normanhurst), and Thorn&#x27;s land became Thornleigh.

Orcharding was one of the major mainstays of Thornleigh during the late nineteenth century. 
Land sales posters used this as an attraction for prospective settlers describing the area as &quot;beautifully situated (and) surrounded by magnificent orchards, the fruit from which affords a splendid proof of the fertility of the soil and mildness of the climate&quot;.
Among the orchard growers was Patrick Michael Duffy, after which Duffy Avenue was named. After Patrick Duffy&#x27;s passing, his land was subdivided and passed down to his son Patrick Duffy Jnr. Eventually part of this land was purchased by the wealthy Friend family who built the &quot;Windyhaugh&quot; property on Duffy Avenue, which was later used as the first Presbyterian Fellowship Union camp in the Commonwealth.

As part of the construction of the railway from Strathfield to Hornsby, a 1.2 km branch was constructed in 1884 by the contractors to a quarry in a gully west of Thornleigh. The tracks included a zig zag section.

Thornleigh railway station opened on 17 September 1886 where the local produce (mainly citrus fruits) was exported to the city markets. Fruit grown at Thornleigh was also being exported as far as Vancouver and San Francisco.

Thornleigh Post Office opened on 12 March 1888.

The Thornleigh School of Arts opened in 1890 and was demolished in 1980 along with many other locations of historical significance in the suburb throughout the commercial development of the area in the 1970s and 1980s. These include the Astra Theatre (Originally named the Prince of Wales Theatre in 1923), the Royal Hotel, Thornleigh Public School with its World War I memorial and the original Edwardian structures at Thornleigh Railway Station. The Thornleigh Community Centre was constructed by the local and state government in order to compensate the community for the demolition of the Thornleigh School of Arts.

In 1901, the National Brickworks started operations at Thornleigh. In 1913, the largest malt works in the southern hemisphere was established by WG Chilvers. Chilvers Road was named after William George Chilvers.
Other streets with notable names include Norman Avenue, named after the Australian engineer Norman Selfe.

In the aftermath of World War I, Thornleigh was still a semi-rural area, but in the 1920s, suburban development became more apparent, as the availability of train services enabled people to move out of the city and into the suburban areas, making Thornleigh an attractive location for potential residents looking for a quieter life away from the bustling city.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, unemployment was a problem in the area, so a local woman named Lorna Brandt raised money for the construction of a walking track near the Lane Cove River as a way of providing relief work. The track begins at Thornleigh Oval, at the bottom of Handley Avenue, and goes through the bush towards the Lane Cove River. It then goes parallel to the river for a short distance before looping back to arrive at Comenarra Parkway. An extension goes down to the river, through a spot called Conscript Pass. At this spot, there are rock carvings done by the men who worked on the track. One of the carvings is a caricature of Bertram Stevens, Premier of New South Wales from 1932 to 1939. The track is known as Lorna Pass in memory of Lorna Brandt, and is now part of the Great North Walk, a long-distance walking trail between Sydney and Newcastle.

Plans to establish a university at Thornleigh in response to the large number of enrolments at the University of Sydney and the University of New South Wales were discussed in the early 1960s due to Thornleigh being &quot;Central to the Northern Line and the North Shore&quot;, however, the university was eventually established in the suburb of Macquarie Park and is now known as Macquarie University.

McDonald&#x27;s Australia opened its main headquarters in Thornleigh in 1971.

==Transport==
Thornleigh railway station is on the Northern Line of the Sydney Trains network. Pennant Hills Road is part of the National Highway, and is one of Sydney&#x27;s major thoroughfares. The Esplanade from Pennant Hills is a main road accessing Thornleigh to Normanhurst. The Comenarra Parkway is an arterial road that stretches from Thornleigh through to West Pymble via Wahroonga, Turramurra and South Turramurra.

Bus services from the CDC NSW Upper North Shore service include:
*587 - Hornsby to Westleigh via Waitara and Normanhurst
*588 - Hornsby to Normanhurst West via Normanhurst service
*589 - Hornsby to Sydney Adventist Hospital via Waitara, Normanhurst, Woodlands Estate and Thornleigh.
*600 - Hornsby to Parramatta via Waitara and Normanhurst

==Commercial areas==
Thornleigh contains industrial and commercial areas.

Thornleigh Marketplace containing a supermarket and speciality stores was constructed in 2005 and includes: A post office, butchers, hair and nail salons, pharmacy, newsagency, gym, sushi bar, cafes, optometrist and Woolworths.

Shops and restaurants are located around Thornleigh railway station and nearby Pennant Hills. The household hardware chain Bunnings Warehouse have a store located next to Pennant Hills Road. American multinational fast food restaurant chain McDonald&#x27;s have their Australian headquarters and flagship store in Thornleigh.

==Churches==

*St George Maronite Catholic Church
*Thornleigh Community Baptist Church
*Thornleigh Hillcrest Uniting Church
*Chinese Australian Baptist Church

==Schools==

* Thornleigh West Public School is a primary school (K-6, Public).
* Normanhurst West Public School (K-6, Public) at the corner of Sefton and Dartford Road.

Thornleigh Public and Infants Schools were closed in 1989 and demolished in the 1990s. A Bunnings hardware now sits in its place.
