<text>Fritz Heider (19 February 1896 – 2 January 1988) was an Austrian psychologist whose work was related to the Gestalt school. In 1958 he published &quot;The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations&quot;, which expanded upon his creations of balance theory and attribution theory. This book presents a wide-range analysis of the conceptual framework and the psychological processes that influence human social perception (Malle, 2008). It had taken 15 years to complete; before it was completed it had already circulated through a small group of social psychologists.

==Biography==
Heider was born in Vienna on February 19, 1896, but he grew up in Graz. During his childhood, Heider sustained a serious eye injury which later turned him quite serious and shy in his adolescence. Because of his injury, Heider avoided the draft during World War I.

With his father&#x27;s encouragement, Heider enrolled to study architecture at the University of Graz.  After growing tired of studying architecture, Heider attempted to study law at Graz as well but eventually became tired of both subjects. Since he really liked to learn for its own sake, he struck a deal with his father and proceeded to audit courses at the university for four years. Gradually, he eventually became more interested in psychology and philosophy. At the age of 24 he received a Ph.D. from the University of Graz, for his innovative study of the causal structure of perception including his work on &quot;Thing and Medium&quot; on the psychology of perception. Afterwards, he traveled to Berlin, where he attended lectures at the Psychology Institute. There, Heider&#x27;s studies focused on the Gestalt psychology of Wolfgang Koehler, Max Wertheimer and Kurt Lewin.

In 1927 he accepted a position at the University of Hamburg, whose faculty included the psychologist William Stern and Ernst Cassirer, the philosopher whose thinking on the role of theory in science had an important influence on Kurt Lewin.

In 1930, Heider was offered an opportunity to conduct research at the Clarke School for the Deaf Northampton, Massachusetts, which was associated with Smith College, also in Northampton. This prospect was particularly attractive to him because Kurt Koffka, one of the founders of the Gestalt school of psychology, held a position at Smith College (Heider, 1983).

It was in Northampton that he met his wife Grace (née Moore). Grace was one of the first people Heider met in the United States. As an assistant to Koffka, she helped Heider find an apartment in Northampton and introduced him to the environs (Heider, 1983). They were married in 1930, and the marriage lasted for more than 50 years. The couple had three sons: Karl, John, and Stephan. His son Karl Heider went on to become an important contributor to visual anthropology and ethnographic film whereas his son John wrote the popular &quot;The Tao of Leadership&quot;.

In 1948, Heider was recruited to the University of Kansas, by social psychologist Roger Barker (Heider, 1983). He remained in Kansas for the remainder of his life. In 1983, Heider documented his personal, career developments and achievements in his autobiography &quot;The Life of a Psychologist: An Autobiography&quot;. He died at his home in Lawrence, Kansas, on 2 January 1988 at the age of 91. His intellectual legacy still lives on. His wife of 57 years, Grace, died in 1995. His son John died in 2010.

==Work==
Heider published two important articles in 1944 that pioneered the concepts of social perception and causal attribution: &quot;Social perception and phenomenal causality&quot;, and, with co-author Marianne Simmel, &quot;An experimental study of apparent behavior&quot;. Heider would publish little else for the next 14 years.

In 1958, at the University of Kansas, Heider published his most famous work, which remains his most significant contribution to the field of social psychology. &quot;The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations&quot; was written in collaboration with the uncredited Beatrice Wright, a founder of rehabilitation psychology. Wright was available to collaborate because the University of Kansas&#x27;s nepotism rules prohibited her from a position at the university (her husband, Erik Wright, was a professor), and the Ford Foundation gave Heider funds and assistance to complete the project. (Wright is credited only in the foreword; she later went on to become an endowed professor of psychology at the University of Kansas). In his book, Heider presented a wide-ranging analysis of the conceptual framework and the psychological processes that undergird human social perception.

&quot;The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations&quot; pioneered attribution theory. A giant of social psychology, Heider had few students, but his book on social perception had many readers, and its impact continues into the 21st Century, having been cited over 26,000 times. Heider introduced two theories that correspond to his two articles from 1944: attribution theory and cognitive balance. &quot;The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations&quot; illuminates a sophisticated approach toward naive or common-sense psychology.

In &quot;The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations,&quot; Heider argued that social perception follows many of the same rules of physical object perception, and that the organization found in object perception is also found in social perception. Because biases in object perception sometimes lead to errors (e.g., optical illusions), one might expect to find that biases in social perception likewise lead to errors (e.g., underestimating the role social factors and overestimating the effect of personality and attitudes on behavior).

Heider also argued that perceptual organization follows the rule of &quot;psychological balance.&quot; Although tedious to spell out in completeness, the idea is that positive and negative sentiments need to be represented in ways that minimize ambivalence and maximize a simple, straightforward effective representation of the person. He writes &quot;To conceive of a person as having positive and negative traits requires a more sophisticated view; it requires a differentiation of the representation of the person into subparts that are of unlike value (1958, p. 182).&quot;

But the most influential idea in &quot;The Psychology of Interpersonal Relations&quot; is the notion of how people see the causes of behavior, and the explanations they make for it—what Heider called &quot;attributions&quot;.

Attribution theory (as one part of the larger and more complex Heiderian account of social perception) describes how people come to explain (make attributions about) the behavior of others and themselves. Behavior is attributed to a disposition (e.g., personality traits, motives, attitudes), or behavior can be attributed to situations (e.g., external pressures, social norms, peer pressure, accidents of the environment, acts of God, random chance, etc.) Heider first made the argument that people tend to overweight internal, dispositional causes over external causes—this later became known as the &quot;fundamental attribution error&quot; (Ross, 1977) or &quot;correspondence bias&quot; (Fiske &amp; Taylor, 1991; Jones, 1979, 1990).

Although he published little else, he kept voluminous notebooks which contained his reflections on psychology. These were subsequently edited in six volumes by Marijana Benesh-Weiner, a former student of Heider, who worked with Heider in organizing the collection for publication.(Heider &amp; Benesh-Weiner, 1987a, 1987b, 1988, 1989a, 1989b, 1990).

== The cognition–emotion linkage ==
Although Fritz Heider&#x27;s notebooks do not contain a specific theory on emotions, his notes do contain evidence of his beliefs on a cognition-emotion link and a fundamental logic that underlies all experiences of emotional states. Heider also points out that emotions may influence or alter cognitive states among some people. Heider also offered many definitions of emotional states and key properties that characterized these states. The emotions which Heider had a particular interest in are those which are considered interpersonal such as: anger and vengeance, sorrow and pity, gratitude, love, envy and jealousy. Heider primarily argued that in cases where one&#x27;s fundamental logic appears to be contradicted by something else, a much fuller analysis of the particular situation must take place.

In relation to anger, Heider&#x27;s notes consider cases in which a violated &quot;ought&quot; was to be a critical component in the arousal of anger and then follow an observation of the emotional reaction produced once that component is met. He notes how anger and annoyance create a paradox when someone feels social pressure to do what they know they &quot;ought&quot; to do. Heider considers this a paradox because within his general theory of balance, two forces acting in agreement should form a balanced structure and balanced structures should in turn produce positive rather than negative effects. Force one is social pressure and force two is the &quot;ought&quot; force, which both act in the same direction. The direction of the two forces should create harmony but in turn they create the opposite. Heider noted that the feeling of violation, particular to that of a violated &quot;ought&quot;, was a cognitive antecedent that characterized angered states. However, he also noted that cognition does not always seem to be a necessary condition for producing anger.

In relation to gratitude, Heider also points out necessary antecedents. He states that gratitude depends not only on receiving help but also on the perception of the intent of the help received as well as the perceived reason for the positive intent which has the power to modify and influence the causal attribution. Heider mentions that the need for one to maintain balanced states can affect the experience of gratitude as well as other emotions. In his notebook, he raises the question of why someone might be hesitant to accept a gift from a hated individual and later goes on to explain how one would rather keep the hatred felt toward the individual than have to mix it up with gratitude.

In addition to the work mentioned above, Heider explains how there seems to be some cognitive schema that has both a general and pervasive influence which led to the simplification of perception. In his notebook, Heider explains how people have a tendency to believe in the equalization of the future. Individuals who hold the idea of a &quot;constant sum&quot;, have a skewed view of their life experiences. Heider argued that this skewed pervading cognitive schemas lead to a simplification of life experiences. In his final notes on emotions, Heider recognizes a bidirectional influence between thought and affect stating that emotions alter cognition but there is also a possibility that emotions may also arouse needs.

==Impact==
There have been many reviews of his work. Others include the work by Miles Hewstone published in 1989. and the review published in the &quot;Review of General Psychology&quot; in 2007.

==Awards==
He received many honors, including the American Psychological Association (APA) Distinguished Contribution Award, the Gold Medal for Scholarly Accomplishment in Psychological Science presented by the American Psychological Foundation, and election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

<doc id="1084583" wikidata="Q2700828" url="?curid=1084583" title="The Wayans Bros.">
<text>The Wayans Bros. is an American sitcom television series that aired on The WB from January 11, 1995, to May 20, 1999. The series starred real life brothers Shawn and Marlon Wayans, comedian John Witherspoon, and Anna Maria Horsford (season 2 onward).

==Premise==
Shawn and Marlon Williams (Shawn Wayans and Marlon Wayans) are brothers who live in an apartment on 117th Street in Harlem. Shawn owns a local newsstand, where he and his brother Marlon work on a daily basis. Their father, John &quot;Pops&quot; Williams (John Witherspoon), owns a diner called Pops&#x27; Joint, where Marlon once worked (during season 1). Formerly located in Harlem, the restaurant was later moved downtown into the fictional Neidermeyer Building, in Rockefeller Center, where Shawn&#x27;s newsstand is located and Dee Baxter (Anna Maria Horsford (onwards from Season 2)) works as a security guard.

===Season 2 transitions===
Many transitions were made in season 2:
* Shawn&#x27;s former girlfriend, Lisa Saunders (Lela Rochon), did not return for the rest of the series.
* Monique (Paula Jai Parker), a local shopkeeper and Marlon&#x27;s love interest, did not return after the eleventh episode. Parker first appeared as a love interest of Marlon&#x27;s in the Season 1 episode &quot;Pulp Marlon&quot;. She was only a guest star for this one episode.
* Lou (Jill Tasker), the former security guard, left after the tenth episode and was replaced by Dee Baxter (Anna Maria Horsford).
* White Mike (Mitch Mullany), Shawn and Marlon&#x27;s ghetto white neighbour, appeared for six episodes of Season 2. He was slated to appear as a recurring character for the rest of the series, but actor Mitch Mullany ended up getting his own show &quot;Nick Freno: Licensed Teacher&quot;.
* Shawn formerly worked for APS; in Season 2, he works at his newsstand.
* Marlon was working with Pops at the diner, but in Season 2, he works at the newsstand with Shawn.
* Pops&#x27; Joint was a standalone restaurant, where he hired Marlon and Benny, the cook, during Season 1. However, in Season 2, the eatery was moved into the Neidermeyer Building, in Rockefeller Center. It was also revealed that Pops&#x27; Joint was a historical landmark for the nation&#x27;s leaders and activists of the Civil Rights Movement.

==Cast==
===Main===
* Shawn Wayans as Shawn Williams, a womanizing, stylish and responsible young bachelor and Marlon&#x27;s older brother. He is an owner of his own local newsstand.
* Marlon Wayans as Marlon Williams, Shawn&#x27;s dimwitted, immature, sex crazed, unsanitary and lazy younger brother, who also works at the newsstand. Marlon usually serves as the comic foil to big brother Shawn, often at times getting himself, or Shawn into tight spots. Marlon cuts his hair in the Season 3 episode &quot;Grandma&#x27;s in the Hiz-House&quot;.
* John Witherspoon as John &quot;Pops&quot; Williams, Shawn and Marlon&#x27;s dysfunctional tacky father, who owns his locally famed diner, which is right by Shawn and Marlon&#x27;s newsstand.
* Anna Maria Horsford as Deirdre &quot;Dee&quot; Baxter (seasons 2–5), the tough security guard and Shawn, Marlon and Pops&#x27; close friend.
* Lela Rochon as Lisa Saunders (season 1)
* Paula Jai Parker as Monique (season 2, episodes 1–11)
* Jill Tasker as Lou Malino (season 2, episodes 1–7)

===Recurring===
* Phill Lewis as Thelonious &quot;T.C.&quot; Capricornio (seasons 2–5)
* Mitch Mullany as White Mike (season 2)
* Ja&#x27;Net DuBois as Grandma Ellington (seasons 3–4)
* Jermaine &#x27;Huggy&#x27; Hopkins as Dupree (seasons 3–5)

==Episodes==

== Production ==
&quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot; was the first of the four sitcoms that aired as part of the original Wednesday night two hour lineup that helped launch the network (along with &quot;Unhappily Ever After&quot;, &quot;The Parent &#x27;Hood&quot;, and the short-lived &quot;Muscle&quot;). While in development, the series&#x27; working title was initially supposed to have been &quot;Brother to Brother&quot; before the name of the series changed to &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;

In the show&#x27;s second season in 1995, Pops&#x27; Joint (the restaurant owned by Shawn and Marlon&#x27;s father, John &quot;Pops&quot; Williams) was moved into the Neidermeyer Building where the location was changed from Harlem to Rockefeller Center, Manhattan.

While the series did not end on a cliffhanger, it was cancelled in 1999 due to declining ratings and was not given a proper finale. In the horror comedy film &quot;Scary Movie&quot; (2000), Shawn Wayans&#x27; character, while furiously stabbing another character to death, breaks the fourth wall and says: &quot;And &quot;The Wayans Bros&quot;. was a good show, man! It was a good-ass show, and we didn&#x27;t even get a final episode!&quot;

==Theme music and opening sequence==
The show&#x27;s official opening title began with Shawn and Marlon on the steps of a brownstone apartment building, donning afros and wearing 1970s preppy attire, moving in rhythm to an accompanying satirical music piece that&#x27;s supposed to have a 1970s style &quot;urban&quot; sitcom theme song feel. Marlon forcefully smacks the camera, and then segues into &quot;the real opening&quot; of &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot;

The scene then cuts to them with their normal clothes and trying to help an old woman who gets hit by a bus. The camera then shows the brothers inside the bus with the title of the show underneath them. The &quot;second half&quot; part of &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot; theme song was changed twice throughout its four-year run (1995–1999). In the first two seasons, the show&#x27;s theme song was A Tribe Called Quest&#x27;s &quot;Electric Relaxation&quot;.

In the third season, the theme song changed to a four-second hip hop beat. In the final two seasons, the show&#x27;s theme song was changed again to a regular hip hop instrumental beat (which was produced by the Wayans Bros. &amp; Omar Epps). In Brazilian reruns of seasons one and two episodes that have aired in SBT in 2015, this version replaced the seasons one and two sequence with the season three sequence.

==Syndication==
Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution handles syndication distribution of the series. In September 1999, after the series was cancelled by The WB, the series began airing in off network syndication nationwide.
At that same time, Chicago based national cable superstation WGN began airing reruns of the series, airing the series until 2002 (when its broadcast syndication run also ended); WGN (both the local Chicago feed and the national superstation feed) aired &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot; in first run form from 1995 to 1999, when WGN (whose local Chicago feed was an affiliate of the network) carried WB programming nationally to make The WB available to markets where a local affiliate did not exist (&quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot; is one of three WB series to have aired on WGN in both first run and syndication form; &quot;The Parent &#x27;Hood&quot;, &quot;7th Heaven&quot;, and &quot;Sister, Sister&quot; being the others).

In 2006, reruns began airing on BET, after a four-year absence, where it ran until 2007. In 2007, reruns of the series aired on Ion Television where it ran until 2008. Since then, several Viacom networks, including MTV2, VH1, and BET Her have run the series in continuous rotation. As of 2023, reruns air frequently on VH1. All five seasons of the show stream on HBO Max and BET+.

==Home media==
Warner Home Video released Season 1 of &quot;The Wayans Bros.&quot; on DVD in Region 1. Warner Archive subsequently released Seasons 2 to 5 on DVD in Region 1.

<text>James Bryan Herrick (11 August 1861 in Oak Park, Illinois – 7 March 1954 in Chicago, Illinois) was an American physician and professor of medicine who practiced and taught in Chicago. He is credited with the description of sickle-cell disease and was one of the first physicians to describe the symptoms of myocardial infarction.

==Biography==
Herrick was born in Oak Park, Illinois, of parents Origen White Herrick and Dora Kettlestrings Herrick (who was considered the oldest native daughter of Oak Park, because her father had homesteaded there). He attended Oak Park and River Forest High School and nearby Rock River Seminary. He received a BA degree from the University of Michigan in 1882, after which he taught school in Peoria, Illinois and Oak Park.

Herrick married Zellah P. Davies of Oak Park. After a few years of teaching in the public schools he entered Rush Medical College, and received a medical degree in 1888. He interned at Cook County Hospital, after which he opened a private practice in the Chicago area. He also obtained a part-time teaching position at Rush College, and was listed as a full professor there from 1900 through 1927. He was also on the staff of Presbyterian Hospital in Chicago from 1895 through 1945.

==Medical discoveries==
Herrick studied and taught at various Chicago hospitals. His first discovery, in 1910, was that of sickle-shaped red blood cells on the blood film of a dental student from Grenada. His description of the student&#x27;s disease was known for many years as &quot;Herrick&#x27;s syndrome&quot;, and is now known as &quot;sickle-cell disease&quot;. The condition is prevalent in West Africa.

Herrick&#x27;s second major contribution was a landmark article on myocardial infarction (&quot;heart attack&quot;) in JAMA in 1912. He proposed that thrombosis in the coronary artery leads to the symptoms and abnormalities of heart attacks and that this was not inevitably fatal. While Herrick was not the first to propose this, ultimately his article was the most influential, although at the time it received only limited attention. In 1918 he was one of the first to encourage electrocardiography in the diagnosis of myocardial infarction.

Herrick is not closely associated with genetics, but his discoveries turned out to be inherited traits, so his contributions pointed other researchers toward genetically-based conditions.

==Services, awards and honors==
Herrick served as president of several medical associations, including the Chicago Pathological Society, the Chicago Society of Internal Medicine, the Association of American Physicians, the American Heart Association, the Institute of Medicine (Chicago chapter), and the Society of Medical History (Chicago chapter).

He received an honorary degree (Master of Arts) from the University of Michigan (1907), and an honorary degree (Doctor of Law) from UM (1932).

He received the George H. Kober Medal from the Association of American Physicians (1930).

Herrick received the Distinguished Service Cross from the American Medical Association (1939).

He traveled several times to Europe in order to further his medical education. He actively participated in and supported the Chicago Literary Club all his life. He was an avid student of Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s writings.

The collected papers were donated to Rush Medical College after his death. A portion of his collected papers had also been donated to the University of Chicago before his death.

He is commemorated by an annual award and a memorial lecture.

<text>USS &quot;Jack&quot; (SS-259), a submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the jack (any of various fishes—young pike, green pike or pickerel, or large California rockfish).

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Jack&quot;′s keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut, on 2 February 1942. She was launched on 16 October 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Frances Seely, and commissioned at Naval Submarine Base New London in New London, Connecticut, on 6 January 1943, Commander Thomas. M. &quot;Tommy&quot; Dykers in command.

==Service history==
=== First and second war patrols, June – October 1943 ===

&quot;Jack&quot; underwent shakedown training along the New England coast, sailing from New London 26 April 1943 for service in the Pacific. Reaching Pearl Harbor 21 May, the submarine took on supplies and departed on her first offensive war patrol 5 June 1943. Taking part in the submarine offensive against Japan, she patrolled off Honshū. &quot;Jack&quot; came upon a five-ship convoy 26 June, and in a series of five well-executed attacks, sank the 4,000-ton passenger/cargo ship &quot;Toyo Maru&quot; and the 6,000-ton cargo ship &quot;Shozan Maru&quot;. In attempting to torpedo a third ship, the submarine was shaken by a bomb dropped by an airplane, but the alert crew corrected her dangerous diving angle and effected repairs.

On 4 July 1943, &quot;Jack&quot; began to track smoke on the horizon and soon detected &quot;Nikkyo Maru&quot; with an escort. The submarine used three torpedoes to send the cargo ship to the bottom, and returned to Pearl Harbor for repairs 19 July 1943. This patrol is dramatized in the 1950s TV series, The Silent Service (S01 E01), produced by Universal Television and hosted by Tommy Dykers.

&quot;Jack&quot;″s second war patrol (5 September–10 October 1943) brought no opportunities for attack as engineering difficulties forced her to return prematurely to Pearl Harbor. During her subsequent stay in Hawaii, an Allied tanker mistook her for a Japanese submarine and opened gunfire on her in the Pacific Ocean northeast of Hawaii at on 1 January 1944.

=== Third war patrol, January – March 1944 ===

On her third war patrol, the submarine proceeded westward from Pearl Harbor 16 January 1944 bound for the South China Sea. Prowling the pivotal Singapore-Japan shipping lanes, she encountered convoy Hi-40 of five large oil tankers with three escorts early 19 February. The submarine reached attack position at about 04:40 and fired three torpedoes, scoring one hit. She then began an &quot;end around,&quot; a long circling maneuver designed to bring her in front of the remaining four tankers, and late that afternoon she was again ready to attack. Two torpedoes sank two more of the frantically zigzagging ships, and &quot;Jack&quot; moved in on the trailing tanker. Her first spread of torpedoes missed and the tanker replied with a salvo from guns, but &quot;Jack&quot; returned three hours later to sink her with four torpedoes. In this remarkable series of attacks, the submarine sank four tankers (earning the nickname &quot;Jack the Pack&quot;, after the convoy commander radioed that he was under attack from a &quot;wolfpack&quot;), all over 5,000 tons: &quot;Kokuie Maru&quot;, &quot;Nanei Maru&quot;, &quot;Nichirin Maru&quot;, and &quot;Ichiyo Maru&quot;. After several more attacks &quot;Jack&quot; set course for Fremantle, Australia, her new base, where she arrived 13 March 1944.

=== Fourth and fifth war patrols, April – July 1944 ===

Departing Australia 6 April 1944, &quot;Jack&quot; returned to the South China Sea for her fourth war patrol. She chased the Take Ichi convoy through the afternoon of 25 April, and shortly after midnight next day attacked, sinking and damaging two others. &quot;Jack&quot; also used her deck gun to sink a radio-equipped trawler, &quot;Daisun&quot;, 27 April before returning to Fremantle 10 May 1944.

&quot;Jack&quot; left Fremantle for her fifth war patrol 4 June 1944, again returning to Japan&#x27;s important lifelines in the South China Sea. Early 24 June she made an approach on a large convoy and fired three torpedoes, sinking a large tanker, &quot;San Pedro Maru&quot;, before escorting aircraft forced her to retire. Five days later the submarine came upon another large convoy, and by early 30 June was in position. Three successive attacks sent cargo ships &quot;Matsukawa Maru&quot; and &quot;Tsukushima Maru&quot; to the bottom. &quot;Jack&quot; returned to Fremantle 14 July 1944. For her highly successful and aggressive first, third, and fifth war patrols, the submarine was awarded the coveted Presidential Unit Citation.

=== Sixth and seventh war patrols, August – December 1944 ===

The submarine sailed from Fremantle 6 August 1944 to the Celebes Sea for her sixth war patrol. Attacking a convoy 29 August, she sank a small minesweeper (&quot;Minesweeper No 28&quot;) and started in pursuit of a cargo ship. After her torpedo missed and she was raked with gunfire by her adversary, &quot;Jack&quot; deftly evaded the attacker and returned later to sink &quot;Mexico Maru&quot;. &quot;Jack&quot; arrived at Fremantle following this patrol 24 September 1944.

She departed Fremantle once more 27 October 1944, bound for the South China Sea. She attacked a coastal convoy 14–15 November, sinking cargo ships &quot;Nichiei Maru&quot; and &quot;Yusan Maru&quot; before shallow water forced her to break off the fight. The attrition of Japanese shipping was beginning to tell, and &quot;Jack&quot; found no more opportunities before ending her patrol at Pearl Harbor 24 December 1944. From there she returned to San Francisco for a major overhaul.

=== Eighth and ninth war patrols, April – August 1945 ===

The veteran submarine returned to Pearl Harbor 1 April 1945, and departed on her eighth war patrol 26 April 1945. With most Japanese shipping sunk or reluctant to venture into the sea lanes, her major job was to act as lifeguard for the massive carrier strikes and bomber missions against the Japanese mainland. The submarine returned to Guam for refit 18 June and set out again 12 July for her ninth and last war patrol. Stationed between Luzon and Okinawa, she again performed lifeguard duty until the Japanese surrender 15 August 1945. Her ninth patrol ended at Midway Atoll 29 August.

=== Greek service ===

&quot;Jack&quot; sailed for the United States 5 September 1945, steaming via Pearl Harbor and the Canal Zone to New York 3 October 1945. She decommissioned at Atlantic Reserve Fleet, New London 8 June 1946, and was placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She recommissioned briefly 20 December 1957, to prepare for transfer to the government of Greece and after training operations was loaned to the Royal Hellenic Navy 21 April 1958. She served as &quot;Amfitriti&quot; (S-17) (also spelled &quot;Amphitriti&quot;), until 1967, when she was returned by Greece and sunk as a target by the US 6th Fleet, 5 September 1967, in the Mediterranean Sea.

==Awards==
&quot;Jack&quot; was credited with sinking 76,687 tons of Japanese shipping. In addition to her Presidential Unit Citation (US), &quot;Jack&quot; received seven battle stars for World War II service. All patrols, except for her second and ninth, were designated successful.

==In culture==

&quot;Jack&quot; is the subject of the series premiere of the syndicated television anthology series &quot;The Silent Service&quot;. The episode, entitled &quot;The Jack at Tokyo,&quot; aired 5 Apr 1957 and was hosted by Rear Admiral Thomas M. Dykers (ret).

&quot;Jack&quot;″s operations during the Pacific War are chronicled in &quot;Silent Running: My Years on a World War II Attack Submarine&quot;.

<text>Eden Park is a sports venue in Auckland, New Zealand. It is located three kilometres southwest of the Auckland CBD, on the boundary between the suburbs of Mount Eden and Kingsland. The main stadium has a nominal capacity of 50,000, and is sometimes referred to as New Zealand&#x27;s national stadium. The stadium is used primarily for rugby union in winter and cricket in summer, and has also hosted rugby league and association football matches, as well as concerts and cultural events. It is owned and operated by the Eden Park Trust Board, whose headquarters are located in the stadium.

Eden Park is considered one of international rugby union&#x27;s most difficult grounds for visiting sides. New Zealand&#x27;s national rugby union team, nicknamed the All Blacks, have been unbeaten at this venue in 50 consecutive test matches stretching back to 1994. Eden Park is the site of the 2021 Te Matatini. It was the site for the 2022 Women&#x27;s Cricket World Cup, the final of the 2021 Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup and staged the opening match of the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. In 2011 it hosted pool games, two quarter-finals, both semi-finals and the final of 2011 Rugby World Cup. In doing so it became the first stadium in the world to host two Rugby World Cup finals, having held the inaugural final in 1987. It was a venue for the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which was jointly hosted by Australia and New Zealand. Eden Park also hosted the Final of the 1985-1988 Rugby League World Cup.

==History==
===Origins of Eden Park===
The land where Eden Park stands was originally swampland, fed by lava caverns created by Maungawhau / Mount Eden and Mount Albert over 30,000 years ago. Tāmaki Māori used the swamp to collect food and materials. In 1845, the area was purchased by Cornish farmer John Walters. Eden Park has been a sports ground since 1900. The park began as a cricket ground in 1903, and was due to the vision of one Harry Ryan, a cricket enthusiast who approached landowner John Walters to lease part of his land as a sports field. In the book &quot;Eden Park: A History&quot;, the authors write, &quot;Certainly the rough paddock strewn with stones, studded with outcrops of rock and streaked with cowpats, falling away to a boggy trough that filled in a downpour and remained flooded throughout the winter, looked better suited to frog-hunting or duck-shooting than cricket, let alone rugby. Ryan knew or at least imagined better.&quot; Much early work on the cricket ground was needed, including clearing the stone walls that had been used to divide farmland, and ongoing drainage issues.

Those who saw Ryan&#x27;s vision as madness most likely felt vindicated when, in 1907, massive downpours of rain saw the ground submerged in water for a week. The same thing happened again later in the year. By 1910, the ongoing maintenance costs led the Eden District Cricket Club to approach the Auckland Cricket Association to take over running the park. By 1912, the land had been transferred from John Walters to the trustees of the cricket association, backed financially by a number of well-known Auckland businessman. The name &#x27;Eden Park&#x27; settled into general usage around 1912, soon after it had been taken over by the association.

===Opening as a cricket and rugby venue===

In 1913 the park was leased to the Auckland Rugby Football Union, becoming both a summer and winter sporting venue, with the union leasing the venue initially for 21 years. The union agreed to pay to build the park&#x27;s first grandstand, erected in 1913 to hold an audience of 2,500, and later followed by a second members&#x27; stand built in 1914. In 1914, the first international cricket match was held, with Auckland hosting Australia. The first rugby match played at the venue was a seven-a-side series on 9 May 1914, and the first representative match was played on 5 September, against Wellington. Drainage issues ceased to be a regular issue for Kingsland and Eden Park in the 1920s, after which the park began to flourish. The first rugby test was held on 27 August 1921, when South Africa beat New Zealand 5–9 before a crowd of 40,000. The Auckland Rugby Football Union officially made Eden Park its home in 1925, and in 1926, a trust was set up to manage Eden Park primarily for the benefit of Auckland Cricket and Auckland Rugby.

In 1930, the ground hosted its inaugural British and Irish Lions matches as part of the 1930 British Lions tour to New Zealand and Australia. Matches were held against Auckland and New Zealand sides, both won by the home sides with an attendance of 45,000 at the latter. The ground hosted its first match between New Zealand and Australia as part of the 1931 Australia rugby union tour of New Zealand. New Zealand won 20–13. In 1933, New Zealand hosted England in the first cricket test match, where Wally Hammond set an individual test batting record of 336 not out.

Eden Park served as the opening ceremony and athletics venue for the 1950 British Empire Games, when the western part of the grounds were first opened. In 1955, New Zealand hosted England in the second test match of their 1954–55 Tour of New Zealand. During the same year, the New Zealand Parliament passed the Eden Park Trust Act, enshrining the governance structure of the park until 2009. By 1956, the West Stand was completed, followed by the South Stand in 1958. New Zealand won its first cricket test match against the West Indies as part of the 1955–56 West Indies Tour of New Zealand. The ground hosted its third rugby international between New Zealand and South Africa. New Zealand won 11 – 5 before a record crowd of 63,000. The British and Irish Lions returned for the third time in the 1959 British Lions tour to Australia and New Zealand with matches against Auckland and New Zealand. The visitors win both, their first test match win at the ground.

During the 1960s and 70s, further large scale events were held at the venue, including 1961 French tour of New Zealand and Australia, the 1963 England tour of New Zealand, the 1969 Wales rugby union tour of Oceania, a welcoming party for the royal family during the 1970 New Zealand Royal Visit Honours, the Australian tour of New Zealand (1973–74), and a gymnastic display held by touring Russian gymnasts including Olga Korbut. During the 1975 Scotland rugby union tour of New Zealand, both teams famously played during a downpour on a completely saturated pitch, before the one-off test had to be cancelled as the drainage system was unable to cope with the flooding.

During the 1981 Springbok Tour, a low-flying Cessna 172 piloted by Marx Jones and Grant Cole disrupted the final test by dropping flour-bombs on the pitch.

The 1980s saw a number of record events such as a crowd of 43,000 at the 1981–82 Australia Tour of New Zealand, where Australian batsman Greg Chappell dealing with an on ground streaker with his bat. An indoor cricket facility and stand were built next to the outer oval. At the inaugural Rugby World Cup, co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand in 1987, New Zealand defeated France 29 – 9 in the final in front of a crowd of 48,035. In 1988, Eden Park hosted the 1988 Rugby League World Cup final, with Australia defeating New Zealand 25 – 12 before a New Zealand rugby league record crowd of 47,363. This made Eden Park the only venue to have ever hosted (as of 2024) both the Rugby Union and Rugby League World Cup Finals and the only venue to do so in consecutive years. The 1988 World Cup Final was the first game of rugby league played at Eden Park since 1919. Eden Park was a venue during the 1992 Cricket World Cup, cohosted with Australia.

In 1996, the new Auckland Blues began playing at the ground, with the inaugural Super 12 final held at the ground, with the Auckland Blues defeating the 45 – 21 before a crowd of 46,000. The ground hosted Super 12 finals in 1997, 1998 and 2003. The ground hosted its first rugby test between New Zealand and Ireland as part of the 2002 Ireland Tour of New Zealand. In 2003, the playing surface on the main oval was completely overhauled with the introduction of &quot;Motz&quot; turf.

===2011 Rugby World Cup and redevelopment===

In 2007, the ground was confirmed by the New Zealand Government as the venue for the final of the 2011 Rugby World Cup, with redevelopment beginning in 2008. The ground was the subject of a hotly debated dilemma, as to whether the event should be hosted at historic Eden Park or a new city centre stadium. The redeveloped stadium was officially opened by New Zealand Prime Minister John Key on 10 October. The first event was a Rugby League Four Nations double header, including matches between England and Papua New Guinea, and Australia and New Zealand.

The 2011 Rugby World Cup commenced on 9 September, with New Zealand defeating Tonga 41 – 10 before a crowd of 60,214. In addition to the opening ceremony and match, five pool games, two quarter-finals, both semi-finals and the final are held at Eden Park, with a cumulative attendance of more than 600,000. New Zealand defeated France 8 – 7 before a crowd of 61,079.
The ground hosted its first game of professional football, with the Wellington Phoenix hosting Adelaide United before a crowd of 20,078.

In 2013 the New Zealand Warriors announced they would be playing three home games at Eden Park in the 2014 NRL season.

The Auckland Council takes over five of the nine spots on the Eden Park Trust Board, giving ratepayers control over the ground.

In 2015, it hosted four matches during the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand including the first semi final between New Zealand and South Africa. The stadium hosted its first day night test match during the English cricket tour in 2018.

In 2020, after 117 years, Eden Park sold week-long naming rights to longtime partner, ASB. As part of their commitment to small business in New Zealand, ASB gifted their naming rights to Coopers Catch, a small fish-and-chip shop from Kaikōura.

===Hosting concerts===
In 2021, Eden Park was granted resource consent to host up to six concerts per year. Eden Park hosted a concert for the first time since 1975, headlined by the band Six60 to a sold-out crowd of about 50,000 attendees. The concert was also one of the biggest concerts in the world at the time, due to COVID-19.

Since then, the stadium has hosted concerts for touring artists and acts including Billy Joel, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Ed Sheeran, Pink, and Travis Scott. Eden Park is currently in the process of applying to double its concert quota to 12 concerts per year.

Coldplay are set to play three sold-out shows at Eden Park in November 2024, the most concerts ever played at the venue for a touring artist.

== Redevelopment ==

===Capacity===
The $256 million redevelopment completed in October 2010 provided a permanent capacity of 50,000 with a further 10,000 temporary seats for the 2011 Rugby World Cup games. This is the largest of any New Zealand sports arena. There are no standing areas. Temporary seating in front of the North Stand and the West Stand (usually only used for international rugby matches) is required for the capacity to be reached. Due to sight-screens and the larger area required for cricket matches, cricket capacity is smaller.

Prior to redevelopment, Eden Park had a crowd capacity of 45,472 for rugby and 42,000 for cricket .

===Expansion===
The redevelopment project included a three-tier South stand replacing the old South and West stands, with a capacity of 24,000, and a three-tier East replacing the Terraces. The number of covered seats increased from 23,000 to 38,000. The redeveloped Eden Park has an internal concourse that allows people to circulate around the grounds inside the stadium, and facilities including food and beverage outlets, toilets and corporate areas were incorporated. The open plan approach to the design and establishment of a community centre and green space, and the removal of the perimeter fence, mean that the stadium has become more publicly accessible and a part of the neighbourhood.

There were public concerns about the height of the new structure and its shading effect on many nearby houses. Auckland City Council received 470 submissions on the resource consent application, over 300 of which were in favour of the redevelopment. On 26 January 2007, Eden Park received resource consent with 91 conditions imposed. The consent permitted the building of new stands in place of the terraces and south stand, but did not include consent for the NZ$385 million &#x27;full option&#x27;, which would have included covered seating.

===Possible alternative stadium for the 2011 Rugby World Cup===
In September 2006 it was announced that instead of Eden Park, the Government and Auckland City Council were assessing the possibility of a new stadium on Auckland&#x27;s waterfront to host the 2011 Rugby World Cup. This assessment was part of the Government&#x27;s formal due diligence process on the decision to redevelop Eden Park. The Government had said it would assist with the funding if a new stadium was built. The Government announced in a report in November 2006 that it would favour a new stadium on the Auckland waterfront, which would have meant that the Eden Park redevelopment would not have gone ahead, and that options for its use or redevelopment would have to be developed. After the Auckland City Council and the Auckland Regional Council differed in their support for the new stadium, the Government changed to supporting the redevelopment of Eden Park, subject to suitable resolution of the design, funding and governance issues.

==Rugby union==

Eden Park is the home ground for the Auckland Blues in Super Rugby and Auckland in the Mitre 10 Cup. The ground regularly hosts All Blacks rugby union test matches. Auckland first used the ground in the 1913 season, and the first international fixture was against South Africa in 1921. The Auckland Blues have used the ground since their foundation in 1996.

The final game of the 1981 Springbok Tour was played at Eden Park. A low-flying Cessna 172 piloted by Marx Jones and Grant Cole dropped flour bombs on the field as part of widespread protests against the tour and apartheid.

Eden Park was used in the inaugural 1987 Rugby World Cup and the 2011 Rugby World Cup, both of which the All Blacks won against France, making it the first ground to host two Rugby World Cup finals.

In late 2015, the ground also hosted a public memorial for legendary All Black wing Jonah Lomu after he died at the age of 40.

It was one of the sites for the 2021 Women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup, including the final.

New Zealand&#x27;s overall Test match record at Eden Park against all nations, updated to 17 August 2024, is as follows:

===Records===

===Rugby World Cup===
Eden Park hosted matches of the 1987 and 2011 Rugby World Cups including hosting the Final on both occasions.

==== 1987 ====
==== 2011 ====
==Cricket==
Eden Park is the home ground for the Auckland cricket team. The ground regularly hosts international fixtures, including Tests, ODIs and Twenty20 Internationals, while the Outer Oval also hosts WODIs, domestic List A and Twenty20 games.

It first hosted a test in 1930. The ground was also the host to New Zealand&#x27;s first Test victory, against West Indies in 1955–56 season. It has also been the scene of a dark day in New Zealand&#x27;s cricket history when on 28 March 1955, the hosts collapsed to their lowest Test score (26 all out) against England.

The ground hosted four matches during the 1992 Cricket World Cup including the semi-final between New Zealand and Pakistan, which Pakistan won by four wickets en route to winning the tournament after Inzamam-ul-Haq&#x27;s 60 off 37 in reply to Black Caps captain Martin Crowe&#x27;s 91. It also hosted four matches during the 2015 Cricket World Cup, which was co-hosted by Australia and New Zealand. The matches played included two pool B games and the pool A clash between co-hosts New Zealand and Australia, which New Zealand won by one wicket via Kane Williamson&#x27;s six off Pat Cummins with 6 required after Mitchell Starc had taken 6 wickets in reply to Trent Boult&#x27;s 5. It also hosted the first semifinal between New Zealand and South Africa, which New Zealand won off the penultimate ball with another six – this time by Grant Elliott off Dale Steyn – to advance to their first Cricket World Cup final.

In 2018, Eden Park hosted the first day-night test in New Zealand, against England. England were bowled out for 58 in the first innings. It took New Zealand only 20.4 overs to dismiss England on the first day of the test match. Trent Boult and Tim Southee took six and four wickets each and bowled unchanged throughout the 20.4 overs. No other bowler was required to bowl. This was just the fourth instance that only 2 bowlers were required to dismiss the opposition since 1920. Five England players were dismissed for a duck. Trent Boult (6/32) picked his career best figures in test cricket. This was his second five wicket haul at Eden Park and his second consecutive five wicket haul in day night test cricket, the first one against Australia in Adelaide in 2015 which was the inaugural day night test.

The highest total set by a team here in Test cricket was by the South African national cricket team against the New Zealand national cricket team when they scored 621/5 dec on 27 Feb 1999. The most runs scored in this ground have been by John Wright (1060 runs), Martin Crowe (712 runs) and Nathan Astle (649 runs). The most wickets have been taken by Richard Hadlee- 45 wickets followed by Chris Cairns-35 wickets and Richard Collinge-29 wickets.

In ODI cricket, the highest total has been set by New Zealand national cricket team against the Australian national cricket team when they scored 340/5 on 18 Feb 2007. The most runs scored in this ground have been by Martin Guptill (818 runs), Martin Crowe (719 runs) and Nathan Astle (705 runs). The most wickets have been taken by Chris Cairns-33 wickets, followed by Chris Harris- 28 wickets.

In May 2018, New Zealand Cricket (NZC) said that the ground is no longer cost-effective or financially viable to host cricket matches, and that they were looking at hosting fixtures at the Western Springs Stadium instead.

The ground is also where famed Indian cricket player Sachin Tendulkar made his debut as an ODI opener. Ahead of the second ODI of the New Zealand-India series at the ground in March 1994, regular opener Navjot Singh Sidhu was ruled out with a stiff neck, opening the way for the 21-year-old Tendulkar&#x27;s promotion. He made 82 off just 49 balls against to steer India to a 7-wicket victory.

It was a site for 2022 Women&#x27;s Cricket World Cup.

==Rugby league==
The biggest rugby league game played at Eden Park was the 1988 World Cup final played on 9 October, giving the venue the distinction of hosting the Union and League World Cup finals in consecutive years. This also sees Eden Park (as of 2018) as the only venue to host the World Cup final for both rugby codes. In a spiteful match in which the New Zealand national rugby league team seemed more intent on dishing out punishment than playing football, the Wally Lewis-led Australians defeated the home side 25–12 after leading 25–0 early in the second half. The game was played in front of a record New Zealand rugby league attendance of 47,363 (only 672 less than attended the 1987 Rugby WCF between the All Blacks and France 16 months earlier). Australia had won the right to host the final, but as international crowds in Australia had been dwindling in recent years due to the Kangaroos dominance (only 15,944 had attended the dead rubber Ashes series test between Australia and Great Britain at the Sydney Football Stadium three months earlier), the Australian Rugby League agreed to New Zealand hosting the game in the interests of promoting international rugby league. Their efforts were rewarded with the largest World Cup final attendance since 1968, when 54,290 saw Australia defeat France at the Sydney Cricket Ground.

Eden Park hosted two matches (a double header) in the 2010 Rugby League Four Nations on 6 November. In the early game, England defeated Papua New Guinea 36–10, with Australia defeating New Zealand 34–20 in the second game. The fixture attracted 44,324 fans. The New Zealand Warriors played the Parramatta Eels in their first NRL match at Eden Park to start the 2011 NRL season in front of a crowd of 38,405 with Parramatta winning 24–18. The Warriors played their first home match of the 2012 season against the Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in a 2011 NRL Grand Final replay, with Manly winning 26–20 in front of 37,502. The 2012 ANZAC Test between Australia and New Zealand was played at Eden Park, with the Kangaroos winning 20–12 in front of 35,399. The Warriors played the Sydney Roosters in Round 2 of the 2013 NRL season, going down 16–14 in front of 32,740.

In 2013 a new faster format of rugby league was announced that it would be held at Eden Park. In 15–16 February 2014, Eden Park held the first ever NRL Auckland Nines tournament.

In 2010, Eden Park hosted its first rugby league internationals since 1988 when it hosted the third round of the 2010 Rugby League Four Nations. In a double header in front of 44,324 fans, England defeated Papua New Guinea 36–10 while Australia defeated New Zealand 34–20.

In 2019 the stadium, upgraded for the 2011 Rugby Union World Cup, hosted a triple header on 2 November. Two games of the Oceania Cup and the first test of the Baskerville Shield between the touring Great Britain Lions and New Zealand. In front of 25,257, Fiji started off by defeating Samoa 44–18. In the second game, New Zealand won for the first time at Eden Park, defeating Great Britain 12–8. Then came rugby league&#x27;s biggest international shock for many years when Tonga defeated reigning and then 11 time World Cup champions Australia 16–12. It was the first time a Tier 2 nation had ever beaten the Kangaroos in a test match.

International rugby league returned to Eden Park in 2023 when the Pacific Championships for both Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s played on the same day, but not in a double header. In the women&#x27;s game New Zealand defeated Tonga 28–10 in front of approximately 10,000 fans. In the later men&#x27;s game, New Zealand routed 2021 World Cup finalist Samoa 50–0 in front of 23,269.

===Rugby League Tests at Eden Park===
==Association football==
Eden Park has hosted four New Zealand men&#x27;s national team games; friendlies against South Africa and FK Austria Wien in 1947 and 1957 respectively, an Olympic qualifier against Israel for the Seoul Olympics in 1988, and most recently a friendly against the Australian Socceroos in 2022. They were defeated in all four games.

On 19 November 2011, Eden Park hosted its first game of professional club football. The A-League regular season fixture between Wellington Phoenix and Adelaide United resulted in a 1–1 draw. The game attracted 20,078, a new attendance record for the Phoenix. The Phoenix returned to Eden Park on 2 February 2013 against long-distance rivals Perth Glory, drawing a crowd of 11,566 to see them win 1–0.

On 23 July 2014, Eden Park hosted English Premiership team West Ham United F.C. The A-League team Wellington Phoenix defeated West Ham 2–1.

The venue hosted several matches of the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup including the opening match in which New Zealand beat Norway 1-0. This was the first ever victory for New Zealand at a men&#x27;s or women&#x27;s FIFA World Cup and was played in front of a record crowd of 42,137, which was the highest attended football match in New Zealand for men or women.

The attendance record was beaten on 1 August 2023 when 42,958 watched the final Group E game between the United States 0–0 draw against Portugal.

The record was beaten for a third time on 5 August 2023 when 43,217 watched the first Round of 16 knockout match which saw Spain beat Switzerland 5-1.

The fourth highest attendance for a football match attended in New Zealand with 41,107, when the United States beat Vietnam 3–0 in the group stages.

The stadium also hosted the final for OFC qualification for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

<doc id="1084636" wikidata="Q4961922" url="?curid=1084636" title="Bret Boone">
<text>Bret Robert Boone (born April 6, 1969) is an American former Major League Baseball second baseman. During his career, Boone was a three-time All-Star, four-time Gold Glove winner, and two-time Silver Slugger Award winner. He is a third-generation professional athlete. His brother is Aaron Boone, manager of the New York Yankees.

==Personal life==
Boone was born in El Cajon, California, to Susan G. Roel and former major league player and manager Bob Boone. He is also the grandson of former major leaguer Ray Boone and brother of former major leaguer and current New York Yankees manager Aaron Boone, as well as a descendant of pioneer Daniel Boone. As a child, Boone hung out in the Phillies clubhouse with Pete Rose Jr., his brother Aaron, Ryan Luzinski, and Mark McGraw.

He is a graduate of El Dorado High School in Placentia, California. Boone attended the University of Southern California and played for the team, but left after his junior year of college when he was drafted by the Seattle Mariners in the fifth round. In 2016 Boone released an autobiography, &quot;Home Game: Big-League Stories from My Life in Baseball&#x27;s First Family&quot;.

==Professional career==

In , Boone became the first-ever third-generation big-leaguer in baseball history. As a member of an All-Star family, he is the son of Bob Boone, a catcher for the Philadelphia Phillies, California Angels, and Kansas City Royals (–) and later a manager with the Royals and Cincinnati Reds; his brother Aaron was a third baseman who has played with the Reds, New York Yankees, Cleveland Indians, Florida Marlins, and Houston Astros, and is now the manager of the Yankees. His grandfather Ray Boone was an infielder for the Indians, Detroit Tigers, Chicago White Sox, Kansas City Athletics, Milwaukee Braves, and Boston Red Sox (–).

===Seattle Mariners===
Boone started his playing career with the Seattle Mariners, where he set the club record for home runs in a season by second baseman in 1993 (12 in 76 games) but was traded that same year to the Cincinnati Reds along with Erik Hanson.

===Cincinnati Reds, Atlanta Braves, and San Diego Padres===

Boone spent the next four seasons with Cincinnati as their everyday second baseman. In his final year with the team, Boone earned his first All-Star Game appearance as a replacement for the injured Sammy Sosa. For his defensive play that year, he was also awarded his first Gold Glove Award.

On the last day of that 1998 season, the Reds helped him make baseball history by starting the only infield ever composed of two sets of brothers - first baseman Stephen Larkin, second baseman Bret Boone, shortstop Barry Larkin, and third baseman Aaron Boone.

An offseason trade sent Boone to the Atlanta Braves, where he contributed to the fifth of what would become eleven consecutive NL East division titles (and eighth of fourteen consecutive titles including three NL West titles before the division realignment) on their way to a World Series appearance. During their postseason run, Boone posted a .370/369/.481 slash line that included a 7 for 14 World Series performance where the Braves ultimately lost in a sweep by the New York Yankees.

Another winter trade sent Boone to the San Diego Padres for the 2000 season, after which he entered free agency.

===Return to Mariners===
In 2001, Boone returned to the Mariners, the organization with which he came up from 1990 to 1993. Now an All-Star, and having averaged 21 home runs a year from 1998 through 2000, twice reaching a career high in doubles (at 38, in 1998 and 1999), Boone&#x27;s superior play continued as he led the league in runs batted in (141), while producing a batting average of (.331). He also broke the Mariners&#x27; team record of home runs for a second baseman with 37, while also hitting 37 doubles.

Boone started in the All-Star Game at Safeco Field, received a Silver Slugger Award, and finished third in the AL MVP voting. His Mariners paced the league with a record 116 wins, earning the AL West championship and advancing to the ALCS, tying the all-time team record for wins in a season with the Chicago Cubs.

The following year, Boone won a Gold Glove Award for his defense and continued to show the power he had demonstrated the previous years, hitting 24 home runs with 34 doubles. On May 2, 2002, Boone and teammate Mike Cameron became the first teammates to each hit two home runs in a single inning, doing so in the first inning against the White Sox. With local media and behind the scenes, he was famous for his humorous behavior. Boone took up three lockers, as Erick Walker notes, &quot;one for him, another with a nameplate above that read &#x27;Boone&#x27;s friend&#x27; and a third with a nameplate that read &#x27;Boone&#x27;s friend&#x27;s friend&#x27; that was scattered with about 100 bats.&quot;

===Minnesota Twins===
He was designated for assignment by the Mariners on July 3, 2005, and later traded on July 11 to Minnesota for cash and a player to be named later (minor league pitcher Andy Baldwin). Minnesota released Boone on August 1 after only 14 games, where the second baseman struggled with a .221 batting average, with seven home runs and 37 RBIs in 88 games for the Mariners and Twins.

===New York Mets===
On January 4, , Boone signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets. He received an invitation to spring training, but on March 1, only a few days into spring training, he announced his initial retirement from baseball, citing a lack of passion for the game.

===Washington Nationals===
On February 18, , Boone came out of retirement and signed a minor league contract with the Washington Nationals. At first he was assigned to the minor league camp, but after five days, he was invited to the team&#x27;s major league spring training camp. On March 21, 2008, Boone was reassigned to minor league camp after hitting .189 and began the season with the Columbus Clippers, the Nationals Triple-A affiliate. He hoped to get signed by a major league club, and left the Clippers in late April to work out on his own. However, on May 28, he once again announced his retirement. On March 9, 2010, he was named manager of the Victoria Seals of the Golden Baseball League. On May 27, 2010, after managing just four games, the Seals announced Boone was leaving the team permanently to deal with &quot;family matters&quot;.

===Legacy===
Bret Boone had his best years as a Seattle Mariner, where he is still a fan favorite. He finished his career with a .266 batting average, 252 home runs, and 1,021 RBIs in 1,780 games in 14 MLB seasons. He was a three-time All-Star and four-time Gold Glove winner, and participated in two Home Run Derbies.

====Steroid controversy====
Jose Canseco, in his book &quot;Juiced&quot;, accused Boone of steroid use, saying that in a 2001 spring training game, he was stunned at Boone&#x27;s physique, and the two chatted about what Boone was taking. However, Boone has denied taking steroids, or having any such conversation with Canseco, pointing out that he never played against Canseco during the 2001 spring training. In fact, Canseco never reached second base in any of the five games the Mariners played the Angels, where the conversation is alleged to have occurred. Canseco was cut by the Angels on March 28.

<doc id="1084640" wikidata="Q1779425" url="?curid=1084640" title="Androcracy">
<text>Androcracy is a form of government in which the government rulers are male. The males, especially fathers, have the central roles of political leadership, moral authority, and control of property. It is also sometimes called a phallocracy or andrarchy or an [[androcentric]] or phallocratic society.

==Example==
Traditionally, influential political positions have been disproportionately occupied by males. With the rise of feminism since the late 19th century, opinions concerning women in politics have changed in a manner that has facilitated an increase in female political participation. Nevertheless, there continues to be a considerable disparity between the percentage of males and females in politics. Currently, women represent 19.4 percent of all parliamentarians in the regions of Europe, the Americas, Sub-Sahara Africa, Asia, the Pacific, the Arab States, and Nordic countries. The level of female participation in parliament varies between regions, ranging from percentages as high as 42 in Nordic countries to as low as 11.4 in Arabic states.

Riane Eisler, in her book &quot;The Chalice and the Blade&quot;, contrasts androcratic male-dominated society with , i.e., partnership society based on gender equality.

Gylany is balanced and equalitarian, and should not be confused with gynocracy or matriarchy, which define the ancient systems where women ruled without hierarchy and lineage was matricentral.

==Gender bias==
Androcracy as a gender bias may influence the decision-making process in many countries. Kleinberg and Boris point to a dominant paradigm which promotes wage-earning fathers with financially dependent mothers, the exclusion of same-sex couples, and the marginalization of single-parent families.

==Gynocracy==

The opposite of androcracy is gynocracy, or rule by women. It is related to but not synonymous with matriarchy. Evidence indicating historical gynocracies survives mostly in mythology and in some archaeological records, although it is disputed by some authors, like Cynthia Eller in her book &quot;The Myth of Matriarchal Prehistory&quot;.

<doc id="1084642" wikidata="Q2061242" url="?curid=1084642" title="Pretty on the Inside">
<text>Pretty on the Inside is the debut studio album by American alternative rock band Hole, released on September 17, 1991, in the United States on Caroline Records. Produced by Sonic Youth&#x27;s Kim Gordon, and Gumball frontman Don Fleming, the album was Hole&#x27;s first major label release after the band&#x27;s formation in 1989 by vocalist, songwriter, and guitarist Courtney Love and lead guitarist Eric Erlandson.

Blending elements of punk rock, the album features distorted and alternating guitar compositions, screaming vocals from Love, and &quot;sloppy punk ethics&quot;, a style which the band would later distance themselves from, opting for a less abrasive sound on subsequent releases. Love&#x27;s lyrics on the album are often presented in an abstract narrative form, and describe disparate scenes of graphic violence, death, and female sexuality. The record was dedicated to Rob Ritter of the Los Angeles punk rock acts the Bags and the Gun Club.

Upon release, &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; was well-received by alternative music critics, garnering favorable reviews that drew comparisons to the works of Black Sabbath and Patti Smith. It was met with considerable commercial success in the United Kingdom, where the record&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Teenage Whore&quot;, entered the UK Indie Chart at number one in September 1991. It has sold over 200,000 copies in the United States and gained a contemporary cult following among punk rock fans, and has been cited as a seminal influence for songwriters and musicians such as Brody Dalle and Scout Niblett. Despite its critical acclaim, frontwoman Courtney Love went on to refer to the album as &quot;unlistenable&quot; in later years, though her stance on it eventually shifted, as she commented in 2021 that she had &quot;really put the album down,&quot; and that making it was a &quot;transformative&quot; experience for her. Vinyl LP versions of the album have been reissued several times.

==Background==
Hole formed in 1989 in Los Angeles, California when frontwoman Courtney Love, after years of fruitless attempts at forming bands, bought her neighbor Lisa Roberts a bass and posted an advertisement in a local paper stating: &quot;I want to start a band. My influences are Big Black, Sonic Youth, and Fleetwood Mac.&quot; Eric Erlandson, along with over a dozen other musicians, answered the ad. Love later said that she knew Eric was &quot;the one&quot; as soon as they met, and that he had a &quot;Thurston Moore quality about him&quot; that she liked.

Erlandson said that early in Hole&#x27;s career, they were more interested in &quot;making noise&quot; than achieving success and before drummer Caroline Rue joined the band that they used no percussion whatsoever. It was not until Love and Erlandson heard Mudhoney&#x27;s &quot;Touch Me I&#x27;m Sick&quot; that they began to think about taking the band to the next level. Early on, the band was most influenced by the New York No Wave art and music scene of the 1980s, which included visual artists, such as Richard Kern, as well as scuzz rock acts, such as Teenage Jesus and the Jerks, Sonic Youth, and Pussy Galore. The band also featured a rhythm guitarist in its early days, Mike Geisbrecht. After the band&#x27;s first four shows, Geisbrecht and Roberts departed from the band. Hole recruited bassist Jill Emery in 1990, and the band remained a quartet instead of replacing Geisbrecht.

In the documentary film &quot;Not Bad for a Girl&quot;, Love, who had been in the erotic dancing industry for years prior, said that she worked as a stripper to help support the band in its early incarnation. She also cited her work as a dancer as being one of many inspirations for the songs on &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot;: &quot;I was blonde, wore makeup, had to support my band by dancing, and had to play this ridiculous archetype at work ... so I took, you know, high heels and white pumps, and I had a wiglet—I just took that and messed with it.&quot;

==Recording and production==

Hole had previously released two singles, &quot;Retard Girl&quot; on Sympathy for the Record Industry and &quot;Dicknail&quot; on Sub Pop. According to Love, she had initially wanted to release the album on Sympathy for the Record Industry, but was &quot;talked into&quot; signing on with Caroline Records. After signing, Love sought Sonic Youth&#x27;s Kim Gordon to produce the album. In January 1991, Love sent her a letter, a Hello Kitty barrette, and copies of the band&#x27;s early singles, mentioning that the band greatly admired Gordon&#x27;s work and appreciated &quot;the production of the SST record&quot; (referring to Sonic Youth&#x27;s &quot;EVOL&quot; or &quot;Sister&quot;). Gordon agreed on the condition that her friend, Gumball frontman Don Fleming, assist.
The band entered Music Box Studios in Los Angeles with Gordon and Fleming in March 1991, and worked on the album for one week; the songs were recorded over a period of four days, and were mixed over the course of a further three days. During the recording sessions for the album, Love purportedly gargled whiskey and excessively smoked cigarettes before takes to give a raw edge to her vocals.

Fleming stated he was impressed by Love&#x27;s &quot;focus and intensity&quot;, especially while recording vocals for one song when Love &quot;literally ripped her clothes off while she sang&quot;. &quot;Courtney was amazing&quot;, said Fleming. &quot;She was the most gung-ho person I&#x27;ve ever met. She was going to make the greatest record ever—I like that attitude in the studio. Courtney was like &#x27;Let&#x27;s go, fuckers&#x27;, and I loved that.&quot; In a later interview, Fleming said: Courtney was great at the time—it was before she even knew Kurt [Cobain]. She gave 180%. I&#x27;ve worked with some people that you&#x27;ve had to coax the performance out of them. With Courtney, there was no attitude. She was gonna give it all. And she did and it was really impressive to me ... I loved the whole band; they were a lot of fun. That early lineup of Hole—I felt they were the real deal. They were Hollywood misfits—all of them. I felt it really captured what they were.

Gordon said that Love &quot;was either charming and nice or screaming at her band&quot; but that she was &quot;a really good singer and entertainer and front person.&quot;

From her own recollection, Love said that the recording sessions lasted &quot;about a week...  Eric was in charge of the [guitar] tones, and I just did whatever the fuck I wanted.&quot; According to Rue, Gordon encouraged the band to freely improvise in the studio, which resulted in the recording of several tracks that appear on the album, such as &quot;Sassy&quot;. Rue injured her finger on a diecast rim while recording the song, and ceased her drumming; Love is heard in the track saying &quot;sit back down, sit back down&quot; in response to Rue standing up from her drum kit.

==Composition==
===Music and arrangements===
The music of &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; has been noted by critics for its abrasive instrumentation and arrangements, often with melodies &quot;buried&quot; underneath. The album&#x27;s sonic elements are heavily influenced by Los Angeles hardcore punk as well as New York&#x27;s no wave scene; many of the tracks are accompanied by overt use of feedback, experimental playing, wah pedals, and use of sampling and interpolation. Rapid sliding techniques and string muting are also heavily present on the album, as well as what Love and Erlandson describe as &quot;Sonic Youth tunings&quot;. Love&#x27;s vocals range from whispers to violent screaming, often in succession with the extreme shifts in speed and volume.
Drummer Caroline Rue described the band&#x27;s songwriting process as collaborative and organic; she stated that she wrote her own drum parts in response to Love&#x27;s guitar playing and lyrics, adding that Love never gave her direction or requested that she make changes to her drumming approach.

The album contains numerous musical references to other musicians and songs, specifically in &quot;Sassy&quot; and &quot;Starbelly&quot;: The guitar riff featured in &quot;Starbelly&quot; is based on Neil Young&#x27;s &quot;Cinnamon Girl&quot; and features analog cassette excerpts from &quot;Rhiannon&quot; by Fleetwood Mac and an early recording of &quot;Best Sunday Dress&quot; by Pagan Babies, one of Love&#x27;s earlier bands with Kat Bjelland; &quot;Sassy&quot; includes snippets from an angry message left by Nymphs singer Inger Lorre on Love&#x27;s answering machine, accompanied by a singular chord progression repeated throughout. Love has admitted that the main riff to &quot;Mrs. Jones&quot; was copied verbatim from &quot;Dark Entries&quot; by the goth rock group Bauhaus, one of her favorite bands as a teenager.

In a 1991 Canadian television interview, Love commented on the album&#x27;s coarse musical structure. She said that since the band was from Los Angeles, the &quot;metal capital of the US&quot;, they thought they were making a &quot;pop record with an edge&quot;, and were surprised by people&#x27;s reactions when they were told it was violent and extreme. Love added, &quot;It was all about the expression of my experience. I was not coming from a black void; I was trying to create light ... I was trying to heal.&quot; In an interview with &quot;Spin&quot; magazine several years after its release, Love said that she was &quot;posing in a lot of ways&quot; with the album: &quot;It was the truth, but it was also me catching up with all my hip peers who&#x27;d gone all indie on me, and who made fun of me for liking R.E.M. and The Smiths. I&#x27;d done the whole punk thing, sleeping on floors in piss and beer, and waking up with the guy with the fucking mohawk and the skateboards and the speed and the whole goddamned thing. But I hated it. I&#x27;d grown out of it by the time I was seventeen.&quot; In a 1994 interview with Kurt Loder, Love admitted to having been &quot;consciously self-conscious&quot; when making the record due to her feeling the need to compete with her peers at the time.

In the 2011 documentary &quot;Hit So Hard&quot;, based on Hole&#x27;s 1994–98 drummer Patty Schemel, Love referred to &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; as &quot;unlistenable&quot;. &quot;That record was a calling card for rock critics and hardcorers&quot;, Love said. &quot;[It was me saying] &quot;This is what I do, and I&#x27;m not going to back down from it. I am announcing my persona as a cunt.&quot;&quot;

===Lyrical content===

Many of the album&#x27;s lyrics are narrative and diaristic in nature, and were heavily drawn from Love&#x27;s personal life and experiences in her teenage and young adult years. In a press release promoting the album, Love said: &quot;These songs are about my own weaknesses and impurities; things about myself that I hate ... paranoias, petty concerns, and pithy, pathetic things that are inside of me.&quot; Many of the songs are lyrically abstract and describe shocking scenes of violence. Recurrent themes discussed in the lyrics include elitism, beauty and self-image, abortion, prostitution, suicide, murder, &quot;red lights&quot;, and self-destructiveness. &quot;Q&quot;″s Peter Kane described the lyrics on the record as &quot;confrontational&quot; and &quot;genuinely uninhibited&quot;.

Hannah Levin of the Seattle publication &quot;The Stranger&quot; analyzed the lyrics to the track &quot;Mrs. Jones&quot;, calling it a &quot;particularly rattling sketch of what appears to be a rape scene, with Love seamlessly handling three perspectives: the ugly attacker (&quot;Look into the bloodrot, you suicide bitch / It takes an hour with you to make me want to live&quot;), the vengeful victim (&quot;The abortion left an abscess / Don&#x27;t ever talk to me like that again&quot;), and the supportive narrator (&quot;Just like a pro, she takes off her dress / And she kicks you down in her snow white pumps&quot;).&quot; The song also quotes the Rudyard Kipling poem &quot;The Ballad of East and West&quot;.

&quot;Garbadge Man&quot;, discusses abandonment and alienation, as well as crisis of spirituality, and is one of the few songs on the album to feature a verse–chorus–verse composition. The album closes with two songs that are bridged together as a single piece: &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot;, noted for its hostile lyrics and allusions to vanity, and &quot;Clouds&quot;, a dark and raucous cover of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot; from her 1969 album &quot;Clouds&quot;. The cover of the song features altered lyrics that appear to illustrate a suicide scene.

According to drummer Caroline Rue, Love wrote the lyrics of &quot;Babydoll&quot; about Madonna, whom she had seen driving in Los Angeles in a Mercedes-Benz, hence the lyric referring to a &quot;Nazi car&quot;.

In a 1991 interview with Everett True, Love stated &quot;I try to place [beautiful imagery] next to fucked up imagery, because that&#x27;s how I view things&quot; and that &quot;I sometimes feel that no one&#x27;s taken the time to write about certain things in rock, that there&#x27;s a certain female point of view that&#x27;s never been given space.&quot; In spite of the album&#x27;s graphic lyrics, though, the underlying female themes in many of its songs led some journalists to tag the band as being part of the riot grrl movement, which Love was not directly associated with.

==Artwork==
 The album artwork for &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; features a saturated pink press photo of the band amidst forest underbrush, taken by photographer Vickie Berndt. Berndt said that &quot;Courtney wanted something striking and unusual&quot; and Berndt was experimenting with color infrared film during the shoot, testing exposure settings with Love. The photo is similar to several others taken during the same shoot, one of which was featured in a &quot;Spin&quot; article in 1991.

The font design featured on the front cover was created by Pizz, a graphic artist from Long Beach, who also designed album cover art for several other indie rock bands. The back side of the album features a painting by bassist Emery, depicting a topless woman looking at herself through a hand mirror. On her chest is a red heart surrounded by arrows, and below, her ribs protrude from her sides.

The interior artwork (displayed in a booklet on the CD version of the album and on the record sleeve on vinyl releases), features an assemblage of scribbled and typewritten lyrics, personal &quot;thank you&quot; notes, cutouts of Catholic and Renaissance artwork, as well as childlike drawings and storybook pictures juxtaposed with photos of women in bondage. Love was banned from the Los Angeles Public Library for cutting out photos from library books to create the inlay artwork, which she said in retrospect, &quot;I would never recommend that anyone&quot; do. In a 2003 article published in &quot;The Stranger&quot;, the album&#x27;s liner notes were likened to &quot;the scrapbook of an incest victim&quot;. In the liner notes, the album is dedicated to Rob Ritter of the Los Angeles punk group the Bags.

==Release==
===Promotion===
&quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; was released on September 17, 1991, in the United States on Caroline Records and on City Slang in Europe. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Teenage Whore&quot;, was released in Europe on September 9, and entered the UK Indie Chart&#x27;s &quot;Top 10&quot; at number one on September 28, 1991, beating out &quot;Heaven Sent An Angel&quot; by Revolver, &quot;Let It Slide&quot; by Mudhoney, and &quot;Love to Hate You&quot; by Erasure, among others. On &quot;The Chart Show&quot; on Channel 4, the song&#x27;s title was censored with ellipsis in place of the word &quot;whore&quot;. The single&#x27;s success in the United Kingdom led the band to perform a twelve-date tour of the country supporting Mudhoney. The subsequent success of both the album, single, and tour saw Hole embark on a further three tours of the United States, Germany and Western Europe in the latter half of 1991, playing again with Mudhoney, as well as alternative rock acts Daisy Chainsaw and Therapy?. While the album gained traction in the United Kingdom, it failed to chart in the United States despite extensive touring, though it was known to be outselling Nirvana&#x27;s output before the band&#x27;s release of &quot;Nevermind&quot; the following week.

On December 19, 1991, the band played their final show of the tour in Hollywood at the Whisky a Go Go opening for The Smashing Pumpkins, which ended with Love smashing her guitar headstock onstage at the end of their set after lukewarm reception from the audience. &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; journalist David Cromelin noted in his review of the concert: Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; singer-guitarist Billy Corgan referred to himself as &quot;a frustrated Midwestern youth&quot; at the Whisky on Tuesday ... Smashing Pumpkins was preceded by smashing guitars, courtesy of Hole. The tortured, transfixing L.A. group&#x27;s pairing with the headliners should have made this a bill to remember, but the audience was primed for Pumpkin and didn&#x27;t take to Courtney Love&#x27;s powerful howls of anguish. Hole ended its set in a tantrum, as Love ordered the band to halt and hurled her guitar to the ground. Guitarist Eric Erlandson finished things off by demolishing his instrument with a few impressive swings. Frustrated Midwestern youth, meet frustrated California youth.

The same evening, Joe Cole, a roadie and friend of the band, filmed their live set with Henry Rollins of Black Flag. After the show, while en route to his Venice Beach apartment with Rollins, Cole was murdered in an armed robbery. Hole would dedicate their second record, &quot;Live Through This&quot;, to Cole in 1994.

After Hole&#x27;s 1991 tour concluded, a music video for the track &quot;Garbadge Man&quot; was released, though the album&#x27;s only single, &quot;Teenage Whore&quot;, did not receive a music video. The video is fairly abstract and a reflection of Hole&#x27;s no wave influence at the time, with shots of Love and other band members in a car interspersed with shots of them performing outside the window. According to Love, she tracked down original rolls of radiographic medical film from Denver, Colorado, that had been used in the Vietnam War, which the music video was then shot on, giving the images an X-ray-like appearance. The video was shown on MTV&#x27;s &quot;120 Minutes&quot; in 1992 during an interview with Love and Kim Gordon, and was broadcast again on the show in 1994 and 1995 but was never as popular as the band&#x27;s later videos. For the music video, an alternate mix of the song by Gordon was used to eliminate profanity.

The album was released on CD and cassette in the United States, but received a release on vinyl LP throughout Europe by City Slang, based in Berlin, Germany. The first 3,000 pressings of the LP featured blue vinyl, while the following pressings were in standard black.

==Critical reception==
===Contemporaneous===
&quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; was received with acclaim by many British and American alternative press. In a review by Edwin Pouncey for &quot;NME&quot;, the album was positively compared to Patti Smith&#x27;s &quot;Horses&quot;, as well as the debut albums of the Ramones, Television, and New York Dolls, and was branded as being in &quot;a class of its own&quot;, while Elizabeth Wurtzel wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that &quot;&quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; is such a cacophony ... very few people are likely to get through it once, let alone give it the repeated listenings it needs for you to discover that it&#x27;s probably the most compelling album to have been released in 1991.&quot;

Simon Reynolds of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described the album as &quot;a cauldron of negativity... [the band] grind[s] out torturous sound, vaguely redolent of Black Sabbath... Ms. Love&#x27;s songs explore the full spectrum of female emotions, from vulnerability to rage. The songs are fueled by adolescent traumas, feelings of disgust about the body, passionate friendships with women and the desire to escape domesticity. Her lyrical style could be described as emotional nudism.&quot; Jonathan Gold of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; similarly noted that the lyrics present &quot;a terrifying emotional landscape, closer to Kathy Acker novels than to anything you might think of as pop&quot; and praised Love&#x27;s vocals as &quot;astonishingly expressive&quot; and ranging from &quot;howling rage to the sort of sardonic sneer associated with the Fall’s Mark Smith...  Whether it wanted one or not, the decade finally has an equivalent of Patti Smith’s &quot;Horses&quot;. Play it loud. &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; is about as pretty as a flayed wound.&quot; Gold later commented: &quot;If &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; were a horror movie, it would be all the parts that you have to look at through your fingers.&quot; &quot;LA Weekly&quot;″s Lorraine Ali echoed a similar sentiment about the album&#x27;s harsh nature, describing it as a &quot;slithering nest of ugly thoughts and horrific admissions too intriguing to pass up.&quot;
&quot;Spin&quot;″s Daisy von Furth noted a lyrical preoccupation with &quot;the repulsive aspects of L.A.— superficiality, sexism, violence, and drugs. Love is the embodiment of what drives the band: the dichotomy of pretty/ugly ... The pretty/ugly dynamic also comes across in Hole&#x27;s music ... a song like &quot;Teenage Whore&quot; at first comes across like a ranting noisy rage, but underneath is a surprisingly lush melody.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; ranked it among the 20 best albums of the year in December 1991. &quot;Melody Maker&quot; columnist Sharon O&#x27;Connell wrote that the album was &quot;the very best bit of fucked-up rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll [I&#x27;ve heard] all year,&quot; while Deborah Frost of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called it &quot;genre-defying&quot;, taking note of Love&#x27;s reputation on the album as &quot;the girl who won&#x27;t shut up ... She is all the things that she should not be, and she shoves it, raw, right in your face.&quot; Hannah Levin of the Seattle publication &quot;The Stranger&quot; praised the album&#x27;s production by Gordon and Fleming, stating that &quot;despite &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot;&#x27;s reputation as an unhinged, raw-sounding debut, a great deal of professional calculation went into putting this record together.&quot; Levin also applauded Love&#x27;s lyrics, writing that the album &quot;judiciously toes the line between the evasively obtuse and overtly obscene&quot;.

In a 1994 article, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist David Fricke called the album &quot;gloriously assaultive&quot; and &quot;a classic of sex-mad self-laceration, hypershred guitars and full-moon bawling ... in particular the spectacular goring of Joni Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;Both Sides, Now&quot; (aka &quot;Clouds&quot;) at the end of the record. You don&#x27;t really know the solitary despair at the core of that song until you&#x27;ve heard Love&#x27;s embittered delivery of the last two lines — &quot;It&#x27;s life&#x27;s illusions I recall / I really don&#x27;t know life at all&quot; — over guitarist Eric Erlandson&#x27;s fading squall.&quot; In 1995, &quot;Alternative Press&quot; magazine ranked the album at No. 74 in their &quot;Top 99 Of &#x27;85–&#x27;95&quot; list, noting that &quot;Love works in extremes and wears that scarlet letter when she feels like it, and when she doesn&#x27;t she rips it off, never neglecting melody and language as the real medium for her message.&quot; Wendy Brandes of CNN, while reviewing Hole&#x27;s third release, &quot;Celebrity Skin&quot;, in 1998, described &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; as &quot;the musical equivalent of scrubbing one&#x27;s eardrums with sandpaper&quot;.

===Retrospective===
Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave the album a notably mixed review at AllMusic, calling the album &quot;brutally uncompromising&quot;, and further noting: &quot;The jagged white noise and buzzing guitars articulate Courtney Love&#x27;s pent-up rage as well as her lyrics, and while that might make the album difficult to absorb in one sitting, it also makes it a singular achievement.&quot; Music historian Andrew Earles referred to the album as &quot;brick-heavy...a crushing mix of Mudhoney at its finest, sludge-metal, Sonic Youth, and Love&#x27;s terrifying but also moving vocal performance.&quot; &quot;PopMatters&quot; reviewed the album in 2009, noting that it has &quot;bold musical splendour on display&quot; that &quot;[leaves one feeling] nothing short of gobsmacked&quot;.

In a 2015 retrospective assessment, &quot;Spin&quot; noted the album&#x27;s overt noise rock influences, writing that it &quot;played like AmRep release&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; has had an influence on multiple alternative rock acts, being specifically mentioned by Spinnerette/The Distillers frontwoman Brody Dalle in an interview as a seminal album in the development of her music. British rock band Nine Black Alps also noted the album as a major influence on their third release, &quot;Locked Out from the Inside&quot; (2009), and indie singer-songwriter Scout Niblett cited it as a major influence on her: &quot;For me, the thing that I loved about them and her [Courtney Love] was the anger, and aggressiveness, along with the tender side&quot;, said Niblett. &quot;That was something I hadn&#x27;t seen before in a woman playing music. That was hugely influential and really inspiring. Women up &#x27;til then were kind of one-dimensional, twee, sweet, ethereal, and that annoys the shit out of me.&quot;

Contemporarily, the album has also gained a cult following among rock and punk music fans.

&quot;The Trouser Press Guide to &#x27;90s Rock&quot; called the album a &quot;surly milkshake of broken rock shards ... from the artistic misspellings of song titles to the lyric collage on the inner sleeve and the abrasive, abstract guitar noises on the songs, &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; reveals the band&#x27;s fascination with the New York no wave art and music scene of the &#x27;80s.&quot; According to &quot;Billboard&quot;, the album had sold 27,000 copies by 1994, when the band released their wildly popular follow-up album, &quot;Live Through This&quot;.

In more recent years, frontwoman Love stated that the album contains &quot;nothing melodic&quot;. In a 2011 interview for &quot;Hit So Hard&quot; (2011), a documentary on later Hole drummer Patty Schemel, Love referred to &quot;Pretty on the Inside&quot; as &quot;unlistenable&quot;, going on to say: &quot;That record was a calling card for rock critics and hardcorers, [saying] &#x27;This is what I do, and I am not going to back down from it. I am announcing my persona as a cunt. Thank you very much.&#x27;&quot; Love&#x27;s attitude toward the album shifted in the subsequent years, as she commented in 2021: &quot;I&#x27;ve really put that record down as being beneath my songwriting capacity, but I really don&#x27;t put it down anymore at all, because it was so transformative.&quot;

In October 2016, lead guitarist Eric Erlandson oversaw an orchestral live performance of the entire album in Los Angeles, entitled &quot;Pretty Looking Back&quot;.

==Track listing==

On October 20, 2017, a second reissue of the LP was released by Plain Recordings, pressed on pink vinyl.

<doc id="1084643" wikidata="Q3330969" url="?curid=1084643" title="Bishopsgate mutiny">
<text>The Bishopsgate mutiny occurred in April 1649 when soldiers of Colonel Edward Whalley&#x27;s regiment of the New Model Army refused to obey orders and leave London. At the end of the mutiny one soldier, a supporter of the Levellers, Robert Lockyer, was executed by firing squad.

In January 1649 Charles I of England was tried and executed for treason against the people. In February the Grandees (senior officers) banned petitions to Parliament by soldiers. In March eight Leveller troopers went to the Commander-in-Chief of the New Model Army, Lord Thomas Fairfax, and demanded the restoration of the right to petition. Five of them were cashiered out of the army.

300 infantrymen of Colonel John Hewson&#x27;s regiment, who declared that they would not serve in Ireland until the Leveller programme had been realised, were cashiered without arrears of pay, which was the threat that had been used to quell the Corkbush Field mutiny.

When soldiers of the regiment of Colonel Edward Whalley stationed in Bishopsgate, London made similar demands they were ordered out of London. They refused to go, fearing that once outside the City of London they too would be given the choice of obey or be cashiered without arrears of pay. The mutineers surrendered after a personal appeal by Fairfax and Oliver Cromwell. Fifteen soldiers were arrested and court martialed, of whom six were sentenced to death. Five were pardoned but Robert Lockyer, a former Agitator within the regiment, was executed by firing squad in front of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral on April 27, 1649.

Like the funeral of Colonel Thomas Rainsborough the previous year, Lockyer&#x27;s funeral was a massive Leveller-led demonstration in London, with thousands of mourners wearing the Levellers&#x27; ribbons of sea-green and bunches of rosemary for remembrance in their hats.

<doc id="1084650" wikidata="Q3393556" url="?curid=1084650" title="Decline and modernization of the Ottoman Empire">
<text>In the late 18th century, the Ottoman Empire faced threats on numerous frontiers from multiple industrialised European powers. In response, the Empire initiated a period of internal reform to centralize and standardise governance across its interconnected provinces, attempting to bring itself into competition with the expanding West.
The period of these reforms is known as the Tanzimat, and led to the end of the Old Regime period. Despite the Ottoman empire&#x27;s precarious international position, the central state was significantly strengthened. The process of reforming and modernization in the empire began with the declaration of the Nizam-I Cedid (New Order) during the reign of Sultan Selim III and was punctuated by several reform decrees, such as the Hatt-ı Şerif of Gülhane in 1839 and the Hatt-ı Hümayun in 1856. Over the course of the 19th century, the Ottoman state became increasingly powerful and rationalized, exercising a greater degree of influence over its population than in any previous era. 

Despite these attempts at revitalisation, the empire could not stem the rising tide of nationalism, especially among the ethnic minorities in its Balkan provinces, where the newly implemented administrative and infrastructural reforms often intensified local tensions and nationalist movements rather than alleviating them. Numerous revolts and wars of independence, together with repeated incursions by Russia in the northeast and France (and later Britain) in the North African eyalets, resulted in a steady loss of territories throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.

By 1908, the Ottoman military became modernized and professionalized along the lines of Western European armies. The period was followed by the defeat and dissolution of the Ottoman Empire (1908–1922).

== Main issues of the period ==
The rise of nationalism swept through many countries during the 19th century, and it affected territories within the Ottoman Empire. A burgeoning national consciousness, together with a growing sense of ethnic nationalism, made nationalistic thought one of the most significant ideas imported to the Ottoman Empire. The empire was forced to deal with nationalism from both within and beyond its borders. The number of revolutionary, secret societies which turned into political parties during the next period rose dramatically. Uprisings in Ottoman territory had many far-reaching consequences during the 19th century and determined much of the Ottoman policy during the early 20th century. Much of the Ottoman ruling elite questioned whether the policies of the state were to blame: some felt that the sources of ethnic conflict were external and unrelated to issues of governance. While this era was not without some successes, the ability of the Ottoman state to have any effect on ethnic uprisings was seriously called into question.

The Russian extension in this century developed with the main theme of supporting the independence of the Ottomans&#x27; former provinces, and then bringing all of the Slav peoples of the Balkans under Bulgaria or using Armenians in the east to set the stage. At the end of the century, from the Russian perspective, Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro and the autonomy of Bulgaria were achieved. That alarmed the Great Powers. After the Congress of Berlin, the Russian expansion was controlled by stopping the expansion of Bulgaria. The Russian public felt that at the end of Congress of Berlin thousands of Russian soldiers had died for nothing. 

The military of the Ottoman Empire remained an effective fighting force until the second half of the 18th century when it suffered a catastrophic defeat against Russia in the 1768-74 war. Selim III came to the throne with an ambitious effort for military reforms in 1789. He failed and was replaced by Mahmud II in 1808 who established martial law through Alemdar Mustafa Pasha. At first, he allied with the Janissaries to break the power of the provincial governors and then turned on the Janissaries and removed them altogether during the 1826 Auspicious Incident. Efforts for a new system (1826–1858) began following the Auspicious Incident.

Economic historian Paul Bairoch argues that free trade contributed to deindustrialization in the Ottoman Empire. In contrast to the protectionism of China, Japan, and Spain, the Ottoman Empire had a liberal trade policy, open to foreign imports. This policy had its origins in the capitulations of the Ottoman Empire, dating back to the first commercial treaties signed with France in 1536 and taken further with capitulations in 1673 and 1740, which lowered duties to 3% for imports and exports. The liberal Ottoman policies were praised by British economists such as John Ramsay McCulloch in his &quot;Dictionary of Commerce&quot; (1834), but later criticized by British politicians such as Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli, who cited the Ottoman Empire as &quot;an instance of the injury done by unrestrained competition&quot; in the 1846 Corn Laws debate:

The Ottoman public debt loomed large during this period. The Empire had previously not taken foreign loans. But with the demands of the Crimean War, the Empire took its first loans in 1854 . The public debt quickly ballooned, becoming larger than any other European nation&#x27;s. The Panic of 1873 depressed the economy, and was followed by poor harvests. The Ottomans found themselves unable to repay the loans, and so defaulted on their debt in 1875. The Ottomans owed their loans to various European countries and their citizens, who were deeply upset at the failure of their investment and lobbied their governments to intervene. This effort became the Ottoman Public Debt Administration, which grew to become a major and independent arm of the Ottoman bureaucracy, whose sole goal was providing returns to European creditors.

The stagnation and reform of the Ottoman Empire (1683–1827) ended with the dismemberment of Ottoman Classical Army. The issue during the decline and modernization of the Ottoman Empire (1828–1908) was to create a military (a security apparatus) that could win wars and bring security to its subjects. That goal took multiple Sultans with multiple reorganizations during this period. At the end of this period, with the Second Constitutional Era in 1908, Ottoman military became modernized and professionalized in the form of European Armies.

== Modernization 1808–1839 ==
=== 1808–1839 Mahmud II ===

Mahmud II had to deal with multiple issues inherited from generations past. These issues lasted all through his reign. Shortly, the Eastern Question with Russia, England, and France, and military problems arising from mutinous Janissaries and factious Ulemas. He also faced numerous internal conflicts with Egyptians, Wahabbis, Serbians, Albanians, Greeks, and Syrians, and had administrative problems from rebellious Pashas, who would fain have founded new kingdoms on the ruins of the House of Osman.

Mahmud understood the growing problems of the state and the approaching overthrow of the monarchy and began to deal with the problems as he saw them. For example, he closed the Court of Confiscations, and took away much of the power of the Pashas. He personally set an example of reform by regularly attending the Divan, or state council. The practice of the sultan&#x27;s avoiding the Divan had been introduced two centuries prior, during the reign of Suleiman I, and was considered to be one of the causes of the decline of the Empire. Mahmud II also addressed some of the worst abuses connected with the Vakifs, by placing their revenues under state administration. However, he did not venture to apply this vast mass of property to the general purposes of the government.

==== Serbs, 1810s ====
In 1804 the Serbian Revolution against Ottoman rule erupted in the Balkans, running in parallel with the Napoleonic invasion. By 1817, when the revolution ended, Serbia was raised to the status of self-governing monarchy under nominal Ottoman suzerainty. In 1821 the First Hellenic Republic became the first Balkan country to achieve its independence from the Ottoman Empire. It was officially recognized by the Porte in 1829, after the end of the Greek War of Independence.

==== Greeks, 1820s ====

In 1814, a secret organization called the Filiki Eteria was founded with the aim of liberating Greece. The Filiki Eteria planned to launch revolts in the Peloponnese, the Danubian Principalities, and capital with its surrounding areas. The first of these revolts began on 6 March 1821 in the Danubian Principalities which was put down by the Ottomans. On 17 March 1821, the Maniots declared war which was the start of revolutionary actions from other controlled states. In October 1821, Theodoros Kolokotronis had captured Tripolitsa, followed by other revolts in Crete, Macedonia, and Central Greece. Tensions soon developed among different Greek factions, leading to two consecutive civil wars. Mehmet Ali of Egypt agreed to send his son Ibrahim Pasha to Greece with an army to suppress the revolt in return for territorial gain. By the end of 1825, most of the Peloponnese was under Egyptian control, and the city of Missolonghi was put under siege and fell in April 1826. Ibrahim had succeeded in suppressing most of the revolt in the Peloponnese and Athens had been retaken. Russia, Britain and France decided to intervene in the conflict and each nation sent a navy to Greece. Following news that combined Ottoman–Egyptian fleets were going to attack the Greek island of Hydra, the allied fleet intercepted the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet in the battle of Navarino. Following a week-long standoff, a battle began which resulted in the destruction of the Ottoman–Egyptian fleet. With the help of a French expeditionary force proceeded to the captured part of Central Greece by 1828.

The Greek War of Independence saw the beginning of the spread of the Western notion of nationalism, stimulated the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire, and eventually caused the breakdown of the Ottoman &quot;millet&quot; concept. Unquestionably, the concept of nationhood prevalent in the Ottoman Empire was different from the current one as it was centered on religion.

==== The Auspicious Incident, 1826 ====

Mahmud II&#x27;s most notable achievements include the abolition of the Janissary corps in 1826, the establishment of a modern Ottoman army, and the preparation of the Tanzimat reforms in 1839. By 1826, the sultan was ready to move against the Janissary in favor of a more modern military. Mahmud II incited them to revolt on purpose, describing it as the sultan&#x27;s &quot;coup against the Janissaries&quot;. The sultan informed them, through a fatwa, that he was forming a new army, organized and trained along modern European lines. As predicted, they mutinied, advancing on the sultan&#x27;s palace. In the ensuing fight, the Janissary barracks were set in flames by artillery fire resulting in 4,000 Janissary fatalities. The survivors were either exiled or executed, and their possessions were confiscated by the Sultan. This event is now called the Auspicious Incident. The last of the Janissaries were then put to death by decapitation in what was later called the Blood Tower, in Thessaloniki.

These marked the beginning of modernization and had immediate effects such as introducing European-style clothing, architecture, legislation, institutional organization, and land reform.

==== Russia, 1828–1829 ====
The Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829 did not give him time to organize a new army, and the Sultan was forced to use these young and undisciplined recruits in the fight against the veterans of the Tsar. The war was brought to a close by the disastrous Treaty of Adrianople. While the reforms in question were mainly implemented to improve the military, the most notable development that arose out of these efforts was a series of schools teaching everything from math to medicine to train new officers.

==== Egypt, 1830s ====

Later in his reign, Mahmud became involved in disputes with the Wāli of Egypt and Sudan, Muhammad Ali, who was technically Mahmud&#x27;s vassal. The Sultan had asked for Muhammad Ali&#x27;s help in suppressing a rebellion in Greece, but had not paid the promised price for his services. In 1831, Muhammad Ali declared war and managed to take control of Syria and Arabia by the war&#x27;s end in 1833. In 1839, Mahmud resumed the war, hoping to recover his losses, but he died at the time news was on its way to Constantinople that the Empire&#x27;s army had been defeated at Nezib by an Egyptian army led by Muhammad Ali&#x27;s son, Ibrahim Pasha.

=== Economy ===

In his time the financial situation of the Empire was dire, and certain social classes had long been oppressed by burdensome taxes. In dealing with the complicated questions that arose, Mahmud II is considered to have demonstrated the best spirit of the best of the Köprülüs. A Firman of 22 February 1834 abolished the vexatious charges which public functionaries when traversing the provinces, had long been accustomed to taking from the inhabitants. By the same edict all collection of money, except for the two regular half-yearly periods, was denounced as an abuse. &quot;No one is ignorant,&quot; said Sultan Mahmud II in this document, &quot;that I am bound to afford support to all my subjects against vexatious proceedings; to endeavor unceasingly to lighten, instead of increasing their burdens, and to ensure peace and tranquility. Therefore, those acts of oppression are at once contrary to the will of God, and to my imperial orders.&quot;

The &quot;haraç&quot;, or capitation tax, though moderate and exempting those who paid it from military service, had long been made an engine of gross tyranny through the insolence and misconduct of government collectors. The Firman of 1834 abolished the old mode of levying it and ordained that it should be raised by a commission composed of the &quot;Kadı&quot;, the Muslim governors, and the &quot;Ayans&quot;, or municipal chiefs of &quot;Rayas&quot; in each district. Many other financial improvements were affected. By another important series of measures, the administrative government was simplified and strengthened, and a large number of sinecure offices were abolished. Sultan Mahmud II gave a valuable personal example of good sense and economy, organized the imperial household, suppressed all titles without duties, and eliminated all the positions of salaried officials without functions.

== Tanzimat Era 1839–1876 ==
In 1839, the Hatt-i Sharif proclamation launched the Tanzimat (from Arabic: تنظيم &quot;tanẓīm&quot;, meaning &quot;organisation&quot;) (1839–76), period. Previous to the first of the firmans, the property of all persons banished or condemned to death was forfeited to the Caliph, which kept a motive for acts of cruelty, besides encouraging delators. The second firman removed the ancient rights of Turkish governors to condemn men to instant death at will; the &quot;Paşas&quot;, the &quot;Ağas&quot;, and other officers were enjoined that &quot;they should not presume to inflict, themselves, the punishment of death on any man, whether Raya or Turk, unless authorized by a legal sentence pronounced by the , and regularly signed by the judge.&quot;

The Tanzimat reforms did not halt the rise of nationalism in the Danubian Principalities and the Principality of Serbia, which had been semi-independent for almost six decades. In 1875, the tributary principalities of Serbia and Montenegro, and the United Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, unilaterally declared their independence from the empire. Following the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878), the empire granted independence to all three belligerent nations. Bulgaria also achieved virtual independence (as the Principality of Bulgaria); its volunteers had participated in the Russo-Turkish War on the side of the rebelling nations.

The government&#x27;s series of constitutional reforms led to a fairly modern conscripted army, banking system reforms, the decriminalization of homosexuality, the replacement of religious law with secular law and guilds with modern factories.

=== 1839–1861 Abdülmecit I ===

==== 1840s ====
The Ottoman Ministry of Post was established in Istanbul on 23 October 1840. The first post office was the &quot;Postahane-i Amire&quot; near the courtyard of the Yeni Mosque.

The introduction of the first Ottoman paper banknotes (1840) and opening of the first post offices (1840); the reorganization of the finance system according to the French model (1840); the reorganization of the Civil and Criminal Code according to the French model (1840); the establishment of the &quot;Meclis-i Maarif-i Umumiye&quot; (1841) which was the prototype of the First Ottoman Parliament (1876); the reorganisation of the army and a regular method of recruiting, levying the army and fixing the duration of military service (1843–44); the adoption of an Ottoman national anthem and Ottoman national flag (1844); the institution of a Council of Public Instruction (1845) and the Ministry of Education (&quot;Mekatib-i Umumiye Nezareti&quot;, 1847, which later became the &quot;Maarif Nezareti&quot;, 1857); the abolition of slavery and slave trade (1847); the establishment of the first modern universities (&quot;darülfünun&quot;, 1848), academies (1848) and teacher schools (&quot;darülmuallimin&quot;, 1848).

Samuel Morse received his first ever patent for the telegraph in 1847, at the old Beylerbeyi Palace (the present Beylerbeyi Palace was built in 1861–1865 on the same location) in Istanbul, which was issued by Sultan Abdülmecid who personally tested the new invention. Following this successful test, installation works of the first telegraph line (Istanbul-Adrianople–Şumnu) began on 9 August 1847.

==== Identity Card and Ottoman Census, 1844 ====

While the Ottoman Empire had population records prior to the 1830s, it was only in 1831 that the Office of Population Registers fund (Ceride-i Nüfus Nezareti) was founded. The Office decentralized in 1839 to draw more accurate data. Registrars, inspectors, and population officials were appointed to the provinces and smaller administrative districts. They recorded births and deaths periodically and compared lists indicating the population in each district. These records were not a total count of the population. Rather, they were based on what is known as &quot;head of household&quot;. Only the ages, occupation, and property of the male family members only were counted.

The first nationwide Ottoman census was in 1844. The first national identity cards which officially named the &quot;Mecidiye&quot; identity papers, or informally &quot;kafa kağıdı&quot; (&quot;head paper&quot;) documents.

==== 1850s ====
In 1856, the &quot;Hatt-ı Hümayun&quot; promised equality for all Ottoman citizens regardless of their ethnicity and religious confession; which thus widened the scope of the 1839 &quot;Hatt-ı Şerif&quot; of Gülhane. Overall, the Tanzimat reforms had far-reaching effects. Those educated in the schools established during the Tanzimat period included Mustafa Kemal Atatürk and other progressive leaders and thinkers of the Republic of Turkey and of many other former Ottoman states in the Balkans, the Middle East and North Africa. These reforms included guarantees to ensure the Ottoman subjects perfect security for their lives, honor and property;

Establishment of the Ministry of Healthcare (&quot;Tıbbiye Nezareti&quot;, 1850); the Commerce and Trade Code (1850); establishment of the Academy of Sciences (&quot;Encümen-i Daniş&quot;, 1851); establishment of the &quot;Şirket-i Hayriye&quot; which operated the first steam-powered commuter ferries (1851); the first European style courts (&quot;Meclis-i Ahkam-ı Adliye&quot;, 1853) and supreme judiciary council (&quot;Meclis-i Ali-yi Tanzimat&quot;, 1853); establishment of the modern Municipality of Istanbul (&quot;Şehremaneti&quot;, 1854) and the City Planning Council (&quot;İntizam-ı Şehir Komisyonu&quot;, 1855); the abolition of the capitation (Jizya) tax on non-Muslims, with a regular method of establishing and collecting taxes (1856); non-Muslims were allowed to become soldiers (1856); various provisions for the better administration of the public service and advancement of commerce; the establishment of the first telegraph networks (1847–1855) and railways (1856); the replacement of guilds with factories; the establishment of the Ottoman Central Bank (originally established as the &quot;Bank-ı Osmanî&quot; in 1856, and later reorganised as the &quot;Bank-ı Osmanî-i Şahane&quot; in 1863) and the Ottoman Stock Exchange (&quot;Dersaadet Tahvilat Borsası&quot;, established in 1866); the Land Code (&quot;Arazi Kanunnamesi&quot;, 1857); permission for private sector publishers and printing firms with the &quot;Serbesti-i Kürşad Nizamnamesi&quot; (1857); establishment of the School of Economical and Political Sciences (&quot;Mekteb-i Mülkiye&quot;, 1859).

In 1855 the Ottoman telegraph network became operational and the Telegraph Administration was established.

==== Crimean War, 1853–1856 ====

The Crimean War (1853–1856) was part of a long-running contest between the major European powers for influence over territories of the declining Ottoman Empire. Britain and France successfully defended the Ottoman Empire against Russia.

Most of the fighting took place when the allies landed on Russia&#x27;s Crimean Peninsula to gain control of the Black Sea. There were smaller campaigns in western Anatolia, the Caucasus, the Baltic Sea, the Pacific Ocean and the White Sea. It was one of the first &quot;modern&quot; wars, as it introduced new technologies to warfare, such as the first tactical use of railways and the telegraph. The subsequent Treaty of Paris (1856) secured Ottoman control over the Balkan Peninsula and the Black Sea basin. That lasted until defeat in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878.

The Ottoman Empire took its first foreign loans on 4 August 1854, shortly after the beginning of the Crimean War.

The war caused an exodus of the Crimean Tatars. From the total Tatar population of 300,000 in the Tauride Province, about 200,000 Crimean Tatars moved to the Ottoman Empire in continuing waves of emigration. Toward the end of the Caucasian Wars, 90% of the Circassians were exiled from their homelands in the Caucasus and settled in the Ottoman Empire. During the 19th century, there was an exodus to present-day Turkey by a large portion of Muslim peoples from the Balkans, Caucasus, Crimea and Crete. By the early 19th century, as many as 45% of the islanders may have been Muslim, who had a great influence in molding the country&#x27;s fundamental features. These people were called &quot;Muhacir&quot; under a general definition. By the time the Ottoman Empire came to an end in 1922, half of the urban population of Turkey was descended from Muslim refugees from Russia. Crimean Tatar refugees in the late 19th century played an especially notable role in seeking to modernize Turkish education.

==== Armenians, 1860s ====
Influenced by the Age of Enlightenment and the rise of nationalism under the Ottoman Empire, the Armenian national liberation movement developed in the early 1860s. The factors contributing to its emergence made the movement similar to that of the Balkan nations, especially the Greeks. The Armenian élite and various militant groups sought to improve and defend the mostly rural Armenian population of the eastern Ottoman Empire from the Muslims, but the ultimate goal was the creation of an Armenian state in the Armenian-populated areas controlled at the time by the Ottoman Empire and the Russian Empire.

=== 1861–1876 Abdülaziz ===

Abdülaziz continued the Tanzimat and Islahat reforms. New administrative districts (&quot;vilayets&quot;) were set up in 1864 and a Council of State was established in 1868. Public education was organized on the French model and Istanbul University was reorganized as a modern institution in 1861. Abdülaziz was also the first sultan who traveled outside his empire. His 1867 trip included a visit to the United Kingdom. The Press and Journalism Regulation Code (&quot;Matbuat Nizamnamesi&quot;, 1864); among others. 1876 the first international mailing network between Istanbul and the lands beyond the vast Ottoman Empire was established. In 1901 the first money transfers were made through the post offices and the first cargo services became operational. In 1868 homosexuality was decriminalised

The Christian millets gained privileges, such as in the Armenian National Constitution of 1863. This Divan-approved form of the &quot;Code of Regulations&quot; consisted of 150 articles drafted by the Armenian intelligentsia. Another institution was the newly formed Armenian National Assembly. The Christian population of the empire, owing to their higher educational levels, started to pull ahead of the Muslim majority, leading to much resentment on the part of the latter. In 1861, there were 571 primary and 94 secondary schools for Ottoman Christians with 140,000 pupils in total, a figure that vastly exceeded the number of Muslim children in school at the same time, who were further hindered by the amount of time spent learning Arabic and Islamic theology. In turn, the higher educational levels of the Christians allowed them to play a large role in the economy. In 1911, of the 654 wholesale companies in Istanbul, 528 were owned by ethnic Greeks.

In 1871 the Ministry of Post and the Telegraph Administration were merged, becoming the Ministry of Post and Telegraph. In July 1881 the first telephone circuit in Istanbul was established between the Ministry of Post and Telegraph in the Soğukçeşme quarter and the Postahane-i Amire in the Yenicami quarter. On 23 May 1909, the first manual telephone exchange with a 50 line capacity entered service in the Büyük Postane (Grand Post Office) in Sirkeci.

==== Bulgaria, 1870s ====

The rise of national awakening of Bulgaria led to the Bulgarian revival movement. Unlike Greece and Serbia, the nationalist movement in Bulgaria did not concentrate initially on armed resistance against the Ottoman Empire. After the establishment of the Bulgarian Exarchate on 28 February 1870, a large-scale armed struggle started to develop as late as the beginning of the 1870s with the establishment of the Internal Revolutionary Organisation and the Bulgarian Revolutionary Central Committee, as well as the active involvement of Vasil Levski in both organizations. The struggle reached its peak with the April Uprising of 1876 in several Bulgarian districts in Moesia, Thrace, and Macedonia. The suppression of the uprising and the atrocities committed by Ottoman soldiers against the civilian population increased the Bulgarian desire for independence.
==== Albanians, 1870s ====

Because of the religious ties of the Albanian majority of the population with the ruling Ottomans and the lack of an Albanian state in past, nationalism was less developed among Albanians in the 19th century than among other southeast European nations. Only from the 1870s and onwards did a movement of &#x27;national awakening&#x27; evolve among them - greatly delayed, compared to the Greeks and the Serbs. The 1877–1878 Russo-Turkish War dealt a decisive blow to Ottoman power in the Balkan Peninsula. The Albanians&#x27; fear that the lands they inhabited would be partitioned among Montenegro, Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece fueled the rise of Albanian nationalism.

=== Debt default ===
After the taking of its first loans, the Empire had taken further loans out in 1858, 1860, 1862, 1863, 1865, and every year between 1869 and 1874. But economic trouble loomed. The Panic of 1873 depressed the economy, and poor harvests followed. Palace intrigues diverted political attention from the debt crisis. Finally, on October 6, 1875, the Empire suspended interest payments on its loans, and formally defaulted on October 30. The amount defaulted on was estimated at 224.5 million British Pounds (). But the entire income of the Empire had been a mere 21.7 million British pounds (), a ratio of 10.3. For comparison, the modern debt to income ratio of the United States was around 7.8 in 2022. The default on the Ottoman debt was met by outrage in European nations, to whom the debts were owed. The concerted efforts of the United Kingdom and France, whose citizens were the chief bondholders on the Ottoman debt, would lead to the creation of the Ottoman Public Debt Administration in 1881. It would function as an independent arm of the Ottoman Bureaucracy, whose goal was to secure tax revenue to send back home to its citizen bondholders. Other represented nations were Germany, Italy, Austria, the Netherlands, as well as internal Ottoman bondholders. The Ottoman debt would prove to be a heavy weight on the Empire and only added to the other crises that emerged in the 1870s.

== Ottoman Constitution, 1876 ==
The reformist period peaked with the Constitution, called the &quot;Kanûn-u Esâsî&quot; (meaning &quot;Basic Law&quot; in Ottoman Turkish), written by members of the Young Ottomans, which was promulgated on 23 November 1876. It established the freedom of belief and equality of all citizens before the law. The empire&#x27;s First Constitutional era, was short-lived. But the idea of Ottomanism proved influential. A group of reformers known as the Young Ottomans, primarily educated in Western universities, believed that a constitutional monarchy would give an answer to the empire&#x27;s growing social unrest. Through a military coup in 1876, they forced Sultan Abdülaziz (1861–1876) to abdicate in favour of Murad V. However, Murad V was mentally ill and was deposed within a few months. His heir-apparent, Abdülhamid II (1876–1909), was invited to assume power on the condition that he would declare a constitutional monarchy, which he did on 23 November 1876. The parliament survived for only two years before the sultan suspended it. When forced to reconvene it, he abolished the representative body instead. This ended the effectiveness of the &quot;Kanûn-ı Esâsî&quot;.

=== 1876 Murat V ===
After Abdülaziz&#x27;s dethronement, Murat was enthroned. It was hoped that he would sign the constitution. However, due to health problems, Murat was also dethroned after 93 days; he was the shortest reigning sultan of the Empire.

== First Constitutional Era, 1876–1878 ==
The First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire was the period of constitutional monarchy from the promulgation of the &quot;Kanûn-ı Esâsî&quot; (meaning &quot;Basic Law&quot; in Ottoman Turkish), written by members of the Young Ottomans, on 23 November 1876 until 13 February 1878. The era ended with the suspension of the Ottoman parliament by Abdülhamid II.

=== 1876–1878 Abdul Hamid II ===

==== Russo-Turkish War 1877–1878 ====

The Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878 had its origins in a rise in nationalism in the Balkans as well as in the Russian goal of recovering territorial losses it had suffered during the Crimean War, reestablishing itself in the Black Sea and following the political movement attempting to free Balkan nations from the Ottoman Empire. As a result of the war, the principalities of Romania, Serbia and Montenegro, each of which had had &quot;de facto&quot; sovereignty for some time, formally proclaimed independence from the Ottoman Empire. After almost half a millennium of Ottoman rule (1396–1878), the Bulgarian state was reestablished as the Principality of Bulgaria, covering the land between the Danube River and the Balkan Mountains (except Northern Dobrudja which was given to Romania) and the region of Sofia, which became the new state&#x27;s capital. The Congress of Berlin also allowed Austria-Hungary to occupy Bosnia and Herzegovina and Great Britain to take over Cyprus, while the Russian Empire annexed Southern Bessarabia and the Kars region.

====Congress of Berlin, 1878====

The Congress of Berlin (13 June – 13 July 1878) was a meeting of the leading statesmen of Europe&#x27;s Great Powers and the Ottoman Empire. In the wake of the Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878) that ended with a decisive victory for Russia and her Orthodox Christian allies (subjects of the Ottoman Empire before the war) in the Balkan Peninsula, the urgent need was to stabilize and reorganize the Balkans, and set up new nations. German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, who led the Congress, undertook to adjust boundaries to minimize the risks of major war, while recognizing the reduced power of the Ottomans, and balance the distinct interests of the great powers.

As a result, Ottoman holdings in Europe declined sharply; Bulgaria was established as an independent principality inside the Ottoman Empire, but was not allowed to keep all its previous territory. Bulgaria lost Eastern Rumelia, which was restored to the Turks under a special administration; and Macedonia, which was returned outright to the Turks, who promised reform. Romania achieved full independence, but had to turn over part of Bessarabia to Russia. Serbia and Montenegro finally gained complete independence, but with smaller territories.

In 1878, Austria-Hungary unilaterally occupied the Ottoman provinces of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Novi Pazar, but the Ottoman government contested this move and maintained its troops in both provinces. The stalemate lasted for 30 years (Austrian and Ottoman forces coexisted in Bosnia and Novi Pazar for three decades) until 1908, when the Austrians took advantage of the political turmoil in the Ottoman Empire that stemmed from the Young Turk Revolution and annexed Bosnia-Herzegovina, but pulled their troops out of Novi Pazar in order to reach a compromise and avoid a war with the Turks.

In return for British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli&#x27;s advocacy for restoring the Ottoman territories on the Balkan Peninsula during the Congress of Berlin, Britain assumed the administration of Cyprus in 1878 and later sent troops to Egypt in 1882 with the pretext of helping the Ottoman government to put down the Urabi Revolt; effectively gaining control in both territories (Britain formally annexed the still nominally Ottoman territories of Cyprus and Egypt on 5 November 1914, in response to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s decision to enter World War I on the side of the Central Powers.) France, on its part, occupied Tunisia in 1881.

The results were first hailed as a great achievement in peacemaking and stabilization. However, most of the participants were not fully satisfied, and grievances regarding the results festered until they exploded into world war in 1914. Serbia, Bulgaria, and Greece made gains, but far less than they thought they deserved. The Ottoman Empire called at the time the &quot;Sick man of Europe&quot;, was humiliated and significantly weakened, rendering it more liable to domestic unrest and more vulnerable to attack. Although Russia had been victorious in the war that occasioned the conference, it was humiliated at Berlin, and resented its treatment. Austria gained a great deal of territory, which angered the South Slavs, and led to decades of tensions in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Bismarck became the target of hatred of Russian nationalists and Pan-Slavists and found that he had tied Germany too closely to Austria in the Balkans.

In the long run, tensions between Russia and Austria-Hungary intensified, as did the nationality question in the Balkans. The Congress succeeded in keeping Istanbul in Ottoman hands. It effectively disavowed Russia&#x27;s victory. The Congress of Berlin returned to the Ottoman Empire territories that the previous treaty had given to the Principality of Bulgaria, most notably Macedonia, thus setting up a strong revanchist demand in Bulgaria that in 1912 led to the First Balkan War in which the Turks were defeated and lost nearly all of Europe. As the Ottoman Empire gradually shrank in size, military power, and wealth, many Balkan Muslims migrated to the empire&#x27;s remaining territory in Balkans or to the heartland in Anatolia. Muslims had been the majority in some parts of Ottoman Empire such as the Crimea, the Balkans, and the Caucasus as well as a plurality in southern Russia and also in some parts of Romania. Most of these lands were lost with time by the Ottoman Empire between the 19th and 20th centuries. By 1923, only Anatolia and eastern Thrace remained as the Muslim land.

== İstibdat Era, 1878–1908 ==
=== 1878–1908 Abdul Hamid II ===
The reign of Abdul Hamid II was pejoratively referred to as &quot;istibdad&quot; (despotism). His reign struggled with the culmination of 75 years of change throughout the empire and an opposing reaction to that change. He was particularly concerned with the centralization of the empire. His efforts to centralize the Sublime Porte were not unheard of among other sultans. The Ottoman Empire&#x27;s local provinces had more control over their areas than the central government. Abdul Hamid II&#x27;s foreign relations came from a &quot;policy of non-commitment&quot;. The sultan understood the fragility of the Ottoman military, and the Empire&#x27;s weaknesses of its domestic control. Pan-Islamism became Abdülhamid&#x27;s solution to the empire&#x27;s loss of identity and power. His efforts to promote Pan-Islamism were for the most part unsuccessful because of the large non-Muslim population, and the European influence onto the empire. His policies essentially isolated the Empire, which further aided in its decline. Several of the elite who sought a new constitution and reform for the empire were forced to flee to Europe. New groups of radicals began to threaten the power of the Ottoman Empire.

==== Egypt 1880s ====

After gaining some amount of autonomy during the early 1800s, Egypt had entered into a period of political turmoil by the 1880s. In April 1882, British and French warships appeared in Alexandria to support the khedive and prevent the country from falling into the hands of anti-European nationals.

In August 1882 British forces invaded and occupied Egypt on the pretext of bringing order. The British supported Khedive Tewfiq and restored stability, which was especially beneficial to British and French financial interests. Egypt and Sudan remained as Ottoman provinces &quot;de jure&quot; until 1914, when the Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers of World War I. Great Britain officially annexed these two provinces and Cyprus in response.

==== 1893–96 Ottoman Census ====
In 1867, the Council of States took charge of drawing population tables, increasing the precision of population records. They introduced new measures of recording population counts in 1874. This led to the establishment of a General Population Administration, attached to the Ministry of Interior in 1881-1882.

The first official census (1881–93) took 10 years to finish. In 1893, the results were compiled and presented. This census is the first modern, general, and standardized census accomplished not for taxation nor for military purposes, but to acquire demographic data. The population was divided into ethno-religious and gender characteristics. Numbers of both male and female subjects are given in ethno-religious categories including Muslims, Greeks, Armenians, Bulgarians, Catholics, Jews, Protestants, Latins, Syriacs and Gypsies.
==== Armenians, 1890s ====

Although granted their own constitution and national assembly with the Tanzimat reforms, the Armenians attempted to demand implementation of Article 61 from the Ottoman government as agreed upon at the Congress of Berlin in 1878.

===== Autonomists =====

During 1880 - 1881, while the Armenian national liberation movement was in its early stage; lack of outside support and inability to maintain a trained, organized Kurdish force diminished Kurdish aspirations. However, two prominent Kurdish families (tribes) mounted opposition to the empire, based more on an ethno-nationalistic standpoint. The Badr Khans were secessionists while the Sayyids of Nihiri were autonomists. The Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 was followed in 1880 - 1881 by the attempt of Shaykh Ubayd Allah of Nihri to found an &quot;independent Kurd principality&quot; around the Ottoman-Persian border (including the Van Vilayet) where Armenian population was significant. Shaykh Ubayd Allah of Nihri gathered 20,000 fighters. Lacking discipline, his man left the ranks after pillaging and acquiring riches from the villages in the region (indiscriminately, including Armenian villages). Shaykh Ubayd Allah of Nihri was captured by the Ottoman forces in 1882 and this movement ended.

The Bashkaleh clash was the bloody encounter between the Armenakan Party and the Ottoman Empire in May 1889. Its name comes from Başkale, a border town of Van Eyalet of the Ottoman Empire. The event was important, as it was reflected on main Armenian newspapers as the recovered documents on the Armenakans showed an extensive plot for a national movement. Ottoman officials believed that the men were members of a large revolutionary apparatus and the discussion was reflected in newspapers, (Eastern Express, Oriental Advertiser, Saadet, and Tarik) and the responses were on the Armenian papers. In some Armenian circles, this event was considered martyrdom and brought other armed conflicts. The Bashkaleh Resistance was on the Persian border, which the Armenakans were in communication with Armenians in the Persian Empire. The Gugunian Expedition, which followed within a couple of months, was an attempt by a small group of Armenian nationalists from the Russian Armenia to launch an armed expedition across the border into the Ottoman Empire in 1890 in support of local Armenians.

The Kum Kapu demonstration occurred at the Armenian quarter of Kum Kapu, the seat of the Armenian Patriarch, was spared through the prompt action of the commandant, Hassan Aga. On 27 July 1890, Harutiun Jangülian, Mihran Damadian and Hambartsum Boyajian interrupted the Armenian mass to read a manifesto and denounce the indifference of the Armenian patriarch and Armenian National Assembly. Harutiun Jangülian (member from Van) tried to assassinate the Patriarch of Istanbul. The goal was to persuade the Armenian clerics to bring their policies into alignment with national politics. They soon forced the patriarch to join the procession heading to the Yıldız Palace to demand implementation of Article 61 of the Treaty of Berlin. It is significant that this massacre, in which 6000 Armenians are said to have perished, was not the result of a general rising of the Muslim population. The Softas took no part in it, and many Armenians found refuge in the Muslim sections of the city.

===== Reform program =====
The Kurdish (force, rebels, bandits) sacked neighboring towns and villages with impunity.

The central assumption of the Hamidiye system—Kurdish tribes (Kurdish chiefdoms cited among Armenian security concerns) could be brought under military discipline—proved to be &quot;Utopian&quot;. The Persian Cossack Brigade later proved that it can function as an independent unit, but the Ottoman example, which was modeled after, never replaced the tribal loyalty to Ottoman Sultan or even to its establishing unit.

In 1892, first time a trained and organized Kurdish force encouraged by the Sultan Abdul Hamid II. There are several reasons advanced as to why the Hamidiye light cavalry was created. The establishment of the Hamidiye was in one part a response to the Russian threat, but scholars believe that the central reason was to suppress Armenian socialist/nationalist revolutionaries. The Armenian revolutionaries posed a threat because they were seen as disruptive, and they could work with the Russians against the Ottoman Empire. The Hamidiye corps or Hamidiye Light Cavalry Regiments were well-armed, irregular, majority Kurdish cavalry (minor amounts of other nationalities, such as Turcoman) formations that operated in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire. They were intended to be modeled after the Caucasian Cossack Regiments (example Persian Cossack Brigade) and were firstly tasked to patrol the Russo-Ottoman frontier and secondly, to reduce the potential of Kurdish-Armenian cooperation. The Hamidiye Cavalry was in no way a cross-tribal force, despite their military appearance, organization, and potential. Hamidiye quickly find out that they could only be tried through a military court martial They became immune to civil administration. Realizing their immunity, they turned their tribes into &quot;legalized robber brigades&quot; as they steal grain, reap fields not of their possession, drive off herds, and openly steal from shopkeepers. Some argue that the creation of the Hamidiye &quot;further antagonized the Armenian population&quot; and it worsened the very conflict they were created to prevent.

Kurdish chieftains also taxed the population of the region in sustaining these units, which Armenians perceived as exploitation. When Armenian spokesmen confronted the Kurdish chieftain (issue of double taxation), it brought about the enmity between both populations. The Hamidiye cavalry harassed and assaulted Armenians.

In 1908, after the overthrow of the Sultan, the Hamidiye Cavalry was disbanded as an organized force, but as they were &quot;tribal forces&quot; before official recognition, they stayed as &quot;tribal forces&quot; after dismemberment. The Hamidiye Cavalry is described as a military disappointment and a failure because of its contribution to tribal feuds.

===== Armenians =====
A major role in the Hamidian massacres of 1894-96 has been often ascribed to the &quot;Hamidiye&quot; regiments, particularly during the bloody suppression of Sasun (1894). On July 25, 1897 the Khanasor Expedition was against the Kurdish Mazrik tribe (Muzuri Kurds) who owned a significant portion of this cavalry. The first notable battle in the Armenian resistance movement took place in Sassoun, where nationalist ideals were proliferated by Hunchak activists, such as Mihran Damadian, Hampartsoum Boyadjian, and Hrayr. The Armenian Revolutionary Federation also played a significant role in arming the people of the region. The Armenians of Sassoun confronted the Ottoman army and Kurdish irregulars at Sassoun, succumbing to superior numbers. This was followed by Zeitun Rebellion (1895–1896), which between the years 1891 and 1895, Hunchak activists toured various regions of Cilicia and Zeitun to encourage resistance, and established new branches of the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party.

In this area, something resembling a civil war between Armenians and Muslims (involving Hamidiye (cavalry)) raged for months before being brought to an end through mediation by the Great Powers. However, instead of Armenian autonomy in these regions, Kurds (Kurdish tribal chiefs) retained much of their autonomy and power. The Abdulhamid made little attempt to alter the traditional power structure of &quot;segmented, agrarian Kurdish societies&quot; – agha, shayk, and tribal chief. Because of their geographical position at the southern and eastern fringe of the empire and mountainous topography, and limited transportation and communication system. The state had little access to these provinces and were forced to make informal agreements with tribal chiefs, for instance, the Ottoman qadi and mufti did not have jurisdiction over religious law which bolstered Kurdish authority and autonomy.

The 1896 Ottoman Bank takeover was perpetrated by an Armenian group armed with pistols, grenades, dynamite and hand-held bombs against the Ottoman Bank in Istanbul. The seizure of the bank lasted 14 hours, resulting in the deaths of 10 of the Armenian men and Ottoman soldiers. The Ottoman reaction to the takeover saw further massacres and pogroms of the several thousand Armenians living in Constantinople and Sultan Abdul Hamid II threatening to level the entire building itself. However, intervention on part of the European diplomats in the city managed to persuade the men to give, assigning safe passage to the survivors to France. Despite the level of violence, the incident had wrought, the takeover was reported positively in the European press, praising the men for their courage and the objectives they attempted to accomplish.

==== Economy ====

Economically, the empire had difficulty in repaying the Ottoman public debt to European banks, which caused the establishment of the Council of Administration of the Ottoman Public Debt. By the end of the 19th century, the main reason the empire was not overrun by Western powers was their attempt to maintain a balance of power in the area. Both Austria and Russia wanted to increase their spheres of influence and territory at the expense of the Ottoman Empire but were kept in check mostly by Britain, which feared Russian dominance in the Eastern Mediterranean.

<text>In number theory, the von Staudt–Clausen theorem is a result determining the fractional part of Bernoulli numbers, found independently by
 and .

Specifically, if is a positive integer and we add to the Bernoulli number for every prime such that divides , then we obtain an integer; that is,

formula_1

This fact immediately allows us to characterize the denominators of the non-zero Bernoulli numbers as the product of all primes such that divides ; consequently, the denominators are square-free and divisible by 6.

These denominators are 
: 6, 30, 42, 30, 66, 2730, 6, 510, 798, 330, 138, 2730, 6, 870, 14322, 510, 6, 1919190, 6, 13530, ... .

The sequence of integers formula_2 is
: 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, -6, 56, -528, 6193, -86579, 1425518, -27298230, ... .

== Proof ==
A proof of the Von Staudt–Clausen theorem follows from an explicit formula for Bernoulli numbers which is:
:formula_3
and as a corollary:
:formula_4
where are the Stirling numbers of the second kind.

Furthermore the following lemmas are needed:

Let be a prime number; then

1. If divides , then

: formula_5

2. If does not divide , then

: formula_6

Proof of (1) and (2): One has from Fermat&#x27;s little theorem,

: formula_7 

for .

If divides , then one has
: formula_8

for . Thereafter, one has

: formula_9

from which (1) follows immediately.

If does not divide , then after Fermat&#x27;s theorem one has

: formula_10

If one lets , then after iteration one has

: formula_11

for and .

Thereafter, one has

: formula_12

Lemma (2) now follows from the above and the fact that for .

(3). It is easy to deduce that for and , divides .

(4). Stirling numbers of the second kind are integers.

Now we are ready to prove the theorem.

If is composite and , then from (3), divides .

For ,

: formula_13

If is prime, then we use (1) and (2), and if is composite, then we use (3) and (4) to deduce

:formula_14

where is an integer, as desired.

<doc id="1084657" wikidata="Q642542" url="?curid=1084657" title="Areole">
<text>In botany, areoles are small light- to dark-colored bumps on cacti out of which grow clusters of spines. Areoles are important diagnostic features of cacti, and identify them as a family distinct from other succulent plants. The spines are not easily detachable, but on certain cacti, members of the subfamily Opuntioideae, smaller, detachable bristles, glochids, also grow out of the areoles and afford additional protection.

Areoles represent highly specialized branches on cacti. They evolved as abortive branch buds while their spines evolved as vestigial leaves. In branched cacti, such as Opuntioidiae and the saguaro, new branches grow from areoles, because that is where the buds are. The development of the areole seems to have been an important element in the adaptation of cacti to niches in desert ecology.

Some of the Opuntioideae have spines, as well as glochids, on their areoles; some have only glochids. Structurally, the glochids seem to be bristles rather than evolved leaves. They are detachable and resemble small, sharp splinters. Unlike the spines, glochids generally are barbed and are very difficult to remove from the skin.

==Evolution==
The cactus family, the Cactaceae, evolved 30–40 million years ago in the Americas, originally completely separately from Africa, Europe, and Asia, although, probably within the last few million years, some species of &quot;Rhipsalis&quot; appear to have been carried to parts of Asia and Africa, most likely by birds.

The areole was one of the unique features that cacti developed, possibly in adaptation to the ambient climate in the area in which they emerged. Accordingly, the areoles distinguish the family Cactaceae from other succulent plants both in the New World and the Old World.

==Importance==
For the cacti, areoles are an important evolutionary modification. They give rise to spines and glochids, which are their primary means of self-defense. In addition, because these spines arise from areoles and not directly from the plant stem, cacti can more effectively cover themselves with spines than other plants. The spines themselves can be of greater size and number.

In addition, areoles can produce spines of many different types to suit their needs. A typical areole may have one or a few long, sharp central spines, which serve as the primary defense. Beneath them are often numerous (10 or more) smaller, radial spines produced around the edge of the areole. These may serve as a secondary defense against small creatures that can get past the central spines. In some species, though, such as &quot;Cephalocereus senilis&quot;, the tangle of hairy radial spines serves to shade the plant and retain a layer of cool, humid air next to it.

Areoles contributed largely to the evolutionary success of the Cactaceae throughout the range of the family, and account for the diversification seen in the many species today.

<doc id="1084659" wikidata="Q3885751" url="?curid=1084659" title="Orgasmo">
<text>Orgasmo (Italian for &quot;orgasm&quot;) is a 1969 &quot;giallo&quot; film co-written and directed by Umberto Lenzi and starring Carroll Baker, Lou Castel, and Colette Descombes. It follows a wealthy American socialite who finds herself preyed upon by two nefarious young siblings who indulge her in sex, drugs, and alcohol while she vacations at an Italian villa. This film helped launch the second phase of Baker&#x27;s career, during which she became a regular star in Italian productions.

After its Italian premiere in February 1969, &quot;Orgasmo&quot; was released in the United States under the alternative title Paranoia later that same year. It was one of the first films to carry an X rating in the United States under the newly established Motion Picture Association film rating system, and this fact was sensationalized for its American promotional materials.

The film marked the first of four collaborations between Lenzi and actress Carroll Baker, who also starred in &quot;So Sweet... So Perverse&quot; (1969), &quot;A Quiet Place to Kill&quot; (1970) and &quot;Il coltello di ghiaccio&quot; (1972).

==Plot==
American socialite Catherine West arrives in Italy from New York to a flurry of journalists following the car accident death of her husband Robert, a Texas oil baron who left her his $200 million estate. She retreats to an Italian villa rented by her austere lawyer, Brian Sanders. Catherine soon meets Peter Donovan, a young American man from Boston whose car has broken down nearby. Peter manages to manipulate his way into staying with Catherine, who is initially icy toward his romantic advances. However, Peter swiftly manages to seduce her, and the two engage in a passionate affair.

Catherine travels to London to visit with her late husband&#x27;s relatives to discuss property she is bequeathing to them, but finds them to be abrasive and angry with her, believing she married Robert solely for his money. Late one night, Catherine senses someone has broken into the house, but the housekeeper Teresa attributes Catherine&#x27;s paranoia to her abuse of alcohol and prescription drugs. When Catherine invites Peter to stay with her for a week, his sister Eva arrives at the villa unexpectedly. Catherine enjoys the siblings&#x27; companionship and youthful vivaciousness.

During a dinner meeting with Brian, Catherine admits she is suffering from liver failure due to her alcoholism. Upon returning to the villa, Catherine finds Peter and Eva in bed together nude. She presumes the two have engaged in incest, but Peter informs Catherine that he and Eva are not blood-related, and are in fact only stepsiblings. Eva confesses that she is sexually attracted to Catherine, and the three soon engage in a series of nightly debaucherous threesomes fueled by Peter and Eva&#x27;s indulging of Catherine in liquor and stimulant drugs.

One night, Catherine, disgusted with herself and in a drunken rage, orders Peter and Eva to leave the villa. They oblige, but soon return, and begin physically abusing Catherine and taking control of the house, subduing Catherine by forcing her to drink. Finding herself held hostage by the siblings, Catherine becomes increasingly desperate to escape Peter and Eva. She manages to produce a gun, with which she shoots Peter. Catherine loses consciousness due to a sedative fed to her by Eva, and awakens to find that the gun was loaded with blanks by the siblings, and that Peter was unharmed. The two bind and gag Catherine, tying her to a bed. When Brian visits the villa, Peter tells him that Catherine has descended into a depression, and has threatened to commit suicide.

Locked in her upstairs bedroom, Catherine is further tormented by the siblings, who on one occasion serve her a live toad for dinner. The two later bring her whiskey and a large number of barbiturates, along with a falsified letter stating Brian has died in a plane crash, with the hope that Catherine will voluntarily kill herself by overdosing. Catherine manages to escape her bedroom and flees to the attic, accessing the roof of the villa. Brian arrives, and witnesses Catherine collapse over the edge of the roof, falling to the veranda below and fracturing her skull. Brian picks the injured Catherine up in his arms. The two briefly make eye contact before he ruthlessly throws her over the veranda onto the driveway below, killing her. Brian, who has conspired with the siblings to steal Catherine&#x27;s fortune, produces two forged suicide notes, and orders Peter to alert authorities to Catherine&#x27;s staged suicide. It is revealed that Brian is in fact Peter and Eva&#x27;s uncle, and had Catherine unknowingly sign documents that bequeathed her estate to the trio.

After the reading of Catherine&#x27;s last will and testament, Brian is met by a detective who notifies him that New York police discovered that the brakes in Robert&#x27;s car were tampered with, causing his fatal road accident. Brian momentarily fears their plot has been discovered, until the detective states that police believe Catherine caused the accident, as Robert had planned to divorce her. Based on this conclusion, Catherine is not legally entitled to her husband&#x27;s estate, which Brian is informed will instead go to his aunt. Meanwhile, as Peter and Eva gleefully drive through the city in their convertible, they are killed in a head-on collision with a truck.

==Analysis==
Film scholar Robert Curti considers &quot;Orgasmo&quot; a variation on Pier Paolo Pasolini&#x27;s &quot;Teorema&quot; (1968), another film in which &quot;seductive strangers [disrupt] the bourgeois status quo and its morals&quot;. Curti also compares the film to the novella &quot;Carmilla&quot; (1872), about a young woman seduced by a lesbian vampire.

==Release==

&quot;Orgasmo&quot; premiered in Italy on 7 February 1969. The Italian version of &quot;Orgasmo&quot; has a different ending than the American version. In the United States, &quot;Orgasmo&quot; opened under the &quot;Paranoia&quot; title on 13 August the same year. The film was among the first to receive an X rating in the United States under the newly-established Motion Picture Association film rating system, and its X rating was sensationalized in advertising materials.

The film&#x27;s title has led to confusion due to its re-titling in the United States as &quot;Paranoia&quot;. Umberto Lenzi&#x27;s next film (which also starred Carroll Baker) was released as &quot;Paranoia&quot; in Italy in 1970, but was retitled &quot;A Quiet Place to Kill&quot; for its American release.

Like other early giallo films, &quot;Orgasmo&quot; was not popular among Italian film audiences upon its initial theatrical release, as the genre never gained popularity in its home country until the release of Dario Argento&#x27;s &quot;The Bird with the Crystal Plumage&quot; (1970) and &quot;The Cat o&#x27; Nine Tails&quot; (1971), but it was a major hit outside of Italy. &quot;Orgasmo&quot; was released in France as &quot;Une folle envie d&#x27;aimer&quot; ().

Baker commented in 1971 on the success of her Italian films: 

My pictures in Italy have grossed so much money that I don&#x27;t have to search the rest of the world for work. They build movies around me and the percentages are sensational... &quot;Orgasmo,&quot; which was called &quot;Paranoia&quot; in America, grossed $8 million there alone!

===Critical reception===
From contemporary reviews, the &quot;Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; wrote that &quot;this high gloss melodrama rings enough changes on an old theme to keep one watching right up to the grisly retribution of the finale, even if the denouement is a trifle rushed&quot;. The review concluded that &quot;it might have been even more enjoyable - on its own low camp level - if Umberto Lenzi had not been so determined to match style to subject, with the camera deliriously sliding in and out of focus as the tormented lady totters down the stairs and every scene shot from behind a bit of the furniture&quot;. Roger Ebert gave the film a negative review, stating that &quot;only the haunting memory of &quot;Succubus&quot; prevents me from naming [&quot;Orgasmo&quot;] as the worst movie of the year&quot;.

From retrospective reviews, the online film database AllMovie gave &quot;Orgasmo&quot; one star, referring to it as less interesting than &quot;A Quiet Place to Kill&quot; and stating that &quot;there are some interesting moments, but this is clearly the lesser of the two films&quot;. Troy Howarth reviewed &quot;Orgasmo&quot; favorably in &quot;So Deadly, So Perverse: 50 Years of Italian Giallo Films&quot;, writing that &quot;the film is a classic example of the so-called sexy &quot;giallo&quot;, with plenty of cool eroticism and a pleasantly &#x27;mod&#x27; aesthetic&quot;. Howarth added that director Lenzi &quot;displays a sure and steady hand in gradually unveiling the various plot twists&quot;. In &quot;Sleazoid Express&quot;, Bill Landis wrote, &quot;The photography seems filmed through a shot glass. The use of red lighting and off-kilter shots, while simple and inexpensive, are extremely effective in reproducing the state of being slowly overdosed on liquor and prescription pills.&quot; Landis continued, &quot;&quot;Paranoia&quot; established director Umberto Lenzi as the king of giallos, an effective melodramatist who delivered the goods. Lenzi was sleazier and more bluntly sexual than more revered figures like Mario Bava and Dario Argento&quot;. 

===Home media===
The X-rated U.S. cut of &quot;Paranoia&quot; was released on VHS in 1985, in pan and scan 4:3 aspect ratio, by Spotlite Video, a division of Republic Pictures Corporation. 

The film was released on Blu-ray in a box set by Severin Films in June 2020, featuring all four of Lenzi&#x27;s film collaborations with actress Carroll Baker (including &quot;So Sweet... So Perverse&quot;, &quot;A Quiet Place to Kill&quot;, and &quot;Il coltello di ghiaccio&quot;). The box set includes both versions of &quot;Orgasmo&quot;.

<doc id="1084668" wikidata="Q7269254" url="?curid=1084668" title="Quarter acre">
<text>In Australian and New Zealand English, a quarter acre is a term for a suburban plot of land. Traditionally, Australians and New Zealanders aspired to own a 3- or 4-bedroom house or bungalow on a section of around a quarter of an acre (about 1,000 square metres), also known locally as the Australian Dream or the New Zealand dream. The land was frequently put to use with vegetable gardens, fruit trees, or lawns for family recreation.

Demand for quarter-acre blocks were driven by easy access to motor vehicles, allowing for more low-density urban sprawl for blocks of these size. Demand in Australia was also driven by waves of European migrants, who were eager to own homes, and may not have had the opportunity to do so in Europe.

The quarter-acre aspiration has changed in recent decades, with sub-divisions, infill housing, apartments, and townhouses becoming more common in large cities, and nearby lifestyle farming blocks becoming popular. Most &quot;quarter-acre&quot; sections are not exactly a quarter of an acre. With urban growth, properties tend to be smaller with new sub-divisions averaging a half or less of the classic quarter-acre.

<text>Sir William Muir (27 April 1819 – 11 July 1905) was a Scottish Orientalist, and colonial administrator, Principal of the University of Edinburgh and Lieutenant Governor of the North-Western Provinces of British India.

==Life==

He was born at Glasgow the son of William Muir (1783–1820), a merchant, and Helen Macfie (1784–1866). His older brother was John Muir, the Indologist and Sanskrit scholar. He was educated at Kilmarnock Academy, the universities of Glasgow and Edinburgh, and Haileybury College. In 1837 he entered the Bengal civil service. Muir served as secretary to the governor of the North-West Provinces, and as a member of the Agra revenue board, and during the Mutiny he was in charge of the intelligence department there. In 1865 he was made foreign secretary to the Indian Government. In 1867 Muir was knighted (K.C.S.I.), and in 1868 he became lieutenant-governor of the North Western Provinces.

Having been criticised for the poor relief effort during the Orissa famine of 1866, the British began to discuss famine policy, and in 1868 Muir issued an order stating that: In 1874 Muir was appointed financial member of the Viceroy&#x27;s Council, and retired in 1876, when he became a member of the Council of India in London. James Thomason served as Muir&#x27;s mentor with respect to Imperial administration; Muir later wrote an influential biography of Thomason.

Muir had always taken an interest in educational matters, and it was chiefly through his exertions that the central college at Allahabad, known as Muir Central College, was built and endowed. Muir College later became a part of the University of Allahabad. In 1884 Muir was elected president of the Royal Asiatic Society. In 1885 he was elected principal of the University of Edinburgh in succession to Sir Alexander Grant, and held the post till 1903, when he retired.

On 7 February 1840, he married Elizabeth Huntly (1822–1897), daughter of James Wemyss, collector of Cawnpore, and together they had 15 children. He died in Edinburgh, and is buried in Dean Cemetery. The grave lies in the concealed lower southern terrace.

== Works, reception, and legacy ==
Muir was a scholar of Islam. His chief area of expertise was the history of the time of Muhammad and the early caliphate. His chief books are &quot;A Life of Mahomet and History of Islam to the Era of the Hegira&quot;; &quot;Annals of the Early Caliphate&quot;; &quot;The Caliphate: Its rise, decline and fall&quot;, an abridgment and continuation of the Annals, which brings the record down to the fall of the caliphate on the onset of the Mongols; &quot;The Koran: its Composition and Teaching&quot;; and &quot;The Mohammedan Controversy&quot;, a reprint of five essays published at intervals between 1885 and 1887. In 1888 he delivered the Rede lecture at Cambridge on &quot;The Early Caliphate and Rise of Islam&quot;.

=== &quot;Life of Mahomet&quot; ===

His original book &quot;A Life of Mahomet and History of Islam to the Era of the Hegira&quot; was initially published 1861 in four volumes. The book received attention in both literary and missionary circles, and provoked responses ranging from appreciation to criticism. It would eventually evoke a rebuttal from Sayyid Ahmad Khan.

Contemporary reviewers of Muir&#x27;s &quot;Life of Mahomet&quot; uniformly praised him for his knowledge of Arabic. The only competing work in Britain at the time was a book by Harrow schoolmaster Reginald Bosworth Smith, who had no Arabic language skills. The work was also praised by Christian missionaries who welcomed it as an aid to convert Muslims.

Contemporary historian E. A. Freeman praised the book as a &quot;great work&quot;, yet questioned its conjectural methodology, particularly Muir&#x27;s suggestion that Muhammad was inspired by Satan. Contemporary Aloys Sprenger also criticized Muir for ascribing Islam&#x27;s origins to &quot;the Devil&quot;. The &quot;British Quarterly Review&quot; of 1872 criticized his approach as &quot;he is treading ground whither the historian of events and creeds must refuse to follow him&quot;.

A significant rebuttal to Muir&#x27;s book was written Syed Ahmed Khan in 1870 called &quot;A Series of Essays on the Life of Mohammed, and Subjects Subsidiary Thereto&quot;. Khan praised Muir&#x27;s writing talent and familiarity with Oriental literature, but criticized Muir&#x27;s reliance on weak sources like al-Waqidi. He accused Muir of misrepresenting the facts and writing with animus. Written objections to this aspect of &quot;Life&quot; could be found in the writings of Muslims living inside British India only after the Indian Rebellion of 1857, an unsuccessful uprising against the East India Company.

Later reviews of the work have also been mixed, with many scholars describing Muir&#x27;s work as polemical. W. M. Watt (1961) described Muir&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; as following &quot;in detail the standard Muslim accounts, though not uncritically&quot;. Mohammed Hussein Heikal regarded Muir&#x27;s work as an &quot;argumentum ad hominem&quot; fallacy. Albert Hourani (1980) said Muir&#x27;s writing, while &quot;still not quite superseded&quot;, regarded Muhammad as &quot;the Devil&#x27;s instrument&quot; and Muslim society as &quot;barren and bound to remain so&quot;. Aaron W. Hughes (2012) writes that Muir&#x27;s work was part of a European Orientalist tradition that sought to show that Islam was &quot;a corruption, a garbled version of existing monotheisms&quot;. Bennett (1998) praises it as &quot;a detailed life of Muhammad more complete than almost any other previous book, at least in English,&quot; noting however that besides &quot;placing the facts of Muhammad&#x27;s life before both Muslim and Christian readers, Muir wanted to convince Muslims that Muhammad was not worth their allegiance. He thus combined scholarly and evangelical or missionary purposes.&quot; Commenting on Muir&#x27;s conjecture that Muhammad may have been affected by a Satanic influence, Clinton Bennett says that Muir &quot;chose to resurrect another old Christian theory&quot;, and quotes the following passage from Muir&#x27;s 1858 &quot;Life&quot;, vol. 2:

In the final chapters of &quot;Life&quot;, Muir concluded that the main legacy of Islam was a negative one, and he subdivided it in &quot;three radical evils&quot;:
According to Edward Said, although Muir&#x27;s &quot;Life of Mahomet&quot; and &quot;The Caliphate&quot; &quot;are still considered reliable monuments of scholarship&quot;, his work was characterized by an &quot;impressive antipathy to the Orient, Islam and the Arabs&quot;, and &quot;his attitude towards his subject matter was fairly put by him when he said that &#x27;the sword of Muhammed, and the Kor&#x27;an, are the most stubborn enemies of Civilisation, Liberty, and the Truth which the world has yet known&#x27;&quot;. Daniel Martin Varisco rejects Said&#x27;s assessment that Muir&#x27;s &quot;Life&quot; was considered reliable by the 1970s. He writes &quot;Serious historians had long since relegated Muir&#x27;s work to the rare-books sections of their libraries.&quot;

=== Other works ===
Muir&#x27;s later &quot;Annals&quot; was received with fewer reservations by the &quot;Times&quot; reviewer and other newspapers of the day. It was the &quot;Annals&quot; that established Muir&#x27;s reputation as a leading scholar on Islam in Britain. Nevertheless, his earlier hypercritical &quot;Life of Mahomet&quot; was used as a poster child by contemporary Muslim commentators—especially by Indian ones connected to the movement of Syed Ahmed Khan—to dismiss all criticism of their society emanating from Western scholars. Syed Ameer Ali went as far as to declare Muir &quot;Islam&#x27;s avowed enemy&quot;.

An illustrative aspect in the evolution of Muir&#x27;s positions is his stance on the Crusades. In his writings of the 1840s, he goaded Christian scholars to verbal warfare against Muslims using aggressive crusader imagery. Fifty year later, Muir redirected the invective hitherto reserved for the Muslims to the crusading leaders and armies, and while still finding some faults with the former, he praised Saladin for knightly values. (Muir&#x27;s anti-Catholic animus may have played a role in this too.) Despite his later writings, Muir&#x27;s reputation as an unfair critic of Islam remained strong in Muslim circles. Powell finds that William Muir deserves much of the criticism laid by Edward Said and his followers against 19th century Western scholarship on Islam.

Muir was a committed Evangelical Christian and was invited to preface many missionary biographies and memoirs, speak at conferences and to publicise Zenana missions. He wrote &quot;If Christianity is anything, it must be everything. It cannot brook a rival, nor cease to wage war against all other faiths, without losing its strength and virtue.&quot; In his official capacity as principal of Edinburgh University, Muir chaired many meetings of Evangelists at the university, organised to support overseas missionary efforts, and addressed by speakers such as Henry Drummond. In India, William Muir founded the Indian Christian village Muirabad, near Allahabad. Muir was impressed with the discovery of the &quot;Apology of al-Kindy&quot;; he lectured on it at the Royal Asiatic Society, presenting it as an important link in what he saw as a chain of notable conversions to Christianity, and later he published the translated sources. A proselytising text, &quot;Bakoorah shahiya&quot; (&quot;Sweet First Fruits&quot;) was published under his name as well, but this work had actually been written by a convert to Protestantism from Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

In &quot;The Mohammedan Controversy&quot;, he wrote: 

Daniel Pipes investigated the origin of the phrase &quot;Satanic Verses&quot;, and concluded that despite Salman Rushdie&#x27;s claim that he had borrowed the phrase from Tabari, the earliest traceable occurrence is in Muir&#x27;s &quot;Life of Mohamet&quot; (1858) in a passage discussing &quot;two Satanic verses&quot;. The phrase does not appear in the revised edition of 1912 though.

==Statuary==
A marble statue by George Blackall Simmonds was erected in his honour and unveiled by the then Viceroy of India at the opening of Muir College on 8 April 1886, and was still there in 2012. Another was proposed for the Muslim college, but due to opposition the scheme was dropped.

==Family==
He was the brother of the indologist John Muir. He married Elizabeth Huntly Wemyss in 1840 (died 1897), and had five sons and six daughters; four of his sons served in India, and one of them, Colonel A. M. Muir (died 1899), was Political Officer for South Baluchistan, and was acting British Resident in Nepal when he died. One daughter, Jane, married Colonel Andrew Wauchope and lived at Edinburgh Castle. One of his sons-in-law was the civil servant William Henry Lowe.

<doc id="1084681" wikidata="Q2246542" url="?curid=1084681" title="Agoh–Giuga conjecture">
<text>In number theory the Agoh–Giuga conjecture on the Bernoulli numbers &quot;B&quot;&quot;k&quot; postulates that &quot;p&quot; is a prime number if and only if 

:formula_1 

It is named after Takashi Agoh and Giuseppe Giuga.

==Equivalent formulation==
The conjecture as stated above is due to Takashi Agoh (1990); an equivalent formulation is due to Giuseppe Giuga, from 1950, to the effect that &quot;p&quot; is prime if and only if

:formula_2

which may also be written as

:formula_3

It is trivial to show that &quot;p&quot; being prime is sufficient for the second equivalence to hold, since if &quot;p&quot; is prime, Fermat&#x27;s little theorem states that

:formula_4

for formula_5, and the equivalence follows, since formula_6

==Status==
The statement is still a conjecture since it has not yet been proven that if a number &quot;n&quot; is not prime (that is, &quot;n&quot; is composite), then the formula does not hold. It has been shown that a composite number &quot;n&quot; satisfies the formula if and only if it is both a Carmichael number and a Giuga number, and that if such a number exists, it has at least 13,800 digits (Borwein, Borwein, Borwein, Girgensohn 1996). Laerte Sorini, in a work of 2001 showed that a possible counterexample should be a number &quot;n&quot; greater than  1036067 which represents the limit suggested by Bedocchi for the demonstration technique specified by Giuga to his own conjecture.

==Relation to Wilson&#x27;s theorem==
The Agoh–Giuga conjecture bears a similarity to Wilson&#x27;s theorem, which has been proven to be true. Wilson&#x27;s theorem states that a number &quot;p&quot; is prime if and only if

:formula_7

which may also be written as

:formula_8

For an odd prime p we have

:formula_9

and for p=2 we have

:formula_10

So, the truth of the Agoh–Giuga conjecture combined with Wilson&#x27;s theorem would give: a number &quot;p&quot; is prime if and only if
:formula_11

and

:formula_12

<doc id="1084692" wikidata="Q2991029" url="?curid=1084692" title="Earl of Menteith">
<text>The Mormaer or Earl of Menteith was the ruler of the province of Menteith in the Middle Ages. The first mormaer is usually regarded as Gille Críst (or Gilchrist), simply because he is the earliest on record. The title was held in a continuous line from Gille Críst until Muireadhach IV (a.k.a. Murdoch Stewart, Duke of Albany), although the male line was broken on two occasions. A truncated version of the earldom was given two years later to Malise Graham, 1st Earl of Menteith, in compensation for loss of the Earldom of Strathearn, which was a likely result of the execution of the Duke of Albany.

==List of holders==

===First line of mormaers/earls===
*Gille Críst, Earl of Menteith (Gilcrist) (d. 1189)
*Muireadhach I, Earl of Menteith (d. 1213)
*Muireadhach II, Earl of Menteith (d. 1234)
*Isabella, Countess of Menteith
**m. Walter Comyn, Lord of Badenoch assumed the peerage in her right.
*Mary I, Countess of Menteith
**m. Walter &quot;Bailloch&quot; Stewart

===Second line, Stewarts of Menteith===
*Alexander, Earl of Menteith 
*Alan, Earl of Menteith
*Alan II, Earl of Menteith
*Muireadhach III, Earl of Menteith (d. 1332)
*Mary Menteith, Countess of Menteith
**m. Sir John Graham assumed the peerage in her right.
*Margaret, Countess of Menteith 
**m. Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany 
*Muireadhach IV Stewart, Earl of Menteith, executed in 1425 and the peerages forfeited.

===Third line, Grahams of Menteith===
*Malise Graham, 1st Earl of Menteith (1406–1490) 
*Alexander Graham, 2nd Earl of Menteith (c. 1475–c. 1537)
*William Graham, 3rd Earl of Menteith (c. 1500–c. 1543)
*John Graham, 4th Earl of Menteith (c. 1529–c. 1565)
*William Graham, 5th Earl of Menteith (c. 1555–c. 1578)
*John Graham, 6th Earl of Menteith (c. 1571–c. 1598) 
*William Graham, 7th Earl of Menteith (c. 1591–1661), also created Earl of Airth in 1633
*William Graham, 8th Earl of Menteith (c. 1634–1694), extinct or dormant after his death on 12 September 1694

*Stuart-Menteth Baronets 
The Stuart-Menteth Baronetcy, of Closeburn in the County of Dumfries and Mansfield in the County of Ayr, is a title in the Baronetage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 11 August 1838 for Charles Stuart-Menteth. The Stuart-Menteth family traces its descent from Walter Comyn (third son of Walter Comyn, Justiciar of Scotia), who in 1258 married Isabella, Countess of Menteith (or Menteth).

<text>Cluster &amp; Eno is a collaborative album by German electronic music group Cluster and English ambient musician Brian Eno. The style of this album is a collection of gentle melodies: a mixture of Eno&#x27;s ambient sensibilities and Cluster&#x27;s avant-garde style.

In June 1977, the duo of Hans-Joachim Roedelius and Dieter Moebius joined with Brian Eno for recording sessions at Conny Plank&#x27;s studio. The first release from those sessions on Sky Records was &quot;Cluster &amp; Eno&quot;. Guest musicians on the album included Can bassist Holger Czukay and Asmus Tietchens on synthesizer. The association with Eno, already well known for involvement with pop acts like Roxy Music, brought Cluster a much wider audience than previous albums and international attention.

Sky Records issued the album on CD in 1989, shuffling the running order. The American Gyroscope label reissued &quot;Cluster &amp; Eno&quot; on CD in 1996. The album was also reissued in the United States by the San Francisco–based Water label in 2005.

<text>James Innell Packer (22 July 192617 July 2020) was an English-born Canadian evangelical theologian, cleric and writer in the low-church Anglican and Calvinist traditions. Having been considered as one of the most influential evangelicals in North America, Packer is known for his 1973 best-selling book &quot;Knowing God&quot;, along with his work as the general editor of the English Standard Version Bible. He was one of the high-profile signers on the 1978 Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy, a member on the advisory board of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood, and also was involved in the ecumenical book &quot;Evangelicals and Catholics Together&quot; in 1994. His last teaching position was as the board of governors&#x27; Professor of Theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia, in which he served from 1996 until his retirement in 2016 due to failing eyesight.

== Life and career ==

Packer was born on 22 July 1926 in Twyning, Gloucestershire, England to James and Dorothy Packer. His sister, Margaret, was born in 1929. His father was a clerk for the Great Western Railway and his lower-middle-class family was only nominally Anglican, attending the local St. Catherine&#x27;s Church. When he was seven, Packer suffered a severe head injury in a collision with a bread van, which precluded him from playing sports, so he became interested in reading and writing. At 11 years of age, Packer was gifted with an old Oliver typewriter. He went on to cherish typewriters for the rest of his life. In 1937, Packer went to The Crypt School, where he specialized in the classics. At age 14 he was confirmed at St. Catherine&#x27;s church.

He won a scholarship to the University of Oxford, where he was educated at Corpus Christi College, obtaining his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1948. In a 1944 meeting of the Oxford Inter-Collegiate Christian Union (OICCU), Packer committed his life to Christian service. It was during this time that Packer became exposed to the Puritans through OICCU&#x27;s library, which were an influence he carried for the rest of his life. He also first heard lectures from C. S. Lewis at Oxford, whose teachings would (though he never knew Lewis personally) become a major influence in his life.

After college, he spent a brief time teaching Greek and Latin at Oak Hill College in London. During this 1949–1950 school year, he sat under the teaching of Martyn Lloyd-Jones at Westminster Chapel, who also would have a great influence on his thinking, and who he would know and interact with later. In 1949, Packer went back to Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, in 1949 to study theology. He obtained his Master of philosophy degree in 1954, and Doctor of Philosophy in 1954. He wrote his dissertation under Geoffrey Nuttall on the soteriology of the Puritan theologian Richard Baxter. He was ordained a deacon in 1952 and priest in 1953 in the Church of England, within which he was associated with the evangelical movement. He served as assistant curate of Harborne Heath in Birmingham from 1952 to 1954. In 1954, Packer married Kit Mullet, and they had three children, Ruth, Naomi, and Martin.

In 1955, his family moved to Bristol and Packer taught at Tyndale Hall, Bristol, from 1955 to 1961. He wrote an article denouncing Keswick theology as Pelagian in the &quot;Evangelical Quarterly&quot;. According to biographer Alister McGrath, it is widely agreed that his critique &quot;marked the end of the dominance of the Keswick approach among younger evangelicals&quot;. It was also during this time that he published his first book, &quot;Fundamentalism and the Word of God&quot; (1958), a defense of the authority of the Bible, which sold 20,000 copies in that year and has been in print since. Packer moved back to Oxford in 1961, where he served as librarian of Latimer House in Oxford from 1961 to 1962 and warden from 1962 to 1969, an evangelical research centre he founded with John Stott. In 1970, he became principal of Tyndale Hall, Bristol, and from 1971 until 1979 he was associate principal of the newly formed Trinity College, Bristol, which had been formed from the amalgamation of Tyndale Hall with Clifton College and Dalton House-St Michael&#x27;s. He became editor of the &quot;Evangelical Quarterly&quot; in the 1960s, and eventually published a series of articles he wrote in the journal into a book, &quot;Knowing God&quot;. The book, published by Hodder &amp; Stoughton in Britain and InterVarsity Press in the United States in 1973, became a bestseller of international fame and sold over 1.5 million copies. In 1977, he signed the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy.

In 1979, one of Packer&#x27;s Oxford friends persuaded him to teach at Regent College in Vancouver, eventually being named the first Sangwoo Youtong Chee Professor of Theology, a title he held until he was named a Regent College Board of Governors&#x27; Professor of Theology in 1996. At Regent he taught many classes, including systematic theology and the Puritans.

He was a prolific writer and frequent lecturer, and a frequent contributor to and an executive editor of &quot;Christianity Today&quot;. Packer served as general editor of the English Standard Version (ESV), an evangelical translation based upon the Revised Standard Version of the Bible, and theological editor of the &quot;ESV Study Bible&quot;.

Packer was associated with St. John&#x27;s Shaughnessy Anglican Church, which in February 2008 voted to schism from the Anglican Church of Canada over the issue of same-sex blessings. The departing church, St. John&#x27;s Vancouver, joined the Anglican Network in Canada (ANiC). Packer, on 23 April, handed in his licence from the Bishop of New Westminster. (ANiC eventually co-founded and joined the Anglican Church in North America in 2009.) In December 2008, Packer was appointed an honorary clerical canon of St Andrew&#x27;s Cathedral in Sydney in recognition of his long and distinguished ministry as a faithful teacher of biblical theology.

Packer had been the theologian emeritus of the Anglican Church in North America (ACNA) since its creation in 2009, being one of the nine members of the task force who wrote on a trial basis &quot;Texts for Common Prayer&quot;, released in 2013, and general editor of the task force who wrote for trial use &quot;To Be a Christian: An Anglican Catechism&quot;, approved on 8 January 2014 by the College of Bishops of the church. He was awarded the St. Cuthbert&#x27;s Cross at the Provincial Assembly of ACNA on 27 June 2014 by retiring Archbishop Robert Duncan for his &quot;unparalleled contribution to Anglican and global Christianity&quot;.

In 2016, Packer&#x27;s eyesight deteriorated due to macular degeneration to a point where he could no longer read or write, consequently concluding his public ministry.

Packer died on 17 July 2020, five days before his 94th birthday.

==Theological views==
Packer held to the soteriological position known as Calvinism.

Packer had signed the &quot;Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy&quot;, affirming the conservative evangelical position on biblical inerrancy.

On gender roles, Packer was a complementarian and served on the advisory board of the Council on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood. He thus subscribed to a view of gender roles such that a husband should lovingly lead, protect and provide for his wife and that a wife should joyfully affirm and submit to her husband&#x27;s leadership. Complementarians also believe the Bible teaches that men are to bear primary responsibility to lead in the church and that as such only men should be elders. In 1991 Packer set forth his reasons for this in an influential yet controversial article called &quot;Let&#x27;s Stop Making Women Presbyters&quot;.

Packer endorsed and supported books that have advocated for theistic evolution, but also expressed caution towards the validity of evolution.

In recent years, he had supported the ecumenical movement, which drew criticism from other evangelicals. Specifically, Packer&#x27;s involvement in the book &quot;Evangelicals and Catholics Together: Toward a Common Mission&quot; (ECT) was sharply criticised, but he defended ECT by arguing that believers should set aside denominational differences for the sake of winning converts to Christianity.

Packer took the side of evangelical ecumenism in opposition to Martyn Lloyd-Jones in 1966, then co-authored a work with two Anglo-Catholics in 1970 (&quot;Growing into Union&quot;) that many evangelicals felt conceded too much biblical ground on critical doctrinal issues. The publication of that work led to the formal break between Lloyd-Jones and Packer, bringing an end to the Puritan Conferences.

<text>Coombe is a settlement in the English county of Kent. It lies between Ash-next-Sandwich and Woodnesborough.

According to Edward Hasted in 1800, it was a hamlet in the western section of the parish of Woodnesborough.

Coombe Lane passes through the small settlement between Ash towards New Street (heading to Woodnesborough). Coombe Lane Cottage is a Grade II Listed cottage on the lane.

==Etymology==
The village&#x27;s name derives from Ancient Celtic &quot;cumbā&quot; &quot;valley&quot; which was taken into Old English. The name was recorded as &quot;æt cumban&quot; in 1005, the first word æt representing &#x27;&#x27;.

<doc id="1084750" wikidata="Q5167577" url="?curid=1084750" title="Coombe, Kingston upon Thames">
<text>Coombe is a historic neighbourhood in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames in south west London, England. It sits on high ground, east of Norbiton. Most of the area was part of the former Municipal Borough of Malden and Coombe before local government re-organisation in 1965. It now shares borders with the boroughs of Merton and Sutton with, to the north, the small, inter-related neighbourhoods of Kingston Hill and Kingston Vale, beyond which is Richmond Park in Richmond; and Roehampton/Putney Vale in Wandsworth. To the east are public playing fields and Wimbledon Common.

==History==
Coombe centres on what was originally Coombe House, a large residence built in the 1750s. The house, now demolished, was located at the southwest corner of the junction of Coombe Lane (A238) and Traps Lane. Its red brick boundary walls can still be seen on the west side of Traps Lane.

The area has a long history. Roman coins and other ancient remains have been found in the area around Warren Road. Coombe appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Cumbe&quot;. It was held partly by Hunfrid (Humfrey) the Chamberlain and partly by Ansgot the Interpreter. Its domesday assets were: 1½ hides; 4 ploughs, of meadow, herbage worth 4 hogs. It rendered £8.

The Neville name has long been associated with the area. In 1215 King John gave Coombe to Hugh de Nevill, and the area was known as Coombe Nevill by 1260. At the beginning of the 14th century the manor was held by William de Nevill. The 1911 Ordnance Survey map identified an estate known as Coombe Nevile at the junction of George and Warren Roads. The present-day cul-de-sac known as Coombe Neville is at the same location. Neville Avenue is a short distance away, south of Coombe Lane.

16th-century records speak of a gallows in Coombe, most likely near what is now Kingsnympton Park estate, reputedly the scene of public executions.

In the early 1700s a public house known as the Fox and Coney was established at the junction of George Road and Kingston Hill (A308). It was rebuilt in 1728 and soon thereafter was renamed the George and Dragon, operating as such until 1985, when it became the Kingston Lodge Hotel.

By 1761 Coombe was owned by John Spencer, 1st Earl Spencer.

Coombe Warren was a wild woodland on the ridge known as Coombe Hill. It was used for hunting and public fairs. &#x27;The Coombe Wood Highwayman&#x27;, Jerry Abershaw, frequented the area in the late 1700s. Being based at the &quot;Bald Face Stag&quot; pub, he sheltered in the woods. An 1835 map placed Coombe Warren in an area now bisected by Warren Road between Kingston Hill (A308) and Coombe Lane (A238). Portions of the Warren are now covered by the Coombe Hill estate and Coombe Wood Golf Course.

In 1822 the Admiralty opened a semaphore station in the Warren, which was part of the semaphore line from London to Portsmouth. The station has disappeared, but survived in the name of &quot;Telegraph Cottage.&quot;

At the time of the 1865 Ordnance Survey, the area west of Warren Road remained largely open country. By 1911 two golf courses were in place, as were a number of large houses located along George Road, including Coombe Croft briefly home to John Galsworthy&#x27;s family, (now Rokeby School for Boys), Coombe Ridge (now Holy Cross Preparatory School), Coombe Court, Coombe End, Ballard Coombe and Fairview.

Numerous German bombs struck Coombe during World War II.

==Today==

Coombe is a prestigious residential location, with a premium on house prices. Much of the area is occupied by two golf courses, Coombe Wood and Coombe Hill; and three private estates partly on private roads, though in practice access is mostly open, apart from Coombe Park. These are called Coombe Hill, Coombe Warren and Coombe Park. Once the site of now-demolished Coombe Warren, a 19th-century property built by architect George Devey, Coombe Hill estate today consists of Coombe Hill Road and cul-de-sacs such as Greenwood Park and Devey Close; and along Warren Road, George Road and Golf Club Drive.

Kennedy was a career minor league catcher who played in the Orioles, St. Louis Cardinals and Los Angeles Dodgers farm systems. In 510 career games, he hit .238 with 12 homers and 178 RBI. While with the Pawtucket Red Sox in 1981, he was the only player from either team to not play in the longest professional baseball game of all time versus the Rochester Red Wings.

He retired from playing after the 1983 season and became a manager in the Dodgers farm system for the Great Falls Dodgers (1984–1986), Bakersfield Dodgers (1987), San Antonio Missions (1988) and Albuquerque Dukes (1989–1991).

He was subsequently the bench coach for the Montreal Expos during the 1992 season.

===Managerial career===
====Texas Rangers====
He then was hired to manage the Texas Rangers for the 1993 season after the firing of Bobby Valentine and Toby Harrah. Kennedy was let go following the strike-shortened 1994 season after posting only a 52–62 record (even though, at the time of the strike, it was good enough for first place in the division) and was replaced by Johnny Oates.

====Boston Red Sox====
For the 1995 season, Kennedy became the manager for the Boston Red Sox. He led them to their first postseason appearance since 1990, but they were swept by the Cleveland Indians in the playoffs. Kennedy was fired following the 1996 season after going from a .597 to a .525 winning percentage.

====Managerial record====

===Broadcasting career===
In 1997 Kennedy joined ESPN as a color analyst on the network&#x27;s &quot;Wednesday Night Baseball&quot; telecasts, performing the same role on ESPN Radio&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; in 1998 and on Fox Sports Net&#x27;s &quot;Thursday Night Baseball&quot; in 1999 and 2000. From 2001 to 2008, he was a studio analyst for baseball on Fox, teaming with host Jeanne Zelasko. He also contributed to Fox Sports Net&#x27;s &quot;Best Damn Sports Show Period&quot; and hosted a radio program on FOX Sports Radio, and was a regular co-host of &quot;Dodgers Live&quot; on Prime Ticket at this time.

In 2009 Kennedy took a job as a part-time television analyst for the Tampa Bay Rays, sharing the duty with former Rays pitcher Brian Anderson. Kennedy and Anderson both replaced Joe Magrane, who is now a part of the MLB Network. Kennedy returned to the Dodgers&#x27; postgame show for the 2009 postseason.

In October 2010 it was announced that Kennedy would not be returning to the Rays&#x27; broadcast crew in the 2011 season.

Kevin co-hosted &quot;Power Alley&quot; with Jim Duquette on Sirius XM&#x27;s MLB Network Radio on Sirius 209/XM 89 from 10 am – 2 pm EST in 2011.

From 2014 through 2018, Kennedy teamed with Rick Monday to call select games on the Dodgers Radio Network and occasionally co-hosted the team&#x27;s &quot;Dodger Talk&quot; radio post-game show.

=== Other media ===
In October 2019, Kennedy started doing podcasts of &quot;The Kevin Kennedy Show&quot; with Rich Grisham of &quot;Out of the Park Baseball&quot; and launched an official website where he teaches baseball instruction videos, has a blog, and hosts Q&amp;A with fans.

<text>Apophthegmatum opus is a translation of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Apophthegmata&quot; by Erasmus of Rotterdam, a collection of apophthegms from classical antiquity. Many classical apophthegms repeated ideas of Socrates, Plato, and Alexander the Great. According to Speroni, &quot;Apophthegmatum opus&quot; is one of &quot;the most monumental collections of classical apophthegms… ever assembled…&quot; Here are a few samples of Erasmus&#x27; apophthegms:

While on the march with his army one winter, Alexander the Great was sitting by a campfire, watching the army as it marched by. He noticed an old warrior shivering from the cold, trying to find a place near the fire. Alexander bade the man sit in his own chair, saying, &quot;If you had been born a Persian, it would cost you your head to sit in the king&#x27;s chair, but you are a Macedonian, not a Persian. Sit.&quot;

Metellus once accused Cicero of having caused more people to die through his personal testimony than he had saved through his representing them in court. Cicero responded, &quot;Indeed, for my integrity exceeds my eloquence.&quot;

A certain young gentleman who had come to Rome from the provinces was found to bear an astonishing resemblance to Augustus Caesar. Hearing this, Augustus had the man brought before him. Perceiving the close resemblance, Augustus asked him, &quot;Tell me, did your mother ever spend any time in Rome?&quot; The quick-witted provincial shot back, &quot;My mother, never; my father, often.&quot;

One of Socrates&#x27; lessons was that men should abstain from foods that might provoke a man to eat when he has no hunger, and drinks that might provoke him to drink when he has no thirst. He went on to say that the best sauce in the world is to be hungry.

<doc id="1084758" wikidata="Q346677" url="?curid=1084758" title="Adagia">
<text>Adagia (singular &quot;adagium&quot;) is the title of an annotated collection of Greek and Latin proverbs, compiled during the Renaissance by Dutch humanist Desiderius Erasmus Roterodamus. Erasmus&#x27; repository of proverbs is &quot;one of the most monumental ... ever assembled&quot; (Speroni, 1964, p. 1).

The first edition, titled &quot;Collectanea Adagiorum&quot;, was published in Paris in 1500, in a slim quarto of around eight hundred entries. By 1508, after his stay in Italy, Erasmus had expanded the collection (now called &quot;Adagiorum chiliades tres&quot; or &quot;Three thousands of proverbs&quot;) to over 3,000 items, many accompanied by richly annotated commentaries, some of which were brief essays on political and moral topics. The work continued to expand right up to the author&#x27;s death in 1536 (to a final total of 4,151 entries), confirming the fruit of Erasmus&#x27; vast reading in ancient literature.

==Commonplace examples from &quot;Adagia&quot;==
Some of the adages have become commonplace in many European languages. Equivalents in English include:

Seventy of the Adages were from Aesop&#x27;s fables.

== Context ==


The work reflects a typical Renaissance attitude toward classical texts: to wit, that they were fit for appropriation and amplification, as expressions of a timeless wisdom first uncovered by the classical authors. It is also an expression of the contemporary humanism; the &quot;Adagia&quot; could only have happened via the developing intellectual environment in which careful attention to a broader range of classical texts produced a much fuller picture of the literature of antiquity than had been possible, or desired, in medieval Europe. In a period in which &quot;sententiæ&quot; were often marked by special fonts and footnotes in printed texts, and in which the ability to use classical wisdom to bolster modern arguments was a critical part of scholarly and even political discourse, it is not surprising that Erasmus&#x27; &quot;Adagia&quot; was among the most popular volumes of the century.

Erasmus originally intended to include Biblical adages, parables and imagery, however this was too ambitious; he later addressed these with his New Testament &quot;Annotations&quot; and &quot;Paraphrases&quot;.

(A complete annotated translation into English. There is a one-volume selection: Erasmus, Desiderius. &quot;Adages&quot;. Ed. William Barker. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2001.)

===Between friends all is common===
The place of honour as first entry of the &quot;Adagia&quot; is (.) Erasmus&#x27; commentary goes beyond friendship to discussion of the attitude towards property and communal ownership by classical Greek philosophers and Christ. Not surprising for someone under a religious vow of poverty and common ownership, Erasmus comes down on the side of friendly sharing of life and property.

=== &quot;Sileni Alcibiadis&quot; (The &quot;Sileni of Alcibiadis&quot;) ===

An unprepossessing exterior may hide a beautiful interior (and &quot;vice versa&quot;.) The incarnation of Christ is the highest example.

=== Bidden or unbidden, God is always there ===
Erasmus traces this back through the Romans () to a Spartan saying. Carl Jung reputedly had this enscribed on his study door.

<text>The Rocklopedia Fakebandica, by T. Mike Childs, is an illustrated encyclopedia of fictional musical groups and musicians, as seen in movies and television. It was officially released November 6, 2004. The book catalogs such fake bands as Spinal Tap, The Blues Brothers, The Rutles, and The Chipmunks, along with less well known ones.

The book grew out of a website started by the author in 2000. The website includes fictional bands from other sources, such as books and TV commercials, as well as bands not found in the book. On April 1, 2024, &quot;The Rocklopedia Fakebandica&quot; podcast debuted on both Apple Podcasts and Spotify. Hosted by T.

<text>The Molendinar Burn is a burn in Glasgow, Scotland. It was the site of the settlement, Mellingdenor, that grew to become the kernel of Glasgow, and where St Mungo founded his church in the 6th century. It was later used to power the growing town&#x27;s mills and the name became adapted because the word &quot;molendinar&quot; means &quot;relating to a mill or millers&quot;, possibly because that is what the Welsh name Mellingdenor originally meant.

== Historic Course (late 1700s) ==
Richard Thomas&#x27; 1795 &quot;Map of the town of Glasgow &amp; country around&quot; clearly shows the course of the burn. The source at that time was a small loch at &quot;Huggenfield&quot; to the north east of the city (the present day Hogganfield Loch). The course then headed generally south west, passing through the virtually undeveloped areas of Craighead, Blackhill and Blochairn, where it passed under the Monkland Canal. Approaching the city, the course turned south past &quot;Kirk&quot; and down the route of the present day Wishart Street, passing under what are now Duke Street and Gallowgate to pass in front of St Andrew&#x27;s Church. Saltmarket south of Bridgegate did not exist at that time, the burn ran through fields there to enter the Clyde at the present day Clyde Street at Mart Street. Peter Fleming&#x27;s 1807 &quot;Map of the City of Glasgow and suburbs&quot; shows the city centre area of the burn in greater detail. It can be seen from both of these maps that the burn ran almost entirely above ground at that time.

== Present Course (2020) ==
The present source of the burn is Frankfield Loch in Cardowan. This loch did not exist (or was not mapped) when Thomas published his 1795 map. A short man-made cut connects Frankfield Loch to the distant Hogganfield Loch. The route from Hogganfield Loch to the River Clyde is fairly similar to that of 1795. However the majority of the length of the burn has been culverted in stages since the 1870s. Short stretches of the burn can be seen above ground in Molendinar Park (in the Blackhill / Provanmill area) and beside the former Great Eastern Hotel on Duke Street.

The final stretch from Greendyke to the Clyde was rerouted at some time in the past. The burn now enters the Clyde upstream of the 1795 confluence point, near the Tidal Weir.

<text>James Outram Fraser (Chinese: 富能仁; 1886–1938) was an English Protestant Christian missionary to China with the China Inland Mission. He pioneered work among the Lisu people, of Southwestern China, in the early part of the 20th century. He is credited with developing the Fraser script for their language.

== Early life ==
Born in London in 1886. Fraser had four brothers and sisters. His parents divorced when Fraser was a teen, his mother moving to Letchworth, buying property with her own funds.

By 1906, he was at Imperial College London studying engineering. Fraser was accomplished in piano and held a recital in his twenties before he left for China.

==First years in Yunnan==
He became a graduate engineer. However, in 1908 he dedicated his life to missionary work and joined the China Inland Mission. He arrived in China at 22 and travelled from Shanghai to Hong Kong and then to the mountainous region of China&#x27;s far southwest.

He was forced by the chaos accompanying the Chinese Revolution of 1911 to divide his time between Yunnan Province and Burma. He learned the Lisu language and commenced his work among the Lisu, a Tibeto-Burmese minority people who lived in the high mountains along the borders of the two countries.

Fraser had arrived in Yunnan in 1910 and spent nearly thirty years working among the Lisu. Fraser is best known for the alphabet he created for the Lisu, often referred to as the Fraser alphabet. It was designed for purpose of translating the New Testament into the Lisu language. Fraser also designed a written musical notation for transcribing the Lisu&#x27;s oral history songs.

Going to China with CIM (China Inland Mission), he was stationed in the then remote province of Yunnan to work with the local Chinese, but Fraser was a keen climber and revelled in climbing through the mountains meeting and preaching to the Lisu people, particularly in the upper Salween River valley. Readily accepted by them and able to live in their mud floor huts, he was able to communicate a little through Chinese and then to learn their language, which is in the Tibeto-Burman group. Initial success was followed by years of doubt and difficulty until 1916, when he and fellow missionaries started to see scores of families convert to Christianity and enthusiastically pursue a new life without the fear of the spirits that had previously characterised them.

By 1918, sparked by family evangelism carried on by the people themselves, 600 believers had been baptised. Fraser was known for his ability to organise the people into strong indigenous churches that became models for church-planting ventures not only for other minority peoples in China&#x27;s southwest but also for other

Aware that they would soon need material in their language, he began work immediately on Mark&#x27;s gospel and a hymnbook since they showed great interest in writing and were already great singers and natural musicians.

==Furlough and marriage==
Fraser went back to England on furlough in 1924 and when he returned to &quot;Lisuland&quot; in 1929, he was married, to Roxie Dymond, the daughter of a Methodist missionary stationed in Kunming.

==Revival and the Fraser alphabet==
Fraser developed a script for the Lisu language and used it to prepare a catechism, portions of Scripture and eventually, with much help from his colleagues, a complete New Testament. Working initially on Mark and John and then on a handbook of Lisu history and language, Fraser handed on the translation task to Allyn Cooke and his wife, Leila. He came back to help the team with revision and checking in the mid-1930s. The complete New Testament was finished in 1936.

Fraser maintained a consistent policy of training the Lisu converts (usually whole households and whole villages at a time) to be self-supporting and to pay for their own books and church buildings. They raised their own funds for the support of pastors, of wives and children of their travelling evangelists and of festivals and other occasions. Unlike other missionaries of his generation, Fraser would not pay local preachers to go out or for building local church structures. That was something that put the Lisu in good stead for the years of Japanese occupation and the Communist persecution, particularly during the Cultural Revolution.

Nevertheless, tens of thousands of them fled during this era to neighbouring Burma and Thailand. Fraser also left church government in the hands of Lisu elders; very little imprint was made on them that had a home church character, other than the tremendous prayer support the Fraser organised back in England for the Lisu and his work.

Throughout the 1930s, other missionaries came to assist in the work, but the bulk of the conversions happened as a result of Lisu evangelists covering the ground and reaching not only the Lisu but also the Kachin and Yi people (Nosu). Revivals also broke out at this time. It is acknowledged by the Chinese government that by the 1990s, over 90% of the Lisu in China were Christian.

==Final years and legacy==
Fraser wrote many articles in English for &quot;The Chinese Recorder&quot; and &quot;China&#x27;s Millions&quot;. After seeing great fruit for his labours, James Outram Fraser died in Baoshan, in Western Yunnan in 1938 of cerebral malaria, leaving his pregnant wife and two children. He was 52.

His main biographer was Mrs. Howard Taylor, who published &quot;Behind The Ranges&quot; in 1944, containing numerous extracts from his letters and diaries. His daughter, Eileen Crossman, gives his biography, &quot;Mountain Rain&quot;, in 1982, much of her material being drawn from Taylor (1944). Fraser&#x27;s grave is now at the Qing Hua church.
 

In 1992, the Chinese government officially recognised the Fraser alphabet as the official script of the Lisu language. Today, Fraser is remembered as one of Christianity&#x27;s most successful missionaries to East Asia in modern times.

Christianity is thriving in the Salween River valley, where the Lisu live nearly 70 years after the death of Fraser. Of the 18,000 Lisu who lived in Fugong in 1950, 3,400 professed faith in Christ. As of 2007, there are estimated to be 80–90 percent of the 70,000 making the same profession. In Yunnan it is estimated that there are 100,000–200,000 total Lisu Christians in the Lisu Church. More than 75,000 Lisu Bibles have been legally printed in China following the explosive growth.

<text>Jan Altink (; 21 October 1885 – 6 December 1971) was a Dutch expressionist painter and cofounder of De Ploeg.

== Life ==
Jan Altink was born on 21 October 1885 in Groningen in the Netherlands.

He studied at the Kunstnijverheidsschool (circa 1900) and Academie Minerva (circa 1911). In 1918, he was a cofounder of the artists&#x27; association and movement De Ploeg. It was named in reference to breaking new ground.

Altink&#x27;s work was included in the 1939 exhibition and sale &quot;Onze Kunst van Heden&quot; (Our Art of Today) at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

Altink died, at the age of 86, in the city of Groningen on 6 December 1971.

== Work ==
Auction house Christie&#x27;s described Altink as being &quot;widely regarded as the purest &#x27;Groninger&#x27; of all Ploeg artists&quot;.

After studying paintings alleged to be the work of Altink, Dutch art expert Milko den Leeuw testified in a forgery case that the pictological “handwriting” of some works that had been contributed to him did not match his other paintings, but were a perfect match for those produced by an accused forger, the Dutch painter and art collector Cor van Loenen, under his own name.

<text>Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s Piano Sonata No. 7 in D major, Op. 10, No. 3, was dedicated to the Countess Anne Margarete von Browne, and written in 1798. This makes it contemporary with his three Op. 9 string trios, his three Op. 12 violin sonatas, and the violin and orchestra romance that became his Op. 50 when later published. The year also saw the premiere of a revised version of his second piano concerto, whose original form had been written and heard in 1795.

==Structure==

It is divided into four movements:
== Analysis ==
The Op. 10 sonatas are usually described as angular or experimental, as Beethoven began moving further and further away from his earlier models. This third sonata of the set is the longest at approximately 24 minutes. It is the only one of the Op. 10 sonatas that has four movements. The second movement is famous for its intimations of later tragic slow movements, as well as for its own beauty.

=== I. Presto ===

The first movement is in sonata form.

=== II. Largo e mesto ===

The second movement is in ternary form.

=== III. Menuetto: Allegro ===

The third movement is in ternary form.

=== IV. Rondo ===

The fourth movement is in rondo form.

<text>was a after &quot;Tenmei&quot; and before &quot;Kyōwa&quot;. This period spanned the years from January 1789 through February 1801. The reigning emperor was .

==Change of era==
* 1789 : The new era name of &quot; Kansei&quot; (meaning &quot;Tolerant Government&quot; or &quot;Broad-minded Government&quot;) was created to mark a number of calamities, including a devastating fire at the Imperial Palace. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in &quot;Tenmei&quot; 9, on the 25th day of the 1st month.

==Events of the Kansei era==
The broad panoply of changes and new initiatives of the Tokugawa shogunate during this era became known as the Kansei Reforms.

Matsudaira Sadanobu (1759–1829) was named the shōgun&#x27;s chief councilor (&quot;rōjū&quot;) in the summer of 1787; and early in the next year, he became the regent for the 11th shōgun, Tokugawa Ienari. As the chief administrative decision-maker in the &quot;bakufu&quot; hierarchy, he was in a position to effect radical change; and his initial actions represented an aggressive break with the recent past. Sadanobu&#x27;s efforts were focused on strengthening the government by reversing many of the policies and practices which had become commonplace under the regime of the previous shōgun, Tokugawa Ieharu. These reform policies could be interpreted as a reactionary response to the excesses of his &quot;rōjū&quot; predecessor, Tanuma Okitsugu (1719–1788); and the result was that the Tanuma-initiated, liberalizing reforms within the &quot;bakufu&quot; and the relaxation of &quot;sakoku&quot; (Japan&#x27;s &quot;closed-door&quot; policy of strict control of foreign merchants) were reversed or blocked.

* 1790 (&quot;Kansei 2&quot;): Sadanobu and the shogunate promulgate an edict addressed to , the rector of the Edo Confucian Academy -- &quot;The Kansei Prohibition of Heterodox Studies&quot; (&quot;kansei igaku no kin&quot;). The decree banned certain publications and enjoined strict observance of Neo-Confucian doctrine, especially with regard to the curriculum of the official Hayashi school.

<text>is a Japanese era name (年号, &quot;nengō&quot;, literally &quot;years name&quot;) for the years between the An&#x27;ei Era and before the Kansei Era, from April 1781 through January 1789. The reigning emperor was .

==Change of era==
* 1781 : The new era name of Tenmei (meaning &quot;dawn&quot;) was created to mark the enthronement of Emperor Kōkaku. The previous era ended and the new one commenced on the second day of the fourth month in what had been An&#x27;ei 11.

As is customary for choosing nengō, the name was selected from a passage in a historical Chinese text. In this case, the text was &quot;Classic of History&quot; (書経) (also quoted in &quot;The Great Learning&quot; (大學)), more specifically from the first of the King Tai Jia (大甲) chapters. It says: &quot;先王顧諟天之明命...&quot; meaning &quot;The former king kept his eye continually on the bright requirements of Heaven, [and...].&quot; This is continued with a description of reverence, virtue, and prosperity for the lands. From this, the two characters 天 and 明 were selected.

==Events of the Tenmei Era==
* 1782 (Tenmei 2): The Tenmei famine is said to have begun.
* 1782 (Tenmei 2): An analysis of silver currency in China and Japan was presented to the Emperor by Minamoto no Masatsuna.
* 1783 (Tenmei 3): erupted in Shinano province, only 80 miles northwest of Edo, with a loss of life estimated at more than 20,000 (Tenmei eruption). [Today, Asama-yama&#x27;s location is better described as on the border between Gunma Prefecture and Nagano Prefecture]. Japanologist Isaac Titsingh&#x27;s published account of the Asama-yama eruption became the first of its kind in the West (1820). The volcano&#x27;s devastation makes the Great Tenmei Famine even worse. Much of the agriculture of Shinano Province and Kōzuke Province remained unproductive or under-producing for the next four or five years.
* 1783 (Tenmei 3): Famine was exacerbated, according to 20th-century studies, because after eight years of near- or actual famine, neither the authorities nor the people had any reserves left to meet further drought and crop failures during the Great Tenmei Famine.
* 1784 (Tenmei 4): Country-wide celebrations took place in honor of Kōbō-Daishi, founder of Shingon Buddhism, who had died 950 years earlier.
* 1784 (Tenmei 4): The son of the Shōgun″s rōjū (chief counselor) was assassinated inside Edo Castle. The comparatively young &quot;wakadoshiyori&quot; (junior counselor) was the son of the senior councilor Tanuma Okitsugu. The younger Tanuma was killed in front of his father as both were returning to their &quot;norimono&quot; (carriage) after a meeting of the Counselors of State had broken up. The involvement of senior figures in the Bakufu was suspected, but no one other than the lone assassin himself was punished. The result was that the liberalizing reforms that the older Tanuma had initiated were blocked.
* September 17, 1786 (Tenmei 6, 25th day of the eighth month): Shōgun Tokugawa Ieharu died and was buried in Edo.
* 1787 (Tenmei 7): Tokugawa Ienari became the 11th Shōgun of the Tokugawa shogunate.
* 1787 (Tenmei 7): Kutsuki Masatsuna published &quot;Seiyō Senpu&quot; (Notes on Western Coinage), with plates showing European and colonial currency.
* 1788 (Tenmei 7): Riots broke out in rice shops in Edo and Osaka.
* 1788 (Tenmei 8): Great Fire of Kyoto. A fire began in the city at three o&#x27;clock in the morning of March 6 (Tenmei 8, 29th day of the first month), and continued to burn uncontrolled until March 8 (first day of the second month). Embers smoldered until they were extinguished by heavy rain on March 11 (fourth day of the second month). The Emperor and his court fled the fire, and the Imperial Palace was destroyed. No other rebuilding was permitted until a new palace was completed. This fire was considered to be a major event. The &quot;opperhoofd&quot; of the VOC &#x27;in Dejima noted in his official record book that &quot;people are considering it to be a great and extraordinary heavenly portent&quot;.

<text>Evert Collier (26 January 1642 – few days before 8 September 1708) was a Dutch Golden Age still-life painter known for vanitas and &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; paintings. His first name is sometimes spelled &quot;Edward&quot; or &quot;Edwaert&quot; or &quot;Eduwaert&quot; or &quot;Edwart,&quot; and his last name is sometimes spelled &quot;Colyer&quot; or &quot;Kollier&quot;.

==Life==
Collier was baptized Evert Calier in Breda, North Brabant. He was trained in Haarlem, where his earliest paintings show the influence of Vincent Laurensz van der Vinne, who became a member of the Haarlem Guild of St. Luke in 1649, and whose son Laurens van der Vinne listed &quot;Evert Colier&quot; in 1702 as one of the Haarlem guild members who had known his father. Van der Vinne was probably his teacher when Collier registered with the Haarlem guild in 1664. They both later influenced the Haarlem still-life painter Barend van Eisen.

By 1667, Collier had moved to Leiden, where he became a member of the Leiden Guild of St. Luke in 1673. He moved to Amsterdam by 1686 and to London in 1693. He returned to Leiden in the years 1702–1706, based on signed and dated works there, but was back in London at the end of his life where he was buried September 8, 1708 at St. James&#x27;s, Piccadilly.

The Denver Art Museum, the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Indianapolis Museum of Art, the National Portrait Gallery (United Kingdom), the Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam) and the Tate (London) are among the public collections having paintings by Evert Collier.

The US historian, Dror Wahrman, has written a book on Collier&#x27;s &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; works, &quot;Mr. Collier&#x27;s Letter Racks&quot; (OUP, 2014). The book brings together a wide range of the painter&#x27;s still lifes from the late 17th and early 18th centuries, mostly from the time when Collier was living in London. Their themes were almost exclusively arrangements of journals, engravings, letters, medals, combs, sealing wax sticks and other ephemera, signifying an updating of the older &quot;memento mori&quot; still life model.

==Works==
His works tend to be an arrangement of pieces of paper painted to &quot;pop out&quot; of the surface in a &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; fashion. Like Van der Vinne before him, he often included prints, but these tended to be popular prints of the day.

An oil on canvas painting (&quot;Vanitas Still Life with Globe, Skull and Violin&quot;) previously attributed to Collier was later attributed to Pieter Legouch.

<text>was a after &quot;Meiwa&quot; and before &quot;Tenmei.&quot; This period spanned the years November 1772 through March 1781. The reigning emperors were and .

==Change of era==
* 1772 : The era name was changed to &quot;An&#x27;ei&quot; (meaning &quot;peaceful eternity&quot;) to mark the enthronement of Emperor Go-Momozono and in hopes of turning attention from the serial catastrophic devastation from fires and storms in &quot;Meiwa&quot; 9. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in the 11th month of &quot;Meiwa&quot; 9.

==Events of the &quot;An&#x27;ei&quot; era==
* 1775 (&quot;An&#x27;ei 4&quot;): Epidemic diseases spread across the country – in Edo alone, an estimated 190,000 perished.
* 1775 (&quot;An&#x27;ei 4&quot;): Swedish physician and botanist Carl Peter Thunberg arrives at VOC outpost or &quot;factory&quot; in Nagasaki bay; and ultimately, his scientific activities will result in the first detailed, descriptive survey of the flora and fauna of the Japanese archipelago.
* 1778 (&quot;An&#x27;ei 7&quot;): Kyoto suffers a massive flood.
* 1778 (&quot;An&#x27;ei 7&quot;): Volcanic island of Sakurajima erupts one mile away from Kagoshima – 16,000 dead.
* 1779 (&quot;An&#x27;ei 8&quot;): Dutch surgeon and cultural-anthropologist Isaac Titsingh arrives at Dejima for the first of three terms as &quot;Opperhoofd&quot; or captain of the VOC station; and ultimately, his seminal research will become a noteworthy step in that process in which the Japanese begin to describe and characterize themselves in their own terms. Titsingh&#x27;s correspondence with William Marsden, a philologist colleague in the Royal Society in London, provides some insight into his personal appreciation of the task at hand. In an 1809 letter, he explains:

:&quot;Bakufu&quot; policy in this era was designed to marginalize the influence of foreigners in &quot;An&#x27;ei&quot; Japan; however, an unintended and opposite consequence of &quot;sakoku&quot; was to enhance the value and significance of a very small number of thoughtful observers like Thunberg and Titsingh, whose writings document what each scholar learned or discovered first-hand. Thunberg&#x27;s and Titsingh&#x27;s published accounts and their unpublished writings provided a unique and useful perspective for Orientalists and Japanologists in the 19th century; and the work of both men continues to be rigorously examined by modern researchers today.
* 1780 (&quot;An&#x27;ei 9&quot;): Heavy rains and floods in the Kantō necessitate extensive government relief in the flood-stricken areas.

<doc id="1084815" wikidata="Q1423977" url="?curid=1084815" title="Kum Nye">
<text>Kum Nye and sKu-mNyé are a wide variety of Tibetan religious and medical body practices. 

Many Tibetan Buddhist and Bon traditions contain Kum Nye practices. These can be entirely different both in purpose and in methods. For instance, some forms are very slow-moving; others are intensely aerobic. The Tibetan Medical Tantras (scriptures) are the basis for some practices, and are mainly therapeutic. Dzogchen is the basis for other practices which are mainly religious in purpose.

Three systems of &quot;sku mnye&quot; have been described and taught in detail in English. These are Kum Nye by Tarthang Tulku, the Aro gTér sKu-mNyé and the systems of &quot;bsku mnye&quot;, that are taught by the International Academy for Traditional Tibetan Medicine and the Shang Shung Institute.

==Etymology==
The two terms Kum Nye and sKu-mNyé are different spellings in the Latin alphabet of the same Tibetan phrase Wylie: &quot;sku mnye&quot;, which literally means &quot;massage of the subtle body&quot;. Some forms of &quot;sku mnye&quot; are vaguely similar to Yoga, Tai chi, Qigong, or therapeutic massage. Kum Nye, Ku Nye, and Kunye are also used to transcribe the Tibetan phrases &quot;dku mnye&quot; (&quot;belly massage&quot;) and &quot;bsku mnye&quot; (oil massage), pronounced identically to &quot;sku mnye&quot;. &quot;dKu mnye&quot; and &quot;bsku mnye&quot; manipulate the physical body, rather than the subtle (energetic) one.

== Tarthang Tulku&#x27;s Kum Nye ==

Lama Tarthang Tulku first introduced Kum Nye into the West. He has written five books on the subject.

This system appears to be largely from the Medical Tantras, but includes exercises similar to those found in the Dzogchen series. It is based on very slow movements, stillness practices, and massage. This Kum Nye has been described as Inner Massage.

=== Exercises ===
To give an example, in the exercise called &quot;flying&quot; the practitioner extends their arms slowly out from the side up to stretching above the head and then slowly back down again. One cycle can take anywhere between 2 and 10 minutes. The practice of breathing in and out of both nose and mouth at the same time is recommended while doing the exercises. The key is to pay close attention to the subtleties of sensations and the quality of experience while doing the exercises, thus linking body and mind in the presence of awareness given to the sensations.

== Aro gTér sKu-mNyé ==
This system is part of the Aro gTér, a Nyingma terma. It is described in detail in the book &quot;moving being&quot;, by Khandro Déchen.

Aro sKu-mNyé belongs to Longdé, the section of Dzogchen concerned with the subtle body. As with all Dzogchen methods, its main goal is to realize rigpa, or non-dual awareness. This is described as &quot;finding the presence of awareness in the dimension of sensation&quot;. Physical exercises are used to &quot;shake&quot; the tsa-lung system of energetic &quot;channels&quot;, winds&quot;, and &quot;essences&quot;. This perceptually disorients the practitioner, and produces &quot;zap nyams&quot;. Zap nyams (Wylie: &quot;zab nyams&quot;), literally &quot;profound experiences&quot; in Tibetan, are described as &quot;intense psychophysical sensations&quot;. These are said to occur in the energetic space that surrounds the body, rather than in the physical body.

Although the purpose of the Aro gTér sKu-mNyé is mainly religious, the system is said also to have a variety of mundane benefits, including more vivid sensory experience, emotional openness, enhanced meditation, physical fitness, and lessening of depression.

In practice, Aro sKu-mNyé is a set of 111 movement exercises divided into series that correspond to the Buddhist five elements. They range from simple and gentle to vigorous and extremely difficult, and bear no similarity to any other Eastern or Western form of exercise. The moving exercises are alternated with periods of motionless meditation. The instructions for the Aro sKu-mNyé exercises frequently give very specific details about eye movements.

Aro sKu-mNyé is taught by instructors certified by a board headed by the Aro Lamas.

=== Exercise example: &quot;waking lion&quot; ===
&quot;lie on your back / legs splayed as far apart as comfortable / arms 90 degrees to your body / palms upwards / eyes closed / simultaneously (with a quick movement) raise your torso and legs (legs straight and locked at the knee) / simultaneously clap feet together and hands together (arms are straight and locked at the elbow) / in the moment of clapping, open eyes wide and shout Ra! (roll the &#x27;R&#x27; to enunciate fiercely) / when clapping feet and hands, eyes, hands, and feet should be at the same height – feet and hands meet at the same level as your eyes; and at this point your bottom is all that is touching the floor / it is important that the back is kept absolutely straight / try to achieve an angle of 45 degrees to the floor, but NOT by bending your back – bending the back will result in injury! / Relax back into the starting position and repeat&quot;
== IATTM Ku Nye ==
The Ku Nye taught by the International Academy for Traditional Tibetan Medicine is a system of therapeutic oil massage. It is based in the Medical Tantras. Its benefits are said to include elimination of toxins, increased vitality, pain reduction, and calming of nervous disorders including insomnia, depression and anxiety.

== Shang Shung Institute Kunye ==
The Shang Shung Institute, affiliated with Chogyal Namkhai Norbu, offers a Training program in Kunye Massage.

<doc id="1084836" wikidata="Q1064724" url="?curid=1084836" title="Sir Charles Hamilton, 2nd Baronet, of Marlborough House">
<text>Admiral Sir Charles Hamilton, 2nd Baronet KCB (25 May 1767 – 14 September 1849), was a British naval officer and commodore-governor of Newfoundland.

==Life==
Hamilton was born the eldest son of John Hamilton, a captain in the Royal Navy who had distinguished himself at the Battle of Quebec in 1775. Charles began his naval career at the age of nine on his father&#x27;s ship, &quot;Hector&quot;. He attended the Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth from 1777 to 1779.

He commanded a number of vessels in the Royal Navy and was also a member of the British parliament several times between 1790 and 1812 while still serving in the Royal Navy. He became the 2nd baronet Hamililton of Trebinshun on his father&#x27;s death in 1784.

From 1818 to 1823 he served as resident governor for the colony of Newfoundland. During this period, he oversaw the reconstruction of St. John&#x27;s following fires in 1818 and 1819. Although he was charged with promoting agriculture, he was soon discouraged by the poor soils of the island. The economy of the island was depressed due to decreased demand for Newfoundland cod and Hamilton encouraged diversification of the fisheries to include whales, seals and salmon.

Hamilton was promoted to admiral on 22 July 1830, and was awarded KCB in 1833.

He died at the family home at Iping, West Sussex in 1849. He had married Henrietta Martha, the daughter of George Drummond, a banker of Stanmore, Middlesex. Their only son, Sir Charles John James Hamilton, 3rd Baronet, also became an Army officer. Lady Hamilton painted a well-known portrait of Demasduit, also called Mary March, a Beothuk woman captured in 1818.

==Legacy==
Hamilton is the namesake of Hamilton Inlet and, formerly, of the Hamilton River (now the Churchill River), both in Labrador.

<text>was a after &quot;Hōreki&quot; and before &quot;An&#x27;ei.&quot; This period spanned the years from June 1764 through November 1772. The reigning empress and emperor were and .

==Change of era==
* 1764 : The era name became &quot;Meiwa&quot; (meaning &quot;Bright Harmony&quot;) because of the enthronement of Empress Go-Sakuramachi.

As a cultural phenomenon, the literature of this period records concerted attempts to distill the aggregate characteristics of the inhabitants of Edo (&quot;Edokko&quot;) into a generalized thumbnail description. These traits (&quot;Edokko katagi&quot;) were put into use to draw a contrast between Edokko and those who did not have this &quot;sophisticated&quot; gloss—those not from the city, as in merchants from the Kyoto-Osaka region or samurai from distant provinces. Sometimes &quot;Edokko katagi&quot; was presented with pride; and it was used mockingly.

==Events==
* 1765 (&quot;Meiwa 2&quot;): Five-momme coin issued.
* 1766 (&quot;Meiwa 3&quot;): A planned insurrection to displace the Shōgun was thwarted.
* 1768 (&quot;Meiwa 5&quot;): Five-momme usage halted.
* 1770 (&quot;Meiwa 7&quot;): A typhoon flattened the newly built Imperial Palace in Kyoto.
* 1770 (&quot;Meiwa 7&quot;): A great comet (Lexell&#x27;s Comet) with a very long tail lit up the night skies throughout the summer and autumn.
* 1770 (&quot;Meiwa 7&quot;): Although no one could have known it at the time, this was the first of 15 consecutive years of drought in Japan.
* April 1, 1772 (&quot;Meiwa 9, 29th day of the 2nd month&quot;): &quot;The Great &quot;Meiwa&quot; Fire&quot;—one of the three greatest Edo fire disasters. Unofficial reports describe a swath of ashes and cinders nearly five miles wide and long—destroying 178 temples and shrines, 127 daimyō residences, 878 non-official residences, 8705 houses of bannermen, and 628 blocks of merchant dwellings, with estimates of over 6,000 casualties. All this devastation subsequently engendered the staggering costs of reconstruction.
* August 2, 1772 (&quot;Meiwa 9, 4th day of the 6th month&quot;): A terrible tempest hit the Kantō bringing floods and ruining crops.
* August 17, 1772 (&quot;Meiwa 9, 19th day of the 6th month&quot;): Another storm with more flooding and winds no less intense blew down an estimated 4000 houses in Edo alone.
* 1772 (&quot;Meiwa 9&quot;): At the time, it was said that &quot;&quot;Meiwa&quot; 9 is Year of Trouble&quot; because it was marked by an extraordinary succession of natural calamities. The pun was made linking the words &quot;Meiwa&quot; + &quot;ku&quot; (meaning &quot;&quot;Meiwa&quot; 9&quot;) and the sound-alike word &quot;meiwaku&quot; (meaning &quot;misfortune&quot; or &quot;annoyance&quot;).
* 1772 (&quot;Meiwa 9, 11th month&quot;): The &quot;nengō&quot; was changed to &quot;Anei&quot; (meaning &quot;eternal tranquillity&quot;), but this symbolic act was proved futile.

<doc id="1084845" wikidata="Q450423" url="?curid=1084845" title="Rita Marley">
<text>Alfarita Constantia &quot;Rita&quot; Marley OJ OD ( Anderson; born 25 July 1946) is a Jamaican reggae singer. She is the widow of reggae musician Bob Marley. Along with Marcia Griffiths and Judy Mowatt, Rita was a member of the reggae vocal group the I Threes, the backing vocalists for Bob Marley and the Wailers.

==Early life==
Rita Marley was born in Santiago de Cuba, to Leroy Anderson and Cynthia &quot;Beda&quot; Jarrett. Her parents moved to Kingston, Jamaica, when she was three months old. In her memoir, &quot;No Woman No Cry: My Life with Bob Marley&quot;, Rita describes how she was raised by her Aunt Viola after her parents separated. She was raised in Trenchtown in Kingston, Jamaica.

==Career==
Rita was a founding member of the Soulettes with her cousin Constantine Walker, and Marlene Gifford. The Soulettes released recordings including rocksteady tunes such as &quot;Time for Everything&quot;, &quot;Turn! Turn! Turn!&quot; (released in 1966, written by folk singer Pete Seeger) and &quot;A Deh Pon Dem&quot;. &quot;Friends and Lovers&quot;, &quot;One More Chance&quot; and &quot;That Ain&#x27;t Right&quot; (featuring harmony vocals by the Wailers), as well as a duet by Marley and Bunny Wailer (&quot;Bless You&quot;), which was issued years later on the &quot;Lovers and Friends&quot; album.

After recording for Studio One and being coached by Bob Marley, Rita married Bob around February 1966, just before he moved to Wilmington, Delaware, for a few months to make a living working at the Dupont Hotel there. Bob was replaced by her cousin Constantine &quot;Vision&quot; Walker, who recorded a few songs as a member of The Wailers during this period, with Rita Marley providing harmonies.

=== The Wailers ===
Upon Bob&#x27;s return at the end of the summer of 1966, Bunny Wailer, Peter Tosh and Bob created their independent label Wail &#x27;n&#x27; Soul&#x27;m, which released several records by Bob Marley and the Wailers, as well as Peter Tosh and the Wailers 45RPM single records including &quot;Bend Down Low&quot;, &quot;Hypocrites&quot; and Tosh&#x27;s &quot;Dem Haffi Get a Beatin&quot;&#x27; in 1966–1968.

As Bunny was jailed in 1968 for cannabis possession, Rita joined the Wailers, replacing Bunny for a few months. It is at that time that The Wailers met American singer Johnny Nash, who produced a series of Wailers rocksteady recordings. In April 1968 Nash&#x27;s manager Danny Sims signed Tosh, Rita Marley and her husband, Bob Marley to exclusive publishing, management, and production contracts in exchange for a few dollars and an opportunity to record in Kingston for the New York-based JAD label owned by Johnny Nash, musician Arthur Jenkins and Sims.

Musicians on this 1968 Wailers session feature Tosh and the Marleys. Rita Marley sang vocals on a dozen fine rocksteady and soul tracks, most of which were not issued at the time. New recordings of &quot;Bend Down Low&quot; and &quot;Mellow Mood&quot; got issued as a single in the U.S. under the name &quot;Bob, Rita and Peter&quot;. 

The original 1968 sessions including all of the original musicians — and without the horns — eventually surfaced on the &quot;Freedom Time&quot; album issued in 2003 by JAD&#x27;s partner in France (55 Records) after producer Bruno Blum finally mixed them in Paris from the original four-track tapes. One song, &quot;Play Play Play&quot;, features Rita Marley on lead vocals with harmonies sung by Peter and Bob Marley. Another Rita Marley-sung tune, &quot;Lonely Girl&quot;, and a pop duet with Bob, &quot;Milk Shake and Potato Chips&quot;, were finally released in 2003 on the &quot;Rebel&quot; JAD/55 long box set.

=== The I Threes ===

Following the birth of their second child, Ziggy Marley in 1968, Bob returned to Delaware in 1969 to work on the night shift in a Chrysler factory. Bunny had returned to the Wailers at the end of 1968 and Rita did not record with Bob until 1974, when her husband formed the I Three harmony vocal group featuring Marcia Griffiths and Judy Mowatt to replace Peter and Bunny, who had left the band in 1973.

Together with the I Three, Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers recorded the album &quot;Natty Dread&quot; in 1974, rising to international stardom with the track &quot;No Woman No Cry&quot;. It was followed by the 1976 album &quot;Rastaman Vibration&quot; featuring the track &quot;Roots, Rock, Reggae&quot;. On 3 December 1976 two days before the Smile Jamaica Concert, a large free concert organized by Bob Marley with the support of Jamaican Prime Minister Michael Manley, Rita, Bob, and manager Don Taylor were wounded in an assault on the Marley home by gunmen affiliated with Manley&#x27;s enemies. Rita survived a shot to the head and Taylor sustained serious injuries from being shot in the leg. Bob had a bullet skid his chest and wound his arm, but nevertheless played this major show in Kingston with Rita by his side.

== Later years ==
In 1981, Rita Marley purchased Ken Khouri&#x27;s Federal Records recording studio, the island&#x27;s first pressing plant, and the company subsequently moved from 56 Hope Road to 220 Marcus Garvey Drive, where it continues to operate.

Tuff Gong studio is one of the largest Caribbean studios and features the second-largest live recording space on the island with artists, musicians, producers and tourists traveling from around the world to visit the facility.

In 1986, Rita Marley decided to convert Bob Marley&#x27;s home into the Bob Marley Museum. She is the founder and chairwoman of the Robert Marley Foundation, Bob Marley Trust, and the Bob Marley Group of Companies.

In 2000, Rita created the Rita Marley Foundation, a non-governmental, not-for-profit, non-partisan organization that works to alleviate poverty and hunger in developing countries. It targets elderly and youth. It has given out a number of scholarships to music students in Ghana. It hosts the annual Africa Unite concerts which strives to spread global awareness about issues that affect Africa and to develop lasting solutions. She adopted 35 children in Ethiopia and has assisted over 200 children in Konkonuru Methodist School in Ghana.

In 1996, Rita Marley was conferred the Order of Distinction by the Jamaican government for her contributions to the development of Jamaican music and culture.

In 2010, Rita was conferred with the prestigious Marcus Garvey Lifetime Achievement Award.

On 3 August 2013, she was made an honorary citizen of Ghana by the Ghanaian government after living there for many years. In November 2015 Marley was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by the University of the West Indies.

==Change of era==
* 1751 : The new era of &quot;Hōreki&quot; (meaning &quot;Valuable Calendar&quot; or &quot;Valuable Almanac&quot;) was said to have been created to mark the death of the retired Emperor Sakuramachi and the death of the former &quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Yoshimune.

The previous era could be said to have ended and the new era is understood to have commenced in &quot;Kan&#x27;en&quot; 4, on the 27th day of the 10th month; however, this &quot;nengō&quot; was promulgated retroactively. The &quot;Keikō Kimon&quot; records that the calendar was amended by Imperial command, and the era was renamed Hōreki on December 2, 1754, which then would have become 19th day of the 10th month of the 4th year of Hōreki.

==Events of the &quot;Hōreki&quot; era==
* 1752 (&quot;Hōreki 2&quot;): An ambassador arrived from the Ryūkyū Kingdom.
* 1754 (&quot;Hōreki 4&quot;): The &quot;Hōreki&quot; River Improvement Incident
* 1758 (&quot;Hōreki 8&quot;): The Hōreki incident involved a small number of kuge who favored a restoration of Imperial power; and this was construed as a threat by the shogunate.
* 1760 (&quot;Hōreki 10&quot;): Shogun Ieshige resigns and his son, Ieharu, becomes the 10th shogun of the Tokugawa shogunate.
* 1762 (&quot;Hōreki 12&quot;): The Emperor Momozono abdicated in favor of his sister; and he died shortly thereafter.
* 1763 (&quot;Hōreki 13&quot;): A merchant association handling Korean ginseng is founded in the Kanda district of Edo.
* 1764 (&quot;Hōreki 14&quot;): Sweet potatoes are exported from Edo to Korea. The food crop in Korea is the result of a diplomatic mission.

<doc id="1084880" wikidata="Q7236102" url="?curid=1084880" title="Powell v. Alabama">
<text>Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45 (1932), was a landmark United States Supreme Court decision in which the Court reversed the convictions of nine young black men for allegedly raping two white women on a freight train near Scottsboro, Alabama. The majority of the Court reasoned that the right to retain and be represented by a lawyer was fundamental to a fair trial and that at least in some circumstances, the trial judge must inform a defendant of this right. In addition, if the defendant cannot afford a lawyer, the court must appoint one sufficiently far in advance of trial to permit the lawyer to prepare adequately for the trial.

&quot;Powell&quot; was the first time the Court had reversed a state criminal conviction for a violation of a criminal procedural provision of the United States Bill of Rights. In effect, it held that the Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Clause included at least part of the right to counsel referred to in the Sixth Amendment, making that much of the Bill of Rights binding on the states. Before &quot;Powell&quot;, the Court had reversed state criminal convictions only for racial discrimination in jury selection — a practice that violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Powell has been praised by legal scholars for upholding the American adversarial system in respect to criminal law since the system &quot;relies upon attorneys to hold the state to its burden&quot; which is harder to maintain if the defendants have ineffective assistance of counsel.

== Background of the case ==
In March 1931, nine black men—Charlie Weems, Ozie Powell, Clarence Norris, Olen Montgomery, Willie Roberson, Haywood Patterson, Andrew (Andy) Wright, Leroy (Roy) Wright and Eugene Williams, later known as the Scottsboro Boys—were accused of raping two young white women, Ruby Bates and Victoria Price.

The group of young black men were on a freight train with seven white men and two women. A fight broke out, and all of the white men were thrown from the train. The women accused the black men of rape, although one woman later retracted her claim. All the defendants, except for 13-year-old Roy Wright, were sentenced to death in a series of three one-day trials. The defendants, who were under military guard to protect them from any mob violence, were not told they could hire lawyers or even contact their families. They had no access to a lawyer until shortly before trial, leaving little or no time to plan the defense. They appealed their convictions on the grounds that the group was not provided adequate legal counsel. The Alabama Supreme Court ruled 7-2 that the trial was fair. Chief Justice John C. Anderson wrote a strongly worded dissenting opinion. The defendants appealed the Alabama Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court.

The Supreme Court reversed and remanded, holding that due process had been violated. Writing for himself and six other Justices, Justice Sutherland explained the Court&#x27;s ruling as follows:

In the light of the ... ignorance and illiteracy of the defendants, their youth, the circumstances of public hostility, the imprisonment and the close surveillance of the defendants by the military forces, the fact that their friends and families were all in other states and communication with them necessarily difficult, and above all that they stood in deadly peril of their lives—we think the failure of the trial court to give them reasonable time and opportunity to secure counsel was a clear denial of due process.
But passing that, and assuming their inability, even if opportunity had been given, to employ counsel, ... under the circumstances just stated, the necessity of counsel was so vital and imperative that the failure of the trial court to make an effective appointment of counsel was likewise a denial of due process within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.

The Court&#x27;s holding was quite limited. Justice Sutherland cautioned that

Whether this would be so in other criminal prosecutions, or under other circumstances, we need not determine. All that it is necessary now to decide, as we do decide, is that in a capital case, where the defendant is unable to employ counsel, and is incapable adequately of making his own defense because of ignorance, feeble-mindedness, illiteracy, or the like, it is the duty of the court, whether requested or not, to assign counsel for him as a necessary requisite of due process of law; and that duty is not discharged by an assignment at such a time or under such circumstances as to preclude the giving of effective aid in the preparation and trial of the case. ... In a case such as this, whatever may be the rule in other cases, the right to have counsel appointed, when necessary, is a logical corollary from the constitutional right to be heard by counsel.
==Subsequent jurisprudence==
Whether &quot;Powell v. Alabama&quot; applied to non-capital cases sparked heated debate. &quot;Betts v. Brady&quot; initially decided that, unless there were special circumstances such as illiteracy or a complicated trial, there was no need for a court-appointed attorney. That decision was ultimately overturned in &quot;Gideon v. Wainwright,&quot; which established the right of an indigent felony defendant to be provided a trial attorney. Later Supreme Court cases have considered how early in the criminal process this right attaches, whether it applies to misdemeanors, and whether it applies to appeals from convictions.

<text> is a 30-meter sized asteroid and near-Earth object that is possibly the first Apohele asteroid (Atira) – an asteroid that is always closer to the Sun than Earth – detected. It was first observed on 23 February 1998, by David J. Tholen at Mauna Kea Observatory, Hawaii, but is now considered a lost minor planet.

Although its orbital elements have not been well established, its aphelion (farthest distance from Sun) was determined to be less than the Earth&#x27;s distance to the Sun (0.980 ± 0.05 AU). Therefore, it has a claim to title &quot;first Apohele detected&quot;, if not &quot;first Apohele confirmed&quot;, which goes to 163693 Atira. This asteroid is estimated to measure 30 meters in diameter based on its absolute magnitude 25.0 and an assumed albedo of 0.20, typical for stony S-type asteroid and common among near-Earth objects.

<doc id="1084904" wikidata="Q953515" url="?curid=1084904" title="Down feather">
<text>The down of birds is a layer of fine feathers found under the tougher exterior feathers. Very young birds are clad only in down. Powder down is a specialized type of down found only in a few groups of birds. Down is a fine thermal insulator and padding, used in goods such as jackets, bedding (duvets and featherbeds), pillows and sleeping bags. The discovery of feathers trapped in ancient amber suggests that some species of non-avian dinosaur likely possessed down-like feathers.

==Description and etymology==
The word &quot;down&quot; comes from the Old Norse word &quot;dúnn&quot;, which had the same meaning as its modern equivalent. The down feather is considered to be the most &quot;straightforward&quot; of all feather types. It has a short or vestigial rachis (shaft), few barbs, and barbules that lack hooks. There are three types of down: natal down, body down and powder down. Natal down is the layer of down feathers that cover most birds at some point in their early development. Precocial nestlings are already covered with a layer of down when they hatch, while altricial nestlings develop their down layer within days or weeks of hatching. Megapode hatchlings are the sole exception; they are already covered with contour feathers when they hatch. Body down is a layer of small, fluffy feathers that lie underneath the outer contour feathers on a bird&#x27;s body.

===Powder down===

Powder down, or pulviplumes, is a special type of down that occurs in a few groups of apparently unrelated birds. In some species, the tips of the barbules on powder down feathers disintegrate, forming fine particles of keratin, which appear as a powder, or &quot;feather dust&quot;, among the feathers. These feathers grow continuously and are not moulted. In other species, powder grains come from cells that surround the barbules of growing feathers. These specialized feathers are typically scattered among ordinary down feathers, though in some species, they occur in clusters. All parrots have powder down, with some species (including the mealy amazons) producing copious amounts. It is also found in herons and tinamous. The dust produced from powder down feathers is a known allergen in humans.

==Function==

The loose structure of down feathers traps air, which helps to insulate the bird against heat loss and contributes to the buoyancy of waterbirds. Species that experience annual temperature fluctuations typically have more down feathers following their autumn moult. There is some evidence that down feathers may also help to decrease the incidence of nestling cannibalism among some colonially nesting species, as the stiffness of the feathers make the young more difficult to swallow. Pollutants can reduce the efficiency of these functions. When oiled, for example, down feathers mat and clump together, which breaks down the bird&#x27;s insulation and allows water to reach the skin.

Female wildfowl use down feathers plucked from their own breasts to line their scrape nests. This process performs the dual function of helping to insulate the eggs and exposing the female&#x27;s brood patch—an area of bare skin, rich in blood vessels, which transmits heat very efficiently. Of the various items birds use to line their nests, down feathers provide the most effective insulation, though only when dry; wet down is the least effective insulator. Down may also help camouflage the eggs when the female is away from the nest, particularly as the birds often draw the feathers over their eggs before leaving.

Because a bird can eliminate heavy metals in its feathers and because feathers can be collected non-invasively and stored indefinitely, down feathers can be used to check for evidence of metal contamination in the bird&#x27;s environment. Studies have shown a high level of correlation between the level of metal contamination in a bird&#x27;s diet and the level found in its feathers, with the proportion of the chemicals found in its feathers remaining relatively constant (and relatively high for some metals).

==Mutation==
Mutations in the genes that control the formation of down feathers have been recorded in a German White Leghorn chicken flock. Although the elements of a normal down feather are present, a hyperkeratosis of the feather&#x27;s horny sheath after 16–17 days of incubation results in the sheath not splitting as it should during the final stages of the feather&#x27;s growth. Because of that abnormal splitting, the bird&#x27;s down appears to be matted; chicks with this condition look bristly and singed and tend to be lighter in body weight than normal chicks are.

==Human use==
Down feathers are used by Indigenous North Americans for religious ceremonies and as powerful symbols. In the stories of some cultures, the down feathers of an eagle are important gifts given by the bird to the story&#x27;s hero. In the Ghost Dance, a religious movement that has become particularly widespread among the Indigenous peoples of the Great Plains and Canadian Prairies, each dancer holds a painted feather tipped with a down feather painted with another color; the feathers are generally those of a crow, which is sacred to the Ghost Dance, or an eagle, which is ubiquitously sacred. Zuni prayer sticks are also made using eagle down. While eagle feathers belong to the Sun Priest, who plants them to the sun, other priests could use them if rain was needed, as the down is said to suggest &quot;fleecy clouds that gather on the horizon before rain&quot;. The Hopi rub eagle down feathers over rattlesnakes collected for Snake Dances, in an effort to soothe and calm the reptiles.
Anglers who fly fish have long used the down feathers of waterfowl for the construction of fishing lures. Because they are white, down feathers can be easily dyed a variety of colours. They are used to make the bodies, tails and wing casings of the flies. Historically, much of the down used for the flies came from the wing and tail of the marabou stork; these feathers were also popular with the millinery and dressmaking trades. Though it is still called by the same name, today&#x27;s &quot;marabou&quot; (sometimes spelled &quot;marabout&quot;), comes from domestic turkeys, as marabou storks are protected.

For centuries, humans across the globe have used down feathers for insulation. Russian documents from the 1600s list &quot;bird down&quot; among the goods sold to Dutch merchants, and communities in northern Norway began protecting the nests of eider ducks as early as 1890. Eiders are still &quot;farmed&quot; by people in Iceland, Scandinavia and Siberia. The birds are provided with nest sites and protected from predators, and down is collected intermittently during the nesting season without harming the nests or female ducks. The first collection is made roughly halfway through the incubation period, when some of high quality down is removed per nest. When the eggs have hatched and the young have left the area, the remaining down and breast feathers are gathered, typically resulting in another of lower quality feathers per nest. In general, 50–60 nests will produce about one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of down feathers. No more than four tonnes of eiderdown is collected from wild nests each year. Approximately 70% of that harvest is from Iceland. According to the International Down and Feather Bureau, eiderdown contributes only a small, but lucrative, portion of the world&#x27;s total down production, estimated at 175,000 tonnes annually. An eiderdown duvet requires from 600 to 1,600 grams of eiderdown fill; a simple 800 gram duvet sells for about 640,000 Icelandic króna (US$5,116) as of 2021.
In Iceland and Scandinavia, colonies of more than 5,000 birds sometimes develop in &quot;farmed&quot; areas, while in some protected areas of the Novaya Zemlya archipelago, nest densities exceed . On the other hand, the more nomadic indigenous peoples of Arctic Canada did not see down production as a reasonable source of income and tended to overexploit eider nests with &quot;indifferent&quot; collection of down feathers from the nests.
Although the down feathers of various species of wildfowl, gulls and other seabirds have historically been used for insulation, most now come from domestic geese. Some 70 percent of the world&#x27;s supply comes from China, typically from birds killed for their meat. Most of the rest comes from Europe and Canada, from birds harvested for meat or pâté.

A portion of the world&#x27;s supply of down feathers are plucked from live birds, a practice condemned as cruel by animal welfare groups. The precise percentage of down harvested in this manner is uncertain; while some references report that it is only a small fraction of the total (less than 1% in 2011), a 2009 Swedish documentary reported that it might be as much as 50–80% of the total supply, a figure supported by IKEA and an industry representative, but disputed by organizations within the industry. The documentary also shows birds lying on the floor with large flesh wounds from the plucking, after which the wounds were stitched using a needle and thread without anesthetic. Although live-plucking is illegal in Canada, the United States and Europe, it is known to occur in two European countries (Poland and Hungary) and in China. Public sentiment against the practice has, in some countries, been strong. IKEA and clothing manufacturer Patagonia have altered product lines to eliminate the use (or possible use) of live-plucked down.

In the United States, Federal Trade Commission regulations require that any product labeled &quot;100% Down&quot; must contain only down feathers, while products labeled simply &quot;Down&quot; can contain a mixture of fiber and feathers. In addition, products labeled as &quot;Goose Down&quot; must contain at least 90% goose down, 10% goose feathers. Down insulation is rated by fill power, which is the number of cubic inches displaced by a given ounce of down (in3/oz). To measure fill power, an ounce of down is placed into a graduated cylinder, and a small weight is dropped in on top of it; the volume below the weight indicates the fill power. Eiderdown has the highest fill power, at 1200. However, even down with a fill power as low as 550 still provides reasonably good insulation. Higher fill-power downs will thus insulate better than lower fill-power downs of the same weight. Insulation in most outdoor equipment ranges from about . Down rated is warm enough and light enough for most conditions, and fill is used for very lightweight and/or very cold-weather gear.

Down is warm, lightweight and packable. If well cared for, it retains its loft up to three times longer than do most synthetics. However, when it is wet, the thermal properties of down are virtually eliminated. Down forms clumps if exposed to dampness or moisture, and will mildew if left damp. In addition, it will absorb and retain odors.

Down feathers tend to become more allergenic as they age, as they become contaminated with molds and dust mites. Pillows provide the most common source of exposure, though mattresses, comforters, outerwear and upholstery can also cause problems. A Finnish study has shown that true feather allergies are rare, with most issues caused by dust mites.

==Non-avian dinosaurs==
Feathers found in amber in western France, Canada and northeastern China suggest that some non-avian dinosaurs may have had primitive, down-like feathers.

<text>, literally &quot;love ride&quot; but can also be read &quot;ride together&quot; or &quot;car pool&quot;, is a popular television program that runs Monday evenings from 11 pm in Japan on Fuji TV. It debuted on October 11, 1999. The show originally ended on March 23, 2009 but returned under the name &quot;Ainori 2&quot; on December 25, 2010, running through April 30, 2011.

&quot;Ainori&quot; was revived by Fuji TV and Netflix beginning with &quot;Asian Journey&quot;, which was first broadcast on the streaming platform in November 2017 and on Fuji TV in January 2018. Both media outlets also aired the second season of &quot;Asian Journey&quot; as well as the first season of &quot;African Journey&quot;, which was available on Netflix in late 2019 and on Fuji TV in early 2020.

==Description ==

Ainori is a reality program where seven young men and women travel the world riding a pink bus. The program is reminiscent of a travelogue; as of December 2008, the show has followed the bus across 90 countries as participants explore both famous tourist attractions and more off-the-beaten-path places. The participants are led across each country by a native who serves as tour guide, bus driver, and friend. Upon reaching the border with another country, the bus stops and participants head out to their next destination country to meet their new tour guide and get into their new bus.

The show&#x27;s twist is that the participants are each young, single people whose goal is to find love with another participant and return to Japan as a couple. When a participant has decided they like someone else, they ask the driver for a ticket back to Japan. They then declare their love to the object of their affection, and ask that the two return to Japan together. After a night&#x27;s consideration, the person who received the love declaration can either answer with a kiss, after which both participants leave the bus for Japan. Otherwise, the jilted participant is left to return to Japan alone. Besides the love declaration, participants are forbidden from talking openly about their love interests with other participants, but inform the TV audience of their feelings through diaries and confessions to the camera (shot when no other participants are present).

After people leave the bus, new people are added to the program, to keep the total at 7 members. They are seen on the side of the road with a painted cardboard sign (appearing to be hitchhikers) and brought aboard after a self-introduction.

The First Lap Around the World ended in May, 2003, and the Second Lap ended in March, 2007. After that, the bus visits the countries which has never been visited on the show, without the route. The 400th episode was aired on May 5, 2008.

As of March, 2009, 44 couples have found love through the program, and there have been 8 marriages (though one couple has divorced). On March 1, 2005, the first &quot;Ainori Baby&quot; was born, and as of mid-2008 there have been 4 babies born in total.

== Countries visited ==

=== The First Lap ===
* *1 : Paolo is a native person who participants met in the youth hostel in Italy. He could speak Japanese because he had stayed in Japan for one year.
* *2 : Once Midori had been jilted by Kin-chan, and been back to Japan from Vietnam. After that, she received a letter from him, and visited Thailand to meet him again there.
* *3 : Once Hisashi had been jilted by Mariko, and been back to Japan. But Mariko gave up the trip to meet Hisashi again in Japan.
=== The Second Lap ===

* *1 : Michele, Pendo, and Andy are native persons. Michele was a special participant as the commemoration of the Second Lap. Pendo and Andy took part in the trip during a single episode.
* *2 : In the episode #315, Outlaw gave up the trip because of the mistake by the staff, and Goki also did. But in the episode #317, they reported that they had met again in Japan and had started to love each other. Although they are not counted as an official couple of the program.
* *3 : Once MIE had been jilted by Susan, and been back to Japan from Hungary. But in Switzerland Susan gave up the trip and returned to Japan to meet her again.

== Memorable incidents ==

Although relationships between staff and participants are forbidden, some incidents involving staff have occurred:

* In South Africa, a female participant fell in love with the tour guide, and when the bus stopped at the country&#x27;s border (and she realized she&#x27;d never get to see him again) she begged the producers to let her confess her love. She did and the two became a couple.
* In spring of 2006, a female participant got intimate with the audio technician (even though the two had never talked, and the audio technician had a girlfriend). This incident resulted in the female participant, a male participant who was in love with her, the audio technician, and a cameraman all returning to Japan.

Other memorable incidents include:

* In Costa Rica, three male participants were arrested by the police for exposing their buttocks to children. After five hours they were released by the staff&#x27;s persuasion.
* After leaving Costa Rica, the program avoided Nicaragua because of insecurity of the political condition, and visited Jamaica. But the Nicaraguan ambassador in Japan made a protest against the program. So the program visited Nicaragua after leaving Fiji. The participants were welcomed as the sightseeing goodwill ambassadors.
* A female participant developed a physical ailment for which the doctor prohibited her from riding on the bus, or any other prolonged sitting position. Because of this, the only solution seemed that she would have to be sent home, and be eliminated from the show. However, the group came to the decision that they would ditch the bus, and walk for the rest of the trip (while carrying around all of their baggage), just so the girl could remain with them.
* In January 2006, a female participant broke down in tears and explained that three days before leaving for her Ainori trip, a male friend who she had long been harboring feelings for had finally confessed his love for her. She explained that she missed him terribly, could not get him out of her mind, and would likely not find love with any of the participants on Ainori, and thus left the show.
* In the summer of 2006, during a break in shooting when participants were on vacation back home in Japan, a female participant discovered that the male participant that she was in love with had a girlfriend in Japan, and indeed had had a girlfriend when he left for his world trip (strictly against the rules of Ainori). After all the participants were back in Europe shooting the show, the man was confronted, finally confessed the truth to his bus-mates, and left the show to return to Japan.

== Fundraising ==

Since April 2004, the program started the fundraising campaign called &quot;Ainori Bokin&quot; (Ainori Fundraising). This is a donation for poor countries visited in the program. The money has been mainly used for children living in these countries, and the schools called &quot;Ainori Gakko&quot; (Ainori School) have been built.

== Trivia ==

* To help prevent relationships between the staff and the participants, only staff members who are married or are already involved are chosen to work on the show.
* Hit tunes such as ELT&#x27;s &quot;Fragile&quot;, Glay&#x27;s &quot;Way of Difference&quot;, and I WiSH&#x27;s &quot;ashita e no tobira&quot; are used as the main theme music
* The &quot;Love Wagon&quot;, as the bus is nicknamed, is typically a Toyota Hiace, painted pink with Ainori logos on it. However, when the bus breaks down, or local traffic regulations prevent the love wagon from being used, a locally purchased Japanese van painted in the same way will often be substituted.
* Although typically the couples are &quot;born&quot; on their world trip, in the summer of 2006, two separate couples (Goki/Outlaw and MIE/Susan) were formed after the participants returned to Japan and realized their feelings for each other there, and in February 2007, an &quot;Ainori news special&quot; told the story of another couple (Hide/Kayo) who got together after returning to Japan.

== International versions ==
=== Vietnam ===
The Vietnamese version is called &quot;Hành trình kết nối những trái tim&quot; (&quot;Journey to match hearts&quot;), or &quot;Love bus&quot;, was broadcast in December 2008, becoming a high rated show of Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi Television. It is originally aired every Tuesday at 10PM.

<doc id="1084926" wikidata="Q1128898" url="?curid=1084926" title="Lemonade and Brownies">
<text>Lemonade and Brownies is the debut studio album by the American rock band Sugar Ray, released on April 4, 1995, by Atlantic Records. It was far less successful than the band&#x27;s later releases on Atlantic. The debut album and the band&#x27;s next album &quot;Floored&quot; also featured less of a pop-influenced sound than their later work.

==Background==
When the band got signed to Atlantic Records they had only four to five songs, including &quot;Caboose&quot; and &quot;Big Black Woman&quot; (which were featured on &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;) and two other songs called &quot;Lick Me&quot; and &quot;Gold Digger&quot;. Prior to getting signed, they had primarily been a cover band, and were known as Shrinky Dinx. In 1993, Shrinky Dinx created their own video for &quot;Caboose&quot;, with their director friend Joseph McGinty &quot;McG&quot; Nichol, who went on to become a director for Hollywood films such as &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. At this point, McG served as their de-facto manager and he helped them sign with the new management company of Lee Heiman and Chip Quigley, who in turn helped negotiate the subsequent deal with Atlantic. Shrinky Dinx had signed a five-year exclusive artist management deal with Heiman and Quigley, and one of the clauses that they put in the contract was that they would get them a record contract within six months. Shortly after signing with Heiman and Quigley, the &quot;Caboose&quot; video found its way to Atlantic Records executive Doug Morris. Drummer Stan Frazier later recalled that &quot;Doug Morris [from Atlantic] saw the live energy in the video and said, &#x27;Sign that band, this is entertaining.&#x27;&quot; They agreed to a two million dollar deal with Atlantic, with the deal being signed at a local pizza shop in Newport Beach. California. One of the reasons Morris wanted to sign Shrinxy Dinx was since he saw star potential in singer Mark McGrath, who he referred to as &quot;the kid&quot; during a meeting with Heiman and Quigley. Morris was so impressed by the video that he signed the band without having even heard a demo tape of theirs. McGrath believes another reason they got signed was since major labels were more willing to take chances on bands at that time, following the success of Nirvana.

Once getting signed, they changed their name to Sugar Ray (after the boxer Sugar Ray Leonard), due to threats of legal action from the Milton Bradley Company, maker of the Shrinky Dinks toy. The band chose this name since they were fans of boxing and other sports. Heiman said that he had initially opposed the name Sugar Ray, since he was &quot;afraid that everyone would just know the name from the boxer and it wouldn&#x27;t work.&quot; Work on &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot; would begin in mid-1994, with McG serving as producer. DJ Lethal from rap group House of Pain served as a co-executive producer. Sugar Ray asked DJ Lethal to work on their album as they were a fan of the House of Pain song &quot;Jump Around&quot;. DJ Homicide appears on a few of the album&#x27;s tracks, and was credited as a guest musician, being excluded from a group shot of the band on the back of the album, which shows them riding a rollercoaster. He later became an official touring member of Sugar Ray. Prior to becoming involved with Sugar Ray, DJ Homicide had been working as a hip hop radio DJ in Los Angeles, and was briefly a member of rap group Tha Alkaholiks. In a July 1997 interview promoting their next album &quot;Floored&quot;, McGrath reflected that &quot;Homicide came in toward the end of the last album and he&#x27;s a clown like us. We grew up listening to Kiss and AC/DC and he&#x27;s from a totally different background, so it&#x27;s a great exchange.&quot; Guitarist Rodney Sheppard said in a June 1997 interview, &quot;DJ Homicide, he&#x27;s not really a killer. He&#x27;s a nice guy. I call him Craig. We live together and it&#x27;s unfit at the dinner table to go, &#x27;Hey Homicide, pass the rolls&#x27;.&quot;

The album title originated after recording was finished, and was inspired by an ad in a pornographic magazine, which featured a near-naked woman and the slogan &quot;try our lemonade and brownies&quot;. The band found the magazine after moving into a house in the Los Angeles suburb of Hancock Park, which they shared during the making of this album and &quot;Floored&quot;. There were numerous other pornographic magazines in the house, since the old tenant was a collector of them. The band liked &quot;lemonade and brownies&quot; as an album title since it differs from the more conventional term &quot;milk and brownies&quot;, which they thought reflected how their music didn&#x27;t conform to just a single genre. Some reviewers believed that the album&#x27;s title was a reference to urine and feces.

Actress Nicole Eggert is featured on the cover. On the photo, she is naked on a white fluffy rug, which resembles a cloud. She was then known for appearing on the television series &quot;Baywatch&quot;, and McGrath was dating her best friend. He said in October 1997 that the cover art helped the album gain more exposure, saying &quot;I can&#x27;t tell you how many program directors have told me they played our record because of that photo. They&#x27;d tell me that a typical CD that comes across their desk ends up in the trash, but our cover grabbed them and they put it on. And Nicole wouldn&#x27;t even take a cent for it.&quot;

On the album&#x27;s liner notes the band members are credited under pseudonyms rather than their real names. McGrath is credited as &quot;Liar&quot;, Sheppard is credited as &quot;Traitor&quot;, Frazier is credited as &quot;Cheat&quot; and bassist Murphy Karges is credited as &quot;Sellout&quot;.

==Music and influences==
Sugar Ray initially began as a hardcore punk band in 1986, but had gone through several style changes by the time they got signed to Atlantic Records, including at one point being a glam metal band. The &quot;Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &amp; Roll&quot; (2001) states that on their first two albums, Sugar Ray were influenced by &quot;a variety of sounds: Red Hot Chili Peppers-style punk-funk, reggae grooves, metal, hip hop, and a little bit of retro new wave.&quot; The songs on &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot; have been described as having elements of heavy metal, hardcore punk, funk, speed metal, blues rock, R&amp;B, hip hop, acid jazz, arena rock, country and disco. In 1999, Corey Moss of the &quot;Iowa State Daily&quot; compared their sound on this album to Faith No More. AllMusic labelled &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot; as being &quot;sub-Chili Peppers shuck-and-jive.&quot; 

In her 2000 Sugar Ray biography book, author Anna Louise Golden states that people at the time considered the band&#x27;s sound to be &quot;putting the funk into music that was perilously close to metal&quot;, adding that &quot;at that time, more than anything, people considered them to be heavily under the influence of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.&quot; She also said that &quot;the music was hard, but it was fun. There was none of that gloom, doom and angst that permeated so much of the alternative scene.&quot; Golden categorized the song &quot;Big Black Woman&quot; as being a cross between blues rock and speed metal. This song was originally titled &quot;Big Butt Woman&quot;, and McGrath told his bandmates that it was based on his humorous experience of getting hit on by a transvestite woman. The song &quot;Danzig Needs a Hug&quot; references the punk/metal singer Glenn Danzig, who is known for his dark image. It features falsetto vocals from McGrath and backing vocals from Janine Harris. Golden describes the song as being &quot;close to disco lite&quot;. &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot; also included other similarly light R&amp;B-influenced songs, such as &quot;Hold Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Scuzzboots&quot;, with McGrath comparing these lighter songs to Boyz II Men in 1997. &quot;Danzig Needs a Hug&quot;, &quot;Hold Your Eyes&quot; and &quot;Scuzzboots&quot; were not done in the style of short interludes, instead running the same length of time as the rock songs. Karges said in 2019 that he and his bandmates would call these lighter non-rock songs &quot;vibe tracks&quot;. He added that the reason why these songs are on the album was because they &quot;just thought it was funny&quot; to include them. The album ends with a hidden country-influenced acoustic track, titled &quot;One Brave Cowboy&quot;. The hidden country track follows &quot;Streaker&quot;, one of the heaviest songs of the band&#x27;s discography, which itself follows &quot;Scuzzboots&quot;, one of the light R&amp;B songs. Sugar Ray would later explore country music again on their 2001 self-titled album, with the track &quot;Just a Little&quot;, while in 2015 McGrath would also go on to join the bro-country supergroup Uncle Ezra Ray, which featured him, Uncle Kracker and Better than Ezra singer Kevin Griffin.

Regarding their influences on the album, McGrath reflected in 2009, &quot;we&#x27;re such fans of all kinds of music. I love Slayer, I love The Beach Boys and everything in between. When you have five guys who write in the band — like we all do — you&#x27;re going to get a lot of influences. Back then when we started we were like kids in a candy store. We were just throwing things against the wall.&quot; In a 2015 interview, McGrath said he considered their sound during this period to be a &quot;pre nu-metal type rap/rock thing.&quot; He added, &quot;yes, people look back on it as a &#x27;metal record&#x27;. But if you listen to that record, there are R&amp;B songs, soul, I&#x27;m singing falsetto on a song. If you hear the record you&#x27;re hearing a band in its cocoon stage, going &#x27;who are we?&#x27; [...] We were kind of a jokey metal/rock/punk/funk/thrash... we were the Chili Peppers with zero talent.&quot; McGrath has also said that the band were all fans of The Beastie Boys, who were known for jumping between genres on albums, with McGrath saying in 2009 that they were doing both &quot;hardcore stuff&quot; and &quot;mellow stuff&quot; on their albums.

The track &quot;Drive By&quot; is a skit which revolves around the band trying to order a taco from a drive-through. Despite having musical elements, Karges claimed in 2019 that he doesn&#x27;t consider it to be a proper song, reflecting &quot;we just thought it would be funny to do [...] we always just thought of like what we could do that&#x27;s really stupid and funny&quot;. It has similarities to the Ween song &quot;Pollo Asado&quot;, from their 1991 album &quot;The Pod&quot;, which is also a musical skit about ordering a taco from a restaurant. The band were considering going to a real Del Taco drive-through to record the skit, although they decided against this since it would be too logistically difficult to do so. They ended up recreating the skit themselves, and used Karges&#x27;s 1968 Dodge Charger to record the sounds of the vehicle in the track. To record the Dodge Charger, they had to stick a microphone to the muffler. The skit has a drumbeat playing throughout, which originated through Jason Roberts, a mixer on &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;. The band had tried to incorporate this drumbeat in other songs, but had difficulty doing so, which is why they included it on &quot;Drive By&quot;. The album opener &quot;Snug Harbor&quot; uses a jazz loop that DJ Lethal had found, and the band came up with the lyric &quot;hey, get up, have some fun tonight&quot;, which is repeated throughout the track. The name &quot;Snug Harbor&quot; is a reference to a bar that the band used to frequent at Newport Beach. The track was meant to resemble a game show intro, and was recorded at the backroom of Image Studios in Hollywood. The band liked this as an opener since it was &quot;full of energy&quot; and &quot;stupid&quot;.

&quot;Dance Party USA&quot; includes backing vocals from producer McG. His vocals weren&#x27;t originally intended to appear on the track, and they were of him trying to instruct McGrath on how to sing the song. The song includes the lyric &quot;I&#x27;m like the real world, I start in New York I&#x27;m in L.A. then Frisco&quot;, which is a reference to the MTV reality series &quot;The Real World&quot;. It is primarily built around a &quot;big, dumb riff&quot; which the band liked, and was regularly played live on the tour for &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;. However, it quickly fell out of their setlists once &quot;Floored&quot; was released. The idea for &quot;Iron Mic&quot; originated through McG during a rehearsal. He wanted them to use a bassline similar to &quot;Walk on the Wildside&quot; by Lou Reed, and the band started developing the rest of the song from there. Karges noted that the bassline to &quot;Walk on the Wildside&quot; is a very common chord progression that can be heard in numerous other songs, saying in 2019 &quot;if you&#x27;re writing it&#x27;s okay to take a very, very common chord progression, I mean how many chords and notes are there, there aren&#x27;t that many. It&#x27;s how your band or artist approaches playing it and plays it.&quot; McGrath wrote the lyrics to &quot;Iron Mic&quot;, and they revolved around boxer Mike Tyson.

The main guitar riff to the lead single &quot;Mean Machine&quot; was written by Karges, and it was directly inspired by the riff from &quot;Who Was in My Room Last Night?&quot;, by the Butthole Surfers. &quot;The Greatest&quot; was one of the band&#x27;s favorite songs to play live around this period, with Karges saying that it was the song that best showcased what each member brought to the band&#x27;s sound. He also said that the song translated better in live performances than in the studio version, since the parts for the studio version were pieced together.

The Australian and Japanese editions of the album both included songs which were not on the American version. The Japanese edition features four bonus tracks, including a live performance of a song called &quot;Dr J&quot;. The other tracks were covers of &quot;White Minority&quot; and &quot;Wasted&quot; by the hardcore punk bands Black Flag and Circle Jerks, and a cover of the 1980 song &quot;Wango Tagno&quot; by Ted Nugent. Karges had previously toured with Circle Jerks in 1990, when he was temporarily part of Los Angeles punk band The Weirdos. Karges came up with the music to &quot;Dr J&quot;, with McGrath adding comedic lyrics to the song. This live version of &quot;Dr J&quot; is the only one available on any of the band&#x27;s releases, since a studio recording was never made for it. Rob Hillis, a friend of the band, shouts &quot;come on horseys, run&quot; at the beginning of &quot;Wasted&quot;, and the band can be heard laughing as he says this. The band brought Hillis to the studio the day they recorded this cover, and were drinking budweiser beers. They asked Hillis to &quot;go say something&quot;, which is how this line originated. Hillis later suffered a double stroke in early 2000, and that year the band did a benefit concert to help him pay for his six-figure medical bills.

==Promotion and commercial performance==
The music video for &quot;Mean Machine&quot; was featured in a 1995 &quot;Beavis and Butt-Head&quot; episode titled &quot;Bang the Drum Slowly Dumbass&quot;. They also performed &quot;10 Seconds Down&quot; on a 1995 episode of MTV&#x27;s alternative program &quot;120 Minutes&quot;. In 1996, &quot;10 Seconds Down&quot; was included on the soundtrack for &quot;Escape from L.A.&quot;. That same year, &quot;Iron Mic&quot; was included on the soundtrack for the Ruby-Spears-produced &quot;Mega-Man&quot; cartoon. It is rumored that Mark McGrath did voice-over work for one of the show&#x27;s episodes. &quot;Hold Your Eyes&quot;, one of the lightest songs on the album, was featured in the erotic thriller film &quot;Wild Things&quot;. The film was released in 1998, the year after Sugar Ray&#x27;s commercial breakthrough with &quot;Floored&quot;. &quot;Hold Your Eyes&quot; plays in a scene where Suzie (Neve Campbell) is smoking while being visited by Duquette (Kevin Bacon).

Upon release, the album experienced some minor success in Europe, where similar bands like downset. and Rage Against the Machine were popular. It did not chart in the United States and was considered a commercial and critical failure for Atlantic Records. For &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;, the band did seven tours in Europe, but in the United States they did only a single tour to mostly empty clubs. Since the band were playing so many shows in Europe, they used to joke to each other that &quot;Europe loves the hard stuff&quot;. On February, 2, 1996, they performed &quot;Iron Mic&quot; on British talk program &quot;The Girlie Show&quot;, a program which mainly featured pop artists as musical guests, such as the Spice Girls. Before they performed &quot;Iron Mic&quot; on the program, McGrath showed host Sara Cox how he was able to set parts of his pubic hair on fire. Between 1995 and 1996, the band played roughly 200 shows in support of &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;. In 2016, former manager Lee Heiman said the band became tighter musicians during the tour for &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;, and were having a fun time playing at small clubs, adding that &quot;everything was going according to plan, yet the album sales were not happening.&quot;

When Sugar Ray had initially signed their two million dollar deal with Atlantic, Heiman and his partner Chip Quigley put a clause in the contract that Atlantic had to release a second record, no matter how poorly the first may have done. Heiman described this clause as a &quot;firm two-year commitment.&quot; However, the label were considering buying out their contract due to the underperformance of &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;. Sugar Ray ended up staying on Atlantic for &quot;Floored&quot;, as part of their sublabel Lava (which was established in 1995). They subsequently experienced huge success in the summer of 1997, after the release of their reggae/pop-influenced single &quot;Fly&quot;. In September 1997, three months after &quot;Floored&quot; was released, &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot; had only sold 48,000 copies according to SoundScan, which was then considered a very low number for a band on a major label. Their newfound success with &quot;Floored&quot; and later albums help slightly raise sales over time. McGrath said in 2015 that it had sold roughly 100,000 copies by that point. Heiman claimed in 2016 that it had sold 70,000 copies.

==Reception==

&quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot; received a generally mixed response from critics upon its release. AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that the album is &quot;a competent set of alternative funk/metal&quot;, but noted that &quot;nothing on &quot;Lemonade &amp; Brownies&quot; is particularly distinctive.&quot; In June 1995, Mike Boehm of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; labelled it &quot;juvenile&quot;, and cited it as having &quot;the dumb-fun appeal that&#x27;s the essence of frat rock.&quot; Boehm adds &quot;with the album’s cheesecake artwork and infantile, toilet-humor title, it’s clear Sugar Ray is factoring its appeal down to lowest denominators with this debut CD.&quot; Kirk Miller of &quot;The Michigan Daily&quot; wrote in September 1995 that &quot;Sugar Ray is the same feeling as having the munchies at 3 a.m. and running out to Denny&#x27;s.&quot; He adds that the album is &quot;a big ooey-gooey-chocolatey binge of phat punk-funk metal. Oh and the singer looks like Brad Pitt. Yum?&quot;.

In August 1995, &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; wrote that the album &quot;jumps hyperactively between rap, hardcore, arena rock and funk with a lot more skill and strength than you might expect (although, like so many white boys, they sound like they&#x27;re trying a bit too hard to be funk-ay)&quot;. The publication further stated that, &quot;The Beastie Boys (there&#x27;s even a &quot;Cookie Puss&quot;-style prank phone call), Bad Brains and Van Halen loom large here. Although its Beasties/Peppers personality sometimes overpowers the music, Sugar Ray manages to pull it off throughout most of this LP.&quot; In April 1995, David Beran of the &quot;Gavin Report&quot; similarly wrote, &quot;dangling their feet in the streams of hard rock and funk, Sugar Ray manage to do what the Beasties and Chilis have done.&quot; In his August 1995 review, Scott Iwasaki of the &quot;Deseret News&quot; described Sugar Ray as a &quot;hardcore hip-metal act resembling Beastie Boys and Red Hot Chili Peppers&quot;, and said that the album has &quot;a couple of innovative surprises&quot;. He described the opening track &quot;Snug Harbor&quot; as being &quot;a little acid jazz&quot; and said that &quot;&#x27;Hold Your Eyes&#x27; sounds so urban you&#x27;d think Dr. Dre played a hand in the mix.&quot; New Zealand publication &quot;Rip It Up&quot; wrote in their November 1995 review that the album has &quot;excursions into [various] musical genres, combined with a sense of humor and quirkiness.&quot; They add that, &quot;shuffled in their deck of harder songs are laidback funk songs &#x27;Danzig Needs a Hug&#x27; and &#x27;Hold Your Eyes&#x27;, which could easily pass as the product of a cheesy combo fitted with polyester lounge suits.&quot;

===Legacy===
David Jenison of &quot;In Music We Trust&quot; claimed in 1999 that with &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;, &quot;Sugar Ray only had three things going for them: 1) a good looking singer, 2) punk rock influences, and 3) being from Orange County, home to bands like No Doubt and the Offspring. But Sugar Ray also had a big problem — they didn&#x27;t have any real songs.&quot; In April 1999, shortly after the release of Sugar Ray&#x27;s third album &quot;14:59&quot;, the &quot;Daily Press&quot; reflected on &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;, saying that it &quot;included songs that more closely resembled the raunchy punk-funk of the Red Hot Chili Peppers than either of Sugar Ray’s [current] hits.&quot; &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004) gave the album two out of five stars, saying &quot;early on, Sugar Ray had a bunch of musical ideas — funk-metal, ska-pop, like that. Unfortunately, better bands had had the same ideas years before.&quot;

In 2016 former Sugar Ray manager Lee Heiman said that he considered it to be their best album, in spite of its commercial failure. In 2021, &quot;Louder Sound&quot; had a positive view of the album compared to their later pop-oriented material, writing that &quot;[&quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot;] and its 1997 follow-up &quot;Floored&quot; are actually worth investing a little bit of your time to&quot;, adding that &quot;we get why they &#x27;sold out&#x27;, but damn, we could have done with more of this before they went for the big pay day.&quot; In 2019, Rani Baker of Grunge.com included Sugar Ray on a list titled &quot;Bands That Don&#x27;t Sound Anything Like They Used To&quot;. She called &quot;Lemonade and Brownies&quot; a &quot;messy funk-punk effort&quot;, and noted that, &quot;to many folks, Sugar Ray was [just] another blonde-frosted late-&#x27;90s nothing of a band whose songs showed up in sitcoms and romcoms.&quot;

Due to its sensual nature, the cover has been included in several lists focusing on sexual album artwork. In 2012, Danielle Bacher of the &quot;LA Weekly&quot; placed it third on a list titled &quot;The Top Ten Sexiest Album Covers We&#x27;ve Ever Seen&quot;, while &quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; placed it 19th on their list of &quot;Rock&#x27;s 50 Sexiest (And Maybe NSFW) Album Covers&quot;. British tabloid the &quot;Daily Star&quot; also included it on their list of &quot;The 21 Naughtiest Album Covers&quot; in 2023.

<text>The Chattahoochee Musical Convention is a Sacred Harp singing convention. It is an annual gathering whose purposes are worship, through the singing of Sacred Harp music, and fostering of bonds of fellowship among singers. It bears the distinction of being the oldest surviving Sacred Harp musical convention, having been founded in 1852.

==History==

Plans were laid for the convention in the fall of 1851 at the home of composer Oliver Bradfield, north of Newnan, Georgia. It was organized in 1852 in western Georgia at Macedonia Baptist Church in Coweta County. The impetus for the Chattahoochee Musical Convention was the success of the original &quot;Sacred Harp&quot; hymnbook and the Southern Musical Convention that was then affiliated with it. With the northward geographic spread of Sacred Harp singing into the Coweta County region, it was felt that the time had come for the residents of this area to have their own convention. The early sessions were attended by Sacred Harp founder B. F. White and other leading Sacred Harp figures of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thurman/Miller 1952/2002, p. 32&quot;&gt;Thurman/Miller 1952/2002, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; 

In its early period the convention was four days long, ending on the first Sunday in August and beginning the preceding Thursday. Currently it is a two-day convention, ending on the same day.

The convention missed a few sessions during the American Civil War. As Thurman (1952/2002, 34) states, &quot;the progress of the Convention was greatly disrupted by the war. Many of the leading singers were called to arms and it was a serious blow to the body.&quot; At the end of the war in 1865 the Convention met again at Mount Zion in Carroll County, Georgia to begin anew; B. F. White and other Sacred Harp luminaries were in attendance. That year, the Chattahoochee Convention began keeping written records of its proceedings, records which have survived to the present time and serve as a historical resource for Sacred Harp scholarship. In 1866, the Convention adopted a written constitution. 

The members of the Convention have included some of the creators of the modern editions of &quot;The Sacred Harp&quot;. According to Thurman, Joseph Stephen James, who headed the committee that created the 1911 edition from which the modern &quot;Denson&quot; edition descends, &quot;had been a member of the Chattahoochee forty-four years when his revised edition was given to the public.&quot; The primary creators of the Denson edition (1936), Thomas Denson and Seaborn Denson, also attended the Convention on a number of occasions starting in 1878; and Thomas&#x27;s son Paine Denson, who completed the work of the 1936 edition, was a member. 

The Convention has met every year since resuming after the Civil War, with the sole exception of 1881.

==Venue==

In the 1930s, Matthew H. &amp; Ada Ward Wilson built a structure near Carrollton, Georgia, called Wilson Chapel, for the express purpose of housing the Chattahoochee Musical Convention. The Convention has met here for most of the years since 1938, and exclusively since 1989. The building continues to be maintained by the Wilson family.

==Etymology==

&quot;Chattahoochee&quot; is a local place name, notably of the Chattahoochee River, one of the principal streams of Georgia that flows through the region of the convention. It is said to come from an expression in Creek meaning &quot;painted rock.&quot;

<text>Nilon Bombers were a Britpop band from Cheltenham, formed in 1992. They split up in November 1996.

The line-up was Drew Norton (vocals, guitar), Gareth Ballard (guitar, vocals, bouzouki, keyboards and violin), Martin Williams (drums), and Kim Dorman (bass).

They released an album titled &quot;Bird&quot; on Almo Sounds in 1996 which was produced by Kim Fowley. It was described by Roy Wilkinson in &quot;Select&quot; as combining &quot;Mega City Four&#x27;s Transit-frequenting worthiness with the everyman rock of Ian McNabb...stultifyingly competent&quot;. Their most successful single, &quot;Superstar&quot;, reached no. 96 on the UK Singles Chart in May 1996. The band&#x27;s final single, &quot;I&#x27;m Not Built for This&quot;, was described by Tania Branigan in &quot;Melody Maker&quot; as &quot;Two years too late for New Wave of New Wave&quot;.

In July 1996 they were a last-minute addition at the T in the Park festival at Strathclyde Country Park where they were first on in the King Tuts Wah Wah tent.

After the band split up, Williams went on to form Silverman.

<doc id="1084945" wikidata="Q5478568" url="?curid=1084945" title="Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset">
<text>Frances Carr, Countess of Somerset (31 May 1590 – 23 August 1632), was an English noblewoman who was the central figure in a famous scandal and murder during the reign of King James I. She was found guilty but spared execution, and was eventually pardoned by the King and released from the Tower of London in early 1622.

== Family ==
She was born Frances Howard, the daughter of Lord Thomas Howard (later 1st Earl of Suffolk), and his wife, the former Catherine Knyvet. Frances&#x27; father was the second son of Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, a wealthy and powerful nobleman during the late 16th and early 17th centuries, and Margaret Audley, Duchess of Norfolk. Frances&#x27; maternal grandparents were Sir Henry Knyvet, of Charlton, Wiltshire, and Elizabeth Stumpe.

==Failed marriage==
Lady Frances Howard was married at the age of 14 to the 13-year-old Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, the grandson of Francis Walsingham. The marriage was primarily a political union and due to both their young ages, they did not live together.

Her husband was then sent on Grand Tour from 1607 to 1609, apparently without having consummated the marriage. When he returned she made every effort to avoid him. He was at the time seriously ill with smallpox. She was at court and on 5 June 1610 danced as the &quot;Nymph of Lee&quot; representing the Essex River Lea in the masque &quot;Tethys&#x27; Festival&quot;. 

She had also fallen in love with Robert Carr, 1st Earl of Somerset. When she finally took the step of annulment, unable to legally represent herself, her father and her uncle, Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, represented her and drew up the libel. The situation quickly attracted public attention, and was widely observed by those with &quot;prurient minds&quot;. She claimed that she had made every attempt to be sexually compliant for her husband, and that, through no fault of her own, she was still a virgin. She was examined by ten matrons and two midwives who found her hymen intact. It was widely rumoured at the time that Sir Thomas Monson&#x27;s daughter was a substitute, which is possible because she had requested to be veiled during the examination &quot;for modesty&#x27;s sake&quot;.

The matter was a subject of mockery and ribald commentary throughout the court, including:

This Dame was inspected but Fraud interjected 
A maid of more perfection 
Whom the midwives did handle whilest the knight held the candle 
O there was a clear inspection.

In turn, Essex claimed that he was capable with other women, but was unable to consummate his marriage. According to a friend, one morning (while chatting with a group of male companions) he had stood up and lifted his nightshirt to show them his erection—proving, if nothing else, he was physically capable of arousal. When asked why only she caused his failing, he claimed that &quot;she reviled him, and miscalled him, terming him a cow, and coward, and beast.&quot;

The idea of satanic involvement was seriously considered by the judges and at one point it was proposed that Essex should go to Poland to see if he could be &quot;unwitched&quot;. The annulment languished and possibly would not have been granted if it were not for the king&#x27;s intervention (Somerset was the favourite of King James). James VI and I granted the annulment on 25 September 1613.

== Wedding and masques ==
Frances married Somerset on 26 December 1613 at Whitehall Palace. Arrangements for the wedding preoccupied the master of ceremonies, Lewes Lewknor, who invited ambassadors. The value of the wedding presents was rumoured to be £30,000 or £10,000.

The celebrations included &quot;The Somerset Masque&quot; in the Banqueting House (the Spanish ambassador was prominent in the audience), and a performance of &quot;The Masque of Flowers&quot;, produced by Francis Bacon and acted by lawyers from Gray&#x27;s Inn. The performance depicted a scene in Virginia. The Lord Mayor&#x27;s masque, Thomas Middleton&#x27;s lost &quot;Masque of Cupids&quot;, was performed on 4 January 1614 at the Merchant Taylor&#x27;s Hall to celebrate the wedding.

== A murderous plot ==

Sir Thomas Overbury, a close friend and advisor of Somerset, had tried to advise Somerset not to marry Frances Howard, but the Howard family and their allies were powerful. The Howard faction persuaded the king to offer Overbury the post of Ambassador to Russia, knowing he would refuse in order to stay in England by Somerset&#x27;s side. When he did so, the king viewed this as an insult and imprisoned Overbury in the Tower of London, where he died. The annulment of Frances and Essex&#x27;s marriage went through eleven days after Overbury&#x27;s death, in September 1613.

18 months later, in the summer of 1615, a Yorkshire apothecary&#x27;s assistant confessed on his deathbed that he had been paid £20 by the Countess of Essex to supply her with poisons for murdering Overbury. James I&#x27;s Secretary of State, Sir Ralph Winwood, brought the accusations to the King&#x27;s attention in September, and James in turn urged his Privy Council to investigate the matter. The subsequent investigation and trial revealed that Frances had been surreptitiously poisoning Overbury for some time before his death, by smuggling jellies and tarts into his chamber tainted with white arsenic and other toxic compounds. 

The Lieutenant of the Tower, Gervase Helwys, admitted that he had received a confession from Overbury&#x27;s keeper, Richard Weston, that he had been bribed by the Countess of Essex to administer the poison. Helwys intercepted the tainted sweets at one point and from then on took the precaution of having Overbury&#x27;s food prepared in his private kitchen, taking care to intercept any other food before it could reach Overbury. 

However, for fear of the Countess of Essex&#x27;s political influence, and because his own patron was Frances&#x27; great uncle Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton, he took no action against her. Frances eventually succeeded in poisoning Overbury with a smuggled enema laced with mercury chloride.

Frances and her husband were arrested for the murder in mid-October 1615. The trial revealed that Frances had supplied the poisoned enema to Richard Weston through an intermediary, Frances&#x27; waiting-woman and companion Anne Turner. 

Helwys was tried as an accessory, and his patron at Court, Sir Thomas Monson, arrested and imprisoned for involvement. Between mid-October and December 1615, Helwys, Turner, Weston, and the apothecary James Franklin, were all found guilty as accessories to murder and hanged. Monson twice had his trial delayed, in November and December 1615, before prosecution was ultimately dropped.

Frances Somerset admitted her complicity in the crime; however, her husband maintained his innocence. In 1616 Frances was found guilty of murder, while her husband was found guilty of being an accessory after the deed when it was proven that he burned incriminating documents and made bribes to cover up his wife&#x27;s involvement. The couple were sentenced to death initially but later confined to the Tower for life on the orders of James I. They received a pardon from the King in January 1622 and were subsequently released from prison. She died 10 years later at the age of 42.

Lord and Lady Somerset had one daughter, Anne, born while Frances was under house arrest at Lord D&#x27;Aubigny&#x27;s house on the Strand,[4] before she was taken to prison in the Tower of London. According to the &quot;Diary&quot; of Lady Anne Clifford, Frances was taken to the Tower on 24 March 1616. She was looked after by Frances&#x27;s sister Lady Knollys. Anne married William Russell, 1st Duke of Bedford. Through her, Lady Somerset was the ten-times-great grandmother of the actress Celia Imrie.

Frances was buried at the family seat in Audley End, Essex.

<text>The [[Monterrey]] Fury were a Mexican team playing in a United States–based soccer league. The team was awarded a Major Indoor Soccer League expansion franchise for the 2003–2004 season. The most notable thing that happened to the team during its first season was that it was forced to forfeit several games after using an illegal player.

Shortly before the start of the 2004–2005 season, the MISL terminated the Fury franchise because of &quot;a long series of non-compliance and disregard for the obligations and responsibilities of an MISL member club.&quot; UANL Tigres, a Mexican 1st Division team, was awarded a new MISL franchise. However, because of a dispute over who owned the rights to an MISL franchise in Monterrey, the Tigres elected not to complete its purchase of the team, and the MISL voted to discontinue operations in Mexico on December 30, 2004.

<doc id="1084947" wikidata="Q8017423" url="?curid=1084947" title="William Redfern">
<text>William Redfern (1775 – 17 July 1833) was the Surgeon’s First Mate aboard HMS &quot;Standard&quot; during the May 1797 Nore mutiny, and at a court martial in August 1797 he was sentenced to death for his involvement. His sentence was later commuted and in 1801 he was transported to New South Wales and assigned as an assistant to the Norfolk Island hospital. In this post he demonstrated the medical skills that enabled him to become one of the colony’s most revered physicians and a pioneer in public health. Redfern advocated major reforms to sanitary conditions aboard convict ships and this significantly reduced the morbidity rates of convicts arriving in NSW. Later in life he became a highly successful farmer, bank director and an emancipist rights activist.

==Early life==
William Redfern was born in Canada, the third son of Robert and Margaret Redfern from Northern Ireland. The family returned to England and settled in Trowbridge in Wiltshire. In 1790 William Redfern became a surgeon&#x27;s apprentice to his older brother Thomas. On 19 January 1797, after seven years training as a surgeon and physician, the 22-year-old passed an examination set by the Company of Surgeons in London that enabled him to join the Royal Navy as a &quot;physician&quot; aboard all warships, or a &quot;surgeon&quot; on warships of third rate and above. On 23 January 1797 Redfern was assigned to the third-rate 64-gun HMS &quot;Standard&quot; as a Surgeon&#x27;s First Mate.

==The 1797 Mutiny at the Nore==
When Redfern joined the Royal Navy, Britain had been at war with the Spanish, French and Dutch for four years. It was also a period when naval seamen were protesting about low pay, bad food, poor health care and harsh discipline. Such issues had always existed in the navy, but the inability of sailors to support their families at a time of significant social unrest in Britain fuelled their dissent. Of particular concern to the crews on warships of the North Sea Fleet, to which HMS &quot;Standard&quot; was attached, were the virulent diseases plaguing the lower decks. Petitions to the Admiralty for better medical care were ignored and in May 1797 10,000 common seaman took control of the North Sea Fleet and sailed the ships from the Yarmouth to the Nore sandbank on the Thames. Many ship surgeons who were deemed inept were put ashore and surgeon’s mates had to assume their duties. First Mate William Redfern did this aboard HMS &quot;Standard&quot;. When the Admiralty refused to meet the seamen’s demands, they blockaded the Thames to all shipping in and out of London.

The Nore mutiny eventually petered out when the Government threatened military intervention and 560 of the leading mutineers were arrested. This included William Redfern who was accused by the captain of HMS &quot;Standard&quot; of supporting the mutiny. 412 of the accused seamen were court martialled and 59 sentenced to hanging. Some sentences were later commuted to prison, flogging and transportation.

William Redfern was the highest-ranking seaman charged with mutiny. At his court martial on 22 August 1797 he strongly refuted the accusations of Thomas Parr, captain of HMS &quot;Standard&quot;, claiming that he had acted as surgeon against his wishes, and had resigned his commission twice. Although no witness testified that Redfern had collaborated with the mutineers, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Ten days later the sentence was commuted to a year’s solitary confinement followed by transportation for life. Redfern spent three years in Coldbath Fields prison, England’s cruellest gaol. The prison was so notorious that in 1800 the government appointed Inspector General of Health, Sir Jeremiah Fitzpatrick, to investigate it. At an interview with Fitzpatrick, prisoner William Redfern requested transportation as soon as possible, and to be allowed to work on the convict ship as a surgeon.

== Transportation to New South Wales ==
In January 1801 Redfern was moved to the prison hulk &quot;Captivity&quot; docked in Portsmouth. Two months later he was assigned to assist the surgeon on the hulk &quot;La&quot; &quot;Fortunée&quot; moored in Langstone Harbour. In May Redfern boarded the convict ship &quot;Canada&quot; and was assigned to keep the medical diaries and assist the ship’s surgeons. On 21 June 1801 the &quot;Canada&quot;, with the &quot;Minorca&quot; and the &quot;Nile&quot;, set sail for New South Wales with 541 people on board. Mid voyage Redfern was urgently transferred to the &quot;Minorca&quot; to treat two very sick patients. He was on the &quot;Minorca&quot; when the convoy reached Port Jackson on 15 December 1801.

== Norfolk Island ==
Shortly after arriving in Sydney, Redfern was shipped to Norfolk Island. He arrived on 8 January 1802 and was made a convict assistant to the hospital surgeon James Mileham. However, Mileham left the island three months later and his replacement Thomas Roberts drowned in a boating accident in June. This was a critical loss and Lieutenant Governor Joseph Foveaux temporarily put Redfern in charge of the hospital until a free surgeon could be brought to the island. Given this opportunity Redfern excelled in the role and when another free surgeon could not be found by November Foveaux granted Redfern a &quot;conditional pardon,&quot; and in April 1803 recommended Governor King award him an &quot;absolute pardon&quot;. In 1804 assistant surgeon D’Arcy Wentworth arrived on Norfolk Island to take charge of the hospital and Redfern remained as his assistant. By this time Redfern was also active on the island as a farmer and trader in agricultural produce, and remained so until his return to Sydney in June 1808.

==Medical career ==
Following the overthrow of the NSW Governor William Bligh in January 1808, the rebel administration made Joseph Foveaux the NSW Lieutenant Governor. In August 1808 Foveaux appointed Redfern as a government surgeon at the Sydney general hospital on George Street. The appointment was conditional on proof of his medical qualifications. Redfern’s medical records had been lost in the mutiny, so he agreed to be examined by a colonial medical board composed of Principal Surgeon Thomas Jamison, NSW Corps Surgeon John Harris and Corps Assistant Surgeon William Bohan. Redfern passed the examination and was awarded the first medical diploma issued in Australia. Foveaux then wrote to the British Colonial Secretary Lord Castlereagh seeking confirmation of the appointment. King George III confirmed Redfern as a government surgeon in February 1812.

Among his other official duties, Government Surgeon Redfern treated the imprisoned Governor Bligh and his daughter Mary. Bligh was a captain of a warship that mutinied at the Nore but had insisted his crew be pardoned. It is likely the two men had much to reminisce about. In September 1809 Redfern vaccinated children across the colony against smallpox, after ensuring that the community was well informed of the advantages of the inoculation. Redfern treated mostly convicts and the disadvantaged at the general hospital, but he also ran a busy private medical practise. His reputation as a physician, surgeon and obstetrician made his low-cost private services for the highly sought after.

The appointment of Lachlan Macquarie as Governor of NSW in January 1810 was a major turning point in Redfern’s life. Macquarie considered hardworking well-behaved emancipists to be among the most useful members of the colony, and he prioritised rehabilitation over punishment, seeing personal repatriation into the society of freemen as an ultimate goal for convicts. To emphasise this commitment, Macquarie invited prominent emancipists to dine at Government House and these occasions often included William Redfern. Within months of his arrival Macquarie had approved the construction of a new general hospital on Macquarie Street and appointed Redfern as the health inspector of incoming convict ships. He later became the governor’s personal physician, travel companion and close confidant. In March 1811 William married Sarah Wills and they had two sons; William Lachlan Macquarie was born in 1819 and Robert Joseph Foveaux in 1823.

In 1812 Redfern accepted James Sheers as a surgeon apprentice at the hospital. This made Sheers Australia’s first medical student and Redfern its first medical teacher. Improving sanitary conditions aboard convict ships is considered one of Redfern’s greatest achievements. In 1814 the three convict ships, &quot;General Hewitt&quot;, &quot;Three Bees&quot; and &quot;Surry&quot;, arrived in Sydney with major outbreaks of scurvy, typhus and dysentery. It was greatly feared that the typhus rampant on the &quot;Surry&quot; would affect the colony and Australia’s first quarantine camp was created on the north shore of the harbour opposite Dawes Point (today in the vicinity of Jeffreys Street, Kirribilli). In this camp D’Arcy Wentworth and William Redfern treated infected seamen from the &quot;Surry&quot;. Later Redfern was appointed to lead an inquiry into the infections and high death rate on the three ships and he recommended major reforms to sanitation, diet, air circulation and medical assistance on convict transports. In 1815 the British Government adopted most of these reforms and they improved conditions aboard all subsequent transport ships, significantly reducing convict morbidity and mortality.

A new Sydney General Hospital was officially opened on Macquarie Street in April 1816. The central block of the three-winged building contained the hospital wards. The north wing was assigned as the residence of Principal Surgeon Wentworth and the south wing as the residence of the Assistant Surgeon Redfern and his wife Sarah. Today, these two outer buildings remain – the southern wing is now The Mint and the northern wing is the Parliament House of New South Wales.

== Bank director ==
Early in his tenure Governor Macquarie recommended the establishment of a bank in the colony, but the British government had rejected the proposition. However, in November 1816 Macquarie was strongly urged by commercial interests in Sydney to establish the Bank of New South Wales with 104 bank shares offered for purchase. On 7 February 1817, a meeting of interested residents elected seven founding directors of Australia&#x27;s first bank: William Redfern, D&#x27;Arcy Wentworth, John Harris, Robert Jenkins, Thomas Wylde, Alexander Riley and John Campbell. The bank opened its doors to the public on 8 April 1817. Redfern remained a director until 1820 and was again elected in 1827.

== Commission of inquiry ==
Macquarie’s egalitarian policies, and his efforts to convert the penal colony into a free and prosperous settlement, were strongly resisted in Britain by the Tory conservative government. A majority in the British Parliament asserted that the colony should remain a harsh penal settlement to be feared by potential criminals. They claimed that not only was improving the lives of convicts and emancipists eroding transportation as a deterrent to crime, the residents of the colony were now on the whole better fed, dressed and more securely employed than most of the poor in Britain.

On 5 January 1819 Lord Bathurst appointed John Thomas Bigge as the Commissioner of Inquiry to examine the functioning of the New South Wales colony. Bigge was advised to challenge Macquarie’s policy of rehabilitating convicts and favouring emancipists. Macquarie had recently recommended William Redfern to be the next Principal Surgeon when D’Arcy Wentworth retired, but Bathurst opposed emancipists in major government posts and had selected naval surgeon James Bowman instead. Both Bigge and Bowman arrived in the colony on the &quot;John Barry&quot; on 26 September 1819. Redfern was devastated by his rejection and promptly resigned as the senior hospital surgeon, closed his private practice and moved immediately with his family to their Campbellfield farm in Minto.

Macquarie was distressed that Bathurst had ignored his advice, and to compensate he appointed Redfern to be a magistrate in the District of Airds. Commissioner Bigge opposed ex-convicts becoming magistrates and requested the appointment be reversed. Macquarie stood firm and they clashed bitterly over all subsequent egalitarian issues. In conducting his inquiry into the colonial governance, Bigge mostly interviewed ‘exclusive free’ residents who opposed Macquarie’s social reforms. The Commissioner interrogated Redfern several times, seemingly to unearth irregularities in the doctor’s medical administration of the hospital and his close relationship with Macquarie. These fiery meetings led Redfern to accuse Bigge of behaving like ‘a Spanish Inquisitor’. Bigge would later claim that Redfern was the only person in the colony who resisted the Commission’s authority.

== Emancipist rights activist ==
In 1819 a London court judgment reversed the established legal rights of emancipists in the colony. It ruled that persons granted a government pardon &quot;in the colony&quot; had no legal rights unless such pardons were ratified under the Great Seal of Britain. This ruling implied that emancipists had no right to own or sell property. In 1820, the Sydney Judge Barron Field reaffirmed this ruling, thus invalidating all assets and transactions of pardoned convicts in the colony. The entire community was in an uproar because almost all assets were affected; most land in the colony was held by emancipists. A major assembly was held in Sydney in January 1821 and William Redfern and Edward Eagar were elected to petition the British Parliament on restoring the legal and civil rights of emancipists. The two men arrived in London in June 1822 and successfully lobbied the British Parliament. The civil rights to emancipists were restored in the Male Convicts Act 1823 (4 Geo. 4. c. 47) and the Transportation Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. 84).

Commissioner Bigge published his first report on his NSW inquiry shortly after Redfern and Eagar reached Britain. Redfern expected personal condemnation in the report but was incensed at the explicitness of the publication. Lachlan Macquarie, who had returned to London in July 1822, was also upset by the severity of the inquiry report, and so was William Wentworth, D’Arcy Wentworth’s eldest son, who was a barrister in London. William Redfern, Edward Eagar, William Wentworth and Joseph Foveaux met with Lachlan Macquarie to discuss a response to accusations made by Bigge. In December 1822 Redfern engaged Wentworth to sue Bigge for damage to his character and reputation. The case was abandoned when Bigge agreed to withdraw earlier accusations, and not slander Redfern in two future inquiry reports. Redfern returned to Sydney in July 1824.

== Farming ==
After 1820 William Redfern no longer routinely practiced medicine and concentrated on cultivating his 22,500 acres of land at Campbellfield and elsewhere. Even John Bigge admitted that Redfern’s properties were among the colony’s eight farms ‘in the best state of cultivation and exhibit the greatest improvement’. The Campbellfield estate of 6,000 acres grew cereal crops and grazed large herds of cattle and sheep. The estate had 60 horses, a horse stud and a racecourse with a grandstand. On his return trip from England in 1824, Redfern had brought vine cuttings and a Portuguese winemaker from Madeira to start a vineyard at Campbellfield. William Redfern is reputed to be first to cultivate the grape variety Verdelho commercially in Australia.

== Final years ==
In 1828 Redfern sailed to England with his eldest son William Jr. to oversee his education. From 1829 to 1831, while his son attended school in Edinburgh Redfern enrolled to study medicine at the University of Edinburgh. His wife Sarah and younger son Robert had been expected to follow them, but a serious accident had initially prevented Sarah from travelling and then the sudden death of 7-year-old Robert in 1830, further delayed the long journey. On 17 July 1833 William Redfern died after a short illness and is buried in Edinburgh. Sarah had already sailed to see her husband and son, and arrived in Edinburgh via London only days after his death.

==Legacy==
Redfern’s commitment to improving the health of transported convicts is now seen as pioneering preventive medicine in Australia. Redfern is recognised as the first public health physician in Australia and has been honoured since 1994 by the Royal Australasian College of Physicians with the annual &quot;William Redfern Oration&quot;. He is widely regarded as a ‘Father of Australian medicine’.

William Redfern is widely honoured across New South Wales. The 100 acres of the ‘Dr. Redfern’s Estate’ on Botany Road were sold in 1843 and today encompass one third of the Sydney suburb of &quot;Redfern&quot;. The Campbelltown suburb of &quot;Minto&quot; in outer Sydney occupies much of what was Redfern’s 6,000 acres of Campbellfield estate. Redfern has been named on street signs and parks in cities and towns across Australia.

In 1961 the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) televised The Outcasts, a historical drama in twelve episodes, in which William Redfern was the central figure. The main theme of &quot;The Outcasts&quot; was Redfern’s role in the building of a new general hospital on Macquarie Street, Sydney.

<text>was a after Genroku and before Shōtoku&quot;.&quot; This period spanned the years from March 1704 through April 1711. The reigning emperors were and .

==Etymology==
&quot;Hōei&quot; comes from the Old Book of Tang ().

==Change of era==
* 1704 : In reaction to the Great Genroku earthquake in Genroku 16, the era name was changed to &quot;Hōei&quot; (meaning &quot;Prosperous Eternity&quot;). The previous era ended and the new one commenced in Genroku 17, on the 13th day of the 3rd month.

==Events of the &quot;Hōei&quot; era==
* October 28, 1707 (&quot;Hōei 4, 4th day of the 10th month&quot;): Great Hōei earthquake. The city of Osaka suffers tremendously because of a very violent earthquake.
* December 16, 1707 (&quot;Hōei 4, 23rd day of the 11th month&quot;): An eruption of Mount Fuji; the cinders and ash fell like rain in Izu, Kai, Sagami, and Musashi.
* April 28, 1708 (&quot;Hōei 5, 8th day of the 3rd month&quot;): There was a great fire in Heian-kyō.
* May 20, 1708 (&quot;Hōei 5, 1st day of the 4th month&quot;): The shogunate introduces new copper coins into circulation; and each coin is marked with the &quot;Hōei&quot; nengō name (&quot;Hōei Tsubo&quot;).
* October 12, 1708 (&quot;Hōei 5, 29th day of the 8th month&quot;): Italian missionary Giovanni Sidotti landed in Yakushima, where he was promptly arrested.
* February 19, 1709 (&quot;Hōei 6, 10th day of the 1st month&quot;): The wife of shōgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi killed him with a knife, and then she stabbed herself in the heart. Tsunayoshi&#x27;s plan to adopt &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kai as his successor were known by a few inside Edo Castle. The shōgun&#x27;s wife, who was also a daughter of the emperor, foresaw that this choice of a successor would be very poorly received by many; and she feared that it might result in a disastrous civil war. The shōgun&#x27;s wife did everything she could to dissuade Tsunayoshi from continuing with such potentially divisive and dangerous plans; and when it became clear that her arguments were in vain, she resolutely sacrificed herself for the good of the country—she killed her husband and then killed herself. She may also have done this as she hated the boy.
* 1709 (&quot;Hōei 6, 4th month&quot;): Minamoto no Ienobu, Tsunayoshi&#x27;s nephew, becomes the 6th shōgun of the Edo bakufu.
* August 7, 1709 (&quot;Hōei 6, 2nd day of the 7th month&quot;): The Emperor abdicates.
* January 16, 1710 (&quot;Hōei 6, 17th day of the 12th month&quot;): Higashiyama dies.
* July 7, 1710 – March 22, 1711 (&quot;Hōei 7, 11th day of the 6th month – Shōtoku 1, 4th day of the 2nd month&quot;): Ryukyuan mission to Edo, the largest delegation—168 people—in the Edo Period.

<doc id="1084968" wikidata="Q5249589" url="?curid=1084968" title="Decontamination foam">
<text>Decontamination foam (known commonly as decon foam) is a spray-on cleaning solution used on surfaces that have been contaminated with biological or chemical agents (e.g., chemical warfare agents, anthrax spores or toxic industrial materials). Decon foam has been found to make numerous chemical and biological agents harmless. It is also intended for use in areas where large numbers of people have possibly been contaminated (e.g. at conventions, airports, concerts). 

== Composition ==
The composition of decontamination foams is essentially water and a surfactant, creating an aqueous film forming foam that various reactive chemicals are then added, diminishing the amount of contaminants adhering to a surface and forming less hazardous products. Common reactants are hydrogen peroxide and quaternary ammonium complexes. Decon foam often comes in multiple bottles, that, when mixed, combine to form the decontamination solution. The bottles should be kept separate until needed as the foam may begin to lose effectiveness after mixing. After these bottles are mixed together, the foam can be applied by spraying it on a contaminated area or by manual application.

Solvent-based decontaminants work well on permeable polymers and are made to avoid corrosion, but can possibly alter polymer or plastic surfaces permanently. On the other hand, aqueous-based decontaminants are better with polar surfaces like concrete, but have the potential to corrode surfaces. For decontamination foam to be successful, it is important to stabilize the foam as this will increase its efficiency. Modifying the surface of silica nanoparticles to a certain level has been found to increase stability of the foam.

== Effectiveness ==
Decontamination foams can have varying levels of effectiveness depending on the decon foam, the type of contaminating agent, and the surface that is being decontaminated. Many decontaminants show effectiveness against chemical agents on nonporous and non-permeable surfaces, such as glass and stainless steel, since the contaminant remains on the exterior of the surface and is easily accessible to the decontaminant. However, more porous and permeable surfaces can absorb the contaminant, making it more difficult to decontaminate, and decontaminating agents can leave residual chemical contaminants on these surfaces.

==Examples of use==

* Decontamination of mailrooms during the 2001 anthrax attacks. The surfaces in the mailrooms were coated with two to three inches of foam and left for an hour before being vacuumed up. The foam was able to kill much of the anthrax without destroying the office equipment or furniture
* As an area denial weapons medium for crowd control, e.g. to make the ground slippery, as well as to reduce visibility (as a fog)
* The LAX airport soap cannon can spray large quantities of decon foam on crowds of potentially exposed persons, e.g. to decon an entire planeload of people who might be victims of a nuclear, chemical, or biological agent release
* Decontamination of methamphetamine labs
* Mold remediation
* Disinfection of hospitals and schools 
* Pesticide removal
* Military applications 
* Preventative measure at presidential debates

==Benefits over other decontaminants==
The two main benefits of decontamination foam over liquid decontaminants (chlorine, decontamination solutions, etc.) are its effectiveness on non horizontal surfaces and its high air to liquid ratio. Other decontaminants are difficult to apply to walls and ceilings due to poor adhesion, but decon foam is much better at adhering to surfaces, which increases the amount of time for the decontamination reaction to take place. Additionally, the high air-to-liquid ratio allows the foam to be used without over-applying the decontaminant. This high ratio also allows a small amount of liquid to cover a relatively large area in the event of a major contamination.

<text>WHSG-TV (channel 63) is a religious television station licensed to Monroe, Georgia, United States, serving the Atlanta area as an owned-and-operated station of the Trinity Broadcasting Network (TBN). The station&#x27;s transmitter is located in Atlanta&#x27;s Cabbagetown section.

Because it airs no local content (except for local insertion of the required station identification), it is not carried as a local channel on DirecTV; the network&#x27;s national feed is already available, but TBN&#x27;s subchannel sister networks are not available.

It had one broadcast translator, W55BM, licensed to Marietta with transmitter atop Sweat Mountain, northwest of Atlanta. That station was later W49DE and WXID-LP, an affiliate of JCTV.

==History==
The construction permit for a new television station on channel 63 at Monroe was originally issued to a local permittee, Monroe Television, Inc., around 1987. In December 1989, TBN purchased the permit and completed the station&#x27;s construction; WHSG commenced operations on March 15, 1991, as a TBN owned-and-operated outlet.

During the late 1990s through the early 2010s, WHSG played an important role within TBN, as it originated a weekly edition of the network&#x27;s flagship program &quot;Praise the Lord&quot; and a portion of the ministry&#x27;s semi-annual &quot;Praise-a-Thon&quot; fundraisers. This ended in 2017 when TBN revamped its local and network programming operations following Matt Crouch&#x27;s ascension to leadership of the ministry, after the death of his mother and TBN co-founder Jan Crouch. The station&#x27;s studio on Agape Way in Decatur was officially closed by TBN in 2019 following the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)&#x27;s repeal of the Main Studio Rule, and later sold.

==Technical information==
===Subchannels===
===Analog-to-digital transition===
WHSG-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 63, on April 16, 2009. The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 44, using virtual channel 63, which was among the high band UHF channels (52-69) that were removed from broadcasting use as a result of the transition.

The station&#x27;s analog transmitter was located in northern Rockdale County, halfway between Monroe and Atlanta. The station&#x27;s digital facility is immediately south of Atlanta&#x27;s Inman Park neighborhood, along the north side of Interstate 20. This is the same tower used by WUPA (channel 69), built by that station when its original location (atop the Westin Peachtree Plaza hotel) could not hold a second large TV antenna for digital, although WUPA has since moved to the North Druid Hills site, sharing an antenna through a diplexer. It also has WIRE-CD (channel 40), an expired construction permit for W06CM-D (channel 6), and a license for WYGA-CD on channel 16 (as well as a permit for 18 and a later app for 16 again). No serious damage occurred to the tower when the 2008 Atlanta tornado passed by the site, even though the then-analog WYGA-CA 45 (operating from the site under STA at very low power until WGCL-TV (channel 46) went digital) was knocked off-air. WHSG had an application to increase from 700 kW to its maximum 1,000 kW effective radiated power with the same antenna height, which is now licensed at the new site.

<text>Richard Samuel Benjamin (born May 22, 1938) is an American actor and film director. He has starred in a number of well-known films, including &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; (1969), &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970), &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot; (1972), &quot;Westworld&quot;, &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; (both 1973) and &quot;Saturday the 14th&quot; (1981). In 1968, Benjamin was nominated for an Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Comedy Series for his performance on the CBS sitcom &quot;He &amp; She&quot; (starring opposite his wife Paula Prentiss), which aired from 1967-1968. In 1976, Benjamin received a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role - Motion Picture for his performance as aged vaudevillian Willy Clark&#x27;s (Walter Matthau) comedically long-suffering nephew, confidant and talent agent, Ben Clark, in Herbert Ross&#x27; &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975), based on Neil Simon&#x27;s 1972 hit stage play of the same name.
After directing for television, his first film as a director was the 1982 comedy &quot;My Favorite Year&quot;, starring Peter O&#x27;Toole, who was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor. His other films as a director include &quot;City Heat&quot; (1984), &quot;The Money Pit&quot; (1986), &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; (1988), &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990), &quot;Made in America&quot; (1993), &quot;Milk Money&quot; (1994), &quot;Mrs. Winterbourne&quot; (1996), and &quot;Marci X&quot; (2003).

==Early life==
Benjamin was born in New York City, the son of Samuel Roger Benjamin (1910–1997), a garment industry worker. Benjamin&#x27;s uncle was vaudeville comedian Joe Browning. His family was Jewish. He attended the High School of Performing Arts and graduated from Northwestern University, where he was involved in many plays and studied in the Northwestern theater school. While there, he met future wife Paula Prentiss.

==Career==
===Theatre===
Benjamin appeared on stage in &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; and guest-starred on shows such as &quot;The New Breed&quot; and &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;. Benjamin&#x27;s early break came when cast in the touring company of &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; in 1964. He later toured in &quot;The Odd Couple&quot; with Dan Dailey. In 1966, he directed &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; on stage in London. Simon was pleased with Benjamin&#x27;s work and cast him in his new play &quot;The Star-Spangled Girl&quot; (1966–67) directed by George Axelrod. Benjamin appeared alongside Anthony Perkins and Connie Stevens, and the show ran for 261 performances. The success of the show led to Benjamin appearing in a television series with his wife Paula, &quot;He &amp; She&quot; (1967–68). It ran for 26 episodes.

===Stardom===

Benjamin&#x27;s first lead role in a film came with an adaptation of the Philip Roth novella, &quot;Goodbye, Columbus&quot; (1969) with Ali MacGraw. It was a critical and commercial hit. He followed it with a key support role in the film of &quot;Catch-22&quot; (1970). He was top billed in &quot;Diary of a Mad Housewife&quot; (1970) from the team of Eleanor and Frank Perry, appearing alongside Carrie Snodgress and Frank Langella. He directed his wife off-Broadway in &quot;Arf/The Great Airplane Snatch&quot; (1969), which ran for five performances.

Benjamin played the lead in &quot;The Marriage of a Young Stockbroker&quot; (1971), directed by the producer and the original author of &quot;The Graduate&quot;, though it was not as successful. He acted in a comedy, &quot;The Steagle&quot; (1971), the directorial debut of designer Paul Sylbert, which was little seen. Another box-office flop was the film of Roth&#x27;s &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot; (1972), the sole directorial effort of Ernest Lehman.

In 1972 Benjamin returned to Broadway with &quot;The Little Black Book&quot;, which only ran for nine performances. He then acted in two more successful films, as part of an all-star cast in &quot;The Last of Sheila&quot; (1973), from a script by Anthony Perkins and Stephen Sondheim, and in &quot;Westworld&quot; (1973), directed by Michael Crichton and co-starring Yul Brynner. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; stated that by this stage, his image was of &quot;a whining, petulant bore by doing too good a job of acting in a series of sleazy roles.&quot; He decided to steer away from such roles by turning down a part in &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; (which Richard Chamberlain ended up playing).

===Supporting actor===
Benjamin supported Walter Matthau and George Burns in the film adaptation of Neil Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; (1975), for which he won a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Motion Picture. He starred with Prentiss in &quot;The Norman Conquests&quot; (1975–76) on Broadway, which went for 76 performances. The couple went to Australia to make &quot;No Room to Run&quot; (1978). In Hollywood, Benjamin supported Matthau and Glenda Jackson in &quot;House Calls&quot; (1978).

In 1978, he starred in the ambitious but short-lived television series &quot;Quark&quot;. The same year he appeared in a TV film &quot;Fame&quot;, written by Arthur Miller. Benjamin played a frustrated fiancé of a woman who falls for the vampire Count Dracula in the surprise box-office smash &quot;Love at First Bite&quot; (1979) starring George Hamilton and Susan Saint James.

Benjamin has hosted &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; twice, once by himself on April 7, 1979 and the other nearly a year later on April 5, 1980 with his wife Paula Prentiss. He was top billed in &quot;Scavenger Hunt&quot; (1979), an ensemble film.

Benjamin had directed in theatre and was keen to do it in film. In 1979, Benjamin directed for the first time, creating a pilot for a sitcom spin-off of the film &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; by Carl Reiner. &quot;The pilot turned out really well,&quot; said Benjamin. &quot;But I don&#x27;t think ABC ever quite &#x27;got&#x27; it. They never did put the show on the air... At least I could prove that I wasn&#x27;t nuts, that I really had actually directed something.&quot; He directed one episode of the 1980 TV series &quot;Semi-Tough&quot;.

Benjamin had supporting roles in &quot;The Last Married Couple in America&quot; (1980), &quot;How to Beat the High Co$t of Living&quot; (1980), &quot;Witches&#x27; Brew&quot; (1980), and &quot;First Family&quot; (1980). He and Prentiss played the leads in &quot;Saturday the 14th&quot; (1981). They also began hosting corporate videos.

===Feature film director===
Benjamin&#x27;s work on the &quot;Where&#x27;s Poppa?&quot; pilot saw him offered the job as director on &quot;My Favorite Year&quot; (1982) starring Peter O&#x27;Toole. The film was warmly received, earning O&#x27;Toole an Oscar nomination for Best Actor and launched Benjamin as a director.

Benjamin and Prentiss returned to acting with the TV movie &quot;Packin&#x27; It In&quot; (1983). He said, &quot;If I get a wonderful script to act in and a mediocre script to direct, I&#x27;ll act. And the same principle applies the other way around. It&#x27;s the material that counts.&quot; He focused on directing, though, for the next decade. Benjamin&#x27;s second feature as director was &quot;Racing with the Moon&quot; (1984) from a script by Steve Kloves starring Sean Penn and Nicolas Cage. He was then called in at short notice to replace Blake Edwards on &quot;City Heat&quot; (1984) with Clint Eastwood and Burt Reynolds, which was a critical and commercial disappointment.

Benjamin directed a comedy for Steven Spielberg&#x27;s company, &quot;The Money Pit&quot; (1986) with Tom Hanks and Shelley Long. He then directed a thriller &quot;Little Nikita&quot; (1988) with Sidney Poitier and River Phoenix, and a comedy with Dan Aykroyd, &quot;My Stepmother Is an Alien&quot; (1988). Benjamin did another comedy, &quot;Downtown&quot; (1990), with Anthony Edwards and Forest Whitaker. He had a moderate hit with &quot;Mermaids&quot; (1990) starring Cher and Winona Ryder.

&quot;Made in America&quot; (1993) with Whoopi Goldberg and Ted Danson was also successful. &quot;Milk Money&quot; (1994) with Melanie Griffith and Ed Harris was less so. He also directed &quot;Mrs. Winterbourne&quot; (1996).

In the 1990s, Benjamin returned to acting with appearances on shows including &quot;The Ray Bradbury Theater&quot;, &quot;Love &amp; War&quot;, &quot;Ink&quot;, &quot;Mad About You&quot;, and &quot;Titus&quot;, as well as the films &quot;Deconstructing Harry&quot; (1997), &quot;Keeping Up with the Steins&quot; (2006), and &quot;Henry Poole Is Here&quot; (2008).

===TV directing===
In 1998, Benjamin and Prentiss performed &quot;Power Plays&quot; on stage. Benjamin did some directing for TV – &quot;The Pentagon Wars&quot; (1998), &quot;Tourist Trap&quot; (1999), &quot;The Sports Pages&quot; (2001), and &quot;Laughter on the 23rd Floor&quot; (2001) from the play by Neil Simon. Benjamin returned to features with &quot;The Shrink Is In&quot; (2001) and &quot;Marci X&quot; (2003), in which he also had a small role.

He produced and directed a TV adaptation of Simon&#x27;s &quot;The Goodbye Girl&quot; (2004) with Jeff Daniels and Patricia Heaton. In 2006, Benjamin directed the award-winning cable television drama &quot;A Little Thing Called Murder&quot;, starring Australian Judy Davis. It was based on the true story of Sante and Kenny Kimes, mother and son grifters and killers. His later acting appearances on television include &quot;Ray Donovan&quot; and &quot;Childrens Hospital&quot;. He most recently played Dr. Green in the Netflix comedy film &quot;You People&quot; (2023) opposite Jonah Hill and Julia Louis-Dreyfus.

==Personal life==
Benjamin met Paula Prentiss at Northwestern University. She had transferred from Randolph-Macon Woman&#x27;s College and was a year ahead of Benjamin at the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;cometoverhollywood/paula-prentiss-richard-benjamin&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They married on October 26, 1961 and have two children, son Ross (b. 1974) and daughter Prentiss (b. 1978), both graduates of Beverly Hills High School.

<doc id="1084974" wikidata="Q5065177" url="?curid=1084974" title="Certified General Accountant">
<text>Certified General Accountant (CGA) is a professional designation granted to Canadian accountants. A person who meets the education, experience and examination requirements of the Certified General Accountants of Canada (CGA-Canada) is entitled to use the professional designation and add the letters &quot;CGA&quot; to their title. A CGA is jointly a member of CGA-Canada and a provincial or territorial CGA association, or a CGA association overseas.

CGAs work throughout the world in industry, commerce, finance, government, public practice and the not-for-profit sector. CGA-Canada is working with the Chartered Professional Accountants of Canada (CPA Canada) to integrate operations under the CPA banner in 2014. Those with a CGA designation will be automatically granted the Chartered Professional Accountant (CPA) designation and are required to use both concurrently until 2024, (noted as CPA, CGA) and then adjust to the CPA designation alone just for it.

==History==

The national association, first known as the Canadian Accountants&#x27; Association, was founded in 1908 by a trio of Canadian Pacific Railway accountants in Montreal, Quebec. Five years later, in 1913, the General Accountants&#x27; Association, as it was then known, was granted a charter from the government of Canada. By the mid-1940s, association chapters were established from coast-to-coast. Provincial, territorial and regional (offshore) chapters were later established under their own charters.

Auditing rights are regulated by provincial governments. In Prince Edward Island, only qualified CAs and CGAs can perform public accounting and auditing in accordance with the Public Accounting and Auditing Act. In all other provinces, except Quebec and Ontario (detailed below), only qualified CAs, CGAs, and CMAs (Certified Management Accountants) may audit public companies.

Historically, Quebec and Ontario only allowed CAs to audit public companies. In 2004, the Ontario government passed legislation that would enable CAs, CGAs and CMAs to practice public accounting under a reconstituted Public Accountants Council, and as of June 2010 Ontario CGAs were allowed to issue audit opinions.

In August 2005, a panel was constituted under the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT) to rule on a challenge filed by CGA New Brunswick and CGA-Canada. It found Quebec&#x27;s measures denying CGAs the right to practice public accounting in Quebec to impair trade and recommended legislative changes. The Quebec government committed to address the problem. By November 2009, the &#x27;Regulation respecting the public accountancy permit of the Ordre des comptables généraux accrédités du Québec&#x27; enabled qualified CGAs to offer the full range of public accounting services to for-profit and publicly listed companies.

On November 6, 2009, Ontario issued a Notice of Measure claiming that material differences exist in respect of the practice of public accounting in Canada and to protect consumers out of province public accountants would be assessed against Ontario&#x27;s requirements. Manitoba supported by Alberta, British Columbia and Saskatchewan objected on the grounds that the Ontario regime causes injury to CGAs and impairs internal trade. A Panel convened under the Agreement on Internal Trade reviewed submissions and held a public hearing in Toronto on November 29, 2011. The Panel found that Ontario&#x27;s notice of measure has impaired or would impair internal trade and has caused or would cause injury. The Panel recommended that Ontario comply with its AIT obligations by April 15, 2012. The outcome is important for CGAs because it removes the last barrier to mobility allowing CGAs to practice public accounting anywhere in Canada.

In October 2013, a Special General Meeting of members was held to ratify an Integration Agreement between CGA-Canada and CPA Canada, which was previously approved by the CGA-Canada Board of Directors. The Integration Agreement has now been approved for adoption, it is now CGA-Canada&#x27;s intent to sign the Agreement with CPA Canada and continue to work towards unification of the entire profession in Canada.

==Education==

CGA-Canada&#x27;s professional education program is competency-based. Competency-based education requires candidates to perform tasks and roles to standards expected in the workplace.

The knowledge, skills and professional values required of a CGA are reflected in a list of competencies. These competencies extend over three areas: professionalism, leadership and professional knowledge. They are validated periodically through extensive survey analysis. The CGA Competency Framework details the 130 competencies required of a newly certified CGA.

The complete academic program consists of 19 courses, two business cases, and professional qualification exams, spread over several levels: Levels 1 to 3 (Foundation Studies), Level 4 (Advanced Studies), and final level, the PACE qualification or certification level.

A CGA must have an undergraduate degree. Students normally require 36 months of supervised work experience, but in all cases, they require a minimum of 24 months. They may meet the experience requirements in any business sector and in a variety of fields.

Before issuing audit opinions a CGA must first be licensed as a public accountant. The requirements for licensing include at least 500 public accounting hours per year.

<doc id="1084976" wikidata="Q5331313" url="?curid=1084976" title="Eaton's Ninth Floor Restaurant">
<text>The Eaton&#x27;s Ninth Floor Restaurant (known as &quot;The Ninth Floor&quot; or &quot;Le 9e&quot;) is an Art deco landmark in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. It was operated by the Eaton&#x27;s department store for 68 years, up until its bankruptcy and closure in 1999. After being closed to the public for a quarter of a century, it was renovated and reopened as a special events venue with the Ile de France Restaurant in 2024. The space is a registered historical site.

==History==
Lady Eaton, the wife of the multi-millionaire owner of the Eaton&#x27;s department stores, gave her interpretation of &quot;class and style&quot; to the major Eaton&#x27;s stores. In 1925 Eaton&#x27;s purchased the three storey Goodwin building located at 677 Saint Catherine Street West and commissioned architects Ross &amp; MacDonald to build it up to six storeys in 1927. The top three floors were added in 1930–31. On January 26, 1931, Lady Eaton opened a large art deco restaurant on the 9th floor of the building. The restaurant was designed by architect Jacques Carlu and the floor to ceiling mural at the back of the restaurant was created by his wife Natacha Carlu. It was patterned on dining hall of the transatlantic liner &quot;Ile de France&quot;. The 9th floor corridor between the elevators and restaurant is also in the art deco style.

The waitresses and loyal customers of the restaurant were the subject of a 1998 National Film Board of Canada documentary, &quot;Les Dames du 9e&quot; (&quot;The Ladies of the 9th&quot;).

===Closure===
Shortly following Eaton&#x27;s bankruptcy, the restaurant closed on October 14, 1999. A bagpiper played &quot;Amazing Grace&quot; to mark its end. After remaining vacant, the 9th floor restaurant was given heritage status by the Québec government. Plans for bringing the restaurant up to modern safety standards were drawn up by Fournier, Gersovitz, Moss et associés but never implemented.

===Abandonment period===
For nearly a quarter of a century, the former restaurant had sat behind locked doors and was slowly deteriorating. The dining room, lobby and bathroom area remained, but the kitchen had been demolished for office space. The current owners, Ivanhoé Cambridge, the real estate subsidiary of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, had refused in the past to allow media or preservation groups to inspect the site. Urban explorers who trespassed the site in 2004, took photographs documenting its then poor condition. On February 12, 2014, Heritage Montreal announced the restaurant was &quot;under observation&quot; due to the building&#x27;s uncertain future. Adding to the uncertainty at the time, the former occupants of the site, Les Ailes de la Mode, went bankrupt and closed in 2014 (while later transformed into an extension of the Montreal Eaton Centre, there had been no plans for the ninth floor). Ivanhoé Cambridge last opened the floor to CTV News in 2015, though the future of the floor space remained uncertain. Throughout this time, the space was considered an endangered Art deco landmark. In September 2019 preservation advocate Gérald McNichols Tétreault launched a petition to measure public interest in reviving the space. The building&#x27;s owner reported that an estimated CA$15 million would be required to bring the space up to standards suitable for public use.
===2024 reopening===
In March 2023, Ivanhoe Cambridge, the owner of the Eaton Centre, announced the reopening of the iconic ninth Floor by the end of the year. The heritage conservation firm, EVOQ Architecture, carried out the work to ensure the preservation of its heritage, while bringing it up to current day standards. It was announced the re-imagined space would offer a restaurant, as well as a venue for shows and private events that can accommodate up to 500 people.

In August 2023, it was announced the multi-purpose space (containing six different areas, including a small restaurant) would be officially known as &quot;Le 9e&quot;, however the reopening was delayed until the spring of 2024.

On April 11, 2024, a soft reopening was held in the space by invitation only, with an expected opening date for the public by mid-May.

On May 17, 2024, the space officially opened to the public, featuring the upscale Ile de France Restaurant. The original Eaton&#x27;s restaurant space was repurposed as a general purpose venue hall, with tables and chairs for the new smaller restaurant situated in the outside windowed corridors.

It won the Deutscher Spiele Preis 4th place award in 1999. A shareware computer version was published by Klear Games in 2003, and an iOS version was published by Conlan Rios Games in 2010.

== Game play ==

The game board is split into the four major Japanese islands of Hokkaidō, Honshū, Shikoku, and Kyūshū, and on every island are a number of cities and villages. Each player has 20 tokens that represent various levels of influence against a certain force—rice fields, Buddhas, and high helmets. Each of the forces are represented on the board with an acrylic glass figurine.

At the beginning of the game, players place the figurines one-by-one onto a city or village, with the capital city of Edo containing one of each figurine. Cities may contain two figures, but only if they are different. Villages may contain only one figurine. After all of the figurines are placed each player takes five tokens from their supply.

Players then take turns in placing their force tokens on the spaces surrounding a city or village. A player must play at least one token on their turn. These tokens may be played only once per turn:
* Figure-specific tokens – Printed with a specific force figurine and a number and only influence that particular force.
* Samurai tokens – A samurai can influence any of the three forces.
* Swap tokens – Swap this token with an existing token on the board, then move the old token to a new location.
Any number of the following tokens may be played on each turn. These tokens also have a small character printed on the bottom of the token.
* Ship tokens – Printed with an influence number and a ship icon, but may only be used in water.
* Exchange tokens – Discard this token and swap the positions of any two different figurines.
* Ronin token – A ronin can influence any of the three forces.
At the end of a turn the player takes random tokens from their supply to replenish their hand back to five.

Once a figurine is completely surrounded by tokens the player with the highest total of surrounding influence immediately takes the figurine. The figure is placed to the side in the event of a tie.
The game is over when all figurines of one type have been claimed by players or any four figurines have been set aside due to a tie. The winner is determined as follows:

* The player with the most of at least any two particular figurines is considered the winner. Note that if 2 or more players were to tie with the most of a particular figurine, none of those players would receive the majority for that figurine.
* If no player has a majority in at least two figurine types, any player that has the most of one figurine is still eligible to win, while those that do not have a majority of any type are eliminated. Of the remaining players, the winner is the player with the highest number of figurines excluding the type in which the player has a majority, or their &#x27;other&#x27; figurines. If there is a tie between the other figurines, then the winner is the player with the most total figurines. If there is still a tie after that, then those players who are tied with the highest total figurines share the victory.
(E.g. p1 has 5 helmets, 3 buddhas, and 1 rice field. P2 has 2 helmets, 3 buddhas, and 2 rice fields. p1 has the majority in helmets (his 5 vs p2&#x27;s 2). Both players are tied in buddhas (3 vs 3) while p2 has the majority in rice (his 2 vs p1&#x27;s 1). P1&#x27;s other figures would be 4 (3 buddhas + 1 rice field) while p2&#x27;s other figures would be 5 (2 helmets + 3 buddhas). P2 wins even though p1 has more total figures.
* If none of the players from above had a majority of any particular figurine (again, ties do NOT constitute a majority) the winner is decided by total number of figurines.

<text>Independiente Football Club Mutual Social y Biblioteca is a small football club in Bigand, Santa Fe Province, Argentina.

The club was founded in 1919 by Italian immigrant Guglielmo Broglia as a dissident part of the already existing Sporting Club . It then quickly entered in the competitions of the local league called &quot;Liga Deportiva del Sur&quot;, and won the championships of 1932, 1933, 1940, 1941, 1944, 1950, 1955, 1957, 1958, 1959, 1960, 1962, 1963, 1964, 1977 and 1999. In sports terms, the most important achievement was the Provincial first place, in 1968, defeating Newell&#x27;s Old Boys in the finals. The coach at that time was Angel Tulio Zof, later Argentine champion with Rosario Central.

During the 1950s the club obtained victories against important clubs like Rosario Central, Central Córdoba, Unión de Santa Fe and Newell&#x27;s Old Boys. Nowadays, a lot of young players take their first steps into the sports with Independiente de Bigand, to later move ahead to important clubs of Rosario, such as Fabián Fabiani.

Other sports practiced in the club are basketball (with player Miguel Basso), artistic ice-skating (Anibal Frare obtained the world second place) and swimming, with an Olympic pool copied from Independiente de Avellaneda.

During the 1978 FIFA World Cup that took place in Argentina, the club installations served as hotel and training camp for the Italy national football team.

<text>David Jonathan &quot;J. D.&quot; Drew (born November 20, 1975) is an American former Major League Baseball right fielder. He began his major league career in with the St. Louis Cardinals, and also played for the Atlanta Braves, Los Angeles Dodgers, and Boston Red Sox. He is the brother of two other major league players, Stephen and Tim.

==College==
Drew graduated from Lowndes County High School in Valdosta, Georgia in 1994. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 20th round of the 1994 draft but did not sign. He then attended Florida State University, where he played under head coach Mike Martin. At Florida State, he was the winner of the Dick Howser Trophy and the 1997 Golden Spikes Award, was named the 1997 Collegiate Baseball Player of the Year, the 1997 Sporting News Player of the Year, and was a consensus All-American (1997). He also was named the 1997 ACC Player of the Year. He was a 1996 member of Team USA. Drew was First Team in , was Freshman All-American in and was named to the College World Series All Tournament Team in 1995. He was the first player in college baseball history to hit 30 home runs and steal 30 bases in the same season. He set a Florida State record by batting .455 in 1997 while becoming one of only three players in college baseball history to have 100 hits, 100 runs and 100 RBIs. During his college career, Drew broke 17 school and conference records.

==Professional career==

===1997: Drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies===
The Philadelphia Phillies made Drew the second overall pick, after pitcher Matt Anderson, in the 1997 MLB draft. Drew and his agent Scott Boras chose not to sign with the Phillies, insisting Drew would not sign for less than $10 million. The Phillies had no plan to pay an unproven player this amount of money, and despite Boras&#x27; warnings, drafted Drew nonetheless. They offered him $2.6 million. Consequently, Drew ended up playing for the St. Paul Saints of the independent Northern League. Boras had Drew sign with an independent baseball league because of a loophole in the rules of the MLB draft.

===1998–2003: St. Louis Cardinals===
After playing for St. Paul in the 1997 season, Drew was selected in the first round of the 1998 MLB draft, fifth overall, by the St. Louis Cardinals. In June he signed a $7 million contract, then hit .316 through 26 games with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds. He was recalled by the Cardinals and made his debut on September 8, 1998—the game in which teammate Mark McGwire broke the single-season home run record previously held by Roger Maris. Drew&#x27;s first at bat, in the sixth inning, resulted in a strikeout, and he finished the night 0-for-2. He ended up going 15-for-36 (.417) during 1998, with five home runs.

On August 9, on what would have been Drew&#x27;s first game in Philadelphia, he sat out, citing a bruised right hand. In an attempt to confuse the Philadelphia fans, he did not wear his own jersey that night, which instead was worn by bullpen catcher, Jeff Murphy. The attempt failed, however, and he was booed and heckled throughout batting practice. The only time he received cheers was when he booted three consecutive grounders in the outfield while his teammates were taking batting practice. On August 10, 1999, in Drew&#x27;s first game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia, he was booed loudly, and even had batteries thrown at him by two fans. The Phillie Phanatic got into the act, dropping two large trash bags marked with dollar signs in the outfield between innings. Drew struggled to stay healthy, landing on the disabled list every season he played in St. Louis.

In his book &quot;Three Nights in August&quot;, Buzz Bissinger mentions former manager Tony La Russa&#x27;s frustration with Drew&#x27;s lack of passion. La Russa tells Bissinger that it seems Drew had decided to &quot;settle for 75%&quot; of his talent, in large part because of his enormous contract.

===2004: Atlanta Braves===
On December 13, 2003, Drew was traded to the Atlanta Braves along with catcher Eli Marrero for starting pitcher Jason Marquis, relief pitcher Ray King, and rookie prospect Adam Wainwright. There, he had the best season of his career while finally managing to stay healthy. In , he displayed excellent power, patience, and defense, hitting .305 with 31 home runs, 118 walks, and 93 RBI, finishing sixth in the MVP voting.

===2005–2006: Los Angeles Dodgers===
In December 2004, Drew signed a five-year, $55 million contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, which included an escape clause after the second year. Roughly halfway through the 2005 season, Drew&#x27;s season was again cut short after being hit on the wrist by a pitch from Arizona Diamondbacks&#x27; pitcher Brad Halsey.

On September 18, 2006, Drew was part of only the (then) fourth-ever set of back-to-back-to-back-to-back home runs with fellow Dodgers Jeff Kent, Russell Martin, and Marlon Anderson.

In 2006, Drew exercised his contract opt-out clause, forgoing $33 million over the next three years to become a free agent. Dodgers general manager Ned Colletti said in a teleconference that he was &quot;surprised how it came down. Everything we had heard, everything that had been written led us to believe the player loved being here.&quot; This was especially a surprise because a few days before, Drew had told an &quot;LA Times&quot; columnist on how happy he was in LA and that he was looking forward to the upcoming 2007 season. Drew had a very good season, batting .284 with 20 home runs and 100 RBI.

===2007–2011: Boston Red Sox===
On January 26, , Drew officially signed a five-year contract with the Red Sox worth $70 million. Drew&#x27;s revised contract had a clause that allowed the Red Sox to opt out of Drew&#x27;s five-year contract after three or four years if Drew has extensive injuries due to a previously existing problem in his right shoulder.

Drew was again part of a set of four consecutive home runs on April 22, 2007, in a game against the New York Yankees, this time joining with Manny Ramírez, Mike Lowell, and Jason Varitek. He is the only player to participate twice in a string of four straight home runs, and he was the second player to go deep in each instance. Drew finished the 2007 season with a .270 batting average, 11 home runs, and 64 RBI.
On October 20, 2007, Drew hit a grand slam in Game 6 of the 2007 ALCS with the Red Sox facing elimination. The home run, along with brother Stephen Drew&#x27;s for the Arizona Diamondbacks, marks the third time that two brothers have both hit home runs in the same postseason.

In 2008, Drew hit one of the longest home runs in Fenway Park history. According to the ESPN Home Run Tracker, it was measured at 460 feet. He finished with a .280 average, with an OBP of .408 and a slugging percentage of .519. At the end of June, Drew was named the AL Player of the Month after hitting .337 and hitting 12 home runs while taking over for David Ortiz&#x27;s three-spot in the lineup while he was on the disabled list. Drew was officially announced as an AL All-Star reserve on July 6. This was Drew&#x27;s first All-Star game appearance. He hit a two-run homer in his first at-bat as an All-Star en route to winning the game&#x27;s MVP award. In what was to become the longest All-Star Game time-wise in MLB history, the American League (and Drew&#x27;s Red Sox) manager Terry Francona, having almost run out of pitchers, contemplated putting Drew, a former high school hurler, on the mound to close the game. &quot;I&#x27;d have been ready,&quot; Drew said. &quot;I&#x27;ve had an opportunity to throw a lot in the outfield. I don&#x27;t know if I would have gotten anyone out, but I&#x27;d have thrown something up there.&quot; Drew later visited the 15-day disabled list, spending from August 27 to September 8 on the DL with a strained lower back.

On October 3, in Game 2 of the 2008 American League Division Series against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Drew hit a go-ahead two-run home run. On October 16, in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series against the Tampa Bay Rays, Drew helped to bring the Red Sox back from a late-inning seven-run deficit with a two-run home run in the eighth inning and then delivered the walk-off hit in the ninth. The Game 5 comeback, sparked by Drew, is the second-biggest in postseason history and is the largest for a team on the brink of elimination. However, the Red Sox lost to the Rays in the seventh game.

After the 2009 season, Drew&#x27;s statistics began to decline. That year, he hit .279 with an .392 OBP while hitting 24 home runs and 68 RBI. The following year, he hit .255 with 22 home runs with 68 RBI. However, he played in 139 games, his highest total since 2007 when he joined Boston. In 2011, Drew hit .222 with four home runs and 22 RBI. He played in 81 games and had a .315 OBP. Drew retired from professional baseball at the end of the 2011 season.

==Personal life==
Drew&#x27;s younger brother Tim was also drafted in the first round in 1997, making them the first brothers drafted in the first round of the MLB draft in the same year. They were teammates while on the Atlanta Braves in 2004. J.D., Tim, and their brother Stephen all played in Major League Baseball. J.D. and Stephen each won a World Series with the Boston Red Sox; J.D. in 2007 and Stephen in 2013.

Drew married his girlfriend Sheigh, on November 10, 2001, in Hahira, Georgia. Drew is a Christian.

==Career statistics==

In 55 postseason games, Drew hit .261 (48-for-184) with 19 runs, six doubles, seven home runs, 25 RBI and 18 walks.

<text>Marsiling is a suburb of Woodlands, Singapore, extends from the north of Woodlands Square to the Woodlands Checkpoint, bordering Malaysia. It presents the older living patterns of Singapore; it is a quieter and much denser estate, often offering a reasonable and larger alternative to other housing options, and houses a large number of elderly and heavy-duty industries.

==History==

In the late 1990s, a plan was introduced by the Government of Singapore to upgrade existing Housing and Development Board apartment blocks by providing refurbished elevators serving every storey of each block, an additional room at the rear of each flat, and other modernising features. This led to a surge in housing prices. The community of foreigners living in Marsiling has also been increasing.

== Politics ==
By 2015, Marsiling was merged with Yew Tee in an ongoing review of electoral boundaries that also saw Marsiling-Yew Tee Town Council being formed.

In 2017, Halimah Yacob resigned from the Marsiling-Yew Tee GRC (Marsiling division) to contest for the Presidency. Halimah Yacob was sworn in as the 8th President of Singapore from 13 September 2017. Since the 2020 Singaporean general election, former Chua Chu Kang GRC MP and Minister of State Zaqy Mohamad represented Marsiling, having earlier temporarily filling the vacated seat from 2017 to 2020.

<text>Delbert Martin Mann Jr. (January 30, 1920 – November 11, 2007) was an American television and film director. He won the Academy Award for Best Director for the film &quot;Marty&quot; (1955), adapted from a 1953 teleplay which he had also directed. From 1967 to 1971, he was president of the Directors Guild of America. In 2002, he received the DGA&#x27;s honorary life member award. Mann was credited to have &quot;helped bring TV techniques to the film world.&quot;

== Early life and education ==
Delbert Martin Mann Jr. was born on January 30, 1920, in Lawrence, Kansas, to Delbert Mann Sr. and Ora (Patton) Mann (died 1961). His father taught sociology at the University of Kansas from 1920 to 1926. In 1926, the Manns left Lawrence and moved to Pennsylvania and then Chicago before finally settling in Nashville in 1931. There, his father continued to teach sociology at the Scarritt College for Christian Workers. His mother was also a schoolteacher.

Mann was head of his high school drama club when he met Fred Coe, the future television producer and director, who was leading a church-sponsored acting society. Coe would later figure prominently in Mann&#x27;s career as a director. Coe would also serve as Mann&#x27;s mentor. Mann studied political science in Vanderbilt University. He graduated there in 1941 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree on political science. During World War II, Mann served with the Army Air Corps as a B-24 bomber pilot and then as an intelligence officer with the 8th Air Force stationed in England. Mann also attended the Yale School of Drama, where he earned a master&#x27;s fine arts degree in directing.

==Career==
===Television===
Mann took a directing job at the Town Theatre, a community playhouse in Columbia, South Carolina. Mann was affiliated with the Town Theatre from 1947 to 1949, before moving to New York to work with Coe in television. In 1949, at Coe&#x27;s invitation, Mann joined him in New York, where he became a stage manager and assistant director at NBC. Within months, he became an alternating director of the anthology series, &quot;The Philco Television Playhouse&quot;.

Between 1949 and 1955, Mann directed more than 100 live television dramas. But even after turning to films, he returned to television and directed productions for &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Ford Star Jubilee&quot; and other dramatic television anthology series. He also directed more than two dozen films for television from the late 1960s to the early 1990s, including &quot;Heidi&quot; (1968), &quot;David Copperfield&quot; (1969), &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1970) and &quot;All Quiet on the Western Front&quot; (1979).

===Film===
In addition to &quot;Marty&quot; (1955), other films directed by Mann include &quot;The Bachelor Party&quot; (1957), &quot;Desire Under the Elms&quot; (1958), &quot;Separate Tables&quot; (1958), &quot;Middle of the Night&quot; (1959), &quot;The Dark at the Top of the Stairs&quot; (1960), &quot;The Outsider&quot; (1961), &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot; (1962), &quot;A Gathering of Eagles&quot; (1963), &quot;Dear Heart&quot; (1964), &quot;Fitzwilly&quot; (1967), &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1971) and &quot;Night Crossing&quot; (1982).

==Personal life and death==
Mann was married to Ann Caroline Gillespie from 1942 until her death by Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in 2001. They had four children: Fred, David, Steven and Susan. Susan died in a car accident in 1976.

During the 1980s and 1990s, Mann served on the advisory board of the National Student Film Institute. He also served as honorary chairman of the institute for a one-year term.

On November 11, 2007, Mann died of pneumonia at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, at age 87.

<text>The Justin Winsor Prize was awarded by the American Historical Association to encourage new authors to pursue the study of history in the Western Hemisphere at a time when the study of European history predominated. The award was established in 1896 and named for Justin Winsor (1831–1897), one of the founders and presidents of the American Historical Association and the long-time Librarian of Harvard University. The award was discontinued in 1938. The American Historical Association&#x27;s Justin Winsor Prize is not to be confused with the present-day Justin Winsor Prize awarded annually by the Library History Round Table of the American Library Association for the best library history essay.

<text>Charles Wesley Thomas (born December 26, 1978) is an American former left fielder in Major League Baseball. Thomas played with the Atlanta Braves (), and Oakland Athletics (). He batted and threw left-handed.

==Amateur career==
Thomas played baseball and graduated from Asheville High School in Asheville, North Carolina. He would play collegiately at Western Carolina University. In 1999, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He was selected by the Braves in the 19th round of the 2000 MLB Draft.

==Professional career==
He steadily improved while splitting time between two teams in , hitting .324 in 47 games after being called up to Double-A Greenville. That season, he got a chance to play at Triple-A Richmond when Atlanta called up or released the outfielders ahead of him. Thomas took advantage of the opportunity. He went 31-for-79 (.379) in June, led the International League in hitting and on-base percentage, and was selected to the All-Star team.

Thomas started 2004 as the fourth outfielder for Richmond and made the big club in the mid-season. He posted a .288 batting average with seven home runs and 31 RBI in 83 games. He showed a great batting eye, speedy running, and outstanding defense.

At the 2004 Winter Meetings, the Braves traded Thomas and pitchers Juan Cruz and Dan Meyer to the Oakland Athletics for Tim Hudson.

In the 2005 season, he had a rough start and despite starting nearly every game went weeks without getting a hit. Eventually, Thomas was demoted to AAA, where he spent most of his remaining time in Oakland. On May 4, 2007, he was dealt to the Brewers in exchange for JD Closser. He played the rest of the 2007 season with Milwaukee&#x27;s Triple-A club, the Nashville Sounds.

<text>Harbord Collegiate Institute (HCI or Harbord) is a public secondary school located in downtown Toronto, Ontario, Canada. The school is located in the Palmerston-Little Italy-Annex neighbourhood, situated on the north side of Harbord Street, between Euclid Avenue and Manning Avenue. From the 1920s to the 1950s, about 90 percent of the student body was Jewish, while today the student body largely consists of students of East Asian and Portuguese descent.

== History ==

Harbord was opened in 1892 as the Harbord Street Collegiate Institute. Harbord&#x27;s first centennial was celebrated in 1992 and included the inauguration of the Harbord museum, a repository of Harbord memorabilia. To mark the event, Harbord&#x27;s alumni group, the Harbord Club, published a 300-page history of the school entitled &quot;The Happy Ghosts of Harbord&quot;, which traces the history of the school from its opening in 1892 to 1992. The original school building was Jacobethan Revival and replaced with the Collegiate Gothic wing in 1932.

On November 11, 2005, a Remembrance Day ceremony took place at Harbord. With the donations from the W. Garfield Weston Foundation and many other corporate sponsors and individuals, the rededication of the 1921 World War I monument back to its original splendour was held. In May 2007, a second monument created to remember World War II was revealed in another ceremony.

<doc id="1085026" wikidata="Q365882" url="?curid=1085026" title="Jon Gruden">
<text>Jon David Gruden (born August 17, 1963) is an American football coach and media personality currently employed by Barstool Sports. He held his first head coaching position with the Raiders franchise during their Oakland tenure from 1998 to 2001, where he won two consecutive division titles and made an AFC Championship Game appearance. Gruden was traded to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002, which he led to their first Super Bowl title in Super Bowl XXXVII the same season. At age 39, he was the then-youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl. He served as Tampa Bay&#x27;s head coach through 2008, setting the franchise record for wins, but made only two further playoff runs. After his firing from the Buccaneers, Gruden was featured as an analyst for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcasts from the 2009 to the 2017 seasons.

In 2018, Gruden returned to the Raiders as their head coach. He led the team until his resignation during the 2021 season after it was publicly revealed that he wrote and sent many racist, misogynistic, and homophobic emails between 2011 and 2018. In 2023, he was brought in by the Saints for a work-out for their offensive coaching.

==Early life==
Gruden was born on August 17, 1963, in Sandusky, Ohio, into a family of Slovene descent. His father, Jim, later served as a professional football regional scout, quarterbacks coach, and director of player personnel for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Gruden&#x27;s younger brother, Jay, played and coached in the Arena Football League for the Tampa Bay Storm and Orlando Predators, and was most recently the head coach of the Washington Redskins. His other brother, James, is a radiologist at UNC School of Medicine.

Gruden was raised Catholic and was a Cleveland Browns fan growing up. At the age of 15, he attended Clay High School in South Bend, Indiana, home to the University of Notre Dame, where his father served as an assistant to head coach Dan Devine. After graduating in 1982, Gruden attended Muskingum College in New Concord, Ohio. A year later, he transferred to the University of Dayton. At Dayton, Gruden was a three-year letterman and backup quarterback for the Flyers under coach Mike Kelly. Gruden never saw much playing time, but the Flyers posted a 24–7 record during his three seasons at the University of Dayton. He graduated with a degree in communications in 1986.

==Coaching career==

===College coaching===
After graduating from the University of Dayton, Gruden was hired as a graduate assistant coach at the University of Tennessee during the 1985–86 season. After his time with the Volunteers, Gruden spent two years as the quarterbacks coach at Southeast Missouri State. He then moved to the University of the Pacific in 1989 as offensive assistant as the tight ends coach. Walt Harris was the offensive coordinator at Tennessee, where Gruden was one of his graduate assistant coaches, and later hired him at Pacific. In 1990, Gruden was a special assistant with the San Francisco 49ers under quarterbacks coach Mike Holmgren. In March 1991, Gruden became the wide receivers coach for the University of Pittsburgh under head coach Paul Hackett.

===Professional coaching===
In January 1992, at the age of 28, Gruden was hired by Mike Holmgren, his former boss at the San Francisco 49ers, to be the special offensive assistant/wide receivers coach with the Green Bay Packers. After three seasons in Green Bay, Gruden became the offensive coordinator of the Philadelphia Eagles under former Packers assistant coach Ray Rhodes. Gruden was chosen by the owner and general manager of the Oakland Raiders, Al Davis, to be the Raiders&#x27; new head coach for the 1998 season.

====Oakland Raiders (first stint)====
Under Gruden, the Raiders posted consecutive 8–8 seasons in 1998 and 1999, and leapt out of last place in the AFC West. After uniting with journeyman quarterback Rich Gannon, Gruden led the Raiders to the top of the AFC West and they made the playoffs in 2000 and 2001. Oakland finished 12–4 in the 2000 season, the team&#x27;s most successful season in a decade, and its first division title since 1990, ultimately reaching the AFC Championship, where they lost, 16–3, to the eventual Super Bowl champion Baltimore Ravens. In 2001, the Raiders would return to the postseason with a 10–6 record, but in the AFC Divisional Round a negated fumble proved costly as they were defeated, 16–13, in overtime by the eventual Super Bowl champions New England Patriots. While Gruden was with the Raiders, Gruden acquired his nickname &quot;Chucky&quot; from Raiders defensive lineman Grady Jackson, who thought that the coach looked like the fictional character &quot;Chucky&quot; in the 1988 slasher movie &quot;Child&#x27;s Play&quot;.

====Tampa Bay Buccaneers====
After compiling a 40–28 win–loss record (including playoffs) in four seasons with the Raiders, Gruden replaced the fired Tony Dungy as head coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2002, via a high-stakes trade that included Tampa Bay&#x27;s 2002 and 2003 first-round draft picks, 2002 and 2004 second-round draft picks, and $8 million in cash. According to one source, Davis detailed the trade as such: &quot;I never liked it when teams would interfere with coaches under contract...Tampa Bay came to me and they said they wanted Gruden...I felt that I put the price tag so high that they wouldn&#x27;t agree to it. And they did. Gruden is no longer our coach.&quot; Gruden signed a five-year contract with the Buccaneers worth $17.5 million.

The Buccaneers&#x27; search for a head coach had taken more than two months, and Tampa Bay had expressed an interest in Gruden, but Davis had originally refused to release him from his contract. The team subsequently interviewed several other coaches and believed a deal was in place with Bill Parcells, before Parcells backed out, reportedly because his choice for General Manager, Mike Tannenbaum, told him not to accept the job because of the salary cap difficulties that Tampa Bay was about to endure. With the franchise&#x27;s search floundering, the fact that the coach who the Buccaneers wanted had only one year remaining on his deal, and the immediate hire of Dungy by the Indianapolis Colts, many fans and sports commentators began to openly question if the Buccaneers had made the right move by dismissing Dungy. Only a big splash hire could quiet the storm, and this may have been the primary motivation for the Buccaneers to give up as much as they did to acquire Gruden.

Immediately after arriving in Tampa Bay, Gruden significantly retooled the offense with the addition of numerous free agents. His determination to fix the under-performing offense, so often maligned during Dungy&#x27;s tenure, inspired Tampa&#x27;s defense to another #1 ranking, which helped the team to a 12–4 season. Both the offense and defense hit their stride in the playoffs; the Buccaneers posted a playoff per-game point differential of 23 points per game in victory, tied with the 1992 Dallas Cowboys for the highest average playoff margin of victory by a Super Bowl winner in the free agency era. Fans were especially satisfied with a victory in the NFC Championship against the Philadelphia Eagles, the team that had defeated Tampa Bay in the wild-card round two years running by the combined score of 52–12, and Gruden was especially satisfied with a dominant win over his old team, the Raiders, in Super Bowl XXXVII. Despite the Super Bowl win, there were many who attributed Gruden&#x27;s win primarily to the defense that coach Tony Dungy and defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin had created during Dungy&#x27;s tenure with the Buccaneers. Gruden, for his part, publicly and graciously thanked Dungy for his contributions upon accepting the Lombardi Trophy at the Super Bowl XXXVII postgame ceremony.

The victory made Gruden the youngest head coach to win the Super Bowl at age 39. This record would first be surpassed in Super Bowl XLIII by Mike Tomlin, who previously served under Gruden as the Buccaneers&#x27; defensive backs coach, and then by Sean McVay in Super Bowl LVI.

Gruden&#x27;s mantra for the 2002 season was &quot;Pound the Rock&quot;, a reference to commitment to the running game. Upon returning to Tampa after winning Super Bowl XXXVII, he led a capacity crowd at Raymond James Stadium in chanting the phrase. However, it seemingly disappeared from the lexicon the following year, and was not aggressively marketed or displayed on stadium video boards.

Unable to afford replacements, the following season saw the team decimated by injuries to many of the Super Bowl stars, including Joe Jurevicius, Greg Spires, Shelton Quarles, and Brian Kelly, as well as acrimony with highly paid veterans such as Sapp and wide receivers Keyshawn Johnson and Keenan McCardell. The Buccaneers finished 7–9 in 2003 and 5–11 in 2004 to become the first team to have consecutive losing seasons after winning the Super Bowl. A particular low point during this period occurred in a &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; home matchup against the Indianapolis Colts, led by Gruden&#x27;s predecessor Dungy. The Buccaneers dominated much of the game, allowing them to take a 35–14 lead near the end of the fourth quarter, but were overcome by a Colts rally that resulted in them losing 38–35.

When former Raiders general manager Bruce Allen joined the Buccaneers in 2004, Gruden finally had the general manager–head coach partnership he desired, and while the salary cap continued to plague the team (which spent the least money in the league between 2004 and 2009) their 2004 and 2005 drafts yielded a few impact players, including 2005 Offensive NFL Rookie of the Year Award winner Carnell &quot;Cadillac&quot; Williams.

Also, 2005 marked a return to the playoffs, as the Buccaneers posted a surprising 11–5 record, despite the loss of starting quarterback Brian Griese and some controversial coaching decisions, including a two-point conversion in the final seconds to defeat the Washington Redskins, who would later return to Tampa Bay and eliminate the Buccaneers from the Wild Card Round of the playoffs.

In 2006, Gruden led the Buccaneers to a dismal 4–12 season, which was his worst record as a head coach. That season marked the first time a Tampa Bay team had not won more than four games since 1991.

In an interview with Ira Kaufman of &quot;The Tampa Tribune&quot; on March 28, 2007, Buccaneers executive vice president Joel Glazer discussed the state of the Buccaneers. During the interview, Glazer defended Gruden&#x27;s performance, citing lost draft picks, injuries, and salary cap issues. However, he also said &quot;Mediocrity will never be standard for the Buccaneers, but we have to move on.&quot;

In 2007, the team finally cleared itself of salary cap constraints and united Gruden with a mobile West Coast quarterback in former Pro Bowler and Grey Cup winner Jeff Garcia. The Buccaneers returned to the playoffs in 2007 with a 9–7 record, including five divisional wins (after resting starters for the final two games) and despite suffering major injuries, several season-ending, to critical players like Luke Petitgout, Carnell Williams, Mike Alstott, Alex Smith, Brian Kelly, Barrett Ruud, Michael Clayton, Patrick Chukwurah, Gaines Adams, and starting kick and punt returner Mark Jones. Despite this adversity, however, Gruden declared &quot;The future is so bright around here I have to wear shades&quot;. The Buccaneers saw their season end in the Wild Card Round to the eventual Super Bowl XLII champion New York Giants.

In 2008, Gruden was rewarded with a contract extension through the 2011 season. Going into December, the Buccaneers were on pace to make the playoffs, claim a bye week and have home field advantage. However, the Buccaneers went winless in the month of December, in no small part due to a defensive collapse that saw the team give up an average of 30.75 points per game. On December 28, the Buccaneers were eliminated from making the playoffs by the Oakland Raiders, the team Gruden left for Tampa Bay. The Buccaneers ended the season with four losses in a row, and Gruden was fired by the Buccaneers on January 16, 2009, after seven seasons with the team.

====Post–Tampa Bay career====
In May 2010, Gruden became a volunteer assistant offensive line coach at Carrollwood Day School in Tampa, Florida. Shortly after being fired from Tampa Bay, Gruden created the Fired Football Coaches Association (FFCA). The organization (a &quot;football think-tank&quot;) had its headquarters in a rented office in a Tampa strip mall. The FFCA was known to have a large amount of game and player film collected by Gruden as well as playbooks and Gruden was known to have game plans of his own that he kept updated over the years he was not actively coaching. Many coaches such as Chip Kelly, Urban Meyer, Jim Haslett, Rick Venturi, Sean McVay, Greg Schiano and Monte Kiffin and many players came to the facility to watch film and talk with Gruden. Gruden closed the FFCA upon his returning to coaching in 2018 moving the game and player film along with the other information he held there to Oakland.

====Oakland / Las Vegas Raiders (second stint)====
After nine years away from coaching in the NFL, the Raiders announced the return of Gruden as head coach on January 6, 2018. He signed a 10-year, $100 million contract, one of the biggest contracts in the history of the league which also includes a no-trade clause, closing the loophole that saw the Raiders trade him to the Buccaneers in return for draft picks and cash. Gruden came back to coaching after six years of attempts by Raiders owner Mark Davis to lure him back to be the Raiders head coach. Gruden said that he came back due to his need to go compete: &quot;I got tired of sitting in a dark room, watching tape by myself.&quot; He added: &quot;I took rumba-dancing classes; that didn&#x27;t last—I wasn&#x27;t any good. Bought a boat; I never used it. Live on a golf course; I never play. I&#x27;d go to the FFCA early, and next thing I know it&#x27;s 10:30 at night. I&#x27;m thinking, &quot;Shit. I&#x27;m wasting my time. I got to go compete.&quot;&quot; Some of Gruden&#x27;s first few moves included signing several veterans, drafting Kolton Miller in the first round of the 2018 draft and trading away Khalil Mack for 2019 and 2020 first-round draft picks, and later trading Amari Cooper for the Dallas Cowboys&#x27; first-round draft pick. The team finished 4–12 in his first year back with the team.

In 2019, due to a strong rookie class showing, Gruden led the Raiders to a 6–4 record to start the season. However, after many crucial players suffering injuries, the Raiders ended their last season in Oakland 1–5 and 7–9 overall.

Gruden was fined $100,000 by the NFL for not properly wearing a face mask, as required for coaches during the COVID-19 pandemic, during a Week 2 game in the 2020 NFL season on September 22, 2020. He was fined an additional $150,000 for further COVID-19 protocol violations on November 5, 2020. Gruden led the Raiders to an 8–8 record in the 2020 season. The Raiders finished second in the AFC West with an 8-8 record and missed the playoffs.

The Raiders began the 2021 season with a 3–0 record, including two overtime wins. The Raiders lost the following two games. Under their interim coach Rich Bisaccia, the Raiders made the playoffs, something they had not done under Gruden during his second stint with the team.

====Email controversy and resignation====
In October 2021, a league investigation into the Washington Football Team for workplace misconduct uncovered emails Gruden sent from 2011 to 2018 to then Washington general manager Bruce Allen where Gruden used racist, misogynistic, and homophobic slurs. The emails referred to NFL commissioner Roger Goodell as a &quot;faggot&quot;, and a &quot;clueless anti football pussy&quot;. Gruden also said Goodell should not have pressured the Rams to draft &quot;queers&quot;, referring to Michael Sam, the first openly gay player drafted in NFL history. Jeff Fisher, who was the coach of the Rams at the time, denied that he was pressured and stated he drafted Sam entirely based on his football skills. Gruden stated that players who protest the national anthem should be &quot;fired&quot;, specifically referring to former 49ers safety Eric Reid. Gruden used a racist stereotype to describe NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith, saying &quot;Dumboriss Smith has lips the size of michellin tires&quot;. Gruden also criticized Barack Obama during his 2012 re-election campaign and called then–Vice President Joe Biden a &quot;nervous clueless pussy&quot;. Gruden also joked to Allen that he should tell Bryan Glazer, co-owner of the Buccaneers, to perform oral sex on Gruden, and mocked Caitlyn Jenner for receiving an ESPN award following her gender transition. Gruden, Allen and others were sent emails from unknown members of the Washington Football Team staff that contained photos of topless women, including two Washington Football Team cheerleaders. Gruden resigned on October 11, 2021, after details of the emails were released by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Gruden announced his intentions to sue the NFL and Roger Goodell for exposing his scandals. A Nevada judge threw out a bid from the NFL to dismiss the case on May 25, 2022.

Gruden was removed from the Buccaneers Ring of Honor, where he had been inducted in 2017, as a result of the content of the emails. However, in February 2025, the Buccaneers announced Gruden would be reinstated onto the Ring of Honor.

====Coaching consultant role====
Gruden was invited by New Orleans Saints head coach Dennis Allen to attend offseason meetings in May 2023 to help the offensive coaching staff adjust to new Saints quarterback Derek Carr, but did not join as a full-time member of the staff, himself. Gruden was spotted with the Saints training camp in August 2023 and was expected to continue his advisory role.

====Milano Seamen====
In March 2024, it was announced that Gruden had joined the Milano Seamen of the European League of Football as an advisor.

==Broadcasting career==

In May 2009, Gruden was hired by ESPN to serve as a color analyst on its &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; telecasts, replacing Tony Kornheiser. He also served as an analyst for ESPN&#x27;s coverage of the NFL draft and postseason college football games, helping to call the 2010 Rose Bowl and 2010 BCS National Championship Game on ESPN Radio and the 2011 Outback Bowl and 2011 Orange Bowl on ESPN. In the spring of 2012, Gruden became the focus of the series &quot;Jon Gruden&#x27;s QB Camp&quot;, where he went over the NFL development process with prospective NFL draftees at quarterback, including Andrew Luck and Robert Griffin III. During the &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; broadcast, Gruden gave out a weekly award called the &quot;Gruden Grinder&quot; to the best player in the game that week.

Gruden signed a contract extension with ESPN, beginning in September 2012, that lengthened his tenure with the broadcasting company for another five years. On December 15, 2014, Gruden and ESPN agreed to a contract extension through 2021 but allowed an out in the event he wanted to return to coaching. The deal made Gruden the highest paid personality at ESPN. After deciding to return to the coaching ranks with the Raiders for the 2018 NFL season, his last game for ESPN was the 2017 AFC Wild Card Round between the Tennessee Titans and the Kansas City Chiefs, which the Titans narrowly won 22–21.

Gruden joined Barstool Sports in November 2024. He is featured on shows such as The Pro Football Football Show, The Yak, Pardon My Take, Dog Walk, and What&#x27;s For Lunch?

<text>The St. Louis Steamers was the name of a professional indoor soccer team based in St. Louis, Missouri. It was the second team to use this name. The first played in the Major Indoor Soccer League from 1979–1988, while this version played in the World Indoor Soccer League from 2000 to 2001, then in the MISL from the 2003–04 season to the 2005–06 season.

The St. Louis Steamers were granted a World Indoor Soccer League expansion franchise in December 1998 but did not begin to play until the 2000 season. In 2002, the team, along with fellow WISL teams Dallas Sidekicks and San Diego Sockers joined the Major Indoor Soccer League when the two leagues merged. However, the Steamers elected to take a year off to reorganize.

The team was purchased before the 2004–05 season by owners planning a reality television series about the team, which was called &quot;Red Card&quot; and played on KPLR channel 11. The team suspended operations after the 2005–2006 season.

<text>Stone is a Finnish thrash metal band formed in Kerava in 1985. They released four albums and one live album during the late 1980s and early 1990s, before disbanding in 1992 to pursue different musical directions. Stone reunited to play a final set of concerts in 2000, but parted ways again soon afterwards. In 2008, Stone made five &quot;reunion&quot;/comeback appearances. They reunited again in March 2013 for select shows in order to promote their new box set. The band has remained active since then, and they have new material in the works.

Despite their rather short career, Stone&#x27;s legacy has provided inspiration for many of the countless metal bands who emerged during the popularity explosion of the genre during the 1990s. The band&#x27;s history and influence on the Finnish metal scene was detailed in the book &quot;Stone&quot;, published in January 2018.

Children of Bodom lead guitarist Alexi Laiho credits former Stone member Roope Latvala as a major influence on his playing. Latvala himself would later join Children of Bodom as a session player, and eventually as a permanent member, after the departure of Alexander Kuoppala, and also played alongside Laiho in the now defunct Sinergy.

<doc id="1085042" wikidata="Q1289810" url="?curid=1085042" title="Mathew St. Patrick">
<text>Mathew St. Patrick (born March 17, 1969) is an American actor best known for his portrayal of Keith Charles on the HBO drama series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; (2001−05). Previously, Patrick appeared as Marcus Taggert in &quot;General Hospital&quot; (1997) and Adrian Sword in &quot;All My Children&quot; (1998−2000), both soap operas. St. Patrick also had a leading role as Detective Kenneth Marjorino in the series &quot;Reunion&quot; (2005−06). His film roles include &quot;War&quot; (2007) and &quot;Alien Raiders&quot; (2008).

==Early life==
St. Patrick was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Curtis St. Patrick, a hot dog vendor, and Brenda (née Queen), who taught grade school. He was on the varsity track team of Olney High School, but graduated in 1986 from Scotland School for Veterans&#x27; Children in Scotland, Pennsylvania, the last remaining school for children of military veterans in the United States.

After graduating from high school, he lived in New York and then for eight years in the Chicago, Illinois area ( Carol Stream, Illinois) where he worked a wide variety of jobs: delivery salesman for Coca-Cola in St. Charles, Illinois, at UPS, a furniture store delivery driver ( Zierks Furnishings ) in St. Charles, Illinois, driving an 18-wheeled flatbed truck for Quikrete of Chicago, and for the Union Pacific Railroad loading &amp; unloading new cars &amp; trucks at West Chicago Yard. 

==Acting career==
In 1994, St. Patrick moved to Los Angeles, California to begin his acting career. In Los Angeles, he first worked as a personal trainer then in 1996 joined the West Coast Theater Ensemble. After acting in his first stage production, &quot;Full Court Press&quot;, an agent noticed him and cast St. Patrick in the latter&#x27;s film debut, &quot;Steel Sharks&quot; (1997), playing a Navy serviceman.

St. Patrick was cast as Detective Marcus Taggert on soap opera &quot;General Hospital&quot; in 1997, replacing Réal Andrews in the role. However, his time in the role was brief, and Andrews returned as Marcus in 1998. St. Patrick was not satisfied with Marcus&#x27; character, describing him as &quot;one-dimensional.&quot; He joined another soap opera, &quot;All My Children&quot;, as police lieutenant Adrian Sword, appearing in the series until 2000. For his performance as Adrian, St. Patrick received two NAACP Image Award nominations for Outstanding Actor in a Daytime Drama Series, in 1999 and 2000.

He made guest appearances on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot; and &quot;Crossing Jordan&quot;. St. Patrick landed the role of Keith Charles in the HBO series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; in 2001, portraying a gay black man in an interracial relationship with David Fisher (Michael C. Hall). Alongside his &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; cast members, St. Patrick was nominated five consecutive times for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series (2001−05), winning the award in 2002 and 2003. St. Patrick continued playing Keith until the series ended in 2005.

St. Patrick starred as Detective Marjorino in the Fox drama series &quot;Reunion&quot;, which ran from 2005 to 2006. Additionally, he played an FBI agent in the film &quot;War&quot; (2007) and Seth in the science fiction horror film &quot;Alien Raiders&quot; (2008). St. Patrick voiced an EMT in the &quot;Mr. Mathers&quot; skit featured on Eminem&#x27;s album &quot;Relapse&quot; (2009). He was the first voice of Skulker on &quot;Danny Phantom&quot; (2004) and did voice work in preschool series &quot;Higglytown Heroes&quot; (2005−06).

Following the end of &quot;Six Feet Under&quot;, most of St. Patrick&#x27;s roles on television have been minor characters. He appeared in the pilot of the TV series &quot;&quot; (2013) and guest starred on &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot; (2006), &quot;Private Practice&quot; (2009) and &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; (2017). St. Patrick had a recurring role during the final season of the award-winning FX drama &quot;Sons of Anarchy&quot; (2014), as Moses Cartwright.

==Personal life==
St. Patrick has a son and reads the bible regularly.

<doc id="1085051" wikidata="Q1825776" url="?curid=1085051" title="Reptile (Mortal Kombat)">
<text>Reptile is a character in the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting game franchise by Midway Games and NetherRealm Studios. He debuted in the original 1992 game as a hidden opponent, establishing him as the first secret character in fighting game history. Reptile became playable in the follow-up &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993) and has remained a mainstay of the franchise. As implied by his name, he is a Saurian, a fictional species of reptilian humanoids. One of the last surviving members of his race, he aligns himself with the series&#x27; primary villains in the hope his service will lead to the Saurians&#x27; revival.

Outside of the games, Reptile has appeared in various related media. Reception to the character has been positive, with praise for his evolution from a hidden character to one of the franchise&#x27;s most iconic fighters.

==Conception and history==
Reptile&#x27;s character concept was conceived by &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; co-creator and lead programmer Ed Boon after the original 1992 game was released into arcades. Noting the success of the palette swap method used for the sprites of the game&#x27;s ninja characters Scorpion and Sub-Zero, he and series character designer John Tobias collaborated on including a &quot;super secret hidden feature&quot; in the game who would be a &quot;cooler version of Scorpion&quot;. Boon and Tobias were inspired by the Sheng Long urban legend from &quot;Street Fighter II&quot; when Reptile was conceived as a hidden character. Reptile was completed in a single evening, and inserted into the third revision of the game in August 1992, the same month the game was first released. Reptile was not selectable nor playable as his inclusion was originally intended as a marketing tool for the game due to the extreme conditions required for players to encounter him, with the developers in turn hoping word of mouth would spread rumors of the character&#x27;s existence. Boon noted in a 1995 interview that the positive response to the character led to Reptile&#x27;s inclusion in subsequent series installments as a playable fighter.

===Design and gameplay===
Reptile appeared in the digitized &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; fighting games as a palette swap of the two male ninja characters, with his green armor representing a combination of Scorpion and Sub-Zero&#x27;s yellow and blue, respectively. He retained this design upon his playable debut in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993), with his true reptilian nature first revealed whenever his face mask was pulled down for his acid spit attack, or removed entirely for his tongue-grab Fatality and his arcade ending. He and the other ninja characters were omitted from &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995) but included in the upgrade &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;. For the three-dimensional release &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; (1997), he was given a unique design for the first time with minimal body armor, his face fully exposed, and more of his true reptilian identity revealed. With the palette-swap characters receiving distinct makeovers for the series&#x27; three-dimensional fighting games, Reptile was given a full reptilian design in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002) that included a long tail while he wore minimal gold and black armor, a design that was maintained for his nonplayable appearance in the 2005 beat &#x27;em up title &quot;Mortal Kombat: Shaolin Monks&quot; with the exception of black straps wrapped around his head that left his eyes and mouth exposed. Reptile did not appear in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004), but returned with the then-entire series roster in the 2006 compilation title &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot;.

As a secret non-playable character in the first &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, Reptile copied Sub-Zero&#x27;s and Scorpion&#x27;s special moves and fought with increased speed. He received his own distinct set of attacks starting with his playable debut in &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot;.

Reptile&#x27;s Fatalities in &quot;MKII&quot; consist of revealing his reptilian face and using his long tongue to devour the opponent&#x27;s head, or turning invisible and severing their torso. Later finishing moves expand upon the concept, ranging from regurgitating acid upon the defeated opponent to leaping upon their body and gnawing the flesh from their skulls. In a 2006 series retrospective, the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; development team named Reptile&#x27;s finishers as some of their favorites from the series.

==Appearances==
===Video games===
In the original &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; (1992), Reptile is an unplayable hidden character. He randomly appears onscreen prior to a match with clues on how to access him, with players then required to follow specific guidelines in order to fight him. In &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; (1993), Reptile is now a playable character with the storyline of his being a member of a reptilian race from the fictional dimension of Outworld that was enslaved by its evil emperor Shao Kahn. Promised the revival of his race in exchange for his loyalty, Reptile serves as the bodyguard of evil sorcerer Shang Tsung. Reptile was omitted from &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot; (1995), but returned for the upgrade &quot;Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3&quot;. He is assigned to find and assassinate Edenian princess Kitana after she kills her evil twin Mileena. In &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot; (1997), he serves as a minion to the fallen Elder God Shinnok, for which he is again promised the restoration of his race.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance&quot; (2002), Reptile returns to Shao Kahn&#x27;s service. After overhearing Shang Tsung&#x27;s plot to kill Kahn, he attempts to warn his master but meets Nitara, a vampire who offers knowledge of his race. Reptile pledges his loyalties to her but ultimately realizes she is merely using him. He sets out to kill her but instead finds a mysterious egg belonging to the Dragon King Onaga. He is not playable in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Deception&quot; (2004), in which the egg transforms him into Onaga&#x27;s avatar, which sets up the events of the game. Separated from Onaga after the latter&#x27;s defeat, Reptile returns in &quot;Mortal Kombat: Armageddon&quot; (2006) with the then-entire roster of series characters. In the game&#x27;s opening sequence, he fights alongside the forces of evil in a battle to claim the elemental Blaze&#x27;s godlike power.

The thunder god and Earth protector Raiden resets the series timeline in the 2011 reboot game &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, in hopes of preventing Armageddon. Reptile has a minimal presence as a representative of Outworld in its attempt to conquer Earth. In the Shaolin tournament from the original game, he is present from the outset but defeated by Johnny Cage. In the second tournament, he is assigned to fight Sub-Zero but loses, and during the invasion of Earth in the retold events of &quot;Mortal Kombat 3&quot;, Reptile is beaten by riot officer Kurtis Stryker in combat.

In &quot;Mortal Kombat X&quot; (2015), Reptile is now identified by the name Syzoth. He plays an instrumental role in new Outworld ruler Kotal Kahn usurping Mileena for the throne, when he reveals that Mileena is not Shao Kahn&#x27;s biological daughter. Reptile joins Ermac, Erron Black, and Ferra/Torr in serving Kotal Kahn as they conflict with Cassie Cage&#x27;s military unit in their attempt to protect their home realm of Outworld from Shinnok&#x27;s forces.

In the rebooted storyline of &quot;Mortal Kombat 1&quot; (2023), Reptile&#x27;s race of the Zaterrans is no longer extinct, but he becomes an outcast among his people for his ability to assume a humanlike appearance. He is blackmailed into serving Shang Tsung, who is holding his family hostage, and the sorcerer is able to learn Syzoth&#x27;s shapeshifting ability as a result. After Syzoth fails to contain several captured Earth warriors, Shang Tsung reveals he has already slain his family. As a result, Syzoth joins forces with Fire God Liu Kang and the Earth heroes to help prevent the destruction of Earth and Outworld by Shang Tsung and his cohort, the necromancer Quan Chi. After Titan Shang Tsung and his forces are defeated at the conclusion, the newly crowned Outworld empress Mileena asks Syzoth to be her emissary to the Zaterrans, which allows him to return to his homeland free of shame. However, he uncovers records revealing that many Zaterrans also have the ability to shapeshift but were killed by their government in order to keep it from spreading, and he vows to find a way to end their barbaric policies.

Reptile was among several series characters originally included in the &quot;Tournament Edition&quot; of &quot;NBA Jam&quot; (1993) as unlockable players, but they were removed from later versions of the game at the request of the NBA due to concerns over the violent nature of the &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; series.

===Other media===
In Malibu Comics&#x27; &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; comic book series, Reptile joins the &quot;Mortal Kombat II&quot; characters in the three-issue miniseries &quot;Goro: Prince of Pain&quot; (1994), and in the six-issue miniseries &quot;Battlewave&quot; (1995), he hypnotizes Sonya Blade into wanting to marry Shao Kahn before the plot is thwarted by the Earth heroes. The junior novel &quot;Mortal Kombat: Reptile&#x27;s World&quot; (1996), written by C. Dean Anderson, tells the past of Reptile&#x27;s race through the perspectives of other series characters.

In the 1995 motion picture &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, Reptile appears as a computer-generated bipedal lizard ordered by Shang Tsung to keep Princess Kitana away from the Earth heroes. He follows them into Outworld but is discovered by Liu Kang, after which Reptile assumes a human form to fight Liu Kang but is killed in battle. Reptile was played by actor and martial artist Keith Cooke, and was a late inclusion in response to focus groups being unimpressed with the film&#x27;s original fights.

An original character named Komodai, who bore a physical resemblance to Reptile, was featured in an episode of the animated series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Defenders of the Realm&quot; (1996). Reptile briefly appears in the 2020 animated film &quot;Mortal Kombat Legends: Scorpion&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, in which he is killed by Sonya Blade in a fight scene.

Reptile was played by Jon Valera in one episode of the 1998 syndicated television series &quot;Mortal Kombat: Conquest&quot;. He is the commander of Shao Kahn&#x27;s army of Raptors until he betrays Kahn and schemes to share dominion over his domain until he is killed by Kahn&#x27;s priests. In the 2010 short film &quot;Mortal Kombat: Rebirth&quot;, a grittier contemporary take on the series canon, Reptile (played by Richard Dorton) is depicted as a cannibalistic killer afflicted with Harlequin-type ichthyosis. In the 2021 film reboot &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, Reptile is sent by Shang Tsung to dispatch the chosen Earth participants of the Mortal Kombat tournament, but is killed by Kano. Like the 1995 film, the character was depicted in bipedal reptilian form and computer-generated.

===Merchandise and promotion===
A Reptile action figure was released by Hasbro as part of a G.I. Joe line of toys, packaged with the series-themed vehicle for the toyline. The figure comes with a katana and grappling hook. Another action figure to promote &quot;Shaolin Monks&quot; was released in 2006 by Jazwares. Fully posable, it includes an alternate head, detachable tongue and a large-bladed scimitar. He was one of many &quot;MK&quot; characters depicted on 2.5&quot; x 3.5&quot; collectible magnets released by Ata-Boy Wholesale in 2011. Reptile also featured prominently in the introduction sequence of &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;, portions of which were used in a television commercial to promote the game.

==Reception==

While Reptile has received positive critical reception for his origins as a hidden character, response to his other characteristics has been mixed. Zach Gass of &quot;TheGamer&quot; praised the evolution of the character throughout his series appearances. &quot;Like all of the rainbow ninjas in the series, Reptile has grown and developed a look, fighting style, and character all his own.&quot; He was fifth in Game Revolution&#x27;s list of top &quot;old school&quot; &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters&quot;, praised for his introduction in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; and his changes in the sequel. Reptile was featured in a 2008 MSN article about the ten greatest Easter eggs in gaming. In 2010 UGO, included him on the list of the 25 coolest hidden characters in video gaming. In UGO Networks&#x27; 2012 list of the top &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; characters, Reptile placed sixth, stating that he is the best hidden character in the series. In a 2020 episode of the Rotten Tomatoes podcast &quot;Rotten Tomatoes Is Wrong&quot; discussing the 1995 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film, the panelists opined that Reptile is one of the worst characters in the series, mentioning his origin as a palette swap, and argued that the series should have kept him as a hidden character because it was the one thing that made him cool.

Reptile&#x27;s absence in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot; was questioned by Dale Wilson of &quot;PlayStation LifeStyle&quot;, whom stated &quot;With classic characters like Scorpion, Subzero, Johnny Cage, Jade, and Sonya Blade all making appearances in &quot;Mortal Kombat 11&quot;, I find it odd that Reptile was left out of the mix.&quot;

Gavin Jasper from &quot;Den of Geek&quot; criticized Reptile&#x27;s design in the 1995 &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; film, stating &quot;he did not age well at all.&quot; Gasper was appreciative of Reptile using his acid spit from the games, however.

<doc id="1085053" wikidata="Q2993304" url="?curid=1085053" title="Bateman–Horn conjecture">
<text>In number theory, the Bateman–Horn conjecture is a statement concerning the frequency of prime numbers among the values of a system of polynomials, named after mathematicians Paul T. Bateman and Roger A. Horn who proposed it in 1962. It provides a vast generalization of such conjectures as the Hardy and Littlewood conjecture on the density of twin primes or their conjecture on primes of the form &quot;n&quot;2 + 1; it is also a strengthening of Schinzel&#x27;s hypothesis H.

==Definition==
The Bateman–Horn conjecture provides a conjectured density for the positive integers at which a given set of polynomials all have prime values. For a set of &quot;m&quot; distinct irreducible polynomials &quot;ƒ&quot;1, ..., &quot;ƒ&quot;&quot;m&quot; with integer coefficients, an obvious necessary condition for the polynomials to simultaneously generate prime values infinitely often is that they satisfy Bunyakovsky&#x27;s property, that there does not exist a prime number &quot;p&quot; that divides their product &quot;f&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) for every positive integer &quot;n&quot;. For, if there were such a prime &quot;p&quot;, having all values of the polynomials simultaneously prime for a given &quot;n&quot; would imply that at least one of them must be equal to &quot;p&quot;, which can only happen for finitely many values of &quot;n&quot; or there would be a polynomial with infinitely many roots, whereas the conjecture is how to give conditions where the values are simultaneously prime for infinitely many &quot;n&quot;.

An integer &quot;n&quot; is prime-generating for the given system of polynomials if every polynomial &quot;ƒi&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) produces a prime number when given &quot;n&quot; as its argument. If &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) is the number of prime-generating integers among the positive integers less than &quot;x&quot;, then the Bateman–Horn conjecture states that

:formula_1

where &quot;D&quot; is the product of the degrees of the polynomials and where &quot;C&quot; is the product over primes &quot;p&quot;

:formula_2

with formula_3 the number of solutions to

:formula_4

Bunyakovsky&#x27;s property implies formula_5 for all primes &quot;p&quot;,
so each factor in the infinite product &quot;C&quot; is positive.
Intuitively one then naturally expects that the constant &quot;C&quot; is itself positive, and with some work this can be proved.
(Work is needed since some infinite products of positive numbers equal zero.)

==Negative numbers==
As stated above, the conjecture is not true: the single polynomial &quot;ƒ&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;) = −&quot;x&quot; produces only negative numbers when given a positive argument, so the fraction of prime numbers among its values is always zero. There are two equally valid ways of refining the conjecture to avoid this difficulty:
*One may require all the polynomials to have positive leading coefficients, so that only a constant number of their values can be negative.
*Alternatively, one may allow negative leading coefficients but count a negative number as being prime when its absolute value is prime.
It is reasonable to allow negative numbers to count as primes as a step towards formulating more general conjectures that apply to other systems of numbers than the integers, but at the same time it is easy
to just negate the polynomials if necessary to reduce to the case where the leading coefficients are positive.

==Examples==
If the system of polynomials consists of the single polynomial &quot;ƒ&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot;, then the values &quot;n&quot; for which &quot;ƒ&quot;1(&quot;n&quot;) is prime are themselves the prime numbers, and the conjecture becomes a restatement of the prime number theorem.

If the system of polynomials consists of the two polynomials &quot;ƒ&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; and &quot;ƒ&quot;2(&quot;x&quot;) = &quot;x&quot; + 2, then the values of &quot;n&quot; for which both &quot;ƒ&quot;1(&quot;n&quot;) and &quot;ƒ&quot;2(&quot;n&quot;) are prime are just the smaller of the two primes in every pair of twin primes. In this case, the Bateman–Horn conjecture reduces to the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture on the density of twin primes, according to which the number of twin prime pairs less than &quot;x&quot; is
:formula_6

==Analogue for polynomials over a finite field==

When the integers are replaced by the polynomial ring &quot;F&quot;[&quot;u&quot;] for a finite field &quot;F&quot;, one can ask how often a finite set of polynomials &quot;f&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;u&quot;][&quot;x&quot;] simultaneously takes irreducible values in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;u&quot;] when we substitute for &quot;x&quot; elements of &quot;F&quot;[&quot;u&quot;]. Well-known analogies between integers and &quot;F&quot;[&quot;u&quot;] suggest an analogue of the Bateman–Horn conjecture over &quot;F&quot;[&quot;u&quot;], but the analogue is wrong. For example, data suggest that the polynomial

::formula_7

in &quot;F&quot;3[&quot;u&quot;][&quot;x&quot;] takes (asymptotically) the expected number of irreducible values when &quot;x&quot; runs over polynomials in &quot;F&quot;3[&quot;u&quot;] of odd degree, but it appears to take (asymptotically) twice as many irreducible values as expected when &quot;x&quot; runs over polynomials of degree that is 2 mod 4, while it (provably) takes &quot;no&quot; irreducible values at all when &quot;x&quot; runs over nonconstant polynomials with degree that is a multiple of 4. An analogue of the Bateman–Horn conjecture over &quot;F&quot;[&quot;u&quot;] which fits numerical data uses an additional factor in the asymptotics which depends on the value of &quot;d&quot; mod 4, where &quot;d&quot; is the degree of the polynomials in &quot;F&quot;[&quot;u&quot;] over which &quot;x&quot; is sampled.

<text>In many sports, a competition number is used to identify and differentiate the competitors taking part in a competitive endeavour. For example, runners in a race may wear prominent competition numbers so that they may be clearly identified from a distance. Competition numbers are differentiated from uniform numbers in that the former are used for a specific event (for example, competition numbers worn by marathon runners) while the latter persist over time through multiple events, seasons, or sometimes an entire career (for example, uniform numbers worn by Major League Baseball players).

Competition numbers may also be called bib numbers when worn on bibs over, or affixed to, the athletes&#x27; tops. With new technology, bibs might contain timing chips for electronic identification. In addition to identifying an athlete, many high profile events also imprint sponsor logos. In such high profile events, bib numbers are mandatory. Failure to wear them could make an athlete subject to disqualification.

==Athletics==
Since the 2000s, track and field athletes at major competitions wear their names as well as their numbers on their bibs. In relay events, all team members have the IOC country code. Track athletes also wear lane numbers on the shorts called &quot;hip numbers&quot;, for identification by the fully automatic timing system which photographs athletes from the side as they cross a finish line. In racewalking events, competitors also must wear numbers on their backs for identification by the judges after a violation has been detected.

In mixed competitions, like marathons, where professional athletes run on the same course as non-elite athletes, the professionals traditionally wear bibs with their names to differentiate their pre-race status.

==Motorsport==
In some types of motorsport, such as rallys, competition numbers are attached to the vehicles taking part in a specific event. The competition number can also be used in conjunction with some kinds of timing systems, such as targa timing.

===Gallery===
==Other sports==
Other sports that may utilize competition numbers include:
* Alpine skiing
* Biathlon
* BMX racing
* Gymnastics
* Snowboarding
* Triathlon

==Notable competition numbers==
While the uniform numbers of various sportspeople have become well-known (for example, Wayne Gretzky&#x27;s 99, Michael Jordan&#x27;s 23, and Mickey Mantle&#x27;s 7), this is rare for competition numbers, which generally are used by an athlete only for a single event. Some notable exceptions include:

* 6 used by Paul Bikle, a gliding competitor. The Bikle T-6, a glider, was named for Bikle&#x27;s competition number and the T-tailed design of the aircraft.
* 13 in cycling, which is commonly worn upside-down due to triskaidekaphobia.
* 51 in the Tour de France, due to a false belief that it has been worn by more winners than any other number.
* 261 in the Boston Marathon, due to it being worn by Kathrine Switzer in the 1967 edition of the event, when she became the first woman to run the race as a numbered entrant. Switzer later created a non-profit organization named 261 Fearless.

At the 2019 Boston Marathon, organizers gave special bib numbers to several celebrities. Former NFL player Tedy Bruschi was given 5454, his uniform number repeated; NASCAR driver Jimmie Johnson was given 4848, his car number with Hendrick Motorsports repeated; and Joan Benoit Samuelson was given 1979, the year of her first win in the event.

==Story==

Twelve-year-old junior high school student Hibari Hanakoganei lives in Akihabara, a suburb of Tokyo, in the year 2010. The current craze among young girls in Akihabara are electronic pets called &quot;Pata-Pi.&quot; Hibari seems to be the only girl in town without one and can only admire the PataPi owned by her best friend, Suzume, whom she has named Francesca.

Late one evening, Hibari sees a hill and recognizes a person standing beside a tree at its peak as &quot;her Prince&quot;, who has been appearing to her in her dreams. She runs towards him and he mysteriously vanishes. A glowing sphere descends from the sky and lands on her palms. It materializes into a PataPi. She hugs it and the adventure of Hibari and Densuke the PataPi begins.

Unbeknownst to Hibari, she is under the watchful eye of a shadowy character and is ambushed while walking home from school by strange creatures called Homunculus and a masked woman (Jun). Hibari finds out that they are after Densuke and strives to protect him. When all else fails, Jun calls out a more powerful creature called Cerberus to attack Hibari and take Densuke from her. Out of extreme love for Densuke, Hibari cries out and an intense beam of light descends from the sky onto Densuke. Densuke vanishes and transformed into a woman in a black body suit to which various mecha components materialize and bond to her. Densuke has become the Diva (Aphrodite), who looks remarkably like Hibari. Aphrodite soundly defeats Cerberus while Jun runs away in defeated frustration. Unknown to Hibari, a masked man in black (Takashi a.k.a. Shooting Star) stands at the top of a building, observing every moment of what happened.

Shortly thereafter, Aphrodite vanishes, and Densuke re-appears and falls to the ground as Hibari quickly scoops him up.

The next few episodes focus on unlocking the Diva within the other PataPies. It shows how the three girls get along and form the Cyberteam in Akihabara, aimed at stopping masked women and their Homunculus from terrorising the city of Akihabara.

In subsequent episodes, Kamome and Tsubame are introduced. Washuu is revealed as the founder of a Celtic organization called Rosenkreuz (Rose Cross in German) and he himself is Christian Rosenkreuz, hiding under the name of Washuu Ryuugasaki to carry out his agenda. He once worked for the famous alchemist Paracelsus and collaborated with a French man, Cigogne Raspailles, and a young American man, Crane Bahnsteik to invent a device that can grant immortality (Divas). However, due to their secrecy, none of their inventions is revealed to the world. After Crane discovers that inventions made by the world lead to World Wars and the implications of Divas falling into the hands of warmongers, he ran off to space in his invented space rocket with all the plans on the immortality project.

The owner of the PataPi can fuse with the Diva to form a complete Diva. This is only possible for those who are the chosen Anima Mundi and possess a pure and undefiled heart. Towards the end of the series, only Hibari and Tsubame fuse with their Divas; Hibari beginning in episode 17 and Tsubame during episode 21. In the movie, all five of the girls fuse with their divas just prior to the film&#x27;s climax in the Primum Mobile space fortress. The fact that Takashi is a clone of Crane, and used by Washu like a puppet to awaken the sleeping Divas in space (kept in Crane&#x27;s space fortress the Primum Mobile), causes Takashi to rebel and find his identity in the world, with the three women Jun, Miyama and Hatoko joining him.

Towards the end of the series, Kamome&#x27;s grandfather, Shimabukuro Sengakuji, reveals everything he knows about Rosenkreuz, the concept of Divas, which are artificial forms powered by neutrinos, and the principal Washu, who is the mastermind behind the events. Soon after, Washu discards his pseudo-identity, reverting to the original Christian Rosenkreuz, and changes the school into a large altar to welcome the descent of the Primum Mobile. He finds out that Crane was the one controlling the events that happened and dies soon after of old age due to rapid aging. Then Crane issues an ultimatum to Japan that he seeks the Anima Mundi and will threaten to destroy the country and the world if it is not met. Finally, at the end, the girls rebel and the Divas sacrifice themselves in place of the girls.

At the end of the series, it appears that Takashi survived. He is seen at the end of a speeding train with a small girl who looks exactly like Tsubame. She has a Pata Pi that looks exactly like Petite Ange. He cradles the child in his arms and says, &quot;Come now, my Anima Mundi, we have work to do.&quot;

==Cast and characters==
:
:The protagonist. She is a typical girl who is not good in academics, but has a pure and trusting heart. Her Pata-Pi is Densuke (デンスケ), a simplistic winged one whose only word is &quot;Pee!&quot;; it transforms into the Diva Aphrodite. Hibari was Crane Bahnsteik&#x27;s princess as Crane calls her as his Anima Mundi when he gives Densuke to her during their first meeting. Hibari&#x27;s name means &quot;skylark&quot; and her surname is probably derived from the name of the Hanakoganei station in Tokyo. Her younger brother died during childbirth and his name was supposed to be Densuke, hence her great affection for her PataPi.
:
:Hibari&#x27;s classmate who is her best friend. She is intelligent, mature, and even comes from a wealthy family. She&#x27;s quite vain and stuck up and gets jealous of other girls with bigger breasts than hers, like Kamome. Her PataPi is Francesca (フランチェスカ &quot;Furanchesuka&quot;), one which is an equally intelligent multitasker whom Suzume improves to be &quot;the best&quot;; it transforms into the Diva Hestia.

Brought up by Cigogne as a special catalyst for the return of the Primum Mobile, she is isolated from society all this while. Hibari befriends her and will eventually break Tsubame&#x27;s apparent evilness at the end of episode 20. The closing of episode 20 shows that Tsubame is adopted by Hibari&#x27;s parents as the credits roll over artwork depicting Hinako (Hibari&#x27;s Mother) in bed caressing Hibari on one side and Tsubame on the other. Her Pata-Pi is Petit-Ange (プティアンジュ &quot;Puti-Anju&quot; also French for &quot;Little Angel), one which is basically dumb; it transforms into the Diva Erinyes. Tsubame&#x27;s name literally means &quot;barn swallow&quot;.
:
:Kamome&#x27;s grandfather. Kamome generally learns anything about Pata-Pis from him as he was once a part of Rosenkreuz&#x27;s secret scientists&#x27; society. He is a perverted voyer with a penchant for peeking up girls&#x27; skirts and in one episode, attempting to spy on them in the beach changing room. Nonetheless he vigilantly watches out for the girls from afar and genuinely seeks to protect them.
:
:A lesbian who admires fellow girls for various reasons. She is madly in love with Hibari for her &quot;slender body.&quot; She later falls for Kamome due to her &quot;bust size&quot;(or lack thereof). She has a Pata-Pi named Enoken (エノケン), a dog-like one which can only grow its ears. Uzura&#x27;s name literally means &quot;quail&quot;. In the Movie Uzura is featured more prominently.
:
:An office lady. She passionately longs for the so-called &quot;Black Prince Shooting Star&quot; and goes out to steal the specially designed PataPis to please him. She calls herself Bloody Falcon when in battle. Cerberus is Jun&#x27;s personal Avatar and her apostolus is Astaroth.

He once allied himself with Rosenkreuz&#x27;s secret society and even created a computer with him called Metatron to contact the Anima Mundi. But he broke away when he found out that Rosenkreuz wanted to use Metatron for his own purposes. He currently resides with Metatron inside &quot;Primum Mobile&quot;, a satellite that has been orbiting Earth even before Sputnik I, living in suspended animation and sending &quot;messages&quot; to people through their dreams. In some episodes, Crane comforts Hibari when she was taunted by her enemies and giving advice to her. But in Episode 24 until the finale, he was revealed to be responsible of awakening the Divas instead of Christian&#x27;s which leads the former to die of old age due to rapid aging and later attacking the girls when they finally rebel against him only to be surprised when he discover the three Divas that he commanded have human emotions and all the five Divas sacrifice themselves in place of the girls. In the end, he returns the Pata-Pis back to their owners after he thanked Hibari for letting him made love in humanity once more.

===PataPi===
Cute cybernetic toys that are a hit in Japan among schoolgirls, PataPies are miniature robots that can be upgraded by purchasing better components and equipping it with special devices, like the Kame Hame Maki that can tell fortunes from horoscopes. Developed and propagated by Washu, the sole purpose of PataPies is to stimulate brain waves in girls so that they can synchronise with the Divas in the Primum Mobile, but the creator of the PataPi is Crane himself. Six PataPies are featured in the series:

;Densuke
:A PataPi that is given to Hibari by Crane himself, Densuke (nicknamed Denny) is a very ordinary PataPi whose sole purpose is to learn new things and entertain his companion. Actually, Densuke is more sensitive than the other PataPies, being able to detect Erinyes&#x27; descent and other things, making it a special PataPi. Densuke can also fly, but not for long.

;Francesca
:Full name being Francesca Leopard Classic Renoir Sanhasha the Third Junior (though nicknamed Franny), Francesca is Suzume&#x27;s favourite PataPi that is equipped with all the latest components available in the market. The remarkable components include a missile turret on the back that can shoot out a flurry of mini-missiles that actually explode on impact! Francesca also has a parachute and a built-in calculator.

;Tetsuro
:Tetsuro (nicknamed Tetsu) is Tsugumi&#x27;s martial arts PataPi. He is a powerful PataPi with considerable strength and agility. Well-versed in punches and kicks (probably picked up during Tsugumi&#x27;s martial arts lessons in her dojo), Tetsurō is the bodyguard of the PataPi Five. It also has built-in dual microphones and Tsugumi uses them when she starts singing songs of her idol Hatoko.

;Billiken
:Named after the goddess of fortune in Osaka, Billiken is an electronic piggy bank and calculator, mainly for finance. Kamome raised Billiken up such that she inherited her stingy and calculative personality. Billiken is a good salesperson, being able to sell takoyaki proficiently in the movie.

;Petit-Ange
:Meaning Little Angel, Petit-Ange is an exotic PataPi that is dark red in color and has two wings. As Tsubame&#x27;s playmate and companion, Petit-Ange is fanatically loyal to her and would protect her in times of danger. Petit-Ange can be a very cute PataPi when she starts sucking heads, or a very violent PataPi, like in episode 13 when she performed an uppercut on the PataPi Kero with her wing.

;Enoken
:Enoken is Uzura&#x27;s PataPi, who looks like a dog with two long flabby ears that can extend to form even longer ears like a rabbit. The scary thing about Enoken is that he appears in weird and unlikely situations and whenever there&#x27;s Enoken, Uzura may be hiding somewhere nearby. Enoken massages people with his ears. Enoken is named after the famous Japanese comedian Kenichi Enomoto; Enoken was actually his stage name.

<text>Kottige (also known as Megala Kottige) is a small village in the Holalkere town of Chitradurga State in Karnataka, India.

==Regional==

The total population of Kottige is less than 100. The village is bordered by Kabbala, Kelagina Kottige, Ugane Katte and Vaddara Hatti.

==Tourism==
The village is famous for nearby Huli Katte (Tigers used to visit this pool regularly, hence the name &#x27;Huli&#x27;), for its wildlife and the nearby picturesque hills. Hyenas and Wild Bears and wild boars frequently visit the village and nearby farms, in late evenings and nights. Untouched by the hands of human, the neighbouring hills provide a thrilling vista to the untamed beautiful fauna and flora of the Deccan Karnataka.

Visitors also flock the age old, Maari Gudi (Maari Shrine), which hosts Goddess Maari (of Maari Kanive) and attain the blessings of the Devi. During the village festival (Jaatre) held once in 12 years, Swaamana Kunita (Dance of &#x27;Swama&#x27;) provide a mindblowing perspective into the traditions and culture of ancient Dravidian Karnataka.

There is no bus route available into the village and the tourists have to get down at Ugane Katte Bus Stop or NG Halli Bus Stop between Hosadurga - Holalkere road and walk 4 miles through a dense irrigated area and coconut farms to reach the village.

<text>Esthesic (UK &quot;aesthesic&quot;) and poietic are terms used in semiotics, the study of signs, to describe perceptive and productive levels, processes, and analyses of symbolic forms. The corresponding terms for the processes are &quot;esthesis&quot; and &quot;poiesis&quot;.

Like &#x27;emic&#x27; and &#x27;etic&#x27;, both words appear to be derived from a suffix, &quot;-poietic&quot; (from &quot;creative&quot;) meaning productive or formative and &quot;-esthesic&quot; (from αἴσθησις &quot;sense&quot;) being receptive or perceptive, in relation to the neutral level. The neutral level is the &quot;trace&quot; left behind, the physical or material creation of esthesic and poietic processes.

Thus, for Jean-Jacques Nattiez, 

Nattiez&#x27;s diagram, following Jean Molino:

:(ibid.)

&quot;Esthesic&quot; also refers to the mental perception of any body part. &quot;-poesis&quot;/&quot;-poetics&quot; also refers to production.

<text>Poisonblack was a Finnish gothic metal band led by singer and guitarist Ville Laihiala.

== History ==
In 2003, the band&#x27;s first album, &quot;Escapexstacy&quot;, was on the Finnish national charts for three weeks, peaking at No. 21. They opened for Iron Maiden at the Hartwall Areena in Helsinki on 21 December 2003 for the Dance of Death World Tour.

Singer Juha-Pekka Leppäluoto left in the autumn of 2003 to concentrate on his work with Charon. Ville Laihiala, the band&#x27;s principal songwriter, assumed vocal duties and has since led Poisonblack out of the gothic genre of their first album and in a musical direction that closely mirrors that of his former band Sentenced.

In 2006, the band toured Europe with Lacuna Coil and their second album, &quot;Lust Stained Despair&quot;, reached No. 2 in Finland for one week.

In 2008, they released &quot;A Dead Heavy Day&quot; which hit the Finnish Album Chart in position 6. After this success, they toured Europe with Dark Tranquillity and Fear My Thoughts. In 2010, Poisonblack released &quot;Of Rust and Bones&quot;, their fourth album. The fifth album, &quot;Drive&quot;, was released in 2011 on Hype Records and the band&#x27;s latest album, &quot;Lyijy&quot;, was released in September 2013 by Warner Music Finland. The album reached No. 4 on the Finnish album chart.

On 23 August 2015, singer Ville Laihiala posted a statement that the band had broken up. The band played their final show at Oulu, Finland on August 21, 2015, with Leppäluoto joining their final shows.

Poisonblack reunited and performed some shows in 2023 for Escapexstacy&#x27;s 20th anniversary. All of the band&#x27;s members throughout their tenure reunited except Dahlgren and Kukkonen.

<doc id="1085092" wikidata="Q3178724" url="?curid=1085092" title="The Old Regime and the Revolution">
<text>L&#x27;Ancien Régime et la Révolution (1856) is a work by the French historian Alexis de Tocqueville translated in English as either The Old Regime and the Revolution or The Old Regime and the French Revolution. 

The book analyzes French society before the French Revolution, the &quot;Ancien Régime&quot;, and investigates the forces that caused the Revolution. It is one of the major early historical works on the French Revolution. In this book, de Tocqueville develops his main theory about the French Revolution, the theory of continuity, in which he states that even though the French tried to dissociate themselves from the past and from the autocratic old regime, they eventually reverted to a powerful central government.

==L&#x27;Ancien Régime and the French Revolution==
Tocqueville argued that the aim of the French Revolution (1789–1799), while demonstrably anti-clerical, was not so much to destroy the sovereignty of religious faith as to tear down all forms of the Ancien Régime, of which the established church was a foremost symbol, nor to create a state of permanent disorder. The revolution should be read, he maintained, primarily as a movement for political and social reform. Contrary to the views expressed by the participants in the Revolution themselves, there was an increase in neither the power nor the jurisdiction of the central authority. Instead, control of these forms was wrested from the monarchy and transferred in quick succession first to the People themselves and from there to a powerful autocracy. The Revolution never intended to change the whole nature of the traditional society. The chief permanent achievement of the French Revolution was the suppression of those political institutions, commonly described as feudal, which for many centuries had held unquestioned sway in most European countries. The Revolution set out to replace them with a new social and political order, based on the concepts of freedom and equality. In France, both before and after the Revolution, people relied on central authority instead of becoming economically or politically active themselves. By contrast, in the United States, political action permeated to even the lower levels of society. There, private individuals formed the basis of economic and political life, but, in France, the centre of political gravity resided in a chaotic bureaucracy answerable only to the monarchy form of government.

Another theme of the book is the complete dissociation between French social classes, called the Estates, of which there were three – the clergy, the nobility, and the common people. Although this dissociation arose from social divisions imposed by the feudal system, the gradual disintegration of that system after the Middle Ages resulted, paradoxically, in social dissociation becoming increasingly complete. Whereas the feudal lord had at least a partial symbiosis with his tenants, the post-feudal nobility became absentee landlords, left their ancestral estates in the hands of caretakers, and flocked to Versailles; the seat of the monarchy and central government. The nobility accordingly lost all connection with the rural poor (located mostly outside of Paris), while the growing middle class emulated the nobility. By the late 18th century, the separation of classes was complete, breeding the class hatred demonstrated in the Revolution.

<text>Anatoly Vladimirovich Lebedko ( ; ; born 27 June 1961) is a Belarusian politician and pro-democracy activist who is currently the head of the United Civic Party, an opposition party.

== Life ==
Born in the village of , then part of the Stoŭbtsy Raion within the Minsk Region of the Soviet Union&#x27;s Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic, Lebedko emerged in the 1990s as one of the leading critics of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, whom Lebedko, along with other opposition leaders and many western governments, considers a dictator.

Lebedko&#x27;s strident opposition to Lukashenka led to increasingly bitter confrontations with the Belarusian authorities through the late 1990s and into the 2000s. He was arrested numerous times for participating in unsanctioned protests and marches, including the 1999 Freedom March; was charged with libel against Lukashenko several times; and was beaten outside his home by masked men he alleges were connected to Lukashenko. Lebedko appears to have drawn particular ire for his relatively high visibility and frequent contact with groups outside Belarus, who Lukashenko accuses of meddling in Belarus&#x27;s internal affairs. In particular, one of Lebedko&#x27;s arrests came shortly after he had spoken on the floor of the United States Senate and at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in October 1999, prompting letters of protest from both bodies.

Following an October 2004 election, which combined a referendum on permitting Lukashenko a third term with parliamentary elections, Lebedko led slightly over a thousand opposition protestors into the streets of Minsk on 18-19 October. Lebedko and other opposition leaders charged that the elections were rigged, an accusation echoed by OSCE election monitors. During the second day of protests on October 19, Lebedko was arrested along with two other opposition leaders, Mikola Statkevich and Paval Sieviaryniets, as well as an Associated Press photographer who had been covering the protest. Lebedko&#x27;s supporters claim he was severely beaten by riot police following his arrest; he ended up in the hospital, reportedly with fractured skull, broken ribs and internal injuries.

At the Congress of Democratic Forces in October 2005, he lost by just a few votes to Alaksandar Milinkievič, who became (with Lebedko&#x27;s subsequent support) the opposition&#x27;s primary candidate in the 2006 Belarusian presidential election.

Currently, Lebedko functions as Representative for the Constitutional Reform and Parliamentary Cooperation in the office of Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya.

<text>&#x27; (provisional designation &#x27;) is a very eccentric, stony asteroid and near-Earth object, approximately 1 kilometer in diameter. It was discovered on 2 November 1989, by American astronomer couple Carolyn and Eugene Shoemaker and Canadian astronomer David Levy at the Palomar Observatory on Mount Palomar, California.

== Orbit and classification ==

It is a member of the Aten asteroid, a subgroup of near-Earth objects that are located in the zone of influence of Venus. It has frequent, relatively close encounters with the Earth, as its minimum orbit intersection distance (MOID) is 0.16 AU or about 23 million kilometers. It was the eighth Aten asteroid discovered. Since then the number of Atens has grown to about one thousand known bodies.

This asteroid orbits the Sun with a short orbital period at a distance of 0.3–1.2 AU once every 227 days. The body rotates every two and a half hours around its axis and has a notably high albedo of about 0.40. Its orbit is tilted by 29 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. With an exceptionally high eccentricity of 0.59, it was the most eccentric Aten asteroid known at the time of discovery, more eccentric than previously discovered Aten, 3753 Cruithne. Since then, more eccentric Atens – such as , with an eccentricity of 0.665 – have been discovered. Due to this elongated orbit, the Aten asteroid and near-Earth asteroid also classifies as Earth-crosser, Venus-crosser and Mercury-grazer.

1989 VA was the first asteroid discovered with such a small semi-major axis (0.728 AU, about the same as Venus), breaking 2100 Ra-Shalom&#x27;s distance record (0.832 AU), which had held for over a decade. It remained the asteroid with the smallest known semi-major axis for five years until the discovery of (0.683 AU), which was the first asteroid discovered closer to the Sun than Venus.

Being so close to Venus, it is also the first asteroid discovered within Venus&#x27; zone of influence. This means that it is close enough to Venus for the planet to capture into a co-orbital relationship. Though it is not a Venus co-orbital at the moment, it may become one in the future and may have been one in the past. Currently, the only known Venus co-orbitals are , Zoozve and (as of 18 March 2013). Of the seven known objects in Venus&#x27; zone of influence, is the largest at about 1,400 metres. All of these objects, like , have eccentric orbits that cross Mercury&#x27;s and Earth&#x27;s orbits as well.

The combination of a small semi-major axis and high eccentricity made the first Aten asteroid discovered to get closer to the Sun (0.295 AU) than Mercury ever does. 2340 Hathor (the second Aten discovered, in 1976) had the smallest perihelion (0.464 AU) earlier, which was about the same distance as Mercury&#x27;s aphelion (0.467 AU). It was not until (0.277 AU) was discovered that an Aten asteroid with a lower perihelion was found. &#x27;s eccentric orbit takes it out past the Earth, where it has encounters of about 0.15 to 0.20 AU about every 3 to 5 years around October–November. It was discovered during its 1989 encounter and was about 0.17 AU away at the time. Further observations were made in October 2002 and during the most recent close encounter in November 2007.

== Physical characteristics ==

In the SMASS taxonomy, is characterized as a Sq-subtype that fall into the broader class of stony S-type asteroids.

== Numbering and naming ==

This minor planet was numbered by the Minor Planet Center on 22 June 2005. As of 2018, it has not been named.

<doc id="1085111" wikidata="Q210077" url="?curid=1085111" title="Baptistery">
<text>In Christian architecture the baptistery or baptistry (Old French &quot;baptisterie&quot;; Latin &quot;baptisterium&quot;; Greek , &#x27;bathing-place, baptistery&#x27;, from , baptízein, &#x27;to baptize&#x27;) is the separate centrally planned structure surrounding the baptismal font. The baptistery may be incorporated within the body of a church or cathedral, and provided with an altar as a chapel. In the early Church, the catechumens were instructed and the sacrament of baptism was administered in the baptistery.

==Design==
The sacramental importance and sometimes architectural splendour of the baptistery reflect the historical importance of baptism to Christians. Beginning in the fourth century, baptisteries in Italy were often designed with an octagonal plan. The octagonal plan of the Lateran Baptistery, the first structure expressly built as a baptistery, provided a widely followed model. The baptistery might be twelve-sided, or even circular as at Pisa.

In a narthex or anteroom, the catechumens were instructed and made their confession of faith before baptism. The main interior space centered upon the baptismal font (&quot;piscina&quot;), in which those to be baptized were thrice immersed. Three steps led down to the floor of the font, and over it might be suspended a gold or silver dove. The iconography of frescos or mosaics on the walls were commonly of the scenes in the life of Saint John the Baptist. The font was at first always of stone, but latterly metals were often used.

The Lateran baptistery&#x27;s font was fed by a natural spring. When the site had been the palatial dwelling of the Laterani, before Constantine presented it to Bishop Miltiades, the spring formed the water source for the numerous occupants of the &quot;domus.&quot; As the requirements for Christian baptisteries expanded, Christianization of sacred pagan springs presented natural opportunities. Cassiodorus, in a letter written in AD 527, described a fair held at a former pagan shrine of Leucothea, in the still culturally Greek region of southern Italy. This shrine had been Christianized by converting it to a baptistery (&quot;Variae&quot; 8.33). There are also examples of the transition from miraculous springs to baptisteries from Gregory of Tours (died &quot;c.&quot; 594) and Maximus, bishop of Turin (died &quot;c.&quot; 466).

==History==
Baptisteries belong to a period of the church when great numbers of adult catechumens were baptized and immersion was the rule. They did not seem to be common before the emperors Gratian, Valentinian, and Theodosius made Christianity the state religion in the Edict of Thessalonica (i.e. before the 4th century). As early as the 6th century, the baptismal font was commonly built in the porch of the church, before it was moved into the church itself. After the 9th century, with infant baptism increasingly the rule, few baptisteries were built. Some of the older baptisteries were so large that there are accounts of councils and synods being held in them. They had to be large because a bishop in the early church would customarily baptize all the catechumens in his diocese and the rite was performed only three times a year, on certain holy days. Baptisteries were thus attached to the cathedral and not to the parish churches. In the Italian countryside a pieve was a church with a baptistery on which other churches without baptisteries depended.

During the months when no baptisms occurred, the baptistery doors were sealed with the bishop&#x27;s seal, a method of controlling the orthodoxy of all baptism in the diocese. Some baptisteries were divided into two parts to separate the sexes; or sometimes the church had two baptisteries, one for each sex. A fireplace was often provided to warm the neophytes after immersion.
Though baptisteries were forbidden to be used as burial-places by the Council of Auxerre (578), they were sometimes used as such. The Florentine Antipope John XXIII (d. 1419) was buried in the Florence Baptistery, facing Florence Cathedral, with great ceremony, and a large and sculpturally important tomb by Donatello and his partner. Many of the early archbishops of Canterbury in England were buried in the baptistery at Canterbury.

According to the records of early church councils, baptisteries were first built and used to correct what were considered the evils arising from the practice of private baptism. As soon as Christianity had expanded so that baptism became the rule, and as immersion of adults gave place to sprinkling of infants, the ancient baptisteries were no longer necessary. They are still in general use, however, in Florence and Pisa.
The Lateran Baptistery must be the earliest ecclesiastical building still in use. A large part of it remains as built by Constantine. The central area, with the basin of the font, is an octagon around which stand eight porphyry columns, with marble capitals and entablature of classical form. Outside these are an ambulatory and outer walls forming a larger octagon. Attached to one side, toward the Lateran basilica, is a porch with two noble porphyry columns and richly carved capitals, bases and entablatures.

The circular church of Santa Costanza, also of the 4th century, served as a baptistery and contained the tomb of the daughter of Constantine. This is a remarkably perfect structure with a central dome, columns, and mosaics of classical fashion. Two side niches contain the earliest known mosaics of distinctively Christian subjects. In one is represented Moses receiving the Old Law, in the other Christ delivers to Saint Peter the New Law charter, sealed with the XP monogram.

The earliest surviving structure that was used as a baptistery is the tomb-like baptistery at Dura-Europas. Another baptistery of the earliest times has been excavated at Aquileia. Ruins of baptisteries have also been found at Salona and in Crete. At Ravenna are two noted baptisteries, decorated with fine mosaics. One was built in the mid-5th century, and the other in the 6th. A large baptistery decorated with mosaics was built in the 6th century at Naples.

In the East, the metropolitan baptistery at Constantinople still stands at the side of the former patriarchal Church of Holy Wisdom. Many others, in Syria for example, were found in late 19th and early 20th-century archaeological research, as were some belonging to churches of North Africa. In France the most famous early baptistery is Baptistère Saint-Jean at Poitiers. Other early examples exist at Riez, Fréjus and Aix-en-Provence. In England, a detached baptistery is known to have been associated with Canterbury Cathedral.

===Revival in medieval Italy===
In most of Europe the early Christian practice of having a distinct baptistery building, useful when large numbers of adult catechumens were being instructed and then baptised in groups by immersion, had lapsed by the Late Middle Ages, when baptisms were normally of infants, and used sprinkling with holy water rather than immersion. Instead, smaller fonts were placed inside the church. But in north Italy separate baptisteries revived, probably largely as an expression of civic pride, placed beside the cathedral, and often with a separate campanile or bell-tower.

Among the more spectacular Romanesque and Gothic examples, the Florence Baptistery was built between 1059 and 1128, the Pisa Baptistery begun 1152 (replacing an older one) and completed in 1363, the Parma Baptistery was begun in 1196, Pistoia in 1303; all these have octagonal exteriors. The Siena Baptistery was begun in 1316, then left incomplete some decades later.

<text>Club Atlético Newell&#x27;s Old Boys () is an Argentine sports club based in Rosario, Santa Fe. The club was founded on 3 November 1903, and is named after Isaac Newell of the English county of Kent, one of the pioneers of Argentine football.

A founding member of Liga Rosarina de Football, the club affiliated to the Argentine Football Association (AFA) in 1939. Since then, Newell&#x27;s Old Boys have taken part in tournaments organised by the body. The club have won six Argentine Primera División championships plus three national cups throughout their history. Newell&#x27;s have also been twice Copa Libertadores runner-up (in 1988 and 1992).

The club&#x27;s football stadium is the Estadio Marcelo Bielsa, named after the team&#x27;s former player and manager Marcelo Bielsa (twice champion, and runner-up of one Copa Libertadores). Newell&#x27;s play the Rosario derby against Rosario Central, a club with whom they have a huge historical rivalry.

Newell&#x27;s are also notable for their youth divisions, being one of the clubs with most national titles in AFA&#x27;s youth tournaments. Players from the club&#x27;s youth who have represented Argentina at World Cups are Gabriel Batistuta, Éver Banega, Walter Samuel, Américo Gallego, Jorge Valdano, Gabriel Heinze, Roberto Sensini, Mauricio Pochettino, Lionel Scaloni and Maxi Rodríguez, among others. Lionel Messi also played in the club&#x27;s youth, but left at a young age to play for Barcelona to seek treatment for his growth hormone deficiency, while Diego Maradona played briefly for the first team in 1993.

Other sports practised at this club are basketball, boxing, field hockey, martial arts, roller skating, volleyball and American football.

==History==

===Origins===

Club Atlético Newell&#x27;s Old Boys was established on 3 November 1903. Claudio Newell was one of the founding members. Newell called teachers, pupils and alumni of the school his father had established to sign the act of foundation of the club. The name chosen paid tribute to Isaac Newell&#x27;s life. The first president was Víctor Heitz.

The name &quot;old boys&quot; refers to former pupils of a school. In fact, the players of the first football team were graduates of the school Isaac Newell had established, the &quot;Colegio Comercial Anglicano Argentino&quot;.

The colours of the club were taken from the Colegio Comercial Anglicano Argentino emblem (designed by Isaac Newell himself) that were red and black inspired in the colours of the flag of England and the Flag of the German Empire.

Newell&#x27;s Old Boys is often referred to as &quot;leprosos&quot; (&quot;lepers&quot;). The club got its nickname, the lepers, after playing in a charity match for a leprosy clinic in the 1920s.

===Liga Rosarina (1905–1930)===

On 30 March 1905, the Liga Rosarina de Football (Rosarian Football League) was established, following a proposal by Newell&#x27;s president Heitz, who invited representatives of Rosario Athletic, Rosario Central and Atlético Argentino for that purpose. The main objective was to organise a championship, so a trophy was donated by the intendant of Rosario, Santiago Pinasco. The trophy was later named in his honour. Newell&#x27;s was the winner of the first edition, having won eight games and finishing unbeaten. The team also scored 39 goals, conceding just 4.

Previously, the historic first Rosarino derby had been held. Newell&#x27;s won 1–0 with a goal scored by Faustino González. The next year Newell&#x27;s won its second championship.

In 1907, the Liga Rosarina established a second division. The Copa Santiago Pinasco tournament moved to that division and &quot;Copa Nicasio Vila&quot; (named in honour of then mayor of Rosario) was created to be played by the first division teams. Newell&#x27;s won the first edition of this trophy, which they won a total 9 times between 1907 and 1930.

The Copa de Honor Municipalidad de Buenos Aires allowed teams from Buenos Aires and Rosario to take part in the competition. Newell&#x27;s won the 1911 edition defeating Porteño 3–2 at the final. Other trophy were teams of both cities played together was the Copa Dr. Carlos Ibarguren, won by Newell&#x27;s in 1921, defeating Huracán by 3–0.

===The arrival to Primera División===

In 1939, Newell&#x27;s asked the Argentine Football Association to play in the Primera División championship. The AFA accepted the request, so Newell&#x27;s played its first tournament in 1939, along with Rosario Central which was also added to the competition. Despite playing in the national tournaments, Newell&#x27;s continued participating in the regional leagues of Rosario, but with youth amateur players. Newell&#x27;s debuted in the AFA tournaments on 19 March 1939, defeating San Lorenzo by 2–1. The line-up was: Heredia; Gilli, Soneyro; Sisniega, Perucca, Reynoso; Belén, Fabrini, Gómez, Franco, Sánchez.

===National titles===
Newell&#x27;s Old Boys have won the Primera División championship six times (1974 Metropolitano, 1987–88, 1990–91, 1992 Clausura, Apertura 2004 and 2013 Final) and were the runners-up of the Copa Libertadores de América twice (1988 and 1992). The 1990–91 championship was contested between the 1990 Apertura (Newell&#x27;s) and 1991 Clausura (Boca Juniors) champions, which Newell&#x27;s won in home-and-away matches. Even though the 1990 Apertura was not considered official by itself, it is considered by Newell&#x27;s supporters to be their &quot;seventh&quot; championship.

Newell&#x27;s also won a friendly youth mini-tournament called the Little World Cup in 1988, against River Plate, Milan, Juventus, Real Madrid and Manchester United, and is, together with Boca Juniors, San Lorenzo and Racing Club one of the few Argentine clubs that made a long and successful tour in Europe (in 1949), in which they defeated several important teams such as Valencia, Borussia Mönchengladbach, Real Madrid and the Spanish National &quot;A&quot; Team. These are the only major international achievements of the club until now (although several minor international summer tournaments were won, with the 1943 Copa de Oro Rioplatense standing up). So far the club has not won an official international championship.

Newell&#x27;s Old Boys is one of a very few teams to have had all their players represent the national team in a single game, when they represented Argentina in a Pre-Olympic Tournament with their undefeated reserve team. It finished third in America, after Brazil and Uruguay.

The team has also contributed a great number of players to the Argentina national team, and exported many players to Europe&#x27;s top leagues, mostly to Italy and Spain. Among its great players were Gabriel Batistuta, Abel Balbo, Jorge Valdano, Américo Gallego, Mario Zanabria, Gustavo Dezotti, Roberto Sensini, Walter Samuel, Mauricio Pochettino, René Pontoni, Gerardo Martino, Ángel Perucca and several more. It has recently produced Argentine internationals Gabriel Heinze, Maxi Rodríguez and Lionel Messi.

The club&#x27;s president is Dr Ignacio Astore, a former team doctor, who was elected in September 2021.

=== Colors and badge ===

The origins of Newell&#x27;s Old Boys colors can be traced to the 19th century, when Isaac Newell founded the &quot;Colegio Comercial Anglicano Argentino&quot; in 1884. The school&#x27;s coat of arms had four panels, each depicting a different element, such as Mercury wings, a lamp (representing wisdom), the flag of the United Kingdom, and the flag of Argentina.

The black and red colors used in the coat were extracted from the flags of England (where Newell was born) and the German Empire (country of origin of his wife, Anna Jockinsen).

The red and black colors would be also adopted by the club as its colors. The first NOB emblem was designed by Ernesto Edwards, and (with few variations) has remained since then.

==Stadium==

The Newell&#x27;s Old Boys stadium has been in the Parque Independencia neighborhood of Rosario since 1911, and is commonly called &quot;El Coloso del Parque&quot; (the Colossus of the Independence Park). The capacity was increased from 31,000 to 42,000 in 1997. On 22 December 2009 the stadium was renamed after Marcelo Bielsa, in honour of the former player and coach of the team.

<doc id="1085116" wikidata="Q6046201" url="?curid=1085116" title="Interest on Lawyers' Trust Accounts">
<text>Interest on Lawyers&#x27; Trust Accounts (IOLTA) is a method of raising money for charitable purposes, primarily the provision of civil legal services to indigent persons, through the use of interest earned on certain lawyer trust accounts. The establishment of IOLTA in the United States followed changes to federal banking laws passed by Congress in 1980 which allowed some checking accounts to bear interest. The Florida Bar Foundation launched the first American IOLTA program in 1981. Today, every state, the District of Columbia and the U.S. Virgin Islands operate IOLTA programs.

==How it works==

Attorneys routinely receive client funds (commonly referred to as &quot;trust money&quot;) to be held in trust for future use. If the amount is large or the funds are to be held for a long period of time, the attorney customarily places these funds in an interest-bearing account for the benefit of the client. However, in the case of amounts that are small or are to be held for a short time, it is impractical for the attorney to establish a separate account for each client since the cost of establishing and administering the account would exceed any interest generated, and result in a net loss for the client. Prior to IOLTA, these nominal and short-term funds were combined and placed into a pooled, non-interest-bearing checking account. The reason the accounts were non-interest-bearing is that prior to 1981, commercial banks were prohibited by federal law from paying interest on demand deposits (e.g. checking accounts). In addition, the lawyer could not earn interest on the account because it is unethical for attorneys to derive any financial benefit from funds that belong to their clients.

With the inception of IOLTA, lawyers who handle nominal or short-term client funds that cannot earn net interest for the client place these funds in pooled, &quot;interest-bearing accounts&quot;, and the interest earned on these accounts is remitted to the state IOLTA program for charitable purposes. Nearly all IOLTA programs in the United States use IOLTA revenue to provide grants to organizations for the purpose of providing legal aid in civil matters to low-income residents; many also use IOLTA revenue for grants to help improve the administration of justice in their states.

Proper management of a lawyer&#x27;s IOLTA (also commonly referred to as a &quot;trust account&quot;) is highly regulated by each respective state bar. As a practical matter proper management of a lawyer&#x27;s IOLTA or trust account is a key management skill in the operation of a law office which is based on principles of double-entry bookkeeping, with certain additional safeguards designed to enhance the audit trail in the event a lawyer becomes unable or otherwise unwilling to cooperate with bar auditors or an inventory attorney to account for handling of client property. It is incumbent on the owner of a law firm to undertake adequate training for the responsibilities of managing an IOLTA client property trust account. Effective management of client property trust account is required for compliance with bar rules and the efficient and profitable operation of the law firm. States typically require MCLE (Minimum Continuing Legal Education) providers to be accredited by the state&#x27;s court system.

==History==
IOLTA programs were first established in Australia and Canada in the late 1960s to generate funds for legal services to the poor and other charitable purposes. In the U.S., IOLTA programs are state-specific, and operate under their own rules and regulations. Most of the U.S. IOLTA programs have been created by Court Rule, while several have been established through state legislatures. In many states the IOLTA program is administered by the charitable arm of the state bar association, whereas some states have created other entities to operate the IOLTA program. IOLTA revenue has become a major source of funding for civil legal services in the United States. It is also, however, an unpredictable revenue stream because IOLTA income is entirely dependent on the current interest rate environment and economic conditions.

==Legality==
Explicitly, IOLTA applies only to funds that are &quot;nominal in amount or held for a short period of time&quot;. So larger amounts of money held for single clients are exempt from the IOLTA program. That means, typically, that client funds eligible for IOLTA involve small amounts of money held for a long time, or significant amounts of money held for a short time. As was the case prior to IOLTA, lawyers must exercise their discretion in determining whether a given client’s trust deposit is of sufficient size or will be held for sufficient duration to justify the cost of being individually invested for a client.

Since IOLTA’s inception, a number of court cases have arisen in which parties argued that IOLTA programs violated the Fifth Amendment by resulting in an unconstitutional taking. This argument was put to rest by the Supreme Court of the United States when it upheld the constitutionality of IOLTA in &quot;Brown v. Legal Foundation of Washington&quot;, reasoning that there is no &quot;taking&quot; of client money, because the money being held on behalf of the individual client would not have generated any net interest for the client.

==Canadian practices==
Over a 15-year period, starting in 1971, law foundations were founded in every Canadian province. For the most part they were all founded with a mandate to support the following five areas:
* Legal aid
* Legal education
* Legal research
* Law reform
* Law libraries
In some instances the provincial legislation and/or regulations which direct the foundations also prescribe specific funding formulas which are applied to the five mandates.
