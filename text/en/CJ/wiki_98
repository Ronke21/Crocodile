<text>Under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives,  represents the wheel arrangement of two leading wheels on one axle, usually in a leading truck, eight powered and coupled driving wheels on four axles and two trailing wheels on one axle, usually in a trailing truck. This configuration of steam locomotive is most often referred to as a Mikado, frequently shortened to Mike.

It was also at times referred to on some railroads in the United States as the McAdoo Mikado and, during World War II, the MacArthur.

The notation 2-8-2T indicates a tank locomotive of this wheel arrangement, the &quot;T&quot; suffix indicating a locomotive on which the water is carried in tanks mounted on the engine rather than in an attached tender.
==Overview==
The 2-8-2 wheel arrangement allowed the locomotive&#x27;s firebox to be placed behind instead of above the driving wheels, thereby allowing a larger firebox that could be both wide and deep. This supported a greater rate of combustion and thus a greater capacity for steam generation, allowing for more power at higher speeds. Allied with the larger driving wheel diameter which was possible when they did not impinge on the firebox, it meant that the 2-8-2 was capable of higher speeds than a with a heavy train. These locomotives did not suffer from the imbalance of reciprocating parts as much as did the 2-6-2 or the , because the center of gravity was between the second and third drivers instead of above the centre driver.

The first 2-8-2 locomotive was built in 1884. It was originally named &quot;Calumet&quot; by Angus Sinclair, in reference to the engines built for the Chicago &amp; Calumet Terminal Railway (C&amp;CT). However, this name did not take hold.

The wheel arrangement name &quot;Mikado&quot; originated from a group of Japanese type 9700 2-8-2 locomotives that were built by Baldwin Locomotive Works for the gauge Nippon Railway of Japan in 1897. In the 19th century, the Emperor of Japan was often referred to as &quot;the Mikado&quot; in English. The Gilbert and Sullivan opera, &quot;The Mikado&quot;, set in Japan, had premiered in 1885 and achieved great popularity in both Britain and America.

The 2-8-2 was one of the more common configurations in the first half of the 20th century, before dieselisation. Between 1917 and 1944, nearly 2,200 of this type were constructed by Baldwin, the American Locomotive Company (ALCO) and the Lima Locomotive Works, based on designs by the United States Railroad Administration (USRA). It was also known as the &quot;McAdoo Mikado&quot; in the United States, after William Gibbs McAdoo who was appointed as Director General of Railroads when the United States commenced hostilities during the latter part of the First World War and the USRA was established. Of all of the USRA designs, the Mikado proved to be the most popular. The total American production was about 14,000, of which 9,500 were for local customers and the rest exported.

&quot;Mikado&quot; remained the type name until the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. Seeking a more American name, &quot;MacArthur&quot;, after General Douglas MacArthur, came into use to describe the locomotive type in the United States. After the war, the type name &quot;Mikado&quot; again became the most common for that locomotive type.

==Usage==
Locomotives of this wheel arrangement saw service on all six populated continents. The 2-8-2 type was particularly popular in North America, but was also used extensively in Continental Europe and elsewhere.

===Argentina===
==== broad gauge====
The Buenos Aires and Pacific Railway bought eighteen 2-8-2T locomotives in three batches of six as their class 701 class. The first two batches came from North British Locomotive Company in 1908 and 1912, the third from Henschel &amp; Son in 1913.

The BA&amp;P also bought eight 2-8-2 tender locomotives from Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company in 1928 as their 3001 class.

The Central Argentine Railway (FCCA) bought fifteen 2-8-2T locomotives as their class C7 in 1912; they were built by Robert Stephenson &amp; Company with works numbers 3506 to 3520.

The FCCA also bought sixty 2-8-2 locomotives: twenty class CS8A from Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company in 1926, and another twenty in 1928 from Robert Stephenson &amp; Company. The final twenty to class CS9A were supplied by Vulcan Foundry in 1930. Both classes were cross-compound locomotives with one high-pressure cylinder with a bore of and one low-pressure cylinder with a bore of , with a stroke of . The earlier class had coupled wheels with a diameter of , whereas on the later class they were .

====Standard gauge====
The East Argentine Railway bought four 2-8-2 locomotives from Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1924. As class X they were numbered 70 to 74; they became General Urquiza Railway 701 to 704 in the 1948 nationalisation. Baldwin had classified them as 12-30--E.

==== gauge====
The Province of Buenos Aires Railway bought a single 2-8-2 locomotive from Hanomag of Germany in 1910. Numbered 251 and classified as class E, it was the only 2-8-2 on that railway&#x27;s system.

The Central Northern Railway (FCCN) bought seven classes of 2-8-2 locomotives totalling 134 locomotives. The first 100 were all bought in 1911: Fifteen from Borsig (class C7, numbered 700–714), 25 from Henschel &amp; Sohn (class C8, 715–739), 10 from Hanomag (class C9, 740–749) and 50 from North British Locomotive (class C10, 750–799). The next 25 came from Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1920; they were Baldwin class 12-30--E, 55 to 79, FCCN class C11, numbered 7000–7024. The last nine new locomotives were built by Henschel between 1928 and 1930 (class C13, numbers 7025–7033, and class C13A, number 7034). In addition the FCCN rebuilt 20 4-8-0 locomotives of classes C6 and C7 into 2-8-2s between 1938 and 1940.

The Córdoba Central Railway (FCCC) bought 31 locomotives in four classes. The first was a solitary locomotive, numbered 800, class C6A built by Alco&#x27;s Brooks Works in 1910. It was nearly a decade before they bought any more with a dozen class C9A locomotives, numbered 1451 to 1462, coming from Montreal Locomotive Works, half in 1919 and half in 1920. MLW delivered another 15 Mikados later that same year; as class C10A they were numbered 1463 to 1477. FCCC&#x27;s final three came from Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1925, they were Baldwin class 12-26--E; FCCC numbered them 1501 to 1503, class C11A. When the FCCC was taken over by the FCCN in 1939, their new owner changed the classification by adding 20 to the FCCC&#x27;s old classification; the locomotives kept their old numbers, except for FCCC 800 which became FCCN 1400.

==== gauge====
On the Ferrocarriles Patagónicos, 75 locomotives were bought in 1922. Fifty were built by Henschel &amp; Sohn, numbered 101 to 150 and class 75H; 25 were built by Baldwin, numbered 1 to 25, class 75B with Baldwin classifying then as 12-18--E.

===Australia===

One of the world&#x27;s first 2-8-2T designs was the South Maitland Railways 10 Class, first delivered in 1911, by Beyer-Peacock, and spasmodically continuing delivery until 1925, then totaling 14 in the class.

The requirement for locomotives that could be converted from to without major re-engineering led to the introduction of Mikado locomotives by the Victorian Railways (VR) in the 1920s. Whereas previous 2-8-0 Consolidation type locomotives featured long, narrow fireboxes between the frames that made gauge conversion impractical, the N class light lines and X class heavy goods locomotives both featured wide fireboxes positioned behind the coupled wheels and above the frames.

The South Australian Railways (SAR) employed four distinct classes of 2-8-2 locomotive, the locally designed 700 and 710 class, the 740 class that was originally built for China by Clyde Engineering and purchased by the SAR after the order was cancelled in the wake of the Chinese Communist Revolution, and the 750 class, a group of ten surplus VR N class locomotives.

To assist with the postwar rebuilding of Australian railways, American-designed Mikado locomotives were also introduced after the Second World War, such as the Baldwin-built New South Wales Government Railways (NSWGR) D59 class and the Queensland Rail (QR) AC16 class.

A Mikado was also the last new class of mainline steam locomotive to be introduced in Australia, the V class heavy freight locomotive of the Western Australian Government Railways (WAGR) of 1955.

===Austria===
The 4-cylinder compound class 470, developed in 1914 by Karl Gölsdorf, was built for express trains on mountain lines. From 1927, some of these locomotives were rebuilt to two-cylinder superheated steam locomotives and designated class 670. They were reclassified to class 39 from 1938 and remained in service until 1957.

===Belgian Congo===

In 1917, 24 Mikado type steam locomotives were built for the Compagnie du chemin de fer du bas-Congo au Katanga (BCK), a new line from the Northern Rhodesian border to Port Francqui in the Belgian Congo. Since the line was just being completed at the time, the full complement of locomotives were not required immediately and four, possibly six, of them were temporarily leased to the South African Railways to alleviate a wartime shortage of locomotives. In South Africa, they were known as the Katanga Mikado. Six more of these engines were leased to the Beira and Mashonaland and Rhodesia Railways (BMR), which operated between Umtali in Southern Rhodesia and Beira in Mozambique. The locomotives were all forwarded to the Belgian Congo after the war, where they were numbered in the BCK range from 201 to 224.

===Canada===
Canadian National (CN) operated a few Mikado locomotives:
* One locomotive in the R-1 class, number 3000.
* Thirty locomotives in the R-2 class, numbered 300 to 329.
* Several locomotives in the S-1 and S-4 classes, numbered in the range between 3200-3524 and 3198-3199 and 3525-3599 and 3700-3757 and 3800-3805 .

Canadian Pacific (CP) used Mikado locomotives for passenger and freight trains throughout Canada. Most worked in the Rocky Mountains, where the standard 4-6-2 Pacifics and 4-6-4 Hudsons could not provide enough traction to handle the steep mountain grades.

The Temiskaming &amp; Northern Ontario (renamed Ontario Northland Railway in 1946) operated seventeen Mikados, all ordered from Canadian Locomotive Company in three batches, the first six in 1916, second batch of four in 1921, and the final seven in 1923 to 1925. They were scrapped between 1955 and 1957 when the Ontario Northland was completely dieselized, except for three wrecked and scrapped in the 1940s. The Temiskaming &amp; Northern Ontario operated its Mikados on both freight and passenger service, and were fitted with smoke deflectors. In 1946 65 out of 199 Canadian Pacific N2 2-8-0&#x27;s were rebuilt and converted to Class P1n 2-8-2&#x27;s . However all were scrapped around 1955 and 1958 . No P1n 2-8-2&#x27;s were preserved however CP no . 5468 is preserved

CP&#x27;s no. 5468, on display in Revelstoke, British Columbia. And CP&#x27;s 5361 a Class P2e is preserved Depew New York.

===China===

Some local industries still actively use Mikados on freight service. The last regular Mikado passenger service was ended on 20 November 2015 in Baiyin. A few Chinese-made locomotives have found their way into the United States, including Class SY no. 3025, built in 1989, which operated as New Haven no. 3025, in honor of Class J1 no. 3001-3024, on the Valley Railroad in Connecticut. The locomotive now operates on the Belvidere &amp; Delaware as no. 142. It is original to the New York, Susquehanna &amp; Western Railway as no. 142. It and two other Chinese 2-8-2s are currently in the United States.

===Finland===

Finland&#x27;s sixteen gauge Class Pr1 were 2-8-2T passenger locomotives for use on local trains. They were nicknamed &quot;Paikku&quot;, which means local. The Class Pr1 was operational from 1924 to 1972. Numbered 761 to 776, they were built by Hanomag in Germany and also by Finnish locomotive builders Tampella and Lokomo. The last one, no. 776, is preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum.

The Finnish Class Tr1 (or R1) tender locomotive was built by Tampella, Lokomo and German locomotive builders Arnold Jung from 1940 and remained in service until 1975. They were numbered from 1030 to 1096 and were nicknamed &quot;Risto&quot;, after Finnish President Risto Ryti. 1030, 1033, 1037, 1047, 1051, 1055, 1057, 1060, 1067, 1071, 1074, 1077, 1082, 1087, 1088, 1092, 1093, 1094, 1095 and 1096 are preserved

===France===
France used a fairly large number of 2-8-2s in both tender and tank configurations, designated 141 class from the French classification system of wheel arrangements.

====Tender locomotives====
Of the pre-nationalisation railway companies that existed before the formation of the SNCF, the Chemins de fer de Paris à Lyon et à la Méditerranée (PLM) had the most Mikados. Their first twelve were initially numbered from 1001 to 1012 and later renumbered to 141.A.1 to 141.A.12. The PLM&#x27;s second series, numbered from 1013 to 1129 and later renumbered 141.B.1 to 141.B.117, were built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in the United States. Their third and largest class was numbered from 141.C.1 to 141.C.680. Of these latter locomotives, those fitted with feedwater heaters bore the class letter D. The PLM also rebuilt forty-four 141.C and 141.D class locomotives to 141.E class. The SNCF modified the PLM numbers by adding the regional prefix digit &quot;5&quot;.

The PLM&#x27;s 141.A class Mikados were copied by the Chemins de fer du Nord, who had fifty, numbered from 4.1101 to 4.1150, which became 2-141.A.1 to 2-141.A.50 on the SNCF.

The Chemins de fer de l&#x27;État also had a class of 250 Mikados, numbered from 141-001 to 141-250. These later became the 141.B class on the SNCF and were renumbered 3-141.B.1 to 3-141.B.250. After modifications, the 141.B class locomotives became the 141.C class, as well as one 141.D class (no. 141.D.136) and one 141.E class (no. 141.E.113). No. has been preserved and designated a Monument historique.
The most powerful French Mikado was the SNCF 141.P class. At about , these engines were among the most efficient steam locomotives in the world, thanks to their compound design. They could burn 30% less fuel and use 40% less water than their 141.R class counterparts, but could not compete when it came to reliability. Every locomotive of this 318-strong class has been scrapped.
The most numerous steam locomotive class France had, was the American and Canadian-built 141.R class. Of the 1,340 locomotives ordered, however, only 1,323 entered service since sixteen engines were lost at sea during a storm off the coast of Newfoundland while being shipped to France, while one more was lost in Marseille harbour. They were praised for being easy to maintain and proved to be very reliable, which may account for the fact that they remained in service until the very end of the steam era in 1975. Twelve of these locomotives have been preserved.

====Tank locomotives====
The Chemins de fer d&#x27;Alsace et de Lorraine had a class of forty 2-8-2T locomotives, the T 14 class, later numbered SNCF to . They were identical to Germany&#x27;s Prussian T 14 class locomotive and were built between 1914 and 1918. (Also see Germany)

The Chemins de fer de l&#x27;Est had two Mikado classes. The first was numbered from 4401 to 4512, later renumbered 141.401 to 141.512 and finally SNCF 1-141.TB.401 to 1-141.TB.512. The other was numbered from 141.701 to 141.742 and later SNCF 1-141.TC.701 to 1-141.TC.742.

The Chemin de Fer du Nord also had two 2-8-2T classes. The first, consisting of only two locomotives, was numbered 4.1201 and 4.1202, later renumbered 4.1701 and 4.1702 and finally SNCF 2-141.TB.1 and 2-141.TB.2. The second, with 72 locomotives, was numbered from 4.1201 to 4.1272 and later SNCF 2-141.TC.1 to 2-141.TC.72.

The Chemins de Fer de l&#x27;État also had two Mikado classes. The first, numbered from to, later became the SNCF 141.TC class and were renumbered 3-141.TC.1 to 3-141.TC.20. The second, numbered from to , later became the SNCF 141TD class and were renumbered to . They were copies of the series of the &quot;Chemins de fer de l&#x27;Est&quot;.

The Compagnie du chemin de fer de Paris à Orléans (PO) also had two classes. The first was numbered from 5301 to 5490 and later SNCF to . The second was numbered from 5616 to 5740 and later 4-SNCF to .

===Germany===
German 2-8-2 tender locomotives were built in both passenger and freight versions.
* An Express-service locomotive was the DRG Class 19 „Sachsenstolz“ (Pride of Saxony), developed by the Royal Saxon State Railways as type XX formula_1formula_2 (Roman Numeral 20; superheated steam (H); compound (V)) to provide express service in the Saxonian Bohemian Massif.
* The passenger locomotive was the DRG Class 39, initially the Class P 10 of the Prussian state railways, which was built for hauling heavy express trains in the hilly and mountainous terrain of the &quot;Mittelgebirge&quot;. When they were assimilated into the Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft (DRG), they were designated as DRG Class 39.

* Although going out of production when the DRB consolidated their production into 2-10-0 1&#x27;E DRB Class 52 Kriegslok designs, the DRB Class 41 „Ochsenlok“ (Oxen Loco) was a successful 1&#x27;D1 2-8-2 freight locomotive also used for commuter trains. They were operated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRB) and were built from 1937 to 1941, gaining notoriety as the German steam locomotive with the highest efficiency η of 10%.

Both standard gauge and narrow gauge 1D1 2-8-2 tank locomotive classes were used in Germany.
* The DRG Class 93.0-4 was a German 2-8-2T goods train tank locomotive that was used by the Prussian state railways as well as the French Chemins de fer d&#x27;Alsace et de Lorraine, designated as Class T14 by both railways. The Prussian locomotives were later incorporated by the Deutsche Reichsbahn and designated Class 93.0-4 under the DRG renumbering plan. Altogether 457 locomotives of this class were built for the Prussian state railways between 1914 and 1918. (Also see France - Tank locomotives)
* The DRG Class 86 was a standard goods train tank locomotive of the DRG. It was intended for duties on branch lines and was manufactured by almost all the locomotive building firms producing for the DRG. From 1942, a simplified wartime version was built, on which the most obvious changes were the omission of the second side windows in the cab and the solid disc carrying wheels.
* The Molli railway (&quot;Mollibahn&quot;), a narrow-gauge steam-powered railway in Mecklenburg running on gauge track, operates three 2-8-2T locomotives built by Orenstein &amp; Koppel in 1932.

===India===
====Broad gauge====
On the gauge, the Class XD was the first 2-8-2 in India to be built in quantity. Introduced in 1927, 78 were built before the Second World War by Vulcan Foundry, North British Locomotive Company (NBL), Armstrong Whitworth and Škoda Works. Production resumed after the war, and 110 were built by NBL in 1945 and 1946, while Vulcan Foundry built the last six in 1948.
There was also a Class XE that was built by William Beardmore &amp; Company and Vulcan Foundry. Wartime designs included the Class AWD and Class AWE, built by American company Baldwin Locomotive Works, and the Class X-Dominion (later Class CWD) built as part of Canada&#x27;s Mutual Aid program by two Canadian companies, the Canadian Locomotive Company and Montreal Locomotive Works.
After the war, a new design was produced and placed in production in 1950. The Class WG was the main post-war broad gauge freight locomotive type of the Indian Railways (IR). The first order of 200 was split evenly between NBL and Chittaranjan Locomotive Works (CLW). Apart from Indian manufacture, examples were also built in England, Scotland, Germany, Austria, the United States, Japan and Italy. By the time production ceased in 1970, 2,450 Class WG locomotives had been built.

====Metre gauge====
After World War I, an Indian Railway Standards (IRS) 2-8-2 class became the main heavy freight locomotive on the . While two versions were designed, the Class YD with a 10-ton axle load and the Class YE with a 12-ton axle load, none was built of the latter class.

During World War II, many of the war-time United States Army Transportation Corps class S118 locomotives were sent to India and 33 more were ordered after the war.

The post World War II Mikado design was the Class YG, of which 1,074 were built between 1949 and 1972, with nearly half of them being manufactured in India.

====Narrow gauges====
Two narrow track gauges were in use in India. The gauge was the more widely used while the gauge was used by the Darjeeling Himalayan Railway and the Scindia State Railway. Mikado type locomotives were used by the following:
* The Bengal Nagpur Railway used a saturated steam B class, a superheated BS class, and a BC class comprising B class locomotives that had been converted from saturated to superheated.
* The Barsi Light Railway used an F class of thirteen locomotives, ten built by Nasmyth, Wilson &amp; Company between 1926 and 1929, and three built by Hunslet Engine Company in 1949.
* The Great Indian Peninsula Railway used a B/1 class of seven locomotives, four built by NBL in 1917, one more by NBL in 1922, and two by Nasmyth, Wilson &amp; Company in 1926.
* The Scindia State Railway used sixteen locomotives of five classes, the Classes NH/1 through NH/5, built between 1914 and 1959.

The standard narrow gauge 2-8-2 locomotive was the ZE class, with 65 engines built by five companies between 1928 and 1954. Nasmyth, Wilson built ten in 1928, Hanomag built sixteen in 1931, Corpet-Louvet built twelve in 1950, KraussMaffei built fifteen in 1952 and another ten in 1954, and Kawasaki Heavy Industries built ten in 1954. In 1957 and 1958, six ZD class locomotives were also built by Nippon Sharyo in Japan.

===Indonesia===

Before 1945, the Dutch East Indies Railway Administration, &quot;Staatspoorwegen&quot; (SS), received two types of locomotives with a 2-8-2 wheel arrangement. First, they received 10 units of 1,050 mm gauge of SS Class 1500 tender engine of 1920 from Hartmann that was previously intended for the Hejaz Railway, but later diverted to Java prior to the First World War and the drive wheels were adjusted to 1,067 mm gauge. After delivered, they present a difficulty. Their axle weigh 13 tons which way much heavier than weight permitted on bridges and mountainous lines (11 tons). Hence for safety reason, the SS 1500s were only allowed to haul light freight trains on flat lines. Second, they received 24 units of 2-8-2T from Hanomag and Werkspoor later classified as SS Class 1400 in 1921-22 which were the tank version of the 2-8-0 SS Class 900 (DKA D50). The SS Class 1400 initially was intended to be heavyweight shunter, but due to Great Depression, the SS had to preserve some of their large locomotives. So, the SS 1400s were used to haul express trains on the Bogor–Sukabumi line. 

This decision was made by the top brass of SS that the SS 1400s were also tough, have power output to 1171 hp. In addition, SS Class 1400 also has compact characteristic, so it was suitable to work on mountainous line. After Japanese occupation and Indonesian Independence both locomotives renumbered to D51 (SS 1500) and D14 (SS 1400) based on Japanese numberings. During the 1970s report, one of D51 (D5101) was sighted at Klakah depot at Lumajang, East Java while most of her sisters were found normally worked on Surabaya–Kroya southern line. Out of 10 units, only D51 06 preserved at Ambarawa Railway Museum. In 1970, the population of D14 locomotives continued to dwindle as they were replaced by the presence of diesel locomotives, and from 24 units only D14 10 of Hanomag is preserved. Previously, D14 10 was a static display at Taman Mini Indonesia Indah before it was brought to Pengok Workshop to conserved it and converted from oil to wood burner. Finally successfully restored in November 2019 and used today to haul excursion train in Surakarta, Central Java beside Rob&#x27;s C12 18 named &quot;Sepur Kluthuk Jaladara&quot;.

After Indonesian Independence in 1945, the government of Indonesia nationalized all of the Dutch-owned railway companies, including the SS whose name was later changed to &quot;Djawatan Kereta Api&quot; (DKA) or the Department Railway of the Republic of Indonesia. Shortly after, by 1951-1952 the DKA bought 100 brand new of Mikado steam locomotives from Krupp, Germany. These locomotives, designated the D52 type, were the most modern steam locomotive in Indonesia at that time, with a large physical appearance and equipped with electric lighting. It was similar to the Class 41 locomotive of the Deutsche Reichsbahn.

In Java, the D52 locomotives were placed in passenger service, but was occasionally also used as freight locomotives. Some people even idolized the D52 because of its loyalty in taking passengers anywhere, as happened on the Rapih Dhoho Train from Madiun to Kertosono. The D52 was a mainstay for this train until the end of steam operation in Indonesia.

In contrast to the Java-based units, Sumatra-based D52 locomotives were used for hauling freight trains, mainly coal trains from the Tanjung Enim coal mine, now owned by the PT Bukit Asam mining company, to the coal dumping sites at Kertapati and Tarahan.

The D52 locomotives were initially coal-fired but, from mid-1956, 28 locomotives, numbers D52002 to D52029, were converted to oil burners. The work was done in stages over five years by the locomotive repair shop at Madiun.

One locomotive from this class was written off from service near Linggapura station after a boiler explosion that killed its driver, as a result of steam pipe failure. The only one of the original 100 locomotives that survived into the 21st century is D52 number D52099, which is on display at the Transport Museum in Taman Mini Indonesia Indah. Later on, the D52099 was moved to Purwosari station along with D14 10 which was successfully restored to action, but the D52099 still remained at the station and awaiting for another restoration.

===Italy===
Italian railways relied primarily on 2-6-2s for fast passenger services, while heavy passenger service was assigned to 2-8-0s of the classes 744 and 745. Although Mikado types had little opportunity for development in Italy, Ferrovie dello Stato Italiane (FS) commissioned the class 746 for heavy passenger service on the Adriatic route. To serve local branches and mountain lines where tank locomotives were more suitable, FS derived the new class 940 from the 2-8-0 class 740, with the same dimensions but adding a rear Bissel truck to support the coal bunker behind the cab to make it a 2-8-2.

===Japan===

The Japanese Government Railways (JGR) built the Class D50, Class D51, and Class D52 Mikado tender locomotives for use on the gauge lines on the Japanese mainland and in its former colonies. (Also see Soviet Union.) Among those, the D51 was the most popular with a total of 1,115 units produced, the most of any single class of locomotive in Japan. A few of the D51s remain in operation for excursion services, with many preserved nationwide.

===New Zealand===
Only one 2-8-2 locomotive ever operated on New Zealand&#x27;s national rail network, and it was not even ordered by the New Zealand Railways Department, who ran almost the entire network. The locomotive was ordered in 1901 from Baldwin Locomotive Works by the Wellington &amp; Manawatu Railway Company (WMR) for use on their main line&#x27;s steep section between Wellington and Paekakariki. It entered service on 10 June 1902 as the WMR&#x27;s no. 17. At the time, it was the most powerful locomotive in New Zealand and successfully performed its intended tasks.

When the WMR was incorporated into the national network in 1908, the Railways Department reclassified no. 17 as the solitary member of the BC class, no. BC 463, and the locomotive continued to operate on the Wellington-Paekakariki line until it was withdrawn on 31 March 1927.

===Philippines===

According to Iowa State University professor Jonathan Smith, the Mikado was the most popular wheel arrangement of freight-purpose tender locomotives on the Manila Railroad. 67 units of the wheel class were delivered between 1927 and 1951, distributed into 4 classes.

The first 2-8-2 steam locomotive was the Baldwin-built Manila Railroad 250 class introduced in 1928. It was the freight version of the 4-6-2 &quot;Pacific&quot;-type 140 class built for passenger rail services in Luzon. More classes were ordered after the war. The United States Army Transportation Corps class S118, locally referred to as the Manila Railroad 800 class &quot;USA&quot; in which 45 units were ordered in 1944. These were numbered 851 to 895, with three named locomotives have been named: No. 865 Huckleberry Finn, No. 866 Tom Sawyer and No. 867 &quot;Hanibella&quot;. Two more locomotives were ordered in 1948 from the War Assets Administration and were numbered the 630 class. These were locally assembled at the MRR workshop in Caloocan. Lastly, 10 JNR Class D51 locomotives were ordered from Nippon Sharyo in 1951 and were numbered the 300 class according to the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen.

All of these locomotives were decommissioned in 1956 and were scrapped afterwards.

===Poland===

Between 1932 and 1939, Polish industry supplied PKP with 98 Mikados of class Pt31 of own design (further 12 were built under German occupation). After World War II additional 180 of improved class Pt47 were built until 1951. Both classes were used to run heavy (600 ton) long-distance passenger trains on main lines. They were the most powerful passenger locomotives in Poland. Their wheel diameter was 1.85 m, power output 2000 hp and speed 110 km/h.

191 TKt48 2-8-2 tank locomotives were delivered to PKP between 1950 and 1957, with additional two built for the industry and six exported to Albania. They were used on suburban passenger trains and on goods trains in lower mountain areas.

===South Africa===
Only six Mikado locomotive classes saw service in South Africa, five on Cape gauge and one on narrow gauge. The type was rare, with only two of these classes built in quantity.

====Cape gauge====

During 1887, designs for a 2-8-2 Mikado type tank-and-tender locomotive were prepared by the Natal Government Railways. The single locomotive was built in the Durban workshops and entered service in 1888, named &quot;Havelock&quot;, but was soon rebuilt to a Pacific configuration. The engine &quot;Havelock&quot; was the first locomotive to be designed and built in South Africa and also the first to have eight-coupled wheels.

In 1903, the Cape Government Railways (CGR) placed two Cape Class 9 2-8-2 locomotives in service, designed by H.M. Beatty, Locomotive Superintendent of the CGR from 1896 to 1910, and built by Kitson &amp; Company. They had bar frames, Stephenson&#x27;s link motion valve gear and used saturated steam. In comparison with the Cape Class 8 2-8-0 locomotive of 1901, however, it was found that their maintenance costs were much higher without any advantage in terms of efficiency. As a result, no more of the type were ordered. In 1912, when these locomotives were assimilated into the South African Railways (SAR), they were classified as Class Experimental 4.
In 1904, the Central South African Railways (CSAR) placed 36 Class 11 Mikados in service. Built by the North British Locomotive Company (NBL), it was designed by P.A. Hyde, Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the CSAR from 1902 to 1904, for goods train service on the Witwatersrand. It was superheated, with a Belpaire firebox, Walschaerts valve gear and plate frame. The Class 11 designation was retained when the CSAR was amalgamated into the SAR in 1912.
In 1906, the CGR placed a single experimental 2-8-2 in service, designed by H.M. Beatty and built by Kitson. It was a larger version of the Cape Class 9 in all respects, also with a bar frame, Stephenson&#x27;s link motion valve gear and using saturated steam. The locomotive was not classified and was simply referred to as &quot;the Mikado&quot;. On the CGR it was exceeded in size only by the Kitson-Meyer 0-6-0+0-6-0 of 1904. At the time, it was considered as a big advance in motive power, but the design was never repeated and the Cape Mikado remained unique. In 1912, it was classified as Class Experimental 5 on the SAR.

In 1917, the South African Railways placed at least four, possibly six, Mikado type steam locomotives in service. They had been built for the &quot;Chemins de Fer du Bas Congo á Katanga&quot; in the Belgian Congo and were obtained on temporary lease, to alleviate the critical shortage of locomotives as a result of the First World War&#x27;s disruption of locomotive production in Europe and the United Kingdom. The Katanga Mikados, as the locomotives were known on the SAR, were all forwarded to the Belgian Congo after the war. 

====Narrow gauge====

Between 1931 and 1958, 21 narrow gauge Class NG15 Mikados, developed from the Class Hd and Class NG5 of South West Africa (SWA), were acquired for the Otavi Railway in SWA. Designed by the SAR, it was built by Henschel &amp; Son and Société Franco-Belge. A major improvement on the earlier locomotives was the use of a Krauss-Helmholtz bogie, with the leading pair of driving wheels linked to the leading pony truck. The leading driving wheels had a limited amount of side play while the axle still remained parallel to the other three driving axles at all times, thus allowing the locomotive to negotiate sharper curves than its two predecessors. When the SWA narrow gauge line was regauged to Cape gauge in 1960, all these locomotives were transferred to the Eastern Cape for further service on the Langkloof narrow gauge line from Port Elizabeth to Avontuur. Here they were nicknamed the &quot;Kalahari&quot;. Victorias Milling Co. 2H is a Henschel built 0-8-0T dated 1927.

===South West Africa (Namibia)===
Two very similar Mikado classes saw service on the narrow gauge Otavi Railway in South West Africa (SWA).
In 1912, the German administration in Deutsch-Südwest-Afrika acquired three locomotives for use on the line from Swakopmund to Karibib. They were built by Henschel &amp; Son and were designated Class Hd. The locomotives were superheated, with Heusinger valve gear, piston valves and outside plate frames. Since they did not have separate bogie trucks, the leading and trailing carrying wheels were arranged as radial axles to allow for sideways motion of the wheels with respect to the locomotive frame. After the First World War, they were taken onto the roster of the South African Railways (SAR) and later reclassified as Class NG5 along with the similar locomotives of 1922.

In 1922, the SAR placed six Class NG5 locomotives in service on the Otavi branch in SWA, also built by Henschel. They were built to the same design as the Class Hd, but had a different coupled wheel suspension arrangement, different boilers and slide valves. In service, they were operated in a common pool with the Class Hd locomotives until they were all withdrawn from service when the SWA system was regauged to Cape gauge in 1960.

===Soviet Union===

At the end of the Second World War, several gauge Japanese Class D51 locomotives were left behind on Russia&#x27;s Sakhalin island, formerly Karafuto, by retreating Japanese forces. In addition, two Class D51 wrecks were abandoned to the north of the city. Until 1979, the serviceable Japanese locomotives were used on the island by the Soviet Railways.

One was then plinthed outside the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk railway station, and another is still in running condition and is kept at the Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk railway station.

The Sakhalin Railway has a connection with the mainland via a train ferry operating between Kholmsk on the island and Vanino on the mainland. The Japanese gauge still remains in use on the island, although in 2004 conversion began to the Russian gauge. (Also see Japan)

===Spain===
The network of Spain used one Mikado tank locomotive and two versions of tender locomotives.

The Spanish manufacturer MTM delivered six 2-8-2T locomotives to the Madrid-Caceres-Portugal line in 1925. A project at MTM in 1942 to build a big 2-8-2 never realised.

The first tender version was built by two American companies in 1917, fifteen by Brooks Locomotive Works and forty by Schenectady Locomotive Works. They were numbered from 4501 to 4555 and were a slightly smaller version of the USRA Light Mikado. The locomotives served well in the Norte system, where they were nicknamed &quot;Chalecos&quot;.
In 1953, RENFE (acronym of &quot;Red Nacional de los Ferrocarriles Españoles&quot;), the nationalised railway company, acquired twenty-five locomotives of the second tender version from North British Locomotive Company (NBL) of Glasgow. Spanish builders MTM, MACOSA and Euskalduna and the American Babcock &amp; Wilcox built 213 more between 1953 and 1960, with only minor detail differences such as double chimneys, Llubera sanders, ACFI feedwater heaters and oil-burning. Their empty weight was and they had diameter coupled wheels. They performed well in both freight and passenger service and lasted until the official end of steam in common service in 1975.

One Norte and eighteen RENFE locomotives are preserved, three of them in good working condition.

===Thailand (Siam)===

The first Mikado locomotives of the Royal State Railways of Siam (RSR), the predecessor of the State Railway of Thailand (SRT), were acquired from 1923 as standard locomotives for express and mixed trains, to supersede the E-Class locomotives which had been commissioned between 1915 and 1921. The first Siamese Mikado class was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1923, Nasmyth, Wilson &amp; Company in 1924 and Batignolles-Châtillon, France in 1925.

However, it was not until the first batch of eight of Thailand&#x27;s second class of 2-8-2 locomotives, numbers 351 to 358, was imported from Japan in 1936 that Mikado locomotives really became successful in Thailand. The RSR imported more Mikado standard locomotives to meet railways as well as military demands between 1938 and 1945.

After the Second World War, in 1946, the RSR imported fifty used United States Army Transportation Corps class S118 locomotives, the so-called MacArthur Locomotives. Another eighteen new engines of the same Class were purchased around 1948-1949 to meet the post-war demand.

The last type of Mikado steam locomotives for Thailand were seventy engines imported by SRT from Japan between 1949 and 1951, numbered 901 to 970. Of these, only Mikado no. 953 is still serviceable, and runs passenger trains on special occasions.

===United Kingdom===
The 2-8-2 wheel arrangement was rarely, but successfully, used on British rails. Nigel Gresley of the London &amp; North Eastern Railway (LNER) designed two Mikado types of note:
* The Class P1 was a freight derivative of his famed Class A1 4-6-2, inspired by the Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s twin K4s 4-6-2 and L1s 2-8-2 locomotives. Two were built, but there was never really much call for their ability and they remained under-utilised throughout their short existence.
* Gresley&#x27;s other class of Mikados was his Class P2. These were express passenger locomotives, rather more inspired by European influences than American. They were built to haul heavy express trains in hilly terrain north of Edinburgh, where Gresley thought the additional adhesion possible with a 2-8-2 might serve well. Unfortunately, poor self-centering on the leading truck meant that the leading driving wheels wore against the rails on tighter curves, being hard on both track and wheels. Gresley&#x27;s successor Edward Thompson converted the Class P2s into 4-6-2 Pacifics. In June 2014, a new Class P2 Mikado locomotive, 2007 &quot;The Prince of Wales&quot;, intended to work both on mainline and preserved railways, was under construction by the P2 Steam Locomotive Company.

The Great Western Railway (GWR) operated a class of 54 2-8-2T engines that had been rebuilt from 2-8-0T locomotives by Charles Collett, chief mechanical engineer of the GWR. As early as 1906, the chief mechanical engineer at the time, George Churchward, planned a class of Mikado tank engines to handle heavy coal trains in South Wales. The plan was abandoned, however, as it was feared they would be unable to handle the sharp curves present on Welsh mineral branches. Instead, Churchward designed the 4200 Class of 2-8-0 tank engines, of which nearly 200 were built.
In the 1930s, coal traffic declined with the result that many of these engines stood idle, since their limited operating range prevented them from being allocated to other mainline duties. Collett, as Churchward&#x27;s successor, decided to rebuild some of the 4200 Class engines as 2-8-2Ts. The addition of a trailing axle increased the engine&#x27;s operating range by allowing an increased coal and water storage capacity. Altogether 54 locomotives were modified in this manner. The 7200 Class tank engines, as they were known, remained in service until the end of steam in Britain in the early 1960s.

The designer of the BR Standard Class 9F locomotive as well as the rest of the BR standard classes as Chief Mechanical Engineer of British Railways, Robert Riddles, originally designed the aforementioned locomotive to be a 2-8-2 using the boiler from one of the 4-6-2 passenger locomotive standard classes. However, he later decided to use a 2-10-0 wheel arrangement with a new boiler design, as it offered more tractive effort and better weight distribution.

===United States===

The 2-8-2 saw great success in the United States, mostly as a freight locomotive. In the 1910s it largely replaced the 2-8-0 Consolidation as the main heavy freight locomotive type. Its tractive effort was similar to that of the best 2-8-0s, but a developing requirement for higher speed freight trains drove the shift to the 2-8-2 wheel arrangement.
The Mikado type was, in turn, ousted from the top-flight trains by larger freight locomotive wheel arrangements such as the 2-8-4, 2-10-2, 2-10-4 and articulated locomotives, but no successor type became ubiquitous and the Mike remained the most common road freight locomotive with most railroads until the end of steam. More than 14,000 were built in the United States, about 9,500 of these for North American service, constituting about one-fifth of all locomotives in service there at the time. The heaviest Mikados were the Great Northern&#x27;s class O-8, with an axle load of .

Almost all North American railroads rostered the type, notable exceptions being the Richmond, Fredericksburg &amp; Potomac, the Boston &amp; Maine, the Delaware &amp; Hudson, the Western Maryland, the Cotton Belt and the Norfolk &amp; Western. The largest users included the New York Central with 715 locomotives, the Baltimore &amp; Ohio with 610, the Pennsylvania Railroad with 579, the Illinois Central with 565, the Milwaukee Road with 500, the Southern with 435, and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy with 388.

A number of North American 2-8-2s have been preserved as either static display pieces, or steam excursion stars. These include Baltimore and Ohio 4500, Nickel Plate Road 587, Grand Trunk Western 4070, Southern Railway 4501, Grand Canyon Railway 4960, Spokane, Portland and Seattle 539, Southern Pacific 745, Tremont and Gulf 30, Duluth and Northern Minnesota 14, Soo Line 1003, McCloud Railway 18, McCloud Railway 19, Denver and Rio Grande Western 463, Pennsylvania Railroad 520, and California Western 45.

===Yugoslavia===
Borsig built 2-8-2s were delivered to the railway of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1930. These became the JDZ class 06, of which a few remain in the former Yugoslav nations.

<text>Andrew Lippa (born December 22, 1964) is an American composer, lyricist, book writer, performer, and producer. He is a resident artist at the Ars Nova Theater in New York City.

==Early life==
Lippa was born in Leeds, England, to English parents. He emigrated to the United States in October 1967 and grew up in Oak Park, Michigan, a suburb of Detroit. Lippa attended Oak Park High School and later the University of Michigan, where he studied vocal performance but eventually transferred into music education and received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in music education. After graduating from college, Lippa moved to New York City in 1987 and became a middle school music teacher at Columbia Grammar and Prep School (CGPS) on the Upper West Side. He was promoted his second year at CGPS to dean of 7th and 8th grade students – an assistant principal position – and held that post, in addition to teaching music, until June 1991. 
In 1988 Lippa was accepted into the celebrated BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theatre Workshop as a composer. There he met his future collaborator Tom Greenwald (&quot;John &amp; Jen&quot;). He later pursued a career in musical composition.

==Musical theatre career==
Lippa began his professional theatrical career at the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam, Connecticut. He was hired in early 1992 to be the pianist for a production of &quot;It&#x27;s a Bird... It&#x27;s a Plane... It&#x27;s Superman&quot; but quickly rose to become the dance arranger and assistant music director. He then stayed on for the remainder of the season in that capacity. Following the Goodspeed, Lippa worked at various theatres as music director and/or pianist in addition to being an increasingly in-demand arranger.

The Goodspeed produced Lippa’s first musical, &quot;John &amp; Jen&quot; (book by Tom Greenwald), in 1993 at the Norma Terris Theatre in Chester, Connecticut. That production was followed by a workshop production the following year at the Berkshire Theatre Festival and, ultimately, a nearly 6-month run at Lamb&#x27;s Theatre in New York City. The show was produced by Carolyn Rossi Copeland.

Lippa then went on to write the book, music, and lyrics for &quot;The Wild Party&quot;. He began work in 1996, and the Manhattan Theatre Club presented a reading of the first act later that year. Julia Murney, who later played the lead role of Queenie, was in the ensemble of that reading. &quot;The Wild Party&quot; had a two-week development at the Eugene O&#x27;Neill Theater Center in Connecticut in the summer of 1997. Following that period, producers Jeffrey Seller and Kevin McCollum optioned the play and, with the Manhattan Theater Club, made plans for production. &quot;The Wild Party&quot; was given its world premiere in 2000 at the Off-Broadway Manhattan Theatre Club in New York City. &quot;The Wild Party&quot; won the Outer Critics Circle Award for best Off-Broadway musical of the season, and Lippa won the 2000 Drama Desk Award for best music. The show was nominated for 13 Drama Desk Awards — the most of any show that year — including best new musical.

In 1999, Lippa contributed three new songs to the Broadway version of &quot;You&#x27;re a Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; and created all new arrangements. The three songs were &quot;My New Philosophy&quot; (to be sung by Kristin Chenoweth), “Beethoven Day”, and the new version of the title song. Lippa also produced the original cast recording and was honored with a Grammy Award nomination for his work on that recording.

In 2001, Lippa joined Brian Crawley to create a musical adaptation of &quot;A Little Princess&quot;. The show premiered in the summer of 2004 at TheatreWorks in Palo Alto, California. The recording was released on September 13, 2011, on Ghostlight Records. Texas State University&#x27;s musical theatre department, under the direction of actress Kaitlin Hopkins, presented a revised version of the show in concert with Lippa conducting October 16–19. Following that production, Music Theatre International made the title available for license to theatres all over the world.

In 2006, the musical &quot;Asphalt Beach&quot;, with music and lyrics by Lippa and the book by T. C. Smith and Peter Spears, premiered at the American Music Theatre Project at Northwestern University. After producing &quot;Asphalt Beach&quot;, Stuart Oken asked Lippa to write the music and lyrics for &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (book by Marshall Brickman and Rick Elice). Lippa was honored with a Tony Award nomination (Best Original Score) and two Drama Desk nominations (Outstanding Music and Outstanding Lyrics) for his work on &quot;The Addams Family&quot;. &quot;The Addams Family&quot; starred Nathan Lane and Bebe Neuwirth, broke attendance records in Chicago during its 2009 try-out, and by its closing on December 31, 2011, had played 725 regular performances and 34 previews at the Lunt-Fontanne Theatre on Broadway. The US national tour began in New Orleans in September, 2011. International productions included São Paulo (March–December 2012), Sweden (September 2012–May 2013), and Sydney, Australia (March–June 2013). The Broadway cast recording was released on Decca Broadway, and vocal selections are available from Hal Leonard.

Lippa wrote the music and lyrics for &quot;Big Fish&quot;, a musical based on the 2003 film and the 1998 novel. The show, with a book by John August, premiered in Chicago, Illinois, at the Oriental Theatre from April 2013 through May 5, 2013. It opened on Broadway at the Neil Simon Theatre on October 6, 2013, following previews that began on September 5, 2013. Susan Stroman directed and choreographed, with scenic design by Julian Crouch, costume design by William Ivey Long, and lighting design by Donald Holder. Norbert Leo Butz starred as Edward Bloom with Kate Baldwin as Sandra and Bobby Steggert as Will. &quot;Big Fish&quot; brought Lippa a Drama Desk Award nomination for Outstanding Music.

==Additional work==
In 1998, Lippa was commissioned by the Jewish Federation of Greater Vancouver to create an anthem for a concert celebrating Israel&#x27;s 50th birthday, to be sung by 350 singers and conducted by Sergiu Comissiona of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra.

As a singer, Lippa has performed at Carnegie Hall, Town Hall, The Rainbow Room, and The Supper Club. His vocal arrangements and singing can be heard in the songs of Stephen Schwartz in the animated feature &quot;The Prince of Egypt&quot;.

He has acted as Kristin Chenoweth&#x27;s music director since 1999 and has conducted and played Chenoweth&#x27;s concerts at the Metropolitan Opera House (January 2007), the San Francisco Symphony (2005), Carnegie Hall (2004), and the Donmar Warehouse (2002), among others. Lippa wrote the music to the &quot;Intervention Song&quot; for Chenoweth&#x27;s funnyordie.com video.

For Halloween weekend, 2011, the Harrisburg Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Stuart Malina premiered &quot;The Addams Family Casket of Orchestral Grotesqueries&quot;, a symphonic suite from Lippa&#x27;s musical &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, arranged by Lippa and Larry Hochman and orchestrated by Hochman. That same weekend the New Mexico Gay Men’s Chorus, under the direction of Aaron Howe, premiered Lippa’s “Move Toward The Darkness” from &quot;The Addams Family&quot; in a new choral arrangement by Lippa’s frequent collaborator Mary-Mitchell Campbell.

A show called &quot;Jerry Christmas&quot;, with music and lyrics by Lippa and book by Daniel Goldfarb, was produced by New York Stage and Film in 2007 but has since been shelved.

Lippa wrote the music and lyrics for &quot;The Man in the Ceiling&quot;, a musical based on Jules Feiffer&#x27;s children&#x27;s book of the same name, with book by Feiffer. The show, originally developed by Disney Theatrical and Tom Schumacher, had two readings in 2008 but didn&#x27;t have its first full production until 2017, when it opened at the Bay Street Theater in Sag Harbor, New York. Ghostlight Records released the cast recording, featuring Gavin Creel and Kate Baldwin, on April 18, 2019.

In 2012, the San Francisco Gay Men&#x27;s Chorus and several other gay men&#x27;s choruses commissioned Lippa to write a musical tribute to the life and legacy of Harvey Milk. The resulting 60-minute oratorio, entitled &quot;I Am Harvey Milk&quot; and starring Lippa as Harvey Milk, premiered at San Francisco&#x27;s Nourse Theater on June 26, 2013—the same day on which the U.S. Supreme Court declared Section 3 of DOMA and California Proposition 8 unconstitutional.

In November 2013, Lippa made his London debut with two concert performances at the St. James Theatre, London. Produced by James Yeoburn and Stuart Matthew Price of United Theatrical, the concert featured guest performances from Ashleigh Gray, Carrie Hope Fletcher, Jenna Russell, Tam Mutu, and Willemijn Verkaik. The concert exclusively previewed music from Lippa&#x27;s latest Broadway musical &quot;Big Fish&quot; as well as a host of his other works, including &quot;I am Harvey Milk&quot;, &quot;The Addams Family&quot;, and &quot;The Man in the Ceiling&quot;.

&quot;The Life of the Party: A Celebration of the Songs of Andrew Lippa&quot; premiered at London&#x27;s Menier Chocolate Factory in May 2014. The musical revue, performed by Lippa, Caroline O’Connor, Damian Humbley, and Summer Strallen, featured songs from Lippa&#x27;s Broadway, Off-Broadway, and unproduced shows. &quot;The Life of the Party&quot; had its American debut in August 2016 at TheatreWorks Silicon Valley.

Recordings include Julia Murney’s CD &quot;I’m Not Waiting&quot; (producer, 3 songs), &quot;The Wild Party&quot; (RCA Victor) which he also produced, &quot;You’re A Good Man, Charlie Brown&quot; (RCA Victor) which earned him a Grammy Award nomination, &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (Decca Broadway), &quot;A Little Princess&quot; (Ghostlight), &quot;I Am Harvey Milk&quot; (A Cappella), and &quot;john &amp; jen&quot; (Ghostlight) which he associate produced.

Hal Leonard also released &quot;The Andrew Lippa Song Book&quot; in Fall 2011.

==Personal life==
Lippa married film marketing executive David Bloch in July 2008 in Los Angeles, California, shortly after that state&#x27;s supreme court handed down a ruling permitting marriage of same-sex couples. They had been dating since they met through a mutual friend in 1998 seeing William Finn&#x27;s &quot;A New Brain&quot;.

Lippa moved to Columbus, Ohio in 2017.

<text>Wendy Venturini (born January 30, 1979) is an American reporter for the Performance Racing Network (PRN). She works as broadcaster for NASCAR Cup Series races and sometimes as a pit reporter for races on PRN. She had been a pit reporter in the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series, and reporter for NASCAR RaceDay. Venturini was born in Chicago, Illinois, and is a 2000 graduate of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.

In 2007, Venturini was one of the commentators for DirecTV&#x27;s NASCAR Hot Pass coverage, making her the first female play-by-play announcer in auto racing history.

On August 29, 2014, Venturini was announced as the anchor for the 2014 Sylvania 300 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series race for Performance Racing Network, becoming the first woman to serve such a position.

She is the daughter of two-time Automobile Racing Club of America (ARCA) Champion and multi-car owner Bill Venturini. Her older brother, Billy Venturini, is also an owner on the ARCA circuit.

==Personal life==
She was previously married to Jarrad Egert who serves as engine track support for Toyota Racing Development. They had their first child, Caleb James, on December 22, 2010.

On June 23, 2018, Venturini was struck by a vehicle while exercising near Sonoma Raceway in Northern California. She was transported to Marin General Hospital in Marin, California, where she was admitted to the intensive care unit. Doctors later diagnosed her with a skull fracture. Venturini returned to broadcasting in August of that same year.

<doc id="1115490" wikidata="Q49131" url="?curid=1115490" title="Freedom Trail">
<text>The Freedom Trail is a path through Boston that passes by 16 locations significant to the history of the United States. It winds from Boston Common in downtown Boston, to the Old North Church in the North End and the Bunker Hill Monument in Charlestown. Stops along the trail include simple explanatory ground markers, graveyards, notable churches and buildings, and a historic naval frigate. Most of the sites are free or suggest donations, although the Old South Meeting House, the Old State House, and the Paul Revere House charge admission. The Freedom Trail is overseen by the City of Boston&#x27;s Freedom Trail Commission and is supported in part by grants from various non-profit organizations and foundations, private philanthropy, and Boston National Historical Park.

The Freedom Trail was conceived by journalist William Schofield in 1951, who suggested building a pedestrian trail to link important landmarks. Boston mayor John Hynes decided to put Schofield&#x27;s idea into action. By 1953, 40,000 people were walking the trail annually.

The National Park Service operates a visitor center on the first floor of Faneuil Hall, where they offer tours, provide free maps of the Freedom Trail and other historic sites, and sell books about Boston and United States history.

Some observers have noted the tendency of the Freedom Trail&#x27;s narrative frame to omit certain historical locations, such as the sites of the Boston Tea Party and the Liberty Tree.

==Official trail sites==
The official trail sites are (generally from south-to-north):
# Boston Common
# Massachusetts State House
# Park Street Church
# Granary Burying Ground
# King&#x27;s Chapel and King&#x27;s Chapel Burying Ground
# Boston Latin School Site/Statue of Benjamin Franklin
# Old Corner Bookstore
# Old South Meeting House
# Old State House
# Boston Massacre Site
# Faneuil Hall
# Paul Revere House
# Old North Church
# Copp&#x27;s Hill Burying Ground
# Bunker Hill Monument
Notes: The Black Heritage Trail crosses the Freedom Trail between the Massachusetts State House and Park Street Church. The Boston Irish Famine Memorial is also located along the Freedom Trail, between the Old Corner Bookstore and the Old South Meeting House. The New England Holocaust Memorial is located a few steps off the Freedom Trail, just north of Faneuil Hall.

==In popular culture==
The Freedom Trail is a significant plot point in the 2015 video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot;, helping the player to find the Railroad faction&#x27;s headquarters.

<doc id="1115491" wikidata="Q3619861" url="?curid=1115491" title="Slide (footwear)">
<text>Slides or sliders are a type of light shoe that is characterized by having a loose heel that holds on to the foot from the front. Like flip-flops, they are typically employed in casual situations, in addition to being unisex footwear worn by both sexes. Sliders are distinguished from flip-flops by their vamp strap which does not separate the big toe from the rest of the toes.

==Description==
Slides can be high-heeled, flat-heeled or somewhere in between, and may cover nearly the entire foot from ankle to toe, or may have only one or two narrow straps. They usually include a single strap or a sequence of straps across the toes and the lower half of the foot to hold the shoe on the foot. The term is descriptive in that this shoe is easy to &#x27;slide&#x27; on and off the foot when the wearer wants to do so. Slides do not have a Y-shaped strap, like the flip-flop. They generally consist of a sole and a simple upper strap, the latter having the purpose of keeping them attached to the foot. Their uppers can be smooth and continuous or have fasteners, such as buckles or Velcro. Unlike slippers and mules, which are closed at the front, slide shoes are never closed at the front, they leave the toes visible and in the open air. 

They can be made with any type of material, from leather to fabric, from natural fibers to synthetic materials. They are mainly used at the beach or at the swimming pool. Slides are still designed to be light and comfortable, and to make the foot breathe easier when it&#x27;s hot, just like flip flops.

==Health==
Flat slides are problematic as they provide no arch support and little cushioning, leading to the foot arch collapsing over time. This pulls the Achilles tendon, potentially causing shin splints, heel and/or arch pain, or tendinitis. Slides typically aren&#x27;t designed with a front and back end, which forces the wearer&#x27;s toes to grip harder to keep the footwear in place, causing foot pain, and with more frequent usage it could change the toe&#x27;s natural shape and growth, leading to hammertoes. These issues can be solved by wearing slides with a higher heel height, and more secure straps.

== History ==
Slides can be traced back to Ancient Rome. They are often thought to come from as far back as Ancient Egypt or Ancient Greece, but there is a lack of documentation to further prove that. The popularity of slides in the United States started in the late 1960s, when vibrant, colorful aesthetics, such as cherry flower motifs, were followed. Across the world in Germany, the brand Birkenstock created the first fitness slide, a simple design made from contoured cork with a single-buckled leather strap. Another German company, Adidas, invented the well-known Adilette pool slide.

== Fashion ==
High fashion designers such as Prada, Nike, Gucci, Burberry, Walk London and Marc Jacobs have included them in their collections. The different designs and ideas that come from the designers are expansive. Crafting slides from premium grade leathers and suedes, feathers to using floral patterns, faux-fur lining and regal pearls being attached or used as the main design behind slides.

<doc id="1115500" wikidata="Q3544193" url="?curid=1115500" title="USS Seahorse (SS-304)">
<text>USS &quot;Seahorse&quot; (SS-304), a submarine, was the first submarine and second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the seahorse, a small fish whose head and the fore part of its body suggest the head and neck of a horse.

&quot;Seahorse&quot; was laid down on 1 August 1942 by the Mare Island Navy Yard, Vallejo, California. The vessel was launched on 9 January 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Chester C. Smith, and commissioned on 31 March 1943.

== First war patrol, August – September 1943 ==

Following shakedown along the California coast, &quot;Seahorse&quot; sailed to Pearl Harbor, Territory of Hawaii and, on 3 August 1943, got underway for her maiden war patrol, conducted off the Palau Islands. On the morning of 29 August, while the submarine was gaining attack position on a Japanese convoy, she was detected by escorting destroyers and suffered minor damage from a depth charge attack.

&quot;Seahorse&quot; scored three torpedo hits on a transport on 6 September, and then went deep to evade a depth charge attack that caused severe leaks and put her number four torpedo tube out of commission. A week later, she expended eight torpedoes in an unsuccessful attempt to sink a large tanker. The submarine terminated her first patrol at Midway on 27 September.

During this patrol, &quot;Seahorse&quot;″s commanding officer ignored several potential targets, rather than face sonar-equipped escorts, which unrealistic prewar training indicated was virtual suicide.

== Second war patrol, October – December 1943 ==

Following refit, &quot;Seahorse&quot; sailed on 20 October for her second war patrol with her new skipper, Slade Cutter, the executive officer of the first patrol. Between 29 October and 31 October, the submarine sank three enemy trawlers in surface actions and then commenced a two-day attack on a 17-ship convoy. Early on the morning of 2 November, following an attack on the convoy by another United States submarine, &quot;Seahorse&quot; evaded three escort ships and launched three torpedoes into two freighters. Four hours later, she again attacked, sending three torpedoes toward a tanker and another spread at a third freighter. Flames burst from each target as two Japanese destroyers turned toward &quot;Seahorse&quot; but too late to catch the rapidly departing submarine. Sunk in this action were the 7,089-ton cargo ship &quot;Chihaya Maru&quot;, and the 5,859-ton cargo ship, &quot;Ume Maru&quot;. &quot;Seahorse&quot; later closed again on the convoy but was driven down by depth charges and departed the vicinity.

On 22 November, &quot;Seahorse&quot; maneuvered past three enemy escorts, launched four torpedoes from periscope depth, and sank the cargo ship, &quot;Daishu Maru&quot;. On 26 November, the submarine contacted another enemy convoy and began to close the range. Determined to mount an attack before the targets entered the mined Tsushima Strait, the submarine launched four torpedoes at long range quickly sinking a cargo ship; and then, dodging enemy escorts, let go four stern shots at a second target. The results seemed disappointing—until a sudden blast sent flames and debris mushrooming high into the air, completely destroying the 7,309-ton tanker, &quot;San Ramon Maru&quot;.

&quot;Seahorse&quot; expended the last of her torpedoes on the night of 30 November and 1 December. After maneuvering for several hours, the submarine was finally able to fire her stern tubes at an enemy convoy. However, one torpedo exploded just after it left the tube, and the entire convoy opened fire on the vicinity of the submarine. With so many explosions around her, it was impossible for &quot;Seahorse&quot; to determine whether any torpedoes had hit. Low on fuel and out of torpedoes, the submarine returned to Pearl Harbor on 12 December from a successful second patrol, with four ships and three trawlers sunk.

== Third war patrol, January – February 1944 ==

&quot;Seahorse&quot; departed Pearl Harbor on 6 January 1944 for her third war patrol. On 16 January, while en route to the Palaus, she evaded four escorts and destroyed the 784-ton cargo ship, &quot;Nikkō Maru&quot;, with three torpedo hits. She spent 21 January tracking two enemy cargo ships in company with three escorts. In the late evening, she pressed home four consecutive attacks to sink the 3,025-ton cargo ship, &quot;Yasukuni Maru&quot;, and the 3,156-ton passenger-cargo ship, &quot;Ikoma Maru&quot;.

On the evening of 28 January, &quot;Seahorse&quot; began an 80-hour chase of an enemy convoy off the Palaus. After being continually harassed by escorts and aircraft throughout the next day, &quot;Seahorse&quot; launched three torpedoes at the cargo ship, &quot;Toko Maru&quot;. After the sinking, the submarine lost contact with the convoy for several hours, but again had it in sight at dawn on 31 January.

Early on the morning of 1 February, &quot;Seahorse&quot; launched four torpedoes for no hits followed by two more, again without result. With the crew exhausted from the extended chase, the submarine fired her final two torpedoes and headed for deeper water. After evading the escorts, she surfaced in time to see the results of her latest attack as the cargo ship, &quot;Toei Maru&quot;, slipped beneath the waves. &quot;Seahorse&quot; terminated her third patrol at Pearl Harbor on 16 February.

== Fourth war patrol, March – May 1944 ==

&quot;Seahorse&quot;″s fourth war patrol was conducted in the Mariana Islands. She departed Pearl Harbor on 16 March 1944 and intercepted a large Japanese convoy on 8 April. After nightfall, the submarine launched four torpedoes at overlapping targets, sinking the converted seaplane tender . Shortly thereafter, her second spread of torpedoes damaged the cargo ship , which subsequently was towed to Apra Harbor on Guam for repairs. Although a counterattack by escorting destroyers drove &quot;Seahorse&quot; from the vicinity, she quickly regained contact and continued the chase into the following day, sinking the cargo ship &quot;Bisaku Maru&quot;.

&quot;Seahorse&quot; took up a lifeguard station for the carrier airstrikes on Saipan that commenced on 12 April 1944. Some sources credit her with sinking the Japanese submarine west of Saipan on 20 April 1944, but &quot;Ro-45&quot; was active after that date and apparently instead was sunk south of Truk Atoll on 30 April 1944 by the destroyers and . However, in the same vicinity as her supposed sinking of &quot;Ro-45&quot;, &quot;Seahorse&quot; sank the 5,244-ton cargo ship &quot;Akigawa Maru&quot; on 27 April 1944.

On 29 April 1944, a U.S. Navy PB4Y-1 Liberator patrol bomber of Bombing Squadron 109 (VB-109) mistook &quot;Seahorse&quot; for a Japanese submarine and attacked her off Satawan southeast of Truk Atoll while she was on lifeguard duty, dropping two bombs as &quot;Seahorse&quot; crash-dived. &quot;Seahorse&quot; suffered a damaged antenna, but no other damage and no casualties. &quot;Seahorse&quot; departed her lifeguard station on 3 May to refuel at Milne Bay, New Guinea, and arrived at Brisbane, Australia, on 11 May.

== Fifth and sixth war patrols, June – October 1944 ==

&quot;Seahorse&quot; put to sea for her fifth war patrol on 11 June 1944, patrolling between Formosa and Luzon. On the morning of 27 June, she sank the tanker, &quot;Medan Maru&quot;, and damaged two other enemy vessels. On 3 July, close to midnight, she spotted convoy No. 91 en route from Takao to Hong Kong consisting of four transport/cargo ships and two escorts (the &quot;Kuri&quot; and the &quot;Hatsukari&quot;). She torpedoed and sank the transport &quot;Nitto Maru&quot; and the cargo ship &quot;Gyoyu Maru&quot; (the ex-British &quot;Joan Moller&quot;) and then soon after midnight on the 4th, she expended the last of her torpedoes and sank the cargo ship, &quot;Kyodo Maru No. 28&quot;. The convoy&#x27;s only remaining transport, (the ex-British &quot;Ethel Moller&quot;), and its two escorts, were able to reach Hong Kong without further incident on 5 July. On 19 July &quot;Seahorse&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor.

&quot;Seahorse&quot; spent the first part of her sixth war patrol supporting the capture of the Palaus and then headed for the Luzon Strait. Despite intensive efforts, the submarine could locate only one worthwhile target, &quot;Coast Defense Vessel No. 21&quot;, a frigate of 800 tons, which she sank. Five days later, &quot;Seahorse&quot; took up lifeguard station for the carrier airstrike on northern Luzon and then returned to Midway on 18 October.

== Seventh and eighth war patrols, March – August 1945 ==

Upon completion of an overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard, &quot;Seahorse&quot; put to sea on 9 March 1945 for her seventh war patrol. Following patrol in the Tsushima Strait, she sank a small junk with gunfire on 8 April. On 18 April, an attack by two patrol boats (&quot;CD-14&quot; and &quot;CD-132&quot;) left the submarine&#x27;s interior a shambles of broken glass, smashed instruments, and spilled hydraulic oil. &quot;Seahorse&quot; made hasty repairs and headed for Apra Harbor, Guam, and then to Pearl Harbor for overhaul.

&quot;Seahorse&quot; put to sea for her eighth and final war patrol on 12 July. When hostilities ceased on 15 August, the submarine was on station southeast of Hachijō-jima.

Following her return to Midway, &quot;Seahorse&quot; sailed for Mare Island where she was decommissioned on 2 March 1946. She was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet and remained inactive for the remainder of her career. She was reclassified an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-304, on 6 November 1962, struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1967, and sold on 14 December 1968 to Zidell Explorations Inc., Portland, Oregon, for scrapping.

&quot;Seahorse&quot; (SS-304) received nine battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Fittleton cum Haxton is a civil parish in Wiltshire, England, north of Salisbury. The parish contains the adjacent settlements of Fittleton and Haxton, which lie on the east bank of the River Avon opposite the village and parish of Netheravon.

==History==
Several bowl barrows are evidence of prehistoric activity in the area. On Coombe Down, a site partly within the parish was occupied in the early Iron Age, became a Romano-British settlement, and was the site of a house in the fifth or sixth century.

The Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a settlement of 24 households at &quot;Vitelstone&quot;. Later, Fittleton and Haxton were tithings of the parish, with populations of similar size.

The Manor House at Fittleton is a two-storey, five-bay house from the late 17th or early 18th century. Its stable block is from the 16th and 18th centuries, with timber framing on the north side, under a thatched roof.

Much of the downland in the parish was bought by the War Office around 1898 for military training and today forms part of the Tidworth ranges within the Salisbury Plain Training Area.

A small school was built at Fittleton in 1722, which expanded and became a National School in 1870. There were about 50 pupils in 1859 and 43 in 1906; children of all ages attended until 1926 when it became a junior school. In 1964 the school amalgamated with Netheravon school, and the older children from both parishes were educated here until the Fittleton building closed in 1989, on the opening of a new building at Netheravon.

==Church==

The Church of England parish church of All Saints is of flint and stone, partly rendered, with a west tower. It was begun in the 13th century and the chancel arch survives from that time. The building was enlarged in the 15th century and the south porch was added in the 16th. There is a 12th-century font, mounted on a shaft and base from a restoration undertaken in 1903.

Of the six bells in the tower, three are 17th-century and three are from 1903. The church has a memorial window for HMS &quot;Fittleton&quot;, a minesweeper of the Royal Naval Reserve which sunk in the North Sea in 1976 with the loss of twelve lives.

The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1964. Today Fittleton is part of the Avon River Team of parishes.

==Airfield==
Netheravon Airfield was created for the Royal Flying Corps in 1913 from farmland in the southwest of the parish, and in 1918 became RAF Netheravon, an operational and training base. It was the home of No. 1 Flying Training School RAF from 1919 until 1931, and during the Second World War was used again for training and as a short-term base for operational squadrons, with glider and parachute activity from 1941. In 1963 the airfield and camp were transferred to the Army, and became AAC Netheravon (Army Air Corps) from 1966 until 2012.
Part of the site is today used as a parachute centre, on weekdays for the Joint Services Parachute Centre (JSPC) and at weekends for the Army Parachute Association (APA).

==Local government==
Fittleton cum Haxton elects a parish council. It falls within the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for almost all significant local government functions.

<doc id="1115506" wikidata="Q1150259" url="?curid=1115506" title="Massachusetts State House">
<text>The Massachusetts State House, also known as the Massachusetts Statehouse or the New State House, is the state capitol and seat of government for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, located in the Beacon Hill neighborhood of Boston. The building houses the Massachusetts General Court (state legislature) and the offices of the Governor of Massachusetts. The building, designed by architect Charles Bulfinch, was completed in January 1798 at a cost of $133,333 (more than five times the budget), and has repeatedly been enlarged since. It is one of the oldest state capitols in current use. It is considered a masterpiece of Federal architecture and among Bulfinch&#x27;s finest works, and was designated a National Historic Landmark for its architectural significance.

==Building and grounds==
Today the building officially functions and is maintained under the auspices of the Superintendent of the Bureau of the State House.. 
The building is situated on of land on top of Beacon Hill in Boston, opposite the Boston Common on Beacon Street. It was built on land once owned by John Hancock, Massachusetts&#x27;s first elected governor. The Masonic cornerstone ceremony took place on July 4, 1795, with Paul Revere, then Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Massachusetts, presiding.

Before the current State House was completed in 1798, Massachusetts&#x27;s government house was the Old State House on what is now Washington Street. For the building&#x27;s design, architect Charles Bulfinch made use of two existing buildings in London: William Chambers&#x27;s Somerset House, and James Wyatt&#x27;s Pantheon.

After Maine separated from Massachusetts and became an independent state in 1820, Charles Bulfinch designed Maine&#x27;s capitol building with architectural influence of the Massachusetts Capitol building with a simplified Greek Revival influence.

The Commonwealth completed a major expansion of the original building in 1895. The architect for the annex was Bostonian Charles Brigham.

In 1917, the east and west wings, designed by architects Sturgis, Bryant, Chapman &amp; Andrews, were completed.

In July 2016, Governor Charlie Baker proposed to the state legislature to sell of permanent easement on the west side of the State House lawn to a neighboring condominium. The land in question was once pasture owned by John Hancock and the easement would allow for the addition of au pair units. Through legislation passed by the legislature the land surrounding the state house is considered &quot;open space&quot;. 

===Dome===
The original wood dome, which leaked, was covered with copper in 1802 by Paul Revere&#x27;s Revere Copper Company. Revere was the first American to roll copper successfully into sheets (for copper sheathing) in a commercially viable manner.

The dome was first painted gray and then light yellow before being gilded with gold leaf in 1874. During World War II, the dome was painted gray once again, to prevent reflection during blackouts and to protect the city and building from bombing attacks. The dome was re-gilded in 1969, at a cost of $36,000. Then, in July 1997, the dome was once again re-gilded, in 23k gold. The estimated cost this time was $1.5 million. 

The dome is topped with a gilded, wooden pine cone, symbolizing both the importance of Boston&#x27;s lumber industry during early colonial times and of the state of Maine, which was a district of the Commonwealth when the Bulfinch section of the building was completed.

===Statuary===
In front of the building is an equestrian statue of General Joseph Hooker. Other statues in front of the building include Daniel Webster, educator Horace Mann, and former US President John F. Kennedy. The statues of Anne Hutchinson and Mary Dyer are located on the lawns below the east and west wings. Inside the building is a statue of William Francis Bartlett, an officer in the Civil War.

===Building interior===

The original red-brick Bulfinch building contains the Governor&#x27;s offices (on the west end) with the Massachusetts Senate occupying the former House of Representatives Chamber under the dome. The Massachusetts House of Representatives occupies a chamber on the west side of the Brigham addition. Hanging over this chamber is the &quot;Sacred Cod&quot;, which was given to the House of Representatives in 1784 by a Boston merchant. The Sacred Cod symbolizes the importance of the fishing industry to the early Massachusetts economy.

The House Chamber is decorated with murals by Albert Herter, father of Massachusetts Gov. Christian Herter. Murals on the second floor under the dome were painted by artist Edward Brodney. Brodney won a competition to paint the first mural in a contest sponsored by the Works Progress Administration in 1936. It is entitled &quot;Columbia Knighting Her World War Disabled&quot;. Brodney could not afford to pay models, and friends and family posed. The model for Columbia was Brodney&#x27;s sister Norma Brodney Cohen, and the model for the soldier on one knee in the foreground was his brother Fred Brodney. In 1938, he painted a second mural under the dome called &quot;World War Mothers&quot;. The models were again primarily friends and family members, with sister Norma sitting beside their mother Sarah Brodney. &quot;The New York Times&quot; notes that the murals are relatively rare examples of military art with women as their subjects.

A staircase in front of the Bulfinch building leads from Beacon Street to Doric Hall inside the building. The large main doors inside Doric Hall are only opened on three occasions:

# When the President of the United States or a foreign head of state visits.
# When the Governor exits the building on his or her last day in office. The Governor descends the staircase, crosses Beacon Street, and enters Boston Common, symbolically rejoining the people of Massachusetts as a private citizen.
# When a regimental flag is returned from battle. Since the regimental flags now return to Washington, D.C., this has not been done since the Vietnam War.

Memorial Hall, also known as the Hall of Flags, is a room that sits central to the state house&#x27;s second floor. The room displays regiment flags of returning Massachusetts soldiers from various regiments across every war since the Civil War. The stained glass skylight above contains the seals of the original Thirteen Colonies of the United States, with the Massachusetts seal in the center.

The Samuel Adams and Paul Revere time capsule is a metal box located in a cornerstone of the State House, placed there in the late 18th century and rediscovered in 2014. The contents include coins, newspaper clippings, and other historical artifacts.

==Offices==
===Constitutional Officers===
The State House contains the primary offices of all the commonwealth&#x27;s constitutional officers with exception of the Attorney General, who is based at the nearby McCormack Building.
*Governor and Lieutenant Governor (Room 360)
*Governor&#x27;s Council (Room 184)
*Secretary of the Commonwealth (Room 340)
*Treasurer and Receiver-General (Room 227)
*Auditor (Room 230)

===Legislature===
The majority of State House office space is given over to the Legislature. Every member of the House and Senate is assigned an office. Large third-floor suites are assigned to the House Speaker (Room 356) and Senate President (Room 332). Other offices include the House and Senate clerks, House and Senate counsel, and Legislative Information Services.

===Press===
One corridor of the building&#x27;s fourth floor is a sort of Newspaper Row, anchored by the large Press Gallery suite where reporters from a range of publications maintain desks. The central Press Gallery room was given to use of reporters by the Legislature in 1909. The Massachusetts State House Press Association, established in 1909, governs these shared workspaces. Some individual news outlets have separate offices.
*Press Gallery—Headquarters of State House reporters for Associated Press, WWLP-TV, the Eagle-Tribune papers, Lowell Sun, WGBH-FM, Springfield Republican/Masslive, and Politico
*State House News Service newsroom
*WBUR-FM State House bureau
*Boston Globe State House bureau
*Kevin McNicholas Room, a shared space for broadcast stations

===Veterans&#x27; Organizations===
A suite of rooms on the fifth floor is home to the Massachusetts headquarters of several veterans&#x27; groups, including the American Legion, American Legion Auxiliary, AMVETS, Disabled American Veterans, Italian American War Veterans of the United States, Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, Korean War Veterans, Marine Corps League, Military Order of the Purple Heart, Persian Gulf Era Veterans, Polish Legion of American Veterans, Veterans of Foreign Wars, and Vietnam Veterans of America.

==&quot;Hub of the Solar System&quot; nickname==

One of Boston&#x27;s most enduring nicknames, &quot;The Hub of the Universe&quot;, stems from a remark by Oliver Wendell Holmes from his 1858 book &quot;The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table&quot; in which he mentions the State House: &quot;A jaunty-looking person ... said there was one more wise man&#x27;s saying that he had heard; it was about our place—but he didn&#x27;t know who said it. ... Boston State-House is the Hub of the Solar System. You couldn&#x27;t pry that out of a Boston man if you had the tire of all creation straightened out for a crow-bar&quot;.

<doc id="1115507" wikidata="Q2536362" url="?curid=1115507" title="My Ruin">
<text>My Ruin is an American alternative metal band from Los Angeles, California, composed of the husband and wife duo Tairrie B and Mick Murphy. The band has been through various lineup changes since its formation in 1999. The band&#x27;s sound consists of passionate vocals and heavy rock beats, with most of the fanbase in the UK. Vocalist Tairrie B has cultivated a reputation both on and off the stage for her aggressive performances and acerbic vocal style. The band&#x27;s sound has evolved and become heavier with each album, and Murphy&#x27;s guitar playing becoming a prominent feature along with his solos and riffs.

My Ruin are a &quot;DIY&quot; band who have control over every aspect of their output. In the past they have released several of their records via their own imprint, Rovena Recordings. These records include; &quot;The Brutal Language&quot; (2005), &quot;Throat Full of Heart&quot; (2008), and the live album &quot;Alive On the Other Side&quot; (2008). They have also been signed to numerous record labels, including Snapper, Spitfire, Century Media, Undergroove Records, Rovena Recordings, and Tiefdruck-Musik.

==History==
===Formation of My Ruin solo project and debut release; &quot;Speak and Destroy&quot; (1999–2000)===
My Ruin was founded by frontwoman Tairrie B in February 1999, shortly after her previous outfit, Tura Satana, disbanded in late 1998 after the release of their second studio album &quot;Relief Through Release&quot;.

Tairrie immediately started making plans for her next musical incarnation, which would be a solo project. Of the project in early 1999, Tairrie stated: &quot;The band won&#x27;t just be called Tairrie B, but it will be a solo thing – just like Nine Inch Nails is really just Trent Reznor… It&#x27;s all down to me now. If it fails, then I won&#x27;t have anyone else to blame.&quot;

The recording for &quot;Speak and Destroy&quot; started in February 1999.

&quot;Speak and Destroy,&quot; released on August 23, 1999 in the UK and Europe, would see Tairrie explore previously uncharted musical territory. The album would be an experimental amalgamation of styles, part spoken word, part metal, part industrial with electronic stylings; there are also some rap metal-style verses. The album received highly favorable reviews from the mainstream rock press, with the likes of Kerrang! rating the album 4k&#x27;s out of 5.

Also, many journalists noted that the album was the perfect showcase for the &quot;multi-faceted character&quot; of Tairrie B and her perceived volatile persona, Kerrang! magazine stated: &quot;With My Ruin the volatile vocalist has finally found a worthy platform for her talents.&quot;

The album and subsequent singles also charted high in the UK charts.

The collage of different styles on the record may have been due in part to the fact that the recording took place in four different locations around the world, with different musicians and bands contributing to the recording, writing and production. At the time in an interview, Tairrie said: &quot;Bushaq recorded some of the songs here in England, Mel and I did some with Joe Bishara, Ares from downset. did some and Joe Bishara did some with Tura Satana. So there were four completely different scenarios.&quot;

Amidst the chaos, Tairrie found her main song-writing partner and guitarist in Melanie Makaiwi. Of the partnership and friendship that formed between the pair Tairrie said: &quot;I probably enjoyed doing the stuff with Mel most of all. It was generally me going, &#x27;okay, this is the scenario. What do I need to do?&#x27;. Melanie was writer, producer, artist, therapist, mentor, best friend, drink technician and drug partner on this album. She was everything a girl could be.&quot; Further to this, Tairrie cited Makaiwi as the one who led Tairrie to explore a more restrained vocal style than what she was used to: &quot;Working with Melanie was a very cool influence because when we started working together it started as a very casual, experimental vibe. She&#x27;d say, &#x27;You don&#x27;t need to scream on everything, you need to try something different&#x27;.&quot;

==== &quot;Sick with It&quot; and &quot;8mm&quot; film soundtrack ====
The track &quot;Sick with It&quot; went on to feature on the soundtrack for the Nicolas Cage film &quot;8mm&quot;. The track was written with Tairrie&#x27;s previous musical cohorts Tura Satana for inclusion on &quot;Speak and Destroy&quot;. In an early interview promoting &quot;Speak and Destroy&quot;, Tairrie revealed that she and her Tura Satana bandmates were still on good terms: &quot;It&#x27;s not like when we fired Scott (Udea, former Tura Satana guitarist). Me and the guys still hang out together.&quot;

In another interview regarding the song, Tairrie revealed that there are two versions of the song, the one on &quot;Speak and Destroy&quot; and the one on &quot;8mm&quot; soundtrack: &quot;The three Tura Satana guys [bassist Rico Villasenor, guitarist Brian Harrah and drummer Marcelo Palomino] are involved, and I&#x27;ve got Grady Avenell [vocals] and Michael Martin [bass] from Will Haven [who&#x27;ve just finished recording their second album &quot;&#x27;WHVN&#x27;&quot;] on a track called &quot;&#x27;Sick With It&quot;&#x27;. This was written by Brian Harrah, and a different version is on the soundtrack for the new Nicolas Cage movie 8MM.&quot;

==== Singles &quot;Terror&quot; and &quot;Tainted Love&quot; ====
&quot;Speak and Destroy&quot; spawned two singles: &quot;Tainted Love&quot; backed with &quot;Blasphemous Girl&quot;, released in July 1999 and &quot;Terror&quot; backed with &quot;June 10&quot;, released in October 1999.

The singles were released on both CD and limited edition numbered vinyl. 1,000 copies of the &quot;Tainted Love&quot; single was released on red vinyl and 1,000 copies of the &quot;Terror&quot; single were released on standard vinyl.

The &quot;Tainted Love&quot; CD single was a three track single featuring the &quot;Tainted Love&quot; cover &quot;Blasphemous Girl&quot; and spoken word track &quot;Scars&quot;.

The &quot;Terror&quot; CD single was a three track single of remixed versions of &quot;Terror&quot; (Trilogy Edit), &quot;June 10&quot; (Martyr Edit) and also a live studio recording of the Snot track, &quot;Stoopid&quot;.

The track &quot;Terror&quot; somewhat bridged the gap between Tairrie&#x27;s previous album, because it was a re-working of a hidden spoken word track at the end of &quot;Relief Through Release&quot;. The track also served as a statement of intent, kicking against the naysayers who said she was crazy for splitting up Tura Satana and that it would ultimately be her ruin. At the end of &quot;Terror&quot;, Tairrie states: &quot;No one is going to ruin me; if I have to, I will ruin myself—and it will be My Ruin.&quot; This has served as a personal mantra for Tairrie through the years regarding the band.

==== &quot;Tainted Love&quot; and &quot;Stoopid&quot; covers ====
Following the tradition of recording and performing the occasional cover song throughout Tairrie&#x27;s career, going back as far as Tairrie&#x27;s days in Manhole, where she covered the song &quot;Hard Times&quot; by punk/thrash band Cro-Mags, the band covered Tainted Love and Stoopid.

Another cover which featured on Tairrie&#x27;s Relief Through Release record was &quot;Negative Creep&quot; by Nirvana.

For &quot;Speak and Destroy&quot;, Tairrie would do her own interpretation of the much covered song &quot;Tainted Love&quot;. The song would go on to haunt the band many years later with fans requesting it live and Tairrie and Mick refusing and showing disdain for the song, which no longer fit with the ethos, vibe or feel of the band. This was made clear in many interviews.
In an interview in 1999, when asked why she did the cover of Tainted Love Tairrie simply stated: &quot;I wanted to piss everybody off. We were listening to an old &#x27;80s tape on the way to the studio and I thought it suited what we were doing.&quot;

The track was originally made famous by Gloria Jones in 1965 and perhaps more memorably by Soft Cell in 1981. Marilyn Manson would later cover the song in 2001.

The cover of &quot;Stoopid&quot; was a tribute to Tairrie&#x27;s very good friend Lynn Strait, Snot front-man, who had died in December 1998. In an interview with Kerrang! in 2000, Tairrie said of the cover: &quot;When Lynn died on the same day as my Grandfather my band decided to cover &#x27;Stoopid&#x27; when we went on tour. That was kind of my way of dealing with the grief that I was feeling.&quot;

==== &quot;Terror&quot; video and possible existence of unseen &quot;June 10&quot; video ====
In a Kerrang! magazine feature from 1999, the magazine revealed that My Ruin had been busy recording two videos in London&#x27;s Electrowerkz. The two videos and tracks in question were single &quot;Terror&quot; which was released to coincide with the release of the single and &quot;June 10&quot;, which to date has never surfaced. Both videos were said to be directed by photographer Paul Harries.

The &quot;June 10&quot; video was mentioned again on &quot;myruin.com&quot;, when Tairrie was answering fan questions sent to her via email and on the then &quot;myruin.com&quot; message board. She said in relation to a tour video/DVD documenting the &quot;My Beautiful Pain Tour&quot;: &quot;I might be going back to England mid November to edit down the tour video. I will be doing it with the guys who did the &quot;TERROR&quot; video with me. This is not for sure because I kind of want to stay in LA and edit but it may not be an option. The video will include lots of live footage, fans, backstage, and the bands we were with on tour, also the unedited versions of &quot;TERROR&quot; as well as making of the video footage and possibly June Tenth footage.&quot;

==== Live lineup ====
When it came to the final lineup of the band, the first incarnation of My Ruin was:

*Melanie Makaiwi (guitar)
*Lance Webber (guitar)
*Meghan Mattox (bass)
*Marcelo Palomino (drums)
*Todd Osenbaugh (keyboards and samples)

Marcelo Palomino had been the drummer for Tura Satana. At the time, Tairrie stated: &quot;When I first walked out of Tura Satana, Marcelo was one of the reasons I left, so it&#x27;s funny he&#x27;s with me again now. I asked him to do this project because I really respect him as a musician. He is my backbone, he is my strength and without him I simply don&#x27;t think I could do it. He&#x27;s the best friend I&#x27;ve got.&quot;

Palomino would become a recurring member of My Ruin and he joined the live band once again for their Tell Your God Tour in 2008 whilst promoting the band&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Throat Full of Heart&quot;. He would also feature on the artwork and recordings of the 2nd live album, titled &quot;Alive on the Other Side&quot;, that followed in late 2008. In 2011, Palomino collaborated with the band again and co-directed the band&#x27;s video for the track &quot;Tennessee Elegy&quot; from the seventh studio album &quot;A Southern Revelation&quot;.

===&quot;A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish&quot; (2000–2002)===

In 2000, the band would take on a new lineup, which saw the addition of former Movement vocalist/guitarist and longtime My Ruin guitarist/composer Mick Murphy. Mick would go on to be the band&#x27;s longest serving member after Tairrie and became the sole songwriter. In an interview many years later, Tairrie said: &quot;I released my first album under the name My Ruin and it was called &quot;Speak and Destroy&quot; on Snapper Music back in 1999. Soon after touring that album I actually met Mick Murphy, who is now my husband, my partner of ten years and my guitar player. He came in and we started dating and we got involved musically. It was the first time that&#x27;s ever happened to me.&quot;

In a 2006 interview Mick said of meeting Tairrie: &quot;I met Tairrie in February of 2000 at a party in Hollywood. We clicked right when we met and started hanging and got serious pretty fast. We also started writing &quot;A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish,&quot; which was our first time working together musically, soon after that so it was a crazy, exciting, life changing kinda time.&quot;

Meghan Mattox would carry on playing bass and contributed to the songwriting process, but the rest of the band including Melanie Makaiwi would no longer be part of the My Ruin project. Regarding her departure in an interview, Tairrie stated that &quot;Melanie had written a few songs with me. But we had to get a second guitarist in because she wasn&#x27;t really a metal guitarist. She was really cool as she was the first woman I ever worked with. But when it came down to playing the heavier stuff live, it really wasn&#x27;t her thing.&quot;

The &quot;Prayer Under Pressure…&quot; era saw My Ruin become a fully realized band and unit of contributing members, rather than being just Tairrie&#x27;s solo project. During this time Tairrie stated: &quot;This is the real deal. Not to sound like I&#x27;m dissing anyone but the truth is that I needed to break free of my past and although Marcelo is a good friend and awesome drummer his heart was not in it. Melanie was really cool but she did not understand the heavier side of things or &quot;The Metal!&quot; Lance and Toddy were basically just hired musicians for the tour.&quot;

Drumming duties on the album were undertaken by downset Drummer Chris Hamilton. 2000 also saw the addition of live drummer Yael, who would remain in the band until 2005. Yael went on to contribute to the band&#x27;s &quot;The Shape of Things to Come... EP&quot; and &quot;The Horror of Beauty&quot; record.

In an interview with &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, Mick gave us a peek into the band&#x27;s future which would take on a whole new sound through the years due to Mick&#x27;s musicianship. He said: &quot;I like the more old-school rock vibe...The fuzzy guitars, the big thick sounds, a lot of low-end power. Not that digital-sounding dance-metal.&quot;

The band underwent a winter 2000 concert tour of the UK in to promote A Prayer Under Pressure, supported by SugarComa. In an interview on the penultimate night of the tour, Tairrie explained her inspiration for the record&#x27;s title: &quot;The title comes from a couple of different prayer books I&#x27;ve been reading, in different parts. I kind of put it together, I read &quot;A Prayer Under Pressure&quot; in an old 1800s prayer book and then I read &quot;Of Violent Anguish&quot; somewhere else and I thought &quot;That sounds kinda like my life and what we&#x27;re doing&quot; so I put them together and liked it.&quot;

A Prayer Under Pressure not only saw a change in lineup, but also a shift musically and a return to Tairrie&#x27;s heavier roots. The record combined the harsher more abrasive elements of Speak and Destroy with Mick&#x27;s trademark southern sounding guitar playing. Mick&#x27;s style of playing would go on to play a major focal point in the years and records to come down the line. When comparing the heaviosity of A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish with Speak and Destroy, in an interview, Tairrie said: &quot;Mick came in and had a lot of ideas that were really, really cool and a lot heavier.&quot;

In the same interview Mick commented: &quot;I jumped into this band head first. I had a lot of musical ideas. I like to write, I like to write a lot. I like to be in control of what&#x27;s going on musically, and we pushed her, encouraged her to do a heavy record.&quot;

He also went on to say that: &quot;We did it because that&#x27;s just the way I write music. One thing led to another, and before you know it we&#x27;ve got this brutally heavy album. I&#x27;m totally happy about that because I think metal needs to be raw, and not necessarily easy to listen to. I think that this record is truly heavy, so I&#x27;m proud of it.&quot;

The album was met with favorable reviews worldwide, with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; rating it 4 K&#x27;s out of 5 and &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; rating it 8 out of 10.

&quot;A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish&quot; was released in September 2000. While the band were busy releasing &quot;A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish&quot; in the UK and Europe via Snapper Music, &quot;Speak and Destroy&quot; was simultaneously released in the US via Spitfire Records. A year later in 2001, &quot;A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish&quot; was released in the US via Spitfire Records.

==== Cover songs &quot;Do You Love Me?&quot; and &quot;My War&quot; ====
For this record, the band would cover two songs. The first being Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds &quot;Do You Love Me?&quot; and hidden track, &quot;My War&quot; originally by Black Flag (band). It has been well documented throughout Tairrie&#x27;s career in interviews that she is a big fan of Nick Cave. Mick has also stated that Black Flag (band) is a big inspiration of his and that he previously covered the song &quot;My War&quot; in his prior band Movement. Tairrie liked the sound of it so they decided to cover the song, which became a duet between the two.

Mick and Tairrie would occasionally duet on a couple of songs through the vast My Ruin back catalog. Such duets include the 2005 cover of Mudhoney&#x27;s &quot;Touch Me I&#x27;m Sick&quot; which featured on the band&#x27;s &quot;The Brutal Language&quot; record and more recently &quot;Repose&quot; from the band&#x27;s &quot;Ghosts and Good Stories&quot; record.

In the &quot;Kerrang!&quot; review for the album, both covers were praised: &quot;A couple of starkly contrasting covers helps to keep My Ruin sounding fresh. A bleak reading of Nick Cave&#x27;s &quot;Do You Love Me?&quot; is perfectly suited to Miss B&#x27;s sultry drawl and loses none of its dark atmosphere in the translation. Black Flag&#x27;s &quot;My War&quot;, on the other hand, is a breakneck blast that collapses into a dense wall of noise that Henry Rollins would be proud of.&quot;

==== &quot;Beauty Fiend&quot; single ====
In the year 2000, UK magazine &quot;Kerrang!&quot;, reviewed the band&#x27;s hit single Beauty Fiend, taken from the A Prayer Under Pressure of Violent Anguish record, of which both received favorable reviews worldwide, with &quot;Kerrang!&quot; rating the single 3 Ks out of 5.

However, as is often the case, the review didn&#x27;t come without its derogatory/backhanded comments regarding Tairrie&#x27;s looks and body. The review opened with; &quot;Despite being afforded far more attention this side of the Atlantic than a pretty face and a pair of tits warrants, Miss B is far from incapable of coming up with the goods every now and again.&quot;

The single became somewhat of an anthem among fans, challenging the oppressive, patriarchal and misogynist world of music and the media in general. The song would go on to be a My Ruin classic, fan favorite and set staple. In response to the review and speaking about the song in an interview with the same magazine, Tairrie stated: &quot;This is exactly what &quot;Beauty Fiend&quot; is about! It&#x27;s stating that I&#x27;m not gorgeous, I&#x27;m not some f**cking beauty. It&#x27;s nice to be called sexy and it&#x27;s nice to be called pretty…It&#x27;s always a compliment. Next week they&#x27;ll call me f**cking ugly. That&#x27;s nice too. But for the cover of the single, I&#x27;ve got all my make-up smeared and messed at the very end of a photoshoot. I know that I look like a hag, but it [the lyrics] kinda says it all: &#x27;forgive me for not being pretty… Quit talking about my ass and my tits. Who gives a f**ck? I don&#x27;t look at men like that. I don&#x27;t look at Phil Anselmo and see a cock.&#x27;&quot;

Despite such abuse, Tairrie has continued to break down barriers for women in rock and metal for over two decades. In a 2001 interview she stated: &quot;My opinion is what it is... mine. Take it or leave it. Respect it or not. I will always have my own opinions and I am never be afraid to voice them. I don&#x27;t want to revolutionize anything but myself. The more I learn, the more I change and the more I grow. I would rather be responsible for helping to open doors for women rather than closing them&quot;.

Furthermore, of the song &quot;Beauty Fiend&quot;, she stated: &quot;&quot;Beauty Fiend&quot; is meant to be a real &#x27;f**ck you&#x27; of a song...I&#x27;m not here to be your sex symbol, I&#x27;m not here to be your pretty girl on the cover. I&#x27;m here to be honest and to be beautiful on the inside while i&#x27;m ugly on the outside. What I&#x27;m giving you is pure. It&#x27;s not f**cking fake or contrived. That&#x27;s what real beauty is.&quot;

The single was released on CD and limited edition 7&quot; vinyl, with 1,000 numbered copies being produced. The CD release was backed with the tracks Masochrist and the Black Flag cover of My War.

=== &quot;Ghosts and Good Stories&quot; (2010–2011) ===
During October 2009 in a press release, the band revealed that they had signed with the Tiefdruck-Musik record label.

The 6th studio album, titled Ghosts and Good Stories, was much neglected in terms of promotion and its hindered and botched release riddled with problems. These issues were due to their now ex record label, German based Tiefdruck-Musik.

Despite the issues surrounding the record behind the scenes the album went on to become the band&#x27;s most critically acclaimed album to date. Reviews far and wide saw the band receive exposure in many European publications where the album was met with favorable reviews.

&quot;Kerrang!&quot; rated &quot;Ghosts and Good Stories&quot; 4 K&#x27;s out of 5. Journalist Paul Travers wrote in his review: &quot;As the singer and figurehead of Manhole and Tura Satana in the 90&#x27;s, Tairrie B was among the first to channel screaming metallic rage through a female perspective... the vocalist gives vent to her inner demons, it&#x27;s clear she&#x27;s not mellowing with age... My Ruin create an abrasive, sludgy noise, punctuated by moments of melody and calm. It&#x27;s stark, confrontational and aggressive, but also fiercely intelligent, ensuring the duo stay one step ahead of the screaming angst-ridden pack.&quot;

Metal Hammer UK and Italy came to the same conclusion regarding the album, with both grading it 8 out of 10. Dom Lawson of Metal Hammer UK wrote; &quot;an exhilarating barrage of warped stoner metal riffs and blister-razing gutter-punk that lurches from harrowing, slow-motion menace &quot;(Diggin&#x27; For Ghosts)&quot; to floored-accelerator sludgecore &quot;(Long Dark Night)&quot;; the whole scabrous din held together by its creators&#x27; unswerving passion. Easily the filthiest, heaviest and most exciting thing that Tairrie has put her scream to.&quot;

==== &quot;Excommunicated&quot; and &quot;Long Dark Night&quot; videos ====
On May 21, 2011 the band announced the video for the song &quot;Excommunicated&quot;. The video was filmed and edited by Tor Burrows of Notorious Design who had worked with the band previously on their other videos for their live Rick Derringer cover of &quot;Rock and Roll, Hoochie Koo&quot; and &quot;Me Without You&quot; from the band&#x27;s &quot;Throat Full Of Heart&quot; album.

The &quot;Excommunicated&quot; video officially premiered via the band&#x27;s website on May 22, 2011, to coincide with the 2011 end times prediction of Harold Camping.

Tor Burrows would later go on to direct and edit the video for &quot;Long Dark Night&quot; which premiered on the band&#x27;s official site on August 8, 2011. The video contains live footage shot in the UK by Tor, mixed with footage shot in LA at the Whisky a Go Go shot by former My Ruin and Tura Satana drummer Marcelo Palomino as well as home footage shot of Tairrie herself. There are also various pieces of public domain stock footage and most strikingly of all, Hill of Crosses footage given to the band by film-maker Asatuurs Keim.

The Hill of Crosses is a Catholic pilgrimage site in northern Lithuania where, over many years Catholic pilgrims have left crosses and other religious paraphernalia. Tairrie stated she had always been intrigued by this religious site; &quot;For some it is seen as a place of peace and power, for others a devotion and memorial. For me however, it is simply a scene of beauty whose landscape speaks to me on an otherworldly level when I view its images in photographs. It wasn&#x27;t until Tor came across the footage shot by Asatuurs that this place began to speak to me subconsciously inviting me to have my own personal connection to it within this song, breathing a new scenery into my language.&quot; This revelation led to Tairrie reaching out to Asatuurs and writing him an email in which she asked if she could use the footage in the video for Long Dark Night, to this Asatuurs agreed. The footage goes hand in hand with the religious imagery with which the band have become notorious for using throughout their body work.

In keeping with the band&#x27;s DIY ethic, Tairrie stated: &quot;we had no budget to make this video. We are a DIY band and have always had to figure out a way to do it ourselves. With that in mind, we can say that it was a true labor of love made purely with passion, along with Premiere, After Effects and many long nights of editing and chatting on Skype from LA to the UK while cutting and pasting files, photos and footage into a shared folder in Dropbox and writing each other suggestions back and forth on Facebook. Welcome to the digital age! This video was made with no money but a million dollars worth of creativity and an artistic vision between two women who understand each other, the music one makes and the other one listens to.&quot;

==== Ghosts and Good Stories Tour ====
In May 2010 the band started releasing details of US, UK and German tour dates in order to promote the &quot;Ghosts and Good Stories&quot; album. But in early August 2010, the band issued a statement to press which revealed the cancellation of the tour dates.

Of the decision to cancel the dates at the time the band said; &quot;As you know, My Ruin takes pride in being an independent and professional band with a strong DIY ethic and we realize [as we know you do] things like this happen all the time to bands both big and small but this is the first time in the 10-year history of our band that we have had to cancel a tour not to mention two very special shows in LA &amp; London…Thank you all for your continued love and support. We are both sorry about this situation and hope you will understand that we did everything within our power to prevent this from happening.&quot;

The band went on to tour the album successfully after taking logistics into their own hands as they have done before without the help of a label. Late in August 2010, the band released information regarding the rescheduled dates for what would be the 10-date 2011 &quot;Ghosts and Good Stories Tour&quot;.

In December 2010, the band released information on the live rhythm section for the tour. The two new band members to join the band were announced as Luciano Ferrea of the LA based band Beggars Ball and familiar face Matt LeChevalier. Matt had previously recorded with the band on the Throat Full of Heart album in 2008. He also toured with the band during The Brutal Language Tour and Summer of Hell Tour in 2006.

==== Record label issues ====
A year after the release of &quot;Ghosts and Good Stories&quot; when unveiling details for 7th studio album &quot;A Southern Revelation&quot;, the band spoke out about the issues surrounding the botched &quot;Ghosts and Good Stories&quot; release, Tiefdruck-Musik and the label boss himself. A statement issued by the band revealed that: &quot;We had begun to confirm shows for a European tour and were looking forward to working with our new label when suddenly there was a strange and unexpected turn of events and Daniel Heerdmann changed from being our biggest supporter into our most vicious adversary overnight. We had no idea why or where this sudden shift in attitude had come from. We were now dealing with a completely different man and it was scary. We quickly began to discover many of his promises had been lies regarding money transfers, marketing, promotion and tour support. This led to our being forced for the first time in our career to cancel our tour as chaos and confusion set in. Our album release was delayed in every territory and our once friendly mutual respectful relationship was now done. To date My Ruin has never received any accounting from Tiefdruck Musik for album sales.&quot; These lies resulted in the album release being delayed many times and the cancellation of the &quot;Ghosts and Good stories Tour&quot;, which was to be rescheduled for the following year.

Always turning a positive into a negative the drama with Tiefdruck-Musik and owner Daniel Heerdmann would go on to inspire the band&#x27;s most critically lauded album &quot;A Southern Revelation&quot;.

==Side projects==
The duo also pursue other projects which include The LVRS, a spoken word side project of &quot;spoken word dirges set to music&quot;, Neanderthal, Mick&#x27;s instrumental metal side project and Tairrie&#x27;s Blasphemous Girl Designs.

===The LVRS===
This project involves both Tairrie and Mick. The LVRS project formed in 2003 when the couple self-released &quot;The Murder of Miss Hollywood&quot; via their official website. They then went on to self-release the 2nd album &quot;The Secret Life of Lola Burns&quot; in 2004, again through their own website. Due to the praise and success of the project from the fans, the duo decided to find an official home for the recordings.
The first official CD release was titled; &quot;Death Has Become Her&quot; (2006) via record label Undergroove Records and was later re-released, digitally in 2009 via bandcamp.com. In a review for &quot;Death Has Become Her&quot;, Morley Seaver wrote; &quot;The material is a mélange of autobiographical material courtesy of Tairrie B, and pieces of fiction inspired by several sources; the poet Virginia Woolf&#x27;s suicide along with the Black Dahlia murder of 1947. Fittingly the material reflects the roots of the band&#x27;s (as it were) name. The topics of Love, Violence, Religion and Sex figure prominently in these stories (look at the first letter in each of those words if you haven&#x27;t caught on already) sometimes simultaneously.&quot; The 2nd official, digital only release is: &quot;Lady Speaks the Bruise&quot; (2010) also released via bandcamp.com. Both official releases were put together from the original recordings with the addition of new tracks.

On February 14, 2012, Valentine&#x27;s Day, The LVRS announced via www.myruin.net that they would be making both &quot;Death Has Become Her&quot; and &quot;Lady Speaks the Bruise&quot; albums available as a free digital only download via www.bandcamp.com.

===Neanderthal===
Another side project is Mick Murphy&#x27;s side project Neanderthal. This is a solo outing, often described by the man himself as instrumental-metal in which Mick writes, performs, records and produces all that is heard.
The first album, &quot;Start a Fire with Rock&quot;, was released in 2006 as a 14-song CD and 2nd album &quot;Take The Ride&quot;, was released in 2007. Both were also available as a USB wristband in the band&#x27;s merchandise store. They have since been re-mastered and re-released online via bandcamp.com along with a number of other recordings.

===Blasphemous Girl Designs===
Blasphemous Girl Designs initially focused on My Ruin band merchandise and de-constructed clothing. The brand later went on to focus primarily on jewelry and wearable art. Blasphemous Girl Designs was founded in 2001 and an online store was opened in 2009. Tairrie hand makes everything herself again in keeping with her DIY ethic. In recent years the brands tagline has been; &quot;Wearable art for the individual at heart&quot;.
In an interview in September 2011, Tairrie expressed plans to grow her BGD brand: &quot;When the time is right it might be nice to take it to the next level at some point and get a few of my ideas backed by a larger company.&quot;

<text>Rockwell Automation, Inc. is an American provider of industrial automation and digital transformation technologies. Brands include Allen-Bradley, FactoryTalk software and LifecycleIQ Services.

Headquartered in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Rockwell Automation employs approximately 27,000 people and has customers in more than 100 countries worldwide.

==History==

===Early years===
Rockwell Automation began in 1903 as the Compression Rheostat Launch Company. It was founded by Dr. Stanton Allen and Lynde Bradley with an initial investment of $1000. In 1904, 19-year-old Harry Bradley joined his brother in the business, and the company&#x27;s first patented product, a carbon disc compression-type motor controller for industrial cranes, was demonstrated at the St. Louis World&#x27;s Fair the same year. In 1909, the company was renamed the Allen-Bradley Company.

Allen-Bradley expanded rapidly during World War I in response to government-contracted work. Its product line grew to include automatic starters, switches, circuit breakers, relays, and other electric equipment. After the war, the company grew its miniature rheostat business to support the burgeoning radio industry. By the middle of the 1920s, nearly 50 percent of the company&#x27;s sales were attributed to the radio department. The year 1929 closed with record company sales of $3 million.

By 1932, at the start of the Great Depression, the company was posting record losses. It reduced its workforce and cut wages by 50%. Throughout this period, Lynde Bradley supported an aggressive research and development approach intended to &quot;develop the company out of the Depression.&quot; By 1937, Allen-Bradley employment had rebounded to pre-Depression levels and company sales reached an all-time high of nearly $4 million.

===Mid-late 20th century===
World War II fueled unprecedented levels of production, with 80% of the company&#x27;s orders being war-related. Wartime orders were centered on two broad lines of products: industrial controls to speed production, and electrical components or radio parts used in a wide range of military equipment. Allen-Bradley expanded its facilities numerous times during the 1940s to meet wartime production needs. With Fred Loock serving as president and Harry Bradley as chairman, the company began a major $1 million, two-year expansion project in 1947. The company completed additional expansions at its Milwaukee facilities in the 1950s and 1960s, including the Allen-Bradley clock tower.

During the 1970s, the company expanded its production facilities and markets and entered the 1980s as a global company. In 1981, the company introduced a new line of programmable logic controllers.

In 1985, Rockwell International purchased Allen-Bradley for $1.651 billion; this was the largest acquisition in Wisconsin&#x27;s history to date. For all intents and purposes, Allen-Bradley took over Rockwell&#x27;s industrial automation division.

The 1990s featured continued technology development, including the company&#x27;s launch of its software business. Rockwell International developed PowerFlex, a manufacturing software and technology in the 1990s. Rockwell International also acquired a power systems business, composed of Reliance Electric and Dodge. These two brands, combined with control systems brands Allen-Bradley and Rockwell Software, were marketed as Rockwell Automation.

===21st century===

In 2001, Rockwell International split into two companies. The industrial automation division became Rockwell Automation, while the avionics division became Rockwell Collins. The split was structured so that Rockwell Automation was the legal successor of Rockwell International, while Rockwell Collins was the spin-off. Rockwell Automation retains Rockwell International&#x27;s stock price history and continues to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol &quot;ROK&quot;.

In February 2019, Rockwell Automation and Schlumberger entered a joint venture to create Sensia, the oil and gas industry&#x27;s first fully integrated automation solutions provider. Rockwell was later announced as a founding member of the ISA Global Cybersecurity Alliance to help advance readiness and awareness in manufacturing.

Another partnership was formed in November 2019 with Accenture&#x27;s Industry X to help deliver greater industrial supply chain optimization. Simulation software provider Ansys and Rockwell Automation also allied to help customers design simulation-based digital twins of products, processes, and manufacturing.

In May 2023, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Rockwell Automation was under a U.S. federal investigation regarding potential access to its software by the Chinese government through company employees in Dalian.

== Business operations ==
In 2021, Rockwell Automation adjusted its organizational structure into three operating segments—Intelligent Devices, Software &amp; Control, and Lifecycle Services.

Rockwell Automation has three primary areas of business operations:

Allen-Bradley—automated components and integrated control systems for safety, sensing, industrial, power, and motion control.

FactoryTalk—software that supports advanced industrial applications including system design, operations, plant maintenance, and analytics.

LifecycleIQ Services—services to help connect, secure, mobilize, and scale manufacturing operations.

<text>Stephen Dill Lee (September 22, 1833 – May 28, 1908) was an American officer in the Confederate Army, politician, and first president of Mississippi State University from 1880 to 1899. He served as lieutenant general of the Confederate States Army in the Eastern and Western theaters of the American Civil War.

==Early life and education==
Stephen Dill Lee was born in Charleston, South Carolina on September 22, 1833, the son of Thomas Lee and his wife Caroline Allison. Lee was raised in Abbeville, South Carolina. He possibly volunteered for service with the United States Army during the Mexican–American War. Lee entered the United States Military Academy in 1850, graduating four years later the 17th out of 46 cadets.

On July 1, 1854, Lee was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 4th Infantry Regiment. Lee was promoted to first lieutenant on October 31, 1856. He served as the regiment&#x27;s quartermaster from September 18, 1857, to February 8, 1861. He was an adjutant of Florida as well as his regiment&#x27;s quartermaster in 1857 during the Seminole Wars. From 1858 to 1861, he was assigned to the western frontier, posted in the Kansas Territory and then in the newly created Dakota Territory. Lee then resigned his U.S. Army commission twelve days later to join the Confederate States Army.

==American Civil War==
On March 6, he was assigned as the assistant adjutant general and assistant inspector general of the Forces at Charleston. On March 16, he was appointed a captain in the Regular Confederate States Artillery. Beginning on April 11, Lee was aide-de-camp to Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard. That same day, he delivered an ultimatum from Beauregard to U.S. Maj. Robert Anderson, demanding the evacuation of Fort Sumter, which was refused, and after Battle of Fort Sumter, the fort fell on April 14, precipitating the start of the Civil War. According to Carl Sandburg (&quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, vol. 3, pp. 208–209), Captain Lee and three other men with full power from Beauregard to decide what to answer Anderson heard him say he would be starved out in a few days. Anderson offered to &quot;evacuate Fort Sumter in 3 days and avoid the useless effusion of blood.&quot; They could have taken Anderson&#x27;s reply back to Beauregard and have it telegraphed to Jefferson Davis to see if they would wait three days more to see if Anderson would surrender after his food was gone. &quot;It seemed almost as though the 4 men had decided before they came what they would say, which was: &quot;Beauregard will open fire on Fort Sumter in one hour from this time.&quot; This probably was not, as it seems, the last opportunity to avoid war because &quot;Sumter was a symbol, a Chip on the Shoulder.&quot; It was &quot;framed&quot; by Lincoln, and the South was eager to meet the challenge. (ibid, p. 206) Sandburg calls this war &quot;the Second American Revolution.&quot; (ibid, p. vii, p. 26). In the end, Lee cleared South Carolina Confederate soldiers to fire upon the fort, effectively beginning the Civil War.

When Beauregard received permission to organize two regular artillery companies on May 11, Lee was assigned to command one; the other went to Capt. Charles Sidney Winder. Lee&#x27;s company was assigned to Castle Pinckney until May 30, when it was sent to Fort Palmetto on Cole&#x27;s Island, arriving June 1.
In June 1861, Lee resumed his position in the South Carolina Militia, and then in November, he was promoted to the rank of major in the Confederate Army. Lee commanded a light battery in Hampton&#x27;s Legion in Gen. Joseph E. Johnston&#x27;s army later in 1861. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel in March 1862 and was the artillery chief for Maj. Gen. Lafayette McLaws&#x27;s division of the Army of Northern Virginia from April to June 17, and then in the same role under Brig. Gen. John B. Magruder until July.

Lee participated in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, notably during the Battle of Seven Pines on May 31 and June 1, the Battle of Savage&#x27;s Station on June 29, during the Seven Days Battles from June 25 to July 1, and the Battle of Malvern Hill also on July 1. He briefly served in the 4th Virginia Cavalry in July, was promoted to colonel on July 9, and assumed command of an artillery battalion of Maj. Gen. James Longstreet&#x27;s Corps that same month. Under Longstreet, Lee fought in the Second Battle of Manassas that August and then Battle of Antietam on September 17, where his guns played a prominent role in defending the ground near the famed Dunker Church. The following is a summary of Lee&#x27;s involvement at Sharpsburg:

On November 6, 1862, Lee was promoted to the rank of brigadier general. Leaving the artillery branch, Lee briefly led an infantry division during the Battle of Chickasaw Bayou from December 26–29, where he repulsed the attacks of U.S. Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman. Beginning in January 1863, he led a brigade in the Department of Mississippi &amp; Eastern Louisiana until that May when he was ordered to take command of Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton&#x27;s artillery defending access to the Mississippi River at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Lee fought notably during the Battle of Champion Hill on May 16, where he was wounded in the shoulder. Military historian Jon L. Wakelyn praises Lee&#x27;s performance in this action, saying, &quot;he was the hero of the battle of Champion Hills.&quot;
Lee served throughout the 1863 Siege of Vicksburg until Pemberton&#x27;s surrender to Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant on July 4, becoming a prisoner of war. While on parole, he was promoted to the rank of major general on August 3, 1863. Beginning on August 16, Lee was assigned to command the Department of Mississippi &amp; Eastern Louisiana cavalry, and he was officially exchanged on October 13. During that time, General Joseph E. Johnston sent Lee&#x27;s small cavalry force of 2,500 men to Tennessee to reinforce General Braxton Bragg, who was beginning to lay siege to Chattanooga. Lee rode from northern Mississippi into northern Alabama, where he met Confederate cavalry commander Joseph Wheeler who had just conducted a raid through central Tennessee and convinced Lee his plans would be hopeless against the great number of U.S. soldiers in the region.

Lee was then given command of the Department of Alabama &amp; East Louisiana on May 9, 1864. Troops in Lee&#x27;s department under Maj. Gen. Nathan B. Forrest scored a victory at the Battle of Brice&#x27;s Crossroads on June 10 and seriously threatened U.S. supply lines supporting Sherman in Georgia. Lee personally reinforced Forrest, but the combined Confederate force was defeated at the Battle of Tupelo, ensuring the safety of Sherman&#x27;s supply lines.

Lee was promoted to lieutenant general on June 23, 1864, making Lee the youngest at this grade in the Confederate States Army. On July 26 he was assigned to lead the Second Corps, Army of Tennessee, commanded by John Bell Hood. During the Atlanta Campaign, Lee fought at the Battle of Ezra Church on July 28 and was in command of the extended line in southwest Atlanta in August 1864. His troops, with the attachment of William B. Bate&#x27;s Division and a Brigade of Georgia militia, defeated Schofield&#x27;s movement to break the railroad lines at East Point at the Battle of Utoy Creek. For this action, he published a general order recognizing Bate&#x27;s Division for defeating the attack of the combined U.S. XXIII Corps and XIV Corps. He also commanded his corps at the Battle of Jonesborough on August 31 and September 1. Lee fought in the Franklin-Nashville Campaign and was severely wounded in the foot at the Battle of Spring Hill on November 29, but did not give up the command until an organized rearguard took over the post of danger. Regarding the confused and disappointing fight at Spring Hill, Lee considered it &quot;one of the most disgraceful and lamentable occurrences of the war, one that is in my opinion unpardonable.&quot; He then participated in the Battle of Franklin on November 30. Lee&#x27;s men arrived at Franklin at 4:00 pm with orders from Hood to support Benjamin F. Cheatham&#x27;s force if necessary. Meeting with Cheatham, Lee decided the situation was dire and attacked at 9:00 pm, taking serious losses from the U.S. position and Confederate artillery. Following the campaign&#x27;s Battle of Nashville on December 15–16, Lee kept his troops closed up and well in hand despite the general rout of the rest of the Confederate forces. For three consecutive days, they would form the fighting rearguard of the otherwise disintegrated Army of Tennessee. Lee was wounded in the foot by shell fragments on December 17.

Upon recovery, Lee joined Gen. Joseph E. Johnston during the 1865 Carolinas Campaign. On February 9, he married Regina Harrison, with whom he had one child, a son named Blewett Harrison Lee. When the remnants of Johnston&#x27;s Army of Tennessee was reorganized in early 1865, Lee was left without a command matching his rank, and his commission as a lieutenant general was canceled on February 23; however, on March 23 he was appointed a &quot;temporary&quot; lieutenant general. Lee surrendered at that rank with Johnston&#x27;s forces in April and was paroled on May 1.

==Later life==

After the war, Lee settled in Columbus, Mississippi, his wife&#x27;s home state, and his own territorial command during the greater part of the war; there, he devoted himself to planting. He served in the Mississippi State Senate in 1878 and was the first president of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Mississippi from 1880 to 1899. The school was established under his leadership as a segregated institution. Lee was a delegate to the Mississippi Constitutional Convention of 1890. Michael Newton states, &quot;The convention&#x27;s final product, imposed on Mississippi without a popular vote, established a two-dollar poll tax, mandated two years&#x27; residency in the state and one year in the would-be voter&#x27;s district, and denied ballots to convicted felons or tax-defaulters. Section 244 further required that any voter must &quot;be able to read any section of the constitution of this State; or he shall be able to understand the same when read to him, or give a reasonable interpretation thereof.&quot; The net effect, by 1892, was to remove 138,400 blacks and 52,000 whites from the state&#x27;s electoral rolls.&quot; The official constitutional record of the 1890 convention reads that &quot;It is the manifest intention of this Convention to secure to the State of Mississippi &#x27;white supremacy&#x27;&quot;. In 1895 Lee was the first chairman of the Vicksburg National Park Association and was instrumental in the congressional passage of the law creating the national park in 1899. He also was an active member (and from 1904 commander-in-chief) of the United Confederate Veterans society. On March 2, 1900, Lee was president of the Mississippi Historical Society who, under an act of the state legislature of that date, was given authority to appoint the Mississippi Historical Commission, a forerunner of the state agency to act as custodian of the official records and historical materials of the state. In 1902, Lee became a trustee of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History.

In 1887 Lee wrote an article for the first volume of &quot;Battles and Leaders of the Civil War&quot;, and published &quot;Sherman&#x27;s Meridian Expedition and Sooy Smith&#x27;s Raid to West Point&quot; in 1880. Lee died in 1908 in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and was buried in Friendship Cemetery located in Columbus. He fell sick after giving a speech to former U.S. soldiers from Wisconsin and Iowa, four of the regiments whom he had faced in battle 45 years earlier at Vicksburg. The cause of his death was attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage. At the time, Lee was also planning the next reunion of the United Confederate Veterans, held on June 9, 1908.

==Legacy==

Based on Lee&#x27;s familiarity with the three major arms of a Civil War-era army, military historian Ezra J. Warner summarized him as an able and versatile corps commander, writing: &quot;Despite his youth and comparative lack of experience, Lee&#x27;s prior close acquaintanceship with all three branches of the serviceartillery, cavalry, and infantryrendered him one of the most capable corps commanders in the army.&quot; He was entered into the Mississippi Hall of Fame.

Lee is also memorialized with a statue by Henry Hudson Kitson in the Vicksburg National Military Park dedicated in 1909, as well busts in the center of the Drill Field at Mississippi State University and Friendship Cemetery in Columbus. Lee Hall at Mississippi State University is also named in his honor. Some colleagues have called him &#x27;the father of industrial education in the South&#x27;. The Lt. Gen. Stephen D. Lee Camp No. 545 of the Sons of Confederate Veterans in Vicksburg, the Stephen D. Lee&#x27;s Caledonia Rifles Camp No. 2140 in Caledonia and the Captain Stephen D. Lee Chapter No. 301 of the Military Order of the Stars and Bars in Charleston, SC were named in his honor.

On April 25, 1906, in a speech given in New Orleans, Louisiana, Lee gave the following charge to the Sons of Confederate Veterans:

Lee not only promoted the Lost Cause narrative of Southern motivations for secession in public, but as chairman of the United Confederate Veterans&#x27; Historical Committee, he also worked to ensure it was taught in Southern schools. Lee was also unabashedly racist. In a speech at the Columbus courthouse on June 15, 1889, Lee stated, &quot;The question of white supremacy is no issue. That battle has been fought some time ago and won, that the white people should rule, not this State alone but the whole South.&quot; Lee advocated for white women&#x27;s suffrage in Mississippi, but historians argue that this was mostly to ensure the continuation of white domination of the vote. Hattaway quotes Lee on this issue: &quot;We must retain our representation in Congress and the electoral college. We either submit to negro rule, adopt the shotgun policy or change our franchise laws.&quot; Elsewhere, Lee is recorded as stating, &quot;Let us not fool ourselves. We know that the negro appreciates, and is proud of, his right to vote. He will undertake more trouble, and go further, to exercise this privilege than the white man&quot;. Believing that the U.S. Congress would insist on the right of black citizens to vote, Lee&#x27;s solution was not to outright deny the black male citizen the vote – although he did also promote the Jim Crow laws of the 1890 convention instead he sought to ensure that the white citizens would always outvote the black citizens of the South by granting the taxpaying white women the right to vote as well.

<text>The Battle of the Sakarya (), also known as the Battle of the Sangarios (), was an important engagement in the Greco-Turkish War (1919–1922).

The battle went on for 21 days from August 23 to September 13, 1921, close to the banks of the Sakarya River in the immediate vicinity of Polatlı, which is today a district of the Ankara Province. The battle line stretched over 62 miles (100 km).

It is also known as the Officers&#x27; Battle () in Turkey because of the unusually high casualty rate (70–80%) among the officers. Later, it was also called &quot;Melhâme-i Kübrâ&quot; (Islamic equivalent to Armageddon) by Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.

The Battle of the Sakarya is considered as the turning point of the Turkish War of Independence. The Turkish observer, writer, and literary critic İsmail Habip Sevük later described the importance of the battle with these words:
==Background==
The Greek offensive, under King Constantine I as Supreme Commander of the Greek Forces in Asia, was committed on July 16, 1921, and skilfully executed. A feint towards the Turkish right flank at Eskişehir distracted Ismet Pasha just as the major assault fell on the left at Kara Hisar. The Greeks then wheeled their axis to the north, swept towards Eskişehir and rolled up the Turkish defence in a series of frontal assaults that was combined with flanking movements.

Eskişehir fell on July 17 despite a vigorous counterattack by Ismet Pasha, who was determined to fight to the finish. The saner counsels of Mustafa Kemal Ataturk prevailed, however, and Ismet Pasha disengaged with great losses to reach the comparative safety of the Sakarya River, some 30 mi (48 km) to the north and only 50 miles (80 km) from Ankara.

The determining feature of the terrain was the river itself, which flows eastward across the plateau, suddenly curves south and then turns back westwards. The great loop described forms a natural barrier. The river banks are awkward and steep, and bridges were few with only two on the frontal section of the loop. East of the loop, the landscape rises before an invader in rocky, barren ridges and hills towards Ankara. It was in those hills, east of the river that the Turks dug in their defensive positions. The front followed the hills east of the Sakarya River from a point near Polatlı southwards to the place at which the Gök River joins the Sakarya, and then swung at right angles eastwards, following the line of the Gök River. The region was excellent defensive ground.

For the Greeks, the question was one of whether to dig in and rest on their previous gains, or to advance towards Ankara in great effort and destroy the Army of the Grand National Assembly. Either option was difficult to resolve and posed the eternal problems with which the Greek staff had to deal since the beginning of the war. The dangers of extending their lines of communications still further in an inhospitable terrain that killed horses, caused vehicles to break down and prevented the movement of heavy artillery, were obvious. The present front gave the Greeks control of the essential strategic railway and was tactically most favourable, but the Army of the Grand National Assembly had escaped encirclement at Kütahya, so nothing had been settled. For the Greeks, that made the temptation of achieving a knockout blow irresistible.

==Battle==
On August 10, Greek King Constantine I finally committed his forces to an assault against the Sakarya Line. The Greeks marched hard for nine days before they made contact with the enemy. The march included an outflanking manoeuvre via the northern part of Anatolia through the Salt Desert, where food and water scarcely existed; and so the advancing Greek infantry attacked the poor Turkish villages for maize and water, or took meat from the flocks that were pastured on the fringe of the desert.

On August 23, battle was finally joined by the Greeks making contact with the advanced Turkish positions south of the Gök River. The Turkish General Staff had made its headquarters at Polatlı, on the railway a few miles east of the coast of the Sakarya River, and its troops were prepared to resist.

On August 26, the Greeks attacked all along the line. Crossing the shallow Gök, the infantry fought its way step up onto the heights, where every ridge and hill top had to be stormed against strong entrenchments and withering fire.

By September 2, the commanding heights of the key Mount Chal were in Greek hands, but once the enveloping movement against the Turkish left flank had failed, the battle descended to a typical head-on confrontation of infantry, machine guns and artillery. The Greeks launched their main effort in the centre and pushed forward some 10 mi (16 km) in 10 days through the Turks&#x27; second line of defence. Some Greek units came as close as 31 mi (50 km) to the city of Ankara. For the Greeks, this was the peak of their achievement in the Asia Minor Campaign.

For days during the battle, neither ammunition nor food had reached the front because of successful harassment of the Greek lines of communications and raids behind the Greek lines by Turkish cavalry. All of the Greek troops were committed to the battle, but fresh Turkish draftees were still arriving throughout the campaign in response to the Turkish National Movement&#x27;s mobilisation. All of those causes ended the impetus of the Greek attack. For a few days, there was a lull in the fighting during which neither of the exhausted armies could press an attack. Constantine, who commanded the battle personally, was almost taken prisoner by a Turkish patrol.

Astute as ever at the decisive moment, Ataturk assumed personal command of the Turkish forces and led a small counterattack against the Greek left, around Mount Chal, on September 8. The Greek line held, and the attack itself achieved a limited military success, but the fear that presaged a major Turkish effort to outflank their forces, while the severity of the winter was approaching, made Constantine break off the Greek assault on September 14, 1921.

That made Anastasios Papoulas order a general retreat toward Eskişehir and Afyonkarahisar. The Greek troops evacuated Mount Chal, which had been taken at such a cost, and they retired unmolested across the Sakarya River to the positions that they had left a month earlier and took their guns and equipment with them. In the line of the retreating army, nothing was left that could benefit the Turks. Railways and bridges were blown up and villages were burnt in what developed into a scorched-earth policy.

After the Greek retreat, the Turkish forces managed to retake Sivrihisar on September 20, Aziziye on September 22 and Bolvadin and Çay on September 24.

==Aftermath==

The retreat from Sakarya marked the end of the Greeks&#x27; hopes to impose a settlement on Turkey by the force of arms. In May 1922, Papoulas and his complete staff resigned and was replaced by General Georgios Hatzianestis, who proved much more inept than his predecessor.

On the other hand, Mustafa Kemal returned to Ankara, where the Grand National Assembly awarded him the rank of Field Marshal of the Army and the title of Gazi to render its honours as the saviour of the Turkish nation.

According to the speech that was delivered years later before the same National Assembly at the Second General Conference of the Republican People&#x27;s Party, which took part from October 15 to 20, 1927, Ataturk was said to have ordered that &quot;not an inch of the country should be abandoned until it was drenched with the blood of the citizens&quot; once he realised that the Turkish Army was losing ground rapidly and that virtually no natural defences were left between the battle line and Ankara.

Lord Curzon argued that the military situation became a stalemate with time tending favour the Turks. Their reputation by the British was improving. In his opinion, the Turkish nationalists were more than ready to negotiate.

The Ankara government then signed the Treaty of Kars with the Russians and the most important Treaty of Ankara with the French, which reduced the Turkish army&#x27;s front notably in the Cilician theatre and allowed it to concentrate against the Greeks to the west.

For the Turkish troops, the battle was the turning point of the war, which would develop in a series of important military clashes against the Greeks and drive the invaders out of Asia Minor during the Turkish War of Independence. The Greeks could do nothing but fight to secure their retreat. Next year, on August 26, the Turkish offensive started with Battle of Dumlupınar. Ataturk dispatched his army on a drive to the coast of the Aegean Sea to pursue the Greek Army. That would culminate in the direct assault of Smyrna from September 9 to 11, 1922.

The war ended by the withdrawal of the Greeks from Asia Minor, as would be formalised by the Treaty of Lausanne, on 24 July 1923.

<doc id="1115529" wikidata="Q191832" url="?curid=1115529" title="Aldan (river)">
<text>The Aldan (Sakha and ) is the second-longest right tributary of the Lena in the Sakha Republic in eastern Siberia. The river is long, of which around is navigable. It has a drainage basin of . 

The river was part of the River Route to Okhotsk. In 1639 Ivan Moskvitin ascended the rivers Aldan and Maya and crossed to the Ulya to reach the Sea of Okhotsk.

Its basin is known for gold and for Cambrian fossils.

== Etymology ==
Previously, a version of the origin from the Turkic-Mongolian word altan, altyn in the meaning of &quot;gold&quot; was spread, then a hypothesis appeared of the origin of the hydronym Aldan (in the variant Allan) from the Evenk oldo, ollo — &quot;fish&quot;. Another explanation: aldan is a coastal spring ice (evenk).

==Course==
The Aldan rises in the Stanovoy Mountains southwest of Neryungri. It flows roughly in a northeast / ENE direction south of the Lena Plateau across the Aldan Highlands, where it forms the northern border of the Sunnagyn Range. Then it flows past Aldan and through Tommot, Ust-Maya, Eldikan and Khandyga before turning northwest. In its last stretch it flanks the southern slopes of the Verkhoyansk Range and joins the Lena near Batamay.

===Tributaries===
The river&#x27;s main tributaries are the following:

<text>Richard Hancock Moore (born Oxford, Granville County, North Carolina, August 30, 1960) was the North Carolina State Treasurer from 2001–2009. He was first elected to that post in 2000 and re-elected in 2004.

==Career==
Moore earned both his undergraduate and law degrees from Wake Forest University and a graduate diploma in accounting and finance from the London School of Economics.

A former assistant U.S. Attorney, Moore previously served in North Carolina government as a member of the North Carolina House of Representatives and as head of the North Carolina Department of Crime Control and Public Safety under former Governor Jim Hunt, before being elected state treasurer in 2000. In 1994, he ran for United States House of Representatives but lost in that year&#x27;s Republican wave to David Funderburk. As Secretary of Crime Control &amp; Public Safety, Moore managed the state response to and recovery from several natural disasters, particularly Hurricane Floyd. He is the co-author of a book, &quot;Faces from the Flood: Hurricane Floyd Remembered&quot;.

As Treasurer, Moore championed a national movement to protect shareholder rights against Wall Street corporate abuses. He authored investment and mutual fund protection principles which have been adopted by pension fund managers across the country. His efforts led to his appointment on the executive board of the New York Stock Exchange as the only public sector member, and he has served on the board of NYSE Regulation since its inception in 2005. He was also named the country&#x27;s Top Public Official of the Year in 2004 by Governing Magazine, and profiled by U.S. News &amp; World Report (June 7, 2004). In 2005, Moore was named as a finalist for Institutional Investor&#x27;s Excellence in Investment Management Award.

As North Carolina&#x27;s Treasurer and Chief Investment Officer, Moore managed more than $70 billion in pension funds. The funds were rated either the first or second best funded pension plans in the country by Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s throughout Moore&#x27;s tenure. In his final year as Treasurer (2008), the funds outperformed their peer average by more than 900 basis points. 
Moore ran for Governor of North Carolina in 2008. He lost the Democratic primary to Lt. Gov. Beverly Perdue on May 6, 2008. In 2012, Moore said he would consider seeking the Democratic nomination for governor again, but he did not ultimately run.

After leaving office, Moore was named to the Board of Trustees of Wake Forest University, his alma mater.

In 2012, Moore became Chief Executive Officer of First Bancorp, a $10.6 billion community bank with more than 100 branches in North and South Carolina. Since taking over, First Bank&#x27;s market cap has grown from $150 million to $1.33 billion. In 2019, he was named CEO of the Year by Business N.C Magazine.

==Personal life==
Moore and his wife, Noel, have three children: Will (the eldest), Charles, and Mary. Moore is a grandson of former U.S. Rep. Franklin Wills Hancock, Jr.

Eisenhower Fellowships selected Richard Moore as a USA Eisenhower Fellow in 2006.

<doc id="1115535" wikidata="Q2915385" url="?curid=1115535" title="Glass family">
<text>The Glass family is a fictional family appearing in several of J. D. Salinger&#x27;s short fictions. All but one of the Glass family stories were first published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. They appear in the short story collections &quot;Nine Stories&quot;, &quot;Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction&quot; and &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;.

==Members==
The Glass family, from eldest to youngest:
*Les and Bessie Glass (née Gallagher): Retired vaudeville performers. Les is Australian (mentioned in &quot;Hapworth 16, 1924&quot;) and Jewish, and is in the entertainment business. He is not mentioned often in the stories, but is criticized by Seymour in &quot;Hapworth 16, 1924.&quot; Bessie, the matriarch, is Irish, and is characterized as consistently worried about the fact that her children are talented and yet largely unable to assimilate into society. They are the parents of the seven children:
* Seymour Glass (February 1917 – March 18, 1948): The eldest, Seymour is featured in &quot;Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters and Seymour: An Introduction&quot; and &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;. He is the author of the letter that comprises &quot;Hapworth 16, 1924&quot; and is the main character in &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish.&quot; Seymour was a spiritual savant and brilliant intellectual, and became a professor at Columbia at 20. Along with his siblings he was a regular star on the radio program &quot;It&#x27;s a Wise Child&quot;. He fought in the European Theatre of World War II, and was deeply scarred by the experience. In 1941 he attempts suicide by slitting his wrists, but fails, as described in &quot;Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters&quot; and &quot;Seymour: an Introduction&quot;. He elopes with Muriel Fedder on June 4, 1942. In &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish,&quot; he commits suicide while the couple are on a second honeymoon in Florida. Muriel is asleep on the bed beside him at the time. However, in &quot;Seymour: An Introduction&quot; his younger brother Buddy (who claims authorship of the story) suggests the depiction of Seymour in &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish&quot; more closely resembles Buddy than Seymour.
* Webb Gallagher &quot;Buddy&quot; Glass (born 1919): The narrator of &quot;Zooey&quot; and protagonist in &quot;Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters&quot; and &quot;Seymour: An Introduction.&quot; It is revealed in the latter that he wrote at least three stories collected in &quot;Nine Stories&quot;: &quot;A Perfect Day for Bananafish,&quot; &quot;Down at the Dinghy&quot; and &quot;Teddy.&quot; He also claims credit for &quot;Franny,&quot; and it is suggested in &quot;Seymour&quot; that he wrote &quot;The Catcher in the Rye&quot;. Buddy is often considered to be Salinger&#x27;s alter ego. He lives in upstate New York and teaches English at a rural women&#x27;s college. He also volunteers his time to instruct some of the faculty of his college in Mahayana Buddhism. Buddy and Seymour were born only two years apart, spent most of their youths living together, and were very close before Seymour&#x27;s suicide in 1948.
* Beatrice &quot;Boo Boo&quot; Glass Tannenbaum (born 1920): Married, mother of three children, appears centrally in &quot;Down at the Dinghy,&quot; is mentioned in &quot;Hapworth 16, 1924,&quot; and is often referenced in &quot;Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters&quot; as the &quot;seafaring&quot; sibling currently occupying the New York apartment where much of the story&#x27;s action takes place. She &quot;modestly prefers to be referred to as a Tuckahoe homemaker.&quot;
* Walter F. &quot;Walt&quot; Glass (1921 – 1945): The twin brother of Waker Glass. He was an American soldier who died in Occupied Japan in late fall of 1945, at the age of 24, when a stove he was packaging exploded, an event that Buddy Glass refuses to address. Walt is described by his girlfriend in &quot;Uncle Wiggily in Connecticut.&quot; He was also described in &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot; as being the only truly &quot;lighthearted&quot; son in the family.
* Waker Glass (born 1921): The twin brother, born twelve minutes after Walter. A Roman Catholic monk of the Carthusian order. Little is known about Waker, because, though he is mentioned in many of the stories, none have been written specifically about him. It is known that Waker took part in a &quot;conscientious objectors&#x27; camp in Maryland&quot;.
* Zachary Martin &quot;Zooey&quot; Glass (born 1929): Title character of &quot;Zooey&quot;, in which he is 25 years old. He is an actor, and (according to himself) the most attractive of all the children. Zooey also says that he and Buddy were &quot;too clever&quot; for their own good. Boo Boo describes Zooey as &quot;the blue-eyed Jewish-Irish Mohican scout who died in your arms at the roulette table at Monte Carlo.&quot; He is portrayed as being rather arrogant and particularly insensitive to his mother, Bessie, frequently swearing at her and calling her &quot;fatty.&quot; He is misanthropic, which he attributes to Seymour and Buddy&#x27;s imposition of their college-age infatuation with Eastern mysticism on him and Franny as children.
* Frances &quot;Franny&quot; Glass (born 1934): The title character of &quot;Franny&quot;, in which she is a 20-year-old college student and actress. In &quot;Franny and Zooey&quot;, she is depicted reading &quot;The Way of a Pilgrim&quot;, an anonymous Orthodox Christian classic, which contributes to her spiritual and emotional breakdown.

All the children are precocious, and appeared on fictional radio quiz show &quot;It&#x27;s a Wise Child&quot;, which, according to the stories, sent all seven Glass children through college. At least one of the children appeared on the show from 1927 to 1943, beginning with Seymour and Buddy. &quot;Raise High the Roof Beam, Carpenters&quot; says that each child appeared on the show under a pseudonym as the Black children. Seymour was known as Billy Black, and Walt was Georgie Black.

The Glass family lives in New York City; the children spent most of their childhood in an apartment on the Upper East Side.

<text>The Central Business District (CBD) is a neighborhood of the city of New Orleans, Louisiana, United States.

The CBD is a subdistrict of the French Quarter/CBD area. Its boundaries, as defined by the City Planning Commission are Iberville, Decatur and Canal Streets to the north; the Mississippi River to the east; the New Orleans Morial Convention Center, Julia and Magazine Streets, and the Pontchartrain Expressway to the south; and South Claiborne Avenue, Cleveland Street, as well as South and North Derbigny Streets to the west. It is the equivalent of what many cities call their downtown, although in New Orleans &quot;downtown&quot; or &quot;down town&quot; historically used to mean all portions of the city downriver from Canal Street (in the direction or flow of the Mississippi River). In recent decades, however, use of the catch-all &quot;downtown&quot; adjective to describe neighborhoods downriver from Canal Street has largely ceased, having been replaced in usage by individual neighborhood names (like Bywater).

Originally developed as the largely-residential Faubourg Ste. Marie (&quot;English:&quot; St. Mary Suburb) in the late 18th century, the modern Central Business District is today a dynamic, mixed-use neighborhood, the home of professional offices in skyscrapers, specialty and neighborhood retail stores, numerous restaurants and clubs, and thousands of residents inhabiting restored, historic commercial and industrial buildings.

A part of the area is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the New Orleans Lower Central Business District.

==History==
Streets in the Central Business District (originally &quot;Faubourg Ste. Marie&quot;) were initially platted in the late 18th century, representing the first expansion of New Orleans beyond its original French Quarter footprint. Significant investment began in earnest after the Louisiana Purchase of 1803, as people from other parts of the United States flocked to the city. Consequently, the district began to be referred to as the American Sector.

While traditionally Canal Street was viewed as the dividing line between the French Quarter and the American Sector, legally both sides of Canal Street are today considered part of the Central Business District for zoning and regulatory purposes. Through the 19th and into the 20th century, the Central Business District continued developing almost without pause. By the mid-20th century most professional offices in the region were located downtown, the hub of a well-developed public transit system. Canal Street was the primary retail destination for New Orleanians, as well as for residents of the surrounding region. Local and regional department stores Maison Blanche, D.H. Holmes, Godchaux&#x27;s, Gus Mayer, Labiche&#x27;s, Kreeger&#x27;s, and Krauss anchored numerous well-known specialty retailers including Rubenstein Bros., Adler&#x27;s Jewelry, Koslow&#x27;s, Rapp&#x27;s, and Werlein&#x27;s Music. National retailers like Kress, Woolworth, and Walgreens were present alongside local drugstore K&amp;B. Sears operated a large store one block off Canal, on Baronne Street. Bookstores, theaters, and movie palaces abounded with the neon marquees of the Saenger, Loews State, RKO Orpheum, Joy, and Civic theaters nightly casting multi-colored lights onto surrounding sidewalks.

In the 1950s, six-lane Loyola Avenue was constructed as an extension of Elk Place, cutting a swath through a low-income residential district and initially hosting the city&#x27;s new civic center complex. The late-1960s widening of Poydras Street was undertaken to create another six-lane central area circulator for vehicular traffic, as well as to accommodate modern high-rise construction. The City of New Orleans partook in transforming the district from 1973 to 1993, in a collaboration between public and private sectors to spark active community participation. The portion of the CBD closer to the Mississippi River and upriver from Poydras Street is known as the Warehouse District, because it was heavily devoted to warehousing and manufacturing before shipping became containerized. The 1984 World&#x27;s Fair drew attention to the then semi-derelict district, resulting in steady investment and redevelopment from the mid-1980s onward. Many of the old 19th-century warehouses have been converted into hotels, restaurants, condominiums, and art galleries. For further information, read about Loft 523, a boutique hotel.

Notable structures in the CBD include the Greek Revival Gallier Hall (the city&#x27;s former city hall); Caesars Superdome; the Smoothie King Center; the city&#x27;s present-day, International style city hall; and Hancock Whitney Center, the city&#x27;s tallest building and headquarters for Royal Dutch Shell&#x27;s Gulf of Mexico Exploration and Production. Other significant attractions are the postmodern Piazza d&#x27;Italia, Harrah&#x27;s Casino now Caesar&#x27;s New Orleans, the Four Seasons Hotel which was the World Trade Center of New Orleans, the U.S. Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, St. Patrick&#x27;s Church, the Hibernia Bank Building, and the former New Orleans Cotton Exchange.

The principal public park in the CBD is Lafayette Square which faces both Gallier Hall and the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. There are other public spaces like Duncan Plaza, Elk Place, the Piazza d&#x27;Italia, Tivoli Circle, Mississippi River Heritage Park, Spanish Plaza, and the Richard and Annette Bloch Cancer Survivors Plaza. Museums include The National World Ward II Museum, the Ogden Museum of Southern Art, the Louisiana Children&#x27;s Museum, the New Orleans Contemporary Arts Center, and the Confederate Memorial Hall Museum.

New Orleans CBD was one of the few areas of New Orleans which escaped the catastrophic flooding of 2005&#x27;s Hurricane Katrina.

==Geography==
The Central Business District is located at and has an elevation of . As is true of most of metropolitan New Orleans, the parts of the district nearer the river are higher in elevation than areas further removed from it. According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of . of which is land and (10.17%) of which is water.

===Adjacent neighborhoods===
* Iberville Development (north)
* French Quarter (north)
* Lower Garden District (south)
* Central City (south)
* Tulane/Gravier (west)

===Boundaries===
The City Planning Commission defines the boundaries of the Central Business District as these streets: Iberville Street, Decatur Street, Canal Street, the Mississippi River, the New Orleans Morial Convention Center, Julia Street, Magazine Street, the Pontchartrain Expressway, South Claiborne Avenue, Cleveland Avenue, and also South Derbigny Street and North Derbigny Street.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 3,435 inhabitants of the census tracts best corresponding to the boundaries of the New Orleans Downtown Development District. The population density was 1,692 /mi2 (664 /km2). Another 4,142 inhabitants of the adjacent French Quarter neighborhood were recorded in the 2000 Census. The CBD, its subdistricts (e.g., the Warehouse District), and the bordering neighborhoods of Tremé, the French Quarter, and the Lower Garden District had 21,630 residents, according to the 2000 Census.

==Government and infrastructure==
The New Orleans City Hall and surrounding structures, including the &quot;circa&quot;-1960, architecturally award-winning Main Branch of the New Orleans Public Library face Duncan Plaza, an exercise in 1950s-style urban renewal embodying then-mayor Chep Morrison&#x27;s desire to create a modern civic center. The New Orleans Civic Center is today much diminished due to the Louisiana Supreme Court building being torn down in the wake of the court&#x27;s 2004 departure for the French Quarter, the Louisiana State office building having suffered the same fate, and Duncan Plaza itself having been fenced off.

The United States Postal Service operates the New Orleans Main Post Office at 701 Loyola Avenue in the CBD. 
The Union Passenger Terminal is the terminus for three of Amtrak&#x27;s long-distance trains, the City of New Orleans train, the Crescent train, and since 2005 the Sunset Limited (with the elimination, due to Katrina damage, of the eastbound portion of the Sunset Limited route), and also offers inter-city bus service via Greyhound Lines.

Interstate Highway access is provided by I-10, via the Claiborne and Pontchartrain Expressways. When I-10 curves to the east by the Louisiana Superdome and becomes the Claiborne Expressway, elevated above N. Claiborne Avenue, the Pontchartrain Expressway continues as U.S. Route 90 Business and crosses the Mississippi River on the twin-bridge Crescent City Connection.

Significant thoroughfares in the CBD include St. Charles Avenue, Camp Street, Carondelet Street, Gravier Street, Poydras Street, Tchoupitoulas Street, Howard Avenue, and Canal Street. Prior to the 1980s, the intersection of Gravier and Carondelet streets was the &quot;de facto&quot; heart of the city&#x27;s financial district. Though still a vibrant area, that part of the CBD witnessed the migration of much business slightly upriver to Poydras Street, as many modern high-rise office towers were constructed there in the 1970s and 1980s. The widening of Loyola Avenue, Poydras Street and O&#x27;Keefe Avenue aimed to simultaneously create an effective downtown circulator high capacity road network for automobile traffic and make room for large-scale redevelopment (e.g., Duncan Plaza, Caesar&#x27;s Superdome). However, many of the development sites created in the wake of the improvements were never built upon, leaving a noticeable and unfortunate quantity of surface parking lots along those widened streets.

==Economy==
Entergy, the region&#x27;s sole Fortune 500 firm, maintains its headquarters in the CBD, as does Reily Foods Company which markets Luzianne products and Standard Coffee. Other companies headquartered downtown are Freeport-McMoRan, Pan American Life Insurance, Superior Energy Services, TurboSquid, iSeatz, Historic Restoration Inc. (HRI Properties), Tidewater Marine, Energy Partners Ltd., Intermarine, IMTT (International-Matex Tank Terminals), International Coffee Corp., and The Receivables Exchange.

The CBD hosts the New Orleans I.P. (Intellectual Property), home to many creative industries firms, and a substantial number of bioscience companies are established at the New Orleans BioInnovation Center inside of BioDistrict New Orleans. The regional economic alliance Greater New Orleans, Inc. (GNO Inc.), the New Orleans metropolitan area&#x27;s lead economic development entity for the ten-parish New Orleans region, is also headquartered downtown as is the New Orleans Business Alliance (NOLA BA), the public-private partnership agency leading economic development efforts for the city proper. The World Trade Center of New Orleans (WTCNO) began operating in 1943 and at one time was at 2 Canal Street. That location is now the Four Seasons Hotel and the WTCNO is at One Canal Place.

==Diplomatic missions==
The Consulate of Mexico in New Orleans is in the CBD. The consulate re-opened in 2008 because of a dramatic increase in the local Mexican immigrant population, many of whom arrived in the wake of Hurricane Katrina to assist in rebuilding the city.

In addition to Mexico, France maintains a consulate in downtown New Orleans, a reflection of the long-standing ties between that country and Louisiana in addition to France&#x27;s role as the founder of New Orleans in 1718. At one time the Consulate-General of Japan, New Orleans was located in the Entergy Tower. In 2006 Japan announced that it was moving the consulate to Nashville. The Japanese Government moved it to be closer to industries and operations owned by Japanese companies.

Honorary consuls for numerous other nations are in the CBD.

<text>The Marquette Underwater Preserve was established in 1990 to promote conservation of the submerged historical resources in Lake Superior near Marquette, Michigan. The preserve is composed of two separate units, the Marquette Unit and the Huron Islands Unit. The Marquette Unit extends along approximately 24 miles of Michigan shoreline out to the 200-foot depth contour. The Huron Islands Unit surrounds a group of granite peaks about 12 miles from shore. The Michigan Underwater Preserve Council oversees activities relating to all of Michigan&#x27;s underwater preserves.

The preserve is open to scuba divers.

== History ==
Marquette, Michigan became a major shipping port after iron ore was discovered in the area in 1844, and marine traffic in the area has been heavy ever since. Heavy traffic combined with not-too-uncommon thick fog and gale force winds has resulted in numerous shipwrecks.

<text>Park Street Congregational Church, founded in 1809, is a historic and active evangelical congregational church in Downtown Boston, Massachusetts, United States. The Park Street Church is a member of the Conservative Congregational Christian Conference. Church membership records are private, but the congregation has over 1,200 members. The church is located at 1 Park Street, at the corner of Tremont Street.

==History==
Park Street Church is a stop on Boston&#x27;s Freedom Trail. The founding of the church is dated to 1804 when the &quot;Religious Improvement Society&quot; began weekly meetings with lectures and prayer. The society organized the church on February 27, 1809. Twenty-six local people, mostly former members of the Old South Meeting House, wanted to create a church with orthodox Trinitarian theology.

The church&#x27;s cornerstone was laid on May 1, 1809, and construction was completed by the end of the year, under the guidance of Peter Banner (architect), Benajah Young (chief mason) and Solomon Willard (woodcarver). Banner took inspiration from several early pattern books, and his design is reminiscent of a London church by Christopher Wren. Park Street church&#x27;s steeple rises to , and remains a landmark visible from several Boston neighborhoods. The church was the tallest building in the United States from 1810 to 1828. For much of the early 19th century, it was the first landmark travelers saw when approaching Boston.

The church is next to the historic Granary Burying Ground and was site of granary building for which the burial grounds was named. The first worship service was held on January 10, 1810. The church became known as &quot;Brimstone Corner&quot;, in part because of the fervent missionary character of its preaching, and in part because of the storage of gunpowder during the War of 1812.

Park Street Church has a strong tradition of missions, evangelical doctrine, and application of Scripture to social issues, as well as a notable list of firsts. Edward Dorr Griffin (1770–1837) served as the first pastor of the Park Street Church and preached a famous series of Sunday evening sermons attacking the New Divinity. In 1816, Park Street Church joined with Old South Church to form the City Mission Society, a social service society to serve Boston&#x27;s urban poor.

In 1826, Edward Beecher, the brother of Harriet Beecher Stowe and son of Lyman Beecher, a notable abolitionist, became pastor of the church. On July 4, 1829, William Lloyd Garrison delivered his Address to the Colonization Society at Park Street, making his first major public statement against slavery. From 1829–1831, Lowell Mason, a notable Christian composer, served as choirmaster and organist. The church hosted the debut of &quot;My Country, &#x27;Tis of Thee&quot;, also known as &quot;America&quot;, by Samuel Francis Smith on July 4, 1831. Park Street also played a role in founding the first &quot;Homeland&quot; or American Mission to the Sandwich Islands (now Hawaii), where that church still stands; the Handel and Haydn Society started there. Benjamin E. Bates, an industrialist who founded Bates College in Maine in 1855, was a Sunday school teacher and active attendant of Park Street in the mid-19th century. In 1857–58, evangelist Charles Finney led a revival at Park Street which led the pastor, Andrew Leete Stone, to experience a spiritual awakening.
Gleason Archer, a prominent inerrantist theologian was the assistant pastor of Park Street from 1945 to 1948, and his father, Suffolk University founder Gleason Archer Sr., served as president of the Park Street Men&#x27;s Club in the 1920s. In 1949, Billy Graham&#x27;s first transcontinental mid-century crusade began at Park Street. Harold J. Ockenga, notable theologian and co-architect of the (Neo-)Evangelical movement was the senior pastor from 1936 to 1969, and during this time co-founded Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary with Billy Graham, co-founded Fuller Theological Seminary, the National Association of Evangelicals, War Relief (which later became World Relief), and the Christian publication &quot;Christianity Today&quot;.

In 1974, the church built a Church Ministries Building at 1 Park Street beside the main edifice. Designed in a modernist architectural style by Stahl/Bennett Associates with a concrete structure, window-walls and purplish brick facing, the building is described by the Boston Preservation Alliance as follows: &quot;The Church Ministries Building Addition to Park Street Church breaks dramatically with its surroundings in style, while relating coherently to it in materials. The building rises with large panes of glass stretching across its narrow facade and handsome red brick covering the rest of the building. The ground floor is glass and looks out to the Granary Burial Ground beyond the building to the rear&quot;.

In the 1990s, the church purchased the 2 and 3 Park Street buildings from Houghton-Mifflin.

==Today==
The church still holds to its Statement of Faith adopted by the church in 1877 and readopted in 2003. After 200 years, the church is still engaged in current social issues. For example, Park Street Church helped launch a private high school in Hyde Park, Boston Trinity Academy, in 2002, to help address the educational needs of inner-city Boston (more than 70% of its students are on scholarship and more than 50% are minorities); it hosts many English as a Second Language classes during the week; it has and supports ministries for the homeless, such as Boston Rescue Mission, and Park Street&#x27;s HOME ministry on Thursday evenings and Saturday mornings; it partners with crisis pregnancy centers Daybreak Pregnancy Resource Center and A Woman&#x27;s Concern; it provides English classes for international students and immigrants. There are many ministry focus areas: children and teens, young adults, undergraduates, international and graduate students, as well as introductory classes on Christianity and adult education classes. There is also a ministry called Alive in Christ, an affiliate of Hope for Wholeness.

Park Street is an international congregation, with members from more than 60 countries. Park Street believes strongly in education integrated with faith, so it is associated with Park Street Kids, Park Street School, and Boston Trinity Academy, as well as partnering with Campus Crusade for Christ and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship for undergraduate and graduate ministries, and a long-time partnership with Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary.

Boston Mayor Menino announced February 27, 2009, as Park Street Day in honor of its bicentennial.

From when his tenure began in 2020 through 2024, current Senior Minister Mark Booker was the center of disagreements with many of his staff and church leaders. Things came to a head with the firing of Associate Minister Michael Balboni, the public sharing of internal documents alleging spiritual abuse, and a months long process to petition a special meeting to review the Board of Elders&#x27; decision to fire Balboni. In a non-binding vote Booker garnered the support of 2/3 of members present at the 2024 Annual Meeting. The resignations of three additional ministers and testimonies of former ministers resulted in a majority of members present at a subsequent meeting rejecting the assertion that Mark Booker is not disqualified from pastoral ministry. Many of the church leadership remain steadfast in their support for Mark as their Senior Minister.

<doc id="1115555" wikidata="Q158776" url="?curid=1115555" title="Carpinus betulus">
<text>Carpinus betulus, the European or common hornbeam, is a species of tree in the birch family Betulaceae, native to Western Asia and central, eastern, and southern Europe, including southern England. It requires a warm climate for good growth, and occurs only at elevations up to . It grows in mixed stands with oak, and in some areas beech, and is also a common tree in scree forests. Hornbeam was also known as yoke elm. Together with &quot;Carpinus orientalis&quot; and &quot;Carpinus austrobalcanica&quot;, it is one of the three hornbeams founded in Europe.

==Description==
It is a deciduous small to medium-size tree reaching heights of , rarely , and often has a fluted and crooked trunk. The bark is smooth and greenish-grey, even in old trees. The buds, unlike those of the beech, are long at the most, and pressed close to the twig. The leaves are alternate, long, with prominent veins giving a distinctive corrugated texture, and a serrated margin. It is monoecious, and the wind-pollinated male and female catkins appear in early summer after the leaves. The fruit is a small long nut, partially surrounded by a three-pointed leafy involucre long; it matures in autumn.

==Distribution==
Hornbeam is considered native from Western Asia and throughout Europe. The species prefers a warm climate, and only naturally occurs below in elevation. It is a common tree in scree forests.

Hornbeam was frequently coppiced and pollarded in the past in England. It is still infrequently managed using these traditional methods, but mainly for non-commercial conservation purposes. As a woodland tree traditionally managed in this way, it is particularly frequent in the ancient woodlands of south Essex, Hertfordshire and north Kent where it typically occupies more than half of most ancient woods and wood pastures.

There are a number of notable forests where &quot;C. betulus&quot; is a dominant tree species, among which include Epping Forest in the United Kingdom, and Halltorps hage in Öland, Sweden.

===Fossil record===
Three fossil fruits of &quot;Carpinus betulus&quot; have been extracted from borehole samples of the Middle Miocene fresh water deposits in Nowy Sacz Basin, West Carpathians, Poland.

==Ecology==

In England, trees appear to prefer soils with a pH from 3.6 to 4.6 but tolerate up to 7.6. They are found on soils with moderate clay content and avoid soils with particularly high or low clay content.
&quot;Carpinus betulus&quot; likes full sun or partial shade, moderate soil fertility and moisture. It has a shallow, wide-spreading root system and is marked by the production of stump sprouts when cut back.

The seeds often do not germinate until the spring of the second year after sowing. The hornbeam is a prolific seeder and is marked by vigorous natural regeneration.

===Associated species===
Hornbeam grows in mixed stands with oak, and in some areas beech. The leaves provide food for some animals, including Lepidoptera such as the case-bearer moth &quot;Coleophora anatipennella&quot;.

This tree has been associated with the poisonous mushroom &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;, better known as the death-cap mushroom, which grow around the trunk after hornbeams mature. When ingested, death-cap mushrooms can cause extreme medical conditions and death. Death-cap mushrooms can be mistaken for other edible mushrooms (&quot;Amanita princeps&quot;).

==Cultivation and uses==
&quot;Carpinus betulus&quot; is widely cultivated as an ornamental tree, for planting in gardens and parks throughout north west Europe. Because it stands up well to cutting back and has dense foliage, it has been much used in landscape gardening, mainly as tall hedges and for topiary. It was the classic tree used in French formal gardens for hedges in bosquets, as in the Gardens of Versailles, and in their English equivalent, the garden wilderness.

There are several cultivars, notably &#x27;Fastigiata&#x27; or &#x27;Pyramidalis&#x27;, a tree when young, which has become a popular urban street tree in the United Kingdom and other countries. &#x27;Frans Fontaine&#x27; is a similar fastigiate cultivar. Both the species &quot;C. betulus&quot; and the cultivar &#x27;Fastigiata&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

As early as Roman times, but also during the Thirty Years&#x27; War, defensive hedges (Landwehr) in Central Europe were largely planted from hornbeams. The bushes were chopped down with axes and broken down. The trees would then grow together with blackberries, dog roses, and other thorny bushes into impenetrable hedges. In the 11th century, for example, the Electorate of Mainz set up a large defensive forest called the . Many place names with the endings -hagen and -hain refer to such landwehrs.

Hildegard of Bingen wrote of hornbeam being used as a plant in traditional medicine to treat vitiligo. The heated hornbeam chips were pressed onto the affected skin areas. Hornbeam is used in Bach flower remedies as a treatment for exhaustion.

The wood is heavy and hard, and is used for tools and building constructions. It also burns hot and slowly, making it very suitable for firewood. This was the reason for lopping and hence indirectly the saving of Epping Forest, where the hornbeam was a favoured pollarding tree. The wood has a very high calorific value of around 2,300 kWh/RM.

==Notable examples==
*&quot;The Last Tree&quot; - The only tree that survived the devastation of the Battle of Delville Wood in 1916. It is preserved as part of the Delville Wood South African National Memorial near Longueval.
*&quot;Lincoln&#x27;s Hornbeam&quot; - Planted by President Lincoln at the United States Botanic Garden in the Capitol grounds, Washington D.C.

<doc id="1115560" wikidata="Q157641" url="?curid=1115560" title="Alnus incana">
<text>Alnus incana, the grey alder, tag alder or speckled alder, is a species of multi-stemmed, shrubby tree in the birch family, with a wide range across the cooler parts of the Northern Hemisphere. Tolerant of wetter soils, it can slowly spread with runners and is a common sight in swamps and wetlands. 

==Description==
It is a small- to medium-sized tree tall with smooth grey bark even in old age, its life span being a maximum of 60 to 100 years. The leaves are matte green, ovoid, long and broad. The flowers are catkins, appearing early in spring before the leaves emerge, the male catkins pendulous and long, the female catkins long and one cm broad when mature in late autumn. The seeds are small, long, and light brown with a narrow encircling wing. The grey alder has a shallow root system, and is marked not only by vigorous production of stump suckers, but also by root suckers, especially in the northern parts of its range. The wood resembles that of the black alder (&quot;Alnus glutinosa&quot;), but is somewhat paler and of little economic value.

==Subspecies==
There are four to six subspecies, some treated as separate species by some authors:
* &quot;Alnus incana&quot; subsp. &quot;incana&quot;; grey alder – Northern Europe and northwestern Asia, and central and southern Europe in mountains, mainly in the regions of the Alps, Carpathians and the Caucasus
* &quot;Alnus incana&quot; subsp. &quot;hirsuta&quot; (=&quot;A. hirsuta&quot; ); Manchurian alder – In mountains of Northeast Asia and Central Asia
* &quot;Alnus incana&quot; subsp. &quot;kolaensis&quot; – Subarctic northeast Europe
* &quot;Alnus incana&quot; subsp. &quot;oblongifolia&quot; (=&quot;Alnus oblongifolia&quot;); Arizona alder – Madrean Sky Islands of southwestern North America, in Arizona, New Mexico, and Northwestern Mexico
* &quot;Alnus incana&quot; subsp. &quot;rugosa&quot; (=&quot;A. rugosa&quot; ); speckled alder – Much of Canada below the tree line, and the Northeastern United States
* &quot;Alnus incana&quot; subsp. &quot;tenuifolia&quot; (=&quot;A. tenuifolia&quot; ); mountain alder, or thinleaf alder – Western North America, including New Mexico to California and Alaska; the roots have nitrogen-fixing nodules.

==Ecology==
&quot;Alnus incana&quot; is a light-demanding, fast-growing tree that grows well on poorer soils. In central Europe, it is a colonist of alluvial land alongside mountain brooks and streams, occurring at elevations up to . However, it does not require moist soil, and will also colonize screes and shallow stony slopes. In the northern part of its range, it is a common tree species at sea level in forests, abandoned fields and on lakeshores. Several species of Lepidoptera use grey alder as a food plant for their caterpillars. In the boreal forest area of Canada, &quot;A. incana&quot; is often associated with black spruce in the forest type termed black spruce–speckled alder. The larvae of the alder woolly sawfly sometimes cause considerable defoliation to the grey alder.

&quot;A. rugosa&quot; provides cover for wildlife, is browsed by deer and moose, and the seeds are eaten by birds.

Pedunculagin is an ellagitannin found in the Manchurian alder (&quot;A. hirsuta var. microphylla&quot;).

==Uses==
The tree is cultivated in parks and gardens. The cultivar &#x27;Aurea&#x27;, with green-gold leaves, has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

It is sometimes used in afforestation and agroforestry in non-fertile or wet soils which it enriches by means of nitrogen fixing bacteria in its root nodules. 

Alder is an excellent tree for coppicing and pollarding. Its cut branches may be fed to browsing livestock such as cows and goats, then used for kindling, firewood, or light construction - while root systems fertilize adjacent agricultural plots via nitrogen fixation.

The Zuni people use the bark of the &quot;tenuifolia&quot; subspecies to dye deerskin reddish brown.

The Ho-Chunk people eat the bark of the &quot;rugosa&quot; subspecies when their stomachs are &quot;sour&quot; or upset.

Its wood and bark are used in smoking meat, particularly fish and duck.

<text>Aeranthes, abbreviated Aerth in the horticultural trade, is an orchid genus with 47 species, mostly from shady, tropical humid forests in Zimbabwe, Madagascar and islands in the Western Indian Ocean. The name &quot;aeranthes&quot; means &#x27;aerial flower&#x27;, because it grows high in the air.

==Description==
&quot;Aeranthes&quot; has a single short, erect, monopodial stem. The leathery, shining, opposite leaves are arranged in two rows of five to seven leaves, with a length of 15–25 cm. New leaves are formed at the top of the stem in a monopodial growth pattern.

The threadlike flower stalk grows downward to a length of almost 30 cm. It carries one or two almost translucent, greenish yellow flowers. The sepals and the shorter petals taper off into five long, narrow shoots. Some give an agreeable, sweet scent in the evening or early morning.

<text>WWE Studios Inc. (formerly known as WWE Films) is an American film studio owned by the professional wrestling promotion WWE, a division of TKO Group Holdings, a majority-owned subsidiary of Endeavor Group Holdings. WWE Studios movies frequently mix well-known actors and actresses in lead roles with WWE wrestlers, and teams with existing production and distribution companies resulting in lower cost for both parties.

==History==
Before the formation of WWE Studios, the WWF had produced the 1989 film &quot;No Holds Barred&quot; featuring Hulk Hogan under the Shane Distribution Company banner, a precursor to today&#x27;s company. WWE Studios released the film on DVD in 2012.

WWE Studios was formed in 2002 as WWE Films, and was seen as &quot;a natural extension of the entertainment business&quot; that they already featured in the weekly &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown&quot; television programs. Joel Simon was named as President of the WWE Films and Jed Blaugrund as vice president.

WWE announced the first three film projects in January 2005; &quot;The Condemned&quot;, starring Steve Austin, &quot;The Marine&quot;, starring John Cena, and &quot;Goodnight&quot;, later retitled as &quot;See No Evil&quot;, starring Kane. Both of these independent film projects were genre films that cost $20 million to star his wrestlers.

In 2008, the name was changed to WWE Studios. On February 25, 2008, WWE had signed a deal with 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment that Fox received to WWE that they would get one theatrical film and four straight-to-DVD movies. The move was designed to expand into production of scripted television series and films for networks.

In February 2009, WWE Studios announced the first film which would not feature a WWE wrestler as the lead, with &quot;That&#x27;s What I Am&quot; starring Ed Harris as a schoolteacher accused of fondling kids. In December 2009, it was announced that Patricia Clarkson and Danny Glover would star in the WWE Studios and Samuel Goldwyn Films co-production of &quot;Legendary&quot; along with WWE wrestler John Cena. Around the same time, the film announced production had been completed on another co-production with Samuel Goldwyn Films, the comedy &quot;Knucklehead&quot;, which starred WWE wrestler Big Show. Further projects were announced in 2010 with WWE wrestlers in lead roles, with &quot;The Chaperone&quot; starring Triple H, which was released in February 2011, and &quot;Bending the Rules&quot; starring Edge, which was released in March 2012. These initial releases were largely unsuccessful financially.

In February 2012, WWE Studios agreed to a new three-film deal with 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment to produce, finance and market three straight-to-DVD titles, including &quot;The Marine 3: Homefront&quot; starring The Miz, having previously worked with 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment on the previous films in the franchise, &quot;The Marine&quot; and &quot;The Marine 2&quot;. The deal also included the release of &quot;12 Rounds 2: Reloaded&quot; starring Randy Orton, having together previously released &quot;12 Rounds&quot; starring John Cena. Also that year, WWE Studios had signed a deal with Lionsgate in order to work on upcoming projects, most notably a &quot;Leprechaun&quot; project via a two-picture deal between the two studios.

In April 2012, WWE Studios partnered with Warner Bros. Entertainment France and producer Thomas Langmann to distribute French film &quot;Les Reines Du Ring&quot; in the United States and Canada, as well as the rights to remake the film, which was announced in 2014.

WWE Studios also produced &quot;No One Lives&quot; with Pathe Pictures, starring Luke Evans and WWE wrestler Brodus Clay, and acquired the 2011 Toronto International Film Festival cult hit &quot;The Day&quot;, starring Shawn Ashmore and Dominic Monaghan. WWE Studios has also acquired &quot;Interrogation&quot;, a suspense thriller by Adam Rodin. WWE Studios then secured the rights to &quot;Bermuda&quot;, a found footage horror spec script by Bobby Lee Darby and Nathan Brookes, set in the Bermuda Triangle. WWE Studios further announced a partnership with producer Edward R. Pressman and Jason Blum&#x27;s Blum-Hanson-Allen films to develop &quot;Cruisin&#x27; for a Brusin&quot;&#x27;, an action comedy to be written and directed by Adam Bhala Lough. WWE Studios and Warner Bros. co-produced a &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; animated feature that found Scooby and the gang solving a mystery at WrestleMania, which also starred an ensemble of WWE Superstars. The movie released on March 25, 2014. On May 29, 2013, it was announced that WWE studios and Warner Bros would again team up to co-produce a &quot;Flintstones&quot; animated movie to be released in early 2015.

WWE Studios most successful film to date is the 2013 release &quot;The Call&quot;, starring Halle Berry and Abigail Breslin, which made close to $70 million at the box office, despite a comparatively small budget of just $13m. The film opened at the US box office at No. 2 with 17 million in its first weekend. It was further reported that WWE was looking at a potential sequel following the success of &quot;The Call&quot;.

In 2013, WWE Studios and Hyde Park Entertainment announced a deal to work together on the film adaptation of the 1980s television series &quot;The Fall Guy&quot;. The film will star Dwayne Johnson, who made his name as The Rock in WWE from 1996 to 2004 before becoming an actor, in his second WWE Studios production, with the first being &quot;The Scorpion King&quot;. In August 2014, a second collaboration between WWE Studios and Hyde Park was announced, with Ken Jeong, David Hasselhoff and WWE Hall of Famer Hulk Hogan signed to star in a comedy &quot;Killing Hasselhoff&quot;.

In February 2014, WWE announced the sequel to the 1996 film &quot;Jingle All the Way&quot;, to star Larry the Cable Guy and WWE wrestler Santino Marella.

In May 2014, it was announced that WWE had extended their partnership with Lionsgate Entertainment to release a further six films together, with the first two announced as &quot;Vendetta&quot;, starring The Big Show and &quot;12 Rounds 3: Lockdown&quot; starring Dean Ambrose. These group of six films have been referred as the &quot;Action Six-Pack Series&quot;.

In November 2014, WWE announced a new partnership deal with Warner Bros. Home Entertainment. In March 2015, they announced a partnership with newly founded Gene Simmons production company Erebus Pictures and in April 2015, WWE Studios teamed with British company Richwater Films to co-produce and co-finance action-thrillers &quot;Eliminators&quot; and &quot;Rampage&quot;.

In November 2017, WWE announced that WWE Studios will expand its mandate to include scripted, non-scripted, family, and animated television and digital content.

In February 2019, it was reported that WWE Studios and Netflix came to an agreement that would see WWE Studios produce new family-friendly movies for Netflix&#x27;s platform.

In July 2019, it was announced that WWE Studios will be producing its first television show, &quot;Fight Like A Girl&quot;, for Quibi. It would later be moved to The Roku Channel following the closure of Quibi.

In March 2021, the Game Show Network revealed at their upfront; they signed a deal with WWE Studios to develop shows hosted by WWE talent.

In March 2022, A&amp;E Network and WWE expanded their agreement for more episodes of &quot;Biography: WWE Legends&quot; and &quot;WWE&#x27;s Most Wanted Treasures&quot;. It was also announced a new series called &quot;WWE Rivals&quot;. The deal between the company calls for additional content to be announced at a later date.

<text>The Vilyuy (; , &quot;Bülüü&quot;, ) is a river in Russia, the longest tributary of the Lena. About long, it flows mostly within the Sakha Republic. Its basin covers about .

==History==
The river is first mentioned in the 17th century in connection with the Russian conquest of Siberia.

In the 1950s, diamond deposits were discovered in the area, about from its mouth. This led to the construction of the Mir Mine, together with access roads and an airport, and the Vilyuy Dam complex to generate power needed for the diamond concentrators.

==Geography==

The Vilyuy has its sources in the Vilyuy Plateau, part of the Central Siberian Plateau, in the Evenkiysky District (Krasnoyarsk Krai) and, flowing east, soon enters Sakha. It turns towards the south and southeast in the Central Yakutian Lowland, then back towards the east, and finally enters the Lena about downstream of Yakutsk, near Sangar. The Ust-Vilyuy Range rises above the facing bank of the Lena, opposite the mouth of the Vilyuy.

To the west of the Vilyuy and Chona is the Nizhnyaya Tunguska basin.
The Vilyuy basin is sparsely populated. Small settlements along the river include Vilyuysk, Verkhnevilyuysk, Suntar, Ekonda and Nyurba.

===Tributaries===
The main tributaries of the Vilyuy are the Ulakhan-Vava, Chirkuo, Chona, Chybyda, Ulakhan-Botuobuya, Ochchuguy-Botuobuya, , Kempendyay, Tonguo and Bappagay on the right; and the Sen, Lakharchana, Akhtaranda, Ygyatta, Markha, Tyukyan, Kosmos and Tyung on the left.

==Geology==
Vilyuy is associated with geological formations Yakutsk-Vilyuy Rift (Vilyuy Rift Basin) and Yakutsk-Vilyuy LIP (large igneous province), also known as Vilyuy Traps.

<text>USS &quot;Sterlet&quot; (SS-392), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for the sterlet, a small sturgeon found in the Caspian Sea and its rivers, whose meat is considered delicious and whose eggs are one of the world&#x27;s great delicacies, caviar.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Sterlet&quot;′s keel was laid down on 14 July 1943 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 27 October 1943 in the first triple launching in the history of submarine construction. &quot;Sterlet&quot; and were christened in the building basin and was christened and launched from the building ways. &quot;Sterlet&quot; was sponsored by Mrs. Charles A. Plumley and was commissioned on 4 March 1944.

==Service history==
Following fitting-out and shakedown training, &quot;Sterlet&quot; departed Key West, Florida, on 1 May 1944 to join the United States Pacific Fleet. The submarine reached Pearl Harbor on 13 June 1944, and she immediately plunged into another round of training exercises to prepare for her first war patrol.

=== First war patrol ===
On 4 July 1944, she put to sea to prey on Japanese shipping. The patrol lasted 53 days; and &quot;Sterlet&quot; spent 34 of them in her assigned patrol area, the Bonin Islands. On 8 August 1944, she torpedoed and sank the minesweeper &quot;Tama Maru No. 6&quot;. By the time she put into Midway Island for refit on 26 August, the submarine was a battle-proven veteran, claiming to have sunk four enemy ships. She even brought in a prisoner — a survivor from a Japanese convoy destroyed by American aircraft carrier planes three weeks earlier.

=== Second war patrol ===
The submarine remained at Midway for just over three weeks; then headed for its patrol area in the Nansei Shoto on 18 September. After sinking a small Japanese fishing boat on 9 October, &quot;Sterlet&quot; rescued six downed airmen off Okinawa. On 18 October, she made an unsuccessful attempt to close and attack one of six destroyers escorting three cruisers. Two days later, she fired a spread of three torpedoes at a Japanese cargo ship, but all three missed. She made a third fruitless approach on 25 October, firing four torpedoes on small convoy. Results: four misses.

Not to be denied, &quot;Sterlet&quot; made another approach on the convoy. This time, four of the six torpedoes she launched scored. Three hit a large gasoline tanker, and the fourth impacted a freighter. The tanker, &quot;Jinei Maru&quot;, is known definitely to have gone down. &quot;Sterlet&quot; spent the remainder of the day evading the attacks of the escorts. That night, she allowed a hospital ship to pass unmolested. She attacked a small freighter with four torpedoes on 29 October, but had to surface and sink it with her deck gun. On 31 October, she made a night surface attack on a tanker previously damaged by and apparently sank it with a spread of six torpedoes. &quot;Sterlet&quot; then joined &quot;Trigger&quot; in escorting the damaged into Saipan.

From there, &quot;Sterlet&quot; put to sea on 10 November with six other submarines in a coordinated attack group. On the night of 15 November, she, &quot;Trigger&quot;, and engaged in a gun duel with an enemy sub chaser. &quot;Sterlet&quot; completely depleted her supply of five-inch (127 mm) shells in the battle and was forced to sink the enemy craft with torpedoes early the following morning. On 30 November, the submarine returned to the Submarine Base at Pearl Harbor.

=== Third war patrol ===
Following almost two months in Hawaii, &quot;Sterlet&quot; embarked on her third war patrol on 25 January 1945. Her assigned area was off Honshū, Japan, particularly the area off Tokyo Bay, where she stood lifeguard duty for Fifth Fleet pilots attacking Tokyo. She made reconnaissance sweeps of the Japanese Fleet and patrolled with a &quot;wolfpack&quot; that also included , , , and . During this cruise, she made two torpedo attacks, one each on 1 March and 5 March, and claimed two sinkings, a freighter and a tanker. (Japanese sources list Imperial Japanese Army transport ship &quot;Tateyama Maru&quot; as being sunk by a torpedo strike from the &quot;Sterlet&quot; on 1 March). She ended the war patrol at Midway on 4 April.

=== Fourth War Patrol ===

&quot;Sterlet&quot;’s fourth war patrol lasted from 29 April to 10 June and took her north of Japan to the Sea of Okhotsk and the vicinity of the Kuril Islands. On this cruise, her proximity to Soviet territory and the port of Vladivostok complicated her mission. Though Soviet ships were advised to remain out of the war zone around Japan, &quot;Sterlet&quot; had to be extremely vigilant in her identification of potential targets lest she inadvertently attack an ally. Lack of certainty in identification forced the submarine to pass up several targets. To further cloud the issue, Japanese ships probably attempted to disguise themselves as Soviets on several occasions to escape American submarines.

&quot;Sterlet&quot;, however, managed to emerge victorious over two enemy ships. In the late afternoon of 29 May, she encountered a large and a small freighter, escorted by three patrol frigates. At 16:41, the submarine tried for a good setup, but failed due to the convoy&#x27;s rapid change in course. She lost sound contact around 1720 and, 40 minutes later, surfaced for a daylight end-around. At 1822, the lookouts sighted smoke; by 21:53, the submarine was in position to launch a night surface radar attack. She launched six torpedoes, three at each freighter. Two minutes later, one of the escorts peeled off and made for &quot;Sterlet&quot;. She immediately went right full rudder, all ahead at flank speed. In another two minutes, two torpedoes impacted each of the two targets—four explosions within 20 seconds. At 22:05, the enemy frigate began random depth charge attacks. Three minutes later, the smaller of the two targets sank by the stern.

At 22:11, &quot;Sterlet&quot; unleashed four torpedoes at the pursuing escort. The setup was hasty at best. All four missed, and she prudently opened range to reload and prepare for another attack on the damaged freighter still afloat. As she approached, her quarry was dead in the water, down by the stern, and partially enveloped by smoke. Two of the escorts were thrashing about the surrounding waters, indiscriminately shooting and dropping depth charges. At 22:35, one of them passed between &quot;Sterlet&quot; and her victim. The submarine shifted her sights on him and, four minutes later, fired three torpedoes at him. The frigate sighted the wakes, immediately turned into them, and rapidly closed on &quot;Sterlet&quot;. This pursuit forced &quot;Sterlet&quot; to retire. After more than an hour of running from the frigate and undergoing his bombardment, she managed to open range by firing four torpedoes &quot;down the throat&quot; at him. This tactic did not allow her to escape, and the chase continued until the frigate turned broadside to fire both his forward and after guns in salvo. That curious maneuver allowed &quot;Sterlet&quot; to open range to at which point, the enemy&#x27;s radar wavered. &quot;Sterlet&quot; shut her radar down, came hard to starboard and opened out. A minute before midnight, &quot;Sterlet&quot; turned her radar back on. The screen was clear; she had escaped.

The submarine had one more anxious moment during the patrol, when she encountered a Q-ship screened by a small escort. She launched six torpedoes at the &quot;freighter,&quot; which disconcertingly turned and closed &quot;Sterlet&quot;. She evaded successfully and returned to Midway on 10 June.

=== Fifth war patrol ===
&quot;Sterlet&quot;’s final war patrol commenced on 5 July when she departed Midway for the vicinity of Kii Suido and Bungo Suido. Except for one occasion when she shelled oil storage tanks and a power plant near Shingu on Honshū, this whole patrol was given over to lifeguard duty for the crews of carrier planes and B-29 Superfortresses attacking Japan. &quot;Sterlet&quot; rescued a New Zealander and a Briton, one was near the Kii Channel between Shikoku and Honshu. When Japanese capitulation brought an end to the patrol, &quot;Sterlet&quot; returned to Midway on 23 August. On 6 September, she sailed for the United States reaching San Diego Naval Base ten days later.

=== Post-war activities ===
&quot;Sterlet&quot; remained on the West Coast until the end of February 1946, at San Diego until 13 November and at San Francisco, California, thereafter. On 26 February 1946, she started back to the western Pacific and after briefly stopping at Pearl Harbor, Guam, and Subic Bay, arrived in Tsingtao, China, on 20 April. She operated out of Tsingtao until the end of May, participating in the Navy&#x27;s show of force along the northern China coast. She spent the first ten days of June in Shanghai and then got underway for Pearl.

&quot;Sterlet&quot; reached Oahu on 22 June and conducted operations in the Hawaiian Islands for the next 16 months. She headed west again on 15 November 1947 and reached Brisbane, Australia, on 1 December. Five days later, the submarine shaped a course for Guam, arriving there on 14 December. She departed Guam on 2 January 1948, stopped at Okinawa from 6 January to 10 January, and arrived in the Sasebo operating area on 12 January. For the rest of the month, she operated in the vicinity of Sasebo and Yokosuka, visiting both ports. On 28 January, she sailed for the California coast and, after a brief stop at Midway and a six-week layover in Pearl Harbor, reached San Francisco on 30 April. On 1 May, she reported to the Pacific Reserve Fleet for inactivation. She was placed out of commission, in reserve on 18 September 1948 and berthed at Mare Island, California.

Just under two years later, on 7 August 1950, &quot;Sterlet&quot; was ordered reactivated. She was recommissioned at Mare Island on 26 August 1950. On 25 September, she headed for San Diego where she conducted a month of training. In December, she shifted to Long Beach, California, where she became one of the stars in the motion picture &quot;Submarine Command&quot; with William Holden and William Bendix.

&quot;Sterlet&quot; resumed operations along the West Coast early in 1951 and that employment continued until January 1953, when she was deployed to the Far East. On this cruise, she joined in hunter-killer exercises, visited Chichi Jima, Atami, Japan, and Buckner Bay, Okinawa; and conducted photographic reconnaissance on Marcus Island. She returned to San Diego, California, on 23 June and resumed West Coast operations.

In August 1954, &quot;Sterlet&quot; exchanged crews and homeports with .
On 13 September, she reported for duty to Submarine Squadron 1 at Pearl Harbor. For the remainder of her Navy career, &quot;Sterlet&quot; was home ported at Pearl Harbor. Between 1954 and 1968, she alternated operations in the Hawaiian Islands with nine deployments to the western Pacific with the Seventh Fleet. On these cruises, usually of approximately six months duration, she participated in a host of exercises and war game problems and visited most major ports in the Far East, particularly those in Japan, Taiwan, China and in some of the Central Pacific islands.

After her return from her final deployment in the summer of 1968, &quot;Sterlet&quot; was found to be unfit for further naval service. Accordingly, she was decommissioned on 30 September 1968, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on the following day. She rendered her last service to the Navy on 31 January 1969 when she was sunk as a target by the nuclear-powered submarine .

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Sterlet&quot; was awarded six battle stars for World War II service.

<text>Juglans nigra, the eastern American black walnut, is a species of deciduous tree in the walnut family, Juglandaceae, native to central and eastern North America, growing mostly in riparian zones.

Black walnut is susceptible to thousand cankers disease, which provoked a decline of walnut trees in some regions. Black walnut is allelopathic, releasing chemicals from its roots and other tissues that may harm other organisms and give the tree a competitive advantage, but there is no scientific consensus that this is a primary competitive factor.

Black walnut is an important tree commercially, as the wood is a deep brown color and easily worked. Walnut seeds (nuts) are cultivated for their distinctive and desirable taste. Walnut trees are grown for lumber and food, and processors have found additional markets for even the tough outer hulls by finely grinding them for use in products such as abrasive cleansers. Many cultivars have been developed for improved quality wood or nuts. In 2017, the United States Department of Agriculture valued U.S. walnut timber at $530 billion. A significant amount is grown in Missouri.

== Description ==
*Odor Most parts of the tree including leaves, stems, and fruit husks have a very characteristic pungent or spicy odor. This odor is lacking in the nut itself.
*Trunk Height . Under forest competition, it develops a tall and straight trunk. When grown in an open area it has a short trunk and broad crown.
*Bark The bark is typically grey-black and deeply furrowed into thin ridges that gives the bark a diamond shaped pattern.
*Pith The pith of the twigs is chambered and light brown.
*Buds The buds are pale silky and covered in downy hairs. The terminal buds are ovate, and long, and slightly longer than broad, the lateral buds are smaller and superposed.
*Leaves The leaves are pinnately compound and alternately arranged on the stem. They are long, typically even-pinnate but there is heavy variation among leaves. The stems have 15–23 leaflets, when terminal leaf is included, with the largest leaflets located in the center, long and broad. The leaflets have a rounded base and a long pointed (acuminate) tip as well as having a serrated edge. The leaves are overall dark green in color and are typically hairy on the underside.
*Leaf scar The leaf scar has three prominent bundle scars and has a notch on the side that points toward the tip of the branch (distal side)
*Flowers Black walnut is monoecious. The male (staminate) flowers are in drooping catkins long. These are borne from axillary buds on the previous year&#x27;s growth. The female (pistillate) flowers are terminal, in clusters of two to five on the current year&#x27;s growth.
*Fruit Ripens during the summer/autumn into a spherical fruit (nut) with a brownish-green, semifleshy husk and a brown, corrugated nut. The whole fruit, including the husk, falls in October; the seed is relatively small and very hard.

 The fruit production tends to occur irregularly with some years producing larger crops than others (see mast year). Fruiting may begin when the tree is 4–6 years old, but large crops take 20 years. Total lifespan of &quot;J. nigra&quot; is about 130 years. Like other trees of the order Fagales, such as oaks, hickories, chestnuts, and birches, it is monoecious, with wind-pollinated catkins. Male and female flowers are in separate spikes, and the female flowers typically appear before the male on a single tree (dichogamy). As a consequence, self-pollination is unlikely. However, individual trees are commonly self-compatible; if they are not pollinated by neighboring trees, they may set self-fertilized seeds. For maximum seed germination, the seeds should be cold-moist stratified for 3–4 months, although the exact time depends on the seed source. The seedlings emerge in April or May. While most trees with taproots have a reputation for slow growth, black walnut is an exception and can achieve very rapid growth in the seedling stage, typically their first year and even more in the second year. Black walnut will not leaf out until temperatures have warmed sufficiently. Leafout in spring is initiated when daytime highs reach approximately and leaf drop in fall when daytime highs fall below . As such, the exact timing will vary in different regions of the U.S. and depending on the weather conditions from year to year, leafout is typically early April in the southern part of its range and sometimes not until the end of May or beginning of June in cooler areas. Leaf drop in fall may begin in late September in cooler regions and not until November in southern areas.

Black walnut has a strong taproot, which makes the seedlings resilient, but difficult to transplant.

Black walnut is more resistant to frost than &quot;J. regia&quot; (the English or Persian walnut), but thrives best in the warmer regions of fertile, lowland soils with high water tables, although it will also grow in drier soils, but much more slowly. Some specimens have been found to survive frosts down to . Some soils preferred by black walnut include alfisol and entisol soil types. Black walnut grows best on sandy loam, loam, or silt loam type soils but will also grow well on silty clay loam soils. It prefers these soils because they hold large quantities of water, which the tree draws from during rainless periods.

Visually, black walnut is similar to the butternut (&quot;Juglans cinerea&quot;) in leaf shape, and the range also overlaps significantly. The fruits are quite different, and their presence makes an identification easy, as black walnut fruits are round (spherical) and butternuts are more oval-oblong shaped. When a fruit is not available, two species can be differentiated based on the leaf scars, or the place where the leaf meets the stem: butternut has a leaf scar with a flat upper edge and with a velvety ridge above that flat part, but black walnut has an indented leaf scar with no hairy ridge.

== Distribution and habitat ==
The species is native to North America. It grows mostly in riparian zones, from southern Ontario, west to southeast South Dakota, south to Georgia, northern Florida and southwest to central Texas. Wild trees in the upper Ottawa Valley may be an isolated native population or may have derived from planted trees.

== Ecology ==
Black walnut is primarily a pioneer species similar to red and silver maple and black cherry. Because of this, black walnut is a common weed tree found along roadsides, fields, and forest edges in the eastern US. It will grow in closed forests, but is classified as shade intolerant; this means it requires full sun for optimal growth and nut production.

Black walnut&#x27;s native range extends across much of the eastern US. It is absent from the coastal plain south of North Carolina as well as the Mississippi Valley, and does not occur in the northern tier of the eastern US, where the frost-free season is too short for the nuts to develop. Its western range extends all the way to the eastern Great Plains, beyond which climate conditions become too dry for it.

Black walnut is one of the most abundant trees in the eastern US, particularly the Northeast, and its numbers are increasing due to epidemics that have affected other tree species, including emerald ash borer, chestnut blight, butternut canker, wooly hemlock adelgid, dogwood anthracnose, Dutch elm disease, and spongy moth infestations. Widespread clear-cutting of oaks due to spongy moth damage in the 1970s–1980s particularly aided in the tree&#x27;s spread. The aggressive competitive strategy of black walnut such as its fast growth, alleopathic chemicals, and rodent-dispersed seeds, have also contributed.

The nuts are food for many rodents and make up to 10% of the diet of eastern fox squirrels. The nuts are also eaten by species of birds. The leaves are browsed by white tailed deer, although they are not a preferred food.

Where the range of the eastern black walnut overlaps that of the Texas black walnut (&quot;J. microcarpa&quot;), the two species sometimes interbreed, producing populations with characteristics intermediate between the two species. &quot;J. nigra&quot; and &quot;J. cinerea&quot; often grow in the same range as well but they do not hybridize naturally.

The tree&#x27;s roots often form endomycorrhizal relationships with fungi in the genus &quot;Glomus&quot;. Some endomycorrhizal relations improve the plant&#x27;s growth.

Species often associated with &quot;J. nigra&quot; include yellow-poplar (&quot;Liriodendron tulipifera&quot;), white ash (&quot;Fraxinus americana&quot;), black cherry (&quot;Prunus serotina&quot;), basswood (&quot;Tilia americana&quot;), American beech (&quot;Fagus grandifolia&quot;), sugar maple (&quot;Acer saccharum&quot;), oaks (&quot;Quercus&quot; spp.), and hickories (&quot;Carya&quot; spp.). Near the western edge of its range, black walnut may be confined to floodplains, where it grows either with American elm (&quot;Ulmus americana&quot;), common hackberry (&quot;Celtis occidentalis&quot;), green ash (&quot;Fraxinus pennsylvanica&quot;), and boxelder (&quot;Acer negundo&quot;), or with basswood and red oak (&quot;Quercus rubra&quot;) on lower slopes and other favorable sites.

=== Pests ===
Maggots (larvae of &quot;Rhagoletis completa&quot; and &quot;Rhagoletis suavis&quot;) in the husk are common, though more a nuisance than a serious problem for amateurs, who may simply remove the affected husk as soon as infestation is noticed. The maggots develop entirely within the husk, thus the quality of the nutmeat is not affected. However, infestations of maggots are undesirable because they make the husk difficult to remove and are unsightly. Maggots can be serious for commercial walnut growers, who tend to use chemical treatments to prevent damage to the crop. Some non-chemical controls also exist, such as removing and disposing of infested nuts.

The walnut weevil (&quot;Conotrachelus retentus&quot;) grows to long as an adult. The adult sucks plant juices through a snout. The eggs are laid in fruits in the spring and summer. Many nuts are lost due to damage from the larvae, which burrow through the nut shell.

Black walnut is affected by European canker (&quot;Neonectria galligena&quot;). The infection spreads slowly but infected trees eventually die.

 The walnut caterpillar (&quot;Datana integerrima&quot;) and fall webworm (&quot;Hyphantria cunea&quot;) are two of the most serious pests, they commonly eat the foliage in midsummer and continue into autumn.

Codling moth (&quot;Cydia pomonella&quot;) larvae eat walnut kernels, as well as apple and pear seeds.

Important leaf sucking insects include species of aphids and plant lice including (&quot;Monellia&quot; spp. and &quot;Monelliopsis&quot; spp.), which suck the juices from leaves and often deposit a sticky substance called &quot;honey-dew&quot; on the leaf surface that may turn black and prevent photosynthesis; and the walnut lace bug (&quot;Corythucha juglandis&quot;), which causes damage when the adults and nymphs suck the sap from the lower surfaces of walnut leaflets.

A disease complex known as thousand cankers disease has been threatening black walnut in several western states. This disease has recently been discovered in Tennessee, and could potentially have devastating effects on the species in the eastern United States. Vectored by the walnut twig beetle (&quot;Pityophthorus juglandis&quot;), a fungus, &quot;Geosmithia morbida&quot;, spreads into the wood around the galleries carved by the small beetles. The fungus causes cankers that inhibit the movement of nutrients in black walnut, leading to crown and branch dieback, and ultimately death.

=== Allelopathy ===
While black walnut is considered allelopathic, meaning it excretes chemicals into its environment that harm competition, research from 2019 has questioned whether this long-held belief holds up to scientifically rigorous examination. Many publications that have repeated claims of black walnut allelopathy cite a very limited set of dated research literature, which has not held up to scientific scrutiny. Anecdotally, records of walnut toxicity to other plants have been observed as far back as the first century when Pliny the Elder wrote: &quot;The shadow of walnut trees is poison to all plants within its compass.&quot; 

Like other walnuts, the roots, inner bark, nut husks, and leaves contain a nontoxic chemical called hydrojuglone; when exposed to air or soil compounds it is oxidized into juglone that is biologically active and acts as a respiratory inhibitor to some plants. Juglone is poorly soluble in water and does not move far in the soil and will stay most concentrated in the soil directly beneath the tree. Even after a tree is removed the soil where the roots once were will still contain juglone for several years after the tree is removed as more juglone will be released as the roots decay. Well drained and aerated soils will host a healthy community of soil microbes and these microbes will help to break down the juglone.

Symptoms of juglone poisoning include foliar yellowing and wilting. A number of plants are particularly sensitive. Apples, tomatoes, pines, and birch are poisoned by juglone, and as a precaution, should not be planted in proximity to a black walnut.

=== Interaction with horses ===
Horses are susceptible to laminitis from exposure to black walnut wood in bedding.
==Cultivation==
=== Planting ===
 While its primary native region is the Midwest and east-central United States, the black walnut was introduced into Europe in 1629 and is also cultivated in Hawaii. It is cultivated there and in North America as a forest tree for its high-quality wood. Black walnut plantings can be made to produce timber, nuts, or both timber and nuts. Patented timber-type trees were selected and released from Purdue University in the early 1990s. These trees have been sporadically available from nurseries. Varieties include Purdue #1, which can be used for both timber and nut production, though nut quality is poor compared to varieties selected specifically as nut producers.

Grafted, nut-producing trees are available from several nurseries operating in the U.S. Selections worth considering include Thomas, Neel #1, Thomas Myers, Pounds #2, Stoker, Surprise, Emma K, Sparrow, S127, and McGinnis. Several older varieties, such as Kwik Krop, are still in cultivation; while they make decent nuts, they would not be recommended for commercial planting.

Pollination requirements should be considered when planting black walnuts. As is typical of many species in Juglandaceae, &quot;J. nigra&quot; trees tend to be monoecious, i.e.. produce pollen first and then pistillate flowers or else produce pistillate flowers and then pollen. An early pollen-producer should be grouped with other varieties that produce pistillate flowers so all varieties benefit from overlap. Cranz, Thomas, and Neel #1 make a good pollination trio. A similar group for more northern climates would be Sparrow, S127, and Mintle.

Sometimes black walnut is planted as part of reclaiming mines. When growing young trees weed control is critical for healthy establishment of the trees, without weed control the young trees are harmed significantly in their growth rate.

===Commercial===
Black walnuts are shelled commercially in the United States. With about 65% of the U.S.&#x27;s annual wild harvest, the U.S. state of Missouri is home to the world&#x27;s largest processor and distributor of black walnuts, which the Missouri Department of Conservation considers to be the state&#x27;s most valuable timber. In 1990, Missouri named the &quot;Eastern Black Walnut&quot; as its official tree nut. Missouri&#x27;s largest processing plant is operated by Hammons Products in Stockton, Missouri. NPR affiliate KCUR stated in an article that &quot;Ralph Hammons began the company in 1946 with a nut cracking machine acquired from Tennessee.&quot; The Stockton &quot;Black Walnut Festival&quot;, which has been held annually since 1961, &quot;brings the community together for a 3-day event jam-packed with activities including a carnival, tractor pull, nut roll and 2-hour parade,&quot; stated Alexa Hodges in a VOX article.

====Nut processing by hand====

The extraction of the kernel from the fruit of the black walnut is difficult. The thick, hard shell is tightly bound by tall ridges to a thick husk. Rolling the nut underfoot on a hard surface such as a driveway is a common method; commercial huskers use a car tire rotating against a metal mesh. Some take a thick plywood board and drill a nut-sized hole in it (from one to two inches in diameter) and smash the nut through using a hammer. The nut goes through and the husk remains behind. American pioneers let the nuts dry in the sun, then removed the husks and let the kernels dry—making them less bitter.

The shell itself is thicker than that of the English walnut, and there are additional, thick internal walls tightly surrounding the nutmeat. Walnuts are too tough and too large to be opened with a standard nutcracker, but simply cracking the shell open with a rock results in smashed and shattered nutmeats mixed with shell, unless done with some care and skill—and it is still nearly impossible to extract an intact half this way. As a result, a number of home walnut-cracking devices have been produced, involving vices, cams, or levers.

While the flavor of the &quot;Juglans nigra&quot; kernel is prized, the difficulty in preparing it may account for the wider popularity and availability of the English walnut.

===Ornamental===
&quot;J. nigra&quot; is also grown as a specimen ornamental tree in parks and large gardens, growing to tall by broad. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

==Uses==
===As food===

Black walnut kernels are edible. The nut provides a robust, distinctive, natural flavor and crunch as a food ingredient. Common uses include ice cream, bakery goods and confections. Consumers include black walnuts in traditional treats, such as cakes, cookies, fudge, and pies, during the fall holiday season. The nuts are versatile for uses in other foods, such as salads, fish, pork, chicken, vegetables and pasta dishes.

Tapped in spring, the tree yields a sweet sap that can be drunk or concentrated into syrup or sugar that is not unlike the sap of sugar maple.

====Nutrition====
Black walnut kernels are 5% water, 59% fat, 24% protein, and 10% carbohydrates. In a reference amount of , walnuts supply 619 calories and several micronutrients in &quot;rich&quot; amounts (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV), including the dietary minerals manganese (169% DV) and copper (156% DV), among others, and the B vitamins, B6 (34% DV) and pantothenic acid (33% DV). Black walnut kernels are a moderate source (10–19% DV) of vitamin E and riboflavin.

Analysis of black walnut fat content showed the most prevalent fatty acids are linoleic acid (33.8%), followed by oleic acid (15.3%), alpha-linolenic acid (2.7%), palmitic acid (1.9%), and stearic acid (1.5%).

=== Dye ===
Black walnut drupes contain juglone (5-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone), plumbagin (yellow quinone pigments), and tannin. These compounds cause walnuts to stain cars, sidewalks, porches, and patios, in addition to the hands of anyone attempting to shell them. The brownish-black dye was used by early American settlers to dye hair. According to Eastern Trees in the Petersen Guide series, black walnuts make a yellowish-brown dye, not brownish-black. The apparent confusion is easily explained by the fact that the liquid (dye) obtained from the inner husk becomes increasingly darker over time, as the outer skin darkens from light green to black. Extracts of the outer, soft part of the drupe are still used as a natural dye for handicrafts. The tannins present in walnuts act as a mordant, aiding in the dyeing process, and are usable as a dark ink or wood stain.

=== Shells ===
Walnut shells are often used as an abrasive in sand blasting or other circumstances where a medium hardness grit is required. The hard black walnut shell is also used commercially in abrasive cleaning, a filtering agent in scrubbers in smoke stacks, cleaning jet engines, cosmetics, and oil well drilling and water filtration. Additionally, the husks are ground into an ingredient in exfoliating cosmetics.

=== Wood ===

Black walnut is highly prized for its dark-colored, straight grained, true heartwood. It is heavy, strong, shock resistant and yet can be easily split and worked. Along with cedars (&quot;Thuja spp.&quot;), chestnut (&quot;Castanea spp&quot;.), and black locust (&quot;Robinia pseudoacacia&quot;) black walnut is one of the most durable hardwoods in the US. The wood can be kiln dried and holds its shape well after seasoning, which makes this wood even more attractive for wood working.

Walnut wood has historically been used for gun stocks, furniture, flooring, paddles, coffins, and a variety of other wood products. Black walnut has a density of 660 kg per cubic meter (41.2 lb/cubic foot), which makes it less dense than oak.

== Largest trees ==
The U.S. national champion black walnut is on a residential property on Sauvie Island, Oregon. It is diameter at breast height and tall, with a crown spread of .

The tallest black walnut in Europe is located in the Woluwe Park in the city of Sint-Pieters-Woluwe, Brussels, Belgium. It has a circumference of , height of exactly (measured by laser), and was planted around 1850 (± 10 years).

The largest black walnut in Europe is located in the Castle Park in the city of Sereď, Slovakia. It has a circumference of , height of and estimated age of 300 years.

<text>William Delme Thomas (born 12 September 1942) is a former rugby union player who became one of Wales&#x27; best known rugby players in the 1960s and 1970s. He joined Llanelli RFC in 1961 and was the team&#x27;s captain when they won the league in the 1972–73 season and was also the captain when Llanelli beat a touring All Blacks team in 1972. He is remembered for his emotional speech given to his teammates before this game. He played lock forward.

==Early life and work==
Thomas was born in Bancyfelin, near Carmarthen. He worked as an electricity board linesman, climbing telegraph poles to make repairs.

==Rugby career==
===Llanelli===
Thomas played for Llanelli rugby club. He led them in their famous victory over the All Blacks at Stradey Park in 1972. His famous speech to his players before the game included his statement that he would willingly trade everything he had achieved with Wales and the Lions for victory that day &quot;on our own ground in front of our own people&quot;.

===Wales===
He played for the Wales national youth team at age eighteen and won his first cap against Australia in December 1966 and was first choice as lock for the team until he retired from international rugby in 1974, playing his last International in his only loss against England. He was an important part of the team that won the Grand Slam in 1971. During his penultimate season, he was Wales&#x27; captain in the game against New Zealand in Cardiff. In total, he won 25 caps.

===British and Irish Lions===
Delme Thomas toured three times with the then-British Lions. He got his first cap in 1966, before playing for the Wales team, where he played in two test matches. He went on to play two games in the 1968 tour in South Africa and another two in New Zealand in 1971.

==After rugby==
After retiring from playing rugby in 1974, Thomas experienced mental troubles, which he ascribed in part to leaving the rugby &#x27;family&#x27; particularly at Llanelli.

==Recognition==
In 2000, at the National Eisteddfod in Llanelli, Thomas was honoured as a member of the Gorsedd of the Bards, for his contribution to Welsh sport and the Welsh language.

<text>The Olyokma (, , ; , ) is a tributary of the Lena in eastern Siberia. 

The river gives its name to the Olyokma-Chara Plateau, located to the west of its western bank.
==History==
In the summer of 1631, Russian pioneer Pyotr Beketov entered the Olyokma during his first voyage down the Lena and in 1636 he founded the present-day city of Olyokminsk near the mouth of the river on the left bank of Lena. 

Yerofey Khabarov used this river&#x27;s route to travel from the Lena to the Amur during his mid-17th century expeditions. In the spring of 1649 Khabarov set off at his own expense up the Olyokma, then up its tributary, the Tungir and portaged to the Shilka River, reaching the upper Amur (Dauria) in early 1650.
==Course==
The river is long, and has a drainage basin of . The Olyokma rises in the Muroy Range, Olyokma-Stanovik Highlands (Олёкминский Становик), west of Mogocha. It flows through remote terrain and cuts across the Kalar Range of the Stanovoy Highlands through a narrow valley. Further north, it bends around the eastern end of the Udokan Range and flows roughly north before joining the Lena near Olyokminsk.

To the west flows the Vitim, to the south the Shilka and Amur, and to the east the upper Aldan. Its main tributaries are the Tungir, the Nyukzha and the Chara —with its tributary the Tokko.

<text>The balsam poplars (Populus&quot; sect. &quot;Tacamahaca) are a group of about 10 species of poplars, indigenous to North America and eastern Asia, distinguished by the balsam scent of their buds, the whitish undersides of their leaves, and the leaf petiole being round (not flattened) in cross-section. They are large deciduous trees, 30–60 m tall, with leaves with a rounded base, pointed apex, and a whitish waxy coating on the underside of the leaf; this latter distinguishes them from most other poplars. The name is derived from the pleasant balsam smell of the opening buds and leaves in spring, produced by a sticky gum on the buds which also helps protect the buds from insect damage. The balsam poplars are light-demanding trees that require considerable moisture. Balsam poplars are tolerant of very cold conditions, occurring further north than other poplars except for the aspens. The poplars in Southern California are tolerant of 100 plus degree heat. They grow along dry washes and dry riverbed&#x27;s. The dry washes and dry riverbeds will have flowing water when it rains sufficiently. Their leaves hang down and are at an edge to the sun. This may be another factor why they can take the high heat. Their leaves tremble in the slightest breeze like the quaking aspen

==Species==
The balsam poplar &quot;P. balsamifera&quot; (= &quot;P. tacamahaca&quot;, &quot;P. candicans&quot;) is a native of North America, where it grows on alluvial bottomlands in the northeastern United States and Canada. It grows to a height of 30 metres and has yellow-grey bark, thick and furrowed, and coloured blackish at the base of the trunk. The twigs are yellow-brown to brown, the buds covered with a layer of balsam resin. The flowers and fruit are very much like those of the white poplar (&quot;P. alba&quot;) which is a relative of the aspens (&quot;Populus&quot; sect. &quot;Populus&quot;).

 The western balsam poplar, black cottonwood, or California poplar &quot;P. trichocarpa&quot; is native to western North America, from Alaska south to northern California. It is the largest species of poplar, recorded to 65 m tall. It is also a very important species in plant biology. It was announced on 15 September 2006 in the journal Science that &quot;P. trichocarpa&quot; became the first tree species to have its entire genome sequenced. In the mountains of interior western North America, it is replaced by the willow-leaved poplar or narrowleaf cottonwood, &quot;P. angustifolia&quot;. &quot;P. trichocarpa&quot; is sometimes treated within &quot;P. balsamifera&quot; as &quot;P. balsamifera&quot; ssp. &quot;trichocarpa.&quot;

Simon&#x27;s poplar (&quot;P. simonii&quot;), a native of northwestern China, is frequently planted as a shade tree in northern European cities. It is an attractive ornamental tree with whitish bark, and nearly rhombic, 6–10 cm long leaves which appear on the tree in early spring. Maximowicz&#x27; poplar or Japanese poplar (&quot;P. maximowiczii&quot;) and the Ussuri poplar (&quot;P. ussuriensis&quot; = &quot;P. maximowiczii&quot; var. &quot;barbinervis&quot;) are similar, occurring in northeastern China, Japan, Korea, and eastern Siberia; they have broader leaves. Another similar species is the laurel-leaf poplar (&quot;P. laurifolia&quot; from Mongolia), which differs from its relatives in narrower leaves shaped like a bay laurel leaf. Another putative member of this group is the Korean poplar (&quot;P. koreana&quot;).

Whether the northeast Asian Sichuan poplar (&quot;P. szechuanica&quot;) and &quot;P. tristis&quot; belong here or with the aspens is not yet resolved. Likewise, the affiliation of &quot;P. cathayana&quot; and the Yunnan poplar (&quot;P. yunnanensis&quot;) are in need of further study, though these may well be balsam poplars.

There are other species not listed here. How to classify &quot;Populus&quot; into species, at least for Chinese populations, is not yet settled.

==Use by humans==
Balsam poplars are cultivated mainly in parks for their ornamental, light-coloured bark and pleasant scent in spring. Western balsam poplar is also planted as a timber crop. The wood is soft, very light in weight, but strong for its weight, coarse and fibrous, does not polish or plane easily, and is used for pallet boxes and other similar rough uses.

Several hybrids between balsam poplars (particularly western balsam poplar) and the cottonwoods have also been developed for lumber production or for use as shade trees. These hybrids are selected for exceptionally fast growth and disease resistance.

Poplars are also of potential use for biofuels because of their fast growth. Researchers are aiming to use genetic techniques to make poplars grow fatter, with a smaller canopy, so that more trees can be grown more quickly in a small space, and to make the plants contain a higher proportion of cellulose to lignin. The increased cellulose content would make them easier to convert into sugars and ethanol for biofuel or for pulp in paper mills.

The buds of various balsam poplars have long been combined with a lard base to make the vulnerary ointment Balm of Gilead.

<doc id="1115591" wikidata="Q932613" url="?curid=1115591" title="Battle of Castillon">
<text>The Battle of Castillon was a battle between the forces of England and France which took place on 17 July 1453 in Gascony near the town of Castillon-sur-Dordogne (later Castillon-la-Bataille). 
On the day of the battle, the English commander, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, believing that the enemy was retreating, led his army in an attack on a fortified French encampment without waiting for reinforcements. Talbot then refused to withdraw even after realizing the strength of the French position, causing his men to suffer severe casualties from the French artillery. Castillon was a major European battle won through the extensive use of field artillery.

The battle led to the English losing nearly all their holdings in France, especially Gascony, which had been a possession of the Plantagenet kings for the previous three centuries. Political instability ensued in England.

==Background==
The breakdown of the 1420 Treaty of Troyes began the final stage of the Hundred Years&#x27; War. This period from 1420 to 1453 is characterized by Anne Curry as the &quot;wars of the Treaty of Troyes&quot; for control of the crown of France.

After the 1451 French capture of Bordeaux by the armies of Charles VII, the Hundred Years&#x27; War appeared to be at an end. The English primarily focused on reinforcing their only remaining possession, Calais, and watching over the seas. After three hundred years of Plantagenet rule, though, the citizens of Bordeaux considered themselves as subjects of the English monarch and sent messengers to Henry VI of England demanding that he recapture the province.

On 17 October 1452, the Earl of Shrewsbury landed near Bordeaux with a force of 3,000 men. A feared and famous military leader, Talbot was rumoured to be seventy-five or eighty years old, but it is more likely that he was around sixty-six at the time. With the cooperation of the townspeople, Talbot easily took the city on 23 October. The English subsequently took control over most of western Gascony by the end of the year. The French had known an English expedition was coming, but had expected it to come through Normandy. After this surprise, Charles prepared his forces over the winter, and by early 1453 he was ready to counterattack.

==Prelude==
Charles invaded Guyenne with three separate armies, all headed for Bordeaux. Talbot received 3,000 additional men, reinforcements led by his fourth and favourite son, John, the Viscount Lisle. The French laid siege to Castillon (approximately 40 kilometres (25 mi) east of Bordeaux) on 8 July. Talbot acceded to the pleas of the town leaders, abandoning his original plan to wait at Bordeaux for more reinforcements, and set out to relieve the garrison.

The French army was commanded by committee; Charles VII&#x27;s ordnance officer Jean Bureau laid out the camp to maximize French artillery strength. In a defensive setup, Bureau&#x27;s forces built an artillery park out of range from Castillon&#x27;s guns. According to Desmond Seward, the park &quot;consisted of a deep trench with a wall of earth behind it which was strengthened by tree-trunks; its most remarkable feature was the irregular, wavy line of the ditch and earthwork, which enabled the guns to enfilade any attackers&quot;. The park included up to 300 guns of various sizes, and was protected by a ditch and palisade on three sides and a steep bank of the River Lidoire on the fourth.

Talbot left Bordeaux on 16 July. He outdistanced a majority of his forces, arriving at Libourne by sunset with only 500 men-at-arms and 800 mounted archers. The following day, this force defeated a small French detachment of archers stationed at a priory near Castillon. Despite earlier plans to wait for reinforcements, Talbot pressed his men onward to the French camp, believing the rest of his men would arrive soon.
==Battle==
Along with the morale boost of victory at the priory, Talbot also pushed forward because of reports that the French were retreating. However, the cloud of dust leaving the camp which the townsmen indicated as a retreat was in fact created by camp followers departing before the battle.

The English advanced but soon ran into the full force of the French army. Despite being outnumbered and in a vulnerable position, Talbot ordered his men to continue fighting. Historian A. J. Pollard suggests this seemingly reckless behaviour from Talbot may be due to the fact that his &quot;pride and honour were at stake for he had already ordered his men to battle when he discovered the strength of the French position&quot;. The only Englishman who remained mounted in the battle, he also did not wear armour due to previous agreements with the French when he was released from captivity in Normandy.

According to David Nicolle, the battle itself was &quot;highly characteristic of the period&quot; with the strong field fortification of the French and the small-arms fighting of the battle. In many ways, this battle played out like the Battle of Crécy in &quot;reverse&quot;. The French guns obliterated the advancing soldiers, with each shot reportedly killing six men at a time. Talbot&#x27;s reinforcements continued to arrive at the battle, only to suffer the same fate in their turn. Despite the odds against the English, the battle lasted over an hour until a thousand-strong Breton cavalry force led by Peter II, Duke of Brittany, crashed into their right flank, sending them into retreat.

The battle ended in an English rout, and both Talbot and his son were killed. There is some debate over the circumstances of Talbot&#x27;s death, but it appears that his horse was killed by a cannon shot, and its mass pinning him down, a French archer in turn killed him with an axe.

The survivors of the clash as well as the remnant of the Anglo-Gascon force which had not been thrown into the battle, totalling up to 5,000 men, including John de Foix, 1st Earl of Kendal, sought refuge in the castle of Castillon.

==Aftermath==
The day after the battle, Jean Bureau besieged the castle with his artillery, and the defenders surrendered on 19 July, becoming prisoners of war.

With Talbot&#x27;s death and the destruction of his army, English authority in Gascony eroded and the French retook Bordeaux on 19 October. It was not apparent to either side that the period of conflict was over. In hindsight, the battle marks a decisive turning point in history, and is cited as the endpoint of the period known as the Hundred Years&#x27; War. This was a major European battle won through the extensive use of field artillery.

Henry VI of England lost his mental capacity in late 1453, which led to the outbreak of the Wars of the Roses in England. Some have speculated that learning of the defeat at Castillon led to his mental collapse. The English Crown lost all its continental possessions except for the Pale of Calais, which was the last English possession in mainland France, and the Channel Islands, historically part of the Duchy of Normandy and thus of the Kingdom of France. Calais was lost in 1558. The Channel Islands have remained British Crown Dependencies to the present day, though they were subject to German occupation during World War II.

A casualty after the battle of Castillon was Pierre II de Montferrand, husband of Mary Plantagenet, illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Bedford and a granddaughter of Henry IV of England. While returning to France after being exiled in England, Montferrand was arrested and taken to Poitiers where he was tried by a commission. Having been found guilty he was beheaded and quartered, possibly on the orders of Charles VII, at Poitiers, in July 1454. Montferrand was one of only a few nobles known to have been executed for treason during the reign of Charles VII.

== Location of the Battlefield ==
To this day, regarding the position of the French camp, two hypotheses are in opposition.

The first hypothesis, based on the writings of Léo Drouyn, asserts that Jean Bureau chose a site north of the Dordogne River to position his cannons. According to his assumptions, the camp was set up behind an old winding bed of the Lidoire, a small tributary of the Dordogne. The riverbed served as a ditch, and its northern bank was fortified with a parapet and a continuous wall made of tree trunks. The entrenched camp, stretching 600 metres in length, was guarded to the north, about 1.5 km away, by 1,000 Breton cavalrymen under the command of Lords Jean de Montauban and Gilles de la Hunaudaye. The Colle plain, located in the present-day commune of Lamothe-Montravel between the entrenched camp and the Dordogne, provided ideal flat terrain for the French artillery to fire.

According to a second, more recent hypothesis, based on the discovery of new sources from the Saint Florent priory and an investigation conducted by Judge Lassime in the 18th century, the French camp was located in front of the town of Castillon, within cannon range—approximately 200 metres away. Since the Lidoire shifted its course after 1496, Léo Drouyn&#x27;s hypothesis would be rendered invalid.

<doc id="1115592" wikidata="Q146269" url="?curid=1115592" title="Populus alba">
<text>Populus alba, commonly called silver poplar, silverleaf poplar, white poplar, or abele is a species of poplar, most closely related to the aspens (&quot;Populus&quot; sect. &quot;Populus&quot;). It is native to a region spanning from the Atlas Mountains of Africa, through most of South and Central Europe, into Central Asia; it has been introduced to many temperate, moist regions worldwide. It grows in moist sites, often by watersides, in regions with hot summers and cold to mild winters.

== Description ==
It is a medium-sized deciduous tree, growing to heights of up to (rarely more), with a trunk up to in diameter and a broad, rounded crown. The bark is smooth and greenish-white to greyish-white with characteristic diamond-shaped dark marks on young trees, becoming blackish and fissured at the base of old trees. The young shoots are covered with whitish-grey down, including the small buds. The leaves are long, five-lobed, with a thick covering of white scurfy down on both sides, but thicker underneath; this layer wears off long, produced in early spring; they are dioecious, with male and female catkins on separate trees; the male catkins are grey with conspicuous dark red stamens, the female catkins are greyish-green. The female catkins lengthen to after pollination, with several green seed capsules, maturing in late spring to early summer. It also propagates by means of root suckers growing from the lateral roots, often as far as from the trunk, to form extensive clonal colonies.

== Hybridization ==

White poplar hybridizes with the closely related common aspen &quot;Populus tremula&quot;; the resulting hybrid, known as grey poplar (&quot;Populus × canescens&quot;), is intermediate between its parents, with a thin, grey, downy coating on the leaves, which are also much less deeply lobed than white poplar leaves. It exhibits marked hybrid vigour, reaching tall and a trunk diameter over , much larger than either of its parents. Most grey poplars in cultivation are male, but female trees occur naturally and some of these are also propagated.

== Cultivation and uses ==


The wood is soft but close-grained and easy to carve, shrinking very little during seasoning. It has been used for sculpture from Europe to China and the US. The &quot;Penitent Magdalene&quot; by Donatello is one 15th-century example.

It was the most commonly used wood for panel paintings in Italy throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance, until mostly replaced as a matrix by canvas from 1500 onwards. Most earlier Italian Renaissance paintings are painted on poplar panels, the &quot;Mona Lisa&quot; being but one example.

White poplar requires abundant light and ample moisture, and stands up well to flood water and slightly acidic soils. Its green-and-white leaves make it an effective ornamental tree, but the root suckers may cause problems in some situations. It is very attractive as an open-grown tree in water meadows, and because of its extensive root system and tolerance of salt, is also planted to strengthen coastal sand dunes.

A yellow dye is produced from the bark of the white poplar.

The majority of white poplars in cultivation in northern Europe are female trees.

===Americas===
White poplar was first introduced to North America in 1748 and has a long history in cultivation. It is now found in 43 states throughout the contiguous U.S. It has come to be considered weedy or invasive; it has been banned in Connecticut and is the most common introduced tree species on Cape Breton Island.

In US intensive forest management, it is being replaced by various &quot;Populus&quot; sect. &quot;Aigeiros&quot; hybrids. The wood is soft, and used for cellulose and to make cheap boxes.

It also grows in the temperate zones of South America. Mainly in Chile, Argentina and Uruguay A conical cultivar from Turkestan, &quot;Populus alba&quot; &#x27;Pyramidalis&#x27; (Bolle&#x27;s poplar; syn. &quot;P. bolleana&quot;) is sometimes planted in parks.

== History ==
An Old English name &quot;abele&quot;, now not used, is derived from the Latin &quot;albellus&quot;, white, by way of Old French &quot;aubel&quot; and Low German name &quot;abeel&quot;.

Leuce/Leuka, the &quot;White Poplar&quot;; Leuce or Leuka (Ancient Greek: Λεύκη) (&quot;White&quot; or specifically &quot;White Poplar&quot;) was the most beautiful of the nymphs and an Oceanid, a daughter of Oceanus. Hades fell in love with her and abducted her to the underworld. She lived out the span of her life in his realm, and when she died, the god sought consolation by creating a suitable memorial of their love: In the Elysian Fields, where the pious spend their afterlives, he brought forth a white tree into existence from her body, which became sacred for him from that moment on. In Ancient Greco-Roman mythology, it is a symbol of a peaceful afterlife and a memory of those we love who have died, and in the language of flowers, its meaning is &quot;time&quot;. Herakles crowned himself with this tree to celebrate his return from the underworld.

According to ancient Roman mythology, the white poplar was consecrated to Hercules because he destroyed Cacus in a cavern adjoining the Aventine Hill, which was covered with these trees; in the moment of his triumph, he bound his brows with a branch of white poplar as a token of his victory. Persons offering sacrifices to Hercules were always crowned with branches of this tree, and all who had gloriously conquered their enemies in battle wore garlands of it, in imitation of Hercules. Homer in &quot;Iliad&quot; compares the fall of Simoisius when killed by Ajax to that of a poplar. 

Ovid mentions that Paris had carved the name of Ænone on a poplar, as Shakespeare has Orlando carve the name of Rosalind upon the trees of the forest of Arden.

Virgil gives directions for the culture of this tree and Horace speaks of the white poplar as delighting to grow on the banks of rivers.

== Invasive potential ==
The white poplar is an invasive species in many parts of Australia. In Western Australia, it has formed dense stands in disturbed wetlands from Perth to Albany and it is considered a threat to riparian vegetation in Victoria. It has spread along the Murrumbidgee River and in wet areas in rural parts of the Australian Capital Territory. Despite that, it is still sold in nurseries around Australia. White poplar is also an environmental weed in South Africa.

<text>Joint Regulation 4120.15E: Designating and Naming Military Aerospace Vehicles is the current system for designating all aircraft, helicopters, rockets, missiles, spacecraft, and other aerial vehicles in military use by the United States Armed Forces.

== History ==
United States Department of Defense Directive 4120.15 &quot;Designating and Naming Military Aircraft, Rockets, and Guided Missiles&quot; was originally issued November 24, 1971 and named the Air Force as the Executive Agent empowered to carry out the directive. Directive 4120.15 was implemented by Air Force Regulation (AFR) 82-1/Army Regulation (AR) 70-50/Naval Material Command Instruction (NAVMATINST) 8800.4A on March 27, 1974. The Joint Regulation designation system was heavily based upon the 1962 US Tri-Service aircraft designation system but also took control of the previously separate designation system for missiles and drones.

The current version was enacted by Joint Regulation 4120.15E Designating and Naming Military Aerospace Vehicles and was implemented via Air Force Instruction (AFI) 16-401, Army Regulation (AR) 70-50, Naval Air Systems Command Instruction (NAVAIRINST) 13100.16 November 3, 2020. The list of US military aircraft was kept via 4120.15-L Model Designation of Military Aerospace Vehicles 31 August 2018 until its transition to data.af.mil.

== Overview ==
There are two basic components to a craft&#x27;s identity: its vehicle designation and its popular name. A vehicle designation is sometimes referred to as a Mission Design Series (MDS), referring to the three main parts of the designation that combine to form a unique profile for each vehicle. The first letters (up to four) signify the type of craft and its &quot;mission&quot;. The design number, preceded by a dash &quot;-&quot;, essentially signifies the product &quot;design&quot; of the aircraft (i.e. design 16 in F-16A). The series number identifies the specific &quot;production model of a particular design number&quot; with subsequent &quot;series&quot; indicating major revisions or changes. Finally, there may be variant and block identifiers which clarify the exact configuration of the vehicle.

The popular name is a matter of less specific construction, but is aimed at providing an official common name which eases identification and communication regarding the vehicle. The popular name is not used in official internal publications (an official internal report would refer to the &quot;F-16&quot; and &quot;AIM-9&quot; but not mention the names &quot;Fighting Falcon&quot; or &quot;Sidewinder&quot;). The popular name may be based on the manufacturer&#x27;s internal name for the craft but all popular names must have the manufacturer&#x27;s permission and be approved by the DoD. Pilots often have their own nicknames for their aircraft which may bear only coincidental resemblance (if that) to the official popular name, although some pilot nicknames are similar or even derived from the official popular name (such as &quot;Bug&quot; and &quot;Super Bug&quot; for the F/A-18 Hornet and F/A-18E/F Super Hornet).

There are seven potential components of a system&#x27;s MDS designation as well as three potential components which are not included in the MDS.

==Aircraft designation==
=== Status prefix ===

=== Modified mission symbols ===
Many craft have been designed for more specific missions than their basic mission symbol would indicate, and many design series have been designed for different missions than the original design, and may or may not still maintain capability for the original mission. The modified mission symbol provides the services the ability to accurately indicate a craft&#x27;s mission without losing commonality with the basic design MDS. If utilized, the modified mission symbol is placed as a prefix directly in front of the basic mission symbol (but after any applicable status prefix, see above). Modified mission symbols are not used for rockets and missiles. Currently authorized modified mission symbols are:


=== Basic mission symbol ===
The basic mission symbol is the heart of the mission part of the designation. No designation is without it, and some designations consist of only a basic mission symbol for the mission part, such as the F-14 or C-130. The following are the officially authorized basic mission symbols:

;A: Attack. Attack craft are designed to directly attack enemy land or sea targets, interdict enemy movements and support, and strike precision targets. Examples are the A-6 Intruder and A-10 Thunderbolt II.

;B: Bomber. Bombers are designed to attack strategic and tactical targets with heavy bomb loads and missiles. They carry heavy loads of free-fall and stand-off weaponry. Examples are the B-52 Stratofortress and B-2A Spirit.

;C: Cargo. Transports are designed to carry cargo and passengers to provide tactical logistical support and strategic mobility to other forces. Examples are the C-2 Greyhound and C-130 Hercules.

;E: Electronic. Electronics craft are designed explicitly to fulfill electronic specialty missions such as ECM, ACC, AEW, and communications. Examples are the E-2 Hawkeye and E-3 Sentry.

;F: Fighter. Fighters are designed to intercept and engage enemy aircraft and missiles. It is also a catch-all for multi-mission aircraft, even if it is primarily designed for ground-attack purpose. Examples are the F-22 Raptor and F-16 Fighting Falcon.

;L: Laser. Laser craft are those that are primarily designed to employ laser weaponry against air and ground targets. This is a very new designation, and only applies to the AL-1 airborne laser (ABL) program.

;O: Observation. Observation craft are designed to maintain observation over land, primarily territory either held by enemy forces or susceptible to infiltration. Unlike reconnaissance craft, they loiter over area providing observation over time. Examples are the O-1 Bird Dog and OV-10 Bronco.

;P: Patrol. Patrol craft are designed for maritime reconnaissance missions, including anti-submarine warfare. Example is the P-3 Orion.

;R: Reconnaissance: Reconnaissance craft are designed to conduct reconnaissance through photographic and electrical means, example SR-71.

;S: Anti-submarine: Anti-submarine warfare (ASW) craft are designed to locate and attack enemy submarines. Example is the S-3 Viking.

;T: Trainer: Trainers are aircraft used to train aircrews. Examples are the T-6 Texan II and T-45 Goshawk.

;U: Utility: Utility craft are utilized for miscellaneous missions and base support, like the U-3A. The U designation has also been used to obfuscate an aircraft&#x27;s true purpose or capabilities, like with the U-2.

;X: Research: Research craft are designed for experimental and developmental research programs. Unlike the &quot;X&quot; mission modifier, the &quot;X&quot; basic mission symbol is used for craft solely designed for this purpose, with no operational mission intended or feasible. Examples are the entire series of &quot;X-planes&quot; from the Bell &quot;X-1&quot; on.

=== Vehicle type symbols ===
For non-standard vehicle types (vehicles other than piloted, fixed-wing and self-propelled aircraft which are wholly supported by aerodynamic lift from liftoff to touchdown), a final symbol is added after the basic mission symbol to identify the vehicle type. Current applicable symbols are as follow:

;D: UAV Control Segment. Equipment used to control unmanned aircraft. An example is the MD-1A, used to launch, control, and recover the MQ-1 and MQ-9 drones.

;G: Glider. A glider is a fixed-wing aircraft designed to use air currents for normal lift, although it may have an engine. An example is the TG-15A training glider.

;H: Helicopter. A helicopter is any rotary-wing aircraft, like the UH-60.

;Q: Unmanned. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is any aircraft without capacity for a human pilot, but not applied to missiles or rockets. Examples include MQ-1 Predator and RQ-11.

;S: Spaceplane. A spaceplane is a vehicle designed to fly beyond earth&#x27;s atmosphere and return. This vehicle code was poorly chosen, as it conflicts with the mission code S (Anti-Submarine Warfare). &quot;ES&quot; could equally designate a spaceplane designed specifically for electronic warfare or an anti-submarine plane modified for that purpose.

;V: V/STOL. A Vertical and/or Short Takeoff and Landing aircraft is designed to take-off and land vertically, but not rely on rotary-wing lift for flight. This includes vectored thrust aircraft such as the AV-8 Harrier and tiltrotors such as the V-22 Osprey. It also applies to aircraft of the normal fixed-wing configuration that are capable of taking off and landing in a short runway space, such as the OV-10 Bronco.

;Z: Lighter than air. A lighter than air craft is designed to remain aloft through buoyancy of lighter than air gases. Such craft include blimps and balloons. An example is the SZ-1A.

===Design number===
The design number is separated from the earlier components by a dash. Design numbers run consecutively from 1 to 999.

===Series===
The series letter follows the design number and progresses consecutively starting with A. In the event the series letter &quot;Z&quot; is used, the design number will progress to the next unused number and series will begin again at &quot;A&quot;. To avoid confusion, series &quot;I&quot; and &quot;O&quot; are not used.

===Additional Components===

====Configuration/Component number====
Configuration/component numbers signify changes that &quot;affect performance, tactics, or integral components of a weapon system.&quot; They appear to the right of the series symbol and are separated from the series symbol by a dash.

====Block number====
The block number specifies a group of aircraft produced to the same specifications by the manufacturer. Block numbers are assigned in multiples of 5 (01, 05, 10). An example is F-16C Block 25.

====Serial number====
Serial numbers are located on the tail and identify a specific aircraft. For example, MH-53M Pave Low IV serial number 68-10357 was the Pave Low which carried the mission commanders during the Sơn Tây raid. For more information on serial numbering of military aircraft, see United States military aircraft serial numbers.

==Rockets/missiles==

=== Status prefix ===
Status prefix is an optional prefix not always used for vehicles in regular service. If used, it is the first letter in the MDS. Authorized current status prefixes are:
;e: Digitally developed. Vehicles that are developed in a digital environment.

;C: Captive. Only used for rockets and missiles, C applies to rockets/missiles that are designed to be carried in their launch environment but are incapable of being launched/fired. They may contain guidance and control electronics but the engine and warhead are typically inert or ballasted.

;D: Dummy. Only used for rockets and missiles which are non-flying, primarily for ground training. All guidance, control electronics, engine, and warhead are inert or ballasted.

;J: Temporary Special Test. Applied to craft involved with special testing of temporarily installed equipment. The &quot;J&quot; prefix is used for aircraft that can be reasonably returned to their original configuration following tests. An example is aircraft used as testbeds for new electronics, but which will or may not retain that equipment after tests are complete.

;N: Permanent Special Test. Applied to craft involved with special testing on a permanent basis, with modifications to their configuration that make return to original configuration impractical. Many military aircraft transferred to NASA for aeronautical research carry this designation.

;X: Experimental. Applied to craft which are not yet accepted for service, or to prototypes for which standard configuration has not been finalized. Most prototypes of the past carried this prefix, but it should not be confused with craft given an &quot;X&quot; basic mission symbol. The &quot;X&quot; status prefix is for designs for other missions, but at an experimental stage of the design process.

;Y: Prototype. Originally applied to demonstration craft where configuration had been determined, but from the 1970s on applied to all prototypes of aircraft intended for production.

;Z: Planning. Applied to designs in the planning/pre-development phase.

=== Rocket/missile launch environment ===
All rockets and missiles contain a symbol to indicate the launch method, be it from the air, ground, sea, etc. The following are the currently authorized symbols for launch environments. These are not used for other aerospace vehicles.

;A: Air-launched. The missile is launched from an airborne vehicle. Example is the AIM-9 Sidewinder dogfighting missile.

;B: Multiple. The missile can be launched from various environments. The BGM-109 Tomahawk, for instance, can launch from a ground unit, aircraft, or ship-mounted launcher.

;C: Coffin. Stored in an unhardened container horizontally or less than 45 degree angle and either launched horizontally or raised vertical for launch. Coffin launchers may be either on land or at sea. An example is the CGM-16 ICBM.

;F: Individual. The missile is launched by an individual soldier in the field, otherwise referred to as man-portable. Example is the FIM-92 Stinger, a light man-portable surface-to-air missile (SAM).

;G: Ground. The missile is launched directly from the ground surface, including runways.

;H: Silo-Stored. The missile stored vertically in a silo but raised to ground level for launch. An example is the Atlas-F.

;L: Silo-Launched. The missile is launched from its storage silo, below ground.

;M: Mobile. The missile is launched from a mobile ground vehicle or movable platform.

;P: Pad. Like a traditional space rocket, the missile is stored and launched from an unprotected or partially protected ground facility.

;R: Ship. The missile is launched from a ship or barge.

;S: Space. The missile is launched from a spacecraft. This is so far used only for the upper stage of another rocket like the SSB-8 Centaur.

;U: Underwater. The missile is launched from a submarine or underwater device.

=== Rocket/missile mission symbol ===
Rockets and missiles are assigned a single mission symbol, which usually denotes the intended target type of the missile. For most types of missile, the combination of launch environment and mission symbols form a from-to combination (surface-to-air, ship-to-submarine) that gives one a good idea of the potential uses for the missile.

;C: Transport. Applies to vehicles designed to carry cargo and deliver it to a location. This can also be used to designate a carrier for electronics or weapons systems.

;D: Decoy. Applies to vehicles that function as decoys for defeating enemy anti-aircraft and anti-missile defenses.

;E: Electronics. Applies to vehicles that carry out electronic missions such as communications or countermeasures.

;G: Ground. Applies to vehicles designed to attack surface targets, including vehicles.

;I: Intercept. Applies to vehicles designed to attack aerial targets, in an offensive or defensive capacity.

;L: Launch detection/surveillance. Applies to vehicles designed to detect launch of missiles and track and identify enemy aircraft and missiles. This also applies to detection and monitoring of space launches and re-entry.

;M: Scientific/Calibration. Applies to vehicles designed to collect scientific data.

;N: Navigation. Applies to vehicles which provide navigational assistance.

;Q: Drone. Applies to a vehicle designed to be remotely controlled. Ballistic/semi-ballistic vehicles, cruise missiles, and artillery projectiles are not considered drones.

;S: Space support. Applies to vehicles designed to support space programs and activities.

;T: Training. Applies to aircraft used in training.

;U: Underwater Attack. Applies to vehicles designed to attack submarines and underwater targets.

;W: Weather. Applies to vehicles designed to obtain weather data and collect aerial samples.

=== Vehicle type symbol ===
For rockets and missiles, the vehicle type symbol identifies the basic vehicle type and will be the final symbol in the mission part of the MDS.

;B: Booster. Boosters are primary or auxiliary propulsion units for other vehicles.

;M: Guided Missile. Guided missiles are unmanned vehicles flying a path controlled by a guidance system.

;N: Probe. Probes are non-orbital unmanned vehicles designed primarily to collect data within the aerospace environment.

;R: Rocket. Rockets are single-use unmanned vehicles without guidance after launch.

;S: Satellite. Satellites are space vehicles which orbit the earth and used to collect and transmit various data.

===Design number===
The design number is separated from the earlier components by a dash. Design numbers run consecutively from 1 to 999.

===Series===
The series letter follows the design number and progresses consecutively starting with A. In the event the series letter &quot;Z&quot; is used, the design number will progress to the next unused number and series will begin again at &quot;A&quot;. To avoid confusion, series &quot;I&quot; and &quot;O&quot; are not used.

===Additional Components===

;Configuration/Component number
Configuration/component numbers signify changes that &quot;affect performance, tactics, or integral components of a weapon system.&quot; They appear to the right of the series symbol and are separated from the series symbol by a dash.

;Block number
The block number specifies a group of aircraft produced to the same specifications by the manufacturer. Block numbers are assigned in multiples of 5 (01, 05, 10).

;Serial number
Serial numbers are located on the tail and identify a specific rocket/missile. For more information on serial numbering of military aircraft, see United States military aircraft serial numbers.

==Exceptions==
* The F-117 Nighthawk does not currently have any air-to-air capabilities but was not designated A-117. There has been conjecture and anecdotal reports concerning purported air-to-air capabilities targeted toward destroying Soviet AWACS craft.
* The OA-1K Sky Warden is designated as a new version of the unrelated A-1 Skyraider of which the last version was the A-1J.
* Although the mission letters of the AV-8 Harrier&#x27;s designation are correct, the series number was already used in the Ryan XV-8 (&quot;Fleep&quot;) if following the system, the Harrier would have been named AV-12.
* The &quot;FB-111&quot; was originally a fighter that was adapted to the bomber role. Thus it should have been designated BF-111.
* The CC-130J Hercules referred to the stretched C-130J-30 Hercules. The -30 suffix was not supportable in the system, so a modified mission letter had to be added. Hence, the CC-130J is a cargo aircraft &quot;modified&quot; for the cargo role. This was later dropped. The CC-130J should not be confused with the CC-130 Hercules operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force. The first &quot;C&quot; identifies the aircraft as a Canadian asset. Canada later acquired C-130Js as &quot;CC-130Js&quot;.
* Many manufacturers have used non-standard modifiers for commercial purposes; for instance, the Spanish F/A-18 Hornets were &#x27;designated&#x27; EF-18 by McDonnell Douglas (the E standing for España , the native name for Spain, and AH-64D Apache helicopters were designated &#x27;WAH-64&#x27; by licensed manufacturer Westland. Non-standard series letters, especially ones the U.S. Air Force has no intention of progressing to, are often used to designate the intended country of use, such as I (Israel - e.g. F-15I), J (Japan), K (South Korea or United Kingdom), S (Saudi Arabia) and SG (Singapore).

<doc id="1115597" wikidata="Q1139921" url="?curid=1115597" title="King's Chapel">
<text>King&#x27;s Chapel is an American independent Christian unitarian congregation affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist Association that is &quot;unitarian Christian in theology, Anglican in worship, and congregational in governance.&quot; It is housed in what was for a time after the Revolution called the &quot;Stone Chapel&quot;, an 18th-century structure at the corner of Tremont Street and School Street in Boston, Massachusetts. The chapel building, completed in 1754, is one of the finest designs of the noted colonial architect Peter Harrison, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960 for its architectural significance. The congregation has worshipped according to a Unitarian version of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; since 1785, currently in its ninth edition.

Despite its name, the adjacent King&#x27;s Chapel Burying Ground is not affiliated with the chapel or any other church; it pre-dates the present church by over a century.

==History==
The King&#x27;s Chapel congregation was founded by Royal Governor Sir Edmund Andros in 1686 as the first Anglican Church in colonial New England during the reign of King James II. The original King&#x27;s Chapel was a wooden church built in 1688 at the corner of Tremont and School Streets, where the church stands today. It was situated on the public burying ground, now King&#x27;s Chapel Burying Ground, because no resident would sell land for a church that was not Congregationalist (at the time, the Congregational church was the official religion of Massachusetts).
In 1749, construction began on the current stone structure, which was designed by Peter Harrison and completed in 1754. The stone church was built around the wooden church. When the stone church was complete, the wooden church was disassembled and removed through the windows of the new church. The wood was then shipped to Lunenburg, Nova Scotia, where it was used to construct St. John&#x27;s Anglican Church. That church was destroyed by fire on Halloween night, 2001. It has since been rebuilt. Originally, there were plans to add a steeple, although funding shortfalls prevented this from happening.

During the American Revolution, the chapel sat vacant and was referred to as the &quot;Stone Chapel&quot;. The Loyalist families left for Nova Scotia and England, and those who remained reopened the church in 1782. It became Unitarian under the ministry of James Freeman, who revised the 1662 English edition of the &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; along Unitarian lines in 1785. Although Freeman still considered King&#x27;s Chapel to be Episcopalian, the Episcopal Church&#x27;s first bishop Samuel Seabury refused to ordain him. The church still follows its own Anglican-style hybrid liturgy. It is a member congregation of the Unitarian Universalist Association.
==Interior==

Inside, the church is characterized by wooden columns with Corinthian capitals that were hand-carved by William Burbeck and his apprentices in 1758. The pulpit and inscribed wooden panels behind the altar are older than the present chapel; the pulpit dates to the early 18th century and the altar panels to the late 17th century. Both were originally part of the wooden chapel that predated the present stone building.

Seating in the chapel provided in box pews, most of which were originally owned by the member families who paid pew rent and decorated the pews to their personal tastes. Additional seating was provided in balconies on either side of the nave, level with the organ loft and choir benches. The current uniform appearance of the pews dates from the 1920s. 

Pew No. 30 is the Governor&#x27;s Pew, originally reserved for Jonathan Belcher, then Royal Governor of Massachusetts. Belcher&#x27;s son, Jonathan Jr., was wed in the chapel in 1756. On October 27, 1789, the Governor&#x27;s Pew was occupied by George Washington. 

Music has long been an important part of King&#x27;s Chapel, which acquired its first organ in 1713, bequeathed to the congregation by Puritan minister Thomas Brattle. Other organs that followed were built by Richard Bridge, Hook &amp; Hastings, and Simmons &amp; Willcox. The fifth organ installed in the chapel was a large 1909 E.M. Skinner organ. It had been a gift from Frank E. Peabody in memory of his deceased son Everett. The present organ, the sixth installed in King&#x27;s Chapel, was built by C.B. Fisk in 1964. It is decorated with miters and carvings from the Bridge organ of 1756, and it is slightly below average in size compared with most mid-1900s European chapel organs. For forty-two years starting in 1958, the eminent American composer Daniel Pinkham was the organist and music director at King&#x27;s Chapel. He was succeeded by Heinrich Christensen.

The King&#x27;s Chapel bell, cast in England, was hung in 1772. In 1814 it cracked, was recast by Paul Revere and Sons, and was rehung. It is the largest bell cast by the Revere foundry, and the last one cast during Paul Revere&#x27;s lifetime. It has been rung at services ever since.

Within King&#x27;s Chapel is a monument to Samuel Vassall, brother of the colonist William Vassall, a patentee of the Massachusetts Bay Company, and an early deputy of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Samuel Vassall of London was also named a member of the Company in its 1629 royal charter but never sailed for New England, instead remaining in London to tend to business affairs; his brother William frequently clashed with John Winthrop, and eventually removed himself to Scituate, Massachusetts. The monument to Vassall, London merchant, mentions his resistance to King Charles&#x27;s taxes imposed on Tonnage and Poundage, especially as Parliament had refused the King&#x27;s request for a lifetime extension. Vassall subsequently represented the City of London as a Member of Parliament (1640–1641), which restored some of Vassall&#x27;s estate. Later Vassalls in Massachusetts, including William Vassall for whom Vassalboro, Maine was named, were Loyalists and fled to England during the American Revolutionary War.

<doc id="1115613" wikidata="Q460349" url="?curid=1115613" title="Dora Marsden">
<text>Dora Marsden (5 March 1882 – 13 December 1960) was an English suffragette, editor of literary journals, and philosopher of language. Beginning her career as an activist in the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU), Marsden eventually broke off from the suffragist organization in order to found a journal that would provide a space for more radical voices in the movement. Her prime importance lies with her contributions to the suffrage movement, her criticism of the Pankhursts&#x27; WSPU, and her radical feminism, via &quot;The Freewoman&quot;. There are those who also claim she has relevance to the emergence of literary modernism, while others value her contribution to the understanding of Egoism.

== Early life ==
Dora Marsden was born on 5 March 1882 to working-class parents, Fred and Hannah, in Marsden, Yorkshire. Economic setbacks in Fred&#x27;s business forced him to emigrate to the U.S. in 1890, settling in Philadelphia with his eldest son. Hannah worked as a seamstress to support her remaining children, which left the family living in poverty when Marsden was a child. Among one of the first generations to benefit from the Elementary Education Act 1870 (33 &amp; 34 Vict. c. 75), Marsden was able to attend school as a child despite her impoverished circumstances. She proved a successful student, working as a tutor at the age of thirteen before receiving a Queen&#x27;s Scholarship at the age of eighteen, which enabled her to attend Owens College in Manchester (later the Victoria University of Manchester). In 1903, Marsden graduated from college and taught school for several years, eventually becoming headmistress of the Altrincham Teacher-Pupil Center in 1908.
In October 1909, Marsden was arrested with several other members of the Women&#x27;s Social and Political Union (WSPU) for dressing in full academic regalia and interrupting a speech by the chancellor of their alma mater, demanding that he speak out against the force-feeding of imprisoned suffragist alumni who were on hunger strike. A few months later, she broke into the Southport Empire Theatre and hoisted herself into the cupola, where she waited 15 hours in order to heckle Winston Churchill, who was soon to become Home Secretary, while he was speaking at an election rally. Marsden was arrested with a deputation to Parliament which was widely reported at the time. 

Marsden&#x27;s commitment to the cause earned her an administrative position in Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst’s WSPU, for which she left her teaching position in 1909. Although she was dedicated to the early feminist movement, Marsden&#x27;s strong theoretical principles and independent disposition often brought her into conflict with WSPU leadership, who found her unmanageable. In 1911, Marsden mutually agreed with the Pankhursts to resign her position with the WSPU. Disaffected by the organization, but still committed to the women&#x27;s movement, she was determined to find ways to support alternative voices relevant to the cause.

==Work as editor==

Marsden was not the only English suffragette to balk at the rigid hierarchy of the WSPU under the Pankhursts, and she decided to begin publishing a journal, &quot;The Freewoman&quot;, that would showcase a wide range of dissenting voices from the women&#x27;s movement initially, and eventually from other radical movements as well. This was the first of three successive journals that Marsden would start between 1911 and 1918, with the publication dates of each magazine running as follows: &quot;The Freewoman&quot;, November 1911 – October 1912; &quot;The New Freewoman&quot;, June 1913 – December 1913; &quot;The Egoist&quot;, January 1914 – December 1919. With continuous publication between the second and third, and only a short break between the first and second, critics have had difficulty deciding to what extent the journals should be considered part of the same intellectual project. Consensus seems to rest on the sense that the journals reflect Marsden&#x27;s shifting political and aesthetic interests, so that the three journals are closely related, but not identical projects, with &quot;The New Freewoman&quot; closer in spirit to &quot;The Egoist&quot; than either was to the original journal. 

In 1911, Marsden was becoming increasingly interested in egoism and individualist anarchism, an intellectual shift whose development is plainly visible in her editorial columns, where, as the issues progress, the scope of discussion widens to include a wide range of topics pertinent to anarchist theoreticians of the time. Many anarchist thinkers of the time were drawn to emergent avant-garde movements that would later be brought together under the term &quot;modernism&quot;.

===&quot;The Freewoman&quot;===
&quot;The Freewoman&quot; was a short-lived magazine that Marsden founded in order to voice her thoughts and critiques of the WSPU under Pankhurst. She argued that the organization was far too narrowly focused on middle class women. The journal also explored London&#x27;s literary background and provided a medium for cultural debate among feminists and other opinionated groups.
This journal was famous for its overtly feminist advertisements that were scattered throughout the pages. At the beginning of publications it had advertisements that were for businesses such as patent agencies that were geared towards &quot;Women Patentees&quot;, a bank that took care of the &quot;Going Stock Business&quot;, and the International Suffrage Shop.

The magazine dealt with controversial issues such as marriage and free love, with Marsden and other authors writing in support of the latter. Marsden held that monogamy had four cornerstones: men&#x27;s hypocrisy; the spinster&#x27;s dumb resignation; the Prostitute&#x27;s unsightly degradation; and the married woman&#x27;s monopoly. Writers such as Rebecca West wrote that by giving her body to a man to be owned by him for the rest of their life, while binding the man to support her for the rest of her life, a woman strikes a disgraceful ‘bargain’.

This magazine also issued a five-part series on morality written by Marsden. She explored the idea that women had been taught to restrain their passions for life, resulting in an existence only used for reproduction. This brought her back to her critique of the Suffrage Movement, and their image of purity and the middle class woman. After its financial collapse, it soon emerged into the New Freewoman.

===&quot;The New Freewoman&quot;===
&quot;The New Freewoman&quot; shifted the view of &quot;The Freewoman&quot;, which was a radical feminist view, to an idealistic anarchism and literary experimentalism. The bold advertisements were changed to text-only ads, and the magazine took on a much different approach. This developed into Marsden&#x27;s view on egoism as a philosophy, which was heavily influenced by Ezra Pound.

These two journals became heavily influenced by Rebecca West and Mary Gawthorpe. The two women set out to increase the audience of &quot;The New Freewoman&quot;, by increasing their literary content. This would result in more writers expressing interest in the journal, and resulting in more readers. Although &quot;The New Freewoman&quot; did not last very long itself, it progressed into a very popular journal &quot;The Egoist&quot;.

===&quot;The Egoist&quot;===
==Marsden&#x27;s philosophical legacy==

Marsden&#x27;s magnum opus, produced later in her life, was not well received (not even by her former supporters) and she suffered a psychological breakdown in 1930, which was further deepened by the death of her mother in 1935. It is said that her moods fluctuated between very optimistic or pessimistic views of her work and that she developed delusional beliefs. In 1935 Marsden was admitted to the Crichton Royal Hospital located in Dumfries where she lived for the rest of her life. The hospital classified her as severely depressed. Marsden died of a heart attack on 13 December 1960. A full-length biography by Les Garner - &quot;Dora Marsden: a Brave and Beautiful Spirit&quot; - was published by 127 House in 2019.

<text>The Great Seal of North Carolina is used to authenticate certain documents issued by the Government of North Carolina. The Great Seal was modified to its present form in 1983.

== Design ==

According to an act passed by the North Carolina General Assembly on April 8, 1971, and amended in 1983:

&quot;The background on the seal shall contain a depiction of mountains running from the left to the right to the middle of the seal. A side view of a three-masted ship shall be located on the ocean and to the right of Plenty. The date &quot;May 20, 1775&quot; shall appear within the seal and across the top of the seal and the words &quot;esse quam videri&quot; shall appear at the bottom around the perimeter. No other words, figures or other embellishments shall appear on the seal

== History ==

In 1971, the seal was officially adopted after the state&#x27;s chief deputy attorney general discovered that there was more than one version in use. In 1983, state senator Julian R. Allsbrook proposed a revision to the seal to add to the seal the date April 12, 1776, the date of the Halifax Resolves; this revision was approved by the state legislature. These two dates are also on the flag of North Carolina.

<doc id="1115620" wikidata="Q2077424" url="?curid=1115620" title="Froxfield">
<text>Froxfield is a village and civil parish in the English county of Wiltshire. The parish is on the Wiltshire-West Berkshire border, and the village lies on the A4 national route about west of Hungerford and east of Marlborough.

Froxfield village is on a stream that is a tributary of the River Dun. The road between London and Bristol follows the valley of the stream and passes through the village, having followed this course since at least the 13th century.

The Kennet and Avon Canal follows the Dun valley through Froxfield parish, passing within of the village. The canal has a series of locks in the parish, from Oakhill Down Lock to Froxfield Bottom Lock. The Reading to Taunton railway line also follows the river through the parish below the village.

==Archaeology==
There used to be three bowl barrows in the south-west part of the parish, close to the boundary with Chisbury parish. These suggest human occupation in the area some time in the Neolithic or Bronze Age.

In 1725 the remains of a Roman villa were found at Rudge Coppice about north-west of the village. Remains excavated on the site include a Roman mosaic floor depicting the figure of a man, coins, human burials, a stone statuette of Attis and a champlevé-enamelled bronze bowl known as the Rudge Cup, that appears to depict Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, and lists its five westernmost forts.

== History ==
The Kennet and Avon Canal was opened through Froxfield parish in 1799, and the Berks and Hants Extension Railway took the same route, immediately north of the canal, in 1862. The nearest station was some southwest of Froxfield village, at Great Bedwyn. The canal was restored in the 1970s; the railway and station are still in use.

The population of Froxfield parish peaked at 625 at the 1841 census, owing to stagecoach activity along the Bath road; numbers declined steadily as traffic took to the railways. Between 1951 and 1981 the population was below 300, then increased after housebuilding during the 1980s.

RAF Ramsbury, used by the United States Army Air Forces between 1942 and 1946, extended into the extreme north of the parish.

===Manor===
Between AD 801 and 805, one Byrhtelm granted land at Froxfield to Ealhmund, Bishop of Winchester. There is no further record of Froxfield&#x27;s manorial tenure from then until the 13th century. The Domesday Book of 1086 does not mention Froxfield, and may therefore have included the manor as part of another landholding.

Froxfield reappears in the historical record in 1242–43, when Baldwin de Redvers, 6th Earl of Devon was its feudal overlord. In 1275 the overlord was Baldwin&#x27;s heir Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon, but there is no evidence of Froxfield passing to her heirs. John de Cobham, 3rd Baron Cobham was overlord in 1389, but there is no record of Froxfield&#x27;s overlordship thereafter.

Manorial tenants of Froxfield included Walter Marshal, 5th Earl of Pembroke (died 1245) and John Droxford, who was Bishop of Bath and Wells 1309–1329.

In 1390 Sir William Sturmy gave the manor to Easton Priory, which then held Froxfield until the Dissolution of the Monasteries. In 1536 the Crown granted the manor to Sir Edward Seymour, Viscount Beauchamp, who in 1547 made himself Duke of Somerset. After the death of John Seymour, 4th Duke of Somerset in 1675, his widow Sarah Seymour, Duchess of Somerset married Henry Hare, 2nd Baron Coleraine. However, when she died in 1694 she left most of Froxfield Manor as an endowment to found the Broad Town charity and Duchess of Somerset&#x27;s Hospital almshouses (see below). The hospital sold most of its lands in the parish in 1920–22.

In 1922 Sir Ernest Wills, 3rd Baronet, part-owner of the W.D. &amp; H.O. Wills tobacco company, bought Froxfield Manor Farm, before purchasing the adjacent Elizabethan country house, Littlecote House, in 1929. In 1965 William Geoffrey Rootes, 2nd Baron Rootes bought some other parts of the manor lands and added them to his estate of North Standen and Oakhill. In 1995 Wills&#x27;s grandson Sir Seton Wills, 5th Baronet still held part of the original estate north of London Road.

==Church and chapel==
The Church of England parish church of All Saints is from the 12th century and is built of flint and sarsen. The chancel was rebuilt in the 13th century with Early English Gothic lancet windows. In the 14th new windows were inserted in the nave and a north door was added. The Perpendicular Gothic west window is 15th century, as is the partly timber-framed porch. The font is from the 12th or 13th century. There are two bells, one cast c.1699 and the other in 1887.

In 1891–92 All Saints&#x27; was restored under the direction of the Gothic Revival architect Ewan Christian. His alterations included replacing the bell-turret with a more elaborate one, replacing a plain south window in the nave with an elaborate one in 15th-century style and replacing the vestry with a larger vestry and organ chamber in the style of a north transept. The church was designated as Grade II* listed in 1966. The parish has been served by a team ministry since 1976, and today is part of the Whitton Team, a group of six churches.

A Methodist congregation was established in Froxfield by 1834, when two houses in the village were licensed for Wesleyan Methodist worship. A small red-brick Primitive Methodist chapel was built on Brewhouse Hill in 1909; it closed for worship in about 1962.

==Somerset charities==

When Sarah Seymour, Duchess of Somerset died in 1694, her substantial will of 1686 included two charities relevant to Froxfield. The Broad Town charity was to help young men with their education or to enter apprenticeships. It is now the Broad Town Trust, and since 1990 it has been open to young women applicants as well as young men.

The Duchess also willed that almshouses and a chapel be built at Froxfield for 30 widows from Berkshire, Somerset, Wiltshire, London and Westminster, of whom half were to be widows of clergy. She willed that the Rector of Huish was to either serve as chaplain or provide another clergyman to do so; in practice the parish priest of Froxfield has usually served the hospital in his place.

The Duchess left the estate of Froxfield Manor as an endowment to the almshouses, called the Duchess of Somerset&#x27;s Hospital. One of the trustees of the Duchess&#x27;s will was her brother-in-law, Sir Samuel Grimston, 3rd Baronet, who refused to convey the prescribed lands and income to the hospital until he was ordered to do so by the Court of Chancery.
The original almshouses are built of brick around a quadrangle, with the chapel in the centre. In 1772–75 one range of seven almshouses was demolished and the hospital was enlarged to a length of 37 bays. This enabled it to accommodate 50 widows and eligibility was extended from its original geographical catchment area to include widows from anywhere in England within of London.

In 1813 or 1814 Charles Brudenell-Bruce, 1st Marquess of Ailesbury paid for the original chapel to be demolished and replaced by a new, presumably larger one built in its place, designed by the architect Thomas Baldwin of Bath. A new gateway to the hospital was added at the same time. The gateway and chapel are of ashlar masonry in a Georgian Gothick style.

The hospital&#x27;s investment income began to decline and from 1851 it made successive reductions to the resident widows&#x27; pensions. From 1882 it started to leave vacant almshouses unoccupied to save money and in 1892 parishes in London and Westminster complained that they were not being given their allocation of places at the hospital. In 1897 the Charity Commission found the hospital was housing only 16 widows, and by 1921 this number had fallen to 13.

In 1920–22 the Hospital sold its lands and increased its income by investing the capital. By 1922 it had increased its residents to 25 and increased their pensions. In 1963 the chapel was restored. In 1966 the Hospital broadened eligibility to any poor woman over 55. Gifts from other charities, public bodies and private donations were invested in maintaining and improving the almshouses. By 1995 it provided 45 houses and four flats for widows and one house reserved for guests.

The dwellings and gatehouse were designated as Grade II* listed in 1966, as was the chapel.

==School==
In the early part of the 19th century, most children from Froxfield who attended school did so in Little Bedwyn, Hungerford or Great Bedwyn. By 1871 a school had opened in Froxfield, but in 1884 it served only as an infants&#x27; school for children under six. It was rebuilt in 1885 to accommodate older children but was closed in 1907. A new school was built near the parish church and opened in 1910, taking children of all ages from five upwards, until 1948 when those over 11 were transferred to Marlborough Secondary Modern School. Falling pupil numbers led to closure of the school in 1963.

==Amenities==
The village has a public house, the Pelican Inn; the 18th-century building to the east of the village was originally a terrace of three cottages. There is a village hall.

== Notable people ==
Lewis Evans (1755–1827), vicar of Froxfield from 1788 until his death, was also a mathematical master at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, and was recognised by the Royal Astronomical Society as an astronomical observer.

Constance Savery (1897–1999), a prolific writer of novels and children&#x27;s books, was born at Froxfield while her father was the vicar.

<text>L&#x27;Amour fou is a 1969 French romantic drama film directed by Jacques Rivette, who co-wrote the script with Marilù Parolini.

==Plot==
&quot;L&#x27;Amour fou&quot; follows the dissolution of the marriage between Claire, an actress (played by Bulle Ogier), and Sebastien, her director (Jean-Pierre Kalfon). It is black and white with two different film gauges (35 mm and 16 mm) employed at different times throughout the film. The film focuses on a long cycle of self-destruction in Claire and Sebastien&#x27;s relationship.

The central event in the film&#x27;s narrative is a three-week period of preparation by a theater group for a production of Racine&#x27;s version of &quot;Andromaque&quot;. A crew films the preparations of the theater company in handheld 16 mm, while the rest of the film is shot in 35 mm. This framework allows Rivette to focus on the act of direction, in the formation of an artwork and the dissolution of a relationship.

==Significance==
The film is pivotal in Rivette&#x27;s career as a precursor to his vast 12+ hour opus &quot;Out 1&quot; which followed two years later.

* Jean-Pierre Kalfon - Sébastien-Pyrrhus

<text>Frederick Goddard Tuckerman (February 4, 1821 – May 9, 1873) was an American poet, remembered mostly for his sonnet series. Apart from the 1860 publication of his book &quot;Poems&quot;, which included approximately two-fifths of his lifetime sonnet output and other poetic works in a variety of forms, the remainder of his poetry was published posthumously in the 20th century. Attempts by several 20th century scholars and critics to spark wider interest in his life and works have met with some success and Tuckerman is now included in several important anthologies of American poetry. Though his works appear in 19th century anthologies of American poetry and sonnets, this reclusive contemporary of Emily Dickinson, sometime correspondent of Nathaniel Hawthorne, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, and acquaintance of Alfred, Lord Tennyson, remains in relative obscurity.

==Early life==
Frederick Goddard Tuckerman was born on February 4, 1821, in Boston, Massachusetts, to Edward Francis Tuckerman (1775–1843) and Sophia May (1784–1870), a prosperous and distinguished Boston family. His siblings included: Hannah Parkman Tuckerman (1805–1859), Edward Tuckerman (1817–1886), the botanist, Samuel Parkman Tuckerman (1819–1890), the composer, and Sophia May Eckley (1823–1874), the spiritualist. His first cousin was Henry Theodore Tuckerman (1813–1871), an American writer, essayist and critic.

He entered Harvard University in 1841, but did not remain long, due to an eye problem, as recalled in a family genealogy, privately printed in 1917 by a relative, Bayard Tuckerman. After Harvard, he entered the law school, graduating in 1842, and was admitted to the Suffolk Bar, reading with Edward D. Sohier (1810–1888). He later abandoned the practice of law, saying that it was distasteful. He then devoted himself to the pursuit of his favorite studies, literature, botany and astronomy.

In 1847, he moved to Greenfield, in western Massachusetts due to his love of nature and began living a life of relative seclusion and retirement, which was considered strange one for a man in his middle twenties.

==Career==
While Tuckerman preferred isolation, he traveled abroad, meeting at least one famous poet, and communicated with several other American writers of note. According to N. Scott Momaday, &quot;In 1851, and again in 1854, Tuckerman journeyed abroad. On the first of these excursions he met Alfred, Lord Tennyson; on the second he was Tennyson&#x27;s guest at Farringford. The friendship between the two men appears to have been fast and of long standing. We do not know what Tennyson thought of Tuckerman&#x27;s poetry. On the second visit with Tennyson, the poet laureate gave him the original manuscript of Locksley Hall. Tuckerman published &quot;Poems&quot; in 1860; it was his only poetry collection published in his lifetime. &quot;The American writers to whom Tuckerman sent complimentary copies of the 1860 &quot;Poems&quot; are an impressive lot. The list of recipients includes the names of Emerson, Hawthorne, Longfellow, Bryant, and Jones Very.&quot; The responses he received were polite and favorable. They generally distinguished &quot;the intrinsic merit of Tuckerman&#x27;s work and &#x27;external success&#x27;&quot;, the likelihood of it meeting popular success &quot;with the world&quot;. &quot;The printing of Tuckerman&#x27;s volume of poems in 1860 was the high point of his public career. When he had made his claim on the attention of the most respected literary men of his day, he returned to his seclusion. He continued to write, indeed, the best of his work was yet to come, but he never again exposed himself to the world.&quot;

===Poetry===
Momaday offers a general estimation of the poet and the poetry:
&quot;Tuckerman was a man who made herbariums. He had an eye for the minutest aspects of the world. When he wished to focus upon the veins of a leaf, or to find a metaphor for the appearance of an evergreen spine, he could do so with extraordinary skill. His poems are remarkable, point-blank descriptions of nature; they are filled with small, precise, and whole things: purring bees and vervain spikes, shives and amaryllis, wind flowers and stramony. But Tuckerman has more to recommend him than an eye and a nomenclature. His sensibilities are refined; his sensitivity is acute. His experience is pervaded by an always apparent sense of grief. He knows well the side of Man that is most vulnerable to pain, and he treats of it throughout his work with respect and compassion, often with great power and beauty.

But he was also a poet of the nineteenth century, and one who admired Tennyson above others. There is a good deal of bad writing in Tuckerman, and there are many obscurities... [the faults] occur for the most part in the longer poems, especially those of narrative character. Often they are marred by a tediousness of expression and an overwrought consistency of mood.&quot;

Edmund Wilson comments on the issue of Tuckerman&#x27;s obscurity:
&quot;One of the queerest features of Tuckerman&#x27;s work is his habit of alluding, not merely to characters from Biblical or classical antiquity so obscure that one cannot believe they are real till one finds them in a concordance or a classical dictionary, but also to personages who cannot be found because their names have been made up by the poet.&quot;

Wilson draws a comparison between Tuckerman and the work of Emily Dickinson and wonders at the missed intersection between the lives and work of these two reclusive, western Massachusetts poets, as well as with the correspondent and literary mentor of Dickinson, Thomas Wentworth Higginson:
&quot;Tuckerman&#x27;s occasional obscurity, like that of Emily Dickinson, contributes to one&#x27;s general impression of a soliloquy not quite overheard. It is interesting that Emily Dickinson should have known Frederick&#x27;s brother Edward, who taught botany at Amherst College, and also Tuckerman&#x27;s son and his son&#x27;s wife. There is a good deal about the Tuckermans in Emily&#x27;s letters; but—though Greenfield is not far from Amherst — there is no mention of Frederick Goddard. Did Emily know that the father of her friend, almost as much a recluse as herself, was writing remarkable poetry? Had Tuckerman ever been told that Emily Dickinson wrote? Colonel Thomas Wentworth Higginson—though he and Tuckerman had been classmates at Harvard—had no notion of Tuckerman&#x27;s talent. Old Higginson was still alive when Tuckerman was rediscovered [see below], and in response to an inquiry by Witter Bynner, he explained that he remembered his contemporary &#x27;as a refined and gentlemanly fellow, but I did not then know him as a poet&#x27;.&quot;

===Romanticism===
Eugene England discusses Tuckerman&#x27;s position as a Romantic poet and his work in relation to that of Ralph Waldo Emerson: &quot;He is not merely a Romantic, nor yet exclusively an anti-Romantic; not just influenced by Emerson or simply reacting against Emerson&#x27;s excesses... With the Romantics, Tuckerman yearned to be at home in the universe, to feel himself deeply related to its central reality, and he understood and participated in various efforts to bring that about—including the Emersonian temptation to assert a pantheism that would make everything divine and thus destroy all ethical distinctions and exalt simple merging, including the final merge of death. But Tuckerman also realized that alienation is part of the price we pay for our humanness, for conscious life and perceived feeling, that the void between the mind and the world remains, unless we destroy the mind in primitivism or death—or do away with the world in some form of subjectivism.

==Revival of interest==
In 1909, Walter Prichard Eaton, drama critic and essayist, wrote an article in &quot;Forum&quot; about Tuckerman and his poetry, after seeing two sonnets in an unpublished manuscript of an anthology of American poems written by Louis How. This article inspired Witter Bynner to enter into correspondence with one of the poet&#x27;s grandchildren, thereby finding the manuscripts for the remaining sonnets. He published the results in 1931.

N. Scott Momaday brought out the most complete edition available of Tuckerman&#x27;s works in 1965, with a quirky (&quot;Winters&#x27;s heretical, obdurate foreword&quot;) Critical Foreword by Yvor Winters and a biographical/critical introduction by Momaday.

Another writer cited by Momaday in his survey of the revival of interest in Tuckerman&#x27;s poetry is Edmund Wilson, in his work &quot;Patriotic Gore&quot;. In that work, Wilson predicted a permanent revival of Tuckerman and his works after the publication of his most famous ode: &quot;A further posthumous poem, &quot;The Cricket&quot;, was printed, in 1950, as a leaflet by the Cummington Press of Cummington, Massachusetts. So Tuckerman has emerged at last from the obscurity which the retirement of his life invited.&quot; Wilson also provides an appreciative short summary of Tuckerman and his works, citing several poems in their entirety.

The only recent critical work of significant length on Tuckerman and his work is &quot;Beyond Romanticism: Tuckerman&#x27;s Life and Poetry&quot; (1991), by Eugene England.

A selection of Tuckerman&#x27;s poetry appears in &quot;Three American Poets&quot; (2003), edited by Jonathan Bean. His sonnets are sprinkled through several American poetry and sonnet anthologies. The Library of America&#x27;s &quot;American Poetry: The Nineteenth Century, Vol. 2&quot; (1993) contains over 20 selections.

The most recent selection is &quot;Selected Poems of Frederick Goddard Tuckerman (The John Harvard Library)&quot; (2010), edited by Ben Mazer.

==Personal life==

In 1847, coinciding with his move to Greenfield, he married Hannah Lucinda Jones (1827–1857), a dark-haired, gentle woman, whose disposition was well suited to his own. Ten years later, Hannah died, after the birth of her third child. It has been said that her death was the deepest hurt of Tuckerman&#x27;s life and the &quot;beginning of his final solitude.&quot;
*Infant Daughter (1848–1848)
*Edward Tuckerman (1850–1871)
*Anna Tuckerman (1853–1954)

Tuckerman died May 9, 1873, in Greenfield.

===Honors===
Poet&#x27;s Seat Tower is a 1912 sandstone observation tower in Greenfield named for the site&#x27;s attraction to poets, particularly Tuckerman.

<doc id="1115633" wikidata="Q717569" url="?curid=1115633" title="Blood, toil, tears and sweat">
<text>The phrase &quot;blood, toil, tears and sweat&quot; became famous in a speech given by Winston Churchill to the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom on 13 May 1940. The speech is sometimes known by that name.

==Background==
This was Churchill&#x27;s first speech since becoming prime minister. It was made on 13 May 1940 to the House of Commons after having been offered the King&#x27;s commission the previous Friday, to become Prime Minister of the United Kingdom in the first year of World War II. Churchill had replaced Neville Chamberlain on 10 May, and in this speech he asked the House to declare its confidence in his Government. The motion passed unanimously. This was the first of three speeches which he gave during the period of the Battle of France, which commenced with the German invasion of the Low Countries on 10 May.

==History==
Churchill had used similar phrases earlier, such as &quot;Their sweat, their tears, their blood&quot; in 1931, and &quot;new structures of national life erected upon blood, sweat, and tears&quot; in 1939.

Churchill&#x27;s sentence, &quot;I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat&quot;, has been called a paraphrase of one uttered on 2 July 1849 by Giuseppe Garibaldi when rallying his revolutionary forces in Rome: &quot;I offer hunger, thirst, forced marches, battle, and death.&quot; As a young man, Churchill had considered writing a biography of Garibaldi. The circumstances under which Garibaldi made that speech—with the revolutionary Roman Republic being overwhelmed and Garibaldi needing to maintain the morale of his troops towards a highly hazardous retreat through the Apennine Mountains—was in some ways comparable to Britain&#x27;s situation with France being overwhelmed by the German offensive.

Theodore Roosevelt had uttered a phrase similar to Churchill&#x27;s in an address to the United States Naval War College on 2 June 1897, following his appointment as federal Assistant Secretary of the Navy: &quot;Every man among us is more fit to meet the duties and responsibilities of citizenship because of the perils over which, in the past, the nation has triumphed; because of the blood and sweat and tears, the labor and the anguish, through which, in the days that have gone, our forefathers moved on to triumph.&quot; Churchill&#x27;s line has been called a &quot;direct quotation&quot; from Roosevelt&#x27;s speech. Churchill, a man with an American mother and a keen soldier, was likely to have read works by Theodore Roosevelt, who was a widely published military historian; it is also possible he read the speech after being appointed First Lord of the Admiralty, a position similar to Roosevelt&#x27;s.

Other versions of the phrase are &quot;It [poetry] is forged slowly and painfully, link by link, with blood and sweat and tears&quot; (Lord Alfred Douglas, 1919), &quot;Blood, sweat, and tear-wrung millions&quot; (Lord Byron, 1823), and &quot;... mollifie/ It with thy teares, or sweat, or blood&quot; (John Donne, 1611). In Latin, Cicero and Livy had used the phrase &quot;sweat and blood&quot;.

== Excerpts ==


== Reaction ==
Churchill had not been the preferred choice of most Conservatives to succeed Chamberlain, but the motion on 13 May &quot;That this House welcomes the formation of a Government representing the united and inflexible resolve of the nation to prosecute the war with Germany to a victorious conclusion&quot; passed unanimously. He had been unpopular in many circles since the 1930s and MPs had ignored or heckled speeches in which he denounced the prime minister&#x27;s appeasement policy toward Germany; even others who opposed Chamberlain avoided him. One historian has described the speech&#x27;s effect on Parliament, however, as &quot;electrifying ... He was still speaking at the House of Commons, but it was now listening, and cheering.&quot; 

Churchill himself, however, subsequently held that many Conservative MPs had still regarded him with reserve and it was not until his speech of 4 July 1940 announcing British action against the French fleet at Mers-el-Kébir that he could feel he had the full support of the whole House. Other great speeches followed, including the &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot; speech of 4 June and the &quot;This was their finest hour&quot; speech of 18 June.

== Legacy ==
On 26 April 2013, the Bank of England announced that beneath a portrait of Churchill the phrase &quot;I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears and sweat&quot; was to adorn the new 5-pound note. It was issued in September 2016.

<text>Trinity Church in the City of Boston, located in the Back Bay neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts, is a parish of the Episcopal Diocese of Massachusetts. The congregation, currently standing at approximately 4,000 households, was founded in 1733. Three services are offered each Sunday, and weekday services are offered once a week from September through June. Within the spectrum of worship styles in the Anglican tradition, Trinity Church has historically been considered a Broad Church parish.

In addition to worship, the parish is actively involved in service to the community, pastoral care, programs for children and teenagers, and Christian education for all ages. The church is home to several high-level choirs, including the Trinity Choir, Trinity Schola, Trinity Choristers, and Trinity Chamber Choir. The building, designed by Henry Hobson Richardson, is currently under study for becoming a Boston Landmark.

==History==

After its former site on Summer Street burned in the Great Boston Fire of 1872, the current church complex was erected under the direction of Rector Phillips Brooks (1835–1893), one of the best-known and most charismatic preachers of his time.

The church and parish house were designed by Henry Hobson Richardson and construction took place from 1872 to 1877, when the complex was consecrated. Situated on Copley Square in Back Bay, Trinity Church is the building that established Richardson&#x27;s reputation. It is the birthplace and archetype of the Richardsonian Romanesque style, characterized by a clay roof, polychromy, rough stone, heavy arches, and a massive tower. This style was soon adopted for a number of public buildings across the United States. The stone used was Dedham Granite.

Stanford White, then working in H.H. Richardson&#x27;s office, designed the current main tower of the Trinity Church of Boston in 1872, basing it on the romanesque tower of the Old Cathedral of Salamanca (Spain).

According to L.C. Norton, the inventor of door checks, the heavy main entrance doors of Trinity Church were the first to be fitted with a quiet and effective means to resist slamming. This led to a patented pneumatic door check that was seen throughout the 1880s to 1910s. Norton&#x27;s door check device eventually developed into the modern door closer with his guidance in both the Norton Door Controls and LCN companies.

==Music==
===Choirs===

Each December, the choirs of Trinity offer three iterations of a service of Candlelight Carols. These are a &quot;Boston tradition&quot;, and very popular events, drawing nearly 5,000 attendees from as far away as Maine. A traditional scene in Copley Square in December is that of a long line of people waiting to enter the church for the free event. The service is based on the Nine Lessons and Carols model developed at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge from a service at Truro Cathedral in Cornwall.

In addition to their primary function of supporting worship, the choirs of Trinity Church are fixtures in the rich musical landscape of Boston. The Trinity Choir has toured extensively, and can be heard on several critically acclaimed recordings. The Trinity Choristers are a group of children who learn music and sing in the tradition of the Royal School of Church Music. The current Director of Music and Organist is Colin Lynch. The Trinity Choir and Trinity Choristers tour England every three years, serving as choirs-in-residence at major houses of worship such as Ely Cathedral, Chichester Cathedral, and Westminster Abbey (summer 2016).

===Organs===

* 1876: The original organ at Trinity was built by Hilborne L. Roosevelt in 1876, his Opus 29. It had mechanical action, assisted by Barker levers on all divisions and an electrically controlled Echo division, but its location in the chancel proved unsatisfactory, and the organ was moved to the gallery.
* 1903: Hutchings-Votey built a new instrument for the chancel and made both organs playable from a single console.
* 1924: Ernest M. Skinner undertook a rebuilding project, Opus 479, involving changes to both the Roosevelt and Hutchings-Votey instruments, but by 1926 it had expanded to Opus 573 as a virtually new organ in the gallery, as well as a new chancel console.
* 1956: Aeolian-Skinner provided a new console in 1956 and, in 1960, installed a new chancel organ.
* 1962: The gallery organ was extensively rebuilt, and major tonal modifications were made by Jason McKown, who maintained the organs for many years.
* 1987: Jack Steinkampf&#x27; installed a rank of horizontal trumpet pipes under the west gallery window. This festival trumpet is given in memory of Paul Albert Merrill.
* Late 1990s: In conjunction with the parish&#x27;s building campaign, a plan was set out with Foley-Baker, Inc., for the cleaning and refurbishment of both organs and their joint console.
* Late 2010s: Since 2012, the Church has slowly acquired a stockpile of Skinner and Aeolian-Skinner pipes from the general period of Trinity&#x27;s organ. The pipes were installed and the organ reworked in an attempt to recapture the original Skinner sound. This work was a collaboration of Trinity&#x27;s former and current organ curators: Foley-Baker Inc., of Tolland, Connecticut (who renovated the nave organ in 1999–2001, and the chancel organ in 2007), and Jonathan Ambrosino, who also maintains the organs at Old South Church and Church of the Advent. In 2018 a new four-manual organ console was built by Richard Houghten of Milan, Michigan, and J. Zamberlan &amp; Co., in Wintersville, Ohio.

The nave and chancel organs feature 121 stops, 113 ranks, and 6898 pipes.

==Worship==
Trinity Church offers three services on Sundays, including a now rarely heard modified version of Rite I Morning Prayer including a sermon and extra anthem, as well as a service of sung Compline in the late evening. Weekday services include Wednesday Evensong and Thursday Holy Eucharist with Prayers for Healing.

Trinity has played host to many special services over the years, due mainly to its central location in Boston, large seating capacity, and reputation as a parish willing to open its doors and be &quot;Boston&#x27;s church.&quot; These services have included interfaith (Christian, Jewish, Muslim) services immediately following the 9/11 attacks, a similar service following the July 2005 London bombings, and many prominent funerals, consecrations of bishops, and the like.

==Community service==
The parish supports many forms of community outreach and social justice ministry. These include partnerships with Rosie&#x27;s Place, the Greater Boston Interfaith Organization, Pine Street Inn, Habitat for Humanity, Community Servings, the Walk for Hunger, the Rodman Ride for Kids, and others. The Trinity Boston Foundation is a nonprofit organization with a mission to support the social and emotional well-being and development of young people. Formed in 2007, it grew out of several of Trinity Church&#x27;s outreach ministries, and now functions as a separately incorporated subsidiary organization that directly serves approximately 500 young people in the Boston community. The Trinity Boston Foundation&#x27;s programs honor and respect people of all faith traditions, including those with no faith tradition.

==Rectors==
In the Episcopal Church in the United States of America, the Rector is the priest elected to head a self-supporting parish. Because of the importance of Trinity Church in the life of the city of Boston, the Rectors had great influence in the political and social sphere, especially in the early years of the church through the mid-1900s.

Phillips Brooks, who was Rector from 1869 to 1891 has been memorialized in the official calendar of the Episcopal Church. His feast day in the calendar according to the 1979 Book of Common Prayer is January 23. His statue is located on the left exterior of the church.

The following are the Rectors of Trinity Church from its founding to the present day:
==Art and architecture==

The building&#x27;s plan is a modified Greek Cross with four arms extending outwards from the central tower, which stands 64 m (211 ft) tall. The church is situated in Copley Square, and since the 1970s, in the shadow of the John Hancock Tower. Having been built in Boston&#x27;s Back Bay, which was originally a mud flat, Trinity rests on some 4,500 wooden piles, each driven through 30 feet of gravel fill, silt, and clay, and constantly wetted by the water table of the Back Bay as they will rot if exposed to air.

The central portal may have been modeled on that of Saint Trophîme at Arles,

Its interior murals, which cover over were completed entirely by American artists. Richardson and Brooks decided that a richly colored interior was essential and turned to John La Farge (1835–1910) for help. La Farge had never performed a commission on this scale, but realized its importance and asked only for his costs to be covered. The results established La Farge&#x27;s reputation.

The church&#x27;s windows were originally clear glass at consecration in 1877, with one exception, but soon major windows were added. Four windows were designed by Edward Burne-Jones and executed by the studio of William Morris. Another four windows were exceptional commissions by John La Farge, and revolutionized window glass with their layering of opalescent glass. The Suter window (donated by Hales W. Suter) was painted by Charles Mills.

Trinity Church is the only church in the United States and the only building in Boston that has been honored as one of the &quot;Ten Most Significant Buildings in the United States&quot; by the American Institute of Architects. In 1885, architects voted Trinity Church as the most important building in the U.S.; Trinity Church is the only building from the original 1885 list still included in the AIA&#x27;s current top ten list. The building was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 30, 1970.

The church also houses sculptures by Daniel Chester French and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.

==In popular culture==

In 1985 Trinity Church was featured in the opening scene of the second television episode portraying novelist Robert B. Parker&#x27;s character— Boston&#x27;s preeminent detective, Spenser— in &quot;Spenser For Hire&quot;: &quot;No Room at the Inn&quot;.

Interior scenes from the 1999 thriller &quot;The Boondock Saints&quot; were filmed within Trinity Church.

The church was featured in the 2015 video game &quot;Fallout 4&quot;.

The Trinity Church was prominently shown in Reba McEntire&#x27;s 1986 music video for &quot;Whoever&#x27;s in New England&quot;.

<doc id="1115640" wikidata="Q2554583" url="?curid=1115640" title="Joe Cannon (soccer)">
<text>Joseph Cannon (born January 1, 1975) is an American former professional soccer player. He spent the majority of his 16 professional seasons playing in Major League Soccer. His 86 MLS career shutouts rank him fourth in league history. He won the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award twice (2002, 2004), and finished runner-up for the award three times (2000, 2001, 2005).

He also earned two caps in friendlies with the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team.

==Early life and education==
Cannon was born January 1, 1975, in Sun Valley, Idaho, to Barbara and Joe Cannon. As a child, he was raised in both Sun Valley, Idaho and Los Altos Hills, California. He attended Hemingway Elementary School in Ketchum, Idaho, before moving permanently to California at age 12. In California, he played high school soccer for Saint Francis High School.

Cannon attended college at the University of California, Santa Barbara for his first year and was a student-athlete on the UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men&#x27;s soccer team. He played 11 games for the Gauchos in 1993 and recorded 3 shutouts. He later transferred to Santa Clara University where he played for the Broncos from 1995 to 1997. He graduated with a degree in political science.

==Playing career==
===San Diego Flash and San Jose Earthquakes===
Cannon was not drafted by a Major League Soccer team and instead signed with the San Diego Flash of the A-League in 1998. He appeared in 28 games, posting 11 shutouts, en route to being named the Flash&#x27;s Most Valuable Player.

After a season with the Flash, he was signed by Major League Soccer team San Jose Earthquakes. After starting goalkeeper David Kramer tore the labrum in his shoulder, Cannon was promoted to the first team for the Quakes. He remained as the starter until 2002, leading San Jose to victory in MLS Cup 2001 and winning his first MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award in 2002.

===French foray and return to MLS===
Cannon&#x27;s Major League Soccer contract expired following the 2002 season and he attempted to play for a European team. After an unsuccessful trial with Feyenoord, he signed a six-month contract with RC Lens of France&#x27;s Ligue 1. He was behind Charles Itandje in the Lens side and was not able to break into the first team.

Meanwhile, in MLS, the Earthquakes traded the rights to Cannon to the Colorado Rapids for three draft picks—a first-round 2004 pick, and third and fourth-round 2005 picks—and Cannon returned to play in America.

Cannon was initially behind incumbent goalkeeper Scott Garlick, but Rapids coach Tim Hankinson controversially promoted Cannon into the starting role for the 2003 playoffs. Although Colorado did not advance, Garlick was traded to the Dallas Burn and Cannon kept his starting position. The following season in 2004, Cannon won his second MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award in addition to being named to the MLS Best XI and as a finalist for the MLS Most Valuable Player Award.

In December 2006, Cannon was traded to the Los Angeles Galaxy for Herculez Gomez and Ugo Ihemelu. He made his Galaxy debut on April 8, 2007, in a 0–0 tie with the Houston Dynamo. He spent one season with the club.

===Later career===
Cannon returned to the Earthquakes via trade with the Galaxy for allocation money in January 2008. He spent three seasons with the club.

Cannon was selected by Vancouver Whitecaps FC in the 2010 MLS Expansion Draft. He re-signed with Vancouver for the 2012 Major League Soccer season. Cannon retired following the 2013 Major League Soccer season.

===International career===
Cannon earned two caps with the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team. His first cap came against New Zealand in 2003 where he played the first half of a 2–1 win. In 2004 he was called into several U.S. camps without gaining any game time. In 2005 he won his second cap, playing the first half of a friendly against Honduras.

Cannon&#x27;s grandfather and father are Canadian, which made him eligible for the Canada men&#x27;s national soccer team.

==Post-playing career==
In March 2014, Cannon was announced as a color commentator for San Jose Earthquakes radio broadcasts on KLIV.

==Personal life==
Cannon has a twin brother, Jon, who was a minor-league baseball pitcher. He has two other brothers, Cody and Colt. His father, Joe Cannon Sr., was a country-western singer.

<doc id="1115648" wikidata="Q1217501" url="?curid=1115648" title="The World Is Not Enough (Nintendo 64 video game)">
<text>007: The World Is Not Enough is a first-person shooter video game developed by Eurocom and based on the 1999 &quot;James Bond&quot; film of the same name. It was published by Electronic Arts (EA) and released for the Nintendo 64 on October 17, 2000, shortly before the release of its PlayStation counterpart. The game features a single-player campaign in which players assume the role of secret agent James Bond as he fights to stop a terrorist from triggering a nuclear meltdown in the waters of Istanbul. It includes a split-screen multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete in different types of deathmatch and objective-based games.

The game runs on an engine that was adapted to take advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths. Although Eurocom used original production material to recreate the environments of the film, the company added elements to help the game design, including a mission that takes place in the London Underground. The game supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which provides enhanced graphics and visual effects. A Controller Pak is required to save the player&#x27;s progress through the game.

&quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics and was frequently compared to Rare&#x27;s Nintendo 64 first-person shooters &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. It was considered superior to its PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Critics generally praised the game&#x27;s graphics and smooth frame rate but criticized its weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence. In the United States, the game sold more than one million copies.

==Gameplay==

&quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; is a first-person shooter based on MGM&#x27;s 1999 &quot;James Bond&quot; film of the same name, where the player assumes the role of James Bond through 14 missions with three difficulty settings. The player can run, jump, crouch, swim, and dive underwater for a short period. One mission is played as a rail shooter in which the player skis down a mountain. In each mission, the player must complete many objectives while encountering enemies controlled by the game&#x27;s artificial intelligence. Objectives range from rescuing hostages to destroying vehicles and collecting items. Some objectives require the player to use numerous high-tech gadgets. For example, the Keypad Decrypter can be used to decode lock systems, while the ID scanner is useful to copy fingerprints.

Mission objectives vary in quantity and length depending on the difficulty setting chosen. Difficulty settings affect enemy accuracy and damage, and the availability of the game&#x27;s optional automatic aiming assistance. The player can use several weapons, including pistols, submachine guns, assault rifles, a shotgun, a sniper rifle, and a rocket launcher. Weapons must be reloaded after a certain number of shots and have alternate fire modes. For example, the Wolfram P2K can be used with or without a silencer. In addition, the player always carries a wristwatch which may be used to stun enemies, fire tranquilizer darts, throw a grappling hook, or emit a laser beam to open locks. In some missions, the player can use night vision or X-ray vision glasses to outsmart enemies. The player has a certain amount of health which decreases when attacked by enemies. There are no health-recovery items, although body armors can be acquired to provide a secondary health bar. A Nintendo 64 Controller Pak is required to save the player&#x27;s progress through the game.

In addition to the single-player missions, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; features a multiplayer mode where up to four players can compete against each other in different game types, ranging from the traditional deathmatch to objective-based games such as capture the flag or king of the hill. Other game types include Last Agent Standing, where players begin the game with a finite number of lives and must survive until the opposing players exhaust their lives, and Uplink, in which players must find and touch uplink units scattered in key locations of the map to score points. Multiplayer games can be played on 14 different maps and can include bots. Bots&#x27; appearances and amount of health can be changed to match player preference.

==Plot==
The game&#x27;s plot closely follows that of the film. MI6 agent James Bond is sent to Spain to meet a banker and retrieve money for Robert King, a friend of M who purchased a classified report from the Russian Atomic Energy Department. The report, which was taken from a dead MI6 agent, is believed to contain information about terrorists who have attacked King&#x27;s oil pipeline in Kazakhstan. Bond asks the banker who killed the MI6 agent, but the banker is killed by an assassin. Bond escapes with the money and takes it to the MI6 headquarters in London. A terrorist group launches an attack on the MI6 headquarters, prompting Bond to pursue the assassin through a London Underground station. Bond offers her protection, but she ultimately kills herself by exploding a hot air balloon. MI6 traces the recovered money to a KGB agent-turned-terrorist known as Renard, who previously kidnapped King&#x27;s daughter, Elektra. M assigns Bond to protect Elektra, who is about to oversee the construction of an oil pipeline in Azerbaijan.

During a tour of the pipeline&#x27;s proposed route in the mountains, Bond and Elektra are attacked by a hit squad in armed, paraglider-equipped snowmobiles. Bond suspects the attack was caused by Elektra&#x27;s head of security, Davidov, and decides to kill him before taking his place on a flight to a Russian ICBM base in Kazakhstan. There, Bond meets nuclear physicist Christmas Jones and learns that Renard managed to steal plutonium from a nuclear warhead. To get a lead on where Renard might be hiding, Bond visits a former Russian mafia adversary, Valentin Zukovsky, who reveals that Elektra was in exchange for the use of a submarine being captained by his nephew. Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the submarine&#x27;s nuclear reactor, the resulting nuclear explosion would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians&#x27; oil pipeline in the Bosporus. In Istanbul, Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra&#x27;s henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine, while Bond is taken to the Maiden&#x27;s Tower. With the help of Zukovsky, Bond kills Elektra and boards the submarine. Ultimately, Bond finds Renard in the submarine&#x27;s reactor and kills him before escaping with Jones.

==Development==

&quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; was developed by Eurocom and published by Electronic Arts, which had formed a partnership with MGM in late 1998 to produce games based on MGM&#x27;s intellectual properties. At the time, Eurocom had started development on a &quot;very scalable&quot; first-person 3D engine intended for sixth generation platforms like the GameCube. After Electronic Arts acquired the &quot;James Bond&quot; game licence, Eurocom showed them their engine and soon both companies started working together to produce the next Bond-licensed game. This happened when Eurocom was still working on the Nintendo 64 version of &quot;Mortal Kombat 4&quot;.

The engine was created and adapted to take advantage of the Nintendo 64 strengths. It is capable of delivering a fast and smooth frame rate while offering particle explosions, dynamic lighting effects, long draw distances, and other environmental effects like fog or smoke. It also supports the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, which provides enhanced graphics and visual effects. Focusing on the game&#x27;s frame rate and technical aspects was a major priority because developers wanted &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; to be the fastest first-person game on the Nintendo 64 system. According to Eurocom, &quot;[we] don&#x27;t think we could push it much more than we have&quot;. In addition, with &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; being Eurocom&#x27;s last Nintendo 64 game, the company saw it as &quot;a nice swan song to go out on.&quot;

To help Eurocom authentically recreate the environments of the film, the filmmakers provided Eurocom with original production material, including concept drawings, blueprints, and photographs of the film&#x27;s sets. Although the game closely follows the plot of the film, the developers added elements to help the game design. For example, the London Underground level, where the player must rescue several hostages, is not part of the film. However, the boat chase scene is not playable in the game due to limitations in the Nintendo 64 cartridge size. According to the game&#x27;s producer Bill Beacham, vehicle-based gameplay would require the creation of a separate engine that would possibly compromise the game&#x27;s base first-person engine. The characters&#x27; faces were digitised from the film&#x27;s actors, but impersonators provided voiced dialogue. One exception was English actor John Cleese, who reprised his role as R.

Electronic Arts secured a &quot;Teen&quot; rating from the ESRB to avoid intense portrayals of violence because they felt that fast action and memorable spy moments were what the Bond legacy had always stood for. In May 2000, the game was presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles. At the time, development of the game was nearly 75% complete. The game was released on a 32MB cartridge and includes over 500 lines of speech, which was compressed using Factor 5&#x27;s technology. The game was initially intended to be released on November 20, 2000, in North America, but was ultimately released one month earlier on October 17, 2000, because Eurocom managed to finish work on the game quicker than expected. In Europe, the game was released on December 8, 2000. A different game, also titled &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot;, was released for the PlayStation in November 2000.

==Reception==
&quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics, who frequently compared it to Rare&#x27;s critically acclaimed Nintendo 64 games &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; and &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. It was also considered superior to its PlayStation counterpart because of its level design and inclusion of a multiplayer mode. Matt Casamassina of IGN felt that Eurocom did &quot;an amazing job recreating the cinema experience for the Nintendo 64 owner, perhaps more so than any other movie-to-game license to date.&quot; In a less positive review, Shane Satterfield of &quot;GameSpot&quot; stated that &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; &quot;belongs in the upper echelon of Nintendo 64 software&quot;, but it lacks the gameplay delicacy of &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; to reach classic status. &quot;Edge&quot; concluded that, while the game lacks innovative elements, it &quot;still offers plenty of enjoyment for those who have exhausted Rare&#x27;s masterpieces.&quot; &quot;Next Generation&quot; agreed, stating that &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; is far from a bad game.

Its graphics were widely praised for long draw distances and smooth frame rates. Critics also noted the game&#x27;s believable environments, texture quality, animations, and highly detailed explosions and particle effects. The soundtrack and sound effects received similar praise. &quot;GameRevolution&quot; said that the background themes &quot;make for excellent espionage&quot;, while &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; observed that the spoken dialogue &quot;adds a cinematic touch&quot; that &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; does not feature. &quot;GamePro&quot; stated similar pros, but criticised the plot for being confusing and &quot;too complex for its own good.&quot;

&quot;IGN&quot; praised the single-player missions for their variety and great enemy placement, noting that each scenario is different in both design and gameplay mechanics. The reviewer especially highlighted the last mission due to its underwater sections, as it requires players to find hidden air pockets so that Bond can breathe and stay alive. In contrast, Mark Green of &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; remarked that the missions were fairly scripted, limiting the player&#x27;s options and experimentation. Similarly, &quot;Edge&quot; said that the game&#x27;s &quot;on the fly&quot; mission objectives give the game a fair amount of rigidity. The reviewer explained that, while &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; or &quot;Perfect Dark&quot; set their mission objectives at the beginning of each level, thus giving players a chance to tackle the mission as they wish, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; &quot;cannonballs&quot; the player &quot;from one objective to the next with little room for invention of improvisation.&quot; Nevertheless, he highlighted the Night Watch level for being &quot;fantastically stealth-centric&quot;.

The game&#x27;s weak and inconsistent enemy artificial intelligence was a common subject of criticism. &quot;GameSpot&quot; described the behaviour of enemies as &quot;They see, they run, they shoot - and that&#x27;s about it&quot;, while &quot;N64 Magazine&quot; noted that they regularly fail to spot the player even when standing next to them. The gadgetry was seen as a useful gameplay feature, with AllGame noting that players need to figure out the proper way to use each gadget. Although GameZone highlighted the multiplayer mode for its replay value and teamplay options, critics agreed that the game felt short in comparison to &quot;Perfect Dark&quot;. The artificial intelligence of multiplayer bots was also a frequent criticism. According to &quot;GameSpot&quot;, &quot;they generally amount to nothing more than fragging&quot;. The website would later nominate &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; for its annual Most Disappointing Game award, calling it &quot;far from the &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;/&quot;Perfect Dark&quot; killer that it was made out to be.&quot;

As of December 2007, &quot;The World Is Not Enough&quot; has sold more than one million copies in the United States.

<text>The Laser 128 is an Apple II clone, released by VTech in 1986 and comparable to the Apple IIe and Apple IIc.

==Description==
VTech Laser 128 has 128 KB of RAM. Like the Apple IIc, it is a one-piece semi-portable design with a carrying handle and built-in 5¼-inch floppy disk drive, that uses the 65C02 microprocessor, and supports Apple II graphics. Unlike the Apple IIc, it has a numeric keypad, Centronics printer port, and 128 KB of dedicated video RAM. The 15-pin D-sub digital video port is compatible with Apple&#x27;s IIc flat panel display, but unlike the IIc, Laser 128&#x27;s port is also RGBI interface compatible with an adapter cable. The first 128 model has a proprietary 560x384 video mode removed in later units.

Laser 128 has a single expansion slot for Apple II peripheral cards, which gives it better expansion capabilities than a IIc, but cards remain exposed; the slot is intended for an $80 expansion chassis with two slots compatible with the Apple IIe&#x27;s Slot 5 and Slot 7. The computer also has an internal memory-expansion slot, requiring a card that allows up to 1 MB of additional RAM that can be used as a RAM disk. Laser 128EX and 128EX/2, also expandable by 1 MB, come with the memory expansion card.

==Models==
==History==
Announced in early 1986, VTech sold the Laser 128 in the US at a suggested retail price of $479, while Central Point Software sold it by mail for $395; by comparison, the Apple IIe sold for $945 in April 1986. Apple—already suing VTech regarding the also Apple-compatible Laser 3000—filed a lawsuit to stop distribution of the 128, but VTech obtained United States Customs approval to export the Laser 128 to the United States in 1986, and the lawsuit reportedly had no effect on demand for the computer. Central Point—the most prominent dealer—sold the Laser 128 and accessories with full-page magazine advertisements, saying that &quot;a computer without expansion slots is a dead-end that stays behind as technology advances&quot;. It advertised the Laser 128 in Commodore computer magazines; the name was, Central Point president Mike Brown said, &quot;chosen to sound like the Commodore 128&quot;, and the company intended to appeal to those who wanted to use the large Apple software library with a computer that cost the same as the comparable Commodore. By late 1986, other mail-order firms also sold the Laser 128, and at least one peripheral maker advertised its product&#x27;s compatibility with the clone.

By 1988, VTech had purchased a majority share in Central Point Software and formed Laser Computer, Inc., as a division of the company. It ended Central Point&#x27;s mail order sales of the 128, only selling through dealers such as Sears. &quot;inCider&quot; magazine wrote that year that &quot;Laser will never sell as many computers or have as big a distribution network as Apple, but there&#x27;s no doubt that the 128 [has] won a place in the Apple market, and irritated Apple in the process&quot;. VTech subsequently released the Laser 128EX (1987), with a 3.6 MHz CPU, and the $549 Laser 128EX/2 (mid-1988), with a 3.5-inch disk drive and MIDI port. (A $499 version of the 128EX/2 with a 5.25-inch drive was available.) Apple soon released the Apple IIc Plus.

==Compatibility==
While the Apple II clones from Franklin were discontinued after the company lost Apple Computer, Inc. v. Franklin Computer Corp. (1983), VTech reverse-engineered the Apple Monitor ROM using a clean room design rather than copying it, and licensed an Applesoft BASIC-compatible version of Microsoft BASIC. Apple carefully studied the Laser 128 but was unable to force the clone off the market.

Despite its physical resemblance to the IIc, software sees the Laser 128 as an enhanced IIe with 128 KB RAM and Extended 80-Column Text Card. Apple said in 1984 that the IIc was compatible with 90% of all Apple II software. Central Point said in 1986 that testing had found that only &quot;Choplifter&quot;, &quot;David&#x27;s Midnight Magic&quot;, and &quot;Serpentine&quot; did not run on the clone, because of Broderbund&#x27;s copy protection. &quot;We think it safe to surmise that the latest and best software is 90 percent likely to run on the Laser 128&quot;, &quot;InfoWorld&quot; wrote in 1986. Compatible software included AppleWorks, Quicken, Apple Writer, VisiCalc, &quot;Flight Simulator II&quot;, The Print Shop, and &quot;Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?&quot;, sometimes with slightly different colors. 12% of 129 tested software packages were incompatible, mostly educational software or games. While incompatible with some hardware, the magazine wrote that the expansion slot and parallel port let the Laser 128 use other products which were incompatible with the IIc. &quot;inCider&quot; called the computer &quot;amazingly Apple-compatible&quot;, estimating 95% compatibility. Programs that successfully ran on the Laser 128 included &quot;F-15 Strike Eagle&quot;, Fantavision, WordPerfect, and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, and the magazine wrote that it was easy to install $25 upgraded ROM chips if necessary to improve compatibility. &quot;A+&quot; similarly found that the computer was compatible with 28 of 30 popular Apple II programs, while only about half worked with the Franklin Ace. &quot;BYTE&quot; wrote that expansion cards worked properly but the magazine found &quot;mixed results&quot; with software compatibility, stating that &quot;graphics programs I tested revealed flaws in the Laser 128&#x27;s compatibility with both the Apple IIc and II+&quot;. The Laser 128&#x27;s popularity ensured that most major software companies tested their software on the Laser as well as on Apple hardware.

Licensing BASIC greatly reduced the amount of code that had to be reimplemented. Applesoft BASIC constitutes the largest and most complex part of an Apple II&#x27;s ROM contents. Microsoft made most of its money by retaining the rights to the software that it sold to others. Like IBM with PC DOS, Apple did not have an exclusive license for the Applesoft dialect of BASIC, and VTech was free to license it. Much Apple software depends on various machine code routines that are a part of BASIC in ROM.

==Reception==
&quot;InfoWorld&quot; in May 1986 stated that &quot;we can see why&quot; Apple opposed the Laser 128&#x27;s importation to the United States. It stated that other than the keyboard feel, the computer&#x27;s external features (the expansion slot, numeric keypad, and Centronics port) improved on the IIc. Given the high degree of compatibility and a price less than half that of the IIc, the magazine concluded that the Laser 128 &quot;is a real bargain.&quot; Writing that &quot;it&#x27;s cheap and it works&quot;, &quot;inCider&quot; in December 1986 stated that the Laser 128 &quot;[deserved] a look from anyone considering a Commodore. Or, to be blunt, anyone considering an Apple IIc.&quot; The magazine also disliked the keyboard&#x27;s feel and called the computer &quot;homely&quot;, but concluded that &quot;The Laser is a remarkably compatible, competent performer. The Apple market isn&#x27;t known for hardware bargains, but it has one now.&quot;

&quot;BYTE&quot; in January 1987 preferred the Laser 128&#x27;s keyboard, including the keypad and cursor keys&#x27; locations, to that of the Apple IIc and approved of the documentation&#x27;s quality. Despite describing the software incompatibility issues as &quot;disappointing&quot; the magazine concluded that its &quot;technical issues are relatively minor&quot;, and that its low price made the computer &quot;perfect for someone looking for a second computer or an inexpensive first computer that runs the largest pool of software available today.&quot;

&quot;inCider&quot; in November 1988 stated that the Laser 128EX/2 &quot;has everything you can possibly put into an 8-bit Apple II ... in terms of standard equipment, it&#x27;s more than a match for the IIc Plus.&quot; The Apple product was faster ( vs ), and the difference in price between the two computers was much smaller than the IIc&#x27;s + premium over the Laser 128, but the 128EX/2&#x27;s memory was more easily expandable, important to AppleWorks users. The magazine concluded that while the &quot;128EX/2 is a slick machine, the most fully loaded II compatible you can buy&quot;, the 5 1/4-inch version of the EX/2—or the older EX for those who did not need a 3 1/2-inch drive—&quot;may be bargain hunters&#x27; best bet.&quot;

<text>The Scottish Professional Football League Challenge Cup, commonly known as the Scottish League Challenge Cup or Scottish Challenge Cup (), and currently known as the SPFL Trust Trophy for sponsorship reasons, is an association football knock-out cup competition run by the Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL). It is recognised as the third most prestigious knockout trophy in Scottish football, after the Scottish Cup and the Scottish League Cup.

The competition was first held during the 1990–91 season as the [[B&amp;Q]] Centenary Cup to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Scottish Football League (SFL). It was intended to be a one-off competition but was continued due to its popularity. It was originally contested by SFL (SPFL since 2013) teams below the top level of the Scottish football league system; select teams from lower levels of the league system were added in 2011–12, and guest teams from outside Scotland in 2016–17. For the 2019–20 edition there were 58 teams: 30 from the SPFL; the twelve Under-21 teams of the Scottish Premiership clubs; four each from the Highland League and Lowland League; and two guest teams from each of the NIFL Premiership, Cymru Premier, English National League, and League of Ireland Premier Division up until the 2019–20 season.

The first winner of the tournament was Dundee, who defeated Ayr United. Falkirk are the most successful team in the tournament with four wins, most recently in 2012. The current holders are Airdrieonians, who defeated The New Saints in the 2024 Final.

== Format ==
The Challenge Cup is a knock-out tournament. Within a regionalised format, clubs are paired at random and the first club drawn listed as the home team. The winner of each match progresses to the next round and the loser is eliminated from the tournament. Every match, including the final, is a one-legged tie that lasts 90 minutes plus any additional stoppage time. If no clear winner has been determined after 90 minutes of normal time, 30 minutes of extra time is played. If the score is still level after extra time then the winner is decided by a penalty shoot-out.

Beginning with the 2016–17 season, the competition has been expanded to 58 entrants. All Scottish Professional Football League (SPFL) clubs will participate, with the thirty clubs from the Championship, League One and League Two now joined by Under-20 teams from the twelve Premiership clubs. Also participating by invitation will be four teams each from the Highland and Lowland Leagues and eight entrants from outside Scottish football – two each from the NIFL Premiership in Northern Ireland, the National League in England, League of Ireland and the Welsh Premier League in Wales, until 2021 when the decision was made to only have the Scottish clubs participating due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Teams are seeded to enter the competition over any of the first four rounds, after which eight teams will remain to contest the quarter-finals. The final is played at a neutral venue.

In May 2024, it was announced the Cup would return to being Scottish-only for the 2024-25 season, with more Highland and Lowland League teams taking the place of the invited Northern Irish and Welsh clubs.

== History ==
The competition was created in the 1990–91 season to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the formation of the Scottish Football League in 1890. It was intended to run for only one season but continued due to its popularity. This was reflected in high attendances at matches in the later rounds of the tournament including a full capacity crowd of 11,500 at Fir Park in the first final. The cup was sponsored by DIY retail company B&amp;Q and named the &quot;B&amp;Q Centenary Cup&quot; for the first year and continued as the &quot;B&amp;Q Cup&quot; for four seasons afterwards. The competition was run for three seasons without a sponsor due to the league covering the tournament costs and prize money, but was unsustainable and resulted in it being cancelled for one season in 1998–99 before being re-established in 1999 with a new sponsor. Although it is not as popular as competitions like the Scottish Cup, it provides smaller clubs with a realistic opportunity of winning a trophy due to the absence of top-tier clubs from the tournament. When Stenhousemuir won the final in 1995 it was regarded as the club&#x27;s greatest achievement in its 111-year history. Attendances at matches in the earlier rounds of the tournament are not dissimilar to average home attendances in league competition but as the competition reaches the latter stages they generally increase; Annan Athletic&#x27;s record attendance of 1,575 was set in a semi-final match against Falkirk in 2011.

The number of competitors has varied in relation to the number of clubs with Scottish Football League membership. The first tournament featured the 28 clubs in the First and Second Divisions which reduced to 26 until 1994 when the league was expanded and restructured into three divisions; increasing the number of eligible clubs to 30. In the 2010–11 competition the two highest ranked clubs from the Highland Football League with a Scottish Football Association licence were invited to compete, in order to bring the number of competitors to 32. Before the change in 2010, several clubs received a random bye in the first round in order to even out the number of fixtures. The Challenge Cup continued under the auspices of the Scottish Professional Football League after the Scottish Football League merged with the Scottish Premier League in 2013. One change at this time was that the two invitational places were split, with only one place filled by a Highland League club (with a valid SFA club licence) and the other place going to the winner of a preliminary round tie between clubs from the East of Scotland League and the South of Scotland League. This was simplified in the 2014–15 season, with the two additional places going to the Highland League champion (Brora Rangers) and the Lowland League champion (Spartans). From 2016 to 2017 the competition has been further expanded with the addition of Scottish Premiership Under-20 teams, additional places for the Highland and Lowland Leagues, which now have four representatives each, as well as the top two teams from Northern Ireland and Wales. The top two teams not to qualify for European competition from the League of Ireland were included in the competition for the 2017–18 season.

From 2018–19, the competition was further expanded with the two highest ranked teams still remaining in England&#x27;s National League to take part from the second round. The first English teams to compete were Sutton United and Boreham Wood. The age level was raised for colts teams from under-20 to under-21 in a rule change introduced by the SPFL ahead of 2018–19 competition. The 2018–19 final also saw Connah&#x27;s Quay Nomads become the first non-Scottish side to play in the final.

The COVID-19 pandemic in Scotland had a significant impact on the competition. The 2019–20 final, between Inverness Caledonian Thistle and Raith Rovers, was originally scheduled for 28 March 2020 but was postponed and later cancelled, with the teams sharing the title. Continuing restrictions on fans entering stadiums meant that the competition was unviable for most SPFL clubs, and the scheduled 2020–21 edition was cancelled in October 2020. It was announced in May 2021, that only Scottish clubs would participate in 2021–22 due to the coronavirus pandemic.

In 2024, it was announced that the format following the conclusion of the 2024–25 edition of the cup would change, where non-Scottish teams would no longer participate, whilst, controversially, the Premiership B Teams would still take part.

== Venues ==

In the rounds before the final, the venue of each match is determined when the fixtures are drawn; the first club drawn in a fixture is named the home team and chooses the venue for the match, usually its own home ground. The venue may be switched to that of the away team or changed to a neutral venue for security reasons such as being unable to host a club with a large travelling fan base or the venue being unavailable.

=== Final venue ===
The final match of the tournament is played at a neutral venue, usually one that is geographically close or equidistant to where the clubs contesting the match are based. As of 2024, eleven different venues have hosted the final. Fir Park in Motherwell was the first, in 1990, and has since hosted four more finals, the last in 2017. McDiarmid Park in Perth has been the most frequent venue, staging it ten times between 1994 and 2018. Other venues to host the final more than once are Broadwood Stadium (Cumbernauld), Excelsior Stadium (Airdrie), Almondvale Stadium (Livingston) and Falkirk Stadium (Falkirk). The 2016 final was held at Hampden Park, the national stadium in Glasgow, due to the large support of eventual winners Rangers; that final drew the competition&#x27;s record attendance of over 48,000.

== Winners and finalists ==
A total of 27 clubs have reached the final, of whom 17 have won the competition. The first winners were Dundee in 1990. The most successful club is Falkirk with four wins from four final appearances. Ross County, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Queen of the South and Hamilton Academical are the only four clubs to have reached the final five times, Ross County and Hamilton Academical winning on three occasions, Inverness Caledonian Thistle winning two and sharing one and Queen of the South winning twice and losing thrice. Three clubs have reached the final in successive seasons; Ayr United did so in the first two years of the tournament but lost both. The only teams to have successfully defended their title are Hamilton Academical and the original Airdrieonians, whilst Raith Rovers defended theirs uniquely, sharing their first with Inverness Caledonian Thistle in April 2021, due to the COVID-19 Pandemic cancelling the match, before defeating Queen of the South in the following final in 2021–22. It is possible for the winner of the tournament to be unable to defend their title; if a club is promoted from the Scottish Championship (second tier) in the same season to the Scottish Premiership (first tier), the club becomes ineligible to compete in the tournament. This has happened to Falkirk twice, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, St Mirren, Rangers and Ross County.

Most winners and finalists have been from the second tier, while only four teams have won the competition from below this division. Stenhousemuir became the first team to do so in 1995, followed by Stranraer a year later in 1996 and Alloa Athletic in 1999. The most recent club to win from below the second tier was Queen of the South, in 2013. All winners and runners-up from below the second tier have been from the third tier.

In 2019, Connah&#x27;s Quay Nomads of Wales were the first non-Scottish side to reach the final of the Scottish Challenge Cup; despite taking the lead in the 21st minute, they eventually lost 3–1 to Ross County. In 2024, another Welsh side, The New Saints also made the final of the Challenge Cup, becoming the second non foreign side to achieve this feat, however, like Connah&#x27;s Quay, fell to defeat after taking an early lead, eventually losing 2–1 to Airdrieonians. They would become the last foreign side to reach the final, as the format for the following seasons would not include non-Scottish sides.

== Finals ==
The winner of the tournament is decided by a final elimination match which lasts 90 minutes plus any additional stoppage time. If the score is level and a winner has not been determined after 90 minutes of normal time, 30 minutes of extra time is played, followed by a penalty shoot-out if the score is still level. Eight finals have gone to extra time, with two being decided in this period of play. The further six have been decided by penalty shoot-out.

== Sponsorship and media coverage ==

The Scottish Challenge Cup has been sponsored several times since it was introduced in 1990. The sponsor has been able to determine the name of the competition. There have been four sponsors since the competition&#x27;s formation as well as several name changes within the duration of each sponsorship. The competition relies on revenue earned from sponsorship although it has been able to run without a sponsor over two periods but had to be suspended for one season in 1998–99 as a consequence.

<text>Marshall Hall was an amusement park at Marshall Hall, Maryland, located diagonally south from Mount Vernon, Virginia (the home of George Washington) on the banks of the Potomac River. The site of a small amusement park opened in the early 1920s and included a small wooden roller coaster. A larger wooden roller coaster was built in its place in 1950. The coaster was destroyed by tornado force winds in July 1977 and was the beginning of the end for the park. Marshall Hall as an amusement park closed in 1980. It was a favorite of Washington, D.C. residents who often arrived by excursion boat.

The large brick stable and brick carriage house that once stood on the property were demolished to give way to a picnic pavilion. All that is left standing is Marshall Hall, the shell of the colonial home of the original Marshall family.

<text>Jovan Kirovski (; born March 18, 1976) is an American former soccer player who is the former technical director for the Los Angeles Galaxy in Major League Soccer. Kirovski is the first American to win the UEFA Champions League (with Borussia Dortmund although he did not play in the final) and the first to score in a Champions League match. He has won an MLS Cup championship as a player, assistant coach, and technical director.

==Club career==
Born in Escondido, California, Kirovski, is the son of Macedonian immigrants. He was a member of the Nomads Soccer Club from 1991. He joined Manchester United&#x27;s youth team in 1992, becoming the first American-born player to sign with the club. He led the reserve team in scoring in 1996, but was not able to break into the first team because of work permit regulations. After that season, he signed with Borussia Dortmund in the German Bundesliga. Kirovski spent the next four seasons in Germany. He played in Dortmund&#x27;s 1996–97 UEFA Champions League campaign, becoming the first American to win the competition. He earned significant playing time during the 1998–99 season, when Borussia loaned him out to second division club Fortuna Köln.

In 2000, Kirovski signed with Portuguese club Sporting CP. After a season there, he went back to England, signing with Football League First Division club Crystal Palace. In 2002, Kirovski signed with Birmingham City, but after one and a half seasons, he signed with the Los Angeles Galaxy.

In his first season in MLS, Kirovski scored eight goals. In 2005, the Galaxy traded him to the Colorado Rapids for a first round pick in the 2007 MLS SuperDraft. After spending the 2008 season with the San Jose Earthquakes, he rejoined the Galaxy in a November 2008 trade. Kirovski enjoyed a successful stint with the Galaxy, winning an MLS Cup in 2011 with the club. On January 23, 2012, Kirovski retired from soccer but remained on the coaching staff for the LA Galaxy as an assistant coach. A member of Bruce Arena&#x27;s coaching staff, Kirovski helped the team repeat as MLS Cup champions in 2012.

Kirovski was appointed by the LA Galaxy as the club&#x27;s technical director on January 10, 2013. As Technical Director, Kirovski was instrumental in the creation of the club&#x27;s USL affiliate LA Galaxy II, which was established in January 2014. Kirovski served as the point man in the Galaxy&#x27;s pursuit and eventual signing of Mexican forward Giovani dos Santos in August 2015. He also aided the Galaxy in their signing of Jelle Van Damme a year later. Kirovski served as the lead in the Galaxy&#x27;s signing of 2017 team Most Valuable Player Romain Alessandrini, as well as the addition of Mexican international Jonathan dos Santos in the same year. Kiroski led the team&#x27;s pursuit of Swedish soccer legend Zlatan Ibrahimović, who joined the club officially in March 2018. Kirovski&#x27;s rich global network from his time as a player helped to complete the deal.

==International career==
Kirovski made his debut for the United States national team at the age of 18 on October 19, 1994, against Saudi Arabia, and played at the 1996 Olympics and the 1999 and 2003 editions of the FIFA Confederations Cup. Kirovski earned 62 caps in total with the US.

<doc id="1115685" wikidata="Q3942555" url="?curid=1115685" title="Roger of Helmarshausen">
<text>Roger of Helmarshausen (fl. 12th century) was a well-known goldsmith and metalwork artist, and also a Benedictine monk.

==Artistic career==
Roger was born around 1070 in the Meuse region. He is first heard of in connection with Stavelot Abbey in the Meuse valley, a centre of Mosan art, and especially goldsmith&#x27;s work. Having completed his apprenticeship he worked between 1100 and 1107 at the Monastery of St. Pantaleon in Cologne. At least two portable altars made by him are in the treasury of Paderborn Cathedral.

In 1107 the relics of Saint Modoald were translated from Trier to Helmarshausen Abbey, and the escort stopped at St. Pantaleon&#x27;s on the way. Shortly after this, Roger moved to Helmarshausen Abbey, where he established a goldsmith&#x27;s workshop. In conjunction with the well-known scriptorium, where the Gospels of Henry the Lion were produced later in the 12th century, he created several important works in the Romanesque style, including various illuminated codices, as well as many pieces of jewellery.

==&quot;De diversis artibus&quot;==
Roger has been proposed by a number of academics (for example, Albert Ilg (1874) and C. R. Dodwell (1961)) as the real author of the important medieval treatise &quot;De diversis artibus&quot; (also &quot;Schedula diversarum artium&quot;), which is ascribed to the pseudonymous Theophilus Presbyter. This suggestion is not universally accepted, but has been supported by other academics, including Cyril Stanley Smith (1963 and 1974), Lynn White Jr. (1964) and Eckhard Freise (1981).

<text>Sargon (stylized in all caps) is a line of chess-playing software for personal computers. The original &quot;Sargon&quot; from 1978 was written in assembly language by Dan and Kathleen &quot;Kathe&quot; Spracklen for the Z80-based Wavemate Jupiter II.

==History==
&quot;Sargon&quot; was introduced at the 1978 West Coast Computer Faire where it won the first computer chess tournament held strictly for microcomputers, with a score of 5–0. This success encouraged the authors to seek financial income by selling the program directly to customers. Since magnetic media were not widely available at the time, the authors placed an advert in &quot;Byte&quot; magazine selling for $15 photocopied listings that would work in any Z80-based microcomputer. Availability of the source code allowed porting to other machines. For example, the March–April 1979 issue of &quot;Recreational Computing&quot; describes a project that converted Sargon to an 8080 program by using macros. Later the Spracklens were contacted by Hayden Books and a book was published.

===Commercialization===
When magnetic media publishing became widely available, a US Navy petty officer, Paul Lohnes, ported &quot;Sargon&quot; to the TRS-80, altering the graphics, input, and housekeeping routines but leaving the Spracklens&#x27; chess-playing algorithm intact. Paul consulted with the Spracklens, who were both living in San Diego at the time, to make the TRS-80 version an instant success with the help of Hayden Book&#x27;s newly established software division: Hayden Software. Paul was not involved in further refinements to the TRS-80 version due to his reassignment to sea duty shortly after signing the deal with Hayden Software.

In the early 1980s, SARGON CHESS was ported to the Nascom (by Bits &amp; PCs, 1981), Exidy Sorcerer, and Sharp MZ 80K. A complete rewrite was necessary later for the Apple II, programmed by Kathleen&#x27;s brother Gary Shannon. Both were published by Hayden Software.

===Improved versions===
The Spracklens made significant improvements on the original program and released &quot;Sargon II&quot;. J. Mishcon reviewed &quot;Sargon II&quot; in the October 1980 issue of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; magazine, stating that the program beat him regularly on level 5, which took 40 minutes per move. He often beat the program at level 3—when it considered moves for about two minutes—and stated that &quot;Level 0 is an idiot but responds instantly&quot;.

&quot;Sargon 2.5&quot;, sold as a ROM module for the Chafitz Modular Game System, was identical to &quot;Sargon II&quot; but incorporated pondering. It received a 1641 rating at the Paul Masson tournament in June–July 1979, and 1736 at the San Jose City College Open in January 1980.
&quot;Sargon 3.0&quot; finished in seventh place at the October 1979 North American Computer Chess Championship. The competition had improved, but 3.0 drew against Cray Blitz and easily defeated &quot;Mychess&quot;, its main microcomputer rival. In December, 3.0 easily won the second microcomputer championship in London.
&quot;Sargon III&quot; was a complete rewrite. Instead of an &quot;exchange evaluator&quot;, this version used a &quot;capture search&quot; algorithm. Also included was a chess opening repertoire. This third version was written originally for the 6502 assembler. In 1978, Sargon was converted to Z80 mmemonics/assembler code by Paul H. Lohnes, as self taught computer enthusiast while he was still in the US Navy. He sold the publishing rights to Hayden Software for the Radio Shack TRS-80 platform. It was commercially published for other computing platforms by Hayden Software in 1983. Apple contacted the Spracklens and, after a port for 68000 assembly, &quot;Sargon III&quot; was the first third-party executable software for the Macintosh.

==Legacy==
After the demise of Hayden Software, later chess programs were also released under the name &quot;Sargon&quot;, including &quot;Sargon 4&quot; (Spinnaker Software), &quot;Sargon V&quot; (Activision) and a CD-i title simply named &quot;Sargon Chess&quot;. The CD-i game received 75% from the French magazine &quot;Génération 4&quot;. A compilation titled &quot;4-in-1 Fun Pak&quot; was released for the Game Boy in 1992. One of the games in the compilation is &quot;Sargon Chess&quot;.

The Spracklens concurrently wrote the engines for the dedicated chess computers produced by Fidelity Electronics, which won the first four World Microcomputer Chess Championships.

===The Botvinnik game===

The three-time world chess champion Mikhail Botvinnik played a game with Sargon in 1983 at Hamburg. He did not play his best moves but only tested the program&#x27;s capabilities. Botvinnik himself was also involved in chess program development.

<doc id="1115701" wikidata="Q6174814" url="?curid=1115701" title="Jeff Robbin">
<text>Jeffrey L. Robbin is an executive and software engineer at Apple, Inc. He developed the SoundJam music player software, which was acquired by Apple in 2000. There, he created iTunes, and was &quot;closely involved&quot; with the iPod&#x27;s development. In 2011, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that he was leading development of an Apple television set, a device rumored in Steve Jobs&#x27;s autobiography. As of 2018, he led the Apple Music product and engineering teams.

== Early life ==
Robbin was born in Chicago. He took computer science courses as an undergraduate, and later obtained an MBA.

== Career ==
While pursuing an MBA, Robbin joined Apple in 1992. There, he worked on Copland, Apple&#x27;s troubled operating system project, alongside fellow software engineer Bill Kincaid. Robbin and Kincaid both left Apple in early 1997; Kincaid joined a startup, while Robbin went on to create several Mac utilities which were distributed by Casady &amp; Greene. One of these utilities was Conflict Catcher, a system extension for the classic Mac OS that could automatically detect and resolve conflicts between system extensions; these conflicts were one of the main causes of Mac OS system crashes.

=== SoundJam MP ===
In 1999, Robbin joined Kincaid and Dave Heller to start a small company, SoundStep, and develop SoundJam MP, a software jukebox that played MP3 files. The idea for SoundJam came from Kincaid&#x27;s desire to make the Rio MP3 player compatible with the Mac. Robbin chose Casady &amp; Greene as SoundJam&#x27;s software distributor. David Pogue wrote the user manuals for SoundJam and Conflict Catcher, before he joined the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

SoundJam received positive reviews, and won the Best of Macworld award in 1999; it eventually secured 90% of the Mac MP3 software market. SoundJam competed with the Audion app, made by Panic. Both companies were vying to be acquired by Apple, but since Panic was already discussing a buyout with AOL, and since Robbin and Kincaid were ex-Apple employees, Apple chose to buy SoundJam in 2000. Apple hired Robbin, Kincaid and Heller, and used SoundJam&#x27;s code as the foundation for iTunes.

=== iTunes and iPod ===
Shortly after the acquisition, Robbin was chosen by Steve Jobs to lead the iTunes development team, a position he still had a decade later. Jobs tasked Robbin with making the program easier to use to meet Apple&#x27;s user experience goals; Robbin&#x27;s team stripped the search box of its complex options, and adopted the brushed-metal look previously seen on iMovie. Less than four months later, in January 2001, iTunes was released for free as part of Apple&#x27;s digital hub strategy, and was received with enthusiasm.
In 2001, Apple started work on the forthcoming iPod, with Tony Fadell in charge of the iPod&#x27;s hardware, and Robbin&#x27;s iTunes team responsible for the iPod&#x27;s firmware and user interface, basing the firmware on software by Pixo. Robbin later told CNN that the process happened through &quot;trial and error&quot;, with a continuous focus on simplification. Steve Jobs and Robbin were credited as inventors of the iPod&#x27;s interface in a patent; the patent was initially denied due to prior art, but was later granted in 2012.

Jobs&#x27; 2011 biography names Robbin as one of the Apple executives who convinced Jobs to release iTunes on Windows; the port was released in 2003. One of Robbin&#x27;s design goals was to ensure the Mac and Windows versions would be perfectly equivalent.

In 2004 and 2005, Apple collaborated with Motorola to create the ROKR E1 (also known as the &quot;iTunes phone&quot;). As the iTunes lead, Robbin worked closely with his Motorola counterparts, but was frustrated with Motorola&#x27;s lack of cooperation, according to Fadell in a later interview. The phone was not commercially successful upon release.

In an October 2005 article, &quot;TIME&quot; magazine&#x27;s Lev Grossman said that Steve Jobs had invited him to meet Robbin, but had prohibited him from printing Robbin&#x27;s last name, because Jobs was worried about competitors &quot;poaching his talent&quot;. On September 9, 2009, Robbin was one of the presenters at a music-focused Apple keynote, where he demoed the new features of iTunes 9, including iTunes LP.

=== Later projects ===
In 2011, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that Robbin was in charge of Apple&#x27;s effort to create a television set. Apple&#x27;s plans to create a TV had been previously revealed in Steve Jobs&#x27;s biography. The plans never came to fruition, and Apple abandoned the television project in 2014, after it was deemed to not be worth it.

In 2018, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that Jeff Robbin led the Apple Music product and engineering teams, having taken over after the music service&#x27;s much-criticized 2015 launch.

In March 2023, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that starting in April, Robbin will take charge of Apple&#x27;s cloud services, including iCloud, CloudKit, and the infrastructure that hosts iMessage and FaceTime.

<doc id="1115715" wikidata="Q5759735" url="?curid=1115715" title="Hightown, Merseyside">
<text>Hightown is a village and civil parish in the Metropolitan Borough of Sefton in Merseyside, England, located midway between the city of Liverpool and the coastal resort of Southport. It is 8 miles north of Liverpool city centre and is located on the coast near the boundary of the Mersey Estuary and Liverpool Bay. The River Alt joins the sea at this point and forms an estuary. There is a pumping station on the River Alt at Altmouth, built 1972, as part of a programme to alleviate flooding in the area. This is on the Altcar Rifle Range, a Territorial Army base originally established in 1860 by Lt. Col. Gladstone.

The village is featured in &#x27;Lancashire Life&#x27; magazine, May 2004 &#x27;Tales of the sea at Hightown, near Southport&#x27; pp. 150–154
by Harold Brough, photographs by John Cocks.

==History==
A dictionary of English Place-Names, A. D. Mills (OUP, Oxford, 1991) lists only a Hightown as a part of Congleton in Cheshire (there is also part of Banbury in Oxfordshire called Hightown). However specific books on Lancashire place names do list this Hightown in what was formerly Lancashire. Altmouth as a settlement features on many old maps prior to the 18th century, north of where the village is now, bordering Altcar parish. Alt Grange is recorded as 13th century. David Mills in his book &quot;The place-names of Lancashire&quot; does give High Town dated 1702. However he gives no source or reference. Understandably Mills appears to have not visited the small West Lancashire coastal village or he would not have given the description &quot;the major town .. The name appears to be modern and self-explanatory&quot;. The first recorded mention of the place name Hightown is in Nicholas Blundell&#x27;s Diaries. Nicholas Blundell&#x27;s Diaries, Vol. 3 1720 (published 1972) refers to visiting High-Town Greene on the 18 May 1722 (p. 77). There is still a village green today (oddly triangular) near the pub and railway station but unlike when Nicholas Blundell visited there are no cattle pens on it. However the earliest record of the place is probably in a probate record for Richard Riding of Moorhouses in Little Crosby husbandman from 1715. Moorhouses was a hamlet on the shore where Hightown is today, it is remembered in the name of one of the modern closes. The inventory for Richard Riding&#x27;s property records it as being of the property of “Richard Rydeing of the Hytown within Crosbie Parava.” High Town is recorded on Greenwood&#x27;s Map of Lancashire, 1818, north east of where the village is today, approximately at the junction of Orrell Hill Lane with the modern A565

Hightown is historically part of the estate of the Blundell family of Little Crosby and many houses still pay a nominal ground rent annually to the Whitlock-Blundell estate. Hightown beach is the site of a former wartime military base known as Fort Crosby. The fort was situated midway between Hightown and Hall Road and housed a number of Italian and German POW&#x27;s during WWII. Following its decommission at the end of the war a small cinema screen within the complex was reputedly used by local residents for a number of years until the camp was finally demolished in the mid-1960s. Remains of many of the buildings, pathways and fences can still be seen today.

During the early part of the 20th century the village formed its own voluntary fire service following a number of deaths and injuries resulting from the excessive time taken for the Crosby Fire Service to reach the village. The most notable of these incidents was the loss of a family during a blaze within the lighthouse which once stood close to the site of Fort Crosby. The lighthouse was built in 1839. The most prominent buildings at the turn of the 20th century were the Truant School, next to the railway line, and the Hightown Hotel (the village pub). In 1901 “There were 20 officials and 114 boys in the truant school at Hightown, belonging to the Liverpool education authority.”

Listed buildings and Second World War remains. heritagegateway.org.uk (a partnership project of English Heritage) lists Hightown Cross and three listed buildings in Hightown: the Cross itself, Whitedge Farmhouse (Alt Road) and Rose Cottage. In the immediate vicinity Moss Farmhouse, North End Lane, is also listed. Three World War Two invasion defence pillboxes can be seen near Gorsey Lane and are listed in the database, each as: Type 23 World War II concrete pillbox, constructed in the period 1940 to 1941. These are found in the Defence of Britain Archive of the Council for British Archaeology, 2002.

Listed as in poor condition (surveyed in 2000) is Coastal Battery S0011771 (Crosby Point Battery), between Coastguard Station and Hightown, north of Crosby. This is near the end of the West Lancs Golf Course, a mile south from Hightown station just off the footpath from Hall Road to Hightown. When Sefton Council upgraded the Sefton Coastal Footpath they blocked up two gun emplacements that remained of the Fort Crosby site. A former resident alleged in 2011 that Sefton Council had deliberately neglected the World War II heritage at Hightown, but there is no evidence of deliberate neglect. An exhibition by artist Tom Fairclough &#x27;Collateral&#x27; contained peaceful but evocative pictures of the rubble that make up the sea defences at the mouth of the Alt. Fairclough documented how the rubble was the remains of houses from the destruction in Bootle in the blitz of May 1941.

The most authoritative local history reference on Hightown, Merseyside is:
&quot;My Hightown 1897 - 1969&quot; by Joe Bulman. 1st ed. 1975. The 3rd ed. revised and enlarged by Andrew Lee-Hart and
Matthew Tinker published by Sefton Libraries Corporation, Southport, 2003. This edition of the book contains 40 photographs, 2 maps &amp; 8 appendices including personal stories of men listed on the Hightown War Memorial (Appendix 3 by Hal Giblin), and history of The Truant School (Appendix 7 by Andrew Lee-Hart).

==Transport==
The village is served by Hightown railway station, on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network. Services run to Southport and to Hunts Cross via Liverpool city centre. The Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway opened in 1848 (from Southport to Waterloo initially). It was absorbed in the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, 1850. There is also a local bus service that runs to Hall Road, located in nearby Crosby.

==Sport==
The Blundellsands Sailing Club celebrated its centenary in 2007. The clubhouse is located on the foreshore and the post code is L38 0BU. On the beach, approximately 50 metres from the Sailing club are the remains of a three- to four-thousand-year-old forest.

Hightown also has its own sports club, the Hightown Club, which also celebrated its centenary in 2007. A brief history was written at this time and featured on the club&#x27;s cricket website and in local media.

Today the Hightown Club offers sporting and social facilities for lawn bowls, cricket, squash, tennis and junior football 
, although in the past there have been highly successful hockey and rugby sections. The rugby section sadly folded in 2000 and men&#x27;s hockey merged with Northern in the mid-1980s.
The Hightown ladies hockey team were one of the country&#x27;s most prominent clubs in the 1980s and 90s, when they were led by England international Maggie Souyave. Since then they have played in several locations outside the village before eventually settling at Cheshire club Bowdon.

Cricket is most prominent sport played at the club, with the 1st XI currently playing in the Premier League of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition. The captain for the 2012 season will be Shaun Vosloo, who replaced Ian Sutcliffe following the latter&#x27;s 11-year reign as skipper.

On 16 January 2011 the club was completely destroyed by a large fire due to an electrical fault near the function suite.
Since the fire, all the sporting sections have been using temporary facilities and the club is planning a complete rebuild of the clubhouse, with work to commence in 2012.

==Governance==
From 1950 until 2010 Hightown was within the boundaries of the Crosby constituency, whose MP from 1997 until 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party. Prior to her election the Crosby seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MPs elected at every election barring the 1981 Crosby by-election where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Crosby constituency was abolished with its northern parts, including Hightown, being merged with the eastern parts of Sefton that were formerly part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency, to form the new constituency of Sefton Central, which is currently represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson.

For elections to Sefton Council the village and Civil parish of Hightown is within the Manor electoral ward and is represented by three councillors. The councillors of Manor ward are Martyn Barber of the Conservative Party, John Gibson of the Liberal Democrats, and Steve McGinnity of the Labour Party.

<doc id="1115725" wikidata="Q274172" url="?curid=1115725" title="Annette Kellerman">
<text>Annette Marie Sarah Kellermann (6 July 1886 – 6 November 1975) was an Australian professional swimmer, vaudeville star, film actress, and writer, usually spelt with a single final n as Annette Kellerman.

Kellermann was one of the first women to wear a one-piece bathing costume, instead of the then-accepted pantaloons, and inspired others to follow her example. Kellerman&#x27;s swimming costumes became so popular that she started her own fashion line of one-piece bathing suits. Kellermann helped popularize the sport of synchronised swimming, and authored a swimming manual. She appeared in several movies, usually with aquatic themes, and as the star of the 1916 film &quot;A Daughter of the Gods&quot; was the first major actress to appear nude in a Hollywood production. Kellermann was an advocate of health, fitness, and natural beauty throughout her life.

== Early life ==
Annette Kellermann was born in Marrickville, New South Wales, Australia, on 6 July 1886, to Australian-born violinist Frederick William Kellermann, and his French wife, Alice Ellen Charbonnet, a pianist and music teacher.

At the age of six, a weakness in Kellermann&#x27;s legs necessitated the wearing of steel braces to strengthen them. To further overcome her disability, her parents enrolled her in swimming classes at Cavill&#x27;s Baths, a tidal swimming pool in the North Sydney suburb of Lavender Bay. By the age of 13, her legs were practically normal, and by 15, she had mastered all the swimming strokes and won her first race. At this time she was also giving diving displays.

== Swimming career ==

In 1902, Kellermann won the ladies&#x27; 100 yards and mile championships of New South Wales in the record times of 1 minute, 22 seconds and 33 minutes, 49 seconds respectively. In that same year, her parents decided to move to Melbourne, Victoria, and she was enrolled at Mentone Girls&#x27; Grammar School, where her mother had accepted a music teaching position.

During her time at school, Kellermann gave exhibitions of swimming and diving at the main Melbourne baths, performed a mermaid act at Princes Court entertainment centre, and did two shows a day swimming with fish in a glass tank at the Exhibition Aquarium. In June and July 1903, she performed sensational high dives in the Coogee scene of Bland Holt&#x27;s spectacular, &quot;The Breaking of the Drought&quot;, at the Melbourne Theatre Royal.

Kellermann and Beatrice Kerr, who was billed as &quot;Australia&#x27;s Champion Lady Swimmer and Diver&quot;, were rivals, although Kerr&#x27;s public challenges to Kellermann to meet in a competitive race went unanswered.

On 24 August 1905, aged 19, Kellermann was one of the first women to attempt to swim across the English Channel. A dover ship pilot said Kellermann was not permitted to swim any further on her attempts, despite his opinion being that she could have kept going for much longer. After three unsuccessful swims she declared, &quot;I had the endurance but not the brute strength.&quot; The first woman to attempt a Channel crossing had been Austrian Baroness Walburga von Isacescu, in September 1900. She had made a previous effort the month before alongside Ted Heaton, but had to leave the water several miles out in the channel due to sea-sickness. Kellermann later challenged and defeated von Isacescu in a Danube race.

While in London a short was filmed of her performances and shown back in Australian venues. 

In 1911, she appeared on Broadway in the title role of &quot;Undine&quot;, an aquacade specialty conceived by composer Manuel Klein and performed in repertory with the popular musical &quot;Vera Violetta&quot; that featured Al Jolson.

Kellermann performed a water ballet in a glass tank at the New York Hippodrome in 1917.

==Swimwear line==
Kellermann advocated for the right of women to wear a one-piece bathing suit, which was controversial at the time. According to an Australian magazine, &quot;In the early 1900s, women were expected to wear cumbersome dress and pantaloon combinations when swimming.&quot; Although Kellermann later claimed to have been arrested at Revere Beach for public indecency while wearing one of her suits, there are no contemporary police records or news stories corroborating this, and she appears to have invented the incident.

The popularity of her one-piece suits resulted in her own line of women&#x27;s swimwear. The &quot;Annette Kellermans&quot;, as they were known, were the first step towards modern women&#x27;s swimwear.

== Film career ==
In 1916, Kellermann became the first major actress to perform in a nude scene when she appeared fully nude in &quot;A Daughter of the Gods&quot;. Made by Fox Film Corporation, &quot;A Daughter of the Gods&quot; was the first million-dollar film production. Like many of Kellermann&#x27;s other films, this is now considered a lost film, as no copies are known to exist.
The majority of Kellermann&#x27;s films had themes of aquatic adventure. She performed her own stunts including diving from into the sea and into a pool of crocodiles. Many times she would play mermaids named Annette or variations of her own name. Her &quot;fairy tale films&quot;, as she called them, started with &quot;The Mermaid&quot; (1911), in which she was the first actress to wear a swimmable mermaid costume on film, paving the way for future screen sirens such as Glynis Johns (&quot;Miranda&quot;), Esther Williams, Ann Blyth (&quot;Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid&quot;) and Daryl Hannah (&quot;Splash&quot;). Kellermann designed her own mermaid swimming costumes and sometimes made them herself. Similar designs are still used by the Weeki Wachee Springs Mermaids, including her aquatic fairy costume first introduced in &quot;Queen of the Sea&quot; (1918, another lost film).

Kellermann appeared in one of the last films made in Prizma Color, &quot;Venus of the South Seas&quot; (1924), a US/New Zealand co-production where one reel of the 55-minute film was in colour and underwater. &quot;Venus of the South Seas&quot; was restored by the Library of Congress in 2004 and is the only feature film starring Kellermann known to exist in its complete form.

== Publications ==
In addition to her film and stage career, Kellermann wrote several books including &quot;How to Swim&quot; (1918), &quot;Physical Beauty: How to Keep It&quot; (1919), a book of children&#x27;s stories titled &quot;Fairy Tales of the South Seas&quot; (1926), and &quot;My Story&quot;, an unpublished autobiography. She also wrote numerous mail order booklets on health, beauty, and fitness called The Body Beautiful.

== Personal life ==

Kellermann married her American-born manager, James Sullivan, on or around 26 November 1912 at Danbury, Connecticut.

A life-long vegetarian, Kellermann owned a health food store in Long Beach, California, later in life. She remained active well into old age, continuing to swim and exercise until a short time before her death. She and her husband returned to live in Australia in 1970, and in 1974, she was honoured by the International Swimming Hall of Fame at Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

Kellermann outlived her husband and died in the hospital at Southport, Queensland, Australia, on 6 November 1975, aged 89. She was cremated with Roman Catholic rites. Her remains were scattered in the Great Barrier Reef. She had no children.

== Legacy ==
In 1908, after a study of 3,000 women, Dudley A. Sargent of Harvard University dubbed Kellerman the &quot;Perfect Woman&quot; because of the similarity of her physical attributes to the Venus de Milo. During her Fox film series, she was often billed as &#x27;Australia&#x27;s Perfect Woman.&#x27;

Kellermann&#x27;s large collection of costumes and theatrical memorabilia was bequeathed to the Sydney Opera House. Today, many of her original costumes and personal items are held by the Powerhouse Museum in Sydney, Australia.

The Mitchell collection, State Library of New South Wales holds Kellerman&#x27;s archive of personal papers.

Kellerman was portrayed by Esther Williams in the film &quot;Million Dollar Mermaid&quot; (1952), and her name is on a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, on Hollywood Boulevard. An award-winning Australian documentary called &quot;The Original Mermaid&quot;, which was about Kellermann, was produced in 2002.

A swimming complex in Marrickville which opened December 2010 was named after her.

The streets in the suburb of Holt in the Australian capital Canberra are all named after Australian sportspeople, and Kellermann Close was named for her.

In 2016, X Swimwear, a made-to-measure swimwear line, launched a custom swimsuit called &quot;The Kellerman&quot; after her.

The American thoroughbred mare Annette K. (foaled in 1921 out of the mare Bathing Girl) was named after her. Annette K. became the grandam of U.S. Triple Crown winner War Admiral.

<text>Friedrich Conrad Hornemann (15 September 1772 – 1801) was a German explorer in Africa.

Hornemann was born in Hildesheim, a city in Lower Saxony, Germany, located about 30 km southeast of Hannover. He was a young man when, early in 1796, he offered his services to the African Association of London as an explorer in Africa. The African Association sent him to the University of Göttingen to study Arabic and otherwise prepare for an expedition from the east into the unknown regions of North Africa. In September 1797 he arrived in Egypt, where he continued his studies. When the country was invaded by the French, he was confined in the citadel of Cairo to preserve him from the fanaticism of the populace. Liberated by the French, he received the patronage of Bonaparte. On 5 September 1798 he joined a caravan returning to the Maghreb from Mecca, attaching himself to a party of Fezzan merchants who accompanied the pilgrims. As an avowed Christian would not have been permitted to join the caravan Hornemann assumed the character of a young mamluk trading to Fezzan. He then spoke, but indifferently, both Arabic and Turkish, and he was accompanied as servant and interpreter by Joseph Freudenburg, a German convert to Islam, who had thrice made the pilgrimage to Mecca. Travelling by way of the oases of Siwa and Aujila, a black rocky desert was traversed to Temissa in Fezzan. Murzuk was reached on 17 November 1798.

Here Hornemann lived until June 1799, going thence to the city of Tripoli, whence in August of the same year he despatched his journals to London. He then returned to Murzuk. Nothing further is known with certainty concerning him or his companion. In Murzuk Hornemann had collected a great deal of trustworthy information concerning the peoples and countries of the western Sahara and central Sudan, and when he left Tripoli it was his intention to go directly to the Hausa country, which region he was the first European definitely to locate. &quot;If I do not perish in my undertaking&quot;, he wrote in his journal, &quot;I hope in five years I shall be able to make the Society better acquainted with the people of whom I have given this short description.&quot; The British consul at Tripoli heard from a source believed to be trustworthy that about June 1803 Jusef (Hornemann&#x27;s Muslim name) was at Caina, i.e. Katsina, in Northern Nigeria, in good health and highly respected as a marabout. A report reached Murzuk in 1819 that the traveller had gone to Noofy (Nupe), and had died there. Hornemann was the first European in modern times to traverse the north-eastern Sahara, and up to 1910 no other explorer had followed his route across the Jebel-es-Suda from Aujila to Temissa.

The original text of Hornemann&#x27;s journal, which was written in German, was printed at Weimar in 1801; an English translation, &quot;The Journal of Frederick Hornemann&#x27;s travels, from Cairo to Mourzouk : the Capital of the Kingdom of Fezzan, in Africa&quot;, with maps and dissertations
by Major James Rennell, appeared in London in 1802. A French translation of the English work, made by order of the First Consuls and augmented with notes and a memoir on the Egyptian oases by L. Langlès, was published in Paris in the following year. The French version is the most valuable of the three. Consult also the &quot;Proceedings of the African Association&quot; (1810), and &quot;The Geographical Journal&quot; November 1906.

<doc id="1115738" wikidata="Q1368990" url="?curid=1115738" title="Long nineteenth century">
<text>The long nineteenth century is a term for the 125-year period beginning with the onset of the French Revolution in 1789, and ending with the outbreak of World War I in 1914. It was coined by Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg and later popularized by British historian Eric Hobsbawm. The term refers to the notion that the period reflects a progression of ideas which are characteristic to an understanding of the 19th century in Europe.

== Background ==
The concept is an adaption of Fernand Braudel&#x27;s 1949 notion of &quot;le long seizième siècle&quot; (&quot;the long 16th century&quot; 1450–1640) and &quot;a recognized category of literary history&quot;, although a period often broadly and diversely defined by different scholars. Numerous authors, before and after Hobsbawm&#x27;s 1995 publication, have applied similar forms of book titles or descriptions to indicate a selective time frame for their works, such as: S. Kettering&#x27;s &quot;French Society: 1589–1715 – the long seventeenth century&quot;, E. Anthony Wrigley&#x27;s &quot;British population during the &#x27;long&#x27; eighteenth century, 1680–1840&quot;, or D. Blackbourn&#x27;s &quot;The long nineteenth century: A history of Germany, 1780–1918&quot;. However, the term has been used in support of historical publications to &quot;connect with broader audiences&quot; and is regularly cited in studies and discussions across academic disciplines, such as history, linguistics and the arts.

Hobsbawm lays out his analysis in &quot;The Age of Revolution: Europe 1789–1848&quot; (1962), &quot;The Age of Capital: 1848–1875&quot; (1975), and &quot;The Age of Empire: 1875–1914&quot; (1987). Hobsbawm starts his long 19th century with the French Revolution, which sought to establish universal and egalitarian citizenship in France, and ends it with the outbreak of World War I, upon the conclusion of which in 1918 the long-enduring European power balance of the 19th century proper (1801–1900) was eliminated.

In a sequel to the above-mentioned trilogy, &quot;The Age of Extremes: The Short Twentieth Century, 1914–1991&quot; (1994), Hobsbawm details the short 20th century (a concept originally proposed by Iván T. Berend), beginning with World War I and ending with the fall of the Soviet Union, between 1914&quot;–&quot;1991.

A more generalized version of the long 19th century, lasting from 1750 to 1914, is often used by Peter N. Stearns in the context of the world history school.

== Religious history ==
In religious contexts, specifically those concerning the history of the Catholic Church, the long 19th century was a period of centralization of papal power over the Catholic Church. This centralization was in opposition to the increasingly centralized nation states and contemporary revolutionary movements and used many of the same organizational and communication techniques as its rivals. The church&#x27;s long 19th century extended from the French Revolution (1789) until the death of Pope Pius XII (1958). This covers the period between the decline of traditional Catholic power and the emergence of secular ideas within states, and the emergence of new thinking within the church after the election of Pope John XXIII.

<text>Shalbourne is a village and civil parish in the English county of Wiltshire, about southwest of Hungerford, Berkshire. The parish has a number of widely spaced small settlements including Bagshot and Stype, to the north, and Rivar and Oxenwood to the south. Before 1895, about half of the parish of Shalbourne (including its church) lay in Berkshire.

== History ==

Domesday Book of 1086 recorded a settlement of 48 households at &quot;Saldeborne&quot; or &quot;Scaldeburne.&quot;

Under the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844, Oxenwood tithing was transferred from Berkshire to Wiltshire. Bagshot tithing was transferred in 1895, to complete the consolidation of the parish within Wiltshire.

== Parish church ==
The Anglican Church of St Michael and All Angels is Grade II* listed. Built in flint and stone with tiled roofs, it dates from the 12th or 13th century and was partly rebuilt and extended by G.F. Bodley in 1873.

The nave is either 12th century or a 13th-century rebuilding; reconstruction of the south aisle in the 19th century reused two 12th-century doorways. The chancel was rebuilt around 1300, and the tower added in the 15th century.

Three of the six bells in the tower are from the 17th century. The east chancel window has 1871 stained glass by Kempe. A window by Henry Haig was added in 1995, from designs of Karl Parsons, who lived at Shalbourne from 1930 until the onset of ill health in 1933.

The benefice was united with that of Ham with Buttermere in 1956. Today the parish is part of the Savernake Team, a group of eleven village parishes.

== Other buildings ==
Also Grade II* listed are West Court farmhouse (15th and 17th centuries) and Shalbourne Manor farmhouse (16th century).

== Geography ==
The Shalbourne Stream flows northeast from its spring-fed source near Shalbourne village, to join the River Dun above Hungerford.

==Local government==
The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council, a unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

==Amenities==
Shalbourne has a primary school, and a village hall which was built in 1843 as a schoolroom. It has a cricket pitch and pavilion with a bar. At the centre of the village, near the village green, are the pub (The Plough) and a small post office and shop which sells a variety of products and refreshments. The shop stocks organic vegetables from Shalbourne&#x27;s community project, a small allotment that sells vegetable boxes to the village and surroundings.

==Notable people==
*Alexander Chocke of Shalbourne (1594–1625) was elected to Parliament for Ludgershall in 1621.
* From 1608 until late 1637, tenants of the parish&#x27;s Westcourt Manor included William Carpenter and his namesake son, both of whom emigrated to Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1638 on the &quot;Bevis&quot; from Southampton. The younger William was a founder of Rehoboth, Massachusetts. The Rehoboth Carpenter family&#x27;s descendants number in the tens of thousands, among whom are two U.S. presidents and a Project Mercury astronaut. William Carpenter [Jr.] married at Shalbourne in 1625 Abigail Briant, whose family had resided in the parish since at least the late 16th century.
*Jethro Tull (1674–1741), agricultural pioneer, from 1709 owned Prosperous farm, close to the northeast boundary of the present parish.
*Marguerite de Beaumont (1899–1989), founding member of Girl Guides, biographer of Lord Baden-Powell, and recipient of the Silver Fish Award, Girl Guiding&#x27;s highest adult honour.

<doc id="1115749" wikidata="Q727436" url="?curid=1115749" title="Lesch–Nyhan syndrome">
<text>Lesch–Nyhan syndrome (LNS) is a rare inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT). This deficiency occurs due to mutations in the &quot;HPRT1&quot; gene located on the X chromosome. LNS affects about 1 in 380,000 live births. The disorder was first recognized and clinically characterized by American medical student Michael Lesch and his mentor, pediatrician William Nyhan, at Johns Hopkins.

The HGPRT deficiency causes a build-up of uric acid in all body fluids. The combination of increased synthesis and decreased utilization of purines leads to high levels of uric acid production. This results in both high levels of uric acid in the blood and urine, associated with severe gout and kidney problems. Neurological signs include poor muscle control and moderate intellectual disability. These complications usually appear in the first year of life. Beginning in the second year of life, a particularly striking feature of LNS is self-mutilating behaviors, characterized by lip and finger biting. Neurological symptoms include facial grimacing, involuntary writhing, and repetitive movements of the arms and legs similar to those seen in Huntington&#x27;s disease. The cause of the neurological abnormalities remains unknown. Because a lack of HGPRT causes the body to poorly utilize vitamin B12, some males may develop megaloblastic anemia.

LNS is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner; the gene mutation is usually carried by the mother and passed on to her son, although one-third of all cases arise &quot;de novo&quot; (from new mutations) and do not have a family history. LNS is present at birth in baby boys. Most, but not all, persons with this deficiency have severe mental and physical problems throughout life. Cases in females are very rare.

The symptoms caused by the buildup of uric acid (gout and kidney symptoms) respond well to treatment with medications such as allopurinol that reduce the levels of uric acid in the blood. The mental deficits and self-mutilating behavior do not respond well to treatment. There is no cure, but many affected people live to adulthood. Several new experimental treatments may alleviate symptoms.

==Signs and symptoms==
LNS is characterized by three major hallmarks: neurologic dysfunction, cognitive and behavioral disturbances including self-mutilation, and uric acid overproduction (hyperuricemia). Damage to the basal ganglia causes affected individuals to adopt a characteristic fencing stance due to the nature of the lesion. Some may also have macrocytic anemia due to the faulty DNA synthesis, most likely due to deficient purine synthesis that leads to a lag of cell division with respect to increases in cell mass. Virtually all patients are male; males experience delayed growth and puberty, and most develop shrunken testicles or testicular atrophy. Female carriers are at an increased risk for gouty arthritis but are usually otherwise unaffected.

===Overproduction of uric acid===
One of the first symptoms of the disease is the presence of sand-like crystals of uric acid in the diapers of the affected infant. Overproduction of uric acid may lead to the development of uric acid crystals or stones in the kidneys, ureters, or bladder. Such crystals deposited in joints later in the disease may produce gout-like arthritis, with swelling and tenderness. The overproduction of uric acid is present at birth, but may not be recognized by routine clinical laboratory testing methods. The serum uric acid concentration is often normal, as the excess purines are promptly eliminated in the urine. The crystals usually appear as an orange grainy material, or they may coalesce to form either multiple tiny stones or distinct large stones that are difficult to pass. The stones, or calculi, usually cause hematuria (blood in the urine) and increase the risk of urinary tract infection. Some affected people have kidney damage due to such kidney stones. Stones may be the presenting feature of the disease, but can go undetected for months or even years. 

===Nervous system impairment===
The periods before and surrounding birth are typically normal in individuals with LNS. The most common presenting features are abnormally decreased muscle tone (hypotonia) and developmental delay, which are evident by three to six months of age. Affected individuals are late in sitting up, while most never crawl or walk.

Irritability is most often noticed along with the first signs of nervous system impairment. Within the first few years of life, extrapyramidal involvement causes abnormal involuntary muscle contractions such as loss of motor control (dystonia), writhing motions (choreoathetosis), and arching of the spine (opisthotonus). Signs of pyramidal system involvement, including spasticity, overactive reflexes (hyperreflexia) and extensor plantar reflexes, also occur. The resemblance to athetoid cerebral palsy is apparent in the neurologic aspects of LNS. As a result, most individuals are initially diagnosed as having cerebral palsy. The motor disability is so extensive that most individuals never walk, and become lifelong wheelchair users.

===Self-injuring behavior===
Persons affected are cognitively impaired and have behavioral disturbances that emerge between two and three years of age. The uncontrollable self-injury associated with LNS also usually begins at three years of age. The self-injury begins with biting of the lips and tongue; as the disease progresses, affected individuals frequently develop finger biting and headbanging. The self-injury can increase during times of stress. Self-harm is a distinguishing characteristic of the disease and is apparent in 85% of affected males.

The majority of individuals are cognitively impaired, which is sometimes difficult to distinguish from other symptoms because of the behavioral disturbances and motor deficits associated with the syndrome. In many ways, the behaviors may be seen as a psychological extension of the compulsion to cause self-injury, and include rejecting desired treats or travel, repaying kindness with coldness or rage, failing to answer test questions correctly despite study and a desire to succeed, and provoking anger from caregivers when affection is desired.

Compulsive behaviors also occur, including aggressiveness, vomiting, spitting, and coprolalia (involuntary swearing). The development of this type of behavior is sometimes seen within the first year, or in early childhood, but others may not develop it until later in life.

=== LNS in females ===
While carrier females are generally an asymptomatic condition, they do experience an increase in uric acid excretion, and some may develop symptoms of hyperuricemia, and experience gout in their later years. Testing in this context has no clinical consequence, but it may reveal the possibility of transmitting the trait to male children. Women may also require testing if a male child develops LNS. In this instance, a negative test means the son&#x27;s disease is the result of a new mutation, and the risk in siblings is not increased.

Females who carry one copy of the defective gene are carriers with a 50% chance of passing the disease on to their sons. In order for a female to be affected, she would need to have two copies of the mutated gene, one of which would be inherited from her father. Males affected with LNS do not usually have children due to the debilitating effects of the disease. It is possible for a female to inherit an X chromosome from her unaffected father, who carries a new mutation of the HGPRT gene. Under these circumstances, a girl could be born with LNS, and though there are a few reports of this happening, it is very rare. The overwhelming majority of patients with LNS are male.

===Less severe forms===
A less severe, related disease, partial HPRT deficiency, is known as Kelley–Seegmiller syndrome (Lesch–Nyhan syndrome involves total HPRT deficiency). Symptoms generally involve less neurological involvement but the disease still causes gout and kidney stones.

==Genetics==
LNS is due to mutations in the &quot;HPRT1&quot; gene, so named because it codes for the enzyme hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT or HGPRT, ). This enzyme is involved in the biochemical pathways the body uses to produce purines, one of the components of DNA and RNA. Defects of this enzyme lead to increased production of uric acid. Since the &quot;HPRT&quot; gene is located on the X chromosome, LNS is an X-linked inherited disease.

The father of an affected male will not be the carrier of the mutant allele, and will not have the disease. An obligate carrier would be a woman who has an affected son and one other affected relative in the maternal line.

If a woman is the first in her family with an affected son, Haldane&#x27;s rule predicts a 2/3 chance that she is a carrier and a 1/3 chance that the son has a new germline mutation.

The risk to siblings of an affected individual depends upon the carrier status of the mother herself. A 50% chance is given to any female who is a carrier to transmit the HPRT1 mutation in each pregnancy. Sons who inherit the mutation will be affected while daughters who inherit the mutation are carriers. Therefore, with each pregnancy, a carrier female has a 25% chance of having a male that is affected, a 25% chance of having a female that is a carrier, and a 50% chance of having a normal male or female.

Males with LNS generally do not reproduce due to the characteristics of the disease. However, if a male with a less severe phenotype reproduces, all of his daughters are carriers, and none of his sons will be affected.

==Pathophysiology==

As in other X-linked diseases, males are affected because they only have one copy of the X chromosome. In Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, the defective gene is that for hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HGPRT), a participant in the &#x27;recycling&#x27; of purine nucleotides. Female carriers have a second X chromosome, which contains a &quot;normal&quot; copy of HPRT, preventing the disease from developing, though they may have increased risk of hyperuricemia.

A large number of mutations of HPRT are known. Mutations that only mildly decrease the enzyme&#x27;s function do not normally cause the severe form of LNS, but do produce a milder form of the disease which still features purine overproduction accompanied by susceptibility to gout and uric acid nephrolithiasis.

Formation of DNA (during cell division) requires nucleotides, molecules that are the building blocks for DNA. The purine bases (adenine and guanine) and pyrimidine bases (thymine and cytosine) are bound to deoxyribose and phosphate and incorporated as necessary. Normally, the nucleotides are synthesized &quot;de novo&quot; from amino acids and other precursors. A small part, however, is &#x27;recycled&#x27; from degraded DNA of broken-down cells. This is termed the &quot;salvage pathway&quot;.

HGPRT is the &quot;salvage enzyme&quot; for the purines: it channels hypoxanthine and guanine back into DNA synthesis. Failure of this enzyme has two results:
* Cell breakdown products cannot be reused, and are therefore degraded. This gives rise to increased uric acid, a purine breakdown product.
* The &quot;de novo&quot; pathway is stimulated due to an excess of PRPP (5-phospho-D-ribosyl-1-pyrophosphate or simply phosphoribosyl-pyrophosphate).

It was previously unclear whether the neurological abnormalities in LNS were due to uric acid neurotoxicity or to a relative shortage in &quot;new&quot; purine nucleotides during essential synthesis steps. Genetic mutations affecting the enzymes of the &quot;de novo&quot; synthesis pathway may possibly contribute to the disease, although these are rare or unknown. Uric acid has been suggested as a possible cause of neurotoxicity but this is unproven.

Importantly, evidence suggests that one or more lesions in striatal dopaminergic pathways may be central to the neurological deficits, especially the choreoathetoid dyskinesia and self-mutilation. 6-hydroxydopamine toxicity in rodents may be a useful animal model for the syndrome, although this is not proven.
However, the link between dopamine and purine synthesis is a nucleotide called guanosine triphosphate or &#x27;GTP&#x27;. The first step of dopamine synthesis is GTP cyclohydrolase, and significantly a deficiency of this step produces a syndrome that has a neuropathology similar to LNS. Thus a lack of HGPRT may produce a &quot;nucleotide deficiency&quot; (specifically: GTP deficiency) disorder, resulting in dopamine deficiency.

Another animal model for LNS has been proposed to arise from oxidative damage, caused by the hyperuricemia accompanying LNS. This is based on the theory that uric acid is a powerful reducing agent and likely an important human antioxidant, in high concentration in blood. Thus, it has been suggested that free radicals, oxidative stress, and reactive oxygen species may play some role in the neuropathology of LNS.

However, some evidence suggests against a role for uric acid in the neuropathology of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome:
* Hyperuricemia associated with classic primary gout, which is caused by low uric acid renal clearance rather than uric acid overproduction, is not associated with neuropathology.
* Hypouricemia occurs in a number of purine disorders, in particular xanthinuria. Despite having complete absence of blood uric acid, xanthinuria patients do not have any neuropathology, nor any other disease states – other than the kidney stones caused by accumulation of insoluble xanthine in lieu of uric acid.
Similarly, uric acid does not penetrate the blood–brain barrier well. However, oxidative stress due to uric acid is now thought to figure in metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, and stroke, all syndromes associated with high uric acid levels. Similarly, Superoxide dismutase ( &quot;SOD&quot; ) and SOD-mimetics such as TEMPOL ameliorate the effects of hyperuricemia. Likewise, 6-hydroxydopamine (the putative animal model for Lesch–Nyhan&#x27;s neuropathy) apparently acts as a neurotoxin by generation of reactive oxygen species. It may be that oxidative stress induced by some other oxypurine such as xanthine causes the disease.

==Diagnosis==
When an affected individual has fully developed the three clinical elements of uric acid overproduction, neurologic dysfunction, and cognitive and behavioral disturbances, diagnosis of LNS is easily made. Diagnosis is less easy in the early stages, when the three features are not yet obvious. Signs of self-injurious behavior (SIB), results of pedigree analysis and novel molecular biology with genetic testing (called as Diagnostic triad for LNS), often confirms the diagnosis. Suspicion often comes about when the developmental delay of the individual is associated with hyperuricemia. Otherwise, the diagnosis should be alleged when developmental delay is associated with kidney stones (nephrolithiasis) or blood in the urine (hematuria), caused by uric acid stones. For the most part, Lesch–Nyhan syndrome is first suspected when self-inflicted injury behavior develops. However, self-injurious behaviors occur in other conditions, including nonspecific intellectual disability, autism, Rett syndrome, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Tourette syndrome, familial dysautonomia, choreoacanthocytosis, sensory neuropathy including hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1, and several psychiatric conditions. Of these, only individuals with Lesch–Nyhan syndrome, de Lange syndrome, and familial dysautonomia recurrently display loss of tissue as a consequence. Biting the fingers and lips is a definitive feature of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome; in other syndromes associated with self-injury, the behaviors usually consist of head banging and nonspecific self-mutilation, but not biting of the cheeks, lips and fingers. Lesch–Nyhan syndrome ought to be clearly considered only when self-injurious behavior takes place in conjunction with hyperuricemia and neurological dysfunction.

===Diagnostic approach===
The urate to creatinine (breakdown product of creatine phosphate in muscle) concentration ratio in urine is elevated. This is a good indicator of acid overproduction. For children under ten years of age with LNS, a urate to creatinine ratio above two is typically found. Twenty-four-hour urate excretion of more than 20 mg/kg is also typical but is not diagnostic. Hyperuricemia (serum uric acid concentration of &gt;8 mg/dL) is often present but not reliable enough for diagnosis. Activity of the HGPRT enzyme in cells from any type of tissue (e.g., blood, cultured fibroblasts, or lymphoblasts) that is less than 1.5% of normal enzyme activity confirms the diagnosis of Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. Molecular genetic studies of the HPRT gene mutations may confirm diagnosis, and are particularly helpful for subsequent &#x27;carrier testing&#x27; in at-risk females such as close family relatives on the female side.

===Testing===
The use of biochemical testing for the detection of carriers is technically demanding and not often used. Biochemical analyses that have been performed on hair bulbs from at risk women have had a small number of both false positive and false negative outcomes. If only a suspected carrier female is available for mutation testing, it may be appropriate to grow her lymphocytes in 6-thioguanine (a purine analogue), which allows only HGPRT-deficient cells to survive. A mutant frequency of 0.5–5.0 × 10−2 is found in carrier females, while a non-carrier female has a frequency of 1–20 × 10−6. This frequency is usually diagnostic by itself.

Molecular genetic testing is the most effective method of testing, as HPRT1 is the only gene known to be associated with LNS. Individuals who display the full Lesch–Nyhan phenotype all have mutations in the HPRT1 gene. Sequence analysis of mRNA is available clinically and can be utilized in order to detect HPRT1 mutations in males affected with Lesch–Nyhan syndrome. Techniques such as RT-PCR, multiplex genomic PCR, and sequence analysis (cDNA and genomic DNA), used for the diagnosis of genetic diseases, are performed on a research basis. If RT-PCR tests result in cDNA showing the absence of an entire exon or exons, then multiplex genomic PCR testing is performed. Multiplex genomic PCR testing amplifies the nine exons of the HPRT1 gene as eight PCR products. If the exon in question is deleted, the corresponding band will be missing from the multiplex PCR. However, if the exon is present, the exon is sequenced to identify the mutation, therefore causing exclusion of the exon from cDNA. If no cDNA is created by RT-PCR, then multiplex PCR is performed on the notion that most or all of the gene is obliterated.

==Treatment==
Treatment for LNS is symptomatic. Gout can be treated with allopurinol to control excessive amounts of uric acid. Kidney stones may be treated with lithotripsy, a technique for breaking up kidney stones using shock waves or laser beams. There is no standard treatment for the neurological symptoms of LNS. Some may be relieved with the drugs carbidopa/levodopa, diazepam, phenobarbital, or haloperidol.

It is essential that the overproduction of uric acid be controlled in order to reduce the risk of nephropathy, nephrolithiasis, and gouty arthritis. The drug allopurinol is utilized to stop the conversion of oxypurines into uric acid, and prevent the development of subsequent arthritic tophi (produced after having chronic gout), kidney stones, and nephropathy, the resulting kidney disease. Allopurinol is taken orally, at a typical dose of 3–20 mg/kg per day. The dose is then adjusted to bring the uric acid level down into the normal range (&lt;3 mg/dL). Most affected individuals can be treated with allopurinol all through life.

No medication is effective in controlling the extrapyramidal motor features of the disease. Spasticity, however, can be reduced by the administration of baclofen or benzodiazepines.

There has previously been no effective method of treatment for the neurobehavioral aspects of the disease. Even children treated from birth with allopurinol develop behavioral and neurologic problems, despite never having had high serum concentrations of uric acid. Self-injurious and other behaviors are best managed by a combination of medical, physical, and behavioral interventions. The self-mutilation is often reduced by using restraints. Sixty percent of individuals have their teeth extracted in order to avoid self-injury, which families have found to be an effective management technique. Because stress increases self-injury, behavioral management through aversive techniques (which would normally reduce self-injury) actually increases self-injury in individuals with LNS. Nearly all affected individuals need restraints to prevent self-injury, and are restrained more than 75% of the time. This is often at their own request, and occasionally involves restraints that would appear to be ineffective, as they do not physically prevent biting. Families report that affected individuals are more at ease when restrained.

The Matheny Medical and Educational Center Matheny | A Non-profit Organization for People with Special Needs in Peapack, NJ, has six Lesch–Nyhan syndrome patients, believed to be the largest concentration of LNS cases in one location, and is recognized as the leading source of information on care issues.

Treatment for LNS patients, according to Gary E. Eddey, MD, medical director, should include: 1) Judicious use of protective devices; 2) Utilization of a behavioral technique commonly referred to as &#x27;selective ignoring&#x27; with redirection of activities; and 3) Occasional use of medications.

An article in the August 13, 2007 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine, written by Richard Preston, discusses &quot;deep-brain stimulation&quot; as a possible treatment. It has been performed on a few patients with Lesch–Nyhan syndrome by Dr. Takaomi Taira in Tokyo and by a group in France led by Dr. Philippe Coubes. Some patients experienced a decrease in spastic self-injurious symptoms. The technique was developed for treating people with Parkinson&#x27;s disease, according to Preston, over 20 years ago. The treatment involves invasive surgery to place wires that carry a continuous electric current into a specific region of the brain.

An encouraging advance in the treatment of the neurobehavioural aspects of LNS was the publication in the October, 2006 issue of &quot;Journal of Inherited Metabolic Disease&quot; of an experimental therapy giving oral S-adenosyl-methionine (SAMe).
This drug is a nucleotide precursor that provides a readily absorbed purine, which is known to be transported across the blood–brain barrier. Administration of SAMe to adult LNS patients was shown to provide improvement in neurobehavioural and other neurological attributes. The drug is available without prescription and has been widely used for depression, but its use for treating LNS should be undertaken only under strict medical supervision, as side effects are known.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis for individuals with severe LNS is poor. Death is usually due to kidney failure or complications from hypotonia, in the first or second decade of life. Less severe forms have better prognosis.

==History==
Michael Lesch was a medical student at Johns Hopkins and William Nyhan, a pediatrician and biochemical geneticist, was his mentor when the two identified LNS and its associated hyperuricemia in two affected brothers, ages 4 and 8. Lesch and Nyhan published their findings in 1964. Within three years, the metabolic cause was identified by J. Edwin Seegmiller and his colleagues at the NIH.

<text>The Maurice J. Tobin Memorial Bridge (formerly the Mystic River Bridge) is a cantilever truss bridge that spans more than from Boston to Chelsea over the Mystic River in Massachusetts, United States. The bridge is the largest in New England. It is operated by the Massachusetts Department of Transportation and carries U.S. Route 1. It was built between 1948 and 1950 and opened to traffic on February 2, 1950, replacing the former Chelsea Bridge. The -wide roadway has three lanes of traffic on each of the two levels with northbound traffic on the lower level and southbound traffic on the upper level.

==Description==
The bridge is a three-span cantilevered truss bridge at in total length. The center span is longest at and the maximum truss height is . There are 36 approach spans to the north and 32 to the south. The roadway is seven lanes wide between the shortest () span and the center to accommodate the now-unused toll plaza. The northbound toll plaza was closed in the 1980s; the southbound toll plaza was closed on July 21, 2014. and replaced by open tolling or pay by license plate.

==History==
===Chelsea Bridge===
Early transport between Boston and Winnisimmet (later Chelsea) was by the Winnisimmet Ferry. In 1803, the Salem Turnpike was extended across the Mystic River to Charlestown, where the Charles River Bridge then connected to downtown Boston. The new Mystic River bridge (Chelsea Bridge) had two draw spans and cost $53,000 () to construct. The Boston and Chelsea Railroad opened a single horsecar track over the bridge on November 20, 1858. The toll was dropped on November 9, 1869, when the bridge and turnpike became state property. The Boston portion of the bridge was rebuilt in 1877, with a new iron draw span, while the Chelsea portion was also repaired. The Lynn and Boston Railroad (successor to the Boston and Chelsea Railroad) ran a pair of horsecar tracks across the bridge.

In 1880, Chelsea paid Boston $25,000 () to permanently maintain the portion of the bridge within Chelsea, including the north draw. The Boston portion was damaged by a fire on September 7, 1887. Electric streetcars replaced the horsecars on the bridge in the early 1890s, with all-electric service effective March 13, 1893.

====Charlestown viaduct====

The Boston and Lowell Railroad (B&amp;L) purchased the Mystic River Railroad, an unbuilt paper railroad, in 1871. It constructed the line from Milk Row station around Charlestown to a new freight terminal built on filled land in the Mystic River between the two channels. After a legal battle with the Lynn and Boston Railroad about the right to cross its tracks, the B&amp;L extended the branch across the Mystic Bridge, allowing ships to dock without passing through any bridges. As the B&amp;L and its successor Boston and Maine Railroad (B&amp;M) expanded Mystic Wharf in the 1880s, replacing the middle section of the bridge with a roadway on filled land, the grade crossings became a significant inconvenience and hazard to bridge traffic.

The railroad&#x27;s construction of transatlantic port facilities, including a grain elevator and coal depot, along with additional crossings of the bridge road brought the issue to a head in 1892. That June, the state legislature passed an act authorizing Chelsea to pursue elimination of the grade crossings. The B&amp;M was to pay 65% of the cost, the Lynn and Boston Railroad 5%, and the state 30% (of which part would be in turn paid by Boston and Chelsea). Negotiations between the B&amp;M, the Lynn and Boston, and the cities of Boston and Chelsea took place in 1893 over plans to raise the street onto a viaduct over the rail yard. The B&amp;M was willing to build a viaduct with a wooden roadway wide, but the other parties insisted on a -wide roadway with a granite deck.

A temporary south span and roadway opened on May 1, 1894, allowing construction of the viaduct to begin. This was closed to all but streetcar traffic on May 1, 1895. Streetcars began using the new viaduct on August 4, 1895, and it opened to general traffic on December 29. The viaduct was long and raised about above the old grade, with a -wide roadway and -wide sidewalk. Masonry piers spaced apart supported the iron viaduct, which cost $600,000 () to construct. A perpendicular ramp led from the viaduct to the rail yard below. As part of the project, the north draw span was replaced by a retractile drawbridge and widened by to just under .

====Draw span replacements====
As the New England Gas and Coke Company prepared to open its new plant upstream, a further widening of the north draw became necessary to accommodate Dominion Steel and Coal Corporation ships serving the plant. Henry Melville Whitney offered to pay $40,000 on behalf of the company to secure a width of ; however, the city instead chose a width. Preliminary work began in late 1899. A temporary bridge was funded by the gas company ($14,000) and the Lynn and Boston ($7,000). A contract for $21,471 for the construction of the new draw span was issued on February 26, 1900. The new span opened on September 25, 1900, with a total cost around $75,000 ()

Another replacement of the north draw span began in early 1912, with the temporary bridge completed that August. The new steel truss swing span – claimed to be the largest bridge span in New England – opened on May 28, 1913. The span rotated on 64 wheels on a diameter circular rail. It was long and wide, and could rotate to provide two -wide channels large enough for oceangoing ships. As part of the $425,000 project (), the wooden pile approaches were raised to eliminate a slope from the Charlestown viaduct.

The city planned to replace the south draw span shortly afterwards at a nearly equal cost. On March 14, 1914, the temporary span from the north draw was moved in one piece – using the tide to lift the span on lighters – to serve as the new temporary south draw. The temporary span, with sharp reverse curves at both ends, remained in use longer than planned. A $521,830 contract for the permanent span () was issued on April 26, 1922, and construction began on May 2. The new bridge opened on April 21, 1924. It was long, with a four-leaf bascule draw long and wide, widening the channel to .

By early 1934, the north section of Chelsea Bridge was in need of repairs. On June 27, 1934, traffic on the north draw was restricted to vehicles under except for streetcars, using only one lane in each direction. The century-old drawtenders&#x27; house nearly collapsed into the river on July 23, 1934, as piles supporting it sank into the riverbed. A $292,222 contract () for repairs to the north span was issued on October 26, 1934. The bridge closed to all traffic effective January 14, 1935. Initial plans had called for streetcar service by the Eastern Massachusetts Street Railway (successor to the Lynn and Boston) to be maintained during construction. However, the Eastern Mass instead operated buses between Chelsea Square and Haymarket Square via the Meridian Street Bridge and the newly opened Sumner Tunnel under a permit issued just two days prior. The bridge reopened on December 23, 1935, without streetcar tracks; the Eastern Mass continued its bus operations. The Boston Elevated Railway began Chelsea Square– bus service over the bridge on July 2, 1936.

===Construction and financing===
The new bridge was originally operated by the Mystic River Bridge Authority. The bridge, according to the statute enacted May 23, 1946, would be turned over to the Massachusetts Department of Public Works once the $27 million in bonds used to finance the bridge&#x27;s construction was retired. The bridge would then become part of the state highway system to be maintained and operated by the department free of tolls. Operation of the bridge was turned over to the new Massachusetts Port Authority in 1956.

The Chelsea Bridge originally remained intact; the southern section remained open as truck access to Mystic Wharf, while the northern section was closed to traffic but still carried a water main across the Mystic River. State funding for a replacement water tunnel was approved in August 1950. On January 28, 1951, six people in a wedding party died when they drove onto the Charlestown end of the closed bridge and fell into the river at the open north draw. The north draw and the north section of the viaduct were removed in 1954. A new street, Terminal Street, opened on August 21, 1956, to serve the Mystic Wharf; the old south draw was closed at that time and soon removed. A new fixed bridge was built near the alignment of the former south draw in 1982 as part of a project to remove trucks from neighborhood streets in Charlestown. It provides only clearance above the water, as the only vessels using the Little Mystic Channel were recreational boats using a 1970s-built boat ramp.

===Later events===

In 1967, the Mystic River Bridge was renamed in honor of Maurice J. Tobin, former Boston mayor and Massachusetts governor. Construction of the bridge began during his term as governor (1945–1947). Tobin went on to serve as Secretary of Labor under President Harry Truman before he died in 1953. Instead of eliminating the tolls, the southbound tolls were increased to 25 cents to cover the closing of the Northbound toll plaza in the 1980s. Starting in the early 1990s the tolls increased sharply to help pay for the Big Dig.

Legislation was passed to transfer the bridge from Massport to the new Massachusetts Department of Transportation, effective January 1, 2010. On the morning of July 21, 2014, the bridge&#x27;s tollbooths were closed and eventually removed for an all-electronic and cashless tolling system, and from that point on all toll charges are paid for via either E-ZPass at the current rate, or &quot;pay-by-mail&quot; where an invoice will be sent to motorists’ homes via license plate number recognition at the former cash toll rate. This inaugurated a 2½ year process by MassDOT which converted all of the toll roads and bridges throughout the Commonwealth to automatic open road tolling. In 2016, the $2.50 southbound toll was replaced with $1.25 tolls in both directions, with a 30-cent surcharge for pay-by-mail.

In September 2017, the Massachusetts Department of Transportation announced a three-year $41.6 million project to restore the bridge deck, repair steel, and paint a portion of the bridge. The work ran April through November in 2018, 2019, and 2020.

==Incidents==
The current bridge has not been spared having numerous incidents during its 50 plus year lifespan. In 1973, a gravel truck traveling over the lower deck crashed into a support, collapsing the upper deck onto the truck and killing the driver. Later that year, the bridge reopened after more than two months of repair. On January 4, 1990, racial hoaxer and double murderer Charles Stuart committed suicide by jumping from the bridge. Suicides and attempted suicides have been an issue for authorities in general as the design and weight of the bridge makes it impossible to add suicide prevention devices. MassDOT employees are thus trained to monitor security cameras and watch for any vehicles that stop on the bridge for whatever reason.

<doc id="1115761" wikidata="Q376267" url="?curid=1115761" title="Eddie Johnson (American soccer)">
<text>Edward Abraham Johnson (born March 31, 1984) is an American former soccer player. He played the majority of his fourteen-year club career in the U.S. with FC Dallas, the Kansas City Wizards, Seattle Sounders FC, and D.C. United. Johnson also spent three and a half years with several European clubs.

Johnson also played for the United States men&#x27;s national soccer team from 2004 to 2014, and was part of the U.S. squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup. At the time of his retirement, Johnson ranked eighth on the list of goal-scorers with 19 goals for the U.S. national team.

==Professional==

===Youth career===
Johnson became one of the youngest players to sign with Major League Soccer, and was drafted by Dallas Burn as a Project-40 player in the second round of the 2001 MLS SuperDraft. In his first three years in the league, he did not get much playing time, and was very inconsistent when he did get on the field. Johnson scored just seven goals for Dallas in those seasons, while missing time with U.S. youth national teams.

In January 2005, Benfica offered what would have been an MLS-record $5 million transfer fee for Johnson, but Johnson and the league both rejected the offer.

In May 2005, Johnson suffered an injury to the toes of his right foot that sidelined him until August of that year. After returning to MLS in August – he scored only five goals during the season – Johnson re-injured his toes in mid-September and was sidelined until January 2006.

===Kansas City Wizards===
With Dallas in salary cap trouble, Johnson was traded to the Kansas City Wizards on February 14, 2006, for two allocations.
It was announced that Johnson would be training with Premier League club Reading during the MLS offseason, but he did not sign with the club.

In 2006 and early 2007, Johnson suffered a decline in form, scoring only twice in the 2006 MLS season and failing to make an impact with the national team. However, Johnson returned to form with the start of the 2007 MLS season, notching twelve goals and three assists in his first eleven games. On June 2, 2007, Johnson became the first player ever to score back to back hat-tricks in MLS play when he scored three goals against the New York Red Bulls, following a three-goal performance against the New England Revolution the previous week on May 26.

===Premier League and Fulham===

In July 2007, Johnson saw increased speculation over a transfer to the Premier League. Derby County had been most vocal, with Derby manager Billy Davies confirming that he would explore the U.S. market. However, after MLS accepted a $6 million bid from Derby, Johnson reportedly nixed the deal as he preferred to finish his season in Kansas City. Johnson revealed his contract is structured to give him final say over whether he is purchased by fifteen designated clubs. Johnson left the national team camp in California on January 17, 2008; he completed a transfer to Fulham on January 23, 2008, signing a contract extending until the summer of 2011.

===Loan to Cardiff City===
He joined Championship side Cardiff City on loan for the 2008–09 season in August, making his debut for the club during a 2–1 victory over Milton Keynes Dons in the Football League Cup. He went on to make his league debut four days later as an eighty-fifth-minute substitute in a 0–0 draw with Sheffield United. He struggled to recover his goal-scoring form that he showed during his time in MLS.

However, he regained some of his form as the season progressed, and had a breakthrough week when he scored his first goal in English soccer on March 7, 2009, in a 3–0 victory against Doncaster Rovers. Four days later Johnson was named man of the match for his performance in Cardiff&#x27;s 3–1 victory over Barnsley. A month later, when Cardiff hosted Derby County, Johnson scored his second goal of the season and added an own goal during injury time as the Bluebirds rolled to a 4–1 victory. Johnson&#x27;s goal for Cardiff also meant that he was the last Cardiff City goalscorer under the Ninian Park floodlights.

Johnson returned to Fulham from Cardiff City for the 2009–10 season. He featured in the majority of Fulham&#x27;s pre-season fixtures, scoring in a friendly at Australian club Melbourne Victory, was on the bench for Fulham&#x27;s 3–0 victory over Vetra in the first leg of the third round of the Europa League, and came on as a late substitute in and recorded an assist in Fulham&#x27;s 3–0 win in the second leg against Vetra.

===Greece and loan to Aris===
On December 31, 2009, Johnson joined Greek side Aris Thessaloniki on loan for the remainder of the 2009–10 season. On January 13, 2010, Johnson made his first appearance for Aris, coming on as a 79th-minute substitute in a 2–0 victory over Asteras Tripoli F.C. in the round of 16 of the Greek Cup. He made his Greek Super League debut, appearing as a second-half substitute against PAS Giannina F.C., on January 17, 2010. Johnson scored two goals in their playoff win over Olympiacos. Johnson scored five goals for Aris and was one of the top goalscorers in the Greek Super League Playoff with three goals.

===Loan to Preston===
On January 31, 2011, Johnson was sent out on loan to Championship club Preston North End. He scored his first goal against Reading a flicked on header from a curling Keith Treacy cross. The goal was later given as an own goal.

On December 22, 2011, it was announced that Johnson had signed with Primera División de Mexico club Puebla. However, Johnson never officially signed a contract with the team and was released from camp after training with the team three or four times due to a difference in opinions between the coach, Juan Carlos Osorio, and the team&#x27;s technical staff.

===Seattle Sounders FC===
Johnson signed with MLS on February 17, 2012, and was selected on February 18, 2012, by Montreal Impact via allocation process. He was immediately traded to Seattle Sounders FC in exchange for Mike Fucito and Lamar Neagle. He scored his first two goals for the Sounders in games against the Chicago Fire and the LA Galaxy. He was selected to the 2012 MLS All Star Team by coach Ben Olsen, eventually scoring the game-winning goal against Chelsea in a 3–2 victory. During the 2012 season, Johnson was selected as MLS Player of the Week two times. The first time in week 22, following a one-goal performance in a 4–0 win over the Los Angeles Galaxy. He received the honor a second time in week 27, following his two-goal showing in a 2–1 comeback victory against Chivas USA.

Johnson led the Sounders in goals scored during the 2012 MLS season, netting 14 total and finishing sixth in the league&#x27;s Golden Boot race. Of the 14 total goals scored by Johnson, 9 came from headers, which led all players in MLS.

For his quality performance throughout the season, Johnson was named &quot;Comeback Player of the Year&quot; in MLS for the 2012 season. MLS Commissioner Don Garber said of Johnson receiving the award: &quot;Eddie Johnson had a great resurgence with Seattle. Eddie joined our league when he was 17 years old and had one of his best years with us at 28. I still think he has a number of good years left in him.&quot; It was the second time Johnson received the award, previously winning in 2007 as a player with Kansas City.

Johnson scored the winning goal for the Sounders against Tigres de la UANL in the quarterfinal of the 2013 CONCACAF Champions League knockout stage. The 75th-minute goal put the Sounders ahead 3–2 on aggregate, and advanced the club to the semi-finals of the tournament. With the Sounders victory over Tigres, they became the first MLS side to eliminate a Mexican club in the history of the CONCACAF Champions League.

Towards the end of the 2013 MLS season, Johnson openly made pleas for an improved contract. Salary cap issues prevented Seattle from offering this, and so Johnson was cut from the team with the intention of his rights been traded.

===D.C. United===
Johnson was traded to D.C. United in exchange for allocation money on December 17, 2013.
On May 17, 2014, Johnson scored his first goal for D.C. United in the 84th minute against the Montreal Impact.
In March 2015, after an extended medical leave, it was reported that Johnson might need to retire due to a heart condition. On November 1, 2015, Johnson formally announced his retirement due to a diagnosed heart ailment.

==International==

Johnson had success at the U-17 level, scoring 23 goals in 25 appearances and leading that team in scoring in both 2000 and 2001. This success continued at U-20 level, and in 2003 at the FIFA World Youth Championship in the United Arab Emirates he scored four goals, three from the penalty spot, and notched one assist to win the tournament&#x27;s Golden Shoe as the top scorer.

Johnson received his first cap and scored his first goal for the senior United States team against El Salvador on October 9, 2004, becoming one of a small group of American players to get his first international goal in a World Cup qualifier. He then scored a hat-trick in his second appearance four days later, all within a seventeen-minute spree against Panama. On March 30, 2005, Johnson scored the game-winning goal in another qualifying match against Guatemala. He totaled seven goals in his first six World Cup qualifiers which placed him third on the U.S. all-time scoring list in World Cup qualifiers.
Johnson appeared in two matches at the 2006 FIFA World Cup and also participated in the 2007 Copa América as well the 2007 Gold Cup. In the U.S.&#x27;s opening Copa América match against Argentina he earned and then converted a penalty kick to put the United States ahead 1–0 in a game they eventually lost 4–1.

On May 11, 2010, Johnson was named to the United States pre-2010 FIFA World Cup roster; he was ultimately cut before the team traveled to South Africa.

Johnson returned to the U.S. team for the 2014 World Cup qualifiers against Antigua and Barbuda and Guatemala. He scored both goals in the 2–1 victory over Antigua and Barbuda, with the winner coming in the 90th minute. He also assisted on Clint Dempsey&#x27;s game-winning goal versus Guatemala.

Johnson scored the second goal for the United States against Panama during the World Cup Qualifying match held in Seattle, Washington on June 11, 2013. The goal was scored at CenturyLink Field, the home stadium of his pro club, Seattle Sounders FC. Johnson said of the goal, &quot;It&#x27;s a dream come true. To play in the U.S. jersey, first of all, is an honor, but to play in front of my fans that I play in front of week in and week out, I couldn’t have asked for a better feeling after the goal tonight.&quot; Johnson also scored the game winner in the World Cup Qualifier against Mexico in Columbus which qualified the USMNT for Brazil 2014.

==Post-playing career==
Johnson is currently working for his USSF A license and has coached younger Americans such as Christian Pulisic.

==Personal life==
Johnson became a Christian when he was 18. Johnson has spoken about his faith saying, &quot;I began to think positively for the first time in years, and I became more patient. ... God showed me how to make the most of my life, both on and off the field. ... Through Jesus’ example, I have learned to forgive people and not hold grudges like I used to. That&#x27;s the key to the rest of my life: faithfulness, both His and mine. I encourage you to make it the key to the rest of your life as well.

While growing up, Johnson considered Romário as his favorite player and watched him when he was nine-years-old and watched the 1994 World Cup in America. Johnson supports Manchester United.

<doc id="1115768" wikidata="Q338729" url="?curid=1115768" title="Rejection of evolution by religious groups">
<text>Recurring cultural, political, and theological rejection of evolution by religious groups exists regarding the origins of the Earth, of humanity, and of other life. In accordance with creationism, species were once widely believed to be fixed products of divine creation, but since the mid-19th century, evolution by natural selection has been established by the scientific community as an empirical scientific fact.

Any such debate is universally considered religious, not scientific, by professional scientific organizations worldwide: in the scientific community, evolution is accepted as fact, and efforts to sustain the traditional view are universally regarded as pseudoscience. While the controversy has a long history, today it has retreated to be mainly over what constitutes good science education, with the politics of creationism primarily focusing on the teaching of creationism in public education. Among majority-Christian countries, the debate is most prominent in the United States, where it may be portrayed as part of a culture war. Parallel controversies also exist in some other religious communities, such as the more fundamentalist branches of Judaism and Islam. In Europe and elsewhere, creationism is less widespread (notably, the Catholic Church and Anglican Communion both accept evolution), and there is much less pressure to teach it as fact.

Christian fundamentalists reject the evidence of common descent of humans and other animals as demonstrated in modern paleontology, genetics, histology and cladistics and those other sub-disciplines which are based upon the conclusions of modern evolutionary biology, geology, cosmology, and other related fields. They argue for the Abrahamic accounts of creation, and, in order to attempt to gain a place alongside evolutionary biology in the science classroom, have developed a rhetorical framework of &quot;creation science&quot;. In the landmark &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover&quot;, the purported basis of scientific creationism was judged to be a wholly religious construct without scientific merit.

The Catholic Church holds no official position on creation or evolution (see Evolution and the Catholic Church). However, Pope Francis has stated: &quot;God is not a demiurge or a magician, but the Creator who brought everything to life...Evolution in nature is not inconsistent with the notion of creation, because evolution requires the creation of beings that evolve.&quot; The rules of genetic inheritance were discovered by the Augustinian friar Gregor Mendel, who is known today as the founder of modern genetics.

==History==

The creation–evolution controversy began in Europe and North America in the late 18th century, when new interpretations of geological evidence led to various theories of an ancient Earth, and findings of extinctions demonstrated in the fossil geological sequence prompted early ideas of evolution, notably Lamarckism. In England these ideas of continuing change were at first seen as a threat to the existing &quot;fixed&quot; social order, and both church and state sought to repress them. Conditions gradually eased, and in 1844 Robert Chambers&#x27;s controversial &quot;Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation&quot; popularized the idea of gradual transmutation of species. The scientific establishment at first dismissed it scornfully and the Church of England reacted with fury, but many Unitarians, Quakers and Baptists—groups opposed to the privileges of the established church—favoured its ideas of God acting through such natural laws.

===Contemporary reaction to Darwin===


The publication of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859 brought scientific credibility to evolution, and made it a respectable field of study.

Despite the intense interest in the religious implications of Darwin&#x27;s book, theological controversy over higher criticism set out in &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; (1860) largely diverted the Church of England&#x27;s attention. Some of the liberal Christian authors of that work expressed support for Darwin, as did many Nonconformists. The Reverend Charles Kingsley, for instance, openly supported the idea of God working through evolution. Other Christians opposed the idea, and even some of Darwin&#x27;s close friends and supporters—including Charles Lyell and Asa Gray—initially expressed reservations about some of his ideas. Gray later became a staunch supporter of Darwin in America, and collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, &quot;Darwiniana&quot; (1876). These essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, at a time when many on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive. Gray said that investigation of physical causes was not opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it &quot;most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies.&quot; Thomas Huxley, who strongly promoted Darwin&#x27;s ideas while campaigning to end the dominance of science by the clergy, coined the term &quot;agnostic&quot; to describe his position that God&#x27;s existence is unknowable. Darwin also took this position, but prominent atheists including Edward Aveling and Ludwig Büchner also took up evolution and it was criticized, in the words of one reviewer, as &quot;tantamount to atheism.&quot; Following the lead of figures such as St. George Jackson Mivart and John Augustine Zahm, Roman Catholics in the United States became accepting of evolution itself while ambivalent towards natural selection and stressing humanity&#x27;s divinely imbued soul. The Catholic Church never condemned evolution, and initially the more conservative-leaning Catholic leadership in Rome held back, but gradually adopted a similar position.

During the late 19th century evolutionary ideas were most strongly disputed by the premillennialists, who held to a prophecy of the imminent return of Christ based on a form of Biblical literalism, and were convinced that the Bible would be invalidated if any error in the Scriptures was conceded. However, hardly any of the critics of evolution at that time were as concerned about geology, freely granting scientists any time they needed before the Edenic creation to account for scientific observations, such as fossils and geological findings. In the immediate post-Darwinian era, few scientists or clerics rejected the antiquity of the earth or the progressive nature of the fossil record. Likewise, few attached geological significance to the Biblical flood, unlike subsequent creationists. Evolutionary skeptics, creationist leaders and skeptical scientists were usually either willing to adopt a figurative reading of the first chapter of the Book of Genesis, or allowed that the six days of creation were not necessarily 24-hour days.

Science professors at liberal northeastern universities almost immediately embraced the theory of evolution and introduced it to their students. However, some people in parts of the south and west of the United States, who had been influenced by the preachings of Christian fundamentalist evangelicals, rejected the theory as immoral.

In the United Kingdom, Evangelical creationists were in a tiny minority. The Victoria Institute was formed in 1865 in response to &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; and Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;. It was not officially opposed to evolution theory, but its main founder James Reddie objected to Darwin&#x27;s work as &quot;inharmonious&quot; and &quot;utterly &quot;incredible&quot;&quot;, and Philip Henry Gosse, author of &quot;Omphalos&quot;, was a vice-president. The institute&#x27;s membership increased to 1897, then declined sharply. In the 1920s George McCready Price attended and made several presentations of his creationist views, which found little support among the members. In 1927 John Ambrose Fleming was made president; while he insisted on creation of the soul, his acceptance of divinely guided development and of Pre-Adamite humanity meant he was thought of as a theistic evolutionist.

===Creationism in theology===
At the beginning of the 19th century debate had started to develop over applying historical methods to Biblical criticism, suggesting a less literal account of the Bible. Simultaneously, the developing science of geology indicated the Earth was ancient, and religious thinkers sought to accommodate this by day-age creationism or gap creationism. Neptunianist catastrophism, which had in the 17th and 18th centuries proposed that a universal flood could explain all geological features, gave way to ideas of geological gradualism (introduced in 1795 by James Hutton) based upon the erosion and depositional cycle over millions of years, which gave a better explanation of the sedimentary column. Biology and the discovery of extinction (first described in the 1750s and put on a firm footing by Georges Cuvier in 1796) challenged ideas of a fixed immutable Aristotelian &quot;great chain of being.&quot; Natural theology had earlier expected that scientific findings based on empirical evidence would help religious understanding. Emerging differences led some to increasingly regard science and theology as concerned with different, non-competitive domains.

When most scientists came to accept evolution (by around 1875), European theologians generally came to accept evolution as an instrument of God. For instance, Pope Leo XIII (in office 1878–1903) referred to longstanding Christian thought that scriptural interpretations could be reevaluated in the light of new knowledge, and Roman Catholics came around to acceptance of human evolution subject to direct creation of the soul. In the United States the development of the racist Social Darwinian eugenics movement by certain circles led a number of Catholics to reject evolution. In this enterprise they received little aid from conservative Christians in Great Britain and Europe. In Britain this has been attributed to their minority status leading to a more tolerant, less militant theological tradition. This continues to the present. In his speech at the Pontifical Academy of Sciences in 2014, Pope Francis declared that he accepted the Big Bang theory and the theory of evolution and that God was not &quot;a magician with a magic wand&quot;.

====Development of creationism in the United States====

At first in the U.S., evangelical Christians paid little attention to the developments in geology and biology, being more concerned with the rise of European higher Biblical criticism which questioned the belief in the Bible as literal truth. Those criticizing these approaches took the name &quot;fundamentalist&quot;—originally coined by its supporters to describe a specific package of theological beliefs that developed into a movement within the Protestant community of the United States in the early part of the 20th century, and which had its roots in the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s. The term in a religious context generally indicates unwavering attachment to a set of irreducible beliefs.

Up until the early mid-20th century, mainline Christian denominations within the United States showed little official resistance to evolution. Around the start of the 20th century some evangelical scholars had ideas accommodating evolution, such as B. B. Warfield who saw it as a natural law expressing God&#x27;s will. By then most U.S. high-school and college biology classes taught scientific evolution, but several factors, including the rise of Christian fundamentalism and social factors of changes and insecurity in more traditionalist Bible Belt communities, led to a backlash. The numbers of children receiving secondary education increased rapidly, and parents who had fundamentalist tendencies or who opposed social ideas of what was called &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; had real concerns about what their children were learning about evolution.

====British creationism====
The main British creationist movement in this period, the Evolution Protest Movement (EPM), formed in the 1930s out of the Victoria Institute, or Philosophical Society of Great Britain (founded in 1865 in response to the publication of Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot; in 1859 and of &quot;Essays and Reviews&quot; in 1860). The Victoria Institute had the stated objective of defending &quot;the great truths revealed in Holy Scripture ... against the opposition of Science falsely so called&quot;. Although it did not officially oppose evolution, it attracted a number of scientists skeptical of Darwinism, including John William Dawson and Arnold Guyot. It reached a high point of 1,246 members in 1897, but quickly plummeted to less than one third of that figure in the first two decades of the twentieth century. Although it opposed evolution at first, the institute joined the theistic evolution camp by the 1920s, which led to the development of the Evolution Protest Movement in reaction. Amateur ornithologist Douglas Dewar, the main driving-force within the EPM, published a booklet entitled &quot;Man: A Special Creation&quot; (1936) and engaged in public speaking and debates with supporters of evolution. In the late 1930s he resisted American creationists&#x27; call for acceptance of flood geology, which later led to conflict within the organization. Despite trying to win the public endorsement of C. S. Lewis (1898–1963), the most prominent Christian apologist of his day, by the mid-1950s the EPM came under control of schoolmaster/pastor Albert G. Tilney, whose dogmatic and authoritarian style ran the organization &quot;as a one-man band&quot;, rejecting flood geology, unwaveringly promoting gap creationism, and reducing the membership to lethargic inactivity. It was renamed the Creation Science Movement (CSM) in 1980, under the chairmanship of David Rosevear, who holds a Ph.D. in organometallic chemistry from the University of Bristol. By the mid-1980s the CSM had formally incorporated flood geology into its &quot;Deed of Trust&quot; (which all officers had to sign) and condemned gap creationism and day-age creationism as unscriptural.

==United States legal challenges and their consequences==
In 1925 Tennessee passed a statute, the Butler Act, which prohibited the teaching of the theory of evolution in all schools in the state. Later that year Mississippi passed a similar law, as did Arkansas in 1927. In 1968 the Supreme Court of the United States struck down these &quot;anti-monkey&quot; laws as unconstitutional, &quot;because they established a religious doctrine violating both the First and Fourth Amendments to the United States Constitution.&quot;

In more recent times religious fundamentalists who accept creationism have struggled to get their rejection of evolution accepted as legitimate science within education institutions in the U.S. A series of important court cases have resulted.

===Butler Act and the Scopes monkey trial (1925)===
After 1918, in the aftermath of World War I, the Fundamentalist–Modernist controversy had brought a surge of opposition to the idea of evolution, and following the campaigning of William Jennings Bryan several states introduced legislation prohibiting the teaching of evolution. By 1925, such legislation was being considered in 15 states, and had passed in some states, such as Tennessee. The American Civil Liberties Union offered to defend anyone who wanted to bring a test case against one of these laws. John T. Scopes accepted, and confessed to teaching his Tennessee class evolution in defiance of the Butler Act, using the textbook by George William Hunter: &quot;A Civic Biology: Presented in Problems&quot; (1914). The trial, widely publicized by H. L. Mencken among others, is commonly referred to as the Scopes Monkey Trial. The court convicted Scopes, but the widespread publicity galvanized proponents of evolution. Following an appeal of the case to the Tennessee Supreme Court, the Court overturned the decision on a technicality (the judge had assessed the minimum $100 fine instead of allowing the jury to assess the fine). The statute required a minimum fine of $100, and the state Constitution required all fines over $50 to be assessed by a jury.

Although it overturned the conviction, the Court decided that the Butler Act was not in violation of the Religious Preference provisions of the Tennessee Constitution (Section 3 of Article 1), which stated &quot;that no preference shall ever be given, by law, to any religious establishment or mode of worship&quot;. The Court, applying that state constitutional language, held:
The interpretation of the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution up to that time held that the government could not establish a particular religion as the &quot;State&quot; religion. The Tennessee Supreme Court&#x27;s decision held in effect that the Butler Act was constitutional under the state Constitution&#x27;s Religious Preference Clause, because the Act did not establish one religion as the &quot;State religion&quot;. As a result of the holding, the teaching of evolution remained illegal in Tennessee, and continued campaigning succeeded in removing evolution from school textbooks throughout the United States.

===&quot;Epperson v. Arkansas&quot; (1968)===

In 1968 the United States Supreme Court invalidated a forty-year-old Arkansas statute that prohibited the teaching of evolution in the public schools. A Little Rock, Arkansas, high-school-biology teacher, Susan Epperson, filed suit, charging that the law violated the federal constitutional prohibition against establishment of religion as set forth in the Establishment Clause. The Little Rock Ministerial Association supported Epperson&#x27;s challenge, declaring, &quot;to use the Bible to support an irrational and an archaic concept of static and undeveloping creation is not only to misunderstand the meaning of the Book of Genesis, but to do God and religion a disservice by making both enemies of scientific advancement and academic freedom&quot;. The Court held that the United States Constitution prohibits a state from requiring, in the words of the majority opinion, &quot;that teaching and learning must be tailored to the principles or prohibitions of any religious sect or dogma&quot;. But the Supreme Court decision also suggested that creationism could be taught in addition to evolution.

===&quot;Daniel v. Waters&quot; (1975)===

&quot;Daniel v. Waters&quot; was a 1975 legal case in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit struck down Tennessee&#x27;s law regarding the teaching of &quot;equal time&quot; of evolution and creationism in public-school science classes because it violated the Establishment Clause. Following this ruling, creationism was stripped of overt biblical references and rebranded &quot;Creation Science&quot;, and several states passed legislative acts requiring that this be given equal time with the teaching of evolution.

===Creation science===
As biologists grew more and more confident in evolution as the central defining principle of biology, American membership in churches favoring increasingly literal interpretations of scripture also rose, with the Southern Baptist Convention and Lutheran Church–Missouri Synod outpacing all other denominations. With growth and increased finances, these churches became better equipped to promulgate a creationist message, with their own colleges, schools, publishing houses, and broadcast media.

In 1961 Presbyterian and Reformed Publishing released the first major modern creationist book: John C. Whitcomb and Henry M. Morris&#x27; influential &quot;The Genesis Flood: The Biblical Record and Its Scientific Implications&quot;. The authors argued that creation was literally 6 days long, that humans lived concurrently with dinosaurs, and that God created each &quot;kind&quot; of life individually. On the strength of this, Morris became a popular speaker, spreading anti-evolutionary ideas at fundamentalist churches, colleges, and conferences. Morris&#x27; Creation Science Research Center (CSRC) rushed publication of biology textbooks that promoted creationism. Ultimately, the CSRC broke up over a divide between sensationalism and a more intellectual approach, and Morris founded the Institute for Creation Research, which he promised would be controlled and operated by scientists. During this time, Morris and others who supported flood geology adopted the terms &quot;scientific creationism&quot; and &quot;creation science&quot;. The &quot;flood geology&quot; theory effectively co-opted &quot;the generic creationist label for their hyperliteralist views.&quot;

====Court cases====
=====&quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot;=====

In 1982, another case in Arkansas ruled that the Arkansas &quot;Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act&quot; (Act 590) was unconstitutional because it violated the Establishment Clause. Much of the transcript of the case was lost, including evidence from Francisco Ayala.

=====&quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot;=====

In the early 1980s, the Louisiana legislature passed a law titled the &quot;Balanced Treatment for Creation-Science and Evolution-Science Act&quot;. The act did not require teaching either evolution or creationism as such, but did require that when evolutionary science was taught, creation science had to be taught as well. Creationists had lobbied aggressively for the law, arguing that the act was about academic freedom for teachers, an argument adopted by the state in support of the act. Lower courts ruled that the State&#x27;s actual purpose was to promote the religious doctrine of creation science, but the State appealed to the Supreme Court.

In the similar case of &quot;McLean v. Arkansas&quot; (see above) the federal trial court had also decided against creationism. &quot;Mclean v. Arkansas&quot; was not appealed to the federal Circuit Court of Appeals, creationists instead thinking that they had better chances with &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot;. In 1987 the United States Supreme Court ruled that the Louisiana act was also unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion. At the same time, it stated its opinion that &quot;teaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins of humankind to school children might be validly done with the clear secular intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction&quot;, leaving open the door for a handful of proponents of creation science to evolve their arguments into the iteration of creationism that later came to be known as intelligent design.

===Intelligent design===

In response to &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot;, the neo-creationist intelligent design movement was formed around the Discovery Institute&#x27;s Center for Science and Culture. It makes the claim that &quot;certain features of the universe and of living things are best explained by an intelligent cause, not an undirected process such as natural selection.&quot; It has been viewed as a &quot;scientific&quot; approach to creationism by creationists, but is widely rejected as pseudoscience by the science community—primarily because intelligent design cannot be tested and rejected like scientific hypotheses (see for example, List of scientific bodies explicitly rejecting intelligent design).

====Kansas evolution hearings====

In the push by intelligent design advocates to introduce intelligent design in public school science classrooms, the hub of the intelligent design movement, the Discovery Institute, arranged to conduct hearings to review the evidence for evolution in the light of its Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plans. The Kansas evolution hearings were a series of hearings held in Topeka, Kansas, May 5 to May 12, 2005. The Kansas State Board of Education eventually adopted the institute&#x27;s Critical Analysis of Evolution lesson plans over objections of the State Board Science Hearing Committee, and electioneering on behalf of conservative Republican Party candidates for the Board. On August 1, 2006, four of the six conservative Republicans who approved the Critical Analysis of Evolution classroom standards lost their seats in a primary election. The moderate Republican and Democrats gaining seats vowed to overturn the 2005 school science standards and adopt those recommended by a State Board Science Hearing Committee that were rejected by the previous board, and on February 13, 2007, the Board voted 6 to 4 to reject the amended science standards enacted in 2005. The definition of science was once again limited to &quot;the search for natural explanations for what is observed in the universe.&quot;

====Dover trial====

Following the &quot;Edwards v. Aguillard&quot; decision by the United States Supreme Court, in which the Court held that a Louisiana law requiring that creation science be taught in public schools whenever evolution was taught was unconstitutional, because the law was specifically intended to advance a particular religion, creationists renewed their efforts to introduce creationism into public school science classes. This effort resulted in intelligent design, which sought to avoid legal prohibitions by leaving the source of creation to an unnamed and undefined intelligent designer, as opposed to God. This ultimately resulted in the &quot;Dover Trial,&quot; &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District&quot;, which went to trial on 26 September 2005 and was decided on 20 December 2005 in favor of the plaintiffs, who charged that a mandate that intelligent design be taught in public school science classrooms was an unconstitutional establishment of religion. The &quot;Kitzmiller v. Dover&quot; decision held that intelligent design was not a subject of legitimate scientific research, and that it &quot;cannot uncouple itself from its creationist, and hence religious, antecedents.&quot;

The December 2005 ruling in the Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District trial supported the viewpoint of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and other science and education professional organizations who say that proponents of Teach the Controversy seek to undermine the teaching of evolution while promoting intelligent design, and to advance an education policy for U.S. public schools that introduces creationist explanations for the origin of life to public-school science curricula.

====Texas Board of Education support for intelligent design====
On March 27, 2009, the Texas Board of Education, by a vote of 13 to 2, voted that at least in Texas, textbooks must teach intelligent design alongside evolution, and question the validity of the fossil record. Don McLeroy, a dentist and chair of the board, said, &quot;I think the new standards are wonderful ... dogmatism about evolution [has sapped] America&#x27;s scientific soul.&quot; According to &quot;Science&quot; magazine, &quot;Because Texas is the second-largest textbook market in the United States, publishers have a strong incentive to be certified by the board as &#x27;conforming 100% to the state&#x27;s standards&#x27;.&quot; The 2009 Texas Board of Education hearings were chronicled in the 2012 documentary &quot;The Revisionaries&quot;.

====Recent developments====

The scientific consensus on the origins and evolution of life continues to be challenged by creationist organizations and religious groups who desire to uphold some form of creationism (usually Young Earth creationism, creation science, Old Earth creationism or intelligent design) as an alternative. Most of these groups are literalist Christians who believe the biblical account is inerrant, and more than one sees the debate as part of the Christian mandate to evangelize. Some groups see science and religion as being diametrically opposed views that cannot be reconciled. More accommodating viewpoints, held by many mainstream churches and many scientists, consider science and religion to be separate categories of thought (non-overlapping magisteria), which ask fundamentally different questions about reality and posit different avenues for investigating it. This idea has received criticism from both the non-religious, like the zoologist, evolutionary biologist and religion critic Richard Dawkins, and fundamentalists, who see the idea as both underestimating the ability of methodological naturalism to result in moral conclusions and ignorant or downplaying of the fact claims of religions and scriptures.

Studies on the religious beliefs of scientists does support the evidence of a rift between traditional literal fundamentalist religion and experimental science. Three studies of scientific attitudes since 1904 have shown that over 80% of scientists do not believe in a traditional god or the traditional belief in immortality, with disbelief stronger amongst biological scientists than physical scientists. Amongst those not registering such attitudes a high percentage indicated a preference for adhering to a belief concerning mystery than any dogmatic or faith based view. But only 10% of scientists stated that they saw a fundamental clash between science and religion. This study of trends over time suggests that the &quot;culture wars&quot; between creationism and evolution, are held more strongly by religious literalists than by scientists themselves and are likely to continue, fostering anti-scientific or pseudoscientific attitudes amongst fundamentalist believers.

More recently, the intelligent design movement has attempted an anti-evolution position that avoids any direct appeal to religion. Scientists have argued that intelligent design is pseudoscience and does not represent any research program within the mainstream scientific community, and is still essentially creationism. Its leading proponent, the Discovery Institute, made widely publicized claims that it was a new science, although the only paper arguing for it published in a scientific journal was accepted in questionable circumstances and quickly disavowed in the Sternberg peer review controversy, with the Biological Society of Washington stating that it did not meet the journal&#x27;s scientific standards, was a &quot;significant departure&quot; from the journal&#x27;s normal subject area and was published at the former editor&#x27;s sole discretion, &quot;contrary to typical editorial practices.&quot; On August 1, 2005, U.S. president George W. Bush commented endorsing the teaching of intelligent design alongside evolution &quot;I felt like both sides ought to be properly taught ... so people can understand what the debate is about.&quot;

==Points of view==

In the controversy a number of divergent opinions have crystallized regarding both the acceptance of scientific theories and religious doctrine and practice.

===Young-Earth creationism===
Young-Earth creationism (YEC) involves the religiously based belief that God created the Earth within the last 10,000 years, literally as described in Genesis, within the approximate timeframe of biblical genealogies (detailed - for example - in the Ussher chronology). Young-Earth creationists often believe that the universe has a similar age to that of the Earth.
Creationist cosmologies result from attempts by some creationists to assign the universe an age consistent with the Ussher chronology and other Young-Earth timeframes based on the genealogies.

This belief generally has a basis in biblical literalism and completely rejects the scientific methodology of evolutionary biology.
Creation science is agreed by the scientific community to be a pseudoscience that attempts to prove that Young Earth creationism is consistent with science.

===Old-Earth creationism===
Old-Earth creationism holds that God created the physical universe, but that one should not take the creation event of Genesis within 6 days strictly literally. This group generally accepts the age of the Universe and the age of the Earth as described by astronomers and geologists, but regards details of the evolutionary theory as questionable. Old-Earth creationists interpret the Genesis creation-narrative in a number of ways, each differing from the six, consecutive, 24-hour day creation of the Young-Earth creationist view.

===Neo-creationism and &quot;intelligent design&quot;===
Neo-creationists intentionally distance themselves from other forms of creationism, preferring to be known as wholly separate from creationism as a philosophy. They wish to re-frame the debate over the origins of life in non-religious terms and without appeals to scripture, and to bring the debate before the public. Neo-creationists may be either Young Earth or Old Earth creationists, and hold a range of underlying theological viewpoints (e.g. on the interpretation of the Bible). , neo-creationism underlies the intelligent-design movement, which has a &quot;big tent&quot; strategy making it inclusive of many Young-Earth creationists (such as Paul Nelson and Percival Davis) and some sympathetic Old-Earth creationists.

===Neo-creationism and fundamentalist cladists===
As of the 2010s, religious fundamentalist cladists that deny speciation and chronospecies have become more common, following similar lines of thought as creationists, usually replacing religious teachings about deities with religious philosophy. In addition to general denial of biological evolution, common talking points of such cladist creationists are denial of botany and ichthyology along with conflation of herpetology and ornithology along with ignorance of mutation rates and paraphyletic groups.

Only a small amount of the general population thus far noticed the creeping spread of such religious cladists, as very few people even have the education to separate the use of the tool from the religious group, as the graph itself does not necessarily assume evolution.

===Theistic evolution===
Theistic evolution takes the general view that, instead of faith being in opposition to biological evolution, some or all classical religious teachings about God and creation are compatible with some or all of modern scientific theory, including, specifically, evolution. It generally views evolution as a tool used by a creator god, who is both the first cause and immanent sustainer/upholder of the universe; it is therefore well-accepted by people of strong theistic (as opposed to deistic) convictions. Theistic evolution can synthesize with the day-age interpretation of the Genesis creation myth; most adherents consider that the first chapters of Genesis should not be interpreted as a &quot;literal&quot; description, but rather as a literary framework or allegory. This position generally accepts the viewpoint of methodological naturalism, a long-standing convention of the scientific method in science.

Many mainline/liberal denominations have long accepted evolution, and it is increasingly finding acceptance among evangelical Christians, who strive to keep traditional Christian theology intact.

Theistic evolutionists have frequently been prominent in opposing creationism (including intelligent design). Notable examples have included biologist Kenneth R. Miller and theologian John F. Haught, who testified for the plaintiffs in Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District in 2005. Another example is the Clergy Letter Project, which has compiled and maintains statements - signed by American Christian and non-Christian clergy of different denominations - rejecting creationism, with specific reference to points raised by intelligent-design proponents. Theistic evolutionists have also been active in Citizens Alliances for Science that oppose the introduction of creationism into public-school science classes (one example being evangelical Christian geologist Keith B. Miller, who is a prominent board member of Kansas Citizens for Science).

===Agnostic evolution===
Agnostic evolution is the position of acceptance of biological evolution, combined with the belief that it is not important whether God is, was, or will have been involved.

===Materialistic evolution===
Materialistic evolution is the acceptance of biological evolution, combined with the position that if the supernatural exists, it has little to no influence on the material world (a position common to philosophical naturalists, humanists and atheists). The New Atheists champion this view; they argue strongly that the creationist viewpoint is not only dangerous, but is completely rejected by science.

==Arguments relating to the definition and limits of science==
Critiques such as those based on the distinction between theory and fact are often leveled against unifying concepts within scientific disciplines. Principles such as uniformitarianism, Occam&#x27;s razor or parsimony, and the Copernican principle are claimed to be the result of a bias within science toward philosophical naturalism, which is equated by many creationists with atheism. In countering this claim, philosophers of science use the term methodological naturalism to refer to the long-standing convention in science of the scientific method. The methodological assumption is that observable events in nature are explained only by natural causes, without assuming the existence or non-existence of the supernatural, and therefore supernatural explanations for such events are outside the realm of science. Creationists claim that supernatural explanations should not be excluded and that scientific work is paradigmatically close-minded.

Because modern science tries to rely on the minimization of &quot;a priori&quot; assumptions, error, and subjectivity, as well as on avoidance of Baconian idols, it remains neutral on subjects such as religion or morality. Mainstream proponents accuse the creationists of conflating the two in a form of pseudoscience.

===Theory vs fact===

The argument that evolution is a theory, not a fact, has often been made against the exclusive teaching of evolution. The argument is related to a common misconception about the technical meaning of &quot;theory&quot; that is used by scientists. In common usage, &quot;theory&quot; often refers to conjectures, hypotheses, and unproven assumptions. In science, &quot;theory&quot; usually means &quot;a well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws, inferences, and tested hypotheses.&quot; For comparison, the National Academy of Sciences defines a fact as &quot;an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as &#x27;true&#x27;.&quot; It notes, however, that &quot;truth in science ... is never final, and what is accepted as a fact today may be modified or even discarded tomorrow.&quot;

Exploring this issue, paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould wrote:
Marston has argued that, although the creationism argument (that because evolution is &quot;merely&quot; a theory, it therefore cannot also be a fact) reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of the concepts, the scientific countering of the creationist position by the simple stipulation that evolution is a fact may be counterproductive; a better approach, according to Marston, is for scientists to present evolution not as a stipulated fact but as the &quot;best explanation&quot; for the development of life on earth. This approach, Marston argues, is less likely to end discussion of the topic and is more readily and effectively defended, in part by reducing the burden of proof standards required for assertions of &quot;fact&quot; and by shifting the burden of proof to those who claim that creationism is a better explanation.

===Falsifiability===

Philosopher of science Karl R. Popper set out the concept of falsifiability as a way to distinguish science and pseudoscience: testable theories are scientific, but those that are untestable are not. In &quot;Unended Quest&quot;, Popper declared &quot;I have come to the conclusion that Darwinism is not a testable scientific theory but a &quot;metaphysical research programme&quot;, a possible framework for testable scientific theories,&quot; while pointing out it had &quot;scientific character.&quot;

In what one sociologist derisively called &quot;Popper-chopping,&quot; opponents of evolution seized upon Popper&#x27;s definition to claim evolution was not a science, and claimed creationism was an equally valid metaphysical research program. For example, Duane Gish, a leading Creationist proponent, wrote in a letter to &quot;Discover&quot; magazine (July 1981): &quot;Stephen Jay Gould states that creationists claim creation is a scientific theory. This is a false accusation. Creationists have repeatedly stated that neither creation nor evolution is a scientific theory (and each is equally religious).&quot;

Popper responded to news that his conclusions were being used by anti-evolutionary forces by affirming that evolutionary theories regarding the origins of life on earth were scientific because &quot;their hypotheses can in many cases be &quot;tested&quot;.&quot; Creationists claimed that a key evolutionary concept, that all life on Earth is descended from a single common ancestor, was not mentioned as testable by Popper, and claimed it never would be.

In fact, Popper wrote admiringly of the value of Darwin&#x27;s theory. Only a few years later, Popper wrote, &quot;I have in the past described the theory as &#x27;almost tautological&#x27; ... I still believe that natural selection works in this way as a research programme. Nevertheless, I have changed my mind about the testability and logical status of the theory of natural selection; and I am glad to have an opportunity to make a recantation.&quot; His conclusion, later in the article is &quot;The theory of natural selection may be so formulated that it is far from tautological. In this case it is not only testable, but it turns out to be not strictly universally true.&quot;

Debate among some scientists and philosophers of science on the applicability of falsifiability in science continues. Simple falsifiability tests for common descent have been offered by some scientists: for instance, biologist and prominent critic of creationism Richard Dawkins and J. B. S. Haldane both pointed out that if fossil rabbits were found in the Precambrian era, a time before most similarly complex lifeforms had evolved, &quot;that would completely blow evolution out of the water.&quot;

Falsifiability has caused problems for creationists: in his 1982 decision &quot;McLean v. Arkansas Board of Education&quot;, Judge William R. Overton used falsifiability as one basis for his ruling against the teaching of creation science in the public schools, ultimately declaring it &quot;simply not science.&quot;

===Conflation of science and religion===

Creationists commonly argue against evolution on the grounds that &quot;evolution is a religion; it is not a science,&quot; in order to undermine the higher ground biologists claim in debating creationists, and to reframe the debate from being between science (evolution) and religion (creationism) to being between two equally religious beliefs—or even to argue that evolution is religious while intelligent design is not. Those that oppose evolution frequently refer to those who accept evolution as &quot;evolutionists&quot; or &quot;Darwinists.&quot;

This is generally argued by analogy, by arguing that evolution and religion have one or more things in common, and that therefore evolution is a religion. Examples of claims made in such arguments are statements that evolution is based on faith, that supporters of evolution revere Darwin as a prophet and dogmatically reject alternative suggestions out-of-hand. These claims have become more popular in recent years as the neocreationist movement has sought to distance itself from religion, thus giving it more reason to make use of a seemingly anti-religious analogy.

In biology, no scientist&#x27;s claims, including Darwin&#x27;s, are treated as sacrosanct, as shown by the aspects of Darwin&#x27;s theory that have been rejected or revised by scientists over the years, to form first neo-Darwinism and later the modern evolutionary synthesis.

===Appeal to consequences===

A number of creationists have blurred the boundaries between their disputes over the truth of the underlying facts, and explanatory theories, of evolution, with their purported philosophical and moral consequences. This type of argument is known as an appeal to consequences, and is a logical fallacy. Examples of these arguments include those of prominent creationists such as Ken Ham and Henry M. Morris.

==Disputes relating to science==
Many creationists strongly oppose certain scientific theories in a number of ways, including opposition to specific applications of scientific processes, accusations of bias within the scientific community, and claims that discussions within the scientific community reveal or imply a crisis. In response to perceived crises in modern science, creationists claim to have an alternative, typically based on faith, creation science, or intelligent design. The scientific community has responded by pointing out that their conversations are frequently misrepresented (e.g. by quote mining) in order to create the impression of a deeper controversy or crisis, and that the creationists&#x27; alternatives are generally pseudoscientific.

===Biology===

Disputes relating to evolutionary biology are central to the controversy between creationists and the scientific community. The aspects of evolutionary biology disputed include common descent (and particularly human evolution from common ancestors with other members of the great apes), macroevolution, and the existence of transitional fossils.

====Common descent====


A group of organisms is said to have common descent if they have a common ancestor. A theory of universal common descent based on evolutionary principles was proposed by Charles Darwin and is now generally accepted by biologists. The most recent common ancestor of all living organisms is believed to have appeared about 3.9 billion years ago. With a few exceptions (e.g. Michael Behe) the vast majority of creationists rejected this theory in favor of the belief that a common design suggests a common designer (God). Many of these same creationists through the beginning of the 21st century also held that modern species were perpetually fixed from creation. However, now a large amount of creationists allow evolution of species, in the face of undeniable evidence for speciation. They contend, however, that it was specific &quot;kinds&quot; or baramin that were created initially, from which all present-day species arose. Thus all bear species may have developed from a common ancestor that was separately created to establish a bear-like baramin, by this type of creationism. This type of creationism often acknowledges the existence of evolutionary processes but denies that they demonstrate common ancestry or that evolutionary processes would have produced the diversity of contemporary life.

Evidence of common descent includes evidence from genetics, fossil records, comparative anatomy, geographical distribution of species, comparative physiology and comparative biochemistry.

=====Human evolution=====

Human evolution is the study of the biological evolution of humans as a distinct species from its common ancestors with other animals. Analysis of fossil evidence and genetic distance are two of the means by which scientists understand this evolutionary history.

Fossil evidence suggests that humans&#x27; earliest hominid ancestors may have split from other primates as early as the late Oligocene, circa 26 to 24 Ma, and that by the early Miocene, the adaptive radiation of many different hominoid forms was well underway. Evidence from the molecular dating of genetic differences indicates that the gibbon lineage (family Hylobatidae) diverged between 18 and 12 Ma, and the orangutan lineage (subfamily Ponginae) diverged about 12 Ma. While there is no fossil evidence thus far clearly documenting the early ancestry of gibbons, fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by &quot;Sivapithecus&quot; from India and &quot;Griphopithecus&quot; from Turkey, dated to around 10 Ma. Molecular evidence further suggests that between 8 and 4 Ma, first the gorillas, and then the chimpanzee (genus &quot;Pan&quot;) split from the line leading to the humans. We have no fossil record of this divergence, but distinctively hominid fossils have been found dating to 3.2 Ma (see Lucy) and possibly even earlier, at 6 or 7 Ma (see Toumaï). Comparisons of DNA show that 99.4 percent of the coding regions are identical in chimpanzees and humans (95–96% overall), which is taken as strong evidence of recent common ancestry. Today, only one distinct human species survives, but many earlier species have been found in the fossil record, including &quot;Homo erectus&quot;, &quot;Homo habilis&quot;, and &quot;Homo neanderthalensis&quot;.

Creationists dispute there is evidence of shared ancestry in the fossil evidence, and argue either that these are misassigned ape fossils (e.g. that Java Man was a gibbon) or too similar to modern humans to designate them as distinct or transitional forms. Creationists frequently disagree where the dividing lines would be. Creation myths (such as the Book of Genesis) frequently posit a first man (Adam, in the case of Genesis), which has been advocated by creationists as underlying an alternative viewpoint to the scientific account. All these claims and objections are subsequently refuted.

Creationists also dispute the scientific community&#x27;s interpretation of genetic evidence in the study of human evolution. They argue that it is a &quot;dubious assumption&quot; that genetic similarities between various animals imply a common ancestral relationship, and that scientists are coming to this interpretation only because they have preconceived notions that such shared relationships exist. Creationists also argue that genetic mutations are strong evidence against evolutionary theory because, they assert, the mutations required for major changes to occur would almost certainly be detrimental. However, most mutations are neutral, and the minority of mutations which are beneficial or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be helpful in another.

====Macroevolution====

In biology, macroevolution refers to evolution at and above the species level, including most of fossil history and much of systematics. Microevolution refers to the process in evolution within populations, including adaptive and neutral evolution. However, there is no fundamental distinction between these processes; small changes compound over time and eventually lead to speciation. Creationists argue that a finite number of discrete &quot;kinds&quot; were created, as described in the Book of Genesis, and these kinds determine the limits of variation. Early Creationists equated kinds with species, but most now accept that speciation can occur: not only is the evidence overwhelming for speciation, but the millions of species now in existence could not have fit in Noah&#x27;s Ark, as depicted in Genesis. &quot;Created kinds&quot; identified by creationists are more generally on the level of the family (for example, Canidae), but the genus &quot;Homo&quot; is a separate kind. A Creationist systematics called Baraminology builds on the idea of created kind, calling it a &quot;baramin&quot;. While evolutionary systematics is used to explore relationships between organisms by descent, baraminology attempts to find discontinuities between groups of organisms. It employs many of the tools of evolutionary systematics, but Biblical criteria for taxonomy take precedence over all other criteria. This undermines their claim to objectivity: they accept evidence for the common ancestry of cats or dogs but not analogous evidence for the common ancestry of apes and humans.

Recent arguments against macroevolution (in the Creationist sense) include the intelligent design (ID) arguments of irreducible complexity and specified complexity. Neither argument has been accepted for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, and both arguments have been rejected by the scientific community as pseudoscience. When taken to court in an attempt to introduce ID into the classroom, the judge wrote &quot;The overwhelming evidence at trial established that ID is a religious view, a mere re-labeling of creationism, and not a scientific theory.&quot;

====Transitional fossils====
It is commonly stated by critics of evolution that there are no known transitional fossils. This position is based on a misunderstanding of the nature of what represents a transitional feature. A common creationist argument is that no fossils are found with partially functional features. It is plausible that a complex feature with one function can adapt a different function through evolution. The precursor to, for example, a wing, might originally have only been used for gliding, trapping flying prey, or mating display. Today, wings can still have all of these functions, but they are also used in active flight.
As another example, Alan Hayward stated in &quot;Creation and Evolution&quot; (1985) that &quot;Darwinists rarely mention the whale because it presents them with one of their most insoluble problems. They believe that somehow a whale must have evolved from an ordinary land-dwelling animal, which took to the sea and lost its legs ... A land mammal that was in the process of becoming a whale would fall between two stools—it would not be fitted for life on land or at sea, and would have no hope for survival.&quot; The evolution of whales has been documented in considerable detail, with &quot;Ambulocetus&quot;, described as looking like a three-metre long mammalian crocodile, as one of the transitional fossils. The hippopotamus, the whale&#x27;s closest living ancestor, exemplifies how an animal might be well-suited for both land and water.

Although transitional fossils elucidate the evolutionary transition of one life-form to another, they only exemplify snapshots of this process. Due to the special circumstances required for preservation of living beings, only a very small percentage of all life-forms that ever have existed can be expected to be discovered. Thus, the transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, but it will never be known in detail. Progressing research and discovery managed to fill in several gaps and continues to do so. Critics of evolution often cite this argument as being a convenient way to explain off the lack of &#x27;snapshot&#x27; fossils that show crucial steps between species.

The theory of punctuated equilibrium developed by Stephen Jay Gould and Niles Eldredge is often mistakenly drawn into the discussion of transitional fossils. This theory pertains only to well-documented transitions within taxa or between closely related taxa over a geologically short period. These transitions, usually traceable in the same geological outcrop, often show small jumps in morphology between periods of morphological stability. To explain these jumps, Gould and Eldredge envisaged comparatively long periods of genetic stability separated by periods of rapid evolution. For example, the change from a creature the size of a mouse, to one the size of an elephant, could be accomplished over 60,000 years, with a rate of change too small to be noticed over any human lifetime. 60,000 years is too small a gap to be identified or identifiable in the fossil record.

Experts in evolutionary theory have pointed out that even if it were possible for enough fossils to survive to show a close transitional change critics will never be satisfied, as the discovery of one &quot;missing link&quot; itself creates two more so-called &quot;missing links&quot; on either side of the discovery. Richard Dawkins says that the reason for this &quot;losing battle&quot; is that many of these critics are theists who &quot;simply don&#x27;t want to see the truth.&quot;

===Geology===
Many believers in Young Earth creationism—a position held by the majority of proponents of &#x27;flood geology&#x27;—accept biblical &quot;chronogenealogies&quot; (such as the Ussher chronology, which in turn is based on the Masoretic version of the Genealogies of Genesis). They believe that God created the universe approximately 6,000 years ago, in the space of six days. Much of creation geology is devoted to debunking the dating methods used in anthropology, geology, and planetary science that give ages in conflict with the young Earth idea. In particular, creationists dispute the reliability of radiometric dating and isochron analysis, both of which are central to mainstream geological theories of the age of the Earth. They usually dispute these methods based on uncertainties concerning initial concentrations of individually considered species and the associated measurement uncertainties caused by diffusion of the parent and daughter isotopes. A full critique of the entire parameter-fitting analysis, which relies on dozens of radionuclei parent and daughter pairs and gives essentially identical or near identical readings, has not been done by creationists hoping to cast doubt on the technique.

The consensus of professional scientific organizations worldwide is that no scientific evidence contradicts the age of approximately 4.5 billion years. Young Earth creationists reject these ages on the grounds of what they regard as being tenuous and untestable assumptions in the methodology. They have often quoted apparently inconsistent radiometric dates to cast doubt on the utility and accuracy of the method. Mainstream proponents who get involved in this debate point out that dating methods only rely on the assumptions that the physical laws governing radioactive decay have not been violated since the sample was formed (harking back to Lyell&#x27;s doctrine of uniformitarianism). They also point out that the &quot;problems&quot; that creationists publicly mentioned can be shown to either not be problems at all, are issues with known contamination, or simply the result of incorrectly evaluating legitimate data.

===Other sciences===
====Cosmology====

While Young Earth creationists believe that the Universe was created by the Judeo-Christian-Islamic God approximately 6000 years ago, the current scientific consensus is that the Universe as we know it emerged from the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago. The recent science of nucleocosmochronology is extending the approaches used for carbon-14 and other radiometric dating to the dating of astronomical features. For example, based upon this emerging science, the Galactic thin disk of the Milky Way galaxy is estimated to have been formed 8.3 ± 1.8 billion years ago.

====Nuclear physics====

Creationists point to experiments they have performed, which they claim demonstrate that 1.5 billion years of nuclear decay took place over a short period, from which they infer that &quot;billion-fold speed-ups of nuclear decay&quot; have occurred, a massive violation of the principle that radioisotope decay rates are constant, a core principle underlying nuclear physics generally, and radiometric dating in particular.

The scientific community points to numerous flaws in these experiments, to the fact that their results have not been accepted for publication by any peer-reviewed scientific journal, and to the fact that the creationist scientists conducting them were untrained in experimental geochronology.

In refutation of Young Earth claims of inconstant decay-rates affecting the reliability of radiometric dating, Roger C. Wiens, a physicist specializing in isotope dating states:
===Misrepresentations of the scientific community===
The Discovery Institute has a &quot;formal declaration&quot; titled &quot;A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism&quot; which has many evangelicals, people from fields irrelevant to biology and geology and few biologists. Many of the biologists who signed have fields not directly related to evolution. In response, there has been an analogous declaration humorously upholding the consensus, Project Steve, which emphasizes the large amount of scientists supporting the consensus.

====Quote mining====

As a means to criticize mainstream science, creationists sometimes quote scientists who ostensibly support the mainstream theories, but appear to acknowledge criticisms similar to those of creationists. These have very often been shown to be quote mines that do not accurately reflect the evidence for evolution or the mainstream scientific community&#x27;s opinion of it, or are highly out-of-date. Many of the same quotes used by creationists have appeared so frequently in Internet discussions due to the availability of cut and paste functions, that the TalkOrigins Archive has created &quot;The Quote Mine Project&quot; for quick reference to the original context of these quotations. Creationists often quote mine Darwin, especially with regard to the seeming improbability of the evolution of the eye, to give support to their views.

==Public policy issues==

The creation–evolution controversy has grown in importance in recent years, interfacing with other contemporary political issues, primarily those in the United States that involve the Christian right.

===Science education===
Creationists promoted the idea that evolution is a theory in crisis with scientists criticizing evolution and claim that fairness and equal time requires educating students about the alleged scientific controversy.

Opponents, being the overwhelming majority of the scientific community and science education organizations,
&quot;See&quot;:
*List of scientific societies explicitly rejecting intelligent design
*The Discovery Institute&#x27;s &quot;A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism&quot; petition begun in 2001 has been signed by &quot;over 700 scientists&quot; as of August 20, 2006. The four-day &quot;A Scientific Support for Darwinism&quot; petition gained 7,733 signatories from scientists opposing ID.
*AAAS 2002. The American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS), the largest association of scientists in the U.S., has 120,000 members, and firmly rejects ID.
*More than 70,000 Australian scientists &quot;...urge all Australian governments and educators not to permit the teaching or promulgation of ID as science.&quot;
*National Center for Science Education]: List of statements from scientific professional organizations on the status intelligent design and other forms of creationism in the sciences. reply that there is no scientific controversy and that the controversy exists solely in terms of religion and politics.

George Mason University Biology Department introduced a course on the creation/evolution controversy, and apparently as students learn more about biology, they find objections to evolution less convincing, suggesting that &quot;teaching the controversy&quot; rightly as a separate elective course on philosophy or history of science, or &quot;politics of science and religion,&quot; would undermine creationists&#x27; criticisms, and that the scientific community&#x27;s resistance to this approach was bad public relations.

===Freedom of speech===
Creationists have claimed that preventing them from teaching creationism violates their right of freedom of speech. Court cases (such as &quot;Webster v. New Lenox School District&quot; (1990) and &quot;Bishop v. Aronov&quot; (1991)) have upheld school districts&#x27; and universities&#x27; right to restrict teaching to a specified curriculum.

==Issues relating to religion==
===Religion and historical scientists===
Creationists often argue that Christianity and literal belief in the Bible are either foundationally significant or directly responsible for scientific progress. To that end, Institute for Creation Research founder Henry M. Morris has enumerated scientists such as astronomer and philosopher Galileo Galilei, mathematician and theoretical physicist James Clerk Maxwell, mathematician and philosopher Blaise Pascal, geneticist monk Gregor Mendel, and Isaac Newton as believers in a biblical creation narrative.

This argument usually involves scientists who were no longer alive when evolution was proposed or whose field of study did not include evolution. The argument is generally rejected as specious by those who oppose creationism.

Many of the scientists in question did some early work on the mechanisms of evolution, e.g., the modern evolutionary synthesis combines Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution with Mendel&#x27;s theories of inheritance and genetics. Though biological evolution of some sort had become the primary mode of discussing speciation within science by the late-19th century, it was not until the mid-20th century that evolutionary theories stabilized into the modern synthesis. Geneticist and evolutionary biologist Theodosius Dobzhansky, called the Father of the Modern Synthesis, argued that &quot;Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution,&quot; and saw no conflict between evolutionary and his religious beliefs. Nevertheless, some of the historical scientists marshalled by creationists were dealing with quite different issues than any are engaged with today: Louis Pasteur, for example, opposed the theory of spontaneous generation with biogenesis, an advocacy some creationists describe as a critique on chemical evolution and abiogenesis. Pasteur accepted that some form of evolution had occurred and that the Earth was millions of years old.

The relationship between religion and science was not portrayed in antagonistic terms until the late-19th century, and even then there have been many examples of the two being reconcilable for evolutionary scientists. Many historical scientists wrote books explaining how pursuit of science was seen by them as fulfillment of spiritual duty in line with their religious beliefs. Even so, such professions of faith were not insurance against dogmatic opposition by certain religious people.

==Forums==
===Debates===
Many creationists and scientists engage in frequent public debates regarding the origin of human life, hosted by a variety of institutions. However, some scientists disagree with this tactic, arguing that by openly debating supporters of supernatural origin explanations (creationism and intelligent design), scientists are lending credibility and unwarranted publicity to creationists, which could foster an inaccurate public perception and obscure the factual merits of the debate. For example, in May 2004 Michael Shermer debated creationist Kent Hovind in front of a predominantly creationist audience. In Shermer&#x27;s online reflection while he was explaining that he won the debate with intellectual and scientific evidence he felt it was &quot;not an intellectual exercise,&quot; but rather it was &quot;an emotional drama,&quot; with scientists arguing from &quot;an impregnable fortress of evidence that converges to an unmistakable conclusion,&quot; while for creationists it is &quot;a spiritual war.&quot; While receiving positive responses from creationist observers, Shermer concluded &quot;Unless there is a subject that is truly debatable (evolution v. creation is not), with a format that is fair, in a forum that is balanced, it only serves to belittle both the magisterium of science and the magisterium of religion.&quot; (see Non-overlapping magisteria). Others, like evolutionary biologist Massimo Pigliucci, have debated Hovind, and have expressed surprise to hear Hovind try &quot;to convince the audience that evolutionists believe humans came from rocks&quot; and at Hovind&#x27;s assertion that biologists believe humans &quot;evolved from bananas.&quot;
In September 2012, educator and television personality Bill Nye of &quot;Bill Nye the Science Guy&quot; fame spoke with the Associated Press and aired his fears about acceptance of creationist theory, believing that teaching children that creationism is the only true answer and without letting them understand the way science works will prevent any future innovation in the world of science. In February 2014, Nye defended evolution in the classroom in a debate with creationist Ken Ham on the topic of whether creation is a viable model of origins in today&#x27;s modern, scientific era.

Eugenie Scott of the National Center for Science Education, a nonprofit organization dedicated to defending the teaching of evolution in the public schools, claimed debates are not the sort of arena to promote science to creationists. Scott says that &quot;Evolution is not on trial in the world of science,&quot; and &quot;the topic of the discussion should not be the scientific legitimacy of evolution&quot; but rather should be on the lack of evidence in creationism. Stephen Jay Gould adopted a similar position, explaining:
===Political lobbying===
On both sides of the controversy a wide range of organizations are involved at a number of levels in lobbying in an attempt to influence political decisions relating to the teaching of evolution. These include the Discovery Institute, the National Center for Science Education, the National Science Teachers Association, state Citizens Alliances for Science, and numerous national science associations and state academies of science.

===Media coverage===
The controversy has been discussed in numerous newspaper articles, reports, op-eds and letters to the editor, as well as a number of radio and television programmes (including the PBS series, &quot;Evolution&quot; (2001) and Coral Ridge Ministries&#x27; &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Deadly Legacy&quot; (2006)). This has led some commentators to express a concern at what they see as a highly inaccurate and biased understanding of evolution among the general public. Edward Humes states:
==Outside the United States==

While the controversy has been prominent in the United States, it has flared up in other countries as well.

===Europe===
Europeans have often regarded the creation–evolution controversy as an American matter. In recent years the conflict has become an issue in other countries including Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Turkey and Serbia.

On September 17, 2007, the Committee on Culture, Science and Education of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe (PACE) issued a report on the attempt by American-inspired creationists to promote creationism in European schools. It concludes &quot;If we are not careful, creationism could become a threat to human rights which are a key concern of the Council of Europe... The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism which are closely allied to extreme right-wing political movements... some advocates of strict creationism are out to replace democracy by theocracy.&quot; The Council of Europe firmly rejected creationism.

===Australia===
Under the former Queensland state government of Joh Bjelke-Petersen, in the 1980s Queensland allowed the teaching of creationism in secondary schools. In 2010, the Queensland state government introduced the topic of creationism into school classes within the &quot;ancient history&quot; subject where its origins and nature are discussed as a significant controversy. Public lectures have been given in rented rooms at universities, by visiting American speakers. One of the most acrimonious aspects of the Australian debate was featured on the science television program &quot;Quantum&quot;, about a long-running and ultimately unsuccessful court case by Ian Plimer, Professor of Geology at the University of Melbourne, against an ordained minister, Allen Roberts, who had claimed that there were remnants of Noah&#x27;s Ark in eastern Turkey. Although the court found that Roberts had made false and misleading claims, they were not made in the course of trade or commerce, so the case failed.

===Islamic countries===

In recent times, the controversy over evolution has spread into several Islamic countries. In Egypt, evolution is currently taught in schools, but Saudi Arabia and Sudan have both banned the teaching of evolution in schools. Creation science has also been heavily promoted in Turkey, primarily by creationists like Harun Yahya. In Iran, the traditional practice of Shia Islam isn&#x27;t preoccupied with Qur&#x27;anic literalism as in case of Saudi Wahhabism but &quot;ijtihad;&quot; many influential Iranian Shi&#x27;ite scholars, including several who were closely involved in Iranian Revolution, are not opposed to evolutionary ideas in general, disagreeing that evolution necessarily conflicts with the Muslim mainstream. Iranian pupils since 5th grade of elementary school learn only about evolution, thus portraying geologists and scientists in general as an authoritative voice of scientific knowledge.

===Asia===
====South Korea====
In South Korea, most opposition to teaching evolution comes from the local evangelical community. As part of these efforts, the Korean Association for Creation Research (KACR) was established in 1981 by evangelical pastors Kim Yŏnggil and Ch&#x27;oe Yŏngsang. In South Korea, according to a 2009 survey, about 30 percent of the population believe in creation science while opposing the teaching of evolution.

<text>USS &quot;Apogon&quot; (SS-308), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the apogons, a genus of cardinalfishes found in tropical and subtropical waters. The original name planned for the ship was &quot;Abadejo&quot;, but the name was changed on 24 September 1942 before the keel was laid down.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Apogon&quot; was laid down on 9 December 1942, by the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; launched on 10 March 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Helen Lorena Withers (née LaBar), wife of Admiral Thomas Withers, Jr., then Commander of Submarine Forces; and commissioned on 16 July 1943.

==Service history==

===World War II===
The submarine held shakedown in the waters off the New England coast and departed New London on 13 September, bound for Hawaii. &quot;Apogon&quot; transited the Panama Canal on 25 September and reported for duty on that date to the Commander in Chief, Pacific Fleet. She reached Pearl Harbor on 11 October and began three weeks of training.

After loading fuel and provisions, &quot;Apogon&quot; got underway on 3 November for her first war patrol. Her patrol area comprised the waters within a 60-mile (110 km) radius of Moen Island and those along the shipping lanes between Truk and Kwajalein. The submarine was acting in support of Operation Galvanic, the seizure of the Gilbert Islands.

After a brief stop at Johnston Island on 5 November to top off her fuel tanks, &quot;Apogon&quot; continued on to her assigned area. During this patrol, she sighted four contacts deemed worthy of torpedo expenditure and actually attacked three. The only major damage she inflicted occurred on 4 December, when the submarine sank &quot;Daido Maru&quot;, a former gunboat. On 18 December, she ended her patrol and moored at Midway Atoll.

Following a refit there, &quot;Apogon&quot; proceeded to Pearl Harbor on 26 December for further repairs and training. She left Hawaii on 15 January 1944 for her second patrol, this time in waters surrounding the Mariana Islands. On 1 February, &quot;Apogon&quot; made the only attack of the patrol. She sighted a six-ship convoy and, soon thereafter, opened fire. The crew heard an explosion and saw their torpedoed target burst into flames. Ten minutes later, the lookout saw about 50 feet of the Japanese ship&#x27;s stern sticking out of the water, and this soon disappeared. &quot;Apogon&quot; then attacked another Japanese auxiliary. Although &quot;Apogon&quot; claimed to have sunk both ships, she was not officially credited with having destroyed either. &quot;Apogon&quot; ended her patrol after 50 days and returned to Pearl Harbor on 9 March.

&quot;Apogon&quot; moored beside on 10 March to commence refit. The submarine was drydocked at the Pearl Harbor Navy Yard from 15 to 19 March for the installation of two new propellers. After additional training exercises, she got underway on 2 April.

She paused at Johnston Island on 4 April to refuel, and later that day resumed her voyage toward waters south of the Japanese home islands. However, when a crewman was preparing to clean a 20 millimeter machine gun the next day, a live cartridge accidentally left in the chamber discharged and ricocheted into the man&#x27;s leg. &quot;Apogon&quot; immediately returned to Johnston Island to transfer the wounded man to the dispensary. The submarine again got underway on 6 April and conducted her entire patrol without encountering any enemy shipping. She finally arrived at Majuro on 22 May.

Refitting began on 23 May, and the submarine got underway on 8 June for trials. &quot;Apogon&quot; began her fourth patrol, which was in the area between Formosa and the Philippines, in company with , , and .

On 12 July, &quot;Apogon&quot; and her wolf pack consorts spotted a nine-ship Japanese convoy sailing with approximately six escorts. The submarines immediately began preparing an attack. The leading Japanese ship of the center column of the formation apparently sighted the wake of &quot;Apogon&quot;&#x27;s periscope and turned back to ram the submarine. As &quot;Apogon&quot; was turning to port to bring her stern tubes to bear, she was struck on the starboard side by the freighter. About eight feet of the main periscope and periscope shears were torn off, and the radar masts were bent and put out of commission. As a result, &quot;Apogon&quot; prematurely ended her patrol to return for repairs. She arrived at Midway on 22 July, where crews installed additional bracing on the periscope shears before the submarine proceeded on to Pearl Harbor.

Having reached Pearl Harbor on 26 July, &quot;Apogon&quot; was dry-docked. Both tail shafts were replaced and realigned, and the periscope, periscope shears, and the radar masts were replaced. The three main engines were also overhauled. On 12 September, &quot;Apogon&quot; was underway on yet another wartime patrol. She headed for the Kuril Islands area. The submarine then sunk a Japanese patrol craft on 23 September the 400 ton &quot;Choyo Maru No.6&quot;. Four days later, she sank &quot;Hachirogata Maru&quot;. Following this sinking, she rescued two Japanese survivors. The next month proved fruitless, and &quot;Apogon&quot; arrived at Midway on 28 October, ending her fifth patrol.

After a month of refit, &quot;Apogon&quot; commenced her sixth patrol on 20 November, again sailing for the Kuril Islands. The only action of this patrol was an attack on a tanker, which the submarine hit and damaged with a torpedo 19 December 1944. On 5 January 1945, &quot;Apogon&quot; arrived in Pearl Harbor for a brief stay before getting underway on 7 January for the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Vallejo, California to undergo a major overhaul.

&quot;Apogon&quot; returned to action on 28 May. Her patrol station was the Kuril Islands-Sea of Okhotsk area. She attacked a convoy of four Japanese ships and escort vessels on 18 June and sank one 2,614-ton transport, &quot;Hakuai Maru&quot; and sank the guard boat &quot;Kusonoki Maru no.2.&quot; On 2 July, &quot;Apogon&quot; severely damaged two small auxiliary submarine chasers Cha 58 and Cha 65. The patrol ended on 14 July at Midway.

&quot;Apogon&quot; began her eighth and final patrol on 7 August. She was assigned to the Marcus Island area. She made no attacks during this patrol because the Japanese capitulated on 15 August. &quot;Apogon&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor on 2 September and then continued on to San Diego, where she arrived on 11 September. &quot;Apogon&quot; was placed in reserve and decommissioned there on 1 October.

===Post-War===

====Operation Crossroads====
In January 1946, the submarine sailed for Pearl Harbor where she was to undergo preliminary work and tests in preparation to be used as a target in atomic bomb testing. Following completion of this refitting, &quot;Apogon&quot; arrived at Bikini Atoll on 31 May. She was sunk at Bikini during atomic bomb test &quot;Baker&quot; on 25 July 1946. Her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 25 February 1947.

==Awards==
&quot;Apogon&quot; received six battle stars for her World War II service.
