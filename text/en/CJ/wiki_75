<text>Emory University&#x27;s Goizueta Business School (also known as &quot;Goizueta Business School&quot;, &quot;Emory Business School&quot;, or simply &quot;Goizueta&quot; – pronounced &quot;goy-swet-ah&quot;) is a private business school of Emory University located in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. It is named after Roberto C. Goizueta, former Chairman and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. 

The school is accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Goizueta has over 23,000 alumni worldwide in 104 countries. 

==History==

On February 18, 1919, the dean of Emory College, Howard Odum, recommended the creation of a &quot;school of economics and business administration&quot; to the Board of Trustees. Thus, in the fall of 1919, the new school worked with Emory College to offer courses in economics, accounting, and business law. By 1925, there was one faculty member and full-time assistant, five staff members and 145 students. In 1926, eight students received the Bachelor of Business Administration degree. Two decades after the school awarded degrees in business administration, the school accepted its first female student in 1954. In the same year, the MBA program commenced, with 19 registered students.

In 1992, the Evening MBA program was introduced. When the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business began accrediting master’s programs, Emory’s program was one of the first to be approved. This newfound position accompanied new programs, such as the concentration within the MBA program for professional accounting and, in 1979, the Executive MBA program. Also at this time, the school created a plan to allow students to complete both the MBA and Juris Doctor degree within four years.

In 1994, the school was renamed for Roberto C. Goizueta, the CEO of The Coca-Cola Company. The millennium brought about a new PhD program in business administration and a new program in Real Estate. The school announced Karen Sedatole as interim dean in 2020.

<doc id="1106875" wikidata="Q3181387" url="?curid=1106875" title="John Duncan (Canadian politician)">
<text>John Morris Duncan (born December 19, 1948) is a Canadian politician. He served as a Member of the Parliament of Canada from 1993 to January 2006 and again from October 2008 until August 2015. On August 6, 2010, he was appointed to the Canadian Cabinet as Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development, Federal Interlocutor for Métis and Non-Status Indians, and Minister responsible for the Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency until his resignation on February 15, 2013 over his inappropriate written communication to the Tax Court of Canada. He later returned to Cabinet as Chief Government Whip, and served in that capacity until the 2015 election, which saw both Duncan&#x27;s own defeat and the defeat of the government.

==Education==
Born in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and raised in British Columbia, Duncan attended the University of British Columbia and graduated with a B.Sc. F from their Faculty of Forestry in 1972. Duncan&#x27;s first experience as an elected official was as an alderman in Ucluelet, British Columbia from 1982 to 1983.

==Entrance to politics==
In the 1993 election, Duncan was elected as a member of the Reform Party. He has served in all that party&#x27;s incarnations up until the 2006 federal election, when he lost his seat to Catherine J. Bell of the New Democratic Party by 630 votes.

Duncan was the Conservative Party&#x27;s Official Opposition Critic for Natural Resources. During that time he served on the Natural Resources Committee. He helped shape Conservative Party policy on west coast offshore oil and gas, softwood lumber trade and the pine beetle epidemic.

While in parliament, he was a member of the &quot;Restaurant Caucus&quot; in the House of Commons, a group of MPs who have interests in the restaurant industry.

Duncan&#x27;s Private Member&#x27;s Bill C - 259 passed the 38th Parliament to receive Royal Assent to eliminate the excise tax on jewelry. Duncan made parliamentary history as the first MP to have a Private Member&#x27;s bill related to cutting taxation pass.

He won the Vancouver Island North Conservative Party nomination for the 2008 federal election and was elected with 45.78% of the vote.

On December 2, 2008, the New Democratic Party asked the RCMP to investigate John Duncan&#x27;s alleged secret recording of a private NDP conference. He had apparently received the invitation to participate by mistake, in place of NDP MP Linda Duncan who had &quot;a similar email address&quot;. This happened within the context of the 2008–09 Canadian parliamentary dispute.

On August 6, 2010, in a minor cabinet shuffle, he joined cabinet as Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development.

Under the Harper government, several key bills with a direct effect on aboriginal communities have stalled. As a result, First Nations across Canada have embarked on a widespread and prolonged series of demonstrations under the banner of &quot;Idle No More&quot;. In addition, Attawapiskat chief Theresa Spence began a fast in December 2012 to demand a meeting with Harper and a Crown representative.
In response, Duncan wrote to Spence requesting she give up her hunger strike and meet with him. &quot;I didn&#x27;t ask for Minister Duncan,&quot; Spence replied. &quot;And I have dealt with him before. When I observe him, he doesn&#x27;t have a mind of his own because, before he would answer a question, he would always look at his people. He&#x27;s not the Prime Minister.&quot;

On February 15, 2013, he resigned from his cabinet position as Minister of Aboriginal Affairs and Northern Development after improperly advocating to a tax court on behalf of a constituent in June 2011, and was replaced by James Moore. He returned to cabinet in the more junior role as Minister of State and Chief Government Whip in July 2013.

In the 2015 Canadian federal election, Duncan sought reelection in the newly created riding of Courtenay—Alberni, but was defeated by Gord Johns of the NDP.

<text>Kiosk is an unincorporated place and former railway point and community in geographic Pentland Township in the Unorganized South Part of Nipissing District in northeastern Ontario, Canada. Kiosk is surrounded by but not within Algonquin Provincial Park, for which it provides a road access point via Ontario Highway 630, and is located on Kioshkokwi Lake on the Amable du Fond River on the right bank of the outlet of that river from the lake and across the river from the unincorporated place of Coristine. The name &quot;Kiosk&quot; is an abbreviated form of the lake&#x27;s name, which means &quot;lake of many gulls&quot;.

It lies on the now abandoned Canadian National Railway Alderdale Subdivision, a section of track that was originally constructed as the Canadian Northern Railway main line, between Coristine to the west and Ascalon to the east.

Until a fire in July 1975, a lumber company operated; however, new regulations in the park area prohibited its rebuilding. The community was demolished in the 1980s and the railway was abandoned later, so that Kiosk today is a recreational area and automobile access point (#29) to the interior of Algonquin Provincial Park.

In 2015, it was used as the filming location for Robert Eggers&#x27; acclaimed horror feature &quot;The Witch&quot;.

<text>Tsunami was an imprint of Marvel Comics founded on January 1, 2003.

==Overview==
Marvel&#x27;s goal was to create comic books that would appeal to manga readers. Other than the art, the titles shared little in common. For example, &quot;Runaways&quot; and &quot;Sentinel&quot; were aimed at children and younger teenagers, while &quot;Mystique&quot; touched on espionage and darker themes better suited for an older audience.

&quot;New Mutants&quot;, &quot;Mystique&quot;, &quot;Runaways&quot;, and &quot;Sentinel&quot; earned critical acclaim and a devoted fan following. &quot;Human Torch&quot;, &quot;Namor&quot; and &quot;Venom&quot; failed to generate interest, with the last surviving eighteen issues due to exceptionally high initial sales.

The imprint was discontinued in late December 2003. &quot;Mystique&quot; was the longest running title – lasting twenty-four issues before it was absorbed into the mainstream Marvel Comics imprint and had a change of writer as part of the X-Men: Reload event after the thirteenth issue. &quot;New Mutants&quot;, also part of Reload, was relaunched with a new first issue as &quot;New X-Men: Academy X&quot;. &quot;Venom&quot; and &quot;Runaways&quot; carried the imprint branding for the longest period, lasting until their eighteenth issues. After this, &quot;Runaways&quot; was briefly cancelled before being relaunched as part of the Marvel Next initiative. &quot;Venom&quot; was canceled outright. The other Tsunami series were canceled after twelve issues.

Since then, &quot;Runaways&quot; has received a boost from high digest-sized trade paperback (TPB) sales, which was one of the reasons for its relaunch. &quot;Sentinel&quot; was revived as a five-issue miniseries for the same reason. &quot;Human Torch&quot; received a single digest.

&quot;New Mutants&quot; received a single standard-size trade paperback compiling its first six issues and complete collections in the same format of its successor series, &quot;New X-Men: Academy X&quot;, which was revamped shortly after &quot;House of M&quot; as simply &quot;New X-Men&quot;. &quot;Mystique&quot; and &quot;Venom&quot; were fully collected as standard-size trade paperbacks.

==Titles==

* &quot;Inhumans&quot; (2003–2004) #1–12
* &quot;Mystique&quot; (2003–2005) #1–13 only

<text>Richard Edward Connell Jr. (October 17, 1893 – November 22, 1949) was an American author and journalist. He is most notable for his short story &quot;The Most Dangerous Game&quot; (1924). Connell was one of the most popular American short story writers of his time. His stories were published in &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; magazines. He had equal success as a journalist and screenwriter, and was nominated for an Academy Award in 1942 (Best Original Story) for the movie &quot;Meet John Doe&quot; (1941), directed by Frank Capra and based on his 1922 short story &quot;A Reputation&quot;.

He began his writing career for &quot;The Poughkeepsie Journal&quot;, and attended Georgetown College for a year before going to Harvard University. While at Harvard, Connell edited &quot;The Lampoon&quot; and &quot;The Crimson&quot;. He subsequently worked on the city staff of &quot;The New York American&quot; and as a copy writer for J.

<doc id="1106893" wikidata="Q2288775" url="?curid=1106893" title="Corporate America">
<text>Corporate America is the fifth studio album by American hard rock band Boston, released in 2002. It is the first album to feature band members Anton Cosmo and Kimberley Dahme, the last album released in vocalist Brad Delp&#x27;s lifetime (though he would posthumously appear on the band&#x27;s following album &quot;Life, Love &amp; Hope&quot;), the second and final album with vocalist Fran Cosmo, and the only album released by Artemis Records.

&quot;Corporate America&quot; received mixed reviews, with critics praising the production values. It was also a commercial disappointment, failing to chart outside U.S. and Japan. The low sales led to a lawsuit by the band&#x27;s leader, Tom Scholz against Artemis. A 48-date North American tour was launched on June 6, 2003.

==Recording==
The title track was released on the Internet before the album&#x27;s release and went number one on MP3.com&#x27;s progressive rock charts. The song was released under the pseudonym &quot;Downer&#x27;s Revenge&quot; in order to test its appeal to a younger demographic. Lyrically atypical song for Boston, according to Scholz, it&#x27;s the most important track on the album.

&quot;Didn&#x27;t Mean to Fall in Love&quot; was said to be similar to &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;. &quot;Livin&#x27; for You&quot; is a live version of a song that appeared originally on the previous full-length album &quot;Walk On&quot; (1994). &quot;I Had a Good Time&quot; was included on a 2009 reissue of &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;, the only track representing the album.

Three songs from the album were included with the band&#x27;s next studio album &quot;Life, Love &amp; Hope&quot; (2013): &quot;Didn&#x27;t Mean to Fall in Love&quot; was remastered, &quot;Someone&quot; was rearranged and re-recorded as &quot;Someone (2.0)&quot;, and an original version of &quot;I Had a Good Time&quot;, &quot;Te Quiero Mia&quot;, was included as a bonus track.

==Reception==

&quot;The Deseret News&quot; said the &quot;Corporate America&quot; is a typical Boston album and isn&#x27;t as good as their previous ones. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said the album is full of &quot;overblown prog-rock pomp and hackneyed sentiments&quot;. &quot;The Vindicator&quot; named the album 2002&#x27;s &quot;most dismal rock record&quot; along with Bon Jovi&#x27;s &quot;Bounce&quot;. &quot;The Village Voice&quot; compared the album stylistically to Def Leppard and called it &quot;sweet-sounding, brawny pop-metal&quot;. &quot;AllMusic&quot; contrasted the album&#x27;s fresh, energetic sound to &quot;downscale aesthetic of post-punk&quot;. In a retrospective, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; noted the songs as &quot;not memorable enough&quot; and Delp&#x27;s vocals as &quot;underutilised&quot;. Looking back, Scholz called the album &quot;a disaster&quot; and &quot;an experiment that didn’t work&quot;. Scholz felt it was a mistake to let other people get more involved in the writing and recording process.

The album charted at #42 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and by December 2002 had sold 60,000 copies. In 2003, Scholz sued Artemis for failing to promote the album properly.

<text>The Lincoln, sometimes called the Lincoln Longwool, is a breed of sheep from England. The Lincoln is the largest British sheep, developed specifically to produce the heaviest, longest and most lustrous fleece of any breed in the world. Great numbers were exported to many countries to improve the size and wool quality of their native breeds. The versatile fleece is in great demand for spinning, weaving and many other crafts.

It is now one of Britain&#x27;s rarer breeds, categorized as &quot;at risk&quot; by the Rare Breeds Survival Trust since there are fewer than 1500 registered breeding females in the United Kingdom.

==Characteristics==
Mature rams weigh from , and mature ewes will range in weight from . Fleece of the Lincoln is carried in heavy locks that are often twisted into a spiral near the end. The staple length in Lincolns is among the longest of all the breeds, ranging from with a yield of 65 to 80%. Lincolns produce the heaviest and coarsest fleeces of the long-wooled sheep with ewe fleeces weighing from . The fleece has a numeric count of 36&#x27;s – 46&#x27;s and ranges from 41.0 to 33.5 microns in diameter. Although coarse and somewhat hair-like, the fleece does have considerable luster.

<text>Mount Tasman (&quot;Te Horokōau&quot; in Māori) is New Zealand&#x27;s second-highest mountain, rising to a height of . It is located in the Southern Alps of the South Island, four kilometres to the north of its larger neighbour, Aoraki / Mount Cook. Unlike Aoraki / Mount Cook, Mount Tasman sits on the South Island&#x27;s Main Divide, on the border between Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park and Westland Tai Poutini National Park. It is the highest point in Westland District.

The first ascent of Mount Tasman was in 1895 by Edward FitzGerald and his guide Matthias Zurbriggen.

The Māori name (horo: to swallow; koau: shag or &quot;Phalacrocorax varius&quot;) is believed to refer to the swelling in the neck of a shag when it is swallowing a fish.

==Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park==

Mount Tasman is located in Aoraki / Mount Cook National Park in the Canterbury Region, which was established in 1953 and along with Westland Tai Poutini National Park, Mount Aspiring National Park and Fiordland National Park forms one of the UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

<doc id="1106908" wikidata="Q617920" url="?curid=1106908" title="János Starker">
<text>János Starker (; ; July 5, 1924 – April 28, 2013) was a Hungarian-American cellist. From 1958 until his death, he taught at the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music, where he held the title of Distinguished Professor. Starker is considered one of the greatest cellists of all time.

== Biography ==

=== Child prodigy ===
Starker was born in Budapest to a father of Polish descent and a mother who had immigrated from the Russian Empire, both Jewish. His two older brothers were violinists, and the young János (named for the hospital &quot;Szent János kórház&quot; [lit. &quot;St. John&#x27;s Hospital&quot;] in which he was born) was given a cello before his sixth birthday. A child prodigy, Starker made his first public performances at ages six and seven. He entered the Franz Liszt Academy of Music in Budapest to study with Adolf Schiffer and made his debut there at age 11. Starker began teaching other children at age eight, and by the time he was 12, he had five pupils. Starker counted among his strongest influences Leo Weiner, a composer who taught chamber music. Zoltán Kodály, Béla Bartók and Ernő Dohnányi were also members of the Liszt Academy faculty. In his autobiography, Starker wrote that at the age of 13 he played Dohnányi&#x27;s Konzertstuck for Cello for the composer (who was then the director of the Academy), who accompanied him at the piano.

Starker made his professional debut at age 14, playing the Dvořák concerto with three hours&#x27; notice when the originally scheduled soloist was unable to play. He left the Liszt Academy in 1939 and spent most of the war in Budapest. Because of his youth, Starker escaped the tragic fate of his older brothers, who were pressed into forced labor and eventually murdered by the Nazis. Starker nevertheless spent three months in a Nazi internment camp.

=== Professional career ===

After the war, Starker became principal cellist of the Budapest Opera and the Budapest Philharmonic Orchestra. Starker left Hungary in 1946.

He gave a successful concert in Vienna, then remained there to prepare for the Geneva Cello Competition. At the competition, held in October 1946, he received a bronze medal.

After competing in Geneva, Starker spent a year working on his technique in Paris. &quot;I played like a blind man,&quot; he said. &quot;What happens to the bird who flies and doesn&#x27;t know how it flies? That&#x27;s what happens to child prodigies.&quot; At the conclusion of his year in Paris, he made his first recording of Kodaly&#x27;s Sonata in B minor for solo cello. The recording earned him the Grand Prix du Disque. He went on to make three more recordings of the work.

Starker emigrated to the United States in 1948 to become principal cellist of the Dallas Symphony Orchestra under Antal Doráti. In 1949, he moved to New York City to become principal cellist of the Metropolitan Opera under Fritz Reiner. It was in New York that Starker made the first of his recordings of the Bach Cello Suites.

In 1953, Starker became principal cellist of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra when Fritz Reiner became the music director. In 1958, Starker moved to Bloomington, Indiana, where he settled for the rest of his life. At the Indiana University Jacobs School of Music he became a professor and resumed his solo career. His students included Tsuyoshi Tsutsumi, Maria Kliegel, Emilio W. Colón and Gary Hoffman.

== Recorded repertoire ==

Starker made over 150 recordings. He recorded the Bach solo cello suites five times, most recently for RCA Victor Red Seal in 1997 for which he won a Grammy Award. He was also nominated for a Grammy Award for his 1989 recording of the works of David Popper. He had concerti written for him by David Baker, Antal Doráti, Bernhard Heiden, Jean Martinon, Miklós Rózsa, and Robert Starer. He twice recorded the Konzertstück for Cello and Orchestra by Ernő Dohnányi, the work he had played at age 13 with the composer: first, in 1956/57, with the Philharmonia Orchestra led by Walter Susskind, and the composer in attendance for all sessions (the composer was &quot;angry&quot; that the producer, Walter Legge, had insisted on cutting &quot;the orchestra tutti at the start of part three&quot; ); and second, without cuts, with the Seattle Symphony Orchestra led by Gerard Schwarz in 1990.

== Cellos ==
From 1950 to 1965, Starker played and recorded on the &quot;Lord Aylesford Stradivarius&quot;, the largest instrument made by Antonio Stradivarius. In 1965 Starker acquired a Matteo Goffriller cello believed to have been made in Venice in 1705; known previously as the &quot;Ivor James Goffriller&quot; cello, Starker renamed it for its certification as &quot;The Star&quot; cello.

== Reviews and published works ==

Many documentaries, articles in magazines, and newspaper stories have acknowledged János Starker&#x27;s virtuosity. He published numerous books and musical scores through Peer International, Schirmer, and International Music. His autobiography, &quot;The World of Music According to Starker&quot;, was published in 2004 by Indiana University Press.

== Playing style ==

Starker&#x27;s playing style was intense and involved great technical mastery. According to some of his students, his technique revolved around long, legato notes, with very little shifting noise from his left hand, resulting in smooth, pure tones, &quot;each note sounding like a jewel.&quot; Starker himself described his sound as &quot;centered&quot; and &quot;focused.&quot; He was known for his ability to produce an extremely wide range of sounds and tone shading. He eschewed the wide vibrato favored by some of his peers—which he viewed as a cover for poor intonation—and was known for his patrician stage presence, preferring to let the music do the emoting. He quoted his long-time friend and colleague, György Sebők, who said, &quot;Create excitement. Don&#x27;t get excited.&quot;

== Personal habits ==
Starker was a lifelong smoker with a 60-cigarette-per-day habit. He also drank copious amounts of scotch whisky. He once refused to perform a concert in Columbia, South Carolina, that he was supposed to play because he was not allowed to smoke his &quot;pre-concert cigarette&quot; backstage.

<doc id="1106914" wikidata="Q4943725" url="?curid=1106914" title="Boonville (novel)">
<text>Boonville is a novel by Robert Mailer Anderson. It was published by Creative Arts Book Company (in association with &quot;Zyzzyva&quot; magazine, as a &quot;&quot;Zyzzyva&quot; First Novel&quot;) in 2001, then reprinted by HarperCollins in 2003. It is a San Francisco Chronicle Best Seller and was called one of the &quot;Top 10 Literary Events of 2001.&quot;

==Synopsis==
The novel tells the story of John Gibson, as he breaks up with his girlfriend and leaves Miami, Florida to move to the small town of Boonville, California, where he meets the resident of a commune, Sarah McKay. The book portrays the town in an often comedic manner, bringing to life a number of colorful Mendocino County residents including hippies, rednecks, feminists, and commercial marijuana cultivation.

==Author comments==
Anderson states in the book&#x27;s preface, &quot;So, any of the local residents who can read, and do read this novel, and take offense at the descriptions or content, instead of sucker-punching me while I&#x27;m in town trying to buy groceries with my wife and son, let me just buy you a drink and we&#x27;ll call it even. As for the hippies in the county who may be upset at the depiction of hippies, I say, &#x27;Tough shit, hippie.&#x27;&quot;

<text>The International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) is a public university in Malaysia. Headquartered in Gombak, Selangor, IIUM has six other campuses all over Malaysia: two medical-centric campuses and a Centre for Foundation Studies in Gambang, Pahang, two city campuses in Kuala Lumpur, and a language and tourism campus in Pagoh, Johor.

The university is sponsored by eight governments and the Organisation of the Islamic Cooperation (OIC). It is distinct from the International Islamic University, Indonesia and International Islamic University Chittagong, Bangladesh.

The university was established on 23 May 1983 and founded upon Islamic principles. Islamic values are inculcated into all disciplines. IIUM offers bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees courses at its 14 faculties or &quot;Kulliyyah&quot; (&quot;Kulliyyat&quot;, in plural).

Since 1987, IIUM has produced more than 70,000 graduates and undergraduates from more than 100 countries around the world. Most of them were from Malaysia.

==History==
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad conceived the idea for an international institution of Islamic education in 1982 during a meeting between OIC leaders about the Islamization of knowledge. The idea was shared with the then-minister of education, Sulaiman Daud; the then-director-general of education, Murad Mohamed Nor; and two others. Mohamed Kamal Hassan, then of the National University of Malaysia, along with a senior academic official who attended the meeting, produced the first working paper on the concept of the university.

Ismail al-Faruqi, a prominent scholar, played a significant role in this movement. He advised political leaders in the Muslim world, including Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in Pakistan and Mahathir Mohamad. During Zia-ul-Haq’s administration, al-Faruqi contributed to the establishment of the International Islamic University in Islamabad in 1980, which aimed to integrate Islamic values with contemporary academic disciplines. In Malaysia, al-Faruqi&#x27;s advisory role was instrumental in the foundation of the university in 1983. These institutions were part of broader efforts to develop educational systems that combined religious and secular knowledge, fostering intellectual and cultural development in the Muslim world.

The university would be the first Islamic university in the world to conceptualize the &quot;integration of knowledge with morals,&quot; a concept adopted at the International Convention of Islamic Education in Mecca, Saudi Arabia in 1976.

IIUM was once a private university. As the university&#x27;s language of instruction was not to be Malay but instead English and Arabic, which was initially prohibited by Malaysian law, IIUM was initially incorporated under the currently repealed Companies Act 1965. However, IIUM was officially made a public university on 23 May 1983, by Section 5A (2) of the Universities and University Colleges Act 1971, when the university received its establishment order from the then King, Ahmad Shah of Pahang, after an exchange of diplomatic notes of co-sponsorship between the government of Malaysia, seven other governments and OIC.

A batch of 153 students from Malaysia and abroad were enrolled for the first academic session, which started on 8 July 1983. Courses were conducted under the Faculty of Economics, the Faculty of Laws, the Centre for Fundamental Knowledge, and the Centre for Languages. The members of this first batch received their degrees and diplomas during the first convocation held on 10 October 1987. 68 graduates were conferred the degree of Bachelor of Economics, 56 other graduates received the degree of Bachelor of Laws, and 29 Qadhis were conferred Diploma in Law and Administration of Islamic Judiciary.

==Governance==
Ahmad Shah of Pahang was the founding constitutional head since 1 July 1983. Before his death, he was replaced by his daughter-in-law, the current Tengku Ampuan of Pahang, Tunku Azizah Aminah Maimunah Iskandariah. She was made the constitutional head on 12 April 2019 for a five-year term, ending her father-in-law&#x27;s chancellery in IIUM for 36 years, but the instrument of appointment was only presented to her by the federal government on 17 June 2019.

Mohd. Daud Bakar, an Islamic finance expert in Malaysia, sits as the eighth and current president since 1 July 2019.

<text>Courchevel () is a French Alps ski resort located in the Tarentaise Valley. It is a part of Les Trois Vallées, the largest linked ski areas in the world.

Courchevel also refers to the towns of Courchevel 1300 (Le Praz), Courchevel 1550, Courchevel 1650 (Moriond), and Courchevel 1850, which are named for their altitudes in metres. The resort centre of Courchevel is at 1,747 metres (5,732 ft).

Sports events from the 1992 Winter Olympics and the 2023 World Ski Championships took place in Courchevel.
The ski resort is considered exclusive, attracting wealthy clientele including royal families. It hosts one of the largest concentrations of 5-star ranking luxury hotels.

==Location==
Courchevel used to be part of the commune of Saint-Bon-Tarentaise but in 2017 it was merged with La Perrière into the new commune of Courchevel. In spite of the name, the commune&#x27;s administrative offices are not located in Courchevel, but still in the nearby village of Saint-Bon-Tarentaise. Courchevel is in the Tarentaise Valley, Savoie &quot;département&quot;, Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes region. Courchevel is part of the Trois Vallées, which comprises the resorts of Courchevel, La Tania, Méribel, Les Menuires-Saint Martin, Val Thorens and Orelle.

==History==

The original resort was planned during World War II with a study in 1942 by the Vichy regime and in a doctorate by the town planner Laurent Chappis. Chappis was a natural choice to direct the development of the resort in the immediate post-war years. Courchevel 1850 was significant as it was the first resort in France to be constructed from scratch, rather than based around an existing village.

===Tarentaise Valley Skiing===
Within the Tarentaise Valley lies the biggest concentration of world-class ski resorts in the world. The most widely-known neighbour systems are Paradiski (Les Arcs, La Plagne) and Espace Killy (Val d&#x27;Isère and Tignes). A weekly lift ticket in Courchevel/Les Trois Vallées gives one a choice to ski one day in each of the other two systems mentioned. There were once plans to interlink all systems and resorts to create the largest ski area in the world (by far); however, that vision ended with the creation of the Vanoise National Park.

===1992 Winter Olympics===
The Courchevel valley also includes the town of La Tania, built as competitors&#x27; accommodation for the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville. Le Praz hosted the Olympic ski jumping and Nordic combined competitions for those games that took place at Tremplin du Praz. There was a ski jump in Courchevel 1850 on the snowfront, which was removed recently due to safety precautions.

=== 2019 fire ===
During the early hours of 20 January 2019, an inferno ignited within a structure located in the hamlet of Courchevel 1850, designated for seasonal resort workers. This unfortunate event claimed the lives of two individuals and left at least 22 others with injuries. As documented by a local French newspaper, a rapid and coordinated response from 130 firefighters played a pivotal role in mitigating the emergency, underscoring their crucial efforts in containing the fire&#x27;s impact on the community.

=== 2023 Alpine Ski World Championships ===
In May 2018, Courchevel was named a joint host of the 2023 FIS Alpine World Ski Championships with Méribel. It was the first time since 2009 that France had hosted the FIS World Championships, when they took place in Val d&#x27;Isère. Races in Courchevel will finish in Courchevel Le Praz. A new super-leisure centre called L&#x27;Alpinium is under construction in Le Praz and will improve connections to Courchevel 1850 and provide more parking.

==Resort==

Courchevel is the most eastern resort of the Three Valleys, the biggest connected ski area in the world. It consists of four satellite villages: Courchevel Le Praz, Courchevel 1550, Courchevel 1650 and Courchevel 1850. Its highest resort, Courchevel 1850, is considered exclusive, attracting wealthy clientele including royal families. In the 2011–2012 season, Courchevel rebranded, changing the names of each of the four villages in a move away from the association with altitude. Courchevel 1850 is now known simply as Courchevel, Courchevel 1650 was renamed Courchevel Moriond; Courchevel 1550 is now called Courchevel Village and Courchevel 1330 was renamed Courchevel Le Praz.

Courchevel has 24 luxury hotels with a 5-star ranking. In 2011 France introduced a 6th star ranking for hotels, named &quot;palaces&quot;. Eight hotels in France have received this rating, of which two are in Courchevel&#x27;s Jardin Alpin area. The resort has seven restaurants with Michelin stars, of which four have two stars, including Le Chabichou. It also hosts a variety of luxury shops including Louis Vuitton, Hermès, Valentino, Loro Piana, Prada, Cartier, Fendi, Dior and Chanel. The majority of Courchevel&#x27;s visitors are Gulf Arabs and Russian all of whom are considered luxury clientele. Many Russians visit during New Year and Russian Orthodox Christmas on 7 January. As a result, the first two weeks of January are high season weeks in Courchevel. The resort is also very popular with Arabs, especially those from the Middle East. As a result of this popularity the resort&#x27;s name is now associated with the super-rich in Russia and Middle East. The most expensive pharmacy in France is located in Courchevel.

Courchevel has one of the largest bases for ski instructors and other seasonal workers due to the size of the three valleys area. Courchevel&#x27;s couloirs are considered some of the most difficult black runs in the world. Courchevel, along with the Three Vallees, is renowned for a wide selection of difficult pistes and off-piste, powder skiing.

Courchevel&#x27;s sister city is Park City, Utah in the United States, and it has a red-graded ski piste named &quot;Park City&quot;.

==Airport==
Courchevel&#x27;s airport has a very short and steeply sloped runway, with a length of and a gradient of 18.5%. The airport has a dangerous approach through deep valleys, which can only be performed by specially certified pilots. On landing there is no go-around procedure, as most of the world&#x27;s airports have; there is merely a very steep hill which has seen a few accidents since the airport first opened. Larger propeller aircraft such as the Twin Otter and Dash 7 (carrying up to 50 people) have been regular users of the airport over the years, but have since been phased out of use and smaller Cessnas and helicopters are now the main users.

The History Channel program &quot;Most Extreme Airports&quot;, ranks it as the 7th most dangerous airport in the world.

<text>Dufile (also Dufilé, Duffli, Duffle, or Dufli) was originally a fort built by Emin Pasha, the Governor of Equatoria, in 1879; it is located on the Albert Nile just inside Uganda, close to a site chosen in 1874 by then-Colonel Charles George Gordon to assemble steamers that were carried there overland. Abandoned by Emin&#x27;s people in January 1889, Dufile being within the Lado Enclave was reoccupied and reconstructed by Belgian forces from 1902 to 1907.

Today the name Dufile is applied to a nearby Madi village and sub-county in Moyo District to the east of Laropi. The name Dufile itself is a corruption of the Madi village name Odrupele. Emin and A.J. Mounteney Jephson were confined in the fort during a mutiny in 1888. There followed the Battle of Dufile when the former mutineers, after releasing Emin and Jephson, rallied to fight Mahdist forces.

Dufile was visited by Alan Moorehead while he was researching his book &quot;The White Nile&quot;, published in 1960. The fort was surveyed in July 1965 by a student team from Imperial College. The fort, where a ditch and bank enclose an area of 12 acres (4.8 hectares), can be reached by road or boat from Laropi. Archaeological work was done between December 2006 and January 2007 by an international team and recommendations on conservation of the site are on file. Emin&#x27;s old harbour is now the departure point for passenger ferries to Nimule in South Sudan.

<text>The Amable du Fond River is a river in Nipissing District, in Northern Ontario, Canada.

The river is named after Amable Dufond, a Native hunter and trapper who lived in this area in the mid-19th century. At one time, the river was used to transport logs downstream to the Mattawa River. A timber slide was built to bypass the rapids at the Eau Claire Gorge.

Many canoe trippers use the river as an access point to enter Algonquin Park. However, this route is technically difficult, and requires advanced canoeing skills due to low summer water flow and unmaintained portages and campsites. The park has an access point located on Kawawaymog (Round Lake), from the access point it is just a short paddle and portage into Algonquin Provincial Park.

==Geography==
The Amable du Fond River flows from Pipe Lake through Kawawaymog, North Tea, Manitou, and Kioshkokwi Lakes in northwestern Algonquin Park to join the Mattawa River on the south side of Samuel de Champlain Provincial Park. It is long and drops over its course.

The Amable du Fond River is the remnant of a short-lived drainage of glacial Lake Algonquin into the Mattawa River valley. It is the largest tributary of the Mattawa River.

==Eau Claire Gorge==
The Eau Claire Gorge is a cascade where the Amable du Fond flows between high rock walls in a series of rapids and waterfalls, dropping over . It is protected in the Eau Claire Gorge Conservation Area, which was purchased by the North Bay-Mattawa Conservation Authority in 1976. There is a long trail to view the gorge and conservation area.

==Amable du Fond River Provincial Park==
The Amable du Fond River Provincial Park is a waterway park that protects several non-contiguous sections of the river and its banks. It also includes some portions of the shores of Smith Lake. It was established in 2006 and is meant to provide a canoe route between Algonquin and Samuel de Champlain Parks. Other activities include hunting, wildlife/nature viewing, and off-roading with ATV&#x27;s and snowmobiles.

The park features a marsh-fen complex to the north of Smith Lake, as well as balsam fir-spruce, intolerant hardwood, and red pine-spruce scrubland on the shores of Smith Lake and near Crooked Chute Lake. Its vegetation includes black spruce-white cedar-tamarack bottomland, as well as intolerant hardwoods, mixed conifer, cedar-alder stands, and a riverine wetland complex in the southern portion of the park.

It is a non-operating park, meaning that there are no facilities or services.

The Bargarh district lies in the Plain with Eastern Ghats running close to the town. As per the earthquake zoning of India, Bargarh falls in the zone 2 category, the least earthquake prone zone.

The nearest airport is at Raipur (CG) (220 km), Bhubaneswar (OD)(350 km) and Jharsuguda (OD)(110 km).

==History==

Bargarh is one of the many forts built by the Chouhan dynasty. Although no clear data is available about the settlement, the old fort walls can be traced near the &#x27;Jeera&#x27; river towards the plains of Ambapali. From an inscription of the 11th century AD, it is believed that the original name of the place was &quot;Bahgar Kota&quot;. Balaram Dev, the Chauhan king of Sambalpur ruled this province when it acquires the name &quot;Bargarh&quot;. He made it his headquarters for some time while the fort near the Jeera River was to be built. Narayan Singh, the last Chauhan King of Sambalpur gave the whole land of Bargarh to two Brahmin brothers Krushna Dash and Narayan Dash, son of Baluki Dash who was killed in action by the Gond Rebel led by Baldia Ray and Mahapatra Ray. The Padampur sub-division of bargarh, popularly known as the &quot;Borasambhar Region&quot; was the headquarters of the Zamindari extended over 2178 km2. This is the biggest sub-division of Bargarh District which has also a feudal history with a tribal leader.

Buddhism played a significant role in defining the lifestyle of the people for a short period of time. Some ancient Buddhist monasteries and sculptures can be seen along a belt starting from Bijepur block (Ganiapali) to the Paikamal block (Nrusinghanath), which has a clear mention in Huen-Tsang&#x27;s literature as Po-Lo-Mo-Lo-Ki-Li (Parimalagiri).

The legendary hero Veer Surendra Sai led his war against the British from Debrigarh, which is a peak on the Barapahad Range. His fight against the British Raj particularly after the First War of Independence in 1857 was remarkable in the history of freedom struggle in India (Pasayat and Singh, 2009; Panda and Pasayat, 2009). Debrigarh today is a tiger sanctuary. Barabakhra (12 caves) used to be a secret meeting place during this period.

Bargarh was a subdivision of old Sambalpur district until April 1992, when the then chief minister Mr. Biju Patnaik declared it as the headquarters of the newly formed district by the same name.

==Demographics==
As of the 2011 Census of India, Bargarh had a population of 83,651. Males constitute 52% of the population and females 48%. Bargarh has an average literacy rate of 76%, higher than the national average of 59.5%; with 57% of the males and 43% of females literate. 11% of the population is under 6 years of age.

Other than Oriya speaking people who form the majority, the town has some Marwari community who have migrated and settled down. Within the Oriya speaking population, the major communities are Kuiltas, Dumals, Agharias, Bhulia/Meher, Teli, etc. Kuiltas and Dumals are presumed to be an offshoot of the original Chasa (agrarian) community and are synonymous with the Khandayats of the coastal region. This is evident by the striking similarity of rituals and the gods they pray. Bhulias were migrated to and settled in this region by some rulers, but the exact time period is controversial. Agraria&#x27;s were migrated from the Mughal empire of Agra for establishing a cultivator community during the war when Kuiltas was assigned the duty of part-time Kshatriyas.

Oriya is the language for communication, official purposes and for education.

While flying above and proceeding toward Lanka (the kingdom of Ravana), a portion dropped down. Gandhamardan is synonymous with that portion only.

The Nrusinghnath temple is situated at its base. As the mountain range is famous for its rich fauna and flora. Govt. and private run many herbal gardens are situated near it. SSN Ayurveda College &amp; RI is situated near it, which is a premier Ayurveda Institute of western Odisha. The Lumbini Garden of the institute is one of the biggest herbal gardens in India with thousands of rare herbs.

=== Parimalagiri ===
Glowing tributes are paid to Hiuen T&#x27;sang, the champion Chinese traveler, who was attracted by the scenic splendor of Gandhamardan, during his tour to Dakhin Koshal (part of which is current Chhattisgarh and the bewitching colorful zone of Western Odisha). He has spoken of the flowering Buddhist University of Parimalagiri (&quot;po-lo-mo-lo-ki-li&quot;), which had its campus on the picturesque Gandhamardan hills.

===Ecological Pyramid===

Besides being home to more than 5000 rare medicinal herbs (some hitherto - unidentified), providing medicines for fatal diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, leprosy, filarial, epilepsy, asthma, kidney and liver dysfunctions even AIDS, Gandhamardan serves as a wildlife sanctuary for a large number of rare species of birds and animals and thereby donating its portions towards balancing the Global Ecological Pyramid.

===The Temple===

The foundation for the temple was laid down by Baijal Dev on 17 March 1413  AD. as per inscriptions. The temple of Lord Nrushinghnath is only high. It is divided into two parts; the first being the seat of the Lord – a short, raised narrow plinth and the other Jaga Mohan (the antechamber) having three gates and is supported by four pillars, the like found nowhere in Odisha. The rocks used in the Jaga Mohan pillars are of a rare kind. They are not seen in the Gandhamardan hills. Believed that, from far-off places, Baijal Dev had brought them. With a soft rubbing, these rocks begin to scintillate, to a degree. While entering the inner-sanctum, one can see the rock statues of Nav Grahas (the Nine planets of Astrology) in a line.

===Papaharini===

The main perennial flow of Gandhamardan is &quot;Papaharini&quot;, literally meaning, &quot;destroyer of sins&quot;. It is symbolic of Sanatan-the continuum of past, present, and future. Flowing out of the confluence of seven fountains, called &quot;Saptadhar&quot;– it has an average width of 12  ft. No man-made tributary can flow into it. Nothing can pollute or adulterate it. Running about 25  km it touched the Ang tributary and finally embraced Mahanadi.

===The Mighty Mandap===

Via Satyaam, as one goes from Nrusimhanath to Harishankar an old-patterned cave is caught in sight. It is just 10.5  km from the main temple, having dimensions of 150  ft. length, 50 ft. breadth and 25 ft. depth. This mighty structure resembles that of a typical Buddhist cave and prompts us to recall the description of a Buddha Vihar by Hiuen Tsang.

===Asta-Sambhu===

In the district of Bargarh, a large number of Siva temples were built during the Chauhan rule of the undivided Sambalpur. The most important among them were those of the Asta-Sambhu or 8 Siva Temples such as (1) Bimaleswar Temple at Huma (Sambalpur), (2) Kedarnath Temple at Ambabhona (Bargarh), (3) Baidyanath Temple at Deogaon (Bargarh), (4) Balunkeswar Temple at Gaisama (Bargarh), (5) Mandhata Baba Temple at Maneswar (Sambalpur), (6) Swapneswar Temple at Sorna (Bargarh), (7) Visweswar Temple at Soranda (Bargarh) and (8) Nilakantheswar Temple at Nilji (Bhatli). The Bimaleswar Temple at Huma on the Mahanadi was built by Maharaja Baliar Singh and the rest were built during the reign of Ajit Singh and his son Abhaya Singh.

Dadhibaman Mandir: Dadhibamana Mandir is situated at Bhatli- one of the Blocks of Bargarh District. Dadhibaman is a form of Lord Jagannath and a parallel car festival is organized accordingly. Bhatli is known as the Shreekhetra of Western Odisha and second Shreekhetra of Odisha State.

===Wild life Sanctuary Debrigarh===

A peak in the Barapahar hills in Bargarh sub-division having a height of . It was a noted rebel stronghold during the revolt of Balabhadra Deo, the Gond Zamindar of Lakhanpur, who was killed here. Mahapatra Ray and Baldia Ray also sought shelter here during 1840  AD after murdering Baluki Dash, the Maufidar of Bargarh. Veer Surendra Sai the freedom fighter was captured here in 1864 by British soldiers. There is a wildlife sanctuary here.

<text>The 1976 United States Senate elections was an election for the United States Senate. Held on November 2, the 33 seats of Class 1 were contested in regular elections. They coincided with Democrat Jimmy Carter&#x27;s presidential election and the United States Bicentennial celebration. Although almost half of the seats decided in this election changed parties, Carter&#x27;s narrow victory did not provide coattails for the Democratic Party. Each party flipped seven Senate seats, although, one of the seats flipped by Democrats was previously held by a Conservative.

This was the first election in which the Libertarian Party competed, running candidates in 9 of the 33 contested seats. this is the first and so far only time both party leaders retired from the Senate in the same election cycle since the creation of the positions. This is the last time Democrats or any party won a 60% supermajority via direct elections (although Democrats briefly held one in the summer of 2009).

(Jerry Litton had won the Democratic nomination earlier, but was killed in a plane crash, and Hearnes was chosen by the party committee.)



== Montana ==


Rather than seek a fifth term, Democratic incumbent Mike Mansfield opted to retire, creating an open seat. United States Congressman John Melcher, who had represented Montana&#x27;s 2nd congressional district from 1969 to 1977, won the Democratic nomination and defeated Stanley C. Burger, the Republican nominee and former executive officer of the Montana Farm Bureau Federation, by a wide margin in the general election.

Incumbent Democrat Howard Cannon won re-election to a fourth term over Republican David Towell, U.S. Representative from Nevada&#x27;s At-large congressional district.

In the Senate, Cannon was known as a moderate in the Democratic Party. He served as chairman of several committees, including the rules committee and the inaugural arrangements committee. Cannon was nearly defeated for re-election in 1964 by Republican Lieutenant Governor Paul Laxalt in one of the closest election in history. However, he became more popular over the next few years and won re-election in 1970 with nearly 58% of the vote. In 1976, he faced U.S. Representative David Towell, who served just one term in the U.S. House of Representatives before running for the U.S. Senate. Cannon won re-election with 63% of the vote, one of his best election performances of his career. He won every county in the state, except for Eureka County, which Towell won with just 51% of the vote.





== New Jersey ==
Harrison A. Williams, the incumbent originally elected in 1958, elected to run for a fourth term. He defeated anti-abortion activist Stephen J. Foley handily in the Democratic primary with 85% of the vote. David A. Norcross won the Republican primary with the endorsement of the New Jersey Republican Party with 68% of the vote.

In the general election, Williams soundly won re-election to a fourth term over Norcross. He won 60% of the vote, winning every county in the state. This would be Williams&#x27; last election to the U.S. Senate, as he would resign in 1981 following his involvement in the Abscam scandal.

Only Burdick filed as a Dem-NPLer, and the endorsed Republican candidate was Robert Stroup, as state senator from Hazen, North Dakota. Burdick and Stroup won the primary elections for their respective parties. One independent candidate, Clarence Haggard, also filed before the deadline under the American Party.




== Ohio ==


Incumbent Republican Robert Taft Jr. ran for re-election to second term, but was defeated by Democratic former senator Howard Metzenbaum.




== Pennsylvania ==


Incumbent Republican and Minority Leader Hugh Scott retired. Republican John Heinz won the open seat over Democrat Bill Green, United States Representative

In December 1975, U.S. senator Hugh Scott announced that he would not seek re-election in 1976 at the age of 75 after serving in Congress for 33 years. Scott listed personal reasons and several &quot;well-qualified potential candidates&quot; for the seat among the reasons of his decision to retire. Other reasons, including his support for Richard Nixon and accusations that he had illegally obtained contributions from Gulf Oil were alleged to have contributed to the decision.




Heinz was the victor in all but nine counties, defeating opponent William Green, who had a 300,000 vote advantage in his native Philadelphia area. Heinz and Green spend $2.5 million and $900,000, respectively, during the ten-month campaign. Much of the money Heinz spent on his campaign was his own, leading to accusations from Green that he was &quot;buying the seat&quot;. Heinz replied to this by claiming that the spending was necessary to overcome the Democratic voter registration advantage.





== Rhode Island ==

== Virginia ==


Incumbent Independent Harry F. Byrd Jr. was re-elected to a second term over retired Admiral Elmo Zumwalt and state legislator Martin H. Perper.




== Washington ==





== West Virginia ==

For most of the state&#x27;s history, West Virginia has been a solidly Democratic state. Often, winning the Democratic primary was tantamount to winning the general election in the state. Despite West Virginia occasionally electing a Republican governor (Arch A. Moore Jr. and Cecil H. Underwood both served as governor) and voting for Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, West Virginia has only elected Democratic Senators since 1958. Byrd had faced Republican opposition every term since he defeated Chapman Revercomb in 1958, but the Republicans chose not to mount a nominee in 1976. Freshman Congressman Cleve Benedict would serve as the Republican nominee in 1982.

== Wisconsin ==

Originally elected in 1957 to fill the seat of Joseph McCarthy, William Proxmire had won re-election three times prior to 1976. He only faced significant Republican opposition twice during his re-election years, winning 70% of the vote and every county in 1970. Clergyman Stanley York was the Republican nominee. Proxmire ultimately defeated York and increased his margin of victory by 4%. Proxmire would serve two more terms, ultimately retiring in 1989. 





== Wyoming ==
Gale W. McGee, the incumbent senator and former professor at the University of Wyoming, was originally elected in 1958 over Frank A. Barrett. He subsequently won two more elections to the senate over John S. Wold. McGee, who managed to become re-elected several times in a heavily Republican-leaning state, faced headwinds from Gerald Ford&#x27;s popularity in the state. State senator Malcolm Wallop was the Republican nominee. 

In the general election, Wallop comfortably defeated McGee, who won just four counties in the state. To date, McGee is the last Democratic senator from the state of Wyoming.

<text>Fonthill Gifford is a village and civil parish in Wiltshire, England, to the north of the Nadder valley, west of Salisbury.

== History ==

The name of the village and parish derives from the Giffard family, landowners, beginning with Berenger Giffard who was lord in 1086. The Marvyn family were lords of the manor from the fifteenth to the seventeenth century. Among them were Sir John Marvyn (c.1503–1566), MP and High Sheriff, who purchased the adjoining Compton Bassett manor; and his son James (1529–1611), also MP.

Fonthill then passed by marriage to George Tuchet, later Earl of Castlehaven. His son Mervyn was executed in 1631, and in the next year the estate was granted by the king to Baron Cottington, ambassador and Chancellor of the Exchequer. Apart from an interruption during the Civil War the estate continued with the Cottingtons until sold to William Beckford, future Lord Mayor of London, in 1745. His son, also William, built the grandiose Fonthill Abbey but was obliged to sell the estate in 1823, after which it was broken up.

The parish had 70 taxpayers in 1377. From the 16th century until the 20th, most of the population were employed by the parish&#x27;s wealthy households; 493 were recorded at the 1801 census, and numbers declined since then, reaching a new low of 102 in 2011.

=== 20th century ===
In 1944, the 55th Armored Infantry Battalion of 11th Armored Division of the United States Army trained for two months on Salisbury Plain and was encamped at Fonthill New Abbey and in Fonthill Park. In 2004 a plaque was added to the war memorial at Tisbury in their memory.

In 1952, John Morrison (later Baron Margadale) began to breed racehorses at 19th-century stables to the east of the village. His son James, 2nd Baron took over the Fonthill Stud in 1972, and breeding continues under Alastair, 3rd Baron. The stud has produced winners of several major races: the Nassau Stakes (Spree, 1963); the Oaks (Juliette Marny, 1975 and Scintillate, 1979); and the St Leger (Julio Mariner, 1978).

== Geography ==
Most dwellings, and the parish church, are along or near the minor road between Tisbury and Hindon. Greenwich hamlet lies north of the village. Woodland known as Fonthill Abbey Wood covers much of the south of the parish.

==Churches==
The Church of England parish church of Holy Trinity was built in 1864–66 to designs by the Gothic Revival architect T.H. Wyatt and is Grade II* listed. Pevsner wrote that the church: &quot;groups extremely picturesquely from the E, with its NE tower with a spire rising between pyramid pinnacles, an apse, and a round turret to its N.&quot; Today the church is part of the Nadder Valley Team Ministry.

Wyatt&#x27;s church replaced a neoclassical church built in 1747–49 for Alderman Beckford, near the parish boundary where the Hindon – Tisbury and Fonthill Bishop – Semley roads cross. This in turn was a replacement for an older church, said in 1566 to have been dedicated to St Nicholas, that stood near the stream in the north-east quarter of the parish, close to the now-demolished Fonthill House.

==Houses on the Fonthill estate==
An early house was damaged by fire in 1624 or 1625 and was bought by Lord Cottington in 1632, who by 1637 had finished restoring it, and may have used the services of Inigo Jones.

Around 1715, Cottington put a classical façade on the house and removed the formal gardens. Between 1745 and 1753 William Beckford re-aligned the estate, making the main entrances to the north and the south. He added a five-arched bridge over the lake, placed a folly on the high ground to the west of the house and demolished the old parish church.

Fonthill House burnt down in 1755 and was replaced with a new one, Fonthill Splendens, built for Beckford to the south of the old one. The design of the house was initially based on Houghton Hall in Norfork. Those involved in the rebuilding project included Robert Adam, Sir John Soane and James Wyatt, Andrea Casali, J. F. Moon, Thomas Banks, and John Bacon the elder. An archway with two lodges, built c. 1756, spans the estate&#x27;s northern entrance road. This house was inherited in 1770 by Beckford&#x27;s son, William Thomas Beckford, who extended the lake and built grottoes on the lakeside.

In the 1790s Beckford began to build Fonthill Abbey, on high ground a mile to the southwest, and he had parts of the house demolished to provide building material. The west portion of the house survived, becoming known as The Pavilion, and was bought around 1829 by James Morrison, the millionaire draper and railway investor. His second son, Alfred, added one storey and an Italianate tower. The house was demolished in 1921 except for the west service wing which was converted into cottages that were demolished in 1975.

In 1904 a new house was designed by Detmar Blow for Hugh Morrison on land to the east in the parish of Chilmark; at first known as Little Ridge, it was enlarged in 1921 and became known as Fonthill House. In 1972 it was replaced by a smaller house, still the seat of the Morrison family. As of 2013 the estate amounted to .
==Fonthill Abbey==

Fonthill Abbey was an enormous mansion southwest of the village, in the style of a medieval abbey. Built by William Beckford between 1796 and 1813, the rest of the building was damaged by the collapse of the main tower in 1825, and almost wholly demolished by 1845; a habitable fragment remains. The site is marked on maps as Old Fonthill Abbey.

The western part of Beckford&#x27;s estate was later acquired by the 2nd Marquess of Westminster, who had a new Fonthill Abbey built in 1846-52 (Pevsner) or 1856-59 (VCH), some 500 metres southeast of the site of Beckford&#x27;s abbey. This mansion, designed by William Burn in Scottish Baronial style, was demolished in 1955.

==Local government==
The civil parish elects a parish council. It is in the area of Wiltshire Council unitary authority, which is responsible for all significant local government functions.

In 1934 the northwest portion of the parish, about one-fifth of its area, was transferred to Hindon parish.

<doc id="1106979" wikidata="Q4347733" url="?curid=1106979" title="1974 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1974 United States Senate elections were held on November 5, with the 34 seats of Class 3 contested in regular elections. They occurred in the wake of the Watergate scandal, Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s resignation from the presidency, and Gerald Ford&#x27;s subsequent pardon of Nixon. Economic issues, specifically inflation and stagnation, were also a factor that contributed to Republican losses. As an immediate result of the November 1974 elections, Democrats made a net gain of three seats from the Republicans, as they defeated Republican incumbents in Colorado and Kentucky and picked up open seats in Florida and Vermont, while Republicans won the open seat in Nevada. Following the elections, at the beginning of the 94th U.S. Congress, the Democratic caucus controlled 60 seats (as well as one independent), and the Republican caucus controlled 38 seats (as well as one Conservative).

Democrats gained an additional seat, bringing the net pick-up to four seats, in 1975, when Democrat John A. Durkin won a disputed election in New Hampshire that was unintentionally held after the 1974 election resulted in two recounts and an extended dispute in the Senate. Durkin&#x27;s Senate term began in September 1975, following his victory in that election. , this is the most recent election in which a Democrat has been elected Senator from Idaho. 

Several other Republican incumbents won very close races; Milton Young of North Dakota won reelection against Democrat William L. Guy by only 186 votes and Henry Bellmon of Oklahoma won reelection against Democrat Ed Edmondson by half a percent of the vote. Bob Dole of Kansas survived the closest election of his career against Democratic Rep. William Roy, a race undoubtedly made close due to Dole&#x27;s close association with Nixon as chairman of the Republican National Committee. It was the closest the Democrats have come to winning a Senate election in Kansas since George McGill won re-election in 1932.

== Closest races ==

In fourteen races the margin of victory was under 10%.

Illinois was the tipping point state with a margin of 25%.

== Alabama ==

Democratic United States senator James Allen won re-election to a second term, faced no Republican opponent in the general election, defeating Prohibition Party nominee Alvin Abercrombie.




== Alaska ==


Incumbent Democrat Mike Gravel won re-election to a second term over Republican State Senator Clyde &quot;C.R.&quot; Lewis.




== Arizona ==

Incumbent Republican Barry Goldwater decided to run for reelection to a fourth term, after returning to the U.S. Senate in 1968 following his failed Presidential run in 1964 against Lyndon B. Johnson. Goldwater defeated Democratic Party nominee philanthropist Jonathan Marshall in the general election.





== Arkansas ==

Incumbent Democrat J. William Fulbright lost renomination to Governor of Arkansas Dale Bumpers. Bumpers then won the general election easily.






== California ==

Incumbent Democrat Alan Cranston won re-election to a second term over Republican H. L. Richardson, California State Senator.




== Colorado ==

Incumbent Republican Peter H. Dominick ran for re-election to a third term, but was defeated by Democratic challenger Gary Hart, the campaign manager for George McGovern in 1972.




== Connecticut ==

Incumbent Democrat Abraham Ribicoff won re-election to a third term over Republican challenger James Brannen III.





== Florida ==

Incumbent Republican Edward Gurney declined to seek a second term after being indicted for taking bribes in return for his influence with the Federal Housing Administration.

The primary for the Republican nomination pitted Eckerd drug store owner Jack Eckerd against Florida Public Service Commissioner Paula Hawkins. Eckerd won handily, receiving approximately 67.5% of the vote.


The Democratic primary, however, was a crowded field with eleven candidates vying for the nomination. Because no candidate received a majority of the votes, U.S. Representative Bill Gunter and Secretary of State of Florida Richard Stone advanced to a run-off election. Stone won by a small margin of 1.68%.







Thus, Eckerd and Stone faced off in the general election. John Grady, a family physician and member of George Wallace&#x27;s American Independent Party, performed exceptionally well for a third party candidate. Grady may have split the conservative vote, allowing for Stone to win. On election day, Stone received 43.38% of the vote, Eckerd garnered 40.91% of the vote, and Grady acquired 15.7% of the vote.





== Georgia ==

Incumbent Democrat Herman Talmadge won re-election to a fourth term over Republican challenger Jerry Johnson.



== Hawaii ==

Incumbent Democrat Daniel Inouye won re-election to a third term over Populist challenger James D. Kimmel.




== Idaho ==

Incumbent Democrat Frank Church won re-election to a fourth term in office, defeating Republican Bob Smith.



== Illinois ==

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Adlai Stevenson III, who was first elected in a special election in 1970, was re-elected to a second term in office, defeating Republican George Burditt by a large margin of nearly 800,000 votes.




== Indiana ==

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Birch Bayh was re-elected to a third consecutive term in office, defeating Mayor of Indianapolis Richard Lugar.



== Iowa ==

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Harold E. Hughes retired instead of seeking a second term. This open seat was won by five-term U.S. Representative John C. Culver, defeating Republican State Representative David M. Stanley. Culver defeated Stanley by a margin of nearly five points.




== Kansas ==

U.S. Senator Bob Dole was first elected in 1968 after Frank Carlson retired by a margin of 60-39% over his Democratic opponent. However, in 1974 he faced a closer challenge as he sought a second term. Dole was closely associated with Richard Nixon as chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1971-1972. Dole himself even admitted he was &quot;prepared to lose&quot; the election to William R. Roy, a Topeka physician and two-term Representative from Kansas&#x27;s 2nd Congressional District. Roy&#x27;s advertisements contrasted Dole, &quot;who put loyalty to Nixon and his party ahead of loyalty to his state,&quot; with Roy, a moderate and former Republican whom they described as &quot;a respected voice for Kansas.&quot; Roy&#x27;s campaign to be the first Democratic Senator from Kansas in decades received an enthusiastic response, and he led in polling for months. &quot;I could go to any event and feel like Caesar coming back to Rome,&quot; Roy said. Still, Dole&#x27;s campaign capitalized on the issue of abortion rights, which was fresh on voters minds in the wake of the Roe v. Wade decision. Roy himself had performed abortions as a physician, and Dole used this to build momentum and overtake Roy in polling.

In the end, Dole narrowly prevailed over Roy by 15,533 votes in the closest election of his 35-year Congressional career. 




== Kentucky ==

Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Marlow Cook ran for a second term in office but was defeated by Democratic Governor of Kentucky Wendell Ford.



== Louisiana ==

Incumbent Democratic Senator Russell B. Long was unopposed for re-election to a sixth term in office.




== Maryland ==

Incumbent Republican Charles Mathias won re-election to a second term. As a Republican representing heavily-Democratic Maryland, Mathias faced a potentially difficult re-election bid for the 1974 election. State Democrats nominated Barbara Mikulski, then a Baltimore City Councilwoman who was well-known to residents in her city as a social activist, but with limited name recognition in the rest of the state. Mathias was renominated by Republicans, fending off a primary election challenge from conservative doctor Ross Pierpont. Pierpont was never a substantial threat to Mathias, whose lack of competition was due in part to fallout from the Watergate scandal.

As an advocate for campaign finance reform, Mathias refused to accept any contribution over $100 to &quot;avoid the curse of big money that has led to so much trouble in the last year&quot;. However, he still managed to raise over $250,000, nearly five times Mikulski&#x27;s total. Ideologically, Mikulski and Mathias agreed on many issues, such as closing tax loopholes and easing taxes on the middle class. On two issues, however, Mathias argued to reform Congress and the U.S. tax system to address inflation and corporate price fixing, contrary to Mikulski. In retrospect, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt the election was &quot;an intelligent discussion of state, national, and foreign affairs by two smart, well-informed people&quot;.




== Missouri ==
Thomas Eagleton was first elected in 1968, defeating incumbent U.S. senator Edward V. Long in an upset three-way primary victory. He then defeated Republican Representative Thomas B. Curtis by just over two percentage points. Eagleton served as the initial vice presidential nominee for George McGovern&#x27;s campaign against incumbent Richard Nixon in 1972. However, Eagleton resigned from the ticket and was replaced by Sargent Shriver after reports surfaced that Eagleton had received electroshock therapy for clinical depression. McGovern, who was trailing Nixon badly in the polls, requested Eagleton&#x27;s resignation. 

Despite negative publicity from his vice presidential nomination withdrawal, Eagleton cruised to re-election in a rematch over Curtis, taking over 60% of the vote. This would be Eagleton&#x27;s largest victory margin for U.S. Senate. In 1980, he faced a close re-election battle against Gene McNary, winning by only about 5 percentage points.



== Nevada ==

Incumbent Democrat Alan Bible decided to retire instead of seeking a fifth term. Republican nominee Paul Laxalt won the open seat.

Former Governor Paul Laxalt won by less than 700 votes, becoming one of the few bright spots in a bad year for Republicans. He beat Lieutenant Governor Harry Reid. Reid would succeed Laxalt twelve years later.



== New Hampshire ==

The New Hampshire election resulted in the longest contested election for the U.S. Congress in United States history.

In 1973, then-incumbent senator Norris Cotton announced he would not seek re-election. Republican strategists admitted that it would be tough for their party to hold on to the seat.

The campaign of 1974 pitted Democrat John A. Durkin, who had served as New Hampshire&#x27;s Insurance Commissioner and as Attorney General, against Republican Louis C. Wyman, a conservative, widely known member of the United States House of Representatives from New Hampshire&#x27;s 1st congressional district. As Wyman was the more experienced politician, he was predicted by many to win handily.

On election day, Wyman won with a margin of just 355 votes. Durkin immediately demanded a recount, which, completed November 27, 1974, declared Durkin the winner by a margin of 10 votes. Republican Governor Meldrim Thomson Jr. awarded Durkin a provisional certificate of election. However, Wyman demanded another recount in which he prevailed by two votes.



Wyman promptly appealed to the New Hampshire State Ballot Law Commission. Durkin tried to defeat the appeal in the New Hampshire courts. The state ballot commission conducted its own partial recount and announced on December 24, 1974, that Wyman had won by just two votes. Governor Thomson rescinded Durkin’s certificate, and awarded a new credential to Wyman.

Senator Cotton resigned on December 31, 1974, and Governor Thomson appointed Wyman to fill the remainder of the term, which would expire January 3, 1975.

The election contest was not settled, however, and eventually a new election would be called in 1975.
== New York ==

Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Jacob Javits won against Democratic challenger Ramsey Clark in a three way election.






== North Carolina ==

Incumbent Democrat Sam Ervin chose to retire. The general election was fought between the Democratic nominee Robert Morgan and the Republican nominee William Stevens.









== North Dakota ==

Incumbent Republican Milton Young was re-elected to his sixth term, defeating North Dakota Democratic-NPL Party candidate William L. Guy, a former Governor of North Dakota.

Only Young filed as a Republican, and the endorsed Democratic candidate was William L. Guy of Bismarck, North Dakota, who had served as Governor of the state from 1961 to 1973; and had presumably left the office to seek the senate seat. Young and Guy won the primary elections for their respective parties. Guy, who was very popular as governor throughout the state, and Young, who had a high approval rating as senator for the state, created the closest ever election for one of North Dakota&#x27;s senate seats. Young won the election by only 177 votes, and Guy retired from politics.

Two independent candidates, James R. Jungroth and Kenneth C. Gardner, also filed before the deadline. Jungroth&#x27;s platform was based on his opposition to strip mining the state&#x27;s coal reserves. Gardner would later run for the state&#x27;s other seat in 1988 against then incumbent Quentin Burdick.




== Ohio ==

Incumbent Democrat Howard Metzenbaum was running for election to a full term after he was appointed in 1974 by Ohio governor John J. Gilligan to fill out the Senate term of William B. Saxbe, who had resigned to become United States Attorney General. Metzenbaum lost the primary election to retired astronaut John Glenn, who went on to win the general election and win every county in the state over Republican Ralph Perk, Mayor of Cleveland.




== Oklahoma ==

Incumbent Republican Henry Bellmon narrowly won re-election to a second term, beating Representative Ed Edmondson by nearly 4,000 votes.
 
 


== Oregon ==

Incumbent Republican Bob Packwood won re-election to a second term. Betty Roberts was chosen to replace former U.S. senator Wayne Morse, who won the Democratic primary but died before the general election.

The Democratic primaries were held on May 28, 1974. Incumbent senator Bob Packwood was running for re-election after his upset victory against popular incumbent Democrat Wayne Morse in 1968 made him the youngest member of the Senate.

In the Democratic primary, former senator Morse, trying to win back the seat he had for 24 years before losing to Packwood six years earlier, faced Oregon State Senate President Jason Boe and several other candidates for a chance to take back his Senate seat. Boe, who was 45, made Morse&#x27;s age, 73, an issue in the race while Morse said his experience in the Senate made him a stronger candidate. Boe called for a series of debates around the state, but Morse refused. He went on to defeat Boe 49% to 39%, and planned to use the same strategy in the general election against Packwood, whose narrow victory over Morse 6 years earlier was attributed to Packwood&#x27;s superior performance at a debate in Portland late in the campaign.




In July, Morse was hospitalized in Portland with what was originally described as a serious urinary tract infection. His condition deteriorated and he died on July 22. The death was originally reported to have been caused by kidney failure, but it was later revealed that Morse died of leukemia; Boe apparently knew of the diagnosis during the campaign but did not make it a campaign issue.

The Oregon Democratic State Central Committee met on August 11, two days after Richard Nixon resigned the Presidency. They chose State senator Betty Roberts over Boe to replace Morse as the Democratic nominee. Roberts, an Oregon State Senator, had run for the Democratic nomination for Governor that year, but lost in the May primary to eventual general election winner Robert W. Straub.

Outgoing Oregon governor Tom McCall, who had decided not to run in 1968, had pledged to Packwood a year earlier that he would not challenge him in 1974. But as his term as governor ended, McCall began reconsidering his decision, believing he would bring more integrity to the job. In March 1974, at a dinner party held at Packwood&#x27;s Washington D.C. home in McCall&#x27;s honor, McCall informed Packwood that he would challenge him. The news of McCall&#x27;s change of plans soon reached the media. Eventually, McCall decided that he had little chance against Packwood, who had similar positions to his own and had a reputation for ruthless campaigning that McCall did not share. McCall did not run, and Packwood was unopposed in the Republican primary.

Strong Democratic gains were predicted, giving Roberts a good chance at an upset. In addition, the Senate had no female members and Roberts was one of three women (along with Barbara Mikulski in Maryland and Gwenyfred Bush in South Carolina) seeking a Senate seat. But on the issues, Packwood and Roberts shared many positions, such as on abortion, military spending, and the environment. Moreover, Packwood had distanced himself from Watergate, calling for Nixon&#x27;s impeachment and denouncing Gerald Ford&#x27;s pardon of Nixon. Roberts was also at a financial disadvantage, having entered the race late and facing debt from her failed gubernatorial run; Packwood was able to use money he had raised for a primary challenge that never materialized, and led in most polls by a double-digit margin.

Roberts lost the election to Packwood 54% to 44%. Packwood was the only Oregon Republican up for re-election to keep his seat: Democrats won every other available seat. In the Governor&#x27;s race, Bob Straub, who beat Roberts in the Democratic primary, defeated Vic Atiyeh to become the first elected Democratic governor since 1956; in the U. S. House of Representatives races, Les AuCoin won an open seat in the 1st district and in the 4th district, Jim Weaver upset incumbent John Dellenback.

After the election, Roberts, whose criticism of Packwood&#x27;s ethics was a theme in her campaign, considered filing a lawsuit against Packwood for misrepresenting her positions on gun control, abortion, and Social Security in campaign advertisements, but later dropped the idea.



== Pennsylvania ==

Incumbent Republican Richard Schweiker won re-election, defeating Democratic nominee Peter F. Flaherty, Mayor of Pittsburgh.

In the general election campaign, Schweiker faced popular Pittsburgh mayor Peter Flaherty. Both candidates, as highlighted by a &quot;New York Times&quot; article, &quot;[took] firm stands against inflation, recession, big spending by the Federal Government and abortion on demand.&quot; Schweiker, who was endorsed by the AFL–CIO, distanced himself from the Richard Nixon administration, specifically the Watergate scandal, by emphasizing his early calls for Nixon&#x27;s resignation and the fact that he was on Nixon&#x27;s &quot;enemies list.&quot;

In the end, Schweiker won re-election with 53% of the popular vote, with Flaherty winning 45.9%. Schweiker carried 53 of Pennsylvania&#x27;s counties, a decrease from the 59 counties he carried in the 1968 election. Flaherty had a strong showing in Allegheny County, which contains his home town of Pittsburgh, which Schweiker had won in 1968. The final election results represented a political divide between the eastern and western portions of the state, Schweiker in the east and Flaherty in the west, with the exception of Flaherty&#x27;s slim 4,491 vote victory in Philadelphia.




== South Carolina ==

The 1974 South Carolina United States Senate election was held on November 5, 1974 to select the U.S. Senator from the state of South Carolina. Incumbent Democratic senator Fritz Hollings easily defeated Republican challenger Gwen Bush to win his third term. Both Hollings and Bush faced no opposition in their party&#x27;s primaries which allowed both candidates to concentrate solely on the general election. The Watergate scandal caused the Republicans to perform poorly nationwide in 1974 and Gwen Bush was little more than a sacrificial lamb. The main focus of the voters in South Carolina was on the competitive gubernatorial contest and Hollings easily cruised to a comfortable re-election.

== Utah ==

Incumbent Republican U.S. Senator Wallace F. Bennett did not run for re-election to a fifth term, but retired. Salt Lake City mayor Jake Garn won the Republican nomination, while U.S. representative Wayne Owens won the Democratic nomination. Garn defeated Owens, 50% to 44%, with third-party candidate Bruce Bangerter winning 6% of the vote. 



== Vermont ==

Incumbent Republican George Aiken did not run for re-election to another term in the United States Senate. Democratic candidate, attorney and prosecutor Patrick Leahy defeated the Republican candidate, congressman Richard W. Mallary to succeed him. Leahy was the first Democrat ever elected to the senate from Vermont. 









== Washington ==





== Wisconsin ==

Incumbent Democrat Gaylord Nelson won re-election to a third term over Tom Petri, State senator since 1973.

<doc id="1106987" wikidata="Q124334" url="?curid=1106987" title="Henry Wirz">
<text>Henry Wirz (born Hartmann Heinrich Wirz; November 25, 1823 – November 10, 1865) was a Swiss-American convicted war criminal who served as a Confederate Army officer during the American Civil War. He was the commandant of Andersonville Prison, a Confederate prisoner-of-war camp near Andersonville, Georgia, where nearly 13,000 Union Army prisoners of war died as a result of inhumane conditions. After the war, Wirz was tried and executed for conspiracy and murder relating to his command of the camp; this made the captain the highest-ranking soldier and only officer of the Confederate Army to be sentenced to death for crimes during their service. Since his execution, Wirz has become a controversial figure due to debate about his guilt and reputation, including criticism over his personal responsibility for Andersonville Prison&#x27;s conditions and the quality of his post-war trial.

==Early life and career==

Wirz was born Hartmann Heinrich Wirz on November 25, 1823, in Zürich, Switzerland, to Johann Caspar Wirz, a master tailor and member of Zürich&#x27;s city council, and Sophie Barbara Philipp. Wirz received elementary and secondary education, and he aspired to become a physician but his family did not possess funds to pay for his medical education. Instead, he was educated as a merchant in Zürich and Turin from 1840 until 1842, when he began working at the department store of Zürich. He married Emilie Oschwald in 1845 and had two children.

In 1847, Wirz was sentenced to four years in prison on charges of embezzlement and fraud. He was released the next year and his sentence was commuted to 12 years of exile from the canton of Zürich, but his wife refused to emigrate and obtained a divorce in 1853. Wirz first went to Moscow, in 1848, and the next year to the United States, where he found employment in a factory in Lawrence, Massachusetts. After five years, he moved to Hopkinsville, Kentucky, and worked as a doctor&#x27;s assistant. There, he learned to perform small surgeries and cast fractures. He tried to establish his own homeopathic medicine practice in Cadiz, Kentucky, and also worked as superintendent of a water cure clinic in Northampton, Massachusetts.

In 1854, Wirz married the Methodist widow Elizabeth Wolfe (née Savells). Along with her two daughters, they moved to Louisiana, where Wolfe gave birth to their daughter. In 1856 Wirz made the acquaintance of Levin R. Marshall, the owner of the plantation Cabin Teele, who employed him as its overseer and where he set up a practice for homeopathic medicine.

==Civil War==
Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War in 1861, the 37-year-old Wirz enlisted as a private in Company A (Madison Infantry), 4th Battalion of Louisiana Infantry of the Confederate army in Madison Parish.
Shortly before his death, he said that he had taken part in the Battle of Seven Pines in May 1862, as an aide-de-camp to General Joseph E. Johnston, during which he was wounded by a Minie ball and lost the use of his right arm. That account is disputed by historians, one of whom says the injury may have actually occurred during a six-thousand mile mission to track down missing records of Union prisoners. That journey and a subsequent three months of rehabilitation at his home, were completed by the end of 1862.

After returning to his unit on June 12, 1862, Wirz was promoted to captain &quot;for bravery on the field of battle.&quot; Because of his injury, Wirz was assigned to the staff of General John H. Winder, who was in charge of Confederate prisoner-of-war camps, as his adjutant.

Later accounts by Wirz&#x27;s daughter alleged that Confederate President Jefferson Davis made Captain Wirz a &quot;special minister&quot; and sent him to Europe carrying secret dispatches to Confederate Commissioners James Mason in England, and John Slidell in France. Wirz returned from Europe in January 1864 and reported to Richmond, Virginia, where he began working for General Winder in the prison department. Wirz initially served on detached duty as a prison commandant in Alabama, but was then transferred to help guard Union prisoners incarcerated at Richmond.

===Camp Sumter===
In February 1864, the Confederate government established Camp Sumter, a large military prison near the small railroad depot of Anderson (now Andersonville) in south-western Georgia, built to house Union prisoners-of-war. In April 1864, Wirz arrived at Camp Sumter and remained there for over a year holding the post of commandant of the stockade and its interior. Wirz was praised by his many superiors and even by some prisoners, and was even recommended for, but not promoted to, major.

Camp Sumter had not been constructed to its full plan, and was quickly overwhelmed by the influx of Union prisoners. Though wooden barracks were originally planned, the Confederates incarcerated the prisoners in a vast, rectangular, open-air stockade originally encompassing , which had been intended as only a temporary prison pending exchanges of prisoners with the Union. The prisoners gave this place the name &quot;Andersonville&quot;, which became the colloquial name for the camp. Camp Sumter suffered from severe overcrowding, poor sanitary conditions, and an extreme lack of food, tools, medical supplies, and potable water. Wirz recognized that the conditions were inadequate and petitioned his superiors to provide more support, but was denied. In July 1864, he sent five prisoners to the Union with a petition written by the inmates asking the government to negotiate their release.

At its peak in August 1864 after its expansion to 26 acres, the prison held some 33,000 Union prisoners – around four times more than any other Confederate prison – with little more than patchy tents for shelter. The same summer saw more than 100 prisoners die of disease, exposure, or malnutrition every day. Around 45,000 prisoners were incarcerated during the camp&#x27;s 14-month existence, of whom close to 13,000 (28%) died.

==Trial and execution==
Wirz was arrested by a contingent of the 4th U.S. Cavalry on May 7, 1865, in Andersonville. He was taken first to Macon, Georgia, and then by rail to Washington, D.C., arriving there on May 10, 1865, where he was held in the Old Capitol Prison since the federal government decided to put him on trial for conspiring to impair the lives of Union prisoners of war. A special military commission was convened with Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace presiding. The other members were Gershom Mott; John W. Geary; Lorenzo Thomas; Francis Fessenden; Edward S. Bragg; John F. Ballier, U.S. Volunteers; T. Allcock, 4th New York Artillery; and John H. Stibbs, 12th Iowa Volunteers. Col. Norton P. Chipman served as Judge Advocate. During the trial gangrene prevented Wirz from sitting and he spent the trial on a couch.

===Charges===
The military tribunal took place between August 23 and October 18, 1865, was held in the United States Court of Claims, and dominated the front pages of newspapers across the United States. Wirz was charged with &quot;combining, confederating, and conspiring, together with John H. Winder, Richard B. Winder, Joseph [Isaiah H.] White, W. S. Winder, R. R. Stevenson, and others unknown, to injure the health and destroy the lives of soldiers in the military service of the United States, then held and being prisoners of war within the lines of the so-called Confederate States, and in the military prisons thereof, to the end that the armies of the United States might be weakened and impaired, in violation of the laws and customs of war&quot; and for &quot;violation of the laws of war, to impair and injure the health and to destroy the lives—by subjecting to torture and great suffering; by confining in unhealthy and unwholesome quarters; by exposing to the inclemency of winter and to the dews and burning sun of summer; by compelling the use of impure water; and by furnishing insufficient and unwholesome food—of large numbers of Federal prisoners.&quot; Wirz was accused of committing 13 acts of personal cruelty and murders in August 1864: by revolver (specifications 1, 3, 4), by physically stomping and kicking the victim (specification 2), by confining prisoners in stocks (specifications 5, 6), by beating a prisoner with a revolver (specification 13) and by chaining prisoners together (specification 7). Wirz was also charged with ordering guards to fire on prisoners with muskets (specifications 8, 9, 10, 12) and to have dogs attack a prisoner (specification 11).

===Testimonies===
The National Park Service lists 158 witnesses who testified at the trial, including former Camp Sumter prisoners, ex-Confederate soldiers, and residents of nearby Andersonville. According to Benjamin G. Cloyd, 145 testified that they did not observe Wirz kill any prisoners; others failed to identify specific victims. Twelve said that they witnessed cruelty on the part of Wirz. One witness, Felix de la Baume, who claimed to be a descendant of the Marquis de Lafayette, identified under oath a victim allegedly killed personally by Wirz. Among those giving testimony was Father Peter Whelan, a Catholic priest who worked with the inmates, who testified on Wirz&#x27;s behalf. A former Andersonville guard named James Duncan was called to testify for the defence, but was arrested when he tried to give evidence for allegedly causing the death of a prisoner at Andersonville.

===Verdict===
In early November 1865, the Military Commission found Wirz guilty of conspiracy as charged, along with 10 of 13 specifications of acts of personal cruelty, and sentenced him to death. He was acquitted of specifications 4, 10, and 13.

In his report on the trial, the Judge Advocate General Joseph Holt, who had prosecuted the Lincoln assassination trials, vilified Wirz and pronounced that &quot;his work of death seems to have been a saturnalia of enjoyment for the prisoner [Wirz], who amid these savage orgies evidenced such exultation and mingled with them such nameless blasphemy and ribald jest, as at times to exhibit him rather as a demon than a man.&quot;

In a letter to U.S. President Andrew Johnson, Wirz asked for clemency, but the letter went unanswered. The night before his execution, Louis F. Schade, an attorney working on behalf of Wirz, was told by an emissary from a high Cabinet official that if Wirz implicated Jefferson Davis in the atrocities committed at Andersonville, his sentence would be commuted. Allegedly, Schade repeated the offer to Wirz who replied, &quot;Mr. Schade, you know that I have always told you that I do not know anything about Jefferson Davis. He had no connection with me as to what was done at Andersonville. If I knew anything of him, I would not become a traitor against him, or anybody else, even to save my life.&quot; The Rev. P. E. Bole received the same visitor and later sent a letter to Jefferson Davis, who included it as well as Wirz&#x27;s reply to Schade in his book, &quot;Andersonville and Other War-Prisons&quot; (1890). Andersonville quartermaster Richard B. Winder, who was in the prison at the time, also confirmed this episode.

===Execution===

Wirz was hanged at 10:32 a.m. on November 10, 1865, at the Old Capitol Prison in Washington D.C., located next to the U.S. Capitol. His neck did not break from the fall, and the crowd of 200 spectators guarded by 120 soldiers watched as he writhed and slowly strangled. Wirz was buried in the Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

Wirz was one of only three men tried, convicted, and executed for war crimes during the Civil War (and, being a captain, was the highest-ranked of any executed), the others being Confederate guerrillas Champ Ferguson and Henry C. Magruder. Confederate soldiers Robert Cobb Kennedy, Sam Davis, and John Yates Beall were executed for spying; Marcellus Jerome Clarke was executed for being a guerrilla; and Andrew T Leopold was executed for spying, being a guerilla, and murder.

In 1869, Schade received permission from President Johnson to rebury Wirz&#x27;s body, which had been buried at the Washington Arsenal alongside the Lincoln assassins. While the body was being transferred, it was discovered that the right arm, and parts of the neck and head, had been removed during autopsy. As of the late 1990s, the National Museum of Health and Medicine still had two of his vertebrae.

==Controversy==

The Wirz controversy grew out of the questions remaining after his trial pertaining to guilt and responsibility for multiple deaths of prisoners of war in camps on both sides following suspension of the Dix-Hill Cartel prisoner exchange agreement in July 1863.

The Grand Army of the Republic, the United Confederate Veterans, Sons of Confederate Veterans (SCV), and the United Daughters of the Confederacy (UDC), among others, evoked sad memories of Civil War prisoners portraying Wirz either a villain, or a martyr-hero, thus further contributing to the disputation. From 1899 to 1916, sixteen states erected monuments dedicated to the Camp Sumter&#x27;s prisoners. In response, the United Daughters of the Confederacy initiated a construction of a monument honoring Henry Wirz in Andersonville, Georgia. Every year the UDC and SCV hold a memorial service at the monument. Until recently, SCV annually marched to Wirz&#x27;s memorial in Andersonville along with supporters of a congressional pardon for him. The SCV posthumously awarded Wirz their Confederate Medal of Honor, created in 1977.

During and after the trial Wirz was reviled in the court of public opinion as &quot;The Demon of Andersonville&quot;. One controversy concerns a witness for the prosecution, Felix de la Baume, who was actually Felix Oesser, a deserter from the 7th New York Volunteers (Steuben) regiment. According to the National Park Service, de la Baume was definitely a prisoner at Andersonville and it is a myth that he was a key witness at the trial.

After time passed, some writers suggested Wirz&#x27;s tribunal was unjust, stating that &quot;Wirz did not receive a fair trial. Nevertheless, he was found guilty and sentenced to death.&quot; In 1980, historian Morgan D. Peoples referred to Wirz as a &quot;scapegoat.&quot; Wirz&#x27;s conviction remains controversial.

Despite the surrounding controversy, the Wirz trial was one of the nation&#x27;s significant early war crimes tribunals, creating enduring moral and legal notions and established the precedent that certain wartime behavior is unacceptable, regardless if committed under the orders of superiors or on one&#x27;s own.

==In popular culture==
Wirz is an important character in MacKinlay Kantor&#x27;s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1955), introduced in the third chapter during his mission to France in October 1863. In Saul Levitt&#x27;s 1959 play &quot;The Andersonville Trial&quot;, Wirz was first played by Herbert Berghof. When the play was recreated for an episode of PBS&#x27;s 1970–71 season of &quot;Hollywood Television Theatre&quot;, Wirz was portrayed by Richard Basehart. Wirz was portrayed by the Czech actor Jan Tříska in the American film &quot;Andersonville&quot; (1996).

<doc id="1106988" wikidata="Q1248034" url="?curid=1106988" title="Sir James Hall, 4th Baronet">
<text>Sir James Hall of Dunglass, 4th Baronet FRS FRSE (17 January 1761 – 23 June 1832) was a Scottish geologist and geophysicist. He was a Member of Parliament for St. Michael&#x27;s borough (Mitchell, Cornwall) 1807–1812.

==Education==
Hall was born at Dunglass Castle, East Lothian, to Magdalena, daughter of Sir Robert Pringle, 3rd Baronet, of Tillich, Gloucestershire and Sir John Hall, 3rd Baronet (died 1776). He studied at Christ&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and the University of Edinburgh. As an Edinburgh student during the early 1780s, Hall studied chemistry under Joseph Black and natural history under John Walker. Though mineralogy was frequent taught in medical courses, Walker was one of the first professors to offer systematic lectures on the new field of geology. While attending Walker&#x27;s popular course, Hall was taught how to use the chemical composition of minerals to determine relative age of strata. Walker also emphasized the geological relevance of chemists like William Cullen, Joseph Black, Johann Pitt, Norbert Bergman, Johann Waller and Alex Consecrated. After his studies, Hall travelled to continental Europe where he actively sought out book dealers who could sell him works on chemistry, mineralogy and geology. He eventually travelled to France and met Lavoisier. He returned to Scotland to promote the new French chemical nomenclature.

At his home at Dunglass Castle he built by his own hand a model (3m tall) cathedral based on the cloister of Westminster Abbey. This was made of willow, some of which took root, transforming the structure into a small copse.

==Geological research==
Hall was fascinated by James Hutton&#x27;s &quot;Theory of the Earth&quot; during the late 1780s and 1790s. Hutton&#x27;s theory suggested that the strata of the earth were continually being worn down or melted, thereby making the earth one giant system of materials&#x27; circulation. In the spring 1788 Hall was with Hutton and John Playfair on the boat trip east from his home at Dunglass along the Berwickshire coast to Siccar Point where they found the famous rock formation now known as Hutton&#x27;s Unconformity. At this point Hall was still sceptical of the chemical viability of Hutton&#x27;s theory, however, he soon reconciled these doubts and ended up publishing several papers on the chemical composition of strata. He carried out research on granite that showed that it was possible for molten rock to form conformities. He melted basalt in an iron furnace, and demonstrated that it returned to its original form when cooled. He melted limestone in a retort made from a gun barrel, to show that it did not decompose when melted under pressure. His results were published in the &quot;Transactions&quot; of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and were well received by those like John Playfair who wanted to use Hutton&#x27;s theory to promote a more mathematical approach to geology. He also carried out the first analogue modelling to investigate the formation of folds, work published in 1815.

Hall travelled extensively in Europe to examine geological formations of the Alps and Mount Etna, and noted the similarity of lava flows in Italy to locations in Scotland.

Sir James Hall was President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and author of various works on architecture and the sciences.

==Family==

He married Helen Douglas (d. 1837), daughter of Dunbar Douglas, 4th Earl of Selkirk and sister of the 5th Earl of Selkirk. They had three daughters and three sons.

Hall died at home at 132 George Street in the New Town in Edinburgh, Scotland. He is buried in Greyfriars Kirkyard in central Edinburgh. The grave lies against the western wall of the original churchyard, backing onto George Heriots School.

He was succeeded by his son and heir, Sir John Hall, 5th Baronet, FRS. Another son, Basil Hall, was a noted traveller and writer; his daughter Eliza was mother of Houston Stewart Chamberlain. His daughter Magdalene Hall (1793-1822) married firstly 1815 Colonel Sir William Howe De Lancey and secondly Captain Henry Harvey; she was author of &quot;A Week at Waterloo&quot; (first privately published) and died in childbirth with her third child. By De Lancey, her first husband, Magdalene had no issue.

He was an agnostic or atheist.

<text>Bring It Back Alive is a live album by American southern rock band Outlaws, released in 1978. It was released as a double album, and later re-released as a single CD. The album is best known for the twenty minute-long rendition of the song &quot;Green Grass and High Tides&quot; from the band&#x27;s debut album.

Due to a printing mistake, early copies of the 8-track &amp; cassette versions had the title Bring &#x27;Em Back Alive. Although the cover of the vinyl version used the album&#x27;s proper title (&quot;Bring It Back Alive&quot;), the labels on all four sides read &quot;Bring &#x27;Em Back Alive&quot; as well.

<text>Paul William Harragon OAM (born 12 October 1968), nicknamed Chief or Chief Harragon, is an Australian rugby league football identity. A former Australian international and New South Wales State of Origin representative forward, he played rugby for the Newcastle Knights whom he captained to the 1997 ARL premiership. Harragon was a regular presenter of &quot;The Footy Show&quot; and as of 2013 is the Chairman of the Newcastle Knights Advisory Board.

==Background==
Harragon was born in Kurri Kurri, New South Wales, Australia.

==Playing career==
Harragon was raised in the New South Wales town of Kurri Kurri, and played for Lakes United in the Newcastle competition. He joined the Newcastle Knights in 1988 and made his first grade debut in 1989 against the Balmain Tigers.

He represented and captained Country, New South Wales and Australia. He was named man-of-the-match in the second game of the 1994 State of Origin series. At the end of the 1994 NSWRL season, he went on the 1994 Kangaroo tour.

Harragon captained the Knights to the 1997 ARL premiership title in a grand final against Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles, despite suffering from serious headaches and seizures throughout most of the season.

Harragon excelled at the State of Origin level, making 20 consecutive appearances for New South Wales between Game I 1992 and Game II 1998. He holds the record for the second most consecutive Origin games by a New South Welshman (Danny Buderus played 21 consecutive State of Origin games between game I 2002 and game III 2008), and most appearances by a NSW forward.

Between 1992 &amp; 1998, Harragon was a frequent choice to play for the Kangaroos. During the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, he helped Australia retain The Ashes. All up he scored three tries while representing his country. He missed the 1995 World Cup final due to injury, with Gary Larson being flown in to replace him. That year it was reported that Harragon would receive $1.2 million to secure his loyalty to the Australian Rugby League in addition to $700,000 per season for the next three seasons.

In 1996, he captained the team in a World Cup Test against South Africa, and in 1997 he played in a match against the &quot;Rest of the World&quot;.

In 1999, Harragon participated in the first rugby league game to be played at Stadium Australia. Later that year, after playing 169 first grade games in a career lasting ten years, Harragon retired due to an ongoing knee injury mid-season.

==Post-playing==
Harragon has since become a media personality, working for local Newcastle station NBN Television, before joining Channel 9 as a member of &quot;The Footy Show&quot; panel (on which his &quot;That&#x27;s Gold&quot; segment became immensely popular), and as a rugby league commentator. Following format changes to the programme before the 2009 season, Harragon decided to leave the production.

Harragon was also a director of and is a life member of the Newcastle Knights, and is spokesman for NIB Health Funds and Subway.

In 2016, Harragon became a contestant on Network Ten&#x27;s second series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot; in which he placed second.

<doc id="1107000" wikidata="Q4348102" url="?curid=1107000" title="1972 United States Senate elections">
<text>The 1972 United States Senate elections were held on November 7, with the 33 seats of Class 2 contested in regular elections. They coincided with the landslide re-election of Republican President Richard Nixon. Despite Nixon&#x27;s landslide victory, Democrats increased their majority by two seats. The Democrats picked up open seats in Kentucky and South Dakota, and defeated four incumbent senators: Gordon Allott of Colorado, J. Caleb Boggs of Delaware, Jack Miller of Iowa, and Margaret Chase Smith of Maine. The Republicans picked up open seats in New Mexico, North Carolina, and Oklahoma, and defeated one incumbent, William B. Spong Jr. of Virginia.

After the elections, Democrats held 56 seats, and Republicans held 42 seats, with 1 Conservative and 1 independent senator in the chamber as well. These were the first elections in which all citizens at least 18 years of age (instead of 21, and older) could vote, due to the 1971 passage of the 26th Amendment.

, this is the last time in which a Republican won a Senate election in New Jersey. Joe Biden, the 46th president of the United States (2021–2025) and 47th vice president (2009–2017), first won election to the United States Senate, defeating J. Caleb Boggs in the election in Delaware.

== Closest races ==
Seventeen races had a margin of victory under 10%:

== Alabama ==
In 1946, John H. Bankhead II suffered a stroke during a U.S. Senate hearing and died three weeks later. John Sparkman, who had served as U.S. Representative since 1937 and was House Majority Whip, secured the endorsements of party leaders and ran unopposed to win the remainder of Bankhead&#x27;s term. Sparkman was then re-elected in 1948, 1954, 1960, and 1966 all by wide margins. At the time, the Democratic Party was dominant in Alabama; winning the Democratic primary virtually guaranteed a general election victory. Until 1966, Sparkman never faced an opponent in the general election who garnered more than 30% of the vote. Sparkman also served as the running mate of Adlai Stevenson II in an unsuccessful 1952 presidential campaign.

However, in 1966, the Democratic Party began to feel the backlash of Civil rights legislation in the South, and Sparkman faced his closest political contest to date. He defeated John Grenier with just 60% of the vote. Richard Nixon&#x27;s election in 1968 also helped Republicans gain recognition in Alabama. In 1972, Sparkman faced Winton M. Blount, who was serving as Postmaster General.

Sparkman ultimately increased his vote share in a lopsided victory over Blount, who won just two counties, Houston county and, fittingly, the phonetically similar Winston county. This would be Sparkman&#x27;s final term as U.S. senator. He retired in 1979 and was succeeded by Howell Heflin. 



== Alaska ==

Republican Ted Stevens was originally elected to the U.S. Senate in 1970, succeeding Democrat Bob Bartlett. He won election to the remainder of Barlett&#x27;s term with nearly 60% of the vote.

In 1972, he faced Democrat Gene Guess in the general election. Stevens won re-election in a landslide even as Democrat Mike Gravel served as the state&#x27;s other senator. On election day, Stevens won re-election to a second term (his first full term) against Guess, 77–23%. Stevens would be re-elected in 1978, 1984, 1990, 1996, and 2002 with at least 66% of the vote before losing re-election in 2008 amid criminal charges.




== Arkansas ==


Incumbent Democrat John Little McClellan was re-elected.



== Colorado ==

Incumbent Republican Gordon Allott was defeated by Floyd K. Haskell.




== Delaware ==

Incumbent Republican J. Caleb Boggs, running for a third term, faced off against future President Joe Biden, then a New Castle County Councilman. Though Boggs was expected to easily win a third term over the then-unknown Biden, it ended up being the closest Senate election in 1972, and Biden narrowly beat out Boggs by a little over three thousand votes, winning what would be his first of seven terms.

Boggs, a longtime Delaware political figure, was considering retirement which would likely have led to a primary campaign between two Republicans, U.S. Representative Pete du Pont and Wilmington Mayor Harry G. Haskell Jr. To avoid the anticipated divisive primary fight, U.S. President Richard M. Nixon helped convince Boggs to run again with full party support.

No other Democrat wanted to run against Boggs besides Biden. Biden&#x27;s campaign had virtually no money and was given no chance of winning. It was managed by his sister Valerie Biden Owens (who would go on to manage his future campaigns as well) and staffed by other members of his family, and relied upon handed-out newsprint position papers. Biden did receive some assistance from the AFL–CIO and Democratic pollster Patrick Caddell. Biden&#x27;s campaign issues focused on withdrawal from Vietnam, the environment, civil rights, mass transit, more equitable taxation, health care, the public&#x27;s dissatisfaction with politics-as-usual, and &quot;change&quot;.

During the summer Biden trailed by almost 30 percentage points, but his energetic campaign, his attractive young family, and his ability to connect with voters&#x27; emotions gave the surging Biden an advantage over the ready-to-retire Boggs. Biden won the November 7, 1972, election in an upset by a margin of 3,162 votes.

At the time of the election Biden was a little less than 30 years old; age 30 is a constitutional requirement for the U.S. Senate, and he reached that on November 20, in time for the Senate term beginning January 3. After his election he became the sixth-youngest senator in history.




== Georgia ==
Seven-term Democrat Richard Russell Jr. had served as U.S. senator since 1933, but he died January 21, 1971, while serving as President pro tempore. Russell supported segregation in the South and opposed Civil Rights legislation as was common among Southern Democrats of the time. Governor of Georgia Jimmy Carter appointed Democrat David H. Gambrell, the chair of the Georgia Democratic Party as interim senator, pending a special election.

=== Georgia (special) ===
Sam Nunn, a Democratic member of the Georgia House of Representatives, won both the special and the regular elections. Nunn beat Gambrell in the August 29 special and regular primary run-off elections despite trailing Gambrell initially 31-23% in the first round of voting.

In the special election to fill the remainder of Russell&#x27;s term, Nunn faced Republican congressman Fletcher Thompson. Nunn&#x27;s campaign was noted to be more organized than was Thompson&#x27;s. Nunn had support from numerous prominent Georgia Democrats, including Gambrell and Carter. Thompson&#x27;s campaign was &quot;almost literally a one-man effort&quot;, and he started the race with almost no footprint outside of his own district. Thompson was endorsed by Barry Goldwater, James L. Buckley, and Spiro Agnew.

On the day of the special election, Nunn defeated Thompson 52-47%. Though Thompson performed well in the Atlanta metro area, Nunn swept most rural counties en route to a victory. 




=== Georgia (regular) ===
In the general election held later that year, Nunn again defeated Thompson this time by almost 8 percentage points. Nonetheless, this marked a turning point in Georgia electoral politics: Nunn became the first Democrat to win a Senate race in Georgia despite losing the white vote. Nunn also proved to be more moderate than his predecessor Russell, voting in favor of abortion rights, gun control, affirmative action, and environmental regulations.

Nunn would be re-elected in 1978, 1984, and 1990 before retiring in 1997. This was the last time he won less than 79% of the vote in a U.S. Senate election. In 1996, he was succeeded by Democrat Max Cleland.

In the midst of his campaign for a seventh term, Allen J. Ellender, the President Pro Tempore and chairman of the Appropriations Committee, suffered a fatal heart attack on July 27, 23 days prior to the Democratic primary. Ellender, first elected in 1936 as the permanent successor to the assassinated Huey P. Long, was slated to face former state senator and 1971 gubernatorial candidate J. Bennett Johnston and minor candidate Frank Allen in the primary.

Governor Edwin Washington Edwards, who defeated Johnston by less than 4,500 votes in the 1971 Democratic runoff, nominated his wife, Elaine Edwards, to fill the remainder of Ellender&#x27;s term, with the agreement Mrs. Edwards would resign immediately following the general election to allow the winner to gain seniority over other new senators.

On the same day as Edwards&#x27; inauguration on Capitol Hill, the Louisiana Democratic Party rejected a challenge by former Governor John McKeithen to reopen qualifying following Ellender&#x27;s death, ordering the primary to be held August 19 as scheduled, ignoring an opinion to the contrary by Louisiana Attorney General William J. Guste Jr. Ellender&#x27;s name was not removed from the ballot and he received 10 percent of the primary vote as a tribute. McKeithen, whose eight-year gubernatorial tenure ended May 9, 1972, ran as an independent with support of the Ellender family, incensed by Johnston&#x27;s primary challenge.

Johnston easily won the Democratic primary, nullifying the need for a September 30 runoff. In the general election, the Shreveport native trounced McKeithen by 32 points to win the first of his four terms. He was sworn in on November 13, 1972.

<text>Sally Baldwin (4 November 1940 – 28 October 2003) was a University of York social sciences professor and author.

== Early life and education==
Baldwin was born Sarah Marie Kilday in Coatbridge, Scotland. At the University of Glasgow she studied English Language and Literature, in which she gained a first class degree. She later moved to the University of York, where she gained a diploma in social administration in 1973. She became part of the university&#x27;s Social Policy Research Unit (SPRU), being appointed its director in 1987.

==Career==
In 1990 she was made a professor and in 1994 became head of the University of York&#x27;s Social Policy and Social Work Department. She continued to conduct research up until her death. After retiring as director of SPRU in 2002, she went on to carry out research in areas relating &#x27;evidence based&#x27; methods to social policy.

==Death==
Baldwin died 28 October 2003 at Tiburtina Station, Rome, Italy. The moving walkway she was travelling along at the station collapsed and she was crushed in the internal gearbox. It is believed that maintenance work on the walkway had resulted in several panels not being replaced properly, resulting in the accident.

Since the accident, the former &quot;Institute for Research in the Social Sciences&quot; buildings at the University of York have been renamed &quot;The Sally Baldwin Buildings&quot; and the &quot;Sally Baldwin PhD Studentship&quot; has been set up in the Social Policy and Social Work Department, in her memory.

<text>Playin&#x27; to Win is the fourth album by American southern rock band Outlaws, released in 1978. The album was their first studio project with guitarist/singer/songwriter Freddie Salem. Salem had replaced founding member/guitarist/singer/songwriter Henry Paul, who had acted as the second frontman behind Hughie Thomasson. It was not as well-received as their previous three albums. Notwithstanding, it still featured half of the original lineup, which would remain until the departure of guitarist Billy Jones in 1981.

<text>In actuarial mathematics, the accumulation function &quot;a&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is a function of time &quot;t&quot; expressing the ratio of the value at time &quot;t&quot; (future value) and the initial investment (present value). It is used in interest theory. 

Thus &quot;a&quot;(0) = 1 and the value at time &quot;t&quot; is given by:

:formula_1
where the initial investment is formula_2

For various interest-accumulation protocols, the accumulation function is as follows (with &quot;i&quot; denoting the interest rate and &quot;d&quot; denoting the discount rate):
*simple interest: formula_3
*compound interest: formula_4
*simple discount: formula_5
*compound discount: formula_6

In the case of a positive rate of return, as in the case of interest, the accumulation function is an increasing function.

==Variable rate of return==
The logarithmic or continuously compounded return, sometimes called force of interest, is a function of time defined as follows: 

:formula_7

which is the rate of change with time of the natural logarithm of the accumulation function.

Conversely:

:formula_8

reducing to

:formula_9
for constant formula_10.

The effective annual percentage rate at any time is:
:formula_11

<text>Robert Cabot Sherman Jr. (born July 22, 1943) is an American singer and actor who was a teen idol in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He had a series of successful singles, notably the million-seller &quot;Little Woman&quot; (1969). Sherman left show business in the 1970s for a career as a paramedic and a deputy sheriff, but performed occasionally into the 1990s.

==Entertainment career==

===Music===
In 1962, Sal Mineo wrote two songs for Sherman and arranged for Sherman to record them. In 1964, Mineo asked Sherman to sing with his band at a Hollywood party where many actors and agents were in attendance. After this, Sherman signed with an agent and soon landed a part on the ABC television show &quot;Shindig!&quot; as a house singer and member of the cast.

Sherman made several records with Decca and another smaller label and appeared in teen magazines. In early 1968, he was selected for the role of Jeremy Bolt, a bashful, stammering logger, in the ABC television series &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; (1968–1970). As of 1970, Sherman had received more fan mail than any other performer on the ABC-TV network.

Sherman appeared on an episode of &quot;Honey West&quot; titled &quot;The Princess and the Paupers&quot; as a kidnapped band member. He also appeared on &quot;The Monkees&quot; in the episode &quot;Monkees at the Movies&quot;, playing a conceited surfer-singer named Frankie Catalina (in the model of Frankie Avalon) and performing the song &quot;The New Girl in School&quot; (the flip of Jan &amp; Dean&#x27;s &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Curve&quot;).

Sherman released 107 songs, 23 singles and 10 albums between 1962 and 1976; seven of his songs were top 40 hits. He earned seven gold singles, one platinum single, and five gold albums. In 1969, he signed with Metromedia Records and released the single &quot;Little Woman&quot;, which peaked at No. 3 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart (#2 in Canada) and spent nine weeks in the Top 20. It sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the R.I.A.A. in October 1969.

His other hits were &quot;Julie, Do Ya Love Me&quot; (written by Tom Bahler), &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go&quot;, &quot;Jennifer&quot;, &quot;La La La (If I Had You)&quot;, and &quot;The Drum&quot;(written by Alan O&#x27;Day). Some of these songs were produced by Jackie Mills, who also produced the Brady Bunch Kids. In Canada, &quot;Hey, Mister Sun&quot; reached #19, &quot;Cried Like a Baby&quot; reached #10, and &quot;Waiting at the Bus Stop&quot; reached #31. &quot;La, La, La,&quot; &quot;Easy Come, Easy Go,&quot; and &quot;Julie, Do Ya Love Me&quot; all sold in excess of a million copies and earned more gold discs for Sherman. &quot;Julie, Do Ya Love Me&quot; was Sherman&#x27;s sole entry in the UK Singles Chart, where it peaked at #28 in November 1970. The song competed there for chart space with White Plains&#x27; cover version, which placed at #8.

Sherman toured extensively through the United States and the world in support of his records and albums. He gave many concerts to sellout crowds of mostly screaming young women from the late 1960s to the mid-1970s. The screaming of the young women was so loud that Sherman experienced hearing loss.

===Television and film===
Sherman was a regular star on the weekly ABC television network show &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; from September 25, 1968, to September 18, 1970. He played the youngest brother, Jeremy Bolt.

Sherman was a frequent guest on &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and &quot;Where the Action Is&quot;. In March 1971 he appeared on an episode of &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; as a back-door pilot for the ABC TV series &quot;Getting Together&quot;, which aired starting in September 1971 and was canceled after 14 episodes.

Sherman was a guest star on television series such as &quot;Emergency!&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;The Mod Squad&quot;, &quot;Ellery Queen&quot;, &quot;Murder She Wrote&quot; and &quot;Frasier&quot;. He has also been a guest on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, &quot;The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour&quot;, &quot;KTLA Morning News&quot;, &quot;Visiting with Huell Howser&quot; on PBS, &quot;Good Day LA&quot;, &quot;The Rosie O&#x27;Donnell Show&quot;, &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, and &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Johnny Carson and later Jay Leno. He was featured on &quot;20/20&quot;, VH1, &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, and &quot;Extra&quot;, among other television shows.

Sherman was a regular cast member on the television show &quot;Sanchez of Bel Air&quot; in 1986.

Although most of Sherman&#x27;s acting career was on television, he also appeared in two movies. In 1975, Sherman starred in the family film &quot;He Is My Brother&quot;, directed by Edward Dmytryk. In 1983, Sherman appeared alongside fellow teen idol Fabian as the villain&#x27;s henchmen in the cult film &quot;Get Crazy&quot;, directed by Allan Arkush.

===Comeback and retirement===
In 1998, after an absence of 25 years, Sherman appeared in &quot;The Teen Idol Tour&quot; with Peter Noone and Davy Jones. (Micky Dolenz replaced Davy Jones on the tour in 1999.) Sherman performed his last concert as a solo performer in Lincoln, Rhode Island on August 25, 2001. Although retired from public life, he still appeared at corporate and charity events. He was ranked No. 8 in &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s list of &quot;TV&#x27;s 25 Greatest Teen Idols&quot; (January 23, 2005, issue).

==Post-entertainment career==

In 1974, Sherman guest-starred on an episode of the Jack Webb television series &quot;Emergency!&quot; (&quot;Fools&quot;, season 3, episode 17, aired January 19, 1974), and found a new calling. Eventually, he left the public spotlight and became a paramedic. He volunteered with the Los Angeles Police Department, working with paramedics and giving CPR and first aid classes. He became a technical Reserve Police Officer with the Los Angeles Police Department in the 1990s, a position he still held as of 2017. For more than a decade he served as a medical training officer at the Los Angeles Police Academy, instructing thousands of police officers in first aid and CPR. He was named LAPD&#x27;s Reserve Officer of the Year in 1999.

Sherman also became a reserve deputy sheriff in 1999 with the San Bernardino County Sheriff&#x27;s Department, continuing his CPR and emergency training of new deputy hires. He retired from the sheriff&#x27;s department in 2010.

Sherman and his wife co-founded the Brigitte &amp; Bobby Sherman Children&#x27;s (BBSC) Foundation. The foundation&#x27;s mission is to provide motivated students in Ghana with a high quality education and music program, and to provide tools to pursue higher education.

==Personal life==
Sherman was born to Robert Cabot Sherman Sr. and Juanita (née Freeman) Sherman in Santa Monica, California. He grew up in Van Nuys, California, with his sister Darlene.

Published accounts indicate that Sherman&#x27;s relationship with Sal Mineo was personal as well as professional.

Sherman&#x27;s first wife was Patti Carnel; the couple had two sons before they divorced. Sherman married Brigitte Poublon on July 18, 2010, in Las Vegas.

==Legacy==
In the season 4 episode of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, &quot;Brother From the Same Planet&quot;, Lisa Simpson develops an expensive habit of calling a 900 number for a heartthrob known as &quot;Corey,&quot; loosely based on Corey Feldman. When her mother attempts to sympathize with Lisa by confessing her girlhood crush on Bobby Sherman, Lisa snickers and ridicules her.

<doc id="1107036" wikidata="Q1324077" url="?curid=1107036" title="Medical record">
<text>The terms medical record, health record and medical chart are used somewhat interchangeably to describe the systematic documentation of a single patient&#x27;s medical history and care across time within one particular health care provider&#x27;s jurisdiction. A medical record includes a variety of types of &quot;notes&quot; entered over time by healthcare professionals, recording observations and administration of drugs and therapies, orders for the administration of drugs and therapies, test results, X-rays, reports, etc. The maintenance of complete and accurate medical records is a requirement of health care providers and is generally enforced as a licensing or certification prerequisite.

The terms are used for the written (paper notes), physical (image films) and digital records that exist for each individual patient and for the body of information found therein.

Medical records have traditionally been compiled and maintained by health care providers, but advances in online data storage have led to the development of personal health records (PHR) that are maintained by patients themselves, often on third-party websites. This concept is supported by US national health administration entities and by AHIMA, the American Health Information Management Association.
Because many consider the information in medical records to be sensitive private information covered by expectations of privacy, many ethical and legal issues are implicated in their maintenance, such as third-party access and appropriate storage and disposal. Although the storage equipment for medical records generally is the property of the health care provider, the actual record is considered in most jurisdictions to be the property of the patient, who may obtain copies upon request.

==Uses==

The information contained in the medical record allows health care providers to determine the patient&#x27;s medical history and provide informed care. The medical record serves as the central repository for planning patient care and documenting communication among patient and health care provider and professionals contributing to the patient&#x27;s care. An increasing purpose of the medical record is to ensure documentation of compliance with institutional, professional or governmental regulation.

The traditional medical record for inpatient care can include admission notes, on-service notes, progress notes (SOAP notes), preoperative notes, operative notes, postoperative notes, procedure notes, delivery notes, postpartum notes, and discharge notes.

Personal health records combine many of the above features with portability, thus allowing a patient to share medical records across providers and health care systems.

Electronic medical records could also be studied to quantify disease burdens – such as the number of deaths from antimicrobial resistance – or help identify causes of, factors of and contributors to diseases, especially when combined with genome-wide association studies. For such purposes, electronic medical records could potentially be made available in securely anonymized or pseudonymized forms to ensure patients&#x27; privacy is maintained.&lt;ref name=&quot;10.1073/pnas.0911686107&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contents==

A patient&#x27;s individual medical record identifies the patient and contains information regarding the patient&#x27;s case history at a particular provider. The health record as well as any electronically stored variant of the traditional paper files contain proper identification of the patient. Further information varies with the individual medical history of the patient.

The contents are generally written with other healthcare professionals in mind. This can result in confusion and hurt feelings when patients read these notes. For example, some abbreviations, such as for shortness of breath, are similar to the abbreviations for profanities, and taking &quot;time out&quot; to follow a surgical safety protocol might be misunderstood as a disciplinary technique for children.

==Media applied==

Traditionally, medical records were written on paper and maintained in folders often divided into sections for each type of note (progress note, order, test results), with new information added to each section chronologically. Active records are usually housed at the clinical site, but older records are often archived offsite.

The advent of electronic medical records has not only changed the format of medical records but has increased accessibility of files. The use of an individual dossier style medical record, where records are kept on each patient by name and illness type originated at the Mayo Clinic out of a desire to simplify patient tracking and to allow for medical research.

Maintenance of medical records requires security measures to prevent from unauthorized access or tampering with the records.

===Medical history===

The medical history is a longitudinal record of what has happened to the patient since birth. It chronicles diseases, major and minor illnesses, as well as growth landmarks. It gives the clinician a feel for what has happened before to the patient. As a result, it may often give clues to current disease state. It includes several subsets detailed below.

;Surgical history
:The surgical history is a chronicle of surgery performed for the patient. It may have dates of operations, operative reports, and/or the detailed narrative of what the surgeon did.
;Obstetric history
:The obstetric history lists prior pregnancies and their outcomes. It also includes any complications of these pregnancies.
;Medications and medical allergies
:The medical record may contain a summary of the patient&#x27;s current and previous medications as well as any medical allergies.
;Family history
:The family history lists the health status of immediate family members as well as their causes of death (if known). It may also list diseases common in the family or found only in one sex or the other. It may also include a pedigree chart. It is a valuable asset in predicting some outcomes for the patient.
;Social history
:The social history is a chronicle of human interactions. It tells of the relationships of the patient, his/her careers and trainings, and religious training. It is helpful for the physician to know what sorts of community support the patient might expect during a major illness. It may explain the behavior of the patient in relation to illness or loss. It may also give clues as to the cause of an illness (e.g. occupational exposure to asbestos).
;Habits
:Various habits which impact health, such as tobacco use, alcohol intake, exercise, and diet are chronicled, often as part of the social history. This section may also include more intimate details such as sexual habits and sexual orientation.
;Immunization history
:The history of vaccination is included. Any blood tests proving immunity will also be included in this section.
;Growth chart and developmental history
:For children and teenagers, charts documenting growth as it compares to other children of the same age is included, so that health-care providers can follow the child&#x27;s growth over time. Many diseases and social stresses can affect growth, and longitudinal charting can thus provide a clue to underlying illness. Additionally, a child&#x27;s behavior (such as timing of talking, walking, etc.) as it compares to other children of the same age is documented within the medical record for much the same reasons as growth.

===Medical encounters===

Within the medical record, individual medical encounters are marked by discrete summations of a patient&#x27;s medical history by a physician, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant and can take several forms. Hospital admission documentation (i.e., when a patient requires hospitalization) or consultation by a specialist often take an exhaustive form, detailing the entirety of prior health and health care. Routine visits by a provider familiar to the patient, however, may take a shorter form such as the &quot;problem-oriented medical record&quot; (POMR), which includes a problem list of diagnoses or a &quot;SOAP&quot; method of documentation for each visit. Each encounter will generally contain the aspects below:

;Chief complaint
:This is the main problem (traditionally called a complaint) that has brought the patient to see the doctor or other clinician. Information on the nature and duration of the problem will be explored.
;History of the present illness
:A detailed exploration of the symptoms the patient is experiencing that have caused the patient to seek medical attention.
;Physical examination
:The physical examination is the recording of observations of the patient. This includes the vital signs, muscle power and examination of the different organ systems, especially ones that might directly be responsible for the symptoms the patient is experiencing.
;Assessment and plan
:The assessment is a written summation of what are the most likely causes of the patient&#x27;s current set of symptoms. The plan documents the expected course of action to address the symptoms (diagnosis, treatment, etc.).

===Orders and prescriptions===
Written orders by medical providers are included in the medical record. These detail the instructions given to other members of the health care team by the primary providers.

===Progress notes===

When a patient is hospitalized, daily updates are entered into the medical record documenting clinical changes, new information, etc. These often take the form of a SOAP note and are entered by all members of the health-care team (doctors, nurses, physical therapists, dietitians, clinical pharmacists, respiratory therapists, etc.). They are kept in chronological order and document the sequence of events leading to the current state of health.

===Test results===

The results of testing, such as blood tests (e.g., complete blood count) radiology examinations (e.g., X-rays), pathology (e.g., biopsy results), or specialized testing (e.g., pulmonary function testing) are included. Often, as in the case of X-rays, a written report of the findings is included in lieu of the actual film.

===Other information===
Many other items are variably kept within the medical record. Digital images of the patient, flowsheets from operations/intensive care units, informed consent forms, EKG tracings, outputs from medical devices (such as pacemakers), chemotherapy protocols, and numerous other important pieces of information form part of the record depending on the patient and his or her set of illnesses/treatments.

==Administrative issues==

Medical records are legal documents that can be used as evidence via a subpoena duces tecum, and are thus subject to the laws of the country/state in which they are produced. As such, there is great variability in rules governing production, ownership, accessibility, and destruction. There is some controversy regarding proof verifying the facts, or absence of facts in the record, apart from the medical record itself.

In 2009, Congress authorized and funded legislation known as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act to stimulate the conversion of paper medical records into electronic charts. While many hospitals and doctor&#x27;s offices have since done this successfully, electronic health vendors&#x27; proprietary systems are sometimes incompatible.

===Demographics===

Demographics include patient information that is not medical in nature. It is often information to locate the patient, including identifying numbers, addresses, and contact numbers. It may contain information about race and religion as well as workplace and type of occupation. It also contains information regarding the patient&#x27;s health insurance. It is common to also find emergency contact information located in this section of the medical chart.

===Production===

In the United States, written records must be marked with the date and time and scribed with indelible pens without use of corrective paper. Errors in the record should be struck out with a single line (so that the initial entry remains legible) and initialed by the author.
Orders and notes must be signed by the author. Electronic versions require an electronic signature.

==Ownership of patient&#x27;s record==

Ownership and keeping of patient&#x27;s records varies from country to country.

===US law and customs===

In the United States, the data contained within the medical record belongs to the patient, whereas the physical form the data takes belongs to the entity responsible for maintaining the record per the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. Patients have the right to ensure that the information contained in their record is accurate, and can petition their health care provider to amend factually incorrect information in their records.

There is no consensus regarding medical record ownership in the United States. Factors complicating questions of ownership include the form and source of the information, custody of the information, contract rights, and variation in state law. There is no federal law regarding ownership of medical records. HIPAA gives patients the right to access and amend their own records, but it has no language regarding ownership of the records. Twenty-eight states and Washington, D.C., have no laws that define ownership of medical records. Twenty-one states have laws stating that the providers are the owners of the records. Only one state, New Hampshire, has a law ascribing ownership of medical records to the patient.

=== Canadian law and customs ===
Under Canadian federal law, the patient owns the information contained in a medical record, but the healthcare provider owns the records themselves. The same is true for both nursing home and dental records. In cases where the provider is an employee of a clinic or hospital, it is the employer that has ownership of the records. By law, all providers must keep medical records for a period of 15 years beyond the last entry.

The precedent for the law is the 1992 Canadian Supreme Court ruling in McInerney v MacDonald. In that ruling, an appeal by a physician, Dr. Elizabeth McInerney, challenging a patient&#x27;s access to their own medical record was denied. The patient, Margaret MacDonald, won a court order granting her full access to her own medical record. The case was complicated by the fact that the records were in electronic form and contained information supplied by other providers. McInerney maintained that she didn&#x27;t have the right to release records she herself did not author. The courts ruled otherwise. Legislation followed, codifying into law the principles of the ruling. It is that legislation which deems providers the owner of medical records, but requires that access to the records be granted to the patient themselves.

===UK law and customs===

In the United Kingdom, ownership of the NHS&#x27;s medical records has in the past generally been described as belonging to the Secretary of State for Health and this is taken by some to mean copyright also belongs to the authorities.

===German law and customs===

In Germany, a relatively new law, which has been established in 2013, strengthens the rights of patients. It states, amongst other things, the statutory duty of medical personnel to document the treatment of the patient in either hard copy or within the electronic patient record (EPR). This documentation must happen in a timely manner and encompass each and every form of treatment the patient receives, as well as other necessary information, such as the patient&#x27;s case history, diagnoses, findings, treatment results, therapies and their effects, surgical interventions and their effects, as well as informed consents. The information must include virtually everything that is of functional importance for the actual, but also for future treatment. This documentation must also include the medical report and must be archived by the attending physician for at least 10 years. The law clearly states that these records are not only memory aids for the physicians, but also should be kept for the patient and must be presented on request.

In addition, an electronic health insurance card was issued in January 2014 which is applicable in Germany (Elektronische Gesundheitskarte or eGK), but also in the other member states of the European Union (European Health Insurance Card). It contains data such as: the name of the health insurance company, the validity period of the card, and personal information about the patient (name, date of birth, sex, address, health insurance number) as well information about the patient&#x27;s insurance status and additional charges. Furthermore, it can contain medical data if agreed to by the patient. This data can include information concerning emergency care, prescriptions, an electronic medical record, and electronic physician&#x27;s letters. However, due to the limited storage space (32kB), some information is deposited on servers.

===Accessibility===

====United States====
In the United States, the most basic rules governing access to a medical record dictate that only the patient and the health-care providers directly involved in delivering care have the right to view the record. The patient, however, may grant consent for any person or entity to evaluate the record. The full rules regarding access and security for medical records are set forth under the guidelines of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA).
The rules become more complicated in special situations. A 2018 study found discrepancies in how major hospitals handle record requests, with forms displaying limited information relative to phone conversations.

;Capacity
:When a patient does not have capacity (is not legally able) to make decisions regarding his or her own care, a legal guardian is designated (either through next of kin or by action of a court of law if no kin exists). Legal guardians have the ability to access the medical record in order to make medical decisions on the patient’s behalf. Those without capacity include the comatose, minors (unless emancipated), and patients with incapacitating psychiatric illness or intoxication.
;Medical emergency
:In the event of a medical emergency involving a non-communicative patient, consent to access medical records is assumed unless written documentation has been previously drafted (such as an advance directive)
;Research, auditing, and evaluation
:Individuals involved in medical research, financial or management audits, or program evaluation have access to the medical record. They are not allowed access to any identifying information, however.
;Risk of death or harm
:Information within the record can be shared with authorities without permission when failure to do so would result in death or harm, either to the patient or to others. Information cannot be used, however, to initiate or substantiate a charge unless the previous criteria are met (i.e., information from illicit drug testing cannot be used to bring charges of possession against a patient). This rule was established in the United States Supreme Court case Jaffe v. Redmond .

==== Canada ====
In the 1992 Canadian Supreme Court ruling in McInerney v. MacDonald gave patients the right to copy and examine all information in their medical records, while the records themselves remained the property of the healthcare provider. The 2004 Personal Health Information Protection Act (PHIPA) contains regulatory guidelines to protect the confidentiality of patient information for healthcare organizations acting as stewards of their medical records. Despite legal precedent for access nationwide, there is still some variance in laws depending on the province. There is also some confusion among providers as to the scope of the patient information they have to give access to, but the language in the supreme court ruling gives patient access rights to their entire record.

====United Kingdom====
In the United Kingdom, the Data Protection Acts and later the Freedom of Information Act 2000 gave patients or their representatives the right to a copy of their record, except where information breaches confidentiality (e.g., information from another family member or where a patient has asked for information not to be disclosed to third parties) or would be harmful to the patient&#x27;s wellbeing (e.g., some psychiatric assessments). Also, the legislation gives patients the right to check for any errors in their record and insist that amendments be made if required.

===Destruction===
In general, entities in possession of medical records are required to maintain those records for a given period. In the United Kingdom, medical records are required for the lifetime of a patient and legally for as long as that complaint action can be brought. Generally in the UK, any recorded information should be kept legally for 7 years, but for medical records additional time must be allowed for any child to reach the age of responsibility (20 years). Medical records are required many years after a patient&#x27;s death to investigate illnesses within a community (e.g., industrial or environmental disease or even deaths at the hands of doctors committing murders, as in the Harold Shipman case).

===Abuses===
The outsourcing of medical record transcription and storage has the potential to violate patient–physician confidentiality by possibly allowing unaccountable persons access to patient data. With the increase of clinical notes being shared as a result of the 21st Century Cures Act, the increase in sensitive terms used in the records of all patients, including minors, are increasingly shared amongst care teams making privacy more complicated. Intersex people have historically had their medical records intentionally falsified/concealed, to hide birth sex, and intersex medical procedures. Christiane Völling became the first intersex person in Europe to successfully sue for medical malpractice. 

Falsification of a medical record by a medical professional is a felony in most United States jurisdictions. Governments have often refused to disclose medical records of military personnel who have been used as experimental subjects.

===Data breaches===
Given the series of medical data breaches and the lack of public trust, some countries have enacted laws requiring safeguards to be put in place to protect the security and confidentiality of medical information as it is shared electronically and to give patients some important rights to monitor their medical records and receive notification for loss and unauthorized acquisition of health information. The United States and the EU have imposed mandatory medical data breach notifications.

Patients&#x27; medical information can be shared by a number of people both within the health care industry and beyond. The Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) is a United States federal law pertaining to medical privacy that went into effect in 2003. This law established standards for patient privacy in all 50 states, including the right of patients to access to their own records. HIPAA provides some protection, but does not resolve the issues involving medical records privacy.

Medical and health care providers experienced 767 security breaches resulting in the compromised confidential health information of 23,625,933 patients during the period of 2006–2012.

==Privacy==

The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accessibility Act (HIPAA) addresses the issue of privacy by providing medical information handling guidelines. Not only is it bound by the Code of Ethics of its profession (in the case of doctors and nurses), but also by the legislation on data protection and criminal law. Professional secrecy applies to practitioners, psychologists, nursing, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, nursing assistants, chiropodists, and administrative personnel, as well as auxiliary hospital staff. The maintenance of the confidentiality and privacy of patients implies first of all in the medical history, which must be adequately guarded, remaining accessible only to the authorized personnel. However, the precepts of privacy must be observed in all fields of hospital life: privacy at the time of the conduct of the anamnesis and physical exploration, the privacy at the time of the information to the relatives, the conversations between healthcare providers in the corridors, maintenance of adequate patient data collection in hospital nursing controls (planks, slates), telephone conversations, open intercoms etc.

<doc id="1107043" wikidata="Q187979" url="?curid=1107043" title="Early Dynastic Period (Egypt)">
<text>The Early Dynastic Period, also known as Archaic Period or the Thinite Period (from Thinis, the hometown of its rulers), is the era of ancient Egypt that immediately follows the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt in . It is generally taken to include the First Dynasty and the Second Dynasty, lasting from the end of the archaeological culture of Naqada III until , or the beginning of the Old Kingdom. With the First Dynasty, the Egyptian capital moved from Thinis to Memphis, with the unified land being ruled by an Egyptian god-king. In the south, Abydos remained the major centre of ancient Egyptian religion; the hallmarks of ancient Egyptian civilization, such as Egyptian art, Egyptian architecture, and many aspects of Egyptian religion, took shape during the Early Dynastic Period.

Before the unification of Egypt, the land was settled with autonomous villages. With the early dynasties, and for much of Egypt&#x27;s history thereafter, the country came to be known as &quot;The Two Lands&quot; (referencing Upper and Lower Egypt). The pharaohs established a national administration and appointed royal governors, and buildings of the central government were typically open-air temples constructed of wood or sandstone. The earliest Egyptian hieroglyphs appear just before this period, though little is known of the spoken language that they represent.

==Cultural evolution==

By about 3600 BC, Neolithic Egyptian societies along the Nile had based their culture on the raising of crops and the domestication of animals. Shortly after 3600 BC Egyptian society began to grow and advance rapidly toward refined civilization. A new and distinctive pottery, which was related to the pottery in the Southern Levant, appeared during this time. Extensive use of copper became common during this period. The Mesopotamian process of sun-dried bricks, and architectural building principles—including the use of the arch and recessed walls for decorative effect—became popular.

Concurrent with these cultural advances, a process of unification of the societies and towns of the upper Nile River, or Upper Egypt, occurred. At the same time, the societies of the Nile Delta, or Lower Egypt also underwent a unification process. Warfare between Upper and Lower Egypt occurred often. During his reign in Upper Egypt, King Narmer defeated his enemies on the Delta and merged both the Kingdom of Upper and Lower Egypt under his single rule. Narmer is shown on palettes wearing the double crown, composed of the lotus flower representing Upper Egypt and the papyrus reed representing Lower Egypt - a sign of the unified rule of both parts of Egypt which was followed by all succeeding rulers. In mythology, the unification of Egypt is portrayed as the falcon-god, called Horus and identified with Lower Egypt, as conquering and subduing the god Set, who was identified with Upper Egypt. Divine kingship, which would persist in Egypt for the next three millennia, was firmly established as the basis of Egypt&#x27;s government. The unification of societies along the Nile has also been linked to the end of the African humid period.

Funeral practices for the peasants would have been the same as in predynastic times, but the rich demanded more elaborate rituals. Thus, the Egyptians began construction of the mastabas which became models for the later Old Kingdom constructions such as the step pyramid. Cereal agriculture and centralization contributed to the success of the state for the next 800 years.

It seems certain that Egypt became unified as a cultural and economic domain long before its first king ascended to the throne in the lower Egyptian city of Memphis. Political unification proceeded gradually, perhaps over a period of a few centuries, as local districts established trading networks and as the ability of their governments to organize agriculture labor on a larger scale increased. Divine kingship may also have gained spiritual momentum as the cults of gods like Horus, Set and Neith associated with living representatives became widespread in the country.

It was also during this period that the Egyptian writing system was further developed. Initially, Egyptian writing had been composed primarily of a few symbols denoting amounts of various substances. By the end of the 3rd dynasty it had been expanded to include more than 200 symbols, both phonograms and ideograms. In all likelihood, Naqada III saw the earliest codification of signs, where royal serekhs—a rectangular cartouche representing the niched or gated façade of a palace surmounted by the Horus falcon—are also first seen, painted on jars and impressed on their sealings. These goods were often traded &quot;abroad through the northern Sinai to southern Palestine.&quot;

==First Pharaoh==

According to Manetho, the first monarch of the unified Upper and Lower Egypt was Menes, who is now identified with Narmer. Indeed, Narmer is the earliest recorded First Dynasty monarch. Narmer appears first on the necropolis seal impressions of Den and Qa&#x27;a. This shows that Narmer was recognized by the first dynasty kings as an important founding figure. Narmer is also the earliest king associated to the symbols of power over the two lands (see in particular the Narmer Palette, a votive cosmetic palette showing Narmer wearing the crowns of Upper and Lower Egypt) and may therefore be the first king to achieve the unification. Consequently, the current consensus is that &quot;Menes&quot; and &quot;Narmer&quot; refer to the same person. Alternative theories hold that Narmer was the final king of the Naqada III period and Hor-Aha is to be identified with &quot;Menes&quot;.

==Egyptians in Canaan and Nubia==

Egyptian settlement and colonization are attested from about 3200 BC onward all over the area of southern Canaan with almost every type of artifact: architecture (fortifications, embankments and buildings), pottery, vessels, tools, weapons, seals, etc. 20 serekhs attributed to Narmer — the first ruler of the Early Dynastic Period — have been found in Canaan. There is also evidence of Egyptian settlement and occupation in lower Nubia after the Nubian A-Group culture came to an end. By the Early Dynastic Period, the Egyptian state had likely imposed its authority as far north as modern Tel Aviv and as far south as the second cataract in Nubia.

<doc id="1107047" wikidata="Q1661108" url="?curid=1107047" title="Mitten">
<text>A mitten is a type of glove that covers the hand but does not have separate finger openings or sheaths. Generally, mittens still separate the thumb from the other four fingers. They have different colours and designs. Mittens provide greater thermal insulation than gloves as they have a smaller surface area exposed to the cold, but have a trade-off in dexterity.

Mittens are associated with cold weather, children&#x27;s clothing, comfort and various occupational uses. In the English-speaking world, they also have a cultural association with domestic cats, as in the &quot;Three Little Kittens&quot;.

Mittens are a common sight on ski slopes, as they not only provide extra warmth but extra protection from injury. They are also recommended as part of extreme cold weather clothing. Oven mitts are worn in the kitchen to protect the hands from hot objects.

== History ==
Humans have likely used mittens for millennia, but wool and other materials used to construct clothing biodegrade quickly, which limits the amount of extant relics. From Ancient Egypt several depictions of mittens survive, and some gloves found at Egyptian pyramids have been described as resembling mittens, with the collection of egyptologist Robert Hay supposedly having contained a &quot;linen sleeve and mitten in one piece.&quot;

Some of the earliest clearly identifiable mittens date to around 1000 A.D. in Latvia, and mittens continue to be part of Latvian national costume today. Another example is a specimen found during the excavations of the early medieval trading town of Dorestad in the Netherlands: In the harbour area a mitten of wool was discovered dating from the 8th or early 9th century. Two left-handed leather mittens found on the Mary Rose are believed to have been used for falconry, whereas in modern times gloves or gauntlets are used for this purpose. From Elizabethan times, embroidered &quot;gauntlet mittens&quot; survive which were made from crimson silk velvet, satin and sequins, with the thread and floss dyed in twelve different colours.

When knitting became more popular in England in the 16th century, mittens were produced at home from wool. One of the earliest known mittens for children survives from this period. The is a form of circular knitting, and modern knitters often use a circular needle.

Many people around the Arctic Circle have used mittens, including other Baltic peoples, Native Americans and Vikings.

== Types ==

Mittens are made from several materials, including wool, leather and fur. From the late 18th century, knitting patterns were published which allowed to inscribe poems on knitted mittens.

Special types of mittens include:

Hunter&#x27;s mittens – In the 1930s, special woolen mittens were introduced that had a flap located in the palm of the mitten so a hunter could have his finger free to fire his weapon.

Scratch mitts do not separate the thumb, and are designed to prevent babieswho do not yet have fine motor controlfrom scratching their faces. However, they are usually not recommended anymore as they can prevent the newborn&#x27;s natural behaviour of sucking on its hand and gaining tactile experience.

Corded mittens are two mittens connected by a length of yarn, string or lace, threaded through the sleeves of a coat. This arrangement is typically provided for small children to prevent the mittens becoming discarded and lost; when removed, the mittens simply dangle from the string just beyond the cuff of the sleeve.

== In popular culture ==
The West and East Mitten Buttes, two rock formations in Monument Valley, Arizona, are popularly known as &quot;The Mittens&quot; because when viewed from the south, the buttes appear to be two giant mittens with their thumbs facing inwards. The Lower Peninsula of Michigan is nicknamed &quot;The Mitten&quot; due to its cartographic shape, and includes The Thumb.

&quot;The Mitten&quot; is a popular Ukrainian folktale that has been translated into other languages.

&quot;Mittens&quot; is a Christmas song by Carly Rae Jepsen that reached number 26 on the Canadian Adult Contemporary chart in 2010.

During the inauguration of Joe Biden on 20 January 2021, a photograph of Vermont senator and former presidential candidate Bernie Sanders was taken by Agence France-Presse photographer Brendan Smialowski, depicting a masked Sanders sitting on a folding chair wearing winter clothing, most noticeably a large, fluffy pair of mittens, which were made by Vermont elementary school teacher Jen Ellis. The photograph became a popular internet meme.

=== Domestic cats === 
A nursery rhyme &quot;Three Little Kittens&quot;, attributed to Mother Goose, narrates a woeful tale of childhood mitten loss through the fanciful title characters:

&lt;poem&gt;The three little kittens, they lost their mittens,
 And they began to cry,
&quot;Oh, mother dear, we sadly fear,
 That we have lost our mittens.&quot;
&quot;What! Lost your mittens, you naughty kittens!
 Then you shall have no pie.&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

In the English-speaking world &quot;Mittens&quot; is a popular name for a cat – whether because of the nursery rhyme, or because some cats&#x27; fur patterns create contrasting colours on their feet, creating the impression they are &quot;wearing mittens&quot;. In the 1907 children&#x27;s book &quot;The Tale of Tom Kitten&quot; by Beatrix Potter, the title character has a sister named Mittens.

The 1959 Rodgers and Hammerstein song &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;, from the musical &quot;The Sound of Music&quot;, includes the lyrics: &quot;Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens/Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens&quot;.

Mittens is a domestic cat in Wellington, New Zealand, who wanders the city&#x27;s central business district and is fondly regarded by locals and tourists.

In the 2008 Disney animated film &quot;Bolt&quot;, Mittens (voiced by Susie Essman) is a feral cat who helps the title character, a white shepherd dog voiced by John Travolta, find his way home.

<text>The Boer or Boerbok is a South African breed of meat goat. It was selectively bred in the Eastern Cape from about 1920 for meat qualities and for the ability to survive by grazing on the thorn veldt of that region. It has been exported to many countries, and has been used to improve the meat qualities of other breeds.

== History ==

Europeans arriving in the Cape in the 17th century found an established population of goats kept by Khoikhoi peoples. These were small, with short, speckled coats; they were thought to have been brought to the area by peoples migrating southwards down the eastern coast of Africa. In following centuries, goats kept by Boer farmers in the Eastern Cape derived from stock acquired from Khoikhoi and Bantu peoples, possibly with some influence from the Angora or from European or Indian stock. A variety of types and colours was described in the 1830s; by the end of the century, the Boer was a large and powerful goat with a convex profile and lop ears, bearing some resemblance to the Anglo-Nubian. A census in the Cape Colony in 1891 found head.

Selective breeding for specific qualities began in about 1930, initially for foraging ability and meat quantity and quality, later also for coat colour, specifically for the white body with red-brown head that now characterises the breed.

A breed society, the Boer Goat Breeders&#x27; Association or Boerbok Telersvereniging, was started in Somerset East in 1959.

== Characteristics ==

The Boer is a large goat: the average weight of an adult male is some , with a mean height reported in 1984 at over . The coat is glossy and short; the recommended colouring is white with a reddish-brown head with a white blaze, and pigmented skin. The ears and horns are of medium size; the ears are broad, pendulous and smooth, the horns dark in colour, backward-curving, round, and solid.

It is well adapted to grazing on a wide variety of local biomes, including sourveld, coastal veld, mixed veld, and thornveld. It has a fast growth rate and good carcass qualities, good resistance to disease, and good adaptation to hot, dry semidesert conditions.

The ewes are polyoestrous and are capable of breeding at any time of year; the natural breeding season is in April and May (&quot;i.e.&quot;, in autumn in the Southern Hemisphere), and breeding activity is at its lowest in late spring and early summer, or aaround November to January. The oestrous cycle lasts roughly 21 days, the oestrus some hours. The average gestation period is about 148 days, and the anoestrous postpartum period varies from some 30 to 80 days; conception is usually confirmed between 42 and 82 days after parturition.

The age of puberty in doe kids depends on the season of their birth, varying from a mean of about 157 days for those born in mid-summer (January) – and thus weaned in the natural autumn (April/May) breeding season – to about 191 days for those born in late winter (August). Weights at puberty are roughly in the range of with a mean of about for ewes receiving a low-energy diet, and with mean of about for those on a higher-energy regimen.

Ewes can be managed so that they give birth three times in every two years. Single, twin, triplet, and quadruplet births occur in the ratio 25:59:15:1.

== Use ==
The Boer is a meat breed, and is reared principally for that reason. Under extensive management in the subtropics, a weight gain around per day may be expected; daily gains of more than are possible under intensive conditions. The goats are able to exploit low-quality scrubland, grazing on thorn trees, bushes, and shrubs; they may be used in vegetation management, and are kept for this purpose in some areas of thornveld.

The milk yield of ewes is typically per day, with about fat and protein.

<text>Micki &amp; Maude is a 1984 American romantic comedy film directed by Blake Edwards and starring Dudley Moore. It co-stars Tony Award-winning actress and dancer Ann Reinking as Micki and Amy Irving as Maude.

With the exception of appearances as herself, as in the documentary &quot;Mad Hot Ballroom&quot; in 2005, this was Reinking&#x27;s last acting role in a film.

In India, this film was remade in Tamil as &quot;Rettai Vaal Kuruvi&quot; starring Mohan, Archana, and Rathika Sarathkumar, and directed by Balu Mahindra. It was also remade in Malayalam as &quot;Paavakoothu&quot; (1990) starring Jayaram, Parvathy and Ranjini. Tamil version was dubbed in Telugu as Rendu Thokala Pitta.

==Plot==
Rob Salinger (Dudley Moore) is an overworked tabloid television reporter. He is happily married to Micki (Ann Reinking), a lawyer who is a candidate to become a judge. Rob wants a child badly, but Micki is reluctant due to a previous miscarriage and wanting to focus on her career. On an assignment, Rob interviews a young cellist, Maude Guillory (Amy Irving). He is smitten with her and begins a relationship with her. When she becomes pregnant, the two decide to get married, with Maude and her father, professional wrestler Barkhas Guillory (Hard Boiled Haggerty), planning the wedding.

Rob prepares to confess to Micki and get a divorce. But before he can reveal his affair with Maude, Micki stuns him by announcing that she, too, is pregnant. She confesses that she initially planned on having an abortion as pregnancy would interfere with her career and not tell him, but realized how much she wants to have a family with him. However, she cannot exert or stress herself too much as it would endanger her and the baby. Rob becomes a bigamist. With his television boss and best friend Leo (Richard Mulligan) covering for him, he sees one wife during the daytime and the other at night, using work as an excuse. He gets away with it until the fates collide: Micki and Maude going into labor at the same time, in the same hospital, on the same floor.

The two women end up becoming friends, but realizing that Rob had been dishonest with them, they ban Rob from their lives and the lives of the children. Rob follows them around, spying on both families from a distance. Eventually, Rob reconciles with both Micki and Maude, though it is not clear if the two women are aware he has reconciled with the other. The film ends with the women pursuing their careers: Micki as a judge presiding in a courtroom, Maude playing cello in a symphony orchestra. The film closes with a shot of Rob in a park years later, with two babies and his six other children he has had over the years with Micki and Maude.

==Cast==
==Production==
The script was written by playwright Jonathan Reynolds. &quot;I initially thought that the guy would be perceived as terrible,&quot; said Reynolds. &quot;The biggest trick was to make him not be a swine. If you&#x27;d had Errol Flynn or Warren Beatty in that role you would&#x27;ve been in big trouble.&quot; So Reynolds stressed the man&#x27;s devotion to children and to make it clear he was very much in love with both wives.

Blake Edwards was not originally available to direct. When Edwards left &quot;City Heat&quot; he moved on to &quot;Micki and Maude&quot;. &quot;I feel I do my best work with him,&quot; said Moore. &quot;He lets me go. He doesn&#x27;t force me to feel that I&#x27;m not doing the right thing.&quot;

The original version was set in New York and Reynolds says it was &quot;sort of a slam-bang farce, with a very zippy pace.&quot; The director, said Reynolds, made it &quot;much sweeter&quot;, slowed the pace and introduced the idea of one wife having a wrestler father. Hard Boiled Haggerty, a professional wrestler, was subsequently cast as Micki&#x27;s father, Barkhas Guillory, a father-in-law.

Along with Haggerty, the film features cameos from professional wrestlers Gene LeBell, Chief Jay Strongbow, Big John Studd, and André the Giant. Although the main cast also includes Wallace Shawn, it would not be until &quot;The Princess Bride&quot; in which he and André would work together onscreen.

Amy Irving later stated, &quot;The role was difficult for me. It&#x27;s not my forte to do comedy. You feel so exposed when you first try to do it, afraid that you&#x27;ll appear ridiculous.&quot;

Filming began in April 1984. A month of shooting was left to do when Edwards fell ill with mononucleosis. Lou Antonio was brought in to complete the film and was credited as an Executive Producer. Nonetheless, the film came $1.6 million under budget.

==Release==
&quot;Micki and Maude&quot; premiered on December 2, 1984 at Cinema III in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canby/micki-maude&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
&quot;The last twenty minutes of “Micki + Maude,” as the two pregnant women move inexorably forward on their collision course, represents a kind of filmmaking that is as hard to do as anything you’ll ever see on a screen. The timing has to be flawless. So does the logic: One loose end, and the inevitability of a slapstick situation is undermined. Edwards and Moore are working at the top of their forms here, and the result is a pure, classic slapstick that makes “Micki + Maude” a real treasure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rogerebert/micki-maude-1984&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; — Roger Ebert

The film was a box office disappointment, although it grossed $26.2 million against a budget of $15.1 million. The critical reception was mixed to positive. On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 70% based on 10 reviews, with an average score of 5.60/10. On Metacritic, the film received a score of 64 based on 11 reviews, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;.

==Awards and nominations==
In 1985, Moore won the Golden Globe award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. The film was also Golden Globe-nominated for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical.

==Home video==
&quot;Micki and Maude&quot; was released on VHS in 1985 and 1989 by RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video and re-released in 1993 by Columbia TriStar Home Video. The DVD was released on November 3, 2003 by Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment.

<doc id="1107053" wikidata="Q7405825" url="?curid=1107053" title="Salt Creek Oil Field">
<text>The Salt Creek Oil Field is located in Natrona County, Wyoming. By 1970, more oil had been produced by this field than any other in the Rocky Mountains region and accounted for 20 percent of the total production in Wyoming.

Petroleum seeps in the area were known before 1880, but oil strikes near Lander led to claims by Schoonmaker and Cy Iba. In 1889 the first well to strike oil was drilled in the Shannon pool by Philip M. Shannon, president of the Pennsylvania Oil &amp; Gas Company, who in 1895 built an oil refinery in Casper to process the oil. Dr. Porro, an Italian geologist working for the Dutch company Petroleum Maatschappij Salt Creek in 1906, located the Dutch No. 1 near a large oil seep south of the Shannon wells, which was drilled in 1908. The &quot;gusher&quot; well reached an oil sand after drilling through of shale.

In 1915, a portion of the Teapot Dome was made Naval Petroleum Reserve Number 3.

==Geology==
The field is on an anticline with of closure, which formed in the Late Cretaceous or Early Tertiary. The anticline has two distinct domes, the &quot;Salt Creek Dome&quot; to the north and the &quot;Teapot Dome&quot; to the south. Production is from stratigraphic traps in the Lakota, Sundance and Tensleep formations plus two Frontier Formations, which is an offshore bar sandstone, all of which are interbedded with marine shales. This second Frontier formation extends into the Teapot Dome to the south. The Frontier lies between the Mowry Shale and Niobrara Formation. 
==Enhanced Oil Recovery==

In the Salt Creek field, Enhanced Oil Recovery with CO2 is used to increase oil production. The CO2 is captured in a natural gas facility in the nearby LaBarge field.

In 2016, CO2 was leaking from an abandoned well in the field and led to the temporary closure of a school.

<doc id="1107058" wikidata="Q734773" url="?curid=1107058" title="Operation Hardtack I">
<text>Operation Hardtack I was a series of 35 nuclear tests conducted by the United States from April 28 to August 18 in 1958 at the Pacific Proving Grounds. At the time of testing, the Operation Hardtack I test series included more nuclear detonations than the total of prior nuclear explosions in the Pacific Ocean. These tests followed the &quot;Project 58/58A&quot; series, which occurred from 1957 December 6 to 1958, March 14, and preceded the Operation Argus series, which took place in 1958 from August 27 to September 6.

Operation Hardtack I was directed by Joint Task Force 7 (JTF 7). JTF-7 was a collaboration between the military and many civilians, but was structured like a military organization. Its 19,100 personnel were composed of members of the US military, federal civilian employees, as well as workers affiliated with the Department of Defense (DOD) and the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC).

There were three main research directions. The first was the development of new types of nuclear weapons. This was undertaken by detonating experimental devices created by the AEC&#x27;s Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory and the University of California Radiation Laboratory (UCRL). The DOD performed experiments and tests on these detonations that did not hamper the AEC&#x27;s research. The second research direction was to examine how underwater explosions affected materiel, especially Navy ships, and was performed by the DOD. The Wahoo test was conducted in the open ocean, whereas Umbrella was in a lagoon. The final avenue of study was to analyze high-altitude nuclear tests to refine the detection of high-altitude nuclear tests and investigate defensive practices for combatting ballistic missiles. This research direction was composed of three individual tests and were the first high-altitude tests. The individual tests in the series were Orange, Teak, and Yucca. Orange and Teak were known collectively as Operation Newsreel and were rocket boosted. Yucca reached its altitude using balloons.

==Historical background==
Many events and proceedings leading up to Operation Hardtack I, such as previous nuclear testing results and the global political atmosphere, influenced its creation and design. One such historical circumstance was that nuclear radiation concerns were mounting publicly and abroad by 1956. During the 1956 Presidential Election, ending nuclear testing was a campaign issue and nuclear safety was one part of that discussion. At the same time, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) was publicly proposing a moratorium on testing.

In 1956 during June, the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) recommended new radiation exposure limits for the general public in a report entitled: &quot;The Biological Effects of Atomic Radiation&quot;. The AEC, which was the body that developed nuclear weapons, accepted the NAS recommended radiation exposure limits. Some AEC members asserted that the limits were reached incorrectly and should be reviewed in the future. Charles L. Dunham, AEC Director of the Division of Biology and Medicine (DBM), said that the new limits of nuclear radiation exposure would prevent them from continuing testing in Nevada. Dunham, in association with other AEC offices and officials, made recommendations to move further tests to the Pacific to eliminate the need to determine radiological fallout safety.

Also in 1956, the AEC was designing a test series that included nuclear detonations which would release significant amounts of nuclear fallout. The series came to be known as Operation Plumbbob and took place in 1957 from April 24 to October 7. Operation Plumbbob was followed by Project 58/58A and Operation Hardtack I. At the time of testing, Operation Plumbbob was the most extensive nuclear test series held at the Nevada Test Site. President Eisenhower was very cautious in approving Plumbbob due to public concern. Consequently, the AEC held brief and ultimately fruitless discussions of moving some of the tests in the Plumbbob series to the next planned Pacific Ocean series, Operation Hardtack I, to minimize radioactive fallout in and around the Nevada Test Site.

When Operation Plumbbob began in the spring of 1957, the planning process of Operation Hardtack I was well underway and the number of nuclear detonations planned were more than those in the Plumbbob series. At the same time, radiation and nuclear proliferation concerns around the world had led to formal discussions between the US, USSR, and other countries on the topic of instituting a global ban on nuclear testing as a path to disarmament. In 1957 on August 9 AEC chairman Lewis L. Strauss proposed to President Eisenhower a preliminary plan of Operation Hardtack I. President Eisenhower objected to the length of the four-month testing period and that the plan called for 25 shots, which was one more than in Plumbbob. As a result of the discussion, Eisenhower consented to yields no larger than , and ordered that the testing period be as brief as possible.

Project 58/58A followed Operation Plumbbob and began almost two months later starting in 1957 on December 6. Project 58/58A was composed of four safety tests; they were not supposed to result in nuclear radiation. All four took place at the Nevada Test Site. The safety tests were intended to ensure that the bombs would not malfunction. However, the test named Coulomb-C which took place in 1957 on December 9 did malfunction. It resulted in an unanticipated blast. The blast released a nuclear radiation fallout cloud that traveled toward Los Angeles and resulted in low levels of nuclear radiation. The bomb failure added to public concern over nuclear testing&#x27;s safety.

Some tests were cut in an effort to meet Eisenhower&#x27;s demands for a shorter testing period, but new tests quickly filled their place. AEC chairman Strauss remarked that the large number of shots was due to the &quot;DOD&#x27;s requirement for an increasing number of different nuclear weapons types&quot;. Eisenhower eventually approved the plan for Operation Hardtack I in late January, even though it still contained 25 shots. On March 31, 1958, the USSR announced a suspension of all tests and called on the US to do the same. On May 9 the leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita Khrushchev, accepted Eisenhower&#x27;s invitation for technical discussions on a nuclear testing moratorium and negotiations began on July 1 of the same year. Eisenhower announced to the US on August 22, 1958, that the ban would begin October 31. US scientists responded by seeking to add more tests to the Hardtack Series in case it turned out to be the last chance. Consequently, Operation Hardtack I consisted of 35 tests.

There was public health concern with the number of shots in Operation Hardtack I. Studies released in March 1958 indicated that people as far as away could have severe retinal burns from two of the three high-altitude tests: Teak and Orange. It was then decided that they would be moved to Johnston Island, which was from the nearest inhabited island. The high-altitude nuclear tests delivered the first openly reported man-made high-altitude electromagnetic pulses (EMP). Teak, which was detonated at and was , produced an aurora-like effect that was visible from Hawaii, displaced from the detonation. Most radio communications immediately dropped across the Pacific Ocean. The blackout in Australia lasted for 9 hours and Hawaii&#x27;s lasted for no less than 2 hours.

== High-altitude tests ==
Operation Hardtack I contained three high-altitude tests called Operation Newsreel that were designed to study many effects that a nuclear explosion would have on materials and electronic systems. They were also used to test the energy of the explosion and what forms of energy they would produce. Yucca was the name of the first high-altitude test and it was performed near the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The other two high-altitude tests, Orange and Teak, were performed near the Johnston Atoll in the South Pacific Ocean about southwest of the Hawaiian Islands.

=== Impact on ozone layer ===
There was some uncertainty on whether detonating a nuclear weapon at such high altitudes would cause a hole in the ozone layer. After multiple underwater tests there was evidence to show the energy created by the blast would create ozone. Project leads determined some destruction of ozone would occur which would then be replaced by the ozone created from the explosion. It was agreed that if this theory were wrong, the hole created in the ozone layer would be minuscule enough to cause no harm. Upon completion of Operation Newsreel, it was determined that there was very little evidence of any harm being caused to the natural ozone layer.

=== Yucca ===
Yucca was the first high-altitude test performed during Operation Hardtack I and was detonated on April 28, 1958. It was lifted by a balloon to an altitude of and had a yield of .To achieve the altitude needed, the device was attached to a large helium-filled balloon which carried it to the detonation altitude. Due to issues with high winds on Enewetak Island, the balloon launches from ground were unsatisfactory, thus creating the need for a new method. The balloons were then deployed from an aircraft carrier which helped with deployment and the inflation. While the balloons were inflated, they were unable to take too much force from wind or the plastic material of the balloons would tear. While the balloons were inflating on the aircraft carrier, the ship could match and oppose the wind speed allowing for the balloon to be inflated in still air. To make sure the launch would be successful 86 balloon launches were tested.

Due to concerns of failures, many safety measures were employed. While on ground, the bomb used multiple pins to prevent certain safety features of the bomb from being deployed before liftoff. One such pin was used to stop the electrical systems so that the bomb would be unable to be armed. In case of a dud, the bomb would detach from the balloon and be allowed to drop into the ocean where many more safety features would come into action. Some of these features included probes which could detect saltwater which would destroy the electrical system so the conductive seawater could not cause a short which would detonate the bomb. Another concern was a nuclear device floating in the ocean should a misfire occur. To combat this, inserts were created which would dissolve in a few hours, thus scuttling the device.

On the day of the launch many meteorological aspects were taken into account and calculations were done to ensure the bomb would reach the correct altitude. The bomb was loaded onto an aircraft carrier and preparations began. As the balloon was inflated multiple testing devices were connected to the balloon. The readings from these devices would be sent to multiple ships and aircraft so nothing would need to be recovered after the explosion. After all the preparations were done and the balloon was inflated, the device was released and began to climb. After almost three and a half hours of climbing the bomb was detonated at an altitude of . The aircraft carrier which carried Yucca was approximately from the detonation site. The shock wave from Yucca reached the carrier 3 minutes and 16 seconds after detonation.

The Yucca test had many Department of Defense projects attached to it for research purposes. Alongside testing the use of a balloon carrier, the Department of Defense wanted to research the electromagnetic waves emitted from a nuclear explosion. This test would be used to determine the impact a nuclear explosion would have on electronic devices. All of the data from these Department of Defense projects would be stored on recording devices on surrounding islands and in aircraft so data would not have to be recovered after the test. However, Yucca was carrying five different transmitting devices in canisters to help with research. While the balloon proved to be a great success, no data from the canisters were able to be retrieved due to equipment issues onboard one of the aircraft carriers.

=== Teak ===
The Teak test was launched from Johnston Island on July 31, 1958, and carried a payload of . Teak was the second high-altitude test after the success of Yucca. Instead of a balloon, the warhead for the Teak test would be carried by a Redstone missile; a modified Redstone missile had been used to launch Explorer I in January of the same year. Other nuclear weapons had been tested using the Redstone missile, but until this time the highest payload to have been detonated was during Operation Teapot. Teak would be the first high-altitude test to have a payload in the megaton range. The test was scheduled to take place from the Bikini Atoll. Due to the fact that the payloads of Teak and Orange were much larger than previous high-altitude shots, the test was moved to Johnston Island as to protect nearby native islanders from any retinal damage. As both Teak and Orange had been relocated these two tests were named Operation Newsreel. The name Newsreel came from the fact that these two tests were being moved to Johnston Island.

The safety precautions taken by the teams involved were precisely detailed. The day before the launch 187 team members would evacuate Johnston Island with 727 men the day of the test. This was to keep as few men on the island while still being able to operate the airfield and critical data instruments. Another problem the team members were concerned about was the issue of retinal damage. Since the payload of the bomb was so large, aircraft were scheduled to keep any civilian ships out of a radius of Johnston Island. Additionally, the Civil Aeronautics Authority was informed that it would be dangerous for any aircraft to fly within of Johnston Island. On the day of the test only about 175 men remained on Johnston Island to prepare for Teak to be launched and other various duties needed after.

At 11:47 PM on July 31 Teak was launched; after 3 minutes it was detonated. Due to programming issues, the warhead detonated directly above Johnston Island. At time of detonation the rocket had flown to an altitude of . The explosion could be seen from Hawaii away and was said to be visible for almost half an hour. After the explosion, high frequency long-distance communication was interrupted across the Pacific. Due to this communication failure Johnston Island was unable to contact their superiors to advise of the test results until about eight hours after the detonation. Thirty minutes after detonation, a crew was sent out to collect the pod which had detached from the missile carrying the warhead. The pod had been irradiated and to handle it the crew members used disposable gloves in an attempt to protect themselves from beta radiation.

During the Teak test all crew on and around Johnston Island were given protective eyewear to prevent flash blindness from the explosion. After the explosion it was found that besides the hazard of blindness, thermal radiation was another concern—even at an altitude of . A crew member who was on Johnston Island at the time was said to have received a slight sunburn from the amount of thermal radiation which had reached the island. While only slight to the crew member it created issues for the local fauna. Many birds were seen on Johnston Island in distress. Unsure if this was caused by blindness or thermal radiation, the project members decided to take precautions to protect local wildlife during the Orange test.

=== Orange ===
Orange was launched twelve days after Teak on August 11, 1958. Orange, like Teak, was launched using a Redstone Missile and had a yield of . The same safety precautions used by Teak were implemented for the Orange launch. Seeing how smoothly the evacuation for the Teak launch went, it was decided that the evacuation did not need to occur the day before the launch and eight hundred and eight men were evacuated on August 11 to an aircraft carrier about northeast of the island. Along with protection for the project crew, it was decided after Teak that Sand Island, a local bird refuge, would need protection from the blast as well. To make sure that most of the wildlife was safe a smoke screen was created over Sand Island. Due to interest in Hawaii, it was announced on August 11 that there would be a nuclear test sometime between 10 PM and 6 AM.

The rocket carrying the warhead was launched at 11:27 from Johnston Island and traveled south. Like Teak, the flight lasted 3 minutes and was detonated at 11:30 PM about south of Johnston Island at an altitude of about .The trajectory of Orange was a major success after the incident with Teak being detonated directly over the island. The recovery crew for the pod that was with Orange was unable to locate the research pod which had been launched with the rocket. Although Orange was visible from Hawaii it was not the great spectacle Teak had been. The light from the blast was visible for about 5 minutes. The explosion had also been slightly obscured to the crew at Johnston Island by cloud coverage. The blast from Orange did not cause the large communication interruption that Teak had caused, but some commercial flights to Hawaii were said to have lost contact with air traffic controllers for a short period of time.

== Surface tests ==
Of the 35 nuclear tests in Operation Hardtack I, four were surface burst shots: Cactus, Koa, Quince and Fig. These tests took place from May to August 1958, all at the Enewetak Atoll. Surface tests inherently present the potential for more radioactive exposure issues than the high-altitude or underwater detonations. This is because there is more material present to be converted to radioactive debris by excess neutrons due to the proximity to the Earth&#x27;s surface, and due to the soil and other minerals excavated from the craters created by these blasts. The existence of this extra material allows for larger radioactive particles to be created and lifted into the blast cloud, falling back to the surface as fallout.Though surface and near-surface tests have a higher probability of radioactive exposure problems, the radioactive elements have significantly shorter residence times when injected into the atmosphere. As radioactive clouds from surface-type tests reach heights of around at maximum, and thus cannot extend higher than the lower stratosphere, the residence times can be up to 13 years less than the high-altitude blasts. During original concept planning in 1954, Enewetak was supposed to be the location of the smaller tests conducted during Operation Hardtack I. Due to poor weather conditions and policy changes in 1958, five of the UCRL tests which were planned to be conducted at the Bikini Atoll were moved to Enewetak. This included the later two surface blast devices in the Quince and Fig tests.

=== Cactus ===

The Cactus test took place May 6, 1958 at approximately 0615. An land-surface type shot was detonated on a platform at the northern tip of Runit, Enewetak in the second of the 35 tests for Operation Hardtack I.The initial cloud from the explosion reached as high as within the first ten minutes, and settled at around by 20 minutes after detonation. The nuclear fallout prediction map proved to be accurate in determining the span and the intensity of the resultant fallout.Measured peak intensity of fallout reached at hour three directly above blast site on the North end of the Atoll. At mid-island the radiation was measured to be . The southern tip received a very small amount of radiation, due to the easterly winds.

Out of the eight Programs listed, DOD-affiliated Projects 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.12, 2.8, 3.2, 5.2, 5.3, 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 involved the Cactus test.

One of the goals of this test was to study the physical characteristics of the crater and the surrounding area pre- and post-detonation associated with Project 1.4. A camera was mounted to a RB-50 aircraft and the resultant crater was mapped using photogrammetry. Measurements were taken from down to ground zero for both pre- and post detonation. Survey measurements of the Cactus test could not be made until the resultant radiation amounts had lowered to safer levels. Along with photogrammetric radial measurements, Airblast measurements were also recorded near surface zero for Cactus in accordance with Project 1.7. Similar to Project 1.8, Project 1.9 sought to determine transmission of blast pressure through the ground soil. Forty-three drums were buried at varying depths from ground zero of the Cactus detonation. Individuals from the Air Force Ballistic Missile Division—TRW Space Technologies Laboratory sought to the Shock Spectra Studies of Project 1.12. Measurement gauges were located between from the blast site. Fallout measurements and samples were taken by aircraft in the aftermath of the detonation, as part of Project 2.8. These surveys were designed in part to determine the impact of specific radionuclides to overall nuclear fallout. Samples were taken early post-blast using a new rocket sampler, the UCRL, which were then followed by B-57D and WB-50 aircraft. Between four and twenty-four hours post-detonation, the WB-50 collected several samples at in altitude. Project 3.2 involved structural tests of corrugated steel arches. One of these arches was placed away from the Cactus blast site. Eight days after the test, a crew of 13 men were allowed near the surface zero in order to extract the arch. The extraction took around twelve hours, and the radioactivity levels reached a maximum at during this time. Project 5.2 sought to determine the effects of the blast on two A4D-1 aircraft, both in thermal radiation and pressure. Nine film badges were placed throughout each aircraft in order to measure radiation. The Gamma dosimeter worn by the pilot in aircraft 827 indicated a neutron exposure level of . There is not information available for the dosimeter worn by the pilot in aircraft 831. Radiation recorded by six of the nine film badges ranged from . Information from the remaining three film badges, located at the Pilot&#x27;s right leg, left sleeve, and left vest is not available. The pilot&#x27;s exposures were both greater than . Project 5.3 was very similar to 5.2, focusing on the effects of the blast on the structure of two test FJ-4 aircraft. Radiation from film badges on aircraft 467 ranged from , and for aircraft number 310. In Project 6.4, the Army Signal Research and Development Laboratory (SRDL) investigated the electromagnetic pulses post-detonation, using two instruments, one at Wotho (roughly from Enewetak) and one at Kusaie (around from Enewetak). Though Cactus is mentioned in Project 6.5, whose goal was to study the radar echoes from the fireball, it is not clear what destroyers were involved if any. Destroyers for the Teak, Fir and Yucca tests are explicitly stated. Project 6.6, the last of the projects that involved the Cactus test, sought to measure the physical properties of the stabilized radioactive cloud following the blast.

=== Koa ===
At 0630 on May 13, the Koa surface device was detonated at the western side of Dridrilbwij. The size of the blast was , around 76 times larger than the yield of the previous surface test, Cactus. The test was conducted in a large water tank. Within 17 minutes of the blast, surface clouds reached approximately . Nuclear fallout predictions for Koa were larger and covered a broader range than Cactus, with significantly higher radiation levels, an order of magnitude larger, in the immediate region surrounding the blast. There had been a larger nuclear barge detonation, the Apache test, off the island of Dridrilbwij two years prior in 1956, during which the island survived. The detonation of the Koa device, however, caused complete destruction of the island.

The Department of Defense (DOD) sponsored a series of experiments for Koa: Projects 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.9, 1.12, 2.9, 3.2, 3.6, 5.1, 5.3. 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.9. and 6.11. Project 1.4, which sought to study land craters post detonation for several shots, took ground survey measurements from surface zero out to . Detailed measurements could not be made until four days after the blast due to radiation levels. Using a boat, the majority of the crater was mapped, though some measurements could not be made until 1959 due to radioactivity levels around the Koa blast site. In Project 1.9, the blast-induced pressure through the soil was measured by burying 43 drums at depths ranging from and around feet from the Koa blast site. The early radioactive cloud samples, normally collected post-shot as a part of Project 2.8 using a UCRL rocket sampler, were not collected after the Koa test due to technical difficulties. Fallout at high and low altitudes using B-57D and WB-50 aircraft were measured with no technical problems. Project 3.6, which was conducted only on Koa, tested the effects of the blast on reinforced-concrete slabs buried close to surface zero. One station was located at from the blast site, and the other was located away. Project 5.2 was designed to measure the radiation levels using film badges on different areas of the aircraft and on the pilot directly. Koa had the lowest average radiation measurements of the eight shots on this project, with aircraft 827 ranging from 0.01-0.02R and aircraft 831 reporting levels between 0.03-0.19R. Unlike in the Cactus test, all nine film badges from both aircraft were successfully recovered and reported.

=== Quince and Fig ===
Quince and Fig were a series of surface shots that occurred in early August at the center of Runit. They were the last of the Hardtack tests conducted at the Enewetak Atoll. Quince was detonated at 2:15pm on August 6, 1958. Twelve days later, the Fig device was detonated on August 18, 1958, at 4:00pm. Quince and Fig were UCRL devices with co-sponsorship through the DOD and the AEC, though the main focus of these tests was weapons development. One of the main differences between these two tests was that over 130 tons of soil from the Nevada Test Site had been shipped in and was placed at surface zero of the Fig test. The radioactive cloud from the Quince blast rose to . As Runit was to also be the detonation site for Fig, the area had to be decontaminated after the Quince test. Around of contaminated topsoil was removed from an area upwind of ground zero. An area of at the blast site was scraped to remove the top three inches of soil as well. Even with these precautions, the measured alpha activity was around 20,000 counts per minute (CPM), and the area closest to surface zero was roped off to prevent personnel from entering. Upon detonation, the mushroom cloud produced by the Fig device rose to approximately , with a base of roughly . Thirty minutes post detonation, radiation measurements at the blast site reached over 10,000 R/hr.

The DOD experiments for Quince and Fig included Projects 1.4, 1.7. 2.4, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11, 2.14. and 8.7.

== Barge tests ==
Barge mounted test detonations was a technique first used in 1954, and also compensated for the lack of land at When testing returned to Bikini atoll the use of barges as the shot point had begun, with one notable advantage, no radioactive surface zero areas were developed. Two large underwater craters were formed in 1954 and these were used as subsequent surface zeros for detonations fired from barges. This allowed the available land area to be used for the placement of measurement instrumentation and reuse of the same burst point without the long delays required for radiological cooling by natural decay or expensive and long decontamination procedures. Reuse of zero points also allowed reuse of instrument locations and recording shelters for several tests saving construction costs and time and increasing test-scheduling flexibility. In HARDTACK the 26 barge events used only five detonation areas.

No DOD-sponsored experiments were scheduled for PINE.

== Underwater tests ==
Underwater tests were conducted to assess the damages to Navy boats and materials. The location for these tests was Enewetak due to the uniformity of the sea bottom in the area. This is critical for the tests so that proper moorings of the target ships can be secured on the sea floor. The underwater explosions create a bubble from the expended energy of the blast. This bubble is due to the vaporization of water that directly absorbs the heat of the blast. This bubble may break the surface depending on how much energy is dispersed and the depth of the nuclear device. The bubble displaces large amounts of water that then collapses in on the bubble after all the energy is expended. The water collapsing in on the cavity is called the &quot;radioactive pool&quot; and has the highest concentration of radioactive material.

Many different projects were put in place to test the two underwater blasts. Wave generation, hydrodynamic variables, and energy released were all studied using multiple sensors. These sensors were placed in multiple areas such as target ships and floating balloons. Oceanographic, seismographic and hydrographic surveys were completed after each nuclear blast. A project that used a nuclear blast to clear minefields was studied using the Umbrella blast. One hundred and twenty inert mines were placed at different distances ranging from . These mines were then picked out of the water to study the effects of the blast at each interval.

=== Radiation preparations ===
Another reason for underwater tests was to detect radiation contamination of ships after an underwater nuclear explosion. This meant that the contaminated ships required unique &quot;radsafe&quot; preparations so that the data could be quickly accounted for. After the data on the damage and radiation was recorded, the ships needed decontamination work completed before repairs could be completed. The Radiological and Decontamination Unit consisting of 200 enlisted and one officer was created for the task of decontamination. After decontamination, the target ships were repaired for use in a second underwater nuclear weapons test. The amount of radiation exposure was debated for the safety of the crews. Roentgens ( = ca 0,01 Gy in soft tissue) were used to gauge the gamma radiation that affected the units working on the nuclear tests.

For the underwater test crew, a limit of per blast along with per operation was referenced as the limit for exposure. These initial limits were rejected and maximum permissible exposure standards (MPE) were solidified by commanders for the crews working on the decontamination unit. Due to the fast recovery of ships, high contamination values were expected by commanders and set the standard to four roentgens per hour (R/hr). An excess of was designated off limits of recovery units. Personnel were given special breathing equipment to work in the interior of ships with an R/hr higher than one. High numbers of personnel working the tests were used to keep individuals within the MPE. Times were calculated to keep the total exposure below two roentgens for the personnel working on the ships. A floating decontamination facility was created on board a transport ship for the Wahoo and Umbrella nuclear tests. This allowed important data analysis and an increase in recovery efficiency.

=== Wahoo preparation ===

The nuclear explosion was carried out in open ocean outside of Enewetak. This nuclear test codenamed Wahoo was the first underwater test in the Operation Hardtack series. This test could be considered a continuation of the Wigwam nuclear blast (a deep water nuclear test off the coast of San Diego). Like its predecessor, the Wahoo shot was a scientific program that studied the effects of an underwater nuclear blast on Navy systems. The nuclear device was positioned deep in the Pacific Ocean. This deep water test required precise targeting arrays to be set up around the blast location, which presented unique problems for the arrays as the winds, sea currents and tides needed to be within certain limits for the data to be accurate. Testing arrays were placed at depths of around the nuclear device. The deep water mooring systems needed for the test proved to be difficult to position, leading many analysts to believe the data skewed. The target ships to be used for this program consisted of three destroyers, an active submarine, a submarine mockup used in Wigwam tests, and a merchant marine ship. It was predicted that no air blast or thermal effects would be presented from the underwater blast. The fallout from the blast was also predicted to stay within the target array due to the southwest surface winds.

=== Wahoo blast ===
The test conditions were met on May 16 allowing for the nuclear device to be detonated. Within a second of detonation, a spray dome was created that reached a height of after seven seconds. The overall shape of the spray dome resembled a cone with 45 degree sloped sides. Plumes were seen breaking through the spray dome after six seconds in every direction. The vertical plume continued rising until 12 seconds after the blast while the lateral plumes traveled for 20 seconds before collapsing. The diameter of the spray dome was approximately at the 20 second mark. The base surge reached a radius of in the downwind direction after 1.7 seconds. The downwind surge aided by a wind reached speeds of . This base surge could be seen for three and a half minutes and for longer from the air as it continued to move across the ocean. When the spray dome and base surge had dissipated, a foam patch could be seen spreading from the surface zero water to reach over . The nuclear blast was calculated to be . All fallout stayed within the predicted fallout area with a maximum of . The target ship at was directly hit by the shockwave, vibrating the entire ship and shaking it violently. The Moran merchant marine ship moored at away was immobilized due to shock damage to its main and auxiliary equipment while also suffering minor hull damage. One hour and ten minutes after detonation, a five-gallon water sample was taken directly above the blast location showing . The retrieval team entered a field after an hour and thirty five minutes.

=== Umbrella preparation ===
The second underwater explosion of the Operation Hardtack series was code-named Umbrella. This test was conducted in the lagoon inside Enewetak. This test could be considered a continuation of underwater test Baker, which was conducted in Bikini Lagoon. Explosions in shallow water can create an underwater crater if close enough to the bottom. The target ships from the Wahoo test were towed into the lagoon to be used again for the Umbrella test. The damage from Wahoo was minor in all cases with the exception of the Moran which required extra refurbishing of the hull. These ships had to be washed down and have the measuring equipment replaced before being put into use. The mooring for Umbrella was considerably easier than for Wahoo due to the location and depth of the lagoon. Information gathered from the Wahoo shot directly affected the Umbrella plans with regard to target array placement and decontamination times. The device was placed with a buoy at a depth of .

=== Umbrella blast ===

June 9 saw the second underwater nuclear test of the Hardtack I series. The detonation occurred at 11:15 AM (local time) with clear skies and a wind from the east-northeast. Within one-tenth of a second, the spray dome had broken through the surface. The overall shape of the spray dome resembled a vertical column with the plumes helping create the shape. Within 20 seconds of detonation, the maximum height of the column reached . The base surge reached a distance around downwind, reaching out approximately in all directions. This base surge could be seen from the air for about 25 minutes and the foam patch over the blast location lasting even longer. The blast yield of the nuclear device was measured to be . The Umbrella blast created a crater in diameter and in depth in the lagoon. The maximum radiation reading was found to be by an aircraft flying over the blast location. Radiation was reported to be of small portions, and re-entry was granted 30 minutes after detonation. Out of the major target ships, the highest radiation reading was logged at of the stern of the &quot;Moran&quot;. After all scientific data had been gathered from the target ships, they were restored to be seaworthy and towed back to Pearl Harbor. The &quot;Moran&quot; was concluded to be unseaworthy due to the blast and was sunk by naval gunfire near Ikuren Island.

The underwater nuclear tests (Wahoo and Umbrella) gathered scientific data that helped the Department of Defense understand the effects of nuclear weapons on Navy ships. Some of the key points found were that underwater nuclear blasts create less fallout due to the absorption of radioactive material in the water and vaporized droplets. Direct gamma radiation was found to be extremely low, but the base surge was found to be highly radioactive as it passed measurement devices. Smaller radiation concentrations followed in waves mimicking the initial base surge. Almost all free-field radiation activity was found to disappear after fifteen minutes allowing for return to normal operations. The impact of shock waves was less than previously expected. The damage from the shockwave was found to be negligible on the destroyers at the ranges tested, but equipment failure from the blast could immobilize the ships. The preliminary tests of explosive tapered charges were proven to simulate the shock waves of a nuclear device according to the data gathered.

<doc id="1107059" wikidata="Q7883628" url="?curid=1107059" title="Operation Hardtack II">
<text>Operation Hardtack II was a series of 37 nuclear tests conducted by the United States in 1958 at the Nevada Test Site. These tests followed the &quot;Operation Argus&quot; series and preceded the &quot;Operation Nougat&quot; series.

With test moratoriums on the horizon, American weapons labs rushed out many new designs. A hard deadline for testing was set at midnight (0000 hrs), 31 October 1958, as negotiations were set to start that day, and the schedule shows it, with 29 tests executed in October, four of them on the last day. One other test was cancelled because weather delays postponed it across the midnight deadline. After the conclusion of Hardtack II, the United States announced a unilateral testing moratorium, which the Soviet Union joined after two last tests on 1 and 3 November. In September 1961, the Soviet Union resumed nuclear testing — including the test of the most powerful nuclear device ever designed, the &quot;Tsar Bomba&quot;, in October — and the United States followed suit with &quot;Operation Nougat&quot;.

==Nuclear tests==
===Tamalpais===

The Tamalpais test was conducted in the U12b.02 adit of Rainier Mesa by Lawrence Radiation Laboratory on October 8, 1958. The shot took place in a 394-foot-long hook-shaped drift ending in an unusually large test chamber lined with salt blocks as part of an experiment in preparation for Project Gnome. Additional experiments included measuring permanent tunnel displacement, seismic ground shock measurement, gas sampling by Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and electromagnetic pulse measurement by the Department of Defense Effects Test Group. The detonation of the .072 kiloton device released significant radioactive contamination and damage to the U12 tunnel complex, with radiation levels of 50R/h at the main portal and in the 10,000 R/h range in the tunnel immediately following detonation. The following day, workers reentered the tunnel and triggered a significant hydrogen gas explosion that further damaged the tunnel and injured three workers. Following the tunnel&#x27;s evacuation, a second hydrogen explosion occurred later the same day.

===Adams===
Adams was planned to be the final test of Hardtack II, but due to unfavorable winds the shot was never fired. The shot was intended to be a balloon test, and had been fully assembled and raised to firing altitude when it was cancelled. After midnight and the start of the moratorium, the device was lowered to the ground and disassembled. The Soviet Union would continue nuclear testing until 3 November.

A 31 October 1958 meeting of the Atomic Energy Commission following the cancellation resulted in the following note:

<doc id="1107067" wikidata="Q7649166" url="?curid=1107067" title="Suspected Irregular Entry Vessel">
<text>Suspected Irregular Entry Vessel (SIEV) was the operational term used by the Australian Defence Force and Australian Coastwatch for maritime vessels that appeared to be attempting to reach Australia clandestinely.

The legal context was of vessels that were entering Australian waters without authorisation. Previously the term &#x27;Suspected &quot;Illegal&quot; Entry Vessel&#x27; was used. These boats are almost exclusively carrying asylum seekers who have departed from Indonesia on the final leg of a journey which started in countries such as Iraq, Afghanistan and Sri Lanka after paying &quot;people smugglers&quot;. During Operation Relex, 12 SIEVs were intercepted. Four were forced back to Indonesia, and three sank.

SIEVs were given numerical designations. The vessel involved in the children overboard affair was the SIEV-4. The vessel that sank in 2001, killing 353 asylum seekers (mostly women and children) was designated by the press as SIEV X (a temporary operational term used by Coastwatch prior to designation, the SIEV-X often referred to in the press was reported not to have been detected prior to sinking).

==List of notable SIEVs==
*SIEV-4 - the vessel involved in the children overboard affair, reached Christmas Island on 6 October 2001 with 223 passengers.
*SIEV-5 - reached Ashmore Reef on 12 October 2001 with 242 passengers.
*SIEV-6 - reached Christmas Island on 18 October 2001 with 227 passengers.
* SIEV-X - sank on 19 October 2001 with 421 passengers, killing 353. This boat was not an official SIEV, as it had not been detected by Australian authorities.
*SIEV-7 - reached Ashmore Reef on 22 October 2001 with 233 passengers.
*SIEV 36 - exploded and caught fire on 16 April 2009. The boat was carrying 47 passengers and two Indonesian crew. Three occupants were killed, and two more are missing. Five of the six navy personnel on board were injured.
*SIEV-221 - shipwrecked on cliffs at Christmas Island on 15 December 2010, 44 survivors from an estimated 90-100 passengers.

==Inquiries and inquests==
The Siev X, Siev 36 and Siev 221 events were followed by a number of inquiries, articles and books; Siev 36 had a coronial inquest held in Darwin as the incident had occurred in the Commonwealth Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands over which the Northern Territory has coronial jurisdiction, and the Siev 221 coronial inquest was held in Perth due to Western Australia having coronial jurisdiction in the Commonwealth Territory of Christmas Island.

<text>Ghost Riders is the sixth studio album by American rock band Outlaws, released on November 22, 1980, through Arista Records. The album lacks the country music influence of the band&#x27;s previous recordings, instead emphasizing hard rock.

&quot;Ghost Riders&quot; sparked a comeback after the mediocre sales of prior albums. Their cover of &quot;(Ghost) Riders In the Sky&quot; was one of their most successful songs earned the band some attention outside southern rock circles. &quot;Ghost Riders&quot; would be the final Outlaws album for Billy Jones, who would be asked to leave the band after its release.

<text>The Wyandotte Nation is a federally recognized Native American tribe headquartered in northeastern Oklahoma. They are descendants of the Wendat Confederacy and Native Americans with territory near Georgian Bay and Lake Huron. Under pressure from Haudenosaunee and other tribes, then from European settlers and the United States government, the tribe gradually moved south and west to Michigan, Ohio, Kansas, and finally Oklahoma in the United States.

==Government==
The headquarters of the federally recognized Wyandotte Nation is in Wyandotte, Oklahoma, and their tribal jurisdictional area is in Ottawa County, Oklahoma.

Billy Friend is the elected Chief, currently serving a four-year term. The Wyandotte Nation issues its own tribal vehicle tags and operates its own housing authority. It has a ten-man police department providing 24-hour law enforcement response to the Nation and surrounding area.

In 2022, 6,883 people are enrolled members of the nation. Only about 25 percent of the tribe lives within the state of Oklahoma. In 2011, that was 1,218 of 4,957 members. Enrollment is based in lineal descent; that is, the tribe has no minimum blood quantum requirement.

==Economic development==
The tribe operates the Bearskin Fitness Center, the Wyandotte Nation Environmental Department, and the Bearskin Health and Wellness Center. &quot;The Turtle Speaks&quot; is the tribal newspaper.

The tribe owns the Wyandotte Nation Casino in Wyandotte, Oklahoma. It owns a truck stop, a fuel station, and a smoke shop. They issue their own tribal vehicle tags.

It owns the 7th Street Casino in the former Scottish Rite Masonic Temple in Kansas City, Kansas. It has legal control of the nearby Wyandot National Burying Ground.
In 2010, the Wyandotte Nation acquired land in Park City, Kansas, with the stated intention of building a gaming casino and hotel.

==Events==
The tribe&#x27;s annual powwow is held in Oklahoma during the first weekend of September and features contest dancing, gourd dancing, and a social stomp dance.

==History==
In its own language, the tribe is called Wendat, renamed Wyandotte after merging with other related groups. It consists of Iroquoian-speaking Indians from the eastern woodlands. The name is thought to mean &quot;dwellers on a peninsula&quot; or &quot;islanders&quot;.

The first Wendat Confederacy was created around 1400 CE, when the &quot;Attignawantan&quot; (Bear Nation) and &quot;Attigingueenongnahac&quot; (Cord People) combined forces. They, in turn, were joined by the &quot;Arendaronon&quot; (People of the Rocks), &quot;Ataronchronon&quot; (People of One Lodge), and the &quot;Tahontaenrat&quot; (Deer Nation). Scholars once believed these peoples to be remnant bands of the St. Lawrence Iroquoians, who established villages located near present-day Montreal visited by early French explorers. Archaeologists have excavated large, 16th-century settlement sites north of Lake Ontario, suggesting that this may have been a site of the coalescence of the Wendat people. They later migrated to the area near Georgian Bay, where they were encountered by French explorers in the early 17th century.

French explorers encountered the Wyandotte around 1536 and dubbed them the Huron. They were fierce enemies of the nations of the Iroquois Confederacy, then based in present-day New York. Obliterated by smallpox epidemics, the Wendat Confederacy became seriously weakened during the early decades of the early seventeenth century. In 1649, it was defeated by the Iroquois and most members migrated southwest for safety, where they settled with Odawa and Illinois tribes. Others moved east into Quebec.

Remnants of the associated Wendat and Petun peoples came together as a new group, which became known as the Wyandot or Wyandotte. By the beginning of the 18th century, the Wyandotte people had moved into the Ohio River Valley, extending into areas of what would become West Virginia, Indiana, and Michigan. Around 1745, large groups settled near Upper Sandusky, Ohio. After the American Revolution, a treaty signed with the United States in 1785 confirmed their landholdings. However, the 1795 Treaty of Greenville greatly reduced its size.

The 1817 Treaty of Fort Meigs reduced the Wyandotte lands drastically, leaving the people only small parcels in Ohio. In 1842, the Wyandotte nation all of its land east of the Mississippi River, under pressure of the United States government policy to remove the Native Americans to the West. It made a treaty with the U.S. government by which it was to be compensated for its lands.

The tribe was removed to the Delaware Reservation in present-day Kansas, then considered Indian Territory. During this migration and the early months, it suffered much illness. In 1843, survivors buried their dead on a high ridge overlooking the Missouri River in what became the Huron Cemetery in present-day Kansas City, Kansas. In 1971 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It was renamed Wyandot National Burying Ground.

After the American Civil War, Wyandotte people who had not become citizens of the United States in 1855 in Kansas, were removed a final time in 1867 to present-day Oklahoma. They were settled on in the northeast corner of Indian Territory. The Seneca, Shawnee, and Wyandotte Industrial Boarding School, also called the Wyandotte Mission, opened for classes in Wyandotte, Oklahoma in 1872.

In 1893, the Dawes Act required that the tribal communal holdings in the Indian Territory be divided into individual allotments. The land was divided among the 241 tribal members listed on the Dawes Rolls. The Wyandotte members in Oklahoma retained some tribal structure, and still had control of the communal property of the Huron Cemetery, by then annexed into Kansas City, Kansas.

===Reorganization as a nation===
In 1937, seizing the opportunity presented by the US Oklahoma Indian Welfare Act of 1934 to regain tribal structure and self-government, the Wyandotte members organized into the Wyandotte Nation of Oklahoma, later changing its name to simply Wyandotte Nation, and achieved federal recognition. The act enabled Native Americans to hold property in common again, and to develop self-government and sovereignty.

===Termination efforts===
On August 1, 1956, the US Congress passed Public Law ch. 843, 70 Stat. 893 to terminate the Wyandotte Tribe of Oklahoma as part of the federal Indian termination policy. Three years were allotted for completion of termination. One of the stipulations required that a parcel of land in Kansas City, Kansas, reserved as the Huron Cemetery, which had been awarded to the Wyandot by treaty on 31 January 1855, was to be sold by the United States. Litigation was filed by a group of Absentee Wyandot against the United States and Kansas City, prohibiting the federal government from fulfilling the terms of the termination statute and ultimately preventing termination of the Wyandotte Nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyandotte/Huron Cemetery&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau of Land Management records confirm that the Federal Register never published the termination of the Wyandotte lands and thus they were never officially terminated.

When Congress restored the other Oklahoma Tribes, it included the Wyandotte in the repeal. On May 15, 1978, in a single Act titled Public Law 95-281, the termination laws were repealed, and the three tribes were reinstated with all rights and privileges they had prior to termination.

===Huron Cemetery===

For decades, the Huron Cemetery (also known as Huron Park Cemetery, and now formally known as the Wyandot National Burying Ground) was a source of controversy between the Wyandotte Nation and individual Wyandot descendants in Kansas. The former wanted to sell the property for redevelopment. Kansas City was also eager for that development, as the city had annexed all of the property in the area. By 1907 it was a prime site, near a new Carnegie Library, the Grund Hotel, and the Masonic Temple under reconstruction after a fire.

In 1906, the Wyandotte Nation authorized the U.S. Secretary of Interior to sell the cemetery, with the bodies to be reinterred at nearby Quindaro Cemetery. This proposal was opposed by Lyda Conley (Wyandot) and her two sisters in Kansas City, who launched what became a multiyear campaign to preserve the burying ground. They gained much support. In 1916, Senator Charles Curtis (Kaw/Osage/Prairie Potawatomi} of Kansas, who was a Kaw Native American, championed a successful bill to protect the cemetery as a national park and provide some funds for maintenance. Ironically, this dispute over the cemetery saved the tribe from termination during the 1950s.

Over the years, the Wyandotte Nation continued to explore ways to increase revenues for the tribe, including the redevelopment of the Huron Cemetery. Descendants in Kansas vigorously resisted these efforts. In 1971, the cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1998, the Wyandotte Nation and the Wyandot Nation of Kansas, an unrecognized tribe, reached an agreement to preserve the Huron Cemetery for religious, cultural, and related uses appropriate to its sacred history and use.

===Wendat Confederacy===
In August 1999, the Wyandotte Nation joined the contemporary Wendat Confederacy, together with the Wyandot Nation of Kansas, Huron-Wendat Nation of Wendake (Quebec), and the Wyandot of Anderdon Nation in Michigan. The tribes pledged to provide mutual aid to each other in a spirit of peace, kinship, and unity.

This followed an important meeting of Huronia reconciliation in Midland, Ontario, Canada, attended by representatives of the Iroquois Confederacy, Wyandotte nations, British, French, Dutch, Anglican Church and Catholic Jesuit brothers. The weekend of events was organized by the Huronia Reconciliation Committee.

==2012 on-campus murder==

On Friday November 30, 2012, Christopher Krumm, the 25 year-old son of Casper College faculty member James Krumm, went to the residence of his father and Heidi Arnold, who also taught at the college. Christopher stabbed Heidi several times, most of which took place outside. He then went to the college to find James. 

Christopher arrived at the college with two knives and a compound bow hidden under a blanket. He walked into his father&#x27;s classroom and shot him in the head with the bow at point blank range. Jim rose up and attacked his son, allowing his students to escape. Christopher eventually stabbed himself, leading to his death. 

Evidence indicated that Christopher was distressed because he had Asperger&#x27;s Syndrome, which he blamed his father for giving him, and that he wanted to ensure his father would not give the disorder to anyone else.

<text>Casper Mountain, an anticline, is located at the north end of the Laramie Mountains overlooking Casper, Wyoming along the North Platte River. At a top elevation of , the geological feature rises approximately above Casper.

==Geology==
Casper Mountain is composed of precambrian, paleozoic, and mesozoic rocks. The topography of the mountain has remained the same since the Laramide time period. However, erosion has stripped away the top sedimentary soil, exposing older rocks. Casper Mountain features quartzite, biotite schist, gneiss as well as amphibolite. The Casper Mountain fault line lies on the north side.
The rocks on Casper Mountain are significantly older than those found in the city of Casper, predominantly because of the anticline nature of the mountain. Archeologists studying the mountain believe Native Americans were in the area around 11,000 years ago. Stone artifacts found on the mountain date to between 4500 and 2500 B.C.. Campsites of these natives were found near quartzite outcroppings, and it is believed they used this rock for tools, arrowheads, knives, and other items. Casper Mountain has an archeological site operated by the University of Wyoming.
The mountain is part of the &quot;Casper formation&quot; so named for limestones and sandstones constituting the greater part of the sedimentary rocks in the region, including the Laramie Mountains.

==Recreation==
Casper Mountain is largely privately owned; however, there are several miles of trails for hiking, mountain biking, and horseback riding.

There are many recreation opportunities on the mountain. Hogadon Ski Area is one of very few ski areas with a parking/entry point located above the resort. Although small, the ski area provides a large source of winter entertainment on the mountain. Other winter activities include cross country skiing, snowshoeing, fatbiking, and snowmobiling. A small part of the cross country ski trails are lit at night, providing night skiing.

The southern side of the mountain is bordered by Muddy Mountain, which itself has many recreation opportunities.

Summer activities on Casper Mountain include camping, hiking, mountain biking, horseback riding, and picnicking. The Braille Trail is a short scenic hike meant for those who are blind, but catering to everyone. The trail celebrated its 35th anniversary in 2010, and was visited by about 2,000 people. The area around the trail has picnic sites, and is popular during the summer. The trail is accessible on a road near the base of Tower Hill. Along with the Braille Trail, Casper Mountain has many other hiking trails. At the base of the mountain&#x27;s north side lies Garden Creek Falls. The Casper Rotary Club manages the trails around the area and, beginning in December 2010, started to renovate some of the trails in order to make them safer for hikers. The club planned to install low intensity lighting in the parking lot, powered by solar panels. Given concerns by residents near the parking lot, the project was discontinued.

The mountain is also host to an annual summer-solstice gathering at Crimson Dawn. This event, based upon children&#x27;s stories told by a local woman to her children in the 1930s and 1940s, has grown into a local tradition, with hundreds of families migrating up the mountain to see actors re-enact tales of witches and warlocks.

Casper Mountain is also home to Beartrap Meadow, a large open space at the base of the road leading to the far east side of the mountain. Large parties have and continue to be held in the meadow. Beartrap Meadow also houses several campsites. Since 1994 Beartrap Meadow has hosted the Beartrap Summer Festival in late July or early August. It features bluegrass music and has included bands such as Ricky Skaggs, Earl Scruggs, and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.

==Wildlife==
Wildlife on the mountain includes wild grouse, mule deer, and elk, among other species native to Wyoming. Mountain lions have also been spotted on the mountain. On the west flank of the mountain in Jackson canyon, one of the largest migratory populations of bald eagles in the world take shelter during certain times of year.

==Climate==

==Broadcasting==
All of Casper&#x27;s high powered television stations originate from towers on the mountain, as do a vast majority of the area&#x27;s FM radio signals. A cross country ski area cuts right through an area known as Tower Hill (see pictures), where many of the towers are located. 
Local, State and Federal agencies - BLM, Sheriff, Fire, EMS and Casper PD - operate sites on Casper mountain providing both analog and digital support for traditional radio systems as well as the WyoLink statewide trunking system. There are other commercial sites on the mountain as well, providing such services as wireless ISP and cell phones.
Local amateur radio operators also take advantage of the mountain. One of the more heavily used amateur repeaters is operated by the Casper Amateur Radio Club - W7VNJ.

==Fires==
Although the mountain has seen its fair share of fires, in August 2006 a large wildfire known as the Jackson Canyon Fire burned 11,496 acres (40 km) on the western end of Casper Mountain,
In September 2012, the Sheep Herder Complex fire burned 15,887 acres and consumed 37 residences and 23 outbuildings, according to InciWeb. The fire was 100 percent contained by September 16, 2012. The cause of the fire remains unknown, although it has been speculated to be human-caused.

<text>The Karate Kid Part II is a 1986 American martial arts drama film written by Robert Mark Kamen and directed by John G. Avildsen. It is the second installment in the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; franchise and the sequel to the 1984 film &quot;The Karate Kid&quot;, starring Ralph Macchio and Pat Morita. &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; follows Daniel LaRusso (Macchio), who accompanies his karate teacher Mr. Miyagi (Morita) to see his dying father in Okinawa, only to encounter an old friend-turned-rival with a long-harbored grudge against Miyagi.

Following the success of the first installment, preparation for a sequel began immediately. Upon completion of the final script, Macchio and Morita were re-signed and additional casting took place between May and July 1985. Principal photography began in September in Los Angeles, and filming completed in December. Locations included Oahu, which was used to represent Okinawa in the film.

&quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; was theatrically released in the United States on June 20, 1986. The film received mixed reviews, with critics praising Morita&#x27;s performance as well as the new location and characters, while others criticized elements of the storyline, the antagonists, and some of the action scenes. The film was a commercial success, grossing worldwide, making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1986. A sequel titled &quot;The Karate Kid Part III&quot; was released in 1989.

==Plot==

Shortly after his dojo&#x27;s loss in the 1984 All-Valley Karate Tournament, a furious John Kreese attacks his student, Johnny Lawrence, in the parking lot after he stands up to him. Miyagi intervenes and passively incapacitates Kreese, then threatens to strike a deadly blow but instead tweaks his nose. Seeing Kreese&#x27;s humiliation, Johnny and the other students abandon him and Cobra Kai.

Six months later, Daniel visits Miyagi after his senior prom and explains that Ali has broken up with him in favor of a UCLA football player. Miyagi receives a letter notifying him that his father is dying, prompting him to return to his home village on Okinawa Island.

Miyagi tells Daniel that many years ago, he fell in love with a woman named Yukie. She was arranged to marry his best friend Sato, son of the wealthiest man in the village and fellow karate student of his father. Upon announcing his intentions to marry Yukie, Sato challenged him to a fight to the death. Instead, Miyagi left the country. Daniel decides to accompany him back to Okinawa.

Upon arrival, Miyagi and Daniel are greeted by Chozen Toguchi, who drives them to one of Sato&#x27;s warehouses and reveals that he is Sato&#x27;s nephew. Sato appears and demands to fight Miyagi, who adamantly refuses.

Arriving at the village, Miyagi and Daniel are welcomed by Yukie and her niece Kumiko. They discover that Sato has become a rich industrialist whose supertrawlers have destroyed the local fish population, impoverishing the other villagers. They are forced to rent property from Sato, who owns the village&#x27;s land title. Yukie reveals that she never married Sato because of her love for Miyagi.

Miyagi&#x27;s father dies, and Sato gives him three days to mourn out of respect before their fight. Miyagi shows Daniel the secret to his family&#x27;s karate – a den-den daiko (handheld drum) that twists back and forth, illustrating the &quot;drum technique&quot;, a counter-striking karate move that Daniel begins to practice. Daniel and Kumiko begin to develop a romance.

Daniel unintentionally exposes corruption in Chozen&#x27;s grocery business during an encounter in the village. Chozen accuses him of insulting his honor, and they have a series of confrontations. The feud escalates when Chozen and his cronies attack Daniel and vandalize Miyagi&#x27;s family property, but Miyagi fends them off.

Miyagi and Daniel plan to return home before the situation worsens, but Sato threatens to destroy the village if Miyagi refuses to fight. He finally agrees to fight on the condition that Sato relinquishes land ownership to the villagers, and Sato agrees.

On the day of the fight, a typhoon strikes the village, forcing everyone to seek shelter. Sato&#x27;s dojo collapses, leaving him trapped in the wreckage. Miyagi and Daniel rush to rescue him, and Daniel later ventures back out to save a child trapped on a nearby bell tower. Sato orders Chozen to help, but when he refuses, he rushes to assist Daniel himself. He publicly shames his nephew and disowns him, and an enraged Chozen runs off into the storm in disgrace.

Sato returns the next day with a work crew to help rebuild the village, asking Miyagi&#x27;s forgiveness and handing over the deed. He also agrees to host the O-bon festival in a nearby ceremonial castle, inviting Daniel to join. During the celebration, a vengeful Chozen ziplines into the presentation and takes Kumiko hostage, demanding to fight Daniel to the death. Daniel fights bravely but is eventually overwhelmed by Chozen.

Miyagi, Sato, and the crowd respond by twisting den-den daikos in unison, inspiring Daniel to utilize the drum technique to defeat Chozen. He then grabs the vanquished Chozen and threatens to end his life, who urges Daniel to kill him. However, mirroring how Miyagi handled Kreese earlier, Daniel instead playfully tweaks Chozen&#x27;s nose and drops him to the ground. The onlookers cheer as he and Kumiko embrace.

Other notable cast appearances include BD Wong (credited as &quot;Bradd Wong&quot;) as an Okinawan boy who invites Daniel and Kumiko to a dance club and Clarence Gilyard as one of the participants in the ice-breaking scene. Also, Traci Toguchi, who is credited as &quot;Girl Bell Ringer&quot;, is the child rescued by Daniel in the typhoon, and is later identified as &quot;Yuna&quot; in the &quot;Cobra Kai&quot; season three episode &quot;Miyagi-Do&quot;.

==Production==
The opening scene takes place immediately following the finale of the first film to seamlessly tie the two together. It was originally planned as the ending for the first film, although it was not shot until after the second film&#x27;s production began.

===Filming===
Principal photography took place in Oahu, Hawaii, in the northeastern area of the island known as the &quot;windward side&quot;. The local countryside in modern-day Okinawa had been drastically changed due to the presence of military bases, so other locations in both Japan and Hawaii were scouted as alternative filming locations. Filmmakers selected a property in Oahu that was privately owned by a retired local physician who agreed to allow a portion of the land to be used in the film. To form the Okinawan village portrayed in the film, seven authentic replicas of Okinawan houses were constructed along with more than three acres of planted crops. Fifty Okinawa-born Hawaii residents were also recruited as film extras. Filming began on September 23, 1985, and ended on December 20.

==Music==
The musical score for &quot;The Karate Kid Part II&quot; was composed by Bill Conti, who wrote the score for the previous installment, and is the only one of the trilogy not to feature the pan flute of Gheorghe Zamfir (a decision the composer regretted, according to the anniversary album liner notes). The film&#x27;s signature tune was Peter Cetera&#x27;s song &quot;Glory of Love&quot;, which was a No. 1 hit in the United States and received an Academy Award nomination for Best Song. When Daniel and Miyagi are being driven by Chozen and his crony Toshio after they arrive in Okinawa, Chozen tunes in the radio of the car until he reaches a station playing &quot;Fascination&quot;, the same song to which Ali and Johnny were slow dancing at the high-end country club in the original film. The soundtrack is notable as being the final album released by United Artists Records.

<text>The 17th Lancers (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own) was a cavalry regiment of the British Army, raised in 1759 and notable for its participation in the Charge of the Light Brigade during the Crimean War. The regiment was amalgamated with the 21st Lancers to form the 17th/21st Lancers in 1922.

==History==

=== Seven Years War===
In 1759, Colonel John Hale of the 47th Foot was ordered back to Britain with General James Wolfe&#x27;s final dispatches and news of his victory in the Battle of Quebec in September 1759. After his return, he was rewarded with land in Canada and granted permission to raise a regiment of light dragoons. He formed the regiment in Hertfordshire on 7 November 1759 as the 18th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons, which also went by the name of Hale&#x27;s Light Horse. Colonel Hale chose for the regiment: the Death&#x27;s Head with the motto &quot;Or Glory&quot;.
The regiment saw service in Germany in 1761 and was renumbered the 17th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons in April 1763 In 1764 the regiment went to Ireland. In May 1766 it was renumbered again, this time as the 3rd Regiment of Light Dragoons. It regained the 17th numeral in 1769 as the 17th Regiment of (Light) Dragoons.

=== American Revolution ===
Led by Lt Col Samuel Birch, the regiment was sent to North America in 1775, arriving in Boston, then besieged by American rebels in the American Revolutionary War. It fought in the Battle of Bunker Hill, a costly British victory, in June 1775. The regiment was withdrawn to Halifax. It fought at the Battle of Long Island in August 1776 at the Battle of White Plains in October 1776 and at the Battle of Fort Washington in November 1776. It was in action again at the Battle of Forts Clinton and Montgomery in October 1777, the Battle of Crooked Billet in May 1778 and the Battle of Barren Hill later that month.

A troop from the 17th was attached to the British Legion, under the command of Colonel Banastre Tarleton, and was engaged in a number of battles of the southern campaign. With regimental pride, the regular dragoons of the 17th preserved an identity separate from the provincial unit. They kept their fading scarlet coats rather than adopting the green of the Legion.

A lieutenant was killed and several private soldiers were killed or wounded at the Battle of Cowpens in January 1781. The Legion cavalry included many volunteers from prisoners captured at the Battle of Camden. These replacements refused orders to engage the enemy at Cowpens. Tarleton combined Legion officers with the men of the 17th and led about 50 in a charge, attempting to support the right flank. Although initially successful, the dragoons were counter-charged by a larger force of concealed Patriot cavalry.

The American War of Independence officially ended in 1783. An officer of the regiment, Captain Stapleton, had the distinction of delivering to George Washington the despatch confirming the declaration of the cessation of hostilities.

=== French Revolutionary Wars ===
The regiment returned to Ireland, where it remained until 1795, when it sailed for the West Indies to reinforce depleted forces battling the French. Two troops were used to suppress an uprising by &quot;Maroons&quot; in Jamaica soon after arriving in the Caribbean. Other detachments were embarked aboard HMS &quot;Success&quot; as &quot;&quot;. Their experience at sea has been suggested by regimental historians to have gained the regiment the nickname &quot;Horse Marines&quot;. The regiment returned to England in August 1797. It was based in Ireland again from May 1803 to winter 1805.

===Napoleonic Wars===

In 1806, the regiment took part in the British invasions of the River Plate in Spanish-controlled South America, then an ally of France during the Napoleonic Wars. Sir Home Riggs Popham had orchestrated an expedition against South America without the British government&#x27;s sanction. This invasion failed, but a second invasion was launched. The regiment was part of this second force, under Sir Samuel Auchmuty. The British force besieged and captured Montevideo. In 1807, the regiment was part of the force, now under John Whitelocke, that tried to capture Buenos Aires, but this failed abysmally. The British force (including the regiment), was forced to surrender, and did not return home until January 1808.


The regiment was sent to India shortly after returning home. It took part in the attack on the Pindarees in 1817 during the Third Anglo-Maratha War. Disease ravaged the regiment during its residency. While in India, the British Army nominally re-classified the regiment as lancers, and added &quot;lancers&quot; as a subtitle to its regimental designation in 1822. The regiment did not learn of its new status until 1823, when, during a stopover at Saint Helena on its journey back to Britain, a copy of the Army List was obtained. Although the weapon&#x27;s use had endured in parts of continental Europe, the lance had not been in British service for more than a century. Its reintroduction by the Duke of York, Commander-in-Chief of the British Army, owed much to the performance of Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s Polish Uhlans. The lancer regiments adopted their own version of the Uhlan uniform, including the czapka-style headdress.
In 1826, Lord Bingham (later the 3rd Earl of Lucan) became the regiment&#x27;s commanding officer when he bought its lieutenant-colonelcy for the reputed sum of £25,000. During his tenure, Bingham invested heavily in the regiment, purchasing uniforms and horses, giving rise to the regimental nickname &quot;Bingham&#x27;s Dandies&quot;.

=== Crimean War ===
The regiment landed at Calamita Bay near Eupatoria in September 1854 for service in the Crimean War and saw action, as part of the light brigade under the command of Major General the Earl of Cardigan, at the Battle of Alma in September 1854. The regiment, commanded by Captain William Morris, was in the first line of cavalry on the left flank during the Charge of the Light Brigade at the Battle of Balaclava in October 1854. The brigade drove through the Russian artillery before smashing straight into the Russian cavalry and pushing them back; it was unable to consolidate its position, however, having insufficient forces and had to withdraw to its starting position, coming under further attack as it did so. The regiment lost 7 officers and 67 men in the debacle. The regiment went on to take part in the Siege of Sevastopol in winter 1854. After the inception of the Victoria Cross in 1856, three members of the regiment received the award for acts of gallantry in the charge: These were Troop Sergeant-Major John Berryman, Sergeant-Major Charles Wooden, and Sergeant John Farrell.

=== Victorian era ===
In December 1857 the regiment arrived in India to reinforce the effort to suppress the Indian rebellion against British rule. By the time the regiment was prepared for service, the rebellion was effectively over, although it did take part in the pursuit of Tatya Tope, the rebel leader. During the course of the pursuit, Lieutenant Evelyn Wood earned the Victoria Cross for gallantry. The regiment returned to England in 1865. The regiment became the 17th Regiment of Lancers in August 1861. When, in 1876, it gained Prince George, Duke of Cambridge as its colonel-in-chief, the regiment adopted the title of the 17th (The Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own) Lancers.

The regiment was sent to Natal Colony for service in the Anglo-Zulu War and fought at the Battle of Ulundi under Sir Drury Curzon Drury-Lowe in July 1879. The regiment was deployed inside a large British infantry square during the attack by the Zulu Army, which had surrounded the British. When the attack appeared to be wavering, the regiment was ordered to advance: their charge routed the warriors with heavy loss and proved to be decisive. The regiment returned to India the same year, remaining there until about 1890 when they returned to England.

===Second Boer War===

In February 1900 a contingent from the regiment, comprising Lieutenant-Colonel E. F. Herbert and 500 troops, was deployed to South Africa for service in the Second Boer War, and arrived to Cape Town on the SS &quot;Victorian&quot; early the next month. The contingent missed the large pitched battles, but still saw action during the war. In 1900, Sergeant Brian Lawrence won the regiment&#x27;s fifth and final Victoria Cross at Essenbosch Farm. The contingent&#x27;s most significant action was at the Battle of Elands River (Modderfontein) in September 1901. C Squadron was attacked by a unit of Boers under the command of Jan Smuts; the Lancers mistakenly assumed the unit was friendly because of their attire. The Boers immediately opened fire, attacking from both the front and the rear. The Lancers suffered further casualties at a closed gate that slowed them down. Only Captain Sandeman, the squadron commander, and Lieutenant Lord Vivian survived. The regiment suffered 29 killed and 41 wounded before surrendering, while Boer losses were just one killed and six wounded.

They stayed in South Africa throughout the war, which ended June 1902 with the Peace of Vereeniging. Four months later, 540 officers and men left Cape Town on the SS &quot;German&quot; in late September 1902, and arrived at Southampton in late October, when they were posted to Edinburgh.

=== First World War ===
The regiment, which was based in Sialkot in India at the start of the First World War, landed in France as part of the 2nd (Sialkot) Cavalry Brigade in the 1st Indian Cavalry Division in November 1914 for service on the Western Front. The regiment fought in its conventional cavalry role at the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917. The regiment was transferred to the 7th Cavalry Brigade, part of the 3rd Cavalry Division in February 1918 and was used as mobile infantry, plugging gaps whenever the need arose, both as cavalry and as infantry during the last-gasp German spring offensive.
After the signing of the Armistice on 11 November 1918, the regiment remained in continental Europe, joining the British Army of the Rhine in Cologne, Germany. The regiment then served in County Cork, Ireland, where it operated against the Irish Republican Army during the War of Independence. On 28 September 1920 IRA Volunteers led by Liam Lynch and Ernie O&#x27;Malley, raided the British Army barracks in Mallow, County Cork. They seized weaponry, freed prisoners and killed British serjeant W.G. Gibbs of the 17th Lancers. It was the only British Army barracks to be captured during the war. In 1921, the title of the regiment was altered to the 17th Lancers (Duke of Cambridge&#x27;s Own).

=== Amalgamation ===
The regiment was amalgamated with the 21st Lancers to form the 17th/21st Lancers in 1922.

<text>The BSE SENSEX (also known as the S&amp;P Bombay Stock Exchange Sensitive Index or simply SENSEX) is a free-float market-weighted stock market index of 30 well-established and financially sound companies listed on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The 30 constituent companies which are some of the largest and most actively traded stocks, are representative of various industrial sectors of the Indian economy. Published since 1 January 1986, the S&amp;P BSE SENSEX is regarded as the pulse of the domestic stock markets in India. The base value of the SENSEX was taken as &quot;100&quot; on 1 April 1979 and its base year as &quot;1978–79&quot;. On 25 July 2001, BSE launched DOLLEX-, a dollar-linked version of the SENSEX.

== Etymology ==
The term Sensex was coined by Deepak Mohoni, a stock market analyst in 1989. BSE Sensitive Index then was at about 750 points. Sensex is a portmanteau of the words Sensitive and Index.

==Calculation==

The BSE has some reviews and modifies its composition to be sure it reflects current market conditions. The index is calculated based on a free float capitalisation method, a variation of the market capitalisation method. Instead of using a company&#x27;s outstanding shares it uses its float, or shares that are readily available for trading. Free Floating capital implies total capitalization less Directors shareholding.
As per free float capitalisation methodology, the level of index at any point of time reflects the free float market value of 30 constituent stocks relative to a base period. The market capitalisation of a company is determined by multiplying the price of its stock by the number of shares issued by corporate actions, replacement of scrips. The index has increased by over twenty five times from June 1990 to the present. Using information from April 1979 onwards, the long-run rate of return on the S&amp;P BSE SENSEX works 18.6% per annum.

&quot;The following is a timeline on the rise of the SENSEX through Indian stock market history.&quot;

*1000, 25 July 1990 – On 25 July 1990, the SENSEX touched the four-digit figure for the first time and closed at 1,001 in the wake of a good monsoon and excellent corporate results.
*2000, 15 January 1992 – On 15 January 1992, the SENSEX crossed the 2,000 mark and closed at 2,020 followed by the liberal economic policy initiatives undertaken, under the leadership of the then prime minister PV Narasimha Rao, by the then finance minister and former Prime Minister of India Dr. Manmohan Singh.
*3000, 29 February 1992 – On 29 February 1992, the SENSEX surged past the 3,000 mark in the wake of the market-friendly budget announced by Manmohan Singh.
*4000, 30 March 1992 – On 30 March 1992, the SENSEX crossed the 4,000 mark and closed at 4,091 on the expectations of a liberal export-import policy. It was then that the Harshad Mehta scam hit the markets and SENSEX witnessed unabated selling.
*5000, 11 October 1999 – On 11 October 1999, the SENSEX crossed the 5,000 mark, as the Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition won the majority in the 13th Lok Sabha election.
*6000, 11 February 2000 – On 11 February 2000, the information technology boom helped the SENSEX to cross the 6,000 mark and hit an all-time high of 6,006 points. This record would stand for nearly four years, until 2 January 2004, when the SENSEX closed at 6,026.59 points.
*7000, 21 June 2005 – On 20 June 2005, the news of the settlement between the Ambani brothers boosted investor sentiments and the scrips of RIL, Reliance Energy, Reliance Capital and IPCL made huge gains. This helped the SENSEX crossed 7,000 points for the first time.
*8000, 8 September 2005 – On 8 September 2005, the Bombay Stock Exchange&#x27;s benchmark 30-share index – the SENSEX – crossed the 8,000 level following brisk buying by foreign and domestic funds in early trading.
*9000, 9 December 2005 – The SENSEX on 28 November 2005 crossed 9,000 and touched a peak of 9,000.32 points during mid-session at the Bombay Stock Exchange on the back of frantic buying spree by foreign institutional investors and well supported by local operators as well as retail investors. However, it was on 9 December 2005 that the SENSEX first closed at over 9,000 points.
*10,000, 7 February 2006 – The SENSEX on 6 February 2006 touched 10,003 points during mid-session. The SENSEX finally closed above the 10,000 mark on 7 February 2006.
*20,000, 11 December 2007 – The SENSEX on 29 October 2007 crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time during intra-day trading, but closed at 19,977.67 points. However, it was on 11 December 2007 that it finally closed at a figure above 20,000 points on the back of aggressive buying by funds.
*21,000, 5 November 2010 – The SENSEX on 8 January 2008 crossed the 21,000 mark for the first time, reaching an intra-day peak of 21,078 points, before closing at 20,873. However, it was not until 5 November 2010 that the SENSEX closed at 21,004.96, for its first close above 21,000 points. This record would stand for nearly three years, until 30 October 2013, when the SENSEX closed at 21,033.97 points.
*19 February 2013 – SENSEX becomes S&amp;P SENSEX as BSE ties up with Standard and Poor&#x27;s to use the S&amp;P brand for Sensex and other indices.
*13 March 2014 - The SENSEX closes higher than the Hang Seng Index, to become the major Asian stock market index with the highest value, for the first time ever.
*22,000, 24 March 2014 – The SENSEX on 10 March 2014 crossed the 22,000 mark for the first time during intra-day trading. However, it was on 24 March 2014 that the index finally closed above the milestone at 22,095.30.

==The SENSEX since 2006==

===May–December 2006===

On 22 May 2006, the SENSEX plunged by 1,100 points during intra-day trading, leading to the suspension of trading for the first time since 17 May 2004. The volatility of the SENSEX had caused investors to lose ₹6 lakh crore (US$131 billion) within seven trading sessions. The then Finance Minister of India, P. Chidambaram, made an unscheduled press statement when trading was suspended to assure investors that nothing was wrong with the fundamentals of the economy, and advised retail investors to stay invested. When trading resumed after the reassurances of the Reserve Bank of India and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the SENSEX managed to move up 700 points, but still finished the session 457 points in the red.

The SENSEX eventually recovered from the volatility, and on 16 October 2006, the SENSEX closed at an all-time high of 12,928.18 with an intra-day high of 12,953.76. This was a result of increased confidence in the economy and reports that India&#x27;s manufacturing sector grew by 11.1% in August 2006.

*13,000, 30 October 2006 – The SENSEX on 30 October 2006 crossed 13,000 mark for the first time, touching a peak of 13,039.36, before closing at 13,024.26 points. It took 135 days to reach 13,000 from 12,000, and 124 days to reach 13,000 from 12,500.
*14,000, 5 December 2006 – The SENSEX on 5 December 2006 crossed 14,000 mark for the first time, after opening the day with a peak of 14,028 at 9.58 am (IST).

===July–September 2007: Effects of the subprime crisis in U.S.===

*15,000, 6 July 2007- The SENSEX on 6 July 2007 crossed another milestone and reached a magic figure of 15,000. It took 7 months and one day after first reaching the 14,000 milestone to touch this historic milestone.

On 23 July 2007, the SENSEX touched a new high of 15,733 points. On 27 July 2007 the SENSEX witnessed a huge decline because of selling by Foreign Institutional Investors and global cues to come back to 15,160 points by noon. Following global cues and heavy selling in the international markets, the BSE SENSEX fell by 615 points in a single day on 1 August 2007.

*16,000, 19 September 2007- The SENSEX on 19 September 2007 crossed the 16,000 mark, closing at a historic peak of 16,322. The bull hits because of the rate cut of 50 bit/s in the discount rate by the Fed chief Ben Bernanke.
*17,000, 26 September 2007- On 26 September 2007, the SENSEX crossed the 17,000 mark for the first time, creating a record for the second fastest 1000 point gain in just 5 trading sessions. It failed however to sustain the momentum and closed below 17,000. The SENSEX closed above 17,000 for the first time on the following day. Reliance group has been the main contributor in this bull run, contributing 256 points. This also helped Mukesh Ambani&#x27;s net worth to grow to over ₹2 lakh crore ($50 billion). It was also during this record bull run that the SENSEX for the first time zoomed ahead of the Nikkei of Japan.

===October–December 2007: Participatory notes issue===

*18,000, 9 October 2007- The SENSEX crossed the 18,000 mark for the first time on 9 October 2007, gaining 788 points, to close at 18,280. The journey from 17,000 to 18,000 took just 8 trading sessions, which is the third fastest 1000-point rise in the history of the SENSEX.
*19,000, 15 October 2007- The SENSEX crossed the 19,000 mark for the first time on 15 October 2007, gaining 640 points, to close at 19,059. It took just 4 trading sessions for the SENSEX to move from 18,000 to 19,000. This is the fastest 1000-point rise ever for the index. In addition, the rise from 16,000 to 19,000 in 17 trading sessions sets a record for the fastest 3,000-point rally in the history of the SENSEX.

On 16 October 2007, SEBI (Securities &amp; Exchange Board of India) proposed curbs on participatory notes which accounted for roughly 50% of FII investment in 2007. SEBI was not happy with P-notes because it was not possible to know who owned the underlying securities, and hedge funds acting through P-notes might therefore cause volatility in the Indian markets.

However the proposals of SEBI were not clear and this led to a knee-jerk crash when the markets opened on the following day (17 October 2007). Within a minute of opening trade, the SENSEX crashed by 1,744 points or about 9% of its value – the biggest intra-day fall in Indian stock markets in absolute terms until then. This led to the automatic suspension of trade for one hour. Finance Minister P. Chidambaram issued clarifications, in the meantime, that the government was not against FIIs and was not immediately banning PNs. After the market opened at 10:55 am, the index staged a comeback and ended the day at 18715.82, down 336.04 from the last day&#x27;s close.

However, this would not be the end of the volatility. The next day (18 October 2007), the SENSEX tumbled by 717.43 points – 3.83 per cent – to close at 17,998.39 points. The slide continued the next day (19 October 2007), when the SENSEX fell 438.41 points to settle at 17,559.98 to the end of the week, after touching the lowest level of that week at 17,226.18 during the day.

After detailed clarifications from the SEBI chief M. Damodaran regarding the new rules, the market made an 879-point gain on 23 October, thus signalling the end of the PN crisis.

*20,000, 11 December 2007- On 29 October 2007, the SENSEX crossed the 20,000 mark for the first time with a massive 734.5-point gain, but closed below the 20,000 mark. The SENSEX would close above the 20,000 mark for the first time on 11 December 2007. It took 42 days after reaching the 19,000 milestone to close above 20,000 points for the first time. The journey of the last 10,000 points was covered in just 483 sessions, compared to 7,297 sessions taken to touch the 10,000 mark from its base value of 100 points. In the second half of 2007 alone, the SENSEX reached six 1,000-point milestones.

===May 2009===

On 18 May 2009, the SENSEX surged up 2,110.79 points to close at 14,285.21, from its previous closing of 12,174.42, for its largest single day rally. Less than a month later, on 4 June 2009, the SENSEX would cross the 15,000 mark.

However, the SENSEX remained volatile during the summer of 2009. The SENSEX plunged by 869.65 points on 6 July 2009, the day of Union Budget presentation in Parliament on concerns over high fiscal deficit. This was the biggest Budget-day loss for the index. On 17 August 2009, the SENSEX lost 626.71 points.

Once again, the SENSEX would recover from the volatility. On 7 September 2009, the SENSEX crossed the 16,000 mark, closing at 16,016.32 points. The index would gain 3,000 points over the next 12 months, as the SENSEX crossed the 19,000 mark on 13 September 2010, closing at 19,208.33 points.

*21,000, 5 November 2010 - The SENSEX closed at 21,004.96, for its first close above the 21,000 mark. It would take nearly three years for the index to make its next close above this level.
*22,000, 24 March 2014 - The SENSEX closed at 22,055.48, for its first close above the 22,000 mark. For the first time, the SENSEX zoomed ahead of the Hang Seng Index.

*27,000, 2 September 2014 - The SENSEX closed at 27019.39, for its first close above the 27,000 mark,
*28,000, 5 November 2014 - The SENSEX crossed 28,000 mark, on 5 November 2014. This is the seventh 1000-point milestone the index has crossed in 2014, breaking the six 1000-point record set in 2007.

==Major SENSEX stock market plunges==
===January 2008===

In the third week of January 2008, the SENSEX experienced huge falls along with other markets around the world. On 21 January 2008, the SENSEX saw its highest ever loss of 1,408 points at the end of the session. The SENSEX recovered to close at 17,605.40 after it tumbled to the day&#x27;s low of 16,963.96, on high volatility as investors panicked following weak global cues amid fears of a recession in US.

The next day, the BSE SENSEX index went into a free fall. The index hit the lower circuit breaker in barely a minute after the markets opened at 10 am. Trading was suspended for an hour. On reopening at 10.55 am IST, the market saw its biggest intra-day fall when it hit a low of 15,332, down 2,273 points.

<doc id="1107106" wikidata="Q1628056" url="?curid=1107106" title="Paroo River">
<text>The Paroo River, a series of waterholes, connected in wet weather as a running stream of the Darling catchment within the Murray–Darling basin, is located in the South West region of Queensland and Far West region of New South Wales, Australia. It is the home of the Paarkantji people.

Paroo is the local Aboriginal word for the bony bream fish, which are common in the river.

==Course and features==
The river rises in the gorge country of western Queensland south of the Mariala National Park, and flows generally south and spreads into the vast floodplains of New South Wales, eventually reaching the Paroo overflow lakes. Most commonly, the Paroo River terminates on the floodplain south of Wanaaring; and only reaches the Darling River in the wettest of years, otherwise spilling into the Paroo River Wetlands. The river is joined by forty-three minor tributaries; as it descends over its course.

The Paroo River is the last remaining free-flowing river in the northern part of the Murray-Darling basin, and is impounded by the natural formation of the Buckenby Waterhole, Humeburn Waterhole, Corni Paroo Waterhole, Caiwarro Waterhole, Thoulcanna Dam, Talyealye Billabong and Budtha Waterhole.

===Wetlands===
The Paroo River wetlands in north-western New South Wales are important for threatened species such as the freckled duck and the Australian painted snipe. The wetlands lie within the Paroo Floodplain and Currawinya Important Bird Area, identified as such by BirdLife International because of its importance, when conditions are suitable, for large numbers of waterbirds.

On 20 September 2007, Malcolm Turnbull, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, announced that the Paroo River Wetlands in north-west New South Wales would be listed under the Ramsar Convention as wetlands of international importance, making them Australia&#x27;s 65th Ramsar site.

== Cultural references ==
Henry Lawson described the ephemeral nature of the Paroo River in a poem, &quot;The Paroo &#x27;River&#x27;&quot; (1894):But soon he saw a strip of ground

That crossed the track we followed— 

No barer than the surface round

But just a little hollowed.

<doc id="1107109" wikidata="Q1008088" url="?curid=1107109" title="Ezra Hendrickson">
<text>Ezra Hendrickson (born 16 January 1972) is a Vincentian professional football coach and former player. He was the head coach of Major League Soccer club Chicago Fire FC from November 24, 2021 until his dismissal on May 8, 2023 and is now the manager of the Vincentian national team.

Born in Layou, Hendrickson moved with his family to the United States at a young age and played college soccer with the Drake Bulldogs. A defender, he began his senior career with semi-professional clubs Des Moines Menace and New Orleans Riverboat Gamblers before being drafted in the 1997 MLS Supplemental Draft by the NY/NJ MetroStars. He was cut midseason by the MetroStars before joining the Los Angeles Galaxy. While with the Galaxy, Hendrickson formed part of the defense that would go on to win the Supporters&#x27; Shield in 1998 and then both the Shield and MLS Cup in 2002. In 2003, Hendrickson was traded by the Galaxy to the Dallas Burn.

Following the 2003 season, Hendrickson joined A-League club Charleston Battery before quickly moving back to Major League Soccer, joining D.C. United. With D.C. United, Hendrickson won his second MLS Cup but was an unused substitute during the match. He then moved to Chivas USA before joining the Columbus Crew in 2006. Hendrickson ended his playing career in 2008, winning both his third MLS Cup and second Supporters&#x27; Shield. He was also capped 36 times for the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national team, scoring two goals internationally.

In 2009, Hendrickson began his coaching career, joining Major League Soccer expansion club Seattle Sounders FC as an assistant to his former head coach, Sigi Schmid. While an assistant, he would often coach the club&#x27;s reserve side, finally becoming the first head coach of their professional reserve affiliate, Seattle Sounders FC 2, in 2015. While coaching with Sounders FC 2, Hendrickson was also an assistant with the Vincentian national team. He left both roles in 2018, returning as an assistant to Sigi Schmid with the LA Galaxy. From 2019 to 2021, he joined the Columbus Crew as an assistant to Caleb Porter before being announced as the head coach of the Chicago Fire for the 2022 season.

==Early life==
Hendrickson was born in Layou, St. Vincent. He played club soccer and varsity basketball at Western High School in Russiaville, Indiana. He then played college soccer at Drake University from 1990 to 1993, where he was named all-Missouri Valley Conference three times, and was named an NSCAA third team All-American as a senior.

Upon graduating, Hendrickson joined the amateur Des Moines Menace in 1994, where he played striker, scoring 13 goals in his first year. After a season with the Menace, Hendrickson was signed to a professional contract by the New Orleans Riverboat Gamblers of the USISL. Hendrickson played for the Riverboat Gamblers, and was named Select League Defender of the Year in 1996.

==Professional career==
After his exceptional 1996 season, Hendrickson was drafted 5th overall in the 1997 MLS Supplemental Draft by the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, for whom he played eight matches in 1997. During his time with NY/NJ, fans gave him the nickname &#x27;The Caribbean Beckenbauer&#x27;. Midseason, Hendrickson was cut and picked up by the Los Angeles Galaxy, where he solidified his role as a starter, and earn a reputation as one of the best wing backs in MLS. After seven seasons with the Galaxy, Hendrickson was traded to the Dallas Burn in 2003.

When the Burn reorganised the team following their 2003 campaign, Hendrickson found himself without a team in MLS, and briefly signed with the Charleston Battery of the A-League. However, not long into the 2004 season, D.C. United acquired him to play a backup role in their central defence. Hendrickson was selected fifth overall by C.D. Chivas USA in the Expansion Draft after the season. After a year with Chivas, he was on a move again, sent to Columbus early in the 2006 season. He retired after helping the Crew to its first MLS title during the 2008 season.

==International==
Hendrickson also spent time as the captain of the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national team, and was one of the team&#x27;s best players since earning his first cap in 1995 against Barbados. He made 24 appearances for Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the 1998, 2002, and 2006 World Cup qualifiers and 123 overall, scoring twice during a 1996 Caribbean Cup match against Haiti on 27 May 1996.

==Coaching career==
After retiring, Hendrickson joined the staff of Seattle Sounders FC, working as an assistant to his former coach, Sigi Schmid. After managing the Sounders reserves for several seasons, he was named head coach for Seattle Sounders FC 2 upon the club&#x27;s entry into the United Soccer League.

===Chicago Fire===
On 24 November 2021, Hendrickson was appointed head coach at Major League Soccer club Chicago Fire from the 2022 season.

On May 8, 2023, with the club in second-to-last place in the Eastern Conference through 10 matches, the Fire announced that Hendrickson had been relieved of his duties, along with assistant coach Junior Gonzalez.

<text>Lot Smith (May 15, 1830 – June 20, 1892) was a Mormon pioneer, soldier, lawman and American frontiersman. He became known as &quot;The Horseman&quot; for his exceptional skills on horseback as well as for his help in rounding up wild mustangs on Utah&#x27;s Antelope Island. He is most famous for his exploits during the 1857 Utah War.

Smith practiced the Latter-day Saint doctrine of plural marriage, and had eight wives and 52 children.

== Background ==

Born in 1830 in Williamstown, Oswego County, New York, Lot, with his parents and other children in the family, left New York to be with other members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. The Smith family lived across the Mississippi River from Nauvoo, Illinois and were neighbors with Brigham Young&#x27;s family. Lot was 14 years old when Joseph Smith, beloved as a prophet, was murdered. In 1846, while the family fled the continuing persecution of Mormons, Lot&#x27;s mother was one of many Mormons who died and were buried in Iowa Territory.

== Mormon Battalion ==

At sixteen, Smith joined the Mormon Battalion and served during the Mexican–American War making a journey, one of the most arduous overland marches in American history, from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas through the southwest to San Diego, where the battalion was mustered out of service.

== Fortunes of Life ==
After mustering out in California, other members of the Mormon Battalion worked at Sutter&#x27;s Mill and discovered gold. Smith amassed a quantity of gold then came back across the mountains to the Great Salt Lake and Farmington, Utah, where he married, became a military leader in the Nauvoo Legion in Utah and was distinguished in campaigns to stop Indian depredations.

== Service in the Battle at Fort Utah ==

In 1850, when Brigham Young called for the extermination of the Timpanogos, Smith volunteered as part of the Mormon militia. On February 8, in what was known as the Battle at Fort Utah, the army attacked the Timpanogos village. On the second day of fighting, he was chosen as part of 16 men to make a charge on a Timpanogos log house, from which the Timpanogos were trying to defend themselves. They successfully took the log cabin, and the Timpanogos retreated. They were able to pursue and kill around 100 Timpanogos people and enslave around 40.

== Service in the Utah War 1857 ==
The President and US Senate had chosen to remove then-governor Brigham Young from office based on reports from federal officials assigned to Utah who had abandoned their assignments and returned to the east. Young&#x27;s replacement as governor of Utah territory Alfred Cumming was escorted by a contingent of 1,400 Federal troops led by Gen. Albert Johnston as part of what was called the Utah Expedition. The army&#x27;s orders were to support the instalment of the new governor, using force as necessary as resistance was expected based on the official&#x27;s reports.

Smith was sent on a special mission by Young, who hoped to delay the arrival of the troops in the hope that a diplomatic breakthrough could be reached before the troops reached Salt Lake City. Smith led a group of Nauvoo Legion rangers east across Wyoming along the stretch where the California, Oregon and Mormon Trails merge. Mormons, including Orrin Porter Rockwell harassed the army by burning the grass along the route, stampeding the army mules, and driving off their cattle. Fort Bridger, Wyoming was burned to the ground. Smith ordered the Union wagon trains of supplies to turn around but they complied only while he was in sight. Then, in one night, Smith and his men burned three wagon trains of supplies (food, clothing, gunpowder and whiskey for an entire army). Lot Smith and his rangers held off the Federal soldiers until an early blizzard and cold winter weather set in. The army was forced to winter near the ruins of Fort Bridger, Wyoming.

Smith&#x27;s efforts and the weather stopped the army - without Mormon troops harming any soldiers on the Federal side. A diplomatic settlement brokered by Col. Thomas L. Kane and the Utah War Peace Commission, allowed Governor Cumming to take office peaceably and protected the civilian population from the army.

== Service in the Civil War ==
Lot Smith commanded a company of volunteer militia mustered mainly from the Nauvoo Legion that, at the request of Abraham Lincoln, guarded the telegraph line in conjunction with the U.S. Army during the Civil War. The Utah Volunteer Cavalry Company served under orders for 90 days during the summer of 1862 and was mustered out of federal service in August having experienced no combat. 

== Elected to public office ==
Lot Smith was the first sheriff of Davis County, Utah. He also served in the Utah Territorial Legislature, serving in the lower house and upper house of the legislature.

== Settlement in Northern Arizona ==
Smith was asked to help the development of the Mormon settlement along the Little Colorado River. Smith led a large group that arrived in the spring of 1876 settling Sunset, Arizona and Brigham City, Arizona near present-day Winslow. Up river, Obed and St. Joseph (now Joseph City, Arizona) were colonized. Local Indians were befriended, Lot Smith became highly respected among the Navajo Indians. The establishment of settlements at the Sunset Crossing of the Little Colorado River was important in facilitating the subsequent Mormon colonization of eastern and central and southern Arizona, eastern New Mexico and even northern Mexico and southern Colorado. All branches of the Honeymoon Trail fanned out from this point. Lot Smith established a United Order at Sunset and became the first LDS Stake President in Arizona. Flash floods, droughts, crop failures, internal dissension, anti-Mormon sentiment and prosecution of polygamous leaders, and the Aztec Land &amp; Cattle Company or Hashknife Outfit all took their toll on the small settlements. Tensions rose. Although Smith&#x27;s inspiring oratory was appreciated, some ran afoul of his temper and others found him heavy-handed and resented his domineering.

Residents gravitated toward the timbered land closer to the Mogollon Rim. Lot Smith built a home at Smith Spring near Mormon Lake and directed the establishment of a dairy, sawmill and ranching operations in the area.

== Gunplay ==

Seeking to displace the Circle S ranching operations, a sheepman named Daggs hired a Hashknife cowboy/gunman named Thistle to eliminate Lot Smith. The strategy was to pick a fight with the targeted person, get him to draw, then shoot him and claim self-defense. Daggs and Thistle encountered Smith working livestock in his corral with two young sons. Thistle proceeded to goad Smith to anger. Smith turned and began walking to his house to get a firearm. Daggs urged Thistle to &quot;Shoot him now.&quot; Thistle declined to shoot an unarmed man in the back. Smith returned with a rifle and saw Thistle&#x27;s pistol and hand starting to come out from where Thistle had taken cover. Shooting from the hip, Smith hit Thistle&#x27;s pistol and amputated one of Thistle&#x27;s fingers. That was the end of the gunfight but not the end of the trouble. Knowing Lot Smith was already subject to a federal warrant for polygamy, Daggs instigated another warrant for the arrest of Smith for the &quot;assault&quot; on Thistle. Smith, respected by local lawmen, was able to appear in court for an acquittal and avoid federal arrest. Daggs moved his sheep away and into the Tonto Basin, fueling the smoldering Tewksberry - Graham feud into the conflagration of the Pleasant Valley War.

== Death ==

After 1886, with the collapse of the Sunset community and Smith&#x27;s release from presiding church office, along with crippling injuries from farm machinery and continuing threat of prosecution for polygamy, Smith&#x27;s star was descendant. In 1892 he had taken up residence in cabins with two wives in Big Canyon, east of Tuba City, Arizona where Mormons had early proselytized local Hopi and Navajo Native Americans.

Although relations with the Indians, especially the Hopi, were initially cooperative, the growing numbers of Mormons in the Tuba City area began to cause friction in an area with limited water, grazing and farming resources. Non-Mormons were also jealous of the Mormon influence in the area. Another plot was hatched to eliminate the old Mormon, Lot Smith, and to spark conflict between the Mormons and the Native Americans. This time some of the war-like Navajo were chosen as pawns and scapegoats.

On June 20, 1892, Smith found a flock of sheep turned into his fenced field of new barley by Navajo sheepherders. Horseback, Smith tried to drive the sheep out but Navajos at the gate repeatedly used their blankets to shoo the animals back in. Angered, Smith returned to his cabin to get his pistol. His wife, fearful of the consequences, pleaded with him not to go back. His ire kindled, Smith returned to his barley crop and again tried to drive the sheep out. Now, each time a sheep was shooed back from the gate, Smith would shoot the animal. The Indians retaliated in kind, shooting several of Smith&#x27;s nearby milch cows.

At an impasse, Smith began to ride away back to his cabin. Along the way a pistol-packing Navajo, Cat-chose, had set up to ambush Smith. Nearly simultaneously, Smith was shot in the back by a rifle and mortally wounded. Smith died that evening, accompanied by keening mourning of a crowd of Native American friends and onlookers. Although the plotters succeeded in killing Lot Smith, they were thwarted in their attempt to spark a conflict between the Mormons and the Native Americans. The local Mormon community was stunned and saddened by the loss of a patriarch, but revenge was forestalled by the local Mormon bishop who advised the community to &quot;do nothing and say nothing.&quot;

Smith was buried near his cabin. A decade later, due to his grave being full of natural spring water, his remains were returned with great pomp and ceremony to Farmington, Utah where his grave became something of a symbol of the Mormon pioneer as frontiersman, soldier, and Indian fighter.

<text>Lisette, Marquise de Brinon (1896 – 26 March 1982) was best known as the Jewish wife of the pro-Nazi French collaborator, Fernand de Brinon.

==Biography==
Born Jeanne Louise Rachel Franck, she lived in an internal exile throughout the Second World War. Declared an &quot;honorary Aryan&quot;, she was not deported to her death, but neither was she welcome in Vichy or in Paris.

Born to a family of Jewish bankers in Paris and formerly married to a Jewish banker Claude Ullmann, Lisette de Brinon was an inveterate socialite, surrounding herself with notables of the left (Léon Blum) and of the right (Pierre Drieu la Rochelle). Emmanuel Berl, best known for writing some of Philippe Pétain&#x27;s early speeches, was a first cousin. She converted from Judaism to Catholicism.

Her second husband, Fernand, Marquis de Brinon, was a Catholic aristocrat who distinguished himself with an early scoop interview with Adolf Hitler, and became one of the architects of French collaboration after France&#x27;s catastrophic defeat at the hands of the Nazis in June 1940. As the war progressed, the couple were distanced partly by Lisette&#x27;s inconvenient Jewishness, and also because of Brinon&#x27;s long-term affair with his secretary Simone Mittre. Lisette attempted to follow Brinon when the Vichy government fled to exile in the castle of the Sigmaringen enclave following the Allied liberation. Although she managed to risk death by entering Germany, she never reached the castle.

Brinon and her husband were captured by Allied Forces and taken to stand trial in Toulouse. She was imprisoned briefly while her husband was found guilty of treason and executed in 1947. She was a friend of another collaborator, Jacques Benoist-Méchin.

She died in 1982 in a nursing home in the Paris suburb of Montmorency.

<text>Thurmaston is a village and civil parish in Leicestershire, England, located within the Borough of Charnwood. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 9,668. It is pronounced &quot;Thurmston&quot;.

It is situated four miles north of the city centre of Leicester and lies just outside the A563, Leicester&#x27;s outer ring road.

== History and geography ==

Thurmaston is bounded to the west by Watermead Country Park (which faces onto Birstall), to the north by Syston and to the east by Barkby and Barkby Thorpe. South of Thurmaston is Rushey Mead and the boundaries of the Leicester urban area.

Rushey Mead was formerly part of the Thurmaston parish in the 19th century, before becoming a Thurmaston Urban District in 1894. In 1935, the district was annexed to the city of Leicester where it took its modern-day name of Rushey Mead.

Thurmaston is split in two by the A607 dual carriageway, which by-passes the main village. To the east of the road is the mostly residential, newer part of Thurmaston. To the west is the main village on Melton Road, which stands on the old Fosse Way, the historic road built by the Romans. Thurmaston lies on the eastern banks of the River Soar, and two marinas are located there, one of which is also a boat-yard, and numerous mooring sites. These lead to the Watermead Country Park which is a purpose-built nature reserve.

The Midland Main Line also runs through the eastern half of the village.
Taylorcraft Aeroplanes Ltd., a subsidiary based in Thurmaston, developed the Taylorcraft Model &#x27;D&#x27; and the Auster Mk. I through Mk. V, which became the backbone aircraft of the British A.O.P.

The local football team, the Thurmaston Magpies, once boasted former England international striker/defender Dion Dublin in its ranks.

The Thurmaston depot and headquarters of Arriva Midlands are located on Westmoreland Avenue within the village.

==Education==
Thurmaston contains three Key Stages 1 and 2 primary schools:
* Bishop Ellis Catholic Primary School
* Eastfield Primary School
* Church Hill Infant School and Church Hill C of E Junior School
It also contains a Key Stage 3 secondary school, The Roundhill Academy, which takes in students from all the aforementioned schools in the village, as well as schools in the neighbouring town of Syston.

==Facilities==

Thurmaston&#x27;s prominent location on the edge of Leicester has seen much development in recent years. On 31 March 2003, a large Asda superstore opened on Barkby Thorpe Lane, pushing the nearby Midlands Co-op superstore out of business. The Thurmaston Shopping Centre, featuring a number of retail outlets and restaurants, was built on the site of the old Co-op superstore in 2005. In 2012 following the redevelopment of the North Thurmaston Industrial Estate Costco opened a wholesale store in Thurmaston called Costco Leicester also on the site other smaller stores as well as a Wickes has been constructed on the site.

The main village stretch, along Melton Road, has several pubs, takeaway food outlets, convenience stores and various other small retail establishments. The head offices of Arriva Midlands are also located in the village, along with Arriva&#x27;s Thurmaston depot where the majority of their buses and drivers that operate in Leicester are based.

As well as many other industrial sites along Melton Road, Thurmaston also contains the Earls Way Industrial Estate in the eastern half of the village.

The village has its own newspaper, &quot;The Thurmaston Times&quot; which is published bi-monthly. The village has a local history society, &quot;Thurmaston Heritage Group&quot;, whose members help promote an interest in different aspects of both past and present village life. One particular activity being pursued by a member of the group is the creation of an online virtual war memorial. The &quot;Thurmaston Military Indexes&quot; are being compiled to provide a listing of all those from the village who served their country in the Great War of 1914-1918 and the 1939-1945 War.

The village also has its own community centre, &quot;Elizabeth Park Sports and Community Centre&quot;, which has become a popular wedding venue and also offers a range of sports and facilities including badminton and a state of the art 3G football pitch. The facility was built in 1996, and is home to Thurmaston Parish Council Offices. Elizabeth Park is also host to many of the local communities sports teams, such as Thurmaston DPC FC, Thurmaston Magpies FC and Thurmaston Bowls club.

===Landmarks===
Thurmaston has numerous landmarks these range from local oddities, the most famous of which being the Church Hill Road Bridge which is notorious for its flooding, to interesting historical titbits including a Statue of William Lane a British soldier tragically murdered in the village and a portion of the surviving west wall from St John the Evangelist Church which had been demolished by the late 1600&#x27;s 

===Public transport===
Thurmaston is served by a number of bus companies including Arriva Midlands, First Leicester and Centrebus with multiple stops up and down the main village and on the duel carriageway. The nearest railway station is in Syston. Charnwood borough council&#x27;s local transport plan from 2004 proposed new railway stations to be opened at Thurmaston and East Goscote. This has since been cancelled and removed from the local plan.

<doc id="1107135" wikidata="Q6731116" url="?curid=1107135" title="Maginnis &amp; Walsh">
<text>Maginnis &amp; Walsh was a Boston-based architecture firm started by Charles Donagh Maginnis and Timothy Francis Walsh in 1905. It was known for its innovative design of churches in Boston in the first half of the 20th century.

==Partners==

Maginnis was born January 7, 1867, in Derry, Ireland. He emigrated to Boston at age 18 and got his first job apprenticing for architect Edmund M. Wheelwright as a draftsman. Influenced by the work of modern architect Ralph Adams Cram, Maginnis became a distinguished Gothic architect and an articulate writer and orator on the role of architecture in society. In 1948, Maginnis received the AIA Gold Medal for &quot;outstanding service to American architecture,&quot; the highest award in the profession. He died in 1955 at the age of 88 in Brookline, Massachusetts.

Timothy Francis Walsh was born in 1868 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He attended The English High School in Boston, and worked as a draftsman for Peabody and Stearns from 1887 to 1893, when he left to study in Europe. Walsh returned to Boston in 1895 and went into business as Walsh &amp; Kearns. He worked as a solo practitioner in 1896 and 1897, and 1898 went into partnership with Charles Donagh Maginnis and Matthew Sullivan. He died on July 7, 1934, at the age of 66 in North Scituate, Massachusetts.

Matthew Sullivan was born in Boston and trained in the office of Edmund M. Wheelwright, Boston City Architect (1891-1894). Sullivan succeeded Wheelwright as City Architect and served in that position from 1895 to 1901, when he became a junior partner in the firm of Maginnis, Walsh and Sullivan, which was widely known for its ecclesiastical work. He withdrew from that partnership to carry on work independently in 1906.

Between the firm&#x27;s founding in 1898 and the death of Timothy Walsh in 1934, the firm is credited with over 115 ecclesiastical works. The Maginnis and Walsh collection at the Boston Public Library contains work of the architectural firm from 1913 to 1952.

Eugene F. Kennedy Jr. was born in Brooklyn, New York City, on January 31, 1904, to Eugene F. Kennedy Sr. and Anna T. Lee. The family had moved to the Boston area by 1910. In 1924, he was awarded the Rotch Traveling Scholarship, established by architect Arthur Rotch to provide an American student of architecture a minimum of eight months study and travel abroad. Kennedy joined M&amp;W in 1926, and married Carol Gertrude Fox (1903-1975) in 1928. He became a senior partner in the firm in 1941, which became known as Maginnis and Walsh and Kennedy. Kennedy died November 7, 1986, in Jamaica Plain, Boston.

==Maginnis, Walsh and Sullivan (1898–1905)==

* St. Patrick&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, Whitinsville, Massachusetts, Diocese of Worcester (1898). (very influential, referred to as the &#x27;Concord Bridge&#x27; of Catholic church architecture, Maginnis&#x27; first church).
* St. John the Evangelist Church in Cambridge, Massachusetts: The church was built in 1904, largely built by Irish immigrants. House Speaker &quot;Tip&quot; O&#x27;Neill, was a lifelong parishioner. Modeled after a 12th-century Lombardo-Romanesque basilica, of four gold medals awarded to Maginnis, Walsh and Sullivan from the American Institute of Architects, one was for St. John&#x27;s. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983.
* St. Thomas the Apostle Catholic Church in Los Angeles: The Mission Revival style church was built in 1904. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, said, &quot;In its character this church unites itself with the days of the humble followers of St. Francis, as it is the same form and the same faith, is to a great degree of the same style of architecture and is carried on by the same authority as that of the olden days.&quot;

===Brighton, Massachusetts===

Now a neighborhood of Boston, Brighton was a farming community just northwest of the city. The farms became estates, the estates came into the possession of religious institutes. M&amp;W had a number of commissions in Brighton.

One of the earliest was St. John&#x27;s Seminary Chapel in Brighton, designed in 1898 in the Romanesque Revival style. It was constructed in 1899 of yellow and gray Brighton pudding stone with limestone trimmings. Our Lady of the Presentation Catholic Church in the Oak Square neighborhood of the Brighton section of Boston was begun in 1913 and completed in 1921. The parish closed in 2005; in 2013 the building was reopened as St. John&#x27;s Seminary Our Lady of the Presentation Lecture Hall and Library.

The Convent of the Sisters of the Cenacle in Brighton was built in 1911. The building now houses the EF Language Institute.

In 1908, the Passionist Fathers purchased the David Nevins Estate in Brighton and built St. Gabriel&#x27;s Monastery. In 1927, M&amp;W was engaged to design a church to replace the chapel. St. Gabriel&#x27;s is in the Renaissance Revival architecture style, constructed of buff-colored brick with cast stone accents and red mission tile roof. Due to personnel shortages, the monastery closed in 1978; St. Gabriel&#x27;s Parish Church in 2006. In 2017 plans were approved to convert the monastery property into a combination of condominiums and apartments, largely geared to graduate students. The plan also has an affordable housing component. St. Gabriel&#x27;s Church is to be retained and renovated as a community center.

==Maginnis and Walsh (1906–1940)==

In the Boston area, the firm built St. Catherine of Genoa Church on Spring Hill in Somerville, Massachusetts, regarded as a masterpiece. St. Catherine&#x27;s, was begun in 1907 and completed in 1921. In July 2019, St. Catherine&#x27;s. St. Ann&#x27;s, and St. Thomas merged to form Sts. Louis and Zelie Martin Parish; masses are still scheduled at St. Catherine&#x27;s.

St. Mary&#x27;s School in Taunton, Massachusetts, built in 1907, is a three-story brick building in Collegiate Gothic style. The Girls&#x27; Latin School, Huntington Avenue Building was built in 1907 in collaboration with Peabody &amp; Stearns and Coolidge &amp; Carlson.

In 1914, the firm designed the administration building of Emmanuel College. Located in the Fens area of Boston, it was founded by the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur and opened in 1919 as the first women&#x27;s Catholic college in New England. For thirty years, it was the only building on campus.

The firm also designed St. Edward&#x27;s church in Brockton, Massachusetts, in 1914. St. Edward&#x27;s Church was founded in 1915, and merged with St. Nicholas Church in Abington, Massachusetts, in 2003, with the combined parish being renamed St. Edith Stein. St. Edith Stein parish bears striking resemblance to Ascension of Our Lord Church in Montreal, Canada, which is another church designed by the firm.

The Church of Ascension of Our Lord was built between 1927 and 1928, for the English-speaking Roman Catholic population in Westmount municipality of Montreal, Canada, on land originally belonging to the Grey Nuns. It was designed by Maginnis &amp; Walsh of Boston, with Edward J. Turcotte of Montreal as Associate Architect. Its architect, Maginnis &amp; Walsh was “based in Boston and was considered the foremost specialist in Catholic ecclesiastical architecture of the period. The church is built on a monumental scale. Although its architectural style looks to the Gothic churches of Europe, its construction was modern for the period: a steel frame, encased in brick or concrete and clad in Montreal limestone, with Berea sandstone trim. The plan is a conventional Latin cross, the intersection of the nave and the transepts marked by an imposing bell tower. The front façade, facing Sherbrooke Street, is dominated by a gabled wall, flanked by shallow buttresses. Three lancet windows surmount a secondary, projecting gable, which contains the central entrance.” Ascension of Our Lord Church&#x27;s design may be based on or influenced by the firm&#x27;s 1914 design of St. Edward&#x27;s Church (now St. Edith Stein Church) in Brockton, MA.

In 1929 the firm designed Our Lady of Sorrows Church in South Orange, New Jersey, in the French Gothic style, to replace the 1889 St Mary&#x27;s.

===Boston College, Chestnut Hill===
Maginnis &amp; Walsh won the bid to build the new campus of Boston College in Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts. Designed by Maginnis, in 1908, the Boston College campus is a seminal example of Collegiate Gothic architecture. Combining Gothic Revival architecture with principles of Beaux-Arts planning, Maginnis proposed a vast complex of academic buildings set in a cruciform plan. The design suggested an enormous outdoor cathedral, with the long entry drive at the &quot;nave,&quot; the main quadrangle at the &quot;apse&quot; and secondary quadrangles at the &quot;transepts.&quot; 

Maginnis&#x27;s design broke from the traditional Oxbridge models that had inspired it, and that had until then characterized Gothic architecture on American campuses. At the &quot;crossing&quot;, Maginnis placed the university&#x27;s main building. Using stone quarried on the site, the building was constructed at the highest point on Chestnut Hill, commanding a view of the surrounding landscape and the city to the east. In its unprecedented scale, Gasson Tower was conceived not as the belfry of a singular building, but as the crowning campanile of Maginnis&#x27; new &quot;city upon a hill&quot;. Dominated by a soaring 200-foot bell tower, Recitation Hall was known simply as the &quot;Tower Building&quot; when it finally opened in 1913. Gasson Hall is credited for the typology of dominant Gothic towers in subsequent campus designs, including those at Princeton University (Cleveland Tower, 1913–1917), Yale University (Harkness Tower, 1917–1921), and Duke University (Chapel Tower, 1930–1935).

Although Maginnis&#x27; ambitious Gothic project never saw full completion due to the Wall Street Crash of 1929, its central portion was built according to plan and forms the core of what is now Boston College&#x27;s middle campus. According to Boston College historian, Fr. Charles F. Donovan, Gasson Hall (1913), the signature building of Boston College, St. Mary&#x27;s Hall and Chapel (1917), Devlin Hall (1924), and Bapst Library (commissioned 1922, completed 1928), called the &quot;finest example of Collegiate Gothic architecture in America&quot;), are the &quot;original architectural gems&quot; of the campus. 

In 1926, the Devlin Hall science building won the Harleston Parker Medal for &quot;most beautiful building in Boston&quot;. M&amp;W also built Fulton Hall (1948), Lyons Hall (1951), St. Thomas More Hall (1954 -demolished 2014), and Campion (1955).

Maginnis also designed the chancel at Trinity Church in Copley Square, the high altar at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Midtown Manhattan, and the Massachusetts Veterans War Memorial Tower on the summit of Mount Greylock.

The firm also built St. Aidan&#x27;s Church in Brookline, Massachusetts in 1911, where Maginnis was a parishioner and where former U.S. President John F. Kennedy was christened; St. Aidan&#x27;s, has since been closed and converted to housing.

==Maginnis and Walsh and Kennedy (1941–1956)==
Maginnis designed the bronze doors at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral to replace the original wooden ones. Each 16 1/2-foot by 5 1/2-foot door weighs 9,200 pounds and is decorated with sculptures of saints created by John Angel. The doors were blessed by Cardinal Spellman and opened for the first time just before Christmas 1949. In 2013, the doors underwent a major conservation and restoration.

Maginnis and Walsh were the original architects for St. Julia Church, in Weston, Massachusetts, in 1919. The firm returned in 1961 to design an addition to the back of St. Julia Church to increase seating capacity.

<doc id="1107159" wikidata="Q351188" url="?curid=1107159" title="Paul Levitz">
<text>Paul Levitz (; born October 21, 1956) is an American comic book writer, editor and executive. The president of DC Comics from 2002 to 2009, he worked for the company for over 35 years in a wide variety of roles. Along with publisher Jenette Kahn and managing editor Dick Giordano, Levitz was responsible for hiring such writers as Marv Wolfman and Alan Moore, artists such as George Pérez, Keith Giffen, and John Byrne, and editor Karen Berger, who contributed to the 1980s revitalization of the company&#x27;s line of comic book heroes.

==Early life==
Levitz was born and raised in East Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York. His father was a clerk for an industrial hardware store, and his mother was a bookkeeper. He was an avid reader as a child, and read the works of writers including Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, and Ed McBain. He also read comics, citing the first he could remember buying off of a newsstand being the first team-up between the Justice League and the Justice Society. He was notably a fan of Superman and the Legion of Super-Heroes. Most of what he read was from DC Comics, but cited Marvel Comics&#x27; Avengers as a strong influence on his writing.

He attended Stuyvesant High School, during which time he revived the defunct comic news fanzine, &quot;The Comic Reader&quot;, which according to Levitz, was the first regularly published comics industry news fanzine. Under Levitz&#x27;s editorship &quot;The Comic Reader&quot; won two Best Fanzine Comic Art Fan Awards. One of Levitz&#x27;s teachers, Frank McCourt, was impressed enough with Levitz&#x27;s work that he arranged for Levitz to appear on McCourt&#x27;s brother Malachy&#x27;s radio show.

==Career==
During the course of his research for &quot;The Comic Reader&quot;, Levitz became well known at the offices of DC Comics, where in December 1972, editor Joe Orlando gave him his first freelance work, initially writing text pages and letter pages, and later working as a per diem assistant editor before writing stories. Levitz later studied business at New York University but had taken no formal education in writing, other than a journalism course. He dropped out after three years in order to concentrate on his writing career.

After serving as Joe Orlando&#x27;s assistant editor, in 1976 Levitz &quot;fulfilled a lifelong dream&quot; by becoming the editor of &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; on the eve of his 20th birthday. In 1978, he succeeded Julius Schwartz as the editor of the Batman line of comics.

As a writer, Levitz is best known for his work on the title &quot;The Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, which he wrote from 1977–1979 and 1981–1989. Levitz wrote &quot;All-New Collectors&#x27; Edition&quot; #C-55 (1978), a treasury-sized special drawn by Mike Grell, in which longtime Legion members Saturn Girl and Lightning Lad were married. Levitz and artists James Sherman and Joe Staton crafted &quot;Earthwar&quot; a five-issue storyline in &quot;Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; #241–245 (July–Nov. 1978). He and Keith Giffen produced &quot;The Great Darkness Saga&quot;, one of the best known Legion stories, in &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 2, #290–294. Comics historian Les Daniels observed that &quot;Working with artist Keith Giffen, Levitz completed the transformation of &quot;Legion&quot; into a science-fiction saga of considerable scope and depth.&quot; In August 1984, a new &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; series was launched by Levitz and Giffen.

With artist Steve Ditko, Levitz co-created the characters Stalker and the Prince Gavyn version of Starman. He wrote the Justice Society series in &quot;All Star Comics&quot; during the late 1970s and co-created the Earth-2 Huntress with artist Joe Staton. He and Staton provided the JSA with an origin story in &quot;DC Special&quot; #29. Lucien the Librarian, a character later used in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; series, was created by Levitz and artist Nestor Redondo. Levitz was one of the contributors to the &quot;DC Challenge&quot; limited series in 1986.

Levitz eventually became an editor, and served as vice president and executive vice president, before assuming the role of president and publisher in 2002. Levitz consciously chose the combined title instead of &quot;editor-in-chief&quot;, citing the negative results of the title he&#x27;d seen during Jim Shooter&#x27;s tenure at Marvel and his desire to stay connected to the publishing arm of DC which he had help create. In 2006, Levitz returned to writing the Justice Society with issue #82 of &quot;JSA&quot;, completing that volume before writer Geoff Johns&#x27; relaunch.

On September 9, 2009, it was announced that Levitz would step down as president and publisher of DC Comics to serve as the Contributing Editor and Overall Consultant for the newly formed DC Entertainment, and become the writer of both &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; vol. 2 and &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; vol. 6.

Levitz mentioned in an August 2010 interview that he was working on &quot;my first genuine book.&quot; His &quot;75 Years of DC Comics: The Art of Modern Mythmaking&quot; () was published by Taschen America, LLC, in November 2010.

In addition to &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot;, Levitz wrote the &quot;Worlds&#x27; Finest&quot; series, which was initially drawn by George Pérez and Kevin Maguire. Levitz and Keith Giffen collaborated on the &quot;Legion of Super-Heroes&quot; issues #17 and 18 in 2013. In 2015, Levitz wrote &quot;Will Eisner: Champion of the Graphic Novel&quot;, an oversized, illustrated biography/art book on Eisner’s work for Abrams ComicArts. The book would garner Levitz a nomination in the 2016 Eisner Awards for “Best Comics-Related Book.” He joined the board of directors of Boom! Studios in February 2014. He wrote a new five-page story titled &quot;The Game&quot;, which was drawn by Neal Adams, for the &quot;Action Comics: 80 Years of Superman&quot; hardcover collection.

In 2004, Levitz joined the board of the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund, a non-profit organization founded in 1986 chartered to protect the First Amendment rights of the comics community. He retired from the board in 2020.

On December 31, 2020, Levitz announced his retirement from DC via a posting on Facebook, saying it&#x27;s “the end of an era for me personally, as I go off the payroll of Warner/DC after so many decades: over 47 years on &#x27;staff&#x27;, 36 of them on employment contracts.”

From January to May 2023, the 5-issue miniseries &quot;Avengers: War Across Time&quot;, which Levitz wrote, was published. It his first work for Marvel Comics, and received positive reviews.

==Awards==
Levitz received an Inkpot Award at San Diego Comic-Con in 2002, the Bob Clampett Humanitarian Award at San Diego Comic-Con in 2008, and the &quot;Dick Giordano Hero Initiative Humanitarian of the Year Award&quot; in September 2013 at the Baltimore Comic-Con. He was inducted into The Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2019 at San Diego Comic-Con.

==Personal life==
Levitz is Jewish. Levitz has three children: Nicole, a public health executive; Philip, a lawyer; and Garret, who works in the entertainment industry.

Levitz has named the run of &quot;All-Star Comics&quot; featuring the Justice Society of America as his favorite. He names Roger Zelazny as his favorite science fiction writer, J. R. R. Tolkien as his favorite fantasy writer, David McCullough as his favorite history writer and Agatha Christie as his favorite mystery writer.

<text>Diablo Canyon is an album by the American Southern rock band Outlaws, released in 1994. Hughie Thomasson was the only original member of the band.

&quot;Brother Travis&quot; was written with Ronnie Van Zant.

==Critical reception==

The &quot;Miami New Times&quot; praised the &quot;soaring harmonies and searing guitar solos that refuse to fall into cliche,&quot; writing that &quot;Thomasson&#x27;s vocals sound as potent and full of meaning as ever.&quot;

AllMusic wrote that the album &quot;manages to be an impressively lean and rockin&#x27; album—cut directly from the unmistakable Southern rock cloth.&quot;

<doc id="1107184" wikidata="Q5214698" url="?curid=1107184" title="Dana College">
<text>Dana College was a private college in Blair, Nebraska. Its rural 150-acre (607,000 m2) campus is approximately 26 miles (40 km) northwest of Omaha and overlooks a portion of the Missouri River Valley. It closed in 2010.

The name &quot;Dana&quot; is the poetic variant of &quot;Denmark&quot;. The college was founded in 1884 by Danish pioneers.

==Introduction==
The student body was taught by 45 professors and eight non-doctorate instructors, resulting in an average teacher-student ratio of 1:12.

The college offered on-campus housing in five residence halls and contractually maintained off-campus apartments for married or non-traditional students. Campus life fostered by an active student government and many student organizations. There were no fraternities and sororities.

==History==
The Danish Evangelical Lutheran Association in America (or Blair Church) was formed in 1884 by a group of Danish members who left the Conference of the Norwegian-Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America. Many Blair Church pastors were supportive of the Inner Mission.

The Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America (or North Church) was formed in 1894 when seminary professor P. S. Vig, along with a number of pastors and congregations, left the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in America over theological differences.

In 1896, two small groups of Danish Lutherans in America – known as the Blair Church and the North Church – came together to form the United Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church (commonly known as the United Church). This church body was a part of the Danish Lutheran &quot;Inner Mission&quot; movement, which supported a revival of religious practice based on the Bible and orthodox Lutheran teachings. Its members strongly opposed the liberalizing influence of Danish theologian N. F. S. Grundtvig, who had supported the realization of religious expression through sacramental and congregational practices.

Led by Peter Sørensen Vig and C. X. Hansen, one of the United Church&#x27;s first priorities was to establish an educational system. Elk Horn Højskole in Elk Horn, Iowa, had been founded in 1878 as the first Danish folk school in America. In 1894, Pastor Kristian Anker, then owner and principal of the Elk Horn Højskole, sold it to the newly formed Danish Lutheran Church in North America for use as a seminary and college. When the North Church merged with the Blair Church in 1896, the seminary was consolidated with Trinity Seminary in Blair, Nebraska.

When the Dana School was founded, part of its purpose was to be a pre-seminary school for those preparing for ministry in the Lutheran church. Many of Dana&#x27;s early graduates went on to study at Trinity Seminary. For many years, Dana and Trinity shared faculty, administrators, staff, and presidents. This relationship ended in 1956 when Trinity Seminary merged with Wartburg Theological Seminary in Dubuque, Iowa.

The Dana School was begun as preparatory school. By the early 1910s – in cooperation with the University of Nebraska – the Dana School was awarding associate degrees. In the 1930s Dana College became an accredited four-year school and began awarding bachelor&#x27;s degrees.

===Closure===
The institution faced significant, on-going financial challenges in the 2000s. Dana College reported that its deficit rose from $7,170,000 USD in 2005 to more than $12,550,000 USD in 2009. The Dana College Board of Regents attempted to convince major donors to make contributions to the college. Yet Dana College was unable to attract the donations to erase the deficit and fund on-going operations. This lack of financial support for the institution was because of two major problems: The global financial crisis which resulted in the Great Recession of 2008 meant that several prospective donors were unable and/or unwilling to contribute, as did a lack of a &quot;big grand vision for what Dana could become&quot;, according to one Regent who served during that period.

In 2010, the Dana College Board of Regents made a decision to structure an agreement to sell Dana College to an investment group, Dana Education Corporation. The investment group proposed to transform Dana into a for-profit institution with a focus on &quot;doubling enrollment, aggressively marketing the school and building Dana&#x27;s study abroad program&quot;. However, this proposed change of control was not accepted by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools.

The sale of Dana College to the investment group collapsed. On June 30, 2010, the Dana College Board of Regents elected to cease operations, citing a multimillion-dollar deficit.

On July 14, 2010, the Dana College Board of Regents wrote in a letter to alumni and supporters, &quot;We are firm in our belief that politics, not substance and reason, drove the ultimate decision.&quot; Attempts made by students, faculty, staff, alumni and other supporters of Dana College to influence the Higher Learning Commission to reverse its decision failed.

Students were offered the ability to transfer to the University of Nebraska at Omaha and Grand View University in Iowa through formal teach-out plans.

Midland University of Fremont, Nebraska, allowed all former Dana College students to transfer all Dana college credits, honored all Dana academic, athletic and need-based scholarships and grants, and waived enrollment deposits for Dana students. Of the roughly 600 Dana students, approximately 275 enrolled at Midland in the fall of 2010.

In 2013, Midland University, experiencing increasing enrollment and considering expansion, leased the Dana campus with the option of purchasing it; the land was purchased instead by Frank Krejci, an Omaha developer, for $3.5 million, who then donated it to Ed Shada, an Omaha banker, to lead redevelopment of the campus. In 2016, Midland announced that it would not re-open the Dana campus, but would concentrate its expansion efforts in Fremont and Omaha. According to a Midland press release, high maintenance costs and &quot;a complicated path to accreditation&quot; dissuaded them from carrying through their plans for the Blair site.

The land was to become the new home of Omaha&#x27;s Grace University in 2018, after the school sold a large part of its campus to Omaha Public Schools. However, Grace too announced its folding at the end of the 2017–18 academic year, and the move to Blair did not occur. In 2018, alumni and friends of Grace founded Charis University with the intent of occupying the Dana campus and becoming a spiritual successor to Grace.

In 2018 Angels Share, a nonprofit organization, acquired the land. In cooperation in with The Metro Area Planning Agency and the City of Blair, portions of the campus have been sold off, while others have been redeveloped. The former residence halls have been converted into housing for young adults who have aged out of the foster care system.

===Presidents===
The Presidents of Dana College were:

* Kristian Anker (1902–1905)
* C. X. Hansen (1908–1914, 1919–1925, 1936–1938)
* Erland Nelson (1931–1936)
* Lawrence Siersbeck (1938–1944)

==Campus==
The campus has of space. It is about northwest of Omaha.

Rasmussen Hall housed first and second year students. It was coed, with each wing or each floor housing a sex. Holling Hall housed first and second year students. Blair Hall housed upperclassmen, and first year students were not eligible to live there. Previously Mickelsen Hall housed both men and women on different floors. In the summer of 2007 Mickelsen was renovated so it housed upperclassmen women. In the fall of 2006 the school opened the Suite-Style Apartments for third and fourth year students.

The university maintained Omaha Village Apartments, for married and non-traditional students. Omaha Village had one and two bedroom apartments.

Dana College expected its students to live on campus for all of their years. Any students wishing to live off campus were required to gain approval.

The campus was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2021.

==Notable alumni==
* Matty Lewis (1998), co-lead singer of the La Habra, CA based punk rock band Zebrahead
* Benson Henderson (2006), current mixed martial artist, former Bellator MMA and UFC Lightweight Champion
* Richard A. Jensen, theologian, professor and author
* Paul Simon, U.S. Senator from Illinois. He attended but did not graduate.
* Megan Hunt, Member of the Nebraska Legislature from the 8th district. Hunt earned a Bachelors of Arts in Intercultural communication and German from Dana College in Blair in 2008.

==Athletics==
The Dana athletic teams were called the Vikings. The college was a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Great Plains Athletic Conference (GPAC) from 1969–70 to 2009–10.

Dana competed in 18 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports included baseball, basketball, cross country, football, golf, soccer, track &amp; field and wrestling; while women&#x27;s sports included basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball.

===Athletic director===
Former pro wrestler Bill Danenhauer was the last athletic director.

===Backlash===
In January 2009, it considered changing conference affiliations; however, outcry from alumni caused the school to rethink its position.

===Clubs and intramurals===
The college also had a number of intramural and club sports programs below the varsity level, operating independently of the athletic department.

<doc id="1107192" wikidata="Q4771911" url="?curid=1107192" title="Anthon Transcript">
<text>The &quot;Anthon Transcript&quot; (often misidentified with the &quot;Caractors document&quot;) is a piece of paper on which Joseph Smith wrote several lines of characters. According to Smith, the characters were copied from the golden plates (the ancient record from which Smith claimed to have translated the Book of Mormon) and represent the reformed Egyptian writing that was on the plates.

In 1828, the Anton Transcript was delivered to Charles Anthon, a well-known classical scholar of Columbia College, for an expert opinion on the authenticity of the characters and the translation. Some adherents to the Book of Mormon claim that Anthon attested to the characters&#x27; authenticity in writing to Martin Harris but then ripped up his certification after hearing the story of Smith and the plates. Critics of Smith claim that Anthon believed any idea of the plates containing an ancient language was a hoax all along and that Harris was being deceived.
Believers claim that the incident between Harris and Anthon fulfilled a biblical prophecy made by Isaiah, as Anthon is reported to have said to Harris, through Smith&#x27;s telling of events, &quot;I cannot read a sealed book.&quot;

In 1980, Mark Hofmann created and sold a forgery of the Anthon Transcript to leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), which was revealed to be fraudulent when three Salt Lake City bombings (which Hofmann was convicted for) were investigated.

==Harris&#x27;s account of meeting with Anthon==

In 1838, Smith related an account based on Harris&#x27;s version of the meeting. Smith wrote that Anthon &quot;stated that the translation was correct, more so than any he had before seen translated from the Egyptian. [Harris] then showed him those not yet translated, and said they were Egyptian, Chaldaic, Assyriac, and Arabic&quot;; and that they were &quot;true characters.&quot; According to Harris, Anthon wrote Harris a letter of authenticity declaring the fragment to contain true Egyptian characters. Anthon was also reported to have confirmed the translation of these characters as correct. When informed that an angel of God had revealed the characters to Smith, Anthon reportedly tore up the authentication stating that there was no such thing as angels and asked Harris to bring the plates to him for translation. Harris then went to Dr. Samuel L. Mitchill, who sanctioned what Anthon said.

==Anthon&#x27;s accounts of meeting with Harris==

In 1834, Anthon stated in a letter that, &quot;The whole story about my having pronounced the Mormonite inscription to be &#x27;reformed Egyptian hieroglyphics&#x27; is perfectly false. ... I soon came to the conclusion that it was all a trick, perhaps a hoax. ... [Harris] requested an opinion from me in writing, which of course I declined giving.&quot; Anthon described the transcript in that letter as containing &quot;(g)reek and Hebrew letters, crosses and flourishes, Roman letters inverted or placed sideways... arranged in perpendicular columns, and the whole ended in a rude delineation of a circle divided into various compartments, decked with various strange marks.&quot; Anthon stated in the letter that the story of his supposed authentication was false, that Anthon had identified the writings as a hoax, and that he had told Harris that the writings were part of &quot;a scheme to cheat the farmer [Harris] of his money&quot;.

Anthon gave a second account in 1841 that contradicted his 1834 account as to whether he gave Harris a written opinion about the document: &quot;[Harris] requested me to give him my opinion in writing about the paper which he had shown to me. I did so without hesitation, partly for the man&#x27;s sake, and partly to let the individual &#x27;behind the curtain&#x27; see that his trick was discovered. The import of what I wrote was, as far as I can now recollect, simply this, that the marks in the paper appeared to be merely an imitation of various alphabetical characters, and had, in my opinion, no meaning at all connected with them.&quot; In the 1841 account, Anthon described the characters as &quot;arranged in columns like the Chinese mode of writing .. (g)reek, Hebrew, and all sort of letters ... intermingled with sundry delineations of half moons, stars, and other natural objects, and the whole ended in a rude representation of the Mexican zodiac.&quot;

Anthon provided a third account in an August 12, 1844 letter and indicated, referring to Harris, &quot;I told the man at once that he was imposed upon and that the writing was mere trash.&quot; Anthon described the transcript as containing &quot;in one or two parallel columns rude imitations of Hebrew and Greek characters together with various delineations of sun, moon, stars, &amp;c..&quot;

Anthon in the first two accounts maintained that he told Harris that Harris was the victim of a fraud. Pomeroy Tucker, a contemporary of Harris and Smith, opined in 1867 that all the scholars whom Harris visited &quot;were understood to have scouted the whole pretense as too depraved for serious attention, while commiserating the applicant as the victim of fanaticism or insanity.&quot;

==Caractors Document==
The Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (now known as Community of Christ) purchased a handwritten slip of paper from the heirs of David Whitmer, then thought to be the &quot;Anthon Transcript&quot;; this particular candidate is now called the &quot;Caractors Document&quot;. Whitmer, who once owned the document, stated that it was this slip of paper that Harris showed to Anthon.

Both Mormon apologists and critics, however, indicate that it is not certain that the &quot;Caractors Document&quot; is the original &quot;Anthon Transcript,&quot; since Anthon had described that the characters on the slip he saw were arranged in vertical columns and ended in a &quot;rude delineation of a circle divided into various compartments, decked with various strange marks, and evidently copied after the Aztec calendar given by Humboldt,&quot; (1834) or &quot;a rude representation of the Mexican zodiac&quot; (1841). In the spring of 1828, Martin Harris&#x27; wife Lucy colluded with an accomplice, Flanders Dyke, to steal the Anthon Transcript in order to discredit the Book of Mormon, thus the Caractors Document cannot be the Anthon Transcript.

Recent scholarship, including handwriting analysis, suggests the &quot;Caractors Document&quot; was written in or after 1829, by David Whitmer&#x27;s brother John Whitmer, and therefore would not have been available to show Anthon or others in 1828. The symbols on the document were published twice in 1844, after Smith&#x27;s death, as characters that had been copied from the gold plates, one of them in the December 21 issue of &quot;The Prophet&quot;. In 1956 a request for review of the Caractors Document was made to three recognized egyptologists: Sir Alan Gardiner, William C. Hayes, and John A. Wilson. Gardiner replied that he saw no resemblance with &quot;any form of Egyptian writing.&quot; Hayes stated that it might be an inaccurate copy of something in hieratic script and that &quot;some groups look like hieratic numerals&quot;, adding that &quot;I imagine, however, that the inscription bears a superficial resemblance to other scripts, both ancient and modern, of which I have no knowledge.&quot;

Wilson gave the most detailed reply, saying that &quot;This is not Egyptian writing, as known to the Egyptologist. It obviously is not hieroglyphic, nor the &quot;cursive hieroglyphic&quot; as used in the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;. It is not Coptic, which took over Greek characters to write Egyptian. Nor does it belong to one of the cursive stages of ancient Egyptian writing: hieratic, abnormal hieratic, or demotic.&quot; Wilson added that &quot;it does not conform to the normal pattern of cursive,&quot; and that because it was purported to be altered it may &quot;remove this context from the professional analysis by the Egyptologist.&quot;

Four non-linguist Mormon translators with varying levels of education have attempted to decipher the &quot;Caractors&quot; document. The document is portrayed in the 2004 film &quot;The Work and the Glory&quot;.

The &quot;Caractors Document&quot; was sold in 2024 to the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints as part of a larger transfer of physical property between the two organizations.

<doc id="1107194" wikidata="Q1869710" url="?curid=1107194" title="Outlaws (band)">
<text>Outlaws (formerly known as The Four Letter Words) is an American Southern rock band from Tampa, Florida. They are best known for their 1975 hit &quot;There Goes Another Love Song&quot; and extended guitar jam &quot;Green Grass and High Tides&quot; from their 1975 debut album, plus their 1980 cover of the Stan Jones classic &quot;(Ghost) Riders in the Sky&quot;.

==History==

===Early years (1967–1974)===
Outlaws were formed in Tampa, Florida in 1967 by guitarists/vocalists Frank Guidry, Hughie Thomasson, Herbie Pino and Hobie O&#x27;Brien. Drummer David Dix and bassist Phil Holmberg joined the band as well. Before Guidry joined, the band was called The Four Letter Words, but changed to &quot;Outlaws&quot;, since Guidry had previously been in a band by the same name. 

By early 1968, O&#x27;Brien and Holmberg both left the band to get married and Frank O&#x27;Keefe came in on vocals and bass. Later that year, Tommy Angarano, (Tommy Tempest) joined Outlaws to replace Pino, bringing Hammond organ sounds and his style of vocals to the band. But after he left, Pino was brought back in. 

In the spring of 1968, the group&#x27;s first manager, Paul Deutekom, brought them to Epic Studios in New York City to record an album, which was never released after the band and the producer had a falling-out. 

The group headed back to Tampa then got another deal to go to Criteria Studios in Miami. There they recorded another album with producer Phil Gernhard. But this album was likewise never released and Gernhard vanished soon after. As part of the Gernhard record deal, bassist Ronny Elliott was brought in around this time, forcing Guidry out. Ronny played bass while O&#x27;Keefe briefly switched to guitar. But O&#x27;Keefe went back to bass after Elliott left in 1969 and Herbie Pino, who had mostly been a singer up till this time, began playing more guitar as well. Drummer Monte Yoho also joined that same year to sub for Dix.

In early 1970, Outlaws were joined by two members of the Dave Graham Group that was also managed by Paul Deutekom (of Ped-Dyn Productions). The Dave Graham Group&#x27;s Union leader was Monte Yoho, but he was not invited to be part of this line-up. The early 1970 Outlaws line-up was Hughie Thomasson, Frank O&#x27;Keefe, Dave Dix, Billy Jones and Dave Graham. Graham was influential in moving the group toward country-rock, especially the music of Poco. They also recorded a cover of the Doors&#x27; &quot;Five to One&quot; as an audition to a recording deal that never materialized. This lineup ended in the spring of 1970 and the group eventually parted ways with Deutekom. Yoho and Herb Pino returned, but by 1971 the offers for gigs had slowed down and the group went into limbo for a year or so, not sure if they would continue.

In 1971 Henry Paul, a singer and guitarist who was born and raised in Hurley, New York but spent his later teen years in the Tampa area, returned from a stay in Greenwich Village NYC to form Sienna, which was more of a country rock outfit. He was joined by Monte Yoho and Frank O&#x27;Keefe. In 1972, Hughie Thomasson returned from a brief spell in New York where he had been backing folksinger Milton Carroll, joined up with Paul, Yoho and O&#x27;Keefe and Sienna became the reborn Outlaws.
Billy Jones, who would sometimes show up to jam with the group on organ in 1971, returned from a stint in Boulder, Colorado in 1973 and switched to guitar, giving birth to the band&#x27;s first infamous guitar trio later dubbed &quot;The Florida Guitar Army&quot;. O&#x27;Keefe left the group temporarily in 1973–74. Thomas &quot;Buzzy&quot; Meekins and another bassist named Rick Birkbeck stood in until he was able to return. 

In 1974 Charlie Brusco signed on as manager for Outlaws. Alan Walden (brother of Capricorn Records founder Phil Walden) was told of the group by Lynyrd Skynyrd frontman Ronnie Van Zant and he joined forces with Brusco as co-manager.

The band was the first act signed to Arista Records under Clive Davis. Davis was in the audience at a show in 1974 where the band was opening for Lynyrd Skynyrd in Columbus, Georgia. On the way to the stage for Lynyrd Skynyrd&#x27;s set, lead vocalist Ronnie Van Zant said to Clive Davis, who was with Charlie Brusco, &quot;If you don&#x27;t sign Outlaws, you&#x27;re the dumbest music person I&#x27;ve ever met—and I know you&#x27;re not.&quot;

===Peak (1975–1979)===
Outlaws&#x27; earliest well known songs were &quot;There Goes Another Love Song&quot; and &quot;Green Grass and High Tides&quot;, both from their 1975 debut album &quot;Outlaws&quot;. Their 1980 cover of &quot;(Ghost) Riders in the Sky&quot; from the album &quot;Ghost Riders&quot; was their biggest single chart success, reaching No. 31 on the Billboard Hot 100.

And while the Outlaws are generally considered to be a part of the Southern rock genre, there are distinct differences in their approach and their influences. Their primary similarity to other Southern rock bands is the dual lead guitar interplay, a defining characteristic of many Southern rock bands. However, the Outlaws&#x27; mix of country and rock elements displays the vocal harmony influences of groups like Buffalo Springfield, the Byrds, Eagles, New Riders of the Purple Sage and Poco. Their use of three and four part harmonies set them apart from their contemporaries who usually relied on a single lead vocalist.

Hughie Thomasson&#x27;s signature guitar playing style and voice were also defining characteristics of the band&#x27;s sound. Thomasson&#x27;s guitar sound was underpinned by the use of the Fender Stratocaster (and sometimes a Telecaster) played in a quasi-country style mixed with fluid, quick blues runs. Hughie was nicknamed &quot;The Flame&quot; for his flaming fast guitar work. He is a member of the Fender Hall of Fame.

The other lead guitarist, Billy Jones, played mainly a Gibson Les Paul and switched between a clean and distorted sound. A good example of this can be heard on &quot;Green Grass and High Tides&quot; on the right stereo channel. Hughie Thomasson&#x27;s distinctive Stratocaster sound can be heard on the left channel. Thomasson opens the first solo at the intro and plays the first half of the two succeeding longer solos all on the right channel. There are many video examples of his Green Grass solos on the internet.

The records released by the band between 1975 and 1980 are considered the best representation of the band&#x27;s style. During this period, the Outlaws performed as a support act for non-Southern rock acts of the time, such as The Who, The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, Queen, Black Sabbath, Rush, Blue Öyster Cult, Ted Nugent, Peter Frampton, Foghat and Van Halen. This contrast of styles was more common at that time than the packaged &quot;genre&quot; tours seen so often these days. The willingness of promoters to mix styles led to the Outlaws gaining a large following in the United States.

The Outlaws&#x27; style is clearly demonstrated in their first three albums, &quot;The Outlaws&quot; (1975), &quot;Lady in Waiting&quot; (1976) and &quot;Hurry Sundown&quot; (1977). These are considered the best work of the band with all of the &quot;classic era&quot; band members. 

Unfortunately, O&#x27;Keefe broke a bone in his neck after a fall into an empty pool on July 3, 1976 and was replaced by left-handed bass player Harvey Dalton Arnold on &quot;Hurry Sundown&quot;. Henry Paul left after the &quot;Sundown&quot; album in 1977 and eventually formed the Henry Paul Band, which would release four albums from 1979 to 1982. Paul was replaced by Freddie Salem (vocals, guitar) and drummer David Dix returned after the release of &quot;Sundown&quot; in 1977 to play alongside Yoho, making for a two-drummer lineup on Bring It Back Alive (1978), &quot;Playin&#x27; to Win&quot; (1978) and &quot;In the Eye of the Storm&quot; (1979), but Yoho left by the end of 1979.

===Later years (1980–1996)===
The albums released after 1980 are largely viewed by critics as a gradual move away from the original sound that gained them success in the 1970s. The reworking of the Western-styled &quot;Ghost Riders&quot; in 1980 was the band&#x27;s last taste of big-league success. Keyboardist Mike Duke (from Wet Willie) appeared with the group from 1980-1981 and played on &quot;Ghost Riders&quot;.

Tragically, Billy Jones was let go in late 1981 due to increasing substance abuse troubles, and the depleted lineup of Thomasson, Dix, Salem and new bassist Rick Cua (who joined in 1980, just before &quot;Ghost Riders&quot;) released &quot;Los Hombres Malo&quot; in 1982. Violinist Dave Lane (later to return briefly to the group as a guitarist in 1989) guested with the band on their 1982 tour but Arista dropped them after less than stellar sales for &quot;Los Hombres Malo&quot;, releasing &quot;Greatest Hits of the Outlaws, High Tides Forever&quot; at the close of that year.

In 1983 the group was back to touring clubs, with Bob Jenkins replacing Salem on guitar, but at this point Thomasson, who owned the name, was briefly considering taking a job outside the music business. But in the middle of that same year, he and Dix decided to reunite with Henry Paul, while bringing in new players Steve Grisham (guitar, backing vocals) and Chuck Glass (vocals, bass, keyboards) and the new lineup eventually signed with Spencer Proffer and his Pasha Records label, who released &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot; in the fall of 1986.

Chris Anderson replaced Grisham on guitar in late 1986, but when &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot; also failed to sell in the big numbers, Pasha was eventually absorbed into CBS Records and the Outlaws were once again without a record label. Anderson was with the band from 1986 to 1989 and later returned in 2005, when the group reunited. And Henry Paul stayed on as well until 1989, then went on to form the country band BlackHawk, which had a lot of Country chart success in the 1990s.

During the late 80s and early to mid-90s, the band was back on the club and state fair circuit with Thomasson leading a &quot;revolving door lineup&quot;. Roy McDonald - bass, backing vocals (1987), Anthony &quot;Nino&quot; Catanzaro – bass, vocals (1987, 1989–1990, 1992–1993), Barry &quot;B. B.&quot; Borden (drums, percussion (1987–1995, formerly of Mother&#x27;s Finest and Molly Hatchet, later with Marshall Tucker Band ), Steve Kaye – bass (1988), Rich Parks – guitars, vocals (1988; 1991), Ean Evans – bass, vocals (1988–1989, 1992, later with Lynyrd Skynyrd), David Lane – guitar (1989), Billy Yates – guitars, vocals (1989–1991), Billy Greer – bass, vocals (1990, also with Kansas), Chris &quot;Hitman&quot; Hicks – guitars, vocals (1990–1996), Rob Carroll – bass, vocals (1990–1992), Timothy Cabe – guitars, vocals (1991–1993), Eric Wynne – bass (1992), Jeff Howell – bass, vocals (1993–1996, formerly with Foghat), Billy Davis – guitars, vocals (1993–1994, later with Badfinger), Sean Burke – drums, percussion (1995, formerly with Atlanta Rhythm Section), Frank Thomas - drums (1995), Kevin Neal – drums (1995–1996) and Steven Elliot – stand-in guitarist (1996) all traveled in and out of the lineup during that period.

&quot;Hittin&#x27; the Road Live&quot; was a 1993 live album that was released on Shrapnel, a mostly hard rock/heavy metal oriented label owned by Mike Varney and &quot;Diablo Canyon&quot;, released in 1994, was put out on Varney&#x27;s Blues Bureau International label. 

In 1996, Thomasson accepted a guitar position in the legendary and more popular Lynyrd Skynyrd. This essentially sidelined the Outlaws for a decade, as Thomasson&#x27;s voice and guitar style were just too integral a part of the Outlaws&#x27; sound for the other members to work without it successfully. &quot;So Low&quot;, which had been recorded but shelved when Thomasson joined Skynyrd, was released in 2000 to mixed response from fans. Many cited it as being more of a solo output from Thomasson. After this release, the band again vanished from the musical environment.

The other two members from the band&#x27;s heyday, guitarist Billy Jones and bassist Frank O&#x27;Keefe, both died in February 1995. Jones committed suicide on the 7th at age 45, and O&#x27;Keefe died on the 26th of a drug overdose at age 44.

===Reunion (2005–present)===

In April 2005, four of the six classic band members—Hughie Thomasson, Henry Paul, Monte Yoho and David Dix—reunited as The Outlaws. In addition to them, the band included former guitarist Chris Anderson and new members, bassist Randy Threet and keyboardist Dave Robbins, all three of whom had been with Paul&#x27;s country group, BlackHawk.

Paul and Robbins left to resume their careers in BlackHawk in early 2006, but the remaining band soldiered on. They were part of the Charlie Daniels Volunteer Jam tour in the summer of 2007. Outlaws put on their last show with Hughie at the Tropicana Hotel and Casino in Nevada, only a day before Hughie&#x27;s untimely death.

Band leader Hughie Thomasson died on September 9, 2007, of a heart attack in Brooksville, Florida. No release date has been announced for the studio album, &quot;Once an Outlaw&quot;, which was finished before Thomasson&#x27;s death. The Thomasson family was going to release an album in early 2010, but it was cancelled. However, the album has been illegally leaked onto the internet.

A cover version of their trademark epic 10-minute track &quot;Green Grass and High Tides&quot; is featured as the finale in the set list for guitar and bass in the video game &quot;Rock Band&quot; and features two complicated solos.

In December 2007, 2008 Outlaws tour dates were released. At the same time, it was revealed that the band would continue despite Thomasson&#x27;s death. Henry Paul became the new lead singer, frontman and bandleader. In January 2008, the Outlaws lineup would be revealed to include Henry Paul (guitars/vocals), Monte Yoho (drums) and Chris Anderson (guitars/vocals), along with newer additions Billy Crain (guitars), Jon Coleman (keyboards) and Brett Cartwright (bass, ex-Foghat), who was soon replaced by the returning Randy Threet. This would be the first lineup in Outlaws&#x27; history without Hughie Thomasson on guitar and vocals, as from the band&#x27;s formation to his death, he was the only constant member, garnering him the nicknames &quot;Mr. Outlaw&quot; and &quot;The Lone Outlaw&quot;.

According to the band&#x27;s web site, the Outlaws announced their intention to continue to tour throughout the summer and fall of 2009 with this lineup and planned to participate in the Simple Man Cruise with Lynyrd Skynyrd in January 2010.

In May 2010, the Outlaws were featured, along with the Marshall Tucker Band, Molly Hatchet, Blackberry Smoke and the Chris Hicks Band, on stage at Long Island Southern Jam 2010 in Babylon, New York at Overlook Beach. The all-day concert featured a unique jam fest for all the bands.

For the 2010 tour, Dave Robbins returned on keyboards and Henry Paul was involved in a lawsuit brought about by Hughie Thomasson&#x27;s widow, Mary, which alleged trademark violations. It was also stated on the website that the band would change its name to &#x27;Henry Paul Band&#x27; if they were to lose the case, but to continue touring with the same setlists. In April 2011 the case was ruled upon in favor of Henry Paul, Monte Yoho and the co-defendants. They continue touring and recording under the name Outlaws.

On July 30, 2012, it was announced on the band&#x27;s website that &quot;their first new album in 12 years&quot; would be released on September 25, 2012, titled &quot;It&#x27;s About Pride&quot;. It was also accompanied by a separately released DVD documentary about the making of the new album, called &quot;Hidin&#x27; Out In Tennessee&quot;. Led by Henry Paul, the album was critically acclaimed. A few years before the album, Paul had recruited an old friend from the Henry Paul Band, lead guitarist Billy Crain to join the band. Paul and Crain collaborated on writing many of the songs for &quot;It&#x27;s About Pride&quot;. The final track was a cover of the Henry Paul Band song &quot;So Long&quot; from its 1979 debut album, &quot;Grey Ghost&quot;.

In 2013, Crain left the group due to health issues and Steve Grisham, who performed on the 1986 album &quot;Soldiers of Fortune&quot;, rejoined as guitarist.

In 2016, the Outlaws released a 2-CD concert set titled &quot;Legacy Live&quot;.

In 2018, Dale Oliver (guitar), former touring guitarist with country band BlackHawk, replaced Chris Anderson. Paul and Yoho had asked Anderson to leave due to several disagreements.

Later in 2018, Monte Yoho took a break due to his health problems. At the time, drummer Jaran Sorenson joined the band. But Yoho returned in 2019 and Sorenson also continued in the band, with the Outlaws fielding two drummers again, until Yoho retired in 2021. Since this time, Henry Paul is the only &quot;classic era member&quot; in the lineup. The band continued touring with Sorenson. But Sorenson left the band in February 2022 and Michael Grando replaced him until September 2022 when Mike Bailey came in for Grando.

The band&#x27;s new album &quot;Dixie Highway&quot; was released in 2020.

Steve Grisham retired in June 2021, after which, guitarist Jeff Aulich took over. Dale Oliver fell ill in the fall of 2021 and took a break from touring. Guitarist Jimmy Dormire is currently touring with the Outlaws.

In September 2024, it was revealed Freddie Salem had died at the age of 70.

<text>Beijing This Month (BTM) is a free monthly English language magazine, published in Beijing by the Beijing Foreign Cultural Exchanges Centre in association with the Beijing City Government.

==History and profile==
The magazine&#x27;s first issue appeared in 1994. Non-audited, self-reported circulation of 70,000 copies per month, the magazine can be found at Beijing hotels, office buildings, and cultural sites, indeed anywhere with large numbers of tourists, including Beijing Capital International Airport. Advertising is primarily of hotels, shows, and restaurants in central Beijing.

BTM primarily focuses on tourism and the promotion of Beijing. Being an arm of the Beijing Government, unusual or out-of-hours access to sensitive sites in the city (such as the Temple of Heaven or the Great Wall) is often arranged, and the magazine features high-quality photography of such places.

Issues are usually dedicated to a particular theme: the 2004 Olympic Torch Relay, China&#x27;s eight major cuisines, and Beijing&#x27;s many architectural styles, are examples from June, August, and September 2004, respectively.

<text>Paula Marshall (born June 12, 1964) is an American actress.

==Career==
In 1990, Marshall had a guest role as Iris West, the love interest of Flash (Barry Allen) in the pilot episode on the short-lived &quot;Flash&quot;. In 1991, she guest-starred on &quot;Superboy&quot; with a young Clark Kent before he called himself Superman, playing the villainous Christina Riley, a woman who is, in secret, a werewolf. Both series are part of DC Comics media. In 1992, Marshall had a three-episode guest role on &quot;The Wonder Years&quot; and later guest-starred on shows such as &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Nash Bridges&quot;, &quot;Grapevine&quot; and &quot;&quot;. Later in 1992, she appeared in the movie &quot;Hellraiser III: Hell on Earth&quot; as Terri. In 1994, she got her first sitcom role on &quot;Wild Oats&quot;. In 1995, Marshall starred in the science fiction cult classic &quot;W.E.I.R.D. World&quot;, directed by William Maloneas, as Dr. Abby O&#x27;Reardon, an evil scientist who rejuvenates her boss (and later becomes his mother) and is bent on turning grown men into babies. After a few years in B movies, Marshall gained a role on 1997&#x27;s &quot;Chicago Sons&quot;. The same year, she landed a recurring role on &quot;Spin City&quot; and starred with Bette Midler and Dennis Farina in the film &quot;That Old Feeling&quot;, where her character fell in love with the paparazzo played by Danny Nucci.

Marshall has been cast in several pilots that were not picked up, including the Elizabeth Lackey series &quot;Cooking Lessons&quot; and Rob Thomas&#x27;s &quot;Sticks&quot;.

<text>The Jerusalem Center for Security and Foreign Affairs (JCFA), formerly the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs (JCPA), is an Israeli think tank specializing in public diplomacy and foreign policy founded in 1976. Describing itself on its website as &quot;The Global Embassy for Israel&quot;, it publishes the biennial journal &quot;Jewish Political Studies Review&quot; alongside other content.

The JCFA has been described as neo-conservative. 

==History==
The Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs was established in 1978 by Daniel Elazar as an umbrella organization encompassing the Center for Jewish Community Studies and the Jerusalem Institute for Federal Studies. Elazar personally raised most of the funds for the operation of the organization and the restoration of an historic building on Tel Hai Street in Jerusalem, named in honor of the Milken family. The building, Beit Milken, served as the Embassy of Uruguay from 1957 to 1980, when Uruguay decided to move their embassy to Tel Aviv. In 1989, the 1,200 ton building was moved 16 meters on rails to reach the site it currently occupies.

Dore Gold headed the Jerusalem Center from 2000 to 2015, when he took a leave of absence to become director-general of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Gold returned as president of the Jerusalem Center in October 2016. In 2023, Jason Greenblatt joined the JCPA as senior director for Arab–Israel diplomacy.

===Political orientation===
 It has been headed since 2000 by &quot;Netanyahu confidante&quot; Dore Gold. In 2015 Haaretz identified Sheldon Adelson as &quot;one of the main financers of JCFA in recent years&quot;; 

==Activities==
;Institute for Contemporary Affairs
The Jerusalem Center founded the Institute for Contemporary Affairs (ICA) jointly with the Wechsler Family Foundation. The current director of the ICA is Ambassador Alan Baker. Through this outlet, the JCPA publishes &quot;Jerusalem Issue Briefs&quot; and &quot;Jerusalem Viewpoints&quot;. They also publish the twice-yearly &quot;Strategic Perspectives&quot;, special reports presenting studies on Israeli security and diplomacy topics by the Contributing Editors board of the ICA.

;Institute for Global Jewish Affairs
In 2008, JCFA founded the Institute for Global Jewish Affairs in response to growing international anti-Semitism. It was directed by Manfred Gerstenfeld until 2021.

The institute helps direct the &quot;Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism Project&quot; and its associated monthly publication &quot;Post-Holocaust and Anti-Semitism,&quot; both of which attend to global anti-Semitism.

;Conferences
On March 24, 2014, the Jerusalem Center held a conference entitled &quot;Europe and Israel: A New Paradigm.&quot; The conference focused on the complicated relationship between Israel and Europe, including topics such as economics and the BDS movement, security and anti-Semitism. The conference was well attended and received a significant amount of press, including articles in &quot;The Times of Israel&quot;, &quot;The Jerusalem Post&quot;, J-Wire, Ynetnews, and CBN News.

;Publications
The JCFA publishes the &quot;Jewish Political Studies Review&quot;, a biannual journal that describes itself as &quot;dedicated to the study of Jewish political institutions and behavior, Jewish political thought, and Jewish public affairs&quot;.

<doc id="1107237" wikidata="Q5450502" url="?curid=1107237" title="Finlandia University">
<text>Finlandia University was a private Lutheran university in Hancock, Michigan. It was the only private university in the Upper Peninsula. Founded in 1896 as Suomi Opisto (Finnish College) and Theological Seminary, it was affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The university closed after the spring semester of 2023 due to enrollment and financial challenges.

== History ==
Finlandia University was founded as Suomi College on September 8, 1896, by J. K. Nikander (b. 1855, Hämeenlinna, Finland, d. 1919). During the 1880s, large numbers of Finns immigrated to Hancock, Michigan to labor in the copper and lumber industries. As a mission pastor of the Finnish Evangelical Lutheran Church of America headquartered in Hancock, Nikander observed that Swedish and Finnish immigrants along the Delaware River did not train new ministers, and he feared a loss of Finnish identity. The college&#x27;s role was to preserve Finnish culture, train Lutheran ministers and teach English. During the 1920s, Suomi College became a liberal arts college and in 1958, the seminary separated from the college. On July 1, 2000, Suomi College changed its name to Finlandia University.

The cornerstone of Old Main, the first building erected at Suomi College, was laid on May 30, 1898. Jacobsville sandstone, quarried at the Portage Entry of the Keweenaw waterway, was brought by barge, cut, and used to construct the Old Main. Dedicated on January 21, 1900, it contained a dormitory, kitchen, laundry, classrooms, offices, library, chapel, and lounge. A marker designating the college and its Old Main building as Michigan Historic Sites was erected by the Michigan Historical Commission in 1991.

The burgeoning college quickly outgrew this building. In 1901 a frame structure, housing a gym, meeting hall, and music center, was erected on an adjacent lot. The frame building was demolished when Nikander Hall, named for Suomi&#x27;s founder, was constructed in 1939. The hall was designed by the architectural firm of Eliel Saarinen and J. Robert F. Swanson. In addition to Old Main, the present day main campus consists of Nikander Hall, Mannerheim Hall, Wargelin Hall, Finlandia Hall, the Paavo Nurmi Center for Physical Education, the Kivi House, Hoover Center, the Finnish American Heritage Center, the Chapel of St. Matthew, and the Jutila Center.

Finlandia University was affiliated with the Lutheran church since its inception and in 1988, became affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. The curriculum, campus events, and the community explored the value of faith, vocation, and service. Finlandia University was accredited by the Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association for Colleges and Schools. In 1996, the university transitioned from a two-year college to a four-year university. Starting with the 2020–21 academic year, Finlandia&#x27;s admissions policy contained no requirements for SAT or ACT scores, only requiring a secondary school transcript.

On October 6, 2021, the 16th president, Rev. Dr. Philip R. Johnson, announced he intended to retire at the end of the 2021–22 academic year. 

On May 4, 2022, Finlandia announced Timothy Pinnow would become the next president effective July 1, 2022. On March 2, 2023, Timothy Pinnow announced that Finlandia University would close after the spring 2023 semester. Pinnow cited a lack of interest in enrollment and the debt load of the university as factors in shutting down operations. 

The university&#x27;s board of trustees voted on March 14, 2023, to officially dissolve the university. Finlandia also announced that some staff had been laid off to free up funding for operations related to student transfers. They also announced that all other staff would be laid off following commencement.

The university set up agreements for students to finish their education at Michigan Technological University, Bay de Noc Community College, Adrian College, Wartburg College, Northern Michigan University and a few other colleges. 

== Campus ==
Finlandia University&#x27;s campus was located in Hancock, Michigan, on the Keweenaw Peninsula in Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. The Keweenaw Peninsula stretches north into Lake Superior.
=== Finnish-American Heritage Center ===
Also part of Finlandia University, and serving both the campus and the community, was the Finnish American Heritage Center which hosted numerous university and community events and housed a museum, art gallery, and theater.

<doc id="1107239" wikidata="Q694481" url="?curid=1107239" title="Ballcock">
<text>A ballcock (also balltap or float valve) is a mechanism or machine for filling water tanks, such as those found in flush toilets, while avoiding overflow and (in the event of low water pressure) backflow. The modern ballcock was invented by José Antonio de Alzate y Ramírez, a Mexican priest and scientist, who described the device in 1790 in the &quot;Gaceta de Literatura Méxicana&quot;. The ballcock device was patented in 1797 for use in steam engines by Edmund Cartwright.

It consists of a valve connected to a hollow, sealed float by means of a lever mounted near the top of the tank. The float is often ball-shaped, hence the name &quot;ballcock&quot;. The valve is connected to the incoming water supply, and is opened and closed by the lever which has the float mounted on the end. When the water level rises, the float rises with it; once it rises to a pre-set level, the mechanism forces the lever to close the valve and shut off the water flow. This is an example of negative feedback and of proportional control.

==Flush toilets==
When the handle of a flush toilet with a tank (British, cistern) is turned, a discharge mechanism is activated by means of a rod or chain. The mechanism may be a flapper valve, which is designed to sink more slowly than the water - allowing the water to exit to the toilet bowl below, so that the tank may empty. As the tank water level drops, the float descends and actuates the fill valve. Water is fed to the tank to replenish its supply, and a smaller flow is directed into the overflow tube to refill the bowl. Once the flapper valve closes, the water flow from the fill valve continues until the tank level again reaches the fill line.

Toward the end of the discharge process, the ballcock responds to the drop in water level and refills the tank. Should the float or valve fail and allow the water level to exceed the fill line, the water will pour into the overflow tube and out to the bowl (in the flapper valve type) or to an outside drain (in the siphon type). Although this does not stop the wastage of water, it prevents the flooding that would otherwise occur after a single-point valve failure. Typically the fill valve is secured by a ballcock shank washer, which prevents leakage from the supply line.

The toilet ballcock, long made of brass and later made of plastic, was superseded by the float cup, pioneered in 1957 by the Fluidmaster founder Adolf Schoepe, which is integrated with the tank’s fill valve and so consumes less space. A later innovation, the floatless fill valve, designed for low-profile, low-flow toilet tanks, uses a pressure-sensing diaphragm mechanism instead of a float to control the inlet valve. Delay valves, which delay the filling until the level has dropped to a low level, avert short-cycling of the water supply.

==Siphon valve==
This “anti-siphon” discharge mechanism contrasts with the earlier siphon (British, syphon) valve. This design uses a ballcock attached to a pivoting lever that opens and closes a plunger stem fitted with a washer that seals against a water inlet port. When activated, it creates a siphon that relies on the weight of the water falling into the toilet to suck more water in from the tank and continues to empty the tank until the water in it falls below the inlet’s intake, breaking the siphon.

* Introduction to ballcock valves
* ; hysterisis issue. &quot;Such flush tank valves as now commonly used are closed against the pressure of water from a source of supply which pressure opposes the movement of the float under rising water level in the tank. This results in a slow or delayed movement of the valve preliminary to its reaching its fully closed position and accordingly develops an objectionable hissing sound due to the discharge of water through the then slightly open valve under full water pressure; this delayed action continuing until the slowed delivery of water to the tank finally raises the water level to a point where the float will be effective in fully closing the valve. This action of the conventional float controlled valves frequently gives rise to a condition where full closing of the valve does not occur with a consequent continuous leakage of water through the valve with a resulting waste of water.&quot;

<doc id="1107241" wikidata="Q7715757" url="?curid=1107241" title="The Basic School">
<text>The Basic School (TBS) is where all newly commissioned and appointed (for warrant officers) United States Marine Corps officers are taught the basics of being an &quot;Officer of Marines.&quot; The Basic School is located in Stafford County, Virginia to the south-west of the Marine Corps Base Quantico complex. Each year, over 1,700 new officers are trained, representing such commissioning sources as the U.S. Naval Academy, Navy ROTC (Marine Option), Officer Candidates School, and newly appointed Marine Corps Warrant Officers, U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (Marine Option) accession programs.

==Courses conducted at TBS==
===Basic Officer Course (BOC)===

====Introduction and background====
After earning a commission, new Marine Second Lieutenants (Unrestricted Line Officer Marine Lieutenants) complete the Officer Basic Course prior to beginning their job specialization (Military Occupational Specialty, or MOS) training to prepare them for service in the Marine Corps at large (Fleet Marine Force or other operating forces assignments). The majority of Marine Corps officers are commissioned through the USMC Officer Candidate School (OCS), but many are also graduates of the U.S. Naval Academy, or other service academies who choose to commission with the Marine Corps instead. Restricted Line/Limited Duty Officers are direct commissioned from the chief warrant officer ranks as either a first lieutenant or captain and do not attend BOC; however, as warrant officers, they have already completed the WOBC at TBS prior to beginning their officer service in the operating forces.

Most officers attend BOC as second lieutenants immediately after commissioning at OCS or within a few months of graduation and commissioning from either the USNA or an NROTC program. Some newly commissioned officers may serve a short period of time in an interim assignment (such as an assistant athletic coach at the USNA or attorney-intern at an installation) before beginning TBS/BOC. Some officers, particularly lawyers, attend BOC as first lieutenants because they were commissioned through the Platoon Leaders Class Law (PLC Law) program, which permits them to attend or continue law school after OCS as commissioned second lieutenants in the Marine Corps Reserve while they pursue their law degree. Often, those student judge advocates attain enough time in grade during law school as second lieutenants before matriculating at TBS/BOC to promote to first lieutenants. In very rare cases, an officer who receives an initial commission in another branch of the US armed forces, and who has already been promoted to first lieutenant, may receive an interservice transfer to the Marine Corps and attend TBS as a first lieutenant.

====Course overview====
The Officer Basic Course currently lasts 28 weeks, during which new officers receive classroom, field, and practical application training on weapons, tactics, leadership and protocol. The course is split into three graded categories:, Leadership, Academics, and Military Skills. Much like OCS, graded events are split between events that are graded and events that must be passed. Events that must be passed are the 15-mile hike, all three exams, the Endurance Course, Final Land Navigation, Night Land Navigation, and Rifle and Pistol Qualification. Events that simply earn a grade are the 3, 6, 9, and 12 mile hikes, leadership billets in field exercises, and various decision-making exercises.

Classroom events include topic specific lectures, exams, tactical decision games (TDGs), sand table exercises (STEXs), decision-forcing cases, and small group discussions. There are various field events, starting from fireteam and squad level, and progressing to platoon-reinforced and company-sized events. These field events involve realistic blank-fire training and live fire ranges.

====MOS selection and post BOC training and assignments====
Throughout the Program of Instruction (POI), Marines in each training company are split into thirds according to their combined scores of Leadership, Military Skills, and Academics. Each Marine ranks each specialization, or MOS, according to their preference, and each third is allocated an equal proportion of each specialization according to the Marine Corps&#x27; needs. Each third is independent of the others, so the top of the bottom third of placement is nearly as likely to get the specialization that they want as the top of the other two thirds. Throughout the POI, each Marine will have the opportunity to select which specialization they prefer in a mock-draft like setting, selecting what they prefer from what is leftover according to their grade placement in their third. Using these mock-drafts and listed preferences as reference, company staff then goes through each student and bestows upon them a specialization. This lottery system, however, does not apply to those Marines who signed air contracts to become pilots or law contracts to become Marine judge advocates.

Following the Basic Officer Course, the officer will attend one or more additional schools to be trained in their specialty, and then assigned to a unit in the Fleet Marine Force or other operating forces of the Marine Corps (e.g., Marine Barracks, Washington, DC, Marine Corps Chemical Biological Incident Response Force, Marine Corps Security Force Regiment, or the Marine Corps Embassy Security Group.

===Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC)===
Marine warrant officers attend a 16-week training regime similar in scope and instruction to the 28-week course required of second lieutenants, which is shortened due to the prior experience possessed by the newly appointed warrant officers. They are assigned to India Company at Camp Barrett.

An enlisted Marine can apply for the warrant officer program after serving at least eight years of enlisted service, and reaching the grade of E-5 (Sergeant) for the administrative warrant officer program. For the Marine Warrant Officer (Gunner) program, a Marine must have at least sixteen years of enlisted service in an infantry MOS. This requirement is waived for those holding the rank of Gunnery Sergeant for a minimum of one year prior to applying for the weapons warrant officer program. Sergeants or Staff NCOs who are selected are given additional leadership and management training during the Warrant Officer Basic Course.

===Infantry Officer Course (IOC)===
Graduates of the BOC who are selected for an infantry MOS remain at TBS for the fifteen-week Infantry Officer Course. This course was just extended from twelve weeks to better develop the infantry officers. During this program lieutenants receive intensive classroom instruction, practical experience, and field training in crew-served weapons, patrolling, and reconnaissance to ensure that they are MOS qualified for all of the infantry platoon commander billets, in addition to the rifle platoon, within a Marine infantry battalion. The other infantry billets are: rifle company weapons platoon (i.e., crew-served weapons) commander, as well as commander of one of the three heavy-weapons platoons (viz., 81mm mortar, antiarmor, and heavy machine gun) of the infantry battalion weapons company. Infantry officers may seek to compete for a tour as a reconnaissance platoon commander after serving an initial tour with an infantry unit.

Officers selected to serve in a Light Armored Reconnaissance (LAR) battalion complete an additional six-week LAR leaders course conducted at the USMC School of Infantry.

=== &quot;Mike&quot; Company ===
Marines who have recently completed Officer Candidate School (OCS) or the United States Naval Academy (USNA), as well as those who have been unable to complete the Basic Officer Course (BOC), Warrant Officer Basic Course (WOBC), or Infantry Officer Course (IOC) due to reasons such as failing graded categories or sustaining significant injuries, are assigned to M Company, also known as &quot;Mike Company.&quot; Within Mike Company, Marines undertake various support operations to assist actively training companies. Additionally, they attend educational classes and participate in physical events while awaiting reassignment to a new United States Marine Corps (USMC) Military Occupational Specialty (MOS) in the case of IOC graduates, or to continue training if WOBC or BOC completion is pending. Mike Company also accommodates Marines who have graduated from BOC but are awaiting their MOS school assignments.

<doc id="1107246" wikidata="Q4850250" url="?curid=1107246" title="Balché">
<text>Balché is a mildly intoxicating beverage that was commonly consumed by the ancient Maya in what is now Mexico and upper Central America. Today, it is still common among the Maya. The drink is made from the bark of a leguminous tree, &quot;Lonchocarpus violaceus&quot;, which is soaked in honey and water, and fermented. A closely related beverage, made from honey produced from the nectar of a species of morning glory &quot;(Turbina corymbosa)&quot;, is called &quot;xtabentún&quot;.

Ritual enemas and other psychoactive substances were also taken by those who drank balché.

According to food writer Sandor Katz, the ancient Maya consumed &quot;balché&quot; in enema form to maximize its inebriating effect. After the Maya were conquered by the Spanish, the drink was banned and their orchards were destroyed.

<doc id="1107252" wikidata="Q16954742" url="?curid=1107252" title="The Last Beautiful Day">
<text>The Last Beautiful Day is the debut album by New Buffalo. 

After their debut EP, About Last Night, New Buffalo received interest from the record label Heavenly Recordings, who funded sessions with producer Jake Davies in Los Angeles. However, these sessions were not completed, and New Buffalo&#x27;s Sally Seltmann returned home to Melbourne. Instead, &quot;The Last Beautiful Day&quot; was recorded by Seltmann at the Lonely Studio, at her home in Yarraville with husband Darren Seltmann.

The album was released on the Dot Dash record label on 14 September 2004, and was distributed in Australia through Inertia. It was subsequently released by P-Vine Records in Japan on 6 June 2005 by Arts &amp; Crafts Productions in Canada on 23 August 2005. The album was written, performed, recorded, and produced by Sally Seltmann of New Buffalo, with the exception of backing vocals from Beth Orton on the track &quot;Inside&quot;, and drums from Jim White on the tracks &quot;No Party&quot;, &quot;Inside&quot; and &quot;While You&#x27;re Away&quot;.

== Reception ==
Reviews of &quot;The Last Beautiful Day&quot; were largely positive, focusing on Seltmann&#x27;s strengths with melody, and the album&#x27;s mix of indie folk and electronic sounds and sampling. Rob Mitchum of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; described the album as having &quot;dreamy-indie qualities&quot; and that Seltmann was a &quot;forward-thinking indie-folkster, not one to shy away from technology.&quot; Stewart Mason of &quot;Allmusic&quot; pointed out that Seltmann has a &quot;clear voice that&#x27;s a more substantial and varied instrument than many of her more wispy contemporaries; Seltmann is also a clever melodicist with a knack for plainspoken but evocative lyrics.&quot; A staff writer in &quot;The Age&quot; called the album &quot;an unqualified joy&quot; that used &quot;bubbling vintage keyboards, ringing guitar and understated orchestral samples to provide a rich, uncluttered foundation for wistful songs of love and intimacy&quot;. A staff writer at the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot; described the album as having a &quot;sometimes surprising gentleness&quot; and that Seltmann &quot;brings an affecting warmth to her songs and creates her own little out-of-its-time world&quot;, but that the album &quot;is easy to drift into and be lulled&quot;, which &quot;can sometimes work against her, particularly towards the end of the album&quot;.

The introductory carrier melody of &quot;K2G(Kimi Ni Go!)&quot; was derived from the introductory interlude of the song &quot;How Was It for You?&quot; by James, from this English Postpunk/Britpop band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Gold Mother&quot; (1990).

The cover art for the American version of the album is a homage to John Lennon and Yoko Ono&#x27;s &quot;bed-In&quot; peace protests held in 1969.
The songs &quot;Planet Tokyo&quot; and &quot;K2G (Kimi Ni Go!)&quot; are featured in the &quot;Hi Hi Puffy AmiYumi World Tour Game&quot; and &quot;Teen Titans&quot;.

<doc id="1107277" wikidata="Q7711666" url="?curid=1107277" title="The &quot;E&quot; Ticket">
<text>The &quot;E&quot; Ticket was a fanzine devoted to the history of Disneyland and its attractions, especially the park as it existed during the lifetime of Walt Disney, publishing forty six issues between 1986 and 2009. It was edited and published by Disneyland fans Leon Janzen and Jack Janzen until Leon&#x27;s sudden death on September 9, 2003. The last issue published by the brothers was the Fall 2003 Issue, #40, on Adventure Thru Inner Space. Jack continued the magazine without his brother, beginning with #41 in October 2004. In the final issue, #46 (Summer 2009), Jack noted that making the magazine &quot;Hasn&#x27;t been much fun without Leon&quot;, and he decided to end the magazine&#x27;s run.

Disney and animation historian Michael Barrier has cited it as &quot;An extremely valuable record, one that can no longer be duplicated, given the deaths of most of the interview subjects.&quot;

The magazine (including all remaining back stock) was sold in 2009 to the Walt Disney Family Foundation to augment the historic resources of The Walt Disney Family Museum it established that year. Back issues of &quot;E&quot; Ticket are sold at the museum&#x27;s bookstore.

The magazine was named after the E tickets that, before the move to flat-rate entry tickets, denoted the top rides in the park.

<text>Muhlenberg College is a private liberal arts college in Allentown, Pennsylvania. Founded in 1848, Muhlenberg College is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America and is named for Henry Muhlenberg, the German patriarch of Lutheranism in the United States.

==History==
===19th century===

Muhlenberg College was founded in 1848 in Allentown, Pennsylvania, as the Allentown Seminary by Samuel K. Brobst, a Reformed Lutheran minister. Christian Rudolph Kessler was the school&#x27;s first teacher and administrator. 

The college operated as the Allentown Seminary from 1848 to 1864, as the Allentown Collegiate and Military Institute from 1864 to 1867, and briefly as the Allentown Collegiate Institute in 1867. 

In 1867, the college moved into Trout Hall, the former mansion of William Allen&#x27;s son, James Allen, and was renamed Muhlenberg College in honor of Henry Muhlenberg, the patriarch of the Lutheran church in the United States. 

From 1867 to 1876, Muhlenberg&#x27;s great-grandson, Frederick Augustus Muhlenberg, served as president of the college.

===20th century===
In 1905, the college purchased and relocated to a tract located in Allentown&#x27;s West End, which continues to serve as the present-day campus.

In 1910, seeing a need for evening study in the community, the college began offering courses through a &quot;Saturday School for Teachers&quot;. The offerings for adult education outside of the traditional baccalaureate track evolved over the years through various titles, including an &quot;Extension&quot; school.

===21st century===
In 2002, Muhlenberg College opened The W. Clarke Wescoe School of Professional Studies. With the addition of graduate degree programs, the Muhlenberg graduate program was renamed as the School for Graduate and Continuing Studies.

In 2019, the college named Kathleen E. Harring, a social psychologist and the college&#x27;s prior provost since 2017, as its 13th president and its first female president. She succeeded John I. Williams, Jr., the college&#x27;s first black president, who served as president from 2015 to 2019.

Muhlenberg was one of the first institutions to fire a tenured professor over pro-Palestinian speech. During the 2024 pro-Palestinian campus protests, the college fired its Jewish anthropology professor, Maura Finkelstein, for sharing a social media post by Palestinian poet Remi Kanazi who wrote, &quot;Do not cower to Zionists. Shame them. .. Don’t normalize Zionism. Don’t normalize Zionists taking up space.&quot; The college determined that Finkelstein had violated its equal opportunity and nondiscrimination policies by sharing his words. A Title IX complaint letter concerning “a Jewish anti-Zionist professor on campus who has written articles praising Hamas .. The letter seeks the professor’s removal.”

==Campus==
Muhlenberg&#x27;s current campus is located in a residential neighborhood in Allentown&#x27;s West End. The campus includes buildings with distinctive traditional European and Protestant red doors laid out on several college quads. The central part of the park-like campus is the college green, which incorporates public art, including &quot;Victor&#x27;s Lament&quot; by sculptor Mark di Suvero, which incorporates a red I-beam and is a tribute to the history of steelmaking in Allentown and the surrounding Lehigh Valley during the 20th century.

The college&#x27;s academic row runs the length of the main college quadrangle with Haas College Center, built between 1926 and 1929, in the center. Miller Tower, the dome and tower on top of Haas College Center, was inspired by Tom Tower at Christ Church College at the University of Oxford. It is named for David A. Miller (class of 1894), the first reporter for &quot;The Morning Call&quot;, an Allentown-based daily newspaper founded in 1883. Muhlenberg&#x27;s Polling Institute teams with the newspaper to periodically publish surveys of preferences and trends among Pennsylvanians, especially in the Lehigh Valley.

In 1988, the college opened the Harry C. Trexler Library, named for local industrialist Harry Clay Trexler; it was designed by architect Robert Geddes. The library houses over 310,000 volumes and 360,000 microforms on campus, and has access to over 1.75 million books via interlibrary loan. The library is part of the Federal Depository Library Program. Near Trexler Library is the Philip Johnson-designed Baker Center for the Arts. It houses Martin Art Gallery, which has a permanent collection of over 3,000 works of art and also hosts exhibitions of pieces by student, regional, and international artists.

In August 2004, the Life Sports Center was expanded by , adding a new indoor field house, gymnasium, cafe, health classrooms, and a pool. In 2007, a new science building and additional residence halls were completed and opened. 

In addition to its main campus in Allentown, Muhlenberg maintains a Graver Arboretum, located away in Bushkill Township, and Raker Wildlife Preserve, a wildlife sanctuary located away in Germansville.

==Academics==
Muhlenberg College offers bachelor&#x27;s degrees with academic focuses on liberal arts education and pre-professional studies. Approximately 85% of the faculty have a PhD or other terminal degree in their respective fields. The student to faculty ratio, as of 2018, was 11:1. The college maintains chapters of over 15 national Greek academic honor societies. Bachelor&#x27;s degree programs for returning adult students are offered through the School of Continuing Education. Graduate degrees have also been offered since the 2020–21 academic year.

The college offers accelerated programs, cross-registration between disciplines, double majors, honors programs, independent study, internships, Army ROTC, student-designed majors, over 160 study-abroad programs, teacher certification, visiting and exchange student programs, and a Washington, D.C. semester.

===Admissions===

In the 2016–2017 academic year, about one-third (32%) of applicants were offered admission. In the 2013–2014 academic year, about 44% of students accepted for admission into the freshman class were in the top 10% of their high school or preparatory school graduating class, 69% in the top 20% of their graduating class, and 81% were in the top 30%. Three-quarters of the freshman class receive some form of financial aid. Muhlenberg is primarily a regional college, with 72% of incoming freshmen coming from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, or New York state. However, the school also receives applications from the West Coast, including students from Arizona, California, and Oregon.

===Rankings===
In its 2025 rankings, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Muhlenberg College 71st among the nation&#x27;s liberal arts colleges. &quot;Forbes&quot; ranked Muhlenberg 86th on their list of liberal arts colleges in the United States. 

==Athletics==

Muhlenberg College athletic teams are the Muhlenberg Mules and compete in NCAA Division III. The college has 22 intercollegiate sports, which belong to either the Centennial Conference or Eastern College Athletic Conference.

Both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s teams exist for basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, track and field, and wrestling. Men&#x27;s teams exist for baseball and football; women have teams for softball, field hockey, and volleyball.

In 2004, additional athletic facilities were built west of the field house. Updated tennis courts were built in 2003 and two fields were added in 1997 and 1998. The baseball and softball teams do not have on-campus facilities. The football, field hockey, and track and field teams each perform at Scotty Wood Stadium, at 3400 West Chew Street, on the Muhlenberg College campus.

===Football===
====20th century====

In 1900, the Muhlenberg Mules football program was founded as Muhlenberg College&#x27;s first official varsity sport. Doggie Julian was its head coach at from 1936 to 1944; his career record was 56–49–2. Julian was also Muhlenberg&#x27;s head basketball coach during this time and the head baseball coach from 1942 to 1944.

In 1946, Ben Schwartzwalder was named head football coach. In his first season, he guided the Mules to a 9–1 record and a national championship with Muhlenberg defeating St. Bonaventure University in the Tobacco Bowl. The following year, in the 1947 season, Schwartzwalder again led the Mules to a 9–1 record; the season&#x27;s only loss came by one point, in a 7–6 loss at Temple. The Mules declined an invitation that season to appear in the Tangerine Bowl. In 1949, Schwartzwalder departed to coach Syracuse.

After Schwartzwalder departed for Syracuse in 1949, the Mules fell off the national radar until the hiring of Mike Donnelly in 1997. Despite a rough 1–9 inaugural campaign, Donnelly turned the team around. From 2000 to 2004, the Mules won five straight Centennial Conference championships and earned five straight postseason berths. In 2007, the Mules again won the Centennial Conference and received another berth in the NCAA playoffs, winning their first-round game before falling in the second round. Donnelly&#x27;s team won the Centennial Conference again in 2008 and earned a playoff berth, but fell in the first round. In 2010, they returned to the playoffs with the same result.

In the 20th century, at least three Muhlenberg players went on to play in the National Football League: Sisto Averno (with the Baltimore Colts, Dallas Texans, and New York Yanks between 1950 and 1954), Charlie Copley (with the Akron Pros and Milwaukee Badgers between 1920 and 1922), and Tony Zuzzio (with the Detroit Lions in 1942).

====21st century====
Since the 2000 season, Muhlenberg has compiled a 66–28 overall record in the Centennial Conference, second-best among all active and former members behind only Johns Hopkins University. The Muhlenberg football team has won the Centennial Conference championship seven times in the 2000s.

Nate Milne was named Muhlenberg&#x27;s head football coach in 2018. He has since compiled a 35–5 record over his first three seasons. In 2019, Milne was named AFCA Coach of the Year Award for NCAA Division III.

===Club teams===
In addition to its 22 NCAA teams, Muhlenberg College has sports club teams in ultimate frisbee and women&#x27;s rugby.

==Student life==

More than 100 clubs and organizations are on campus. In addition, the Muhlenberg Activity Council is responsible for bringing events and activities to campus. The college arranges off-campus community service opportunities and intramural and club sports for students.

The college&#x27;s official student-run print publication is &quot;The Muhlenberg Weekly&quot;. Established in 1883, the paper is published every week while school is in session. The student-run radio station, WMUH, which broadcasts at 91.7FM, is operated year-round by both students and volunteers from the surrounding Lehigh Valley community. It is also available online by live stream.

There are four sororities and four fraternities affiliated with the college.

Despite its Lutheran affiliation, Muhlenberg has attracted a large number of Jewish students, estimated in 2024 to be around 30% of the student body. Muhlenberg is one of only a few American liberal arts colleges to offer a Jewish studies major and minor; the Muhlenberg College Hillel is the largest student organization on campus.

==In popular culture==
*In 1998, the HBO documentary &quot;Frat House&quot;, which addresses fraternity hazing, was largely filmed at the Alpha Tau Omega fraternity at Muhlenberg. Responding to criticisms from Alpha Tau Omega, HBO never aired the documentary, though it was later released online. &quot;Frat House&quot; was awarded &quot;Grand Jury Prize: Documentary&quot; at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival.
*On March 19, 1988, Frank Zappa recorded the song &quot;Zomby Woof&quot; at Muhlenberg College&#x27;s Memorial Hall. The song appears as the seventh track of the first disc on the double-disc album &quot;The Best Band You Never Heard in Your Life&quot;, released in 1991.

<text>The figaro chain is a jewellery chain design consisting of three or more small circular links followed by one elongated oval link. The most notable figaro chains are manufactured in Italy. They are usually worn by men and are often adorned with pendants such as crosses and medallions.

The name of the design may have been inspired by the operas &quot;The Barber of Seville&quot; (by Gioachino Rossini) and &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; (by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart).

The origins of the Figaro chain date back to one of Italy&#x27;s most notable family of jewellers and goldsmiths, The Riccardi Family.

<doc id="1107288" wikidata="Q3480330" url="?curid=1107288" title="Song of Solomon (novel)">
<text>Song of Solomon is a 1977 novel by American author Toni Morrison, her third to be published. It follows the life of Macon &quot;Milkman&quot; Dead III, an :African-American man living in Michigan, from birth to adulthood.

This novel won the National Book Critics Circle Award, was chosen for Oprah Winfrey&#x27;s popular book club, and was cited by the Swedish Academy in awarding Morrison the 1993 Nobel Prize in Literature. In 1998, the Radcliffe Publishing Course named it the 25th best English-language novel of the 20th century.

==Plot==
Robert Smith, an African-American insurance agent, jumps off a roof while trying to fly as a crowd of people gather to watch. The appearance of Smith on the roof causes a woman named Ruth Dead to go into labor. In the chaos that follows, the hospital admits her and she delivers her son, Macon Dead III—the first African-American child born in the hospital. Macon Dead III grows up stifled, alienated, and disinterested in his home life in Southside. Ruth is still breastfeeding him when he is four years old. One of her husband&#x27;s employees witnesses this and nicknames the boy &quot;Milkman&quot;. 

Milkman&#x27;s relationship with his family is strained, particularly towards his father. As Milkman enters his teens, his aunt Pilate, a bootlegger and conjure woman, becomes a central figure in his life. For Milkman, Pilate becomes the first glimpse into his family&#x27;s past. When they were younger, Pilate and Macon Jr. found a cave filled with bags of gold, but did not take it for fear of reprisals. Milkman forms a sexual connection with his cousin Hagar, but later spurns her. Hagar becomes obsessed with him, attempting to kill him once a month, but never following through.

Milkman mentions to his father, Macon, the heavy bag that hangs from the ceiling of Pilate&#x27;s modest home. Pilate mentions that the bag contains her &quot;inheritance.&quot; Thinking it must be one of the bags of gold from the cave, Macon sends Milkman and his friend Guitar to steal the bag from Pilate. Milkman and Guitar succeed, but are arrested by the police after they discover the bag contains human bones. Macon and Pilate go to the police station to free the two young men.

Milkman makes a journey south to Pennsylvania in search of the gold. After talking to several people, Milkman deduces that Pilate must have retrieved the gold and taken it to Virginia. Milkman stumbles across Shalimar, Virginia, by accident. While out hunting with older men from Shalimar, Milkman is attacked by Guitar, who has followed him to Virginia. Guitar is under the impression that Milkman has taken the gold, and thus wants revenge. Struggling, Milkman discharges his gun, scaring away Guitar.

Milkman sees the children of the town playing and singing the &quot;Song of Solomon.&quot; Milkman remembers that Pilate sang a similar song, and realizes that the song is about his family. He heads back to Michigan to find Pilate.

While Milkman is gone in Virginia, Hagar has sunk into a terrible depression from him having spurned her. Thinking that Milkman would want her if she fixes herself up, Hagar buys dresses, makeup, and a haircut. The effort amounts to little, and Hagar succumbs to her grief. A collection is taken up by the community to bury Hagar, and Pilate sings a mournful song at her granddaughter&#x27;s funeral.

Milkman thinks it only appropriate that Macon Dead Sr. be laid to rest in his ancestral home in Shalimar. Milkman finds Pilate at her home, and she knocks him unconscious for the grief that caused her granddaughter to die. When he comes to, Milkman convinces her to travel with him to Virginia and bury her father. They make the journey and bury Macon Dead Sr. overlooking the ravine. After placing the bones in the grave, Pilate is killed by a gunshot from Guitar that was intended for Milkman. The novel ends with Milkman leaping toward Guitar, thus learning to &quot;fly&quot;.

== Reception and legacy ==
&quot;Song of Solomon&quot;, Morrison&#x27;s third novel, was met with widespread acclaim, and Morrison earned the National Book Critics Circle Award for Fiction in 1978. Reynolds Price, reviewing the novel for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, concluded: &quot;Toni Morrison has earned attention and praise. Few Americans know, and can say, more than she has in this wise and spacious novel.&quot;

The novel has faced several challenges and bans in schools throughout the U.S. since 1993.

The main character inspired the name of the band The Dead Milkmen, formed in 1983.

In 2015, Robert McCrum&#x27;s chronological list of the 100 best novels written in English, which was published in &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper, named &quot;Song of Solomon&quot; at No. 89.

<doc id="1107299" wikidata="Q386456" url="?curid=1107299" title="Token bucket">
<text>The token bucket is an algorithm used in packet-switched and telecommunications networks. It can be used to check that data transmissions, in the form of packets, conform to defined limits on bandwidth and burstiness (a measure of the unevenness or variations in the traffic flow). It can also be used as a scheduling algorithm to determine the timing of transmissions that will comply with the limits set for the bandwidth and burstiness: see network scheduler.

== Overview ==
The token bucket algorithm is based on an analogy of a fixed capacity bucket into which tokens, normally representing a unit of bytes or a single packet of predetermined size, are added at a fixed rate. When a packet is to be checked for conformance to the defined limits, the bucket is inspected to see if it contains sufficient tokens at that time. If so, the appropriate number of tokens, e.g. equivalent to the length of the packet in bytes, are removed (&quot;cashed in&quot;), and the packet is passed, e.g., for transmission. The packet does not conform if there are insufficient tokens in the bucket, and the contents of the bucket are not changed. Non-conformant packets can be treated in various ways:

* They may be dropped.
* They may be enqueued for subsequent transmission when sufficient tokens have accumulated in the bucket.
* They may be transmitted, but marked as being non-conformant, possibly to be dropped subsequently if the network is overloaded.

A conforming flow can thus contain traffic with an average rate up to the rate at which tokens are added to the bucket, and have a burstiness determined by the depth of the bucket. This burstiness may be expressed in terms of either a jitter tolerance, i.e. how much sooner a packet might conform (e.g. arrive or be transmitted) than would be expected from the limit on the average rate, or a burst tolerance or maximum burst size, i.e. how much more than the average level of traffic might conform in some finite period.

== Algorithm ==
The token bucket algorithm can be conceptually understood as follows:
*A token is added to the bucket every formula_1 seconds.
*The bucket can hold at the most formula_2 tokens. If a token arrives when the bucket is full, it is discarded.
*When a packet (network layer PDU) of &quot;n&quot; bytes arrives,
**if at least &quot;n&quot; tokens are in the bucket, &quot;n&quot; tokens are removed from the bucket, and the packet is sent to the network.
**if fewer than &quot;n&quot; tokens are available, no tokens are removed from the bucket, and the packet is considered to be &quot;non-conformant&quot;.

=== Variations ===
Implementers of this algorithm on platforms lacking the clock resolution necessary to add a single token to the bucket every formula_1 seconds may want to consider an alternative formulation. Given the ability to update the token bucket every S milliseconds, the number of tokens to add every S milliseconds = formula_4.

=== Properties ===

==== Average rate ====
Over the long run the output of conformant packets is limited by the token rate, formula_5.

==== Burst size ====
Let formula_6 be the maximum possible transmission rate in bytes/second.

Then formula_7 is the maximum burst time, that is the time for which the rate formula_6 is fully utilized.

The maximum burst size is thus formula_9

=== Uses ===
The token bucket can be used in either traffic shaping or traffic policing. In traffic policing, nonconforming packets may be discarded (dropped) or may be reduced in priority (for downstream traffic management functions to drop if there is congestion). In traffic shaping, packets are delayed until they conform. Traffic policing and traffic shaping are commonly used to protect the network against excess or excessively bursty traffic, see bandwidth management and congestion avoidance. Traffic shaping is commonly used in the network interfaces in hosts to prevent transmissions being discarded by traffic management functions in the network.

The token bucket algorithm is also used in controlling database IO flow. In it, limitation applies to neither IOPS nor the bandwidth but rather to a linear combination of both. By defining tokens to be the normalized sum of IO request weight and its length, the algorithm makes sure that the time derivative of the aforementioned function stays below the needed threshold.

== Comparison to leaky bucket ==
The token bucket algorithm is directly comparable to one of the two versions of the leaky bucket algorithm described in the literature. This comparable version of the leaky bucket is described on the relevant Wikipedia page as the leaky bucket algorithm as a meter. This is a mirror image of the token bucket, in that conforming packets add fluid, equivalent to the tokens removed by a conforming packet in the token bucket algorithm, to a finite capacity bucket, from which this fluid then drains away at a constant rate, equivalent to the process in which tokens are added at a fixed rate.

There is, however, another version of the leaky bucket algorithm, described on the relevant Wikipedia page as the leaky bucket algorithm as a queue. This is a special case of the leaky bucket as a meter, which can be described by the conforming packets passing through the bucket. The leaky bucket as a queue is therefore applicable only to traffic shaping, and does not, in general, allow the output packet stream to be bursty, i.e. it is jitter free. It is therefore significantly different from the token bucket algorithm.

These two versions of the leaky bucket algorithm have both been described in the literature under the same name. This has led to considerable confusion over the properties of that algorithm and its comparison with the token bucket algorithm. However, fundamentally, the two algorithms are the same, and will, if implemented correctly and given the same parameters, see exactly the same packets as conforming and nonconforming.

==Hierarchical token bucket==

The hierarchical token bucket (HTB) is a faster replacement for the class-based queueing (CBQ) queuing discipline in Linux. It is useful for limiting each client&#x27;s download/upload rate so that the limited client cannot saturate the total bandwidth.

Conceptually, HTB is an arbitrary number of token buckets arranged in a hierarchy. The primary egress queuing discipline (&quot;qdisc&quot;) on any device is known as the root qdisc. The root qdisc will contain one class. This single HTB class will be set with two parameters, a &quot;rate&quot; and a &quot;ceil&quot;. These values should be the same for the top-level class, and will represent the total available bandwidth on the link.

In HTB, &quot;rate&quot; means the guaranteed bandwidth available for a given class and &quot;ceil&quot; (short for ceiling) indicates the maximum bandwidth that class is allowed to consume. When a class requests a bandwidth more than guaranteed, it may borrow bandwidth from its parent as long as both ceils are not reached. Hierarchical Token Bucket implements a classful queuing mechanism for the Linux traffic control system, and provides rate and ceil to allow the user to control the absolute bandwidth to particular classes of traffic as well as indicate the ratio of distribution of bandwidth when extra bandwidth become available (up to ceil).

When choosing the bandwidth for a top-level class, traffic shaping only helps at the bottleneck between the LAN and the Internet. Typically, this is the case in home and office network environments, where an entire LAN is serviced by a DSL or T1 connection.
