<text>The Servite Order, officially known as the Order of Servants of Mary (; abbreviation: OSM), is one of the five original mendicant orders in the Roman Catholic Church. It includes several branches of friars (priests and brothers), contemplative nuns, a congregation of religious sisters, and lay groups. The order&#x27;s objectives are the sanctification of its members, the preaching of the Gospel, and the propagation of devotion to the Mother of God, with special reference to her sorrows. The Servites friars lead a community life in the tradition of the mendicant orders.

==History==

===Foundation===
The order was founded in 1233 by &quot;the seven holy founders&quot;, each a member of a patrician family of Florence, Italy. These cloth merchants left their city, families, and professions and withdrew to Monte Senario, a mountain outside the city of Florence, for a life of poverty and penance. The seven were: Bonfilius of Florence, born Bonfilius Monaldi (Buonfiglio dei Monaldi); Alexis of Florence, born Alexis Falconieri () (1200 – 17 February 1310); Manettus of Florence, born Benedict dell&#x27;Antella (Benedetto dell&#x27; Antella); Amideus of Florence, born Bartholemew Amidei (died 1266) (also known as Bartolomeo degli Amidei); Hugh of Florence, born Ricovero Uguccioni (Hugh dei Lippi Uggucioni (Ricovero dei Lippi-Ugguccioni)); Sostene of Florence, born Gerardino Sostegni (Gherardino di Sostegno); and Buonagiunta of Florence, born John Manetti (Giovanni di Buonagiunta (Bonajuncta)). They were canonized by Pope Leo XIII on 15 January 1888.
The members of the order dedicated themselves to Mary under her title of Mother of Sorrows (). Dedicating their devotion to the mother of Jesus, they adopted Mary&#x27;s virtues of hospitality and compassion as the order&#x27;s hallmarks. The distinctive spirit of the order is the sanctification of its members by meditation on the Passion of Jesus and the Sorrows of the Virgin Mary, and spreading abroad this devotion.

The Bishop of Florence, Ardengo Trotti (Ardengo Dei Foraboschi), approved the group as a religious order sometime between 1240 and 1247. The Servites, like other new orders before them such as the Trinitarians and the Dominicans, decided to live by the ancient Rule of St. Augustine, and added to the rule further guidelines that were the expression of their own Marian devotion and dedication. By 1250 a number of Servites had been ordained to the priesthood, thus creating an order with priests as well as brothers.

Pope Alexander IV favored a plan for the amalgamation of all orders which followed the Rule of St. Augustine. This was accomplished in March 1256, but about the same time a rescript was issued confirming the Servite Order as a separate body with power to elect a general. Four years later a general chapter was convened at which the order was divided into two provinces, Tuscany and Umbria, the former being governed by Manettus and the latter by Sostene. Within five years two new provinces were added, that of Romagna and that of Lombardy.

===Centuries of growth===

Philip Benizi was elected general on 5 June 1267, and afterwards became the great propagator of the order. The Second Council of Lyons in 1274 put into execution the ordinance of the 1215 Fourth Lateran Council, forbidding the foundation of new religious orders, and suppressed all mendicant institutions not yet approved by the Holy See. In the year 1276 Pope Innocent V in a letter to Benizi declared the order suppressed. Benizi set off for Rome to appeal the decision, but before his arrival there Innocent V had died. His successor lived only five weeks. Finally Pope John XXI, decided that the Servite Order should continue as before. It was not definitively approved until Pope Benedict XI issued the bull &quot;Dum levamus&quot; on 11 February 1304. Of the seven founders, Alexis alone lived to see their foundation raised to the permanent dignity of an order. He died in 1310.

On 30 January 1398 Pope Boniface IX granted the Servites the power to confer theological degrees. It was in harmony with the tradition thus established that many centuries later the order established the Marianum faculty in Rome.
The new foundation enjoyed considerable growth in the following decades. Already in the thirteenth century there were houses of the order in Germany, France, and Spain. By the early years of the fourteenth century the order had more than one hundred houses in locations including Hungary, Bohemia, Austria, Poland, and what later became Belgium. In subsequent periods came missions in Crete, the Philippines (St. Peregrine-Philippine Vicariate), and India.

===European contraction===

The disturbances which arose during the Protestant Reformation caused the loss of many Servite houses in Germany, but in the south of France the order met with much success. The Convent of San Marcello al Corso was founded in the city of Rome in 1369 and a second house, Santa Maria in Via, was established there in 1513. Beginning in the early part of the eighteenth century the order sustained a series of losses and confiscations from which it has yet to recover. A first blow fell upon the flourishing Province of Narbonne, which was almost totally destroyed by the plague which swept Marseilles in 1720. Thanks to secularizing inroads made by the Enlightenment, in 1783 the Servites were expelled from Prague and in 1785 the Emperor Joseph II desecrated the shrine of Maria Waldrast. The French Revolution and ensuing hostilities throughout western Europe caused widespread losses. Ten houses were suppressed in Spain in 1835. 

After the seizure of Rome under the Italian Risorgimento in 1870, the government of Italy closed the Servite house of studies in the city, along with many other papal institutions. The institute was re-founded as the College of Sant Alessio Falcioneri in 1895.

===New expansion===

After a gap of 25 years, in 1895 the house of studies in Rome was re-founded as the College of Sant Alessio Falcioneri. This development went hand in hand at this period with other initiatives and a new foundation was made at Brussels in 1891 and the order was introduced into England and United States, chiefly through the efforts of the Servite priests Bosio and Morini. The latter, having gone to London in 1864 as director of the affiliated Congregation of the Sisters of Compassion, obtained charge of a parish from Archbishop Manning in 1867. The work prospered and besides St. Mary&#x27;s Priory in London, convents were opened at Bognor Regis (1882) and Begbroke (1886). In 1870 Morini, Ventura, Giribaldi, and Joseph Camera, at the request of Bishop Joseph Melcher of Green Bay, Wisconsin, took up a mission in America, at Neenah. Morini founded at Chicago (1874) the monastery of Our Lady of Sorrows. A novitiate was opened at Granville, Wisconsin in 1892 and an American province was formally established in 1908.

===Twentieth century===
The order continued to expand geographically throughout the twentieth century, taking responsibility for missions in Swaziland in 1913, Acre in Brazil in 1919, Aisén in Chile in 1937, and Zululand in South Africa. It also made foundations in Argentina from 1914 and more solidly since 1921; Transvaal in South Africa from 1935, Uruguay in 1939, Bolivia in 1946, Mexico in 1948, Australia in 1951, Venezuela in 1952, Colombia in 1953, India in 1974, Mozambique in 1984, Philippines in 1985, Uganda, Albania in 1993, and also the refoundations in Hungary (Eger) and the Czech Republic. In the United States there is currently one province of friars with headquarters in Chicago. There are four provinces of sisters with motherhouses in Wisconsin, Nebraska, and two in Illinois.

Pope Pius XII, through the Congregation of Seminaries and Universities, elevated the Marianum to a pontifical theological faculty on 30 November 1950.

After the Second Vatican Council, the order renewed its Constitutions starting with its 1968 general chapter at Majadahonda, Madrid, a process which was concluded in 1987. In the same year, Prior General Michael M. Sincerny oversaw the creation of the International Union of the Servite Family (UNIFAS).

The twentieth century also saw the beatification (1952) and the canonization of Friar Antonio Maria Pucci; the canonization of Clelia Barbieri (d. 1870), foundress of the Minime dell’Addolorata; the beatification in 1999 of Ferdinando Maria Baccilieri of the Servite Secular Order; the beatification in 2001 of Maria Guadalupe Ricart Olmos, a Spanish cloistered nun who was martyred during the Spanish Civil War; and the beatification of Cecelia Eusepi of the Servite Secular Order.

Through the centuries, the Servite Order has spread throughout the world, including all of Europe, parts of Africa, Australia, the Americas, India, and the Philippines. The general headquarters of the Servite Order is in Rome, while many provinces and motherhouses represent the order throughout the world.

=== Twenty-first century ===
Allegations of sexual assault on children by members of the Servite order surfaced in several jurisdictions in court filings, accompanied by demands for more transparency. 

==Devotions, manner of life==

In common with all religious orders strictly so called, the Servites make solemn vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The particular object of the order is to sanctify first its own members, and then all men through devotion to the Mother of God, especially in her desolation during the Passion of her Divine Son.

All offices in the order are elective and continue for three years, except that of general and assistant-generals which are for six years.

The Servites give missions, have the care of souls, or teach in higher institutions of learning. The Rosary of the Seven Sorrows is one of their devotions, as is also the Via Matris.

Canonized Servite saints are: Philip Benizi (feast day on 23 August), Peregrine Laziosi (4 May), Juliana Falconieri (19 June). The seven founders of the order were canonized in 1888, and have a common feast day on 17 February. The date first assigned to this feast day was 11 February, the anniversary of the canonical approval of the order in 1304. Since in 1907 this date was assigned to the celebration of Our Lady of Lourdes, the feast day of the Seven Holy Founders was moved to 12 February. The date was changed again in 1969 to accord more closely with liturgical tradition, to a date which marks the anniversary of the death of one of them, Alexis Falconieri, which occurred on 17 February 1310.

==Affiliated bodies==
===Second Order===
Connected with the first order of men are the cloistered nuns of the second order, which originated with converts of Philip Benizi. These nuns currently have convents in Spain, Italy, England, the Tyrol, and Germany.

===Mantellate Sisters===
The Mantellate Sisters are a third order of religious women founded by Juliana Falconieri, to whom Benizi gave the habit in 1284. From Italy it spread into other countries of Europe. Anna Juliana, Archduchess of Austria, founded several houses and became a Mantellate herself. 

In 1844 the congregation was introduced into France, and from there extended into England in 1850. The sisters were the first to wear the religious habit publicly in that country after the Protestant Reformation and were active missionaries under Frederick William Faber and the Oratorians for many years. This branch occupies itself with active works. They devote themselves principally to the education of youth, managing academies and taking charge of parochial schools. They also undertake works of mercy, such as the care of orphans, visiting the sick, and instructing converts. Organized into a number of religious congregations, some of pontifical and some of diocesan right, they have houses in Italy, France, Spain, England, and Canada. In the United States they are to be found in the dioceses of Sioux City, Omaha, Charlotte NC, and Chicago. The Congregation first arrived in Africa in 1922.

===Servite Secular Order===
The Secular Order of the Servants of Mary (Servite Secular Order) is an approved Catholic organization of lay men and women plus diocesan priests living their Christian faith in the context of the world. They strive toward holiness according to the spirituality of the Servite Order, following the directives of their Rule of Life. Secular Servites are asked to do the following each day: live the Christian virtues of faith, hope, and love; pray and try to read Sacred Scripture each day, and/or the Liturgy of the Hours; and practice acts of reverence for the Mother of God daily, especially by praying the Servite prayer &quot;The Vigil of Our Lady&quot; and/or the Servite Rosary of the Seven Sorrows of Mary.

There is also a confraternity of the Seven Dolours, branches of which may be erected in any church.

==Mariology and the Marianum==
The pontifical theological faculty &quot;Marianum&quot; which is now one of the leading centers of Mariology was established by the Servite Order in accord with its tradition of many centuries. In 1398 Pope Boniface IX granted the order the right to confer theological degrees. Suppressed by the Kingdom of Italy in 1870, it was reopened in 1895 under the name of Sant&#x27;Alessio Falconeri.

In 1939 the Servite priest Gabriel Roschini founded the journal &quot;Marianum&quot; and directed it for its first thirty years, establishing it as a respected international specialist journal which is still successfully published by the Marianum theological faculty. 

In 1950 Roschini was also instrumental in the reorganization of the Servite house of studies in Rome as the Marianum theological faculty, which, on 8 December 1955 became a pontifical faculty in virtue of the decree &quot;Coelesti Honorandae Reginae&quot; of the Sacred Congregation of Seminaries and Universities under the authority of Pope Pius XII. Its particular speciality is the study of the theology and history of the Blessed Virgin Mary and of her veneration in the church.

<text>The Asiatic Society is an organisation founded during the Company rule in India to enhance and further the cause of &quot;Oriental research&quot; (in this case, research into India and the surrounding regions). It was founded by the philologist William Jones on 15 January 1784 in a meeting presided over by Justice Robert Chambers in Calcutta, the then-capital of the Presidency of Fort William.

At the time of its foundation, this Society was named as &quot;Asiatick Society&quot;. In 1825, the society was renamed as &quot;The Asiatic Society&quot;. In 1832 the name was changed to &quot;The Asiatic Society of Bengal&quot; and again in 1936 it was renamed as &quot;The Royal Asiatic Society of Bengal&quot;. Finally, on 1 July 1951, the name of the society was changed to its present one. The Society is housed in a building at Park Street in Kolkata (Calcutta). The Society moved into this building during 1808. In 1823, the Medical and Physical Society of Calcutta was formed and all the meetings of this society were held in the Asiatic Society.

==History==

In January 1784, Sir William Jones sent out a circular-letter to a selected number of British residents of Calcutta with a view to establish a society for the Asiatic studies. At his invitation, 30 British residents met in the Grand Jury Room of the Supreme Court (in Calcutta&#x27;s Fort William) on 15 January 1784. The meeting was presided over by Sir Robert Chambers. At this meeting, Jones explained the aims of the Society he would establish. The &quot;Memorandum of Articles&quot; of the Asiatic Society, prepared by Jones said:

 The bounds of investigations will be the geographical limits of Asia, and within these limits its enquiries will be extended to whatever is performed by man or produced by nature.Notable early members were Charles Wilkins and Alexander Hamilton (the cousin of the American statesman). Initially, the Grand Jury Room of the Supreme Court was used for the meetings of the members, who had to pay a quarterly fee of two mohurs. The members were elected through ballot-voting. On 29 September 1796, the Society decided to have its own building. J.H. Harrington, then vice-president, selected the corner of Park Street and Chowringhee Road (present location) for the Society&#x27;s house. The site was granted to the Society on 15 May 1805. The original plan for the new building was prepared by Captain Thomas Preston. The French architect Jean-Jacques Pichou made certain modifications to it and constructed a two-storeyed building at the site. This 15,071 ft2 building was built at a cost of Rs. 30,000. The first quarterly meeting of the Society for 1808 was held at its new building on 3 February 1808.

From 1784 to 1828, only Europeans were elected members of the Society. In 1829, at the initiative of H.H. Wilson, a number of Indians were elected members, which include Dwarakanath Tagore, Sivchandra Das, Maharaja Baidyanath Roy, Maharaja Bunwari Govind Roy, Raja Kalikrishna Bahadur, Babu Rajchunder Das (Zamindar of Janbazar), Ram Comul Sen, and Prasanna Coomar Tagore (member of the Pathuriaghata branch of the Tagore family). On 12 December 1832, Ram Comul Sen was elected &#x27;Native Secretary&#x27;. Later, Rajendralal Mitra became the first Indian President in 1885. Both the orientalist Brajendranath De, and one of his grandsons, the historian Barun De, were for some time vice-president of the Asiatic Society.IT IS ALIVE NOW ALSO TO ENQUITE ABOUT FURTHER STUDIES OF HISTORY. 

==Library==

One of the main activities of the Asiatic Society was to collect the old manuscripts of India. There was an enormous collection of Sanskrit manuscripts with the society. At present, the library of the Asiatic Society has a collection of about books and 79,000 journals printed in almost all the major languages of the world. It has also a collection of 293 maps, microfiche of 48,000 works, microfilm of 387,003 pages, 182 paintings, 2500 pamphlets, and 2150 photographs. The earliest printed book preserved in this library is Juli Firmici&#x27;s &quot;Astronomicorum Libri&quot; published in 1499. It has in its possession a large number of books printed in India in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. The library also possesses many rare and scarcely available books. The library has a rich collection of about 47,000 manuscripts in 26 scripts. The most notable amongst them are an illustrated manuscript of the &quot;Qur&#x27;an&quot;, a manuscript of the &quot;Gulistan&quot; text, and a manuscript of &quot;Padshah Nama&quot; bearing the signature of Emperor Shahjahan. The library also has coins issued by Chhatrapati Shivaji Mahraj.

The early collection of this library was enriched by the contributions it received from its members. On 25 March 1784, the library received seven Persian manuscripts from Henri Richardson. The next contribution came from William Marsden, who donated his book &quot;The History of Sumatra&quot; (1783) on 10 November 1784. Robert Home, the first Library-in-Charge (1804) donated his small but valuable collection of works on art. The first accession of importance was a gift from the Seringapatam Committee on 3 February 1808 consisting of a collection from the Palace Library of Tipu Sultan. The library received the Surveyor-General Colonel Mackenzie&#x27;s collection of manuscripts and drawings in December 1822.

Since 1849, the Society has printed &quot;Bibliotheca Indica&quot;, a collection of rare and unpublished works belonging to or treating of Oriental literature and containing original text-editions as well as translations into English, and also grammars, dictionaries, bibliographies, and studies.

==Museum==

The museum of the Society was founded in 1814 under the superintendence of Nathaniel Wallich. The rapid growth of its collection is evident from its first catalogue, published in 1849. By 1849, the Society had its own museum consisting of inscriptions in stone and metal, icons, old coins, and Sanskrit manuscripts etc.
When the Indian Museum of Calcutta was established in 1814, the Society handed over most of its valuable collections to it. The Society, however, still has a museum of its own which possesses a rock edict of Asoka (c. 250 BCE) and a significant collection of copper plate inscriptions, coins, sculptures, manuscripts, and archival records. Some masterpieces, like Joshua Reynolds’ &quot;Cupid asleep on Cloud&quot;, Guido Cagnacci&#x27;s &quot;Cleopatra&quot;, Thomas Daniell&#x27;s &quot;A Ghat at Benares,&quot; and Peter Paul Rubens’ &quot;Infant Christ&quot; are also in the possession of this museum.

<text>Bonnyrigg is a town in Midlothian, Scotland, which is eight miles (13 kilometres) southeast of Edinburgh city centre, between the Rivers North and South Esk. The town had a population of 14,663 in the 2001 census which rose to 15,677 in the 2011 census, both figures based on the 2010 definition of the locality which, as well as Bonnyrigg and the adjacent settlement of Lasswade, includes Polton village, Poltonhall housing estate and modern development at Hopefield. The estimated population for 2018 is 18,120, the highest of any town in Midlothian. Along with Lasswade, Bonnyrigg is a twin town with Saint-Cyr-l&#x27;École, France.

== History ==

Early maps of the locality show various versions of the village name. It first appears as a small hamlet on William Roy&#x27;s map of c.1750 as &quot;Bonnebrig&quot;. From 1763, it is called &quot;Bannockrigg&quot; or &quot;Bannoc Rig&quot;. In 1817 the village is named &quot;Bonny Ridge&quot;, then &quot;Bonny Rigg&quot; in 1828, &quot;Bonnyrig&quot; in 1834, &quot;Bonny Rig&quot; in 1850 until, finally, the Ordnance Survey map of 1850-1852 standardises the name as &quot;Bonnyrigg&quot;.

In 1865, the villages of Bonnyrigg, Red Row, Polton Street, Hillhead and Broomieknowe combined to form the burgh of Bonnyrigg, and then, in 1881, the village of Lasswade and part of Broomieknowe combined to form the burgh of Lasswade. In 1929 the two burghs joined together to form the burgh of Bonnyrigg &amp; Lasswade. This burgh lasted for 45 years until it was abolished in 1974/75, when local government changes were introduced. Bonnyrigg was a mining village until the 1920s, while its Henry Widnell &amp; Stewart carpet factory was demolished in 1994. Twentieth century expansions included the Hopefield, Poltonhall and Waverley neighbourhoods.

The town centre mostly dates from the 19th century, though buildings at the main crossroads were rebuilt in the 1960s. In 2006, Bonnyrigg town centre benefitted from £1.5M of environmental improvements. Natural stone paving replaced the existing concrete paving slabs in areas across the town centre and new street lighting and furniture were installed.

Under the &quot;Midlothian Local Development Plan&quot;, the area&#x27;s population is to rise considerably during the 2020s, with ongoing developments at Hopefield and Burnbrae south-west of the town centre augmented by another substantial project in the fields at Dalhousie Mains to the south-east. It is likely that the area&#x27;s infrastructure will be unable to support the anticipated population increase.

==Transport==

Bonnyrigg lies on the B704 (High Street)/(Dundas Street) and the A6094 (Polton Street)/(Lothian Street) which cross at Bonnyrigg Toll. 

The most frequent bus service is the Lothian Buses service 31 which goes from East Craigs in the west of Edinburgh via Princes Street, passing Bonnyrigg Toll approximately every 15 minutes, terminating alternately at Hopefield and Polton. The X31 service runs from Haymarket in Edinburgh to Rosewell via Bonnyrigg Toll and Hopefield at peak times. Lothian Buses service 46 from Musselburgh to Rosewell via the Royal Infirmary and Fort Kinnaird, and East Coast Buses services 140 &amp; 141 from Musselburgh to Penicuik, also serve the town.

Bonnyrigg railway station served the town from 1855 until 1962 for passengers, freight services continuing until 1965 when the station closed completely. The opening of the Borders Railway in September 2015 has re-connected Bonnyrigg to the national rail network via nearby Eskbank railway station.

For walkers the Penicuik–Dalkeith Walkway passes close by, and for cyclists National Cycle Route 1 plus NCN 196 pass through the town.

==Churches==
[[Cockpen and Carrington Parish Church]] 
Bonnyrigg is served by several churches of different denominations. The local Church of Scotland congregations are Bonnyrigg Parish Church in the town centre, plus Cockpen and Carrington Parish Church to the south of the town. Bonnyrigg Parish Church was originally built as Cockpen Free Church. The local Catholic church is Our Lady of Consolation on Hawthornden Avenue.

==Sport==
Bonnyrigg is home to the football club Bonnyrigg Rose F.C., who play in Scottish League Two having gained promotion from the Lowland League in 2022. They were previously a junior club, winning the East Region Super League four times, and are a joint force with Bonnyrigg Rose F.C (Boys Club). Bonnyrigg Rose FC play their home games at New Dundas Park and also have their own social club, Bonnyrigg Rose Social Club. Bonnyrigg Rose Boys Club play their home games at the Staiside Park, Bonnyrigg. They have teams all ages, ranging from under-7s, to under-17s.

Lasswade Rugby Football Club was founded in 1921 and initially played in a field to the west of Dobbies Road before moving to their current ground at Hawthornden in 1974. They compete in Scottish National League Division Three.

The local golf course is Broomieknowe Golf Club. It is an 18-hole course with a par of 70. Mark Patchett is the resident professional.

==Other points of interest==
King George V Park in Bonnyrigg contains a monument to the miners leader, Mick McGahey.

==In literature==
Bonnytown, the birthplace of the eponymous protagonist of John Galt&#x27;s novel &quot;Lawrie Todd&quot; (1830) is based on Bonnyrigg. Galt identifies it as &#x27;situated in one of the pleasantest holms of the sylvan Esk&#x27; and several chapters of the book are set in the village and surrounding parts of Midlothian.

<doc id="1089972" wikidata="Q1011389" url="?curid=1089972" title="Carluke">
<text>Carluke (; ) is a town that lies in the heart of the Lanarkshire countryside in South Lanarkshire, Scotland, northwest of Lanark and southeast of Wishaw.

Carluke is largely a commuter town, with a variety of small stores and supermarkets available at its centre. The surrounding villages of Braidwood, Forth, Kilncadzow, and Law are supported by the various shops and services available in Carluke.

==Carluke today==
Carluke is Clydesdale&#x27;s largest town with a population of 13,810. It sits on a high plateau overlooking the River Clyde, right in the heart of Lanarkshire&#x27;s fruit growing area.

It has a locally important shopping centre and it has seen a recent boom in house building thanks to its direct train link with Glasgow. The town centre was redesigned to create an attractive shopping environment, and work finished in 2006.

Thanks to its proximity to Clydesdale&#x27;s major fruit growers, one of Carluke&#x27;s biggest employers is the jam company R&amp;W Scott.

Memorials to two of Carluke&#x27;s most famous sons were completed in 2006 as part of the town&#x27;s Streetscape Project, regenerating the centre of the town. On the paving at the bottom of the High Street, a design of a compass etched with arrows pointing to places relevant to Carluke such as Tinto and Carluke, New Zealand, has been created in honour of the noted surveyor and cartographer Major General William Roy. Roy&#x27;s birthplace at Miltonhead is marked with a small memorial plaque (near Miltonhead Farm at the west end of Milton road). Doctor Daniel Reid Rankin is remembered by a plaque in Rankin Square with etchings of fossils carved into the granite.

==History==
In a charter by Robert I, dated 1315, Carluke is written &quot;Carneluk&quot;; at different periods it appears as Carlowck, Carlowk, Carluk, Carlook, Carlouk and Carluke. Car or Caer tells us that it is a height or strong position and Luke suggests that it may be dedicated to the saint of that name, or the early Christian saint Moluag (or Luag), however there is evidence that the earliest church was dedicated to St. Andrew, and &#x27;Luke&#x27; is more likely to derive from the commonly revered pre-Christian deity Lugus.

The town was chartered to Captain Walter Lockhart of Kirkton and spouse as a Burgh of Barony in 1662. Carluke expanded during through the industrial age, with work involving corn milling, cotton weaving, coal mining and the manufacture of bricks, glass, confectionery and jam.

==Present day==

Today Carluke&#x27;s population stands at nearly 14,000 and has 6 primary schools.
Carluke Streetscape, a £2.35M town-centre redevelopment project funded by South Lanarkshire Council, was completed in April 2006. As a result, after many years of pedestrianisation, unidirectional vehicular traffic is now permitted along the town&#x27;s High Street and Hamilton Street outwith business hours.
Carluke High School was also redeveloped to make it bigger and more up to date in 2008. In 2010 a £1.1M indoor soft play and cafe &quot;The Bubbles Factory&quot; was built and opened in Hamilton Street, where the &quot;old smiddy&quot; was sited; in 2012 it was voted &quot;The Best Soft Play in the UK&quot;. In 2011, a new Tesco store between Lanark Road and Shieldhill Road was constructed and opened.

==Education==
The town currently has five primary schools: Carluke Primary, High Mill Primary, Kirkton Primary, Crawforddyke Primary, and St Athanasius Primary; all of which have been recently rebuilt or refurbished. Secondary education is provided by Carluke High School, which also serves Law village, Braidwood and Forth. Carluke High School has also been rebuilt on its current site and Kirkton Primary, the last of the schools to be rebuilt, was completed in 2014.
Braidwood Primary is a school near Carluke.

Carluke is also home to a state funded Special School, Victoria Park. The school serves the whole of South Lanarkshire Council and provides education for primary and secondary pupils aged 3 to 18 with special educational needs.

==Sport==
Carluke is home to West of Scotland Football League side Carluke Rovers F.C. who play at the John Cumming Stadium, the field hockey club Clydeside and the Carluke Cobras, one of the top three flag football teams in the UK.

There are also several men&#x27;s amateur football sides in the town Carluke Thistle &amp; Carluke FC 35&#x27;s. At youth level there is also Milton Rovers, Carluke United &amp; Carluke Boys Club.

It was the home of one of the most successful Scottish American football teams The Clydesdale Colts . (Nationale Finalists 3 times and Winners once), The Colts were formed by Lex Carson and Harvey Gordon. Their home games were played at Loch Park Stadium. Carluke&#x27;s Rugby league team is Carluke Tigers.

John Cumming Stadium facilities includes a 400-metre all-weather athletics track and an 11-a-side 3G synthetic football pitch. Situated on the same site, Carluke Leisure Centre facilities include a gym, swimming pool, health suite, creche and coffee shop. Carluke has two lawn bowls clubs, Castlehill Bowling club and Carluke Bowling Club. A concrete outdoor skatepark is located near Crawforddyke primary school, features include quarter pipes, manual pad and bowled section.

==Transport==
Carluke is situated from Junction 8 of the M74, from Junction 6 of the M8 and from the M80 at Cumbernauld, and is the meeting place of the A73 and A721 roads. The town also benefits from frequent direct rail services to Lanark, Motherwell and Glasgow and a recently enhanced bi-hourly service to Edinburgh (Sundays excepted) from Carluke railway station, less than a 10-minute walk from the town centre. There is a circular town bus route that connects the town centre with several local housing schemes. There are also regular bus services to Lanark, Wishaw, Motherwell, Hamilton and Glasgow as well as an hourly express coach service to Glasgow that runs non-stop from the outskirts of Motherwell via the M74, M73 and M8 motorways.

<text>The Bureau of Diplomatic Security, commonly known as Diplomatic Security (DS), is the security branch of the United States Department of State. It conducts international investigations, threat analysis, cyber security, counterterrorism, and protection of people, property, and information. Its mission is to provide a safe and secure environment for officials to execute the foreign policy of the United States.

==Overview==
The Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) is the political face and parent organization of the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS). The DSS consists of over 2,000 Special Agents who are responsible for protecting visiting foreign dignitaries and U.S. diplomatic missions abroad. The DSS is the primary conduit utilized by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Department of State for the majority of all security and law enforcement matters. Both acronyms (DS and DSS) are used interchangeably within the State Department and other agencies.

The assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security is in charge of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. Under the assistant secretary of state are several deputy assistant secretaries; the principal deputy assistant secretary is the director for the Diplomatic Security Service. The director for the DSS is the top-ranking, active special agent in the DSS and leads a force of special agents, diplomatic couriers, security engineering officers, and security technical specialists. Special agents are sometimes referred to as DS agents or DSS agents. Both terms are used interchangeably within the organization and other agencies.

For people who do not work for the Department of State (DOS), there is much confusion about the relationship between DS and DSS. Even within the Department of State, there is still some confusion regarding the difference between the two entities. The DSS is structured as a law enforcement agency that is primarily made up of federal special agents, and the DSS acts as the operational division of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security.

Overseas, DS develops and implements security programs to safeguard all personnel who work in every U.S. diplomatic mission around the world and to protect classified information at these locations. The DS presence overseas is led at each post (embassy) by a DSS special agent who is referred to as a regional security officer, or more commonly as the RSO, and who serves as the senior law enforcement and security attaché. In the United States, DS protects the secretary of state, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and foreign dignitaries and diplomats who visit the United States. DS has protected Yasser Arafat, the Dalai Lama, and Prince Charles. The agency develops and implements security programs to protect the more than 100 domestic State Department facilities as well as the residence of the secretary of state.

In addition to investigating crimes involving passport and visa fraud, DSS agents are engaged in other types of investigation. In cooperation with appropriate U.S. agencies such as the FBI and the CIA, DSS investigates the activities of foreign intelligence agencies directed against Department employees. At the request of other law enforcement agencies, DSS assists in apprehending fugitives who have fled the United States. Personnel security background investigations are conducted on all employees, applicants, and contractors seeking employment with the Department. Intelligence investigations look into terrorist incidents and threats made against State Department employees and facilities throughout the world.

Since 1984, DS has administered the Rewards for Justice Program, which pays monetary rewards of up to $5 million, or in recent years even more, upon special authorization by the secretary of state, to individuals who provide information which substantially leads to the countering of terrorist attacks against United States persons. Through 2001, $62 million had been paid to over forty people in this effort.

==History==

===Bureau of Secret Intelligence===
The Department of State&#x27;s Diplomatic Security Service was formally established in 1916 under Secretary of State Robert Lansing. The office was headed by a chief special agent, who also carried the title of special assistant to the secretary and reported directly to the secretary on special matters.

A handful of agents worked out of two locations, Washington, D.C., and New York City, operating on confidential funds from the secretary&#x27;s office. They conducted sensitive investigations, especially on the operations of foreign agents and their activities in the United States. The Diplomatic Security Service was known as the Bureau of Secret Intelligence at its inception in 1916. The Bureau of Secret Intelligence was also known as U-1, an off-the-books adjunct to the Division of Information. Before the United States entered World War I, German and Austrian spies were conducting operations in New York City. The spies were using forged or stolen identity papers. President Woodrow Wilson authorized the Secretary of State to establish a security arm of the Department of State. Three agents were recruited from the United States Secret Service because of their experience with counterfeit documents. Since the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS) had the best laboratory, the director of the new agency was recruited there.

The assumption is that the name &quot;Office of the Chief Special Agent&quot;, which was sometimes used in 1916, and to this day by various information portals to include the Department of State&#x27;s website, to downplay the bureau&#x27;s original mission.

In 1918, the United States Congress passed legislation requiring passports for Americans traveling abroad and visas for aliens wishing to enter the United States. Shortly thereafter, the Chief Special Agent&#x27;s office began investigating passport and visa fraud. Special agents also protected distinguished visitors to the United States.

During World War I, the Chief Special Agent&#x27;s office was given the responsibility for interning and exchanging diplomatic officials of enemy powers and assisting in screening people repatriated from enemy-controlled areas.

The Chief Special Agent began reporting his normal activities to the Assistant Secretary for Administration. However, he still retained his title of Special Assistant to the Secretary and reported directly to the Secretary on sensitive matters.

With the help of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), security at State expanded and increased the depth of personnel investigations. The Chief Special Agent&#x27;s office was used not only for security work within the State Department but also in several aspects of immigration control and in the control of crime on the high seas.

In the 1930s, it became clear that there were major passport fraud activities worldwide involving both Communists and Nazis. The Chief Special Agent&#x27;s office, working as the investigative and identification arm of the Passport Office, successfully exposed several of these subversive operations.

===Office of Security (S.Y.)===
With the coming of World War II in the minds of the political leaders of America, they decided it was time to develop a separate branch of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. This new branch would be referred to as the Office of Security, or simply the S.Y. One major addition to the Bureau of Diplomatic Society stemming from the addition of the Office of Security was the development of security staffs on a regional level. The Office of Security was also responsible for starting the use of overseas agents carrying out various tasks to protect the security of the United States.
As the threat of terrorist acts against America grew, the SY expanded its role as a part of the United States Department of State.

===World War II===
In many of these cases, the passport aspect was incidental to a much larger problem - Soviet and German espionage networks. Investigation of passport fraud in New York City led to the discovery of a Soviet intelligence network that, in turn, revealed a number of Soviet agents and American Communist Party members engaged in espionage activities. Although a back-door approach, these investigations succeeded in exposing for the first time the existence of such Soviet operations.

With the outbreak of World War II, the office expanded again to manage interning and exchanging diplomatic officials of enemy powers and screening Americans, or those claiming American citizenship, after they were forced to leave occupied territories.

After the war, Secretary of State Edward Stettinius undertook a complete reorganization of the Department that directly affected the Chief Special Agent&#x27;s office. The Secretary requested the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) review and make recommendations on physical and personnel security. One important result of that report was the separation of security functions in the Department.

A new security office was set up, separate from the Chief Special Agent&#x27;s office. This new Office of Security (SY) had a program of regional security staffs in the United States and, for the first time, security officers at missions overseas. Later, security functions were merged and, in 1948, Foreign Correlations (an intelligence service) was incorporated into the office, bringing in that aspect of security. Also in that year, the Marine Security Guard Program was inaugurated at U.S. embassies.

===The Cold War===
The discovery of a listening device in the Great Seal at the U.S. embassy in Moscow, known as The Thing, was the catalyst for developing countermeasures technology. By the end of the 1950s, hundreds of listening devices planted by foreign intelligence services were found in U.S. embassies. Also during this decade, a special assignments staff was created to investigate possible misconduct and contact with foreign intelligence services by State Department personnel. This staff worked closely with Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and FBI Counterintelligence. Reacting to the crisis in electronic surveillance, SY upgraded its technical security program and began hiring engineers. The assignment of Seabee teams to search for listening devices at the U.S. embassies in Moscow and Warsaw led to the Seabee program within the Department.

SY assumed responsibility for the security of Department of State domestic facilities, which included information security, building passes, and the physical security of Department of State facilities.

Beginning in the late 1960s, several ambassadors and Department officials were kidnapped or assassinated. These actions highlighted the possible exploitation of U.S. diplomats for political purposes. To meet this new threat, SY increased its protective capabilities.

The rages of terrorism continued, creating a new and increasingly dangerous threat to U.S. citizens and missions abroad, as well as to distinguished visitors to the United States. SY responded to the emerging threat by hiring over a hundred new agents and purchasing vehicles, radios, and other support equipment.

SY published handbooks on terrorism and provided advice for overseas personnel on traveling safely to and from work and how to make their homes safer. SY began to survey U.S. embassies for vulnerability to attack. Security officers received more intensive training and learned new skills, like defensive driving.

In 1961, according to at least one source, Otto Otepka, then the Director of SY, brought to the attention of the United States Senate Internal Security Subcommittee deficiencies in the State Department clearance process. The allegations were traced all the way up to then-United States Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Despite multiple awards, appeals from multiple U.S. Senators, and despite having maintained his integrity by not backing down, Secretary Rusk removed Otepka from his position and ultimately fired him.

Today, the Diplomatic Security Counterintelligence Directorate conducts a robust counterintelligence program designed to deter, detect, and neutralize the efforts of foreign intelligence services targeting Department of State personnel, facilities, and diplomatic missions worldwide.

The counterintelligence division conducts aggressive counterintelligence inquires and counterespionage investigations with other U.S. Government agencies. All counterespionage investigations are conducted in close coordination with the FBI in accordance with their statutory mandate to prosecute instances or allegations of suspected espionage. The division conducts numerous counterintelligence and security awareness training programs for all U.S. Government personnel requesting or having access to sensitive Department of State facilities and information. All training programs enhance the understanding of both foreign intelligence and espionage threats and countermeasures, and educate employees on the foreign intelligence environment.

In addition, the office relies on a cadre of security engineers to deter, detect, and neutralize attempts by foreign intelligence services to technically penetrate Department of State office buildings and residences. These efforts range from detecting a simple listening device in the wall to countering the most sophisticated electronic eavesdropping devices and systems.

===Bureau of Diplomatic Security and Diplomatic Security Service===
The intensity of terrorist attacks against Americans increased. In the period between 1979 and 1983, there were over 300 attacks; in 1984 alone, there were over 100 attacks. In 1984, Secretary of State George Shultz formed an advisory panel to study make recommendations on minimizing the probability of terrorist attacks on U.S. citizens and facilities.

Headed by retired Admiral Bobby Inman, this commission was known as the Advisory Panel on Overseas Security, or the Inman Panel. The panel examined the Department&#x27;s security programs and, in a report published in June 1985, made its recommendations to the Secretary.

On November 4, 1985, the U.S. Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) and the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) were officially established. Today the Bureau of Diplomatic Security has approximately 34,000 employees; 1,800 of whom are the Federal Agents within the Diplomatic Security Service.
The Inman Panel&#x27;s recommendations received strong support from Congress, and on August 27, 1986, President Ronald Reagan signed H.R. 4151, the Omnibus Diplomatic Security and Antiterrorism Act of 1986, which codified the recommendations of the Inman panel. The new Bureau had a clearly defined mandate outlined in legislation and structured along the lines of other Federal law enforcement, security, and intelligence agencies.

The Diplomatic Courier Service joined the new Bureau at this time. Couriers no longer hand-carried pouches of communications but protected vast amounts of supplies, equipment, and construction materials bound for sensitive overseas posts.

By the end of the 1980s, DS began sharing information with the American business community operating abroad, through the Overseas Security Advisory Council, which itself expanded to include all members of the U.S. private sector, including non-governmental organizations, religious groups, academic organizations, and associations. Also, the Bureau expanded to provide state-of-the-art security to the Department&#x27;s communications and information systems.

The security improvements developed and implemented during the 1980s helped Americans withstand the heightened threat in the next decade.

The DS Rewards for Justice Program was initiated in 1992. Since then, more than $49 million has been paid for information that prevented or resolved acts of international terrorism against Americans. Information received through this program has resulted in the capture of several terrorists, including Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. Although the FBI received the credit, DSS agents actually found and arrested Yousef, the architect of the bombing. Special Agents Bill Miller and Jeff Riner were given a tip by an associate of Ramzi Yousef about his location. They contacted local officials and arrested Yousef.

DS continues to conduct criminal and personnel security investigations critical to the protection of American borders and the national security of the United States. Special agents investigate more than 3,500 passport and visa fraud violations each year. DS receives about 3,000 requests for overseas investigative assistance from U.S. law enforcement agencies annually and has achieved notable success in locating and apprehending wanted fugitives who have fled the United States .

DS also provides protective services to distinguished dignitaries visiting the United States, as well as 24-hour protection to the Secretary of State.

====&quot;War on Terror&quot;====
Following the August 7, 1998, terrorist bombings of the U.S. embassies in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya, the State Department declared the protection of American personnel and facilities overseas a top priority. Congress passed a $1.4 billion Emergency Embassy Security Supplemental (of which DS received about $588 million) enabling the Bureau of make significant improvements at every U.S. diplomatic mission overseas. Since the bombings, the State Department has spent billions of dollars to improve systems and facilities and increase security staffing to protect personnel and dependents around the world.

As overseas security requirements increased, so did the demands on the Diplomatic Courier Service. Couriers now transport more than 115,000 classified and sensitive materials overseas every year.

Security engineering officers (SEOs) continue to design and manage security equipment programs at all posts, which are vital to the protection of our people and facilities abroad. SEOs also work to detect and prevent the loss of sensitive information from technical espionage, a continuing challenge in light of rapidly changing technology in detection equipment, computer systems, intrusion detection systems, and access control equipment.

While focused on improving security at U.S. missions abroad, several highly publicized incidents at the State Department firmly emphasized the need to strengthen domestic security as well. In addition to taking additional security measures at the State Department, the Assistant Secretary for DS convened a panel of security experts from the FBI, CIA, Department of Defense, U.S. Secret Service, and DS to review all domestic security policies, programs, and procedures. The panel made recommendations concerning access control, physical and technical security, security awareness for employees, restriction of traffic around the building, creation of a chemical/biological program, and additional resources for security. The majority of these recommendations were implemented. The Department continues its efforts to enhance its domestic security program.

Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, DS has played an active role in the global &quot;war on terrorism&quot;. With more than 480 special agents assigned to diplomatic missions in 157 countries, DS is the most widely represented American security and law enforcement organization around the world.

The Antiterrorism Assistance Program, provides terrorism-focused police training to civilian security personnel from friendly governments. More than 31,000 students from 127 countries have received ATA training in the last 20 years. These students return to their countries better prepared to fight terrorism and protect Americans overseas during a crisis. In 2017, the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported on weaknesses in Antiterrorism Assistance (ATA) program data and oversight of participants, including those trained in the United States.

==Investigations==
DSS investigations, carried out by numerous Field Offices and Resident Agent offices throughout the U.S, and by RSOs overseas, focus mainly on passport or visa fraud. DSS Special Agents also investigate such cases as international parental kidnapping, violations of the Protect Act, assaults on federally protected persons, fugitive arrests overseas (with host nation assistance), Counterterrorism and Counterintelligence (CI) investigations. If there is a nexus to diplomatic activities, the U.S. Foreign Service, or terrorism, DSS is typically involved.

===Passport and visa fraud===
It is a felony to apply or assist someone in applying for a U.S. passport or visa when they are not entitled to one. Usually this means an alien in the United States trying to establish a false identity or stealing the identity from an American, often one who has died. Sometimes Americans, including Foreign Service Officers (FSOs) are the target of DSS investigations, such as an FSO selling visas for personal gain. DSS also investigates other alleged improper or illegal behavior by Department of State personnel, to include incidents of espionage. Such cases would involve other agencies such as the Department of Justice. Overseas, DSS must take the role of local and state law enforcement when investigating issues such as spousal or child abuse by U.S. government personnel assigned to the embassy. This is because the host country will not investigate or prosecute diplomats, who are considered to have immunity from their laws. DSS also conducts tens of thousands of background investigations per year - not just for the Department of State, but also for other federal agencies.

In recent years, DSS has expanded its overseas investigations program with A/RSO-I&#x27;s (Assistant Regional Security Officer-Investigators) also known as &quot;Overseas Criminal Investigators&quot;. These agents are given special training in consular functions, and are commissioned consular officers. However, they spend a large amount of their time working with the fraud units in consular sections, investigating visa and passport fraud, alien smuggling and human trafficking, although they have responsibilities outside of their respective Consular assignments for mission security. They work closely with host country law enforcement agencies, and have recently been instrumental in dismantling several large alien smuggling rings. Where there exists an identifiable nexus to the United States, DSS coordinates their alien smuggling investigations with the resident or regional Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) attache.

=== Counterintelligence ===
The Diplomatic Security Service Office of Investigations and Counterintelligence (DS/ICI/CI) conducts a robust counterintelligence program designed to deter, detect, and neutralize the efforts of foreign intelligence services targeting Department of State personnel, facilities, and diplomatic missions worldwide.

The office&#x27;s counterintelligence division conducts aggressive counterintelligence inquires and counterespionage investigations with other U.S. Government agencies. Counterespionage investigations are conducted in close coordination with the FBI in accordance with their legal mandates.

The division conducts numerous counterintelligence and security awareness training programs for all U.S. Government personnel requesting or having access to sensitive Department of State facilities and information. All training programs enhance the understanding of both foreign intelligence and espionage threats and countermeasures, and educate employees on the foreign intelligence environment.

In addition, the office relies on a cadre of security engineers to deter, detect, and neutralize attempts by foreign intelligence services to technically penetrate U.S. office buildings and residences. These efforts range from detecting a simple listening device in the wall to countering the most sophisticated electronic eavesdropping devices and systems.

On June 4, 2009, the DSS and the FBI arrested former Department of State employee Walter Kendall Myers on charges of serving as an illegal agent of the Cuban government for nearly 30 years and conspiring to provide classified U.S. information to the Cuban government. Mr. Myers’ arrest is the culmination of a three-year joint DSS/FBI investigation.

===Counterterrorism===
The Diplomatic Security Service maintains agents in dozens of Joint Terrorism Task Force operations around the country. The Office of Protective Intelligence and Investigations in the Threat Intelligence and Analysis division has DSS Special Agents who travel all over the world investigating threats to the Secretary of State and U.S. embassies and consulates. DSS Special Agents on the New York JTTF provided critical information in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and DSS Agents assigned as Regional Security Officers around the world tracked down leads for the FBI and other federal agencies. Any time there is a threat or an attack against a U.S. embassy or consulate, DSS Special Agents are the first on the scene to investigate.

Robert A. Hartung, Assistant Director, of Diplomatic Security&#x27;s Threat Investigations and Analysis Directorate, announced on September 2, 2010 that the U.S. Department of State’s Rewards for Justice (RFJ) program is offering rewards of up to $5 million each for information that leads law enforcement or security forces to Hakimullah Mehsud and Wali ur Rehman.

===Other investigations===
The Diplomatic Security Service investigates crimes against State Department personnel and other U.S. Government personnel and families assigned under Chief of Mission authority at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad. DSS Special Agents have investigated thefts, assaults, rapes, and murders, among other charges, around the world. Unlike investigations conducted in the United States by other federal agencies, DSS Agents have to work jointly with their foreign counterparts in often hostile areas of the world.

On January 28, 2009, a news story broke about a CIA station chief in Algiers, Algeria who was under investigation by DSS for having allegedly raped two Muslim women.

==== Fugitives ====

Because the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service is one of the most widely represented law enforcement organizations in the world, its capability to track and capture fugitives who have fled U.S. jurisdiction to avoid prosecution is often considered unmatched. During 2009, DSS assisted in the resolution of 136 international fugitive cases from around the globe.

In 1995, DSS Special Agents Jeff Riner and Bill Miller, the RSOs assigned to the U.S. embassy in Pakistan, were present with Pakistani police and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) when they arrested Ahmed Ramzi Yousef, who was wanted in connection with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City. Despite FBI press releases, it was not the FBI who captured Yousef but the ISI and DSS.

DSS Special Agents located and returned Jared Ravin Yaffe from Brazil. Yaffe, wanted in California for multiple counts of alleged child sexual assault, kidnapping, and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution, was returned to the United States on May 12, 2009, to face trial. On February 11, 2009, the United States District Court, Southern District of California issued a federal arrest warrant for Yaffe for unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. Yaffe was profiled on the television show America&#x27;s Most Wanted on April 11, 2009.

On September 19, 2009, Special Agents from the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) located Derrick Yancey, a former Deputy Sheriff from DeKalb County Georgia, in Punta Gorda, Belize. Yancey was wanted in Georgia for double murder of his wife Linda Yancey and a day laborer.
Upon arrival at a local bar, at 6:05 PM local time, a DSS agent tapped on Yancey&#x27;s shoulder and told him &quot;It is time to go.&quot; Belize authorities then arrested Yancey. Yancey was featured on America&#x27;s Most Wanted.

On November 23, 2009, DSS Special Agents from the U.S. embassy’s Regional Security Office (RSO) worked closely with the U.S. Marshals Service, Guatemalan National Police, and INTERPOL to locate alleged murder suspect 24-year-old Ariel Beau Patrick, who was taken into custody in Guatemala. Ariel Patrick was featured on America&#x27;s Most Wanted.

AMW - America&#x27;s Most Wanted featured the capture of Robert Snyder in Belize - DSS Special Agent (RSO) Rob Kelty interviewed by John Walsh - Segment aired on February 27, 2010 on AMW.

On April 26, 2010, after failing to check in with pretrial services within two days of his April 21 hearing on his bond status, Andrew Warren, 42, was apprehended by a combined team of Norfolk Police Department Fugitive Investigators, DSS Special Agents and U.S. Marshals. Judge Ellen S. Huvelle of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a bench warrant for the arrest of the former CIA officer.

On July 30, 2010, special agents from the U.S. Department of State&#x27;s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) located fugitive George Alvin Viste in Peru. Viste is wanted in Clark County, Washington on seven different criminal charges including the rape of a child, child molestation, and incest. &quot;Diplomatic Security’s Regional Security Office in Lima worked closely with the U.S. Marshals Service and our law enforcement counterparts in Peru to locate Viste,” said Jeffrey W. Culver, Director of the Diplomatic Security Service.&quot;

On October 8, 2010, Special Agents from the U.S. Department of State&#x27;s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) located Dario Sarimiento Tomas in Pampanga, Philippines. DSS worked with Philippine officials to apprehend Tomas, who is wanted in South Korea on charges that he defrauded an individual there of more than $200,000. Tomas was arrested by law enforcement officials from the Philippine National Bureau of Investigations and National Police. Tomas was assigned to the U.S. embassy in Seoul as a Customs and Border Protection Officer.

On January 12, 2011, Special agents from the U.S. Department of State&#x27;s Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) have located and helped return California fugitive John Pope from Mexico. Pope, formerly of San Francisco, was taken into custody by Mexican authorities in La Paz, Mexico on January 12 and returned to the United States on January 18, 2011 to face trial. John Pope has been wanted by the San Francisco District Attorney&#x27;s Office since October 20, 1998, in connection with allegations of fraud concerning embezzlement of $1,000,000 from the estate of a deceased San Francisco businessman.

February 3, 2011 - Paul Eischeid, a fugitive, and member of the Hells Angels who had eluded U.S. Marshals for nearly eight years—is finally in handcuffs. U.S. Marshals tell AMW that the accused murderer was taken down in Buenos Aires on Feb. 3, 2011. Authorities say an Interpol Red Notice, as well as investigations by the U.S. Marshals Service and the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service in Argentina led to the elusive fugitive&#x27;s capture.

;Budget 
The fiscal 2019 budget plan saw an 11% cut to overall diplomatic security in fiscal year 2020, with 18% specifically cut from embassy security, construction, and maintenance.

==Overseas Security Advisory Council==
The Overseas Security Advisory Council (OSAC), an office within the Bureau of Diplomatic Security&#x27;s Directorate of Threat Investigations and Analysis (DS/TIA), was created in 1985 under the Federal Advisory Committee Act to promote security cooperation between American private sector interests worldwide and the U.S. Department of State. It started as a way for major U.S. corporations to receive pertinent security information direct from the government, but has since expanded to include much smaller organizations. Today, over 4,500 U.S. companies, educational institutions, faith-based institutions, and non-governmental organizations are OSAC constituents. Any private-sector organization incorporated in the United States is eligible to join, and constituency is offered free of charge.

OSAC, through its staff of foreign service, civil service, and government contract professionals in the Research and Information Support Center (RISC), provides a forum for sharing best practices, provides the tools needed to cope with security-related challenges and issues abroad, and provides analytical reporting on trends, incidents, and events affecting the private sector, including public annual Crime &amp; Safety Reports with information for private-sector security managers to use when making decisions affecting their organizations. OSAC&#x27;s reports also include ratings for every location where the United States has a diplomatic facility. However, these are Department of State ratings that speak to the threat against official U.S. Government interests in specific cities; they are not created by OSAC, and are neither countrywide threat ratings nor ratings evaluating the threat to private U.S. travelers.

Private-sector member organizations are selected from its constituency to serve for two to six-year terms on the OSAC Council. Representatives of the member organizations meet quarterly to tackle specific projects, such as the protection of business information and mitigating the effects from transnational crime. The OSAC Council is chaired by the Director of the Diplomatic Security Service and co-chaired by a selected representative of the private sector; currently, the private-sector co-chair represents the Raytheon Company.

OSAC maintains a public website at www.osac.gov. The office was established under authority of the Secretary of State pursuant to 22 U.S.C. § 2656 and in accordance with the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), as amended, 5 U.S.C. App., and its regulations, 41 C.F.R. Part 102-3.

According to 2017 reports, at least the following countries have a critical security rating: Argentina, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Peru, high security rating include Albania, medium security reports includes Bolivia among others and 2017 low security report rating includes Canada, Montenegro and Spain among others.

==Personnel==
Special Agents of the U.S. Diplomatic Security Service - DSS are sworn Federal law enforcement agents who are responsible for the security of Foreign Service personnel, property and sensitive information throughout the world. Although the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) is an organization within the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, it is the primary conduit utilized by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security for the majority of all law enforcement and security matters. The DSS is the federal law enforcement branch of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security. DSS Special Agents are responsible for the protection of the Secretary of State, certain foreign dignitaries during their visits to the U.S., and others as designated by the Secretary of State. Major activities include protective services, management of security programs for Foreign Service posts, criminal investigations, and background investigations, in addition to administrative, training, and liaison functions.
Security Engineering Officers (SEO) are responsible for managing the Department&#x27;s technical and information security programs, projects, and resources throughout the world. SEOs protect personnel, facilities, and sensitive information against espionage, terrorism, and crime. These highly skilled engineers develop, maintain, and install electrical and mechanical systems such as access and perimeter controls, closed-circuit television, alarms, locks, and x-ray and bomb detection equipment. Engineers plan and conduct technical surveillance inspections to detect and nullify clandestine intrusions. They test new technical equipment and develop new techniques, strategies, and procedures for finding hidden intelligence-gathering devices. SEOs continually are challenged to identify security risks, analyze those risks, and develop systems to ensure the integrity of Department of State computers and worldwide network information systems. U.S. Navy Seabees and a cadre of specially trained Security Technical Specialists (STS) assist SEOs with the maintenance and repair of our security systems. Domestically SEO&#x27;s manage, plan, and provide engineering support to worldwide technical security programs and to the Secretary of State and visiting dignitaries. Overseas SEO&#x27;s manage Engineering Service Centers (ESC) and Engineering Service Offices (ESO), which provide technical security to one or multiple posts under the management of Regional Security Officers (RSO).

Security Technical Specialists (STS) are support personnel within the Bureau of Diplomatic Security who assist in worldwide technical security programs. These programs provide protection for Department of State facilities and personnel from technical espionage, acts of terrorism, and crime. In this protection effort, sophisticated electronic and electromechanical security systems are used throughout the world, which include: intrusion detection systems (IDS), closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems, vehicular and pedestrian access control systems, metal detectors, and explosive detection systems. STS&#x27;s support technical security support domestically and at ESC&#x27;s and ESO&#x27;s worldwide.

Diplomatic Couriers protect information by ensuring the secure movement of classified U.S. Government material across international borders to over 180 Foreign Service missions. Diplomatic pouches can contain thousands of pounds of equipment and construction materials, as well as classified documents bound for sensitive posts. Additionally, Diplomatic courier control officers escort sensitive, but unclassified, crated materials within the United States and across international boundaries. These materials receive the same secure shipment as diplomatic pouches but, unlike diplomatic pouches, are declared to customs on entry into a country. The Diplomatic Courier Service securely delivered over 9.5 million pounds of classified material and 1 million pounds of controlled material last year. The Diplomatic Courier Service is constantly evolving to meet the increasingly restrictive guidelines imposed by various countries.
==Note==
* With the exception of GS employees of DS serving domestically, most DS personnel are members of the United States Foreign Service, serving as Specialists.

<text>The Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) is the principal law enforcement and security agency of the United States Department of State (DOS). Its primary mission is to protect diplomatic assets, personnel, and information, and combat transnational crimes connected to visa and passport fraud. DSS also conducts counterterrorism, counterintelligence, cybersecurity and criminal investigations domestically and abroad. 

Originating in diplomatic security measures implemented during the First World War, DSS was formally established in 1985 following the deadly 1983 bombings of the U.S. embassy and Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon. It is the leading U.S. law enforcement agency abroad and the most widely deployed in the world, protecting 275 U.S. diplomatic missions in over 170 countries and in more than 30 U.S. cities. As employees of the U.S. State Department, DSS special agents are unique in U.S. federal law enforcement for also being members of the Foreign Service.

The service&#x27;s most visible activity is providing security to the U.S. secretary of state, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and other senior diplomats. As part of its duty to provide a safe and secure environment for U.S. diplomacy, DSS also protects foreign dignitaries visiting the United States, advises U.S. ambassadors on security matters, and manages security programs for international events, often in cooperation with domestic and foreign counterparts.

== Overview ==
While best known for its security role, DSS is a full-fledged law enforcement agency that conducts international criminal investigations, threat analysis, counterterrorism, counterintelligence, security technology, and cybersecurity. The agency employs over 2,500 Foreign Service specialists, including special agents, security engineering officers, security technical specialists, and diplomatic couriers. DSS agents are federal agents with the power to arrest, carry firearms, serve arrest warrants and perform other law enforcement activities.

Whereas most U.S. federal law enforcement agents are members of the federal civil service, the majority of DSS special agents are both Foreign Service specialists and law enforcement officers. DSS agents are unique in being required to serve multiple-year tours abroad as a condition of employment. When not on an overseas assignment, agents serve at DSS headquarters in Arlington, Virginia, or in one of the thirty-three field offices nationwide. A small percentage of DSS special agents are members of the State Department&#x27;s civil service and are not mandated to serve tours overseas; they instead focus on criminal investigations and dignitary protection within the United States.

When assigned to domestic field offices, DSS special agents investigate transnational crimes, passport fraud and visa fraud, and protect visiting foreign dignitaries. They also investigate the activities of foreign intelligence agencies that are focused on the Department of State, assist in apprehending fugitives that have fled the United States, and conduct background checks on State Department employees, applicants and contractors.

DSS special agents perform law enforcement duties at U.S. missions, provide security assistance, protect senior diplomats, and perform other roles as needed. The ranking DSS special agent at an embassy or consulate holds the title of regional security officer (RSO) and is often known as the &quot;security attaché.&quot;

==History==
The origins of DSS go back to the early stages of the First World War, when the United States, which sought to maintain its neutrality, found itself the target of espionage, sabotage and passport fraud. German and Austrian spies were known to be conducting operations in New York City using forged or stolen identity papers. In late 1915, Secretary of State Robert Lansing recommended creating an international law enforcement task force within the Department of State to investigate such crimes.

=== Bureau of Secret Intelligence ===

When his suggestion failed to gain support, on April 4, 1916, Secretary Lansing, with the authorization of President Woodrow Wilson, created his own task force, the Bureau of Secret Intelligence, which he dubbed &quot;the Secret Service of the Department of State.&quot; An off-the-books adjunct to the Division of Information, the Bureau was also known as the Office of the Chief Special Agent, possibly to disguise its sensitive operations.

Supported by confidential funds from Secretary Lansing&#x27;s office, this small force was composed of agents from the U.S. Secret Service, who specialized in counterfeit currency, and agents of the U.S. Postal Inspection Service (USPIS), which had the best forensic laboratory in the country. The agents were overseen by a junior Foreign Service officer, Leland Harrison. Tasked primarily with counterespionage and counterintelligence, the team also investigated passport fraud, protected U.S. and foreign diplomats on U.S. soil, and processed threat reports from overseas posts. Following U.S. entry into the war, the Bureau also interned and exchanged diplomatic officials of enemy powers.

After the war ended, Congress passed laws requiring American citizens to return with passports and resident aliens to enter with visas. State Department agents began investigating subsequent instances of passport and visa fraud. Around this same time State Department agents began protecting distinguished visitors to the United States. By the 1920s, the chief special agent no longer reported his office&#x27;s activities directly to the Secretary of State, instead answering to the assistant secretary of state for administration. Within the next two decades major passport fraud activities were detected and neutralized worldwide, often involving both Communists and Nazis.

=== Office of Security ===
During World War II, State Department agents were once again involved in interning and exchanging diplomatic officials of enemy powers. Around this time, the Chief Special Agent&#x27;s office became known as SY (short for Office of Security), which in turn was under the Administration Bureau of the Management Undersecretary. After World War II, SY began expanding its presence overseas, with numerous Regional Security Officer (RSO) positions created in overseas posts.

In 1961, Otto Otepka, then a deputy director of SY, brought to the attention of the U.S. Senate Internal Security Subcommittee deficiencies in the State Department clearance process. The allegations were traced all the way up to then Secretary of State Dean Rusk. Despite multiple awards, appeals from multiple U.S. Senators and not backing down, Secretary Rusk removed Otepka from his position and ultimately unceremoniously fired him.

Starting sometime after World War II, SY began regularly protecting visiting heads of state, but it had done so sporadically since the 1930s. Before his departure in 1947, SY Director Bannerman began codifying procedures for overseas security. This process continued in the late 1940s, with a number of RSO positions being created. From that time and through the early 1970s, the number of agents remained relatively small, hovering around 300, with more than half of these serving overseas at any given time. The April 1983 U.S. embassy bombing was a catharsis for the State Department, which would transform SY into the newly created Diplomatic Security Service, part of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security.

=== Diplomatic Security Service ===
Congress formed a commission headed by Admiral Bobby Ray Inman to look into the bombings of U.S. diplomatic facilities in Beirut. The resultant Inman Report recommended that security at the State Department needed to be elevated to a higher priority. In 1985, Congress created the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS), headed by the Assistant Secretary of State for Diplomatic Security, and the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS), headed by the Director of DSS, who is subordinate to the Assistant Secretary of State for DS. However, DSS is the federal law enforcement agency, and not the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS).

The director of DSS is an active DSS agent and is often referred as the principal deputy assistant secretary (PDAS), as he/she is senior to the various assistant directors of Diplomatic Security who hold positions equivalent to deputy assistant secretary (DAS). The PDAS designation signifies the DSS director&#x27;s preeminence over the other DASs within DSS, while at the same time signifying his/her position under the assistant secretary of State for Diplomatic Security.

The first assistant secretaries for DS were senior Foreign Service officers, while the last several have been retired senior DSS special agents. With the creation of DSS, its ranks grew to well over 1,000 agents. However, by the mid-1990s, budget cutbacks were foisted on the U.S. State Department by Congress, and the department in turn trimmed the budget of DSS to the point where it had dwindled to a little over 600 agents.

Although DSS was by then a bureau within the State Department, the vast majority of RSOs overseas continued to report to the administration officer. This changed in 1999, as fallout from the East Africa embassy bombings of 1998. The terse message from the then undersecretary for management announcing the immediate change made it clear that this action was against his best judgment and insinuated that it was done because then Secretary of State Madeleine Albright ordered it. This change stripped DSS out from under administration officers and placed the RSO directly under the deputy chief of mission (DCM) in the chain of command at an embassy.

== Structure and organization ==

Outside the Department of State, there is much confusion about the relationship between the Bureau of Diplomatic Security (DS) and the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS). DS oversees all security-related matters at the Department of State, which includes security at U.S. embassies and consulates. DS has approximately 40,000 employees, of whom roughly 2,500 are Foreign Service specialists within DSS. As such, DSS is the primary mechanism by which the Bureau of Diplomatic Security accomplishes its law enforcement (criminal investigative) and security missions.

The Bureau of Diplomatic Security is headed by the assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security, who in turn is served by several deputy assistant secretaries (DAS). The principal deputy assistant secretary (PDAS) is the director for the Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) and is an active DSS special agent.All employees who work for Bureau of Diplomatic Security, including those of DSS, are referred to as DS employees. DSS special agents are frequently assigned to positions within DSS, but occasionally work outside of their bureau structure. For example, while assigned overseas, Department of State employees are evaluated by their superiors at the embassy or consulate to which they are assigned. In the case of DSS agents, the RSO (senior special agent at post) is rated by the deputy chief of mission and reviewed by the chief of mission (ambassador). DSS hierarchy has no input on the agent&#x27;s evaluation, though it does provide instructions to the agent.

== Protection mission ==
DSS is best identified with its protection assignments around the globe. The largest permanent dignitary protection detail carried out by DSS agents is on the United States secretary of state. The ambassador to the United Nations also has an ongoing protection detail. Some U.S. ambassadors receive protection from DSS in addition to security provided overseas by the host countries, depending on their post. 

Protection of visiting foreign ministers and senior officials from major nations, heads of states and governments not officially recognized by the U.S, heads of major international organizations and high ranking diplomats are typically covered by DSS. Notable protection details include most major members of the British royal family, the Fourteenth Dalai Lama, Palestinian Authority president Mahmoud Abbas, Princess Diana, Yasser Arafat, Tsai Ing-wen and Boris Yeltsin. DSS may also provide protection to high-risk private individuals visiting the United States, such as prominent foreign dissidents or opposition leaders.

While DSS protects visiting foreign dignitaries, the U.S. Department of State&#x27;s Office of Foreign Missions is responsible for the protection of foreign embassies and consulates on U.S. soil. Since DSS does not have a true uniformed force with police powers, other agencies or local police departments are reimbursed for providing this service; two notable are the Secret Service Uniformed Division in Washington, D.C. and the New York City Police Department. During the annual United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) meeting in September, DSS, as well as the U.S. Secret Service and other federal agencies, protect hundreds of foreign dignitaries as they visit New York City.

DSS has the authority to provide protection for foreign heads of state and was the lead agency for this role through the early 1970s. However, an order signed by President Richard Nixon gave primary responsibility of protection of visiting heads of state to the Secret Service.

== Investigations ==
DSS investigations, carried out by numerous field offices and resident agent offices throughout the U.S, and by RSOs overseas, focus mainly on passport or visa fraud. DSS special agents also investigate such cases as human and sex trafficking, document fraud, international parental kidnapping, child exploitation, violations of the Protect Act, assaults on federally protected persons, fugitive arrests overseas (with host nation assistance), counterterrorism and counterintelligence (CI) investigations and international organized crime cases. If there is a nexus to passport and/or visa fraud, use of State Department documents, diplomatic activities, the U.S. Foreign Service, or terrorism, DSS is typically involved.

According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS) Federal Criminal Case Processing Statistics, the Department of State is responsible for roughly 200 domestic criminal arrests per year from 2011-2019 (with drop-offs due to COVID-19 and other internal factors resulting in a reduction of over 50% in 2020 and 2021).

=== Passport and visa fraud ===
U.S. passports and visas are valuable travel documents, and consequently some foreign nationals fraudulently acquire U.S. passports and visas to carry out criminal activities, including terrorism, inside the borders of the United States. It is a federal offense to apply, or assist someone in applying, for a U.S. passport or visa when they are not entitled to one. Usually this means an alien in the U.S. trying to establish a false U.S. identity, or stealing the identity from an American, often one who has died. Visa fraud can also include participating in sham marriages in order to allow an unentitled foreigner to become a U.S. citizen.

Sometimes Americans, including Foreign Service officers (FSOs), are the target of DSS investigations, such as an FSO selling visas for personal gain. DSS also investigates other alleged improper or illegal behavior by Department of State personnel, to include incidents of espionage. Such cases would involve other agencies, such as the Department of Justice. Overseas DSS must take the role of local and state law enforcement when investigating issues such as spousal or child abuse by U.S. government personnel assigned to the embassy. This is because the host country will not investigate or prosecute diplomats, who are considered to have immunity from their laws. DSS also conducts tens of thousands of background investigations per year – not just for the Department of State, but for other federal agencies as well.

In recent years, DSS has expanded its overseas investigations program with DSS special agents serving as overseas criminal investigators (OCIs). These agents are given special training in consular functions and are commissioned consular officers. However, they spend a large amount of their time working with the fraud units in consular sections, investigating visa and passport fraud, as well as crimes that have a nexus to those documents, including terrorism, organized crime, trafficking in persons, and narcotics violations. At the U.S. border, OCIs may work alien smuggling, human trafficking, and passport and visa fraud cases with U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and Homeland Security Investigations. In addition, OCIs also have responsibilities outside of their respective consular assignments for mission security.

=== Counterintelligence ===
The DSS Office of Investigations and Counterintelligence conducts a robust counterintelligence program designed to deter, detect, and neutralize the efforts of foreign intelligence services targeting Department of State personnel, facilities, and diplomatic missions worldwide.

The office&#x27;s counterintelligence division conducts aggressive counterintelligence inquires and counterespionage investigations with other U.S. government agencies. Counterespionage investigations are conducted in coordination with the FBI in accordance with their legal mandates.

The division conducts numerous counterintelligence and security awareness training programs for all U.S. government personnel requesting or having access to sensitive Department of State facilities and information. All training programs enhance the understanding of both foreign intelligence and espionage threats and countermeasures, and educate employees on the foreign intelligence environment.

In addition, the office relies on a cadre of security engineers to deter, detect, and neutralize attempts by foreign intelligence services to technically penetrate U.S. office buildings and residences. These efforts range from detecting a simple listening device in the wall to countering the most sophisticated electronic eavesdropping devices and systems.

On June 4, 2009, DSS and the FBI arrested former Department of State employee Walter Kendall Myers on charges of serving as an illegal agent of the Cuban government for nearly 30 years and conspiring to provide classified U.S. information to the Cuban government. Myers’ arrest is the culmination of a three-year joint DSS/FBI investigation.

=== Counterterrorism ===
The Diplomatic Security Service maintains agents on dozens of Joint Terrorism Task Forces around the country. The Office of Protective Intelligence and Investigations (PII) in the Threat Intelligence and Analysis division has DSS special agents who travel all over the world investigating threats to the secretary of State and U.S. embassies and consulates. Any time there is a threat or an attack against a U.S. embassy or consulate, DSS special agents are the first on the scene to investigate.

The Rewards for Justice Program (RFJ) is the counterterrorism rewards program of DSS. The secretary of State is currently offering rewards for information that prevents or favorably resolves acts of international terrorism against U.S. persons or property worldwide.

In the days following the April 15, 2013, Boston Marathon bombing, DSS special agents investigated the incident along with personnel from the FBI, HSI, State Police, Boston Police, Cambridge Police, and other law enforcement agencies; this led to the death of one suspect and the capture of the second suspect.

=== Other investigations ===
DSS investigates crimes against State Department personnel and other U.S. government personnel and families assigned under chief-of-mission authority at a U.S. embassy or consulate abroad. DSS special agents have investigated thefts, assaults, rapes, and murders, among other charges, around the world. Unlike investigations conducted in the United States by other federal agencies, DSS agents have to work jointly with their foreign counterparts in often hostile areas of the world.

On January 28, 2009, CIA station chief Andrew Warren in Algiers, Algeria, was reportedly under investigation by DSS for having allegedly raped two local women.

=== Fugitives ===
The Diplomatic Security Service is tasked with tracking and capturing fugitives who have fled U.S. jurisdiction to avoid prosecution. DSS locates and helps return approximately 300 fugitives annually, often working with other U.S. law enforcement agencies, most notably the U.S. Marshals Service. 

In 1995 DSS Special Agents Jeff Riner and Bill Miller, the RSOs assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan, along with Pakistani police and Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), arrested Ramzi Yousef, who was the mastermind behind the 1993 World Trade Center bombing in New York City. Despite its press releases, the FBI played no role in his capture.

In another case, Jared Ravin Yaffe ran a child pornography ring between March and September 2008 by paying babysitters to give him access to children. When police took note, Yaffe fled to North Carolina, Germany, Romania or Bulgaria, and finally Brazil. He traveled under his real name with his own passport and was chased by U.S. Marshals. On February 11, 2009, the United States District Court, Southern District of California issued a federal arrest warrant for Yaffe, and on April 11, Yaffe was profiled on the television show &quot;America&#x27;s Most Wanted&quot;. Brazilian federal police caught him on May 11, and he was returned to the United States the next day, where he faced 20 counts in San Diego of child sexual assault, kidnapping, production of child pornography, and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. He initially pled not guilty, and his bail was set at $5 million. A year after his capture, Yaffe pled guilty to several counts and was sentenced to 45 years to life in prison, while a babysitter who had provided a child to him also pled guilty and was sentenced to 15 years to life in prison. 

On September 19, 2009, special agents from DSS located Derrick Yancey, a former deputy sheriff from DeKalb County, Georgia, in Punta Gorda, Belize. Yancey was wanted in Georgia for double murder of his wife Linda Yancey and a day laborer.

On November 23, 2009, DSS special agents from the U.S. Embassy&#x27;s Regional Security Office (RSO) worked closely with the U.S. Marshals Service, Guatemalan National Police, and INTERPOL to locate alleged murder suspect 24-year-old Ariel Beau Patrick, who was taken into custody in Guatemala. Ariel Patrick was featured on America&#x27;s Most Wanted.

On April 26, 2010, after failing to check in with pretrial services within two days of his April 21 hearing on his bond status, Andrew Warren 42, was apprehended by a combined team of Norfolk Police Department Fugitive Investigators, DSS special agents and U.S. Marshals. Judge Ellen S. Huvelle of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a bench warrant for the arrest of the former CIA officer.

On July 30, 2010, special agents from DSS located fugitive George Alvin Viste in Peru. Viste was wanted in Clark County, Washington, on seven different criminal charges including the rape of a child, child molestation, and incest. “Diplomatic Security’s Regional Security Office in Lima worked closely with the U.S. Marshals Service and our law enforcement counterparts (INTERPOL) in Peru to locate Viste,” said Jeffrey W. Culver, Director of the Diplomatic Security Service.

On October 8, 2010, DSS agents located Dario Sarimiento Tomas in Pampanga, Philippines. DSS worked with Philippine officials to apprehend Tomas, who was wanted in South Korea on charges that he defrauded an individual there of more than $200,000. Tomas was arrested by law enforcement officials from the Philippine National Bureau of Investigations and National Police. Tomas was assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Seoul as a Customs and Border Protection Officer.

On February 3, 2011, Paul Eischeid, a fugitive and member of the Hells Angels who had eluded U.S. Marshals for nearly eight years, was arrested. The accused murderer was arrested in Buenos Aires. An Interpol Red Notice, as well as investigations by the U.S. Marshals Service and DSS in Argentina led to his capture.

On October 5, 2011, in cooperation with the U.S. Marshals Montana Violent Offender Task Force and Belize Police, DSS arrested Michael Patrick McNulty on a $100,000 warrant issued by the state of Montana.

On November 7, 2012, U.S. Marshals Service (USMS) announces the capture of John Earl Gorham. The U.S. Parole Commission issued an arrest warrant for Gorham on Oct. 17, regarding the subject&#x27;s original conviction of sodomy, kidnapping and assault with the intent to commit sodomy. Gorham was convicted and sentenced to 35 years on these charges. Gorham was arrested for being drunk in public and for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old female at a Chantilly High School football game. The USMS and task force partners from the Diplomatic Security Service located Gorham at his residence on Church Lane in Bowie, MD. The subject was arrested without incident and turned over to the U.S. District Court in the District of Columbia for prosecution.

On April 20, 2013, in coordination with Nicaraguan authorities, the FBI&#x27;s Panama City Legal Attaché Office and the Diplomatic Security&#x27;s Regional Security Office of the U.S. Embassy in Managua located Eric Justin Toth in Esteli, Nicaragua, where he was placed into custody. His arrest was the result of an exhaustive and well coordinated investigation by the FBI&#x27;s Washington Field Office, the FBI legal attaché, and special agents of the Diplomatic Security Service assigned to the U.S. Embassy in Managua.

In May of 2022, yoga instructor Kaitlin Armstrong fled the United States to Costa Rica. Accused of murdering cyclist Anna Moriah Wilson, Armstrong attempted to evade arrest by hiding in Santa Teresa, a small Costa Rican town popular with surfers and yoga enthusiasts. DSS investigators conducted an exhaustive search for Armstrong, eventually locating her. Costa Rican tourist officials arrested Armstrong. Two U.S. Marshals flew into Costa Rica to assist with the final elements of the investigation, and to help return her to the United States. In November of 2023, Texas jury sentenced Armstrong to 90 years in federal prison for the murder of Wilson.

== Overseas mission ==

=== Regional Security Officer (RSO) ===

The DSS presence overseas is led at each embassy and consulate by a DSS special agent known as a regional security officer (RSO), who is in charge of the Regional Security Office, and serves as the senior law enforcement advisor and security attaché to the U.S. ambassador.

Like all members of the Foreign Service, DSS agents cannot remain posted in the U.S. for more than six consecutive years and must eventually be assigned to an overseas post. Once assigned overseas, a DSS agent will typically serve first as a special agent called an assistant regional security officer (ARSO) in a regional security office. Agents who enjoy the overseas lifestyle will try to get a second tour in a special agent slot at a large embassy, or possibly serve as a regional security officer (RSO) at a small post or as a deputy regional security officer (DRSO) at a medium-sized post. Usually after two back-to-back overseas tours, agents will be encouraged to return to the U.S. and serve in a headquarters position before returning overseas as a regional security officer.

DSS has many special agents who serve as overseas criminal investigators (OCIs). These agents work out of the consular sections of embassies and consulates instead of the regional security offices.

It is possible at larger overseas missions with multiple diplomatic facilities located in the same country to have multiple agents with the regional security officer title. India, for example, has an RSO position at the embassy at the Senior Foreign Service level and four other RSOs at the consulates at the significantly lower grade 3 level yet all of these agents have the same job title. Sometimes the title senior regional security officer will be used to help prevent confusion or to indicate that the agent is the most senior in the country.

There are several other overseas positions filled by DSS agents. At new building construction sites, agents will serve as the site security manager (SSM) where they will supervise the overall security of the new building including the construction security technicians (CST) and cleared American guards (CAG). For construction at posts where there is a critical counterintelligence (CI) threat, agents will also serve as CI investigators dedicated to preventing compromise of the most sensitive spaces within the new embassy.

It is common for domestically assigned DSS agents to serve temporary duty (TDY) at embassies overseas. Such duty can range from various types of protection duties to RSO support or security training for an overseas post, and may last for as little as a few days to multiple months. Likewise, hundreds of DSS agents assigned overseas travel to New York on TDY to support the United Nations General Assembly every year.

DSS agents have often found themselves in harm&#x27;s way, with four agents and more than a hundred others dying in the line of duty as of April of 2024. The vast majority of DSS casualties had taken place within the five years in Iraq, where DSS continued to conduct its most critical and dangerous protective missions.

==== Overseas Criminal Investigations Division ====
The Overseas Criminal Investigations Division manages all DSS investigative forces abroad, namely overseas criminal investigators, DSS special agents responsible for ensuring the integrity of the U.S. passport and visa system. Embedded in 120 diplomatic posts across 85 countries, there are roughly 130 OCIs who conduct criminal investigations and work with foreign governments to build a global law enforcement network; they maintain formal partnerships and training programs with foreign police, immigration, and customs officials to target a wide range of criminals, including forgers, smugglers, and terrorists. The division&#x27;s prevailing goal is to &quot;combat crime where it originates rather than waiting for it to cross U.S. borders.&quot; OCIs have locally employed staff, called criminal fraud investigators and foreign service national investigators, to assist with investigations, locating fugitives, and liaising with host nation counterparts.

With its global partners, OCIs help locate and return an average of 300 fugitives to the U.S. annually; missions have included dismantling major human smuggling networks, identifying criminals involved in child exploitation and pornography, ending international scams, and disrupting suspected terrorist travel.

== Special event security ==
In addition to being posted at U.S. missions around the world, DSS agents have worked closely with their foreign counterparts to secure such events as the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, the 2007 Pan American Games in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, 2006 Winter Olympic Games in Turin, Italy; the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, Canada, 2010 World Cup Football Matches and a host of other special events. While the Olympics are the most well-known events, DSS agents have worked with host country security on numerous other large-scale events around the world. For events with a large U.S. presence, such as the Olympics, an Olympic Security Coordinator – always a DSS agent – will be named to manage all of the security and liaison with the host government. All other federal agencies, such as the FBI, ATF, USSS, and DOD components, will report to the DSS agent in charge.

== Hiring process ==
The DSS special agent hiring process is widely regarded as one of the most difficult and challenging within both the federal government and general law enforcement. It is believed that less than 1% of applicants successfully complete and pass the hiring process. Special agent candidates must successfully pass an intensive multi-stage evaluation process that includes a series of written exams, knowledge-based exams, writing samples, panel interviews, and situational judgment exercises; a physical fitness test (PFT); a comprehensive medical examination granting worldwide availability; and an exhaustive background investigation for security clearance at the level of Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI). A final suitability review and vote by a Foreign Service panel evaluates a candidate&#x27;s overall ability to represent the interests of the United States abroad.

All DSS special agents have at least a four-year bachelor&#x27;s degree, and most have graduate and/or post-graduate degrees. Special Agent candidates must be under the age of 37 at the time of commissioning, unless granted a waiver due to prior military service.

== Training ==
After a new agent candidate is hired, he or she begins a nearly nine-month training program that includes the Criminal Investigator Training Program (CITP) at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security&#x27;s Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) in Glynco, Georgia; a Basic Special Agent Course (BSAC) at the Diplomatic Security Training Center (DSTC) and Foreign Affairs Security Training Center (FASTC), and courses at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI) in Arlington, Virginia. After completion of all initial training, agents are required to pass quarterly re-qualifications on their duty weapons, which include the Glock 19M, Glock 26, Colt Sub Machine Gun, the Mk18 rifle, and Remington 870 shotgun. A new special agent is assigned to a domestic field office for two to three years before typically taking on an overseas assignment, although an agent can expect to be sent on frequent temporary duty assignments overseas even when assigned to a domestic post. However, agents may be called overseas much earlier depending on the needs of DSS. As members of the Foreign Service, DSS special agents spend nearly half of their careers living and working overseas, often in hazardous environments and/or less developed countries throughout the world.
* Basic Special Agent Course (BSAC) (including FLETC): 9 months
* Basic Regional Security Office Course (RSO School): 3 months
* Advanced Tactics and Leadership (ATLaS): 11 weeks
* Language Training: 2–12 months per language
* Basic Field Firearms Officer Course (BFFOC): 2 weeks
* High Risk Environment Firearms Course (HREFC): 3 days

== Weapons ==

When assigned to the United States special agents are authorized to carry firearms both on and off duty and when assigned overseas are authorized to carry firearms when approved by the chief of mission.

Standard issue: 
*Glock 19M (9mm pistol – primary)
*Glock 26 Gen 4 (9mm pistol – secondary &amp; off-duty)
* Remington 870 shotgun (12 gauge shotgun)
* Colt M4 / Mk 18 rifle (5.56mm carbine)

Former weapons included the SIG P228 (9mm pistol), SIG P229 (9mm pistol), Uzi submachine gun, the Ruger Mini-14 carbine, and the Colt SMG (9mm submachine gun). Stockless or &quot;shorty&quot; versions of the Remington 870 shotgun may still be found in some DSS offices. DSS agents were issued the Smith &amp; Wesson Model 19 revolver (.357 Magnum caliber), but switched to 9mm pistols around 1993.

Additional issue:
* Glock 19 (9mm pistol)
* Heckler &amp; Koch MP5 (9mm submachine gun)
* Mk 18 Mod 0 (5.56mm carbine)
* M249 light machine gun (5.56mm SAW)
* M240 machine gun (7.62mm general-purpose machine gun)
* M203 grenade launcher (40 mm grenade launcher)
* M2 Browning (.50 heavy machine gun)

These and other weapons systems may be employed by DSS special agents assigned to high-threat locations. The agents going to those locations attend additional training (ATLaS/HTOC) in these weapons before they are deployed.

<text>USS &quot;Hampton&quot; (SSN-767), a , is the fourth ship of the United States Navy to bear this name. The earlier &quot;Hampton&quot;s were given their names for varying reasons, but SSN-767 was specifically named for four cities: Hampton, Virginia; Hampton, Iowa; Hampton, South Carolina; and Hampton, New Hampshire. There are at least 20 communities named &quot;Hampton&quot; (including cities, towns, and unincorporated communities) in the United States.

==History==
The contract to build the &quot;Hampton&quot; was awarded to the Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia (adjacent to the aforementioned Hampton, Virginia) on 6 February 1987, and her keel was laid down on 2 March 1990. She was launched on 3 April 1992, sponsored by Mrs. Laura Bateman, wife of U.S. Representative Herb Bateman, and she was commissioned on 6 November 1993, with Commander David Antanitus in command.

In late April 2004 &quot;Hampton&quot; along with surfaced through the ice together at the North Pole.

In February 2007, &quot;Hampton&quot; left Naval Station Norfolk for a seven-month Western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment. She traveled through the Panama Canal and arrived in Yokosuka, Japan. She completed two missions of national importance, and participated in two major, multinational naval exercises. She made port visits in Apra Harbor, Guam, White Beach, Okinawa, and Brisbane, Australia, as well as a brief stop in Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, before arriving in San Diego. She earned the Navy Expeditionary Medal during this time.

On 17 September 2007, the &quot;Hampton&#x27;s&quot; homeport was changed from Naval Station Norfolk to Naval Base Point Loma of San Diego, in a change from the Atlantic Fleet to the Pacific Fleet.

&quot;Hampton&quot; completed a Western Pacific deployment from 17 October 2008 to 17 April 2009. She made port visits to Singapore, Yokosuka, Japan, Saipan, and Apra Harbor, Guam, before returning to home port in San Diego. She participated in the first submarine exercise between the United States and the Singapore Navy.

In 2010 and 2011, the &quot;Hampton&quot; won the Submarine Squadron 11 Battle Efficiency award. On 15 May 2011, the submarine visited Hong Kong.

From March through October 2014, under the command of Commander Lincoln Reifsteck, &quot;Hampton&quot; traveled on deployment while visiting Okinawa, Japan; Yokosuka, Japan; Sasebo, Japan; and Guam.

On 21 November 2024, under the command of Commander Grant Wanier, &quot;Hampton&quot; arrived at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard for &quot;system upgrades and scheduled maintenance work.&quot;

===Falsified records incident===
In October 2007, six naval personnel were disciplined after they &quot;neither maintained inspection records nor conducted the required inspection of the chemical levels associated with the cooling system&quot; of the nuclear propulsion plant of the &quot;Hampton&quot;. Shortly thereafter, the ship&#x27;s commanding officer, Commander Michael B. Portland, was relieved of his command due to a loss of confidence in his leadership; at the time, he was not charged with any offense.

In March 2008, the US Navy revealed that a total of 11 officers and enlisted men had been disciplined in connection with the fraudulent documentation and for cheating on qualification tests. In addition to the captain, the submarine&#x27;s engineer officer, the engineering department master chief petty officer, and the entire reactor laboratory division were dismissed from Naval nuclear plant duty and submarine service. No damage was discovered in the reactor core and the submarine returned to operational status.

<doc id="1089982" wikidata="Q477390" url="?curid=1089982" title="Hyperinsulinism">
<text>Hyperinsulinism refers to an above normal level of insulin in the blood of a person or animal. Normal insulin secretion and blood levels are closely related to the level of glucose in the blood, so that a given level of insulin can be normal for one blood glucose level but low or high for another. Hyperinsulinism can be associated with several types of medical problems, which can be roughly divided into two broad and largely non-overlapping categories: those tending toward reduced sensitivity to insulin and high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia), and those tending toward excessive insulin secretion and low glucose levels (hypoglycemia).

==Signs and symptoms==
Hyperinsulinism due to reduced insulin sensitivity is usually asymptomatic. In contrast, hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia can produce any of the entire range of hypoglycemic symptoms, from shakiness and weakness, to seizures or coma.

==Diagnosis==
===Diminished sensitivity, associated with diabetes risk===
Although many factors influence insulin secretion, the most important control is the amount of glucose moving from the blood into the beta cells of the pancreas. In healthy people, even small rises in blood glucose result in increased insulin secretion. As long as the pancreatic beta cells are able to sense the glucose level and produce insulin, the amount of insulin secreted is usually the amount required to maintain a fasting blood glucose between 70 and 100 mg/dL (3.9–5.6 mmol/L) and a non-fasting glucose level below 140 mg/dL (&lt;7.8 mmol/L).

When liver cells and other cells that remove glucose from the blood become less sensitive (more resistant) to the insulin, the pancreas increases secretion and the level of insulin in the blood rises. This increased secretion can compensate for reduced sensitivity for many years, with maintenance of normal glucose levels. However, if insulin resistance worsens or insulin secretion ability declines, the glucose levels will begin to rise. Persistent elevation of glucose levels is termed diabetes mellitus.

Typical fasting insulin levels found in this type of hyperinsulinism are above 20 μU/mL. When resistance is severe, levels can exceed 100 μU/mL.

In addition to being a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, hyperinsulinism due to insulin resistance may increase blood pressure and contribute to hypertension by direct action on vascular endothelial cells (the cells lining blood vessels). Hyperinsulinism has also been implicated as a contributing factor in the excessive production of androgens in polycystic ovary syndrome.

The principal treatments of hyperinsulinism due to insulin resistance are measures that improve insulin sensitivity, such as weight loss, physical exercise, and drugs such as thiazolidinediones or metformin.

===Inappropriate secretion, associated with hypoglycemia===
Hyperinsulinism may also refer to forms of hypoglycemia caused by excessive insulin secretion. In normal children and adults, insulin secretion should be minimal when blood glucose levels fall below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mM). There are many forms of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia caused by various types of insulin excess. Some of those that occur in infants and young children are termed congenital hyperinsulinism. In adults, severe hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia is often due to an insulinoma, an insulin-secreting tumor of the pancreas.

Insulin levels above 3 μU/mL are inappropriate when the glucose level is below 50 mg/dL (2.8 mM), and may indicate hyperinsulinism as the cause of the hypoglycemia. The treatment of this form of hyperinsulinism depends on the cause and the severity of the hyperinsulinism, and may include surgical removal of the source of insulin, or a drug such as diazoxide or octreotide that reduces insulin secretion.

That spontaneous hyperinsulinism might be a cause of symptomatic hypoglycemia was first proposed by Seale Harris, MD, 1924, in &quot;Journal of the American Medical Association&quot;.
Dr. Seale Harris first diagnosed hyperinsulinism in 1924 and also is credited with the recognition of spontaneous hypoglycemia.

<doc id="1089989" wikidata="Q1840588" url="?curid=1089989" title="Bob Krueger">
<text>Robert Charles Krueger (September 19, 1935 – April 30, 2022) was an American diplomat, politician, and U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from Texas, a U.S. Ambassador, and a member of the Democratic Party. , he is the last Democrat to serve as a United States Senator from Texas.

==Early life and education==
Krueger was born in New Braunfels, Texas, the son of Faye (Leifeste) and Arlon E. Krueger. Krueger earned a B.A. from Southern Methodist University in 1957 and an M.A. from Duke University in 1958. He went to Merton College, Oxford, earning a D.Phil. in English literature with a thesis entitled &quot;The poems of William Herbert, Third Earl of Pembroke&quot;. He taught English literature as a professor and was later vice provost and Dean of the Trinity College of Arts and Sciences at Duke University. His edition of the poems of Sir John Davies was published by the Clarendon Press, Oxford, in 1975. Krueger held business positions as chairman of the board of Comal Hosiery Mills and managing partner of the Krueger Brangus Ranch before entering elective office.

==Career==
=== Politics ===
Krueger was elected to the 94th and 95th United States Congresses, serving from January 3, 1975, to January 3, 1979. Krueger was initially elected to the U.S. House of Representatives to represent , then the largest congressional district in Texas, stretching from northern San Antonio to Big Bend National Park in far west Texas. In the general election, Krueger defeated Republican Doug Harlan of San Antonio, who had also run unsuccessfully against the previous congressman from the district O.C. Fisher in 1972. Coincidentally, Harlan like Krueger had obtained a master&#x27;s degree from Duke University. He then received a law degree from the University of Texas School of Law and became heavily involved in Republican Party consulting work. Krueger was part of the large &quot;Watergate Class&quot; of 1974, many of whom were Democrats who owed their election to the scandal that brought the resignation of President Richard Nixon three months before the election. Krueger was reelected for a second House term in 1976 along with the election of Jimmy Carter as president. Krueger challenged incumbent Republican John Tower in 1978 for a U.S. Senate seat from Texas, but Krueger narrowly lost the contest by 0.3%.

In 1984, he ran again for the U.S. Senate. Tower decided to retire but Krueger lost in the Democratic primary, caught in the middle between the more liberal State Senator Lloyd Doggett and the more conservative U.S. Representative Kent Hance. In 2010, Krueger&#x27;s campaign was named by the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; as the ninth-worst in Texas&#x27; modern political history, saying: &quot;Caught in the middle, Krueger seemed like a bland centrist facing a fiery liberal and a folksy conservative. He ended up finishing third, out of the runoff and out of luck.&quot; From 1985 to 1989, he also wrote a regular column on a broad range of public affairs issues, which was carried in newspapers in San Antonio, Dallas, Houston, and Corpus Christi, Texas.

In 1990, Krueger returned to elective office in Texas, serving on the Texas Railroad Commission, which regulated oil and gas as well as the rail system in the state. In his candidacy, Krueger received the most votes of any contested candidate on the primary ballot of either major party and defeated his general election opponent by a 16 percent margin.

He was appointed by Governor Ann Richards in 1993 to the U.S. Senate to fill the vacancy caused by the resignation of four-term incumbent and 1988 Democratic vice presidential nominee Lloyd Bentsen, who became Secretary of the Treasury in President Clinton&#x27;s cabinet. He served from January 21, 1993, until June 14, 1993. He lost the June 1993 special election runoff for the remainder of the term ending January 3, 1995 by a 2-to-1 margin to the popular Texas State Treasurer, Republican Kay Bailey Hutchison. In 2010, Krueger&#x27;s campaign was named by the same &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; article as the single worst in Texas&#x27; modern political history. Reasons cited for the defeat included Krueger&#x27;s flip-flopping over don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell and also Bill Clinton&#x27;s proposed BTU tax, which was unpopular in Texas.

===Diplomacy===
On October 23, 1979, Krueger was appointed by President Carter as Ambassador-at-Large and Coordinator for Mexican Affairs at the U.S. Department of State and served the remainder of the Carter presidency until February 1, 1981.

President Bill Clinton named Krueger as Ambassador to Burundi, which had been beset with violence in recent years and whose ethnic make-up was the same as that of adjoining Rwanda, whose Hutu and Tutsi groups had started a bloody civil war only months before Krueger began his service in May 1994. His family was initially not allowed to join him in Burundi due to the threat of violence. He served in Burundi until 1995, when his convoy was ambushed in Cibitoke province. He was traveling on a bare highway in Cibitoke, when gunmen with AK-47s attacked the motorcade, before being diverted by Diplomatic Security Service agents Chris Reilly and Larry Salmon.

In 1996, he was appointed U.S. Ambassador to Botswana and concurrently Special Representative of the Secretary of State to the Southern African Development Community. He held those posts until 2000, when he became a visiting fellow at Merton College, Oxford, and began to write a memoir of his time in central Africa. It was published as &quot;From Bloodshed to Hope in Burundi: Our Embassy Years during Genocide&quot; by the University of Texas Press in September 2007.

===Later work===

Krueger served in several academic lectureship positions at the University of North Texas (then known as North Texas State University), the University of Texas at Austin, Rice University, Southern Methodist University, Texas State University, and Texas Tech University, following his service in federal government. He delivered the Inaugural Distinguished Lecture of the Rutgers Council on Public and International Affairs on December 9, 2014.

==Personal life==
Krueger was married to the former Kathleen Tobin of Bandera, Texas, who co-authored the book &quot;From Bloodshed to Hope in Burundi&quot;, and served two terms as a City Council Member in New Braunfels, Texas, and as Mayor Pro-tem. The Kruegers had three children. In the late 1980s, Krueger and his family were the victims of a stalker. Their experience led to the passage of a spate of anti-stalking laws in Texas.

Krueger died on April 30, 2022, at the age of 86, from congestive heart failure.

<text>USS &quot;Albany&quot; (SSN-753) is a , the fifth ship of the United States Navy to be named for Albany, New York. The contract to build her was awarded to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company in Newport News, Virginia, on 29 November 1983 and her keel was laid down on 22 April 1985. She was launched on 13 June 1987 sponsored by Nancy M. Kissinger, wife of Henry Kissinger, and was commissioned on 7 April 1990 with Commander Darl R. Anderson in command.

&quot;Albany&quot; was the last US submarine built via the traditional &quot;keel up&quot; ship construction method. Thus, it was the last submarine to &quot;launch&quot; down the shipway.

&quot;Albany&quot; and , differ from other members of the &quot;Los Angeles&quot; class as their pressure hulls were partially manufactured using stronger HY-100 steel rather than the HY-80 steel used in the manufacturing of all other &quot;Los Angeles&quot;-class submarines. This was done to test construction methods using this steel, which would later be employed in the assembly of the new s.

On 30 July 2004 &quot;Albany&quot; returned to Norfolk, Virginia, after a six-month deployment that began in the Persian Gulf and Gulf of Oman, then proceeded to the Mediterranean Sea for a NATO exercise, Operation &quot;MEDSHARK/Majestic Eagle.&quot;

On 14 May 2022 &quot;Albany&quot; returned to Norfolk after a six-month deployment.

<text>USS &quot;Paddle&quot; (SS-263), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the paddlefish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Paddle&quot; was laid down on 1 May 1942 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut; launched on 30 December 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Goldye S. Fechteler, wife of later Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William M. Fechteler; and commissioned at Naval Submarine Base New London in New London, Connecticut, on 29 March 1943.

==Service history==

===United States Navy===
After trials and training, &quot;Paddle&quot; left New London on 8 June 1943 for the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, arriving on 5 July. She was based at Pearl Harbor during her first two war patrols, between which she trained destroyers in antisubmarine warfare and received meteorological equipment.

&quot;Paddle&quot;″s first patrol, from 20 July to 12 September 1943, was conducted south of Japan. She scored a hit on a large freighter in her first attack on 13 August, but alert escorts forced her down with a 13-hour depth charge attack. Enemy search planes damaged her slightly on 19 August with 7 bombs dropped as she patrolled submerged off the coast of Japan, but she repaired damage quickly and struck back, sinking &quot;Ataka Maru&quot; on 23 August.

During her second war patrol, from 17 October–9 November, &quot;Paddle&quot; took station off Nauru to provide continuous weather reporting for the carrier task force attacking the Gilbert and Marshall Islands to cover the Tarawa landings. She also guided, by radio, Army bombers in to raid Tarawa and attacked &quot;Nippon Maru&quot; off Eniwetok, though escorting destroyers forced her down before she could observe the damage inflicted on the tanker.

After United States West Coast overhaul, &quot;Paddle&quot; sailed for her third war patrol from Pearl Harbor on 19 March 1944, bound for the Dutch East Indies and the southern Philippines. In a brilliant night attack on 16 April, she sank two of a three-ship convoy guarded by four escorts, torpedoing &quot;Mito Maru&quot; and &quot;Hino Maru No. 1&quot;. Breaking off to reload her tubes, &quot;Paddle&quot; returned to attack a tanker, which had joined the group, and engaged escorting destroyers and aircraft. She ended her patrol at Fremantle, Australia on 12 May.

&quot;Paddle&quot;″s fourth war patrol, from 5 June–29 July, began with reconnaissance of the eastern approaches to Davao Gulf guarding against a Japanese sortie during the U.S. landings on Saipan. Damaged by bombs in the Celebes Sea on 30 June, &quot;Paddle&quot; repaired quickly and on 6 July attacked a small convoy, twice hitting a large freighter, and sinking before being forced down by other escorts.

After refit at Fremantle, &quot;Paddle&quot; made her fifth patrol, from 22 August–25 September, encountering few contacts in her assigned area in the Sulu Sea. On 7 September, attacked and destroyed the &quot;Shinyo Maru&quot; and damaged another of her convoy. &quot;Shinyo Maru&quot;, unmarked as a prisoner of war carrier and unknown to &quot;Paddle&quot;, was carrying over 750 Allied POWs from the Philippine Islands to Manila when sunk by &quot;Paddle&quot;. The Japanese crew and patrol boats killed all but 83 of &quot;Shinyo Maru&quot;″s POWs before they could reach shore. One survivor died on shore, one elected to remain in the Philippines and 81 returned home.

She returned to Mios Woendi Lagoon on 25 September 1944 and then prepared for her next patrol, sailing on 3 October for her sixth patrol, engaged in search and rescue duty in the waters off Balikpapan. During brief offensive periods, she sank two oil-laden sea trucks and a schooner by gunfire, then returned to Fremantle on 1 November.

Her seventh war patrol began at Fremantle 25 November and ended at Pearl Harbor on 18 January 1945. Operating mainly in the South China Sea and west of Luzon, &quot;Paddle&quot; fought through heavy weather to join in sinking &quot;Shoei Maru&quot; and damaging an enemy destroyer.

After overhaul at San Francisco, &quot;Paddle&quot; trained at Pearl Harbor whence she sailed on her 8th and last war patrol on 15 May. Prowling the Yellow and East China Seas, she found few substantial targets; by this time submarine attacks had almost annihilated the Japanese merchant marine. She turned her attention to sinking floating mines with gunfire, and sank eight schooners and picket boats.

Returning to Guam 18 July, &quot;Paddle&quot; sailed on 13 August for lifeguard duty off southern Honshū. With the war&#x27;s end, she sailed for Midway Atoll on 17 August. The long voyage home ended at Staten Island on 30 September.

===Brazilian Navy===

Placed in reserve at New London, &quot;Paddle&quot; decommissioned on 1 February 1946. She recommissioned on 31 August 1956 to prepare for transfer to Brazil under the Mutual Defense Assistance Program. Decommissioned and transferred on 18 January 1957, she was simultaneously commissioned in the Brazilian Navy as &quot;Riachuelo&quot; (S-15). &quot;Riachuelo&quot; was stricken in March 1968 and sunk as a target around 30 June 1968.

==Awards==
&quot;Paddle&quot; received eight battle stars for World War II service. Her first seven war patrols were designated &quot;successful.&quot;

<text>The Beta C-Mag is a 100-round capacity drum magazine manufactured by the Beta Company. It was designed by Jim Sullivan and first patented in 1987 and has been adapted for use in numerous firearms firing the 5.56×45mm NATO, 7.62×51mm NATO, and 9×19mm Parabellum cartridges. &quot;C-Mag&quot; is short for &quot;century magazine&quot; (The letter C is also the Roman numeral for the number 100), referring to its 100-round capacity. It has two drum units, each of which hold half of the cartridges inserted into the magazine. The latest version of the magazine is available with a transparent backing to allow the user to see the number of rounds remaining in the magazine. A C-Mag loaded with 5.56×45mm NATO ammunition typically weighs about ; a C-Mag loaded with 7.62×51mm NATO ammunition weighs .

A version adapted for the M16 rifle is used by the U.S. military. The magazine design, including drawings, is covered in detail in .

==Design==
The C-Mag is a compact twin-drum magazine design that accepts up to 100 rounds of ammunition. It consists of two main components: the twin-drum storage housing and an interchangeable feed clip assembly. The storage housing is standard and fits any like-caliber weapon. The feed clip assembly serves as an adapter for the specific weapon.

Before loading and after firing, the feed clip is filled with spacer rounds that are an integral part of the magazine. The upper half of the top spacer round is tapered to allow the weapon bolt to close after the last round is fired. The length of the string-set depends on the customized feed clip for the individual weapon.

During loading, cartridges are inserted on top of the spacer rounds, through the feed clip and into the drums. The cartridge column splits at the juncture of the feed clip and the housing to distribute the ammunition evenly into the drums in two concentric rows.

During firing, spring-driven rotors advance the cartridges in both drums until they meet at a cam blade that merges the cartridges into a single column that feeds up through the feed clip and into the weapon.

==Performance evaluations==

===Reliability===
A test in 2003 by U.S. Army soldiers in Afghanistan found the C-Mag unreliable in simulated combat conditions and reported frequent failures to feed among the issues; likewise, British Armed Forces trials found that the C-Mag did not give reliable performance when loaded with British-issue ammunition. The Beta C-Mag is not in widespread use by U.S. military forces, and has not been type-classified.

In November 2008, the U.S. Army Experimental Task Force (AETF) at Fort Bliss, Texas, evaluated six Beta C-Mag magazines. Four magazines—two with black covers and two with clear covers—were used with M4 carbines in three firing scenarios: controlled pair, controlled burst, and rapid fire. According to the memorandum summarizing the evaluation, the four magazines &quot;performed flawlessly in all three scenarios without jams or stoppages&quot;. Additionally, two magazines with black covers were evaluated with M249 light machine guns in controlled burst and rapid-fire scenarios. These also performed without &quot;issues&quot;, according to the memo, which also notes that soldiers &quot;had only positive comments&quot; about the C-Mag magazines during the After Action Review (AAR).

Test-fired with a Heckler &amp; Koch HK91, Heckler &amp; Koch G3 and two other Heckler &amp; Koch-based weapons, the 7.62mm C-Mag was found to operate without problems in either loading or firing at rates up to 1,000 rounds per minute.

<text>National Institute of Technology Karnataka (NITK), also known as NITK Surathkal, formerly known as Karnataka Regional Engineering College (KREC), is a public technical university at Surathkal, Mangaluru. It was founded in 1960 as KREC while today, it is one of the 31 National Institutes of Technology in India and is recognised as an Institute of National Importance by the Government of India. It has a suburban campus, in close proximity to the Arabian Sea. National Highway 66 runs through the campus and serves as the major mode of access.

== History ==
The foundation stone for Karnataka Regional Engineering College (KREC) was laid on 6 August 1960, at Surathkal. It was made possible through the efforts of U. Srinivas Mallya and V. S. Kudva and the area is now called Srinivasnagar in his honour. KREC began with three under-graduate courses in engineering: Mechanical, Electrical, and Civil, with affiliation to the University of Mysore. 1965 saw the beginning of under-graduate courses in Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering. In 1966, the college started its first postgraduate course in Marine Structures and Industrial Structures, followed by post-graduate courses in Industrial Electronics (1969), Heat Power (1971), Hydraulics and Water Resources (1971), Chemical Plant Design Engineering (1971) and Process Metallurgy (1972).

More under-graduate engineering courses were added later: Electronics and Communication Engineering (1971), Mining Engineering (1984), Computer Engineering (1986), Information Technology Engineering (2000) and Artificial Intelligence Engineering (2021). In 1980, KREC came under the affiliation of Mangalore University, and the five-year under-graduate courses were shortened to four-years. On 26 June 2002, it was elevated to the status of a National Institute of Technology and has been called NIT Karnataka (NITK) ever since. It is now a Deemed University. NITK celebrated its 50th Institute Foundation day on 6 August 2009. The year-long Golden Jubilee celebrations were inaugurated on 10 August 2009.

== Academics ==

NITK Surathkal offers undergraduate and graduate programs in Engineering, Science and Management. The institute has 14 departments and 11 support centres with about 200 faculty members, 300 support staff, 5,500 students and 26,500 alumni worldwide.

=== Admissions ===
;Undergraduate programs:

The B. Tech admissions are based on the JEE (Joint Entrance Exam). The exam consists of three sections on Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry. From the 2013 academic year onwards, admission is through the JEE (Mains) test, and ranks are based on 60% of the marks scored in the test, and 40% in the class 12/Second PU Board exams. From 2017, admission is through the ranks based solely on the JEE (mains) test; the marks in the class 12 board exams serves as a cut off. 
Undergraduate admissions were based on a state wise reciprocal system. 50% of the seats were reserved for students from the home state of Karnataka. Until 2007, the rest of the 50% was distributed over other NITs, with each state having a fixed quota of seats. However, since the batch starting in 2008, the remaining 50% has been made open to all other states.

10% of the seats in the undergraduate class are reserved for foreign students under the Direct Admission of Student Abroad (DASA) scheme. Admissions are based on the JEE (Joint Entrance Exam).

;Postgraduate programs:
Postgraduate students are admitted to the program through the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE) conducted by the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institute of Science (IISc). Postgraduate students are required to complete coursework in addition to a thesis or dissertation that entails independent research under the guidance of a faculty. Postgraduate and doctoral Ph.D. students are also involved as teaching assistants for undergraduate courses. An MBA course has been recently introduced by the Humanities department. NITK also offers MCA (Master of Computer Application) course for graduate students in which admission is done on the based on NIMCET (NIT MCA Common Entrance Test). NITK from 2003 is offering Doctor of Philosophy Ph.D. program for Mtech and other post graduate students.

===Rankings===

NITK was ranked 16th among engineering colleges in India by &quot;India Today&quot; in 2020 and among government engineering colleges by &quot;Outlook India&quot; in 2022. It was ranked 17th among engineering colleges by the National Institutional Ranking Framework (NIRF) in 2024.

== Research ==
Research in the institute is mainly sponsored by central and state government agencies with grants for the academic year reaching . Faculty go on sabbaticals at foreign universities to encourage research and teaching interactions. Consulting activities are also conducted through the industry-institute partnership cell.

In January 2020, Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) and NITK have signed an MoU to jointly set up a &#x27;Regional Academic Centre for Space&#x27;.This centre will act as a facilitator for the promotion of space technology activities in the southern India and carry out advanced joint research and development activities in the area of space technology applications. The centre will pursue advanced research in the areas relevant to the future technological and programmatic needs of the Indian space programme.

== Student life ==

Being primarily a residential institution along with Surathkal beach less than a kilometre (0.62 mi) away, a unique culture has developed over the 50 years of NITK&#x27;s existence. Since 2002 when it became a centrally funded institution, NITK has opened doors to students from all over the country. Students involve in technical activities, as well as cultural events supported by one of the many student-run clubs and organizations on campus. An open-air theatre called Student Activity Center is the venue for most of the music performances and movie screenings. Beach events are unique to NITK, with sand sculptures and kite flying being recent highlights.

Engineer (a national level technical symposium) takes place typically around the last week of October and Incident (a cultural festival) is organized since 1980 during the last week of February. Over the years, the scale of these events has gradually expanded with students visiting from all over the country. Online technical events at Engineer see participation from all over the world. The biggest intra-college event is called Crescendo, organised by the Reading Room Committee. Students teams representing the year of their study compete in literary, personality, art and music competitions. The college has numerous clubs, which have a presence both in India and abroad. It also has clubs like IEEE (Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers), ISTE (Indian Society for Technical Education) and ACM (Association of Computer Machinery), which are included in the syllabus as well for better understanding. These clubs help inculcate interest in technical research among NITKians. There are non-technical clubs like Rotaract (affiliated to the Rotary International), which help create social awareness and initiate campus drives.

=== Incident ===
Incident is the institute&#x27;s annual cultural festival. Incident was first conducted in 1980. Held over four days, the festival includes events from dance and dramatics to music, painting, fashion and quizzing. In addition, Incident Pro-Nite features top Indian singers and bands. International bands have also been part of the experience since 2010, with tribute bands like Led Zepplica, Breathe the Floyd Sound and Jailbreak performing crowd favourites to an enthralled audience. Some of the recent performances includes the likes of Vishal-Shekhar, Local Train, Amaal Malik, Kenny Sebastian, Rahul Subrahmanian, Raghu Dixit, Salim Sulaiman and many other celebrities.

=== Engineer ===
&#x27;Engineer&#x27; is the annual technical symposium at NITK Surathkal. &#x27;ENGI&#x27; as it is called by the students has the Penrose Triangle as its logo, and this theme has been used along with the tag-line, &#x27;Think. Create. Engineer.&#x27; ‘Engineer’ in its first edition in 2005 was born out of the amalgamation of three smaller scale technical symposia held until then. Engineer 2006 was planned on a larger scale, with innovative events including paper presentations, Shrishti, where participants are required to apply engineering for the greater good of society, robotics events (Perfect Machine, Automata), hacking contests, programming contests, electronics design events, and workshops.

Sports facilities include the cricket ground, tennis lawns, badminton and table tennis complex, the basketball and volleyball courts along with a swimming pool.

The Recreation Committee (RC) of the institute organizes recreational activities including freshers cup, floodlit cricket matches. The much-awaited inter-year sports festival &#x27;Phoenix&#x27; is organized during the even semester where students battle for gold, silver and bronze medals, and the overall shield. NITK sports teams participate in events all over the country as part of the Inter-NIT sports meet.

During the cultural festival &#x27;Incident&#x27;, NITK hosts &#x27;Slam Dunk&#x27;, an intercollegiate basketball tournament.

===Entrepreneurship culture and NITK STEP===
The institute has its own technology startup incubator named STEP (Science &amp; Technology Entrepreneurs Park) which provides office space and in some cases seed funds to startups incubated there. NITK–STEP (formerly KREC-STEP) was first established on 31 August 1994.

Some notable startups founded by recently graduated alumni of NITK Surathkal are Practo, Delhivery, Nestaway, DriveU, Taxi For Sure, Chai Point, Simplilearn, BHIVE, Travelyaari, Pinkvilla. Practo is one of the startups conceived within NITK Campus and is now valued at half a billion dollars.
Many NITK alumni are actively involved as Partners in Venture Capital firms like Clear Ventures, New Enterprise Associates, Peepul Capital, Benhamou Global Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Unitus Seed Fund.

<doc id="1090005" wikidata="Q1020789" url="?curid=1090005" title="Creel, Chihuahua">
<text>Creel () is a town in the Sierra Tarahumara (part of the Sierra Madre Occidental) of the Mexican state of Chihuahua. It is the second-largest town (after San Juanito) in the municipality of Bocoyna. It is located some to the southwest of the state capital, Chihuahua City. At the census of 2010, it had a population of 5,026, down from 5,338 as of 2005. It is notable for being inhabited mostly by Native Americans of the Rarámuri ethnic group, and the use of their native language is widespread in the population in daily life and public events such as church masses.

Creel was historically a logging town, although tourism has become the primary job source over the last 20 years because it is close to the Copper Canyon as well as Basaseachic Falls, one of the highest waterfalls in Mexico. There are many hotels, restaurants and a number of tours down into the canyons and throughout the surrounding area.

== History ==
Creel was founded with the name &#x27;Estación Creel&#x27; on May 26, 1907, as a railroad depot on the Chihuahua–Pacific line. It was named after Enrique Creel governor of Chihuahua state at the time. He was the son of Reuben W. Creel, American delegate in Chihuahua. Creel was founded as a planned agricultural settlement that was intended to have a small number of Mexicans who were supposed to spread their culture onto the Rarámuri, who were supposed to be the majority of the population. It was supposed to have 25 Mexican and 75 Rarámuri families, but in its early years had only about 30 Rarámuri families although the right number of Mexicans.

For many years before its completion the Ferrocarril Chihuahua al Pacífico line ended at Creel.

==Climate==
Creel&#x27;s high altitude gives it a cool subtropical highland climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cwb&quot;), characterised by mild days and cold nights with frost occurring most mornings from October to April, though daytime temperatures in those months remain comfortable. Precipitation during the winter is not infrequent, but snowfalls are not particularly common, occurring on average only four days per year (more frequently on the nearby mountain peaks).
== Transport ==

The Chihuahua al Pacífico (Chepe) railroad runs from the city of Chihuahua to Los Mochis with four passenger trains arriving daily - two from each direction. There is also bus service to Chihuahua, as well as regular service down to the small town of Batopilas, a trip that takes about five hours each way.

<doc id="1090006" wikidata="Q5535526" url="?curid=1090006" title="Geometry pipelines">
<text>Geometric manipulation of modelling primitives, such as that performed by a geometry pipeline, is the first stage in computer graphics systems which perform image generation based on geometric models. While geometry pipelines were originally implemented in software, they have become highly amenable to hardware implementation, particularly since the advent of very-large-scale integration (VLSI) in the early 1980s. A device called the Geometry Engine developed by Jim Clark and Marc Hannah at Stanford University in about 1981 was the watershed for what has since become an increasingly commoditized function in contemporary image-synthetic raster display systems.

Geometric transformations are applied to the vertices of polygons, or other geometric objects used as modelling primitives, as part of the first stage in a classical geometry-based graphic image rendering pipeline. Geometric computations may also be applied to transform polygon or repair surface normals, and then to perform the lighting and shading computations used in their subsequent rendering.

==History==

Hardware implementations of the geometry pipeline were introduced in the early Evans &amp; Sutherland Picture System, but perhaps received broader recognition when later applied in the broad range of graphics systems products introduced by Silicon Graphics (SGI). Initially the SGI geometry hardware performed simple model space to screen space viewing transformations with all the lighting and shading handled by a separate hardware implementation stage. In later, much higher performance applications, such as the RealityEngine, they began to be applied to perform part of the rendering support as well.

More recently, perhaps dating from the late 1990s, the hardware support required to perform the manipulation and rendering of quite complex scenes has become accessible to the consumer market. 
Companies such as Nvidia and AMD Graphics (formerly ATI) are two current leading representatives of hardware vendors in this space. The GeForce line of graphics cards from Nvidia was the first to support full OpenGL and Direct3D hardware geometry processing in the consumer PC market, while some earlier products such as Rendition Verite incorporated hardware geometry processing through proprietary programming interfaces. On the whole, earlier graphics accelerators by 3Dfx, Matrox and others relied on the CPU for geometry processing.

This subject matter is part of the technical foundation for modern computer graphics, and is a comprehensive topic taught at both the undergraduate and graduate levels as part of a computer science education.

<text>Das Ich is a German dark wave/gothic-industrial band formed in 1989. The group, fronted by Stefan Ackermann and Bruno Kramm, were one of the prominent founders of and contributors to &quot;Neue Deutsche Todeskunst&quot; (&quot;New German Death Art&quot;) a musical movement in the early 1990s. The band is known for having a classically-inspired gothic-industrial style, for their on-stage theatrics, and their almost exclusive use of German-language lyrics. The German term &quot;Das Ich&quot; makes reference to the Freudian concept James Strachey translated as &quot;ego&quot; ( &quot;The I&quot;).

==History==
Bruno Kramm and Stefan Ackermann met in Bayreuth, Germany in 1989 at a nightclub called the &quot;Crazy Elephant&quot;. Bruno had already been involved in several band projects, and after some hours of socializing the two decided to begin a project together.


In 1989, the members of Das Ich founded the Danse Macabre record label which released their first EP, &quot;Satanische Verse&quot;, and their first album, &quot;Die Propheten&quot;. &quot;Die Propheten&quot; was released in Germany in 1991 and was reissued in the US in 1997, selling over 30,000 copies. Their second album, &quot;Staub&quot;, was released in 1994 and charted in Germany for 11 weeks. 1994 also saw the release of the &quot;Stigma&quot; EP which featured a more industrial-dance sound with remixes of the album track &quot;Von der Armut.&quot; The band played many live shows in Europe but made its first US tour in June 1995 and a second, longer US tour of 13 shows, in 1997.

In 1998, the album &quot;Egodram&quot;, saw the group moving towards a more rhythmic, industrial dance-oriented sound, resulting in the club singles &quot;Kindgott&quot; and &quot;Destillat&quot;. The album was followed by a tour in 1998 in the US and Mexico. Later in 1998, the band released their next album, &quot;Morgue&quot;, a concept album with lyrics based on the poems of expressionist writer Gottfried Benn.

In 1999, they released a remix album, &quot;Re-Laborat&quot;, that included Das Ich songs remixed by popular electro-industrial bands including And One, Funker Vogt, Wumpscut, and VNV Nation. The album ranked #31 on the German Alternative Chart&#x27;s Top 50 Albums chart for 1999, while the U.S. re-issue peaked at #7 on the CMJ RPM Charts in 2001. Bruno Kramm released his solo spin-off &quot;Coeur&quot; in 2000. 

In 2002, Das Ich released the album &quot;Antichrist&quot;, which is a critical reflection on world politics post-9-11. In 2003, the best-of album &quot;Relikt&quot; was released.

In 2004, they released the double album &quot;Lava&quot;, made of:
&quot;Lava:Glut&quot;: Disc with more instrumental than industrial tracks.
&quot;Lava:Asche&quot;: Disc with dance versions of songs from &quot;Lava:Glut&quot;.
&quot;Lava:Addendum&quot;: Bonus DVD packaged with some versions of the release.

In 2006, they released an additional dual album:
&quot;Cabaret&quot;: Disc with circus style songs, like the name implies, and more instrumental.
&quot;Varieté&quot;: Disc with versions of songs from &quot;Cabaret&quot; remixed by bands including Stillste Stund, Metallspürunde, FabrikC, etc. In the same year, they released a new DVD, &quot;Panopticum&quot;.

After 2010, the band underwent a short hiatus due to the health problems suffered by lead singer Stefan Ackermann, but the band had a revival with their performance at the Wave-Gotik-Treffen in 2013.

In 2017, the band remastered and re-released their first EP, &quot;Satanische Verse&quot;, as a limited-edition (500 copies) vinyl with additional tracks.

In 2018, an announcement about creating new album appeared on official website, originally scheduled for release in 2017 or 2018, that has yet to be released.

In March 2023 the band announced a South American tour — the seventh of their career — beginning in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

<text>A creel is a wicker basket usually used for carrying fish or blocks of peat. It is also the fish trap used to catch lobsters and other crustaceans.

In modern times, the term has come to encompass various types of wicker baskets used by anglers or commercial fishermen to hold fish or other prey. The word is also associated with agriculture and some domestic baskets.

In the North Sea herring industry of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, the creel was a basket used to measure the volume of a catch. The standard measures were creel, which were made in officially approved volumes of one half and one quarter cran (another unit for measuring fresh herring).

An angler&#x27;s creel is designed to function as an evaporative cooler when lined with moss and dipped into the creek to keep the catch chilled. Caught fish are inserted through a slot in the top, held in place by a small leather strap.

Creels are also the high sides added to a towed trailer, making it more suitable for carrying loose materials such as turf.

== Etymology ==
According to the first edition of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Dictionary of the Older Scottish Tongue&quot;, the origin of the word is uncertain. However, the &quot;Middle English Dictionary&quot; asserts that it derives from Old French &quot;&quot;grëil&quot;, &quot;gräil&quot;, &quot;grëille&quot;, &quot;gräille&quot; a grill (from L[atin] &quot;cratīcula&quot;)&quot;.

== Creels in Scotland ==
The word &quot;creel&quot; is also used in Scotland to refer to a device used to catch lobsters and other crustaceans. Made of woven netting (similar to that used in traditional fishing net) over a frame of plastic tubing and a slatted wooden base, this type of creel is analogous in function to a lobster pot. Several creels put out on one line can be referred to as a &quot;leader&quot;.

<doc id="1090018" wikidata="Q211786" url="?curid=1090018" title="Newton's cradle">
<text>Newton&#x27;s cradle is a device, usually made of metal, that demonstrates the principles of conservation of momentum and conservation of energy in physics with swinging spheres. When one sphere at the end is lifted and released, it strikes the stationary spheres, compressing them and thereby transmitting a pressure wave through the stationary spheres, which creates a force that pushes the last sphere upward. The last sphere swings back and strikes the stationary spheres, repeating the effect in the opposite direction. The device is named after 17th-century English scientist Sir Isaac Newton and was designed by French scientist Edme Mariotte. It is also known as Newton&#x27;s pendulum, Newton&#x27;s balls, Newton&#x27;s rocker or executive ball clicker (since the device makes a click each time the balls collide, which they do repeatedly in a steady rhythm).

==Operation==

When one of the balls at the end (&quot;the first&quot;) is pulled sideways, the attached string constrains it along an upward arc. When released it strikes the second ball and comes nearly, but not entirely, to a dead stop. The succeeding ball acquires most of the velocity of the first ball propagates the diminished momentum. Eventually the last ball, having received a successively diminished portion of the first&#x27;s energy and momentum, begins the process anew in the opposite direction. Each impact produces a sonic wave that propagates through the medium of the intermediate balls. (Any efficiently elastic material such as steel suffices, as long as the kinetic energy is temporarily stored as potential energy in the compression of the material rather than being lost as heat. This is similar to bouncing one coin of a line of touching coins by striking it with another coin, and which happens even if the first struck coin is constrained by pressing on its center such that it cannot move.) In each phase of the process, efficient mechanical energy is lost; Newton&#x27;s cradle is not a perpetual motion machine. This would stand true even in the absence of air resistance, as in a vacuum. 

There are slight movements in all the balls after the initial strike, but the last ball receives most of the initial energy from the impact of the first ball. When two (or three) balls are dropped, the two (or three) balls on the opposite side swing out. Some say that this behavior demonstrates the conservation of momentum and kinetic energy in elastic collisions. However, if the colliding balls behave as described above with the same mass possessing the same velocity before and after the collisions, then any function of mass and velocity is conserved in such an event. Thus, this first-level explanation is a true, but incomplete, description of the motion.

==Physics explanation==


Newton&#x27;s cradle can be modeled fairly accurately with simple mathematical equations with the assumption that the balls always collide in pairs. If one ball strikes four stationary balls that are already touching, these simple equations can not explain the resulting movements in all five balls, which are not due to friction losses. For example, in a real Newton&#x27;s cradle the fourth has some movement and the first ball has a slight reverse movement. All the animations in this article show idealized action (simple solution) that only occurs if the balls are &quot;not&quot; touching initially and only collide in pairs.

===Simple solution===
The conservation of momentum and kinetic energy can be used to find the resulting velocities for two colliding perfectly elastic objects. These two equations are used to determine the resulting velocities of the two objects. For the case of two balls constrained to a straight path by the strings in the cradle, the velocities are a single number instead of a 3D vector for 3D space, so the math requires only two equations to solve for two unknowns. When the two objects have the same mass, the solution is simple: the moving object stops relative to the stationary one and the stationary one picks up all the other&#x27;s initial velocity. This assumes perfectly elastic objects, so there is no need to account for heat and sound energy losses.

Steel does not compress much, but its elasticity is very efficient, so it does not cause much waste heat. The simple effect from two same-mass efficiently elastic colliding objects constrained to a straight path is the basis of the effect seen in the cradle and gives an approximate solution to all its activities.

For a sequence of same-mass elastic objects constrained to a straight path, the effect continues to each successive object. For example, when two balls are dropped to strike three stationary balls in a cradle, there is an unnoticed but crucial small distance between the two dropped balls, and the action is as follows: the first moving ball that strikes the first stationary ball (the second ball striking the third ball) transfers all of its momentum to the third ball and stops. The third ball then transfers the momentum to the fourth ball and stops, and then the fourth to the fifth ball.

Right behind this sequence, the second moving ball is transferring its momentum to the first moving ball that just stopped, and the sequence repeats immediately and imperceptibly behind the first sequence, ejecting the fourth ball right behind the fifth ball with the same small separation that was between the two initial striking balls. If they are simply touching when they strike the third ball, precision requires the more complete solution below.

====Other examples of this effect====
The effect of the last ball ejecting with a velocity nearly equal to the first ball can be seen in sliding a coin on a table into a line of identical coins, as long as the striking coin and its twin targets are in a straight line. The effect can similarly be seen in billiard balls. The effect can also be seen when a sharp and strong pressure wave strikes a dense homogeneous material immersed in a less-dense medium. If the identical atoms, molecules, or larger-scale sub-volumes of the dense homogeneous material are at least partially elastically connected to each other by electrostatic forces, they can act as a sequence of colliding identical elastic balls. 

The surrounding atoms, molecules, or sub-volumes experiencing the pressure wave act to constrain each other similarly to how the string constrains the cradle&#x27;s balls to a straight line. As a medical example, lithotripsy shock waves can be sent through the skin and tissue without harm to burst kidney stones. The side of the stones opposite to the incoming pressure wave bursts, not the side receiving the initial strike. In the Indian game carrom, a striker stops after hitting a stationery playing piece, transferring all of its momentum into the piece that was hit.

====When the simple solution applies====
For the simple solution to precisely predict the action, no pair in the midst of colliding may touch the third ball, because the presence of the third ball effectively makes the struck ball appear more massive. Applying the two conservation equations to solve the final velocities of three or more balls in a single collision results in many possible solutions, so these two principles are not enough to determine resulting action.

Even when there is a small initial separation, a third ball may become involved in the collision if the initial separation is not large enough. When this occurs, the complete solution method described below must be used.

Small steel balls work well because they remain efficiently elastic with little heat loss under strong strikes and do not compress much (up to about 30 μm in a small Newton&#x27;s cradle). The small, stiff compressions mean they occur rapidly, less than 200 microseconds, so steel balls are more likely to complete a collision before touching a nearby third ball. Softer elastic balls require a larger separation to maximize the effect from pair-wise collisions.

===More complete solution===

A cradle that best follows the simple solution needs to have an initial separation between the balls that measures at least twice the amount that any one ball compresses, but most do not. This section describes the action when the initial separation is not enough and in subsequent collisions that involve more than two balls even when there is an initial separation. This solution simplifies to the simple solution when only two balls touch during a collision. It applies to all perfectly elastic identical balls that have no energy losses due to friction and can be approximated by materials such as steel, glass, plastic, and rubber.

For two balls colliding, only the two equations for conservation of momentum and energy are needed to solve the two unknown resulting velocities. For three or more simultaneously colliding elastic balls, the relative compressibilities of the colliding surfaces are the additional variables that determine the outcome. For example, five balls have four colliding points and scaling (dividing) three of them by the fourth gives the three extra variables needed to solve for all five post-collision velocities.

Newtonian, Lagrangian, Hamiltonian, and stationary action are the different ways of mathematically expressing classical mechanics. They describe the same physics but must be solved by different methods. All enforce the conservation of energy and momentum. Newton&#x27;s law has been used in research papers. It is applied to each ball and the sum of forces is made equal to zero. So there are five equations, one for each ball—and five unknowns, one for each velocity. If the balls are identical, the absolute compressibility of the surfaces becomes irrelevant, because it can be divided out of both sides of all five equations, producing zero.

Determining the velocities for the case of one ball striking four initially touching balls is found by modeling the balls as weights with non-traditional springs on their colliding surfaces. Most materials, like steel, that are efficiently elastic approximately follow Hooke&#x27;s force law for springs, formula_1, but because the area of contact for a sphere increases as the force increases, colliding elastic balls follow Hertz&#x27;s adjustment to Hooke&#x27;s law, formula_2. This and Newton&#x27;s law for motion (formula_3) are applied to each ball, giving five simple but interdependent differential equations that can be solved numerically. 

When the fifth ball begins accelerating, it is receiving momentum and energy from the third and fourth balls through the spring action of their compressed surfaces. For identical elastic balls of any type with initially touching balls, the action is the same for the first strike, except the time to complete a collision increases in softer materials. Forty to fifty percent of the kinetic energy of the initial ball from a single-ball strike is stored in the ball surfaces as potential energy for most of the collision process. Of the initial velocity, 13% is imparted to the fourth ball (which can be seen as a 3.3-degree movement if the fifth ball moves out 25 degrees) and there is a slight reverse velocity in the first three balls, the first ball having the largest at −7% of the initial velocity. This separates the balls, but they come back together just before as the fifth ball returns. This is due to the pendulum phenomenon of different small angle disturbances having approximately the same time to return to the center. 

The Hertzian differential equations predict that if two balls strike three, the fifth and fourth balls will leave with velocities of 1.14 and 0.80 times the initial velocity. This is 2.03 times more kinetic energy in the fifth ball than the fourth ball, which means the fifth ball would swing twice as high in the vertical direction as the fourth ball. But in a real Newton&#x27;s cradle, the fourth ball swings out as far as the fifth ball. To explain the difference between theory and experiment, the two striking balls must have at least ≈ 10 μm separation (given steel, 100 g, and 1 m/s). This shows that in the common case of steel balls, unnoticed separations can be important and must be included in the Hertzian differential equations, or the simple solution gives a more accurate result.

===Effect of pressure waves===
The forces in the Hertzian solution above were assumed to propagate in the balls immediately, which is not the case. Sudden changes in the force between the atoms of material build up to form a pressure wave. Pressure waves (sound) in steel travel about 5 cm in 10 microseconds, which is about 10 times faster than the time between the first ball striking and the last ball being ejected. The pressure waves reflect back and forth through all five balls about ten times, although dispersing to less of a wavefront with more reflections. This is fast enough for the Hertzian solution to not require a substantial modification to adjust for the delay in force propagation through the balls. In less-rigid but still very elastic balls such as rubber, the propagation speed is slower, but the duration of collisions is longer, so the Hertzian solution still applies. The error introduced by the limited speed of the force propagation biases the Hertzian solution towards the simple solution because the collisions are not affected as much by the inertia of the balls that are further away.

Identically shaped balls help the pressure waves converge on the contact point of the last ball: at the initial strike point one pressure wave goes forward to the other balls while another goes backward to reflect off the opposite side of the first ball, and then it follows the first wave, being exactly one ball&#x27;s diameter behind. The two waves meet up at the last contact point because the first wave reflects off the opposite side of the last ball and it meets up at the last contact point with the second wave. Then they reverberate back and forth like this about 10 times until the first ball stops connecting with the second ball. Then the reverberations reflect off the contact point between the second and third balls, but they still converge at the last contact point, until the last ball is ejected —but this is a lessening of a wavefront with each reflection.

===Effect of different types of balls===
Using different types of material does not change the action as long as the material is efficiently elastic. The size of the spheres does not change the results unless the increased weight exceeds the elastic limit of the material. If the solid balls are too large, energy is being lost as heat, because the elastic limit increases with the radius raised to the power 1.5, but the energy which had to be absorbed and released increases as the cube of the radius. Making the contact surfaces flatter can overcome this to an extent by distributing the compression to a larger amount of material but it can introduce an alignment problem. Steel is better than most materials because it allows the simple solution to apply more often in collisions after the first strike, its elastic range for storing energy remains good despite the higher energy caused by its weight, and the higher weight decreases the effect of air resistance.

==Uses==
The most common application is that of a desktop executive toy. Another use is as an educational physics demonstration, as an example of conservation of momentum and conservation of energy.

==History==

The principle demonstrated by the device, the law of impacts between bodies, was first demonstrated by the French physicist Abbé Mariotte in the 17th century. His work on the topic was first presented to the French Academy of Sciences in 1671; it was published in 1673 as &quot;Traité de la percussion ou choc des corps&quot; (&quot;Treatise on percussion or shock of bodies&quot;).

Newton acknowledged Mariotte&#x27;s work, along with Wren, Wallis and Huygens as the pioneers of experiments on the collisions of pendulum balls, in his &quot;Principia&quot;.

Christiaan Huygens used pendulums to study collisions. His work, &quot;De Motu Corporum ex Percussione&quot; (On the Motion of Bodies by Collision) published posthumously in 1703, contains a version of Newton&#x27;s first law and discusses the collision of suspended bodies including two bodies of equal mass with the motion of the moving body being transferred to the one at rest.

There is much confusion over the origins of the modern Newton&#x27;s cradle. Marius J. Morin has been credited as being the first to name and make this popular executive toy. However, in early 1967, an English actor, Simon Prebble, coined the name &quot;Newton&#x27;s cradle&quot; (now used generically) for the wooden version manufactured by his company, Scientific Demonstrations Ltd. After some initial resistance from retailers, they were first sold by Harrods of London, thus creating the start of an enduring market for executive toys. Later a very successful chrome design for the Carnaby Street store Gear was created by the sculptor and future film director Richard Loncraine.

The largest cradle device in the world was designed by &quot;MythBusters&quot; and consisted of five one-ton concrete and steel rebar-filled buoys suspended from a steel truss. The buoys also had a steel plate inserted in between their two-halves to act as a &quot;contact point&quot; for transferring the energy; this cradle device did not function well because concrete is not elastic so most of the energy was lost to a heat buildup in the concrete. A smaller-scale version constructed by them consists of five chrome steel ball bearings, each weighing , and is nearly as efficient as a desktop model.

The cradle device with the largest-diameter collision balls on public display was visible for more than a year in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, at the retail store American Science and Surplus (see photo). Each ball was an inflatable exercise ball in diameter (encased in steel rings), and was supported from the ceiling using extremely strong magnets. It was dismantled in early August 2010 due to maintenance concerns.

==In popular culture==
Newton&#x27;s cradle appears in some films, often as a trope on the desk of a lead villain such as Paul Newman&#x27;s role in &quot;The Hudsucker Proxy&quot;, Magneto in &quot;X-Men&quot;, and the Kryptonians in &quot;Superman II&quot;. It was used to represent the unyielding position of the NFL towards head injuries in &quot;Concussion.&quot; It has also been used as a relaxing diversion on the desk of lead intelligent/anxious/sensitive characters such as Henry Winkler&#x27;s role in &quot;Night Shift&quot;, Dustin Hoffman&#x27;s role in &quot;Straw Dogs&quot;, and Gwyneth Paltrow&#x27;s role in &quot;Iron Man 2&quot;. It was featured more prominently as a series of clay pots in &quot;Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead&quot;, and as a row of 1968 Eero Aarnio bubble chairs with scantily clad women in them in &quot;Gamer&quot;. In &quot;Storks&quot;, Hunter, the CEO of Cornerstore, has one not with balls, but with little birds. Newton&#x27;s cradle is an item in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Animal Crossing&quot; where it is referred to as &quot;executive toy&quot;. In 2017, an episode of the &quot;Omnibus&quot; podcast, featuring &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; champion Ken Jennings and musician John Roderick, focused on the history of Newton&#x27;s cradle. Newton&#x27;s cradle is also featured on the desk of Deputy White House Communications Director Sam Seaborn in &quot;The West Wing&quot;. In the &quot;Futurama&quot; episode &quot;The Day the Earth Stood Stupid&quot;, professor Hubert Farnsworth is shown with his head in a Newton&#x27;s cradle and saying he&#x27;s a genius as Philip J. Fry walks by. 

Progressive rock band Dream Theater uses the cradle as imagery in album art of their 2005 release &quot;Octavarium&quot;. Rock band Jefferson Airplane used the cradle on the 1968 album &quot;Crown of Creation&quot; as a rhythm device to create polyrhythms on an instrumental track.

<doc id="1090020" wikidata="Q44270" url="?curid=1090020" title="Burkina Faso national football team">
<text>The Burkina Faso national football team () represents Burkina Faso in men&#x27;s international football and is controlled by the Burkinabé Football Federation. They were known as the Upper Volta national football team until 1984, when Upper Volta became Burkina Faso. They finished fourth in the 1998 Africa Cup of Nations, when they hosted the tournament. Their best ever finish in the tournament was the 2013 edition, reaching the final.

==History==
Their first international match was played on April 13, 1960, in the Jeux de la Communauté in Madagascar and ended with a 5–4 victory against Gabon.

===Africa Cup of Nations===

The country made their first appearance in the Africa Cup of Nations in 1978, but it was not until 1996 that they returned to the biennial tournament. They subsequently qualified for five consecutive tournaments between 1996 and 2004, reaching the semi-finals under coach Philippe Troussier when the tournament was held on home soil in 1998.

Burkina Faso played in Group B of the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations alongside Ghana and Ivory Coast in a three-team group due to Togo&#x27;s withdrawal. Although they drew their first match against Ivory Coast and needed just a draw against Ghana to progress, the Burkinabe lost 1–0 and failed to qualify for the knock-out stage of the tournament. Burkina Faso took part in the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, losing all three of their matches and subsequently firing coach Paulo Duarte. Belgian coach Paul Put was announced as new coach in March 2012.
Burkina Faso finished first of their group, but lost to Nigeria in the final of the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations.

The team would earn third place at the 2017 Africa Cup of Nations.

===World Cup qualifying===

Burkina Faso first entered the World Cup in the 1978 qualifying tournament, beating Mauritania in the preliminary round before losing 1–3 against Ivory Coast. They next entered World Cup qualifying in 1990, losing in the first round to Libya 2–3. Burkina Faso withdrew from the 1994 competition but returned in 1998, beating Mauritania again to make it to the final qualifying group stage, however they failed to obtain a single point, finishing bottom of their group. They beat Ethiopia in 2002 to again make it to the qualifying group stage, but did not advance, only winning one game against Malawi.

The team had a strong showing in the 2014 World Cup qualification campaign, reaching the final round of qualifying where it faced Algeria. It won 3–2 in Ouagadougou, but lost 1–0 in Blida. Despite the 3-3 aggregate, Burkina Faso narrowly missed out on the 2014 World Cup due to the away goals rule.

==Nickname==
The team is nicknamed &quot;Les Etalons&quot;, which means &quot;The Stallions&quot;. It is in reference to the legendary horse of Princess Yennenga. Supporters of the team at times include a percussion band, which often mimics the sounds of galloping horses at matches.

<text>Island House is a historical building located on Island House Lane, Yuen Chau Tsai (), Tai Po, New Territories, Hong Kong.

==History==
Built in 1906, Island House served as the residence for the first British Police Magistrate appointed in 1898.

It was also the official residence of the North District Officer and the residences of District Commissioners for the New Territories. Island House had been resided in by a total of 15 District Commissioners since 1949. The last resident of the Island House was Sir David Akers-Jones, who became the Chief Secretary of Hong Kong in 1985.

Since then, the house has become the Island House Conservation Studies Centre () after it was passed to the custodianship of WWF HK. To increase public understanding and participation in biodiversity monitoring WWF Hong Kong have been increasingly getting involved in Citizen Science, incorporating iNaturalist and the City Nature Challenge activities into their sites across Hong Kong including Island House.

==Conservation==
Island House is one of the declared monuments of Hong Kong since 1983.

<text>Bruchsal (; South Franconian: &quot;Brusl&quot;) is a city at the western edge of the Kraichgau, approximately 20 km northeast of Karlsruhe in the state of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is located on Bertha Benz Memorial Route.

Bruchsal is the largest city in the district of Karlsruhe and is known for being Europe&#x27;s largest asparagus producer and one of the economic centers of the region of Karlsruhe. The Bruchsal area also includes the cities and towns of Bad Schönborn, Forst, Hambrücken, Karlsdorf-Neuthard, Kraichtal, Kronau, Oberhausen-Rheinhausen, Östringen, Philippsburg, Ubstadt-Weiher and Waghäusel. Until 1972 Bruchsal was the seat of the district of Bruchsal, which was merged into the district of Karlsruhe as a result of the district reform, effective January 1, 1973.

Bruchsal&#x27;s population passed the 20,000 mark around 1955. When the new Body of Municipal Law for Baden-Württemberg went into effect on April 1, 1956, the city was therefore immediately awarded Große Kreisstadt status. In addition, Bruchsal cooperates with the neighboring communities of Forst, Hambrücken and Karlsdorf-Neuthard in administrative matters.

==Geography==
Bruchsal is located at the edge of the Upper Rhine River Plains and the Kraichgau along the Saalbach, which is a small tributary of the Rhine that joins it between Philippsburg and Oberhausen.

===Neighboring communities===
The following cities and towns share a border with Bruchsal. They all belong to the district of Karlsruhe and are listed clockwise, starting in the North: Forst (Baden), Ubstadt-Weiher, Kraichtal, Bretten, Gondelsheim, Walzbachtal, Weingarten (Baden), Stutensee and Karlsdorf-Neuthard. In addition the exclave of Bruchsal situated North of Karlsdorf-Neuthard shares borders with the towns of Graben-Neudorf, Waghäusel and Hambrücken.

===Boroughs===
The city of Bruchsal is made up of Bruchsal proper along with the boroughs of Büchenau, Heidelsheim, Helmsheim, Obergrombach and Untergrombach.

A few neighborhoods within the city limits are known by their own name, but their limits are not precisely documented. Furthermore, former homesteads are located inside today&#x27;s city limits. These often only consist of one or several buildings, such as Langental, Rohrbacher Hof, Scheckenbronnerhof, Staighof, Talmühle and Auf dem Michaelsberg in the borough of Untergrombach.

==History==

===Ancient era and early Middle Ages===
Excavations and artifacts provide evidence of a settlement on the Michelsberg (Untergrombach) as early as 4000 BC during the Neolithic. In the core of Bruchsal the oldest settlement discovered was dated back to AD 640. It is located near today&#x27;s Saint Peter&#x27;s Church. The first mention of Bruchsal in official documents occurred in 976, when the king came to town. In October 980, Otto II and his court stayed at the king&#x27;s palace in Bruchsal for several days.

===Middle Ages===
Henry II of Germany became ruler of Bruchsal in 1002 following the subjugation of his rival Herrmann of Swabia. In 1056 Henry III of Germany presented the settlement to the bishop of Speyer (Konrad I) as a gift. The city remained part the diocese until the German Mediatisation in 1802. It also was the seat of an administrative district that originally only consisted of the core of Bruchsal (i.e., the city as it existed prior to the various district reforms). In 1067 Henry IV resided in Bruchsal from time to time. 1248 was the first time Bruchsal was referred to as a city, and in 1278 Saint Peter&#x27;s Church was mentioned for the first time. After extensive damage to both, the Palace and Saint Peter&#x27;s Church were reconstructed in 1320. The Bergfried (an outlook and defensive tower bastion) was erected in 1358, and the city wall was completed in 1452. In 1460 the first coin was minted in Bruchsal.

===1501–1750===
In 1502 the first peasant revolt (Bundschuh), led by Joß Fritz of Untergrombach, chose Bruchsal as its target. Traitors to the rebellion allowed the authorities to take the revolt&#x27;s leaders into custody. Ten were decapitated in the Bruchsal Palace courtyard. Joß Fritz got away and went into hiding in the Southern Black Forest. In 1525 the peasant revolts peaked. Inflation, hunger and the Plague added to the desperation, and the revolts were forcibly put down by the Prince. The known peasant leaders Hall, Wurm and the Minister Eisenhut were captured and decapitated in the Palace courtyard. During the 30 Years War in 1622 Bruchsal was completely destroyed, and in 1644 the French garrison in Philippsburg raided the city. In 1676 the French again destroyed parts of Bruchsal, and on August 10, 1689, the city was bombarded by the French general Duras and was completely destroyed. After that Bruchsal counted only 130 residents.

By April 24, 1711, Bruchsal had recovered sufficiently to play host to Prince Eugene of Savoy of the Habsburg Court in Vienna. Then in 1716 the Bishop of Speyer, Heinrich von Rollingen, moved his residence into the Bruchsal Palace. This move elevated the city&#x27;s status to that of an official residence of the Diocese of Speyer. At the same time, Bruchsal became the seat of the &quot;Vizedomamt&quot;, the most important office held by the Diocese on the West bank of the Rhine. In 1719 Cardinal Damian Hugo von Schönborn became the new bishop, and after settling in he commissioned in (1722), among others, the new baroque château and the new Saint Peter&#x27;s Church (from 1742). Both were built and, in part, designed by Balthasar Neumann. In the Bishop&#x27;s honor, the Southern gate out of the château grounds is referred to as Damian&#x27;s Gate to this day. In 1743 Franz Christof von Hutten, Schönborn&#x27;s successor, completed the extensive construction of the baroque city of Bruchsal, by adding Damian&#x27;s Gate, the military barracks and the Water Château (home to one of the city&#x27;s two regional, college track high schools, the Schönborn Gymnasium).

===1751–1815===
In 1753 the Schönborn Gymnasium was founded by Bishop von Hutten. In 1770 the new bishop, Count August von Limburg-Stirum, took up office. Bruchsal now counted 6,000 residents. In 1796 French troops occupied the city. German Mediatisation turned all property owned by the Diocese of Speyer over to the House of Baden, and Bruchsal became the seat of the district court. The district then was divided and reunited several times through 1819.

In 1806 the Marquess Amalie of Baden, widowed since 1801, took up residence in Bruchsal&#x27;s baroque château and lived there until 1823. She had 8 children of whom 6 were daughters, and she was known as Europe&#x27;s mother-in-law. Amalie&#x27;s son, the later Grand Duke Karl, was married to Stéphanie de Beauharnais, a niece of Napoleon&#x27;s wife Josephine per orders given by Napoleon himself. In 1812 Stephanie gave birth to a son, who died after 14 days. This was the origin of the legend of Kaspar Hauser&#x27;s nobility. Amalie&#x27;s daughter Louise was married to Alexander I of Russia and became the Russian Tsarina Elisabeth Alexeievna. Amalie&#x27;s daughter Friedericke wed Gustaf IV Adolf to become Queen of Sweden (though she asked for and received asylum in Bruchsal after 1807 due to the coup d&#x27;état of her husband&#x27;s government). Amalie&#x27;s daughter Maria was married to the Duke of Braunschweig, and two other daughters were married to the regents of Bavaria and of Hessen-Darmstadt.

In 1815, after Napoleon&#x27;s reign was over, Bruchsal and Amalie entertained the following company in the baroque château at Bruchsal until the dust settled: The Russian Tsar, Prince Metternich, the King of Prussia, as well as his son, the later Emperor of Germany.

===1816–1880===
In 1841 the Rhine Valley Railway was completed between Heidelberg, Bruchsal, and Karlsruhe. In 1848/1849 the Baden Revolution did manage to stray into Bruchsal a bit. While the revolutionaries (Gustav Struve, Lorenz Brentano, Amand Goegg and others) met in the château, the commoners freed prisoners from the just-completed prison. This prison, the Old Palace, was the scene of executions well into World War II and even later. On June 23, 1849, the revolution was quelled by Crown Prince Wilhelm at the battle of Ubstadt. 1856 brought gas lighting to Bruchsal, and the city received Baden&#x27;s Guillotine. In 1864 the district of Philippsburg was merged WITH the Bruchsal district, which now belonged to the newly formed &quot;Greater Karlsruhe.&quot; On June 1, 1869, the first German railway signal factory, Schnabel-Henning, was founded in Bruchsal. Later it was merged with Siemens AG, and the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 and 1871 made Bruchsal an important rail hub for the provisioning of German troops.

===1881–1945===
In 1881 a synagogue was built. The Industrial Revolution brought economic growth, mostly with the help of the railway and the area&#x27;s tobacco and hops production. 1889 gave residents in Bruchsal their first telephones, and in 1906 the Prince-Styrum Hospital was built. The city&#x27;s slaughterhouse opened in 1908, and World War I again turned Bruchsal into a major hub on the supply line for the troops. Immediately after the war, in 1919 and 1920 the city was wired for electricity. In 1934 the Autobahn was built between Heidelberg and Bruchsal, and in 1936 the Bretten district was merged with the Bruchsal district. In 1938 the Nazis destroyed the synagogue (in its place stands a fire station today) and the Jewish population were deported. In 1939 the District Bruchsal became the district of Bruchsal, which included 38 towns and cities, until it was merged into Karlsruhe (district) during the district reform of 1970. On the afternoon of March 1, 1945, Bruchsal was bombed by the Allies. At the time of the attack, the war was essentially over, with the front line only 20 km from the city limits and nearly no one left to defend it. To this day, that particular attack upsets residents as the consensus is that it was unnecessary and inconsequential to the outcome of the war. There are allegations that the attack by U.S. bombers was conducted in retaliation for the killing of a parachuted pilot by farmers. In addition to the 1,000 lives that perished that day, the entire inner city and the baroque château were destroyed. On April 2, 1945, allied forces took Bruchsal without resistance.

On March 1, 1945, shortly before 2 p.m., a bomb attack by the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) with 116 heavy bombers killed more than 1,000 people and destroyed the entire city center immediately before the end of the war (the Allies were already away on the Rhine) and the castle of the then 12,000-strong city.

On April 2, 1945, associations of the 1st French Army entered Bruchsal without a fight. In the following days, there were numerous rapes of Bruchsal girls and women by the French colonial troops (see Sexual Violence in World War II # French and British Army). Between November 1945 and March 1946, 13 people, who had been sentenced to death by American military courts for their involvement in National Socialist war crimes, were executed in Bruchsal. These included those involved in aviation murders and three employees of the Hadamar Nazi killing center, in which over 600 forced laborers had been murdered.

===1946 to the present===
Starting from 1 April 1956 Bruchsal was awarded the &quot;Große Kreisstadt &quot; status, as its population had passed the 20,000 mark in 1955. Between 1971 and 1974 the local government reform incorporated 5 neighbouring communities into the city of Bruchsal, including the cities of Heidelsheim and Obergrombach. Under a further reform in 1973, Bruchsal was incorporated into the district of Karlsruhe. Thus Bruchsal lost its district seat status, though it still remains a major economic centre of the region.

===Local government reform===
In the local government reform in the early 1970s the following cities and towns became part of the city of Bruchsal. Before the district reform they were all part of Bruchsal district.
* July 1, 1971: Obergrombach and Untergrombach
* July 1, 1972: Büchenau and Helmsheim
* October 1, 1974: Heidelsheim

==Government==
Under the local government reform in the 1970s, borough councils were introduced in Baden-Württemberg. Residents of each borough elect their Borough Council at each municipal election. The Borough Council must be consulted on issues that significantly affect the borough. The Borough President also leads the Borough Council.

===City council===
Since the last municipal elections on May 25, 2014, the City Council of Bruchsal consists of 32 members (previously 35) whose official title is &quot;Stadtrat&quot; (male) or &quot;Stadträtin&quot; (female) (City Councillor). They belong to political parties as follows:

===Mayor===
The head of the city is the Mayor, who is elected by registered voters for a term of 8 years. His permanent Deputy is the City Council President.

Mayors since 1900
* 1898–1913: Karl Stritt
* 1913–1933: Karl Meister
* 1945–1963: Franz Bläsi (CDU)
* 1964–1985: Adolf Bieringer (CDU)
* 1985–2009: Bernd Doll (CDU)
* 2009–present: Cornelia Petzold-Schick (Grüne)

===Coat of arms===
Bruchsal&#x27;s coat of arms features a solid, polished silver cross on blue background, with a silver ball in the top left quadrant. The official city colors are white and blue. The coat of arms symbolized the Cross of Speyer, referring to the fact that Bruchsal was the official residence of the Bishop until 1803, and has been in use for many centuries. There is some uncertainty as to how the ball came into the arms. The ball may have become part of the coat of arms by accident, in that an engraving fault may have been misinterpreted in an older print. Residents refer to it commonly as the &quot;Schandfleck&quot; (the &quot;blot on the city&#x27;s escutcheon&quot;).

==Main sights==

===Buildings===
The Château of Bruchsal was built in the baroque style of the mid 18th century, starting around 1720, and served as the official residence of the bishops of Speyer. Its centre was a three-winged building that was based on the plans of Maximilian von Welsch for Cardinal Damian Hugo Philipp von Schönborn, Prince-Bishop of Speyer (1719–1743) and of Konstanz (1740). After the plans had been modified several times, the central staircase was built by Balthasar Neumann, who had taken over and filled the role of Chief Engineer since 1731. It is generally regarded as one of the most successful design solutions for a baroque staircase. The château complex includes numerous other buildings, among them Damian&#x27;s Gate and the Church of the Court. In the closing days of World War II the château was badly damaged by an air raid aimed at Bruchsal, and it burned out completely. The famous staircase largely survived (though it was badly damaged), but the dome did not. After lengthy discussions about whether and how it should be done, the large central part of the building (Corps de Logis) was reconstructed (well into the 1970s) as a museum, while the Church wing design was changed to a modern design.

The &quot;Belvedere&quot; was originally designed as a Lustschloss (pleasure palace), to which a shooting house was added for use in the shooting competitions often held by the Court. As time went by, the Manor was nicknamed &quot;Belvedere&quot; by the city&#x27;s residents, as it enjoyed the best view of the city. The Belvedere is part of the City Gardens.

The most significant church in Bruchsal is Saint Peter&#x27;s Church, where the last of the Bishops of Speyer were laid to rest. Another important churches are the City Church of Our Lady and the Martin Luther Church (the main Protestant church of the city). City Hall adjacent to the Market Place is a modern building erected in the 1950s which has since been protected by law as an important historic structure.

The prison, constructed around 1848, is nicknamed the Octagon Cafe or &quot;Cafe Achteck&quot;. Today it is a high security institution and predominantly houses individuals convicted of violent crimes and convicted terrorists, such as members of the Red Army Faction.

===Museums===
The State Museum of Baden operates a branch in parts of the Château at Bruchsal. It features an art-historic collection and the German Music Box Museum.

Additionally, the boroughs of Heidelsheim and Untergrombach each maintain a museum of local history, and a Kindergartenmuseum displays items showing the history and development of preschools and includes games, dolls, and preschool furnishings. Inside Damian&#x27;s Gate at the southern exit of the château grounds, the local art society (Kunstverein Bruchsal e. V.) exhibits contemporary art.

===Parks===
The City Gardens near the &quot;Belvedere&quot; were constructed in 1901. Then there is the Bürgerpark around the Community Center and, last but not least, the Château Gardens, the largest park in the city. Its upper gardens were constructed at the same time the château was built, starting around 1721, while the middle and lower gardens were never completely finished. The railway to Heidelberg cuts through the lower gardens today and reduced them to a tree-lined avenue.

==Culture==
The Badische Landesbühne theater company calls Bruchsal home, its home theater being the stage in the Community Center (built on the grounds of the former Psycha, which is today the Bürgerpark and intended to be Bruchsal&#x27;s cultural center).

Bruchsal also supports an amateur theater company called Die Koralle. Die Koralle has produced between two and four plays a year, both modern and of the classics, since approximately 1965.

Another successful amateur theater company in the city is the Exil Theater, which produces several plays a year and serves as a stage for Willi - die Bühne, for the BLB (Badische Landesbühne) in summer and the Greek Theater Bruchsal. It is located behind the train station of Bruchsal and is the cultural life of the newly built Quartiersplatz and Bahnstadt.

Willi - die Bühne organizes independent arts events from time to time at the city slaughterhouse.

Although Bruchsal is a fairly small city it has a very active night life.

==Transport==

Bruchsal is located near the Autobahn A 5 (Karlsruhe - Frankfurt) (Bruchsal Exit). In addition, the city is traversed by federal highways B 3 (Karlsruhe - Heidelberg) and B 35 (Bretten - Germersheim).

Bruchsal station, designed and built by Berthold Schweikert, is located at the intersection of the Karlsruhe–Heidelberg line, the line to Mühlacker and the line to Germersheim.

Light rail or &quot;S-Bahn&quot; Lines S 3 (Karlsruhe - Heidelberg - Speyer) and S 4 (Bruchsal - Heidelberg - Speyer) of the S-Bahn RheinNeckar, and the S 31 (Karlsruhe - Bruchsal - Odenheim), S 32 (Karlsruhe - Bruchsal - Menzingen) and S 9 (Bruchsal - Bretten - Knittlingen - Mühlacker) lines of the Stadtbahn Karlsruhe in the Karlsruher Verkehrsverbunds (KVV) also stop at the Bruchsal station. Furthermore, most of the boroughs have stops along these light rail lines.

Additional public transport within the city and its immediate surroundings is offered by numerous bus lines.

==Media==
The Badischen Neuesten Nachrichten (BNN), a daily newspaper operating out of Karlsruhe, publishes a local edition by the name of &quot;Bruchsaler Rundschau&quot;.

&quot;Willi&quot;, a monthly magazine, is published and is also available online, at no charge, in .pdf form.

&quot;Stadtinfoplattform Bruchsal-XL&quot; offers facts, reports and up-to-date information on events in the city and region.

Cable TV&#x27;s Channel S14 broadcasts the &quot;Bruchsal-Magazin BM-TV &quot;with weekly programs on news from Bruchsal and the region. These broadcasts are also available via live Internet-TV through the Stadtinfoplattform Bruchsal-XL.de site. Also available are online archives.

Finally, the &quot;Bruchsaler Wochenblatt&quot;, a weekly offered free of charge, and the Kurier, an advertising weekly published by the Badischen Neuesten Nachrichten and also offered free of charge, round out the picture.

==Education==
Bruchsal was the home of the &quot;International University in Germany&quot;, one of the first private colleges in Germany. The university occupied the former military barracks complex in the Kasernenstraße before ceasing operations at the end of 2009, a casualty of the 2008 economics crisis.

Bruchsal also offers a wide variety of liberal arts schools, among them the Justus-Knecht-Gymnasium, the Schönborn-Gymnasium (both public college-track high schools), the St. Paulusheim gymnasium, a private college-track high school that started out as a boys-only boarding school, and the Albert-Schweitzer-Realschule, a non-college track public high school (all in the core of Bruchsal).

The school system also operates the following grammar and middle schools: Burg School in the borough of Obergrombach, Dietrich-Bonhoeffer-School, Johann-Peter-Hebel-School (near the Château Gardens), Joss-Fritz-School in Untergrombach, Konrad-Adenauer-School in the southern core of the city and Stirum School in the centrum, as well as an independent grammar school each in the boroughs of Büchenau and Helmsheim.

Specialized schools are offered as well: Pestalozzi School for the learning disabled and, administered by the district of Karlsruhe, Karl-Berberich-School for the mentally disabled. The district also runs the four vocational schools located in Bruchsal. They are the Balthasar-Neumann-School I, Balthasar-Neumann-School II (teaching artisan, mechanics and other hands-on occupations), the merchant and bookkeeping school (teaching administrative and merchant professions) and Käthe-Kollwitz-School (teaching professions in the field of home economics).

The Abendrealschule Bruchsal allows students with middle school diplomas to achieve the first in a series of steps to gain college entrance prerequisites on a part-time basis after work. It is part of a structured program commonly referred to as the Alternate Path to Higher Education. Furthermore, three private schools, the nursing school attached to the Fürst-Stirum-Klinik Bruchsal and the College for Special Education of St. Maria complete Bruchsal&#x27;s educational offers.

==Research==
The research project for urban and autonomous freight logistics, EfeuCampus, was launched in July 2019 on the site of the former Dragonerkaserne barracks. Systems for autonomous freight delivery and collection are developed and tested on the campus. The overall project is funded by the European Union and the state of Baden-Württemberg.

<text>Boxley is a village and civil parish in the Maidstone District of Kent, England. 

It lies below the slope of the North Downs approximately northeast of the centre of Maidstone town. The civil parish has a population of 7,144 (2001 census), increasing to 9,554 at the 2011 Census, and extends to the north and east of the town including the settlements of Boxley itself, Grove Green, most of Weavering Street, Sandling and the southern extremities of Walderslade and Lordswood at the top of Blue Bell Hill.

The M2 and M20 motorways cross the parish to the north and south of Boxley village and the High Speed 1 railway line passes to the south in cuttings and tunnel. Despite being so close to Maidstone and two motorways, the village is surrounded by woodland, and still retains a village feel. The ruins of Boxley Abbey, in neighbouring Sandling, fall within the parish. 

==Notable buildings==
The St Mary and All Saints parish church in Boxley village and the Abbey Barn, in Sandling, are Grade I listed buildings and the site of the abbey is a scheduled monument. Parsonage Farm in Boxley, Boxley Abbey House and St Andrew&#x27;s Chapel in Sandling, and Weavering Manor in Weavering Street, are all Grade II* listed. 

The Pilgrims&#x27; Way trackway and the North Downs Way pass through the parish. Boxley village was used for scenes in the film version of &quot;Porridge&quot;.

Within the parish are the Kent Life open-air museum, in Sandling, and Vinters Valley Nature Reserve. A 19th-century granary from Boxley was dismantled and re-erected at Kent Life.

&quot;Vinters&quot; was a country house and home to the Whatman family until it was demolished in the 1950s. Susanna Whatman was the first of her family to manage the house and the guide she wrote was published in 1952 - about 200 years after her birth.

<doc id="1090056" wikidata="Q7986057" url="?curid=1090056" title="West New Brighton, Staten Island">
<text>West New Brighton (also called West Brighton) is a neighborhood of Staten Island, New York City, situated in the central area of North Shore. The neighborhood is bordered by New Brighton to the east, Port Richmond to the west, the waters of the Kill Van Kull to the north, and the communities of Sunnyside and Castleton Corners to the south.

West New Brighton is part of Staten Island Community District 1 and its ZIP Code is 10310. West New Brighton is patrolled by the 120th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

==History==
Originally known as &quot;Factoryville,&quot; Islanders now commonly refer to the area as West Brighton. Some parts of the neighborhood closer to the shoreline are referred to as &quot;Livingston&quot; and &quot;Randall Manor&quot;. This area of Staten Island was originally settled by the Dutch in the 1600s, who were then followed by English settlers. During the American Revolution residents of West Brighton overtly remained loyal to the Crown. Successive waves of immigrants to the US then led to the area becoming populated by the Irish. Today, the neighborhood consists mostly of Irish followed by Germans, Italians, African Americans, and Hispanics.

The oldest continually operating cricket club in the US was established in West Brighton in 1872, at the site now operated as Walker Park. The Staten Island Cricket Club still has matches there. This is also the site of the first lawn tennis court in the US, built in 1873.

The neighborhood was transformed in the years following World War II. Two large public housing developments were built. The first, the Markham Homes, was originally built to house the families of shipyard &amp; defense workers. The West Brighton Houses followed. Starting in 2004 tenants in The Markham Homes were evicted, so the site might be redeveloped. all tenants had been relocated. While claims had been made that many residents would be able to return into the redeveloped area, few have been able to.

Since the late 90s the area has seen a reduction in some crime rates. Richmond Terrace, which is the main thoroughfare along the Kill Van Kull waterfront, is home to several shipyards and tugboat companies. The area south of Forest Avenue, continues to be home to some of West Brighton&#x27;s more affluent residents including politicians, lawyers, judges and professionals (particularly in the &quot;Sunset Hill&quot; portion east of Broadway). As of 2014 it was the highest earning census tract on Staten Island.

Politically, West Brighton has been described as a &quot;swing neighborhood&quot; for the borough. With a diverse and representative population, congressional candidates who win the neighborhood tend to also win the borough election.

The former St. Vincent&#x27;s Medical Center, now known as Richmond University Medical Center is located in West Brighton. While most of the buildings on the RUMC campus date from the late 1960s or more recent, the Garner Mansion goes back to the 19th Century. It at one time was used for the St. Austin&#x27;s Military School, now defunct.

The Michael J. Mahoney playground is a reminder of a small dose of American History. A son of New York City, and West Brighton, he went off with the US Marines to fight in World War I. He fought in 5 major battles in 1918. Mahoney along with many other Marines, was killed charging up Blanc Mont Ridge, France into the German Maxim machine guns. It is considered by many historians to be the real breaking point of the Germans defensive line before the German homeland. His body was repatriated from his burial plot amongst the thousands of Americans Marines and soldiers buried in World War I memorial cemeteries in France in 1924. His grave is located in St. Peters Cemetery in the family plot. The playground was dedicated in 1940 by the City of New York.

<doc id="1090058" wikidata="Q1345873" url="?curid=1090058" title="Chewing tobacco">
<text>Chewing tobacco is a type of smokeless tobacco product that is placed between the cheek and lower gum to draw out its flavor. It consists of coarsely chopped aged tobacco that is flavored and often sweetened; it is not ground fine like dipping tobacco. Unwanted juices are spat while chewing.

Chewing tobacco is a source of nicotine and therefore highly addictive. Quitting chewing tobacco use is as challenging as smoking cessation.

Using chewing tobacco can cause various harmful effects such as dental disease, oral cancer, oesophagus cancer, and pancreas cancer, coronary heart disease, as well as negative reproductive effects including stillbirth, premature birth and low birth weight. Chewing tobacco poses a lower health risk than traditional combusted products. However it is not a healthy alternative to cigarette smoking. The level of risk varies between different types of products and producing regions. There is no safe level of chewing tobacco use. Globally it contributes to 650,000 deaths each year.

==Types==

Chewing tobacco may be left as loose leaves or compressed into a small rectangular &quot;plug&quot;. Nearly all modern chewing tobaccos are produced by leaf curing, cutting, fermentation, and processing, which may include sweetening and flavoring. Historically, many American chewing tobacco brands popular during the American Civil War era were made with cigar clippings. 

===Loose-leaf===
Loose-leaf chewing tobacco is the most widely available and most frequently used type of chewing tobacco. It consists of shredded tobacco leaf, usually sweetened and sometimes flavored, and often sold in a sealed pouch typically weighing 3 oz. Loose-leaf chewing tobacco has a sticky texture due to the sweeteners added. Common loose-leaf chewing tobacco brands include America&#x27;s Best Chew, Levi Garrett, Beech-Nut, and Stoker&#x27;s.

===Plug===
Plug chewing tobacco is tobacco leaves pressed into a square, brick-like mass called a plug. From this, pieces are bitten off or cut from the plug and then chewed. Plug tobacco is declining in popularity, and is thus less readily available than loose-leaf chewing tobacco. Historically, plug tobacco could be either smoked in a pipe or chewed, but today, these are two distinct products.

===Twist===
Twist chewing tobacco consists of leaves twisted together into a rope-like mass. Unlike most loose-leaf tobaccos, twist chewing tobacco is usually not sweetened. Pieces of twist are either bitten off or cut and then chewed. Twist chewing tobacco is not widely available and is mostly found in Appalachia. Historically, twists could also be smoked in a pipe, or ground up into nasal snuff.

==Health effects==
Even though it is less dangerous than smoking, chewing tobacco is addictive, represents a minor health risk, has safe level of use, but is not a safe substitute for smoking. Globally it contributes to 650,000 deaths each year, with a significant proportion of these in Southeast Asia.

Using chewing tobacco can cause minor health effects such as dental disease, cardiovascular disease, asthma, and deformities in the female reproductive system. It also raises the risk of fatal coronary artery disease, fatal stroke and non-fatal ischaemic heart disease.

Quitting chewing tobacco use is as challenging as smoking cessation. There is no scientific evidence that using chewing tobacco can help a person quit smoking.

=== Cancer ===
Chewing tobacco is a cause of oral cancer, oesophagus cancer, and pancreas cancer. Increased risk of oral cancer caused by chewing tobacco is present in countries such as the United States but particularly prevalent in Southeast Asian countries where the use of smokeless tobacco is common.

All tobacco products, including chewing, contain cancer-causing chemicals. These carcinogenic compounds occurring in chewing tobacco vary widely, and depend upon the kind of product and how it was manufactured. There are 28 known cancer-causing substances in chewing tobacco products.

=== Cardiovascular disease ===
Using chewing tobacco increases the risk of fatal coronary heart disease and stroke. In 2010 more than 200 000 people died from coronary heart disease due to smokeless tobacco use. Use of chewing tobacco also seems to greatly raise the risk of non-fatal ischaemic heart disease among users in Asia, although not in Europe.

=== Effects during pregnancy ===
Chewing tobacco can cause adverse reproductive effects including stillbirth, premature birth, low birth weight. Nicotine in chewing tobacco products that are used during pregnancy can affect how a baby&#x27;s brain develops before birth.

==Chewing tobacco and baseball==
When the rules of baseball were first written in 1845, the carcinogenic potential of chewing tobacco was unknown. At that time, it was commonly used by players and coaches alike. Smokeless tobacco use became rampant by players by the early 1900s. The use of chewing tobacco in baseball steadily increased until the mid-20th century, when cigarettes became popular and took the place of some players&#x27; smokeless tobacco habit.

Joe Garagiola, who quit, warned about chewing tobacco: 
Bill Tuttle was a Major League player who made a big name for himself both through baseball and his anti-chewing tobacco efforts. Tuttle was an outfielder for the Detroit Tigers, Kansas City Athletics, and Minnesota Twins. He was an avid tobacco chewer; even his baseball cards pictured him with a bulge in his cheek from the tobacco. Nearly 40 years after he began using smokeless tobacco, Tuttle developed a tumor in his mouth so severe, it protruded through his skin. A few years before he died, Tuttle had many of his teeth, his jawbone, his gums, and his right cheekbone removed. He also had his taste buds removed. Tuttle dedicated the last years of his life to speaking with Major League teams about not using chewing tobacco where television cameras could see the players so that children could not witness and be influenced by it. He also dedicated time to the National Spit Tobacco Education Program, which was being run by friend and former Major League player, Joe Garagiola. Tuttle died on July 27, 1998, after a 5-year battle with cancer.

Hall of Fame outfielder Tony Gwynn died of salivary cancer on June 16, 2014. He claimed the cancer was linked to his lifetime use of chewing and dipping tobacco.

A 2016 MLB collective bargaining agreement prohibited all new Major League Baseball players from using smokeless tobacco.

=== Effect on youth ===
Debate exists over whether players should be banned from using tobacco products during the games. The Major League Baseball Players Association disagrees, claiming it is a legal substance, so is acceptable to be used during games. Harvard School of Public Health professor Gregory Connolly, however, says, &quot;the use of smokeless tobacco by players has a powerful role-model effect on youth, particularly among young males in sport, some of whom remain addicted in future careers as professional athletes.&quot; According to Connolly, one-quarter of Minor League players do not support allowing the use of chewing tobacco during games, and one-third of Major League players support abolishing it. Due to health concerns, MLB was asked to ban the use of chewing tobacco during the 2011 World Series between the St. Louis Cardinals and Texas Rangers.

=== Statistics ===
Many believe that the widespread use of chewing tobacco by baseball players has led to a rampant increase in youth, and particularly teen, use. Additionally, teen use of smokeless tobacco has increased and it is more harmful and dangerous to tobacco user, while the use of all tobacco products by teens has decreased. This is true, especially among white and Hispanic males. In 1970, five times as many 65-and-older males used smokeless tobacco as 18- to 24-year-olds did (12.7% of the population were 65+ male users, 2.2% of the population were 18–24 male users). More specifically, moist snuff use increased for males ages 18–24 from 1% of the population to 6.2% of the population, while 65+ male users decreased from 4% to 2.2%.

A 2009 survey by The U.S. Centers for Disease Control revealed that 8.9% of U.S. high-school students had used smokeless tobacco on at least 1 day during the 30 days before the survey. Usage was more common among males (15.0%) than females (2.2%) and among Whites (11.9%) than Blacks (3.3%) or Hispanics (5.1%). The five states with the highest percentage of high-school users were Wyoming (16.2%), North Dakota (15.3%), South Dakota (14.6%), Montana (14.6%), and West Virginia (14.4%).

==Brands==

* America&#x27;s Best Chew
* Beech-Nut
* Copenhagen
* Grizzly
* Kodiak
* Levi Garrett
* Mail Pouch
* Oliver Twist
* Skoal
* Stoker&#x27;s
== History ==

Chewing is one of the oldest methods of consuming tobacco. Indigenous peoples of the Americas in both North and South America chewed the leaves of the plant long before the arrival of Europeans.

The Southern United States was distinctive for their production of tobacco, which earned premium prices globally. Most farmers grew some for their own use, or traded with neighbors who grew it. Commercial sales became important in the late 19th century, as major tobacco companies arose in the South, becoming one of the largest employers in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Durham, North Carolina, and Richmond, Virginia. Southerners dominated the tobacco industry in the United States. So much so that a concern as large as the Helme Tobacco Company, headquartered in New Jersey, was headed by former Confederate officer George Washington Helme. In 1938, R. J. Reynolds marketed 84 brands of chewing tobacco, 12 brands of smoking tobacco, and the top-selling Camel brand of cigarettes. Reynolds sold large quantities of chewing tobacco, even though that market peaked around 1910.
A historian of the American South in the late 1860s reported on typical usage in the region where it was grown, paying close attention to class and gender:

During surrender negations between Sherman and Generals Johnston and Breckenridge at Bennet Place, the later was vigorously chewing before and after he was given a drink of whiskey by Sherman. 

Chewing tobacco is still used, predominantly by young males in some parts of the American South, but also in other areas and age groups. In September 2006, both the Republican and Democratic candidates for Senator from Virginia admitted to chewing tobacco and agreed that it sets a bad example for children.

In the late 19th century, during the peak in popularity of chewing tobacco in the Western United States, a device known as the spittoon was a ubiquitous feature throughout places both private and public (e.g. parlors and passenger cars). The purpose of the spittoon was to provide a receptacle for excess juices and spittle accumulated from the oral use of tobacco. As chewing tobacco&#x27;s popularity declined throughout the years, the spittoon became merely a relic of the Old West and is rarely seen outside museums. Spittoons are still present on the floor of the U.S. Senate&#x27;s old chamber, honored as tradition.

<text>(, ) is a Swiss French-language daily newspaper published in Berliner format in Geneva by Le Temps SA. The paper was launched in 1998, formed out of the merger of two other newspapers, and (the former being a merger of two other papers), as those papers were facing financial problems. 

It is the sole nationwide French-language non-specialised daily newspaper of Switzerland. Since 2021, it has been owned by Fondation Aventinus, a not-for-profit organisation. is considered a newspaper of record in Switzerland. 

== History ==

=== Predecessor papers ===
The paper&#x27;s three predecessors were the (founded 1798), the (founded 1826), and (founded 1991). The &#x27; and the &#x27; were merged in 1991 as the , which was partially motivated by those paper&#x27;s financial issues as well as the impending creation of .&quot;&quot; Due to financial issues, it was proposed that the &quot;&quot; and merge in 1996. The editorial staff of both papers met, but this was declined by publisher Edipresse as it would have resulted in layoffs. Later that year, the papers again proposed a merger, as they were both facing financial troubles, and it was agreed they would the next year. 

The editor-in-chief of the news magazine &quot;L&#x27;Hebdo&quot;, , became the director and editor-in-chief of their new combined paper, then provisionally named the &quot;&quot;, to be headquartered in Geneva. Hoesli had formerly worked for the NQ. The editors-in-chief of the two merged papers, Ignace Jeannerat and Campiotti, were to assist him. The JdG&#x27;s company and Edipresse would each own 47% of the new title, with the future editorial team having 6%. Hoesli expressed that the new paper should not be a patchwork of the old two, but an entirely new publication. The Competition Commission accepted the merger in December 1997, as despite the fact that it gave Edipresse an advantage the JdG was unlikely to survive given the market conditions, so it was the least harmful option. In February 1998 the NQ and the JdG were discontinued, with their successor, , formed the next month.

=== Later ===
The first issue of was printed 18 March 1998. Hoesli was followed as editor-in-chief by Jean-Jacques Roth, starting in 2002. Roth was succeeded in 2010 by Pierre Veya. Chairman of the board of directors was David de Pury, succeeded by Gilbert Couteau in 2001, himself succeeded by Stéphane Garelli in 2001.

Edipresse held 47% of shares in the paper until 2011, when it was sold to Tamedia. It was bought by Ringier Axel Springer (a joint venture between the Berlin publisher Axel Springer and the Swiss publisher Ringier) in 2014. In the late 2010s, the paper&#x27;s advertising revenue and subscriber count began to decline, resulting in serious financial problems. Its subscriptions numbered 20,000, a decrease of half compared to five years prior, with the number dropping further to 14,000 in 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic reduced its advertising revenues 80% for the French Swiss press. The was agreed to be bought by a private non-profit foundation, Fondation Aventinus, in November 2020. It was acquired in January 2021, for an estimated 6.5 million euros. All staff, which numbered about 100, were transferred to a new company established in Geneva. Following this ownership change print production became more detached from web content.

== Organization ==
Its publishing company is Le Temps SA. In 2021, Le Temps SA also acquired the news portal , which had been created in 2019. The paper is accessible digitally from the website letemps.ch, and also has a mobile app. digitised the archives of its three predecessors. With assistance of the Swiss National Library and regional libraries, it gives free access to these papers on the internet at www.letempsarchives.ch since 2016. It is printed by Tamedia printing works in Bussigny. It was an early adopter of digital first production, where content is first produced for digital platforms before being printed. prints on weekdays, but also has a separate Saturday issue.

<text>Castlewellan () is a small town in County Down, in the south-east of Northern Ireland close to the Irish Sea. It is beside Castlewellan Lake and Slievenaslat mountain, southwest of Downpatrick. It lies between the Mourne Mountains and Slieve Croob. It had a population of 2,782 people in the 2011 census.

Castlewellan has a wide main street which runs through two main squares lined with chestnut trees. The town was designed by a French architect for the Annesley family. The Annesley family did not always own the land as they bought it from the Maginess family, then owners of what is now Castlewellan Christian Conference Centre and Castlewellan Forest Park. Castlewellan is unique within Ireland due to its tree-lined squares both in the old town (upper square) and new town (lower square) as well as its very wide main street. The old market house in the upper square was built in 1764 and now houses the public library.

==History==

Evidence of ancient settlement in the area includes the Drumena Cashel - a small stone-built farmstead enclosure (or &quot;cashel&quot;) from the Early Christian period. It is south west of Castlewellan off the A25 road to Rathfriland. Also nearby is Legannany Dolmen, approximately to the north near the village of Leitrim, on the slopes of Slieve Croob. Goward Dolmen is a megalithic monument from Hilltown on the road to Castlewellan. The huge granite capstone of this structure has slipped from its original horizontal position.

12 July 1849 saw the Dolly&#x27;s Brae conflict. Up to 1400 armed Orangemen marched from Rathfriland to Tollymore Park near Castlewellan, County Down. On their homeward journey, shots were fired and police were unable to control the situation. None of the Orangemen were harmed, but it was estimated that about 80 Catholics were killed and homes burnt.

Castlewellan Castle, a Scottish baronial castle of 1856, Castlewellan Lake in what is now Castlewellan Forest Park. The castle is now used as a privately run Christian conference centre, and is not generally open to the public.

According to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Insight Team, the entire village (the population then was given as 819) was bound over to keep the peace for a year in 1953 after disorder at an Orange walk.

===The Troubles===
A number of incidents occurred in Castlewellan during the Troubles. For example, in January 1980, three members of the Ulster Defence Regiment were killed in a Provisional Irish Republican Army land mine attack on their mobile patrol near Castlewellan. Those killed included James Cochrane (21, a Catholic), Robert Smyth (18, a Protestant), and Richard Wilson (21, a Protestant).

Castlewellan has historically been an Irish Republican town. In 2016, a large Republican commemoration of the 1916 Rising was held in the town. A march, commemorating the 1981 hunger strikes, was also held there in 2018.

Throughout the course of the Troubles, the area had a significant paramilitary presence, mostly involving Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) activity. In 2009, the Real Irish Republican Army claimed responsibility a car bomb which had been abandoned in the area.

==Amenities==
Castlewellan Forest Park and Castlewellan Lake are situated to the northwest of the village. The arboretum in the park was begun in 1740 and contains plants and trees from several different countries, including Spain, Mexico and Wales; the &#x27;Castlewellan Gold&#x27; form of Leyland Cypress – originating from a single mutant tree in the arboretum and widely propagated from the 1970s – was selected by the park director, John Keown, being first named &quot;Cupressus macrocarpa&quot; Keownii, 1963. The Peace Maze was constructed in the park between 2000 and 2001. Until 2007 it was the longest permanent hedge maze in the world.

==Schools ==
Schools serving the Castlewellan area include:
*St Mary&#x27;s Primary School, Aughlisnafin
*Annsborough Primary School
*Castlewellan Primary School
*St. Malachy&#x27;s Primary School, Castlewellan
*St. Malachy&#x27;s High School, Castlewellan
*Bunscoil Bheanna Boirche

==Transport==
Castlewellan railway station was opened on 24 March 1906 by the Great Northern Railway of Ireland, but closed on 2 May 1955.

Trains used to connect Newcastle and Belfast via Lisburn.

==Events==
The Celtic Fusion International Musical Arts Festival was held annually in the town for a number of years, starting in 2002.

The Soma Festival is an annual festival held in the town since 2013. It is a festival of live music, family, well-being, food and drink.

==Sport==
The local Gaelic Athletic Association club, Castlewellan GAC, is based in the village. Other local sports clubs include the association football (soccer) club, Castlewellan Town FC. Kilmegan Amateur Boxing Club is situated in the outskirts of the town and takes its name from the town&#x27;s parish name.

<doc id="1090064" wikidata="Q681670" url="?curid=1090064" title="Müller-Thurgau">
<text>Müller-Thurgau () is a white grape variety (sp. &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;) which was created by Hermann Müller from the Swiss Canton of Thurgau in 1882 at the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in Germany. It is a crossing of Riesling with Madeleine Royale. It is used to make white wine in Germany, Austria, Northern Italy, Hungary, England, Australia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, Belgium and Japan. There are around ) cultivated worldwide, which makes Müller-Thurgau the most widely planted of the so-called &quot;new breeds&quot; of grape varieties created since the late 19th century. Although plantings have decreased significantly since the 1980s, as of 2019 it was still Germany&#x27;s second most planted variety at 11,400 hectares and 11.4% of the total vineyard surface. In 2007, the 125th anniversary was celebrated at the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute. Müller-Thurgau is also known as Rivaner (Austria, Germany, Luxembourg, and especially for dry wines), Riesling x Sylvaner, Riesling-Sylvaner, Rizvanec (Slovenia) and Rizlingszilváni (Hungary).

==History of the grape variety==
Most grapes have been created from a desire to harness qualities in two separate grapes and to generate a new vine that combines the qualities of both.

When Dr. Müller created the grape in the Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute in the late 19th century, his intention was to combine the intensity and complexity of the Riesling grape with the ability to ripen earlier in the season than the Silvaner grape. Although the resulting grape did not entirely attain these two qualities, it nonetheless became widely planted across many of the German wine-producing regions.
By the 1970s, Müller-Thurgau had become Germany&#x27;s most-planted grape. A possible reason for the popularity of this varietal is that it is capable of being grown in a relatively wide range of climates and soil types. Many of these vines were planted on flat areas that were not particularly suitable for growing other wine grapes because it was more profitable than sugar beet, which was the main alternative crop in those locations. The vines mature early and bring large yield quantities, and are less demanding as to planting site than for example Riesling. Müller-Thurgau wines are mild due to low acidic content, but nevertheless fruity. The wines may be drunk while relatively young, and with few exceptions are not considered to improve with age. These facts meant that Müller-Thurgau provided an economical way to cheaply produce large amounts of medium sweet German wines, such as Liebfraumilch and Piesporter, which were quite popular up until the 1980s.

The turning point in Müller-Thurgau&#x27;s growth however was the winter of 1979, when on 1 January there was a sharp fall in temperatures, to 20 °F (−7 °C) in many areas, which devastated most of the new varieties, but did not affect the varieties such as Riesling which have much more hardy stems, after hundreds of years of selection. In the decades since then, the winemakers have begun to grow a wider variety of vines, and Müller-Thurgau is now less widely planted in Germany than Riesling, although still significant in that country and worldwide.

While the total German plantations of Müller-Thurgau are declining, the variety is still in third place among new plantations in Germany, after Riesling and Pinot noir, with around 8% of all new plantations in the years 2006–2008.

===Genealogy===
Recent DNA fingerprinting has in fact determined that the grape was created by crossing Riesling with Madeleine Royale, not Silvaner or any other suggested grape variety. But there has been some confusion on the way. In 1996, Chasselas seemed to be a valid candidate, and in 1997 the Chasselas variety Admirable de Courtiller was specified. However, this was shown to be wrong when the reference grape that was believed to be Admirable de Courtiller was proven in 2000 to be Madeleine Royale. Madeleine Royale was long believed to be a Chasselas seedling, but modern DNA fingerprinting methods suggest that it is actually a crossing of Pinot and Trollinger.

==German growing regions==
As of 2022, German regional plantings stood at:

*Rheinhessen, 
*Baden, 
*Palatinate, 
*Franconia, 
*Mosel, 
*Nahe, 
*Saale-Unstrut, 

Outside of Germany, the grape has achieved a moderate degree of success in producing lively wines in Italy, southern England (where most other grapes will not ripen in many years) Luxembourg (where it is called Rivaner), Czech Republic, and the United States.

<text>The Jordan national football team () represents Jordan in international football. It is under the jurisdiction of the Jordan Football Association. Jordan played five times in the Asian Cup. It reached the finals of a major tournament for the first time in the 2023 edition, finishing as runners-up. 

Jordan is a two-time champion of the Arab Games, in 1997 and 1999. The team reached the WAFF Championship final on three occasions but never won it. Jordan have hosted the WAFF Championship three times, in 2000, 2007, and 2010; the Arab Cup once, in 2002; and the Arab Games once, in 1999.

==History==

=== Early history (1953–1996) ===
The Jordanian national football team&#x27;s first international match was played in 1953 in Egypt where the team were defeated by Syria 3–1. The first FIFA World Cup qualifiers Jordan took part in was the 1986 qualifiers, they are yet to qualify to the FIFA World Cup.

=== Development era (1997–2007) ===
The Jordanian football coach, Mohammad Awad, to attain achievements for the Jordan national team between 1992 and 1999 when he helped his country Jordan win both tournaments of the Arab Games, starting in 1997 in Beirut, and 1999 in Amman. 

The Jordan national football team had begun making more improvements under the Serbian head coach Branko Smiljanić who had helped Jordan attain greater match results in the first round of the 2002 FIFA World Cup qualifiers but failed to help Jordan qualify for the next round. Brapanko also helped Jordan reach the semi-finals of the 2002 Arab Cup and got Jordan to win the fourth place in the 2000 West Asian Football Federation Championship and the second place in the 2004 edition in Syria but failed to help Jordan win these tournaments. After he resigned from coaching Jordan, the Egyptian Mahmoud El-Gohary agreed to take Branko&#x27;s place as head coach. 

Under the leadership of El-Gohary, the Jordan national team was able to qualify for their first AFC Asian Cup tournament, in China 2004, and helped Jordan reach the quarter-finals of the tournament but failed to qualify for the semi-finals after losing to Japan in a penalty shoot-out after the match had ended with extra time in a 1–1 draw. But thanks to El-Gohary, the Jordan team reached its highest FIFA world ranking which was the 37th place in 2004. Just like Serbian Branko, El-Gohary also helped Jordan achieve greater match results in the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualifications during Jordan&#x27;s first round but also failed to help Jordan qualify. 

In the WAFF championship tournaments of 2004 and 2007, El-Gohary helped Jordan win the third place in 2004 and helped Jordan reach the semi-finals in 2007. After coaching Jordan for five out of six matches in the 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualification, El-Gohary retired as a football coach, and the Jordan Football Association hired the Portuguese Nelo Vingada to take over as the head coach of Jordan but was not able to help Jordan qualify for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup.

=== Renaissance of Jordan football (2008–2015) ===
Another opportunity to show Vingada&#x27;s worthiness as head coach came in the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign. But after failing to help Jordan qualify for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Vingada was able to help Jordan win second place in the 2008 West Asian Football Federation Championship. Next up were the 2011 AFC Asian Cup qualification matches starting from January 2009. 

After getting off to a start by not winning the first two matches of the six, Vingada was sacked by the Jordan Football Association and replaced by the Iraqi Adnan Hamad, a coach in Asia known for his successes with his national team in Iraq as head coach as well as Iraq U-23 and other Iraq youth teams and clubs. His first experiences with Jordanian football players took place as he was coaching Jordanian football club, Al-Faisaly from 2006 to 2008 and achieved specific results with that team as well. After helping Jordan qualify for their second Asian Cup tournament in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup, Hamad began shouting &#x27;Allahu Akbar&#x27; for the Jordan national team in September 2010 when they had the 2010 West Asian Football Federation Championship hosted in the country of Jordan. 

Hamad prepared for that tournament with a couple of friendlies as well as three more to prepare for the AFC Asian Cup tournament in Qatar. Just like Mahmoud El-Gohary, Hamad also helped Jordan qualify for the quarter-finals in the 2011 AFC Asian Cup but failed to progress to the semi-finals as they were defeated by Uzbekistan 2–1. Hamad was also got Jordan to win second place in the 2011 Arab Games in Qatar. Hamad helped Jordan finish third in the final round of Asian group qualifying for the 2014 FIFA World Cup. 

Hamad was then replaced ahead of the final stages with the Egyptian Hossam Hassan leading them to the play-off round against Uzbekistan to determine the AFC participant in the inter-confederation play-offs. The games took place on 13 and 20 September 2013. With the two teams still evenly matched at full-time in the second leg, Jordan eventually progressed to the intercontinental playoff after winning 9–8 on penalties. The Jordanians missed their first FIFA World Cup debut after losing 5–0 against Uruguay, before the goalless draw from the second leg. Hassan then also helped Jordan to qualify to the 2015 AFC Asian Cup.

On 3 September 2014, Ray Wilkins was appointed as the new head coach of Jordan. Wilkins led Jordan at the 2015 AFC Asian Cup where they were eliminated in group-stages for the first time after two losses against Iraq and Japan and a win over Palestine.

=== Stagnation (2016–2023) ===
Jordan&#x27;s performance remained in certain stagnation when Jordan could not make it to the final round of the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualification, losing 0–1 to Kyrgyzstan and 1–5 to Australia. After that, Jordan would qualify for 2019 AFC Asian Cup where Jordan defeated Australia (1–0) and Syria (2–0) and a goalless draw against Palestine in the group stage becoming the first team in the tournament to reach the Round of 16. However, they were stunned by Vietnam losing via a penalty shootout (2–4).

In the 2022 World Cup qualification second round, Jordan finished in third position in their group. Subsequently, they clinched the top spot in their group during the 2023 Asian Cup qualification, earning themselves a berth in the main tournament.

=== Re-emergence (2024–present) ===

In June 2023, Hussein Ammouta was appointed as the Jordan national team coach. In early 2024, he led his squad to their first ever Asian Cup final, defeating Iraq 3–2 by scoring two goals during the stoppage time, Tajikistan 1–0, and South Korea 2–0 during the knockout stages. In the final, Jordan lost 3–1 to the host nation Qatar, all scored through penalties.

Following the national team&#x27;s historic run to the Asian Cup final, Jordan&#x27;s FIFA Ranking rose to 70th, the nation&#x27;s highest since September 2014.

<text>Bruno Kramm (born 13 October 1967, in Munich) is a German musician, known for programming, playing synthesizers and keyboards, co-fronting and performing backup vocals for the electro-industrial duo [[Das Ich]], alongside Stefan Ackermann. Kramm is a multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter and founder of the German goth club, &quot;Generation Gothic&quot;. He is also a record producer for a number of musical projects.

Known for his iconic &quot;devil-horn hair&quot;, Kramm sports a dark outfit during performances in Das Ich, often being significantly more &quot;made-up&quot; than vocalist Ackermann. His vocals tend to bring up a deeper and more intense feel that contrast Stefan&#x27;s fast-paced and shrill, exciting voice.

Bruno Kramm was an active member of the Pirate Party Germany and has been appointed by its board as federal commissioner on copyright issues. 
In September 2016 Kramm stepped down as party chairman and rejoined Alliance &#x27;90/The Greens.

<doc id="1090088" wikidata="Q1229166" url="?curid=1090088" title="Dunster">
<text>Dunster is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England, within the north-eastern boundary of Exmoor National Park. It lies on the Bristol Channel southeast of Minehead and northwest of Taunton. At the 2011 Census, it had a population of 817.

There are Iron Age hillforts in the area. Saxon Dunster was a parish in the Hundred of Carhampton. In the Domesday book there are four manors within the parish: Aucome (Alcombe), Avena (Avill), Stantune (Stanton) and Torre. Torre is now the site of the village of Dunster. Torre, including the castle and two watermills, was valued at 15 shillings and Aucome 20 shillings. The village grew up around Dunster Castle which was built at Torre by the Norman warrior William I de Moyon (d. post 1090) shortly after the Norman Conquest of 1066. The castle is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086. From that time it was the &quot;caput&quot; of the Feudal barony of Dunster. The castle was remodelled on several occasions by the Luttrell family who were lords of the manor from the 14th to 20th centuries. The benedictine Dunster Priory was established in about 1100. The Priory Church of St George, dovecote and tithe barn are all relics from the Priory.

The village became a centre for wool and cloth production and trade, of which the Yarn Market, built by George Luttrell (d.1629), is a relic. There existed formerly a harbour, known as Dunster Haven, at the mouth of the River Avill, but today, the coast having receded, it is now about from the village and no sign of the harbour can be seen on the low lying marshes between the village and the coast. Dunster has a range of heritage sites and cultural attractions which combine with the castle to make it a popular tourist destination with many visitors arriving on the West Somerset Railway, a heritage railway running from Minehead to Bishops Lydeard.

The village lies on the route of the Macmillan Way West, Somerset Way and Celtic Way.

==Name==
The name Dunster derives from: Dun,&quot; A dun is an ancient or medieval fort&quot; and chester, commonly indicates that the place is the site of a Roman &quot;castrum.&quot;

==History==
Within of the village itself are several Iron Age hillforts showing evidence of early human occupation. These include Bat&#x27;s Castle and Black Ball Camp on Gallox Hill, Long Wood Enclosure and a similar earthwork on Grabbist Hill.

Dunster is mentioned as a parish and Dunster Castle as belonging to William I de Moyon (alias de Moion, also de Mohun) in the 1086 Domesday Book. After the Norman conquest of England in the 11th century, he constructed a timber castle on the site as part of the pacification of Somerset. A stone shell keep was built on the motte by the start of the 12th century, and the castle survived a siege during the early years of the Anarchy. At the end of the 14th century the de Mohuns sold the castle to the Luttrell family, who continued to occupy the property until the late 20th century. During the English Civil War, Dunster was initially held as a garrison for the Royalists. It fell to the Parliamentarians in 1645 and orders were sent out for the castle to be demolished. However, these were not carried out, and the castle remained the garrison for Parliamentarian troops until 1650. Dunster is regularly home to Taunton Garrison who re-enact plays, battles, and life in the civil war. Major alterations to the castle were undertaken by Henry Fownes Luttrell who had acquired it through marriage to Margaret Fownes-Luttrell in 1747. Following the death of Alexander Luttrell in 1944, the family was unable to afford the death duties on his estate. The castle and surrounding lands were sold off to a property firm, the family continuing to live in the castle as tenants. The Luttrells bought back the castle in 1954, but in 1976 Colonel Walter Luttrell gave Dunster Castle and most of its contents to the National Trust, which operates it as a tourist attraction. It is a Grade I listed building and scheduled monument.

Dunster Priory was established as a Benedictine monastery around 1100. The first church in Dunster was built by William de Mohun who gave the church and the tithes of several manors and two fisheries, to the Benedictine Abbey at Bath. The priory, which was situated just north of the church, became a cell of the abbey. The church was shared for worship by the monks and the parishioners, however this led to several conflicts between them. One outcome was the carved rood screen which divided the church in two with the parish using the west chancel and the monks the east. The priory church is now in parochial use as the Priory Church of St George which still contains 12th and 13th century work, although most of the current building is from the 15th century. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. In 1332 it became more separated from the Abbey at Bath and became a priory in its own right. In the &quot;Valor Ecclesiasticus&quot; of 1535 the net annual income of the Dunster Tithe Barn is recorded as being £37.4.8d (£37 23p), with £6.13s7d ( £6.68p ) being passed on to the priory in Bath. In 1346 Cleeve Abbey built a nunnery in Dunster, but it was never inhabited by nuns and was used as a guest house. The priory was dissolved as part of the dissolution of the monasteries in 1539. Dunster was part of the hundred of Carhampton, but St George&#x27;s was the seat of the local deanery, overseeing the area&#x27;s parish churches.

The manors of Alcombe, Stanton (or Staunton), and Avill were also mentioned as settlements in the 1086 Domesday Book.

Dunster had become a centre for woollen and clothing production by the 13th century, with the market dating back to at least 1222, and a particular kind of kersey or broadcloth became known as &#x27;Dunsters&#x27;. The prosperity of Dunster was based on the wool trade, with profits helping to pay for the construction of the tower of the Priory Church of St George and provide other amenities. The 15th century Gallox Bridge was one of the main routes over the River Avill on the southern outskirts. The market was held in &quot;The Shambles&quot; however these shops were demolished in 1825 and now only the Yarn Market remains.

Dunster Beach, which includes the mouth of the River Avill, is located half a mile from the village, and used to have a significant harbour, known as Dunster Haven, which was used for the export of wool from Saxon times; however, it was last used in the 17th century and has now disappeared, as new land was laid down among the dykes, meadows and marshes near the shore. During the Second World War, considerable defences were built along the coast as a part of British anti-invasion preparations, though the north coast of Somerset was an unlikely invasion site. Some of the structures remain to this day. Most notable are the pillboxes on the foreshore of Dunster Beach. These are strong buildings made from pebbles taken from the beach and bonded together with concrete. From these, soldiers could have held their ground if the Germans had ever invaded. The beach site has a number of privately owned beach huts (or chalets as some owners call them) along with a small shop, a tennis court and a putting green. The chalets, measuring , can be let out for holidays; some owners live in them all the year round.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

The village falls within the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Williton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. The larger and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning are the responsibility of Somerset County Council.

As Dunster falls within the Exmoor National Park, some functions normally administered by district or county councils have, since 1997, fallen under the Exmoor National Park Authority, which is known as a &#x27;single-purpose&#x27; authority, whose purpose is to &quot;conserve and enhance the natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage of the National Parks&quot; and &quot;promote opportunities for the understanding and enjoyment of the special qualities of the Parks by the public&quot;, including responsibility for the conservation of the historic environment.

Dunster is the most populous area of the electoral ward Dunster and Timbercombe. The ward extends North East to the Bristol Channel and South West to Timberscombe. The total population at the 2011 Census was 1,219.

It is also part of the Tiverton and Minehead county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Before Brexit in 2020, it was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament.

==Geography==

Dunster Castle was positioned on a steep, high hill. Geologically, the hill is an outcrop of Hangman Grits, a type of red sandstone. During the early medieval period the sea reached the base of the hill, close to the mouth of the River Avill, offering a natural defence and making the village an inland port.

Nearby is the Dunster Park and Heathlands Site of Special Scientific Interest noted for nationally important lowland dry heath, dry lowland acid grassland, wood-pasture with veteran trees and ancient semi-natural oak woodland habitats. The fauna of the lowland heath includes the heath fritillary (&quot;Mellicta athalia&quot;), a nationally rare butterfly. The assemblage of beetles associated with the veteran trees is of national significance because of the variety and abundance of species.

Along with the rest of South West England, Dunster has a temperate climate which is generally wetter and milder than the rest of England. The mean annual temperature in the area is with a seasonal and diurnal variation, but due to the modifying effect of the sea the range is less than in most other parts of the UK. January is the coldest month, with mean minimum temperatures between . July and August are the warmest months in the region, with mean daily maxima around . In general, December is the month with the least sunshine and June the month with the most sun. The south west of England has a favoured location with regard to the Azores High when it extends its influence north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer. Cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, and reduce the amount of sunshine that reaches the park. The average annual sunshine is about 1,600 hours. Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. In summer, convection, caused by the sun heating the land surface more than the sea, sometimes forms rain clouds and at that time of year a large proportion of the rainfall comes from showers and thunderstorms. Annual precipitation is around . Local weather data is collected at Nettlecombe.

==Economy and demographics==

The village provides a variety of shops and amenities for both local residents and visitors. These are largely situated in West Street and the high street. The village has numerous restaurants and three pubs with considerable trade being brought by tourists visiting the heritage sites and particularly the castle which attracted approximately 150,000 visitors in 2014. Although there is still some agriculture, the previous reliance on the wool trade has been replaced by service industries catering to the visitors. Both day-trippers and those staying for longer periods are catered for with shops, pubs, cafes and hotels. 52.6% of people within the parish are employed which is slightly lower than the 61.9% in England and Wales and the 65.2% in Somerset.

At the time of the 2011 census there were 817 people living in the parish. 13.2% were children up the age of 15 years. 52.3% were between 16 and 64 with 34.5 being 65 and older. This is an older population than in the rest of Somerset and England and Wales in general. In line with the rest of Somerset the majority of the population (95%) describes themselves as White British. 69.7% of the population live in property which they own, with 14.3% living in social rented accommodation and 12.9% privately rented. There is a higher proportion of people living alone than in other areas. The housing is fairly evenly divided between detached, semi-detached and terraced house, with 5.7% living in flats.

==Culture==

Dunster was the birthplace of the song &quot;All Things Bright and Beautiful&quot; when Cecil Alexander was staying with Mary Martin, the daughter of one of the owners of Martins Bank. The nearby hill, Grabbist, was originally heather-covered before its reforestation and was described as the &quot;Purple-headed mountain&quot;.

On the evening of 1 May each year the Minehead Hobby Horse visits Dunster and is received at the Castle. A local newspaper printed in May 1863 says &quot;The origin professes to be in commemoration of the wreck of a vessel at Minehead in remote times, or the advent of a sort of phantom ship which entered the harbour without Captain or crew. Once the custom was encouraged, but now is much neglected, and perhaps soon will fall into desuetude.&quot; Another conjecture about its origin is that the hobby horse was the ancient King of the May. The Hobby Horse tradition begins with the waking of the inhabitants of Minehead by the beating of a loud drum. The hobby horse dances its way about the town and on to Dunster Castle.

Annually on the third Friday in August the village hosts the well known Dunster Show where local businesses and producers come together to showcase the very best that Exmoor and West Somerset has to offer. A major part of the show is the showing of livestock especially horses, cattle and sheep. The 2023 show was the 175th show. No shows were held in 2020 or 2021 due to the Coronavirus pandemic.

A more recent tradition (started in 1987) is Dunster by Candlelight which takes place every year on the first Friday and Saturday in December when this remarkably preserved medieval village turns its back on the present and lights its streets with candles. To mark the beginning of the festival on Friday at 5 pm, there is the Lantern Lighting Procession that starts on the Steep and continues through the village until all the lanterns in the streets have been lit. The procession of children and their families is accompanied by colourful stilt walkers in costumes who put up the lanterns.

The old English Christmas tradition of burning the Ashen faggot takes place at the Luttrell Arms hotel every Christmas Eve. The pub was formerly a guest house for the Abbots of Cleeve; its oldest section dates from 1443.

==Religious sites==
The Priory Church of St George is predominantly 15th century with evidence of 12th- and 13th century work. It has been designated as a Grade I listed building. The church was started by William de Moyon during the 11th century.The tower was built by Jon Marys of Stogursey who received a contract from the parish in 1442. He was paid 13s 4d (approx. 67p) for each foot in height and £1 for the pinnacles. The work was completed in three years. Aisles were added in 1504.

The church was shared for worship between the monks of Dunster Priory and the parishioners, however this led to several conflicts between them. One outcome was the carved rood screen which divided the church in two with the parish using the west chancel and the monks the east. It was restored in 1875–77 by George Edmund Street. The church has a cruciform plan with a central four-stage tower, built in 1443 with diagonal buttresses, a stair turret and single bell-chamber windows.

==Landmarks==

Dunster lies within Exmoor National Park and has many listed buildings, including 200 Grade II, two Grade II* and two Grade I.

The 17th century Yarn Market is a market cross which was probably built in 1609 by the Luttrell family who were the local lords of the manor to maintain the importance of the village as a market, particularly for wool and cloth. The Yarn Market is an octagonal building constructed around a central pier. The tiled roof provides shelter from the rain. The building contains a hole in one of the roof beams, a result of cannon fire in the Civil War. A bell at the top was rung to indicate the start of trading.

Nearby was an older cross known as the Butter Cross which was constructed in the late 14th or early 15th century and once stood in the High Street, possibly at the southern end of the high street, and was moved to its current location on the edge of the village possibly in 1825, however a drawing by J. M. W. Turner made in 1811 suggests it was in its present position by then. The site where the cross now stands was leveled in 1776 by workman, paid by Henry Fownes Luttrell, and it may have been on this occasion that the cross was moved. The cross has an octagonal base and polygonal shaft, however the head of the cross has been lost. It stands on a small area of raised ground on a plinth. The socket stone is wide and high. The surviving shaft is high and changes from square to octagonal as it rises. There is an inscription on the northern face which says &quot;WC, 1871, WS&quot; recording a restoration. It is in the care of English Heritage for the state and managed by the National Trust.

Other notable buildings include the Nunnery, Dunster Watermill, Dovecote and the Priory barn, which belonged to Dunster Priory. Dunster Working Watermill (also known as Castle Mill) is a restored 18th century watermill, situated on the River Avill, close to Gallox Bridge, in the grounds of Dunster Castle. It is a Grade II* listed building. The mill stands on a site where a mill was first recorded in the Domesday Book, but the present building was constructed around 1780. It closed in 1962 but was restored in 1979 and is still used to grind flour. The equipment is powered by two overshot wheels. It is owned by the National Trust but operated as a tourist attraction by a private company.

The Dovecote was probably built in the late 16th century. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building and Scheduled Monument. It is approximately high and in diameter, with walls around thick. In the 18th century the floor level and door were raised among several major alterations. The lower tiers of nest holes were blocked to protect against brown rats which had arrived in the Britain in 1720 and reached Somerset by 1760. A revolving ladder, known as a &quot;potence&quot;, was installed to allow the pigeon keeper to search the nest holes more easily. In the 19th century two feeding platforms were added to the axis of the revolving ladder. When the ladder was installed in the 16th century the base rests on a pin driven into a beam on the floor. The head of the pin sits in a metal cup in the base of the wooden pillar, which means the mechanism has never had to be oiled. When the Dunster Castle estate was sold the dovecote was bought by the Parochial church council and opened to the public. Extensive repairs were undertaken in 1989.
The Tithe Barn was originally part of a Benedictine Dunster Priory, has been much altered since the 14th century and only a limited amount of the original features survive. In the &quot;Valor Ecclesiasticus&quot; of 1535 the net annual income of the Dunster Tithe Barn is recorded as being £37.4s.8d (£37.23p), with £6.13s.7d ( £6.68p ) being passed on to the priory in Bath. The Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust (SBPT) has co-ordinated a £550,000 renovation project on behalf of the Dunster Tithe Barn Community Hall Trust (DTBCHT), into a multi-purpose community hall under a 99-year lease at a pepper-corn rent, by the Crown Estate Commissioners who own the building. Funding has been obtained from the Heritage Lottery Fund and others to support the work.

Conygar Tower is a folly used as a landmark for shipping. It is at the top of Conygar Hill and overlooks the village. It is a circular, 3 storey tower built of red sandstone, situated on a hill overlooking the village. It was commissioned by Henry Luttrell and designed by Richard Phelps and stands about high so that it can be seen from Dunster Castle on the opposite hillside. There is no evidence that it ever had floors or a roof. It has no strategic or military significance. The name Conygar comes from two medieval words &quot;Coney&quot; meaning rabbit and &quot;Garth&quot; meaning garden, indicating that it was once a warren where rabbits were bred for food. In 1997 a survey carried out by The Crown Estate identified cracks in the walls which were repaired in 2000.

Dunster Doll Museum houses a collection of more than 800 dolls from around the world, based on the collection of the late Mollie Hardwick, who died in 1970 and donated her collection to the village memorial hall committee. Established in 1971, the collection includes a display of British and foreign dolls in various costumes. Thirty-two of the dolls were stolen during a burglary in 1992 and have never been recovered.

==Transport==

Dunster railway station is on the West Somerset Heritage Railway, though the station is over a mile from the village. The station was opened on 16 July 1874 by the Minehead Railway. The line was operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway which was amalgamated into the Great Western Railway (GWR) in 1876. The Minehead Railway was itself absorbed into the GWR in 1897. A small signal box stood at the end of the platform, but was demolished in 1926 when this was extended. In 1934 a &quot;new&quot; signal box at the opposite end of the station, brought second-hand from Maerdy, was put into use when the line from Dunster to was doubled in 1934. The GWR was nationalised into British Railways in 1948 and from 1964, when goods traffic was withdrawn on 6 July, the line was run down until it was eventually closed on 4 January 1971. The line was reopened as a heritage railway operated by the West Somerset Railway on 28 March 1976. The signal box was moved to Minehead in 1977 but the goods yard is now home to the railway&#x27;s civil engineering team. It is a Grade II listed building.

Road access is via the A39 and A396. The nearest international airports would be those at Exeter or Bristol.

==Education==

Dunster First School provides primary education for children from 4 to 9 years. In 2015 the school had 143 pupils. The Grade II listed building was originally constructed in the 1870s. It has since been modified and expanded and now includes a heated outdoor swimming pool. Middle education in the area is provided by Danesfield School and Minehead Middle School; while secondary education in the area is provided by West Somerset College in Minehead.

<doc id="1090089" wikidata="Q105303" url="?curid=1090089" title="Nave, Lombardy">
<text>Nave (Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy. Neighbouring communes are, from the south and clockwise: Brescia, Bovezzo, Concesio, Lumezzane, Caino, Serle and Botticino. It is located in the Garza valley.

The origin of the name Nave is not certain. Some maintain it comes from &quot;nava&quot; (cfr. English &quot;navel&quot;) meaning the valley basin in which Nave sits, others think it is a contraction from Latin &quot;nam vallis&quot;, wide valley . Another possibility is it comes from Latin meaning ship (cfr. Italian &quot;nave&quot; with the same meaning) due to the overall shape of the town when seen from the Maddalena mountain. Notwithstanding this hypothesis being held as improbable, the coat of arms of the town sports a ship on it.

Originally Nave consisted in a series of loosely connected urban sections: Nave proper (Nave centro, &quot;Nàe&quot;), Campanile (&quot;Kampanìl&quot;), Cortine (&quot;Kurtìne&quot;), Dernago (&quot;Dernàk&quot;), Mitria (&quot;Mìtria&quot;), Monteclana (&quot;Monteklàna&quot;), Muratello (&quot;Möradêl&quot;) which eventually connected together following urbanization. This is reflected by the fact that Nave does not have a main square, which is very uncommon for an Italian town. Nave is also known as the Iron valley due to the many iron and steel factories that characterised the environment.

In one of its urban section - Cortine - is still possible to visit &quot;Villa Zanardelli&quot;, a former house of the President Giuseppe Zanardelli.

A Lombard language tongue twister plays on &quot;Nàe&quot; being both the name of the town and a past tense of the verb &quot;nà&quot; (English &quot;to go&quot;, Italian &quot;andare&quot;): &quot;en dè ke nàe a Nàe go &#x27;nkontràt el prèt de Nàe, &#x27;l ma dìt endò ke nàe me go dìt ke nàe Nàe&quot;, which can be translated as: I was going to Nave when I met the priest of Nave, he asked me where I was going and I told him I was going to Nave.

<doc id="1090090" wikidata="Q5691651" url="?curid=1090090" title="Hearing Voices Network">
<text>Hearing Voices Networks, closely related to the Hearing Voices Movement, are peer-focused national organizations for people who hear voices (commonly referred to as auditory hallucinations) and supporting family members, activists and mental health practitioners. Members may or may not have a psychiatric diagnosis. Networks promote an alternative approach, where voices are not necessarily seen as signs of mental illness and regard hearing voices as a meaningful and understandable, although unusual, human variation. Voices are not seen as the problem, rather it is the relationship the person has with their voices that is regarded as the main issue.

==Development==
The first hearing voices network was founded in the Netherlands in 1987 by the Dutch psychiatrist Marius Romme, the science journalist, Sandra Escher, and voice hearer, Patsy Hage. This was followed by the founding of the UK network in 1988 based in Manchester, England. Subsequently networks have been established in 29 countries over the world, including Australia, Canada, the UK, and the United States. The first 15 years of the global networks&#x27; development is outlined by Adam James in his book &quot;Raising Our Voices&quot; (2001).

The National and Regional Networks are affiliated with the international umbrella organization known as INTERVOICE (The International Network for Training Education and Research into Hearing Voices) and often referred to as the Hearing Voices Movement. Within these international networks, the combined experience of voice-hearers and professionals have overseen the development of ways of working with people who hear voices, drawing on the value of peer support and helping people live peacefully and positively with their experiences.

==Purpose==
The principal roles of Hearing Voices Networks are as follows:
# To support and develop local Hearing Voices Support Groups
#Raise awareness of the hearing voices approach
#To campaign for human rights and social justice for people who hear voices
#To provide information, advice and support to people who hear voices, their family, friends
#To provide training and education for mental health services and practitioners

==Practices and philosophy==
These networks are designed to support voice hearers specifically through local hearing voices support groups, where people who hear voices are afforded the opportunity in a non-medical setting to share their experiences, coping mechanisms, and explanatory frameworks. These groups are run in different ways and some are exclusive to individuals who hear voices, while others are supported by mental health workers. Groups are based in a range of settings, from community centers, libraries, churches, child and adolescent mental health services, prisons, and inpatient units.

Groups are designed to function as peer support groups meant foster socialization and belonging, not therapy and treatment. Members are encouraged to talk about their experiences, to learn what the voices mean to them, and how to gain control over their experiences. Should members desire to, groups can help members explore the relationship between their life history and their experience of hearing voices.

Studies show that members found attending hearing voices groups a largely positive experience, being able to share their experiences and explore and experiment with different coping strategies. Members also said that attending improved their self esteem, helped them make friends, and allowed them to feel more prepared for the future.

Studies have found that after attending hearing voices groups, members&#x27; hospital bed use decreased and there was a trend for less formal admissions. People&#x27;s relationships with the voices were mostly improved and heard the voices less frequently. The voices were perceived as less powerful and having less control over them, and participants reported feeling better able to cope the voices and less alone. Importantly, evaluations showed that members improved in what they had identified as their own goals for the group.

National networks have developed considerably over the years and host websites, publish newsletters, guides to the voice hearing experience, and workbooks where individuals can record and explore their own experiences with voice hearing.

Romme has provided an intellectual basis for these groups in the book &quot;Accepting Voices&quot;, where he advocates a view that the hearing of voices is not necessarily an indication of mental illness and that patients should be encouraged to explore their voices and negotiate with them.

<text>Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad (H&amp;BTM) is a former short line railroad company operating passenger and freight service on standard gauge track in south central Pennsylvania.

Operational headquarters were in Huntingdon and Saxton, with financial and business offices located in Philadelphia. The primary shop facilities were located in Saxton; auxiliary car shop facilities were at Huntington. Turntables were located at Huntingdon, Saxton and Mount Dallas, Pennsylvania.

== History ==

===Construction===
The Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad and Coal Company was chartered on May 6, 1852, and organized on January 10, 1853. The purpose of the line was to provide a rail link from Huntingdon to Bedford, and to provide a competitive alternate route to local coal producers to break the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad&#x27;s monopoly on coal that was being shipped from the Cumberland, Maryland, area. The existence of high quality semi-bituminous coal in the Broad Top Mountain region was known since colonial times. Before the railroad, wagon or pole barge was the only practical method of bringing the coal from the remote region to market.

The 31 mile portion of the main line from Huntingdon to Hopewell, via Saxton and Riddlesburg, was completed in 1855. On February 3, 1859, the Bedford Railroad Company was chartered to provide a railroad connection for Bedford, and was incorporated February 19, 1859. This company, with financial assistance from the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR), built a line from Mount Dallas to Hopewell in July 1863, connecting with the H&amp;BTM. It was merged into the H&amp;BTM on August 17, 1864. Total track mileage at the company&#x27;s height was just over 72 miles.

===Coal branches===
A number of branches were built to serve the Broad Top coal fields, beginning as soon as the railroad reached the area in 1853–1855.
* Shoups Run Branch — from Saxton to Broad Top City via Coalmont and Dudley. It was extended to Barnettstown, near Dudley, in 1856. Passenger service was operated on this branch between 1859 and 1917, from Saxton to Dudley only.
* Coalmont Branch — from Coalmont to Hickory Hill
* Miller&#x27;s Run Branch — from Shoups Branch between Coalmont and Dudley to Kenrock and beyond along Miller&#x27;s Run. It was built in 1908.
* Six Mile Run Branch — from Riddlesburg to North Point via Defiance and Coaldale The branch was opened to Defiance in 1862 and subsequently extended.
* Shreeves Run Branch — from North Point to Finleyville
* Sandy Run Branch — from Hopewell to the Garlick Mine via Langdondale
* Long&#x27;s Run Branch — from Langdondale to Kearney. The branch was opened in 1883.
* Kimber Run Branch — from south of Hopewell at the confluence of Kimber Run and the Raystown Branch of the Juniata River up Broad Top Mountain. This branch lasted only a few years at the beginning of the 20th century.

===Interchanges===
The H&amp;BTM connected with the PRR at Huntingdon, and with the Bedford and Bridgeport Railroad at Mount Dallas. It operated the B&amp;B via lease in 1871, however the PRR, which had provided the majority of financial backing for the B&amp;B&#x27;s construction, took over operation of the B&amp;B the following year. The H&amp;BTM would continue to operate passenger service via trackage rights to Bedford over the B&amp;B until 1953, but from 1872 onwards, its southern freight terminus was at Mount Dallas. The B&amp;B was under complete control of the PRR from 1872 onwards but was separated from the contiguous PRR system until 1910, when they completed their Bedford Division between Cessna and Brookes Mills. The H&amp;BTM served as a PRR bridge line for traffic between its two end points until that time. After 1910, the majority of bridge traffic was shifted to the PRR&#x27;s Bedford Division.

The H&amp;BTM also supported some minor industrial lines, mostly logging railroads and iron ore, as well as the coal-hauling Juniata and Southern Railway, which connected at Marklesburg. Glendale, the terminus of the Sandy Run Branch, originally was an interchange with the narrow gauge Reichley Brothers logging railroad, which operated near Wells Tannery in Fulton County. When the branch was extended from Glendale up Broad Top Mountain in the early 1920s to access the Garlick Mine, the Reichleys abandoned their right of way on the western slope of the mountain and moved their interchange point to the community of Reichley, the location of the brothers&#x27; sawmill.

Though similar in name, there was no formal interchange connection or business relationship between the H&amp;BTM and the narrow gauge East Broad Top Railroad. Through the Juniata and Southern Railroad, a physical connection existed at Jacobs, but its doubtful that any cargo was exchanged between the two railroads.

===Later history===
The railroad was at its height in the last decades of the 19th century and the pre-World War I period of the 20th century. The completion of the Bedford Division allowed the PRR to divert most of the lucrative through traffic from the Cumberland area away from the H&amp;BTM. The decline of the Broad Top Mountain coal fields, the maturity of construction bonds, and many ill-advised right of way improvements and equipment purchases took their financial toll. The Huntingdon and Broad Top Mountain Railroad declared bankruptcy on October 11, 1953, operated its last passenger train in November 1953 and ceased operations on March 31, 1954.

The Everett Railroad took over the southernmost four miles of H&amp;BTM trackage, between Tatesville and Mount Dallas on April 1, 1954. They operated until 1982, when they closed due to Conrail&#x27;s abandonment of the remainder of the Bedford Division, by then known as the Conrail&#x27;s Bedford and Mount Dallas Branches. The trackage was removed in 1985.

The railroad&#x27;s trackage in Huntingdon, Pennsylvania was sold to the Pennsylvania Railroad. The PRR and its successors Penn Central (PC) and Conrail (CR) operated the track as a means of accessing an industrial park in the Smithfield portion of Huntingdon. Though the northern portion of the trackage remains, it has not been used since the late 1990s.

*Note all engine after the second 29 &amp; 28 (listed) had the same 66-inch boilers from Baldwin to make repairs easier
== Preservation ==
H&amp;BTM&#x27;s only surviving locomotive is Number 38, a 1927 Baldwin Locomotive Works 2-8-0. After the H&amp;BTM closed, this locomotive was sold to the Rail City Historical Museum in Sandy Creek, New York. Railway Post Office car 5436, coach 27, caboose 17, and various pieces of tools and other hardware were also acquired and preserved by the museum. Locomotive No. 38 would later be sold to the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad, which restored it to service, and finally, Sloan Cornell of the Gettysburg Railroad. The locomotive was transferred to Cornell&#x27;s Knox and Kane Railroad at Marienville, Pennsylvania in the 1980s. After it was removed from tourist service in the 1990s, No. 38 was stored at the Marienville enginehouse, where it received a new tender and H&amp;BT lettering. After the K&amp;K ceased tourist operations, it was moved to Kane, Pennsylvania and stored inside the railroad&#x27;s expanded enginehouse. However, that structure was burnt in an arson-related fire on March 16, 2008, damaging 38 in the process. The locomotive was sold at auction to Alan Maples, the owner of the Everett Railroad on October 10, 2008, and is starting to be restored as of 2022.

The last surviving piece of revenue freight equipment was G-22 gondola 3807, which had been sold to the Bellefonte Central Railroad in the late 1930s. Converted to a work car, it was scrapped in the 1980s.

Caboose 15 is at the Williams Grove Historical Steam Association&#x27;s park in Williams Grove, Pennsylvania. Caboose 16 is now at the Railroad Museum of Pennsylvania previously owned by Larry Williams of Saxton, Pa who owns H&amp;BT engine 31&#x27;s Baldwin Number plate. Caboose 17 survived after Rail City&#x27;s closure; its current whereabouts are unknown, although it is believed to be in New England. RPO 5436 was scrapped on the grounds of Rail City. Coach 27 was acquired by the Central New York Chapter of the National Railway Historical Society and is preserved at their Central Square Station Museum.

Depots still exist at Riddlesburg (converted to a church), Everett (along with the separate freight house structure), Hopewell and Dudley (the latter being the depot from Broad Top City, Pennsylvania. The Dudley water tank, an enclosed wooden structure, remains as well.

<text>Niardo (Camunian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy.

Neighbouring comuni are Braone, Breno, Losine and Prestine.

It was the birthplace of Saint Obitius (Obizio), who is one of the town&#x27;s patron saints.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Data from the weather station Niardo indicate, based on 33 years of data from 1961 to 1990, the temperature during the coldest month, January, averaged , while that of the warmest month, July, was .

==History==

No document certifying the country of origin clearly Niardo, but its origins are deduced from the ancient origin gives some expressions in the local dialect, which are clearly due to the language of Celtic and Latin. The Roman presence is evidenced by some place names that have reached our days without major distortions such as place names Sommavilla (Imavillae)

The presence of the Lombards, in the post-Roman and medieval times is rather well established so that the name of this country (Niward) dates from this period.

In the 11th century fighting began between Guelphs and Ghibellines, and up to 1397 fights, feuds, revenge and massacre between the Guelphs and Ghibellines remained deeply rooted in the everyday relations between the two factions and continued even when the whole came under Vallecamonica the Visconti. These unscrupulous and enterprising Milanese gentlemen were reaching the zenith of their power and their lands now included much of northern Italy. In their expansion policy immediately took advantage of the presence of delegates and the Milanese troops in Vallecamonica called to play a role as peacemakers and arbitrators, and soon became the new rulers of the area. Policy of the Visconti was almost immediately marked by encouraging the Ghibelline party to oppose the claims, the Alpine valleys of Brescia, the Curia, which was expropriated by almost all his feudal prerogatives that were bestowed to those families of local nobles who had been accommodating approach to the new master.

The famous general peace that had held the bridge of Minerva in Breno, pompously and solemnly ratified with great oaths in 1397, was short lived and feuds took up so much that in 1403, the fortress of Niardo, which stood on the &quot;Dos del Castel&quot;, became the refuge of the usual Baroncino Nobili from Lozio, which often away from their land in the narrow and well defended Lozio valley, just niardese departed from the castle for his bloody expeditions and for the numerous raids that many deaths and property damage produced between the Ghibellines.

In 1428 the Republic of Venice, after several clashes with the forces of the Duchy of Milan, won the Vallecamonica. The events of this war Milanese-Veneto long and continued with varying fortunes, the Valley was conquered in 1438 by Milan, Venice regained the same year, the riperse in 1453, but then, with the Peace of Lodi, all the valleys of Brescia finally passed under the Republic of San Marco that he applied immediately to its constitution and its laws that greatly limited the power of feudal lords and noble families.

In 1530, for six months, plague struck the area and there were numerous victims among the inhabitants of Niardo. Exactly one hundred years later, in 1630 the country was invaded by hordes of Landsknecht that spread through the valley to the plain, left, as a remembrance of their fatal passage, in addition to the complete dispossession of property and many acts of violence, even the terrible and famous pestilential epidemic, which lasted almost two years and that many victims had reduced by almost one third of the inhabitants of the country.
In 1630 to fight the Landsknecht, Giovanni Maria Bondioni sat at the head of a citizen army to stop the mercenaries sent by Ferdinand II. Few were the aid from other countries and especially from the Republic of Venice.
In 1797 the Venetian Republic fell with the arrival of Napoleon&#x27;s Campaign In Italy, the Principality of Niardo was incorporated in French Empire.
During the battle of Waterloo residents of Niardo advantage to rebel against the French invaders, supporting the forces of the Seventh Coalition, the idea of obtaining some advantage after the defeat of Napoleon.
Unfortunately it was not so, Niardo was incorporated in the Habsburg Empire without getting any privileges, and lost all traces on the principality

In 1815, 1816 and in 1817 these social ills and economic destroyed much of the social fabric of the valley and perhaps were the initial condition for the emergence of terrible epidemics (typhus, smallpox, etc.) which cut many inhabitants.
Niardo then became part of the Lombard-Venetian kingdom, for that very reason during the Italian Risorgimento, niardesi supported the intervention of Savoy at the expense of Austria
Niardo was annexed to the Kingdom of Italy in 1859

In the 20th century, the small country has followed the historical and political events of the neighboring villages, and only to the 1970s a good building development, especially towards the south-west and in areas overlooking the main road of the valley, the ancient village that has expanded in its historical center preserves the homes of the ancient and noble families niardesi.

In 1986 the country suffered a tremendous flood which killed 2 people.

<text>In computer graphics, a shader is a computer program that calculates the appropriate levels of light, darkness, and color during the rendering of a 3D scene—a process known as &quot;shading&quot;. Shaders have evolved to perform a variety of specialized functions in computer graphics special effects and video post-processing, as well as general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.

Traditional shaders calculate rendering effects on graphics hardware with a high degree of flexibility. Most shaders are coded for (and run on) a graphics processing unit (GPU), though this is not a strict requirement. &quot;Shading languages&quot; are used to program the GPU&#x27;s rendering pipeline, which has mostly superseded the fixed-function pipeline of the past that only allowed for common geometry transforming and pixel-shading functions; with shaders, customized effects can be used. The position and color (hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast) of all pixels, vertices, and/or textures used to construct a final rendered image can be altered using algorithms defined in a shader, and can be modified by external variables or textures introduced by the computer program calling the shader.

Shaders are used widely in cinema post-processing, computer-generated imagery, and video games to produce a range of effects. Beyond simple lighting models, more complex uses of shaders include: altering the hue, saturation, brightness (HSL/HSV) or contrast of an image; producing blur, light bloom, volumetric lighting, normal mapping (for depth effects), bokeh, cel shading, posterization, bump mapping, distortion, chroma keying (for so-called &quot;bluescreen/greenscreen&quot; effects), edge and motion detection, as well as psychedelic effects such as those seen in the demoscene.

== History ==
This use of the term &quot;shader&quot; was introduced to the public by Pixar with version 3.0 of their RenderMan Interface Specification, originally published in May 1988.

As graphics processing units evolved, major graphics software libraries such as OpenGL and Direct3D began to support shaders. The first shader-capable GPUs only supported pixel shading, but vertex shaders were quickly introduced once developers realized the power of shaders. The first video card with a programmable pixel shader was the Nvidia GeForce 3 (NV20), released in 2001. Geometry shaders were introduced with Direct3D 10 and OpenGL 3.2. Eventually, graphics hardware evolved toward a unified shader model.

== Design ==
Shaders are simple programs that describe the traits of either a vertex or a pixel. Vertex shaders describe the attributes (position, texture coordinates, colors, etc.) of a vertex, while pixel shaders describe the traits (color, z-depth and alpha value) of a pixel. A vertex shader is called for each vertex in a primitive (possibly after tessellation); thus one vertex in, one (updated) vertex out. Each vertex is then rendered as a series of pixels onto a surface (block of memory) that will eventually be sent to the screen.

Shaders replace a section of the graphics hardware typically called the Fixed Function Pipeline (FFP), so-called because it performs lighting and texture mapping in a hard-coded manner. Shaders provide a programmable alternative to this hard-coded approach.

The basic graphics pipeline is as follows:

* The CPU sends instructions (compiled shading language programs) and geometry data to the graphics processing unit, located on the graphics card.
* Within the vertex shader, the geometry is transformed.
* If a geometry shader is in the graphics processing unit and active, some changes of the geometries in the scene are performed.
* If a tessellation shader is in the graphics processing unit and active, the geometries in the scene can be subdivided.
* The calculated geometry is triangulated (subdivided into triangles).
* Triangles are broken down into fragment quads (one fragment quad is a 2 × 2 fragment primitive).
* Fragment quads are modified according to the fragment shader.
* The depth test is performed; fragments that pass will get written to the screen and might get blended into the frame buffer.

The graphic pipeline uses these steps in order to transform three-dimensional (or two-dimensional) data into useful two-dimensional data for displaying. In general, this is a large pixel matrix or &quot;frame buffer&quot;.

== Types ==
There are three types of shaders in common use (pixel, vertex, and geometry shaders), with several more recently added. While older graphics cards utilize separate processing units for each shader type, newer cards feature unified shaders which are capable of executing any type of shader. This allows graphics cards to make more efficient use of processing power.

=== 2D shaders ===
2D shaders act on digital images, also called &quot;textures&quot; in the field of computer graphics. They modify attributes of pixels. 2D shaders may take part in rendering 3D geometry. Currently the only type of 2D shader is a pixel shader.

==== Pixel shaders ====
Pixel shaders, also known as fragment shaders, compute color and other attributes of each &quot;fragment&quot;: a unit of rendering work affecting at most a single output pixel. The simplest kinds of pixel shaders output one screen pixel as a color value; more complex shaders with multiple inputs/outputs are also possible. Pixel shaders range from simply always outputting the same color, to applying a lighting value, to doing bump mapping, shadows, specular highlights, translucency and other phenomena. They can alter the depth of the fragment (for Z-buffering), or output more than one color if multiple render targets are active. In 3D graphics, a pixel shader alone cannot produce some kinds of complex effects because it operates only on a single fragment, without knowledge of a scene&#x27;s geometry (i.e. vertex data). However, pixel shaders do have knowledge of the screen coordinate being drawn, and can sample the screen and nearby pixels if the contents of the entire screen are passed as a texture to the shader. This technique can enable a wide variety of two-dimensional postprocessing effects such as blur, or edge detection/enhancement for cartoon/cel shaders. Pixel shaders may also be applied in &quot;intermediate&quot; stages to any two-dimensional images—sprites or textures—in the pipeline, whereas vertex shaders always require a 3D scene. For instance, a pixel shader is the only kind of shader that can act as a postprocessor or filter for a video stream after it has been rasterized.

=== 3D shaders ===
3D shaders act on 3D models or other geometry but may also access the colors and textures used to draw the model or mesh. Vertex shaders are the oldest type of 3D shader, generally making modifications on a per-vertex basis. Newer geometry shaders can generate new vertices from within the shader. Tessellation shaders are the newest 3D shaders; they act on batches of vertices all at once to add detail—such as subdividing a model into smaller groups of triangles or other primitives at runtime, to improve things like curves and bumps, or change other attributes.

==== Vertex shaders ====
Vertex shaders are the most established and common kind of 3D shader and are run once for each vertex given to the graphics processor. The purpose is to transform each vertex&#x27;s 3D position in virtual space to the 2D coordinate at which it appears on the screen (as well as a depth value for the Z-buffer). Vertex shaders can manipulate properties such as position, color and texture coordinates, but cannot create new vertices. The output of the vertex shader goes to the next stage in the pipeline, which is either a geometry shader if present, or the rasterizer. Vertex shaders can enable powerful control over the details of position, movement, lighting, and color in any scene involving 3D models.

==== Geometry shaders ====
Geometry shaders were introduced in Direct3D 10 and OpenGL 3.2; formerly available in OpenGL 2.0+ with the use of extensions. This type of shader can generate new graphics primitives, such as points, lines, and triangles, from those primitives that were sent to the beginning of the graphics pipeline.

Geometry shader programs are executed after vertex shaders. They take as input a whole primitive, possibly with adjacency information. For example, when operating on triangles, the three vertices are the geometry shader&#x27;s input. The shader can then emit zero or more primitives, which are rasterized and their fragments ultimately passed to a pixel shader.

Typical uses of a geometry shader include point sprite generation, geometry tessellation, shadow volume extrusion, and single pass rendering to a cube map. A typical real-world example of the benefits of geometry shaders would be automatic mesh complexity modification. A series of line strips representing control points for a curve are passed to the geometry shader and depending on the complexity required the shader can automatically generate extra lines each of which provides a better approximation of a curve.

==== Tessellation shaders ====
As of OpenGL 4.0 and Direct3D 11, a new shader class called a tessellation shader has been added. It adds two new shader stages to the traditional model: tessellation control shaders (also known as hull shaders) and tessellation evaluation shaders (also known as Domain Shaders), which together allow for simpler meshes to be subdivided into finer meshes at run-time according to a mathematical function. The function can be related to a variety of variables, most notably the distance from the viewing camera to allow active level-of-detail scaling. This allows objects close to the camera to have fine detail, while further away ones can have more coarse meshes, yet seem comparable in quality. It also can drastically reduce required mesh bandwidth by allowing meshes to be refined once inside the shader units instead of downsampling very complex ones from memory. Some algorithms can upsample any arbitrary mesh, while others allow for &quot;hinting&quot; in meshes to dictate the most characteristic vertices and edges.

==== Primitive and Mesh shaders ====
Circa 2017, the AMD Vega microarchitecture added support for a new shader stage—primitive shaders—somewhat akin to compute shaders with access to the data necessary to process geometry. 

Nvidia introduced mesh and task shaders with its Turing microarchitecture in 2018 which are also modelled after compute shaders. Nvidia Turing is the world&#x27;s first GPU microarchitecture that supports mesh shading through DirectX 12 Ultimate API, several months before Ampere RTX 30 series was released.

In 2020, AMD and Nvidia released RDNA 2 and Ampere microarchitectures which both support mesh shading through DirectX 12 Ultimate. These mesh shaders allow the GPU to handle more complex algorithms, offloading more work from the CPU to the GPU, and in algorithm intense rendering, increasing the frame rate of or number of triangles in a scene by an order of magnitude. Intel announced that Intel Arc Alchemist GPUs shipping in Q1 2022 will support mesh shaders.

=== Unified shaders ===
Unified shader is the combination of 2D shader and 3D shader. NVIDIA called &quot;unified shaders&quot; as &quot;CUDA cores&quot;; AMD called this as &quot;shader cores&quot;; while Intel called this as &quot;ALU cores&quot;.

=== Compute shaders ===
Compute shaders are not limited to graphics applications, but use the same execution resources for GPGPU. They may be used in graphics pipelines e.g. for additional stages in animation or lighting algorithms (e.g. tiled forward rendering). Some rendering APIs allow compute shaders to easily share data resources with the graphics pipeline.

=== Ray tracing shaders ===
Ray tracing shaders are supported by Microsoft via DirectX Raytracing, by Khronos Group via Vulkan, GLSL, and SPIR-V, by Apple via Metal. NVIDIA and AMD called &quot;ray tracing shaders&quot; as &quot;ray tracing cores&quot;.

=== Tensor shaders ===
Tensor shaders may be integrated in NPUs or GPUs. Tensor shaders are supported by Microsoft via DirectML, by Khronos Group via OpenVX, by Apple via Core ML, by Google via TensorFlow, by Linux Foundation via ONNX. NVIDIA and AMD called &quot;tensor shaders&quot; as &quot;tensor cores&quot;.

== Parallel processing ==
Shaders are written to apply transformations to a large set of elements at a time, for example, to each pixel in an area of the screen, or for every vertex of a model. This is well suited to parallel processing, and most modern GPUs have multiple shader pipelines to facilitate this, vastly improving computation throughput.

A programming model with shaders is similar to a higher order function for rendering, taking the shaders as arguments, and providing a specific dataflow between intermediate results, enabling both data parallelism (across pixels, vertices etc.) and pipeline parallelism (between stages). (see also map reduce).

== Programming ==
The language in which shaders are programmed depends on the target environment. The official OpenGL and OpenGL ES shading language is OpenGL Shading Language, also known as GLSL, and the official Direct3D shading language is High Level Shader Language, also known as HLSL. Cg, a third-party shading language which outputs both OpenGL and Direct3D shaders, was developed by Nvidia; however since 2012 it has been deprecated. Apple released its own shading language called Metal Shading Language as part of the Metal framework.

=== GUI shader editors ===

Modern video game development platforms such as Unity, Unreal Engine and Godot increasingly include node-based editors that can create shaders without the need for actual code; the user is instead presented with a directed graph of connected nodes that allow users to direct various textures, maps, and mathematical functions into output values like the diffuse color, the specular color and intensity, roughness/metalness, height, normal, and so on. Automatic compilation then turns the graph into an actual, compiled shader.

<text>Sercial is the name of a white grape grown in Portugal, especially on the island of Madeira. It has given its name to the driest of the four classic varieties of Madeira fortified wine.

The grape is grown in diminishing quantities at the southern end of the island. After &quot;phylloxera&quot; devastated Madeira&#x27;s vineyards, the grape became more common on the mainland, where it is known as Esgana or Esgana Cão, meaning respectively Strangler or Dog Strangler. Its late ripening allows it to retain its characteristic acidity.
The anglicised name Sercial came to be associated with the Madeira style rather than the grape variety, being the lightest, most acidic and delicate expression of Madeira that takes the longest to mature. EU rules for varietal names on wine labels now require Madeiras labelled Sercial to be made from minimum 85% Sercial.

For obscure reasons, Sercial was the name given to the Gascony grape Ondenc when it was planted in Australia.

<text>Waglan Island is a member of the Po Toi group of islands in Hong Kong. Wagan Lighthouse, a declared monument dating to 1893 stands there. Since 1989 Wagan lighthouse is automated and Wagan Island is uninhabited. The island also hosts a ground of meteorological observation and recording for the Hong Kong Observatory.

==Climate==

== History ==

=== Pre-1900 ===
Before the 1840s, there was not much sea traffic in Hong Kong. But after the Treaties of Nanking, Peking and Tientsin from 1842-1860, the Qing government was forced to open more trading ports. Hong Kong was one such port that became strategic for merchants arriving from Europe, hence lighthouses were needed to guide ships safely to port.

Wagan Lighthouse entered service in 9th of May 1893, the layout of Waglan Island Lighthouse was designed by David Marr Henderson, Engineer in Chief of the Chinese Maritime Customs. The original plan included the lighthouse, living quarters, a fresh water collection tank, and a derrick used to transport people and cargo onto the island. It was managed by the Chinese Maritime Customs from Shanghai. 

Before Wagan Lighthouse entered service in 9th of May 1893, Wagan Island was an uninhabited island. After the lighthouse&#x27;s operation there have been a number of keepers who lived in Waglan Island. The working team who managed the lighthouse consisted of one principal Lighthouse Keeper, two lighthouse keepers, five attendants (who did chores such as grass cutting and cleaning), and one cook. The team would spent one month on Waglan which was followed by one week&#x27;s leave. Initially, German keepers were used.

=== 1900 - World War II ===
In 1 March 1901, Waglan island was transferred to the British after the Lease of New Territories and outlying islands in 1898. The Hong Kong British Government paid $2,943.60 to the Qing government for the furniture and maintenance of the lighthouse. Employing 3 Europeans and assisted by 6 Chinese as the working team. In the coming years, a saluting battery featuring three 18 pounder cannons was installed for fog signals and defense.

In 1923 a twin type Diaphone was installed as a replacement to the cannons&#x27; fog signal. It produced a two tone blast, an upper tone followed by a full steady low tone of equal or greater duration than the first tone. The Diaphone was powered a with diesel engine and compressor, and could be heard 5 miles away in the worst fog.

=== World War II ===
In Dec 1941, in preparation of World War II, the original lens and lamp lens, along with the communication equipment were destroyed by the British Navy. On 13 Dec 10:30 am the keeper and staff were evacuated and taken to Aberdeen. Subsequently after the Japanese invasion of Hong Kong, Japanese troops were stationed on the island. Waglan Island Lighthouse was extensively damaged by the Japanese and the aerial bombings by Allied aircraft during World War II.

=== Post-war ===
In 1945 after World War II the lighthouse resumed operations, installing a temporary light for the purpose. In January 1946, the Hong Kong Civil Affairs Committee approved HK$2,050,000 for the reconstruction and modernization of Waglan Lighthouse and it&#x27;s facilities.

As a result of the funding, in 1950 a new light was put into service. Dubbed &quot;World&#x27;s most modern lighthouse&quot; by SCMP, it was assembled from parts totaling 25 tonnes, ordered from two British companies and the AGA firm in Sweden. from 1950 to 1960 Many facilities were also improved or built in the lighthouse compound. Including: a new building to house 25-ton generator and machines (1950); Wireless Communication equipment (1950s); three new water tanks (1953); The Royal Observatory, Cable &amp; Wireless Ltd. buildings, Radio and Weather Station (1952); a new fog horn system on top of the engine room (1955). Damaged air raid shelter tunnels were also back-filled. 

==Waglan lighthouse==

The Waglan Lighthouse on Waglan Island has been listed as a declared monument of Hong Kong since 2000. It commenced operation in 1893; it is one of the five surviving pre-war lighthouses in Hong Kong.

The lighthouse itself was built by Paris lighthouse makers Barbier, Bénard &amp; Turenne as one of two identical lights for the Chinese Maritime Customs Marine Department (the other was Beiyushan Lighthouse). Both were some of the first lighthouses in the world to use a new mercury bath rotating lens design that allowed an 8 tonne first order lens to be rotated with the push of a finger. They were constructed of cast iron, disassembled and shipped out for reassembly in their chosen locations.

During the 1930s, two Chinese became second class lighthouse keepers: Wong Kai Chung from 1930 and Leung Chiu Tung from 1933. Both of them have been stationed at Gap Rock lighthouse as apprentices before being promoted and transferred to Waglan Lighthouse.

<doc id="1090115" wikidata="Q2283248" url="?curid=1090115" title="Clogher">
<text>Clogher (; , ) is a village and civil parish in the border area of south County Tyrone, Northern Ireland. It lies on the River Blackwater, 5.8 miles from the border crossing to County Monaghan. It stands on the townlands of Clogher Demesne and Clogher Tenements. The 2011 Census recorded a population of 717. The civil parish of Clogher covers areas of County Fermanagh as well as County Tyrone.

==History==
Clogher is home to the provincial office in Northern Ireland for the congregation of the Sisters of Mercy (Roman Catholic order of nuns). From 1971-1991 The Mercy Order employed some of their nuns at St Macartan&#x27;s Primary School following the leave of the order of saint louis as the school was actually founded by the Sisters of St Louis in the 1930s due to the high demand for primary Catholic education in the Clogher area. The Sisters of Mercy also had ownership of the St Macartan&#x27;s nursing and dementia care home until recent years where they decided to hand the nursing home over to the NHS. The sisters of Saint Louis left Clogher in the 1970s and the Mercy Order continued their work. However, In the late 1980s the Sisters of Mercy were phased out of the school and retired from the job of teaching at St Macartan&#x27;s School due to falling numbers of nuns and as a newer curriculum had been introduced in Northern Ireland it meant they needed more qualifications. They have since severed most ties with the St Macartan&#x27;s Convent School but still live in the Convent of Mercy on the Ballagh Road, Clogher, next to the St Macartan&#x27;s nursing home.

The name &quot;Clochar&quot; refers to something made of stone (&#x27;cloch&#x27; is the Irish word for &#x27;stone&#x27; and can be anglicised as &#x27;cloch&#x27;, &#x27;clogh&#x27; or &#x27;clough&#x27;); probably on the site of the medieval monastery or a nearby ringfort. Archaeological remains from before the 5th century have been found in the vicinity. Clogher is said to have been the location of a gold-covered pagan oracle stone named Cermand Cestach. The story goes that &quot;Cloch-Ór (Golden Stone), may have been a ceremonial or oracle stone (see Cenn Cruaich and Omphalos) originally covered in gold sacred to the druids...given to Mac Cairthinn by an old pagan noble (Cairpre, the father of St Tigernach of Clones), who had harassed him in every possible way until the saint&#x27;s patient love won the local ruler to the faith.&quot; The stone is recorded as being &quot;a curiosity in the porch of the Cathedral of Clogher&quot; in the time of Annalist Cathal Maguire of Fermanagh in the late 15th century. Tighernach of Clones, later succeeded St. Mac Cairthinn as Bishop of Clogher.

Clogher has been a religious center since St. Patrick&#x27;s time and likely before. St. Aedh Mac Cairthinn of Clogher (c. 430–505 AD) an early disciple and companion of Saint Patrick founded a monastery at the site, which later the Synod of Rathbreasail recognised as an episcopal see. The Cathedral Church of Saint Macartan in the village is now one of two cathedrals of the Church of Ireland diocese of Clogher; the other is at Enniskillen. The Roman Catholic Diocese of Clogher has its cathedral in Monaghan. The meetinghouse of Clogher Presbyterian church is outside the village in the townland of Carntall. The &quot;City of Clogher&quot; was a rotten borough in the Parliament of Ireland in the gift of the Protestant bishop. The village also gives its name to the Barony of Clogher, one of the original four baronies of County Tyrone.

==Transport==
Clogher railway station (on the narrow gauge Clogher Valley Railway) opened on 2 May 1887, but finally closed on 1 January 1942.

Clogher also has Ulsterbus services to Omagh and on the 261/X261 between Belfast and Enniskillen.

==Sport==
Clogher Cricket Club plays in the NCU Senior League. The local Gaelic Athletic Association club is An Clochar Éire Óg.

==Education==
The local primary schools include Carntall Primary School (which has a Protestant ethos) and St. Macartan&#x27;s Convent Primary School (established by the Sisters of Saint Louis and has a Roman Catholic ethos). In 1932, the sisters of saint louis were invited to Clogher by request of the Bishop to open a catholic primary school and convent. In the following years, Saint Macartans convent school was established for the catholic children of Clogher and by 1935 the school was very successful. The sisters of saint louis continued to work in saint macartans up until 1972 when the sisters decided to leave Clogher and move to a bigger convent in County Monaghan.Not long after, the sisters of mercy continued the work of the Louis nuns up until 1991 when the sisters of mercy handed the ownership of saint macartans convent school over to the local catholic parish of Clogher. Since then, the sisters live in the convent of mercy on the Ballagh road, Clogher. ).

<doc id="1090118" wikidata="Q1093602" url="?curid=1090118" title="Citroën C6">
<text>The Citroën C6 is an executive car (E) produced by the French car maker Citroën from 2005 to 2012. Production started up again in China in 2016, before ending in 2023. The Citroën C6 was inspired by the Citroën C6 Lignage concept car with fastback-saloon like styling. 

The C6 was inspired by the Citroën C6 Lignage prototype, which was first shown at the Geneva Motor Show in the spring of 1999, but can be differentiated due to a few minor details (such as the lack of suicide doors, which were present in the concept model). The C6 was intended to serve as a replacement for the late Citroën XM, and the company was intent on launching it before the end of the year 2000.

==History==
At the time, it was hoped that the C6 would go into production by the end of 2000, serving as the replacement for the ageing XM, which was first produced in May of 1989.

In July 2007, &quot;Car&quot; ran a 2.7 litre V6 on its long term fleet and rated it for its &quot;waftability&quot; and comfortable interior, but felt it was a car that the driver needed time to adjust to. In isolation, the car&#x27;s acceleration was regarded as &quot;effortless&quot; but not up to the standards set by similarly priced and equipped vehicles, such as the BMW 5 series of the era.

==Design==

The Citroën C6 Lignage concept formed the basis of the Citroën C6, which was launched in November 2005, five years later than Citroën had originally planned. The XM ceased production in June 2000, and the first C6 rolled off the production line almost six years later.

===Features===

The C6 is powered by either a 3.0 L &quot;ES9&quot; V6 producing or a 2.7 L V6 &quot;HDi&quot; diesel producing .

In October 2006 a 2.2 L &quot;HDi&quot; producing with FAP, four cylinders, and a dual turbo was introduced. Land Rover used the DW12 engine in the Freelander 2 and Range Rover Evoque, where it generates .

In June 2009, the new 3.0 L V6 &quot;HDi&quot; diesel producing replaced the 2.7 L V6 HDi.

The C6 has a fastback saloon profile, which is due in part to the concave rear window that resembles the Citroën CX. However, the C6 is a conventional saloon with a traditional trunk, and not a hatchback like the XM, its predecessor.

The C6 was aimed as a stylish alternative to executive cars, like the BMW 5 Series and the Audi A6, and it has been described as a &quot;spaceship that rides on air&quot;, &quot;charmingly idiosyncratic&quot; and &quot;refreshingly different&quot;.

Citroën hoped that the C6&#x27;s selling point would be its innovative technology, including a heads-up display, a lane departure warning system, xenon directional headlamps (also available on the Citroën C4 and Citroën C5), Hydractive 3+ suspension with electronically controlled springing and damping, and a rear spoiler which automatically adjusts to speed and braking.

The C6 was the first car to obtain four stars in the pedestrian test rating of EuroNCAP, due to the inventive design, where the bonnet pops up by 65 mm using a pyrotechnic mechanism if a person/animal is hit, thus increasing the gap between the deformable bonnet, and the non deformable engine components below.

On an episode of &quot;Top Gear&quot;, Jeremy Clarkson tested the C6&#x27;s Hydractive suspension by mounting a camera on it and driving it on the infield of England&#x27;s Towcester Racecourse while filming a horse race. Despite the bumps and potholes on the infield, the C6 managed to provide a comfortable ride and stable video coverage of the race while moving at . At the same time, a BMW 5 Series (with the &quot;M Sport&quot; package) performed the same test, but its suspension was unable to keep the camera upright.

The C6 immediately became a prominent vehicle among the fleet of executive cars at the Élysée Palace. Former Presidents of France, Jacques Chirac and Nicolas Sarkozy, have chosen the Citroën C6 as their official car. Chirac, in particular, used a pre-series car before the model was introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;drive.com.au/&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worldwide production and sales figures==
At launch, sales expectations across the model&#x27;s lifespan were given as 20,000 per year. In July 2008, the C6 car configurator on Citroën UK&#x27;s website no longer offered black as a colour choice for the popular Exclusive trim levels.

By October 2008, the manual transmission and the intermediate Lignage specification were no longer offered. Polar white was added to the colour options (replacing Deep Red). The standard navigation system, named until then &quot;NaviDrive&quot;, was renamed &quot;Concert Pack&quot;. The 3.0 V6 petrol engine was discontinued in February 2009 – only the 2.2 and 2.7 HDi options with six speed automatic gearboxes were offered, in base C6 or C6 Exclusive trim. In June 2009, the 2.7 HDi engine was replaced by the new 3.0 V6 HDi.

As of 2010, only the 3.0 HDi (240) Exclusive trim was offered in some markets, such as the United Kingdom. Options were limited to Sunroof, Lounge Pack (TGV rear seats) and &quot;WiFi on Board&quot;, a 3G connectivity solution for the car that is little more than a MiFi box and is unrelated to the onboard telephony of the car.

In May 2012 Citroën ceased production of the C6 in right-hand drive. Rumours suggested the C6 was to be replaced by the Citroën DS9, based on the Citroën Numero 9 concept car, which would eventually go into production in 2020. The replacement of the Citroën C6 is the DS 9. Citroën ceased production of the C6 in December 2012, after 23,384 units had been built.
== Citroën C6 (China: 2016–2023) ==


A new car named C6 was sold in China since 2016, and is based on the PSA PF3 platform. It is a sister model of the Dongfeng A9. Prices in China started from ¥189,900 yuan to ¥279,900 yuan. The car is no longer for sale since 2023.

<text>Norman Levinson (August 11, 1912 in Lynn, Massachusetts – October 10, 1975 in Boston) was an American mathematician. Some of his major contributions were in the study of Fourier transforms, complex analysis, non-linear differential equations, number theory, and signal processing. He worked closely with Norbert Wiener in his early career. He joined the faculty of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1937. In 1954, he was awarded the Bôcher Memorial Prize of the American Mathematical Society and in 1971 the Chauvenet Prize (after winning in 1970 the Lester R. Ford Award) of the Mathematical Association of America for his paper &quot;A Motivated Account of an Elementary Proof of the Prime Number Theorem&quot;. In 1974 he published a paper proving that more than a third of the zeros of the Riemann zeta function lie on the critical line, a result later improved to two fifths by Conrey.

He received both his bachelor&#x27;s degree and his master&#x27;s degree in electrical engineering from MIT in 1934, where he had studied under Norbert Wiener and took almost all of the graduate-level courses in mathematics. He received the MIT Redfield Proctor Traveling Fellowship to study at the University of Cambridge, with the assurance that MIT would reward him with a PhD upon his return regardless of whatever he produced at Cambridge. Within the first four months in Cambridge, he had already produced two papers. In 1935, MIT awarded him with the PhD in mathematics.

His death in 1975 was caused by a brain tumor. He was married since 1938; his widow Zipporah died at age 93 in 2009. He had two daughters and four grandchildren. Norman Levinson&#x27;s doctoral students include Raymond Redheffer and Harold Shapiro.

<text>Lam Chau () was an island in Hong Kong. It was one of the two original islands that made up the site of the current Hong Kong International Airport.

The small island lay to the west of Chek Lap Kok and north of Lantau Island. It had an area of and was long. It had a narrow rocky shoreline and small hills (less than tall) covered by vegetation and shrub. Like Chek Lap Kok, geologically Lam Chau consisted of granite.

In the 1990s, the island was flattened and joined with Chek Lap Kok to form the airport island by land reclamation. The former island is now part of the southwest side of the airport grounds, located close to the western end of the south runway.

<text>Golden Cap is a hill and cliff situated on the English Channel coast between Bridport and Charmouth in Dorset, England. At , it is arguably the highest point near the south coast of Great Britain (although the highest point is set back some from the coastline) and is visible for tens of miles along the coastline. It is accessible via a coastal footpath from Seatown, and takes around 40 minutes to reach the summit.

The hill is owned by the National Trust and forms part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site.

The base of the cliff is covered with large boulders, and is popular with fossil collectors. Storms have previously exposed fossilised ammonites and belemnites in the Blue Lias base.

The name derives from the distinctive outcropping of golden greensand rock present at the very top of the cliff.

Behind the cliff is Langdon Wood, a small wood of mainly Corsican Pine, planted in the 1950s, whose trees originate from a nearby copse known as &quot;Eleanor&#x27;s Clump&quot;. Langdon is owned by the National Trust, and encompasses a circular walk of approximately one mile.

As a result of its height, on a clear day views can extend to Portland Bill and to Start Point and Dartmoor in Devon.

<doc id="1090130" wikidata="Q195674" url="?curid=1090130" title="Po Toi">
<text>Po Toi (commonly , originally ) is the main island of the Po Toi Islands and the southernmost island of Hong Kong, with an area of 3.69 km2.

==Name==
It is said that the island used to produce dried seaweeds (), which were shaped like the cattail hassock () used by the monks for sitting; therefore the island was originally called 蒲苔島, the present common name being a corruption. Another explanation states that Po Toi looks like a floating platform () when viewed from a distance on sea. 蒲 is another character meaning &quot;to float&quot; in the local dialect, thus giving the island its name.

==Administration==
Po Toi is a recognized village under the New Territories Small House Policy.

==History==
The island historically had a maximum of about 1,000 fishermen and farmers, whose economic activity consisted mainly of fishing, farming and seaweed harvesting. The population lived mainly in two villages, Chang Shek Pai () and Shan Liu (). The population decreased sharply over the past decades, with the younger generations moving to the city.

==Features==
Po Toi is an important birding hotspot in Hong Kong, with over 350 species recorded. However the numbers are declining like elsewhere in Hong Kong, the rather degraded environmental situation around the village being one of the factors. 

Po Toi is famous for its rock formations, such as the Buddha&#x27;s Palm Cliff (), the Coffin Rock (), the Tortoise Rock () and the Monk Rock ().

Ancient rock carvings on the island, believed to date back to the Bronze Age (around 1500–700 BC), were discovered in the 1960s. They have been listed as declared monuments of Hong Kong since 1979. These may be viewed on a spur-track on the track that runs between the main harbour (Tai Wan), and the lighthouse.

A Tin Hau Temple is located on Po Toi, facing the bay of Tai Wan (). While its construction date is unknown, it is documented that the temple was renovated in 1893.

Mo&#x27;s Old House, or the &quot;Deserted Mansion of Family Mo&quot; (), usually referred to as the &quot;Haunted House&quot;, is a popular venue of &quot;adventure&quot; for the young visitors. The existing house was built in the 1930s at Chang Shek Pai and has fallen into ruins.

There is a lighthouse on Po Toi also known as Nam Kok Tsui Lighthouse.

==Education==
Po Toi Island is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 96, which contains a single aided school, Northern Lamma School on Lamma Island; no government primary schools are in this net.

==Transport==
The island is accessible by kai-to or water taxi. Tsui Wah Ferry provides scheduled ferry services connecting Po Toi Island with Aberdeen and Stanley.

==In fiction==
The climax of John le Carré&#x27;s novel &quot;The Honourable Schoolboy&quot; (the second in the &#x27;Karla trilogy&#x27;, featuring George Smiley) takes place on Po Toi.

<doc id="1090136" wikidata="Q1013257" url="?curid=1090136" title="Cockenzie and Port Seton">
<text>Cockenzie and Port Seton ( ; ) is a unified town in East Lothian, Scotland. It is on the coast of the Firth of Forth, four miles east of Musselburgh. The burgh of Cockenzie was created in 1591 by James VI of Scotland. Port Seton harbour was built by the 11th Lord Seton between 1655 and 1665.

The town had a population of 4,493 in 2001. Since the last census in 2001, many new houses have been built. The population is as of . Cockenzie and Port Seton has continued to grow over the years and is now a dormitory town for Scotland&#x27;s capital city, Edinburgh.

==Power station==
To the west of the town, between Cockenzie and Prestonpans is the site of Cockenzie power station, a large coal-fired power station which was a major employer from the 1960s until it closed in 2013, and enabled the town to survive and prosper. Demolition of the main plant is now complete and ownership transferred to East Lothian Council who are now looking for businesses to occupy the site. Plans for an Energy Park on the site, to be used for the construction and repair of wind turbines, were scrapped in March 2015.

==Fishing==

Cockenzie and Port Seton has grown from what were initially two small fishing villages. The older parts of the town, between the two harbours, retain a more traditional look and feel, similar to many other small fishing villages on the east coast of Scotland. Although the fishing industry has declined in recent years the harbour at Port Seton still retains a small fleet of vessels, mainly fishing for prawns. In the past, Cockenzie was also involved in the salt making and coal mining industries.

== Salt pans ==
The salt pans in Cockenzie were established by George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton around 1630, possibly slightly later. When the salt pans were first established there were twelve. By 1790 there were ten, and by 1840 six pans remaining. It is not known at what point the pan house, the building that contained the salt pans, stopped being used for salt production, but it is known that it was rebuilt at some point in the Victorian period as tenement flats. The tenements were destroyed in the early 1940s, though outer walls remained intact. The salt pans would have been fueled by coal transported to Cockenzie via the Tranent to Cockenzie Waggonway.

Excavation of one of the salt pans, known as the Auld Kirk pan, was undertaken in 2019 by the Waggonway 1722 Project with the assistance of local volunteers. During the first season of excavation, the remains of the tenements were cleared, clearing the way for future excavation. No excavation took place during 2020 because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Excavation resumed in 2021 and revealed the remains of the ash pits, which were a later addition to the pan house built within the original walls. The pits were filled with ash deposits and made of clay brick. They are approximately one metre deep and reach the bedrock. An iron bar was found across one of the pits, which would have supported a grate or grill upon which the coal would have been burnt. The second bar that would have gone across the other ash pit is missing, though the slots in the brick that it would have rested in remain. Large, rectangular pans of brine would have sat above these grates to boil the brine and produce salt. As the coal burned, the ashes would have fallen through the grate and down into the ash pits, where it would later be raked out. This section of the pan house likely dates to between the end of the 18th century and the earlier part of the 19th century. This period of use is the latter of two phases of use and represents the most efficient phase. The use of grates allowed for a much more efficient use of coal than the earlier method, where coal would have simply been burned on the ground.

==Tourism==
To the east of Port Seton there is a large caravan campsite/holiday park at Seton Sands. The promenade area and the creation of a coastal walk, a part of the John Muir Way, have improved the environment in recent years.

To the south east is Seton Collegiate Church, a collegiate church also known as Seton Chapel, an Ancient Monument in the care of Historic Scotland. Next to it was Seton Palace, now Seton Castle.

==Transport==
Cockenzie and Port Seton are served by direct bus links to and from Edinburgh, Prestonpans and Musselburgh. These services are operated by Lothian Buses (routes 26, N26 and X26). The nearest railway station is at Prestonpans.

==Churches==
Cockenzie and Port Seton have several churches of different denominations, including:
*Chalmers Memorial Church (Church of Scotland)
*Old Parish Church (Church of Scotland)
*Methodist Church
*Two Gospel halls

==Leisure==
In 2005, The 3 Harbours Arts Festival was inaugurated by Cockenzie, Port Seton and Prestonpans. It takes place in early June.

In 2006, Cockenzie and Port Seton along with the neighbouring towns of Prestonpans and Longniddry were twinned with the town of Barga, Tuscany, Italy.

The town has a community centre with activities such as a youth club, football pitches and a skatepark within the grounds.

<doc id="1090139" wikidata="Q2342731" url="?curid=1090139" title="Tiptree">
<text>Tiptree is a village and civil parish in the English county of Essex, situated south-west of Colchester and around north-east of London. Surrounding villages include Messing, Tolleshunt Knights, Tolleshunt Major, Layer Marney, Inworth, Birch, Great Braxted, Great Totham and Little Totham.

The placename &#x27;Tiptree&#x27; is first attested in a charter of circa 1225, where it appears as &quot;Typpetre&quot;. The name means &quot;Tippa&#x27;s tree&quot;.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 9,152. The village has been expanding rapidly for several years with large numbers of new houses and estates being built, though it stills retains the title of being a village. The &#x27;village&#x27; status was the subject of a local referendum in 1999 but residents and secondary school pupils rejected town status. Tiptree is amongst the contenders for the title of &#x27;largest village in England&#x27;.

Tiptree has four primary schools: St Luke&#x27;s Church of England Primary school, Milldene Primary School, Tiptree Heath Primary School and Baynard&#x27;s Primary School. Thurstable School provides secondary and sixth form education. Messing Maypole Mill, a Grade II* listed tower mill, and the preserves company Wilkin &amp; Sons, whose products use the village name as part of their brand, are located in the village.

Tiptree is within the City of Colchester and is administered by Tiptree Parish Council, Colchester City Council and Essex County Council. It is within the Parliamentary constituency of Witham.

Tiptree was the site of the Tiptree sneeze, an event that occurred on 22 February 2014 at a concert by the London Central Fellowship Band at St. Luke&#x27;s Parish Church where a trombonist sneezed into his trombone while playing. A video of the event was posted to YouTube and went viral in 2014.
== Nature reserves ==
Tiptree Heath lies to the south of Tiptree. The 25-hectare heath is the largest surviving fragment of heathland in Essex and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Historically the area was a focal point for smugglers, who used the secluded water inlets of Tollesbury, Salcott cum Virley and Mersea, and often hid their contraband within the overgrown heathland. Species found on the heath include Cross-leaved Heather (Erica tetralix), Bell Heather (Erica cinerea) and Ling or Common Heather (Calluna). To help maintain the heath, Dexter cattle are grazed there during the summer and a herd of hardy Exmoor ponies throughout the year. Tiptree Parish Field is a Local Nature Reserve.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward had a population of 7,583 at the 2011 Census.

==Economy==
Tiptree is a brand of fruit preserves manufactured in the village by Wilkin &amp; Sons. The business was founded by the Wilkins family, a local farmers, in 1885.

==Churches==
Within the Church of England, the village is part of the United Benefice of Tolleshunt Knights with Tiptree and Great Braxted.

There are three other churches in the village, Kingsland Church, Tiptree United Reformed Church, and St John Houghton, a Roman Catholic church.

== Transport ==
From about 1904 until 1951 the village was served by the Kelvedon and Tollesbury Light Railway (locally known as the Crab and Winkle Line). It was an early victim of the mid-20th century cutbacks to the British Rail network and Tiptree railway station closed in 1951. The nearest operational railway station is Kelvedon on the main Norwich to London Liverpool Street line.

Today, the village is bisected by the B1022 Colchester to Maldon road, and the B1023 Kelvedon to Tollesbury road. Tiptree is also close to the main A12 trunk road which passes through Essex. Bus services link the village to surrounding towns.

== Notable residents ==

* John Joseph Mechi (1802-1880), silversmith, banker, inventor and Alderman of the City of London; owned, and died at, Tiptree Hall.

<doc id="1090142" wikidata="Q251363" url="?curid=1090142" title="Soko Islands">
<text>The Soko Islands () are a group of islands in Hong Kong. The group consists of Tai A Chau, Siu A Chau and several smaller nearby islands, in the southwesternmost waters of the territory, to the southwest of Lantau Island.

An older name for this island group was &quot;Sok Kwu Kwan To&quot; (Fishing Net Islands).

The islands are mainly composed of granite and a band of rhyodacite. Waters of the island group are brackish due to being in the Pearl River estuary.

==Islands==
The islands of the group are:

* Cheung Muk Tau ()
* Ko Pai ()
* Lung Shuen Pai ()
* Ma Chau ()
* Shek Chau ()
* Siu A Chau ()
* Tai A Chau ()
* Tau Lo Chau ()
* Wan Hau Chau ()
* Yuen Chau ()
* Yuen Kong Chau ()
==History==

=== Prehistoric ===
Stone tools dating from the Neolithic period to Bronze age (c.4500-221 BC) have been found on Tai A Chau during excavations in 1982 and 2005. These include tools such as Drills, Adzes, and Pounders. 

=== Soko Island Villagers ===
Although now uninhabited, the Soko Islands used to be inhabited by fishermen and farmers as early as the 1770s. This is evidenced by the inscribed bells in the small Tin Hau temples on Tai A Chau and Siu A Chau, presented by devotees in 1828 and 1773 respectively. There is also a tomb on Siu A Chau that dates to 1803, the surname Chow () is inscribed on it.

During the late 1950s, the population of Soko Islands was around 65 people. There were three dominant families, the Ng (), Yeung () families of Tai A Chau, and the Chow () family of Siu A Chau. All describe themselves as the direct descendants of the original settlers, who are from a Cantonese or Hakka origin. The main economic activity on the islands was fishing and farming, as well as pig breeding, rice farming, and shrimp paste manufacturing. All trade connections are almost entirely with Cheung Chau, where goods are transported by motor or sailboat. Occasionally Papayas are grown and sold. 

In 1959, one classroom was built to provide education up to a level equivalent fourth grade primary school. At the time, there were 28 pupils, all from Tai A Chau. Students who wish to study further needed to travel to Cheung Chau.

During The 1960s, 350 pigs were donated by the Kadooree Experimental and Extension Farm to boost the pig raising industry in the Soko Islands. Pineapple plantations were also planted as a new export product.

In 1973, a 15,000 sq. ft. jointly owned artificial fish pond was opened to act as a new source of income for the villagers. To celebrate the opening, 400 Carp were transported and released into the pond by army helicopters.

During 1975 the population of the Soko Islands was around 200 people.

=== Tai A Chau Vietnamese Detention Centre ===
During the 1980s, a Vietnamese detention centre was being built to accommodate the waves of Vietnamese fleeing after the fall of Saigon in 1975. This also caused the original villagers to abandon the island.

In 1991, the Tai A Chau Detention Centre (IN59), a refugee camp for Vietnamese boat people, started operation and accommodated thousands of refugees. It was closed in September 1996.

=== Developments after 2000 ===
In 2006, a Low-level Radioactive Waste Storage Facility was built on Siu A Chau. It remains the only facility of this type in Hong Kong. The facility repurposes disused air raid tunnels to deal with Hong Kong&#x27;s radioactive waste for the next 100 years, the complex comprises a 55 m long jetty, a shielded waste storage vault, a fully-equipped laboratory, an automatic control room, a wastewater management system and specially-designed waste reception and processing areas.

In 2016, CLP Power proposed the islands as site for a terminal to receive liquefied natural gas (LNG) for use in electricity generation. This proposal is opposed by local environmental groups because the surrounding waters are an important habitat for various marine species, particularly the rare Chinese white dolphin.

In February 2020, OceansAsia reported finding 70 face masks washed up on one beach of the islands. The same beach was examined the following November, and OceansAsia volunteers reported collecting 54 more masks.

==Conservation==
The soft shore beach of Siu A Chau can attract green turtles and the islands were proposed to be a protected marine park.

The South Lantau Marine Park () was designated as a marine park in June 2022. It encompasses the Soko Islands and an area between Siu A Chau and Tai A Chau. The stated aim of the marine park is to help conserve the Chinese white dolphins and finless Porpoises.

==Education==
The Soko Islands are in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 97. Within the school net are three aided schools (operated independently but funded with government money) on Cheung Chau; no government schools are in this net.

<text>Musselburgh (; ; ) is the largest settlement in East Lothian, Scotland, on the coast of the Firth of Forth, east of Edinburgh city centre. It has a population of .

==History==
The name Musselburgh is Old English in origin, with &quot;mussel&quot; referring to the shellfish. The &quot;burgh&quot; element appears to derive from burh, in the same way as Edinburgh, before the introduction of formal burghs by David I. Its earliest Anglic name was &quot;Eskmuthe&quot; (Eskmouth) for its location at the mouth of the River Esk.

Musselburgh was first settled by the Romans in the years following their invasion of Scotland in 80 AD. They built a fort a little inland from the mouth of the River Esk, at Inveresk.

They bridged the Esk downstream from the fort, and thus established the line of the main eastern approach to Scotland&#x27;s capital for most of the next 2,000 years. The bridge built by the Romans outlasted them by many centuries. It was rebuilt on the original Roman foundations some time before 1300, and in 1597 it was rebuilt again, this time with a third arch added on the east side of the river. The Old Bridge is also known as the Roman Bridge and remains in use today by pedestrians. To its north is the New Bridge, designed by John Rennie the Elder and built in 1806. This in turn was considerably widened in 1925.

Musselburgh was made a burgh of barony c.1315 and a burgh of regality in 1562. The town attempted to become a royal burgh in 1632 but this was prevented by opposition from Edinburgh burgesses. Although Edinburgh is now known to have been a burgh by 1125, Musselburgh&#x27;s antiquity is reflected in the Scots-language traditional rhyme:

Musselburgh is known as &quot;The Honest Toun&quot;, and celebrates this by the annual election of the Honest Lad and Lass. The town motto &quot;&quot;Honestas&quot; dates back to 1332, when the Regent of Scotland, Randolph, Earl of Moray, died in the burgh after a long illness during which he was devotedly cared for by the townsfolk. His successor offered to reward the people for their loyalty but they declined, saying they were only doing their duty. The new regent, the Earl of Mar, was impressed and said they were a set of honest men, hence &quot;Honest Toun&quot;.

Archaeological excavations by Headland Archaeology between 2003 and 2004, as part of work to renew the water mains, found that the medieval town was concentrated on the High Street and that occupation in the North High Street area and Fisherrow only dates to the 16th century or later. The early town was centred on the eastern side of the river Esk.

Musselburgh is home to the Palladian Manor House of Newhailes, which dates back to 1702 and was home to eight generations of the Dalrymple family, who in the 18th century were a prominent political and legal force within Scotland. The house and grounds are now managed by the National Trust for Scotland.

Stoneyhill House dates from the mid 18th century. The estate of Stoneyhill was formerly owned by Sir William Sharp and later passed to the Earl of Wemyss, the notorious Francis Charteris.

The town and its population grew considerably throughout the latter half of the twentieth century, with major local authority and private housing developments on both the eastern and western outskirts.

The Battle of Pinkie, part of the Rough Wooing between Scotland and England, was fought south of Musselburgh in 1547.

=== Town Council ===
Prior to the local government reforms of 1975, Musselburgh was a small burgh within the county of Midlothian. As such, it elected a town council responsible for a number of areas of local governance, including housing, lighting and street cleaning and drainage. Midlothian County Council was responsible for other areas, including education. The town council met at the Musselburgh Tolbooth and later, for a short period before its abolition, at the Brunton Hall. The town&#x27;s civic head and chairman of the council was the provost and there were three bailies and a treasurer.

After the local government reforms of 1975, Musselburgh was transferred to the East Lothian district of the new Lothian region, and subsequently became part of the East Lothian unitary council area in 1996.

==Transport==

===Railway===
Musselburgh is served by two railway stations. Musselburgh railway station is in the west of the town adjacent to Queen Margaret University and has regular ScotRail services from to . It is a relatively new station, having opened in 1988. The other station serving the town is Wallyford railway station to the east of the town in the village of Wallyford, which opened in 1994.

The town&#x27;s original station was close to the town centre at the end of a short branch from Newhailes Junction. Passenger services from there ceased in 1964, and the line closed to all traffic in the early 1970s. The former railway line is now a road bypassing the Fisherrow area of the town. There was also a station at Fisherrow.

===Bus===
The town is served by Lothian Buses, East Coast Buses and Prentice Coaches Ltd.

===Roads===
The A1 by-passes the town and meets the A720 Edinburgh City Bypass at the edge of the town before continuing to Edinburgh city centre. The A199 goes through the High Street to Edinburgh in the west and to Dunbar to the east. This was originally the A1 until the town&#x27;s bypass was built in the mid-1980s.

==Sport==
The Musselburgh Silver Arrow is reputed to be the oldest sporting trophy in United Kingdom, and is competed for annually by the Royal Company of Archers. It dates back to at least 1603.

Musselburgh is home to both Musselburgh Racecourse and Musselburgh Links golf course. The links, a former venue of golf&#x27;s Open Championship, have recently been acknowledged as the oldest continuously played golf course in the world. Musselburgh Athletic F.C. are the town&#x27;s football team, competing in the East of Scotland League at their Olivebank Park ground in the west of the town. Musselburgh also has some grassroots teams for young players, such as the Musselburgh Windsor and the Musselburgh Youngstars. Musselburgh RFC play in the Scottish Premiership at Stoneyhill.

The Musselburgh Roads Cycling Club was formed in January 1936 by a breakaway group of 16 from the Musselburgh Clarion. After forming an alliance with other clubs during the war, the MRCC reformed again in its own right in January 1945. The club has a long and successful history of competitive cycling. Notable riders include: Jock Allison, who in 1945 won the British Best All Rounder title and is to date still the only Scottish club rider to do so; Janet Sutherland, who dominated Scottish woman&#x27;s cycling in 1951–4; and Sandy Gilchrist, who in 1977 won 5 individual and 4 team Scottish Championships. Many other riders from the club have won national championships or have been selected to compete at world championship level or the Commonwealth Games. Today, club members take part in track racing, road racing, time trials, cyclo cross and mountain biking. Their base is at the Tolbooth in the High Street.

There is also a locally run darts league, the Musselburgh and District Darts League, comprising an A and B league, each containing eight teams. Many players from this league represent the Lothian team at county level.

In Musselburgh there is also an amateur swimming club called Musselburgh Amateur Swimming Club. The club is home to the Musselburgh Marlins and trains at Musselburgh Sports Centre. The club was first established in 1886 and in its current format in 1994 where they trained at Loretto Swimming Pool which is now closed.

The East Lothian Seagulls of the Scottish Floorball League are based in Musselburgh and train and play matches at the sports centre at Queen Margaret University.

<text>Kellett Island is a former island of Victoria Harbour, off East Point in Hong Kong. It is now connected to Hong Kong Island at Causeway Bay following land reclamation in 1969.

It is located in Wan Chai District.

==Facilities==

The main buildings of the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club are located on the former Kellett Island. The former island and the reclaimed land form the western boundary of the Causeway Bay Typhoon Shelter. The southern entrance to the Cross-Harbour Tunnel is located on the Island.

==History==
The island was ceded to Britain together with Hong Kong Island. A small fort was built on it in 1841 for the protection of the eastern section of Victoria Harbour, and a battery with three cannons was added in 1854. The island was renamed in the 1860s (some sources mention 1842) after the naval officer Sir Henry Kellett. Kellett Bay and Mount Kellett were also named after him. After Kowloon Peninsula was ceded to Britain in 1860, the defense position of Kellett Island declined in importance, and it was used by British armed forces for ammunition and gunpowder storage.

The island remained for the use of the Navy until 1938, when the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club, formerly located in North Point, moved to Kellett Island. The clubhouse was built in 1939 on the foundations of the old Naval Powder Magazine. The new premises were formally opened on 26 October 1940 by the then Acting Governor, Lieutenant General Sir E. F. Norton.

After the fall of Hong Kong in 1941, occupying Japanese forces kept military supplies there, including fuel, gunpowder, artillery and ammunition. After the War, the Yacht Club was reopened there on 17 September 1945.

A causeway completed in 1952 was built to give access to the island by means other than water. Following reclamation work in the 1960s and the completion of the Cross-Harbour Tunnel in 1972, Kellett Island was connected to Causeway Bay and its original outline disappeared, although the name remained.


In October 1991, a pottery jar containing large quantity of Chinese copper coins was discovered at the island by the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club. The coins were dated to Sui, Tang and Song dynasties (589–1279). The coins and the pottery jar were then handed over by the club to the Antiquities and Monuments Office.

<doc id="1090151" wikidata="Q470982" url="?curid=1090151" title="Border trade">
<text>Border trade, in general, refers to the flow of goods and services across the border between different jurisdictions. In this sense, border trade is a part of the normal trade that flows through the ordinary export/import legal and logistical frameworks of nations and smaller jurisdictions. However border trade specifically refers to the &quot;increase&quot; in trade in areas where crossing borders is relatively easy and where products are significantly less expensive on one side of the border than the other often because of significant variations in taxation levels on goods. Common items involved in border trade include alcohol, tobacco, medication, recreational drugs, automobiles, automotive fuel, groceries, furniture and clothing.

As well as border trade across land or sea borders, air travel with a low-cost carrier can be worthwhile for an international trip for the same purpose, although baggage restrictions can limit the effective savings to those for small high-value goods.

Where border trade is done for tax evasion, it forms part of the underground economy of both jurisdictions.

==By region==

===Europe===
Typical examples of this are the borders between Ukraine and Russia, between Norway and Denmark/Sweden/Finland/Russia/Estonia and between Denmark and Germany//Switzerland. For instance, the excise tax on alcohol is lower in Estonia than in Finland and much lower than in Sweden, thus it is common to buy large volumes of alcohol when returning from Estonia: there are shops in the Tallinn harbour that cater specifically to tourists. In Finland, the best-selling Alko shop in proportion to local population is on the border to Norway, since even if the alcohol tax is high in Finland, it is lower than the one in Norway (and was lowered in order to decrease border trade with Estonia).

Border trading exists between Lithuania and Poland, as buying food is cheaper in Poland than in Lithuania.

Border trading exists between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland; during the Global Financial Crisis, when the Euro rose against the British pound, so many from the Republic visited Newry—with lines of traffic four miles long—that the phenomenon became known as the &quot;Newry effect&quot;. One in four households in the Republic in counties as far as Galway, four hours away from the border, shopped for groceries in Northern Ireland. Petrol is cheaper in the Republic, and groceries, furniture and clothing are cheaper in Northern Ireland.

Between the United Kingdom and France/Belgium, the booze cruise is a trip made specifically, or at least largely, to purchase cheaper alcohol and tobacco, and also goods offering different rates of VAT: laundry detergent, perhaps surprisingly, is a common purchase. Similarly, there is an important number of French purchasers buying tobacco and alcohol in Spanish border towns such as Le Perthus. In Spain, these products are a third cheaper than in France. During summer, around 70,000 visitors cross the Spanish border daily to buy such products, occasioning severe traffic jams. Nearby Andorra, with a low VAT (4%), is also extremely popular with French customers residing in the area.

There is a significant amount of border trade in marijuana between the Netherlands, where cannabis is essentially legal, and surrounding countries such as Belgium, Germany, and France.

A more legal example of the Netherlands is the Limburg province, where citizens occasionally take trips to Germany and Belgium to buy commodities like: medicinal products, handcrafted furniture, fresh produce, alcoholic beverages or home appliances for lower prices due to the VAT. This is very easy as there are no border controls due to the Schengen Agreement. It is fully legal to buy products for their own need over the border in the EU, if VAT is paid when purchasing, except from some low-VAT areas.

Residents of Switzerland and Liechtenstein who are non-EU residents can purchase many items in nearby Germany from anything from two to seven times the price they would pay for the same products in their own countries. Austria is also somewhat cheaper than Switzerland. Residents of Switzerland usually qualify for a tax refund on purchases made in all of the surrounding EU countries making cross border shopping even more attractive, particularly in Germany where there is no minimum-purchase requirement for claiming the tax back.

===North America===
Cross-border shopping between three countries in Canada, Mexico, and the United States has been robust. The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) has reduced barriers and tariffs, facilitating cross-border trade. Each day 2008, $2 billion of cross-border trade was conducted between Canada and the United States alone. Consumers take part in cross-border trading to broaden their product selection, gain access to a larger market place, or take advantage of currency volatility. Online commerce has taken on a more prominent role in recent years and gives consumers a convenient platform for cross-border shopping. However, additional border costs such as duties, brokerage and shipping are not always disclosed up front or even known to the retailer, leading to a situation where the final cost of an item can greatly exceed expectations. Dedicated cross-border shopping solutions such as Canada Post&#x27;s Borderfree program existed to mitigate these problems with varied success. In the end, caution is necessary to determine the final cost of goods before purchase.

The consumer import of prescription drugs from Canada and Mexico into the United States can provide a large cost savings for the patient, and is sometimes even facilitated by insurance companies, and the quality of medicine in Canada is comparable to that in the United States

During the COVID-19 pandemic that began in 2020, the US–Canada and US–Mexico borders were closed to non-essential traffic, leaving merchants who normally catered to cross-border shoppers stranded with no access to their customers. Exclaves such as Point Roberts, Washington, were particularly hard hit. Specific business categories, such as parcel shops, tourism, fuel and dairy incurred severe losses in many border communities; both US–Canada and US–Mexico trade incurred multi-billion dollar impacts.

====Between U.S. states and across city and county boundaries within states====
Although not crossing a national boundary, residents of one state may often travel across a state line in order to shop for a variety of goods. In some cases, a larger city or metro area in one state may draw a population in from another state or people may travel outside of city limits to surrounding areas with lower taxes. In other cases, residents may cross boundaries to take advantage of more friendly legislation regarding restricted products, such as alcohol, tobacco, fireworks, firearms, gambling, etc. For example, a New York City resident may engage in illicit cigarette trade by purchasing products in a nearby state with lower taxes and re-selling them illegally in New York. Furthermore, states which have legalized recreational marijuana may experience a high-amount of out-of-state customers.

=== South America ===
Historically, trade between the Colombian-Venezuelan border consisted primarily of Colombian residents traveling to Venezuelan border towns to purchase fuel derived from Venezuelan oil and other items that were cheaper to obtain there. However, due to the crisis in Venezuela that began in 2013 and worsened in 2017, thousands of Venezuelan residents began to travel to Colombian border towns to mostly purchase basic necessity goods. This has also brought with it the appearance of a black market and smuggling throughout the entire Colombian-Venezuelan border space, in addition to some restrictions that have been imposed, such as the closure of the Venezuelan border with Colombia by Nicolás Maduro in August 2015.

In the Chilean border towns, it is common for Chilean residents to go to make purchases in the stores of their neighboring countries, as well as to purchase medical exams and other health services at a lower cost. Notable cases are the commercial relationship between Arica and Tacna, on the Chilean-Peruvian border. Likewise, despite the ruggedness of the relief when having to cross the Andes mountain range along the Argentinean-Chilean border, there is a high flow of trans-Andean buyers, being a notable case that of Chileans near the city of Mendoza. More to south, a similar situation occurs between the cities of Punta Arenas and Río Gallegos.

===Asia===
Many Singaporeans also travel to Johor Bahru in Malaysia or Batam in Indonesia, to take advantage of price differences and differing product availability. The Singaporean government has a law that requires a car leaving Singapore to have the fuel tank filled by at least 75 percent, to prevent it from being filled with fuel from outside Singapore.

Shenzhen, on the border of mainland China with the special administrative region of Hong Kong, also benefits from border trade.

<text>The Ninepin Group () or Kwo Chau Islands () is a group of 29 islands in the easternmost waters of Hong Kong. The Ninepin Group falls under the jurisdiction of Sai Kung District of Hong Kong.

==Islands==
The islands of the group include:

* East Ninepin Island (Tung Kwo Chau; 東果洲)
** Lung Shuen Pai () or Fo Siu Pai ()
** Tuen Chau Chai ()
** Tuen Chau Mei ()
** Shue Long Chau () or Kong Tau Pai ()
* North Ninepin Island (Pak Kwo Chau; 北果洲)
** Hok Tsai Pai ()
** Ngan Peng Keng
** Ngan Peng Tau
** North Ninepin Island () 
** Sai Chau Mei () 
** Tuen Keng
* South Ninepin Island (Nam Kwo Chau; 南果洲)
** Tai Chau () - where the Kwo Chau Wan () beach is located
** Tai Chau Mei ()
** Ta Long Pai ()
** Lai Chi Pai ()

== Geography ==
The Ninepin Group features hexagonal vertical rhyolite columns, the volcanic rock resulting from a volcanic eruption near Sai Kung about 140 million years ago. Ninepin Group is extremely eroded due to the heavy tides that wash against the islands every day. It features several sea caves as a result of erosion. For a long time, the Ninepin Group was devoid of human presence. However, there is a temple dedicated to Tin Hau, located on South Ninepin Island for any fishermen who landed on the island.

==Conservation==
The Ninepin Group Special Area () covers 53.1 hectares and was designated in 2011. It consists of the islands that make up the Ninepin Group. The geology of the area is characterised by volcanic rocks of the Cretaceous period.

== Transportation ==

Because no one lives on Ninepin Group, there is no public transportation to the islands. One must rent a boat in order to reach the Ninepin Group.

<text>Longwood is a mixed-use neighborhood in the southeast Bronx in New York City. Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise are East 167th Street to the north, the Bronx River and the Bruckner Expressway to east, East 149th Street to the south, and Saint Anns Avenue to the west. Southern Boulevard is the primary thoroughfare through Longwood.

The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community District 2, and its ZIP Codes include 10455 and 10459. The neighborhood is served by the New York City Police Department&#x27;s 41st Precinct. NYCHA property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 7 at 737 Melrose Avenue in the Melrose section of the Bronx. The local subway, the , operates along Southern Boulevard.

==History==

The Bronx initially began to urbanize with the construction of a streetcar network. Eventually, the expansion of the elevated and subterranean rapid transit lines from Manhattan rapidly accelerated development. Solid rows of 5 and 6 story, walk-up and larger elevator, apartment buildings were built to the sidewalk and dominated the landscape of Upper Manhattan, the West Bronx and in walking proximity of the elevated lines in the East Bronx. Commercial corridors quickly developed in close proximity to rapid transit stations and primary thoroughfares. Early in this construction boom, Longwood was one of the most dense and developed Bronx neighborhoods. For much of the first half of the 20th century, the Bronx was overall home to a predominantly middle-class population of European and Jewish descent hailing from diverse nationalities, including immigrants directly from the corresponding countries of varying socioeconomic statuses.

Beginning in the 1950s, the older, more developed parts of the Bronx experienced a socioeconomic shift due to a number of factors. The construction of the Cross Bronx Expressway displaced thousands and physically divided communities, Co-op City in the northeast Bronx offered modern amenities and spacious apartments, and suburban communities outside New York City became more appealing with their auto-centric lifestyle. As people with financial means began to leave, impoverished people often replaced them. White flight and abandonment only accelerated over time. By the late 1970s, many buildings in the greater South Bronx had been burnt out in an epidemic wave of arson. Scammers realized they could manipulate the system and collect insurance money after more lucrative tenants had fled. The area was severely run down as the community became increasingly disfranchised. At this time, crime reached such a level that the 41st Precinct building at 1086 Simpson Street became known by the police as &quot;Fort Apache&quot;.

The wave of arson eventually ended with the help of community groups such as Banana Kelly CIA, Inc. and SEBCO (South East Bronx Community Organization), who worked to bring recognition and protect the remaining apartment buildings in the greater South Bronx. What was left was a wasteland of abandoned buildings, vacant lots, filthy streets and a severe lack of even basic commercial amenities. During this period of time, the neighborhood was dealt another blow as violent crime hit historic highs during the crack epidemic. The police seemed to be fighting a losing battle as many young men in New York City were killed on the streets over drug turf. The greater South Bronx was one of the hardest hit areas, with a largely poor population which lacked local jobs, many began to turn to the lucrative drug trade.

Some of the first federal funding in decades for new investment began in 1986 under the Ed Koch administration. In blighted neighborhoods across the city, various housing experiments were attempted. The NYCHA was one of the first agencies to create and renovate residential units in Longwood, the city soon followed up with independent, locally driven developments. This construction resulted in escalating reinvestment in these communities Continuing into the mid-1990s, local and federal governments invested over $550 million in new subsidized residential housing and the expansion of businesses and commerce. This period saw the construction of the South Bronx headquarters of the Police Athletic League of New York City and the relocation of the 41st Precinct of the NYPD from Simpson Street to Longwood Avenue. In addition, investments were made to the Banana Kelly High School, and to several small and large businesses. This investment has only increased exponentially since that time. A vast number of new housing and commercial units have been constructed on formally vacant lots, with more planned. A community once dominated by blight and disinvestment, is now towered over by modern apartment buildings, renovated pre-war structures, and rows of attached row houses. Social problems persist due to a significant percentage of the population living in poverty. Crime, for instance, has declined versus historic highs in the 1990s, but remains significantly above average for New York City. Nonetheless, the neighborhood remains a symbol of social and economic improvement.

==Demographics==
The neighborhood predominantly consists of Latin Americans (Longwood has one of the highest concentrations of Puerto Ricans in New York City) but includes a small yet diverse mix of races, ethnic groups, religious affiliations, sexual orientations, and national origins. Like most neighborhoods in New York City, the vast majority of households are renter occupied. Almost half of the population lives below the federal poverty line and receives public assistance (AFDC, Home Relief, Supplemental Security Income, and Medicaid). This community was once part of New York&#x27;s 16th congressional district, the poorest such district in the United States. After redistricting, it is now part of New York&#x27;s 15th congressional district and no longer the poorest district in the United States. There is significant income diversity on a block by block basis.

Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Longwood was 26,196, an increase of 3,114 (13.5%) from the 23,082 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 1.5% (382) White, 22.4% (5,866) African American, 0.1% (32) Native American, 0.5% (135) Asian, 0.0% (9) Pacific Islander, 0.3% (78) from other races, and 0.6% (163) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 74.6% (19,531) of the population.

The entirety of Community District 2, which comprises Longwood and Hunts Point, had 56,144 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 78.9 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 28% are between the ages of between 0–17, 29% between 25–44, and 21% between 45–64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 12% and 10% respectively.

As of 2017, the median household income in Community Districts 1 and 2, including Melrose and Mott Haven, was $20,966. In 2018, an estimated 29% of Longwood and Hunts Point residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in eight residents (12%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 58% in Longwood and Hunts Point, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Longwood and Hunts Point are gentrifying.

==Land use and terrain==

Longwood is dominated by pre-war, 5- and 6-story apartment buildings. Starting in the 1990s, a construction boom has resulted in a number of modern apartment buildings and row houses. Much of the original housing stock was structurally damaged by arson and eventually razed by the city between mid and late 1980s.

The total land area is roughly . The terrain is somewhat hilly.

<text>Kowloon Rock () is an island in the middle of Kowloon Bay in Hong Kong, near the runway of the former Kai Tak Airport. Administratively, it is part of Kowloon City District.

The island is three metres by two. The rock has no vegetation, as it is a rock. An isolated danger daymark is installed to alert passing vessels.

The island is now sheltered in the To Kwa Wan typhoon shelter by a dyke across the bay.

<doc id="1090162" wikidata="Q1525891" url="?curid=1090162" title="Typhoon shelter">
<text>A typhoon shelter () is a shelter for fishing boats during typhoons. These facilities are often found in Hong Kong.

==Structure==
In its usual form, a typhoon shelter is in the form of a bay or a cove, with a narrow opening for access, as most of the opening to the seas is blocked by a man-made breakwater.

==Usage==
A typhoon shelter, as its name suggests, is used by small to medium ships as a shelter against gale-force winds and rough seas during a typhoon strike. It is also used to moor yachts (the shelter in Causeway Bay in Hong Kong is often used for that purpose) and some typhoon shelters have wharves for cargo.

==Life in typhoon shelters==

Before the 1990s, there was a fairly large population living on boats in typhoon shelters. Many of them were the descendants of fishermen or boat people. They developed a distinct culture that is different from the mainstream cultures found in Hong Kong. The culture is, by many definitions, a fully developed one, with its own language, wedding rituals and other things such as food, songs and superstitions.

The life and culture of the descendants of these fishermen has often been glamourised, and effectively hid the truth of the extreme poverty that existed among these people. Since they often had to go out to sea to fish, the children of a fisherman&#x27;s family often did not go to school. This created the need for &quot;floating schools&quot;, operated by religious organisations, to educate children living in typhoon shelters. Also, as the catch was variable income was not steady.

Finally, as it is impossible to establish proper plumbing and garbage collection services among these boats, sanitary conditions in typhoon shelters during the time there were many people living there were less than desirable.

==Typhoon shelter crab==

&quot;Typhoon shelter crab&quot; (), a dish served in many Hong Kong Chinese restaurants, is believed to have originated from the typhoon shelters. It is commonly prepared with crab meat, garlic, scallion, red chili and black beans.

==Typhoon shelter prawn==
Besides typhoon shelter crab, which is very well known throughout the world, the typhoon shelter style is also often cooked with prawn (), especially giant tiger prawns (&quot;Penaeus monodon&quot;) or mantis prawn (&quot;Mantis shrimp&quot;). The method of cooking is similar to cooking typhoon shelter crab, where prawns are deep fried in aromatic oil, stir-fried with garlic, ginger, shallots, dried chili and black bean.

==Present==
Hong Kong&#x27;s status as a fishing city continues to decline; the descendants of the fishermen have moved onshore, and the so-called &quot;Typhoon Shelter&quot; culture is rapidly being lost. The function of typhoon shelters remains unchanged, however, and their existence is still vital to Hong Kong.

Some restaurants serving typhoon shelter-style cuisine have moved to shops onshore.

<text>Dominic Armato (born November 18, 1976) is an American voice actor, journalist and food critic. He is best known for his work on LucasArts games. His most famous role is the voice of the pirate Guybrush Threepwood in the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; series.

==Career==
Armato was a fan of the 1990s adventure games by LucasArts, such as the first two &quot;Monkey Island&quot; games. He joked with a friend that his ideal role would be to voice the &quot;Monkey Island&quot; protagonist, the pirate Guybrush Threepwood. Two months later, he was cast as Guybrush for &quot;The Curse of Monkey Island&quot; (1997). He has reprised the role for each of the sequels, plus the special editions of the first two games, and has also voiced characters in six &quot;Star Wars&quot; games and two &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games.

After ending his active voice-acting career in the early 2000s (with brief appearances in games), Armato has worked in the dining industry. Until 2015, Armato wrote a food-oriented blog, Skillet Doux. He was employed by &quot;The Arizona Republic&quot; as a food critic and journalist from 2015–2020.

<text>Orzinuovi (; Brescian: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, Italy.

==History==
It was founded in 1193 by statute of the &quot;comune&quot; of Brescia, as a boundary fortress with the name of &quot;Orci Novi&quot;. Its history thenceforth closely follows that of Brescia, sharing the Venetian dominion from 1466 until Venice&#x27;s demise in 1797. It became part of Napoleon&#x27;s Italian states until 1815, when it became part of the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia, as part of the Austrian Empire. This continued until the Second Italian Independence War. From 1860 it has been part of the Italy/Kingdom of Italy.

In the 2010s, Orzinuovi was involved in an illicit traffic of solid toxic waste treatment which concerns the bordering municipalities.

<text>Joseph Blowick (13 March 1903 – 12 August 1970) was an Irish Clann na Talmhan politician who served as Minister for Lands from 1948 to 1951 and 1954 to 1957 and Leader of Clann na Talmhan from 1944 to 1965. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Mayo South constituency from 1943 to 1965.

==Family==
Blowick was born in Belcarra, County Mayo, on 13 March 1903, the son of John Blowick (a farmer) and Honoria &quot;Norah&quot; (née Madden) Blowick. He had two sisters, and four brothers, three of whom became priests: Stephen Blowick, John Blowick and Peter Blowick.

He attended the local national school and later worked on his father&#x27;s large farm, going on to inherit it, as his other brothers were all in Holy orders.

In January 1956, aged 53, Blowick married nineteen-year-old Teresa O&#x27;Malley of Castleburke, County Mayo. They had four sons and three daughters.

==Political career==
Blowock&#x27;s first political office was as a member of Mayo County Council.

He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1943 as a Clann na Talmhan TD for Mayo South, one of ten seats the party took across the state and one of the two seats in County Mayo. He succeeded Michael Donnellan as leader of the party in 1944. 

The party&#x27;s representation dropped to seven seats after the 1948 general election but it was strong enough to be part of a coalition arrangement and Blowick was appointed to the Cabinet in the two Inter-Party governments (1948–1951, 1954–1957), serving under John A. Costello as Minister for Lands on both occasions. 

Blowick was re-elected to the Dáil at every election until 1965 when he retired from politics.

He died on 12 August 1970 in a Dublin hospital, leaving an estate valued at £9,771.

<text>Feodor or Fyodor Vasilyevich Kuritsyn (; died after 1500) was a Russian statesman, philosopher and poet.

==Biography==
As a government official and diplomat, Kuritsyn exerted great influence on the Russian foreign policy during the reign of Ivan III of Russia. In 1482, he was sent to the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus to conclude an anti-Polish alliance. In 1494, Kuritsyn was sent to Lithuania for the same purpose. He took part in many negotiations with foreign statesmen in Moscow.

In 1485, Kuritsyn created a club, which later would be considered heretical. He was against monasteries and monasticism, expressed ideas about freedom of human will (&quot;autocracy of the soul&quot;), which he would interpret in a much broader sense than it was allowed by the Orthodox theology. 

Kuritsyn&#x27;s name was last mentioned in 1500, when Ivan III gradually changed his attitude towards heretics thanks to hegumen Joseph Volotsky, who had been Kuritsyn&#x27;s staunch opponent. The tsar&#x27;s leniency gave way to persecution, which would put an end to activities of Kuritsyn&#x27;s club. Ivan III, however, spared Kuritsyn due to Volotsky&#x27;s obvious exaggerations in his accusations.

== Works ==
Kuritsyn authored numerous literary works, of which two survive to this day—a philosophical poem titled &quot;The Laodicean Missive&quot;, as well as the poetic novel &quot;The Legend of the Voijevoda Dracula&quot;.

<doc id="1090175" wikidata="Q5329162" url="?curid=1090175" title="East Point, Hong Kong">
<text>East Point was a spit on the northern shore of Hong Kong Island, Hong Kong. It extended from East Point Hill, i.e. Lee Garden towards Kellett Island and marked the eastern limits of the early City of Victoria. The piece of land separated Causeway Bay in the east and in the west. Streams and muds from Tai Hang and Wong Nai Chung (now buried beneath Canal Road as a subterranean river) shaped the spit.

==Geography==
Two sides of the spit were reclaimed over a hundred years. The first stage was in the mid-19th century. The east of the cape was reclaimed to the edge of Victoria Park and the west to Hennessy Road. The second stage was between World War I and World War II. Its west was reclaimed to Gloucester Road. The shape of the cape was mostly lost. For the construction of Cross-Harbour Tunnel, further reclamation extended the land to Kellett Island and the cape was completely buried.

Physically, the Causeway Bay station of the MTR and World Trade Centre are built on the body of East Point. Windsor House and Paterson Street fall on its first stage reclamation. The above two areas were referred to as &#x27;East Point&#x27;, while to its west was Bowrington.

Large scale reclamations make the geographic feature and division less obvious. Causeway Bay originally referred to the circular &quot;tung lo&quot;-shaped bay. It also referred to the east shore of the bay, i.e. the present-day area in Tin Hau station. It gradually replaced East Point as the name of that area.

==History==
Having briefly named &quot;Matheson&#x27;s Point&quot;, much of the land of East Point was historically in the hands of Jardine Matheson, which had their original Hong Kong godowns and offices there, near Gloucester Road and Cannon Street. Swire once had a sugar refinery in Sugar Street.

==Present features==
East Point is one of Hong Kong&#x27;s major shopping districts. It includes the 13-storey Japanese-style department store Sogo, as well as shopping centres such as Times Square and Hysan Place. There are also smaller malls such as World Trade Centre, Windsor House, Hang Lung Centre, Fashion Island, Fashion Walk, Lee Garden One and Lee Garden Two. Causeway Bay is one of the most crowded and central areas in Hong Kong. The area contains many trendy shops carrying both locally made and imported fashion and products from around the world. As such, it is a popular social spot for young people. Many shops are open until after midnight.

Notable hotels in East Point include The Excelsior (demolished) and Regal Hong Kong Hotel. Several boutique hotels have opened recently including Mira Moon Hotel on Jaffe Road.

For years, Jardine Matheson has fired a shot off the Noonday Gun at noon every day at East Point, by Victoria Harbour, slightly eastward of the former Kellett Island. The gunshots have served as time signals for many generations of old inhabitants of Hong Kong. This tradition still continues today. This is the &quot;Noonday Gun&quot; mentioned in the Noël Coward song &quot;Mad Dogs and Englishmen&quot;.

==Legacy==
The name East Point is still found in East Point Road () and East Point Centre ().

<doc id="1090180" wikidata="Q1499050" url="?curid=1090180" title="Judas goat">
<text>A Judas goat is a trained goat used in animal herding. Judas goats are trained to associate with sheep or cattle and lead them to a specific destination. In stockyards, a Judas goat will lead sheep to slaughter while its own life is spared. Judas goats are also used to lead other animals to specific pens and onto trucks. They have fallen out of use in recent times, but can still be found in various smaller slaughterhouses in some parts of the world, as well as conservation projects.

Cattle herders may use a Judas steer to serve the same purpose as a Judas goat. Both the term and the technique itself originated from cattle drives in the United States in the 1800s.

The term is a reference to Judas Iscariot, an apostle of Jesus Christ who betrayed Jesus as told in the New Testament of the Bible.

==Use in tracking invasive species==
The phrase has also been used to describe specially trained goats that are used to find feral goats targeted for eradication. These Judas goats are usually sterilized, outfitted with a transmitter, and/or marked with red paint for tracking purposes. Upon their release, the goat finds the feral herds, allowing hunters to exterminate them. The podcast &quot;Radiolab&quot; dedicated a portion of its episode on the Galápagos Islands to the impact of feral goats on the islands&#x27; environments, and the use of Judas goats to restore ecological balance. Judas goats are also used to target other invasive species. These include camels in Australia, pigs in America, rats in Mexico, and raccoon dogs in Europe.

===Goat eradication on San Clemente Island===

Endemic species on San Clemente Island have been degraded by feral goats since 1875. Under the administration of the United States Navy, a program of intensive eradication between 1972 and 1989 eliminated 28,000 goats on the island. Some feral goats were able to find cover in the rugged terrain and eradication efforts were hindered by frequent naval bombardment operations. Between 1989 and 1991, a dozen radio-collared Judas goats were used on the island to locate the remaining feral goats. 263 goats were killed.

=== Project Isabela in the Galápagos Islands ===
Project Isabela was a goat extermination initiative in the Galápagos Islands that started in 1997 and ended in 2006. Approximately 140,000 goats were living in the wild on the islands and threatening the local ecosystem. Goats were killed by gunmen in helicopters and on foot. Judas goats were used to lure the remaining goats to their death. The project cost 6 million dollars.

<doc id="1090185" wikidata="Q1011681" url="?curid=1090185" title="Coupar Angus">
<text>Coupar Angus (; Gaelic: &quot;Cupar Aonghais&quot;) is a town in Perth and Kinross, Scotland. It lies on the River Isla in the broad and fertile Valley of Strathmore, south of Blairgowrie. The A94 road from Perth to Forfar runs through the town, and it had a station on the Midland Junction line until 1967.

The town formerly straddled the border between Angus and Perthshire, but it has lain wholly within Perthshire since 1891. It retains the name &quot;Coupar Angus&quot;, however, which serves to distinguish it from Cupar in Fife.

==History==

The six-storey Tolbooth was built in 1762, funded by public subscription.

In the Middle Ages the Cistercian Coupar Angus Abbey was one of Scotland&#x27;s most important monasteries, founded by Malcolm IV (1153–65) in the 1160s. Of the abbey, only architectural fragments, preserved in the 19th-century parish church (which is probably on the site of the monastic church), or built into houses and walls throughout the town, survive, along with part of one of its gatehouses.

Coupar Angus Town Hall was commissioned to celebrate the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria and completed in 1887.

Several Polish units were stationed in and around Coupar Angus during the Second World War.

The Scottish Fold breed of cat originated in or near Coupar Angus.

==Sport==
Coupar Angus is home to the junior football club Coupar Angus F.C. and also Coupar Angus Amateur Football Club.

== Buses ==
Stagecoach East Scotland operate services 57/57A and 59 via Coupar Angus which go to Dundee, Blairgowrie and Perth. The services each run hourly. 

==Notable people==
*William Nairne Clark (1804–1854), born locally and one of the two protagonists that fought the first recorded duel in Western Australia.
*Alan Gilzean (1938-2018), locally-born former professional footballer from the 1960s and 1970s.
*Sir Robert Gillespie Reid (1842–1908), railway contractor.
*James Stirton (1833-1917), locally-born physician and leading expert on mosses and lichen.
*Jock Sutherland (1889-1948), locally-born coach for the Pittsburgh Steelers 1946–1947.
*Major-General Douglas Wimberley (1896-1983), commander of the 51st (Highland) Division in the Second World War.

<doc id="1090193" wikidata="Q7961018" url="?curid=1090193" title="Wakefield, Bronx">
<text>Wakefield is a working-class and middle-class section of the northern borough of the Bronx in New York City. It is bounded by the city&#x27;s border with Westchester County to the north, East 222nd Street to the south, and the Bronx River Parkway to the west.

Wakefield is the northernmost neighborhood in New York City (although, because of the slant of the Hudson and the grid system relative to true north, the city&#x27;s northernmost point is actually in Riverdale, at the University of Mount Saint Vincent). The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community District 12 and its ZIP Codes are 10466 and 10470. Wakefield is patrolled by the 47th Precinct of the New York City Police Department.

== History ==
Wakefield, originally in Westchester County, became part of New York County and New York City, when the eastern section of The Bronx was incorporated and merged with the western section (previously incorporated in 1873) as a borough of New York City, in 1895. Like the rest of the Bronx, it was once mainly forested and later became farmland. With the expansion of railroad transportation via the arrival of the New York and Harlem Railroad circa 1840, the area experienced moderate development. In 1898, the boroughs of Manhattan and The Bronx were merged with greater New York City as a result of the state legislature&#x27;s decision to amalgamate New York City with Brooklyn, Queens, and Staten Island. The Bronx later attained independent county status on April 19, 1912, which makes it the 62nd and youngest county in the state.

The current Wakefield station of the Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s Harlem Line was on the site of a village called Washingtonville, which was incorporated into Wakefield when it became a village on August 8, 1889. Wakefield was named after the Virginia plantation where George Washington was born (now part of George Washington Birthplace National Monument). Neighboring Mount Vernon, in Westchester County, is named for the plantation where Washington lived for most of his adulthood.

==Demographics==
Formerly, Wakefield was home to large Irish American and Italian-American populations. During the 1980s, these communities were replaced with large Caribbean and Guyanese populations, which now compose 72.3% of the neighborhood&#x27;s total population. 19.6% of the population is Hispanic. Many residents are or are descended from the Caribbean (mostly Jamaican) and Guyanese immigrants.

The 2010 United States Census reported a population of 67,813 residents in the surrounding area, while the 2000 United States Census reported a total of 68,787 residents.

==Police and crime==
Wakefield and Eastchester are patrolled by the 47th Precinct of the NYPD, located at 4111 Laconia Avenue. The 47th Precinct ranked 35th safest out of 69 patrol areas for per-capita crime in 2010.

The 47th Precinct has a lower crime rate than in the 1990s, with crimes across all categories having decreased by 60.9% between 1990 and 2022. The precinct reported 16 murders, 45 rapes, 461 robberies, 732 felony assaults, 300 burglaries, 758 grand larcenies, and 461 grand larcenies auto in 2022.

===Social problems===
Wakefield has seen a rise in gangs and gang-related violence from neighboring Edenwald. The high school drop-out rate is higher than the city average, but lower than central Bronx neighborhoods. Many households in the area are headed by a single mother.

==Fire safety==
Wakefield is served by the New York City Fire Department (FDNY)&#x27;s Engine Co. 63/Ladder Co. 39/Battalion 15, located at 755 East 233rd Street.

==Post office and ZIP Codes==
Wakefield is located within two ZIP Codes. Most of the neighborhood is located in 10466, but certain areas around East 241st Street and White Plains Road are part of 10470. The United States Postal Service operates the Wakefield Station post office at 4165 White Plains Road.

==Education==
===Schools===

There are several public schools scattered throughout the neighborhood including PS 16, PS 21 and PS 103. There are also many private and catholic schools including St. Francis-Assisi, Our Lady of Grace and the prominent all-male Catholic secondary school Mount Saint Michael Academy, which serves 1,100 students from grades 7-12. The all-female St. Barnabas High School serves many students from Wakefield and is located further west in Woodlawn (and partly in Westchester).

<text>The United States Coast Guard Reserve is the reserve component of the United States Coast Guard. It is organized, trained, administered, and supplied under the direction of the Commandant of the Coast Guard through the Assistant Commandant for Reserve (CG-R).

==Mission==
The mission of the Coast Guard Reserve is stated in the Reserve Policy Statement issued in 2018:

Serving as the Coast Guard&#x27;s only dedicated surge force the Reserve Component is a contingency-based workforce, trained locally and deployed globally to provide appropriately trained personnel to meet mission requirements within the prioritized focus areas of Defense Operations, Ports, Waterways, and Coastal Security, Incident Response and Management, &amp; Mission Support.

==History==

The United States Coast Guard Reserve was originally established on 23 June 1939 as a civilian reserve. This civilian reserve was renamed the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary on the passage of the Coast Guard Reserve and Auxiliary Act of 19 February 1941 and the military reserve commenced operations at that time.

===World War II===
Persons joining the Coast Guard after 1 February 1942 were signed on as regular reservists and were obligated to serve for &quot;the duration plus six&quot; months. These reservists served in every type of job that the Coast Guard had been tasked.

Uniquely among the Armed Forces, the Coast Guard was also given the authority to appoint other volunteers as &quot;temporary reservists&quot; without regard to age and physical fitness. These temporary reservists were generally drawn from the Coast Guard Auxiliary and were, essentially, unpaid part-time service members utilized stateside to, among other duties, perform coastal patrols and port security.

Because all of the personnel inducted in the Coast Guard after the start of the war were reservists, only 8% of the 214,000 Coast Guardsmen that served during World War II were non-reservists. An additional 125,000 temporary reservists also contributed to the war effort. At the end of the war most reservists were released to inactive duty or discharged.

===Cold War period===
Due to increased tensions during the Korean War period, Congress authorized funding of the first Coast Guard Reserve units. The first units were known as Organized Reserve Training Unit, Port Security (ORTUPS) and consisted of reserve officers and enlisted training in port security operations. Meetings were generally held once a week for 4 hours on a week night. Four hours paid the reservist the equivalent of one day&#x27;s pay for active duty Coast Guardsmen. There were 35 ORTUPS Units and 8300 reservists serving by July 1951. It was during this time that the Coast Guard&#x27;s Office of Reserve was created.

During the Vietnam War period and shortly thereafter, the Coast Guard considered abandoning the reserve program, but the force was instead reoriented into force augmentation. At the start of American involvement in the conflict, the Coast Guard anticipated calling up its reservists and auxilarists. As a result, 8,000 Coast Guard personnel, both active-duty and reservists, served in Southeast Asia. The Coast Guard Reserve reached its peak strength of 17,815 in 1969, during the Vietnam War.

===Post-Vietnam War events===

====Mobilizations====
In 1973 women were integrated into the active-duty Coast Guard and the Coast Guard Reserve. The SPARS ended and those in it were sent to the reserve.

Also in 1973 the reserve exercised its first involuntary recall in support of flood operations in the Midwest. The next involuntary recall was in support of the Mariel Boat Lift exodus from Cuba in 1980. Reserve units were increasingly used to augment regular Coast Guard operations during the 1980s but the mission of the Reserves was still training for mobilization. It was during this period that USCG Reserve strength greatly declined from its peak of 17,815 in 1969, as it declined to 11,500. This was partially because of administrative proposals to phase out the selected reserve.

Port Security Units (PSU) were formed during this time period and are made up of a small active duty element that handles the daily unit administration duties and a hundred or more reservists to complete the unit roster. Most of the enlisted reservists in a PSU are in the maritime enforcement specialist (ME) rating; a new rating as of 1 January 2010 that includes both active and reserve personnel. The ME rating was the old port security specialist (PS) rating, a reserve only rating that was integrated into the ME rating. Other rates assigned to the PSU&#x27;s include boatswains mate (BM), machinery technician (MK), gunners mate (GM), yeoman (YN), storekeeper (SK), and health services technician (HS).

In 1990, the first PSU was called up to active duty to support Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm. Various PSU&#x27;s have taken turns rotating in and out of Southwest Asia since that time.

====Team Coast Guard====
1994 saw the restructuring of the reserve program with the advent of the &quot;Team Coast Guard&quot; concept. This led to the disestablishment of most reserve units and the assignment of the reservists to active duty commands. As a result, reservists work very closely with their active duty counterparts, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, and Coast Guard civilians as they augment the resources of active duty commands. PSUs are the only remaining reserve units, as all other reservists are assigned to active duty commands.

While reservists provide high-value augmentation of active duty forces to assist in accomplishing everyday missions, each reservist must continually balance augmentation duties with readiness for mobilization. Since 11 September 2001, over 8,500 reservists have been activated.

===Recent events===
In 1997, a memorandum of understanding was signed between the New York Naval Militia and the U.S. Coast Guard, permitting Coast Guard reservists to serve in the New York Naval Militia, while simultaneously continuing their service in the Coast Guard Reserve.

The Commandant staff has recently developed a plan for support that &quot;optimizes the organization, administration, recruiting, instruction, training, and readiness of the Coast Guard Reserve&quot; known as Reserve Force Readiness System (RFRS). This program will improve the administrative and training readiness of the reserve force. The plans for improvements in funding and full-time support billets for the reserve force are being evaluated during 2009 and full implementation will be phased in over the next four years.

In 2000, the Coast Guard Reserve was deployed to the Middle East in response to the USS Cole bombing. The Coast Guard Reserve was also activated in response to the 11 September attacks and Hurricane Katrina during the early to mid 2000s.

Recent deployments of the Coast Guard Reserve include the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Hurricane Sandy, Hurricane Ian, the Mexico–United States border crisis, the MV Golden Ray incident, COVID-19 Response, and the Francis Scott Key bridge collapse.

==Organization==
The Coast Guard Reservist normally trains two days a month in a drill status and may perform up to 12 days of active duty Annual Training (AT) a year. Short of mobilization recall for war or national emergencies, opportunities exist for additional active duty under Active Duty for Training (ADT), Active Duty for Operational Support (ADOS) or Active Duty Special Work (ADSW). The Coast Guard Reserve has 6,293 men and women in service, most of them integrated directly with regular active duty Coast Guard units.

One of the significant organizational elements of the USCG Reserve are its Port Security Units, each PSU is staffed by 140 reservists and 6 active-duty personnel (one officer and 5 first-class petty officers).The officer may or may not be a reservist. Personnel prepare for contingency operations during weekend drills and normally participate in exercises and specialized training during their annual active-duty training (ADT).

There are 8 Port Security Units:
* PSU 301: Joint Base Cape Cod, Massachusetts
* PSU 305: Joint Base Langley–Eustis, Virginia
* PSU 307: Coast Guard Air Station Clearwater, Florida
* PSU 308: Stennis Space Center, Mississippi
* PSU 309: Camp Perry, Ohio
* PSU 311: Coast Guard Base Los Angeles/Long Beach, California
* PSU 312: Coast Guard Base Alameda, California
* PSU 313: Naval Station Everett, Washington

In 2021, the Coast Guard initiated a Coast Guard Reserve aviation program organized along the lines of flying units in the Reserve Components of the U.S. Department of Defense. This initially consisted of Coast Guard Reserve enlisted Naval Aircrewmen and Rescue Swimmers in pay grades E-4 through E-6 who would augment their active duty counterparts at Coast Guard air stations and air facilities. These personnel were typically eligible to perform four to six days of drills per month and additional active duty days annually. 

In 2022, this program was expanded to commissioned officers of the Coast Guard Reserve who were aeronautically designated as Coast Guard Aviators (i.e., pilots) who would serve in one of three capacities:

* Detached Duty External (DDE) flight instructors assigned to the Naval Air Training Command under the Chief of Naval Air Training (CNATRA). These officers would serve as primary and intermediate flight instructors in the T-6B Texan II at NAS Whiting Field, Florida and NAS Corpus Christi, Texas; as advanced multiengine fixed-wing flight instructors in the T-44A/C Pegasus and T-54A Marlin II at NAS Corpus Christi; and as advanced rotary-wing flight instructors in the TH-57B/C Sea Ranger and TH-73A Thrasher at NAS Whiting Field. 

* Aviation Training Center Mobile Reserve Standarization Instruction Pilots assigned to U.S. Coast Guard Aviation Training Center Mobile, the Coast Guard&#x27;s advanced training facility for all the service&#x27;s fleet aircraft except for the HC-130J Hercules. ATC Mobile is located at Mobile Regional Airport, Alabama, a joint civil-military airport.

* Coast Guard Reserve Aviator assigned directly to Coast Guard air stations and air facilities, flying the aircraft assigned to those installations. These pilots will perform all standard USCG aviation mission sets, to include standing 24-hour alert duty and meeting all training and flight proficiency requirements, equating to approximately sixty to seventy-two drill days plus additional active duty AT, ADT, or ADOS periods annually.

<text>The Bahrain national football team () represents Bahrain in international football and is controlled by the Bahrain Football Association, which was founded in 1951 and joined FIFA in 1966. They have never reached the World Cup, but have twice come within one match of doing so. Bahrain won the FIFA&#x27;s most improved team award in 2004, and finished fourth in the 2004 Asian Cup, beating Uzbekistan in the quarter-finals but losing to Japan in the semi-finals 4–3. Bahrain then lost to Iran in the third-place match, thus finishing in fourth place overall. Bahrain had a golden year in 2019, winning both the WAFF Championship and the Arabian Gulf Cup for the first time, under the stewardship of Hélio Sousa.

On 4th January 2025, Bahrain won the 26th Arabian Gulf Cup, defeating Oman 2-1 in a thrilling final match.

==History==

===Early years===
Even though the first national team was founded in 1959, Bahraini team was only first officially assembled in 1966 when they played a friendly game against Kuwait that was drawn 4–4. At that time, despite being under British rule, Bahrain was given autonomy and they had utilized this opportunity to expand its football development. Nonetheless, Bahrain was regarded as a weaker side in the Gulf Arab region, which constituted the stronger Saudi Arabia, Qatar, UAE and Kuwait. For this reason, Bahrain&#x27;s international feat had been mostly limited in the Arabian Gulf Cup.

In 1988, Bahrain qualified for its first ever AFC Asian Cup, but finished bottom with only two draws in the 1988 AFC Asian Cup. Since then, Bahraini side remained neglected and less invested, despite its youth successes at the U-17 and U-20. Only by the end of the 20th century, Bahrain began to really emerge and would change the country&#x27;s football history.

===Rise===
Bahrain managed a fine performance during 2000 AFC Asian Cup qualification and 2002 FIFA World Cup qualification, the latter was the first time Bahrain reached the final round. Despite being unable to reach either of them, Bahrain managed one of their greatest football feats, by beating Iran in both qualifications 1–0 in Damascus in 2000 Asian Cup run, and 3–1 at home in 2002 World Cup run, which remains one of the most embarrassing defeats for Iranian football. This win, though mean less for Bahrain, did manage to pull Iran out from reaching a direct World Cup ticket and helped Saudi Arabia to qualify for 2002 FIFA World Cup, Iran later failed to qualify; Bahraini fans waved the Saudi flag as a response to this win, fueling tensions between Bahrain and Iran.

====2004 Asian Cup====
The form of Bahrain in 2004 AFC Asian Cup was a complete stunning for many. In their just second appearance, Bahrain was drawn with mighty host China, neighbor Qatar and Southeast Asia&#x27;s finest Indonesia. However, Bahrain went on undefeated at the group stage, including a famous 2–2 draw to China in Beijing, 1–1 to Qatar before trashed Indonesia 3–1 to reach the quarter-finals for the first time. Then, Bahrain overcame Uzbekistan on penalty shootout in the quarter-finals, having been held 2–2. Bahrain put up another astonishing performance against defending champions Japan, only lost 3–4 after extra time, before losing 2–4 to Iran in the third place game. This tournament would mark the rise of Bahrain as a serious competitor for football in Asia.

====2006 World Cup====
After Uzbekistan and Bahrain both finished third in their respective groups during the 2006 World Cup qualifiers, Bahrain entered a two-legged playoff with Uzbekistan, which they won on away goals with an aggregate score of 1–1. This allowed Bahrain to enter another two-legged playoff with the fourth-placed CONCACAF nation, (Trinidad and Tobago), for a spot in the World Cup. But a 0–1 Bahrain loss in Manama after a 1–1 draw in Port of Spain saw the CONCACAF nation go through as debutant.
====2007 Asian Cup====
Bahrain played in group D in the 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualification group games. Bahrain fielded a side which was essentially the Olympic (under 23) team against Australia, and they lost 2–0. Bahrain qualified for the 2007 Asian Cup after defeating Kuwait in their last match. Bahrain were knocked out in the group stage via two losses against Indonesia and Saudi Arabia, despite a shock win against Korea Republic.

====2010 World Cup====

In the third round of the 2010 World Cup qualifiers, Bahrain were drawn into group B along with Japan, Oman, and Thailand. They finished second overall to qualify to the final round, in which Bahrain finished third overall in their group, below Australia and Japan, but above Uzbekistan and Qatar. In the second leg of the playoff against Saudi Arabia to decide Asia&#x27;s fifth best team, Bahrain drew 2–2 with Saudi Arabia after scoring in stoppage time which allowed them to go through on away goals, after drawing their home leg 0–0. They went on to play New Zealand in the final playoff in which a victory would qualify them for the World Cup, but after a goalless draw in Manama on 10 October 2009, Bahrain lost the return leg 1–0 in Wellington on 14 November 2009, missing out on qualification at the last hurdle for the second time running.
===Crisis period===
====2011 Asian Cup====
Bahrain qualified for the 2011 AFC Asian Cup held in neighbouring Qatar, and was drawn in a tough group composing Australia, South Korea and India. Bahrain faced its first task to overcome South Korea, with the hope to repeat the surprise 2–1 victory of the 2007 edition, but South Korea turned the deficit to beat Bahrain with the same score. After the loss, Bahrain cruised past India in a seven-goal party, Bahrain scored five to keep its hope alive; but its campaign ended in vain when they lost to Australia 0–1 and was dismissed from the group stages.

====2014 World Cup====

In the 2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers, Bahrain did considerably worse. In the third round, they were drawn against Indonesia, Iran and Qatar. Although they managed to defeat Indonesia both home and away, they also lost 6–0 by Iran away from home, and drew their other 3 games. Although they had a higher goal difference than Qatar, they needed an extra point to advance to the next round, or Qatar had to be beaten by Iran in the final round. If they had also drawn to Iran away from home, they would have advanced. But neither luck came to them, and their campaign ended in the third round, their worst result since the 1998 World Cup qualifiers.

====2015 Asian Cup====
The 2015 AFC Asian Cup once again became a disappointment for the Bahrainis, even though their group was easier, with only Iran being the biggest opponent while the UAE and Qatar were no strangers. Bahrain lost two opening games against Iran and the UAE 0–2 and 1–2, the latter defeat was subject to the earliest goal in Asian Cup history by Ali Mabkhout. Bahrain salvaged some pride with a 2–1 win over Qatar, condemning its neighbour to bottom of the group while Bahrain finished third for the second consecutive Asian Cup.

====2018 World Cup and 2019 Asian Cup qualifications====
In the 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifiers second round, Bahrain finished fourth in a group with Uzbekistan, North Korea, Philippines and Yemen. The poor performance of the Bahraini side caused huge public uproar over the team&#x27;s ongoing decline, rocked the chair of manager Sergio Batista. He was eventually sacked and replaced by Czech youth coach Miroslav Soukup, who decided to revamp the team.

Later on, Bahrain participated in the 2019 AFC Asian Cup qualification, where finished first in the third round in a group with Turkmenistan, Chinese Taipei and Singapore, to qualify to the next AFC Asian Cup. However, the team&#x27;s performance was far from perfect. The team suffered a home draw to minnows Singapore, before getting humiliated by Chinese Taipei away 1–2 that was considered as a shock, since Taiwan is not a football nation. This defeat also prompted Bahrain&#x27;s main star, Ismail Abdullatif, to retire from the team.

Bahrain managed some promising performance during this deteriorating era, reaching semi-finals of the 23rd Arabian Gulf Cup held in Kuwait.

===Short-lived glory===
==== 2019: Asian Cup; WAFF Championship and Gulf Cup champions ====
At the 2019 AFC Asian Cup, Bahrain was grouped with India, Thailand and hosts United Arab Emirates. The Bahrainis managed a promising early performance when they faced the hosts, scored a goal lead in 78&#x27;, but was eventually held 1–1 following an unclear penalty decision by the Jordanian referee Adham Makhadmeh. However, Bahrain suffered a blasting loss to Thailand 0–1, leaving the team flounder despite its earlier performance. In the final match against India, which the Indians only required a draw to progress, Bahrain however managed to get a needed penalty in injury time, where Jamal Rashid turned hero as Bahrain won the fixture 1–0 to seal the team into the knockout stage for the only second times ever, and eliminated the Indians from the competition. The Bahraini side then played its own round of sixteen match, where they lost 2–1 to South Korea after extra time. This was considered as a major success for Bahraini football, and also to be the end of the country&#x27;s football misfortune that endured since 2010s.

Afterwards, Bahrain managed to win two competitions for the first time, after defeating both Iraq and Saudi Arabia, 1–0 under the leadership of Hélio Sousa against all odds, in the WAFF Championship and Gulf Cup respectively.

====2022 World Cup====
Bahrain defeated Iran 1–0 in the 2022 FIFA World Cup Qualification Round 2, delivering a major upset in the qualifying process, and with Bahrain enjoying huge edge in the qualifiers, Bahrain was expected to reach the third round. However, due to COVID-19 pandemic, Bahrain&#x27;s great progression in 2019 was reversed when it lost significant home supports (despite being designated as hosts for the remaining games) due to pandemic, as fans were barred from attending, Iran having replaced manager as well, combining the Bahrain&#x27;s domestic league under frequent disruption due to the pandemic, all left Bahraini players little time to organise their team. Bahrain triumphed against Cambodia 8–0 in their first game since the pandemic began, but against an Iranian side that was entirely revamped, a Bahraini side without home support was completely demoralised, losing 0–3 in process. This defeat proved to be disastrous for Bahrain, as their 4–0 victory over Hong Kong was too little, too late, due to Iran prevailing 1–0 over Iraq in the final game.

====2023 Asian cup====
In the 2023 AFC Asian Cup, Bahrain won their group (which contained Malaysia, South Korea, and Jordan). After a first matchday loss to South Korea, they followed it up with back-to-back wins, before falling to Japan in the Round of 16.

<doc id="1090202" wikidata="Q1121447" url="?curid=1090202" title="Daniel Morrissey">
<text>Daniel Morrissey (28 November 1895 – 4 November 1981) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as Minister for Justice from March 1951 to June 1951, Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1948 to 1951 and Leas-Cheann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann from 1928 to 1932. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1922 to 1957.

==Early life==
Morrissey was born in Nenagh, County Tipperary, the son of William Morrissey, a small carter-contractor, and his wife Bridget (née Gleeson). He was educated locally and, although he left school against his mother&#x27;s wishes at the age of 12, he continued his own reading and studies.

==Trade unionism==
Morrissey&#x27;s interest in trade unionism began when he was working as a labourer with Great Southern Railways. He left after a dispute with his foreman in 1915 and joined the staff of a national insurance society. Almost at once he began organising trades union in South Tipperary. Rapidly advancing in the trade union movement, he was soon on the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union executive, a delegate to the Irish Trades Union Congress (ITUC) and fraternal delegate to the Scottish Trades Union Congress. Morrissey opposed the ITUC decision not to contest the 1918 general election.

==Political career==
Morrissey was a successful candidate for the Labour Party at the 1920 local elections. At the 1922 general election, the first national election contested by Labour, he won a seat the Tipperary Mid, North and South constituency. Ernie O&#x27;Malley had threatened to shoot Morrissey unless he withdrew his candidacy, but backed down when Dan Breen threatened to shoot him in turn. As a result of the outbreak of the Civil War the new Dáil did not meet for several months. Though Anti-Treaty Sinn Féin TDs abstained, Morrissey and his 16 Labour Party colleagues attended and became the official opposition. In 1923, he became Labour Party Chief Whip and served as Leas-Cheann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann between 1928 and 1932.

In 1931, Morrissey defied the Labour whip and supported the Constitution (Amendment No. 17) Bill, a measure proposed by the government of W. T. Cosgrave against the Irish Republican Army. The Executive Council sought to establish military courts that were empowered to impose sentences – including capital punishment, without appeal – in response to IRA violence. Motivated by two recent murders in his constituency, Morrissey broke ranks with Labour, who thought the measures too authoritarian and voted for the bill, resulting in him being expelled from the party alongside Richard Anthony. He was re-elected as an Independent at the 1932 general election, before joining Cumann na nGaedheal (which became Fine Gael in 1933 after a merger).

Following the 1948 general election, Fine Gael leader Richard Mulcahy proposed the idea of forming a coalition government and ousting Fianna Fáil after 16 years in government. Morrissey was instrumental in securing the support of his former colleagues in the Labour Party and the breakaway National Labour Party. After successful negotiations Morrissey became the first Minister to be appointed in the First Inter-Party Government, as Minister for Industry and Commerce. He proved to be an active Minister, establishing Córas Tráchtála and the Industrial Development Authority as well as nationalising CIÉ. Morrissey was also a member of the negotiating team which concluded the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1948. He was appointed Minister for Justice in a cabinet reshuffle in 1951 and held the position until the collapse of the government later that year.

Following the 1954 general election, Morrissey was a member of the negotiating team which created the Second Inter-Party Government. He declined a cabinet position due to his age.

Morrissey retired from the Dáil on health grounds at the 1957 general election.

==Later life==
In retirement from politics, Morrissey returned to his auctioneering business where he worked until 1965. He died at his home in Stillorgan, Dublin, on 4 November 1981.

==Appraisal==
In Professor Tom Garvin&#x27;s review of the 1950s &quot;News from a New Republic&quot;, Morrissey comes in for praise as a moderniser and the instigator of the Industrial Development Authority. Garvin places him with a cross party group including Gerard Sweetman of Fine Gael and William Norton of the Labour Party as well as Seán Lemass of Fianna Fáil who were pushing a modernising agenda.

<doc id="1090203" wikidata="Q504452" url="?curid=1090203" title="Chris Osgood">
<text>Christopher John Osgood (born November 26, 1972) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey goaltender who is currently a Detroit Red Wings studio analyst and part-time color commentator for FanDuel Sports Network Detroit. He won three Stanley Cup championships in his career, all with the Red Wings, his first as the backup goaltender, and his last two as the starting goaltender. Between the four Stanley Cups Detroit won between 1997 and 2008, Osgood only missed the 2002 Stanley Cup championship. He is ranked 13th in wins in NHL regular season history with 401.

Osgood spent the first part of his 17-year NHL career with the Red Wings, then the New York Islanders and the St. Louis Blues before returning to Detroit in 2005. Osgood was known in Detroit by his nicknames &quot;Ozzy,&quot; chanted by the crowd after a big save, and &quot;The Wizard of Oz.&quot;

He was the last NHL goalie to wear a traditional player&#x27;s helmet/cage combo instead of the newer one piece goalie mask until Rick DiPietro briefly wore one of Osgood&#x27;s in 2011, after he was injured in a fight with Brent Johnson. He is also one of only 16 goaltenders in NHL history to have scored a goal, and one of only nine to have scored by shooting the puck directly into the opponent&#x27;s net (not an &quot;own goal&quot;), on March 6, 1996 versus the Hartford Whalers.

==Playing career==
Chris Osgood was drafted 54th overall by the Red Wings in the third round of the 1991 NHL Entry Draft and made his debut during the 1993–94 season.

===Rookie year===
Osgood became the fourth goaltender to man the crease for Detroit that season alongside Tim Cheveldae, Vincent Riendeau, and Peter Ing. Cheveldae, the team&#x27;s primary starter, and a former All-Star, along with Dallas Drake, was traded to the Winnipeg Jets in exchange for veteran goaltender Bob Essensa and defenceman Sergei Bautin. Essensa did not have a strong showing in a 13-game stint at the end of the regular season, and Osgood was named the primary goaltender for the playoffs. The San Jose Sharks defeated the heavily favored Red Wings in seven games. The most memorable scene of the series occurred in the deciding game. With the game tied 2–2 late in the third period, Osgood went to clear a puck around the boards, but it landed on Sharks forward Jamie Baker&#x27;s stick, who then scored the winning goal. Overtaken by remorse at his mistake, the young goaltender wept at his stall following the game.

Following the season, Detroit management felt the team needed a strong veteran goaltender with Stanley Cup playoff experience. In the summer of 1994, the Red Wings traded defenceman Steve Chiasson to the Calgary Flames for goaltender Mike Vernon, who had previously helped the Flames to the Stanley Cup title in 1989.

===Initial Detroit success===
While the 1994–95 season started late due to a lockout, Osgood served as a backup goaltender for Mike Vernon for the season. The Wings reached the 1995 Stanley Cup Finals that season, where they were swept in four games by the underdog New Jersey Devils. Osgood received significantly more playing time for the 1995–96 season, and he led the NHL with a 2.17 GAA and 39 wins. He also finished third in shutouts (5) and was a Vezina Trophy runner-up to Jim Carey. Osgood and Vernon shared the William M. Jennings Trophy as the goaltenders, allowing the fewest goals in the league. For his efforts, Osgood was selected for the NHL All-Star Game and was also named for the post-season NHL All-Star second team.

That season, he scored against the Hartford Whalers, becoming the second goaltender in NHL history to score a goal after Ron Hextall. Former Islanders goaltender Billy Smith was also credited with a goal as the player last touching the puck, but only Osgood and Hextall directly shot the puck in.

The next season, Osgood and Vernon shared starting goaltender duties in the regular season. Still, when the playoffs began, virtually all the playing time went to Vernon, who won the Conn Smythe Trophy. In the end, Osgood had his name engraved on the Stanley Cup as the Red Wings swept the Philadelphia Flyers in four games to win their first Stanley Cup in 42 years.

After the 1997 Cup win, Vernon was traded to the San Jose Sharks, making Osgood Detroit&#x27;s number-one goaltender. Again, the Red Wings advanced to the Stanley Cup finals and defeated the Washington Capitals in another four-game sweep to win back-to-back Stanley Cup championships.

On April 1, 1998, he was in a goalie fight with Colorado Avalanche goalie Patrick Roy. Roy fought with Vernon the previous year on March 26, 1997.

Osgood remained Detroit&#x27;s primary goaltender until the summer of 2001, working alongside Ken Wregget and Manny Legacé before being put on waivers and picked up by the New York Islanders.

===Islander years===
In the summer of 2001, the Red Wings acquired goaltender Dominik Hašek, a six-time Vezina Trophy winner, from the Buffalo Sabres. After numerous attempts to trade Osgood, the Red Wings left him unprotected in the waiver draft, and the Islanders claimed him on September 28, 2001. Initially, Osgood wore the red pads he&#x27;d worn the previous year with the Red Wings before eventually changing his equipment to the blue of the Islanders.

Osgood split playing time with Garth Snow for the 2001–2002 season and helped the Islanders to a playoff berth, where they lost a seven-game series to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Osgood split time with both Snow and Rick DiPietro for the 2002–2003 season before being traded to the St. Louis Blues on March 11, 2003, along with a third-round pick in the 2003 NHL draft (which would be Konstantin Barulin) for Justin Papineau and a second-round pick in the 2003 draft (Jeremy Colliton).

===Stint in St. Louis===
For the remainder of the 2002–2003 season and the entire 2003–2004 season, Osgood remained the primary goaltender for the St. Louis Blues. Although Osgood posted winning records for both seasons, the Blues did not advance past the playoff quarterfinals, losing to the Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks, respectively. St. Louis did not renew Osgood&#x27;s contract before the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement, and he became a free agent.

===Return to Detroit===
On August 8, 2005, Detroit returned Osgood with a one-year, $800,000 contract. He was initially set to compete for the starting job with Manny Legace but suffered a groin tear and did not play when the season started. Osgood was assigned to play for the Grand Rapids Griffins of the American Hockey League (AHL) on a conditioning assignment. After posting a 2–1 record in three games, Osgood returned to Detroit to work in a goaltending tandem with Legace again.

Osgood also worked with rookie goaltenders Jimmy Howard and Joey MacDonald while Legacé recovered from knee injuries in late 2005. During the 2006 Stanley Cup playoffs, Osgood injured his groin preparing for Game 4 of the first round against the Edmonton Oilers. Osgood missed the remainder of the series, and the Red Wings post-season was over after 6 games against the Oilers.

On July 1, 2006, Osgood re-signed to a two-year, $1.8 million contract with the Red Wings. He then shared goaltending duties with Hašek, who also returned for another stint with the Red Wings. Though Hašek was expected to get slightly more playing time than Osgood throughout the regular season, it was expected that the goaltending tandem would have shared most of the playing time, with MacDonald expected to be their backup. However, Osgood suffered a fractured hand in practice, placing him on the injured reserve while MacDonald stepped up as the number 2 goaltender in Osgood&#x27;s leave.

Osgood returned to playing by the end of December. Due to Osgood&#x27;s injuries and the aging Hašek&#x27;s ability to remain healthy throughout the season, Osgood ended up assuming the backup role for Hašek instead of sharing playing time.

The 2007–08 season served as a return to form for Osgood. Osgood and Hašek remained Detroit&#x27;s goaltending tandem for the 2007–08 season. While Osgood was expected to be the backup goaltender, Hašek struggled at the beginning of the season and subsequently became injured. Osgood assumed the starting role while Hašek was injured and put up superior numbers. As of April 30, 2008, Osgood ranked 1st in the NHL in GAA with 2.09 during the regular season, 16th in Save Percentage with 0.914, and had an impressive 27–9–4 record. That performance earned him a 3 year/$4.5M contract extension with the Red Wings and an appearance at the 2008 NHL All-Star Game. With Hašek healthy and getting back into his stride, Detroit chose to alternate goaltenders instead of designating either goaltender as the backup.

===2008 Stanley Cup playoffs===

After Hašek performed poorly in Games 3 and 4 of their 2008 first round series with the Nashville Predators, Red Wings coach Mike Babcock decided to pull him in favor of Osgood midway through Game 4 and named him the starter for game 5 and the rest of the playoffs. With Osgood in goal, the Red Wings won their next nine playoff games in a row, defeating the Predators and sweeping the Colorado Avalanche as well as dealing the Dallas Stars a three-game deficit. Though the Stars battled back, winning their next two games, Osgood shone in game 6, stopping all but one shot in a game riddled with Red Wings penalties, sending them to the Stanley Cup Finals to meet the Pittsburgh Penguins. In games one and two of the Stanley Cup finals, Osgood had back-to-back shutouts, making him the fourth goalie in NHL history to start the Finals with back-to-back shutouts. Between the two games, he made a total of 41 saves. His save as time expired in Game Six sealed the Stanley Cup win for the Red Wings and for Osgood, who won his second championship as a starting goaltender. His final 2008 playoff record was 14–4 with a 1.55 GAA; he was considered a contender for the Conn Smythe Trophy which eventually went to Henrik Zetterberg.

===Aftermath of the Stanley Cup===
The following 2008–09 season was a sharp contrast to the 2008 playoffs for Osgood, who struggled heavily for virtually the entire season, and ended it with the worst statistical numbers of his entire career. &quot;It was the worst I&#x27;ve played in that long of a stretch in my career,&quot; he said. &quot;Let&#x27;s be honest.&quot;. A combination of injuries and self-inflicted mental pressure adversely affected his game, to the point where late in the season he was essentially &quot;sent home&quot; for ten days by the Red Wings, in order for him to work with goaltending coach Jim Bedard and re-focus. Although his 26 wins put him 10th all-time in the NHL by season&#x27;s end, he finished with a GAA a full goal above what he had posted in 2007–08, and a save percentage in the bottom ten percent of all 45 goalies who played enough to qualify.
Despite being visibly outplayed in nearly every aspect by Ty Conklin during the regular season, whom he credited for not allowing the goaltending situation to become much worse than it was, Osgood&#x27;s immense playoff experience was referred to throughout the season, and as the unquestioned starting goaltender in the 2009 playoffs, he played nearly every minute of 23 games, finishing with a 15–8 record. His drastically improved performance led to speculation that he was Detroit&#x27;s leading candidate for the Conn Smythe Trophy as the Red Wings advanced to the Stanley Cup Finals for the second straight year. However in the end, Detroit was defeated in a rematch of the previous year with the Pittsburgh Penguins, this time in seven games, after having two chances to close out the series with the Wings leading 3-2 after Game 5.

The following season, Osgood continued to struggle in regular season play, and eventually lost his position as Detroit&#x27;s starting goaltender to his newly promoted backup for the season from Grand Rapids and rookie goaltender Jimmy Howard. However, the Red Wings in general under performed, mainly at the beginning of the season due to injuries to key players. Osgood finished the 2009–10 season having played only 23 games, with most of these at the beginning of the season when he was still the starter before being replaced by Howard, and posting a 3.02 GAA and .888 save percentage.

Osgood had better statistics during the 2010-11 NHL season. On December 27, 2010, in a game against the Colorado Avalanche at Pepsi Center, Osgood earned his 400th career victory. He became just the 10th goaltender in NHL history to reach this milestone. The Red Wings won the game 4–3 in overtime on a goal by Niklas Kronwall. On July 19, 2011, Osgood announced his retirement from ice hockey, but remained with the Wings organization in a role developing young goaltenders with the assistance of his former goaltending coach Tom Danko.

===Post-playing career===
On September 9, 2013, it was announced that Chris Osgood was hired as a Red Wings game and studio analyst for Fox Sports Detroit, replacing fired-former teammate Larry Murphy. In this role, he primarily provides analysis in the studio, but he also replaced Mickey Redmond on select road games throughout the season. On February 14, 2019, the network announced that he and Murphy will rotate in the same capacity for the rest of the 2018–19 season and beyond.

On August 30, 2016, Osgood, joined Red Wings&#x27; vice president Jim Devellano as part-owner of the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Saginaw Spirit. Osgood serves as a goaltending and general consultant to the team.

<doc id="1090204" wikidata="Q5644337" url="?curid=1090204" title="Hamburger Helper">
<text>Hamburger Helper is a packaged food product manufactured by Eagle Foods. As boxed, it consists of a dried carbohydrate (often pasta or rice), with powdered seasonings contained in a packet. The consumer is meant to combine the contents of the box with browned ground beef (&quot;hamburger&quot;), water, and, with some varieties, milk to create a complete one-dish meal. 

There are also variations of the product designed for other meats, such as &quot;Tuna Helper&quot; and &quot;Chicken Helper&quot;. Some of these feature other starches, such as potatoes.

==History==
The packaged pasta brand &quot;Hamburger Helper&quot; was introduced by General Mills in 1971 in response to a meat shortage and rising meat prices. In 2005, Food Network rated it third on its list of &quot;Top Five Fad Foods of 1970&quot;. In 2013, the company shortened the brand&#x27;s name to just &quot;Helper&quot;.

The Hamburger Helper mascot is &quot;the Helping Hand&quot; or &quot;Lefty&quot;—a four-fingered, left-hand white glove with a face on the palm and a red spherical nose. It often appears in the product&#x27;s television commercials and on packages.

In May 2022, General Mills announced an agreement to sell the brand to Eagle Foods for approximately $610 million. On July 5, 2022 the sale was completed.

==Hamburger varieties==

The basic (and most popular) version of Hamburger Helper is a box of dried pasta with seasoning that is designed to be cooked with ground beef. Hamburger Helper offers a variety of flavors, including lasagna, cheeseburger macaroni, bacon cheeseburger, philly cheesesteak, and others.

==Other varieties==
There are also variations designed for other meats: &quot;Tuna Helper&quot; and &quot;Chicken Helper&quot;.

*Tuna Helper became successful as the second variety to appear on the market, in 1972.

*Fruit Helper was introduced in 1973. These were dessert products made with canned or fresh fruit. The Fruit Helper line has since been discontinued.

*Chicken Helper was introduced in 1984 in response to the wide availability of inexpensive boneless and skinless chicken breasts.

*Asian Helper is a selection of four main Asian-American-style dishes, three made with chicken and one with beef. With the acquisition of the brand by Eagle Foods, the line has been discontinued.

*Whole Grain Helper options include Lemon &amp; Herb Chicken, Honey Mustard Chicken, Cheeseburger Mac, and Beef Stroganoff flavors made with whole-wheat pasta. The line has also been discontinued.

*Pork Helper was introduced in 2003. Varieties included pork fried rice and pork chops with stuffing. The product was discontinued shortly after its introduction.

*Hamburger Helper Microwave Singles were introduced in 2006. This product requires water and brief cooking in the microwave to produce a single serving portion of some of the most popular flavors. Chicken Helper flavors were added in 2007 despite the brand being discontinued shortly thereafter. It returned in 2013 as Chicken and Chili Helper
*Hamburger Helper Microwavable made its return in 2024. Now made with dehydrated beef, it comes in 3 flavors: Beef Pasta, Cheeseburger Mac, and Tomato Basil Mac.

==In popular culture==
A 1977 book collecting material from the satirical TV show &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; contained an unproduced sketch called &quot;Placenta Helper,&quot; an ad for a product which &quot;lets you stretch your placenta into a tasty casserole.&quot; The sketch was written by Tom Davis and future United States Senator Al Franken.

In 1979, Scott Spiegel wrote, produced and directed a short film entitled &quot;Attack of the Helping Hand&quot;, which featured a &quot;Hamburger Helper&quot; oven mitt as a killer glove.

The animated television series &quot;Family Guy&quot; featured Lefty the mascot in one of their famous &quot;cutaway gags&quot; from the 2009 episode &quot;Business Guy&quot;. The gag involved Lefty, who appears with his neurologically impaired brother, who takes the form of a right-handed glove, representing the non-existent brand &quot;Cheeseburger Helper&quot;.

On April 1, 2016, General Mills commissioned an EP as an April Fools&#x27; Day prank, titled &quot;Watch the Stove&quot;. According to a press release, the EP was produced for General Mills by a team at St. Paul, Minnesota&#x27;s McNally Smith College of Music. The EP&#x27;s title is a parody of the Jay-Z and Kanye West collaborative album &quot;Watch the Throne&quot;. It contains five songs, all of which are about Hamburger Helper. It instantly achieved a viral status, played over four million times on SoundCloud in less than three days, with many listeners finding value in the brand&#x27;s promotion of younger artists.

It is mentioned in &quot;Young Sheldon&quot; Season 6, episode 21, &#x27;A Romantic Getaway and a Germanic meat-based Diet,&#x27; which aired on May 18, 2023. Georgie is cooking with his baby CeeCee in his arms and tells Mandy that she is his &quot;little Hamburger Helper helper.&quot;

<text>Crumlin () is a village in County Antrim, Northern Ireland. 

==Overview==
Crumlin is 20 miles (32 km) west of Belfast city centre and 3 miles (4.6 km) from Belfast International Airport at Aldergrove. It is part of Antrim and Newtownabbey district and had a population of 5,366 people in the 2021 census.

Crumlin covers 1.28 square km or 0.5 square miles.

The Crumlin river (also known as the Camlin river) flows through the village from Divis Mountain to Lough Neagh.

==History==
There are records of a settlement at Crumlin going back to at least 1306. The Taxation of the Dioceses, compiled in that year 1306, notes &quot;The Church of Camelyn, 2 marks, Tenth 2s. 8d.&quot; Bishop Reeves says, &quot;It is so called from a tortuous stream&quot; (the crooked line). Camlin was anciently a Bishop&#x27;s Mensal, and services were held in the church up to 1661, but it was destroyed by the army of King James II in 1689 after which the locals moved to Glenavy Parish Church.

According to a survey carried out in 1808, it had a population of 430 people, a school and a post-office. Linen weaving and labouring were the main forms of employment. By 1849 it had its own electoral division.

The town&#x27;s old linen mill was built in 1809.

A stone clock tower, built in 1897 as a memorial to a member of the Pakenham family who were landlords in the area, stands at the top of the village near the former railway station.

On 13 September 1902, the Crumlin meteorite landed near the village. When it first hit the atmosphere it was travelling at 30,000 miles an hour, and the sonic boom was heard up to 10 miles away. Locals heard various strange noises and some of them likened it to a train running off the track or a boiler exploding in the nearby mill or a swarm of bees. It landed on Andrew Walker&#x27;s farm and was soon bought and taken away to the Natural History Museum in London. It has now been loaned to the Ulster Museum in Belfast for 3 years and came back to Northern Ireland in February 2023.

In 1972, during The Troubles, a bomb went off prematurely near Crumlin, killing two IRA members.

Crumlin&#x27;s proximity to Belfast has led to it becoming a local business area, with international venues, including hosting the headquarters of Randox Laboratories and Lidl in Northern Ireland.

== Education ==
*Crumlin Integrated College
*St. Joseph&#x27;s Primary School
*Crumlin Integrated Primary
*Gaelscoil Ghleann Darach

===Irish language===
In recent years, a growing Irish-speaking community has evolved in the area and Crumlin now caters for both pre-school and primary school education through the medium of Irish. Naíscoil and Gaelscoil Ghleann Darach now has almost 70 children attending the Irish medium school and almost 30 in the nursery, with 15 members of staff. The Gaelscoil (primary school) is recognised by the Department of Education.

Two voluntary groups, Cumann Gaeilge and Cairde Ghleann Darach, encourage and support the school and promotion of the Irish language. The local societies help organise fund-raisers for the local schools and clubs and organise Irish language classes, an annual Irish language funday, a céilí, a bi-lingual pub quiz, and other events in the area.

==Sport==
Crumlin United F.C provides association football for more than 300 men, women, boys and girls, from under-6 to senior level. Broader membership of approx. 400. Crumlin United own a 9-acre ground with grass playing surfaces and a full size 3G playing service. The team entered the County Antrim Senior Shield in 2018, bringing competitive Senior Football to the village of Crumlin for the first time in history.

St James&#x27; Aldergrove GAC is a well established Gaelic Athletic Association with 13 teams incorporating men&#x27;s and ladies football as well as being strongly represented at all levels underage. The club currently has a player base in excess of 300 and broader membership of approx. 500. The Club provides structured Gaelic football for boys and girls, as well as social and cultural events. The senior men&#x27;s team was promoted to Division 1 in 2012 for the first time in the club&#x27;s history and stayed there until relegation in 2017. They also won the Antrim Intermediate Championship in 2019 for the first time since 1977 and represented Antrim in the Ulster Intermediate Championship.

Crumlin river hosts fishing and angling for salmon and dollaghan.

Community Netball is also offered Crumlin Leisure Centre as well as martial arts.

==Community relations==
In the past, Orange Order parades occurred without incident and the main street in July is decorated with an Orange Arch which flies unionist flags from it.

In 2012, The Twelfth celebration for a wider area was held in Crumlin for the first time in 12 years, a march which surpassed previous parades in terms of size and the number of bands and participants taking part. Some pre-march tension was evident and a Parades Commission determination appeared to rule in favour of the residents opposed to the parade based on its size and because they felt they weren&#x27;t given adequate notice by the organisers of the parade.

Talks were held between the residents and organisers, leading to the parade passing off peacefully. The agreement was heralded as a success and as a possible blueprint for other contentious marches.

<text>Allston is an officially recognized neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It was named after the American painter and poet Washington Allston. It comprises the land covered by the zip code 02134. For the most part, Allston is administered collectively with the adjacent neighborhood of Brighton. The two are often referred to together as Allston–Brighton. Boston Police Department District D-14 covers the Allston-Brighton area and a Boston Fire Department Allston station is located in Union Square which houses Engine 41 and Ladder 14. Engine 41 is nicknamed &quot;The Bull&quot; to commemorate the historic stockyards of Allston.

Housing stock varies but largely consists of brick apartment buildings, especially on Commonwealth Avenue and the streets directly off it, while areas further down Brighton Avenue, close to Brighton, are largely dotted with wooden triple-deckers. Lower Allston, across the Massachusetts Turnpike from the southern portion of Allston, consists of mostly 1890–1920s single-family and multi-family Victorian homes.

==Area description==

Allston borders the Boston neighborhoods of Fenway, Kenmore, and Brighton and the town of Brookline. Allston is bordered on the east and north by the Charles River, and the Cambridge, Massachusetts is accessible via several bridges.

The area north of the turnpike near the Charles River is known as Lower Allston (or North Allston). It consists of streets north of Cambridge Street and the Turnpike, all the way to the Charles River. It extends westward to Everett Street and eastward to the Charles River. In its center is Allston Square at the crossroads of Western Avenue and North Harvard Street. Allston is named for the great painter and 1800 Harvard graduate, Washington Allston, &quot;The Father of American Romanticism&quot;. Allston Square is appropriately located halfway between Harvard Square in the north and Allston Village, Boston&#x27;s &#x27;Greenwich Village&#x27; in the south. Allston claims to be the only community in America named for an artist.

Lower Allston is a small neighborhood that consists of a mix of young professionals, blue-collar tradesmen, members of the educational community, homeowners, and long-term residents. Unlike the rest of Allston, Lower Allston has far fewer students. The neighborhood is very quiet, has extremely low crime, and is an easy walk to Allston Village or Harvard Square.

Lower Allston has close proximity to Route 2, the Mass Pike, Storrow Drive, and Soldiers Field Road. Public transportation includes the Red Line at Harvard Square, the Green Line at Packard&#x27;s Corner or Harvard Avenue and Commonwealth Avenue and the 57, 66, 70, 71, and 86 bus connections on North Harvard Street and Western Avenue.

In the early 21st century, Harvard University announced dramatic expansion plans that called for major building projects, including the demolition of existing businesses, to prepare for the construction of new biology and science buildings in the northern sections of Lower Allston. While the existing building stock was demolished and businesses were evicted, the financial crisis of 2008 and the resultant decrease in Harvard&#x27;s endowment caused the university to suspend the expansion projects. In 2016, Harvard began building again, has completed two new buildings and is starting on the new, state-of-the-art Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences on Western Avenue west of Allston Square by the Charles River. Later, it will begin construction of the &quot;Gateway&quot; building on the northeastern corner of Allston Square.

==History==

Allston was an eastern section of the former town of Brighton.

In 1867, a new railroad depot for the Boston and Albany Railroad opened. In 1868 the station and post office in Brighton&#x27;s eastern portion were given the name &quot;Allston&quot; after Washington Allston, the noted painter who had lived and worked across the Charles River in the Cambridgeport section of Cambridge. It can even be said to have been named for a specific painting: Washington Allston&#x27;s &quot;Fields West of Boston&quot;.

Allston has never existed as a separate political entity in its own right. Brighton was annexed by the City of Boston in 1874. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow owned several properties in Allston. In 1887 the wooden depot was replaced by the station depicted at the right. In 1888 Boston&#x27;s first trolley route began there, running a route through Coolidge Corner, Brookline, to Boylston Street, to downtown Boston.

The Allston community developed largely around large railroad and livestock operations. The Boston and Albany Railroad operated a major rail yard. Stockyards and a large abattoir operated nearby in the northern part of Brighton. All livestock activity ended by the mid-20th century, although much of the rail yard remained in use until 2013 as CSX Transportation&#x27;s Beacon Park Yard.

A strip running from Brighton Avenue in Allston out Commonwealth Avenue toward Kenmore Square was Boston&#x27;s original &quot;Automile&quot;, lined with automobile dealerships. Packard&#x27;s Sales Stable and Riding School gave Packard&#x27;s Corner its name, which was then perpetuated by the presence of an opulent Packard dealership. Only a Toyota dealer and a Vespa dealer remain, but the windowed buildings along the eastern end of Brighton Avenue reflect this history.

The Massachusetts Turnpike Extension, built largely on part of the Boston and Albany right-of-way, opened through Allston in 1964 and 1965.

==Culture==
Allston is home to numerous small businesses and restaurants. Brighton Avenue, between Packard&#x27;s Corner and Allston Street, boasts various ethnic and national cuisines from around the world. Harvard Avenue hosts a number of furniture stores, thrift shops, and stores that offer items for resale, due to the large student body and high residential turnover.

The section of the neighborhood that lies immediately south of the turnpike and centers on the stretch of Harvard Avenue between Commonwealth Avenue and Cambridge Street also houses many shops, bars, and restaurants. Recent business promotion initiatives have dubbed this area &quot;Allston Village&quot;. This area is also home to a concentration of Korean American businesses and restaurants.

===Allston Christmas===

Annually, during days leading up to and following September 1, Allston, the Fenway-Kenmore area, the Longwood area, Mission Hill, and Brighton (among many others in Greater Boston) experience a period known as Allston Christmas. This period is referred to as such because it is the time of year when renters (many of whom are college students) move out their things so new renters (also frequently college students) can move in.

A large number of rental agreements in Greater Boston expire on September 1, just before the Labor Day weekend, causing large numbers of tenants to move to their new quarters simultaneously. This synchronized mass movement also makes it difficult to rent large vehicles during the weeks surrounding September 1. The renters who are leaving often put their unwanted possessions out in the streets for those who may want the items, which include bedding, couches, tables, kitchenware, and clothing. Unsalvaged items also contribute to unusually large trash and recycling pickups scheduled around the time.

===Music===
Music venues in Allston include Brighton Music Hall (formerly Harpers Ferry), O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Pub, Paradise Rock Club, Scullers Jazz Club, and The Silhouette Lounge.

Several recording studios are located in the neighborhood, such as Galaxy Park, established in 1999. Allston&#x27;s music scene includes a DIY community. The annual Allston-Brighton parade and annual Allston DIY Fest feature many of the neighborhood&#x27;s musical acts.

In the 1960s, Boston Mayor Kevin White developed Summerthing, a series of free concerts performed at Allston&#x27;s Ringer Park. Several Rock and Roll Hall of Fame artists played for free, including The Byrds, Bo Diddley, BB King and Chuck Berry.

===Sports===
Major League Baseball&#x27;s Boston Braves played at Braves Field (now Boston University&#x27;s Nickerson Field) at Allston&#x27;s eastern edge, from 1915 to 1952. The Boston Patriots of the American Football League (now the New England Patriots of the National Football League) played four seasons in Allston: at Nickerson Field in 1960 through 1962; and at Harvard Stadium in 1970.

==Education==
===Public schools===
Public schools in Allston are part of the school district of Boston Public Schools.

Gardner Pilot Academy (also called the Thomas Gardner School), located on Athol Street, serves Allston residents pre-kindergarten through grade eight. In April 2008, a science teacher at Gardner Pilot Academy won the &quot;Ultimate Science Classroom&quot;, a raffle prize furnished annually by the National Science Teachers Association. The school received approximately $40,000 in science teaching materials and apparatus.

The Horace Mann School for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing, located on Armington Street, is the oldest public school for the hearing impaired in the United States. The school was attended by Helen Keller and Alexander Graham Bell&#x27;s work at the school inspired him to begin experiments in an apparatus to help deaf children hear. These experiments eventually led to the telephone. The school serves the hearing impaired in Boston from pre-kindergarten through twelfth grade.

Jackson Mann School, also on Armington Street, serves residents from kindergarten through eighth grade.

===Private schools===
German International School Boston (previously called &quot;German School Boston&quot;), located on Holton Street, is a private, bilingual, international school in Boston, Massachusetts. This German school abroad was established in 2001 and officially inaugurated by Former German President Johannes Rau. The upper campus serves grades one through twelve, and the lower campus offers a preschool and kindergarten program. The school has over 300 students.

===Colleges and universities===
Allston lies near three major universities. A substantial part of the campus of Harvard University, including Harvard Business School and most athletic facilities (such as the Bright-Landry Hockey Center, Harvard Stadium, and the Lavietes Pavilion), are in North Allston. Harvard also owns large portions of other land in North Allston, much of which it plans to develop as an academic campus, particularly for the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences, as well as an auxiliary site for the Harvard Medical School and other healthcare-related programs. Eventually, Harvard&#x27;s Allston campus will be physically larger than their original Cambridge campus. 
Boston University lies along Commonwealth Avenue to the east, with numerous schools and facilities extending from Kenmore Square to Packard&#x27;s Corner. The New Balance Field of Boston University symbolizes further integration of BU into the Allston community and is the first in a series of projects that have included the creation of a major new dormitory building in the area. Berklee College of Music also has a practice and rehearsal building near Commonwealth Avenue on Fordham Road which runs between Commonwealth Avenue and Brighton Avenue.

==Transportation==

The B branch of the Boston MBTA subway Green Line runs through the neighborhood along Commonwealth Avenue. Until 1969, the Green Line A branch to Watertown Square ran along Brighton Avenue. Today, MBTA Bus Route 57 runs on a similar route. From 2014 to March 2016, the MBTA included bus route 57 in its late night service, running until 3 am. The City of Boston and the MBTA installed bus lane between Union Square and Packard&#x27;s Corner with construction starting in 2019 to alleviate congestion and speed up bus travel times. Other MBTA bus lines serve Allston, including routes 64, 66, 70 and 86. In 2017, 34.2% of Allston residents commuted by mass transit, while 24.3% commuted by walking and another 6.6% commuted by bicycle.

Until 2013, the CSX Railroad operated the large Beacon Park freight yard which runs adjacent to the Massachusetts Turnpike; the land has been purchased by Harvard. In May 2006, Harvard officials said that they wanted a infill commuter rail stop in Allston on the Framingham/Worcester line. This would restore service lacking since the closure of the Allston train depot. , there had been actions by the state legislature to restore train service in the area. In June 2012, plans were announced for a station to be called Boston Landing, located in Brighton, to serve the Allston-Brighton area. Originally intended to open in 2014, the station finally opened in 2017.In September 2014, plans for a $25 million commuter rail station called West Station were announced. The station&#x27;s construction will coincide with a plan to straighten the Massachusetts Turnpike over the former CSX rail yard. The new station will initially operate exclusively on the Worcester/Framingham line but will be constructed with four platforms to accommodate future uses that may include rapid-transit service to North Station via the existing Grand Junction Railroad through Cambridge and Somerville.

==Demographics==
The estimated population of Allston is 28,621, according to the 2020 Census. The median home cost is $632,000, an incline of 5.2% in the last year. The cost of living is 48.7% higher than the national average. The population density is 14,035/mi2. The median age is 27.

Allston is home to many immigrant populations, the largest groups being from Russia, East Asia (particularly Korea), South Asia, and South America (particularly Brazil and Colombia).

Young adults (age 18-34) make up 80.8% of the neighborhood&#x27;s population (as compared to 39.1% for the city of Boston as a whole). The high concentration of students and &quot;twenty-somethings&quot; has created tension between some long-time residents and the student population which constantly cycles in and out as students matriculate and graduate from Boston&#x27;s many colleges and universities. In addition to nightly dancing and live music at area bars, house parties abound on surrounding streets, particularly during the school year. This has long been a sore point among other Allston residents.

The largest religious affiliation is Catholic (48.2%), followed by unspecified Christian (4.9%), Baptist (2%), and Muslim (1%).

===Race===


==Events==
*Allston Squirt Gun Day is an unsanctioned event organized by young residents and held yearly in late August. Participants are asked to wear green and gather at the intersection of Harvard Avenue and Brighton Avenue. The event is typically short-lived as it creates a panic among those unaware of what is going on. In 2009, the Squirt Gun festivities continued as a sanctioned event at nearby Ringer Park.
*In 2005, the New England Foundation for the Arts selected a site in Allston for its Art &amp; Community Landscapes program. The artist team of Legge Lewis Legge was chosen to design this site which is known as the Lincoln Street Green Strip.
*Each year the community hosts the Allston Village Street Fair on Harvard Avenue between Brighton Avenue and Cambridge Street. The fair features live performances, international food, and local businesses, along with family-friendly activities.
*In 2012, Aerosmith played a set in front of their former residence at 1325 Commonwealth Avenue. They were introduced by the New England Patriots players (most notably Tom Brady), owner Robert Kraft, and cheerleaders.
*Allston is home to the annual Rat City Arts Festival, so named as a play on the neighborhood&#x27;s nickname of Allston Rock City, due its high concentration of musicians, and as an allusion to the neighborhood&#x27;s large population of rats. The festival aims to showcase Allston and Boston artists, as well as to raise awareness of the rat problem.
*Every year, Commonwheels, an Allston DIY bike organization, holds the Allston Rat Race, a cross between an alleycat race and a community festival. Entrants ride a course through the neighborhood with optional stops, each of which features a zany activity that highlights a feature of the community and encourages broader knowledge of neighborhood amenities and organizations.

==In popular culture==
*Allston&#x27;s ZIP Code &quot;02134&quot; is famously identified due to a recurring musical piece on the PBS children&#x27;s series &quot;ZOOM&quot;, whose originating station, WGBH, was located on Western Avenue east of Allston Square until 2008. 
*Big D and the Kids Table, a ska band, makes multiple references to Allston within their songs.
*Massachusetts grindcore band Anal Cunt has written several contemptuous songs that reference Allston in a pejorative way, such as &quot;You Live in Allston&quot;, &quot;Everyone in Allston Should be Killed&quot; and &quot;I Just Saw the Gayest Guy on Earth&quot;.
*Allston contains several locations in the David Foster Wallace novel &quot;Infinite Jest&quot; and the book includes in a footnote, &quot;PS: Allston rules!&quot;

<doc id="1090212" wikidata="Q6141437" url="?curid=1090212" title="USS Pargo (SS-264)">
<text>USS &quot;Pargo&quot; (SS-264), a &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine, was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named for the pargo, a fish of the genus &quot;Lutjanus&quot; found in the West Indies.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Pargo&quot; was laid down on 21 May 1942 by the Electric Boat Company at Groton, Connecticut; launched 24 January 1943, sponsored by Miss Belle W. Baruch; and commissioned on 26 April 1943, Lieutenant Commander Ian C. Eddy in command.

== First and second war patrols, August – December 1943 ==
Following shakedown and training &quot;Pargo&quot; sailed via the Panama Canal to Pearl Harbor, arriving 23 July 1943. The first of her eight war patrols began 18 August and took her into the East China Sea where she twice attacked the enemy, inflicting undetermined damage to several ships before returning to Pearl Harbor 6 October.

After refitting &quot;Pargo&quot; sailed 30 October in company with and in a wolf-pack. The efforts of the three were well directed against the open sea area northwest of the Marianas where &quot;Pargo&quot; sank two freighters, &quot;Manju Maru&quot; and &quot;Shoko Maru&quot; totaling 7,810 tons, on 29 and 30 November.

== Third, fourth, and fifth war patrols, March – October 1944 ==

&quot;Pargo&quot; next underwent overhaul and received a new engine at Mare Island Naval Shipyard. On 5 March 1944 she was underway for Pearl Harbor and 25 March began her third war patrol. Her mission, to destroy enemy ships in the Philippine and Celebes Seas areas was carried out with several attacks, one of which sank an ex-net tender. &quot;Pargo&quot; began refitting at Fremantle, Australia 24 May.

Underway 13 June for the Celebes Sea, &quot;Pargo&quot; noted fewer ships present in the area. She scored well again, however, damaging several and sinking a 5,236 ton cargo ship, &quot;Yamagibu Maru&quot;.

&quot;Griffin&quot; (AS-13) refitted &quot;Pargo&quot; at Fremantle to prepare her for her next patrol. From 3 September to 7 October she ranged the South China Sea, pressing her attacks to damage several Japanese ships and to sink two more, including a minelayer.

24 August 1944 LCDR David B. Bell took command of the USS Pargo over from CDR Ian C. Eddy.

== Sixth and seventh war patrols, October 1944 – March 1945 ==
On 28 October &quot;Pargo&quot; sailed from western Australian waters in company with for her sixth patrol. From Exmouth Gulf she continued alone into the South China Sea where she found that increased allied air activity had further diminished use of the shipping lanes. She sank tanker &quot;Yuho Maru&quot; off Brunei Bay 26 November. Following this action she received from escorts the worst depth charging of her career, but escaped without serious damage, and returned to Australia 21 December.

Replenishment and retraining ensued, and on 15 January 1945 &quot;Pargo&quot; got underway for the Indo-China coast. Six days out she launched a night torpedo attack that damaged several ships. On 10 February she again engaged the enemy and ten days later blew up destroyer &quot;Nokaze&quot;. &quot;Pargo&quot; then sailed via Saipan and Pearl Harbor to Mare Island for a modernization overhaul which lasted from 25 March to 17 June.

== Eighth war patrol, July – September 1945 ==
The submarine&#x27;s eighth and final patrol spanned the 42-day interval from 14 July to 9 September. Transiting the minefields of Tsushima Straits, she entered the Sea of Japan where she attacked a six-ship convoy. She made her last sinking on 8 August, the passenger-cargo ship &quot;Rashin Maru&quot;, to total nine for the war. After Japanese capitulation, &quot;Pargo&quot; remained in the mine-filled waters until after the peace terms were signed and then sailed for Guam.

Returning to Pearl Harbor with the knowledge that she had contributed materially to the victory in the Pacific, Pargo assumed post-war duties as part of the squadron based there. She was decommissioned 12 June 1946 and was assigned to train Naval Reservists in the 13th Naval District where she remained until 1 June 1960 when her name was struck from the Navy List. &quot;Pargo&quot; was sold 17 April 1961.

&quot;Pargo&quot; received eight battle stars for World War II service. All eight of her war patrols were designated as &quot;successful&quot;. She is credited with having sunk a total of 27,983 tons of enemy shipping.

<doc id="1090213" wikidata="Q2508354" url="?curid=1090213" title="Donhead St Mary">
<text>Donhead St Mary is a village and civil parish in southwest Wiltshire, England, on the county border with Dorset. The village lies about east of the Dorset town of Shaftesbury and stands on high ground above the River Nadder, which rises in the parish.

In the south of the parish, on the A30 Salisbury-Shaftesbury road, are the village of Ludwell and its neighbouring hamlet of Birdbush; Charlton hamlet is south of the road. To the north are the hamlets of Coombe, comprising Higher Coombe, Middle Coombe and Lower Coombe. In the north-west of the parish, near Shaftesbury, is the hamlet of Higher Wincombe.

== History ==
Castle Rings, an Iron Age hillfort, is in the far north of the parish. A Roman road between Bath and Badbury Rings ran north–south through the parish, past the future sites of St Mary&#x27;s church and Ludwell village.

Donhead St Mary and its neighbour Donhead St Andrew were once part of a single Donhead estate which belonged to Shaftesbury Abbey. In the 11th century the boundary between the two parishes was drawn, and in the 12th century each had a church.

Donhead Hall, a Grade II* listed country house south of the village, was built in 1724 for Godfrey Huckle (later Kneller; died 1781), a grandson of the portrait painter Sir Godfrey Kneller. The Baroque curves of its design are similar to those of Thomas Archer&#x27;s Chettle House, not far away in Dorset.

In 1842 a National School was built close to St John&#x27;s church, replacing an earlier school; it closed in 1876 after the opening of a new school at Ludwell, which continues in use as Ludwell Community Primary School.

In 1875 another National School was built near St Mary&#x27;s Church, replacing an earlier school of 1840. This school closed in 1922 and its pupils transferred to Ludwell. The building became the village hall.

In 1945 a private Roman Catholic day and boarding school for girls, known as St Mary&#x27;s School, Shaftesbury, opened at Coombe House, Higher Coombe. It closed in 2020.

== Religious sites ==

=== Parish church ===
In the 12th century the Church of England parish church of St Mary the Virgin was small and without aisles. Later in that century the south aisle was added, and in the 13th the nave gained a clerestory. In the 14th century the south porch was added, and most of the tower is from the 15th century. In 1966 the church was designated as Grade I listed. In 1980 the benefice was united with Donhead St Andrew and Charlton; today the parish is part of the Benefice of St Bartholomew.

The former rectory, now named Shute House, is a Grade II listed building. The gardens surrounding the house were designed by Geoffrey Jellicoe and are Grade II* listed on the Historic England&#x27;s Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

=== Others ===

There was a chapel at Charlton from the 14th century. In 1839 it was replaced by the church of St John the Baptist, built near the main road to be accessible from Ludwell and the Coombes. The church is in Neo-Norman style with a two-tower west facade.

A Wesleyan Methodist church was built in the south of Donhead St Mary village in 1837, and rebuilt in 1868. This was part of the Shaftesbury and Gillingham Wesleyan Methodist Circuit, and later the North Dorset Circuit. The church closed in 2007 and is now a private home. Primitive Methodists built a chapel at Ludwell in or before 1861, which closed c. 1965.

==Local government==
Donhead St Mary is a civil parish with an elected parish council. It is in the area of the Wiltshire Council unitary authority, responsible for most significant local government functions.

<text>Jacob Millman (1911 in Novohrad-Volynskyi, Russian Empire – May 22, 1991 in Longboat Key, Florida) was a professor of electrical engineering at Columbia University. He immigrated to the United States in 1913 with his mother, Gertrude (Nachshen) Millman and sister Rebecca.

Millman received a PhD from MIT in 1935. He joined Columbia University in 1951, and retired in 1975. From 1941 to 1987, Millman wrote eight textbooks on electronics, and he helped develop radar systems. Millman&#x27;s theorem (otherwise known as the parallel generator theorem) is named after him. He received in 1970 the IEEE Education Medal.

Millman died of pneumonia at his home in Longboat Key, Florida in 1991.

<doc id="1090217" wikidata="Q551354" url="?curid=1090217" title="Garrett Wang">
<text>Garrett Richard Wang (; ; born December 15, 1968) is an American actor best known for his role of Ensign Harry Kim in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Wang was born in Riverside, California, to Taiwanese American immigrant parents. He has one sister. Growing up, Wang moved often. He attended kindergarten in Indiana before moving to Bermuda, then to Memphis, Tennessee, and then back to California.

In the summer of 1990, he attended a Taiwanese-state sponsored cultural exchange program. One of the reasons he decided to become an actor was to be a role model for other Asian-Americans seeking work in the entertainment industry, a predominantly non-Asian environment. Wang graduated from Harding Academy High School in Memphis.

Wang&#x27;s parents did not support his acting ambitions. His father emigrated from Taiwan to attend graduate school in the States and did not view acting as a stable career choice. His mother was accepted to the Taiwan School of Drama in her youth, but did not attend it due to her father&#x27;s objections. When his parents met actress Bonnie Franklin at an airport in Hawaii, she told them that Wang would never make it in the business. His mother eventually even suggested that he join the military to learn some discipline.

Wang attended college at the University of California, Los Angeles. He switched majors multiple times, going from biology to political science to history to economics and finally Asian studies, with all his upper-division electives in theater.

==Career==
When Wang decided to become a full-time actor, he made a deal with his parents that, if he was not successful within two years, he would quit, on the condition that they helped finance his expenses. After finding no work for months, he managed to book a few roles in commercials. This exposure got him a guest-star role in 1994 on the episode &quot;Submission:Impossible&quot; of Margaret Cho&#x27;s &quot;All-American Girl&quot; as Raymond Han, a financially stable single doctor.

Wang starred in Eric Koyanagi&#x27;s MFA thesis film at USC film school, &quot;Angry Cafe&quot; (1995). He subsequently came back to star in Koyanagi&#x27;s feature directorial debut, &quot;hundred percent&quot; (1998), which also was Wang&#x27;s feature debut. Both films were written and directed by, and starred Asian Americans.

A year and a half after his wager with his parents, Wang landed his best-known role, that of Ensign Harry Kim in &quot;Star Trek: Voyager&quot;, which ran from 1995 to 2001.

In 2005, Wang played Chow Ping in the TV miniseries &quot;Into The West&quot;, which was executive produced by Steven Spielberg.

He played Garan in the 2007 fan production &quot;Star Trek: Of Gods and Men&quot;, saying, &quot;it’s always more challenging for an actor to play the bad guy.&quot;

=== Theatre ===
In 1993, while a student at UCLA, Wang portrayed John Lee, a gay British Chinese teenager who kills his Irish lover, in Chay Yew&#x27;s play, &quot;Porcelain&quot;, at the now defunct Burbage Theater in Sawtelle, Los Angeles.

==&quot;Star Trek&quot;==
From early childhood on, actor Garrett Wang was a science-fiction fan, in particular of &quot;Star Wars&quot; and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;.

He watched all the &quot;Star Trek &quot;films that came out in the theaters, but didn&#x27;t follow &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; (TNG) prior to working on &quot;Voyager&quot;. The first season-one TNG episode he saw was &quot;Code of Honor&quot;, which he said all Trek writers considered &quot;the worst episode ever produced&quot;. On three occasions, within a year and a half, he tried to watch TNG again, and it was always a repeat of &quot;Code of Honor&quot;. 

On a convention panel in 2015, Wang said of this: &quot;I realized God was telling me ‘Don’t become a fan of TNG!’ Because I would have been too nervous to audition for Voyager. So really, God helped me get on Voyager.&quot;

At Star Trek Las Vegas in 2014, Wang was announced to be reprising his role as Harry Kim in &quot;Delta Rising&quot;, the second expansion of the massively multiplayer online role-playing game, &quot;Star Trek Online&quot;.

=== Conventions ===
Wang has been a celebrity moderator interviewing other celebrities at various conventions around the world since 2008.

In 2010, he was named the director of the Trek Track for Dragon Con, becoming the first actor to work behind the scenes at a convention.

Wang has participated in the Calgary Comic and Entertainment Expo, in 2012 interviewing Stan Lee and being present at a booth among other exhibitors, and as a surprise speaker at TNG Exposed.

== Personal life ==
Through November 2017, Wang hosted a weekly podcast on Twitch. He discussed his post-Star Trek work as a convention moderator, and other anecdotes of his life.

He currently co-hosts The Delta Flyers Podcast with Robert Duncan McNeill, who portrayed Tom Paris in &quot;Voyager&quot;.

He is a Baptist.

<doc id="1090219" wikidata="Q3404679" url="?curid=1090219" title="Crumlin, Caerphilly">
<text>Crumlin () is a town, community and electoral ward in Caerphilly county borough in South Wales. It is situated in the Ebbw River valley, west of Pontypool, within the historic boundaries of Monmouthshire.

==History==
The name is said to be derived from cromlech, a type of megalithic construction. 

&quot;Kelly&#x27;s Directory of South Wales&quot; (1895) noted that Crumlin was &quot;a secluded village, scarcely known to any beyond the few persons resident there&quot;. It considered Crumlin one of the most picturesque spots in the county, surrounded by natural features of &quot;unsurpassed loveliness&quot;.

The village sits in the South Wales Coalfield and in the neighbouring quarries are often found fine fossils of calamites and lepidodendron; and, in the shale outcrops, fossil ferns and other cryptogamic plants.

==Crumlin Viaduct==

Crumlin is famous for its former railway viaduct. Work by the designer and contractor Thomas W. Kennard commenced in autumn 1853, and the viaduct opened in June 1857 for the Taff Vale Extension to the Newport, Abergavenny and Hereford Railway. At 200 feet high and 550 yards in length in two spans (355 yards and 195 yards), it remained the highest railway viaduct in Great Britain throughout its working life. 

Nearby were the two Crumlin railway stations, at high (viaduct) and valley levels. The low level station closed in 1962, and the viaduct and high level station closed in 1964 under the Beeching cuts.

Plans for preserving the viaduct were discussed, but the poor state of repair made this impossible, and it was dismantled between 1966 and 1967. Even while demolition work was in progress, scenes for the film &quot;Arabesque,&quot; which starred Sophia Loren and Gregory Peck, were shot on it. As of 2019, the abutments remain visible on the valley sides.

==Historic industry==
Crumlin was the northern terminus of the Crumlin Arm of the Monmouthshire Canal. The canal was built from Crumlin southwards towards Newport, opening in 1794, but not completed at Fourteen Locks until 1799. Tramroads from the ironworks at Ebbw Vale and Nantyglo were built to the canal at Crumlin basin, where the iron was transhipped into canal boats.

When the viaduct was built, the canal was shortened as one of the pillars needed to be located in its path. The canal is no longer in evidence, as it was filled in the late 1960s for the construction of the A467 road.

The Crumlin Viaduct Works Company Limited produced the ironwork for the Crumlin Viaduct. They also produced the ironwork for the first Blackfriars Railway Bridge for the London, Chatham and Dover Railway, 120 bridges in Buenos Aires, Argentina, 69 bridges for the Rome and Ancona Railway in Italy, 5 multi-span bridges for railways in India, a 17-span bridge in Pernambuco, Brazil, and bridges in New Ross, Ireland, the Murray River, Australia and Wolkoff for the Great Russian Railway.

==Crumlin Navigation Colliery==
The Navigation Colliery was in Crumlin. The sinking of mine shafts began in 1907, and it opened fully in 1911. The colliery produced 145,000 tonnes of coal annually at its peak, and it closed in 1967. Many colliery buildings remain preserved to the north of the town.

The colliery site contains thirteen Grade II and II* listed buildings and is managed by the charity Glofa Navigation Cyf for the benefit of the community.

==Crumlin Mining School==
The Mine Rescue Station was opened in Station Road, Crumlin in 1910 and closed in 1986. It was the first in the South Wales Coalfield. In 1914, the South Wales and Monmouthshire School of Mines at Treforest established a sister school for part-time students at Crumlin Hall, which later became the Crumlin Mining and Technical College. Crumlin Hall was previously Thomas Kennard&#x27;s home.

<text>Seán Moylan (19 November 1889 – 16 November 1957) was a senior officer of the Irish Republican Army and later a Fianna Fáil politician. He served as Minister for Agriculture from May 1957 to November 1957, Minister for Education from 1951 to 1954, Minister for Lands from 1943 to 1948, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance from February 1943 to June 1943 and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1937 to 1943. He became a Senator from May 1957 to November 1957, after being nominated by the Taoiseach. He was also elected as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1921 to 1923 and from 1932 to 1957.

==Biography==

Moylan was born in Kilmallock, County Limerick, in 1889. He was educated locally and was from a strong republican background which saw him join the Gaelic League and the Gaelic Athletic Association (GAA). He trained as a carpenter&#x27;s apprentice and worked in Dublin. In 1914, Moylan joined the Kilmallock division of the Irish Volunteers but left in 1914, when his apprenticeship finished and he moved to set up a business in Newmarket, County Cork. There he joined the local division of the Volunteers again.

Following reorganisation after the 1916 Easter Rising, Moylan was appointed Captain of the Newmarket division. During the Irish War of Independence he was Commandant of the Cork No.2 Battalion of the Irish Republican Army and led the Active Service Unit in the north of County Cork during 1920. On 5 March 1921 Moylan led an ambush of a British convoy at Clonbanin (see Clonbanin ambush) in which Colonel Commandant Hanway Robert Cumming and other British officers were killed. He had risen to the rank of Officer Commanding the Cork No.2 Brigade when he was captured and interned in Spike Island in May 1921. Moylan was elected to Dáil Éireann, while in prison, as a Sinn Féin TD to the Second Dáil. He was released in August 1921 to attend the Dáil. Moylan opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty and left the Dáil with the other Anti-Treaty deputies following its ratification.

Moylan fought on the Republican side in the Irish Civil War. The north and west Cork area proved to be some of the last areas to fall to the pro-Treaty forces. He was Director of Operations of the Anti-Treaty forces and a member of the IRA Executive, holding the rank of commandant-general. In 1926, Moylan originally opposed the setting up of Fianna Fáil but joined the new party later that year. He was elected a Fianna Fáil TD for Cork North at the 1932 general election. He was appointed a Parliamentary Secretary in 1937. He was appointed to the Cabinet in 1943 as Minister for Lands. Moylan remained in this office until 1948 when the party went into opposition. He served as Minister for Education from 1951 until 1954, when Fianna Fáil lost power again. Moylan lost his Dáil seat at the 1957 general election, but was nominated by the Taoiseach to Seanad Éireann as a senator later that year. He was later appointed to the cabinet as Minister for Agriculture, making him the first senator to be appointed a government minister.

Seán Moylan died suddenly on 16 November 1957. He was buried in Kiskeam, County Cork. Speaking at an event commemorating the 50th anniversary of his death, Brian Lenihan Jnr suggested that Moylan was &quot;one of the most outstanding military leaders in the War of Independence&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Moylan is mentioned in the Irish folk ballad &quot;The Galtee Mountain Boy&quot;, along with Dinny Lacey, Dan Breen, and Seán Hogan. The song, written by Patsy Halloran, recalls some of the travels of a &quot;Flying column&quot; from Tipperary as they fought during the Irish War of Independence, and later against the pro-Treaty side during the Irish Civil War.

<text>Felix Anthony &quot;Tippy&quot; Martinez (born May 31, 1950) is an American former professional baseball left-handed pitcher. He pitched 14 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB) between 1974 and 1988, primarily as a relief pitcher. The majority of his career (1976–1986) was spent as a member of the Baltimore Orioles, where he was a member of 1983 World Series championship team.

==Career==
Martinez was drafted by the Washington Senators in the 35th round of the 1969 amateur draft, but did not sign with the team. He began his MLB career with the New York Yankees in 1974 after signing as a free agent.

He was acquired along with Rick Dempsey, Scott McGregor, Rudy May and Dave Pagan by the Orioles for Ken Holtzman, Doyle Alexander, Elrod Hendricks, Grant Jackson and Jimmy Freeman at the trade deadline on June 15, 1976. He, Dempsey and McGregor became part of a nucleus that kept the Orioles as perennial contender for the next decade, culminating with the 1983 World Series championship.
===Three pickoffs against Toronto===
A notable Martinez achievement during the 1983 season was picking off Barry Bonnell, Dave Collins and Willie Upshaw at first base in a single frame of a ten-inning 7–4 win over the Toronto Blue Jays at Memorial Stadium on August 24. The Orioles, having replaced both their starting catcher and his backup while rallying to tie the game in the ninth inning, entered the tenth with reserve infielder Lenn Sakata in the game at catcher. Three consecutive Blue Jays hitters reached first base and each one, thinking it would be easy to steal a base on Sakata, took a big lead. Martinez picked off all three baserunners, then became the winning pitcher when the Orioles won the game on Sakata&#x27;s home run in the bottom of the tenth. 
===1983 playoffs===
He was on the mound when the Orioles clinched the division title in a 5–1 victory over the Brewers at Milwaukee County Stadium on September 25 and the pennant in Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, earning a save and a win respectively.

A grassroots fan club was created for Tippy Martinez near the bullpen in left field of Memorial Stadium in 1980, called &quot;Tippy&#x27;s Tweeters&quot;. Fans blew on an official Oriole Tweeter every time Martinez entered a game as a reliever, and when he struck out the side.

Martinez finished his MLB career with the Minnesota Twins in 1988. He posted a lifetime win–loss record of 55–42 with an ERA of 3.45. He also recorded 115 saves.

In December 2006, Martinez became the pitching coach of the York Revolution of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball.
