<text>Oldham Rugby League Football Club, is a professional rugby league football club based in Oldham, Greater Manchester, England. The club plays home games at Boundary Park and competes in Championship, the second tier of British rugby league.

Oldham have won the League Championship four times, Challenge Cup three times and the Second Division three times.

The clubs traditional home kits are red and white hooped jerseys, navy blue shorts and red socks. They share a local rivalry with Rochdale Hornets, Salford Red Devils and Swinton Lions and cross county rivalries with nearby Huddersfield Giants and Halifax.

==History==

===Early years===
In 1876, Oldham Football Club was founded in a meeting at the Prince Albert Hotel, Union Street West, attended by Chairman of the Watch Committee, William Chadwick, Chief Constable Charles Hodgkinson, mill owner Fred Wild, eminent local Quaker and Lord to be Alfred Emmott and three brothers of the Fletcher family.

A playing field was organised at Sugar Meadow, Gartside Street adjacent to Glodwick Spinning Mill and changing facilities were provided by the nearby Shakespeare Inn. The club&#x27;s headquarters were at the Black Swan Hotel, Bottom O&#x27;th Moor, Mumps. Their first match at Sugar Meadow was held on 21 October 1876 against Stalybridge. After two seasons they joined Oldham Cricket Club at the new Clarksfield ground before finding a more permanent home in 1889 at Watersheddings.
Oldham were one of the twenty-one clubs that left the Rugby Football Union to form the Northern Union in 1895. Oldham were fourth in the first title race of 1895–96 and second a year later. They were the second club to win the Challenge Cup after beating Hunslet 19–9 in 1899. Batley had won the first two finals.

Oldham finally won their first Championship title in 1904–05, just edging out Bradford Northern by three points. Oldham won the Lancashire League in 1897–98, 1900–01 and 1907–08 as well as the Lancashire County Cup in 1906–07. In the 1907–08 season, Oldham finished as league leaders but Hunslet were crowned champions in their historic all-four cups season after winning the Championship Final 12–2 in a replay after an initial 7–7 draw.

Another title success followed in 1909–10 as they beat Wigan in the Championship final. Also in that same season they managed to win the Lancashire League and Lancashire Cup. The following season, 1910–11, they beat Wigan again in the Championship final.

Oldham&#x27;s record attendance was set in 1912 when the visit of Huddersfield for a league match drew 28,000 spectators.

Oldham won the Lancashire League in 1921–22 and the Lancashire Cup in 1912–13, 1918–19 and 1923–24. The annual Law Cup was first contested against neighbours Rochdale Hornets on 7 May 1921. Having lost in the 1907, 1912 and 1924 Challenge Cup Finals, they finally won the trophy again in 1925 when they beat Hull Kingston Rovers 16–3 at Headingley, Leeds.

They beat the visiting Australasian team of the 1921–22 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain 15–5.

The club&#x27;s last Challenge Cup final was in 1927 when they beat Swinton 26–7 at Central Park, Wigan, their fourth consecutive final and revenge for their 9–3 defeat when the same teams met in the previous year&#x27;s match. In 1932–33, Oldham won the Lancashire Cup again.

===Post-war===

In the 1950s, Oldham won the Championship and other trophies with a side that included Alan Davies, John Etty, goalkicker Bernard Ganley, Jack Keith, Sid Little, Frank Pitchford, Derek &#x27;Rocky&#x27; Turner, Don Vines and Charlie Winslade.

On Monday 15 September 1952, record receipts were taken from a gate of 19,370 at Watersheddings to watch Oldham take on the Kangaroo tourists. The Australians lost only one of twenty-two club matches in Britain during that tour, but came close to defeat at Oldham, where the Roughyeds held them to a 7–7 draw.

Oldham played in the 1954–55 Championship Final at Maine Road, Manchester against Warrington. They also lost the Lancashire Cup final in a 2–12 defeat by Barrow in 1954.

Oldham&#x27;s success in the 1950s also included a Championship title – in 1956–57; the Lancashire League 1956–57 and 1957–58 and the Lancashire Cup 1955–56, 1956–57 and 1957–58. Oldham lost 16–13 to Wigan in the 1966 Lancashire Cup Final. In 1964, Oldham reached the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup against Hull Kingston Rovers, the tie is remembered for taking three games to find the winner, the first match at Headingley finished 5–5, the replay at Station Road, Swinton finished prematurely 17–14 in Oldham&#x27;s favour when the game was abandoned midway through the second half due to bad light, and the third game was won by Hull Kingston Rovers 12–2 at Fartown, Huddersfield.
Oldham were Division Two champions in 1963–64.

At the end of a disastrous 1969–70 season, when Oldham finished 29th out of 30 clubs in a single division, the committee was voted out of office en bloc and replaced by nine new officials and a new chairman in Arthur Walker. They brought in Graham Starkey as player-coach.

Dave Cox coached Oldham for 18 months until December 1978.

In the 1983–84 season, Oldham lost just two of their opening 11 Division One fixtures but collapsed around Christmas. After four defeats in five games, January&#x27;s home game against Leigh descended into a mass brawl before the referee abandoned the match. Both clubs were fined £1,000 and coach Peter Smethurst decided to quit. The club committee asked his assistant, Frank Barrow to step into the breach. His first game was against rock-bottom Whitehaven, winless after 22 matches. But the Cumbrians ran in seven tries, handing Oldham a 42–8 mauling, and prompting Barrow to resign minutes after the game. He was replaced on a temporary basis by Brian Gartland.

Oldham pleaded with the local council for a financial bail-out in April 1987. Oldham decided to float as a public limited company and sold their training ground to the council in May 1987. Oldham won the 1988 Division Two title and the Division Two Premiership but lost £135,000. They would win the Premiership again in 1989–90.

Peter Tunks took over a coaching role with Oldham. Tunk&#x27;s brief was clear: He had to sell most of his first team squad that had been relegated twice in 3 years, help to pay a tax bill of over 1 million pounds and sign promising players from the junior ranks. He narrowly missed promotion in the first year and took the team to the grand final where they were narrowly beaten. Over the next 2 years he got promotion to the top level for all the Oldham teams whilst getting young players like Chris Joynt, Barrie McDermott, David Bradbury, Gary Christie and Tommy Martyn to international level but due to the clubs massive debts run up by the previous management, Tunks was forced to sell his best players. Bob Lindner took over as captain-coach. The club sold the dilapidated Watersheddings in June 1994 for £1.25m to pay-off debts and moved to Oldham Athletic&#x27;s Boundary Park stadium on the nearby Chadderton/Royton boundary.
When a Rupert Murdoch funded Super League competition was proposed, part of the deal was that some traditional clubs would merge. Oldham were supposed to merge with Salford to form a club to be known as &quot;Manchester&quot; which would compete in the Super League. When Salford visited Oldham for a match on Good Friday, 14 April, supporters of both clubs demonstrated against the unpopular idea by invading the pitch during the interval. This merger was resisted and instead they adopted the name Oldham Bears and were founder members of the new league.

Relegation came in the second year of the new summer season, 1997, when they finished below Paris Saint-Germain. At campaign&#x27;s end, an attempt was made by chairman Jim Quinn to sell the team for an undisclosed price tag, with debts reportedly between £500,000 and £1,000,000. Instead, the club went bankrupt soon after, with its actual liabilities pegged at £2,000,000. A new team Oldham Roughyeds was then formed in December to play at a lower level. The new club was created by Chris Hamilton and a band of three directors. The &quot;Roughyeds&quot; tag had been a long accepted nickname for the old club. It is however generally accepted that the new club (Oldham Roughyeds) is a legal continuation of the old club formed in 1876.

===The Millennium===

Mike Ford retired as player-coach of Oldham in 2001 and in January the following year took up a post as defensive co-ordinator with the Irish Rugby Football Union. Oldham put Mark Knight in temporary charge of the first team. After a successful 2001 season, they narrowly missed out on promotion to the Super League, losing to Widnes 12–24 in the Northern Ford Premiership Grand Final.

During the 2002 season they played at Ashton United&#x27;s Hurst Cross ground in Ashton-under-Lyne, due to a dispute with Oldham Athletic over the use of Boundary Park.

Steve Molloy took charge of the Roughyeds after former boss John Harbin left to join Oldham Athletic as fitness conditioner and sports psychologist in July 2002. Under Molloy, Oldham won seven and drew two of their last 14 games. In doing so Oldham finished high enough to gain entry into National League One when the Northern Ford Premiership was split into two. In the first season of National League One, 2003, Oldham reached the last four of the play-offs. Although they still made the play-offs for the next couple of seasons trouble was waiting in the wings. Those troubles surfaced in March 2005, Oldham entered a creditors&#x27; voluntary agreement (CVA) with total debts of £325,000.

John Pendlebury resigned after three games as coach in March 2006 and was replaced by Steve Deakin, with very little money to spend and a poor squad the team finished the 2006 season with only one league win and were relegated to National League Two, the season ended on a high note though because the club paid its final payment of the CVA and would start the next season debt free. The Roughyeds also announced that they would stay at Boundary Park for the 2007 season after reaching agreement on a sliding scale rent.

===2007 – new ownership===

In 2007, a few games into the new season, the excavation and demolition firm, the William Quinn Group, acquired a 52% stake in the club. That stake was later increased to 75%. Bill Quinn became the club&#x27;s new chairman, with previous owners Chris Hamilton and Sean Whitehead remaining as directors.

On Friday 4 May 2007, Oldham took part in the first ever National League Two match broadcast live on British television, on Sky Sports. They won 34–26 away to the Crusaders in Bridgend, having trailed by 20 points after 45 minutes. The match was considered a warm-up for the Millennium Magic weekend in Cardiff the following day and, due to fans of Super League teams attending, attracted National League Two&#x27;s highest ever attendance of 3,441.

That National League Two attendance record was broken in the return fixture on Thursday, 30 August 2007 between Oldham and Crusaders, again in front of the Sky Sports cameras, when 4,327 fans turned up at Boundary Park beating the old record by 886. it was also Oldham&#x27;s largest attendance since the early 1990s. The event also raised around £8,000 for local charities and the rugby league players&#x27; benevolent fund.

Oldham finished their most successful season in recent years in 4th place on the National League Two table, they then played and won games against Swinton at home then Barrow away in the play-off to reach the National League Two Grand Final, but the game seemed a step too far for Oldham going down to an inspired Featherstone Rovers team at Headingley.

===2008 season summary===
Northern Rail Cup – Oldham enjoyed reasonable success in the Northern Rail Cup, achieving a win over National League One favourites, Salford at Boundary Park to enable them to make it through the group stage of the competition into the knockout stages where they faced and beat another National League One team in Whitehaven to progress to the quarter finals against Batley at Mount Pleasant, in a see-saw battle Oldham&#x27;s challenge died thanks to a dubious referee call followed up by a quick fire Batley try.

Challenge Cup – Oldham were the last non-Super League club to be knocked out of the 2008 Challenge Cup, going as far as the quarter finals before being beaten by Wakefield Trinity at Belle Vue.

National League Two – Despite winning more games and losing less games than Barrow but only winning 1 bonus point (to Barrow&#x27;s 5 points) all season Oldham finished 3rd in National League Two on points difference behind Barrow who came 2nd and Gateshead who won the league, Oldham would again have to face the route of the play-offs and like the previous year Oldham again reached the National League Two Grand Final, this time against Doncaster and like 2007 Oldham again lost to miss out on promotion to National League One losing 18–10 at Warrington&#x27;s Halliwell Jones Stadium, as a result of not gaining promotion to National League One coach Steve Deakin did not have his contract renewed.

===2009 season summary===

Tony Benson became head coach of Oldham.

2009 Championship 1 – Oldham finished fourth in the 2009 Co-operative Championship One table with a record of 10–1–7. The Roughyeds won 31–26 at home to Swinton in the first round of the play-offs before winning 54–30 at home to Hunslet Hawks. That set up a final eliminator against York City Knights, who finished third in the table, and the Roughyeds upset the hosts by winning 44–14 to reach the Grand Final again. But Oldham were beaten in the Grand Final for a third straight year, losing 28–26 to Keighley, who finished second in the table.

Roughyeds were told they would no longer be able to use Oldham Athletic&#x27;s Boundary Park in November 2009. The club went to Oldham Council for help. Oldham Council bought Whitebank Stadium from Oldham Boro F.C. and then entered into a lease agreement with Oldham Roughyeds RLFC.

The 2010 season saw a transition with the five home games were played out of town at Sedgley Park R.U.F.C.&#x27;s Park Lane ground in Whitefield. Roughyeds&#x27; first game at Whitebank took place on 9 May 2010 with the opposition being York. This was the first time that Oldham had played in a ground within Oldham borough since 1997. Home crowds are nearly double at Whitebank compared to Park Lane.

===2010s===
Oldham suffered relegation to League 1 at the end of the 2017 Championship season.
In 2019, they earned promotion back to the Championship after defeating Newcastle in the League 1 play off final.

<text>Dongzhu (东渚) is a town under the administration of Suzhou New District and Huqiu District (the two districts are temporarily combined now) Suzhou, Jiangsu, China, which located at the west of Suzhou City and by the Taihu Lake.

The changes of upper-level administration in the past years before contained in SND and Huqiu District were that, Wuzhong District, Wuxian City, Wu-County, in the reversed chronological order.

Historically, Dongzhu was closely related with the history of Suzhou which called the Country of Wu more than 2500 years ago. The loser King of Wu, Helu, who ever won the war with Goujian, the King of Yue (located now near Hangzhou), suicided at the top of the mountain of Yangshan (Sun-Mountain) in the area of Dongzhu. There are also other ruins in the Town Dongzhu.

==Industry==
Dongzhu is one of far less industrialized contrasts to those towns near around the Suzhou City. The main industry of Dongzhu now is still the agriculture, while it also featured in its traditional handcraft industry, handy embroidery, which is known as Suzhou Embroidery and sculpture of stone.

However, since it was contained into SND and Huqiu District, agricultural land was withdrawn conditionally by the administration, a new area is now prepared for the open of the city&#x27;s modern scientific research center, and is expected to be a great change for the town.

There are several bus systems go through Dongzhu, as well as recently established express way, so called Taihu Dadao, which make the time spent between Dongzhu and Suzhou City from more than an hour to now, only twenty-five minutes. There is also a traditional waterway—Xuguang Canal, connecting Taihu Lake with the City.

Although there are two domestic civil airports, Guangfu Airport and Shuofang Airport near the town, however, the air routes is limited in number. Many people there use the Pudong International Airport and Hongqiao Airport for international and domestic travel.

==Education==
There are two educational organizations in Dongzhu include one elementary and one middle school, and no organization for higher educations. The two schools are, Dongzhu Experimental Primary School and Dongzhu Middle School.

<text>The Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center (BPCRC) is a polar, alpine, and climate research center at Ohio State University founded in 1960.

==History and research==

The Byrd Polar Research Center (BPRC) at Ohio State University was established in 1960 as the Institute for Polar Studies. BPRC is the oldest research center at Ohio State University. The name was changed to the Byrd Polar Research Center in 1987 after the polar explorer and aviator Richard E. Byrd when Ohio State purchased the Byrd papers from the Byrd family in 1985.

BPRC conducts interdisciplinary research at the nexus of Earth Sciences and Engineering. BPRC is known for its ice core paleoclimatology research collecting ice core records from Earth&#x27;s highest and most remote ice fields and modeling polar climate variability. Studies at BPRC include paleoclimatology, remote sensing, polar meteorology, glacier dynamics, satellite hydrology, paleoceanography, environmental geochemistry, and climate change. BPRC houses the Polar Rock Repository and the Goldthwait Polar Library.

==Research groups==

===Environmental Geochemistry===

This Environmental Geochemistry group collects and analyzes soil and water samples from many locations around the world to study biogeochemical cycles, anthropogenic influences on natural systems, and to use geochemistry as a tool to learn more about various hydrological, biological and physical processes.

This group has conducted studies of the Dry Valleys region of Antarctica since 1993 as part of the NSF’s Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) program. Ongoing projects in Antarctica include drilling into the subglacial ecosystem of &quot;Blood Falls&quot; in the Dry Valleys and measuring glacial melt input into the Southern Ocean in West Antarctica. Additionally, the group has studied of the deposition of mercury on the landscape in the U.S. and in Antarctica, and led investigations of chemical and physical weathering of rocks of high-standing oceanic islands like Taiwan and New Zealand. Members of this group also study the impact of human activities in urban areas on streams and lakes around Ohio.

===Paleoceanography===

The Paleoceanography group uses information gathered from sea floor sediments to discover how changes in circulation, temperature, sea ice and glacier mass have affected the global climate system throughout Earth’s history. These data from the past are used to assess present and future climate changes. The main focus of this group&#x27;s research is on the Arctic Ocean and its history during the past several million years.

Sea floor sediments contain mineral and biological particles that are used for investigating past climate changes. A common type of biological particles is foraminifers, single-celled, amoeba-like protists that have a shell and either live on the sea bottom or float in the upper water column. There are an estimated 4,000 species living today. Foraminifers are sensitive to changes in their environment such as temperature and salinity, which makes them useful indicators (proxies) of past climate changes.

===Satellite Hydrology===

This group uses satellite-based measurements to study rivers, lakes, wetlands, and floodplains. Led by Profs. Douglas Alsdorf and Michael Durand, group members primarily use passive and active microwave measurements such as radar to measure surface water and snowpack. This group is working to better quantify the amount of water stored in snowpacks in the United States using satellite measurements.

This group is helping define an upcoming satellite, Surface Water and Ocean Topography. Rivers are fundamentally two-dimensional in their structure and function. This is evident in the Amazon River, where the floodplain width is measured in kilometres. Sensitive to climatic changes, arctic lakes pose another hydrologic measurement challenge. SWOT measurements will enable new under- standing of these complex systems. SWOT will track freshwater resources, and measure ocean currents. SWOT is a joint effort between NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, and the French space agency, CNES.

===Glacier Environmental Change===

The Glacier Environmental Change group researches patterns, processes, and impacts of environmental change, mostly in glaciated regions. We integrate methods of glacial geology, climatology, hydrology, and biogeochemistry. Specializing in tropical mountain regions, we study sites along the entire American Cordillera, in Africa, and in Central Ohio.
Glaciers impact environments and societies on different scales, from valleys to mountain ranges, spanning far into Earth’s past. Understanding glacier environmental changes requires many techniques and perspectives. Precise measurements from sensors on satellites and airplanes quantify ongoing glacier volume changes; landforms and lake sediments reveal past glacier-climate changes; the hydrochemistry of surface waters reflects glacier melt contribution; and computer simulations help explain past and future dynamics.

===Polar Meteorology===

The Polar Meteorology group has developed a model (Polar MM5) that is used to forecast weather conditions in the polar regions. The model has been used to stimulate conditions on the North American continent during the last ice age. In addition to weather prediction, the Polar MM5 model has been used for several simulations that examine the current and past climates over ice sheets, including one that illustrates conditions on the North American continent during the last ice age.

The Polar Meteorology Group also used the MM5 model to create what is called the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (or AMPS). AMPS is a forecasting system used to make weather forecasts for Antarctica and the surrounding Southern Ocean in support of the United States Antarctic Program.

===Polar Rock Repository===

BPRC maintains a large, unique collection of geological samples and materials at the Polar Rock Repository. The PRR is a national facility that houses rock sample collections from Antarctica obtained by U.S. scientists over the past 40+ years.

Dr. Anne Grunow is the curator of the Polar Rock Repository. It is the only facility of its kind in the United States. The facility has storage capacity of ~140,000 rock samples and more than 30,000 samples have been catalogued already. The sample collections are available for researchers, educators, and museums to use. An online database and educational materials are available to help educate the public about polar geology.

=== Greenland field studies ===

1980s photogrammetrist Henry Brecher conducted aerial photographic surveys of major Greenland glaciers.

1990s Dr. Ellen Mosley-Thompson obtained ice cores from multiple locations, including GITS. Dr. Ken Jezek conducted radar studies in Greenland&#x27;s accumulation and ablation zone. In 1995, Ken Jezek was at Swiss Camp.

2005 Jason Box assisted Konrad Steffen in automatic weather station maintenance at Swiss Camp and sites that comprise the Greenland Climate Network. Jason Box returned to Greenland to: 1.) obtain an ice core from a position in southeast Greenland where the Polar MM5 model simulates a maximum in snow accumulation, 2.) install time lapse cameras pointed at two outlet glaciers, and 3.) conduct supra-glacial melt lake measurements.

2007 In June, 2007, Jason Box established time lapse cameras beside 5 major west Greenland outlet glaciers. In July–September, Jason Box prepared for and occupied a camp near the Arctic Circle for 7 weeks during which time he conducted surface energy budget (melt) and supra-glacial melt lake measurements.

2008 During a 3-week field campaign, Jason Box, Ian Howat, Slawek Tulaczyk, and Yushin Ahn conducted measurements on Store Glacier, west Greenland. Ian Howat installed GPS sensors on Store Glacier in west Greenland.

2009 Jason Box installed time lapse cameras at Petermann Glacier in anticipation of a large area loss that eventually did occur August, 2010.

2010 April–May, 2010, Jason Box co-led a 750 km Arctic Circle Traverse across the southern Greenland ice sheet to obtain 3 ice cores and snow radar data to study spatial and temporal patterns of snowfall rates.

=== Antarctica ===

BPRC scientists have obtained ice cores from multiple locations on the Antarctic Ice Sheet.

The Transantarctic Mountains bisect the continental ice sheets, with different ice flow dynamics on either side. Radarsat (radar images collected by orbiting satellites) is being used to map the ice sheets. Ice sheet flow into the ocean is increasing and in western Antarctica, the ice stream is draining into the Ross Ice Shelf with marked acceleration.

In March 2000, the largest observed iceberg in history broke away from the Ross Ice Shelf.

=== Peru ===

The Qori Kalis Glacier in Peru, the main outlet of the Quelccaya Ice Cap, is in retreat. The terminus of the glacier has shown reduction since 1963, with dramatic increases since 1980.

=== Africa ===

Lonnie Thompson has led research expeditions to the glaciers atop Mount Kilimanjaro. At the present rate of Kilimanjaro glacier decline, it is predicted that the snow cover will be completely gone by 2020, and the glacier may no longer exist by 2023.

<doc id="1098726" wikidata="Q1147119" url="?curid=1098726" title="Cyberathlete Professional League">
<text>The Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL) was a professional sports tournament organization specializing in computer and console video game competitions. It was established by Angel Munoz on June 27, 1997, hosting biannual tournaments in hotels. The CPL&#x27;s World Tour in 2005 marked a global expansion of esports, but concerns arose about fan engagement and attracting new audiences. The post-tour era saw increased competition from the WSVG, and the CPL faced financial troubles including the loss of its main sponsor, Intel, to WSVG in 2006. Shortly after, WSVG&#x27;s Matt Ringel purchased the 2006 CPL Summer event, leading to a decline in the CPL&#x27;s influence. The CPL attempted a &quot;World Season&quot; in late 2006, hosting fewer events with reduced prize money. Rumors circulated about the league&#x27;s health, and in March 2008, the CPL ceased operations. Later that year, the CPL was acquired by an investment group in Abu Dhabi, later becoming solely owned by WoLong Ventures PTE of Singapore. The CPL continued hosting annual competitions in China in collaboration with the municipal government of Shenyang.

== History ==
=== Early years (1997–1999) ===

The Cyberathlete Professional League (CPL) was launched on June 27, 1997, by gamer and former Dallas stockbroker Angel Munoz. The CPL began hosting twice-yearly tournaments, Summer and Winter, in hotels such as the Gaylord Texan Resort on the outskirts of Dallas. The first event, called The FRAG, attracted 300 players competing for a prize pool of $4,000 in merchandise, as sponsors in computing found it easier to contribute spare graphics cards rather than cash.

The second major event, aptly named &quot;The CPL Event,&quot; was held in July 1998 at the Dallas Infomart, and the third event, named FRAG 2, occurred in October 1998 at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Dallas. The move to the Hyatt offered advantages such as increased space, a more suitable environment for LAN events, and the introduction of the CPL&#x27;s first 24-hour &quot;Bring Your Own Computer&quot; (BYOC) event. The Hyatt Regency in Dallas would become the chosen site for 13 CPL events spanning from 1998 to 2003. The Grand Ballroom of the Westin Park Central Hotel hosted the next CPL event, &quot;Extreme Annihilation,&quot; departing from the familiar Hyatt Regency. The event attracted sponsors such as Babbage&#x27;s, Cisco Systems, and Dell Computer Corporation. Babbage&#x27;s increased support, offering 600 free spectator passes and a $5,000 prize for the &quot;Quake II&quot; tournament.

The next CPL event was the &quot;Extreme Annihilation&quot; in March 1999. Following &quot;Extreme Annihilation&quot;, CPL collaborated with Interplay Entertainment for the 1999 &quot;Descent III&quot; Championship and Lanfest in Las Vegas. Despite offering the largest prize purse in professional gaming to date, $50,000, the event faced challenges, including slow registrations and venue concerns. Monte Fontenot, CPL Director of Events, emphasized that Las Vegas was not an ideal venue for gamers, and the game choice, &quot;Descent III&quot;, lacked broad appeal. The CPL then moved on to its sixth event, &quot;Ground Zero,&quot; in New York City, which was preceded by the first-ever esports qualifier in Springfield, Virginia. Ground Zero also was the introduction of the first official female gaming competition, the Female Frag Fest 99. Ground Zero marked CPL&#x27;s emergence into mainstream media, attracting both positive and negative attention from outlets such as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Wired Magazine&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;. Following Ground Zero, the CPL hosted its fourth event of 1999, FRAG 3, returning to Dallas. The Hyatt Regency hosted the event in its basement.

=== Expansion and emergence of &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; (2000–2004) ===
A total of seven CPL tournaments took place in 2000. In the early days of the CPL, death match free-for-all games, such as &quot;Quake&quot;, were the most popular titles. However, a Dallas pizzeria owner named Frank Nuccio eventually persuaded CPL event organizer Monte Fontenot to include &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; in CPL events. &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; first appearance in the CPL was at the $100,000 Razer CPL Event, which was originally scheduled for Los Angeles in March 2000 but was relocated to Marsalis Hall at the Hyatt Regency in Dallas.

CPL divisions were established in Europe and Asia, with negotiations underway for divisions in Australia, in 2000. While CPL Asia&#x27;s first and only event in Singapore attracted players from overseas, organizational challenges and scheduling conflicts led to the discontinuation of CPL Asia. Plans for future events were repeatedly postponed until the CPL severed ties with the organizer in 2003. The CPL Denmark event in October 2000 marked the debut of the CPL Europe division, combining the CPL France and CPL Scandinavia events. Eurogamer described the event as a &quot;disastrous false-start.&quot; Munoz attributed the problems to the Swedish organizers and plans were underway for CPL Europe under new management. After the setback in Denmark, the CPL found new European partners, leading to a second CPL Europe event in December 2000 in Cologne, Germany. Following first CPL Europe event, the CPL hosted the CPL Gateway Country Challenge, an event hosted simultaneously in 320 Gateway Country stores across the United States. The event, which began on November 4, 2000, and featured the video game &quot;Midtown Madness 2&quot;, had 10,000 competitors, $300,000 in prizes, and became the largest PC tournament in history.

The final event of 2000 was Babbage&#x27;s CPL at the Hyatt Regency in Dallas. The event faced challenges from the outset, as a winter storm in Texas caused travel delays for participants. Only 240 of the expected 512 &quot;Quake III&quot; competitors checked in, leading to a delayed start for the tournament. In contrast, the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; tournament was at full capacity with 40 teams. Additionally, Karna, the parent company of Razer and sponsor of the Babbage&#x27;s CPL &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; tournament, failed to fulfill its end, resulting in winners receiving only 2/3 of their prize winnings.

In 2001, Nuccio became the commissioner of the CPL, and March of that year, he integrated his online &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; league, Domain of Games, into CPL, forming the Cyberathlete Amateur League (CAL). Initially focused on &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;, CAL expanded to include &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; and &quot;Unreal Tournament&quot;. On March 14, the CPL announced a that it would be dropping &quot;Quake III Arena&quot; as the official tournament game in the World Championship Event in December, and named &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; as its replacement. Moreover, the Speakeasy CPL Event in April 2001 marked a departure from the CPL&#x27;s traditional focus on &quot;Quake III Arena&quot;, hosting only a &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; tournament. Additionally, a beta version of Half-Life TV (HLTV) was introduced at the event, creating a multicast spectator mode to allow an unlimited number of viewers to watch games.

Two international CPL events, the CPL Atomic Event in Melbourne, Australia, in April and the Virtua CPL Latin America Event, which was held shortly after the US Speakeasy Event, faced controversy, leading to no subsequent events hosted by those partners. The European division, however, did well, with CPL Europe hosting the Pentium 4 CPL Holland Event in May 2001. The United States&#x27; CPL 4-Year Anniversary Event, which was scheduled for June 28, 2001, celebrated CPL&#x27;s four-year milestone and feature a return to &quot;Quakeworld&quot; as the primary focus, alongside other tournaments, including &quot;Counter-Strike&quot;. Over 900 attendees turned out, surpassing expectations, with the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; tournament acting as a qualifier for the upcoming CPL World Championship Event. During the five-month break before the World Championship Event, CPL Europe hosted several events in August, including the ELSA CPL European Championships in London and the CPL Berlin Event. The CPL Berlin, held at the ICC Center, was CPL Europe&#x27;s first exclusively &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; event. The CPL World Championship Event in December 2001 was filmed by ESPN. In an attempt to legitimize esports as a professional sport, players were required to use their surnames in competition instead of gaming aliases. The main event of the World Championship was the &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; tournament, which was sponsored by Razer with $10,000 in prize money.

Nuccio parted ways with the CPL in 2004 due to philosophical differences on the optimal approach to advancing the industry, as Nuccio advocated for reinvesting profits into a national league structured around geography. Munoz, however, chose to maintain the CPL&#x27;s safe and profitable two-a-year tournament plan.

=== World Tours (2005–2008) ===

In 2005, the CPL held the 2005 CPL World Tour, a significant moment signaling the global expansion of esports. Centered around the new FPS game &quot;Painkiller&quot;, the tour featured ten stops across four continents, culminating in a grand final in Times Square, New York, with a million-dollar prize pot and MTV broadcasting. However, competition arose between broadcasting entities, and TSN secured the contract to broadcast the CPL World Tour, sidelining Radio iTG. Despite this setback, the tour showcased an rivalry between Fatal1ty and Dutch FPS player Sander &quot;Vo0&quot; Kaasjager, and ultimately, the tour was considered a success.

The 2005 CPL World Tour, despite its lucrative prize pool, raised concerns about fan engagement and attracting new audiences. Attendance at events varied, with notable success in China but disappointment in places like CPL Sheffield, where turnout was meager. The post-World Tour era saw the CPL&#x27;s challenges intensify, especially with the emergence of a new league, the World Series of Video Games (WSVG), operating on a similar business model—charging players for a spot at a Bring Your Own Computer LAN. Led by management consultant Matt Ringel, WSVG recruited a dozen former CPL staff to organize events, starting with a competition near Louisville, Kentucky, in February 2006.

In the months leading up to CPL Summer 2006, scheduled for July, the CPL lost its main sponsor, Intel, to the WSVG. With the need for sponsors to support the summer event, Munoz managed to secure less lucrative deals with microchip maker AMD and graphics-card company ATI. While these agreements were sufficient to salvage one tournament a year, it could only fund the smaller and less costly event, CPL Winter at the Hyatt. WSVG&#x27;s Ringel seized the opportunity and purchased the summer event from Munoz for just under a million dollars. This move proved to be a safe bet for the WSVG, given that the CPL already had three thousand gamers registered at $100 each, instantly recouping $300,000 of the million-dollar investment. Despite being labeled as a partnership between the CPL and WSVG, four days prior to the start of the event, Ringel removed all references to the CPL and renamed the event the Intel Summer Championship, aligning it with his principal sponsor. 

After its Summer event was absorbed by the WSVG, the CPL ran a subdued &quot;World Season&quot; in late 2006, featuring a few scattered stops across the globe, a significantly reduced prize pool of $150,000, and only two games: &quot;Counter-Strike&quot; and &quot;Quake 3&quot;.Subsequently, the CPL hosted only one tournament in Dallas, CPL Winter 2007, and a World Tour final in London in early 2008. During this period, rumors circulated about the league&#x27;s declining health. On the ESReality.com forums, gamers posted pictures of the Titanic, reflecting the sentiment surrounding the CPL&#x27;s decline. In March 2008, the CPL ceased operations, citing a &quot;crowded field of competing leagues.&quot;

=== Sale of the company (2008–2010) ===
On August 25, 2008, the CPL announced that it had signed an acquisition agreement with an investment group based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. On April 2, 2010, former CPL employee Tonya Welch shared concerns about the CPL&#x27;s new management. She argued that the claim of the CPL being bought by a middle-eastern investment group from Abu Dhabi was untrue and fabricated to deceive previous owners, potential investors, the gaming community, and the public. According to Welch, the actual purchase was orchestrated by a private group of US investors. On August 23, 2010, the former parent company of the CPL, announced that the two-year acquisition process of the CPL was finalized, and that the sole owner of the CPL (and its subsidiaries) was now WoLong Ventures PTE of Singapore. Following this acquisition, the CPL has hosted annual competitions in China, in collaboration with the municipal government of Shenyang. The new company also was renamed to Cyberathlete Pte Ltd.

==Past CPL World Champions==

==Cyberathlete Amateur League==

The CPL also owned and operated an online video game league for amateur players and teams, named the Cyberathlete Amateur League or CAL. CAL operated year-round, with regular eight-week seasons, one or two matches per week, and a single-elimination postseason (playoffs).

The CAL was based mainly on online game play. A 2003 competition hosted by CAL was played in a Hyatt Regency Ballroom. Several tables were placed together where 10 computers were set up for the professional gamers. The game was Half-Life: Counterstrike. The CAL ceased operating in 2009. By 2004, CAL had over 200,000 players competing in its league.

On November 14, 2008, the newly formed CPL Holding Group, LLC from United Arab Emirates announced that it had acquired CAL. On February 22, 2009, CAL ceased online operations. At its peak CAL was one of the largest online gaming leagues in North America with 20,000 teams and over 600,000 registered players.

<doc id="1098728" wikidata="Q895151" url="?curid=1098728" title="Boundary Park">
<text>Boundary Park is a football stadium in Oldham, Greater Manchester, England. Its name originates from the fact that it lies at the northwestern extremity of Oldham, with Royton and Chadderton lying immediately north and west respectively.

Boundary Park was originally known as the Athletic Ground when it was opened in 1896 for Oldham&#x27;s first professional football club, Oldham County F.C.. When County folded in 1899, Pine Villa F.C. took over the ground and changed their name to Oldham Athletic. Oldham Athletic A.F.C. have played their home games here since the stadium was opened. Oldham RLFC also play their home matches at the ground after leaving their traditional home, Watersheddings, in 1997 and moved to Boundary Park, although they moved following disagreements between the boards away from the ground between 2009 and 2023.

==Overview==
The Lookers Stand on the Broadway side was knocked down as part of a proposed redevelopment (see below). Oldham Borough Council confirmed planning approval for the new North Stand in April 2013. This will have capacity for 2,671 spectators, plus a health and fitness suite, supporters&#x27; bar and event facilities. The hardcore Oldham fans used to be situated in the Chadderton Road End (Chaddy End); a traditional, small, one-tiered stand. However, the &#x27;Athleticos&#x27; now occupy the larger Rochdale Road End, and the away fans are allocated the Chaddy End. The main stand has existed since the time when the stadium was originally built, and is a small two-tiered structure. Terracing disused since the conversion to an all-seater can still be seen towards the end of this stand.

==Capacity==
The stadium currently has an all-seated capacity of 13,186. It became an all-seater venue during the 1994–95 season – the season after Oldham Athletic&#x27;s relegation from the top flight of English football. In the early days, the stadium could hold nearly 50,000 people. The highest crowd ever recorded at Boundary Park is 47,671, for an FA Cup tie between Oldham and Sheffield Wednesday in 1930. The highest attendance for a league match was also recorded during the same season against Blackpool, with 45,304 attending for the promotion clash.

==Ownership==

Historically, Boundary Park was owned by the football club which has occupied it since 1904, Oldham Athletic. This arrangement changed in 1999 when the then owners of the football club sold the stadium to Oldham Property Partnerships, Oldham Council’s joint venture company.

The football club entered administration in 2003 and a takeover by Simon Blitz, Simon Corney and Danny Gazel was completed in early 2005. Blitz and Gazel purchased the football club through their company Oldham Athletic (2004) Association Football Club Limited and subsequently completed the purchase of Boundary Park through a separate company, Brass Bank Limited, with that purchase completing in June 2005.

The ownership of the football club and its stadium was again split in 2011 when Blitz and Gazel sold their shares in Oldham Athletic to Corney, whilst retaining ownership of Boundary Park through Brass Bank Limited.

Corney’s sale of Oldham Athletic to Moroccan football agent Abdallah Lemsagam in 2018 led to a period of dispute between Lemsagam and Blitz over the use of Boundary Park by the football club.

Finally, Lemsagam sold the football club to local businessman Frank Rothwell in July 2022, at which time Rothwell announced that he was also in advanced discussions to purchase Boundary Park from Blitz, a transaction which completed on 24 March 2023, bringing the football club and its stadium back under single ownership for the first time in over ten years.

==&quot;Fantastic in Plastic&quot;==
In 1986 the club installed an artificial pitch in order to generate more income for the club and this coincided with the club&#x27;s upturn in fortunes under manager Joe Royle. In 1987, the club reached the play-offs and in 1989–90 the club went through what is regarded as one of the club&#x27;s greatest ever seasons, reaching the League Cup Final and the semi-final of the FA Cup, and the club claimed major upsets in defeating the likes of Arsenal, Southampton, Everton and Aston Villa. Critics felt that the pitch gave the club an advantage, but in 1991 Royle responded to this. When Portsmouth manager Frank Burrows declared that Oldham could not play away from home, Royle stuck the article to the dressing room door and the team responded with a 4–1 victory. 

At the end of the 1990–91 season the club secured promotion to the top flight, the final match on the plastic pitch was probably one of the most memorable games played at the ground when Latics, in order to win the old Second Division, had to beat Sheffield Wednesday and rely on West Ham losing. After 60 minutes of the game, Sheffield Wednesday were 2–0 up, but Ian Marshall pulled a goal back, then Paul Bernard equalised with less than ten minutes to play. By this point, West Ham were losing. In time added on, Andy Barlow went down in the box and the referee awarded a penalty. Neil Redfearn stepped up to convert it and a mass pitch invasion followed, as it had been confirmed that West Ham had lost 2–1 at home to Notts County. In gaining promotion to the top flight, Oldham Athletic were forced to have the plastic pitch removed because of league rules. They stayed in the top division for three seasons (1991–92, 1992–93 and 1993–94) before being relegated, and after three disappointing seasons in the second tier were relegated again in 1997. They remained in the third division, which was later called League One, until they were relegated at the end of the 2017–18 season.

==Records==
Boundary Park is anecdotally known as being the coldest ground in the Football League, earning the nickname coined by Joe Royle, &quot;Ice Station Zebra&quot;. It is also the second-highest stadium, at 526 feet (155m) above sea level, of any Premier League or Football League club after the Hawthorns, home of West Bromwich Albion, 552 feet (168m).

== Redevelopment ==

There were plans in the late 1990s for a move to a new 20,000 seater stadium (named Sports Park 2000) on adjoining waste ground, but these plans were scrapped.

On 15 February 2006, the club unveiled plans for the redevelopment of their current ground. The plans would see every stand other than the Rochdale Road End being redeveloped. When completed it would initially be a 16,000 seater stadium, estimated to cost £80 million, and with a working name of the &quot;Oldham Arena&quot;.

On 14 November 2007, Oldham Athletic received planning permission for the Broadway Stand, whilst Oldham Borough Council rejected the further development of the stadium due to local objections regarding the height and size of a proposed block of flats. On 12 December 2007, after amending the plans, another council meeting gave permission for redevelopment. Facilities would include conferencing and a hotel plus the option of a casino.

Demolition of the Broadway Stand started on 8 May 2008, with the work completed before the start of the new season. The building of the new stand was due to commence in December 2008 and was expected to take 16 months.

On 5 September 2008, Simon Blitz told podcast &quot;World Soccer Daily&quot; that although Oldham still planned to continue the development of Boundary Park and surrounding areas, the plans were on hold for now because of the financial crisis of 2007–2010 and the subsequent downturn in the UK property market.

Because of these problems, the club announced in the summer of 2009 that it was considering moving to a new stadium in Failsworth. This caused some controversy amongst supporters as despite Failsworth being officially part of the borough, it has a Manchester postcode. It is also only three miles from the City of Manchester Stadium and only one mile from the proposed new stadium of F.C. United of Manchester in Moston, Manchester. If all went to according to plan, the new stadium was anticipated to be ready for the beginning of the 2011–12 season - however, these plans were also shelved due to the Charities Commission turning down the application.

On 28 July 2011 the council offered the club £5.7 million to help with their redevelopment fund of Boundary Park, which would involve the redevelopment of the Broadway Stand.

Oldham Council confirmed planning approval for the new North Stand in April 2013, including a 2,671 capacity stand, a health and fitness suite, supporters&#x27; bar and event facilities. Demolition and preparatory work started in the summer of 2013.

Construction of the new North Stand completed on 17 October 2015 for the home match against Sheffield United. The new North Stand is significantly taller than the stand that it replaced although the capacity for supporters is roughly the same. The additional height has allowed for a supporters bar, offices, corporate hospitality, retail opportunities and a gymnasium.

Following the club&#x27;s relegation to non-league football with the match against Salford City abandoned, Oldham Athletic decided that the now renamed ‘Joe Royle Stand’ would be closed for the 2022-23 season, on cost and safety grounds.

In March 2023, it was announced that Oldham Council would invest £1 million in a new pitch at Boundary Park making the surface suitable for increased usage including the return of Oldham R.L.F.C. to the stadium from the 2024 season.

<text>Guria () is a region (&quot;mkhare&quot;) in Georgia, in the western part of the country, bordered by the eastern end of the Black Sea. The region has a population of 104,338 (2023), with Ozurgeti as the regional capital.

==Geography==

Guria is bordered by Samegrelo to the north-west, Imereti to the north, Samtskhe-Javakheti to the east, Ajaria to the south, and the Black Sea to the west. The province has an area of .

Guria is traversed by the northeasterly line of equal latitude and longitude.

==Administrative divisions==
Guria is divided into 4 entities (3 municipalities and 1 city), including:

* City of Ozurgeti
* Ozurgeti Municipality
* Lanchkhuti Municipality
* Chokhatauri Municipality

==History==

The territory that is now Guria was part of the kingdom of Colchis, best known in the West for the tale of the Golden Fleece. Following the collapse of the Colchian Kingdom it became part of the Kingdom of Lazica in the first century BC. In antiquity the area was a significant source of iron, as early as the fifth century BC, and also copper and gold.

The toponym &quot;Guria&quot; is first attested in the c. 800 Georgian chronicle of Pseudo-Juansher.

Guria first appears c. 1352 as a fief of the house of Vardanidze-Dadiani; and after 1463 it became a sovereign principality independent of the Kingdom of Georgia under a branch of that house, known thereafter by the name of Gurieli. The principality, comprising modern Guria and much of Adjara with the city of Batumi, was subsequently reduced in size and devastated in a series of conflicts with the Ottoman Empire. A Russian protectorate was established by the treaty concluded on June 19, 1810 between Mamia V Gurieli and the empire, and in 1829, during the regency for the last prince, the Gurieli David, the principality was annexed by Russia.

There were uprisings against Russian rule in 1819 and again in 1841. In 1840, Guria was made a county (&quot;uyezd&quot;) and renamed Ozurgeti, after one of its main towns. In 1846, it was transferred to the new Kutais Governorate. By 1904, the population was just under 100,000, occupying an area of approximately of mountains and swampy valleys, covered by corn fields, vineyards, and some tea plantations. It was the most ethnically homogenous of Georgian areas, with the peasantry and lesser rural nobility making up almost the entire population, with a high level of literacy and a relatively high degree of economic self-satisfaction. The peasant protest movement, which originated in 1902 and culminated in an open insurrection against the government during the Russian Revolution of 1905, was the most effective and organized peasant movement in the empire. The peasants’ self-government, the so-called Gurian Republic, survived into 1906, when it was crushed and Guria devastated by the Cossack punitive expedition. The region was a native powerbase of the Georgian Social Democratic (Menshevik) Party which dominated the Democratic Republic of Georgia from 1918 to 1921. Guria was a scene of guerrilla resistance to the militarily imposed Soviet rule early in the 1920s. Under the Soviet government, Guria was an agrarian area divided into three administrative districts. In 1995, the Georgian government decreed the creation of the region (&quot;mkhare&quot;) of Guria, restoring the province&#x27;s historical name to official usage.

The Orthodox churches of Likhauri and Shemokmedi are the main historical buildings in the province.

==Etymology==

 The linguistic evidence for the above hypothesis is the Megrelian word for “heart” – “guri” (Georgian: “guli”).

==Economy==
Subtropic farming and tourism are a mainstay of the region&#x27;s economy. Water is one of Guria&#x27;s main assets. The province is famous for the mineral water of Nabeglavi, which is similar to Borjomi in its chemical composition, and the Black Sea health resort of Ureki, which is rich in magnetic sand. Guria is also one of the largest tea growing regions in Georgia.

==Demographics==
===Ethnic and religious groups===
According to the 2014 census, Guria has a population of 113.350 inhabitants, which accounts for 3.1% of the total population of Georgia. 98% of the population is ethnic Georgian (mostly native &quot;Gurians&quot;), 1% is ethnic Armenian and the remaining 1% is composed of Russians and Ukrainians and the majority of the population is Orthodox Christians (87%), followed by Islam (11%).

===Gurians===

<text>USS &quot;Richmond&quot; (CL-9) was an light cruiser, originally classified as a scout cruiser, of the United States Navy. She was the third Navy ship named for the city of Richmond, Virginia.

==Built in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania==
&quot;Richmond&quot; was originally authorized on 29 August 1916, and awarded to William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia on 30 July 1917. She was laid down on 16 February 1920, and launched on 29 September 1921, sponsored by Miss Elizabeth S. Scott. &quot;Richmond&quot; was commissioned on 2 July 1923, with Captain David F. Boyd in command.

===Characteristics===
&quot;Richmond&quot; was long at the waterline with an overall length of , her beam was and a mean draft of . Her standard displacement was and at full load. Her crew, during peace time, consisted of 29 officers and 429 enlisted men.

===Power plant===
&quot;Richmond&quot; was powered by four Parsons steam turbines geared steam turbines, each driving one screw, using steam generated by 12 White-Forster boilers. The engines were designed to produce and reach a top speed of . She was designed to provide a range of at a speed of , but was only capable of at a speed of 

===Original armament===
&quot;Richmond&quot;″s main armament went through many changes while she was being designed. Originally she was to mount ten /53 caliber guns; two on either side at the waist, with the remaining eight mounted in tiered casemates on either side of the fore and aft superstructures. After America&#x27;s entry into World War I the US Navy worked alongside the Royal Navy and it was decided to mount four 6-in/53 caliber guns in two twin gun turrets fore and aft and keep the eight guns in the tiered casemates so that she would have an eight gun broadside and, due to limited arcs of fire from the casemate guns, four to six guns firing fore or aft. Her secondary armament consisted of two /50 caliber anti-aircraft guns in single mounts. &quot;Richmond&quot; was initially built with the capacity to carry 224 mines, but these were removed early in her career to make way for more crew accommodations. She also carried two triple and two twin, above-water, torpedo tube mounts for torpedoes. The triple mounts were fitted on either side of the upper deck, aft of the aircraft catapults, and the twin mounts were one deck lower on either side, covered by hatches in the side of the hull.

The ship lacked a full-length waterline armor belt. The sides of her boiler and engine rooms and steering gear were protected by of armor. The transverse bulkheads at the end of her machinery rooms were thick forward and three inches thick aft. The deck over the machinery spaces and steering gear had a thickness of 1.5 inches. The gun turrets were not armored and only provided protection against muzzle blast and the conning tower had 1.5 inches of armor. &quot;Richmond&quot; carried two floatplanes aboard that were stored on the two catapults. Initially these were probably Vought VE-9s until the early 1930s when the ship may have operated OJ-2 until 1935 and Curtiss SOC Seagulls until 1940 when Vought OS2U Kingfishers were used on ships without hangars.

===Armament changes===
During her career &quot;Richmond&quot; went through several armament changes, some of these changes were save weight, but others were to increase her AA armament. The lower torpedo tube mounts proved to be very wet and were removed, and the openings plated over, before the start of World War II. Another change made before the war was to increase the 3-inch guns to eight, all mounted in the ship&#x27;s waist. After 1940, the lower aft 6-inch guns were removed and the casemates plated over for the same reason as the lower torpedo mounts. The ship&#x27;s anti-aircraft armament were augmented by three twin Bofors guns along with 12 Oerlikon cannons by the end of the war.

==Inter-war period==
On completion of a three-month shakedown cruise to Europe, Africa, and South America, &quot;Richmond&quot; underwent post-shakedown availability and in December departed Norfolk for New Orleans. There, at the end of 1923, she became flagship of the Scouting Force.

In early January 1924, she got underway to participate in Fleet Problem III which tested Caribbean defenses and transit facilities of the Panama Canal. On the 19th, she arrived off Veracruz, rescued survivors of , wrecked on Blanquilla Reef; then proceeded to Tampico to stand by as political tension rose. On the 26th, she headed for Galveston, only to return to Mexico on 3 February to evacuate refugees from Puerto Mexico and transport them to Veracruz. On the 17th, she headed east and joined in exercises off Puerto Rico.

In May, &quot;Richmond&quot; returned briefly to New Orleans, then steamed for the northeast coast and further exercises. Toward the end of July she departed Newport, R.I., for duty as a station ship along the route of USAAS&#x27;s first aerial circumnavigation of the world. On 2 August, she attempted to take in tow the Douglas World Cruiser &quot;Boston&quot;, downed on the Atlantic Ocean after engine trouble, but the floatplane capsized in rough seas, although the two crew were rescued. Then, from September through December, she underwent overhaul at the New York Navy Yard.

In January 1925, &quot;Richmond&quot;, flagship of Light Cruiser Divisions, Scouting Fleet, again participated in Caribbean exercises. In February, she transited the Panama Canal and during March trained off the California coast. In April, she steamed to Hawaii for joint Army-Navy maneuvers, after which she joined the Battle Fleet for a good will cruise to Australia and New Zealand.

Returning to Norfolk on 23 November, &quot;Richmond&quot; operated off the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean through 1926. On 1 February 1927, she again transited the Panama Canal; conducted exercises in Hawaiian waters; then continued on to China, arriving at Shanghai on 3 April. She remained on the China Station for a year, with only infrequent diversions to the Philippines for repairs and exercises. On 14 April 1928, she sailed eastward and less than three months later departed San Pedro, California, for Corinto, Nicaragua with a Navy Battalion embarked. On 25 July, she retransited the Panama Canal and for the next six years operated off the New England and mid-Atlantic coasts and in the Caribbean with occasional interruptions for fleet problems and exercises in the eastern Pacific.

From September 1934 to December 1937, &quot;Richmond&quot; operated off the west coast as a unit of the Scouting Fleet. On 12 February 1935, she rescued 64 members of the crew of the downed airship USS &quot;Macon&quot;. After 21 December 1937, she served as flagship of the Submarine Force, and on 10 May 1938, she headed back to the east coast. On 26 August, she returned to San Diego and resumed her previous duty with the Submarine Force. In the winter of 1939 and the fall of 1940, she returned to the Atlantic for fleet and submarine exercises, and, at the end of December 1940, hauled down the flag of the Submarine Force.

With the new year, 1941, &quot;Richmond&quot; shifted to Pearl Harbor; and, from January to June, served as flagship, Scouting Force. Into October, she remained in Hawaiian waters, operating with Cruiser Division 3 (CruDiv 3), then she returned to California and in November began Neutrality Patrols off the west coasts of the Americas. On 7 December, she was &quot;en route&quot; to Valparaíso, Chile.

==World War II==
Recalled from her original mission, she took up patrol off Panama and in 1942 commenced escorting reinforcement convoys to the Galápagos Islands and Society Islands. Later, returning to patrols from Panama to Chile, she put into San Francisco for overhaul in December and in January 1943 sailed for the Aleutians.

&quot;Richmond&quot; arrived at Unalaska on 28 January 1943. On 3 February, she became flagship of Task Group 16.6 (TG 16.6), a cruiser-destroyer task group assigned to defend the approaches to recently occupied Amchitka. On the 10th, she underwent her first enemy air raid and on the 18th she participated in the initial bombardment of Holtz Bay and Chichagof Harbor, Attu Island.

The force then resumed patrols to enforce the blockade of enemy installations on Attu and Kiska. In March, the Japanese decided to run the blockade and on the 22nd dispatched a force of two heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, four destroyers, and three transports from Paramushiro. TG 16.6, one light cruiser, one heavy cruiser, and four destroyers, intercepted the Japanese on the 26th approximately 180 mi (290 km) west of Attu and 100 mi (160 km) south of the Komandorski Islands.

The Japanese sent the transports and one destroyer on, then turned to meet &quot;Richmond&quot;″s force. At 0840, the Battle of the Komandorski Islands began.

Initially firing on &quot;Richmond&quot;, the Japanese soon concentrated on , the only American ship with the firing range to reach them. In the running, retiring action which ensued and lasted until shortly after noon, &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; went dead in the water, but continued firing. &quot;Richmond&quot; went to her aid as the American destroyers closed the Japanese for a torpedo attack. The enemy, however, low on fuel and ammunition did not press their advantage. Changing course, they headed west, pursued by the American destroyers. &quot;Salt Lake City&quot; regained power after four minutes and &quot;Richmond&quot; joined the destroyers, but the action was broken off as the Japanese outdistanced TG 16.6.

The transports sent ahead by the Japanese turned back for the Kuriles before reaching Attu. TG 16.6 had succeeded in its mission. In May, a week-long struggle resulted in the reoccupation of Attu by American forces.

In August, Kiska became the target, and &quot;Richmond&quot; joined in the preinvasion bombardment. The landings took place on the 15th and met no resistance. The Japanese had pulled out undetected, before the end of July.

On 24 August, &quot;Richmond&quot; departed the Aleutians; underwent overhaul at Mare Island; then returned to Kiska. Through the remainder of the year, she conducted patrols to the west of the outer Aleutians. On 4 February 1944, she began bombardment missions in the Kuriles which continued, alternated with antishipping sweeps, for the remainder of World War II.

With the end of hostilities, &quot;Richmond&quot; covered the occupation of northern Japan. On 14 September 1945, she departed Ominato for Pearl Harbor, where she was routed on to Philadelphia for inactivation. Decommissioned on 21 December, &quot;Richmond&quot; was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 21 January 1946, and was sold on 18 December to the Patapsco Scrap Co., Bethlehem, Pa.

<text>Saint Patrick&#x27;s Church is the Catholic parish for Benton, Wisconsin and surrounding areas. The parish is part of the Diocese of Madison.

The church was built in 1852 by the pioneer priest Samuel Charles Mazzuchelli, a Dominican. Mazzuchelli was the church&#x27;s architect, as well as its founder. Mazzuchelli — who was declared Venerable by Pope John Paul II in 1993 — is buried in the church cemetery. The church was one of 25 he built in the Upper Mississippi valley.

<doc id="1098745" wikidata="Q739993" url="?curid=1098745" title="Nairobi National Park">
<text>Nairobi National Park is a national park in Kenya that was established in 1946 about south of Nairobi. It is fenced on three sides, whereas the open southern boundary allows migrating wildlife to move between the park and the adjacent Kitengela plains. Herbivores gather in the park during the dry season. Nairobi National Park is negatively affected by increasing human and livestock populations, changing land use and poaching of wildlife.
Despite its proximity to the city and its relative small size, it boasts a large and varied wildlife population, and is one of Kenya&#x27;s most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries.

== History ==

British colonists arrived in the area where the park is in the late 19th century. At this time, the Athi plains east and south of what is today Nairobi had plentiful wildlife. Nomadic Maasai lived and herded their cattle among the wildlife. Kikuyu people farmed the forested highlands above Nairobi. As Nairobi grew—it had 14,000 residents by 1910—conflicts between humans and animals increased. Residents of the city carried guns at night to protect against lions. Animals were gradually confined to the expansive plains to the west and south of Nairobi, and the colonial government set this area aside as a game reserve. Settlers from Nairobi including Isak Dinesen, author of &quot;Out of Africa&quot;, rode horses among gazelles, impala, and zebras in this reserve.

The conservationist Mervyn Cowie was born in Nairobi. Returning to Kenya after a nine-year absence in 1932, he was alarmed to see that the amount of game animals on the Athi plains had dwindled. Expanding farms and livestock had taken the place of the game. He later recalled this place as a paradise that was quickly disappearing. At this time, the area that would later become Nairobi National Park was part of the Southern Game Reserve. Hunting was not permitted in the reserve, but nearly every other activity, including cattle grazing, dumping, and even bombing by the Royal Air Force was allowed. Cowie started to campaign for the establishment of a national park system in Kenya. The government formed a committee to examine the matter.

Officially opened in 1946, Nairobi National Park was the first national park established in Kenya. Maasai pastoralists were removed from their lands when the park was created. Cowie was named as director of Nairobi National Park and held this position until 1966. In 1989, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi burned twelve tons of ivory on a site within the park. This event improved Kenya&#x27;s conservation and wildlife protection image.

On 5 March 2024, a Cessna 172 belonging to a flying school crashed into the park after figuring in a mid-air collision with a Dash 8 passenger aircraft operated by Safarilink Aviation, killing all two people aboard the Cessna.

== Geography ==
The park covers an area of and is small in comparison to most of Africa&#x27;s national parks. The park&#x27;s altitude ranges between . It has a dry climate. The park is the only protected part of the Athi-Kapiti ecosystem, making up less than 10% of this ecosystem. The park has a diverse range of habitats and species.

The park is located about from the Nairobi&#x27;s centre. There is electric fencing around the park&#x27;s northern, eastern, and western boundaries. Its southern boundary is formed by the Mbagathi River. This boundary is not fenced and is open to the Kitengela Conservation Area (located immediately south of the park) and the Athi-Kapiti plains. There is considerable movement of large ungulate species across this boundary.

== Flora ==

The park&#x27;s predominant environment is open grass plain with scattered &quot;Acacia&quot; bushes. The western uplands of the park have highland dry forest with stands of &quot;Olea africana&quot;, &quot;Croton dichogamus&quot;, &quot;Brachylaena hutchinsii&quot;, and &quot;Calodendrum&quot;. The lower slopes of these areas are grassland. &quot;Themeda&quot;, cypress, &quot;Digitaria&quot;, and &quot;Cynodon&quot; species are found in these grassland areas. There are also scattered yellow-barked &quot;Acacia xanthophloea&quot;. There is a riverine forest along the permanent river in the south of the park. There are areas of broken bush and deep rocky valleys and gorges within the park. The species in the valleys are predominantly &quot;Acacia&quot; and &quot;Euphorbia candelabrum&quot;. Other tree species include &quot;Apodytes dimidiata&quot;, &quot;Canthium schimperiana&quot;, &quot;Elaeodendron buchananii&quot;, &quot;Ficus eriocarpa&quot;, &quot;Aspilia mossambicensis&quot;, &quot;Rhus natalensis&quot;, and &quot;Newtonia&quot; species. Several plants that grow on the rocky hillsides are unique to the Nairobi area. These species include &quot;Euphorbia brevitorta&quot;, &quot;Drimia calcarata&quot;, and &quot;Murdannia clarkeana&quot;.

== Fauna ==

The park has a large and diverse wildlife population. Species found in the park include lion, leopard, African buffalo, black rhinoceros, giraffe, hippopotamus, spotted hyena, blue wildebeest, plains zebra, cheetah, Thomson&#x27;s gazelle, Grant&#x27;s gazelle, common eland, impala, hartebeest, waterbuck, common warthog, olive baboon, black-backed jackal, common ostrich, and Nile crocodile.

Herbivores, including wildebeest and zebra, use the Kitengela conservation area and migration corridor to the south of the park to reach the Athi-Kapiti plains. They disperse over the plains in the wet season and return to the park in the dry season. The concentration of wildlife in the park is greatest in the dry season, when areas outside the park have dried up. Small dams built along the Mbagathi River give the park more water resources than these outside areas. They attract water dependent herbivores during the dry season. The park is the northern limit for wildlife migrations in the dry season. The park has a high diversity of bird species, with up to 500 permanent and migratory species in the park. Dams have created a man-made habitat for birds and aquatic species.
The David Sheldrick Trust runs a sanctuary in the park that hand-rears orphaned elephant and rhinoceros calves, and later releases them back into secure sanctuaries. Orphaned and sick animals are brought to the sanctuary from all over Kenya. The sanctuary is located close to the park&#x27;s main entrance. It was opened in 1963. It was set up by Daphne Sheldrick after the death of her husband David Sheldrick, the anti-poaching warden of Tsavo National Park. Nairobi National Park is sometimes called &quot;Kifaru Ark&quot;, which means &quot;Rhinoceros Sanctuary&quot;. It is one of Kenya&#x27;s most successful rhinoceros sanctuaries, and it is one of only a few parks where visitors can be certain of seeing a black rhinoceros in its natural habitat.

== Conservation ==

Mervyn Cowie oversaw the development of several of Kenya&#x27;s national parks and designed them with human visitors in mind. This emphasis helped to make tourism Kenya&#x27;s primary industry. However, it exacerbated problems between the human population and wildlife. Farmers living next to the parks did not have input into the establishment of the parks. Locals received very little benefit from the game animals. Livestock is threatened by lions, and some landowners think that Kenya&#x27;s wildlife is not good for them. In 1948, 188,976 people lived in Nairobi, and by 1997 the city&#x27;s population had grown to 1.5 million. The park is under pressure from the city&#x27;s growing population and need for farmland. People live right next to the park&#x27;s boundaries, which creates human-animal conflicts. The human population also creates pollution and garbage. Effluent and industrial waste from factories located along the park&#x27;s northern boundary contaminate the park&#x27;s surface and ground water systems.

Treaties with the Maasai in 1904 and 1911 forced them to give up all of their northern grazing lands on the Laikipia escarpment near Mount Kenya. Some of the people that lost land there were resettled in the Kitengela area. The Maasai&#x27;s pastoral life did not create any conflicts with the wildlife. Today the Kitengela&#x27;s former Maasai group-ranches have been privatized and some of the land has been sold to farmers. Houses, cultivated plots, schools, shops, and bars are found on the Kitengela plains. Some of the park&#x27;s revenues have been used for community projects in order for the people living on the Kitengela to benefit from the presence of the national park. Many Maasai landowners have formed the Kitengela Landowners Association, which works with the Kenyan Wildlife Service to both protect the wildlife and find benefits for the locals.

The park and the Athi-Kapiti Plains are linked by the migrations of wild herbivore populations. The plains to the south of the park are important feeding areas during the wet season. Before the city was established, herds of animals followed the rains and moved across the plains from Mount Kilimanjaro to Mount Kenya, a migration as great as the migration that takes place on the Serengeti. However, as the city grew the park became the northernmost limit of the animal&#x27;s migration. Migrating animals can reach their southern pastures by travelling through the part of the Athi plains called the Kitengela. This land is very important to their migration routes, but growth in the human population and the accompanying need for land threaten to cut off this traditional migration route from the park to land further south. The park&#x27;s migratory species are also threatened by changing settlement patterns, fencing, and their closeness to Nairobi and other industrial towns. These activities fragment their ecosystems and occupy their habitat.

Since 2005, the protected area is considered a Lion Conservation Unit.

== Tourism and education ==
Nairobi National Park is the main tourist attraction for visitors to Nairobi. Visitor attractions include the park&#x27;s diverse bird species, cheetah, hyena, leopard, and lion. Other attractions are the wildebeest and zebra migrations in July and August, the Ivory Burning Site Monument, and the Nairobi Safari Walk and animal orphanage. Inhabitants of Nairobi visit the park and thousands of Kenyan children on school field trips visit the park each week.

The park&#x27;s Wildlife Conservation Education Centre has lectures and video shows about wildlife and guided tours of the park and animal orphanage. These tours are primarily, but not exclusively, to educate schools and local communities. There has been criticism about animals&#x27; housing, and they now have more spacious housing in a more natural environment. The Kenya Wildlife Service has created a Safari Walk that highlights the variety of plants and animals that are in Kenya, and how they affect Kenya&#x27;s population.

<text>Wilbur Rounding Franks, OBE (4 March 1901 – 4 January 1986) was a Canadian scientist, notable as the inventor of the anti-gravity suit or G-suit, and for his work in cancer research.

==Career==
He was born in Weston, Ontario and was a medical graduate at the University of Toronto. As a cancer researcher at the Banting and Best Medical Research Institute at University of Toronto, Franks developed an idea that resulted in the world&#x27;s first &quot;anti-gravity suit&quot; or G-suit. Franks had noted that his test tubes often broke when subjected to severe centrifugal force. He had solved the problem by first inserting them into larger and stronger liquid-filled bottles.

In 1940, the anti gravity suit was developed under the name &quot;Franks Flying Suit&quot; by Wilbur R. Franks and his colleagues at the Banting and Best Medical Research Institute at the University of Toronto. The suit was made with rubber and water-filled pads. It counteracted the effects of high G forces on aircraft pilots, which otherwise would cause them to black out. These suits were used during World War II and all G-Suits worn by air force pilots as well as astronauts and cosmonauts around the world are based on his original designs. When testing his first prototype, Franks stated:

&quot;The suit had been cut to fit me perfectly, standing up. . . . In the airplane I was sitting down, and when the pressure hit I thought it was going to cut me in two. The idea became practical only when we realized that great areas of the body could be left outside the fluid system.&quot;
In 1941 fellow Canadian scientist, Dr. Sir Frederick Banting, co-discoverer of insulin, died in a plane crash near Musgrave Harbour, Canada while on his way to England to assist Franks in the testing of the suit.

==Recognition and awards==
Wilbur Franks received an OBE for his work in early 1944 for giving &quot;the Allied forces a tremendous tactical advantage&quot; and &quot;saving the lives of thousands of Allied fighter pilots.&quot; With this invention, over five times more pilots survived than they would&#x27;ve without the G-suit. In 1983, Franks was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Aviation Hall of Fame. Franks work was also noticed in the United States where he was awarded the Legion of Merit, the Aerospace Medical Association&#x27;s Theodore C. Lyster Award and Eric Liljencrantz Award.

==Legacy==
There is a Wilbur R. Franks Award that is given by the Canadian Society of Aviation Medicine for contributions to aviation medicine. The Wilbur Rounding Franks building located at 17 Wing Winnipeg is the home of the Canadian Forces School of Survival and Aeromedical Training (CFSSAT).

<text>Gillian Spencer (born December 18, 1939) is an American soap opera actress and writer.

She had supporting roles on the soaps &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; as Lynn Wilkins Warren from 1961-1962 and &quot;The Edge of Night&quot; as Leora Davies in 1963 before joining &quot;Guiding Light&quot; in 1965 in the role of the troubled heroine Robin Fletcher. Gillian was part of the original cast of &quot;One Life to Live&quot; as the original Victoria Lord from 1968 until 1970, and it was during her stint that Viki&#x27;s split personality was introduced. While Erika Slezak would become famous for this part, Gillian and Lee Patterson (Joe Riley) were fan favorites and the show&#x27;s first major romantic couple. 

From 1972-1975, she played &quot;As the World Turns&quot;&#x27;s Jennifer Hughes, Kim Stewart&#x27;s sister, Bob&#x27;s third wife and Frannie&#x27;s mother who died after being hit by a motorist. However, she is probably best remembered for playing the role of Daisy Cortlandt on the ABC soap, &quot;All My Children&quot;, a role she played from 1980 through 1989, and in 1991, 1994, 1995, 1996, and on April 20, 2010 with Taylor Miller (Nina Cortlandt) for the tribute episode for James Mitchell (Palmer Cortlandt). Daisy (Palmer&#x27;s first wife) was originally presumed dead and used the alias &quot;Monique Jonvil&quot; to befriend Nina in college. 

Over the years, Nina often referred to her mother as &quot;Monique&quot;. For her role of Daisy, Spencer received an Emmy Nomination for Best Actress. In 1997, Gillian made a guest return to &quot;As the World Turns&quot; where the spirit of Jennifer appeared to her ailing sister.

Spencer appeared in the 1968 feature comedy &quot;What&#x27;s So Bad About Feeling Good?&quot;; in the film, she plays The Sack, a melancholy young woman living in a New York City commune with a burlap sack covering her entire body except for her bare feet.

She was co-head writer of &quot;Another World&quot;. She has also been a writer for &quot;As the World Turns&quot;, &quot;All My Children&quot; and the serial &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;.

<doc id="1098754" wikidata="Q926274" url="?curid=1098754" title="Pluralistic ignorance">
<text>In social psychology, pluralistic ignorance (also known as a collective illusion) is a phenomenon in which people mistakenly believe that others predominantly hold an opinion different from their own. In this phenomenon, most people in a group may go along with a view they do not hold because they think, incorrectly, that most other people in the group hold it. Pluralistic ignorance encompasses situations in which a minority position on a given topic is wrongly perceived to be the majority position, or the majority position is wrongly perceived to be a minority position.

Pluralistic ignorance can arise in different ways. An individual may misjudge overall perceptions of a topic due to fear, embarrassment, social desirability, or social inhibition. Individuals may develop collective illusions when they feel they will receive backlash when they think their belief differs from society&#x27;s belief. From a group-level perspective, and arguably the most accurate way of analyzing pluralistic ignorance, causes of divergence between public behaviors and private opinions are caused by conservative lags (change in attitude without a change in behavior), liberal leaps (change in behavior without a change in attitude), and social identities (conforming to societal expectations of how one should behave based on the traditional ideals of the group).

However, pluralistic ignorance describes the coincidence of a belief with inaccurate perceptions, but not the process by which those inaccurate perceptions are arrived at. Related phenomena, such as the spiral of silence and false consensus effect, demonstrate that pluralistic ignorance is not unique in its inaccurate assumption of others&#x27; opinions and these misconceptions can lead to negative consequences like groupthink and the bystander effect.

== History ==
Floyd Allport first discussed the phenomenon of &quot;literal attitude behavior inconsistency&quot; in 1924, observing society&#x27;s tendency to conform to social norms at a large scale even in the absence of personal agreement to those social norms. In an effort to explain this inconsistency, Allport presented the idea that individuals do not often act on personal conviction unless they believe those convictions are shared by the individuals around them. In Allport&#x27;s 1931 book titled &quot;Students Attitudes: A Report of the Syracuse University Research Study&quot;, which he co-wrote with his student Daniel Katz, the term &quot;pluralistic ignorance&quot; was used for the first time.

Allport and his students Daniel Katz and Richard Schanck produced studies of attitude change, racial stereotyping and prejudice, and their pursuit of the connections between individual psychology and social systems helped to found the field of organizational psychology.

Further behavioral, economic, and social psychology research was done by Todd Rose to demonstrate the interchangeability of the terms pluralistic ignorance and collective illusions. His findings of historical events, scientific studies and social media patterns indicate that by using either term one is saying the same thing. The societal systems like ours unconsciously participate in perpetuating false beliefs and narratives with a desire to fit in.

Although social psychologists, such as Allport and Katz, initiated the development of pluralistic ignorance, work pertaining to this phenomenon has since been heavily conducted by sociologists and public opinion researchers. This shift, in part, can be attributed to laboratory experiments, the primary research method of social psychology, proving insufficient in studying the inconsistencies between attitudes and norms.

As Allport was the first person to bring awareness to the phenomenon of pluralistic ignorance, it is important to point out that his analysis of this phenomenon was strictly at the individual level. He strongly disagreed with expanding the discussion to the larger group and involving the concept of shared cognition, &quot;the collective cognitive activity from individual group members where the collective activity has an impact on the overall group goals and activities.&quot;

This is not a unanimous stance for all those who have studied pluralistic ignorance. Sargent and Newman acknowledge that the individual aspects of pluralistic ignorance are important to discuss, but are lacking in providing a full picture of all the moving parts at play in the study of pluralistic ignorance. In their perspective, pluralistic ignorance is defined as &quot;a group-level phenomenon, wherein individuals belonging to a group mistakenly believe that others&#x27; cognitions (attitudes, beliefs, feelings) and/or behaviors differ systematically from their own, regardless of how the misperception arises&quot;.

==Research==
Prentice and Miller conducted a contemporary study on pluralistic ignorance, examining individuals beliefs on alcohol use and estimating the attitudes of their peers. The authors found that, on average, individual levels of comfort with drinking practices on campus were much lower than the perceived average. In one subset of experiments, they traced the attitude change toward alcohol consumption of men versus women over the semester. In men, the authors found a shifting of private attitudes toward this perceived norm, demonstrating a form of cognitive dissonance. Women were found to have no shift in attitude over the course of the semester. Additionally, students perceived deviance from the social norm on alcohol use was correlated with various measures of campus alienation. Even though that deviance from the social norm was only perceived, it shows how isolation from the larger population can lead to larger differences between an individual&#x27;s belief and the populations belief, leading to pluralistic ignorance. This study showed that the university students showcased pluralistic ignorance by individuals believing that the general populations comfort level with drinking practices was significantly higher than their personal comfort level, when in reality the individuals comfort level was quite similar to the general populations comfort level.

Additional research has shown that pluralistic ignorance plagues not only those who indulge, but also those who abstain. Examples consist of individuals beliefs on traditional vices such as gambling, smoking and drinking to lifestyles such as vegetarianism. With the latter showcasing that pluralistic ignorance can be caused by the structure of the underlying social network, not exclusively cognitive dissonance, demonstrating how pluralistic ignorance can arise through a variety of methods.

==Applications==

=== Racial segregation in the United States ===
Pluralistic ignorance was blamed for exacerbating support for racial segregation in the United States. It has also been named a reason for the illusory popular support that kept the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in power, as many opposed the regime but assumed that others were supporters of it. Thus, most people were afraid to voice their opposition.

=== Alcohol consumption on college campuses ===
Another case of pluralistic ignorance concerns drinking on campus in countries where alcohol use is prevalent at colleges and universities. Students drink at weekend parties and sometimes at evening study breaks. Many drink to excess, some on a routine basis. The high visibility of heavy drinking on campus, combined with reluctance by students to show any public signs of concern or disapproval, gives rise to pluralistic ignorance: Students believe that their peers are much more comfortable with this behavior than they themselves feel.

=== &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; fairy tale ===
Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s fairy tale &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; is a famous fictional case of pluralistic ignorance. In this story, two con artists come into the Emperor&#x27;s kingdom and convince him that they make the finest clothes in all of the land that can only be seen by anyone who was not stupid. The con artists continued to steal gold, silk and other precious items for their &quot;unique creation&quot;. Out of fear for being seen as stupid, all of the emperor&#x27;s men and townspeople kept silent about the fact they could not see the emperor&#x27;s clothes until finally a small child comes forth and says that the emperor is not wearing any clothes. Once the child is willing to admit that he cannot see any clothes on the emperor, the emperor and townspeople finally admit that the emperor has been tricked and that there was never an outfit being made.

=== Public concern for climate change ===
Pluralistic ignorance has also been blamed for large majorities of the public remaining silent on climate change—while &#x27;solid majorities&#x27; of the American and UK public are concerned about climate change, most erroneously believe they are in the minority with their concern. It has been suggested that pollution-intensive industries have contributed to the public&#x27;s underestimation of public support for climate solutions. For example, in the U.S., support for pollution pricing is high, yet public perception of public support is much lower.

In August 2022, &quot;Nature Communications&quot; published a survey with 6,119 representatively sampled Americans that found that 66 to 80% of Americans supported major climate change mitigation policies (i.e. 100% renewable energy by 2035, Green New Deal, carbon tax and dividend, renewable energy production siting on public land) and expressed climate concern, but that 80 to 90% of Americans underestimated the prevalence of support for such policies and such concern by their fellow Americans (with the sample estimating that only 37 to 43% on average supported such policies). Americans in every state and every assessed demographic (e.g. political ideology, racial group, urban/suburban/rural residence, educational attainment) underestimated support across all policies tested, and every state survey group and every demographic assessed underestimated support for the climate policies by at least 20 percentage points. The researchers attributed the misperception among the general public to pluralistic ignorance. Conservatives were found to underestimate support for the policies due to a false consensus effect, exposure to more conservative local norms, and consumption of conservative news, while liberals were suggested to underestimate support for the policies due to a false-uniqueness effect.

=== Tulip mania of 1634 ===
Another example of pluralistic ignorance is the tulip mania of 1634. It is a great example of how investors can be swept up in a financial frenzy due to collective illusion. The Dutch elite decided that having one&#x27;s own unique collection of the spring flowering bulbs was an absolute necessity. So, despite the flower&#x27;s lack of any intrinsic value, the prices began to rise.

=== Women working outside the home in Saudi Arabia ===
According to a 2020 study, the vast majority of young married men in Saudi Arabia express private beliefs in support of women working outside the home but they substantially underestimate the degree to which other similar men support it. Once they become informed about the widespread nature of the support, they increasingly help their wives obtain jobs.

=== Prioritizing college in America ===
According to a 2023 survey, most Americans do not prioritize college while believing most other Americans do. Similarly, the belief that society does not prioritize personally fulfilling work or that others desire a one-size-fits-all model of education is a collective illusion.

== Causes of divergence in public vs. private opinion ==
Pluralistic ignorance can arise due to various aspects of human interaction. These are three key causes of pluralistic ignorance when analyzing the phenomenon at the group level.

=== Conservative lag ===
The conservative lag is the most common cause of pluralistic ignorance and has also been labeled as &quot;conservative bias&quot;. This cause refers to a change in attitude that is not then followed by a change in behavior. A popular example of a conservative lag would be the civil rights movement. Although there was a shift in the private opinions of White Americans toward African Americans and the practice of segregation, a shift in social norms and public behavior did not come until long after. This example of pluralistic ignorance demonstrates a valuable aspect of social change, &quot;a society&#x27;s perception of itself tends to lag behind actual changes in people&#x27;s private beliefs and values&quot;.

=== Liberal leap ===
A liberal leap is described as a change in behavior that is not then followed by a change in attitude. This cause is often associated with revolutions or polarizing events that shift the fabric of society, resulting in a change in behavior. A couple examples would be the shift in the French&#x27;s public support of the Church in the 18th century, but their attitudes staying the same or the sexual revolution in America during the 60s and 70s that resulted in a change in public behavior and sexual expression, yet personal attitudes toward sexual behavior remained consistent.

=== Social identities ===
This cause of pluralistic ignorance focuses on the correlation between one&#x27;s social identity and their behavior in social settings. In an effort to conform to certain values, ideals, and norms, an individual&#x27;s behavior may not align with their attitude or beliefs. This is commonly associated with studies involving gender norms, such as children choosing to play with toys and engage in activities that are associated with their biological gender, even when they may have an interest in something that does not fit the traditional expectation.

==Consequences==
In recent years, pluralistic ignorance has been categorized as a roadblock to collective action involving important public issues, such as climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic.
 That there was pluralistic ignorance has also been seen as a reason why far-right parties have been growing so fast in recent years.

Another consequence of pluralistic ignorance is groupthink. This refers to a situation where small, cohesive groups of intelligent individuals are led to make unintelligent decisions. Taking it a step further is the &quot;illusion of unanimity&quot;, which describes a situation where an individual believes that they are the only one in the group that does not agree with the decision being made. Oftentimes, this illusion causes individuals to embrace the decision, as bad as it may be, if they feel their disagreement is not shared with the other members of the group.

Perhaps the most researched consequence of pluralistic ignorance from an individualistic perspective is the bystander effect. In its most rudimentary form, the bystander effect describes a situation in which an individual is witnessing an event that prompts a strong set of emotions, yet they choose not to act on them since the surrounding &quot;bystanders&quot; are making no visible efforts to act, giving the impression that the individual&#x27;s feelings toward the situation are invalid and not shared. This ultimately can result in a lack of action from everyone witnessing the event when action may be the appropriate choice given the situation.

Maintaining the perspective of the individual, pluralistic ignorance can also cause people to feel alienated from a specific group. When one&#x27;s personal attitude is seemingly in contrast to the majority, if not all, of those in the group, it can cause the individual to become &quot;embittered&quot; and &quot;suspicious of those around them&quot;. It may even motivate the individual to speak out against what is the perceived majority view or go completely silent. The most probable result is the conformity of the individual in the way they speak and behave, possibly to the point of changing their personal convictions, in what might be the inaccurately perceived majority opinion.

==Related phenomena==

=== False consensus effect ===
Pluralistic ignorance can be compared with the false consensus effect. In pluralistic ignorance, people privately disdain but publicly support a norm (or a belief), while the false consensus effect causes people to wrongly assume that most people think like they do, while in reality most people do not think like they do (and express the disagreement openly). For instance, pluralistic ignorance may lead students to drink alcohol excessively because they believe that everyone else does so, while in reality everyone else also wishes they could avoid binge drinking but no one expresses that wish out of fear of being ostracized. A false consensus for the same situation would mean that the student believes that most other people do not enjoy excessive drinking, while in fact most other people do enjoy that and openly express their opinion about it.

A study undertaken by Greene, House, and Ross used simple circumstantial questionnaires on Stanford undergrads to gather information on the false consensus effect. They compiled thoughts on the choice they felt people would or should make, considering traits such as shyness, cooperativeness, trust, and adventurousness. Studies found that when explaining their decisions, participants gauged choices based on what they explained as &quot;people in general&quot; and their idea of &quot;typical&quot; answers. For each of the stories those subjects said that they personally would follow a given behavioral alternative also tended to rate that alternative as relatively probable for &quot;people in general&quot;: those subjects who claimed that they would reject the alternative tended to rate it as relatively improbable for &quot;people in general&quot;. It was evident that the influence of the subjects&#x27; own behavior choice affected the estimates of commonness. Although it would seem as if the two are built on the same premise of social norms, they take two very oppositional stances on a similar phenomenon. The false consensus effect considers that in predicting an outcome, people will assume that the masses agree with their opinion and think the same way they do on an issue, whereas the opposite is true of pluralistic ignorance, where the individual does not agree with a certain action but go along with it anyway, believing that their view is not shared with the masses (which is usually untrue).

=== False uniqueness effect ===
This phenomenon is similar to pluralistic ignorance in that it involves observing the differences in oneself compared to others, rather than the similarities. This observation of others is often negative, alluding to one&#x27;s habit of viewing oneself as better at possessing positive characteristics when compared to those around them. Unlike pluralistic ignorance, false uniqueness effect is a distinctly individual phenomenon with no beginning or outcomes associated with group dynamics.

=== Spiral of silence ===
The parallel between pluralistic ignorance and the spiral of silence comes from their joint interest in the reasoning behind the shift in public opinion perceptions in relation to the public&#x27;s genuine attitudes. When viewing pluralistic ignorance through a social perspective, one can assess how it is caused through misinformation that is shared broadly by those who are highly visible. This is where the concept of visibility becomes most important in understanding the intertwined web of pluralistic ignorance and the spiral of silence.

When a group stands out by way of making the most noise or causing the most chaos, this can give the impression that the group is more influential than they actually are. The spiraling process is initiated by the most visible and expressed opinions being shared loudly and publicly, while the genuine and differing opinions of the group are not expressed (or not on the same scale), causing a misleading depiction of the group&#x27;s true attitudes and beliefs. Thus, pluralistic ignorance gives way to a shift in the climate of opinion, which then causes the spiral of silence to perpetuate as those who view their attitudes and beliefs as the minority opinion (when they might not be) choose to remain silent.

<doc id="1098765" wikidata="Q2699823" url="?curid=1098765" title="Morgan Edge">
<text>Morgan Edge is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Originally a supporting character, he is a media mogul who acquires &quot;The Daily Planet&quot; and employs Clark Kent as a television journalist for his WGBS TV network. After the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earth&quot; series which led to a revision of the DC Universe, the character was a leader of Intergang.

Adrian Pasdar portrayed Morgan Edge in the Arrowverse series &quot;Supergirl&quot;. In &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;, Adam Rayner played a version of the character who is also Superman&#x27;s Kryptonian half-brother [[Tal-Rho]].

==Publication history==
Morgan Edge first appeared in &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal, Jimmy Olsen&quot; #133 and was created by Jack Kirby. Kirby based his physical appearance on actor Kevin McCarthy, while his personality was inspired by television executive James T. Aubrey. According to Kirby&#x27;s production assistant Mark Evanier, Kirby &quot;wanted to explore the theme of organized crime gaining a foothold in corporate America - particularly a giant media conglomerate. Given the shady background of the company that acquired Warner Bros. and DC [i.e. Kinney National Company], it was something of an inside joke.&quot; However, under prodding from editorial staff who preferred Edge to be an ongoing supporting character rather than a villain who would ultimately have to be brought to justice (and thus written out of the series), the &quot;Morgan Edge&quot; connected to Intergang was revealed to be an imposter.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-Crisis===
In his original incarnation, Edge was the president of the Galaxy Broadcasting System (owners of television station WGBS), a media corporation that eventually bought the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;. Edge was in many ways a stereotype of a ruthless capitalist, intervening in the &quot;Planet&quot;″s homey atmosphere and challenging the authority of the somewhat older Perry White, but he was a decent man who had moments of good-heartedness and maintained reasonably friendly relationships with most of his employees, including Clark Kent. Following the takeover of the &quot;Planet&quot;, Edge transferred Kent to the news division, making him a traveling correspondent and later anchorman on WGBS. This move added several TV co-workers to the &quot;Superman&quot; supporting cast, including fretful producer Josh Coyle, sports broadcaster Steve Lombard, weather forecaster Oscar Asherman, and co-anchor Lana Lang (who had been one of Clark&#x27;s childhood friends in Smallville).

As one of the wealthiest men in Metropolis, Edge was a major political figure in the city and frequently encountered Superman, the subject of many of his network&#x27;s news stories, whom he, like most others, failed to realize was also Clark Kent. Although rarely integral to a plotline, Edge was a supporting character in many Superman stories.

For a while, it appeared that Edge was connected to the Apokolips-sponsored crime organisation Intergang, but this was revealed to be a clone created by the &#x27;Evil Factory&#x27;, a genetics laboratory working for Darkseid. For example, this clone attempted to have Jimmy Olsen, the Guardian and, incidentally, a random &quot;Daily Planet&quot; employee named Goody Rickels, a Don Rickles lookalike, murdered as part of a cover-up.

It was later revealed that Morgan Edge is Jewish and was born Morris Edelstein before changing his name, as he was ashamed of his background and worked to keep it secret.

===Post-Crisis===
When DC continuity was rebooted after the &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Edge remained president of WGBS, but his ties to the &quot;Planet&quot; and friendship with Superman were retconned away, and he was genuinely connected to Intergang. He was eventually exposed by the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, in articles by Clark Kent and Cat Grant, who was working for WGBS undercover. Edge was imprisoned, but even managed to cause trouble there by publishing his autobiography &quot;On the Edge&quot;, which dumped upon his father Vincent Edge as well as Cat Grant, revealing that she slept her way into a scoop. After his release from jail, Morgan Edge returned as sponsor of the Superman Revenge Squad. Prior to his imprisonment, one of his actions generated much fan anger, in which Edge sadistically and gleefully ran over a raccoon on the road, prompting one fan to write in saying &quot;Lex Luthor treats people like animals, but even he does not run them over intentionally&quot;.

Recently, Morgan Edge has resurfaced as a powerful media pundit, with the show &quot;Edge of Reason&quot;, where he gives off anti-Kryptonian spin for General Lane. He is also seen in a &quot;flash-forward&quot; panel in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; (vol. 2) #1, making a mysterious deal with Despero.

===The New 52===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC universe. Morgan Edge appears as a powerful and self-centered media mogul and the new owner of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;, he is seen as the sponsor of the Challengers of the Unknown program before they all leave due to his ruthless business strategy. This version of Morgan Edge is depicted as a bald African American man with a goatee. Although a tough businessman, Edge did recognize talent, and awarded Lois Lane the editorship of the &quot;Daily Planet&quot;.

Edge&#x27;s multiple media holdings become a benefit to Superman as Lois Lane, now director of Edge&#x27;s Metropolis news station, has said building&#x27;s security cameras &quot;hacked&quot; to provide vital intelligence on a rampaging villain.

Prior to &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, in the last issue of the 2011 Justice League series, it is mentioned that Lex Luthor had bought the Daily Planet from him.

==In other media==
===Television===
* Morgan Edge appears in &quot;Smallville&quot;, initially portrayed by Rutger Hauer and later by Patrick Bergin. This version is a Metropolis crime lord and old friend of Lionel Luthor, who he grew up with in Suicide Slum. He later conspires with Lionel to break Lex Luthor&#x27;s psyche before being killed.
* Morgan Edge appears in the &quot;Justice League&quot; episode &quot;Secret Society&quot;, voiced by an uncredited Brian George. This version is a collector of unique oddities and displays no moral qualms against collecting sentient beings, such as Clayface, whom he kept in a jar for some time until the eponymous Secret Society rescues him.
* Morgan Edge appears in the third season of &quot;Supergirl&quot;, portrayed by Adrian Pasdar. This version is an amoral real estate developer who runs Edge Global.
* Morgan Edge appears in &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;, portrayed by Adam Rayner. This version is a Kryptonian named Tal-Rho, the son of Lara Lor-Van and Zeta-Rho (portrayed by A.C. Peterson) and the maternal half-brother of Superman. Like Superman, Tal-Rho was also sent off of Krypton in an escape pod. After landing in England, he comes into conflict with the local townspeople and is captured and experimented on, developing a hatred of humanity in the process. After escaping, he develops the identity of &quot;Morgan Edge&quot;, an intelligent, eloquent, and impassioned self-made mogul and the head of EnerCorp and Galaxy Holdings. In the first season, he enacts a plot to resurrect Krypton on Earth by implanting Kryptonian consciousnesses into human hosts using X-Kryptonite and the Eradicator, only to be defeated by Superman and John Henry Irons and remanded to a cell with red solar lighting. In the second season, Tal-Rho assists Superman in fighting Ally Allston before relocating to the Inverse World.
** Tal-Rho&#x27;s Inverse World counterpart appears in the episode &quot;Bizarros in a Bizarro World&quot;, also portrayed by Rayner. He is married to his version of Lana Lang and is on good terms with Bizarro before being killed by Allston.

<text>Advanced HeroQuest is a board game published by Games Workshop in 1989, a sequel to &quot;HeroQuest&quot;.

==Description==
The original &quot;HeroQuest&quot; was an adventure board game created in 1989 by Milton Bradley in conjunction with the British company Games Workshop. Later the same year, Games Workshop released &quot;Advanced HeroQuest&quot;, a similar but more complex game. Changes from &quot;HeroQuest&quot; include more complex and RPG-like rules, a modular board and the use of henchmen. The included quests feature the heroes entering a Skaven-infested dungeon in order to retrieve a magical artifact. While the only monsters included in the miniatures set are the rat men known as Skaven, statistics for all the monsters that appear in the HeroQuest game are given, and it is possible to meet some or all of them via the random generation encounter tables.

==Contents==
The boxed set includes:
* 64-page rule book that includes four introductory scenarios
* 42 plastic 25 mm miniatures and doors
* 78 counters and interlocking room and corridor sections that are combined to produce modular maps
==Gameplay==
The game uses 12-sided dice for skill and combat resolution. Both heroes and monsters are defined by Weapon Skill, Bow Skill, Strength, Toughness, Wounds, Speed, Intelligence, and Bravery.

Combat is resolved in melee by rolling a target figure that is determined by the difference between the target&#x27;s and player&#x27;s Weapon Skills; in ranged combat, the target number is determined by how far away the target is versus the character&#x27;s Bow Skill. In both cases, if the target number is achieved, the attacker rolls a number of dice determined by Strength and what weapon was being used. The number of dice that exceed the opponent&#x27;s Toughness becomes the number of Wounds inflicted.

==Expansion==
An expansion to &quot;Advanced HeroQuest&quot; called &quot;Terror In The Dark&quot; was released in 1991, adding new monsters, treasures, and spells. The included quest featured the heroes being pitted against the Lichemaster, a powerful necromancer.

Contrary to popular belief, the Lichemaster did not appear in the original &quot;HeroQuest&quot; game. Instead, this character is loosely based on Heinrich Kemmler, a necromancer from the &quot;Warhammer Fantasy Battle&quot; Lichemaster campaign.

==Reception==
In the January 1990 edition of &quot;Games International&quot; (Issue 12), Philip A. Murphy&#x27;s original impression was that this was exactly the same game as the original &quot;HeroQuest&quot;, albeit produced by Games Workshop rather than Milton-Bradley. Nevertheless he admired the production values, calling all the components &quot;a true delight and all other producers [...] could learn a lesson from GW&#x27;s attention to quality components.&quot; However, Murphy did not like &quot;the constant references, by word and image, to &quot;Warhammer&quot; this, &quot;Warhammer&quot; that, Citadel miniatures, Citadel paints, future supplements and &quot;White Dwarf&quot; magazine.&quot; While he felt that the original game by Milton-Bradley &quot;had been rushed out of production [...] and could have been much better with more playtesting&quot;, Murphy felt that &quot;Advanced HeroQuest&quot; had the opposite problem, calling it &quot;overproduced and a tad too complex.&quot; He concluded by giving the game an average rating of 3 out of 5, saying &quot;it should be magnificent, and indeed at times it is. But just as often, it&#x27;s a great disappointment.&quot;

The German website &quot;Spielphase&quot; gave the game a rating of 5 out of 6, saying, &quot;You get a lot of material for your money. [...] Even if I&#x27;m not a big fan of role-playing games or thematically related board games, I have to acknowledge that a reality is represented quite well by tables and a varied game is possible over a long period of time.&quot;

<doc id="1098781" wikidata="Q7903449" url="?curid=1098781" title="Uttoxeter Canal">
<text>The Uttoxeter Canal was a thirteen-mile extension of the Caldon Canal running from Froghall as far as Uttoxeter in Staffordshire, England. It was authorised in 1797, but did not open until 1811. With the exception of the first lock and basin at Froghall, it closed in 1849, in order that the Churnet Valley line of the North Staffordshire Railway could be constructed along its length. The railway has since been dismantled and there are plans to reinstate the canal.

==History==
The Uttoxeter Canal was promoted by the Trent and Mersey Canal Company and authorised by an act of Parliament, the Trent and Mersey Canal Act 1797 (37 Geo. 3. c. 81). This was a political move, designed to prevent a rival scheme for a canal to Uttoxeter. The planned Commercial Canal was intended to link the Chester Canal at Nantwich to the Ashby Canal at Moira, passing through Stoke-on-Trent and Uttoxeter, and would have had a serious impact on the profitability of the Trent and Mersey Company if it had been built.

Powers to alter the proposed route at Alton were included in the Trent and Mersey Canal (Railways) Act 1802 (42 Geo 3. c. xxv), but because the new canal was not expected to be profitable, construction was delayed. Ten years after the act was passed, work began under the direction of the canal engineer John Rennie, with the canal opening on 3 September 1811. It is sometimes referred to as a branch of the Caldon Canal. 19 locks were required to drop the level of the canal as it passed down the valley of the River Churnet.

Froghall Basin was the transshipment point for limestone brought from Caldon Low quarries, a few miles to the east. The limestone was carried along a plate tramway, one of the first to use iron rails, which was built in 1758. The tramway was rebuilt on a new alignment in 1785, and completely rebuilt in 1800. In 1849, it was replaced by a cable railway. Three locomotives worked the tracks at Froghall Basin, named &quot;Toad&quot;, &quot;Frog&quot; and &quot;Bobs&quot;. The quarries ceased operation in 1920.

There was a proposal to construct a branch to Ashbourne, and another in 1839 to extend the canal along the Dove Valley to link up with the Trent and Mersey Canal, but no details of the precise routes have survived. The canal was not a financial success, and the Trent and Mersey Company made plans to close it. However, the canal company was taken over by the North Staffordshire Railway, and with the exception of the first lock and the basin at Froghall, which remained in use until about 1930, the canal was closed by the railway company on 15 January 1849. A large part of it was subsequently filled in, and used for the route of the Churnet Valley railway line (which incidentally, although it is now dismantled, had the first automatic, train-operated level-crossing in the UK, at Spath, just outside Uttoxeter.)

A few bridges from the Uttoxeter Canal still exist, with the occasional milepost visible, including two which have been relocated to the bowling green in Denstone village. Very little can be seen of the canal in Uttoxeter, but there is still evidence it existed, as there is an area called &quot;The Wharf&quot;.

==Restoration==
The Caldon Canal Society was formed in 1961, and worked to reopen the Caldon Canal to Froghall. This was achieved in 1974, and Froghall Wharf remained the terminus for some 25 years. However, they started to think about restoring the first lock on the Uttoxeter Canal, and the basin below it, in 2000. This became known as &quot;Restoration Froghall&quot; in early 2003, and included plans for better facilities at the terminus. The scheme was costed at £800,000, and received a grant from the North-East Staffordshire Rural Regeneration Funds. At the end of the year, a formal partnership between British Waterways and the newly-renamed Caldon and Uttoxeter Canals Trust was announced, with the stated intention of completing the project by early 2005. It took a little longer than intended, but the lock and basin were formally reopened in July 2005.
The Caldon and Uttoxeter Canals Trust then turned their attention to the feasibility of restoring the canal from Froghall to Uttoxeter. The situation was complicated by the fact that the revived Churnet Valley Railway terminated at Froghall, and they were originally going to reopen the railway to Oakamoor, but since 2018 they have been engaged in extending their line at the opposite end towards Leek. There were also threats at the southern end, when plans for a bypass which would be built along the line of the canal from Denstone to Alton Towers were announced. The scheme would have cost £12 million, and be largely funded by the theme park. The trust campaigned against it, using the provisions of PPG13, a government guideline that states that new road schemes should not hinder canal restoration schemes, and the new management of Alton Towers, who were in favour of canal restoration, argued that the scheme was unnecessary, as congestion only occurred during the six weeks of the summer school holidays.

To the south of Denstone, the original route is blocked by the JCB factory at Rocester, which has been built over the locations of Cottons and Taylors locks. Staffordshire County Council and the trust jointly commissioned a feasibility report in 2009, which was produced by the engineering consultancy Halcrow Group, and examined whether there was a possible route to the south of Denstone, terminating at the Uttoxeter gravel pits, which were nearly worked out. After discarding the original route with small diversions, they identified two possible routes which would be relatively easy to construct, both passing to the east of the JCB site.

During the 2010s, the trust concentrated most of their effort on the from Alton to Crumpwood Weir, most of which is owned by the Alton Towers theme park. Bridge 70 was the only original bridge still remaining on the canal, but its ownership could not be established. Staffordshire Moorlands District Council issued a compulsory purchase order against it, and having acquired it, sold it to the trust for £2. The bridge had been restored by September 2016, and some of the adjacent towpath was repaired and resurfaced. The Waterway Recovery Group have visited the canal several times, and have cleared most of the trees on this section, including a huge sycamore whose roots were damaging Crumpwood Weir. They also discovered that Carringtons Lock, immediately above the weir, was still largely intact, although buried, and found a wharf originally built by Lord Shrewsbury in the early 1800s to enable construction materials for Alton Towers House to be unloaded. Divers have investigated Crumpwood Weir, and although it is heavily silted at one end, it is in good condition. It was built by John Rennie so that the canal could cross the river on the level, rather than needing an aqueduct. The weir itself, which is grade II listed, is around long, with abutments at both ends. Water drops vertically, and then down an inclined slope. 

Just to the south of the weir, the lock keepers cottage, which had been derelict for many years, was sold in August 2018 and was undergoing renovation in early 2019. There was a water pumping station to the north of the weir, which was no longer in use, and the Environment Agency announced their intention to construct a fish ladder there in 2019, to enable trout and salmon to migrate up the river more easily. The pumping station contains water turbines, which were used to pump drinking water to the local community, and the Larinier fish pass consists of a resting pool within the pump house, with the fish using the inlet and outlet pipes from the turbines to reach it. It is expected that it will be possible to operate the turbines from time to time to demonstrate how the heritage asset worked. As part of the work, one of the turbines was removed, so that it can be displayed, and the project was carried out by the Environment Agency, helped by JCB who loaned heavy equipment, and the Staffordshire Wildlife Trust. The fish pass enables fish to negotiate the difference in height, and will enable salmon, trout, grayling and chub to colonise of river above the weir. The structure was operational by September 2019.

* Victorians standardised the rules for association football, or soccer, based on a range of games already played, such as the Eton wall game.
* Walter Clopton Wingfield invented the game of lawn tennis, which allowed young men and women to socialise together, and to get more exercise than by playing the sedate game of croquet.
* Victorians set down rules for formal dining, and invented the fish knife. Mrs Beeton documented recipes and how to run a household.
* Florence Nightingale recorded extensive details of wounded soldiers in the Crimean War, and used these statistics to demonstrate to a Royal Commission the effectiveness of simple hygiene in reducing unnecessary deaths.
* In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev formulated the periodic table of the chemical elements, including gaps where as-yet undiscovered elements would fit.
* Joseph Whitworth devised a series of standards for engineering, and built a rifle with an accurately-rifled barrel.
* Greenwich Observatory was used to define the official time for the whole country, and the zero line of longitude.

<doc id="1098795" wikidata="Q275111" url="?curid=1098795" title="Frances Ridley Havergal">
<text>Frances Ridley Havergal (14 December 1836 – 3 June 1879) was an English religious poet and hymnwriter. &quot;Take My Life and Let it Be&quot; and &quot;Thy Life for Me&quot; (also known as &quot;I Gave My Life for Thee&quot;) are two of her best known hymns. She also wrote hymn melodies, religious tracts, and works for children. She did not occupy, and did not claim for herself, a prominent place as a poet, but she carved out a niche for herself.

==Early life and education==
Frances Ridley Havergal was born into an Anglican family, at Astley in Worcestershire, 14 December 1836. Her father, William Henry Havergal (1793–1870), was a clergyman, writer, composer, and hymnwriter. Her brother, Henry East Havergal, was a priest in the Church of England and an organist.

When she was five, her father moved to the Rectory of St. Nicholas, Worcester. In August, 1850, she entered Mrs. Teed&#x27;s school, who had a strong influence on her. In the following year she says, &quot;I committed my soul to the Saviour, and earth and heaven seemed brighter from that moment.&quot; A short sojourn in Germany followed. In 1852/3, she studied in the Louisenschule, Düsseldorf, and at Oberkassel. Havergal&#x27;s scholastic acquirements were extensive, embracing several modern languages, together with Greek and Hebrew.

On her return to England, she was confirmed in Worcester Cathedral, 17 July 1853.

==Career==
In 1860, she left Worcester upon her father resigning the Rectory of St. Nicholas, and resided at different periods in Leamington, and at Caswell Bay, Swansea, broken by visits to Switzerland, Scotland, and North Wales. It was during this time—1873—that she read J. T. Renford&#x27;s little booklet &quot;All For Jesus&quot;, which &quot;lifted her whole life into sunshine, of which all she had previously experienced was but as pale and passing April gleams, compared with the fullness of summer glory.&quot; She led a quiet life, not enjoying consistent good health. She supported the Church Missionary Society.

Havergal&#x27;s hymns were frequently printed by J. &amp; R. Parlane as leaflets, and by Caswall &amp; Co. as ornamental cards. They were gathered together from time to time and published in her works as follows:— (1) &quot;Ministry of Song&quot;, 1869; (2) &quot;Twelve Sacred Songs for Little Singers&quot;, 1870; (3) &quot;Under the Surface&quot;, 1874; (4) &quot;Loyal Responses&quot;, 1878; (5) &quot;Life Mosaic&quot;, 1879; (6) &quot;Life Chords&quot;, 1880; and (7) &quot;Life Echoes&quot;, 1883.

About fifteen of the more important of Havergal&#x27;s hymns, including “Golden harps are sounding,” “I gave my life for thee,&quot; “Jesus, Master, Whose I am,” “Lord, speak to me,” “O Master, at Thy feet,” “Take my life and let it be,” “Tell it out among the heathen,&quot; &amp;c., are annotated under their respective first lines. The rest, which are in collections, number nearly fifty. These are noted here, together with dates and places of composition, from the &quot;Havergal&quot; manuscripts and the works in which they were published. Those which were printed in &quot;Parlane&#x27;s Series of Leaflets&quot; are distinguished as (&quot;P.&quot;, 1872, &amp;c.) and those in &quot;Caswall&#x27;s&quot; series (&quot;C.&quot;, 1873, &amp;c).

Most of these hymns are given in &quot;Snepp&#x27;s Songs of Grace and Glory&quot;, and many of them are also in several other hymn-books, including &quot;Hymns Ancient and Modern&quot;, &quot;Hymns and Sacred Lyrics&quot;, &quot;Church Hymns&quot;, &quot;The Hymnal Companion&quot;, and some of the leading American collections.

==Death and legacy==

Havergal died of peritonitis near Caswell Bay on the Gower Peninsula in Wales at age 42. She is buried in the far western corner of the churchyard at St Peter&#x27;s parish church, Astley, together with her father and near her sister, Maria V. G. Havergal.

Her sisters saw much of her work published posthumously. Havergal College, a private girls&#x27; school in Toronto, is named after her. The composer Havergal Brian adopted the name as a tribute to the Havergal family.

==Style and themes==
Her hymns praised the love of God, and His way of salvation to this end, and for this object, her whole life and all her powers were consecrated. She lived and spoke in every line of her poetry.

Her religious views and theological bias were distinctly set forth in her poems, and may be described as mildly Calvinistic, without the severe dogmatic tenet of reprobation. The burden of her writings was a free and full salvation, through the Redeemer&#x27;s merits, for every sinner who will receive it, and her life was devoted to the proclamation of this truth by personal labours, literary efforts, and earnest interest in Foreign Missions.

<text>Lok Shakti (lit. People&#x27;s Power) was a political party in India. Lok Shakti was one of several parties that were formed when the Janata Dal crumbled in the mid-1990s. LS was formed in February 1997 after Ramakrishna Hegde was expelled from Janata Dal. Lok Shakti emerged as a major party in Karnataka. It was a founding member of the National Democratic Alliance. It eventually merged with Janta Dal (United) .

== Merger ==

Before the 1999 general election, faction led by then Chief Minister of Karnataka J. H. Patel lent support to the National Democratic Alliance, leading to the split in the Janata Dal. This caused the formation of Janata Dal (Secular) under H. D. Deve Gowda, who wanted to remain equidistant from both national parties; and Janata Dal (United) under Sharad Yadav. 

Janata Dal (United) was formed with the merger of the Sharad Yadav faction of the Janata Dal, the Lok Shakti and the Samata Party. On 30 October 2003, the Samata Party led by George Fernandes and Nitish Kumar merged with the Janata Dal. The merged entity was called Janata Dal (United) with the arrow symbol of Janata Dal (United) and the green and white flag of the Samata Party. But Election Commission of India refused the merger of Samata Party. Brahmanand Mandal became the president, but he is suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and not physically well so Uday Mandal became President and he has taken charge of the Samata Party. The uniting force is believed to be common opposition to Rashtriya Janata Dal in Bihar especially after the Rashtriya Janata Dal welcomed Samata Party rebels like Raghunath Jha into the party.

<doc id="1098814" wikidata="Q5345413" url="?curid=1098814" title="Edward Stanley, Lord Stanley (died 1938)">
<text>Edward Montagu Cavendish Stanley, Lord Stanley, (9 July 1894 – 16 October 1938) was a British Conservative politician. The eldest son of the 17th Earl of Derby, he held minor political office before being appointed Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs in 1938, sitting in the cabinet alongside his brother Oliver Stanley. However, Stanley died only five months after this appointment, aged 44; his eldest son, Edward John Stanley, later succeeded to the earldom in his stead.

==Early life and education==
Stanley was born at 36 Great Cumberland Place, Marylebone, London, the eldest son and heir apparent of Hon. Edward Stanley, later to become 17th Earl of Derby, by Lady Alice Montagu.

Stanley was spectacularly well-connected to leading political families. His father was at the time of Stanley&#x27;s birth Conservative MP for Westhoughton, Lancashire, and went on to serve as Secretary of State for War from 1916 to 1918 and from 1922 to 1924. His paternal grandfather, the 16th Earl of Derby, was a former Lancashire MP, Colonial Secretary, and Governor-General of Canada. His great-uncle, the 15th Earl, twice served as Foreign Secretary and was Prime Minister Lord Salisbury&#x27;s stepfather, while his best-known ancestor was his great-grandfather, the 14th Earl, who was Leader of the Conservative Party for 22 years (1846–1868; the longest tenure in that office) and Prime Minister three times (1852, 1858–59, and 1866–68). His paternal grandmother, Lady Constance Villiers, was daughter of Lord Clarendon, who himself served on three occasions as Foreign Secretary. Lord Stanley&#x27;s paternal uncles Sir Arthur and Sir George also served as Conservative MPs.

His maternal grandfather was William Montagu, 7th Duke of Manchester, also a Conservative peer and MP. His maternal grandmother Louisa von Alten married after the death of the Duke of Manchester, Spencer, Duke of Devonshire, also known as Lord Hartington, who for a time (before inheriting his peerage) was Leader of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons.

His sister, Lady Victoria, married firstly Neil Primrose, the son of Liberal Prime Minister Lord Rosebery. After Neil&#x27;s death in the First World War, she married Conservative politician Malcolm Bullock.

His younger brother was Oliver Stanley, whose son Richard became an MP.

He became known by the courtesy title &quot;Lord Stanley&quot; in 1908, when his father succeeded in the earldom of Derby. He was educated at Eton and Magdalen College, Oxford.

==Military career==
Lord Stanley was commissioned a second lieutenant on 2 July 1914. He was promoted to temporary lieutenant in the Grenadier Guards on 15 November 1914, later with seniority from 3 November 1914, and became a substantive lieutenant on 11 November 1914.

On 29 January 1916, he was made a supernumerary temporary captain with the Guards, relinquishing the rank on 12 May 1916. Lord Stanley was appointed adjutant of the newly formed Household Battalion on 9 September 1916, again as a temporary captain. He received a substantive captaincy on 26 September 1916 and served as adjutant until 12 January 1917.

He was appointed a staff captain and seconded on 13 August 1917, and made a brigade major on 22 January 1918, a post he held until 11 March 1918. He served as a general staff officer, 3rd grade, from 6 May 1918 to 8 October 1918. On 9 October 1918, he was again appointed a brigade major, serving in that capacity until 2 November 1919. Lord Stanley was awarded the Military Cross on 3 June 1919, for his service in Italy during the First World War. On 27 November 1920, he retired from the Army and entered the reserve of officers as a captain.

==Political career==
Lord Stanley was first elected to Parliament on 28 June 1917 in a by-election in Liverpool Abercromby. He left Parliament the following year, when the seat was abolished for the 1918 general election. During this time, he was the Baby of the House. He returned to Parliament in the 1922 general election when he was elected for Fylde. He served under Stanley Baldwin as a Junior Lord of the Treasury from 1924 to 1927 and was a Deputy Chairman of the Conservative Party from 1927 to 1929.

On the formation of the National Government after the 1931, Stanley was made Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty under Ramsay MacDonald. On 26 February 1934, he was admitted to the Privy Council. In 1935 he was made Under-Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs by Baldwin, and later that year was made Parliamentary and Financial Secretary to the Admiralty. Two years later, Lord Stanley became Under-Secretary of State for India and Burma.

On 16 May 1938 he entered the cabinet as Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs. His brother, Oliver, was also in the Cabinet as President of the Board of Trade. However, in October 1938, five months after being appointed to the cabinet, Lord Stanley died in Marylebone, aged 44. Neville Chamberlain paid tribute to him in the House of Commons:

==Marriage and issue==
Lord Stanley married the Hon. Sibyl Louise Beatrix Cadogan, daughter of Henry Cadogan, Viscount Chelsea (heir apparent of 5th Earl Cadogan), in 1917. Their wedding at Guards&#x27; Chapel, Wellington Barracks, was attended by King George and Queen Mary, Queen Alexandra of Denmark, and Mary, Princess Royal. Sibyl was given away by her stepfather, Admiral of the Fleet Sir Hedworth Meux. The Earl of Dalkeith (later Duke of Buccleuch) was best man. They had three sons:

*Hon. (Edward) John (1918–1994), succeeded his grandfather as 18th Earl of Derby
*Hon. Richard Oliver (1920–1983), MP for Fylde North
*Hon. Hugh Henry Stanley (1926–1971), father of Edward Stanley, 19th Earl of Derby

He died in Marylebone in October 1938, aged 44, predeceasing his father by ten years. His eldest son, John, succeeded his grandfather in the earldom in 1948. Lady Stanley died in June 1969, aged 76.

<doc id="1098818" wikidata="Q5531551" url="?curid=1098818" title="Gene expression programming">
<text>Gene expression programming (GEP) in computer programming is an evolutionary algorithm that creates computer programs or models. These computer programs are complex tree structures that learn and adapt by changing their sizes, shapes, and composition, much like a living organism. And like living organisms, the computer programs of GEP are also encoded in simple linear chromosomes of fixed length. Thus, GEP is a genotype–phenotype system, benefiting from a simple genome to keep and transmit the genetic information and a complex phenotype to explore the environment and adapt to it.

==Background==
Evolutionary algorithms use populations of individuals, select individuals according to fitness, and introduce genetic variation using one or more genetic operators. Their use in artificial computational systems dates back to the 1950s where they were used to solve optimization problems (e.g. Box 1957 and Friedman 1959). But it was with the introduction of evolution strategies by Rechenberg in 1965 that evolutionary algorithms gained popularity. A good overview text on evolutionary algorithms is the book &quot;An Introduction to Genetic Algorithms&quot; by Mitchell (1996).

Gene expression programming belongs to the family of evolutionary algorithms and is closely related to genetic algorithms and genetic programming. From genetic algorithms it inherited the linear chromosomes of fixed length; and from genetic programming it inherited the expressive parse trees of varied sizes and shapes.

In gene expression programming the linear chromosomes work as the genotype and the parse trees as the phenotype, creating a genotype/phenotype system. This genotype/phenotype system is multigenic, thus encoding multiple parse trees in each chromosome. This means that the computer programs created by GEP are composed of multiple parse trees. Because these parse trees are the result of gene expression, in GEP they are called expression trees. Masood Nekoei, et al. utilized this expression programming style in ABC optimization to conduct ABCEP as a method that outperformed other evolutionary algorithms.ABCEP

==Encoding: the genotype==
The genome of gene expression programming consists of a linear, symbolic string or chromosome of fixed length composed of one or more genes of equal size. These genes, despite their fixed length, code for expression trees of different sizes and shapes. An example of a chromosome with two genes, each of size 9, is the string (position zero indicates the start of each gene):

:codice_1
:codice_2

where “L” represents the natural logarithm function and “a”, “b”, “c”, and “d” represent the variables and constants used in a problem.

==Expression trees: the phenotype==
As shown above, the genes of gene expression programming have all the same size. However, these fixed length strings code for expression trees of different sizes. This means that the size of the coding regions varies from gene to gene, allowing for adaptation and evolution to occur smoothly.

For example, the mathematical expression:
:formula_1
can also be represented as an expression tree:

where &quot;Q” represents the square root function.

This kind of expression tree consists of the phenotypic expression of GEP genes, whereas the genes are linear strings encoding these complex structures. For this particular example, the linear string corresponds to:

:codice_3
:codice_4

which is the straightforward reading of the expression tree from top to bottom and from left to right. These linear strings are called k-expressions (from Karva notation).

Going from k-expressions to expression trees is also very simple. For example, the following k-expression:

:codice_5
:codice_6

is composed of two different terminals (the variables “a” and “b”), two different functions of two arguments (“*” and “+”), and a function of one argument (“Q”). Its expression gives:

==K-expressions and genes==
The k-expressions of gene expression programming correspond to the region of genes that gets expressed. This means that there might be sequences in the genes that are not expressed, which is indeed true for most genes. The reason for these noncoding regions is to provide a buffer of terminals so that all k-expressions encoded in GEP genes correspond always to valid programs or expressions.

The genes of gene expression programming are therefore composed of two different domains – a head and a tail – each with different properties and functions. The head is used mainly to encode the functions and variables chosen to solve the problem at hand, whereas the tail, while also used to encode the variables, provides essentially a reservoir of terminals to ensure that all programs are error-free.

For GEP genes the length of the tail is given by the formula:

:formula_2

where &quot;h&quot; is the head&#x27;s length and &quot;n&quot;max is maximum arity. For example, for a gene created using the set of functions and the set of terminals T = {a, b}, &quot;n&quot;max = 2. And if we choose a head length of 15, then &quot;t&quot; = 15 (2–1) + 1 = 16, which gives a gene length &quot;g&quot; of 15 + 16 = 31. The randomly generated string below is an example of one such gene:

:codice_7
:codice_8

It encodes the expression tree:

which, in this case, only uses 8 of the 31 elements that constitute the gene.

It&#x27;s not hard to see that, despite their fixed length, each gene has the potential to code for expression trees of different sizes and shapes, with the simplest composed of only one node (when the first element of a gene is a terminal) and the largest composed of as many nodes as there are elements in the gene (when all the elements in the head are functions with maximum arity).

It&#x27;s also not hard to see that it is trivial to implement all kinds of genetic modification (mutation, inversion, insertion, recombination, and so on) with the guarantee that all resulting offspring encode correct, error-free programs.

==Multigenic chromosomes==
The chromosomes of gene expression programming are usually composed of more than one gene of equal length. Each gene codes for a sub-expression tree (sub-ET) or sub-program. Then the sub-ETs can interact with one another in different ways, forming a more complex program. The figure shows an example of a program composed of three sub-ETs.

In the final program the sub-ETs could be linked by addition or some other function, as there are no restrictions to the kind of linking function one might choose. Some examples of more complex linkers include taking the average, the median, the midrange, thresholding their sum to make a binomial classification, applying the sigmoid function to compute a probability, and so on. These linking functions are usually chosen a priori for each problem, but they can also be evolved elegantly and efficiently by the cellular system of gene expression programming.

==Cells and code reuse==
In gene expression programming, homeotic genes control the interactions of the different sub-ETs or modules of the main program. The expression of such genes results in different main programs or cells, that is, they determine which genes are expressed in each cell and how the sub-ETs of each cell interact with one another. In other words, homeotic genes determine which sub-ETs are called upon and how often in which main program or cell and what kind of connections they establish with one another.

===Homeotic genes and the cellular system===
Homeotic genes have exactly the same kind of structural organization as normal genes and they are built using an identical process. They also contain a head domain and a tail domain, with the difference that the heads contain now linking functions and a special kind of terminals – genic terminals – that represent the normal genes. The expression of the normal genes results as usual in different sub-ETs, which in the cellular system are called ADFs (automatically defined functions). As for the tails, they contain only genic terminals, that is, derived features generated on the fly by the algorithm.

For example, the chromosome in the figure has three normal genes and one homeotic gene and encodes a main program that invokes three different functions a total of four times, linking them in a particular way.

From this example it is clear that the cellular system not only allows the unconstrained evolution of linking functions but also code reuse. And it shouldn&#x27;t be hard to implement recursion in this system.

===Multiple main programs and multicellular systems===
Multicellular systems are composed of more than one homeotic gene. Each homeotic gene in this system puts together a different combination of sub-expression trees or ADFs, creating multiple cells or main programs.

For example, the program shown in the figure was created using a cellular system with two cells and three normal genes.

The applications of these multicellular systems are multiple and varied and, like the multigenic systems, they can be used both in problems with just one output and in problems with multiple outputs.

==Other levels of complexity==
The head/tail domain of GEP genes (both normal and homeotic) is the basic building block of all GEP algorithms. However, gene expression programming also explores other chromosomal organizations that are more complex than the head/tail structure. Essentially these complex structures consist of functional units or genes with a basic head/tail domain plus one or more extra domains. These extra domains usually encode random numerical constants that the algorithm relentlessly fine-tunes in order to find a good solution. For instance, these numerical constants may be the weights or factors in a function approximation problem (see the GEP-RNC algorithm below); they may be the weights and thresholds of a neural network (see the GEP-NN algorithm below); the numerical constants needed for the design of decision trees (see the GEP-DT algorithm below); the weights needed for polynomial induction; or the random numerical constants used to discover the parameter values in a parameter optimization task.

==The basic gene expression algorithm==
The fundamental steps of the basic gene expression algorithm are listed below in pseudocode:
# Select function set;
# Select terminal set;
# Load dataset for fitness evaluation;
# Create chromosomes of initial population randomly;
# For each program in population:
# Verify stop condition;
# Select programs;
# Replicate selected programs to form the next population;
# Modify chromosomes using genetic operators;
# Go to step 5.
The first four steps prepare all the ingredients that are needed for the iterative loop of the algorithm (steps 5 through 10). Of these preparative steps, the crucial one is the creation of the initial population, which is created randomly using the elements of the function and terminal sets.

===Populations of programs===
Like all evolutionary algorithms, gene expression programming works with populations of individuals, which in this case are computer programs. Therefore, some kind of initial population must be created to get things started. Subsequent populations are descendants, via selection and genetic modification, of the initial population.

In the genotype/phenotype system of gene expression programming, it is only necessary to create the simple linear chromosomes of the individuals without worrying about the structural soundness of the programs they code for, as their expression always results in syntactically correct programs.

===Fitness functions and the selection environment===
Fitness functions and selection environments (called training datasets in machine learning) are the two facets of fitness and are therefore intricately connected. Indeed, the fitness of a program depends not only on the cost function used to measure its performance but also on the training data chosen to evaluate fitness

====The selection environment or training data====
The selection environment consists of the set of training records, which are also called fitness cases. These fitness cases could be a set of observations or measurements concerning some problem, and they form what is called the training dataset.

The quality of the training data is essential for the evolution of good solutions. A good training set should be representative of the problem at hand and also well-balanced, otherwise the algorithm might get stuck at some local optimum. In addition, it is also important to avoid using unnecessarily large datasets for training as this will slow things down unnecessarily. A good rule of thumb is to choose enough records for training to enable a good generalization in the validation data and leave the remaining records for validation and testing.

====Fitness functions====
Broadly speaking, there are essentially three different kinds of problems based on the kind of prediction being made:
# Problems involving numeric (continuous) predictions;
# Problems involving categorical or nominal predictions, both binomial and multinomial;
# Problems involving binary or Boolean predictions.
The first type of problem goes by the name of regression; the second is known as classification, with logistic regression as a special case where, besides the crisp classifications like &quot;Yes&quot; or &quot;No&quot;, a probability is also attached to each outcome; and the last one is related to Boolean algebra and logic synthesis.

=====Fitness functions for regression=====
In regression, the response or dependent variable is numeric (usually continuous) and therefore the output of a regression model is also continuous. So it&#x27;s quite straightforward to evaluate the fitness of the evolving models by comparing the output of the model to the value of the response in the training data.

There are several basic fitness functions for evaluating model performance, with the most common being based on the error or residual between the model output and the actual value. Such functions include the mean squared error, root mean squared error, mean absolute error, relative squared error, root relative squared error, relative absolute error, and others.

All these standard measures offer a fine granularity or smoothness to the solution space and therefore work very well for most applications. But some problems might require a coarser evolution, such as determining if a prediction is within a certain interval, for instance less than 10% of the actual value. However, even if one is only interested in counting the hits (that is, a prediction that is within the chosen interval), making populations of models evolve based on just the number of hits each program scores is usually not very efficient due to the coarse granularity of the fitness landscape. Thus the solution usually involves combining these coarse measures with some kind of smooth function such as the standard error measures listed above.

Fitness functions based on the correlation coefficient and R-square are also very smooth. For regression problems, these functions work best by combining them with other measures because, by themselves, they only tend to measure correlation, not caring for the range of values of the model output. So by combining them with functions that work at approximating the range of the target values, they form very efficient fitness functions for finding models with good correlation and good fit between predicted and actual values.

=====Fitness functions for classification and logistic regression=====
The design of fitness functions for classification and logistic regression takes advantage of three different characteristics of classification models. The most obvious is just counting the hits, that is, if a record is classified correctly it is counted as a hit. This fitness function is very simple and works well for simple problems, but for more complex problems or datasets highly unbalanced it gives poor results.

One way to improve this type of hits-based fitness function consists of expanding the notion of correct and incorrect classifications. In a binary classification task, correct classifications can be 00 or 11. The &quot;00&quot; representation means that a negative case (represented by &quot;0”) was correctly classified, whereas the &quot;11&quot; means that a positive case (represented by &quot;1”) was correctly classified. Classifications of the type &quot;00&quot; are called true negatives (TN) and &quot;11&quot; true positives (TP).

There are also two types of incorrect classifications and they are represented by 01 and 10. They are called false positives (FP) when the actual value is 0 and the model predicts a 1; and false negatives (FN) when the target is 1 and the model predicts a 0. The counts of TP, TN, FP, and FN are usually kept on a table known as the confusion matrix.

So by counting the TP, TN, FP, and FN and further assigning different weights to these four types of classifications, it is possible to create smoother and therefore more efficient fitness functions. Some popular fitness functions based on the confusion matrix include sensitivity/specificity, recall/precision, F-measure, Jaccard similarity, Matthews correlation coefficient, and cost/gain matrix which combines the costs and gains assigned to the 4 different types of classifications.

These functions based on the confusion matrix are quite sophisticated and are adequate to solve most problems efficiently. But there is another dimension to classification models which is key to exploring more efficiently the solution space and therefore results in the discovery of better classifiers. This new dimension involves exploring the structure of the model itself, which includes not only the domain and range, but also the distribution of the model output and the classifier margin.

By exploring this other dimension of classification models and then combining the information about the model with the confusion matrix, it is possible to design very sophisticated fitness functions that allow the smooth exploration of the solution space. For instance, one can combine some measure based on the confusion matrix with the mean squared error evaluated between the raw model outputs and the actual values. Or combine the F-measure with the R-square evaluated for the raw model output and the target; or the cost/gain matrix with the correlation coefficient, and so on. More exotic fitness functions that explore model granularity include the area under the ROC curve and rank measure.

Also related to this new dimension of classification models, is the idea of assigning probabilities to the model output, which is what is done in logistic regression. Then it is also possible to use these probabilities and evaluate the mean squared error (or some other similar measure) between the probabilities and the actual values, then combine this with the confusion matrix to create very efficient fitness functions for logistic regression. Popular examples of fitness functions based on the probabilities include maximum likelihood estimation and hinge loss.

=====Fitness functions for Boolean problems=====
In logic there is no model structure (as defined above for classification and logistic regression) to explore: the domain and range of logical functions comprises only 0&#x27;s and 1&#x27;s or false and true. So, the fitness functions available for Boolean algebra can only be based on the hits or on the confusion matrix as explained in the section above.

===Selection and elitism===
Roulette-wheel selection is perhaps the most popular selection scheme used in evolutionary computation. It involves mapping the fitness of each program to a slice of the roulette wheel proportional to its fitness. Then the roulette is spun as many times as there are programs in the population in order to keep the population size constant. So, with roulette-wheel selection programs are selected both according to fitness and the luck of the draw, which means that some times the best traits might be lost. However, by combining roulette-wheel selection with the cloning of the best program of each generation, one guarantees that at least the very best traits are not lost. This technique of cloning the best-of-generation program is known as simple elitism and is used by most stochastic selection schemes.

===Reproduction with modification===
The reproduction of programs involves first the selection and then the reproduction of their genomes. Genome modification is not required for reproduction, but without it adaptation and evolution won&#x27;t take place.

====Replication and selection====
The selection operator selects the programs for the replication operator to copy. Depending on the selection scheme, the number of copies one program originates may vary, with some programs getting copied more than once while others are copied just once or not at all. In addition, selection is usually set up so that the population size remains constant from one generation to another.

The replication of genomes in nature is very complex and it took scientists a long time to discover the DNA double helix and propose a mechanism for its replication. But the replication of strings is trivial in artificial evolutionary systems, where only an instruction to copy strings is required to pass all the information in the genome from generation to generation.

The replication of the selected programs is a fundamental piece of all artificial evolutionary systems, but for evolution to occur it needs to be implemented not with the usual precision of a copy instruction, but rather with a few errors thrown in. Indeed, genetic diversity is created with genetic operators such as mutation, recombination, transposition, inversion, and many others.

====Mutation====
In gene expression programming mutation is the most important genetic operator. It changes genomes by changing an element by another. The accumulation of many small changes over time can create great diversity.

In gene expression programming mutation is totally unconstrained, which means that in each gene domain any domain symbol can be replaced by another. For example, in the heads of genes any function can be replaced by a terminal or another function, regardless of the number of arguments in this new function; and a terminal can be replaced by a function or another terminal.

====Recombination====
Recombination usually involves two parent chromosomes to create two new chromosomes by combining different parts from the parent chromosomes. And as long as the parent chromosomes are aligned and the exchanged fragments are homologous (that is, occupy the same position in the chromosome), the new chromosomes created by recombination will always encode syntactically correct programs.

Different kinds of crossover are easily implemented either by changing the number of parents involved (there&#x27;s no reason for choosing only two); the number of split points; or the way one chooses to exchange the fragments, for example, either randomly or in some orderly fashion. For example, gene recombination, which is a special case of recombination, can be done by exchanging homologous genes (genes that occupy the same position in the chromosome) or by exchanging genes chosen at random from any position in the chromosome.

====Transposition====
Transposition involves the introduction of an insertion sequence somewhere in a chromosome. In gene expression programming insertion sequences might appear anywhere in the chromosome, but they are only inserted in the heads of genes. This method guarantees that even insertion sequences from the tails result in error-free programs.

For transposition to work properly, it must preserve chromosome length and gene structure. So, in gene expression programming transposition can be implemented using two different methods: the first creates a shift at the insertion site, followed by a deletion at the end of the head; the second overwrites the local sequence at the target site and therefore is easier to implement. Both methods can be implemented to operate between chromosomes or within a chromosome or even within a single gene.

====Inversion====
Inversion is an interesting operator, especially powerful for combinatorial optimization. It consists of inverting a small sequence within a chromosome.

In gene expression programming it can be easily implemented in all gene domains and, in all cases, the offspring produced is always syntactically correct. For any gene domain, a sequence (ranging from at least two elements to as big as the domain itself) is chosen at random within that domain and then inverted.

====Other genetic operators====
Several other genetic operators exist and in gene expression programming, with its different genes and gene domains, the possibilities are endless. For example, genetic operators such as one-point recombination, two-point recombination, gene recombination, uniform recombination, gene transposition, root transposition, domain-specific mutation, domain-specific inversion, domain-specific transposition, and so on, are easily implemented and widely used.

==The GEP-RNC algorithm==
Numerical constants are essential elements of mathematical and statistical models and therefore it is important to allow their integration in the models designed by evolutionary algorithms.

Gene expression programming solves this problem very elegantly through the use of an extra gene domain – the Dc – for handling random numerical constants (RNC). By combining this domain with a special terminal placeholder for the RNCs, a richly expressive system can be created.

Structurally, the Dc comes after the tail, has a length equal to the size of the tail &quot;t&quot;, and is composed of the symbols used to represent the RNCs.

For example, below is shown a simple chromosome composed of only one gene a head size of 7 (the Dc stretches over positions 15–22):

:codice_9
:codice_10

where the terminal &quot;?” represents the placeholder for the RNCs. This kind of chromosome is expressed exactly as shown above, giving:

Then the ?&#x27;s in the expression tree are replaced from left to right and from top to bottom by the symbols (for simplicity represented by numerals) in the Dc, giving:

The values corresponding to these symbols are kept in an array. (For simplicity, the number represented by the numeral indicates the order in the array.) For instance, for the following 10 element array of RNCs:

:C = {0.611, 1.184, 2.449, 2.98, 0.496, 2.286, 0.93, 2.305, 2.737, 0.755}

the expression tree above gives:

This elegant structure for handling random numerical constants is at the heart of different GEP systems, such as GEP neural networks and GEP decision trees.

Like the basic gene expression algorithm, the GEP-RNC algorithm is also multigenic and its chromosomes are decoded as usual by expressing one gene after another and then linking them all together by the same kind of linking process.

The genetic operators used in the GEP-RNC system are an extension to the genetic operators of the basic GEP algorithm (see above), and they all can be straightforwardly implemented in these new chromosomes. On the other hand, the basic operators of mutation, inversion, transposition, and recombination are also used in the GEP-RNC algorithm. Furthermore, special Dc-specific operators such as mutation, inversion, and transposition, are also used to aid in a more efficient circulation of the RNCs among individual programs. In addition, there is also a special mutation operator that allows the permanent introduction of variation in the set of RNCs. The initial set of RNCs is randomly created at the beginning of a run, which means that, for each gene in the initial population, a specified number of numerical constants, chosen from a certain range, are randomly generated. Then their circulation and mutation is enabled by the genetic operators.

==Neural networks==
An artificial neural network (ANN or NN) is a computational device that consists of many simple connected units or neurons. The connections between the units are usually weighted by real-valued weights. These weights are the primary means of learning in neural networks and a learning algorithm is usually used to adjust them.

Structurally, a neural network has three different classes of units: input units, hidden units, and output units. An activation pattern is presented at the input units and then spreads in a forward direction from the input units through one or more layers of hidden units to the output units. The activation coming into one unit from other unit is multiplied by the weights on the links over which it spreads. All incoming activation is then added together and the unit becomes activated only if the incoming result is above the unit&#x27;s threshold.

In summary, the basic components of a neural network are the units, the connections between the units, the weights, and the thresholds. So, in order to fully simulate an artificial neural network one must somehow encode these components in a linear chromosome and then be able to express them in a meaningful way.

In GEP neural networks (GEP-NN or GEP nets), the network architecture is encoded in the usual structure of a head/tail domain. The head contains special functions/neurons that activate the hidden and output units (in the GEP context, all these units are more appropriately called functional units) and terminals that represent the input units. The tail, as usual, contains only terminals/input units.

Besides the head and the tail, these neural network genes contain two additional domains, Dw and Dt, for encoding the weights and thresholds of the neural network. Structurally, the Dw comes after the tail and its length &quot;dw&quot; depends on the head size &quot;h&quot; and maximum arity &quot;n&quot;max and is evaluated by the formula:

:formula_3

The Dt comes after Dw and has a length &quot;dt&quot; equal to &quot;t&quot;. Both domains are composed of symbols representing the weights and thresholds of the neural network.

For each NN-gene, the weights and thresholds are created at the beginning of each run, but their circulation and adaptation are guaranteed by the usual genetic operators of mutation, transposition, inversion, and recombination. In addition, special operators are also used to allow a constant flow of genetic variation in the set of weights and thresholds.

For example, below is shown a neural network with two input units (&quot;i&quot;1 and &quot;i&quot;2), two hidden units (&quot;h&quot;1 and &quot;h&quot;2), and one output unit (&quot;o&quot;1). It has a total of six connections with six corresponding weights represented by the numerals 1–6 (for simplicity, the thresholds are all equal to 1 and are omitted):

This representation is the canonical neural network representation, but neural networks can also be represented by a tree, which, in this case, corresponds to:

where &quot;a” and &quot;b” represent the two inputs &quot;i&quot;1 and &quot;i&quot;2 and &quot;D” represents a function with connectivity two. This function adds all its weighted arguments and then thresholds this activation in order to determine the forwarded output. This output (zero or one in this simple case) depends on the threshold of each unit, that is, if the total incoming activation is equal to or greater than the threshold, then the output is one, zero otherwise.

The above NN-tree can be linearized as follows:

:codice_11
:codice_12

where the structure in positions 7–12 (Dw) encodes the weights. The values of each weight are kept in an array and retrieved as necessary for expression.

As a more concrete example, below is shown a neural net gene for the exclusive-or problem. It has a head size of 3 and Dw size of 6:

:codice_11
:codice_14

Its expression results in the following neural network:

which, for the set of weights:

: &quot;W&quot; = {−1.978, 0.514, −0.465, 1.22, −1.686, −1.797, 0.197, 1.606, 0, 1.753}

it gives:

which is a perfect solution to the exclusive-or function.

Besides simple Boolean functions with binary inputs and binary outputs, the GEP-nets algorithm can handle all kinds of functions or neurons (linear neuron, tanh neuron, atan neuron, logistic neuron, limit neuron, radial basis and triangular basis neurons, all kinds of step neurons, and so on). Also interesting is that the GEP-nets algorithm can use all these neurons together and let evolution decide which ones work best to solve the problem at hand. So, GEP-nets can be used not only in Boolean problems but also in logistic regression, classification, and regression. In all cases, GEP-nets can be implemented not only with multigenic systems but also cellular systems, both unicellular and multicellular. Furthermore, multinomial classification problems can also be tackled in one go by GEP-nets both with multigenic systems and multicellular systems.

==Decision trees==
Decision trees (DT) are classification models where a series of questions and answers are mapped using nodes and directed edges.

Decision trees have three types of nodes: a root node, internal nodes, and leaf or terminal nodes. The root node and all internal nodes represent test conditions for different attributes or variables in a dataset. Leaf nodes specify the class label for all different paths in the tree.

Most decision tree induction algorithms involve selecting an attribute for the root node and then make the same kind of informed decision about all the nodes in a tree.

Decision trees can also be created by gene expression programming, with the advantage that all the decisions concerning the growth of the tree are made by the algorithm itself without any kind of human input.

There are basically two different types of DT algorithms: one for inducing decision trees with only nominal attributes and another for inducing decision trees with both numeric and nominal attributes. This aspect of decision tree induction also carries to gene expression programming and there are two GEP algorithms for decision tree induction: the evolvable decision trees (EDT) algorithm for dealing exclusively with nominal attributes and the EDT-RNC (EDT with random numerical constants) for handling both nominal and numeric attributes.

In the decision trees induced by gene expression programming, the attributes behave as function nodes in the basic gene expression algorithm, whereas the class labels behave as terminals. This means that attribute nodes have also associated with them a specific arity or number of branches that will determine their growth and, ultimately, the growth of the tree. Class labels behave like terminals, which means that for a &quot;k&quot;-class classification task, a terminal set with &quot;k&quot; terminals is used, representing the &quot;k&quot; different classes.

The rules for encoding a decision tree in a linear genome are very similar to the rules used to encode mathematical expressions (see above). So, for decision tree induction the genes also have a head and a tail, with the head containing attributes and terminals and the tail containing only terminals. This again ensures that all decision trees designed by GEP are always valid programs. Furthermore, the size of the tail &quot;t&quot; is also dictated by the head size &quot;h&quot; and the number of branches of the attribute with more branches &quot;n&quot;max and is evaluated by the equation:

:formula_4

For example, consider the decision tree below to decide whether to play outside:

It can be linearly encoded as:

:codice_3
:codice_16

where “H” represents the attribute Humidity, “O” the attribute Outlook, “W” represents Windy, and “a” and “b” the class labels &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; respectively. Note that the edges connecting the nodes are properties of the data, specifying the type and number of branches of each attribute, and therefore don&#x27;t have to be encoded.

The process of decision tree induction with gene expression programming starts, as usual, with an initial population of randomly created chromosomes. Then the chromosomes are expressed as decision trees and their fitness evaluated against a training dataset. According to fitness they are then selected to reproduce with modification. The genetic operators are exactly the same that are used in a conventional unigenic system, for example, mutation, inversion, transposition, and recombination.

Decision trees with both nominal and numeric attributes are also easily induced with gene expression programming using the framework described above for dealing with random numerical constants. The chromosomal architecture includes an extra domain for encoding random numerical constants, which are used as thresholds for splitting the data at each branching node. For example, the gene below with a head size of 5 (the Dc starts at position 16):

:codice_17
:codice_18

encodes the decision tree shown below:

In this system, every node in the head, irrespective of its type (numeric attribute, nominal attribute, or terminal), has associated with it a random numerical constant, which for simplicity in the example above is represented by a numeral 0–9. These random numerical constants are encoded in the Dc domain and their expression follows a very simple scheme: from top to bottom and from left to right, the elements in Dc are assigned one-by-one to the elements in the decision tree. So, for the following array of RNCs:

: &quot;C&quot; = {62, 51, 68, 83, 86, 41, 43, 44, 9, 67}

the decision tree above results in:

which can also be represented more colorfully as a conventional decision tree:

GEP has been criticized for not being a major improvement over other genetic programming techniques. In many experiments, it did not perform better than existing methods.

<text>Heinrich Georg Barkhausen (2 December 1881 – 20 February 1956) was a German physicist who established an influential research laboratory in Dresden. The phenomenon by which ferromagnetic domains align during magnetization and produce discrete acoustic changes due to rotations of the Weiss domains is named after his observations as the magnetic Barkhausen effect. He is also remembered in the Barkhausen criteria for electrical oscillators.

== Life and work ==
Barkhausen was the son of district judge in Bremen. He studied at Bremen Gymnasium and showed interest in natural sciences from an early age. He worked as a railway engineering trainee before going to study at the Technical University of Munich (1901), TU Berlin (1902) and University of Munich (1903) and Berlin and obtaining a doctorate at the University of Göttingen in 1907 with a thesis on the generation of oscillations. He then became a researcher in the Berlin laboratory of Siemens and Halske.

He became the first professor of electrical engineering at the Technische Hochschule Dresden in 1911 at the age of 29, thus obtaining the world&#x27;s first chair in this discipline. He became a significant teacher and conducted influential research. In 1919, he discovered the Barkhausen effect (named after him), which provided evidence for the magnetic domain theory of ferromagnetism. When the magnetic field through a piece of ferromagnetic material like iron is changing, the magnetization of the material changes in a series of tiny discontinuous jumps, which can be heard as a series of clicks in a loudspeaker attached to a coil of wire around the iron. It was later determined that these jumps were caused by the movement of the magnetic domains in the iron, as the domain walls snap past defects in the crystal lattice. The energy lost in these dissipative events is responsible for the shape of the hysteresis curve of iron and other ferromagnets. This effect is widely used in research, and physics education as a simple experiment to demonstrate the reality of magnetic domains. He proposed the use of the phon as a unit of loudness. He also wrote a four volume textbook on electron tubes, &quot;Lehrbuch der Elektronenröhren, Elektronenröhren und ihre technischen Anwendungen,&quot; which was influential.

In 1920, he invented the Barkhausen–Kurz oscillator, with Karl Kurz, the first vacuum tube electronic oscillator to use electron transit-time effects. It was the first vacuum tube oscillator that could operate at ultrahigh frequency, up to 300 MHz, and inspired later microwave transit-time tubes such as the klystron.

In 1921 he derived the first mathematical conditions for oscillation in electrical circuits, now called the Barkhausen stability criterion. They are widely used today in the design of electronic oscillators and general feedback amplifier circuits. 

In 1933 Barkhausen signed the &quot;Loyalty Oath of German Professors to Adolf Hitler and the National Socialist State&quot;. He received the Morris Liebmann Prize of the same year from the Institute of Radio Engineers. The Institute of High-Frequency and Electron-Tube Technology at Dresden survived through much of World War II until it was bombed on 13 February 1945. He returned to Dresden after the war and was involved in rebuilding the institute. The buildings continue to be called after him as the Barkhausenbau.

In 2000, Coyle&#x27;s big break arrived in the form of the character Jeff Murdock in the comedy &quot;Coupling&quot;. In 2003 he chose not to return to &quot;Coupling&quot; for its fourth series, and refused requests to return for a &quot;goodbye episode&quot;. In a 2005 interview, Coyle stated this was to avoid typecasting:

He also starred in the short-lived 2002–2003 BBC show &quot;Strange&quot;, and had roles in the films &quot;Human Traffic&quot;, &quot;Franklyn&quot;, and &quot;A Good Year&quot;. He appeared in the new special episode of &quot;Cracker: Nine Eleven&quot; in October 2006 (TV) and starred in &quot;The Whistleblowers&quot; on ITV.

<text>The People&#x27;s Army (AL; ; ) was a communist partisan force of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR) active in Occupied Poland during World War II from January to July 1944. It was created on the order of the Soviet-backed State National Council to fight against Nazi Germany and support the Red Army against the German forces in Poland.

The &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; was formed from the &quot;Gwardia Ludowa&quot; (&quot;People&#x27;s Guard&quot;) to aid the creation of a pro-Soviet communist government in Poland and, along with the National Armed Forces, refused to join the structures of the Polish Underground State and Home Army. It participated in a number of uprisings and supported Red Army offensives through Poland. The &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; became part of the new Polish People&#x27;s Army of the Soviet Polish Armed Forces in the East after seven months of existence.

The &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; was heroized in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic with its size and actions being exaggerated in propaganda in communist Poland. Since the fall of communism in Poland, the &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; has been classified as a Soviet partisan movement rather than part of the Polish resistance due to their close affiliation with the Soviet Union which &quot;de facto&quot; controlled it and its predecessors.

== Background ==
In September 1939, the Second Polish Republic was invaded by both Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union, one month after the signing of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. On 1 September, the Germans launched their invasion of Poland from the west, considered the beginning of World War II. On 17 September, the Soviets launched their own invasion of Poland from the east. There was no formal declaration of war by either side, but Polish forces were defeated within a month and forced the Polish state to operate in exile and underground. Poland itself was divided into spheres of influence and annexed by the two powers roughly along the Curzon Line. The Polish government-in-exile established in London maintained contacts with the Polish Underground State, its representatives in Occupied Poland. 

Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union in 1941, communist supporters in Poland, aided by Soviet advisers, had formed partisan units and created their own independent underground organization, whose aims were to support the Red Army against German forces. In 1943, following revelations about the Katyn massacre and the Polish government-in-exile&#x27;s insistence on investigation, the Soviet Union broke off diplomatic relations and intended to establish a competing government for Poland. Communist Polish partisans became increasingly involved in the creation of a pro-Soviet communist government in Poland. In 1942, the communist Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR) created the &quot;Gwardia Ludowa&quot; (GL, &quot;People&#x27;s Guard&quot;) as a paramilitary force. The PPR was the favoured party of the Soviets in Poland and received the bulk of its aid. Along with a portion of the National Armed Forces, this communist-led underground was one of the military resistance organizations in Poland that refused to join the structures of the Polish Underground State, and its military arm, the Home Army (&quot;Armia Krajowa&quot;).

== History ==
=== Creation ===
On 1 January 1944, the State National Council (&quot;Krajowa Rada Narodowa&quot;, &quot;KRN&quot;) replaced the &quot;Gwardia Ludowa&quot; with the People&#x27;s Army (&quot;Armia Ludowa&quot;). The KRN intended to gain volunteers from other groups. Upon its establishment, the organization comprised some 10,000 members. By the end of July 1944, when much of Poland had been occupied by the Red Army, there were some 20,000–30,000 members, with 5,000 of them being Soviet nationals. Lower estimates quote about 14,000 as its peak strength, whereas high estimates double the middle number, up to 50,000–60,000. About 6,000 of them were active full-time partisans while the remainder were reservists. Whatever its exact size, the &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; was much smaller than the Home Army, though it much better armed as a result of Soviet air drops; it might have even had a surplus of weaponry. It also had less strict discipline.

The commander of the Armia Ludowa was General Michał Rola-Żymierski, and the chief of staff was a member of the Central Committee of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party, Colonel Franciszek Jóźwiak.

=== Operations, propaganda and criticism ===

According to &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot;&#x27;s claims, it carried out about 900 operations, killing 20,000 Germans, derailing 350 trains, and destroying 79 bridges. However, these exploits were significantly exaggerated by communist propaganda in the People&#x27;s Republic of Poland. Historian Piotr Gontarczyk estimates that only about 5–10% of the actions really took place, and that most instances of fighting the German military were defending from German anti-partisan operations, with instances of attacking Germans on its own initiative being very rare. Rather than engaging military targets, it preferred softer targets such as German administration offices. That changed in 1944, when the GL/AL grew stronger and began engaging the German military more actively. According to the historian Mieczysław B. Biskupski, the &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; was less concerned with fighting the Germans than with fighting the Home Army. 

The &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; took part in the Warsaw Uprising, with official claims holding that some 1,800 of its soldiers fought there, but modern research suggests the actual number to have been about 500. Although well armed, it struggled with a much poorer support network than the Home Army, which was supported by the Polish Underground State. Soviet air drops did not supply foodstuffs, often leading partisans to resort to forced requisitions, which is described by modern historians as &quot;banditry&quot;. It often targeted mansions and churches, and there were also incidents of its soldiers murdering Jews or fighting among themselves. In one of its most secret and controversial actions, agents of the &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; on 17 February 1944 seized an important document archive of the Polish Underground State. Documents of importance to the communist activists were taken, and the remainder was turned over to a Gestapo agent, who had been duped into participating in the operation. Seven members of the Polish Underground State were taken prisoner by the Germans in a cleanup operation and likely executed soon afterward.

=== Polish People&#x27;s Army ===
On 21 July 1944, seven months after it came into existence, the &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; was integrated into the Polish Military in the USSR and formed the new People&#x27;s Army of Poland (&quot;Ludowe Wojsko Polskie&quot;, &quot;LWP&quot;). After the Red Army and the Soviet-organized 1st Polish Army entered Poland late in 1944 and early 1945, most People&#x27;s Army members joined the communist 1st Polish Army. After the war, many of its members joined the ranks of the Ministry of Public Security of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic, or the &quot;Milicja Obywatelska&quot;.

The &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; were hailed as heroes in the Polish People&#x27;s Republic and often the subject of early communist propaganda in Poland. State media exaggerated its size and role during the war, typically at the expense of the Home Army, who involvement was minimised and criticised. Although its size and actions were much smaller in number than the Home Army, propaganda espoused the myth that the reverse was the case. Since the fall of communism in Poland in 1989, the legacy of the &quot;Armia Ludowa&quot; has been reconsidered, mainly as its leadership took orders from the Soviet Union and represented Soviet, not Polish, interests. The Polish Institute of National Remembrance, in its official description of the &quot;Gwardia Ludowa&quot;/&quot;Armia Ludowa&quot;, goes so far as to declare the organisation as part of the Soviet partisans, rather than the Polish resistance.

<text>The refer to the three sacred mountains of Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan and Mount Yudono, which are clustered together in the ancient province of Dewa (modern-day Yamagata Prefecture). Holy to the Japanese Shinto religion and especially the mountain ascetic cult of Shugendo, Dewa Sanzan are a popular pilgrimage site visited by many, including famed haiku poet Matsuo Bashō.

The Haguro Five-story Pagoda is a recognised national treasure of Japan.

It has three subshrines
#Mount Gassan with Gassan Shrine
#Mount Haguro with Hagurosan Shrine
#Mount Yudono with Yudonosan Shrine

==History==
The Dewa Sanzan mountains are particularly noteworthy as having the oldest history of mountain worship in Japan. The mountains were first opened as a religious centre over 1400 years ago in 593 by prince Hachiko, who was the first-born son of Emperor Sushun, the 32nd emperor of Japan and reigning emperor at the time. Prince Hachiko arrived in Dewa province in 593 after fleeing the Soga clan upon the assassination of his father. He then devoted the rest of his life to religious pursuits, eventually enduring difficult ascetic exercises and a period of penance, which led to his worship of Haguro Gongen, the deity of the mountain. Following this, the prince began worship at the Gassan and Yudono mountains, which led to the enshrinement of all three deities at the temple located on the summit of Mount Haguro.

Following the establishment of the Dewa Sanzan mountains as a center of ascetic religious beliefs, many people began to make yearly pilgrimages to the mountains to pay reverence, even arduously trekking thousands of miles to visit the shrines during the summer months. These pilgrimages held significance to many religions and the mountains served as a place of learning for various belief systems, but were most particularly important to &quot;shugendō&quot;. Several notable individuals made this pilgrimage to the Dewa Sanzan to include En no Gyōja, the founder of &quot;shugendō&quot; asceticism, as well as Kūkai, the founder of the Shingon Sect.

Following the Meiji Restoration in 1868, the Japanese government dissolved the pattern of Shintō-Buddhist amalgamation and Shintō was selected as the official state religion. &quot;Shugendō&quot; was adversely affected by this split and many &quot;shugendō&quot; priests returned to a secular life. Following the end of World War II however, &quot;shugendō&quot; was allowed to enjoy a status as a minor religious group. These changes in religious association also altered the designation of the shrines located on the Dewa Sanzan. In the Empire of Japan, Hagurosan Shrine and Yudonosan Shrine were designated as kokuhei shosha, while Gassan Shrine on Mount Gassan was considered a kanpei taisha. Today all three are considered equal Beppyo shrines

==Significance in Japanese religion==
Folk religion has continued throughout the ages to be a standard part of the daily lives of the Japanese people, particularly the aspect of the association between religious beliefs and practices with sacred mountains. This practice of mountain worship holds a significant place in Japanese beliefs and had become widespread throughout Japan’s history. It has been observed that nearly every high mountain top has had its own dedicated shrine at one point, with some receiving pilgrimages every year from thousands of worshippers. This collection of diverse phenomena linking religious activities and beliefs with sacred mountains is referred to as &quot;sangaku shinkō&quot;. 

The Dewa Sanzan are very holy to both the religions of Shintō and Buddhism, but in particular are very significant and sacred to the &quot;shugendō&quot; religious system of beliefs, as they represent great spiritual significance. Mount Haguro, Mount Gassan, and Mount Yudono each have their own shrine, though the primary shrine itself, Dewa Shrine, is located at the summit of Mount Haguro. The primary shrine is unique in that it venerates all three sacred mountains.

Every year, mountain ascetic devotees known as &quot;yamabushi&quot; - which are laymen practitioners of shugendo - pay reverence to the Dewa Sanzan. Mount Haguro is significant in this role as it serves as the entryway to Mount Gassan and Mount Yudono. 

Though Mount Haguro is the smallest of the three mountains, it is the only mountain of Dewa that is accessible all throughout the year, as heavy snowfall prohibits pilgrimage to the other two mountains of Dewa during the winter months. It is the most well known of the three mountains of Dewa both locally and internationally, as it serves as the location of the Haguro Five-story Pagoda, one of Japan&#x27;s national treasures.

Mount Gassan is the tallest of the three sacred mountains and is well known for its natural scenery and beauty, as it plays host to a variety of rare alpine plants and other marsh vegetation. The hiking path on Mt. Gassan leads all the way to its peak, the second highest point in the Shonai Region of Japan. Due to heavy snow however, it is often only accessible during late spring to the early fall. 

Mount Yudono is viewed as being the heart of the three sacred mountains and is considered the most holy of ascetic disciplinary practice grounds. Many ascetics and yamabushi believe they have not completed their pilgrimage, and thus entered the holy land, until they have reached Mount Yudono. Mount Yudono is famous for its &quot;goshintai&quot;, a sacred object believed to be directly connected to a god. The shrine on Yudono is also revered as hallowed land which must be kept secret, and even today, photography and video recordings are prohibited.

<doc id="1098852" wikidata="Q958768" url="?curid=1098852" title="Rufio">
<text>Rufio was an American rock band from Rancho Cucamonga, California, United States, in 2000. They released four studio albums: &quot;Perhaps, I Suppose&quot; (2001); &quot;MCMLXXXV&quot; (2003); &quot;The Comfort of Home&quot; (2005); and&quot; Anybody Out There&quot; (2010).

==History==
Rufio was formed when bassist Jon Berry was a freshman in college and the other three members, Scott Sellers, Mike Jimenez, and Clark Domae were in high school. Sellers and Domae had been acquainted for some time and found a shared talent in the guitar. Sellers met Berry and they began playing together in various groups and sessions. Around the same time, the two purchased a 4-track to record the songs they were writing. After Berry and Sellers began recording, they asked Jimenez to listen to their recordings and play drums with them. Domae joined shortly after and completed the official lineup. The band took their name from the character Rufio, leader of the Lost Boys in the absence of Peter Pan in the 1991 film &quot;Hook&quot;.

Rufio released its debut record, &quot;Perhaps, I Suppose...&quot;, in 2001 on The Militia Group label. In November 2001, the band signed to Nitro Records. In November and December 2002, the band supported the Ataris on their headlining US tour. Rufio released their self-titled EP through Nitro on February 25, 2003. &quot;MCMLXXXV&quot; was released on June 17, 2003, which was recorded with producer Nick Raskulinecz. Rufio went on to play on the Warped Tour that summer. In November, the band went on a US tour with Less Than Jake. In April and May 2004, the band went on the headlining US tour, with support from Senses Fail, Autopilot Off, and Don&#x27;t Look Down. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Comfort of Home&quot;, was released in July 2005. The band embarked on a tour that fall, with MxPx and Relient K.

In late January 2006, Berry and Jimenez left Rufio, citing creative differences. Following the loss of two members, the band pulled out of their tour with No Use for a Name. While no official statement had then been made regarding a breakup, in a 2006 interview, No Use for a Name acknowledged as much.

Since leaving Rufio, Jimenez formed a new band called Science Fiction Theater. Sellers and Domae started a band called BigCity.

On April 5, 2007, the band announced on their MySpace page that they were to play an official farewell show on June 1, 2007, at The Glass House in Pomona, California, followed by a South American tour. The statement in full read:

&quot;Farewell show and South American tour.

well... it&#x27;s been a while friends... and we&#x27;ve finally decided that its time to do an official farewell show with all the members of Rufio on June 1. We thought it would be a good way to show our appreciation to all our hometown friends and fans who have supported us from the very beginning. We figured the Glasshouse would be a very appropriate venue to host the show and we hope to see ALLLL of you there! we&#x27;ll be playing a variety of songs, and even oldies we rarely play! It&#x27;s going to be a sad night but it also means the birth of new projects and new music!

<doc id="1098863" wikidata="Q2008820" url="?curid=1098863" title="Battle of Fidonisi">
<text>The naval Battle of Fidonisi took place on 14 July 1788 (NS) between the fleets of the Russian Empire under Marko Voinovich&#x27;s lead and the Ottoman Empire under Cezayirli Hasan Pasha during the Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792) in the area of Snake Island, which in Greek was called Fidonisi (Φιδονήσι). It was a Russian victory.

==Events==
On 10 July, the Turkish fleet under Kapudan Pasha (Grand Admiral) Hasan Pasha was seen to the NW by the Russian fleet, which had left Sevastopol under Rear-Admiral Count Voinovich (Voynovich), on 29 June, and had reached Tendra on 10 July. After three days of manoeuvering or lying becalmed in sight of one another, the fleets found themselves near the island of Fidonisi, about 100 miles south of Kinburn.

Voynovich formed a line on the port tack NE and then SE as the wind veered. The Turks bore up and attacked from windward just after 3 pm. The leading Russian ships, the frigates &quot;Berislav&quot; and &quot;Stryela&quot;, forced the leading Turks out of line, but were in danger of being cut off until the Russian second-in-command Fyodor Ushakov aboard &quot;Sv. Pavel&quot; closed the gap.

Hasan Pasha then attacked the leading Russian ships, while his Vice- and Rear-Admirals attacked Voynovich, but his ship damaged, Hasan himself had to leave the line and just before 5 pm the Turks withdrew.

The battle of Fidosini demonstrated Ushakov&#x27;s high tactical abilities. The Ottoman fleet, using the advantage of speed, moved south. They had lost 1 xebec, which was sunk.

Between 15 and 17 July, the Russian and Turkish fleets manoeuvered to the west of the Crimea; on 18 July, the Turks had disappeared. They sailed back to Ochakov but made no attack.

<doc id="1098869" wikidata="Q1079489" url="?curid=1098869" title="Division of Grayndler">
<text>The Division of Grayndler is an Australian electoral division in the state of New South Wales. It is currently represented by Prime Minister of Australia and Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Anthony Albanese.

Grayndler covers most of Sydney&#x27;s newly formed Inner West Council. The electorate includes the suburbs of Balmain, Birchgrove, Rozelle, Leichhardt, Lilyfield, Petersham, Lewisham, Enmore, Haberfield, Summer Hill and parts of Newtown, Ashfield, Dulwich Hill and Marrickville.

The current MP is Anthony Albanese, the Prime Minister of Australia and the Leader of the Australian Labor Party.

==History==
The division was created in 1949 and is named for Ted Grayndler (1867–1943), a Member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 1921 to 1934 and 1936 to 1943, and General Secretary of the Australian Workers&#x27; Union from 1912 to 1941. The division was originally a solidly working-class area, although migration and gentrification have since radically changed its demography. Despite the demographic changes, it has been held by the Australian Labor Party for its entire existence; the Liberals have only once received 40 percent of the two-party vote. Grayndler also has a very high percentage of Australian Greens voters with 23 percent of the primary vote at the 2013 election. At the 2010 election, the two-party-preferred vote was between Labor and the Greens, one of only 3 in Australia (the others being Batman and the Greens held Melbourne).

Its most prominent members have been Fred Daly, who was a minister in the Whitlam government, Leo McLeay, who was Speaker of the House 1989–93, and Anthony Albanese, the present member for the seat. Albanese was a minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments, Deputy Prime Minister for three months in 2013, and is currently the leader of the Labor Party (since 2019) and Prime Minister of Australia (since 2022).

Daly was succeeded by Tony Whitlam at the 1975 election, the election that Whitlam&#x27;s father and Labor Party leader Gough Whitlam had lost. The younger Whitlam served only one term before losing preselection to Frank Stewart, who transferred from the abolished neighbouring Division of Lang. Stewart died in office in 1979 and the seat was won by McLeay in the subsequent by-election.

When Transport Minister Graham Richardson was briefly forced out of cabinet due to the Marshall Islands affair before the 1993 election, Albanese, who was a left-wing power-broker in the party, arranged for fellow left-winger Jeannette McHugh to be promoted to the ministry. McHugh&#x27;s seat of Phillip was due to be abolished in the election. Being a minister allowed her to be entitled to a seat, so she transferred to Grayndler. This forced McLeay to transfer from Grayndler to Watson. McHugh retired in 1996 and handed the seat to Albanese, who still holds it today.

==Boundaries==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

At , it is Australia&#x27;s smallest electorate, located in the inner-southern Sydney metropolitan area, including parts of the inner-west. The electorate includes the suburbs of Balmain, Balmain East, Birchgrove, Dobroyd Point, Enmore, Haberfield, Leichhardt, Lewisham, Lilyfield, Petersham, Rodd Island, Rozelle, and Sydenham; as well as parts of Annandale, Ashfield, Camperdown, Canterbury, Cockatoo Island, Drummoyne, Dulwich Hill, Hurlstone Park, Macdonaldtown, Marrickville, Newtown, Spectacle Island, St Peters, Stanmore and Summer Hill.

<text>Point Pleasant is a small unincorporated community in southern Monroe Township, Clermont County, Ohio, United States. It is located on the Ohio River, around southeast of Cincinnati. U.S. Route 52 passes through Point Pleasant, where it intersects State Route 232.

==History==
Point Pleasant was platted in 1813. A post office called Point Pleasant that was established in 1826 remained in operation until 1983. By 1833, Point Pleasant had about 130 inhabitants. The Ohio River flood of 1937 inundated the community.

Point Pleasant is the birthplace of U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant. The one-story cottage where he was born was taken by barge on a tour across the country, then by rail to Columbus, Ohio, where it was displayed at the Ohio State Fairgrounds. It was returned to Point Pleasant in 1936, where it has been restored with period furniture and opened to tours.

<text>Jaime Benito Fuster Berlingeri (January 12, 1941 – December 3, 2007) was a politician who served as an Associate Justice to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. Justice Fuster, along with Justice Liana Fiol Matta, was considered the leading liberal voice in the Puerto Rico Supreme Court.

==Education==
He obtained his Bachelor&#x27;s Degree from the University of Notre Dame in 1962 and his Law Degree form the University of Puerto Rico School of Law in 1965. He later obtained a Master&#x27;s Degree in Law from Columbia Law School in 1966. He then received a fellowship in law and humanities at Harvard University. In 1985, he received a Doctorate, &quot;Honoris Causa&quot;, from Temple University.

==Political career==
In 1979, Fuster was named Deputy Assistant Attorney General of the United States. He held that position until 1981. In 1984, he was elected Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico to the United States Congress. During his tenure (1985–1992), he served a term as Chair of Congressional Hispanic Caucus. In both terms, he served on the Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, and on the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs. In Congress, he was a strong advocate for educational and youth programs. He supported numerous laws and bills to give state and local governments assistance for youth service projects and programs aimed at preventing substance use. He also supported the establishment of a Children, Youth, and Families Administration, as well as the establishment of a federal child care program. He sponsored legislation to increase social security funds for families with blind, aged, and disabled dependents.

In 1992, Governor Rafael Hernández Colón appointed him to the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. Fuster resigned from his Resident Commissioner position on March 4, 1992 to take an appointment as associate justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. He took the oath of office on March 4, 1992 after confirmation by the Senate, serving on the Court until his death.

Fuster was affiliated with the Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico and the Democratic Party of the United States.

==Death==
Fuster died during the early hours of December 3, 2007 from cardiac arrest. He was buried at Buxeda Memorial Park Cemetery in Río Piedras, Puerto Rico. His death left the Supreme Court in an unprecedented position with two seats vacant.

<doc id="1098884" wikidata="Q72454" url="?curid=1098884" title="Battle of Kerch Strait (1790)">
<text>The naval Battle of (the) Kerch Strait (also known as &quot;Battle of Yenikale&quot;, by the old Turkish name of the strait near Kerch) took place on 19 July 1790 near Kerch, Crimea, was a victory for Imperial Russia over the Ottoman Empire during the Russo-Turkish War, 1787-1792.

==Battle==
The Russian fleet, under Ushakov, sailed from Sevastopol on 13 July 1790 for the southern Crimea, after hearing a report that the Ottoman fleet had been sighted there. On 19 July it anchored at the mouth of the Kerch Strait and sent privateers out in search of the Ottomans. At 10 am they reported a sighting and 30 minutes later the Ottoman fleet came into view from the east. With the wind from the ENE, Ushakov formed a line on the port tack (i.e. south-east). The Ottomans turned from their group formation and formed a parallel line to the east of the Russian line. Seeing that the Ottoman battle-line contained just their battleships, Ushakov sent 6 frigates to form a second line to leeward of the main line, and between about 12pm and 3pm, 3 hours of indecisive longish-range fighting followed, but then the wind changed direction to NNE and the Russians luffed, turning toward the Ottoman line. The Ottomans reversed course, 2 of their ships colliding as they did so, because some ships turned left and others turned right. As the Russians steered toward the tail-end of the Ottomans line, and with the wind from the north, the Ottoman admiral steered away, to the SW. At about 7pm firing ceased. The Russians followed all night, but by morning, the faster ships of the Ottomans were out of sight. Russian casualties were 29 killed and 68 wounded, with very little damage to ships. The Russian victory prevented the Ottoman Empire from achieving its goal in landing an army in Crimea.

<doc id="1098889" wikidata="Q2345308" url="?curid=1098889" title="Richard Rolle">
<text>Richard Rolle ( – 30 September 1349) was an English hermit, mystic, and religious writer. He is also known as Richard Rolle of Hampole or de Hampole, since at the end of his life he lived near a Cistercian nunnery in Hampole, now in South Yorkshire. In many ways, he can be considered the first English author, insofar as his vernacular works were widely considered to have considerable religious authority and influence (both locally and internationally) soon after his death, and for centuries afterwards.

==Early life==
In his works, Rolle provides little explicit evidence about his early life and education. Most, if not all, of our information about him comes from the Office of Lessons and Antiphons that was composed in the 1380s in preparation for his canonisation, although this never came about.

Born into a small farming family and brought up at Thornton-le-Dale near Pickering, he studied at the University of Oxford where he was sponsored by Thomas de Neville, the Archdeacon of Durham. While there, he is said to have been more interested in theology and biblical studies than philosophy and secular studies. He is also described as possessing a fiery temperament. Richard left Oxford at age eighteen or nineteen—dropping out before he received his MA—to become a hermit.

At first Richard chose to live as a recluse in a forest at Thornton but he soon left, fearing his family would restrain his life of solitude. Leaving the family home, he went to Pickering and housed with a squire, John Dalton, for perhaps three years. John had known Richard in Oxford when the two were students. During this time Richard&#x27;s sister met with him in the woods, and gave him two of her own gowns which he fashioned into a hermit&#x27;s robe and mantle. She then fled, the legend claims, crying that her brother had gone insane.

==Mystical Experiences==
It was probably while still living with Dalton, two years and eight months after becoming a hermit, Rolle had his first mystical experience. Around a year later, he felt similarly after listening to a choir, and he began to take less interest in all things temporal.

Dalton himself was arrested and his lands confiscated in 1322; the lack of mention of this fact in accounts of Rolle&#x27;s life makes it likely that he was no longer living with Dalton by this point.

It is unclear where Rolle lived from 1321/2 until his death in 1349. One theory is that Rolle spent the early 1320s at the renowned Sorbonne, becoming well-trained in theology, and perhaps being ordained there. This theory is based on the entries in three seventeenth-century manuscripts at the Sorbonne, assumed to be copies of medieval originals, which record a Ricardus de Hampole as being admitted to the Sorbonne in 1320, entering the prior&#x27;s register in 1326, and noting that he died in 1349 among the sisters of Hampole near Doncaster in Yorkshire. Scholars, however, are divided on the authenticity of this material. Whether or not Rolle studied in Paris, it is probable that most if not all of this time was spent in Richmondshire, either living with his family at Yafforth, or, given the uncertain political conditions in the region at the time, wandering from patron to patron.

==Rolle&#x27;s Disciples==
Around 1348, Rolle knew the Yorkshire anchoress Margaret Kirkby, who was his principal disciple and the recipient of much of his writings and would be important in establishing his later reputation.

==Death==
Rolle died in Michaelmas 1349 at the Cistercian nunnery at Hampole. Because of his time spent there, he is sometimes known as Richard Rolle of Hampole, or de Hampole. It is not known what his role there was. However he wrote &quot;The Form of Living&quot; and his English Psalter for a nun there, Margaret Kirkby (who later took up a similar life to Rolle, as an anchoress), and &quot;Ego Dormio&quot; for a nun at Yedingham. It is possible that he died of the Black Death, but there is no direct evidence for this. He was buried first in the nuns&#x27; cemetery at Hampole. Later records of people making offerings of candles at his shrine show that he was moved first to the chancel and then to his own chapel.

==Works==
Rolle probably began writing in the early 1330s, and continued until his death – but there is no certain chronology of his various works. He wrote in both Latin and English, with his English works apparently all dating from after c. 1340.

The precise dating of Rolle&#x27;s works is a matter of much modern dispute. The dates set out by Hope Emily Allen in 1927 have been widely used by later writers, but in 1991 Nicholas Watson set out a rather different vision of the chronology of Rolle&#x27;s writing.

In one of his best-known works, &quot;Incendium Amoris&quot; (&quot;The Fire of Love&quot;), Rolle provides an account of his mystical experiences, which he describes as being of three kinds: a physical warmth in his body, a sense of wonderful sweetness, and a heavenly music that accompanied him as he chanted the Psalms. The book was widely read in the Middle Ages, and described the four purgative stages that one had to go through to become closer to God: described as open door, heat, song, and sweetness. This was part of an important movement in medieval Christianity, in which the feeling of God&#x27;s presence became central to devotional practice; Rolle is a key figure in the development of affective mysticism. Similarly, as Andrew Kraebel has demonstrated, Rolle claims that his extensive commentary on scripture (in both Latin and the vernacular) is divinely inspired, giving his works an authority beyond that of the purely interpretive and academic (even as he drew on a wide range of Biblical scholarship).

His last work was probably the English &quot;The Form of Living&quot;, written in autumn 1348 at the earliest. It is addressed to Margaret Kirkby, who entered her enclosure as a recluse on 12 December 1348, and is a vernacular guide for her life as an anchorite.

His works are often classified into commentaries, treatises and epistles. As such, the commentaries are:
* &quot;Commentary on the Readings in the Office of the Dead taken from Job&quot;. This commentary on nine readings from the Book of Job which form part of the readings for the office of the dead was used extensively by York clergy in the fifteenth century. Surviving in forty-two manuscripts, it was the first of Rolle&#x27;s works to be printed, in Oxford in 1483. A critical edition by Andrew Kraebel is forthcoming.
* &quot;Commentary on the Canticles&quot;, a commentary on the first two and a half verses of the Song of Songs. It survives in thirty manuscripts.
* Two &quot;Commentaries on the Psalter&quot;. One is in Latin, and may belong to the very early period after Rolle left Oxford. The second is an English commentary with translation of the Latin Psalms into English, which was designed to help Margaret Kirkby to understand the doctrines behind the Psalms she was to chant in her anchorage. For nearly 200 years after the Constitutions of Arundel this commentary and translation remained the only authorised vernacular rendering of a portion of the Bible into English; it did not need diocesan permission for its use. It exists in about 20 manuscripts.
* &quot;Treatise on Psalm 20&quot;, in Latin
* &quot;Super Threnos&quot;, a commentary on the Lamentations of Jeremiah
* &quot;Commentary on the Apocalypse&quot;, on the first six chapters of the Book of Revelation
* Other commentaries on the Lord&#x27;s Prayer, the Magnificat and the Apostles&#x27; Creed
* An English explication of the Ten Commandments
* &quot;Super Mulierem Fortem&quot;, a comment on Proverbs 31:10

Other works include:
* Two English &quot;Meditations on the Passion&quot;
* &quot;Judica me Deus&quot;, probably his first work, written around 1330. This survives in four versions, and is an &quot;apologia&quot; for his hermit lifestyle, making use of the pastoral manual of a fellow Yorkshireman, William of Pagula.
* &quot;Contra Amatores Mundi&quot; (&quot;Against the Lovers of the World&quot;), which survives in 42 manuscripts.
* &quot;Incendium Amoris&quot; (&quot;The Fire of Love&quot;), written before 1343 (the date of Rolle&#x27;s marginal note), which survives in 44 manuscripts (15 from the Continent) and one Middle English translation.
* &quot;Melos Amoris&quot; (or &quot;Melum Contemplativorum&quot;) (&quot;The Melody of Love&quot;), which survives in 10 manuscripts.
* &quot;The Form of Living&quot;, his last work, which survives in 30 manuscripts. It contains 12 chapters and was written at Hampole for Margaret Kirkby when she was living in a cell in Richmondshire.

Three letters survive. All are addressed to single recipients, and contain much similar material:
* &quot;Emendatio Vitae&quot; (&quot;Emending of Life&quot;). This was the most popular work of Rolle, with 110 manuscripts (17 from the Continent), and seven independent Middle English translations.
* &quot;Ego Dormio&quot;, a Middle English prosimetrum, one of two letters written for nuns. (the title comes from the incipit of the work, and is from Song of Songs 5.2)
* &quot;The Commandment&quot;, one of two letters written for nuns.

Works once thought to be Rolle&#x27;s:
* While the most popular poem in Middle English, &quot;The Pricke of Conscience&quot;, was once attributed to him, it is now known to have been written by an anonymous Yorkshire author in the 14th century.
* It is now thought that &quot;De Dei Misericordia&quot;, a comment on Psalm 88:2, was written by John Waldeby in the later fourteenth century.

==Later reputation and veneration==
Richard Rolle inspired a flourishing cult, especially in the north of England, which was still active at the time of the English Reformation. Part of this may have been due to the efforts of Margaret Kirkby, who moved to the priory, probably between 1381 and 1383, to be near the body of her master, Rolle. Margaret may have spent the last 10 years of her life here, and between 1381 and 1383 a liturgical office for Rolle, including a great deal of biographical information about him, was written; it likely includes stories about him remembered by older members of the community.

Rolle&#x27;s works were widely read in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, more so even than Chaucer. In the words of Nicholas Watson, scholarly research has shown that &quot;[d]uring the fifteenth century he was one of the most widely read of English writers, whose works survive in nearly four hundred English ... and at least seventy Continental manuscripts, almost all written between 1390 and 1500.&quot; Works of his survive in about 470 manuscripts written between 1390 and 1500, and in 10 sixteenth- and early-seventeenth-century printed editions (including the sixteenth-century edition by Wynkyn de Worde). In some manuscripts, Rolle&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the Psalter&quot; is interpolated with Lollard teaching, providing indications of one group who read his work. Rolle&#x27;s work was not uncontroversial. He was criticised by Walter Hilton and the author of &quot;The Cloud of Unknowing&quot;; a defence of Rolle&#x27;s work was written by the hermit Thomas Basset in the late fourteenth century against the attack of an unnamed Carthusian. He was defended by various religious figures, however (one of whom compared his accounts of mystical experience to those of the German Henry Suso), and the &quot;Incendium Amoris&quot; or &quot;Fire of Love&quot; is mentioned as one of the books Margery Kempe had a priest read aloud to her to increase her devotion.

The shrine and priory at his burial place of Hampole was dissolved on 19 November 1539. The remains can be seen in an old schoolhouse in Hampole.

Rolle is remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 20 January and in the Episcopal Church (USA) together with Walter Hilton and Margery Kempe on 9 November. He is also venerated as a blessed by the Catholic Church on 29 September, however his cult is little known outside England.

<doc id="1098893" wikidata="Q919913" url="?curid=1098893" title="Mohamed Bacar">
<text>Colonel Mohamed Bacar (born May 5, 1962 in Barakani, Anjouan, then a French colony) is a Comorian former politician who was President of Anjouan, one of the three autonomous islands that make up the Union of the Comoros, from 2001 to 2008. He is a former chief of police on Anjouan and has studied extensively in France and the United States. He was part of a military coup on Anjouan in August 2001 and soon became president. It is alleged he rigged the elections to become the first president of Anjouan in March 2002, in part due to his leading role in the separatist movement. He was ousted by the combined forces of the Government of the Union of Comoros and the African Union in the March 2008 invasion of Anjouan.

==Presidency disputed==
On April 26, 2007, the country&#x27;s Federal Constitutional Court proclaimed the Presidency of Anjouan vacant, declaring Bacar&#x27;s period in office after his first term ended on April 14 to be illegal. Two days later, Comorian President Ahmed Abdallah Sambi, with the support of the African Union (AU), appointed M. Dhoihirou Halidi as interim President of Anjouan. However, he was never allowed to take office and Bacar, in defiance of both the Union of Comoros government and the AU, independently organised a presidential election. The Union government withheld election material from Anjouan to try and prevent the poll from taking place, but Bacar printed his own ballot papers, went ahead with the vote on 10 June and claimed a landslide victory of 90 percent. He was inaugurated for a second term as the President of Anjouan on 14 June.

Both the AU and the Union government said if an election were held on Anjouan it would be declared &quot;illegal&quot;. Bacar&#x27;s inauguration ceremony deepened the electoral crisis, making it highly unlikely that the official Anjouan poll, postponed to 17 June, would be held.

In his inauguration speech, Bacar declared himself &quot;the president of all Anjouan&quot; and appealed to the Union government &quot;not to throw oil onto the fire&quot;.

France, the country&#x27;s former colonial power, expressed its support for the Union government and the AU stance against Bacar in a statement released on 15 June, and noted that the 10 June election was only the first round in the presidential elections, with the second round scheduled for 24 June.

The statement urged Bacar to respect the 17 June date for holding Anjouan&#x27;s official election, and allow it to be supervised by AU troops and monitored by international observers.

Since this time the situation had deteriorated markedly and the government of Comoros determined that talks had failed and a military solution was required. During February and March 2008 troops from the Comoros with support from the African Union began massing for an amphibious assault of the island of Anjouan and the termination of the presidency of Mohamed Bacar. Agence France-Presse reported that &#x27;the first batch&#x27; of African Union troops arrived in the Comoros Islands on March 20, 2008,
while the BBC reported that the first African Union troops arrived on March 11, 2008.

In an interview with Agence France-Presse on March 12, 2008, Bacar said that he had &quot;always been open to dialogue&quot; and that there should be a round table to discuss Comoran problems. He said that holding a new election in Anjouan would be acceptable if a round table was in favor of it. According to Bacar, some of the countries backing military intervention are undemocratic themselves, and it was hypocritical for them to try to &quot;give [Anjouan] lessons in democracy&quot;; he said that an invasion would ultimately solve nothing and that he was ready to fight and die if necessary.

==Removal from office==
A tense period punctuated by several incidents of military incursions on Anjouan continued from the beginning of March with notable events including an abortive Comoron raid on Domoni in the south of the island, the seizure of two Anjouan soldiers on the coast close to Sima and the crash of a French military helicopter also near Sima. The end came when, in the early hours of March 25, the island was invaded by a combined Comoros and African Union force. The island&#x27;s capital, airport, seaport and second city were all overrun by dawn to scenes of jubilation from the local population. Early reports indicated that the government of Mohamed Bacar had fled to the interior of the island and were in hiding; however, later reports from the Comoros government on March 25 stated that Bacar had fled the island incognito seeking exile in Mayotte:

&quot;Colonel Mohamed Bacar has been spotted in the village of Sadanpoini where he is heading without doubt for a place to flee on board a kwassa (small canoe) towards Mayotte island, it seems, according to various sources, that he is dressed as a woman.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
- Abdourahim Said Bacar, Comoran government spokesman.

Soon afterwards, the French government confirmed that Bacar had fled to Mayotte. He requested that France grant him political asylum, and the French government said that it was considering the request. The Comoran government asked France to hand him over so that it could put him on trial; it had issued an international arrest warrant for Bacar. Subsequently, the French moved Bacar to the nearby island of Réunion on the night of March 27–28, along with 23 of his supporters who accompanied him when he fled to Mayotte. It was thought that he would be charged on Réunion with weapons possession and illegal entry due to his arrival on Mayotte by speedboat. Comoran President Ahmed Abdallah Sambi said that if the French objected to extraditing Bacar to Comoros, where the death penalty is allowed, then it could send him to the International Criminal Court in The Hague for trial. Thousands of Comorans participated in a protest on March 28 to demand that Bacar be extradited; it was widely believed in the Comoros that France secretly worked to protect him. In its extradition request, the Comoran government accused Bacar of &quot;embezzlement of public funds, homicide, rape, torture and other abuses against the people of Anjouan&quot;.

The case against Bacar and his 23 supporters, based on illegal entry and weapons possession, was dismissed by a court in Saint-Denis, Réunion on March 29. However, they were ordered to be placed in administrative detention; they were kept at air base 181. An order (&quot;reconduite à la frontière&quot;) to expel Bacar and his men back to the Comoros was issued on March 28, but it was subsequently revoked. On March 31, Bacar and his men requested political asylum. Bacar&#x27;s lawyers also requested a temporary residence permit for them, but this was rejected by the court in Saint-Denis. On April 1, a new order was signed for the expulsion of Bacar and his men. At a court hearing on April 2, Bacar said that he had &quot;confidence in French justice&quot;; his lawyers said that they would appeal the order for his expulsion.

On April 2, the Assembly of the Union of the Comoros accused France of taking Bacar from Anjouan to Mayotte. Replying to this allegation, French Foreign Ministry spokesman Pascale Andréani said on April 3 that Bacar had managed to flee Anjouan &quot;under unclear circumstances&quot;. Andréani said that Bacar was under house arrest on Réunion and that his request for asylum was being reviewed. On April 5, he and his men were detained at the request of the Saint-Denis public prosecutor. Bacar was moved to a different cell on April 7 due to threats he had received from other inmates.

Bacar appealed his detention, and on April 18 the Saint-Denis Court of Appeal ordered that he and his men be released, although they were to be kept under house arrest at air base 181. The Comoran government was given &quot;until May 4 to send a file documenting its extradition request&quot;. Reports on May 15 said France rejected Bacar&#x27;s request for asylum. Nevertheless, the French refugee office ruled that he could not be extradited to Comoros because of the risk of persecution. France&#x27;s State Secretary for Overseas, Yves Jégo, said France would support the Comoran government&#x27;s efforts. &quot;We will continue to act in consultation with the Comoros so that the law can be applied and Col Bacar can be tried.&quot;

In his trial for weapons possession and illegal entry at the Saint-Denis Court of Appeal, Bacar&#x27;s lawyers argued that Bacar and his men had needed the weapons for self-defense when they travelled from Anjouan to Mayotte and that they had surrendered the weapons to the police on Mayotte upon arrival. On June 5, 2008, Bacar was acquitted on the charge of illegal entry but was given a suspended sentence of three months imprisonment for entering the country with weapons.

On June 24, 2008, the Saint-Denis Court of Appeal ruled against extraditing Bacar to the Comoros. With all his appeals exhausted, Bacar, his brother, and two of his men were expelled from Réunion on the morning of July 19. They were taken to Cotonou, Benin, on a French government flight; the Beninese government had agreed to allow Bacar to stay in Benin. Bacar said that on this occasion that he intended to stay there for as long as his presence was allowed, and he expressed a desire to &quot;reflect on our past errors&quot;. Comoran government spokesman Abdourahim Said Bakar said that the government was &quot;disappointed&quot; by the expulsion of Bacar to Benin, reiterating the government&#x27;s position that he should face trial in the Comoros or before an international court.

== Embargo ==
With the decree (EG) Nr. 243/2008 from 17. March 2008 the European Commission introduced restrictive measures against Bacar&#x27;s former government. All financial and commercial resources of Mohamed Bacar, Jaffar Salim, Mhamed Abdou Madi, Ali Mchindra, Houmadi Souf, Rehema Boinali, Dhoihirou Halidi and Abdou Bacar are frozen. This also affects all companies, corporations, foundations and so on of these persons. Every payment or financial or commercial help to these people has to be approved. 
A person who gives money or other resources to these people may be prosecuted in Germany as a criminal according to § 34 Abs. 4 Nr. 2 German foreign trade law. Other European countries have different laws on this purpose.

<text>William Preston Lane Jr. (May 12, 1892 – February 7, 1967) was an American attorney and politician who served as the 52nd Governor of Maryland from 1947 to 1951.

==Early life and education==
Lane was born in Hagerstown, Maryland, on May 12, 1892, to William Preston Lane and Virginia Cartwright Lane. He attended public school in Hagerstown before graduating from the University of Virginia in 1915 with a law degree. He subsequently joined the law firm Lane, Bushong, and Byron in his hometown, where he also served on the vestry of Saint John&#x27;s Church. Lane served during the Mexican Border Campaign (1916) as a captain in the Maryland National Guard.

==Military service==
When the United States entered World War I in 1917, Lane joined the 115th Infantry Regiment as a captain and served in France during the Meuse-Argonne Offensive. He was awarded the Silver Star for his actions at Bois-des-Consevoye, where he assisted in the evacuation of wounded after a bridge was destroyed by enemy fire. He continued service in the military after the war as Assistant Division Adjutant of the 29th Division at the rank of major.

==Career==
Upon his return from service, Lane resumed the practice of law and began testing a career in politics. He ran for but lost the seat of Washington County State&#x27;s Attorney in 1919. After his defeat, he served as the president of a small newspaper company, as president of a tannery, and as a railroad executive. He married Dorothy Byron on January 17, 1922, and had two daughters, Dorothy and Jean.

===Attorney General of Maryland===
In 1928, Lane returned to politics when he was elected to the school board of Washington County. In 1930, the Democratic candidate for Attorney General of Maryland died unexpectedly and a replacement had to be found. Since Lane had formed a friendship with Albert Ritchie, the Governor of Maryland, he was placed on the ticket and won the seat by a large margin over his Republican opponent.

The highlight of Lane&#x27;s career as Attorney General was his pursuit of a lynching prosecution on the Eastern Shore of Maryland in 1933. Two years earlier on the Shore, a notorious lynching had occurred in Salisbury (the lynching of Matthew Williams), the response to which by Attorney-General Lane and Governor Ritchie was heavily criticized. Subsequently, another black man, George Armwood, was arrested and charged with raping a white woman in the adjoining Somerset County and was being held prisoner by police in Princess Anne. However, a mob overran the police and kidnapped Armwood, badly beating, stabbing and mutilating him before the hanging, then burning his body in front of the nearby courthouse. Local police did not pursue prosecution of the lynch mob, but Lane took charge of the investigation. The Maryland State Police and militia were called out by Governor Ritchie to assist, which resulted in further mob violence and arrests on the Eastern Shore, which damaged Lane&#x27;s reputation.

As Attorney General, Lane also pleaded two cases before the United States Supreme Court involving the assessment of submerged lands and the state&#x27;s right to tax condemned federal lands. Lane chose not to seek re-election in 1934.

After his tenure as Attorney General, Lane remained very active in state and national politics. From 1940 to 1950, he served as a member of the Democratic National Committee from Maryland, and he was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention from 1928 to 1948. In 1944, Lane managed Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Maryland campaign for re-election as President of the United States. Lane also remained active in business, serving as president of an aircraft corporation and a bridge company. He also kept active in law as a member of the firm Lane and Mish.

===Governor of Maryland===
In 1946, Lane decided to run for governor. In the Democratic primary election, he defeated challengers J. Millard Tawes and H. Streett Baldwin, and then defeated Republican Theodore R. McKeldin in the general election 55%-45%. As governor, Lane and his administration worked towards improving the public education, mental health, and highway systems of the state. A newspaper report published in 1949 exposed serious flaws in the treatment of the mentally ill in the state, which resulted in the creation of the Department of Mental Hygiene and turned Maryland&#x27;s mental hospitals by the end of the Lane administration into some of the best in the nation. Major highway improvements which had been deferred by World War II were also put in motion by Lane, which were funded by the enactment in 1947 of Maryland&#x27;s first state sales tax. The Chesapeake Bay Bridge, which now carries his name, was completed in 1952 under this plan. Several historic state facilities were also renovated during Lane&#x27;s tenure, including the Maryland State House which had not been adequately preserved since its construction in 1772.

Lane faced George P. Mahoney, a perennial candidate, in the 1950 Democratic primary election held on September 18, 1950. The primary was close and bruising, and left the Lane campaign weakened for the general election against Theodore McKeldin, his opponent in the 1946 election. Additionally, his unpopular sales tax to fund road improvements had caused significant dissent in the state and was used by McKeldin to pull votes away from Lane. On November 7, 1950, Lane was defeated in the general election by 94,000 votes, 57%-43%. At that point, it was the largest margin of defeat in Maryland history. Lane&#x27;s term as governor ended on January 10, 1951.

After his term as governor, Lane remained active in the Democratic party and engaged in business pursuits. He died of a heart attack in 1967, and is buried in Rose Hill Cemetery in Hagerstown.

<text>webMethods was an enterprise software company focused on application integration, business process integration and B2B partner integration.

Founded in 1996, the company sold systems for organizations to use web services to connect software applications over the Internet. In 2000, the company stock shares rose over 500% the first day it was publicly traded.

In 2007 webMethods was acquired by Software AG for $546 million and was made a subsidiary. By 2010 the webMethods division accounted for almost half of the parent company&#x27;s revenues.

Software AG retained the webMethods name, and uses it as a brand to identify a software suite encompassing process improvement, service-oriented architecture (SOA), IT modernization and business and partner integration.

In July 2024, IBM completed its purchase of webMethods, and related products.

==History==

The company was founded in 1996 by married couple Phillip Merrick (who was chief executive) and Caren Merrick (who was vice president for marketing using the name Caren DeWitt at the time) to use Web standards such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and (later) XML to allow software applications to communicate with one another in real time. This type of technology would later be referred to as &quot;web services&quot;. The company&#x27;s first product, called the Web Automation Server was released in August 1996; this was later superseded by the webMethods B2B Server also called as webMethods Integration Server, which was the company&#x27;s first product to see significant commercial use.

Initially, the founders used their savings and credit cards to keep the company operating in their house in Fairfax, Virginia.
By 1999 the company had clients such as DHL Express, Dell, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Hewlett-Packard, and had completed several rounds of venture capital investment. 
Mayfield Fund and FBR Technology Venture Partners (an arm of Friedman Billings Ramsey) were among investors.
In March 1999 the company entered into a partnership with SAP AG to create an SAP-focused integration product called the SAP Business Connector. The company&#x27;s revenue went from around $500,000 in 1997 to $14 million in 1999 and $202 million in 2001.

In February 2000, webMethods had its initial public offering (IPO) on the NASDAQ exchange. Just before the offering, the share price rose from its planned $13 to $35, and in its first day of trading, closed over $212 per share. The company raised only $175 million, while being valued at almost $7 billion. Although the term &quot;unicorn&quot; was not yet used, one analyst said &quot;The market is kind of foaming at the mouth on three-letter buzzwords, like B2B and XML&quot;.
The quick rise of its share price is given as an example of the excess of the dot-com bubble.

The IPO allowed webMethods to acquire Active Software for an estimated $1.3 billion in stock shares in August 2000.
Active Software, a public company based in Santa Clara, California and founded in 1994, had acquired Alier Inc., TransLink Software Inc. and Premier Software Technologies Inc in April 2000.
In January, 2001, webMethods acquired IntelliFrame Corporation, which had been part of Computer Network Technology Corporation, for about $31 million.
While revenues grew, the company posted continuing operating losses due to the early 2000s recession following the bursting of the dot-com bubble through 2002.
Although its share price declined sharply from its peak, company executives, directors and investors still made large profits on their shares.

In October, 2003, the company announced it acquired three smaller companies in the integration market, for a combined estimated value of $32 million.
The Mind Electric developed a technology called Glue, and its founder Graham Glass became the webMethods chief technical officer.
The Dante Group developed software for business activity monitoring (BAM).
The former DataChannel assets from Netegrity were used in a portal.

Deloitte estimated webMethods was the fourth fastest growing technology company in North America in 2003, on the Deloitte Fast 500.
By October, 2004, after revenues declined and losses rose, Phillip Merrick was replaced as CEO by David Mitchell.
In August, 2006, webMethods acquired Cerebra, a privately held company that developed metadata management software.
In September, 2006, webMethods acquired Infravio (which developed a software registry) for $38 million.

The company was an early developer and promoter of standards for web service technologies, having worked on XML-RPC, a precursor to SOAP, and developed Web Interface Definition Language, a precursor to the Web Services Description Language standard.

As part of a larger trend of consolidation, Software AG (based in Darmstadt, Germany) bid to acquire webMethods in April 2007 for an estimated $546 million in cash.
The offer price was more than 25% over the market price of its shares, and came one day after activist shareholders Augustus Oliver and Clifford Press disclosed a 6% stake and claimed the company was under-valued.
Although speculation persisted that a competitor might make a higher bid, the deal closed in June, 2007.
The brand webMethods was retained, effectively making webMethods its flagship product line, immediately doubling Software AG revenues in North America.
WebMethods version 8.0 was released in 2009, supplemented with other Software AG products such as Centrasite, Tamino and EntireX. In 2010, the webMethods division of Software AG, known as business processes excellence (BPE) recorded $668 million (499 million Euros) in revenues and was a major contributor to company net income.

In 2011, Caren Merrick ran as a Republican for the Virginia state senate, saying her history with webMethods made her a &quot;jobs creator&quot;, but was defeated by Barbara Favola.

In 2023, IBM acquired webMethods along with streamsets from Software AG. The acquisition was completed on 1st July 2024.

<text>The Bradford protein assay (also known as the Coomassie protein assay) was developed by Marion M. Bradford in 1976. It is a quick and accurate spectroscopic analytical procedure used to measure the concentration of protein in a solution. The reaction is dependent on the amino acid composition of the measured proteins.

==Principle==
The Bradford assay, a colorimetric protein assay, is based on an absorbance shift of the dye Coomassie brilliant blue G-250. The Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 dye exists in three forms: anionic (blue), neutral (green), and cationic (red). Under acidic conditions, the red form of the dye is converted into its blue form, binding to the protein being assayed. If there&#x27;s no protein to bind, then the solution will remain brown. The dye forms a strong, noncovalent complex with the protein&#x27;s carboxyl group by van der Waals force and amino group through electrostatic interactions. During the formation of this complex, the red form of Coomassie dye first donates its free electron to the ionizable groups on the protein, which causes a disruption of the protein&#x27;s native state, consequently exposing its hydrophobic pockets. These pockets in the protein&#x27;s tertiary structure bind non-covalently to the non-polar region of the dye via the first bond interaction (van der Waals forces) which position the positive amine groups in proximity with the negative charge of the dye. The bond is further strengthened by the second bond interaction between the two, the ionic interaction. When the dye binds to the protein, it causes a shift from 465 nm to 595 nm, which is why the absorbance readings are taken at 595 nm.

The cationic (unbound) form is green / red and has an absorption spectrum maximum historically held to be at 465 nm. The anionic bound form of the dye which is held together by hydrophobic and ionic interactions, has an absorption spectrum maximum historically held to be at 595 nm. The increase of absorbance at 595 nm is proportional to the amount of bound dye, and thus to the amount (concentration) of protein present in the sample.

Unlike other protein assays, the Bradford protein assay is less susceptible to interference by various chemical compounds such as sodium, potassium or even carbohydrates like sucrose, that may be present in protein samples. An exception of note is elevated concentrations of detergent. Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), a common detergent, may be found in protein extracts because it is used to lyse cells by disrupting the membrane lipid bilayer and to denature proteins for SDS-PAGE. While other detergents interfere with the assay at high concentration, the interference caused by SDS is of two different modes, and each occurs at a different concentration. When SDS concentrations are below critical micelle concentration (known as CMC, 0.00333%W/V to 0.0667%) in a Coomassie dye solution, the detergent tends to bind strongly with the protein, inhibiting the protein binding sites for the dye reagent. This can cause underestimations of protein concentration in solution. When SDS concentrations are above CMC, the detergent associates strongly with the green form of the Coomassie dye, causing the equilibrium to shift, thereby producing more of the blue form. This causes an increase in the absorbance at 595 nm independent of protein presence.

Other interference may come from the buffer used when preparing the protein sample. A high concentration of buffer will cause an overestimated protein concentration due to depletion of free protons from the solution by conjugate base from the buffer. This will not be a problem if a low concentration of protein (subsequently the buffer) is used.

In order to measure the absorbance of a colorless compound a Bradford assay must be performed. Some colorless compounds such as proteins can be quantified at an Optical Density of 280 nm due to the presence of aromatic rings such as tryptophan, tyrosine and phenylalanine but if none of these amino acids are present then the absorption cannot be measured at 280 nm.

== Advantages ==
Many protein-containing solutions have the highest absorption at 280 nm in the spectrophotometer, the UV range. This requires spectrophotometers capable of measuring in the UV range, which many cannot. Additionally, the absorption maxima at 280 nm requires that proteins contain aromatic amino acids such as tyrosine (Y), phenylalanine (F) and/or tryptophan (W). Not all proteins contain these amino acids, a fact which will skew the concentration measurements. If nucleic acids are present in the sample, they would also absorb light at 280 nm, skewing the results further. By using the Bradford protein assay, one can avoid all of these complications by simply mixing the protein samples with the Coomassie brilliant blue G-250 dye (Bradford reagent) and measuring their absorbances at 595 nm, which is in the visible range and may be accurately measured by the use of a mobile smartphone camera.

The procedure for Bradford protein assay is very easy and simple to follow. It is done in one step where the Bradford reagent is added to a test tube along with the sample. After mixing well, the mixture almost immediately changes to a blue color. When the dye binds to the proteins through a process that takes about 2 minutes, a change in the absorption maximum of the dye from 465 nm to 595 nm in acidic solutions occurs. Additionally, protein binding triggers a metachromatic reaction, evidenced by the emergence of a species that absorbs light around 595 nm, indicative of the unprotonated form This dye creates strong noncovalent bonds with the proteins, via electrostatic interactions with the amino and carboxyl groups, as well as Van Der Waals interactions. Only the molecules that bind to the proteins in solution exhibit this change in absorption, which eliminates the concern that unbound molecules of the dye might contribute to the experimentally obtained absorption reading. This process is more beneficial since it is less pricey than other methods, easy to use, and has high sensitivity of the dye for protein.

After 5 minutes of incubation, the absorbance can be read at 595 nm using a spectrophotometer or a mobile smartphone camera (RGBradford method).

This assay is one of the fastest assays performed on proteins. The total time it takes to set up and complete the assay is under 30 minutes. The entire experiment is done at room temperature.

The Bradford protein assay can measure protein quantities as little as 1 to 20 μg. It is an extremely sensitive technique.

The dye reagent is a stable ready to use product prepared in phosphoric acid. It can remain at room temperature for up to 2 weeks before it starts to degrade.

Protein samples usually contain salts, solvents, buffers, preservatives, reducing agents and metal chelating agents. These molecules are frequently used for solubilizing and stabilizing proteins. Other protein assay like BCA and Lowry are ineffective because molecules like reducing agents interfere with the assay. Using Bradford can be advantageous against these molecules because they are compatible to each other and will not interfere.

The linear graph acquired from the assay (absorbance versus protein concentration in μg/mL) can be easily extrapolated to determine the concentration of proteins by using the slope of the line.

It is a sensitive technique. It is also very simple: measuring the OD at 595 nm after 5 minutes of incubation. This method can also make use of a Vis spectrophotometer or a mobile smartphone camera (RGBradford method).

== Disadvantages ==
The Bradford assay is linear over a short range, typically from 0 μg/mL to 2000 μg/mL, often making dilutions of a sample necessary before analysis. In making these dilutions, error in one dilution is compounded in further dilutions resulting in a linear relationship that may not always be accurate.

Basic conditions and detergents, such as SDS, can interfere with the dye&#x27;s ability to bind to the protein through its side chains.

The reagents in this method tend to stain the test tubes. Same test tubes cannot be used since the stain would affect the absorbance reading. This method is also time sensitive. When more than one solution is tested, it is important to make sure every sample is incubated for the same amount of time for accurate comparison.

A limiting factor in using Coomassie-based protein determination dyes stems from the significant variation in color yield observed across different proteins This limiting factor is notably evident in collagen-rich protein samples, like pancreatic extracts, where both the Lowry and Bradford methods tend to underestimate protein content.

It is also inhibited by the presence of detergents, although this problem can be alleviated by the addition of cyclodextrins to the assay mixture.

Much of the non-linearity stems from the equilibrium between two different forms of the dye which is perturbed by adding the protein. The Bradford assay linearizes by measuring the ratio of the absorbances, 595 over 450 nm. This modified Bradford assay is approximately 10 times more sensitive than the conventional one.

The Coomassie Blue G250 dye used to bind to the proteins in the original Bradford method readily binds to arginine and lysine groups of proteins. This is a disadvantage because the preference of the dye to bind to these amino acids can result in a varied response of the assay between different proteins. Changes to the original method, such as increasing the pH by adding NaOH or adding more dye have been made to correct this variation. Although these modifications result in a less sensitive assay, a modified method becomes sensitive to detergents that can interfere with sample.

== Future of Bradford Protein Assay ==
New modifications for an improved Bradford Protein Assay have been underway that specifically focuses on enhancing detection accuracy for collagen proteins. One notable modification involves incorporating small amounts, approximately .0035%, of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). This inclusion of SDS has been shown to result in a fourfold increase in color response for three key collagen proteins—Collagen types I, III, and IV—while simultaneously decreasing the absorbance of non-collagen proteins. 

This simple modification in the preparation of the reagent resulted in Bradford Assays to produce similar response curves for both collagen and non-collagen proteins, expanding the use of Bradford Assays in samples containing high collagen proteins.

== Sample Bradford procedure ==

=== Materials ===

* Lyophilized bovine plasma gamma globulin
* Coomassie brilliant blue 1
* 0.15 M NaCl
* Spectrophotometer and cuvettes or a mobile smartphone camera (RGBradford method).
* Micropipettes

=== Procedure (Standard Assay, 20-150 μg protein; 200-1500 μg/mL) ===

# Prepare a series of standards diluted with 0.15 M NaCl to final concentrations of 0 (blank = No protein), 250, 500, 750 and 1500 μg/mL. Also prepare serial dilutions of the unknown sample to be measured.
# Add 100 μL of each of the above to a separate test tube (or spectrophotometer tube if using a Spectronic 20).
# Add 5.0 mL of Coomassie Blue to each tube and mix by vortex, or inversion.
# Adjust the spectrophotometer to a wavelength of 595 nm, using the tube which contains no protein (blank).
# Wait 5 minutes and read each of the standards and each of the samples at 595 nm wavelength.
# Plot the absorbance of the standards vs. their concentration. Compute the extinction coefficient and calculate the concentrations of the unknown samples.

=== Procedure (Micro Assay, 1-10 μg protein/mL) ===

# Prepare standard concentrations of protein of 1, 5, 7.5 and 10 μg/mL. Prepare a blank of NaCl only. Prepare a series of sample dilutions.
# Add 100 μL of each of the above to separate tubes (use microcentrifuge tubes) and add 1.0 mL of Coomassie Blue to each tube.
# Turn on and adjust a spectrophotometer to a wavelength of 595 nm, and blank the spectrophotometer using 1.5 mL cuvettes or use a mobile smartphone camera (RGBradford method).
# Wait 2 minutes and read the absorbance of each standard and sample at 595 nm.
# Plot the absorbance of the standards vs. their concentration. Compute the extinction coefficient and calculate the concentrations of the unknown samples.

==Using data obtained to find concentration of unknown==
In summary, in order to find a standard curve, one must use varying concentrations of BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin) in order to create a standard curve with concentration plotted on the x-axis and absorbance plotted on the y-axis. Only a narrow concentration of BSA is used (2-10 ug/mL) in order to create an accurate standard curve. Using a broad range of protein concentration will make it harder to determine the concentration of the unknown protein. This standard curve is then used to determine the concentration of the unknown protein. The following elaborates on how one goes from the standard curve to the concentration of the unknown.

First, add a line of best fit, or Linear regression and display the equation on the chart. Ideally, the R2 value will be as close to 1 as possible. R represents the sum of the square values of the fit subtracted from each data point. Therefore, if R2 is much less than one, consider redoing the experiment to get one with more reliable data.
The equation displayed on the chart gives a means for calculating the absorbance and therefore concentration of the unknown samples. In Graph 1, x is concentration and y is absorbance, so one must rearrange the equation to solve for x and enter the absorbance of the measured unknown. It is likely that the unknown will have absorbance numbers outside the range of the standard. These should not be included calculations, as the equation given cannot apply to numbers outside of its limitations.
In a large scale, one must compute the extinction coefficient using the Beer-Lambert Law A=εLC in which A is the measured absorbance, ε is the slope of the standard curve, L is the length of the cuvette, and C is the concentration being determined. In a micro scale, a cuvette may not be used and therefore one only has to rearrange to solve for x. 

In order to attain a concentration that makes sense with the data, the dilutions, concentrations, and units of the unknown must be normalized (Table 1). To do this, one must divide concentration by volume of protein in order to normalize concentration and multiply by amount diluted to correct for any dilution made in the protein before performing the assay.

<doc id="1098916" wikidata="Q1973038" url="?curid=1098916" title="Baltasar Corrada del Río">
<text>Baltasar Corrada del Río (April 10, 1935 – March 11, 2018) was a Puerto Rican politician. He held various high political offices in the island, including President of the Puerto Rico Civil Rights Commission, Resident Commissioner (1977–1985), Mayor of the capital city of San Juan (1985–1989), Puerto Rico&#x27;s 15th Secretary of State (1993–1995) and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court (1995–2005). He was also the unsuccessful NPP candidate for Governor in the elections of 1988.

==Education==
Corrada del Río obtained his high school diploma from Colegio Ponceño de Varones in 1952, and both his bachelor&#x27;s degree in Social Studies in 1956 and his law degree from the University of Puerto Rico in 1959. He was admitted to the Puerto Rico Bar that year and practiced as a private lawyer from 1969 to 1975.

==Political career==

In 1976, after initially expressing an interest in becoming Mayor of San Juan and running in an unofficial internal primary within the NPP, Corrada del Río was elected Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico.

During his tenure (1977–1985), he advocated for the admission of Puerto Rico into the Union and co-founded the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute. Corrada served as Mayor of San Juan, Puerto Rico, from 1985 to 1989 (having won the 1984 mayoral election).

In the elections of 1988, Corrada made an unsuccessful bid to become Governor of Puerto Rico. He was defeated by incumbent Governor Rafael Hernández Colón.

In January 1993, Pedro Rosselló became Governor and appointed Corrada as Puerto Rico&#x27;s 15th Secretary of State. Later, in 1995, Rosselló appointed Corrada as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico. He took the oath of office on July 15, 1995, after unanimous confirmation in the Senate of Puerto Rico. During his tenure as Associate Justice, Corrada was among the moderate/conservative voices in the Court, usually adhering to strict interpretations of the Constitution while practicing a firm type of judicial restraint.

The Constitution of Puerto Rico mandates an obligatory retirement for the Justices of the Supreme Court at age 70. Corrada arrived at this age in April, 2005, and was forced to retire. Prior to his retirement, Corrada publicly asked for an amendment to the Constitution that would repeal the obligatory retirement age for the justices, arguing that by obligating people to retire the constitution is discriminating by reason of age. At the time of its enactment in 1952, the average life expectancy in Puerto Rico was 61 years, 9 less than the mandatory retirement age. In 2013, the mandatory retirement age was 9 years less than the average life expectancy of 79.

The Court seat left vacant by Corrada remained vacant until 2009. Governor Aníbal Acevedo Vilá did not nominate anyone for the position after then-Senate President Kenneth McClintock made it clear in his inaugural speech as Senate president in 2005 that only a well-qualified statehooder would muster the votes for Senate confirmation to Court seats previously held by statehooders in order to assure &quot;balance&quot; on the bench. He was eventually succeeded in 2009 by Rafael Martinez-Torres, appointed by a Corrada protege, governor Luis Fortuño.

Upon his retirement from the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, he announced that he would abstain from political activity for one year, and, on 14 March 2006, he announced that within a month would begin attending New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico meetings, as former party president, to provide discrete advice. He also publicly disagreed with then-party president Pedro Rossello by objecting to the expulsion of then-Senate President Kenneth McClintock and then-Vice President Orlando Parga from the party for refusing to turn over the Senate presidency to Rossello. The expulsion was later revoked by the Supreme Court.

==Personal life==
He was the brother of Álvaro Corrada del Rio, Roman Catholic Bishop of Mayagüez, Puerto Rico and of a Roman Catholic nun. Another of his sisters was the Puerto Rico Independence Party candidate for mayor of San Juan in 1988, when he was elected to the post. He was married to Beatriz Betances, who served as First Lady of San Juan during his term as mayor, and had one daughter, Ana Isabel, three sons: Juan Carlos, Jose and Francisco; as well as several grandchildren: James Gregg, Michael Gregg, Alexis Marie, and Mayra. In 2013 his wife died he was too ill to travel for the funeral services held in Morovis, Puerto Rico.

==Death==
Baltasar Corrada del Río died on Sunday March 11, 2018, in Fort Myers, Florida at 82 years of age. By the time of his death he suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. His ashes were interred at the farm where he was born in Morovis, Puerto Rico on March 24, 2018.

==Honors and recognitions==

The Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI) issued a medal honoring Corrada and three other founding members.

In 2010, former Puerto Rico Secretary of State McClintock designated the department&#x27;s summer internship program as the Baltasar Corrada del Río State Department Internship Program. Distinguished students such as Josue Rivera, former National President of the Puerto Rico Statehood Students Association, participated in the First Class of interns.

On November 24, 2010, a ceremony was held at the Puerto Rico Department of State to announce the publication of Baltasar Corrada Del Río-Sus opiniones 1995-2005 a book containing excerpts from 61 of his Supreme Court opinions edited by Pontifical Catholic University Law School dean Angel González Román, at which Acting Governor Kenneth McClintock and Chief Justice Federico Hernandez Denton were the keynote speakers.

<doc id="1098920" wikidata="Q5392836" url="?curid=1098920" title="Ernest Brown (British politician)">
<text>Alfred Ernest Brown (27 August 1881 – 16 February 1962) was a British politician who served as leader of the Liberal Nationals from 1940 until 1945. He was a member of Parliament and also held many other political offices throughout the Second World War.
==Biography==
Born in Torquay, Devon, Brown was the son of a fisherman and prominent Baptist and it was through following his father that he came to preach, gaining much experience as a public speaker. He soon came to the attention of the local Liberals and became a prominent public speaker at political meetings.

Brown served in the First World War: in 1914 he joined the Sportsman&#x27;s Battalion and in 1916 was commissioned as an officer in the Somerset Light Infantry. He was mentioned in dispatches and was awarded the Military Cross and Italian Silver Star. 

After three unsuccessful attempts in other constituencies, he was elected as a Liberal Member of Parliament (MP) for Rugby in the 1923 general election but lost his seat in the 1924 general election. In 1927 he returned to Parliament in a by-election at Leith. During this time he became a devoted follower of Sir John Simon as the latter became increasingly at odds with the leader of the Liberals, David Lloyd George, and the party&#x27;s support, from 1929, for the minority Labour government of Ramsay MacDonald. In 1931 he followed Simon in resigning the Liberal party whip and then subsequently in setting up the Liberal Nationals.

===In cabinet===
In the National Government of Ramsay MacDonald, Brown became Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health in November 1931. The following year the official Liberal Cabinet ministers resigned from the government and Brown was promoted to become Secretary for Mines. In 1935 when MacDonald was succeeded as prime minister by Stanley Baldwin, Brown entered the Cabinet as Minister of Labour. This proved controversial as many believed that the Minister of Transport Leslie Hore-Belisha, had a stronger claim to be the next Liberal National to enter the Cabinet, though as unemployment was one of the government&#x27;s biggest problems, many others felt that Brown&#x27;s appointment to the job was not one to envy. He held the post for the next five years under both Baldwin and his successor, Neville Chamberlain. One of his most prominent achievements was the Unemployment Insurance (Agriculture) Act, 1936 which extended social security to nearly all workers in agriculture, forestry and horticulture. In another sphere he oversaw the formation of the National Joint Advisory Committee which assisted in wage control, compulsory arbitration, and direction of labour. He also helped workers in distributing to organise and took great pride when in 1937 the Trades Union Congress passed a unanimous resolution thanking him for this. In 1939 his department was expanded to incorporate overseeing National Service.

===Party leadership===
When Chamberlain fell in 1940 he was succeeded by Winston Churchill who moved Brown to the position of Secretary of State for Scotland, an unusual move as Brown, despite sitting for a Scottish constituency, was English by birth. At the same time Brown became the leader of the Liberal Nationals after Sir John Simon was transferred to the House of Lords. Brown served as Secretary of State for Scotland for a year before becoming Minister of Health for two years and finally Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.

Brown&#x27;s tenure as leader of the Liberal Nationals was one of decline, as the party saw its influence diminish. Many in the party had regretted the division of Liberal forces a decade earlier and Brown undertook negotiations with the Liberal Party leader Sir Archibald Sinclair over a potential reunion, but these talks foundered on the question of continued support for the National Government after the war. The change in the leadership of the Conservatives was also unfavourable and when, in 1945, Churchill formed his &quot;Caretaker&quot; government he did not include Brown or any other senior Liberal Nationals except Lord Rosebery in the Cabinet, despite claiming to head a &quot;National&quot; administration. Brown was instead appointed Minister of Aircraft Production. In the 1945 general election Brown lost his seat.

===Retirement and legacy===
After the war Brown devoted his attention to the church, often visiting other parts of the Commonwealth.

Brown had a reputation for being a fast speaker and many contemporary political commentators estimated that he could deliver a statement to the House of Commons faster than any other minister. The size of his voice was also noted. Baldwin once saw Brown in a phonebox at the House of Commons and is said to have remarked, &quot;I didn&#x27;t think he needed a phone to communicate with his constituents.&quot; Another more famous story reflecting on Brown&#x27;s strong voice, is told of when Stanley Baldwin was living at 11 Downing Street he was startled by a great shouting in the building. When informed that it was Ernest Brown talking to Scotland, Baldwin said &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t he use the telephone?&quot;

<text>Harads () is a locality situated in Boden Municipality, Norrbotten County, Sweden, approximately 50 kilometers (31 miles) south of the Arctic Circle, with 501 inhabitants in 2010. It is the main village in the parish of Edefors.

Among the key sites of the municipality is the Edefors church, from 1928, designed by Stockholm architect John Åkerlund (1884-1961) in an eclectic style, combining the simplified style of Nordic Classicism with more National Romantic elements. The church replaced an older church, dating from 1888, and designed clearly in the National Romantic style, which had been destroyed in a fire in 1918.

Harads is also the home of the Treehotel complex, devised by entrepreneur Kent Lindvall in 2010, with the &quot;rooms&quot; of the hotel built high into the canopy of a pine forest. The &quot;rooms&quot;, each designed by a different architect, are encapsulated in their names, such as &quot;Mirrorcube&quot;, &quot;UFO&quot;, &quot;Blue Cone&quot;, &quot;Bird&#x27;s Nest&quot;. Lindvall argues that the design idea of the hotel is based on the ecological principle of sustainability.

<text>The Australian land hermit crab (&quot;Coenobita variabilis&quot;) is a terrestrial hermit crab species, native to Australia. It is a nocturnal, omnivorous crustacean. They are gregarious and thrive in tropical areas near water.

==Distribution==
The Australian land hermit crab is endemic to northern parts of Australia including northern Western Australia, Northern Territory and northern Queensland.

== Biology ==
The Australian land hermit crab (&quot;Coenobita variabilis&quot;) reaches a carapace length of . They closely resemble the Pacific hermit crab (&quot;Coenobita compressus&quot;) in appearance and they both have a shortened aquatic development stage.

Australian land hermit crabs are light brown to pale brown in colour, with two dark ovals on the front of the head. Their eyestalks are long and are the same colour as the body. Each claw has a dark vertical stripe. They have dark brown spots all over the legs. The abdomen is short and fat.

==Shell preference==

The preferred seashells of &quot;C. variabilis&quot; include &quot;Babylonia&quot;, &quot;Nerita&quot;, &quot;Phasianella&quot;, &quot;Thais&quot;, &quot;Tonna&quot; and &quot;Turban&quot; seashells. They are also found to be fond of several varieties of land snail shells such as Aratan snail and rice snail.

As the hermit crabs grow, they must exchange their shell for a larger one. Since intact gastropod shells are not an unlimited resource, there is frequently strong competition for the available shells, with hermit crabs fighting over shells. The availability of empty shells depends on the abundance of the gastropods and hermit crabs, but most importantly on the frequency of organisms that prey on gastropods but leave the shells intact. A hermit crab with a shell which is too tight cannot grow as fast as hermit crabs with well-fitting shells, and is more likely to be eaten. Although hermit crabs need to change shells regularly, they will not abandon their old shell unless they have a larger and newer one to change into and unless they feel safe.

<text>High-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK or HK) is a circulating plasma protein which participates in the initiation of blood coagulation, and in the generation of the vasodilator bradykinin via the kallikrein-kinin system. HMWK is inactive until it either adheres to binding proteins beneath an endothelium disrupted by injury, thereby initiating coagulation; or it binds to intact endothelial cells or platelets for functions other than coagulation.

== Other names ==

In the past, HMWK has been called HMWK-kallikrein factor, Flaujeac factor (1975), Fitzgerald factor (1975), and Williams-Fitzgerald-Flaujeac factor, - the eponyms being for people first reported to have HMWK deficiency. Its current accepted name is to contrast it with &quot;low&quot;-molecular-weight kininogen (LMWK) which has a similar function to HMWK in the tissue (as opposed to serum) kinin-kallikrein system.

== Structure and function ==

HMWK is an alpha-globulin with six functional domains. It circulates as a single-chain 626 amino acid polypeptide . The heavy chain contains domains 1, 2, and 3; the light chain, domains 5 and 6. Domain 4 links the heavy and light chains in addition to a disulfide bond between positions close to the N- and C-termini.

The domains contain the following functional sites:
*Domain 1 - calcium binding
*Domain 2 - cysteine protease inhibition
*Domain 3 - cysteine protease inhibition; platelet and endothelial cell binding
*Domain 4 - bradykinin generation
*Domain 5 - heparin and cell binding; antiangiogenic properties; binding to negatively charged surfaces
*Domain 6 - prekallikrein and factor XI binding (amino acids 420 to 510)(histidine rich)

HMWK is one of four proteins which interact to initiate the contact activation pathway (also called the intrinsic pathway) of coagulation: the other three are Factor XII, Factor XI and prekallikrein. HMWK is not enzymatically active, and functions only as a cofactor for the activation of kallikrein and factor XII. It is also necessary for the activation of factor XI by factor XIIa.

HMWK is also a precursor of bradykinin; this vasodilator is released through positive feedback by kallikrein. Cleavage by kallikein results in the liberation of two peptides, one of which is bradykinin, from HMWK&#x27;s fourth domain.

Cleavage by kallikrein also helps HMWK to optimally function as a coactivator. The cleavage results in a change in the conformation of HMWK that may increase the accessibility of its surface binding domain, which could explain cleaved HMWK&#x27;s increased affinity for negatively charged surfaces. The resulting severed light and heavy chains remain connected by the aforementioned disulfide bond near the original N- and C-termini.

HMWK is a strong inhibitor of cysteine proteinases. Responsible for this activity are domains 2 and 3 on its heavy chain.

Cleavage of HMWK by activated factor XI abrogates HMWK&#x27;s ability to act as a cofactor, establishing negative feedback.

== Genetics ==

The gene for both LMWK and HMWK is located on the 3rd chromosome (3q26). Alternative splicing of the &quot;KNG1&quot; gene transcript gives rise to processed mRNA that differs by what is included from the last two exons of the pre-mRNA. Consequently, HMWK protein differs from LMWK only in having a larger light chain: the heavy chain and bradykinin portions are identical.

== Measurement ==

Measurement of HMWK is usually done with mixing studies, in which plasma deficient in HMWK is mixed with the patient&#x27;s sample and a partial thromboplastin time (PTT) is determined. Results are expressed in % of normal - a value under 60% indicates a deficiency.

== Clinical features ==

The existence of HMWK was hypothesised in 1975 when several patients were described with a deficiency of a class of plasma protein and a prolonged bleeding time and PTT. 
There is no increased risk of bleeding or any other symptoms, so the deficiency is a trait, not a disease.

<doc id="1098952" wikidata="Q63232" url="?curid=1098952" title="Maria Cunitz">
<text>Maria Cunitz or Maria Cunitia (other versions of surname include: &quot;Cunicia, Cunitzin,&quot; &quot;Kunic, Cunitiae, Kunicia, Kunicka&quot;; 1610 – 22 August 1664) was an accomplished Silesian astronomer, and the most notable female astronomer of the early modern era. She authored a book &quot;Urania propitia&quot;, in which she provided new tables, new ephemera, and a simpler working solution to Kepler&#x27;s second law for determining the position of a planet on its elliptical path. The Cunitz crater on Venus is named after her. The minor planet 12624 Mariacunitia is named in her honour.

==Life==
Maria Cunitz was born in Wohlau (now Wołów, Poland), as the eldest daughter of a Baltic German, Heinrich Cunitz, a physician and landowner who had lived in Schweidnitz for most of his life, and Maria Scholtz from Liegnitz, daughter of German scientist Anton von Scholtz (1560–1622), a mathematician and counselor to Duke Joachim Frederick of Liegnitz. The year of Maria&#x27;s birth is uncertain. No birth, baptism or similar documents have ever been located. The year was speculated about in the first major German-language publication about Maria Cunitz of 1798. Paul Knötel appears to be the first to give the year 1604 as the year of Maria&#x27;s birth. This date is estimated to be accurate since her parents married the previous year. Other authors later appear to have repeated the same year. The proof that Maria was actually born in 1610 is furnished by an anthology with congratulation poems on her first wedding, in connection with a letter of Elias A Leonibus to Johannes Hevelius from the year 1651, noted by Ingrid Guentherodt. Full details concerning the family of Maria Cunitz have been published by Klaus Liwowsky. The family eventually moved to Schweidnitz in Lower Silesia (today Świdnica, Poland). At an early age of 13, Maria married (in 1623) the lawyer David von Gerstmann. After his death in 1626, she married (in 1630) Elias von Löwen, also from Silesia. Elias von Lowen was also known as Elie de Loewen was a physician at Pitschen and studied astronomy. Elias von Lowen was Maria&#x27;s tutor and encouraged Maria to pursue astronomy before their marriage in 1630. Together they made observation of Venus on 14 December 1627 and Jupiter in April 1628. Other areas of study that Maria was proficient in included medicine, poetry, painting, music, mathematics, ancient languages, and history. Elias and Maria had three sons: Elias Theodor, Anton Heinrich and Franz Ludwig.
During the outbreak of the Thirty Years&#x27; War from 1618 to 1648 Maria and Elias von Löwen took refuge in the Cistercians convent of Olobok, Poland. They were of Protestant religion; her siblings, who stayed in Silesia, converted to Roman Catholicism. During the time Maria and Elias took refuge, Maria used her time to arrange a set of astronomical tables that were based on the Rudolphine Tables, which was written by Johannes Kepler. Cunitz expanded her astronomical tables to include all of the planets at any moment in time. At the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War the couple returned to their home at Pitschen in Silesia. In 1650, Maria privately published of her own expense &quot;Urania propitia&quot; in German and Latin as a dedication to Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III&quot;.&quot; &quot;Urania propitia&quot; was a simplification of Kepler&#x27;s Rudolphine Tables due to their difficulty of producing calculations and applications, because the use of logarithms.

== &quot;Urania propitia&quot; ==

&quot;Urania propitia&quot; is one of the most well known and influential works created by Cunitz. Her cosmology, as exemplified in this work, was a variation of other great, early astronomers such as Tycho Brahe and Johannes Kepler. &quot;Urania propitia&quot; is a &quot;large quarto with a large number of pages of tables that allows people to determine both the longitude and latitude of each of the planets, also along with other parameters.&quot; In this text she revised the complicated and errored calculations found in Kepler&#x27;s Rudolphine Tables by creating simpler algorithms that reduced the room for human and mathematical error. However, Cunitz did omit small coefficients, leading to minimal errors in &quot;Urania propitia&quot;. &quot;Urania propitia&quot; was published in both Latin and German in order to increases its accessibility.

Elias von Lowen, Maria&#x27;s second husband, created the preface to &quot;Urania propitia&quot;. Elias wanted to make sure the reader of &quot;Urania propitia&quot; knew that the entirety of this work was exclusively Maria&#x27;s own work. Elias also wanted to note that he had no part in writing &quot;Urania propitia&quot;, but he wanted to make clear the fact that he continuously supported his wife Maria.

&quot;Urania propitia&quot; provided new tables, new ephemera, and a more elegant solution to Kepler&#x27;s Problem, which is to determine the position of a planet in its orbit as a function of time. Today, her book is also credited for its contribution to the development of the German scientific language.

&quot;Urania propitia&quot; did not have much of an impact on late 17th-century astronomy. A large contribution to this fact has to do with Cunitz publishing her work in an isolated printing establishment in Olesnica, and there were only a few copies of the &quot;Urania propitia&quot; made. No one really mentioned &quot;Urania propitia&quot;, except a mid-century Parisian astronomer named Ismael Boulliau. However, Boulliau &quot;only commented on the &quot;Urania propitia&quot; and thought his work was better and more accurate than Cunitz&#x27;s work.&quot;

Urania is the Greek mythological muse of Astronomy while propitia is translated from Latin to &quot;beneficent.&quot; This title follows the common theme of attributing a scientific success to a female muse, but also recognizes the connection between the muse and its female author. This statement title in early 17th century Germany, a time where recognized and accepted women scientists were few and far between, was a groundbreaking text that exemplified the abilities of women in science.

== Education ==
Maria was the daughter of Heinrich Cunitz, who was a well renowned and knowledgeable physician, and Maria Scholtz, the self educated daughter of a German scientist. Although both of Maria&#x27;s parents were well educated, Maria herself never had any formal education. Despite the negative connotation of teaching women about the natural sciences that often prevailed in 17th century Germany, Heinrich and Mary educated Maria in a multitude of subjects, including mathematics, medicine, history, and the fine arts. Maria could speak in seven languages: German, Italian, French, Polish, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.

One of Maria&#x27;s tutors, Elias von Löven, a physician and amateur astrologist like her father, would later become her second husband. During their marriage Elias encouraged his wife&#x27;s passion for astronomy and mathematics. He introduced her to various astronomists of the time, such as Johannes Hevelius of Danzig, Ismaël Boulliau, Pierre Desnoyers, Albrecht Portner, and Pierre Gassendi, who served as secretary to the Queen of Poland. However, the past limitations in the education and communication of women meant that Maria had to communicate with her fellow scholars under the name of her husband, Elias. Often the letters were filled with poetic fluff in order to maintain the common etiquette while in communication with one of the opposite sex.

Due to her many talents and accomplishments, Cunitz was called the &quot;Silesian Pallas&quot; by J.B. Delambre, who also compared her to Hypatia of Alexandria during his study of history in astronomy.

In 1727 the book &quot;Schlesiens Hoch- und Wohlgelehrtes Frauenzimmer, nebst unterschiedenen Poetinnen...&quot;, Johan Caspar Eberti wrote that

&quot;(Maria) Cunicia or Cunitzin was the daughter of the famous Henrici Cunitii. She was a well-educated woman, like a queen among the Silesian womanhood. She was a dedicated astrologist and especially enjoyed astronomical problems&quot;.

== Legacy and recognition ==
&quot;Urania propitia&quot; had a lasting effect in the world of astronomy, inspiring her fellow astronomers and correspondents to eliminate errors and eir on the side of simplicity when deriving calculations. However, a fire broke out in the streets of Byczyna, Poland and destroyed Maria Cunitz and her husband Elias von Löwen&#x27;s house and her vast collection astronomy equipment, academic books and papers, and her detailed correspondence with relevant astronomers. Much of her work was lost. However, &quot;Urania propitia&quot; was privately published and as of 2016 there are nine physical copies in the world along with multiple online copies. Physical copies can be found in the Library of the Astronomical Observatory of Paris, Library of the University of Florida, in the exhibit of Galileo and Kepler at the University Libraries of Norman, Oklahoma, and Bloomington Lilly Library of Indiana University. Prior to 10 June 2004 the first edition of &quot;Urania propitia&quot; was located at The Library of The Earls of Macclesfield in the Shirburn Castle: Part 2 Science A-C section.

In Świdnica, the town where Maria grew up, there is a monument of Cunitz. The monument is an iron bench with a bronze sculpture of Maria sitting on the bench with the &quot;Urania propitia&quot; in her right hand. Apparently, the monument of Maria in Świdnica, is the only known monument contributed to Cunitz.

=== Named after her ===

* Cunitz crater, a in diameter crater on Venus is named after her. The name was approved by the International Astronomcal Union in 1991.
* 12624 Mariacunitia, a main-belt asteroid discovered at the Palomar Observatory in 1960 is named in honor of her.

== Nationality ==

Maria Cunitz is usually characterized as Silesian, for example in the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition of 1911. She was born and spent most of her life in the Holy Roman Empire, which included non-German minorities, ruled by the Austrian Habsburg monarchy. The fragment of Silesia in which Maria lived was part of Bohemia before 990, the united Poland between 990 and 1202 and part of Bohemia between 1038 and 1050. In 1202 the Polish seniorate was abolished and all Polish Duchies, including Silesia, became independent, although four Silesian dukes of the 13th century were rulers of Kraków and held the title &quot;Duke of Poland&quot;. In 1331 the region again became part of Bohemia. In 1742 it became part of Prussia and in 1871 the German Empire. About three centuries after Maria&#x27;s lifetime it was reassigned to Poland after World War II.

During Maria&#x27;s lifetime, nationality did not play as significant a role in determining person&#x27;s identity as it does today. However, the birthplace of Maria Cunitz and the long reaching effects of the Thirty Years War did have a substantial effect on Maria&#x27;s work. Her time in hiding helped to develop her simplification of the Rudolphine Tables. Nevertheless, multiple later sources felt the need to assign to Maria Cunitz a nationality relevant to their own time. She has mostly been described as German, for example in the &quot;Biographical Dictionary of Woman in Science&quot;. She published in German. She has been also described as Polish and some consider her to be the first Polish woman astronomer.
Cunitz spoke not only German and Polish but also French, Greek, Italian, Latin and Hebrew.

<text>Ferromanganese is an alloy of iron and manganese, with other elements such as silicon, carbon, sulfur, nitrogen and phosphorus. The primary use of ferromanganese is as a type of processed manganese source to add to different types of steel, such as stainless steel. Global production of low-carbon ferromanganese (i.e. alloys with less than 2% carbon content) reached 1.5 megatons in 2010.

== Physical and chemical properties ==
The properties of ferromanganese vary considerably with the precise type and composition of the alloy. The melting point is generally between and . The density of the alloy depend slightly on the types of impurities present, but is generally around .

== Production ==
Sources of manganese ore generally also contain iron oxides. As manganese has a more negative free energy of oxidation than iron, i.e. is chemically harder to reduce (as shown graphically in the Ellingham diagram), during the reduction of manganese ore, iron is also reduced and mixed with the manganese in the melt. This is unlike other oxides such as SiO2, Al2O3 and CaO, which are more stable as oxides than manganese.

Reduction is achieved using a submerged arc furnance. There are two main industrial procedures to perform the reduction, the discard slag method (or flux method) and the duplex method (or fluxless method). Despite the name, the differences in the method are not in the addition of flux, but rather in the number of stages required. In the flux method, basic fluxes such as CaO are added in order to electrolytically reduce the manganese ore:

&lt;chem&gt; 2MnO + C -&gt; 2Mn + CO2 &lt;/chem&gt;

The remaining slag after the reduction process has approximately 15-20% manganese content, which is usually discarded.

In the fluxless method, carbon reduction is also used in the first stage, but the fluxes added do not necessarily increase the activity of the manganese. As a result, the remaining slag has a concentration of 30% to 50% of the manganese. This is then reprocessed with quartzite to make silicomanganese alloys. The resultant discarded slag has a manganese content of less than 5%, increasing the yield. As a result, this method is used more often in industry.

In both methods, due to the addition of carbon as an reducing agent, the alloy produced is referred to as high-carbon ferromanganese (HCFM), with a carbon content of up to 6%.

A correct mix of coke, flux and ore composition is required to give high yield and reliable furnance operation, by achieving the desired chemical properties, viscosity and smelting temperature in the resulting melt. Since the iron to manganese ratio of natural manganese sources vary greatly, mixing ores from several sources is sometimes done to give a certain desired ratio.

In the manufacture of steel, low-carbon ferromanganese (LCFM) is preferred due to the ability to accurately control the amount of carbon in the resultant steel. To arrive at LCFM from HCFM, there are also two main methods: silicothermal reduction and oxygen refinement.

In silicothermal reduction, silicomanganese from the second step of the duplex process is used as a reductant. After a variety of mixing and melting steps to reduce the silicon content, a low-carbon alloy with less than 0.8% carbon and 1% silicon by weight can be obtained.

In the oxygen refinement method, HCFM is melted and heated to a high temperature of . Oxygen is then blown in to oxidise the carbon into CO and CO2. The disadvantage of this process is that the metal is also oxidised at these high temperatures. Manganese oxide collects mainly in the form of Mn3O4 in the dust blown out from the crucible.

==History==

In 1856, Robert Forester Mushet &quot;used manganese to improve the ability of steel produced by the Bessemer process to withstand rolling and forging at elevated temperatures.&quot;

In 1860, Henry Bessemer invented the use of ferromanganese as a method of introducing manganese in controlled proportions during the production of steel. The advantage of combining powdered iron oxide and manganese oxide together is the lower melting point of the combined alloy compared to pure manganese oxide.

In 1872, Lambert von Pantz produced ferromanganese in a blast furnace, with significantly higher manganese content than was previously possible (37% instead of the previous 12%). This won his company international recognition, including a gold medal at the 1873 World Exposition in Vienna and a certificate of award at the 1876 Centennial Exposition in Pennsylvania.

In an 1876 article, MF Gautier explained that the magnetic oxide needs to be slagged off by the addition of manganese (then in the form of spiegel iron) in order to befit it for rolling.

<text>HP-150 (aka HP Touchscreen or HP 45611A) was a compact, powerful and innovative computer made by Hewlett-Packard in 1983. It was based on the Intel 8088 CPU and was one of the world&#x27;s earliest commercialized touch screen computers. Like other &quot;workalike&quot; IBM PC clones of the time, despite running customized MS-DOS versions 2.01, 2.11 and 3.20, the machine was not IBM PC DOS compatible. Its 8088 CPU, rated at 8 MHz, was faster than the 4.77 MHz CPUs used by the IBM PC of that period. Using add-on cards, main memory could be increased from 256 KB to 640 KB. However, its mainboard did not have a slot for the optional Intel 8087 math coprocessor due to space constraints. An HP-150 with an optional hard disk was called HP Touchscreen MAX.

The computer&#x27;s screen was a 9-inch Sony CRT surrounded by infrared emitters and detectors which detected the position of any non-transparent object that touched the screen. In the original HP-150, these emitters and detectors were placed within small holes located on the inside of the monitor&#x27;s bezel (which resulted in the bottom series of holes sometimes filling with dust, causing the touchscreen to fail until the dust was vacuumed from the holes).

Like the original Macintosh, HP-150 was packaged with the CRT display as a single unit, and made use of 3½-inch floppy disks. Unlike the Mac, however, HP-150 had no internal floppy drive; the machine sat atop the phone book-sized 9121D dual 3½-inch floppy (76 mm high, 325 mm wide, 285 mm deep) or similarly sized hard disk devices, connected by HP-IB.

Invisible to the user, the HP-150 runs &quot;Terminal Operating System&quot; (&quot;TOS&quot;, code-named &quot;Magic&quot; during development). This operating system generally runs only two tasks: the terminal emulator and MST (which is Microsoft DOS).

==Hardware==
===Display===

Display resolutions:
* Text: 80 columns × 27 lines (720 × 378 pixels)
** Character size: 7 × 10 pixels
** Character cell size: 9 × 14 pixels
** Inherent HP Terminal emulation equivalent to HP 2623 Graphics Terminal
* Bit-map: 512 × 390 pixels
* Separate plane for text and graphics
* Monitor sensor grid: 40 (h) × 24 (v)

HP-150&#x27;s touch screen sensor grid is quite coarse. Its resolution is only two characters wide. Used mainly for rough cursor positioning and function key control, it could not be used to draw pictures.

===Processor unit===
* Optional internal thermal printer HP 2647A (fax roll)
* Communication ports:
** Two RS-232 ports (one of them supported RS-422)
** HP-IB (IEEE-488)
** HP-HIL (standard on HP-150 II, but an optional add-on card on HP-150)

===Storage===
* Supported HP-IB attached storage:
==Reception==
&quot;BYTE&quot; in November 1984 called HP-150 &quot;an extremely flexible machine&quot;, but &quot;difficult to program&quot;.

==Successors==
The two-CPU HP-120 (aka HP 45600A) Z80 CP/M machine also used the 9121 drives.

HP-150 II (aka HP 45849A) replaced HP-150 in 1984. While still called HP Touchscreen II, the touchscreen was no longer standard, but rather a rarely adopted option. The optional touchscreen bezel was superior to the original bezel, in that the emitters and detectors were now located behind a solid infrared-transparent plastic; thus removing the need to regularly clean the holes found in the original model.

HP-150 II had the same footprint as HP-150, but came in a larger housing to accommodate its 12-inch screen, but could no longer accommodate an internal printer. HP-150 II had four expansion slots available (as opposed to two), and could accommodate an optional 8087 co-processor board. There were some minor compatibility problems between HP-150 and HP-150 II in the video subsystem.

In 1985, HP introduced the Vectra, which &quot;InfoWorld&quot; stated was the company &quot;responding to demands from its customers for full IBM PC compatibility&quot;. HP repositioned HP-150 as a workstation for the HP 3000 minicomputer.

<doc id="1098971" wikidata="Q7896851" url="?curid=1098971" title="UnixODBC">
<text>unixODBC is an open-source project that implements the Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) API. The code is provided under the GNU GPL/LGPL and can be built and used on many different operating systems, including most versions of Unix, Linux, Mac OS X, IBM OS/2 and Microsoft&#x27;s Interix.

The goals of the project include:
*Provide developers with the tools to port Microsoft Windows ODBC applications to other platforms with the minimum of code changes.
*Maintain the project as a vendor neutral interface database SDK
*Provide people who write ODBC drivers the tools to port their drivers to non Windows platforms
*Provide the user with a set of GUI and command line tools for managing their database access
*Maintain links with both the free software community and commercial database vendors, to ensure interoperability

==History==

=== 1999 ===

The unixODBC project was first started in the early months of 1999 (by Peter Harvey) and was created as at that time the developers of iODBC (another open source ODBC implementation) were not then willing to LGPL the code, expand the API to include the current ODBC 3 API specification, and did not consider the addition of GUI based configuration tools worthwhile. iODBC now has these parts added, and applications that use the ODBC interface may use both iODBC and unixODBC, without change in most cases, as a result of both projects adhering to the single ODBC specification.

=== 1999 July ===

The original driver manager was very basic. The driver manager was rewritten by Easysoft&#x27;s Nick Gorham soon after the project started. Nick assumed leadership of the project in July 1999 with Peter Harvey continuing work on supporting code.

The development of unixODBC progressed since its origin, with contributions from many developers, both in the open source community and also from commercial database companies, including IBM, Oracle Corporation and SAP.

It is included as part of the standard installation of many Linux distributions.

=== 2009 ===

The unixODBC project was split into several projects (all hosted on SourceForge);
* unixODBC (&quot;Core&quot; and &quot;Dev&quot; bits)
* unixODBC-GUI-Qt (Qt based GUI bits)
* unixODBC-Test (multiple test frameworks)

This split was done to allow faster releases of supporting work while maintaining focus on stability and consistency for the core code.

<doc id="1098972" wikidata="Q307697" url="?curid=1098972" title="Zayyanid dynasty">
<text>The Zayyanid dynasty or Ziyanids (, &quot;Ziyāniyyūn&quot;) or Abd al-Wadids (, &quot;Bānu ʿAbd āl-Wād&quot;) was a Berber Zenata dynasty that ruled the Kingdom of Tlemcen, mainly in modern Algeria centered on the town of Tlemcen in northwest Algeria. The Zayyanid dynasty&#x27;s rule lasted from 1235 to 1557.

==History==
On the collapse of the Almohad Caliphate&#x27;s rule around 1236, the Kingdom of Tlemcen became independent under the rule of the Zayyanids, and Yaghmurasen Ibn Zyan. Ibn Zyan was able to maintain control over the rival Berber groups, and when faced with the outside threat of the Marinids, he formed an alliance with the Sultan of Granada and the King of Castile, Alfonso X.

After an eight-year siege of Tlemcen by the Marinids that ended in 1307, the reigns of Abu Hammu I (r. 1308–1318) and Abu Tashufin I (r. 1318–1337) marked a second political apogee of the Zayyanids with a consolidated hold over the central Maghreb. This period of strength was followed by a Marinid occupation of Tlemcen between 1337 and 1359 (with an interruption from 1348 to 1352). There were occasional Marinid attempts to retake Tlemcen up to 1370, but they found that they were unable to hold the region against local resistance. Under the long reign of Abu Hammu II (r. 1359–1389), the Zayyanid state enjoyed a third period of political strength.

In the 15th century, Zayyanid expansion eastward was attempted, but proved disastrous, as consequences of these incursions they were so weakened that over the following two centuries, the Zayyanid kingdom was intermittently a vassal of Hafsid Ifriqiya, Marinid Morocco, or Aragon. During the first half of the 16th century, Spain and the Ottoman Regency of Algiers fought over control of Tlemcen, with the Zayyanid sultans often installed as puppets of one side or the other. By 1551, the Ottomans had occupied Tlemcen and the last Zayyanid ruler, Hasan al-Abdallah, fled to Oran under Spanish protection and died a few years later, thus ending Zayyanid rule.

<doc id="1098977" wikidata="Q275545" url="?curid=1098977" title="Dorothy Thompson">
<text>Dorothy Celene Thompson (July 9, 1893 – January 30, 1961) was an American journalist and radio broadcaster. She was the first American journalist to be expelled from Nazi Germany in 1934 and was one of the few women news commentators broadcasting on radio during the 1930s. Thompson is regarded by some as the &quot;First Lady of American Journalism&quot; and was recognized by &quot;Time&quot; magazine in 1939 as equal in influence to Eleanor Roosevelt. Recordings of her NBC Radio commentary and analysis of the European situation and the start of World War II (from Aug. 23-Sept. 6, 1939) were selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Recording Registry in 2023, based on their &quot;cultural, historical or aesthetic importance in the nation’s recorded sound heritage.&quot;

==Life and career==
Dorothy Thompson was born in Lancaster, New York, in 1893, one of three children of Peter and Margaret (Grierson) Thompson. Her siblings were Peter Willard Thompson and Margaret Thompson (later Mrs. Howard Wilson). Her mother died in April 1901 when Thompson was seven, leaving Peter, a Methodist minister, to raise his children alone. Their father soon remarried, but Dorothy did not get along with his new wife, Elizabeth Abbott Thompson.

In 1908, her father sent Thompson to Chicago to live with his two sisters to avoid further conflict. In Chicago she attended Lewis Institute for two years and earned an associate degree before transferring to Syracuse University as a junior. At Syracuse, she studied politics and economics and graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1914. Because she had the opportunity to be educated, unlike many women of the time, Thompson felt that she had a social obligation to fight for women&#x27;s suffrage, which would become the base of her ardent political beliefs. Shortly after graduation, Thompson moved to Buffalo and became involved in the women&#x27;s suffrage campaign. During her time in the suffrage movement, Thompson also did advertising and publicity work in New York City and contributed op-eds on social justice to &quot;The New York Times&quot; and the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;. In 1920, she went abroad to pursue a journalism career.

===Journalism in Europe===
Thompson boarded a ship to London in June 1920 to become a foreign correspondent. Beginning by submitting articles to the International News Service (INS), she went to Ireland in August and was the last to interview the Sinn Féin Irish independence leader Terence MacSwiney. Later on the day of the interview, Aug. 12, MacSwiney was arrested for sedition by the British government; he died in prison on a hunger strike two months later.
The interview was sent by INS to American newspapers and led to Thompson being appointed Vienna correspondent for the Philadelphia &quot;Public Ledger&quot;.

While working in Vienna, Thompson became fluent in German. She met and worked alongside correspondents John Gunther and G. E. R. Gedye. In 1925, she was promoted to Chief of the Central European Service for the &quot;Public Ledger&quot;. She resigned in 1927 and, not long after, the &quot;New York Evening Post&quot; appointed her head of its Berlin bureau in Germany. There she witnessed firsthand the rise of the National Socialist or Nazi party. According to her biographer, Peter Kurth, Thompson was &quot;the undisputed queen of the overseas press corps, the first woman to head a foreign news bureau of any importance&quot;.

During this time Thompson cultivated many literary friends, particularly among exiled German authors. Among her acquaintances from this period were Ödön von Horváth, Thomas Mann, Bertolt Brecht, Stefan Zweig and Fritz Kortner. She developed a close friendship with author Carl Zuckmayer. In Berlin she got involved in a lesbian affair with German author Christa Winsloe, while still married, claiming &quot;the right to love&quot;.

Thompson&#x27;s most significant work abroad took place in Germany in the early 1930s. In Munich, Thompson met and interviewed Adolf Hitler for the first time in 1931. This would be the basis for her subsequent book, &quot;I Saw Hitler&quot;, in which she wrote about the dangers of him winning power in Germany. Later, in a &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; article in December 1934, Thompson described Hitler in the following terms: &quot;He is formless, almost faceless, a man whose countenance is a caricature, a man whose framework seems cartilaginous, without bones. He is inconsequent and voluble, ill poised and insecure. He is the very prototype of the little man.&quot;

Biographer Kurth wrote: &quot;Later, when the full force of Nazism had crashed over Europe, Thompson was asked to defend her &#x27;Little Man&#x27; remark. &#x27;I still believe he is a little man,&#x27; she replied. &#x27;He is the apotheosis of the little man.&#x27; Nazism itself was &#x27;the apotheosis of collective mediocrity in all its forms.&#x27; &quot;

=== Expulsion from Germany ===
Fellow correspondent and friend William L. Shirer once commented on Dorothy Thompson&#x27;s &quot;love for Germany, which was passionate but — as she wrote once — frustrated.&quot; Her anti-Nazi journalism and, in particular, her depiction of Hitler in her book, &quot;I Saw Hitler,&quot; led to her becoming the first American journalist to be expelled from Germany. On August 25, 1934, she received the expulsion order, delivered by a Gestapo agent to her hotel room in the Hotel Adlon, Berlin. She was given 24 hours to leave the country. Thompson did so on August 26. Numerous journalists gathered to see her off at the train station, who gave her bunches of American Beauty roses to show their solidarity.

Thompson&#x27;s expulsion received extensive international attention, including a front page story on the New York Times. Biographer Peter Kurth said &quot;her expulsion from Berlin had turned her overnight into a kind of heroine – a celebrity of note, the dramatic embodiment of the nascent war against fascism.&quot;

===At the &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot;===
In 1936, Thompson began to write &quot;On the Record&quot;, a &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; newspaper column that was also syndicated nationwide. It was read by over ten million people and carried by more than 170 papers. With a new column appearing three times a week, the feature lasted, uninterrupted, for 22 years.

She also wrote a monthly column for the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; for 24 years, from 1937 to 1961. Its topics were far removed from war and politics, focusing on gardening, children, art, and other domestic and women&#x27;s-interest topics.

===Radio and the Herschel Grynszpan affair===
Around the time when she started to write &quot;On the Record&quot;, NBC hired Thompson as a news commentator. Her radio broadcasts on the network from 1936 to 1938 would become some of the most popular radio broadcasts in the United States, making her one of the most sought after female public speakers of her time. When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, Thompson went on the air for fifteen consecutive days and nights.

In 1938, Thompson championed the cause of a Polish-German Jewish teenager, Herschel Grynszpan, whose assassination of a minor German diplomat, Ernst vom Rath, in Paris, had been used as propaganda to trigger the events of Kristallnacht in Germany by the Nazis. Thompson&#x27;s broadcast on NBC radio was heard by millions of listeners, and it led to an outpouring of sympathy for the young assassin. Under the banner of the Journalists&#x27; Defense Fund, more than $40,000 was collected, enabling the famous European lawyer Vincent de Moro-Giafferi to take up Grynszpan&#x27;s case.

===Fame and controversy===
By 1939, Thompson was one of the most respected women of her age and as a result, she was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; along with a picture of her speaking into an NBC radio microphone, captioned &quot;She rides in the smoking car&quot;. The article declared that &quot;she and Eleanor Roosevelt are undoubtedly the most influential women in the U.S.&quot; and explained Thompson&#x27;s influence: &quot;Dorothy Thompson is the U.S. clubwoman&#x27;s woman. She is read, believed and quoted by millions of women who used to get their political opinions from their husbands, who got them from Walter Lippmann.&quot; In &quot;Woman of the Year&quot; (1942) Katharine Hepburn played Tess Harding, a foreign correspondent modeled on Thompson. The 1981 Broadway musical adaptation starred Lauren Bacall as Tess.

During the 1936 United States presidential election, Thompson characterized Black voters as a bloc which was &quot;notoriously venal. Ignorant and illiterate, the vast mass of Negroes are like the lower strata of the early industrial immigrants, and like them, they are &#x27;bossed&#x27; and &#x27;delivered&#x27; in blocs by venal leaders, both white and black.&quot;

In 1941, Thompson wrote &quot;Who Goes Nazi?&quot; for &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;.

=== Zionism and the State of Israel ===
Thompson had been sympathetic to the Zionist movement since she first travelled to Europe in 1920. During her visit, she had &quot;endless discussions&quot; about the movement with delegates who were traveling to the International Zionist Conference which was then being held in London. In the late 1930s, as Thompson emerged as a leading advocate for Jewish refugees who were fleeing from persecution in Europe, she grew close to the Zionist statesman Chaim Weizmann and she also grew close to Meyer Weisgal, Chaim Weizmann&#x27;s lieutenant in the US. As World War II unfolded, Thompson went from being a sympathetic commentator to being an outright advocate for the movement. She was a keynote speaker at the 1942 Biltmore Conference, and by the war&#x27;s end, she was regarded as one of the most effective spokespersons for Zionism. However, Thompson&#x27;s attitude towards the movement had already begun to shift, most especially after a 1945 trip to Palestine, because she grew more concerned about the activities of the movement&#x27;s right-wing adherents, she was especially troubled by its escalating terrorism against the British. After penning several columns which were critical of right wing Zionist terrorism, Thompson provoked a tremendous backlash that ultimately led her to cooperate with the leaders of the Jewish anti-Zionist organization, the American Council for Judaism. 

She wrote a critique of American Zionism in &quot;Commentary&quot; in 1950, accusing Zionists of dual loyalty, A response in &quot;Commentary&quot; by Oscar Handlin criticised her &quot;totalitarian&quot; understanding of national identity in demanding single loyalty. After her &quot;Commentary&quot; article, the backlash against her grew more intense. This included accusations of antisemitism, which Thompson strongly rebuffed, after being warned that hostility toward Israel was, in the American press world, &quot;almost a definition of professional suicide&quot;. She eventually concluded that Zionism was a recipe for perpetual war. As Thompson&#x27;s distance from the Zionist movement grew, she became an advocate for Palestinian refugees. After she travelled to the Middle East in 1950, Thompson was involved in the founding of the American Friends of the Middle East, an organization which was secretly funded by the CIA.

Lyndsey Stonebridge wrote in 2017 that There can be no doubt that anti-Semitism was a theme in Thompson’s later writing. Pathologizing Jewishness, in particular, became habitual for her in the 1950s. By May 25, 1950, she is writing to Maury M. Travis, darkly, of the “tragic psychosis of the Jew”... In the &quot;Commentary&quot; piece she warns: “We bring on what we fear. Any psychologist will tell you that a primary neurosis is the fear of rejection and that when that neurosis takes hold of a person he unconsciously strives to create the conditions for that rejection.” The reference is to Jewish “neurosis,” but the passage also rather elegantly describes the logic of Thompson’s own fears. In what well may be a case of knowing your addressee, Thompson wrote to Winston Churchill in 1951: “I have become convinced that the Jews, phenomenally brilliant individually and especially in the realm of abstract thought, are collectively the stupidest people on earth. I think it must come from cultural inbreeding—perhaps physical inbreeding also—in a desire to retain a homogenous, in-group society in the midst of ‘aliens.’

==Personal life==

She was married three times, most notably, to her second husband, the Nobel Prize in Literature winner Sinclair Lewis. In 1923, she married her first husband, Hungarian Joseph Bard; they divorced in 1927.

Thompson met Lewis on July 8, 1927, at an afternoon tea at the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin, held by German Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann. The two arranged a dinner the following day, which was both Dorothy&#x27;s 34th birthday and the day when her divorce from Bard was finalized.

In 1928, she married Lewis and acquired a house in Vermont. They had one son, Michael Lewis, born in 1930. The couple divorced in 1942.

She married her third husband, the artist Maxim Kopf, in 1943, and their marriage lasted until Kopf&#x27;s death in 1958.

Thompson died in 1961, at the age of 67, in Lisbon, Portugal, and she is buried in the town cemetery of Barnard, Vermont.

<text>USS &quot;Bernadou&quot; (DD–153) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. She was named for Commander John Bernadou. &quot;Bernadou&quot; was launched on 7 November 1918 by William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship and Engine Building Company, Philadelphia. The ship was sponsored by Miss Cora Winslow Bernadou, Commander Bernadou&#x27;s sister. The destroyer was commissioned on 19 May 1919.

==Service history==
Following a cruise to Europe in mid-1919, &quot;Bernadou&quot; joined Division 19, Atlantic Fleet, and cruised along the east coast until placed out of commission at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 1 July 1922. She joined Squadron 7, Scouting Force, after recommissioning on 1 May 1930. Out of service September 1936-October 1939, she then rejoined the fleet for service with Destroyer Division 6, Atlantic Squadron, on Neutrality Patrol.

She helped convoy the Marines to Iceland (1 July 1941 – 7 July 1941) and, except for one crossing to Britain, remained on the Newfoundland-Iceland convoy run until late 1942. On 5 February 1942 &quot;Bernadou&quot; rescued ten surviving men in an open lifeboat in the North Atlantic, from the ship SS Gandia, after being sunk by 14 days previously. Eight men had froze to death in the lifeboat of 18 men.

On 25 October 1942 she departed Norfolk, Virginia to take part in the invasion of North Africa (8–11 November). She won a Presidential Unit Citation for landing assault troops inside the harbor of Safi, French Morocco.

Returning to Boston on 26 November she remained on east coast convoy duty until February 1943. &quot;Bernadou&quot; made a convoy run to Gibraltar during March and April and on 10 May departed Norfolk for Oran, Algeria. She operated from Oran until December 1943 during which time she screened the Amphibious Battle of Gela during the occupation of Sicily (9–12 July); took part in the Salerno landings (9–10 September and 21–23 September), and escorted Mediterranean convoys.

She returned to the United States in December 1943 and escorted two convoys to North Africa (22 February 1944 – 9 June 1944) before retiring to the less rigorous east coast-Caribbean runs. From October 1944 to May 1945, she served as plane guard and escort vessel during carrier exercises off the east coast. She arrived at Philadelphia Navy Yard on 8 June 1945 and was decommissioned on 17 July. The destroyer was sold for scrap on 30 November 1945.

==Awards==
In addition to her Presidential Unit Citation, &quot;Bernadou&quot; received five battle stars for her World War II service.

As of 2004, no other ship in the United States Navy has borne this name.

<doc id="1098995" wikidata="Q147866" url="?curid=1098995" title="2159 Kukkamäki">
<text>2159 Kukkamäki, provisional designation , is a stony asteroid from the inner region of the asteroid belt, approximately 11 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 16 October 1941, by Finnish astronomer Liisi Oterma at Turku Observatory in Southwest Finland. It was later named after Finnish geodesist Tauno Kukkamäki.

== Orbit and classification ==

&quot;Kukkamäki&quot; is a stony S-type asteroid. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.4–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 11 months (1,429 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.04 and an inclination of 3° with respect to the ecliptic. &quot;Kukkamäki&quot; was first identified as at Lowell Observatory in 1929, extending the body&#x27;s observation arc by 12 prior to its official discovery observation.

== Diameter and albedo ==

According to the survey carried out by NASA&#x27;s Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, &quot;Kukkamäki&quot; measures between 9.86 and 12.14 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.193 and 0.337, while the &quot;Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link&quot; assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and derives a diameter of 11.30 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.1.

== Lightcurve ==

During an asteroid survey conducted at McDonald Observatory and CTIO in the 1980s, a rotational lightcurve of &quot;Kukkamäki&quot; was obtained by astronomer Richard Binzel. The photoelectric observation gave a well-defined rotation period of 4.06 hours with a brightness variation of 0.32 magnitude (), superseding a previous result based on a fragmentary lightcurve.

== Naming ==

This minor planet was named after Finnish geodesist Tauno Kukkamäki (1909–1997), who was the director of the Finnish Geodetic Institute for many years and the president of the International Association of Geodesy. He was also a distinguished disciple of Yrjö Väisälä. The official naming citation was published by the Minor Planet Center on 1 November 1979 ().

<doc id="1098999" wikidata="Q7426789" url="?curid=1098999" title="Saturn I4 engine">
<text>The powerplant used in Saturn S-Series automobiles was a straight-4 aluminum piston engine produced by Saturn, a subsidiary of General Motors. The engine was only used in the Saturn S-series line of vehicles (SL, SC, SW) from 1991 through 2002. It was available in chain-driven SOHC or DOHC variants.

This was an innovative engine for the time using the lost foam casting process for the engine block and cylinder head. Saturn was one of the first to use this casting process in a full-scale high-production environment. Both engine types used the same engine block.

==Engine block==
The engine utilized a water-cooled aluminum block. The main bearing caps were made of ductile iron and held in place with two bolts each. The cylinder block bores had interference fit cast iron liners for the piston rings to sit against. The engine block was made from 319.1 aluminum alloy and the liners were made from grey iron.

===Crankshaft===
The crankshaft was supported by five main bearings with thrust taken at the middle bearing. 1991 and 1992 engines had a different crankshaft from 1993 and later engines, whose crankshafts had reluctor ring slots advanced ten degrees for easier starting. 1991 to 1998 crankshafts incorporated four counterweights, while those from 1999 to 2002 incorporated eight.

===Connecting rods and pistons===
From 1991 to 1998 the connecting rods were forged steel with standard type crank pin bearings. SOHC engines during that period used a dished piston design whereas the twin cam engines used a flat top piston with 2 recesses for the intake valves. Twin cam pistons received several re-designs throughout the production run aimed at reducing oil consumption issues. These included reducing the clearance between the top of the piston and the first compression ring, redesigning the skirts on the pistons and the oiling ports on the bottom of the pistons. For the 1999 model year all pistons were totally redesigned. Both engines used the flat top pistons with 2 valve recesses and featured a new hypereutectic design with coated skirts. Also for 1999 all connecting rods switched to a slightly longer powder forged design and cracked bearing caps. The piston pins floated in the connecting rod bushings. The pistons were cast aluminum alloy with the piston pins being retained with snap rings.

===Timing chain===
The timing chain was hydraulic tensioned and had a ratchet mechanism to keep the chain tight. The timing chain rode on one pivoting chain guide resting on the ratchet tensioner and one fixed guide attached to the engine block and cylinder head. The 1991 to 1998 DOHC engine had an upper timing chain guide in between the camshaft sprockets. The timing chain was lubricated via cast-off from the top of the cylinder head and one &#x27;squirter&#x27; on the oil pump housing. The SOHC, 1991-1998 DOHC, and 1999-2002 DOHC engines all used different timing chain sets.

==SOHC LK0/L24==
The SOHC (LK0/L24) cylinder head had 8 valves and was made of lost foam cast aluminum. The camshaft was located in the center of the cylinder head and driven by a chain off the front crankshaft sprocket. Motion from the camshaft was transmitted to the eight valves by the hydraulic lifters and rocker arms.

The SOHC engine was used in the base model S-series vehicles (SC1, SL, SL1, SW1)

The LK0 engine first used TBI (Throttle Body Injection) for fuel delivery and was rated at at 5000 rpm and at 2400 rpm from 1991 to 1994.

The L24 engine received MPFI (Multi-Port Fuel Injection) in 1995 which increased power output to at 5000 rpm and at 2400 rpm. In 1999, these engines switched from the recessed top pistons of the previous models to all new flat top pistons that were also used in the twin cam models. The cylinder head was also redesigned to keep the compression ratio at 8.8:1 even with the flat top pistons and now featured provisions for an air injection reaction system. This engine was used from 1995 to 2002.

Some 1992 through 1998 L24 cylinder heads developed cracks in the fifth camshaft journal, located closest to #4 cylinder. The hairline crack would form between the oil feed port of that journal and the coolant passages in the cylinder head. Symptoms would range from overheating to low coolant, however, most cars affected by this issue exhibited oil migration into the cooling system. The resulting mixture of the two fluids would result in a thick brown &quot;milkshake&quot;-like mixture, visible in the coolant overflow tank.

Saturn released unadvertised policy which would cover this issue, extending the warranty on the cylinder head to 6 years or . Repair required the replacement of the cylinder head. and flushing of the coolant system. Badly affected cars would see coolant in the oil, as well as oil in the coolant, and would require the replacement of the complete engine assembly. Until the cylinder head casting was redesigned some time in 1998, some vehicles would require this repair more than once, and replacement cylinder heads could develop the same crack.

It was estimated that between 2% and 5% of SOHC Saturn S-Series vehicles were affected by this defect. DOHC engines had a different cylinder head, and did not suffer the same issue.

==DOHC LL0==

The 1991-1998 DOHC cylinder head had 16 valves and was made of lost foam cast aluminium. The camshafts were held in the cylinder head with bearing caps and driven by a chain off the front crankshaft sprocket. Motion from the camshafts was transmitted to the 16 valves by direct-acting hydraulic lifters.

LL0 cylinder heads were changed slightly in 1995, when Saturn adopted electronic, linear EGR mechanisms, over the previous vacuum actuated design. The head casting was changed to accommodate different mounting surface of the new valve. (1994 CA emissions engines used an adapter to mount the LEGR valve.) 

A new LL0 cylinder head appeared in 1999 using a roller camshaft with hydraulic lifters and rocker arms, but power was unchanged. Also for 1999 provisions for a new air injection reaction system was introduced aimed at improving engine emissions.

All LL0 engines used MPFI and were rated at at 6000 rpm and at 4800 rpm. The DOHC engine was used in the upper-level model S-series vehicles (SC, SC2, SL2, SW2).

<text>The AAR wheel arrangement system is a method of classifying locomotive (or unit) wheel arrangements that was developed by the Association of American Railroads. Essentially a simplification of the European UIC classification, it is widely used in North America to describe diesel and electric locomotives (including third-rail electric locomotives). It is not used for steam locomotives, which use the Whyte notation instead (except geared steam locomotives, which are instead classified by their model and their number of trucks).

The AAR system (like UIC) counts axles, unlike Whyte, which counts wheels. Letters refer to powered axles, and numbers to unpowered (or idler) axles. &quot;A&quot; refers to one powered axle, &quot;B&quot; to two powered axles in a row, &quot;C&quot; to three powered axles in a row, and &quot;D&quot; to four powered axles in a row. &quot;1&quot; refers to one idler axle, and &quot;2&quot; to two idler axles in a row. A dash (&quot;–&quot;) separates trucks or wheel assemblies. A plus sign (&quot;+&quot;) refers to articulation, either by connecting bogies with span bolsters or by connecting individual locomotives via solid drawbars instead of couplers.

==1A-A1==
&quot;1A-A1&quot; means there are two trucks (or wheel assemblies) under the unit. Each truck has one powered axle and one idler axle, with the idler axles to the outside. Examples include Budd RDC diesel multiple unit (DMU) cars.

==1B-1B==
&quot;1B-1B&quot; means there are two trucks with a leading idler axle in front of two powered axles. This arrangement was used to upgrade the B-B arrangement of two EMC 1800 hp B-B locomotives owned by the Santa Fe Railroad in 1938, for greater stability at speed.

==1-D==
&quot;1-D&quot; means there are two trucks or groups of axles; the &quot;1&quot; truck is under the front of the unit, and has one idler axle. The remaining 4 axles are rigidly mounted to the frame behind this lead truck (or grouped in a second truck). This is roughly the equivalent of a 2-8-0 Consolidation in the Whyte notation, particularly when built as a 1-truck/4 rigid axle locomotive. The only known examples are a series of diesel boxcab locomotives built and owned by the Texas Mexican Railway.

==2-A1A==
&quot;2-A1A&quot; means there are two trucks or wheel assemblies. The &quot;2&quot; truck is under the front of the unit, and has two idler axles in a row. The &quot;A1A&quot; truck is under the rear of the unit, and has one powered axle, one idler axle, and one more powered axle. An example is the FM OP800 railcar, six of which were built by the St. Louis Car Company exclusively for the Southern Railway in 1939.

==2-B==
&quot;2-B&quot; means there are two trucks or wheel assemblies. The &quot;2&quot; truck is under the front of the unit, and has two idler axles in a row. The &quot;B&quot; truck is under the rear of the unit, and has two powered axles. Examples include the three lightweight power cars built by ALCO/ACF in 1935 and 1937 for use with the Rebel streamliners.

==3-A1A==
&quot;3-A1A&quot; means there are two trucks or wheel assemblies. The &quot;3&quot; truck is under the front of the unit, and has three idler axles in a row. The &quot;A1A&quot; truck is under the rear of the unit, and has one powered axle, one idler axle, and one more powered axle. An example is the later built FM OP800 railcar, six of which were built by the St. Louis Car Company exclusively for the Southern Railway in 1939.

==A1-1A==
&quot;A1-1A&quot; means there are two trucks or wheel assemblies under the unit. Each truck has one powered axle and one idler axle, with the powered axles to the outside.

==A1A-2==
&quot;A1A-2&quot; means there are two trucks. The &quot;A1A&quot; truck is under the front of the unit, and has one powered axle, one idler axle, and one more powered axle. The &quot;2&quot; truck is under the back of the unit, and has two idler axles in a row. An example is the &quot;Silver Charger&quot; power car for the General Pershing Zephyr.

==A1A-3==
&quot;A1A-3&quot; means there are two trucks. The &quot;A1A&quot; truck is under the front of the unit, and has one powered axle, one idler axle, and one more powered axle. The &quot;3&quot; truck is under the back of the unit, and has three idler axles in a row. An example is the Baldwin DR-6-2-10 cab unit, only one of which was built for the Chicago and North Western Railway in 1948.

==A1A-A1A==
&quot;A1A-A1A&quot; means there are two trucks under the locomotive. Each truck has two powered axles, with an idler axle between them. This spreads the weight of the locomotive more evenly over the track and counteracts the tendency of trucks to oscillate at high speeds, which is a problem with two axle trucks. The idler wheels may be smaller than the powered wheels.

Examples of locomotives with this wheel arrangement include the EMD E-units and ALCO PAs, which were high speed passenger locomotives, and the dual service FM Erie-built. BNSF took delivery of ES44C4 locomotives with this type of truck in 2009. In the UK, the Class 31 uses this wheel arrangement.

==A1A-B+B==
&quot;A1A-B+B&quot; means there are three trucks. The first truck has three axles, with the center one unpowered. A pair of two-axle trucks, each with both axles powered, are connected by a span bolster under the rear of the unit. The only example to date of this arrangement was a single experimental EMD SDP45.

==B==
&quot;B&quot; means there are two powered axles under the unit. These axles are not articulated relative to other parts of the locomotive. This arrangement is only used on very small locomotives, such as the EMD Model 40. It is also used on speeders. This arrangement is sometimes referred to as 0-4-0, the Whyte notation equivalent.

==B-1==
&quot;B-1&quot; means there are two trucks. The &quot;B&quot; truck is under the front of the unit, and has two powered axles. The &quot;1&quot; truck is under the back of the unit, and has one idler axle. Examples include the three EMD LWT12 locomotives built by EMD in 1956.

== B1-1B==
The EMD GT46PAC (WDP-4) Passenger-hauling diesel locomotive of Indian Railways, Ten initial units of which were built in 2000-01 by the then GM-owned EMD, initially had this configuration, for better acceleration and speeds, after which every Indian-built WDP-4 had this configuration, until it was developed into &quot;WDP-4B&quot;, with a C-C configuration. Twenty SD70ACe-P4 locomotives were built by EMD with a B1-1B arrangement that has two three axle trucks with each truck having two AC traction motors and one idler axle nearest the fuel tank. The locomotive was designed as an AC traction alternative to the SD70M-2 that uses three DC traction motors on each of two three axle trucks. Only BNSF ordered the model in 2014. The other locomotive with this wheel arrangement is the EMD SD70MACH, which is an SD70MAC rebuilt by Progress Rail for Metra and used for passenger service. In 2020, Metra approved of the purchase of 15 of these locomotives with options to purchase up to 27 more.

==B-2==
&quot;B-2&quot; means there are two trucks. The &quot;B&quot; truck is under the front of the unit, and has two powered axles. The &quot;2&quot; truck is under the back of the unit, and has two idler axles in a row. Examples include the three lightweight RP-210 locomotives built by Baldwin in 1956 and 1957 for use with Pullman-Standard Train-X equipment.

==B-A1A==
&quot;B-A1A&quot; means there are two trucks. The &quot;B&quot; truck is under the front of the unit, and has two powered axles. The &quot;A1A&quot; truck is under the back of the unit, and has one powered axle, one idler axle, and one more powered axle. Examples include some of the FM C-liners (most passenger units) built from 1950 to 1955, and the EMD FL9.

==B-B==
&quot;B-B&quot; means there are two identical trucks. Each truck has two powered axles, a currently popular configuration used in high-speed, low-weight applications such as intermodal trains and high-speed rail, as well as switcher locomotives. Examples include the EMD GP (General Purpose), EMD F-units, EMD SW1500, &quot;Acela Express&quot; Power Cars, Siemens Charger, Siemens ACS-64 and GE Genesis units. High speed (&quot;time&quot;) freight trains, with guaranteed schedules often use B-B locomotives of 3,800 HP (950 HP per axle), but this application, too, has largely been replaced by higher-powered, 4,500 HP C-C locomotives (750 HP per axle). An American colloquialism of &quot;B-B&quot; is &quot;Four axle&quot;.

==B-2-B==
&quot;B-2-B&quot; means there are three trucks. The center truck has two unpowered axles and the truck at each end has two powered axles. The locomotive frame must either articulate or allow for significant side play to be provided to the center truck. Examples of this type were built as light rail vehicles.

==B-B-B==
&quot;B-B-B&quot; means there are three trucks. Each truck has two powered axles. The locomotive frame must either articulate or allow for significant side play to be provided to the center truck. The Russian VL85 and US-American EMD GM10B was a notable example. See also Bo-Bo-Bo.

==B+B+B==
&quot;B+B+B&quot; means there are three articulated sets of two powered axles each under the unit. The locomotive frame must allow for significant side play to be provided to the center axle set, as well as allowing for end play for the end sets. The ten Mexican Railway GE boxcab electrics of 1923 are examples of this wheel arrangement.

==2-B+B-2==
&quot;2-B+B-2&quot; means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two idler axles, and inboard of it are two powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The PRR DD1 and DD2 electric locomotives used this arrangement.

==2-B+B+B+B-2==
&quot;2-B+B+B+B-2&quot; means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two idler axles, and inboard of it are two powered axles, hinged to yet another set of two powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. Examples include the Milwaukee Road EF-1 &quot;Boxcab&quot; electrics.

==B+B-B+B==
&quot;B+B-B+B&quot; means there are four trucks under the unit. Within each truck, there are two powered axles, and pairs of them are connected by span bolsters. One example would be the General Electric U50, built from 1963 to 1965. The 4500 horsepower (3.4 MW) turbine locomotives built by GE for Union Pacific also used this arrangement. The EFVM railway of Brazil uses narrow gauge GE &quot;BB&quot; locomotives with this arrangement, both with &quot;standard&quot; and wide cabs. A GE Dash 9-40BBW, for instance, is a wide cab GE Dash 9-40CW series locomotive with a B+B-B+B wheel arrangement. The EMD SD70ACe-BB produced from 2015 onward also has a B+B-B+B arrangement.

==B-B+B-B==
&quot;B-B+B-B&quot; means that the locomotive has four trucks. Each truck contains two powered axles. The middle pair of trucks are connected by a span bolster. In most cases, the locomotive is articulated over the span bolster. The Union Pacific&#x27;s M-10002 diesel streamliner and New York Central&#x27;s T-Motor third-rail electric locomotives are examples of this type. This arrangement also includes locomotives made of two permanently coupled B-B units, such as some EMD FT units which had a solid drawbar connecting two units instead of the typical couplers.

==B-B-B-B==
&quot;B-B-B-B&quot; means there are four trucks. Each truck has two powered axles. The locomotive frame must allow for significant side play to be provided to the center trucks.

==B-B+B-B+B-B==
&quot;B-B+B-B+B-B&quot; means that the locomotive has six trucks. Each truck contains two powered axles. The only known locomotives to have this configuration were the two EMD TR3 locomotives made of three permanently coupled B-B units, which had solid drawbars connecting the units instead of the typical couplers.

==C==
&quot;C&quot; means there are three powered axles under the unit. They are not articulated relative to other parts of the locomotive. This arrangement is only used on very small locomotives (e.g. the PRR B1). This arrangement is sometimes referred to as 0-6-0, the Whyte notation equivalent.

==C-B==
&quot;C-B&quot; means there are two trucks. The &quot;C&quot; truck is under the front of the unit, and has three powered axles. The &quot;B&quot; truck is under the rear of the unit, and has two powered axles. The Japanese DE10, DE11, and DE15 and the British Rail Class 28 are the only locomotives to use this wheel arrangement.

==C-C==
&quot;C-C&quot; means there are two identical trucks. Each truck has three powered axles. Examples include the EMD SD (Special Duty), GMD GF6C, EMD GM6C, PRR E44, GE E60, Virginian EL-C and GE Evolution Series units, except the ES44C4 and ET44C4 which use the A1A-A1A wheel arrangement. This is a currently popular configuration used in low-speed, high-weight applications, such as unit coal trains. General (&quot;manifest&quot;) freight trains also use C-C locomotives. See also Co-Co. An American colloquialism of &quot;C-C&quot; is &quot;Six axle&quot;.

==1-C+C-1==
&quot;1-C+C-1&quot; means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with one idler axle, and inboard of it are three powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The PRR FF1 and FF2 electric locomotives used this arrangement.

==2-C+C-2==
&quot;2-C+C-2&quot; means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two idler axles, and inboard of it are three powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The Pennsylvania Railroad&#x27;s GG1 and Companhia Paulista&#x27;s electric locomotives were notable examples of this arrangement.

==2+C-C+2==
&quot;2+C-C+2&quot; means there are two sets of axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a guiding truck with two idler axles, and inboard of this, and hinged to it, is a truck with three powered axles. The GE steam turbine-electric locomotives of 1939 were notable examples of this arrangement.

==2-C1+2-C1-B==

&quot;2-C1+2-C1-B&quot; means there are five trucks. Only the first three axles on the four-axle trucks were powered, as were both axles in the last truck; the first and middle trucks had two unpowered axles each. The only examples of this arrangement were three unique coal-fired steam-turbine locomotives built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works for the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway between 1947 and 1948. This locomotive is sometimes called the M-1.

==C-C+C-C==
&quot;C-C+C-C&quot; means there are four trucks under the unit. Each truck has three powered axles. The only examples of this type were the 8500 horsepower (6.3 MW) turbine locomotives built by General Electric for Union Pacific. These locomotives consisted of two permanently coupled C-C units.

==C+C-C+C==
&quot;C+C-C+C&quot; means there are four trucks. Each truck has three powered axles and pairs of them are connected by span bolsters. This arrangement was used on the &quot;Jawn Henry&quot; coal-fired steam-turbine locomotive built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works for the Norfolk &amp; Western Railway in May, 1954.

==1-D-1==
&quot;1-D-1&quot; means there are three trucks under the unit. At either end are trucks with one idler axle; the center truck has four powered axles. The original 1904–1909 New York Central S-Motor third-rail electric locomotives (for the Grand Central Terminal electrification) and the Great Northern Z-1 electric locomotives (for the Cascade Tunnel electrification) used this arrangement.

==2-D-2==
&quot;2-D-2&quot; means there are three trucks. At either end are trucks with two idler axles; the center truck has four powered axles. The PRR R1 electric locomotive used this arrangement.

== 2-D+D-2 ==
&quot;2-D+D-2&quot; means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, theare is a truck with two idler axles, and inboard of it are four powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The Little Joes, Baldwin DR-12-8-1500/2, and Baldwin 4-8+8-4-750/8-DE locomotives used this arrangement.

==D-D==

&quot;D-D&quot; means there are two trucks each with four powered axles. Examples include the EMD DD units.

D-D locomotives have fallen out of favor as nearly all of these were twin-engined locomotives, which placed too much horsepower in too few axles which made these consists rather inflexible (each locomotive featured two prime movers, making each unit essentially a pair of high-powered B-B locomotives on a common frame as far as traction and power was concerned). In fact, a usual consist of a D-D unit included a leading C-C unit and a trailing C-C unit, for a total of about (with four total prime-movers).

With today&#x27;s higher horsepower C-C units (about apiece), three such C-C units exceeds the total power of the usual D-D consist by (with one fewer prime-mover than a usual D-D consist, thereby significantly improving reliability and dramatically reducing maintenance).

Although the D-D arrangement is associated with twin-prime-mover locomotives of high power, this does not mean a D-D with a single high-power prime mover may be built in the future, nor does it exclude two-truck, eight-axle electric locomotive. The EMD DDM45 is a narrow-gauge adaptation of the SD45, which required additional axles due to using smaller traction motors.

==2-D+D-2==
&quot;2-D+D-2&quot; means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two idler axles, and inboard of it are four powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. Examples include the Baldwin DR-12-8-1500/2 &quot;Centipede&quot; diesel locomotives and the GE &quot;Little Joe&quot; electric locomotives.

==B-D+D-B==
&quot;B-D+D-B&quot; means there are two sets of articulated axles under the unit. Within each of these sets, there is a truck with two powered axles, and inboard of it are four powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The W-1 class of electric locomotives built by General Electric for the Great Northern Railway used this arrangement.

==1B+D+D+B1==
&quot;1B+D+D+B1&quot; means there are four sets of articulated axles under the unit. At each end, there is one unpowered axle and two powered axles, hinged to a set of four powered axles. Two of these articulated sets are placed back to back and connected by a hinge. The &quot;Bi-Polar&quot; electric locomotives used by the Milwaukee Road used this arrangement.

==(B+B-B+B)+(B+B-B+B)==
&quot;(B+B-B+B)+(B+B-B+B)&quot; means there are 2 units, each with 4 trucks in a B+B-B+B wheel arrangement. An example was the Virginian Railway&#x27;s EL-2B electric locomotives.

<text>A gybe preventer, preventer, or jibe-guard, is a mechanical device on a sailing vessel which limits the boom&#x27;s ability to swing unexpectedly across the boat due to an unplanned accidental jibe.

During an unplanned accidental jibe (or &quot;gybe&quot;), neither the crew nor the boat is set up properly to execute a planned jibe. As a result, the uncontrolled boom will swing across the boat potentially inflicting injury or knocking crew members overboard. The mainsheet or traveller can also inflict serious injury. Uncontrolled jibes may also damage the boat itself.

Rigging a preventer on a yacht&#x27;s mainsail is often performed when the wind is behind the beam (i.e. when it&#x27;s coming from more than 90° off the bow). It can also be useful at other times when there is more swell than wind, a situation when the wind may not have the strength to keep the boom in place as the boat dips and rolls.

On any boat that is sailing downwind without a preventer, strict &#x27;heads-down&#x27; procedures must be enforced anywhere within the boom&#x27;s arc. Certain areas of the side-decks and maybe the cockpit also have to be strictly &#x27;no-go&#x27; to all crew depending on what the boom and mainsheet could do in unchecked full swing.

The preventer with the most mechanical advantage is a line, from the end of the boom, led outside the shrouds and a long way forward - perhaps right up to the bow - through a block, back to the cockpit and secured within reach of the mainsheet.

Many cruising sailors prefer to rig two tackles (port and starboard) 
that run from the midpoint of the boom to blocks on a track such as the 
headsail-sheet-block track. These tackles are typically a 2 - 4 part tackles
for greater purchase. This rig can also be used as a boom vang without taking up space under
the mast that may be essential to the cruising sailor for dinghy stowage and other uses.
There is a possibility of breaking the main boom with a preventer rig such as this,
but many modern yachts are considered to have short enough booms and be beamy enough to overlook this possibility in normal use. For example, while running with the preventer cleated, a large swell could roll the boat, dipping the boom end into the water, snapping the boom in half.

Care should be taken when selecting the rope which is used for preventer lines.
To reduce the shock loads on the tackles, for example in an unexpected jibe, three-strand nylon line may be preferred over braided cored line.

==Boom Brake==

Another form of preventer is the boom brake, which, when sailing downwind, can also be used to jibe the mainsail in a slow, measured action. The brake usually rides on a line running perpendicular to, and below the boom. When the boom brake is actuated, friction on the line either works as a preventer (stops the boom from moving in the direction that would slacken the main sheet), or slows the boom&#x27;s speed while jibing. The brake is actuated by either tensioning the line upon which it rides or by using a second line to adjust the brake itself.

==Jibing==
When jibing a fully loaded mainsail in a following sea, the following procedure may be used. Using the steering, the stern of the boat is carefully brought up into the wind. Then the leeward, working preventer is released little by little, while the mainsheet is shortened to bring in the boom. It is important to maintain at least a turn or two around the preventer&#x27;s cleat the whole time ready to catch an early jibe during this stage of the manoeuvre. The mainsheet should pull the preventer around its cleat, without it being offered any slack. All the while it is also necessary to take in slack on the lazy preventer to keep it under control (i.e. prevent it getting tangled around something) until it is needed.

When the boom is as near as possible to midships (near to running fore-and-aft along the boat&#x27;s centreline), the working preventer is slackened, the lazy one tightened, and the mainsheet made very secure. It is important that all crew are safe from where the boom may swing, and a call of &quot;Jibe-ho&quot; is a traditional last warning for this. At this point, a slight steering adjustment will actually jibe the sail. The course of the boat may slew further than expected, which can be ignored as it gives a shorthanded crew time to do the next three things: Run out the mainsheet as fast as possible without burning the hands, ensuring that the newly-lazy preventer runs free, then tighten in and secure the newly working preventer.

<text>USS &quot;Ellis&quot; (DD–154) was a in the United States Navy during World War II. She was reclassified AG-115 on 30 June 1945. She was named for Chief Yeoman George Henry Ellis.

&quot;Ellis&quot; was launched on 30 November 1918 by William Cramp &amp; Sons, Philadelphia, sponsored by Mrs. E. T. Stotesbury. The destroyer was commissioned on 7 June 1919.

==Service history==
&quot;Ellis&quot;″s first cruise, between 16 June and 15 August 1919, was to the Black Sea, carrying United States Food Administration officials for famine relief work, and British and American military officers between Constantinople, Turkey; Varna, Bulgaria; and Batum, Georgia. She returned to a year of exercises on the east coast and in the Caribbean Sea. From 29 September 1920 to 16 March 1921 she was in reserve at Charleston. She sailed north to fire test torpedoes off Newport, lay again at Charleston from October 1921 through February 1922. On 27 February she entered Philadelphia Navy Yard, where she was out of commission from 17 June 1922 to 1 May 1930.

&quot;Ellis&quot; served with the Scouting Fleet along the east coast, off Panama and Cuba, and from March 1932 through October in exercises between San Diego and San Francisco. She was in rotating reserve at Norfolk and Boston in 1932 and 1933. In April 1933, she searched for , and found wreckage off the New Jersey coast. Based on New York through the summer of 1933, she escorted the Presidential yacht along the New England coast to Campobello, New Brunswick, where on 1 July she embarked President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his party, transferring them to the cruiser . She escorted &quot;Indianapolis&quot; to Annapolis, where the president again visited &quot;Ellis&quot; on 4 July. She also trained members of the Naval Reserve before departing New York 8 September for Key West.

The next year, &quot;Ellis&quot; cruised to Cuba, again escorted the president, this time in a private yacht, and on 24 October 1934 passed through the Panama Canal to be based on San Diego. Training operations took her to Alaska and Hawaii during the next year and a half, and on 7 June 1936 she returned to Miami for east coast reserve training duty until decommissioned at Philadelphia on 16 December 1936.

===World War II===
&quot;Ellis&quot; was recommissioned on 16 October 1939, and from her bases at Charleston and Norfolk, patrolled the east coast concentrating on anti-submarine warfare. Between 22 June and 21 July 1941, she sailed from Newport to escort transports carrying the first Marines to the occupation of Iceland, and a month later sailed to base at Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland for escort duty to Iceland and to mid-ocean rendezvous.

Returning at intervals to Boston for replenishment and repairs, she served thus until March 1942, when her operations were extended to the Virgin Islands. She escorted coastal convoys, on 15 July 1942 attacking a submarine off Cape Hatteras. From October 1942, she also guarded convoy routes between Trinidad and Brazil, and in March 1943 was assigned to transatlantic convoys.

On 12 October 1942, &quot;Ellis&quot; picked up the only German survivor of , &quot;Matrosengefreiter&quot; Franz Machen who had been floating on a raft for ten days, and held him in captivity.

Between 20 March 1943 and 25 June, &quot;Ellis&quot; escorted two top priority tanker convoys with Aruba oil for North Africa, then troop transports to Derry. From August to November, she twice guarded escort carriers ferrying Army planes to Ireland and North Africa. &quot;Ellis&quot; escorted to the Azores in January 1944, and while on patrol there rescued two downed British pilots. Returning to North African convoy duty, &quot;Ellis&quot; made two voyages from the east coast to Casablanca, Algiers, and Bizerte between February and June. On 11 May, off Bizerte, she was attacked by four bombers, three of which she had a hand in shooting down, and drove the fourth away.

The remainder of the war, &quot;Ellis&quot; guarded carriers training pilots, experimented with torpedo aircraft, twice made escort voyages to Recife, Brazil. She was decommissioned at Norfolk on 31 October 1945 and sold on 20 June 1947.

<doc id="1099025" wikidata="Q659555" url="?curid=1099025" title="Sirenia (band)">
<text>Sirenia is a Norwegian gothic metal band from Stavanger, founded in 2001 by Morten Veland.

The band uses melodic instrumentals, synthesizers, and distorted guitars with female vocals, male death vocals, clean male vocals, a choir, and violins. The lyrics are concerned with human existence, emotion, and mental states.

== History ==
=== 2001–2003: Formation and &quot;At Sixes and Sevens&quot; ===
In January 2001, Veland, a founding member of Tristania left the band, within a few weeks Veland had a new band along with three other members. He had written material for Tristania&#x27;s next release but because of the split, he used it towards Sirenia&#x27;s debut album &quot;At Sixes and Sevens&quot; with other new material written for it as well. The band entered the studio by November or December 2001. The band failed to find a suitable singer prior to recording in France, so they hired a session female singer named Fabienne Gondamin.

=== 2004–2007: &quot;An Elixir for Existence&quot; and &quot;Nine Destinies and a Downfall&quot; ===

On the subsequent tour Fabienne Gondamin was replaced by Henriette Bordvik, with whom the band recorded the album &quot;An Elixir for Existence&quot; and the EP &quot;Sirenian Shores&quot;.

The band signed with Nuclear Blast in May 2005.

In November 2005, Henriette Bordvik left the band, citing personal reasons.

In 2007 they released a third album – &quot;Nine Destinies and a Downfall&quot;. The album features new singer, Monika Pedersen from Denmark, who joined the band in April 2006, and new guitarist Bjørnar Landa (from Artifact), who joined the band during the recording.

On 5 November 2007 Monika Pedersen quit the band over musical disagreements. Her departure caused Sirenia to pull out of a planned European tour with Therion.

=== 2008–2011: &quot;The 13th Floor&quot; and &quot;The Enigma of Life&quot; ===
Sirenia began looking for a new singer in November 2007. The process in finding their newest member took about six months. About 500 applied, at the end they wanted to find someone from the EU region for practical reasons. On 9 April 2008 Sirenia announced Spanish &quot;X Factor&quot; contestant Ailyn as their new female vocalist.

On 19 May 2008 it was announced that Bjørnar Landa left the band in order to have more time for his family and studies. He was replaced by Michael S. Krumins (Green Carnation).

On 12 June 2008 Sirenia announced that for the first time in their career, they had decided to work with a bass player for their live shows. The session bass player would be Kristian Olav Torp.

Sirenia started recording their fourth album in July 2008. It was recorded in Sound Suite Studios, France and Stargoth Studios, Norway. The mixing and mastering took place in Antfarm Studios, Denmark with Tue Madsen. The album, called &quot;The 13th Floor&quot;, was completed in September and the release date was 23 January 2009. The album features guest appearances by Jan Kenneth Barkved. The first single, &quot;The Path to Decay&quot;, was released on 26 December 2008 as a digital download.
On 8 July 2010, the band announced that they had started recording a new album. It was finished in November, and is titled &quot;The Enigma of Life&quot;. It was released on 21 January 2011.

The first single, &quot;The End of It All&quot;, was released on 21 December 2010 as a digital download.
On 19 April 2011, Michael left Sirenia to put in more time on his own bands and projects. Jan Erik Soltvedt joined the band and filled in as the lead guitarist. Soltvedt accompanied Sirenia on their American and European tours in 2011, including the &quot;Gallus Sonorus Musicallis&quot; festival (GSM Fest) held in June 2011 in Barcelos, Portugal, and the &quot;Wacken Festival&quot; in Germany, held in August.

On 16 July 2011, one of their most important performances of that year was held at the famous heavy metal festival &quot;Masters of Rock&quot;, which takes place annually in the city of Vizovice, Czech Republic. Their only former appearance at the fsetival was in 2008.

By the end of July and the beginning of August 2011, Sirenia made their second Latin American tour, which took them back to countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and for the first time to Peru and Chile in October.

=== 2012–2016: &quot;Perils of the Deep Blue&quot;, &quot;The Seventh Life Path&quot; and Ailyn&#x27;s departure ===
On 16 October 2012 Sirenia announced that they had entered the studio to record their next album for an early 2013 release. The band said of the album &quot;The progress on the new album is going very well — we feel confident that the sixth Sirenia album will have some nice surprises up its sleeve, as we&#x27;ve been determined to make this record somewhat different from the previous two albums&quot;.

On 13 April 2013 the band announced the title of their album on their Facebook page: &quot;Perils of the Deep Blue&quot;. Their single &quot;Seven Widows Weep&quot; was released through Nuclear Blast on 12 May 2013. On 3 June 2013, the official music video of the song was released. It was filmed in April of the same year in Serbia by iCODE Team.

&quot;Perils of the Deep Blue&quot; represented the first Sirenia album in US charts, such as the Billboard Hard Rock Albums and the Heatseekers Albums.

The band announced they had returned to Napalm Records on 3 April 2014 with a pending album release for early 2015. On 10 February 2015 Sirenia announced the title of their next record called &quot;The Seventh Life Path&quot;. On 12 March 2015 the band announced on their Facebook page that Nightwatcher Films has signed Sirenia for the use of their song &quot;Ducere Me In Lucem&quot; of &quot;Perils of the Deep Blue&quot; for the opening title sequence of a film called Abandoned Dead, penned for release January 2016.

On 5 July 2016 Sirenia announced that after 8 years, Ailyn and the band were parting on good terms, but that the work with the upcoming album would proceed as normal. The same day, Ailyn released a statement disputing the band&#x27;s claim, saying that the decision was not hers and she was not a part of it.

=== 2016–2020: &quot;Dim Days of Dolor&quot;, new singer and &quot;Arcane Astral Aeons&quot; ===

On 29 August 2016 Sirenia revealed their eighth full-length album &quot;Dim Days of Dolor&quot; before their official announcement of their new singer.

On 8 September 2016 Sirenia announced their new singer Emmanuelle Zoldan, a French mezzo-soprano singer from Aix-en-Provence who had worked with Sirenia for 13 years as part of The Sirenian Choir. She had already contributed the lead vocals for the &quot;Sirenian Shores&quot; EP cover of &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot; by Leonard Cohen.

Sirenia toured with Arkona and MindMaze in May 2017 for their debut in the United States and Canada.

In October 2017 before a European tour, French guitarist Nils Courbaron was unexpectedly invited to participate in the live performances, replacing Jan Erik Soltvedt. In November, longtime drummer Jonathan Pérez left the band and joined Green Carnation. Following this, Sirenia temporarily included Austrian drummer Roland Navratil, a live member who had performed with the band before.

The band returned to North America to join various bands on the heavy metal cruise, 70000 Tons of Metal for two shows on 2 and 3 February 2018.

Sirenia toured North America for the second time with Canadian metal band Threat Signal in April 2018, with support from Valinor Excelsior, Graveshadow, Niviane and Dire Peril.
On 14 August 2018, Sirenia had revealed the title of their ninth studio album &quot;Arcane Astral Aeons&quot;, along with a European tour in the fall. The album was released 26 October of the same year.

A lyric video was made for the single &quot;Love Like Cyanide&quot; released on 21 September 2018. The song features a guest appearance by Yannis Papadopoulos from Finnish band Beast in Black. On 12 October, &quot;Into the Night&quot; was released as the second single, followed by a music video. Both videos were directed by Swedish filmmaker and musician Owe Lingvall.

In the fall of 2019, Sirenia went on an extensive European tour with bands such as Leaves&#x27; Eyes, Forever Still and Lost in Grey. During the tour, a new official member was introduced, British drummer Michael Brush from Magic Kingdom.

=== 2020–present: &quot;Riddles, Ruins &amp; Revelations&quot; and &quot;1977&quot; ===
On 8 December 2020, Sirenia announced the title of their tenth studio album &quot;Riddles, Ruins &amp; Revelations&quot;, with the release of their first single off of the album, &quot;Addiction No. 1&quot;. The album was released on 12 February 2021. The second single off of the album, &quot;We Come to Ruins&quot;, was released on 12 January 2021. On 10 February 2021, the band released their third single off of the album which is a cover of Desireless&#x27; &quot;Voyage, voyage&quot;. The tenth album was a remarkable stylistic shift for Sirenia, adding synth-pop to their usual symphonic metal musical style, opting for a more commercial bet.

On 22 March 2023, the band simultaneously announced the first single which is a cover of English singer Tanita Tikaram&#x27;s &quot;Twist in My Sobriety&quot;. It is the first single that was featured on the eleventh studio album, &quot;1977&quot;, which was released on 26 May 2023. The other two singles were &quot;Deadlight&quot; and &quot;Wintry Heart&quot;. The album followed in the same vein as the previous &quot;Riddles, Ruins &amp; Revelations&quot;, but with a style influenced by the rock bands of the 70s-80s.

<text>&quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot; is the sixth single by English pop band Frankie Goes to Hollywood. Released on 10 November 1986 as the second single from their album &quot;Liverpool,&quot; it stalled at number 19 in the UK Singles Chart (making it the group&#x27;s first UK hit not to go Top Five), number 7 in Germany and number 13 in Switzerland. 

==Background==

Having already referenced Dylan Thomas in &quot;Rage Hard&quot;, for &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot; Holly Johnson turned to T. S. Eliot for inspiration, citing Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot; poem, &quot;Mad Max 2&quot;, and the 1979 film, &quot;The Warriors&quot; as inspirations. 

Johnson stated to &quot;No. 1&quot; magazine the song was of social inequality saying, &quot;Warriors implies fighting tribal heroes. It is political in that it shows up the divide between those who have and those who have not. Society is designed to keep that division as wide as possible. Rich people and corporate businesses have got it worked out so they launder money and avoid tax while the education system keep a type of ignorance going. I believe in the conspiracy theory, the well to do pay for a better education and always keep control.&quot;

The single remix of the song is different in contrast to the album version. The album version is longer, has a extended atmospheric intro which hits a more aggressive metal sound with drums and prominent guitar riffs, while the single version has a more dance oriented groove. The remix was made by Trevor Horn, who produced their earliest releases.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Smash Hits&quot; described &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot; as, &quot;the Liverpool louts having lost their winning formula and &#x27;Warriors (Of The Wasteland)&#x27; having none of the tongue-in-cheek humour or honest-to-goodness sleaze of earlier efforts. In fact, it sounds like they’ve been listening to too many Iron Maiden records.&quot; James Brown of &quot;Sounds&quot; also gave a negative review calling the song &quot;a predictable piece of rock junk&quot; which he believed showed how Frankie Goes to Hollywood had become &quot;appallingly tame and useless&quot; and &quot;so bloody obviously boring that they have resorted to making competent rock records&quot;. 

&quot;Billboard&quot; said of it that &quot;art-rock megaproduction waxes critical of society&#x27;s inequalities.&quot; &quot;Record Mirror&quot; praised the song saying, &quot;Now they’re trying to be a rock band. This is very amusing and even danceable — if you’ve got a steady pulse — but what does it all mean?&quot;

==Chart performance==
Despite the promotion, poor record sales caused &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot; to stall at number 19 in the UK Singles Chart which made it Frankie Goes to Hollywood&#x27;s first single in the UK to not enter the Top 5. It reached no higher than number 7 in Germany for two weeks, number 12 in Ireland and number 13 in Switzerland. 

==Track listing==
All discographical information pertains to UK releases only unless noted.

;7&quot;: ZTT / ZTAS 25
# &quot;Warriors of the Wasteland&quot; (Twelve Wild Disciples mix edit) – 3:55
# &quot;Warriors (Of the Wasteland)&quot; – 5:00
*The single version (A-side) is a remix by Trevor Horn, recreated digitally using samples and synths. The AA-side is the album version, with the spoken intro to &quot;Rage Hard&quot; tagged onto the end. The titles were swapped on most overseas releases, thus causing confusion on most fansites.

;12&quot;: ZTT / 12 ZTAS 25
# &quot;Warriors&quot; (Twelve Wild Disciples mix) – 9:45
# &quot;Warriors&quot; (instrumental) – 4:50
# &quot;Warriors&quot; (return) – 1:22
# &quot;Warriors&quot; (end) – 3:29

*As with many ZTT releases, unlisted tracks have created confusion as to which track has which title. &quot;Warriors&quot; (return) can be taken to be the full 6:12 instrumental track, or just the 1:22 reprise. The 2014 digital reissue labelled both pieces as &quot;Warriors&quot; (return).
*&quot;Warriors&quot; (end) began life as an unreleased track called &quot;Pocket Vibrator&quot;.
*On the sleeve notes to this release, producer Trevor Horn noted: &quot;On &quot;Liverpool&quot; the members of Frankie Goes to Hollywood played &quot;Warriors&quot; with their own notoriously fair hands ... This so-called 12&quot; is in fact a total cheat ... No-one played anything, in any orthodox sense. It was all done by computers, very powerful computers ... juggling and organising pre-recorded sounds.&quot;

;12&quot;: ZTT / 12 ZTAX 25

# &quot;Warriors&quot; (return) – 1:22
# &quot;Warriors&quot; (end) – 3:29
*The &quot;Attack&quot; mix featured additional guitar parts by Gary Moore. A 7&quot; edited version of this track also exists on white label.

* The CD is one track without a title list, and the titles above are for convenience of reference, apart from &quot;Warriors&quot; (Twelve Wild Disciples) and &quot;Warriors (Of the Wasteland)&quot;.
*&quot;Introduction&quot; starts with various vocal sounds, then sped-up samples re-edited, then slowed down samples, moving into what sounds like the &quot;return&quot; mix and some re-edited instrumental bits.
*&quot;Twelve Wild Disciples&quot; is the first 12&quot; mix – a reconstructed version with additional keyboards.
*The &quot;fewer lyrics&quot; version is the album version with verse lyrics missing.
*&quot;Warriors (Of the Wasteland)&quot; sounds similar to Twelve Wild Disciples, but a 7&quot; edit.
*&quot;Monopoly Re-solution&quot; is a stand-alone track.

&quot;Warriors&quot; (compacted) was re-released on the &quot;Sexmix&quot; compilation in 2012.

# &quot;Warriors&quot; – 1:27
# &quot;Warriors&quot; (Monopoly Re-solution) – 3:03

*As with the CD single, no individual tracks are listed on the sleeve, which simply states &quot;... featuring Warriors (Twelve Wild Disciples mix) and a phenomenon of megabytes&quot;. The latter phrase, which does not specifically refer to any tracks in the cassette, is a ZTT coinage meaning &quot;remix&quot; or &quot;collection of remixes&quot; (i.e. remix album), and as such it was also used as a subtitle for &quot;The Art of the 12&quot;&quot;, a 2011 2-CD release featuring a selection of classic ZTT remixes, two more volumes of which followed in 2012 and 2014.
*The opening voiceover and the instrumental version of the &quot;Twelve Wild Disciples&quot; mix were unique to this cassette, until CTIS25 was finally released on CD in 2011 as part of the &quot;Liverpool&quot; deluxe edition.

<text>Phantom Planet is the third album by the rock band Phantom Planet, released on January 6, 2004. The album marked a change in the band&#x27;s sound, shifting from radio-friendly pop rock to garage rock, comparable to the sound of the Strokes. Produced by Dave Fridmann, it is their first album to feature drummer Jeff Conrad (ex-Big City Rock).

During the recording of the album, drummer and co-founder Jason Schwartzman left the band to pursue his acting career.

The music video for album&#x27;s single, &quot;Big Brat&quot; cuts between scenes of an urban performance of the song to the band shooting a low budget zombie film in the relative location. The actual zombie film being shot was used as an alternate music video for the song available to fans on the band&#x27;s website.

==Recording and production==
The album was Phantom Planet&#x27;s first without drummer Jason Schwartzman, who announced midway through the sessions that he was leaving to pursue acting full-time. &quot;He finally made the adult decision between the two sides of him,&quot; Greenwald said of his friend, with whom he co-founded the group at age thirteen. &quot;It was a little strange at first, but there&#x27;s no bad blood. We&#x27;re still best friends.&quot; Schwartzman, the star of several films, including &quot;Rushmore&quot;, &quot;The Darjeeling Limited&quot;, &quot;Funny People&quot;, and television shows like &quot;Bored to Death&quot;, can be heard on half the album&#x27;s tracks, while the rest feature new drummer Jeff Conrad.

==Songs==
The song &quot;By the Bed&quot; is about Alex&#x27;s grandmother, and what she told him on her deathbed, and the song &quot;Jabberjaw&quot; deals with anger and frustration.

Alex Greenwald commented on &quot;Jabberjaw&quot; in &quot;Nylon&quot; magazine:

<text>Lovegod is the second studio album by the Soup Dragons, released in 1990. Four songs from the album were released as singles—&quot;Backwards Dog&quot;, &quot;Crotch Deep Trash&quot;, &quot;Mother Universe&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot;. The last, a cover of a Rolling Stones cut from their 1965 album &quot;Out of Our Heads&quot;, made the top 5 in the UK charts. First pressings did not include &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot;, but it was subsequently placed first on the re-release, which also dates to 1990.

The album peaked at No. 7 on the UK Albums Chart. It peaked at No. 88 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The video for &quot;I&#x27;m Free&quot; made it to the top spot on MTV&#x27;s most requested list.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Trouser Press&quot; called the album &quot;an effective, accessible (if ultimately tedious) trip of house-geared rhythms, semi-firm melodies and singer/guitarist/programmer Sean Dickson’s obviously mind-expanded lyrics.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; deemed it &quot;well-crafted danceable rock with immaculate production.&quot;

<text>The Wilderness Society is an Australian, community-based, not-for-profit non-governmental environmental advocacy organisation. 

The society is organized as a public company limited by guarantee. It has separately incorporated campaign centres, passed in the capital of each Australian state (plus Launceston and Newcastle). Most campaign centres are separately incorporated and operate as membership organizations: The Wilderness Society Newcastle Incorporated, The Wilderness Society (South Australia) Inc, The Wilderness Society (Tasmania) Inc, The Wilderness Society Victoria Inc, and The Wilderness Society WA Inc.

==History==

The Wilderness Society was formed initially as the Tasmanian Wilderness Society (TWS) and was transition from the South West Tasmania Action Committee.
The group was originally established in 1976 from the members of the Lake Pedder Action Committee and the South West Tasmania Action Committee Along with the United Tasmania Group, they had protested against the earlier flooding of Lake Pedder. The group already had established interstate branches as the South West Tasmania Action Committee (in NSW branch the word &quot;Action&quot; was not included), so it was already a nationwide organisation. Significantly, all but four of the twenty-three people attending the inaugural meeting of the Tasmanian Wilderness Society in 1976 were members of the United Tasmania Group.

The campaign to save the Franklin River took seven years, 1976-83. The Tasmanian Wilderness Society played a key role. On 1 July 1981, works were stopped on the Franklin Dam when the High Court ruled that, in upholding the World Heritage Convention, Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke’s government could overrule Tasmanian premier Robin Gray. Following the success of the campaign against the Franklin Dam, and the national approach being more important due to other issues interstate, it became known as The Wilderness Society.

In the year 2005, Tasmanian forestry business Gunns brought a litigation case against the group in the Melbourne Supreme Court, in a case dubbed the &quot;Gunns 20&quot;, claiming that the activities of environmental activists had damaged Gunns&#x27; profits. Gunns claimed $3.5 million from the Wilderness Society, but in March 2009, Gunns was ordered to pay the Wilderness Society $350,000 in damages and to cease the action.

== Campaigns ==
The Wilderness Society spent considerable energy in its first decades of existence arguing that wilderness was a specific quality in parts of Australia&#x27;s environment that was vital to preserve for future generations. The political response in most states of Australia is that there are now wilderness inventories and acknowledgement of areas of wilderness.

The Wilderness Society&#x27;s campaigns have included:
* the Franklin river (Franklin Dam controversy)
* stopping logging in old growth forests
* preventing destruction of endangered species habitats;
* protecting Queensland&#x27;s Wild Rivers and Cape York Peninsula;
* nationwide campaign to mitigate the effects of climate change keep fossil fuels in the ground; 
* the Kimberley Campaign; as part of its long-running campaign against a proposal to industrialise the James Price Point headland near Broome, the organisation presented a concert on 5 October 2012. The concert featured performances from The John Butler Trio, Clare Bowditch and Missy Higgins, and a speech by the former leader of the Australian Greens and former TWS director, Dr Bob Brown. 
* since 2018 they have been focused on New Nature Laws - campaigning for strong, national nature laws and an independent watchdog agency to enforce these 
* protecting the Great Australian Bight from fossil fuel exploration and extraction, with four major oil companies abandoning plans to drill for oil in the Bight, Equinor being the latest to do so in 2020 
* On 4 May 2022, the NSW government ruled out a third coal lease site on the doorstep of Wollemi National Park. It came after tens of thousands of people signed submissions and wrote to MPs. It took a sustained effort from Wiradjuri Traditional Owners, the local community, the Wilderness Society and others
* helping see an end to native forest logging in Victoria, which the Andrews government announced would start from 1 January 2024. It was the culmination of a decades-long campaign with other environmental groups and local communities
* helping to protect the rivers and floodplains of the Channel Country in Queensland from fossil fuel expansion in 2023 

===Stance on nuclear energy===
The Wilderness Society opposes nuclear energy.

==Funding==
Traditionally fundraising was performed through The Wilderness Society Shops. The shops were particularly popular for their calendars and posters by photographers such as Peter Dombrovskis and Olegas Truchanas, and were also central locations for the public to make donations and for members to meet.

Since the rise of the internet, fundraising has increasingly become centralised around internet based activities, such as the TWS website, online store and extensive email lists, although it also still contacts supporters through regular postal communications as well. 

The Wilderness Society now raises funds through a number of sources, mainly donations, including advocacy gifts and gifts in wills (bequests), subscriptions from members, grants, sales of merchandise, and interest and other investment income. 

In 2021 the Wilderness Society reported receiving $869,000 in COVID-19 relief subsidies. 

==Political involvement==
The inaugural director of The Wilderness Society was Kevin Kiernan, followed by Norm Sanders, who was later elected to the seat of Denison in the Tasmanian Parliament in 1980 for the Australian Democrats. He was Australia&#x27;s first parliamentarian to be elected on an environmental platform. Bob Brown became the director of The Wilderness Society in 1978, and with him the group increased their influence on Tasmanian politics. Brown was elected to the Tasmanian parliament in 1983 to fill the vacancy left when Sanders resigned his seat, and with the group of fellow conservationists elected subsequently, he went on to become part of the political party known as the Tasmanian Greens. Brown was later elected to represent Tasmania and the Greens in the Senate in the Federal parliament.

While The Wilderness Society has worked with the Australian Greens on certain campaigns, it is not affiliated with them or any other political party, as a politically unaligned environmental non-government organisation.

==&quot;Wilderness Journal&quot;==
The society publishes the &quot;Wilderness Journal&quot;, which covers a wide variety of stories about nature and people. Topics include the communities and forests of East Gippsland, a photo diary by Ben Baker of a road trip through bushfire damaged regions, a story about Marina DeBris and the ugly beauty of our trash, attempts to restore the giant kelp forests of Tasmania, and a journey into Mirning country, the coast and waters of the Great Australian Bight.

<doc id="1099047" wikidata="Q56085576" url="?curid=1099047" title="Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv">
<text>Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv (; ; ) were three legendary brothersoften mentioned along with their sister Lybеd″ (; ; )who, according to the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, founded the city of Kiev (modern Kyiv), which eventually became the capital of Kievan Rus&#x27;, and is the present-day capital of Ukraine.

There is no precise and historically established information about the existence of the four legendary siblings and the establishment of the city of Kiev. It has been claimed by some scholars that Kyi was also prince (&quot;knyaz&quot;) and founded the so-called Kyi dynasty, from the Slavic tribe of Polans.

==Historical background==
In the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; ( 1110s), written by a monk of the Kyiv Pechersk Lavra (traditionally attributed to Nestor), a special place is held by the legend of the foundation of Kiev by three brothers. Nestor places those brothers onto various hills of Kyiv. Geographically, the Old Town is located on a higher right bank of the Dnieper, which is an extension of the Dnieper Upland, where remnants of the Church of the Tithes are located.

The &quot;Chronicle&quot; further states that there were people (&quot;who did not know what they were saying&quot;) who considered Kyi a mere ferryman. But it later claims that Kyi, as a prince of his gens, was visiting Czargrad and received great honors from the Emperor. Dmitry Likhachov combined attestations of the Nikon Chronicle, which also recounts that Kyi with a great army marched onto Czargrad and received great honors from the Emperor. During his expedition to Constantinople, Kyi also founded a city of Kyivets on the Danube.

Nestor also names the approximate date of the assault on Kyiv by the Khazar Empire as &quot;after the death of Kyi,&quot; which supports Boris Rybakov&#x27;s hypothesis of the 6th–7th centuries. In his chronicle Nestor does not indicate the date of Kyi&#x27;s death nor the existence or absence of heirs who continued to rule after his death. The chronicle does mention a meeting between local residents with the newly arrived Askold and Dir who asked them whose city Kjiv was, and received the answer that the three brothers who built it were long dead and the residents now paid tribute to the Khazars. However, the Polish historian Jan Długosz points out the Przemysł Chronicle that asserts, &quot;after the death of Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv, their children and grandchildren who descended from them by direct lineage ruled for many years.&quot;

== Text of the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; ==
The text of the legendary founding of Kiev (Kyiv) by the three brothers and their sister is found in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; on page 9, lines 5–21. Each full sentence has been highlighted in the comparison below:

=== Legendary founding of Kyiv/Kiev ===
=== Acts of Kyi ===
In the subsequent lines 9.22–10.14, the background, life story and legacy of Kyi and his siblings is briefly lined out. Lines 10:5 and 10:6 contain well-known examples of disputed textual variants in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;: the main textual witnesses including the &quot;Laurentian&quot; and &quot;Hypatian Codices&quot; have different texts here, and scholars cannot agree which manuscript most closely reflects the original text.


=== Legacy of the four siblings ===
The &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot; relates three different versions of what happened to political power amongst the Polyanians in the period after the four siblings (the three brothers and their sister) died and before the Khazars vassalised them. Lines 10.15–10.17 suggest that the offspring of Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv and Lybid&#x27; continued to reign amongst the Polyanians, while the Derevlians and other tribes around them had their own &quot;knyazi&quot; (princes):

16.21–17.3 say that upon the deaths of the four siblings, the Derevlians seized power and &quot;oppressed&quot; the Polyanians, then &quot;other neighbours&quot;, and then finally the Khazars made them tributaries:

In lines 20.24–21.3, the inhabitants of Kyiv/Kiev tell Askold and Dir a brief history of the city, which does not mention either a reign of the siblings&#x27; descendants, nor of an &quot;oppression&quot; by the Derevlians or other neighbouring tribes; instead, the three brothers&#x27; deaths are immediately followed by paying tribute to the Khazars:

== Historiographical interpretation ==
Many historians consider Kyi and his rule circa the 6th century to be actual history. Among such historians are Boris Rybakov, Dmitry Likhachov, Aleksey Shakhmatov, Alexander Presnyakov, Petro Tolochko, and Nataliia Polonska-Vasylenko.

The names of Kyi and his brothers have equivalents in an Armenian chronicle from the 7th century, &quot;History of Taron&quot;, by Zenob Glak. In it, Kyi and Khoryv have counterparts in brothers Kouar and Horian, while Polyans is paralleled in the Balounik district. An explanation for this can be found both in the common source (probably Scythian) of Ukrainian and Armenian legends, and in the common mythological plot used to explain the founding of the many cows that inhabit the city. The legend also has parallels in the Croatian &quot;origo gentis&quot; of five brothers and two sisters (Kloukas, Lobelos, Kosentzis, Mouchlo, Chrobatos, Touga and Bouga) from the 30th chapter of &quot;De Administrando Imperio&quot; by Constantine VII (10th century), and the &quot;Bulgarian apocryphal chronicle&quot; (12th century) about the ethnogenesis of the Bulgarians. All three speak about people who migrated to a foreign land, whose leader was of the same name (Kyi in Kyiv, Chrobatos in Croats, and Slav in Bulgarians), while Kyivan and Croatian mention a sister. The female personality and number three can be found also in three daughters (youngest Libuše) of Duke Krok from &quot;Chronica Boemorum&quot; (12 century), two sons and daughter (Krakus II, Lech II, and Princess Wanda) of Krakus legendary founder of Kraków from &quot;Chronica seu originale regum et principum Poloniae&quot; (12–13th century), and three brothers Lech, Czech, and Rus from &quot;Wielkopolska Chronicle&quot; (13th century).

Khoryv or Horiv, and his oronym Khorevytsia, some scholars related to the Croatian ethnonym of White Croats. Paščenko related his name, beside to the Croatian ethnonym, also to the solar deity Khors. Near Kyiv there is a stream where previously existed a large village named Horvatka or Hrovatka (it was destroyed in the time of Joseph Stalin), which flows into Stuhna River. 

Lybid () is the name of another tributary of the Dnipro, just south of Kyiv. As a river, &quot;Lybed″&quot; () is mentioned twice in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;, first on page 69.8 during the Pecheneg Siege of Kiev (968), and second on page 79.28–80.1 as the place where Vladimir the Great settled his wife Rogned&#x27; &quot;sub anno&quot; 980. In both cases, it takes the form of на Лыбеди (&quot;na Lybedi&quot;, &quot;at/on the Lybed&#x27;&quot;). It is unknown whether the sister was named after the river or vice versa.

Byzantine sources report that the prince Kyi (originally Kuver) was brought up at the court of Emperor Justinian I in his youth, converted to Christianity in Constantinople, and was educated there.

According to other Byzantine testimonies, Kyi was a contemporary of Emperor Heraclius (575–641). As his contemporary John of Nicaea writes in detail, &quot;by the power of the Holy and Life-Giving Baptism he received, he defeated all barbarians and pagans.&quot; The friendly ties of the ancient prince with the Byzantine imperial court is evidenced by the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;.

== Archaeological excavations ==

Archaeological excavations have shown that there was indeed an ancient settlement starting with the 6th century. Some speculate that Kyi was a real person, a &quot;knyaz&quot; (prince) from the tribe of the Polans. According to legend, Kyi, the eldest brother, was a Polianian Prince, and the city was named after him.

In the sixth to seventh centuries, the borders of three cultural groups of monuments converged on the Polans land — Kyiv Oblast — Prague, Penkiv and Kolochyn cultures, and in the eighth to tenth centuries — Luka-Raikovetska and Volyntsevo culture. From the very beginning, Kyiv was the center of not one, but several tribal groups.

==Modern tributes==

In addition to the respective hills and the river, there are &quot;Shchekavytska&quot; and &quot;Khoryva&quot; Streets in Kyiv&#x27;s ancient neighborhood of Podil.

In 1982, Kyi, Shchek, Khoryv and Lybid were depicted (standing on an ancient riverboat) in a sculpture, called the Monument to the Founders of Kyiv by Vasyl Borodai, at the river-side of Navodnytsky Park. At the time of its unveiling, the Soviet authorities claimed that it was simultaneously on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the formation of the USSR, as well as the alleged &quot;1500th anniversary&quot; of the foundation of Kyiv in 482. Various scholars and commentators found &quot;482&quot; an odd attribution, as no such date is mentioned in the &quot;Primary Chronicle&quot;; historian Taras Kuzio said that &#x27;the year 482 had no special significance&#x27;. There was speculation that the two anniversaries were merged for the sake of convenience by the Soviet regime, to emphasise the common origins of Ukraine and Russia, and step around their many conflicts. Nevertheless, several politicians would go on to embrace 482 as the date of the legendary foundation, including former Kyivan mayor Oleksandr Omelchenko, who utilised it in order to argue the Ukrainian capital was much older than Moscow. The monument soon became iconic for the city and has been used as Kyiv&#x27;s unofficial emblem. In 2001, another statue was installed at a fountain of the Maidan Nezalezhnosti.

== In popular culture ==
* In a 2019 episode of the satirical comedy series &quot;Servant of the People&quot;, Ukraine is in a political crisis, with several regions threatening to break away. Prime Minister Yuriy Ivanovich Chuiko (played by Stanislav Boklan) recommends President Vasily Petrovych Holoborodko (played by Volodymyr Zelenskyy) to hold an empassioned speech, referring to the common origins of all Ukrainians from when the capital was founded by Kyi, Shchek and Khoryv and their sister Lybid&#x27;, to inspire everyone to reunite the country. Yuriy warns the President to correctly remember and pronounce the legendary founders&#x27; names, but then goes on to mix them up himself on live television, causing a huge political scandal.

<text>GNOME-DB is a database application by the GNOME community. The project aims to provide a free unified data access architecture to the GNOME project for all Unix platforms. GNOME-DB is useful for any application that accesses persistent data (not only databases, but data), since it contains a data management API.

== Features ==
GNOME-DB has support for GObject Introspection and Vala. Starting with the 4.2 series, GNOME-DB corresponds to the libgda library. The libgnomedb library provides &quot;widgets&quot; that allow users to interact with data in databases. It uses the libgda generic database API, so it can use MySQL, Postgres, SQLite, etc.

== GNU Data Access ==

GNU Data Access (GDA) is a set of plugin APIs, defined as generic as possible, so that any kind of data source can be accessed through them, to provide uniform access to different kinds of data sources (databases, information servers, mail spools, etc.). Similar to Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) or Java Database Connectivity (JDBC), GNU Data Access is a wrapper but with more features to access several database engines. GNU Data Access has been developed as a complete architecture that provides everything required to access data sources.

Libgda is mainly a database and a data abstraction layer. It is a library that implements the interfaces defined by the GDA architecture, for both the client and the server parts. It additionally provides a bunch of tools to help with the development and the management of data sources via the GDA APIs. Libgda was part of the GNOME-DB project but has been separated from it to allow non-GNOME applications to be developed based on it.

The libgda library is released under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), which allows for commercial applications to be developed based on libgda. Its command-line and UI tools are under the GNU General Public License (GPL).

Libgda is a (relatively small) database access library:
* features a metadata extractor (to know all about database objects in a common way)
* comes with an SQL console application (like mysql, psql or sqlite3 consoles)
* Libgda is coded in C, depends on GLib (and integrates with it), and LibXML2.
* Libgda&#x27;s UI extension depends on GTK+
* Libgda&#x27;s graphical tools depend on GTK+ and optionally GooCanvas and GraphViz

<text>Sultan Ahmad Khan b. Sardar &#x27;Azim Muhammadzai (), also known as Sultan Jan () was the ruler of the Principality of Herat from September 1857 to April 1863. He was a nephew of Dost Mohammad Khan. In 1855-56, Sultan Ahmad Khan sent a petition to the Shah, Nasir al-Din. If the Iranians would support Sultan Ahmad Khan with an army, he would overthrow the Amir-i Kabir and incorporate Afghanistan into the Guarded Domains. However, Sultan Ahmad Khan was intercepted by Dost Mohammad Khan, who exiled Sultan Ahmad Khan to Iran. 

After the conclusion of the Anglo-Persian War, he was installed as ruler of Herat by the Iranians. On May 24, 1857, Sultan Ahmad Khan arrived in Herat. The Iranians evacuated Herat in September 1857 in accordance with the Treaty of Paris. During Sultan Ahmad Khan&#x27;s reign, he was completely dependent on Iran and not only minted coins in the Shah&#x27;s name, but also given assistance against the Muhammadzais to the east. Naser al-Din Shah bestowed the title of Sirkar () on Sultan Ahmad Khan and gave his son, Shah Nawaz Khan, the title of Amir Panji ().

Khan captured Farah soon after in March 1862. Farah had been a Muhammadzai possession since their occupation of the town on October 30, 1856. This became Dost Mohammad Khan&#x27;s casus belli to launch an attack on Herat. On June 29 or July 8 Farah was captured by the Muhammadzais. On July 22, Sabzawar was captured. By July 28, Herat was besieged. During the 10-month siege Ahmad died on March 6, 1863, being succeeded by his son Shah Nawaz Khan. Shortly before his death, he had been affected by a disease that causes limb paralysis. On May 27, 1863, Herat would finally fall to the Amir.

<doc id="1099065" wikidata="Q399998" url="?curid=1099065" title="Wee Kim Wee">
<text>Wee Kim Wee (4 November 1915 – 2 May 2005) was a Singaporean journalist and diplomat who served as the fourth president of Singapore from 1985 to 1993. Born in Singapore during colonial rule, Wee was educated at Outram Secondary School and Raffles Institution, dropping out to work at &quot;The Straits Times&quot; in 1930. He left &quot;The Straits Times&quot; to join the United Press Associations in 1941, working there through the Second World War and eventually becoming the office manager and chief correspondent by 1959.

That same year, he returned to &quot;The Straits Times&quot; after being offered the position of Deputy Editor. During his time there, he was best known for his interview of then-Lieutenant General Suharto, where he reported his intentions for peace during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. He also became the first Singaporean journalist to enter Jakarta when he went to interview Suharto. He retired from journalism in 1973 at the position of editorial manager and became a diplomat, serving as Singapore&#x27;s High Commissioner to Malaysia from 1973 and 1980 and Ambassador to Japan and South Korea concurrently from 1980 and 1984.

In 1985, Wee was elected president by Parliament and served in the role for two terms, ending in 1993. For the ensuing presidential election, the first in Singapore to be decided by popular vote, Wee decided not to contest and retired after his second term had ended. He was also the first president to exercise custodial powers pursuant to the constitutional amendments in Singapore&#x27;s history. He was succeeded by Ong Teng Cheong on 1 September 1993. Wee died of prostate cancer in his home at Siglap Plain in Singapore on 2 May 2005, at the age of 89.

==Early life and education==

Wee was born in Singapore, which was then-under British rule and a part of the Straits Settlements, at the Free Middleton Hospital on 4 November 1915. The youngest of four sons to Wee Choong Lay and Chua Hay Luan, his father Choong Lay worked on a ship, being in charge of the cargo. His father later went blind after an unsuccessful surgery, causing his family to move from their home in Zion Road to a house at Holland Road. The house, which lacked electricity or piped water, was owned by a wealthy land-owner whom they paid a rent of a month. Wee&#x27;s family relied on rearing poultry and fruits growing around the house for money.

In 1923, Wee attended Pearl&#x27;s Hill School for his primary education. He later attended Outram Secondary School, before enrolling in Raffles Institution, for his secondary education. He passed his Standard VII in 1929, being promoted to a &quot;Junior&quot; class. He dropped out of school sometime after 1929 after his mother urged him to find employment, seeing as how their family was still struggling financially, living in Singapore Harbour Board housing at Kampong Bahru. His uncle Tan Kok Tiong, who worked as a chief clerk at Singaporean newspaper &quot;The Straits Times&quot;, recommended that Wee work at the circulation department of the newspaper.

During his youth, Wee enjoyed playing badminton. He founded the Useful Badminton Party in 1932 alongside thirteen other badminton players, whom he met while living at his Singapore Harbour Board housing. In 1937, he won the singles title in the Singapore Junior championship. In 1938, he was elected to the Singapore Badminton Association&#x27;s management committee, initially serving as its secretary before eventually becoming the president. He retired from competitive badminton the following year due to medical reasons.

==Career==

===Journalism (1930–1973)===
In 1930, Wee started working for the newspaper &quot;The Straits Times&quot; in its circulation department. He worked in the circulation department for five years before being transferred to the advertising department, which he worked at for about three to four years before becoming a reporter. Initially, Wee covered sporting events such as soccer, badminton, table tennis, and basketball, which were usually at the stadiums or the amusement parks.

Early in 1941, he resigned from &quot;The Straits Times&quot; to join American news agency United Press Associations (UPA) after the post of circulation chief clerk was not offered to him upon its vacancy at &quot;The Straits Times&quot;. During the Second World War, while working at UPA, he served in the Air Raid Precautions. He struggled financially during the war, setting up a stall in Kampong Bahru where he sold things such as mosquito coils. During the Japanese occupation, he worked clerical jobs at various Japanese military establishments. After the end of the war, Wee continued to struggle financially. Following the liberation of Singapore, UPA correspondent Charles McQuown-Wright contacted him and gave him to support himself. As he continued to work at UPA, he eventually became the office manager and chief correspondent in the early 1950s. As chief correspondent, he reported to an American manager about Singapore, Malaya, Borneo, and Brunei.

In 1959, Wee was asked to return to &quot;The Straits Times&quot; where he would be appointed as Deputy Editor, the head of &quot;The Straits Times&quot;&#x27; editorial department. In 1963, Wee managed to interview a Sulu pirate chief while he was in Malaysia. In 1966, he interviewed then-Lieutenant General Suharto and then-Indonesian Foreign Minister Adam Malik. He reported their intentions to end the confrontation between Indonesia and Malaysia, also known as the Konfrontasi. Wee had interviewed Malik earlier in Bangkok before gaining permission to interview Suharto in Jakarta. He was also the first Singaporean journalist to gain permission to enter Jakarta. In the early 1970s, Wee was responsible for helping form the Singapore Press Club. Suggesting the idea to T. S. Khoo, Wee set up and held the first inaugural meeting of the club after his agreement. Wee was also responsible for finding where the club&#x27;s premises would be, first at the Summit Hotel (now known as the York Hotel) and later the Apollo Hotel, both at low rental rates. In 1970, he was appointed as editorial manager, which he worked as till 1973 when he left journalism.

===Diplomacy (1973–1984)===
In 1973, Wee was approached by then-Foreign Minister S. Rajaratnam to serve as Singapore&#x27;s High Commissioner to Malaysia, which he accepted and subsequently left &quot;The Straits Times&quot;. Originally, he was only supposed to serve for three years but ended up serving seven years as the High Commissioner to Malaysia, ending on 31 August 1980. During his time there, he lived in Kuala Lumpur and was credited by Rajaratnam in helping improve the relationship between the two countries, especially after the separation of Singapore from Malaysia a few years prior.

In September 1980, Wee was appointed to serve concurrently as Singapore&#x27;s Ambassador to Japan, having presented his credentials earlier in October, and Ambassador to South Korea. In 1981, Wee opened the Development Bank of Singapore&#x27;s first Korean branch in Seoul. In 1983, he represented Singapore at the funeral for the victims of the Rangoon bombing. He retired from diplomacy in 1984.

=== Other appointments ===
During his career, Wee held multiple appointments on different statutory boards such as the Rent Control Board, Film Appeal Committee, Land Acquisition Board, Board of Visiting Justices, National Theatre Board, and the Singapore Broadcasting Corporation (present-day Mediacorp). He also served on the Council of the Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association (SATA) and later chairman of SATA. In 1959, Wee alongside fellow SATA Council member Sen Gupta introduced mobile x-ray machines to treat tuberculosis more efficiently in Singapore. Wee also served as a director for United Engineers, Wearne Brothers, and Banque Internationale à Luxembourg&#x27;s Asia branch till 1985.

In August 1985, then-prime minister Lee Kuan Yew nominated Wee to become president at the 1985 presidential election after a five-month vacancy. Wee received a unanimous agreement to his election, making him the first Chinese Singaporean to become president, and was sworn in on 2 September 1985.

Upon his reelection, he stated, &quot;The reason why I could go on like this is the encouragement and the support that the government as well as the people have given me.&quot; The 1989 presidential election was initially planned to have a president elected by popular vote by the people, but amendments to the constitution for a president elected by popular vote were not ready yet. Lee stated about this that, &quot;The president after him is likely to be elected by the whole electorate.&quot; Member of Parliament for Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency Sidek Saniff stated of Wee that there is &quot;no class barrier, much less a dividing wall when [Wee] comes into contact with Malays, Chinese, Indians, Eurasians, Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, Hindus, and others&quot;.

<text>The Tudeh Party of Iran is an Iranian communist party. Formed in 1941, with Soleiman Mirza Eskandari as its head, it had considerable influence in its early years and played an important role during Mohammad Mosaddegh&#x27;s campaign to nationalize the Anglo-Persian Oil Company and his term as prime minister. From the Iran crisis of 1946 onwards, Tudeh became a pro-Soviet organization and remained prepared to carry out the dictates of the Kremlin, even if it meant sacrificing Iranian political independence and sovereignty. The crackdown that followed the 1953 coup against Mosaddegh is said to have &quot;destroyed&quot; the party, although a remnant persisted. The party still exists but has remained much weaker as a result of its banning in Iran and mass arrests by the Islamic Republic in 1982, as well as the executions of political prisoners in 1988. Tudeh identified itself as the historical offshoot of the Communist Party of Persia.

==Ideological profile==
The party has generally been described as &quot;communist&quot; by historians (for example: &quot;The Tudeh Party was a classical pro-Soviet Union communist party, but wrapped itself at the time in nationalism to be more attractive to Iranians&quot;), but is sometimes described simply as &quot;leftist&quot; or even &quot;left-leaning&quot; by more sympathetic sources. Various academic sources have described the party as &quot;Stalinist&quot;.

== History ==
===Birth of the communist movement in Iran===
The history of the communist movement in Iran dates back to the late 19th century, when Marxism first became introduced to the nation&#x27;s intellectual and working classes as a result of the rapid growth of industry and the subsequent transformation of the country&#x27;s economy from a feudalistic system into a capitalistic one. Being close to the Soviet Union and the Caucasus, northern Iran became the primary center of underground Marxist and social democrat political activity, and many such groups came into being over the years.

The Communist Party of Iran was founded in June 1920 in Bandar-e Anzali, in the province of Gilan, as a result of the first congress of Iranian social democrats. Haydar Khan Amo-oghli, who was one of the leaders of the Constitutional Revolution of Iran, became the national secretary of the new party. At the same time, Mirza Kuchik Khan, another major leader of the Constitutional Revolution and also the leader of the revolutionary Jungle &quot;Jangali&quot; Movement (Foresters&#x27; Movement), established the Socialist Soviet Republic of Gilan with the assistance of the Red Army of the Soviet Union.

With the defeat of both the newly formed Soviet Republic of Gilan and the Communist Party, communist and social democrat activity once again went underground. In the early 1920s the Qajar dynasty finally collapsed, and Reza Shah ascended to the throne in 1925, establishing the Pahlavi dynasty. The new Shah introduced many reforms, such as limiting the power of the Shia clergy, but also in turn established an authoritarian dictatorship.

In 1929–30, the party organized strikes in an Isfahan textile mill, the Mazandaran railways, Mashhad carpet workshops, and most importantly, in the British-owned oil industry. The government cracked down heavily and circa 200 communists were arrested; 38 were incarcerated in Qasr Prison in Tehran. Along with the Stalin purges, which took a heavy toll on Iranian communist exiles living in the Soviet Union, these arrests meant the Communist Party of Iran &quot;ceased to exist for all practical purposes outside the walls of Qasr.&quot;

===Foundation of the Tudeh Party===
The British-Soviet Allied invasion of 1941–42 resulted in the end of Reza Shah&#x27;s reign and his forced exile to South Africa. Many political prisoners subsequently received general amnesty by his son and successor Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and under this new atmosphere, nationalist and socialist groups once again flourished. Members of the Marxist &quot;Group of the 53 members&quot; comprised a portion of these political prisoners. In Iran&#x27;s post-Reza Shah era, the latter became a component of Soviet strategy, interests, and plans. Following their release, some of the &quot;Group of the 53 members&quot; including Iraj Iskandari met with a Soviet representative at the residence of Soleiman Eskandari to form the &quot;Hezb-e Tudeh-ye Iran&quot; (&quot;the Party of Iranian masses&quot;), a Marxist–Leninist party appealing to the broad masses. They founded the Tudeh party on 29 September 1941, electing Soleiman Eskandari as party president.

Initially the party was intended to be &quot;a liberal rather than a radical party&quot;, with a platform stressing the importance of &quot;constitutional&quot; and &quot;individual rights&quot;, protecting &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;judicial integrity&quot; from fascism, imperialism, and militarism. &quot;At Soleiman Eskandari&#x27;s urging&quot;, the party initially attempted to appeal to non-secular masses by barring women from membership, organizing Moharram processions, and designating &quot;a special prayer room in its main clubhouse.&quot; This orientation did not last and the party moved &quot;rapidly to the left&quot; within months of its founding.

===Early peak===

In 1944, the party entered the 14th Majlis elections and eight of its candidates were elected. It also established the secret Tudeh Party Military Organization of Iran, or TPMO (&quot;Sazman-e Nezami-ye Hezb-e Tudeh-ye Iran&quot;) made up of officers in the military. The TPMO provided the party with intelligence and information from the military to protect it from the security forces and give it military strength, though historians believe the party had no plan at that time to use the TPMO to stage a coup.

At the same time, Tudeh took a strong stand in favor of women&#x27;s rights, starting in 1943. This included advocating for equal pay for equal work, two months of maternity leave for female workers and otherwise standing for women&#x27;s social rights, working with those who had been fighting for these goals for years and were socialist.
Even so, issues of reproduction, sexuality, and other elements within family life were not discussed.

From this point on the party grew immensely and became a major force in Iranian politics. By early 1945, the party had managed to create the first mass organization in Iran&#x27;s history. Police records later revealed it had an estimated 2,200 hard-core members – 700 of them in Tehran – &quot;10,000s of sympathizers in its youth and women&#x27;s organizations, and 100,000s of sympathizers in its labor and craft unions.&quot; Its main newspaper, &quot;Rahbar&quot; (Leader), boasted a circulation of more than 100,000 – triple that of the &quot;semi-official newspaper&quot; &quot;Ettela&#x27;at.&quot; British ambassador Reader Bullard called it the only coherent political force in the country, and the &quot;New York Times&quot; reckoned it and its allies could win as much as 40% of the vote in a fair election.

This period has been called the height of the party&#x27;s intellectual influence which came in large part from the prestige and propaganda of the Soviet Union as &quot;the world&#x27;s most progressive nation.&quot; Few intellectuals &quot;dared oppose&quot; the party &quot;even if they did not join.&quot; Marking the end of the &quot;near hegemony of the party over intellectual life&quot; in Iran was the resignation from the party of celebrated writer Jalal Al-e-Ahmad to form a socialist splinter group –Third Force– in protest against the Tudeh&#x27;s &quot;nakedly pro-Soviet&quot; policies.

Tarnishing the appeal of the Tudeh in the next two years 1944–46 were Soviet demands for a petroleum concession in northern Iran and the Soviet sponsoring of ethnic revolts in Kurdestan and Azerbaijan. Despite the fact that Tudeh deputies in the Majles had previously vigorously demanded the nationalization of the whole petroleum industry, the Tudeh party supported granting the Soviet petroleum industry in Iran its wishes on grounds of &quot;socialist solidarity&quot;, &quot;internationalism,&quot; and &quot;anti-imperialism.&quot;

From the Iran crisis of 1946 onwards, Tudeh became a pro-Soviet organization and remained prepared to carry out the dictates of the Kremlin, even if it meant sacrificing Iranian political independence and sovereignty. Based on increasingly available archival material from Russia, Iranologist Soli Shahvar contends that this was true much earlier—dating back to the Tudeh Party&#x27;s inception, not just during the Fourteenth Majlis election campaign.

====International Cold War context====
During this time the rest of the international communist movement was also thriving. The communist world expanded dramatically in the decade following World War II with Eastern Europe, China, North Korea, and Vietnam all becoming states dominated by their respective communist parties, usually via military victory. In the United States, Iran was seen as the holder of reserves of petroleum with &quot;vital strategic&quot; value to western countries, and as part of &quot;a Northern Tier&quot; of countries (along with Greece and Turkey) that constituted a geopolitical &quot;first line of defense&quot; for the Mediterranean and for Asia, To counter the activities of the USSR, the CIA established Operation TPBEDAMN in the late 1940s, funded at $1 million a year. It prepared both &quot;disguised (`gray` propaganda) or deliberately misrepresented black propaganda&quot; in the form of &quot;newspaper articles, cartoons, leaflets, and books&quot; which it translated into Persian, most of which &quot;portrayed the Soviet Union and the Tudeh as anti-Iranian or anti-Islamic, described the harsh reality of life in the Soviet Union, or explained the Tudeh&#x27;s close relationship with the Soviets and its popular-front strategy.&quot; In addition, it paid &quot;right-wing nationalist organizations&quot; and some Shia religious figures. Its agents provoked &quot;violent acts&quot; and blamed them on the communists, and hired &quot;thugs to break up Tudeh rallies.&quot; Nonetheless, the party was able to fill the streets of Tehran and Abadan &quot;with tens of thousands of enthusiastic demonstrators&quot; for May Day in 1946.

===1949 crackdown===
In February 1949, there was an attempt on the life of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. The party was blamed by the government and banned. The government &quot;confiscated its assets, dissolved affiliated organizations, especially the Central Council and rounded up some 200 leaders and cadres.&quot;

The party continued to function underground however and by 1950 it had organized its supporters under the banner of the Iran Society for Peace (&quot;Jam&#x27;iyat-e Irani-ye Havadar-e Solh&quot;) and was publishing three daily papers, &quot;Razm&quot;, &quot;Mardom&quot;, and &quot;Besui-ye Ayandeh.&quot; In December 1950, the TPMO, its military organization, managed &quot;to arrange for the escape of key members of the party leadership who had been in jail since early 1949.&quot;

Such suppression was assisted by conservatives detesting the Tudeh Party, which was later outlawed and allied with Mossadegh. One Iranian conservative newspaper even editorialized:

 &quot;...the Tudeh Party, with its satanic doctrine of class struggles, has incited ignorant workers to violate the sacred right of private property and inflict social anarchy upon the center of the country. This uprising proves that Tudeh is an enemy of private property, of Iran, and of Islam. If the government does not stamp out Tudeh, the local revolt will inevitably spread into a general revolution.&quot;

===Mosaddegh era, his overthrow and aftermath===
The party played an important role both directly and indirectly during the pivotal era of Iranian history that began with the 1951 nationalization of the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC), and ended with the 1953 overthrow of Mohammad Mosaddegh by a CIA-led coup d&#x27;état. The party&#x27;s policy &quot;fluctuated&quot;, first attacking Mosaddeq as &#x27;an agent of American imperialism&#x27;, then giving him some support during and after the July 1952 uprising. On 15 August a coup attempt against Mosaddeq was thwarted thanks in part to information uncovered by the Tudeh TPMO military network, but two days later party militants inadvertently helped destabilized the government by staging demonstrations to pressure Mosaddeq to declare Iran a democratic republic. As this would have overturned Iran&#x27;s constitutional monarchy, Mosaddeq reacted by calling out troops to suppress the demonstrators. The party then demobilized late the next day making it unavailable to fight the coup the day after. By 1957 the TPMO was crushed and thousands of party members had been arrested.

====Oil nationalization====

Following World War II, Iranian public support was growing for the nationalization of the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (AIOC) whose profits had greatly exceeded its royalty payments to the Iranian government.

In 1951, Mohammad Mosaddegh, head of the nationalist movement known as the National Front of Iran, led parliament in the nationalization of AIOC, and shortly after was appointed prime minister by the Shah. Mosaddegh oversaw the takeover of British oil facilities and rising economic difficulty and polarization in Iran as the AIOC withdrew its employees and retaliated with a boycott of Iranian oil.

In early April 1951, the Tudeh revealed its &quot;true strength&quot; by launching strikes and riots protesting low wages and poor housing and delays in the nationalization of the oil industry. There were &quot;street demonstrations and sympathy strikes in Tehran, Isfahan, and the northern cities.&quot; Police opened fire on demonstrators. A result was &quot;panic&quot; in Iran&#x27;s parliament at the power of Marxist forces in Iran. With this, it became apparent that Mossaddegh was not a communist and that the Tudeh did not control the government, nor did the party want to overthrow him even as it was establishing a broad public base.

During this period the Tudeh followed a &quot;leftist&quot; rather than &quot;popular front&quot; strategy, refusing to ally with Mosaddegh. Despite the fact that Mosaddegh had introduced a new policy of tolerance toward the party, that both the Tudeh and Mosaddegh had worked for nationalization of the AIOC, and that expropriation of capitalist Western-owned resource extracting corporations by poor countries was central to Marxist–Leninist doctrine, the party vigorously and relentlessly opposed Mosaddegh and his program. In a June 1950 article in its daily &quot;Mardom&quot; it described the effects of Mosaddegh&#x27;s policy thusly:

Already we can be sure that revisions in the southern oil contract will not be in favor of our people and will only result in the consolidation of England&#x27;s position in our country. ... The solution to the oil question is related to the victory of our party, that is, the people of Iran.

On 16 July 1952, Mosaddegh resigned after the shah refused to accept his nomination for War Minister. Mosaddegh appealed to the general public for support, but Tudeh press continued to attack him, describing his differences with the shah &quot;as merely one between different factions of a reactionary ruling elite.&quot; It was only after the explosion of popular support for Mosaddegh in the street that &quot;many rank-and-file&quot; Tudeh party members &quot;could see first hand Mosaddegh&#x27;s popularity&quot;, and came to his aid.

According to one observer:
although diverse elements participated in the July uprising, the impartial observer must confess that the Tudeh played an important part—perhaps even the most important part. ... If in the rallies before March 1952 one-third of the demonstrators had been Tudeh and two-thirds had been National Front, after March 1952, the proportions were reversed.

Ayatollah Abol-Ghasem Kashani, who later switched sides and supported the Shah, &quot;sent a public letter to the pro-Tudeh organizations thanking them for their invaluable contribution&quot; during the uprising toward Mosaddegh&#x27;s victory.

Mosaddeq capitalized on the uprising to establish an emergency rule, which allowed him to bypass the Majles, and also to institute socialist reforms. With the Soviets not wanting to back or &quot;shore up&quot; Tudeh, and Truman refusing demands to overthrow Mosadegh from Clement Attlee and Winston Churchill, it would take the inauguration of Dwight Eisenhower to change the tune, greenlighting the coup operation.

====1953 coup====
During this time the US government became more and more frustrated with Mosaddeq and the stalemate over negotiations with the UK government on control and compensation, with the American ambassador even questioning Mosaddeq&#x27;s &quot;mental stability&quot;. At the same time the Cold War struggle continued to dominate foreign policy thinking in the west. Soviet tanks crushed an anti-communist uprising of strikes and protests in East Germany in June 1953.

As Americans gave up hope on Mosaddeq, their propaganda and covert action campaign against the Tudeh, called TPBEDAMN, expanded to include him. In 1953, American CIA and British intelligence agents, began plotting to overthrow Mosaddeq in a coup d&#x27;état, in large part because of their fear that &quot;rising internal tensions and continued deterioration ... might lead to a breakdown of government authority and open the way for at least a gradual assumption of control by Tudeh,&quot; just as a local communist party had led a coup in Czechoslovakia in 1948, replacing a democratic regime and constitution with a pro-Soviet, one-party Communist government.

The Tudeh also sensed a coup might be coming, and created &quot;vanguard cells&quot; that along with the TPMO, &quot;identified key military installation, army depots, and command and control centers in the capital&quot; Tehran &quot;to react violently to any coup attempt.&quot; Recently released photographs by William Arthur Cram show that Tudeh organized huge demonstrations in August before the coup occurred.

The plotters&#x27; first attempt involved persuading the shah to issue an edict dismissing Mosaddegh and replacing him with retired General Fazlollah Zahedi, while arresting Mosaddegh and taking over other possible centers of opposition. On 15 August the plot was uncovered by Tudeh supporters in the military, and a contingent sent to arrest Mosaddegh was intercepted and arrested themselves. Colonel Mohammad Ali Mobasherri, was a member of the TPMO&#x27;s (secret) three-man secretariat, but also an active member of Tehran Military Governor, the center of the coup operation. Major Hehdi Homaouni served in the shah&#x27;s Imperial Guard and discovered and reported the August plot to the party. In a recent set of documents released by the National Security Archive, which noted pro-Shah demonstrators sacked pro-Tudeh and pro-Mossadegh establishments, it was noted that British and American intelligence agents infiltrated Tudeh so it could blunt Mossadegh. These documents also noted that Eisenhower and Truman differed in their assessments of Mossadegh, with Eisenhower feeling he could not as effectively counter Tudeh as Truman and the CIA in August 1953 downplaying &quot;the likelihood of a Tudeh overthrow attempt&quot; but fears the Tudeh taking power in a more long-term fashion.

The coup attempt created a backlash against its perpetrators, including the shah. The already anti-monarchical Tudeh supporters were radicalized and on the morning of 17 August &quot;an angry crowd began to attack symbols of the monarchy&quot; and demanded its abolition. Mosaddegh, who was aware of Western fears of the Tudeh and who had worked to limit the power of the shah but had &quot;never suggested he was in favor of abolishing the constitutional monarchy,&quot; saw these attacks as a challenge, as removing the shah would violate the constitution. The next day his regime ordered the military into the streets, and &quot;up to 600 mid and low-level Tudeh activists were arrested in Tehran alone.&quot; With its network &quot;severely damaging&quot; the party reversed course once again, and &quot;ordered a demobilization&quot; of its preparations to fight a coup.

Taking advantage of the quiet, the CIA and its Iranian allies struck again, and on 19 August the coup d&#x27;état replaced Mosaddegh with Zahedi. The coup was a major event in Third World and 20th Century history and there is debate as to how much of the blame for the overthrow can be traced to bribes paid by the CIA and how much to domestic dissatisfaction with Mossadegh. Whatever the motivations, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi thereafter assumed dictatorial powers and banned most political groups, including Mosaddegh&#x27;s National Front, which along with the Tudeh Party, continued to function underground.

====Crackdown following coup====
The mass arrests, destruction of its organization and execution of some 40–50 leaders following the coup has been said to have &quot;destroyed&quot; the Tudeh. Between 1953 and 1957, Iranian security forces using &quot;brute force, together with the breaking of the cryptographic code – probably with CIA know-how – … tracked down 4,121 party members.&quot; This constituted the whole Tudeh underground and &quot;more than half the party membership&quot;. Tudeh infiltration of the military by the TPMO totaled 477 members in the armed forces, &quot;22 colonels, 69 majors, 100 captains, 193 lieutenants, 19 noncommissioned officers, and 63 military cadets.&quot; Ervand Abrahamian notes that none of these was in the &quot;crucial tank divisions around Tehran&quot; that could have been used for a coup d&#x27;état and which the Shah had screened carefully. &quot;Ironically, a Tudeh colonel had been in charge of the Shah&#x27;s personal security – as well as that of Vice President Richard Nixon when he visited Iran. The Tudeh had the opportunity to assassinate the Shah and the U.S. vice president but not to launch a coup.&quot; Maziar Behrooz is more optimistic about the party&#x27;s chances of stopping the coup, saying that while &quot;most of the Tudeh officers were in non-combat posts,&quot; they &quot;were in a position to access and distribute weapons. In their memoirs, TPMO high- and middle-ranking members have confirmed their ability to distribute weapons and even assassinate key Iranian leaders of the coup. Hence, with a disciplined party membership, backed by military officers with access to weapons, the Tudeh had a strong hand.&quot;

With the TPMO decimated, the Tudeh network was compromised as the TPMO had &quot;acted as a shield for the party&quot; and helped preserve it immediately after Mosaddeq&#x27;s overthrow. &quot;Many high- and middle-ranking Tudeh leaders were arrested or forced to flee the country. The arrest and execution of Khosro Roozbeh in 1957-8 signaled the end of this process.&quot;

====Tudeh verdict====
After the fact, the party engaged in self-criticism of its policies toward Mosaddeq at its Fourth Plenum held in Moscow in July 1957. They found them &quot;sectarian and leftist&quot; and did not to recognizing &quot;the progressive nature&quot; of the oil nationalization movement.

===Late 1950s and 1960s===
The Sino–Soviet split caused some splintering of the party in the early 1960s, with at least one Maoist group breaking away. In the mid-1960s, the U.S. State Department estimated the party membership to be approximately 1500.

In 1965, the party faced a second division between the mainstream of the organization and the splinter faction, which advocated a violent struggle against the government by arming the tribes of southern Iran. This faction caused a great deal of damage and three years passed before the unity of the party was restored. The remnants of this faction are known as the Labour Party of Iran.

In 1966, several party members, including Ali Khavari and Parviz Hekmatjoo of the Central Committee, and Asef Razmdideh and Saber Mohammadzadeh, were arrested and sentenced to death. This sparked an international outcry and hunger strikes in Europe which forced the government to reduce the sentences to life imprisonment. These events created much international sympathy for the worker&#x27;s struggle in Iran and helped unify the party after the split. The Tudeh Party from this point on becomes established as one of the strongest underground movements and helps to pave the way for the forthcoming Iranian Revolution of 1979.

===Iranian Revolution of 1979===
In the early 1970s, the Iranian guerrilla movement began in northern Iran in the province of Mazandaran. The 1970s also witnessed the birth of widespread worker strikes and demonstrations, and university campuses became a hotbed of revolutionary activity. In 1973, Tudeh released a brochure titled &quot;Oil from Iran and imperialist oil monopolies,&quot; likely advocating for oil nationalization. The Tudeh Party drastically increased its activities, recruiting many youths and organizing regional committees, supporting the Islamic Revolution when others on the left opposed it.

===Islamic Republic===
During the revolution, many political prisoners were freed and the Tudeh Party and other leftist groups were able to participate in the presidential and parliamentary elections for the first time in many years. However, the majority of seats in the Majlis were won by the Islamic Republican Party of Ayatollah Beheshti and leftist and nationalist organizations were forced out of the loop. The newly elected president, Abolhassan Banisadr, who had originally been close with Ayatollah Khomeini, also became increasingly frustrated with the developments that had been taking place and opposed the domination of the clergy and the religious factions in Iranian politics. In addition, the party denounced Amnesty International&#x27;s call to end the summary executions and called it &quot;blatant interference in Iranian affairs&quot;.

In 1981, the Majlis, dominated by the Islamic Republican Party, forced Banisadr out of office, which initiated a wave of protests and demonstrations from all segments of the populace. Banisadr later fled the country. Armed revolutionary committees loyal to Khomeini (which came to be known as the &quot;Pasdaran&quot;) arrested many thousands of youth and activists from both nationalist and leftist groups, many of whom were later tried by Lajevardi, known as the &quot;Hanging Judge&quot;, and executed.

At this point in the history of the Tudeh Party, the Christian and Azeris within the population were prominent.

====Suppression====
While other leftist parties opposed the Islamist forces at this time and were suppressed as a result, Tudeh Party leadership as well as the Fadaian Aksariat decided to support the new clerical theocratic regime. This may have been to try to follow the pro-Tehran line of the Soviet Union.

In 1982, however, the Tudeh broke ranks. The Islamist government of Iran had closed down the Tudeh newspaper and purged Tudeh members from government ministries. According to the Mitrokhin Archive, Vladimir Kuzichkin, a KGB officer stationed in Tehran, had defected to the British in 1982. MI6 used this information and shared the information with the CIA. Their information was then shared with the Iranian government by the CIA, which was secretly courting Iran, as part of the Iran–Contra affair.

Quite quickly the government arrested and imprisoned its leadership and later more than 10,000 members of the party. In February 1983, the leaders of the Tudeh Party were arrested and the Party disbanded, leaving Iran effectively a one-party state. The Tudeh arrests revealed that once again the party had managed to find supporters among the armed forces, as a number of officers, prominent among them Admiral Bahram Afzali, commander of the Iranian navy, were arrested. These arrests ended the alliance between the Tudeh Party and the ruling clergy of Iran and it collapsed, even as the Soviets worked with the Iranians to build up their nuclear capabilities. Even with this agreement, the Iranian government saw the Soviets as &quot;atheistic devils&quot; and the Soviets did not like the government because it had suppressed the Tudeh.

International media, such as UPI, reported that along with the banning of the Tudeh party, 18 Soviet diplomats were expelled from the country for &quot;blatant interference.&quot; At the same time, Tudeh was accused of working on behalf of &quot;foreign powers,&quot; with the suppression praised by Khomeini.

From 1 May 1983 to 1 May 1984 almost all of the Tudeh leadership appeared in videos, first individually and then jointly in an October 1983 &quot;roundtable discussion,&quot; confessing to &quot;treason&quot;, &quot;subversion&quot;, &quot;horrendous crimes&quot;, praising Islam and proclaiming Islamic government&#x27;s superiority over atheistic Marxism–Leninism. British officials supported Iran&#x27;s crackdown and joked about the state torture techniques used to extract the confessions. British officials were pleased by the repression not primarily because they were concerned about Soviet influence in the country since they knew that Iran was quite independent of that, but because they wanted to curry favor with the Iranian regime.

In 1 May 1984 Ehsan Tabari, appeared on television. A man with &quot;50 years of leftist experiences&quot; told viewers he had read &quot;great Islamic thinkers&quot; such as Ayatollah Motahhari in prison following the 1982 crackdown and had now come
to repudiate the works he had written over the past 40 years. He now realized that his entire life&#x27;s work was &#x27;defective&#x27;, &#x27;damaging&#x27;, and &#x27;totally spurious&#x27; because it had all been based on unreliable thinkers – Freemasons nourished by the Pahlavis; secularists such as Ahmad Kasravi; Western liberals and Marxists linked to &#x27;imperialism&#x27; and &#x27;Zionism&#x27; …
In his recantation, Tabari made frequent references to religion, the Twelve Imams and Islamic thinkers and &quot;praised Islam for its `great spiritual strength.`&quot;

The suspicions of outside observers that the confession was not given freely were reinforced by the absence of Taqi Keymanash and &quot;13 other members&quot; of the Tudeh central committee, who died during prison interrogation. The rapid disintegration of the Tudeh at the hands of the state, and the confessions of its leaders led the opposition and remaining party members to seek answers. Explanations ranged from ideological capitulation to the use of Stalinist methods of trial. The remnant of the party outside the country resorted to strange explanations that special drugs created by the CIA and MI-6 were used. The simplest explanation came several years after the television recantations, from a prison visit by a United Nations&#x27; human rights representative (Galindo Pohl) to Iran. The Tudeh Party General Secretary Noureddin Kianouri was reported to have told the representative that he and his wife had been tortured to give false confessions. As evidence, he held up his badly set broken arm. Pohl added that Maryam Firuz had difficulty hearing, swallowing food, and sitting down because of beatings suffered eight years earlier at the hands of the Shah&#x27;s secret police. Kianouri later wrote an open letter to the Ayatollah detailing his mistreatment.

As a result of these purges, a great number of party members left the country into exile. As the party represented the &quot;Soviet view of a preferred leftist movement&quot; that holds a pro-Soviet ideological line and responds to Soviet foreign policy in a supportive manner, the Soviet Union was likely disappointed at the development. It is likely many hundreds Tudeh prisoners were killed during the 1988 executions of Iranian political prisoners when thousands of Mojahedin and leftist prisoners were killed. One report lists 90 Tudeh killed in just some blocks of Evin and Gohar Dasht prisons.

== Electoral history ==

== Estimated membership ==
== Current status ==
Despite the repression, the party has managed to survive. Though since the Iranian Revolution the party is officially banned in Iran and individuals found to be affiliated with communist or socialist groups risk imprisonment, active members have remained and it continues to operate as an underground political organization there. This was mentioned in an Amnesty International report on political prisoners in Iran.

Today, the party leadership is mainly based in exile, as is the new Central Committee, elected in 1992. The party has taken positions against privatization, criticizes the electoral system in the country, and &quot;anti-labor&quot; legislation. In 2017, the party supported Jean-Luc Mélenchon as a leftist force in France, commemorated the Russian Revolution, pledged solidarity with the Venezuelan Communist Party, and criticized Iranian reformists for betraying their ideals. Additionally, the party condemned the missile attacks on Syria in April 2017 by Donald Trump, the only element of the Iranian opposition to do so, and has many wide-ranging party anthems on their website. In 2020, the party condemned the Trump Administration&#x27;s airstrike which killed Qasem Soleimani, while simultaneously criticizing the Iranian government for intervening in both Iraq and Lebanon.

<text>The partial thromboplastin time (PTT), also known as the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT or APTT), is a blood test that characterizes coagulation of the blood. A historical name for this measure is the Kaolin-cephalin clotting time (KCCT), reflecting kaolin and cephalin as materials historically used in the test. Apart from detecting abnormalities in blood clotting, partial thromboplastin time is also used to monitor the treatment effect of heparin, a widely prescribed drug that reduces blood&#x27;s tendency to clot.

The PTT measures the overall speed at which blood clots form by means of two consecutive series of biochemical reactions known as the &quot;intrinsic&quot; pathway and common pathway of coagulation. The PTT indirectly measures action of the following coagulation factors: I (fibrinogen), II (prothrombin), V (proaccelerin), VIII (anti-hemophilic factor), X (Stuart–Prower factor), XI (plasma thromboplastin antecedent), and XII (Hageman factor). The PTT is often used in conjunction with another measure of how quickly blood clotting takes place called the prothrombin time (PT). The PT measures the speed of clotting by means of the &quot;extrinsic&quot; pathway and common pathway.

==Methodology==
Activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) is typically analyzed by a medical technologist or laboratory technician, either manually or using an automated instrument at 37°C, which approximates normal human body temperature. Prothrombin time utilizes complete thromboplastin, a combination of tissue factor and phospholipids. In contrast, APTT employs partial thromboplastin, containing only phospholipids and no tissue factor—hence the term &quot;partial thromboplastin time.&quot; An activator is used in the APTT test to initiate the intrinsic pathway of blood coagulation. Common activators include kaolin, silica, celite, and ellagic acid.
* Blood is drawn into a test tube containing oxalate or citrate, molecules which act as an anticoagulant by binding the calcium in a sample. The blood is mixed, then centrifuged to separate blood cells from plasma (as partial thromboplastin time is most commonly measured using blood plasma).
* A sample of the plasma is extracted from the test tube and placed into a measuring test tube.
* Next, an excess of calcium (in a phospholipid suspension) is mixed into the plasma sample (to reverse the anticoagulant effect of the citrate enabling the blood to clot again).
* Finally, in order to activate the intrinsic pathway of coagulation, an activator is added, and the time the sample takes to clot is measured optically. Some laboratories use a mechanical measurement, which eliminates interferences from lipemic and icteric samples.

==Interpretation==
The typical reference range is between 25 seconds and 33 s (depending on laboratory). Longer times of up to 50 s do apply to infants. Shortening of the PTT is considered to have little clinical relevance, but some research indicates that it might increase risk of thromboembolism. Normal PTT requires the presence of the following coagulation factors: I, II, V, VIII, IX, X, XI and XII. Notably, deficiencies in factors VII or XIII will not be detected with the PTT test.

Prolonged aPTT may indicate:
* Use of heparin or warfarin (or contamination of the sample)
* Vitamin K deficiency
* Antiphospholipid antibody (especially lupus anticoagulant, which paradoxically increases propensity to thrombosis)
* Coagulation factor deficiency (e.g., haemophilia, cirrhosis, von Willebrand disease)
* Coagulation factor consumption (e.g., sepsis, disseminated intravascular coagulation)
* Presence of antibodies against coagulation factors (factor inhibitors)
* Von Willebrand disease

To distinguish the above causes, mixing tests are performed, in which the patient&#x27;s plasma is mixed (initially at a 50:50 dilution) with normal plasma. If the abnormality does not disappear, the sample is said to contain an &quot;inhibitor&quot; (either heparin, antiphospholipid antibodies or coagulation factor specific inhibitors), while if it does disappear a factor deficiency is more likely. Deficiencies of factors VIII, IX, XI and XII and rarely von Willebrand factor (if causing a low factor VIII level) may lead to a prolonged aPTT correcting on mixing studies. 

The aPTT is usually normal in pregnancy but tends to slightly decrease in late pregnancy.

==aPTT-based APC resistance test==
The aPTT-based activated protein C (APC) resistance test is used in the diagnosis of APC resistance (APCR). It involves a modified aPTT test performed in the presence and absence of APC. The ratio of these aPTT values is calculated and is called the APC sensitivity ratio (APCsr) or simply APC ratio (APCr). This ratio is inversely related to the degree of APC resistance. The aPTT-based APC resistance test was developed in 1993.

==History==
The partial thromboplastin time was first described in 1953 by researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The initial exogenous phospholipid used in PTT testing was Cephalin.

<text>Wow-Wow Sauce (sometimes referred to as Bow wow sauce) is a sauce for which the first known recipe was published by William Kitchiner of London in 1817. It contains port, wine vinegar, parsley, pickled cucumbers or pickled walnuts, English mustard and mushroom ketchup in a base of beef stock, flour and butter. A recipe appears in &quot;Enquire Within Upon Everything&quot; (88th edition, 1894).

It is parodied as a sauce of the same name in the &quot;Discworld&quot; novels of Terry Pratchett, in which ingredients including sulfur and saltpetre render it highly explosive. A variant of the above real-world recipe is published in &quot;The Discworld Companion&quot; and &quot;Nanny Ogg&#x27;s Cookbook&quot;.

<doc id="1099092" wikidata="Q25106" url="?curid=1099092" title="Fabrizio De André">
<text>Fabrizio Cristiano De André (; 18 February 1940 – 11 January 1999) was an Italian singer-songwriter and the most-prominent &quot;cantautore&quot; of his time. He is also known as Faber, a nickname given by the friend Paolo Villaggio, as a reference to his liking towards Faber-Castell&#x27;s pastels and pencils, aside from the assonance with his own name, and also because he was known as &quot;&quot;il cantautore degli emarginati&quot; or &quot;il poeta degli sconfitti&quot;&quot;. His 40-year career reflects his interests in concept albums, literature, poetry, political protest, and French music. He is considered a prominent member of the Genoese School. Because of the success of his music in Italy and its impact on the Italian collective memory, many public places such as roads, squares, and schools in Italy are named after De André.

==Biography==
Fabrizio De André was born in Pegli, Genoa, Italy, to an upper-class family. He had a warm, deep voice, and started playing guitar at the age of 14. His father gave him some Georges Brassens records, whose songs influenced the style of his first songs. Brassens also inspired De André to become a libertarian and a pacifist, which was influential in his music and later, more-sophisticated productions.

===1960s===
When he was a student in February 1961, De André debuted, singing two songs in a theater in Genoa. The two songs were later recorded as his first single, &quot;Nuvole barocche&quot; b/w &quot;E fu la notte&quot;, which was released in 1961 and was an imitation of Domenico Modugno. In his following recordings in the early 1960s, De André found a more personal style, mixing literature with traditional songs (in particular Medieval ones), presenting himself as a contemporary troubador and storyteller. His narrative centered on the stories of marginalized people and antiheroes. He later recorded protest songs such as &quot;La ballata del Miché&quot; (&quot;Mickey&#x27;s Ballad&quot;), which he co-wrote with his friend Clelia Petracchi; &quot;La Guerra di Piero&quot; (&quot;Piero&#x27;s War&quot;), an anti-war song, with contributions from Vittorio Centenaro and others. Some of the songs were inspired by his city, Genoa, such as &quot;La Città Vecchia&quot; (&quot;The old (side of the) city&quot;), which he co-wrote with Elvio Monti; and &quot;Via del Campo&quot;, with the music of Enzo Jannacci. He also wrote two songs with his life-long friend Paolo Villaggio, &quot;Il Fannullone&quot; and &quot;Carlo Martello (ritorna dalla battaglia di Poitiers)&quot; (&quot;Charles Martel Returns from the Battle of Poitiers&quot;), in 1963.

In 1962, his first son Cristiano De André was born to his first wife Enrica &quot;Puny&quot; Rignon, who he married in the same year.

His first song to find commercial success was &quot;La canzone di Marinella&quot; (&quot;The song of Marinella&quot;) in 1967, thanks to a television performance by Mina. Following this first success, his first album of new songs was released in 1967 with the title &quot;Volume 1&quot;. The album opens with &quot;Preghiera in Gennaio&quot; (&quot;Prayer in January&quot;), which is dedicated to De André&#x27;s friend Luigi Tenco, a singer-songwriter who committed suicide before the album&#x27;s release during his participation in the Sanremo Festival. Despite the popularity of this festival, De André refused to participate in any song competition by principle, and rarely appeared on television. In 1966, De André&#x27;s first compilation &quot;Tutto Fabrizio De André&quot; was released.

In 1968, De André released &quot;Tutti morimmo a stento&quot;, a concept album sung in Italian, with orchestral arrangements of Gian Piero Reverberi—a first for De André. The lyrics of the first song &quot;Il Cantico dei Drogati&quot; (&quot;Junkies&#x27; Canticle&quot;) were co-written with poet Riccardo Mannerini, one of the most-significant persons in De André&#x27;s life. De André and Mannerini also co-wrote lyrics for the 1968 album of the band New Trolls, &quot;Senza orario Senza bandiera&quot;. In 1969, it was released the album &quot;Volume 3&quot;; due to their lyrics, some of its songs were censored by the national Italian television channel but were broadcast by Vatican Radio.

===1970s===

In 1970 the song &quot;Il pescatore&quot; (&quot;The Fisherman&quot;) was released. The same year, it was released &quot;La buona novella&quot; (The Good News), another concept album that was inspired by the life of Jesus Christ as reported mainly by the Apocryphal gospels. The album was followed in 1971 by &quot;Non al denaro non all&#x27;amore né al cielo&quot; which was inspired by the Spoon River Anthology, a collection of short poems from Edgar Lee Masters, with the collaboration of Nicola Piovani for the music and Giuseppe Bentivoglio for the lyrics. The album&#x27;s booklet contains an interview from Fernanda Pivano, the Italian translator of Masters&#x27; works. In 1973, De André wrote the concept album &quot;Storia di un impiegato&quot;, which is about the protests of those years, also involving Piovani and Bentivoglio. In 1974, he released the album &quot;Canzoni&quot;, which includes re-recordings of many old songs and new translations of songs of Brassens, Leonard Cohen (&quot;Suzanne&quot; and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot;), and Bob Dylan (&quot;Desolation Row&quot;), thanks to the collaboration of Francesco De Gregori. In 1975, the experimental (both musically and linguistically) album &quot;Volume/8&quot; was a collaboration with the songwriter Francesco De Gregori, and includes a translation of a song by Leonard Cohen (&quot;Seems so long ago, Nancy&quot;).

In 1975, De André made his concert debut at &quot;La Bussola&quot; in Viareggio. Before that event, De André refused to perform live concerts because he considered himself more a songwriter than a performer. In the same period, he moved from Genoa to Sardinia. In 1978, his new concept album &quot;Rimini&quot;, which he co-wrote with singer-songwriter Massimo Bubola was released; it includes a translation of Bob Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Romance in Durango&quot; (&quot;Avventura a Durango&quot;). For the first time, he wrote a song in Gallurese, a local language related to Corsican, &quot;Zirichiltaggia&quot; (&quot;Lizard Den&quot;), inspired by the &quot;Ballu tundu&quot;, beginning to show his passion for minority languages and music traditions.

In 1977, his daughter Ludovica Vittoria (nicknamed simply &quot;Luvi&quot;) was born to his partner Dori Ghezzi. Between December 1978 and January 1979, De André toured with the Italian progressive rock band Premiata Forneria Marconi (PFM), from which two live albums (&quot;In Concerto - Arrangiamenti PFM&quot;, vol. 1 and 2) were released. Many years later, in 2020, a video taken from that tour was discovered and published as a DVD with the title &quot;Fabrizio De André e PFM - Il concerto ritrovato&quot;.

On 27 August 1979, De André and Dori Ghezzi were kidnapped in Sardinia. They were not released until December.

===1980s===

Together with Sergio Bardotti De André translated the song &quot;Famous Blue Raincoat&quot; with the title &quot;La Famosa Volpe Azzurra&quot;, which was performed by Ornella Vanoni on her album &quot;Ricetta di donna&quot; (1980).

In 1981, De André and Massimo Bubola released the single &quot;Una storia sbagliata&quot;, which was dedicated to Pier Paolo Pasolini and appeared as an opening theme to an Italian television program. Later in 1981, De André released an album without a title, also known as &quot;L&#x27;Indiano&quot; (The Indian) due to the cover reproducing the painting &quot;The Outlier&quot; by Frederic Remington. The album is more inspired by rock music than De André&#x27;s earlier ones, partly because of the collaboration in songwriting with Bubola. The arrangements were done by the American-born musician Mark Harris, who also sings &quot;Ave Maria&quot; in Sardinian. The track &quot;Hotel Supramonte&quot; was inspired by the De André&#x27;s kidnapping experience. In 1982, De André, who disliked traveling, went on his first and only European tour of Austria, Germany, and Switzerland. In 1984, Joan Baez sang &quot;Marinella&quot; during an Italian television program.

In 1984 the album &quot;Crêuza de mä&quot; was released, a collaboration with the multi-instrumentalist Mauro Pagani, a former member of PFM. This album is very unusual: its music was inspired by the Mediterranean music played with instruments from many local traditions, resulting in a special kind of world music and entirely sung in Genoese. David Byrne, later talking to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, named the album as one of the most-important releases of the decade. In 1985, De André co-wrote the song &quot;Faccia di Cane&quot; however unofficially, which was performed by the New Trolls at the Sanremo Music Festival 1985, where it placed third and won the Prize of the Critic. In 1988 De André sung in the song &quot;Questi posti davanti al mare&quot; together with Francesco De Gregori and Ivano Fossati, who also wrote the song, included in Fossati&#x27;s 1988 album &quot;La pianta del tè&quot;.

In 1985, De André promised his dying father to stop his abuse of alcohol but he continued to be a heavy smoker. In 1989, De André married Dori Ghezzi. Their marriage testimony was witnessed by the actor and life-long friendBeppe Grillo. In the same year, Fabrizio&#x27;s brother Mauro, a corporate lawyer, who also helped Fabrizio with his career, died.

===1990s===
In 1990 De André released &quot;Le nuvole&quot;, a collaboration with Pagani. The album was arranged by Piero Milesi. The first half of the album (side A) is sung in Italian while the second half (side B) is sung in Sardinian, Genoese, and Neapolitan. The album is also credited to Francesco Baccini for some verses of the song &quot;Ottocento&quot;; Baccini later recorded a duet with De André named &quot;Genova Blues&quot;. In 1991, De André toured released the double live album &quot;1991 Concerti&quot;.

In these years, De André collaborated also with other duets in Italian: &quot;Navigare&quot; with Ricky Gianco (1992) and &quot;La Fiera della Maddalena&quot; with Max Mandredi (1994).

De André also collaborated with the band Tazenda, singing a song in Sardinian (&quot;Etta Abba Chelu&quot;) and co-writing the song &quot;Pitzinnos in sa gherra&quot; (&quot;Children in the War&quot;), both of which were included on their 1992 album &quot;Limba&quot;. He sang in Old Occitan with the band Troubaires de Coumboscuro (&quot;Mis Amour&quot;) in 1995. In 1994, he performed the song &quot;Cielito Lindo&quot; in Spanish as an opening theme for an Italian television show of the same name.

In 1996 he released his last album &quot;Anime Salve&quot;, a concept album about solitude, in collaboration with Ivano Fossati. The arrangements are by Milesi. Fossati also duets with De André on two of the songs, the tile track and &quot;Â cùmba&quot;. The first song on the album, &quot;Prinçesa&quot;, is inspired by the autobiography of the transsexual Fernanda Farias De Albuquerque. This song was awarded the Targa Tenco as Song of the Year. The last song of the album &quot;Smisurata preghiera&quot; summarizes the work of writer Álvaro Mutis; De André also released a Portuguese version of the song titled &quot;Desmedida plegaria&quot;, which was included in the score of the film &quot;Ilona Arrives with the Rain&quot;. The song was awarded the Lunezia Prize.
Also in 1996, De André co-wrote his only novel &quot;Un destino ridicolo&quot; with writer Alessandro Gennari; in 2008, this novel inspired the film &quot;Amore che vieni, amore che vai&quot;. In 1997, he recorded a new version of &quot;Marinella&quot;, this time as a duo with Mina, which is included in the compilation &quot;Mi innamoravo di tutto&quot;. During the period 1997–1998, De André went on the longest tour of his career, playing in arenas, open spaces, and theaters. Some of the summer dates were opened by poet and songwriter Oliviero Malaspina, with whom he was planning a collaboration for his next studio album. This long tour had to be interrupted because of the first signs of health problems. He was subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer.

Fabrizio De André died in Milan on 11 January 1999. Two days later, a public funeral took place in the Basilique of Santa Maria Assunta in Carignano, Genoa, in front of a large audience. De André was buried in the family chapel in the Monumental Cemetery of Staglieno.

<doc id="1099118" wikidata="Q717115" url="?curid=1099118" title="Koca Sinan Pasha">
<text>Koca Sinan Pasha (, &quot;Sinan the Great&quot;, ; c. 1506 – 3 April 1596) was an Albanian-born Ottoman Grand Vizier, military figure, and statesman. From 1580 until his death he served five times as Grand Vizier.

==Early life==
Sinan Pasha, also known as &quot;Koca Sinan&quot; (Sinan the Great), was born in Topojan in Luma territory and was of Albanian origin. Sinan Pasha was a descendant of Gjergj Arianiti. In a Ragusan document of 1571 listing members of the Ottoman Sultan&#x27;s governing council, Sinan is described as coming from a Catholic family that converted to Islam. His father was named Ali Bey and Sinan Pasha had family ties with Catholic relatives such as the Giubizzas. Austrian orientalist Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall called him the &quot;unbridled Albanian&quot;. Mustafa Ali of Gallipoli repeatedly criticized Sinan for promoting an Albanian clique in the administration.

==Career==
Sinan Pasha was appointed governor of Ottoman Egypt in 1569, and was subsequently involved until 1571 in the conquest of Yemen, becoming known as &quot;Fātiḥ-i Yemen&quot; (&quot;Conqueror of Yemen&quot;).

In 1580, Sinan commanded the army against the Safavids in the Ottoman–Safavid War (1578–1590), and was appointed grand vizier by Sultan Murad III. Sinan was, however, disgraced and exiled in the following year, owing to the defeat of his lieutenant Mehmed Pasha, at Gori during an attempt to provision the Ottoman garrison of Tbilisi.

Sinan subsequently became governor of Damascus and, in 1589, after the great revolt of the Janissaries, was appointed grand vizier for the second time. He was involved in the competition for the throne in Wallachia between Mihnea Turcitul and Petru Cercel, and ultimately sided with the former, overseeing Petru&#x27;s execution in March 1590. Another revolt of Janissaries led to his dismissal in 1591, but in 1593 he was again recalled to become grand vizier for the third time, and in the same year he commanded the Ottoman army in the Long War against the Habsburgs. He was faced with massive casualties on the northern front, which was weakened by the death of Bosnian commander Telli Hasan Pasha during the Battle of Sisak. In 1593, he captured Veszprém and Palota after 3–4 days of siege and turned his attention to the Sisak, where Telli Hasan Pasha and Ahmed Pasha had died. He soon captured Sisak and came back to Belgrade through Novi Sad. 
When the Habsburgs invaded Szécsény and Nógrád he demanded help from Istanbul. The agha of Janissaries, Sokolluzade Lala Mehmed Pasha, came to help in a short time. In 1593, Sinan Pasha successfully besieged Veszprém and Várpalota. In 1594, he captured Györ (Yanıkkale). In 1594 during the Uprising in Banat, Sinan ordered for the relics (remains) of Saint Sava to be brought from Mileševa to Belgrade, where he then had them set on fire in order to discourage the Serbs.

In spite of his victories he was again deposed in February 1595, shortly after the accession of Mehmed III, and banished to Malkara. In August, Sinan was in power again, called on to lead the expedition against Prince Michael the Brave of Wallachia. His defeat in the Battle of Călugăreni, the Battle of Giurgiu, and the series of unsuccessful confrontations with the Habsburgs (culminating in the devastating siege and fall of Ottoman-held Esztergom), brought him once more into disfavour, and he was deprived of the seal of office (19 November).

The death of his successor Lala Mehmed Pasha three days later caused Sinan to become grand vizier for the fifth time. He died suddenly in the spring of 1596, leaving behind a large fortune. Sinan Pasha is buried in Istanbul near the Grand Bazaar.

== Family ==
He married Esmehan Hanımsultan, granddaughter of Sultan Selim I. They had a son, Mehmed Pasha, and three daughters, Emine Hanım, Hatice Hanım and Hüma Hanım.

==Legacy==

Sinan Pasha became grand vizier five times between 1580 and his death in 1596. He had many rivals but he was also a very wealthy man. During his lifetime Sinan Pasha was criticized by Ottoman bureaucrats such as Mustafa Âlî who wrote that Sinan promoted Albanians into the Ottoman government and military. Contemporary Turkish historians also note that he remained close to his heritage and would give those of Albanian stock preference for high-level positions within the empire. In 1586, at his request, Sultan Murad III issued a decree exempting five villages in Luma from all taxes. Sinan Pasha constructed the fortress of Kaçanik in the Kosovo Vilayet with an &quot;imaret&quot; (soup kitchen), two &quot;hans&quot; (Inn), a &quot;hamam&quot; (Turkish bath) and a mosque that still bears his name.

In 1590, he had the Pearl Kiosk built above the seaward walls on the sea of Marmara. It served as Murad III&#x27;s final residence before his death. One of his final projects in Constantinople was a külliye completed in from 1593 to 1594 by Davut Aga, the chief imperial architect of the time. It is distinguished by the complex masonry and decorations of its türbe and sebil.

He was a major builder of caravanserais, bridges, baths and mosques. These included the town of Kaçanik in Kosovo, important buildings in Sarajevo, Thessalonika and Belgrade, as well as in Istanbul and other countries in the Arab world.
He was a big supporter of Queen Mother Safiye Sultan who was also of Albanian origin

<doc id="1099120" wikidata="Q139617" url="?curid=1099120" title="Social Democrat Hunchakian Party">
<text>The Social Democrat Hunchakian Party (SDHP) (), is the oldest continuously-operating Armenian political party, founded in 1887 by a group of students in Geneva, Switzerland. It was the first socialist party to operate in the Ottoman Empire and in Iran, then known as Persia. Among its founders were Avetis Nazarbekian, Mariam Vardanian, Gevorg Gharadjian, Ruben Khan-Azat, Christopher Ohanian, Gabriel Kafian, and Manuel Manuelian. Its original goal was attaining Armenia&#x27;s independence from the Ottoman Empire during the Armenian national liberation movement.

The party is also known as Hentchak, Henchak, Social-Democratic Hentchaks, Huntchakians, Hnchakian, Henchags, and its name is taken from its newspaper &quot;Hunchak,&quot; meaning &quot;clarion&quot; or &quot;bell&quot;. This is taken by party members to represent &quot;a call or awakening, for enlightenment and freedom&quot;.

==History==
All seven founders of the party were Eastern Armenian Marxist students who had left Russian Armenia to further their education in various universities of Western Europe. They were young, in their twenties, and supported by their affluent bourgeois families. They were influenced by social-democratic revolutionary ideology, contacted Frederick Engels, Georgi Plekhanov, and later Vladimir Lenin. Mariam Vardanian had worked with Russian revolutionaries in Saint Petersburg. For the purpose of furthering revolutionary activity in Turkish Armenia, they formed the Hunchakian Revolutionary Party in August, 1887. The party&#x27;s manifesto, printed in the first issue of &quot;Hunchak&quot; journal, contained this slogan: &quot;Those who cannot attain freedom through revolutionary armed struggle are unworthy of it&quot;.

The Hunchak party fought many battles against the Ottoman Empire, to free the Armenian people from Turkish rule. During this period, many famous intellectuals joined Hunchakian party, including Smpad Piurad, Stepan Sapah-Gulian, Alexander Atabekian, Atrpet, and Aram Andonian. One of Armenia&#x27;s famous national heroes Andranik Ozanian, at first, joined the Hunchak party, but disagreement with party policies led Andranik to leave the Hunchak ranks within less than a year, to join the Dashnaktsutyun party.

In the early days of the formation of Armenian political powers, the Dashnaktsutyun sought &quot;reforms within the framework of the Ottoman Empire&quot;, while the Hunchakian party favored an independent Armenian state. &quot;Hunchak&quot; was the official organ of Hunchakians. In 1894, in Athens and London, the party published a socialist scientific monthly, &quot;Gaghapar&quot;, which for the first time published &quot;The Communist Manifesto&quot; in Armenian, translated by Avetis and Mariam Nazarbekians. The First General Conference of Hunchakian party took place in London, in September 1896.

In the Caucasus, the Hunchakian party has also played a prominent role, it combated the Russification policy of Viceroy Grigory Golitsyn, the Russian governor of Caucasus. In 1903, Paramaz organized the assassination attempt of Grigory Golitsyn. Paramaz was also one of the organizers of the self-defense troops during the Armenian-Tatar massacres of 1905–06.

The Hunchakian party was also active in the international socialist movement, and was represented at the 1904 congress of the Second International by Plekhanov.

===Activities in the Ottoman Empire===
On 27 July 1890, Hunchakian activists Harutiun Jangülian, Mihran Damadian, and Hambartsum Boyajian headed Kum Kapu Affray in Constantinople, which demanded the implementation of reforms in the Western Armenian provinces. 
In the early 1890s, frequent clashes between the Armenian inhabitants of Sason and the Turkish forces took place because of Sassontsis&#x27; refusal to pay retroactive taxes to the Turkish government. 
 In 1894, Sasun Resistance was organized by the Hunchak party under the leadership of Mihran Damadian, Hambartsum Boyajian, Kevork Chavush, and Hrayr Dzhoghk.

In 1913, Hunchakian leader Paramaz participated in the 7th Conference of the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party in Constanta, where he represented the idea of the assassination of Ittihad leaders. But on 15 June 1915, Paramaz with 19 other his comrades were hanged in the central square of Constantinople.

===First Republic of Armenia===
The party also played a role in the establishment of the First Republic of Armenia, as party members took part in the Battle of Sardarapat in 1918, which defended the Armenian capital Yerevan from the Army of Islam of the Ottoman Empire.

===Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic===
After the takeover of the Armenian communists of power in Armenia in 1921 and dissolving of the Democratic Republic of Armenia, and the declaration of the Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic, all political parties apart from the Armenian Communist Party were forbidden. Thus the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party, alongside all the other Armenian traditional political parties, effectively became a party of the Armenian diaspora only.

But the party remained in general a supporter of the development of the Armenian SSR for many decades, in sharp contrast to the Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF) that remained opposed to the Communist regime in Armenia. This resulted at many times in feuds and rifts between the Hunchaks and the Dashnaks in many centers of the Armenian diaspora, a situation becoming worse with religious differences, with the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party supporting Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin of the Armenian Apostolic Church and the ARF supporting the Holy See of Cilicia. In these conflicts, the Armenian Democratic Liberal Party (ADL) was seen as a political ally on the side of the SDHP and in opposition to the ARF.

===Independent Armenia===
Following Armenia&#x27;s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, Yeghia Najarian, headed the SDHP organization in Armenia and founded the &quot;Hnchak Hayastani&quot; official organ. In the early 1990s, the party took part in the self-defense of Zangezur (&quot;Paramaz&quot; battalion) and the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict (&quot;Jirair-Mourad&quot; battalion led by Gevorg Guzelian). The party also remains active throughout the Armenian Diaspora.

On 12 May 2024, members of the central committee of the party met with Armenian President Vahagn Khachaturyan in Los Angeles and discussed relevant political issues such as the demarcation of the Armenia–Azerbaijan border and cooperation with the Armenian diaspora in the United States. The central committee concluded the meeting by reaffirming their readiness to support Armenia&#x27;s statehood and advance national priorities.

===Activities in Lebanon===
In the 1950s, the party clashed, sometimes violently, with the Dashnak Party, due to tensions that escalated when the ARF elected Bishop Zareh as Zareh I, Catholicos of Cilicia, a move that was rejected by the Hunchaks. This period was characterized by an escalation of conflict between the ARF on one side, and the SDHP and the ally ADL (Ramgavars) on the other side.

In the midst of increasing sectarian strife in the late 1960s and early 1970s, which led to the Lebanese Civil War, however, Lebanon&#x27;s Armenian community began to close ranks, and in 1972, the Hunchakian Party ran a joint ticket with the Dashnaks. In 2000, the Hunchakian Party joined forces with Rafik Hariri&#x27;s Future Movement, which swept the city of Beirut. SDHP Central Committee Member Dr Yeghia Jerejian was a member of Lebanese Parliament for many years. 

The party subscribes to a socialist ideology and advocates for a planned economy in Lebanon. The party competes for the six seats reserved for ethnic Armenians in the National Assembly of Lebanon.

==Ideology==
The party declares itself as a national social democratic party. The party advocates for free education and healthcare, the promotion of human rights and equality, maintaining a strong democracy, protecting the environment, and creating a decentralized social economy. The party also supports the unification of Artsakh with Armenia.

In terms of foreign policy, the party supports Armenia developing closer cooperation within European structures, and developing closer ties with Georgia, Iran, China, and Japan. On 28 November 2023, the party announced its support for Armenia to join the European Union and to reduce its dependency on Russia.

==Electoral record==
The party was a previous member of the Armenian National Congress. Prior to the 2021 Armenian parliamentary election, the party announced that it would nominate 4 members to run in the elections under the Democratic Party of Armenia&#x27;s electoral list. Following the election, the Democratic Party of Armenia won just 0.39% of the popular vote, failing to win any seats in the National Assembly. As such, the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party does not have any representation within the National Assembly of Armenia and currently acts as an extra-parliamentary force.

In June 2023, the Social Democrat Hunchakian Party and the European Party of Armenia formed an electoral alliance, known as Dignified Yerevan. The alliance nominated Karen Sargsyan as its candidate for the position of Mayor of Yerevan in municipal elections for September 2023. The alliance, however, dissolved in August 2023 prior to the elections.

==Affiliate organizations==
The Hunchakian party has established affiliate organizations such as the AEBU which is an organization that helps with educational, health and social care, the Dekhrouni Student &amp; Youth Association (founded in 1952, in Beirut), the Gaidz Youth Organization (founded in 1910, in Constantinople), Nor Serount Cultural Association (founded in 1954, in Beirut), and HMM (Homenmen) which is an independent sporting organization but strongly affiliated with the SDHP (not to be confused with Homenetmen considered largely affiliated with the ARF).

==Party publications==

&quot;Hunchak&quot; (also &quot;Hnchak&quot;, &quot;Hentchak&quot;, &quot;Bell&quot; in Armenian) was the official organ of the party. It was founded by Avetis Nazarbekian and published originally in Geneva and later in Montpellier and Paris (France), Greece, London, and Providence (United States), 1887–1915, 1935–1940. The main purpose of the paper was a propaganda organ of the Armenian national movement for the liberation, the resistance in Western Armenian regions. &quot;Hunchak&quot; also supported the ideology of social-democracy and worker&#x27;s consolidation.

Present-day party publications include:
*&quot;Ararad&quot; daily newspaper published in Beirut, Lebanon
*&quot;Tchahagir&quot; weekly published in Cairo, Egypt
*&quot;Massis&quot; weekly and the online &quot;MassisPost&quot; published in Los Angeles
*&quot;Nor Serounti Tsayn&quot; (Voice of the New Generation - Nor Serount) published in London, UK
*&quot;Zank&quot; Armenian journal, Australia
*&quot;Loussapatz, published monthly from Nor Serount Toronto&quot;, Canada

==Recent developments==
The party&#x27;s 20th General Conference took place in September 2013, in Yerevan and Tsaghkadzor, with the participation of delegates from 17 countries.

The party&#x27;s 22nd General Conference took place in September 2022, in Yerevan (coinciding with the 135th anniversary of the party&#x27;s founding), with the participation of delegates from 14 countries.

<doc id="1099128" wikidata="Q1891409" url="?curid=1099128" title="Japanese aircraft carrier Taihō">
<text>was an aircraft carrier of the Imperial Japanese Navy during World War II. Possessing heavy belt armor and featuring an armored flight deck (a first for any Japanese aircraft carrier), she represented a major departure from prior Japanese aircraft carrier design and was expected to not only survive multiple bomb, torpedo, or shell hits, but also continue fighting effectively afterwards.

Built by Kawasaki at Kobe, she was laid down on 10 July 1941, launched almost two years later on 7 April 1943 and finally commissioned on 7 March 1944. She sank on 19 June 1944 during the Battle of the Philippine Sea due to explosions resulting from design flaws and poor damage control after suffering a single torpedo hit from the American submarine USS &quot;Albacore&quot;.

==Design==
&quot;Taihō&quot; was approved for construction in the 1939 4th Supplementary Programme. Her design was that of a modified . Under the Modified Fleet Replenishment Program of 1942, &quot;Taihō&quot; was to be the first of a new generation of Japanese aircraft carriers, which would include &quot;Taihō&quot;, 15 of a modified design (which turned into the ) and five of an improved &quot;Taihō&quot; design (G-15 Project).

===Hull===
&quot;Taihō&quot;″s waterline belt armor varied between abreast the machinery to around the magazines. The armor below the waterline was designed to withstand a charge.

The weight of &quot;Taihō&quot;″s armor immersed her hull so deeply that her lower hangar deck was barely above the load waterline and the bottoms of her two elevator wells (which formed the roofs of her fore and aft aviation fuel tanks) were actually below the waterline. This latter fact played an important role in her subsequent destruction during the Battle of the Philippine Sea.

&quot;Taihō&quot;″s aviation fuel tanks were only partially protected with armor, as naval designers opted earlier to devote greater protection to their carriers&#x27; bomb and torpedo magazines. The empty air spaces around the aviation fuel tanks turned out to be the ship&#x27;s downfall; all subsequent Japanese carriers had theirs filled with concrete to protect against splinters and shock damage, although it was poor damage control that ultimately sank &quot;Taihō&quot;.

To improve seakeeping and airflow over the forward end of the deck, &quot;Taihō&quot;″s bow was plated up to flight deck level, giving her a similar appearance to British s.

===Machinery===
&quot;Taihō&quot;″s eight oil-fired Kampon RO-GO boilers were capable of generating . Her four Kampon steam turbines were each geared to separate propeller shafts. She had a top speed of . &quot;Taihō&quot;″s maximum fuel oil storage of gave her a radius of at .

&quot;Taihō&quot; had two rudders positioned along the longitudinal center-line of the ship: a semi-balanced main rudder (so-called because a portion of the rudder comes before the hinged axis and therefore requires less force to turn) located astern and an unbalanced auxiliary rudder forward of the main rudder. Both were turned via electro-hydraulically powered steering gears, but the auxiliary rudder could also be turned via a diesel engine in the event the primary steering gear was damaged.

===Flight deck===
&quot;Taihō&quot; was the first Japanese aircraft carrier to feature an armored flight deck, designed to withstand multiple bomb hits with minimal damage. The armor varied slightly in thickness between and formed a protective lid over an enclosed upper hangar whose sides and ends were unarmored. The floor of the upper hangar was also unarmored but the lower hangar deck had plating. &quot;Taihō&quot;″s flight deck, measuring long and wide, had the largest total area of any Japanese carrier until the completion of and was offset to port to compensate for the weight of her island structure. Unlike all pre-war Japanese carriers, &quot;Taihō&quot;″s flight deck was not wooden-planked. Rather, the steel deck was covered with a newly developed latex coating approximately thick. This offered several advantages over wood: it was cheaper, it saved weight, it required fewer man-hours to apply and it was less likely to interfere with air operations in the event of minor damage. On the negative side, the material had only mediocre anti-skid qualities and tended to become brittle and crack over time.

Fourteen hydraulically operated arrester wires were distributed transversely across the flight deck between the fore and aft elevators. &quot;Taihō&quot; also had three hydraulically powered crash barriers, designed to abruptly stop any plane failing to catch an arrester wire upon landing. Two were located abreast the island and one was set at the bow. &quot;Taihō&quot; was equipped with two large armored elevators, capable of transferring aircraft weighing up to between decks. The elevators were widely spaced apart, with one at the far aft end of the ship and one forward of the island. It was originally desired to install a third elevator amidship, but because of wartime urgency this was deleted from the final design, thus saving both time and material. The elevators were roughly pentagonal in shape, with the aft elevator measuring long and wide. The forward elevator was slightly smaller in width. It took approximately 15 seconds to raise an aircraft from the lower hangar deck to the flight deck and the same to lower one.

===Hangars===
&quot;Taihō&quot;″s upper and lower hangars were approximately long and high. The upper hangar was wider than the lower. Fighters were normally stowed in the middle and forward sections of the upper hangar and were raised to flight deck level using the bow elevator to facilitate more rapid handling. Dive bombers occupied the remaining upper hangar spaces with torpedo bombers stowed in the lower hangar. With greater all-up weights and longer take-off runs than the fighters, these planes were brought up to the flight deck using the aft elevator where they could then be spotted as far astern as possible.

As a fire safety precaution, the carrier&#x27;s two hangars were divided into sections (five on the upper and four on the lower), separated by fire-proofed fabric curtains. The curtains were intended to limit the supply of air to and delay the spread of any fire breaking out on the hangar decks. Further protection against fire was supplied by a foam spray system fed by two rows of pipes and nozzles running along the walls and ends of the hangars. The lower hangar could also be flooded with carbon dioxide where the likelihood of fuel vapor build-up was greatest.

&quot;Taihō&quot;″s original design specified installation of two catapults on her forward bow for power-assisted take-offs. However, as the Imperial Japanese Navy had not developed a workable catapult for carrier decks by the time of &quot;Taihō&quot;″s construction, these were eventually deleted from the requirements. The IJN instead opted to use rocket-assisted take-off gear (RATOG) when necessary. This consisted of two solid-propellant (cordite) rockets attached to either side of a plane&#x27;s fuselage. Generating of thrust for three seconds, they were able to get an aircraft airborne in a much shorter distance than normally required.

On &quot;Taihō&quot;″s port side, abreast the aft elevator, stood a collapsible crane with a lifting capacity. When not in use, it could be folded and lowered below flight deck level through an opening in the deck, thus eliminating a potentially hazardous obstruction during air operations.

&quot;Taihō&quot;″s single large funnel, built into the island, was angled 26° from the vertical to starboard and carried the ship&#x27;s exhaust gases well clear of the flight deck. This arrangement, atypical of most Japanese carriers, was similar to that successfully employed on and and would later be repeated on .

Three Type 96 searchlights were positioned along the outer edges of the flight deck: two on the port side and one to starboard, just aft of the island. Like the collapsible crane, these could be lowered below flight deck level to prevent interference with normal flight activity. A fourth searchlight was mounted to the starboard side of the carrier&#x27;s island on a projecting sponson.

===Armament===
&quot;Taihō&quot;″s armament comprised 12 of the brand-new /65 caliber Type 98 anti-aircraft guns arranged in six twin-gun turrets: three on the port side and three to starboard. The guns were electro-hydraulically powered; however, in the event of a power failure they could function manually at reduced effectiveness. Operated by a crew of 11, the average firing rate was 15 rounds per minute with a maximum effective horizontal range of and a maximum effective vertical range of .

In addition, &quot;Taihō&quot; carried 17 triple-mount anti-aircraft cannons (51 barrels total). Sixteen of these were mounted on sponsons just below flight deck level: eight to port, six to starboard and two at the stern. The 17th unit was positioned on the flight deck, just ahead of the island. The triple-mounts were electrically powered (though manual operation was possible) and normally required a crew of nine. They had a practical firing rate of 110–120 rounds per minute and a maximum effective range of . The Type 96 cannon was the Japanese Navy&#x27;s standard small-caliber anti-aircraft weapon from 1936 through the end of the war in 1945 and was an adaptation of a French design. Additionally, there were 25 portable Type 96 guns which were usually hung on hangar walls and after the plane departed were secured on metal fittings which usually held the aircraft on the deck.

&quot;Taihō&quot; had two Type 94 triaxially stabilized fire control directors, one mounted on the flight deck ahead of the island and one amidships on the port side, just below flight deck level. These controlled the gun turrets and were electro-hydraulically powered. The triple-mount cannons were controlled by seven Type 95 fire control units, each of which could direct the fire of two or three mounts.

===Radar===
&quot;Taihō&quot;″s original design made no provisions for radar installation as the Imperial Japanese Navy did not possess any shipborne surface, fire control or air search radar at the war&#x27;s outset in September 1939. Not until January 1941, when a Japanese naval technical mission arrived in Germany, did the IJN learn that European nations were using pulsed radar for combat purposes. In August that same year, the Navy Ministry initiated a crash plan to speed up radar development, resulting in (among others) the Type 21 and Type 13 air search radars.

Prior to completion in 1944, &quot;Taihō&quot; was fitted with two Type 21 air search radars, one mounted atop the island on the anti-aircraft control platform and one on the lower bridge deck at the aft end of the island. She also had one Type 13 air search set installed with an antenna mounted on the signal mast above the bridge. The Type 21 had a maximum effective range of while the Type 13 had a range of .

===Aircraft===
&quot;Taihō&quot;″s planned air complement varied considerably throughout her design and construction. Initially, it was envisioned she would carry 126 aircraft (with 30 of these in reserve). Later, this was pared down to 64, raised again to 78 and finally reduced to 53. One reason for the discrepancy in numbers was (in sharp contrast to the United States) the Imperial Japanese Navy&#x27;s lack of insistence that its carrier planes have the smallest possible folded wingspan (many designs&#x27; folded only near the tips, while the wings of the Yokosuka D4Y &quot;Suisei&quot; dive-bomber did not fold at all). Her aircraft capacity was also changed based on previous wartime experience and the fact that &quot;Taihō&quot; was expected to carry larger newer-model carrier planes still under development at the time of her construction: 24 Mitsubishi A7M2 &quot;Reppu&quot; &quot;Sam&quot; fighters, 25 Aichi B7A2 &quot;Ryusei&quot; &quot;Grace&quot; torpedo-dive bombers and four Nakajima C6N1 &quot;Saiun&quot; &quot;Myrt&quot; reconnaissance planes. As none of these types were available at the time of her commissioning, &quot;Taihō&quot; went to sea with older-model aircraft.

Prior to 13 June 1944, &quot;Taihō&quot; carried 65 aircraft: 22 Mitsubishi A6M5 &quot;Reisen&quot; (Zero) fighters, 22 Yokosuka D4Y1 &quot;Suisei&quot; &quot;Judy&quot; dive bombers (of which four were the D4Y1-C reconnaissance types), three Aichi D3A2 &quot;Val&quot; dive bombers and 18 Nakajima B6N2 &quot;Tenzan&quot; &quot;Jill&quot; torpedo bombers. By 19 June 1944, however, the day the Battle of the Philippine Sea took place, she had already lost nine aircraft due to various causes and had just 56 planes remaining for actual combat.

==Service history==

===Battle of the Philippine Sea===

&quot;Taihō&quot; was formally commissioned on 7 March 1944. After several weeks of service trials in Japan&#x27;s Inland Sea, she was deployed to Singapore, arriving there on 5 April. &quot;Taihō&quot; was then moved to Lingga Roads, a naval anchorage off Sumatra, where she joined veteran carriers and in the First Carrier Division, First Mobile Force. All three carriers engaged in working up new air groups by practicing launch and recovery operations and acting as targets for mock aerial attacks staged from Singapore airfields by their own planes. On 15 April, Vice-Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa officially transferred his flag from &quot;Shōkaku&quot; to &quot;Taihō&quot; to take advantage of the carrier&#x27;s extensive command facilities. Shortly thereafter, the First Mobile Force departed Lingga and arrived on 14 May at Tawi-Tawi off Borneo, where the fleet could directly refuel with unrefined Tarakan Island crude oil and await execution of the planned Kantai Kessen (&quot;decisive battle&quot;) known as Operation A-GO.

When American carrier strikes against the Marianas indicated an invasion of Saipan was imminent, the Japanese Combined Fleet staff initiated Operation A-GO on 11 June. &quot;Taihō&quot; and the rest of Ozawa&#x27;s First Mobile Force departed Tawi-Tawi on 13 June, threading their way through the Philippine Islands and setting course for Saipan to attack American carrier forces operating in the vicinity.

====Fate====

On 19 June 1944, &quot;Taihō&quot; was one of nine Japanese aircraft carriers involved in the Battle of the Philippine Sea. At 07:45 she turned into the wind to launch her contribution (16 Zeros, 17 &quot;Judy&quot; dive bombers and 9 &quot;Jill&quot; torpedo bombers) to Ozawa&#x27;s second attack wave. As &quot;Taihō&quot;″s planes circled overhead to form up, American submarine , which had spotted Ozawa&#x27;s carriers earlier that morning, reached an ideal attack position and fired a spread of six torpedoes at the carrier. One of &quot;Taihō&quot;″s strike pilots, Warrant Officer Sakio Komatsu, saw the torpedo wakes, broke formation and deliberately dived his plane into the path of one torpedo; the weapon detonated short of its target and four of the remaining five missed. The sixth torpedo, however, found its mark and the resulting explosion holed the carrier&#x27;s hull on the starboard side, just ahead of the island. The impact also fractured the aviation fuel tanks and jammed the forward elevator between the flight deck and upper hangar deck.

With the ship down 1.5 m (5 ft) by the bows due to flooding, the forward elevator pit filled with a mixture of seawater, fuel oil and aviation gasoline, &quot;Taihō&quot;″s captain marginally reduced her speed by a knot and a half to slow the ingress of seawater into the hull where the torpedo had struck. As no fires had started, Vice-Admiral Ozawa ordered that the open elevator well be planked over by a flight deck damage control party in order to allow resumption of normal flight operations. By 09:20 am, using wooden benches and tables from the petty officers&#x27; and sailors&#x27; mess rooms, this task was completed. Ozawa then launched two more waves of aircraft.

Meanwhile, leaking aviation gasoline accumulating in the forward elevator pit began vaporizing and the fumes soon permeated the upper and lower hangar decks. The crew recognised the danger but, through inadequate training, lack of practice or incompetence, their response was ineffectual. They bungled attempts to pump out the damaged elevator well, and failed to cover the fuel with foam from the hangar&#x27;s fire suppression system.

Because &quot;Taihō&quot;″s hangars were completely enclosed, mechanical ventilation was the only means of exhausting fouled air and replacing it with fresh air. Ventilation duct gates were opened on either side of hangar sections No. 1 and No. 2 and, for a time, the carrier&#x27;s aft elevator was lowered to try to increase the draught. But this failed to have any appreciable effect and air operations were resumed about noon, requiring the elevator to be periodically raised as aircraft were brought up to the flight deck. In desperation, damage control parties used hammers to smash out the glass in the ship&#x27;s portholes.

====Sinking====
&quot;Taihō&quot;″s chief damage control officer eventually ordered the ship&#x27;s general ventilation system switched to full capacity and, where possible, all doors and hatches opened to try to rid the ship of fumes. However, this just resulted in saturation of areas previously unexposed to the vapors and increased the chances of accidental or spontaneous ignition. About 14:30 that afternoon, 6½ hours after the initial torpedo hit, &quot;Taihō&quot; was jolted by a severe explosion. A senior staff officer on the bridge saw the flight deck heave up, and the sides of the ship blew out. &quot;Taihō&quot; dropped out of formation and began to settle in the water, clearly doomed. Though Admiral Ozawa wanted to go down with the ship, his staff prevailed on him to survive and to transfer his flag to the cruiser . Taking the Emperor&#x27;s portrait, Ozawa transferred to &quot;Haguro&quot; by destroyer. After he left, &quot;Taihō&quot; was torn by a second thunderous explosion and sank stern first at 16:28, taking 1,650 officers and men out of a complement of 2,150 down with her.

She sank at coordinates .

<text>Makkal Tamil Desam Katchi (People&#x27;s Tamil Land Party, in Tamil: மக்கள் தமிழ் தேசம் கட்சி), generally just called Makkal Tamil Desam (MTD) is a political party in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. MTD was founded on 22 August 2000. MTD has its base amongst the Yadava(Konar)(ietaiyar)ietaiyan) caste in the north and southern parts of the state. The Tamil Nadu Yadava Mahasabai supported the formation of the party. The party leader is S. Kannappan, a former All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) minister. Kannappan had been expelled from AIADMK before the foundation of MTD.

Ahead of the 2001 Tamil Nadu assembly elections MTD joined the National Democratic Alliance (NDA).

On 6 May 2002, the Puducherry unit of MTD broke away and joined Indian National Congress.

In the 2004 MTD took part in the People&#x27;s Alliance, the third front in Tamil Nadu together with Janata Dal (United), Puthiya Tamizhagam and the Dalit Panthers of India. This front was basically formed by groups who were dissatisfied that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had put NDA aside in Tamil Nadu and instead had launched a pure BJP-AIADMK front in the elections. MTD contested under the JD(U) symbol.</text><links>

<text>The People&#x27;s Party () is a Panamanian Christian democratic political party. Founded in 1956, it was made up of middle-class professionals, intellectuals and students, with support from trade unions, particularly the Federation of Christian Workers. It went on to become one of Latin America&#x27;s most conservative and anti-communist Christian democratic parties. The ideological foundation of the party is based on the social doctrine of the Catholic Church. The PP is a full member of the Christian Democrat International and Christian Democratic Organization of America.

== History ==

The People&#x27;s Party traces its origins to the “First Week of Christian Studies,” which met at Las Cumbres in March 1956. Those who participated in this and the “Second Week of Christian Studies” in July 1956 included intellectuals who had expressed their desire for Social Christian action. The group that organized these meetings formally established itself on 12 April 1956 and first called itself Social Democratic Action (). From 1957 to 1960 it called itself the National Civic Union () for the Christian Democratic Movement. In 1960, the organizers decided on the name Christian Democratic Party of Panama (, PDC).

The PDC&#x27;s leading figures were middle-class professionals, intellectuals and students, but support also came from the trade union. In particular, the Federation of Christian Workers, established in 1961, was closely aligned with the PDC.

Early in 1964 the party chose its first set of candidates for a national election. For that year&#x27;s elections, the PDC presented its first presidential candidate, José Antonio Molino, who was supported by Panama&#x27;s Teachers Union. He received 9,681 votes (2.98%), coming in fourth among seven nominees. That was considered a success for the new party and was enough to assure its registration as a legal party. The Christian Democrats continued to be a small but well-organized element in Panamanian politics in the succeeding years. In the 1968 general election, the PDC candidate, Antonio González Revilla, received 11,371 votes (3.55%). In 1964 and 1968 the PDC won one parliamentary seat.

In 1968, the radical wing of the leadership was expelled, and the increasingly right-wing party supported the government of Arnulfo Arias. It was backed by a tiny electorate consisting of urban professionals and a business group led by the Romero family. Arias chose a member of the PDC as minister of education, but his government lasted only 11 days.

All political parties such as the PDC were banned by Omar Torrijos after the military coup of 1968. During the Torrijos government (1968–1978), the Christian Democrats opposed the military regime and called for a civilian-ruled democracy. In the 1970s and the 1980s, the PDC was generally regarded as a well-organized and binding element of the opposition. The PDC was one of the few parties within National Opposition Front (FRENO) (a coalition of eight opposition parties formed in March 1979) that offered a programmatic alternative to military government policy by calling for substantial social reforms and expanded participation in democratic processes. The PDC advocated for introducing nationalist social reforms to preclude revolutionary action. Its leader, Ricardo Arias Calderón, was the main promoter of the formation of a united opposition against the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). The leaders of the party strongly opposed the government, seeing in its actions &quot;a furthering of communist penetration into Central America.&quot;

The PDC re-registered on 28 August 1980. The PDC won 20.6% of the vote and two seats in the 1980 legislative elections (to 19 of the 56 seats in the newly formed National Legislative Council, the other 37 being filled by nominees of a non-party National Assembly of Community Representatives established in 1972).

In December 1981, Calderón was elected president of the Organization of Christian-Democratic Parties of America.

In 1984, it was part of the Democratic Opposition Alliance (ADO), which supported the presidential candidacy of Arnulfo Arias of Authentic Panameñista Party (PPA). Ricardo Arias Calderón was a Second Vice-Presidential candidate. The ADO lost the presidential and legislative elections following suspected widespread fraud by the military. In 1987, the PDC became increasingly involved in confrontations with the government, openly campaigning by strikes (supported mainly by businesses rather than labor unions) and street demonstrations (which were often violently repressed) for the resignation or removal of General Manuel Noriega. Ricardo Arias Calderón referring to charges against Manuel Noriega of murder, drug trafficking, corruption, and electoral fraud, described him as &quot;virtually a dictator and gangster&quot;.

For the 1989 elections, the PDC was the main component of the Democratic Alliance of Civic Opposition (ADOC), with the Guillermo Endara as the coalition&#x27;s presidential candidate. Calderón was viewed as a likely successor to Arias as the principal spokesman for the opposition, eventually accepting nomination as ADOC First Vice-Presidential candidate in 1989.

The PDC polled 261,598 votes (40.18%), coming in first among twelve nominees. After the official ratification of the results following the US military invasion in December 1989, Calderón became First Vice-President and Interior and Justice Minister, and the PDC became the largest party in the Legislative Assembly with 28 of the 67 seats. Emboldened by a plurality within the Legislative Assembly, the PDC was estranged from its coalition partners in September 1990 when they joined with the opposition PRD to reject its nominees for chamber officials. The party stayed within the ADOC until April 1991, when its ministerial delegation was ousted by President Guillermo Endara for displaying &quot;disloyalty and arrogance.&quot; That had followed months of infighting during which Calderón had publicly described Guillermo Endara&#x27;s economic program, which advocated severe austerity measures and the privatization of state enterprises, as &quot;senseless.&quot; Its withdrawal from the ADOC coalition government caused a political crisis.

In succeeding months, the PDC became the leader of the opposition, to such an extent that it was exerting strong influence within such organizations as the Civic Crusade, an organization from which Endara had drawn his strongest support and called for a plebiscite to decide on his desirability of Endara remaining in office. In September 1991, the PDC was judged firmly to have secured its political influence on parliamentary committees as a direct result of facilitating the victory of a dissident Authentic Liberal Party (PLA) candidate in the election of a new President of the Legislative Assembly. Calderón resigned as First Vice-President of the Republic in December 1992 in a move that was seen as reflecting a desire to distance himself from Endara.

In 1994, Eduardo Vallarino, the candidate of PDC, unsuccessfully ran in the presidential elections, obtaining only 25,476 votes (2.39%). As a result, the party only managed to gain one seat in the legislative elections. For the 1999 elections, the PDC was the main component of the Opposition Action Alliance (AAO), with the PDC&#x27;s Alberto Vallarino Clement as the coalition&#x27;s presidential candidate. He polled 221,459 votes (17.38%) and came fourth (the PDC – 140,824 and 11.05%). The PDC won 5 legislative seats.

On 10 September 2001, the PDC changed its name to People&#x27;s Party. In 2004, the PP allied with the New Fatherland (PN) and its candidate Martín Torrijos Espino of Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). In 2009, the PP allied with the One Country for All (UPPT) and its candidate Balbina Herrera of Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD).

In 2014, the PP allied with the Panameñista Party and its candidate Juan Carlos Varela to form the El Pueblo Primero alliance, which won the election with 39% of the vote on May 4, 2014. As a result, several members of the party served in the Varela Administration, highlighted by the party&#x27;s president Milton Henriquez serving as Minister of Government.

The PP is a full member of the Christian Democrat International and Christian Democratic Organization of America.

<text>The People&#x27;s Party of Panama (, PPP) is an unregistered communist party in Panama. It was founded on 4 April 1930 as the Communist Party of Panama (&quot;Partido Comunista de Panamá&quot;, PCP), after Panamanian communists broke away from the Labour Party. Early leaders of the PCP included Eliseo Echévez and Cristóbal Segundo. The PCP joined the Communist International and reached its apogee of popularity during and right after World War II. In 1943 the PCP changed its name to the People&#x27;s Party of Panama.

The small but well-organized party then exerted considerable influence on the Panamanian Federation of Students and on the trade union movements in Panama and the Canal Zone. It long controlled the Trade Union Federation of Workers of Panama. &quot;After World War II the party concentrated on attacking the United States presence in Panama, leading the Panamanian government to crack down on it and then outlaw it in 1953. Subsequently, Communist influence in Panama&#x27;s trade unions declined greatly and many party members defected to other groups&quot;.

In the mid-1960s, the U.S. State Department estimated the party&#x27;s membership to be approximately 400.

Although small in membership, for several years during the 1970s the PPP acted as the principal source of organized political support for the Omar Torrijos government, particularly on the Panama Canal issue. It resisted the formation of the broader based Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) and lost a considerable amount of its power during the late 1970s as a result. The party was permitted to operate semi-publicly. In 1979 it applied for formal recognition and, with some 77,000 members, was easily able to demonstrate the required level of support. One of its candidates, running as an independent, obtained a Legislative Council seat in 1980.

In 1984 the party broke from the pro-government National Democratic Union (UNADE) coalition because UNADE no longer followed the reformist ideas of Omar Torrijos. The PPP ran its own presidential candidate in 1984 (Carlos Del Cid); in 1989 it allied with the National Liberation Coalition (COLINA) and its candidate Carlos Duque.

Since 1951 the General Secretary of the PPP has been Ruben Darío Sousa Batista (sometimes known by his pseudonym, Vicente Tello).

The PPP was derecognized by the Electoral Tribunal on 1 July 1991.
