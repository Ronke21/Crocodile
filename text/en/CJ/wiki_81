<text>Ray Comfort (born 5 December 1949) is a New Zealand-born Christian minister, evangelist and young Earth creationist who lives in the United States. Comfort started Living Waters Publications, as well as the ministry &quot;The Way of the Master&quot;, in Bellflower, California, and has written several books.

==Early life==
According to Comfort&#x27;s autobiography, his parents put &quot;Methodist&quot; on his birth certificate but he was given no religious instruction as a child. Comfort identifies himself as both Christian and Jewish.

==Career==
In 1989, Comfort accepted an invitation to join the pastoral staff at the non-denominational Calvary Chapel in Southern California.

===The Way of the Master ministry===
In the mid-1990s Comfort persuaded Kirk Cameron, star of the cancelled hit sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot;, to become an evangelist. In 2002, the pair formed an organization called the Way of the Master, with the intention of teaching the church to more effectively preach the message of evangelical Christianity.

Comfort says that evangelism is the main reason the Christian Church exists and that many of the evangelistic methods used over the last century have produced false conversions to Christianity. Comfort often uses the Ten Commandments to speak about sin before presenting the gospel of Jesus. In the mid-1980s he formulated two sermons entitled &quot;Hell&#x27;s Best Kept Secret&quot; and &quot;True and False Conversions.&quot;

Comfort speaks professionally at churches and evangelism seminars, and preaches in Huntington Beach, California. As well as co-hosting the former &quot;The Way of the Master Radio&quot; with Kirk Cameron, he is co-host of &quot;The Way of the Master Television Show&quot;.

In 2006, Comfort recorded a segment for &quot;The Way of the Master&quot;&#x27;s television show in which he claimed that the banana was &quot;the atheist&#x27;s nightmare&quot;, arguing that it displayed many user-friendly features that were evidence of intelligent design. Comfort retracted the video and claims upon learning that the banana is a result of artificial selection by humans, and that the wild banana (&quot;Musa acuminata&quot;) is small and unpalatable.

===Debates===

On 13 April 2001, Comfort appeared at the 27th National Convention of American Atheists in Orlando, Florida, where he debated Ron Barrier, the National Spokesperson for American Atheists. Comfort later stated that &quot;they laughed at my humor, and although there was unified mockery at some of the things that I said, I was able to go through the Ten Commandments, the fact of Judgment Day, the reality of Hell, the Cross, and the necessity of repentance, and no one stopped me.&quot;

On 5 May 2007, Comfort and Cameron participated in a televised debate with Brian Sapient and Kelly O&#x27;Connor of the Rational Response Squad, at Calvary Baptist Church in Manhattan. The debate, which was moderated by &quot;Nightline&quot; correspondent Martin Bashir, focused on the existence of God, which Comfort claimed he could prove scientifically without relying on the Bible. During the debate, Cameron and Comfort both denied Charles Darwin&#x27;s theory of evolution.

==Publications==
===Tracts===

According to Comfort, he has designed dozens of gospel tracts since the 1970s, and sells millions of Living Waters tracts each year. Some of his tracts are designed to resemble paper money, including fake $100, $1,000 and $1 million bills. Others employ novelties intended to amuse, such as a &quot;ticket to heaven&quot; that invites the reader to tear it if they do not need it; the ticket is printed on a type of plastic, making it difficult to rip. The tracts typically attempt to persuade the reader that on judgment day, they will certainly be found guilty of breaking one or more of the Ten Commandments, and therefore will be sent to hell, unless they say a prayer to acknowledge Christ&#x27;s substitutionary atonement.

In June 2006, agents of the US Secret Service confiscated thousands of Ray Comfort&#x27;s &quot;Million Dollar Bill&quot; gospel tracts from Darrel Rundus, president of Great News Network. A federal district court judge ruled that the tracts, which were marked as &quot;not legal tender&quot;, did not violate federal law and ordered their return.

In October 2010, &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; reported that elderly people received &quot;appointment cards&quot; by Comfort&#x27;s California-based publishing company, Living Waters, asking them to fill out information regarding the date and time of their deaths, and advising them to contact evangelists in order to avoid hell. Recipients of these cards expressed anger and horror over receiving them, and contacted police over the matter, with one of them commenting, &quot;It&#x27;s disgusting. It was quite spooky. I just couldn&#x27;t comprehend why anyone would ask you to predict the date of your death.&quot; &quot;The New Zealand Herald&quot; summarized a statement from Living Waters spokesperson Lisa Law as saying that &quot;the cards were a way of raising awareness of human mortality in order to spark discussion about Jesus&quot;, and that Law &quot;did not know who sent [the tracts]&quot;.

===Books===
Ray Comfort has authored more than 80 books and tracts. His 2009 book &quot;You Can Lead an Atheist to Evidence, But You Can&#x27;t Make Him Think&quot;, ranked #1 in Amazon.com&#x27;s atheism and apologetics categories when it debuted in February 2009.

====Abridged version of &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;====
In November 2009, Comfort released an edited and abridged version of Charles Darwin&#x27;s &quot;On the Origin of Species&quot;, with a 50-page foreword containing creationist arguments against the theory of evolution. The book was given away for free at selected schools around the United States. Stan Guffey, a biologist at the University of Tennessee, alleged that most of Comfort&#x27;s foreword was plagiarised from Darwin himself.

According to Comfort&#x27;s website, &quot;nothing has been removed from Darwin&#x27;s original work&quot;, but Eugenie C. Scott, executive director of the National Center for Science Education (NCSE), noted that Comfort deleted four chapters by Darwin that described the evidence for evolution, adding that two of the omitted chapters, Chapters 11 and 12, showcased biogeography, some of Darwin&#x27;s strongest evidence for evolution. She wrote that Comfort&#x27;s foreword is &quot;a hopeless mess of long-ago-refuted creationist arguments, teeming with misinformation about the science of evolution, populated by legions of strawmen, and exhibiting what can be charitably described as muddled thinking&quot;.

On his website, Comfort said that the four chapters were chosen at random to be omitted in order to make the book small enough to be affordable as a giveaway, with the absent chapters available for download, and that the missing chapters were included in the second edition, which had a smaller text size that made printing the entire book as a giveaway affordable. The second edition still lacks Darwin&#x27;s preface and glossary of terms. The NCSE arranged a campaign at colleges across the US to distribute an analysis of the Comfort introduction, a one-page flier, and &quot;the NCSE Safety Bookmark&quot; in the shape of a banana, a reference to Comfort&#x27;s presentation of the banana as an argument for intelligent design and the existence of God.

==Film==

In 2011, Comfort wrote and produced a 33-minute documentary film called &quot;180: Changing the Heart of a Nation&quot;. The film was criticized by &quot;The Huffington Post&quot; for its comparison of legalized abortion to the Holocaust.

Comfort&#x27;s 2016 film &quot;The Atheist Delusion&quot; premiered at the Ark Encounter, a Christian theme park operated by the young Earth creationist organization Answers in Genesis on 22 October 2016.

<text>Planetary geology, alternatively known as astrogeology or exogeology, is a planetary science discipline concerned with the geology of celestial bodies such as planets and their moons, asteroids, comets, and meteorites. Although the geo- prefix typically indicates topics of or relating to Earth, planetary geology is named as such for historical and convenience reasons; due to the subject matter, it is closely linked with more traditional Earth-based geology.

Planetary geology includes such topics as determining the properties and processes of the internal structure of the terrestrial planets, surface processes such as volcanism, impact craters, even fluvial and aeolian action where applicable. Despite their outermost layers being dominated by gases, the giant planets are also included in the field of planetary geology, especially when it comes to their interiors. Fields within Planetary geology are largely derived from fields in the traditional geological sciences, such as geophysics, geomorphology, and geochemistry.

==History==

Eugene Merle Shoemaker is credited with bringing geologic principles to planetary mapping and creating the branch of planetary science in the early 1960s, the Astrogeology Research Program, within the United States Geological Survey. He made important contributions to the field and the study of impact craters, selenography (study of the Moon), asteroids, and comets.

Major centers for planetary science research include the Lunar and Planetary Institute, Applied Physics Laboratory, Planetary Science Institute, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Southwest Research Institute, and Johnson Space Center. Additionally, several universities conduct extensive planetary science research, including Montana State University, Brown University, the University of Arizona, California Institute of Technology, University of Colorado, Western Michigan University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Washington University in St. Louis. Planetary geologists usually study either geology, astronomy, planetary science, geophysics, or one of the earth sciences at the graduate level.

== Tools ==
Simulated interplanetary missions performed on Earth have studied procedures and tools for planetary geology. Various tools, including common archaeological tools such as hammers, shovels, brushes, were evaluated for use by planetary geologists. Along with these common tools, new advanced technologies have become available. These include spectroscopic databases, and data (such as mission logs, images and mapping) from previous unmanned interplanetary missions. Scientists use maps, images, telescopes on Earth, and orbiting telescopes (such as the Hubble Space Telescope). The maps and images are stored in the NASA Planetary Data System where tools such as the Planetary Image Atlas help to search for certain items such as geological features including mountains, ravines, and craters.

== Features and terms ==

Planetary geology uses a wide variety of standardized terms for features. All planetary feature names recognized by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) combine one of these terms with a possibly unique identifying name. The conventions which decide the more precise name are dependent on which planetary body the feature is on, but there are standard descriptors common to all astronomical planetary bodies. New terms must be recognized by the IAU Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature, and are commonly added as features are mapped and described by new planetary missions. This means that in some cases, names may change as improved imagery becomes available, or in other cases widely adopted informal names are changed to be in line with the rules. The standard names are chosen to consciously avoid interpreting the underlying cause of the feature, but rather to describe only its appearance.

<text>CFEngine is a configuration management system, written by Mark Burgess. Its primary function is to provide automated configuration and maintenance of large-scale computer systems, including the unified management of servers, desktops, consumer and industrial devices, embedded network devices, mobile smartphones, and tablet computers.

Released under the terms of the GNU General Public License, CFEngine is free software.

== History ==

The CFEngine project began in 1993 as a way for author Mark Burgess (then a post-doctoral fellow of the Royal Society at Oslo University, Norway) to get his work done by automating the management of a small group of workstations in the Department of Theoretical Physics. Burgess managed Unix workstations, scripting and fixing problems for users manually. Scripting took too much time, the flavours of Unix were significantly different, and scripts had to be maintained for multiple platforms, drowning in exception logic. After discussing the problems with a colleague, Burgess wrote the first version of CFEngine (&quot;the configuration engine&quot;) which was published as an internal report and presented at the CERN computing conference. It gained significant attention from a wider community because it hid platform differences using a domain-specific language. 

A year later, Burgess finished his post-doc but decided to stay in Oslo and took a job lecturing at Oslo University College. Here he realized that there was little or no research being done into configuration management, and he set about applying the principles of scientific modelling to understanding computer systems. He developed the notion of convergent operators, which remains a core of CFEngine.

In 1998 Burgess wrote &quot;Computer Immunology&quot;, a paper at the USENIX/LISA98 conference. It laid out a manifesto for creating self-healing systems, reiterated a few years later by IBM in their form of Autonomic Computing. This started a research effort which led to a major re-write, &quot;CFEngine 2&quot;, which added features for machine learning, anomaly detection and secure communications.

Between 1998 and 2004, CFEngine grew in adoption along with the popularity of Linux as a computing platform. During this time, Mark Burgess developed promise theory, a model of distributed cooperation for self-healing automation. In 2008, after more than five years of research, &quot;CFEngine 3&quot; was introduced, which incorporated promise theory as &quot;a way to make CFEngine both simpler and more powerful at the same time&quot;, according to Burgess. The most significant re-write of the project to date, CFEngine 3 also integrated knowledge management and discovery mechanisms—allowing configuration management to scale to automate enterprise-class infrastructure.

In June 2008 the company CFEngine AS was formed as a collaboration between author Mark Burgess, Oslo University College and the Oslo Innovation Centre in order to support users of CFEngine. In April 2009, the company launched the first commercial version of CFEngine - CFEngine Enterprise. The Enterprise version can be downloaded for free for up to 25 agents (clients). February 2011, the company received its first round of funding, from FERD Capital. The company has offices in Oslo, Norway and Mountain View, California, USA.

In 2017, the company changed its name to Northern.tech, to reflect that it is working on multiple software products, not only CFEngine.

== Design ==

One of the main ideas in CFEngine is that changes in computer configuration should be carried out in a &quot;convergent&quot; manner. This means that each change operation made by the agent should have the character of a fixed point. Rather than describing the steps needed to make a change, CFEngine language describes the final state in which one wants to end up. The agent then ensures that the necessary steps are taken to end up in this &quot;policy compliant state&quot;. Thus, CFEngine can be run again and again, whatever the initial state of a system, and it will end up with a predictable result. CFEngine supports the item of statistical compliance with policy, meaning that a system can never guarantee to be exactly in an ideal or desired state, rather one approaches (converges) towards the desired state by best-effort, at a rate that is determined by the ratio of the frequency of environmental change to the rate of CFEngine execution.

CFEngine provides an operating system-independent interface to Unix-like host configuration. It requires some expert knowledge to deal with peculiarities of different operating systems, but has the power to perform maintenance actions across multiple hosts. CFEngine can be used on Windows hosts as well, and is widely used for managing large numbers of Unix hosts that run heterogeneous operating systems, e.g. Solaris, Linux, AIX, Tru64 and HP-UX.

== Users ==

CFEngine is used in both large and small companies, as well as in many universities and governmental institutions. The largest reported datacenter under management of CFEngine is above a million servers, while sites as large as 40,000 machines are publicly reported (LinkedIn), while sites of several thousand hosts running under CFEngine are common.
According to statistics from CFEngine AS, probably several million computers run CFEngine around the world, and users from more than 100 countries have been registered.

== Research ==

Shortly after its inception, CFEngine inspired a field of research into automated configuration management. The CFEngine project claims to attempt to place the problem of configuration management in a scientific framework. Its author Mark Burgess has developed a range of theoretical tools and results to talk about the problem, and has written several text books and monographs explaining them.

<text>The Hasse–Minkowski theorem is a fundamental result in number theory which states that two quadratic forms over a number field are equivalent if and only if they are equivalent &quot;locally at all places&quot;, i.e. equivalent over every topological completion of the field (which may be real, complex, or p-adic). A related result is that a quadratic space over a number field is isotropic if and only if it is isotropic locally everywhere, or equivalently, that a quadratic form over a number field nontrivially represents zero if and only if this holds for all completions of the field. The theorem was proved in the case of the field of rational numbers by Hermann Minkowski and generalized to number fields by Helmut Hasse. The same statement holds even more generally for all global fields.

==Importance==

The importance of the Hasse–Minkowski theorem lies in the novel paradigm it presented for answering arithmetical questions: in order to determine whether an equation of a certain type has a solution in rational numbers, it is sufficient to test whether it has solutions over complete fields of real and &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers, where one can apply analytic techniques such as Newton&#x27;s method and its &quot;p&quot;-adic analogue Hensel&#x27;s lemma. This is the first significant example of a local-global principle, one of the most fundamental techniques in arithmetic geometry.

== Application to the classification of quadratic forms ==

The Hasse–Minkowski theorem reduces the problem of classifying quadratic forms over a number field &quot;K&quot; up to equivalence to the set of analogous but much simpler questions over local fields. Basic invariants of a nonsingular quadratic form are its dimension, which is a positive integer, and its discriminant modulo the squares in K, which is an element of the multiplicative group K*/K*2. In addition, for every place &quot;v&quot; of &quot;K&quot;, there is an invariant coming from the completion K&quot;v&quot;. Depending on the choice of &quot;v&quot;, this completion may be the real numbers R, the complex numbers C, or a p-adic number field, each of which has different kinds of invariants:
* &quot;Case of&quot; R. By Sylvester&#x27;s law of inertia, the signature (or, alternatively, the negative index of inertia) is a complete invariant.
* &quot;Case of&quot; C. All nonsingular quadratic forms of the same dimension are equivalent.
* &quot;Case of&quot; Q&quot;p&quot; &quot;and its algebraic extensions&quot;. Forms of the same dimension are classified up to equivalence by their Hasse invariant.

These invariants must satisfy some compatibility conditions: a parity relation (the sign of the discriminant must match the negative index of inertia) and a product formula (a local–global relation). Conversely, for every set of invariants satisfying these relations, there is a quadratic form over K with these invariants.

<text>A billet is a living-quarters to which a soldier is assigned to sleep. Historically, a billet was a private dwelling that was required to accept the soldier.

Soldiers are generally billeted in barracks or garrisons when not on combat duty, although in some armies soldiers with families are permitted to maintain a home off-post. Used for a building, the term &quot;billet&quot; is more commonly used in British English; United States standard terms are &quot;quarters&quot;, &quot;barracks&quot;, &quot;Single (Soldier) Housing&quot; or &quot;Family Housing&quot;.

==British history==
Originally, a billet (from French ) was a note, commonly used in the 18th and early 19th centuries as a &quot;billet of invitation&quot;. In this sense, the term was used to denote an order issued to a soldier entitling him to quarters with a certain person. From this meaning, the word billet came to be loosely used of the quarters thus obtained. The division of troops to organize their billeting was known as cantoning. Repeated petitions against the practice of billeting, starting in the 16th century, culminated in its outlawing in 1689 as an extension of a section of the Petition of Right 1628.

During wartime, civilians who have been evacuated from a city in danger of attack are billetted in communal shelters or in the homes of individuals. The practice of billeting evacuees was widespread in Britain during World War II, particularly during the Blitz when children and other non-essential persons in major cities were sent to rural areas for safety.

In European countries since the formation of regular forces, the Quartermaster was an occupation and a rank of the individuals responsible for the provision of sleeping quarters and other provisions for regular time troops.
Train ticket are called &#x27;Billet&#x27; in many French influenced parts of the world including Eastern Europe. Overnight transport by train was very common for soldiers and on the Billet, the number indicating the location of the quarters would be specified. Later, during times of over-surging troops, more troops would be assigned to a train than its regular housing capacity. Thus, only those with a Billet would be assigned to a room or quarter. Hence, the two became synonymous. 

==United States usage==
One of the major grievances of the American colonists against the British government which led to the American Revolutionary War was the quartering of soldiers in civilian homes. As a result, the Third Amendment to the United States Constitution provides restrictions on the manner in which the Federal government of the United States may require civilians to provide housing for American soldiers.

&quot;Billet&quot; can mean a specific personnel position, assignment, or duty station which may be filled by one person, most commonly used by the United States Navy, the United States Marine Corps, and the United States Coast Guard. Every person reporting aboard a ship or shore installation in the naval services is assigned a billet according to the unit &quot;watch, quarter and station bill&quot;, which shows the duties, stations and billet assignments for all crew members.

&quot;Billet&quot; can also refer to the position and weapons of the members of a unit. For example, the billets of a fireteam include a fireteam leader (M16), a rifleman (M16), an automatic rifleman (M249), and a grenadier (M16 with M203 grenade launcher).

==Amateur sports==
In North America, billet families offer room and board to junior ice hockey players (or under-20 athletes from other sports, such as soccer) who leave home to join elite teams in other towns. Coaches are often involved with matching a player to a billet family. The objective of a billet family is to provide a &quot;home away from home&quot; for young players during the season. However, fears over child safety in amateur sports in Canada drastically curtailed billeting practice. Many places do not billet, while other clubs through their provincial sports&#x27; bodies have instituted mandatory criminal record checks for all involved in amateur sports, including coaches, volunteers and anyone over eighteen years of age from the host family.

==Other usage==
*In Spain, the noble officers of royal tercios were billeted in the homes of the affluent and well-to-do citizens of the towns and cities they were stationed in. This usage is employed as a plot device in the &quot;Barber of Seville&quot;.
*In Canada, the term is widely used in conjunction with housing visiting performers from theatrical or musical tours, such as for a Fringe Theatre festival or a choir festival. Students traveling for a band or choir tour may billet with members of the host band or choir.
*The expression &quot;billet&quot; is also used for an exchange student.

<text>The George Michael Sports Machine was a syndicated, sports-related American television program which was launched in 1984. The show aired weekends, usually on Sunday nights, and originated from WRC-TV in Washington, D.C., one of NBC&#x27;s owned and operated stations. Most of the stations that aired &quot;The Sports Machine&quot; were NBC affiliates.

The show was an offshoot of a local program that George Michael, a former disc jockey who became a sportscaster, hosted in Washington beginning in 1980. Michael hosted the program for its entire run, which ended in 2007. Lindsay Czarniak, who was a colleague of Michael&#x27;s at WRC-TV, joined the program as a substitute host in 2004 and became Michael&#x27;s co-host in 2006.

==History==
===1984–2004===
Shortly after Michael joined WRC-TV in 1980, the station launched the program as &quot;George Michael&#x27;s Sports Final&quot;, a local sports wrapup show on Sunday evenings, following the late newscast. After a successful four-year run in Washington, NBC&#x27;s other owned-and-operated stations—at the time in New York City, Los Angeles, Cleveland, and Chicago—added the program to their Sunday late-night schedules, and it was retitled as &quot;The George Michael Sports Machine&quot;. NBC concurrently began to offer the program to its affiliated stations as part of the network schedule on September 2, 1984; WRC-TV, which continued to produce &quot;Sports Machine&quot;, said that this was the first time that a network had carried a locally-produced sports show (albeit one with a national focus). In 1991, ITC Entertainment took &quot;Sports Machine&quot; into wider national syndication; at the time, the program was carried on 84 of NBC&#x27;s affiliates. The show moved to Group W Productions in 1995; its successors, Eyemark Entertainment and King World Productions (both now CBS Media Ventures), continued to distribute &quot;Sports Machine&quot; until 2001, when NBC Enterprises (later NBCUniversal Television Distribution from 2004 until the show&#x27;s final episode in 2007) began distributing the program.

As host, George Michael presented clips from the weekend&#x27;s sporting events from across the United States and sometimes outside of the U.S. Unlike newer sports-related programming, &quot;Sports Machine&quot; did not usually present commentary or criticism and focused almost purely on the highlights, and, often toward the end of the show, an in-depth story about a particular athlete. The show was also somewhat unusual in its occasional coverage of remarkable high school sports footage, and its occasional coverage of sports largely ignored by most other sports wrap-up shows, such as ice hockey, NASCAR and other auto racing events, professional wrestling, rodeo, and equestrian events.

===Influence and criticism===
When the show premiered nationally in the mid-1980s, the only highlights available to sports fans on Sunday nights were those on late local newscasts and the ESPN and CNN cable networks, creating an audience niche for &quot;Sports Machine&quot; to fill. By the later years of &quot;Sports Machine,&quot; however, the rise of numerous specialty cable sports channels (notably ESPNews) and the expansion of Sunday evening local newscasts to either air an extended sportscast (an &quot;extra&quot; in common parlance) or a separate program to recap Sunday football and baseball action caused many stations to either drop the program or air it later in the night—issues made even worse in 2006, when NBC acquired the rights to &quot;Sunday Night Football&quot;, which in turn pushed late local news on most of the &quot;Sports Machine&#x27;s&quot; affiliates even later.

An idiosyncrasy of the show was the large quantity of machinery on its set. After introducing each of the highlights, Michael would press a button which &quot;activated&quot; the &quot;sports machine&quot;—a large computer with several monitors attached to a videotape reel-to-reel—to play the clips. Michael and the producers chose the computer motif mainly because high technology was fast coming into the American consciousness at the time of the show&#x27;s debut.

The show magnified highlights in order to take out the distraction of the digital on-screen graphics added by the networks during the 1990s.

===Cancellation===
Beginning in 2004, fellow WRC-TV sports anchor Lindsay Czarniak joined &quot;Sports Machine&quot; as a contributing correspondent and substitute host, and she became the official co-host of the program in September 2006. However, this arrangement did not last long, as Michael announced on November 16, 2006, that he would retire and &quot;Sports Machine&quot; would end its 27-year run in March 2007. Michael reasoned that he would not want his contract renewed at the expense of WRC-TV&#x27;s sports staff, which was slated to be reduced under NBC Universal&#x27;s network-wide, cost-reduction initiative.

The last episode aired on March 25, 2007. After thanking his co-host, sponsors, syndicators and staff, Michael said this at the end of the show:I close every show every Sunday by saying, &quot;Thank you for letting us be a part of your weekend.&quot; Well, tonight, for the final time, we say, &quot;thank you.&quot; Thank you for letting us be a part of your life. From everyone at the &quot;Sports Machine,&quot; have a great weekend, everybody. We hope to see you somewhere down the road of life. Thank you.

Michael then walked off camera, and was heard to say &quot;Last one out, turn out the lights!&quot; as the show closed for the final time.

The end of &quot;Sports Machine&quot; coincided with the end of Michael&#x27;s contract as lead sports anchor at WRC, and he was replaced by Czarniak in that role. Michael continued to appear on sports panel shows and Washington Redskins-related programs for WRC-TV and Washington-area sports talk radio stations until more production and budget cuts forced those shows to be terminated. Michael died from leukemia on December 24, 2009.

Shortly after the end of the &quot;Sports Machine&quot;, Czarniak became a permanent part of TNT&#x27;s NASCAR broadcasts as a pit reporter in addition to her duties at WRC. She left that position after the 2011 season. In 2011, Czarniak left WRC to take a position at ESPN and initially was an overnight anchor at ESPNews before becoming a fixture on &quot;SportsCenter&quot;, where she anchored the 6 PM broadcast with John Anderson from December 3, 2012 to January 30, 2015 and later, was the sole anchor from February 2, 2015 to mid-October 2016. In August 2017, her contract with ESPN expired.

<text>Father Angelo Fantoni (May 2, 1903 – August 28, 1992) was an Italian priest and exorcist who worked at Monte San Savino near Arezzo, Italy.

He was born in Italy to Pietro Annunziata (Cipriani) Fantoni. He entered college at the age of seventeen in 1920 and was ordained a priest on March 18, 1930.

Father Fantoni became a noted faith healer but this ended up causing problems in Arezzo when the medical doctors collectively denounced him as a fraud because he healed without using medicine. Father Fantoni was to be imprisoned for a year and pay a 300,000 lire fine. However, when the verdict was appealed he was acquitted. The story is told in the 1999 book &quot;Thanks, don Angelo!&quot; by Franco Predieri.

His life and experiences as an exorcist are recorded in the book &quot;Don Angelo Fantoni: Testimonianze&quot; by Rita Buonomo.

He is mentioned in Father Gabriele Amorth&#x27;s book &quot;An Exorcist: More Stories&quot;.

<doc id="1109141" wikidata="Q10131" url="?curid=1109141" title="Francisco Varallo">
<text>Francisco Antonio &quot;Pancho&quot; Varallo (; – ) was an Argentine football forward. He played for the Argentina national team from 1930 to 1937, also representing the country at the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930.

During his career, Varallo won four Primera División titles (one with Gimnasia y Esgrima LP and three with Boca Juniors) and with 194 goals in 222 official matches, is Boca Juniors&#x27; 3rd. highest all-time leading goalscorer. Besides, Varallo is placed 11th. among the all-time Argentine Primera División top scorers with 216 goals.

Varallo died in his home-town of La Plata on , aged 100. He was the last surviving player from the 1930 World Cup.

==Club career==
===Early years===
Varallo was born in Los Hornos, a district of La Plata Partido in Buenos Aires Province, on 5 February 1910. He made his debut aged 14, and early in his career gained the nickname &quot;cañoncito&quot; (in English: &quot;little cannon&quot;) for his shooting ability.

Aged 18, Varallo had a trial with Estudiantes de La Plata, scoring eleven goals in three games for the club. However, the board of the club where Varallo was a youth team player were supporters of Estudiantes&#x27; town rivals Gimnasia y Esgrima, and therefore denied him the opportunity to join Estudiantes. Varallo ultimately joined Gimnasia, making his debut for the club&#x27;s reserve side, before making his debut for the first team in 1929. During his first season with Gimnasia, Varallo won the Primera División championship with the club after beating Boca Juniors by 2–1 in the final.

In 1930, the forward was loaned for free by Gimnasia to Vélez Sársfield to play for the team during their Pan-American tour. He totaled 17 goals during the tour.

===Boca Juniors===

Varallo moved to Boca Juniors for the start of the 1931 season (the first professional season in Argentina) for a fee of approximately $8000.

He continued to play for the club for the next nine years during which time he won the Primera División title three times, in 1931, 1934 and 1935, as well as coming runner up in 1933, when he was the top goalscorer in the league and of South America scoring 34 goals.

In his nine years at Boca Juniors he became the club&#x27;s 2nd. top goal-scorer (after Roberto Cherro, although both would be surpassed by Martín Palermo in 2010), with 194 goals in 222 games (scoring average 0.87 per game), a record that stood until 2008 when it was broken by Martín Palermo.

During the 1930s Varallo formed strong partnerships with teammates Roberto Cherro and Delfín Benítez Cáceres, who both also scored over 100 goals for the club. In 1938, he was only able to play one game because of a bad knee injury and, although he played more frequently the next year, was forced to retire in 1940, aged 30.

==International career==

Varallo represented Argentina at the inaugural World Cup in 1930, held in Uruguay, where he was the youngest player. He played in all three of the team&#x27;s group games; scoring one goal in the match against Mexico, but missed the semi-final against the United States due to injury. However, he was fit to play in the World Cup final against Uruguay and started at inside right forward. Argentina were leading 2–1 at half time, but eventually lost to the hosts 4–2.

Varallo was also a member of the Argentine team that won the South American Championship in 1937. He scored three goals during the tournament, including a brace in the 2–1 win over Chile.

===International goals===

==After retirement==
Varallo retired from football in 1940, due to injury problems. Then he was coach of Gimnasia y Esgrima between 1957 and 1959.
Varallo&#x27;s career was recognised in 1994, when he was awarded with the FIFA Order of Merit for his contributions to football. He has also received honours from the Argentine Football Association and the South American Football Confederation.

In his late 90s Varallo had joked that he would have to come out of retirement should Martín Palermo overtake his record of 181 professional goals for Boca.

He marked his 100th birthday in February 2010 in his hometown near Buenos Aires by recalling the 1930 clash between his country and neighbouring Uruguay. In an interview he gave to FIFA to mark his birthday, he stated that losing in the final to Uruguay was his &#x27;greatest disappointment&#x27;.

==Death==

Varallo died on 30 August 2010, in his hometown of La Plata aged 100. Leading tributes to the former player, FIFA president Sepp Blatter stated that &quot;The news that Francisco Varallo is no longer with us fills us with great sense of loss, both for his qualities as a person and an ambassador for our beloved sport ... In these grief-filled moments I can take immense pride from the fact that a character such as Francisco Varallo, whom we shall never forget, represented the football family with such dignity&quot;. The president of the South American Football Confederation Nicolás Léoz also released a statement expressing sadness at Varallo&#x27;s death.

Following his death, both of his former clubs, Gimnasia and Boca announced a day of mourning, while the South American Football Confederation announced that a minute&#x27;s silence was to be held during all Copa Sudamericana fixtures the following week.

<text>Finnish Centre Youth is the biggest political youth organisation in Finland with 17 000 members. It is the youth wing of the Centre Party. It is formed by 19 regional organisations and approximately 400 local associations.

The organisation was formerly known as Nuoren Keskustan Liitto and until 1964 Maaseudun Nuorten Liitto.

Finnish Centre Youth is a member of the European Liberal Youth (LYMEC), International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY) and a founding member of the Nordic Centre Youth (NCF).

==History==
The organisation was founded after World War II on 30 June 1945 in Salo as a union of 14 regional youth organisations of the Agrarian League. The Salo meeting elected Johannes Virolainen as the first president of the organisation. Two decades later, Virolainen became the Prime Minister of Finland.

The post-war era was a politically active time in Finland. The new centrist youth organisation rapidly gained new members, reaching 50 000 members in 1954 and 70 000 members in 1962. Since then, the number of members has been gradually declining (the end of 70s being an exception).

<text>Trump Entertainment Resorts, Inc. was a gambling and hospitality company. The company previously owned and operated the now-demolished Trump Plaza and Trump World&#x27;s Fair (both in Atlantic City), the now-closed Trump Marina, Trump Casino &amp; Hotel in Gary, Indiana, Trump 29 in Coachella, California, and Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. It was founded in 1995 as Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts by Donald Trump, who after 2004 held only a minority ownership. The company filed for bankruptcy in 2004, 2009 and 2014. It became a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises in 2016. Since then, all of the company&#x27;s properties have been closed and sold.

== History ==

=== The beginning ===
Donald Trump began purchasing properties along the Atlantic City boardwalk in the early 1980s and received a casino license from the New Jersey Casino Control Commission (CCC) on March 15, 1982. He had planned to build his own casino on the boardwalk, but was stalled on the project when Mike Rose, then CEO of Holiday Inn and Harrah&#x27;s approached him to manage construction of a Holiday Inn Casino-Hotel. It opened in May 1984 and two years later Trump bought out Holiday Inn&#x27;s shares in the property and renamed it the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino.

In 1985, Trump purchased the nearly-complete Atlantic City Hilton hotel and casino property at the Atlantic marina from Hilton Hotels for $325 million. The hotel chain sold the property after its application for a gaming license was turned down by the CCC. Trump originally opened the property as Trump&#x27;s Castle Hotel Casino, and later renamed it the Trump Marina.

In 1988, Trump purchased the unfinished Taj Mahal property from Resorts International for $230 million after negotiations with Merv Griffin in which the two men divided the assets of the failing company. The casino, at the time the largest in Atlantic City, would eventually cost almost $1 billion by the time it opened in 1990. Trump completed the project using junk bonds, a decision that hurt the company afterward as the gaming industry struggled in a recession and interest rates became unmanageable.

The company was shaken by the deaths of three key executives in an October 10, 1989 helicopter crash in northern New Jersey while they were returning from a New York press conference promoting an upcoming Atlantic City boxing event. The men were Steven F. Hyde, the CEO of Trump&#x27;s casino operations, Mark Grossinger Etess, the president and chief operating officer of the Taj Mahal, and Trump Plaza executive vice president Jonathan Benanav.

In 1995, Trump established Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts (THCR) as a publicly traded company, granting it ownership of the Trump Plaza and the under-development Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana. The company traded under the symbol DJT. The following year, THCR bought the Trump Taj Mahal at a valuation of $890 million, and bought the Trump Castle from Trump for $486 million (including $355 million in assumed debt).

In 1996, the company opened Trump World&#x27;s Fair, a casino adjunct to the Trump Plaza. The World&#x27;s Fair was closed in 1999, with plans to replace it with a larger resort.

In 1997, THCR was one of eleven applicants for three casino licenses available in Detroit, with a $542-million proposal for the Trump Motor City Hotel Casino, in partnership with Mel Farr. The bid was ultimately dropped from consideration because of Mayor Dennis Archer&#x27;s doubts about the company&#x27;s financial condition.

In 1998, THCR business consultants spent at least $68,000 on a trip to Cuba in violation to the United States embargo against Cuba. According to a report by &quot;Newsweek&quot;, the consulting firm Seven Arrows Investment and Development instructed THCR on how to evade the embargo by linking the money to a charitable effort.

In 1999, THCR agreed to purchase the Flamingo Hilton Casino Kansas City for $15 million, but the deal fell through when Missouri gaming regulators did not approve the company&#x27;s gaming license by a contractual deadline.

THCR entered a management agreement in 2000 to operate the Spotlight 29 Casino, an Indian casino in Coachella, California.

===Financial troubles===
Trump Entertainment Resorts and its predecessors have filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection four times, in 1991, following construction of the $1-billion Trump Taj Mahal, and in 2004, 2009 and 2014.

In 2004, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts explored various options for restructuring its debt, amid speculation that it might file for bankruptcy. A possible arrangement with Credit Suisse First Boston was not completed because the bondholders rejected it.

On October 21, 2004, the company announced a preliminary agreement with its investors. Trump, who had been the majority owner, would reduce his stock ownership from 56 to 27 percent. Bondholders would surrender some of their debt in exchange for stock. On October 27, the company announced that Morgan Stanley would be the joint lead arranger for a $500 million financing as part of the restructuring plan. On November 21, the company filed for bankruptcy. Trump said the filing was &quot;really just a technical thing&quot; as the best way to implement the restructuring plan. The plan was submitted to the bankruptcy court on December 16, 2004.

After the 2004 bankruptcy, Trump Hotels &amp; Casino Resorts changed its name to Trump Entertainment Resorts (TER), and Trump ceased to play an active role in the company.

In 2005, the company&#x27;s involvement in the Spotlight 29 Casino ended, as the tribe bought out the casino management agreement for $6 million. Later that year, TER sold its Indiana casino to The Majestic Star Casino, LLC for $253 million. The company had also been awarded a license to build a second casino in Orange County, Indiana, but dropped this plan, due in part to the state&#x27;s concerns about the company&#x27;s viability.

In 2007, the company attempted to negotiate a buyout with several public and private firms, but on July 2, it announced that it could not reach a deal, and would take itself off the market. The company planned to lay off employees in order to cut costs.

===2009 bankruptcy and restructuring===
The casino group filed for bankruptcy again in February 2009, owing $1.2 billion. Two sets of debt holders eventually proposed reorganization plans for the group in U.S. bankruptcy court.

Trump initially made an agreement with banker and poker player Andrew Beal, owner of Beal Bank, which held $500 million in the group&#x27;s debt, to take over the resorts. However, citing concerns about the bank&#x27;s lack of gaming experience, he dropped them in favor of hedge fund Avenue Capital Management, a plan favored by other bondholders. Beal then partnered with investor, Carl Icahn, who had worked on restructuring another Atlantic City casino, the Tropicana. In court, Trump argued that he would fight the Icahn/Beal team if they sought to use his name and likeness on the group&#x27;s properties. Instead he signed an agreement with Avenue Capital in which he would receive 5% stock in the reorganized company and another 5% in exchange for the use of his name and likeness in perpetuity.

The bankruptcy court eventually sided with the Trump/Avenue partnership, favored by bond holders who believed that Trump&#x27;s brand would result in a stronger company after reorganization.

In 2011, TER sold the Trump Marina to Landry&#x27;s Restaurants, which also operates the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas.

===Post-2009 bankruptcy===
In February 2013, the company agreed to sell the Trump Plaza for $20 million to the Meruelo Group, a California-based company whose holdings include the Grand Sierra Resort in Reno, Nevada. The proceeds would be used to pay down the company&#x27;s debt to a level of $270 million. CEO Robert Griffin said TER would consider also selling the Trump Taj Mahal for the right price. However, Carl Icahn, who held the mortgage on the Trump casinos, would reject the sale of the Trump Plaza.

In early August 2014, Donald Trump filed a lawsuit demanding removal of his name from the company&#x27;s two casinos, because they had allegedly been allowed to fall into disrepair, in breach of the licensing agreement for Trump&#x27;s name.

===2014 bankruptcy===
In September 2014, Trump Entertainment Resorts filed again for bankruptcy, and closed the Trump Plaza. On a motion made by union UNITE HERE Local 54, relating to the bankruptcy action, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in Trump Entertainment&#x27;s favor on January 15, 2016, and held that Trump Entertainment could reject the continuing terms and conditions of a collective bargaining agreement with the union, an agreement that had already expired by its terms. This case was significant as it was a matter of First impression among the courts of appeal and could significantly alter the balance of power between debtor-employers and their unions.

The company eventually exited bankruptcy in February 2016 and became a subsidiary of Icahn Enterprises.

==Folding of the company==
On October 10, 2016, the Trump Taj Mahal, the company&#x27;s last operating property, closed for the final time. Trump Entertainment continued to operate to deal with the transfer of some points on the Trump One card account. All of the websites related to the company were redirected to DonaldJTrump.com.

Trump Plaza remained vacant after the company had gone defunct and its assets were acquired by Icahn Enterprises. In November 2017, it was revealed that Icahn was looking to demolish the casino, and was seeking $5.6 million in tax funds to pay for the demolition, but this caused a rift between Icahn and the local government, delaying the project. On December 14, 2018, the deadline for demolishing it officially passed, meaning Trump Plaza would remain standing through the winter. Later that month, Icahn terminated the deed restriction on the property and bought out a complicated lease, making a sale more attractive.

The building was declared a hazard by the city in March 2020; demolition began that summer, and the main hotel tower was imploded on February 17, 2021. A charity auction benefited the Boys and Girls Club, with most of the money coming from Icahn after he objected to the original plan to auction off the right to press the demolition button.

==Former properties==
The company&#x27;s properties included:
*Harrah&#x27;s at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, New Jersey; formerly a 50/50 partnership with Harrah&#x27;s, later wholly owned by the company and renamed the Trump Plaza. Closed on September 16, 2014; demolished February 17, 2021. 
*Trump 29 Casino in Coachella, California; formerly a 50/50 partnership with the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians of California. In 2006 Trump officially exited the partnership.
*Trump Casino in Gary, Indiana, sold in 2005
* Trump World&#x27;s Fair at Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Operated as a wing of Trump Plaza, but with its own casino license, it was closed in 1999, and demolished in 2000.
* Trump Castle (renamed Trump Marina in 1997) in Atlantic City, New Jersey; sold to Landry&#x27;s, Inc. in 2011 and renamed the Golden Nugget Atlantic City.
* Steel Pier, sold in 2011
* Trump Club Privee Casino - Canouan - Saint Vincent
* Trump Taj Mahal, a casino resort on the Atlantic City boardwalk; closed on October 10, 2016. Purchased by Hard Rock International and reopened as the Hard Rock Hotel &amp; Casino Atlantic City in June 2018.

Like many areas within Boston, the Financial District has no official definition. It is roughly bounded by Atlantic Avenue, State Street, and Devonshire Street. Parts of the Financial District are in various USPS postal ZIP Codes, including 02108, 02109, 02110, and 02111.

==Landmarks==
The area includes Post Office Square, the Exchange Place and International Place complexes, and the landmark Custom House Tower (now an 87-room Marriott Vacation Club), and borders Quincy Market, Faneuil Hall, and the Old State House.

===Key companies===
The Financial District also contains the headquarters of the mutual fund companies Fidelity Investments, Putnam Investments, and DWS Scudder Investments; the world headquarters for State Street Bank and Eastern Bank; accounting firms Wolf &amp; Company, P.C., RSM McGladrey, and BDO USA, LLP; loan advisor The Debt Exchange; the law firms of Bingham McCutchen, Goodwin Procter, WilmerHale, Kirkpatrick &amp; Lockhart Nicholson Graham, and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky, and Popeo, PC; the local headquarters of Bank of America (formerly Fleet Bank) and Santander Bank; the Langham Hotel Boston and Hilton Hotel; and the local offices of Merrill Lynch and other brokerages.

===Notable buildings===
Dewey Square, One Financial Center, and the plaza and towers housing the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston are located near South Station, adjacent to and just south of the area defined above. Also part of the Financial District are 33 Arch Street, One Federal Street, the First National Bank Building, 100 Summer Street, Exchange Place, and 101 Federal Street. The area contains many of Boston&#x27;s highrise buildings in a fairly densely packed area, significantly more than the Back Bay which contains Boston&#x27;s two tallest highrises, the Prudential Tower and 200 Clarendon Street.

===Recent development===
There has been some recent development and construction in the area. Russia Wharf was completed in 2011 along the Fort Channel and rises up to 395 feet and 32 stories. Construction of South Station Tower was scheduled to begin in 2009 but was put on hold until the spring of 2020, moving forward despite the presence of COVID-19. Upon its 2024 completion, the tower will rise to 677 feet and 51 stories. One Franklin Street has recently reworked by developers and construction commenced. Millennium Tower was completed in 2016 and stands 684 feet, the fifth tallest in the city. Other towers in the area such as the Aquarium Garage Development and the Congress Street Towers if approved could significantly change the Boston Skyline as well.

<text>Christian Democratic Youth of Finland ( / ) is a political youth organization in Finland. It is the youth league of Christian Democrats. It currently has more than 1,500 registered members. It has been chaired by Aki Ruotsala since November 2010 until December 2012. From January 2013 Lauri Kangasniemi leads the organization.

Kristillisdemokraattiset Nuoret is a member of the Youth of the European People&#x27;s Party, youth organization of European Parliaments largest political group.

==Political viewpoints==
Traditionally Christian Democratic Youth of Finland has supported a more moderate conservative ideology than its political concern, the Christian Democrat Party of Finland. Furthermore the Youth division of the party represents the most liberal wing of its party. Its political ideology is founded on three principles:
*Liberty as basic pillar of human action and as a requirement sine qua non for human action.
*Subsidiarity as social organization rule. Subsidiarity principle states that superior social institutions - such as the State or the European Union - should not take care of activities that lower social layers - such as individuals, families, clubs, companies, etc. - can manage efficiently.
*Charity, meaning that, although individuals are the basic cell of the society, they all life in society and so, they have rights and responsibilities in their communities. Although most of this rights and responsibilities should be exercised personally, the State should avoid making their fulfillment harder or fulfilling those duties on behalf of individuals that could exercise them personally.

<doc id="1109199" wikidata="Q314454" url="?curid=1109199" title="Egill Skallagrímsson">
<text>Egil Skallagrímsson ( ; Modern Icelandic: ; 904 995) was a Viking Age war poet, sorcerer, berserker, and farmer. He is known mainly as the anti-hero of &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot;. &quot;Egil&#x27;s Saga&quot; historically narrates a period from approximately 850 to 1000 AD and is believed to have been written between 1220 and 1240 AD.

==Life==

Egil was born in Iceland, to Skalla-Grímr Kveldúlfsson and Bera Yngvarsdóttir; he was the grandson of Kveld-Úlfr (whose name means &#x27;evening wolf&#x27;). Another of his ancestors, Hallbjörn, was Norwegian-Sami.

Skalla-Grímr was a respected chieftain, and mortal enemy of King Harald Fairhair of Norway. He migrated to Iceland, settling at Borg where his father Kveld-Úlfr&#x27;s coffin landed after being ritualistically set adrift as Skalla-Grímr&#x27;s boat approached Iceland. Skalla-Grímr and wife Bera had two daughters, Sæunn and Þórunn, and two sons, Þorolfr and Egil.

Egil composed his first poem at three years old. He exhibited berserk behaviour, and this, together with the description of his large and unattractive head, has led to the theory that he might have suffered from Paget&#x27;s disease, which causes a thickening of the bones and may lead eventually to blindness.

At the age of seven, Egil was cheated in a game with local boys. Enraged, he went home, procured an axe, and, returning to the boys, split the skull to the teeth of the boy who had cheated him. After Berg-Önundr refused to allow Egil to claim his wife Ásgerðr&#x27;s share of her father&#x27;s inheritance, he challenged Önundr to a man-to-man fight on an island (a &quot;hólmganga&quot;). Berg-Önundr refused the challenge but was later killed along with his brother Hadd by Egil. Egil later killed the last of the brothers, Atli the Short, by biting through Atli&#x27;s neck during a holmgangr.

Later, after being grievously insulted, Egil killed Bárðr of Atley, a retainer of King Eiríkr Bloodaxe and kinsman of Queen Gunnhildr, both of whom spent the remainder of their lives trying to take vengeance. Gunnhildr ordered her two brothers, Eyvindr Braggart and Álfr Aksmann, to assassinate Egil and his brother Þórólfr, who had been on good terms with her previously. However, Egil killed the Queen&#x27;s brothers when they attempted to confront him.

In spring Þórólfr and Egil prepared a large warship and raid along the Eastern route (&quot;Austrvegr&quot;), where they won much wealth and had many battles. In Courland they made a peace for half a month and traded with the men of the land (ch. 46).

That same summer, Haraldr Fairhair died. In order to secure his place as sole King of Norway, Eiríkr Bloodaxe murdered his two brothers. He then declared Egil an outlaw in Norway. Berg-Önundr gathered a company of men to capture Egil, but was killed in the attempt. Before escaping from Norway, Egil also killed Rögnvaldr, the son of King Eiríkr and Queen Gunnhildr. He then cursed the King and Queen, setting a horse&#x27;s head on a &quot;Nithing pole&quot; and saying
:&quot;Here I set up a &quot;níð&quot;-pole, and declare this &quot;níð&quot; against King Eiríkr and Queen Gunnhildr,&quot;—he turned the horse-head to face the mainland—&quot;I declare this &quot;níð&quot; at the land-spirits there, and the land itself, so that all will fare astray, not to hold nor find their places, not until they wreak King Eiríkr and Gunnhildr from the land.&quot; He set up the pole of níð in the cliff-face and left it standing; he faced the horse&#x27;s eyes on the land, and he carved runes upon the pole, and said all the formal words of the curse. (ch. 57).

Gunnhildr also put a spell on Egil, cursing him to feel restless and depressed until they met again.

Soon afterwards, Eiríkr and Gunnhildr were forced to flee to the Kingdom of Northumbria by Prince Hákon. In Saxon England, they became King and Queen of Northumbria in rivalry with King Athelstan of England. In time, Egil was shipwrecked in Northumbria and learned who ruled the land. Egil sought out the house of his good friend Arinbjörn, where they armed themselves and marched to Eiríkr&#x27;s court. Arinbjörn told Egil &quot;now you must go and offer the king your head and embrace his foot. I will present your case to him.&quot; Arinbjörn presented Egil&#x27;s case and Egil composes a short &quot;drápa&quot;, reciting it with Eiríkr&#x27;s foot in his hand, but Eiríkr was not impressed. He explained that Egil&#x27;s wrongs to him were far too great to be forgiven so easily. Gunnhildr called for the immediate execution of Egil, but Arinbjörn convinced the king not to kill him until the morning.

Arinbjörn told Egil that he should stay up all night and compose a mighty head-ransom poem or &quot;drápa&quot; fit for such a king, a poem in praise of his enemy. In the morning Egil went back before king Eiríkr and recited the great &quot;drápa&quot;. This twenty-stanza long head-ransom poem appears in Chapter 63 of &quot;Egils saga&quot;. Eiríkr was so surprised by the quality of the poem that he decided to give Egil his life, even though Egil has killed Eiríkr&#x27;s own son. The complex nature of these poems, with complex poetic metres and metaphors (including kennings), as well as the fact that they were often about kings reliably attested in the historical record, provides some basis for supposing that they might have been composed by a historically real Egil Skallagrímsson, descending more or less unchanged through oral tradition from the time of their composition to the writing of &quot;Egils saga&quot;. &quot;Egils saga&quot; and some other Icelandic sagas appear to hang on a skeletal framework of such complex poetry, a spine of historical truth.

Egil also fought at the Battle of Brunanburh in the service of King Æthelstan; his brother Þórólfr died there, for which Egil received two chests of silver from Æthelstan in compensation.

Ultimately, Egil returned to his family farm in Iceland, where he remained a force to be reckoned with in local politics. He lived into his eighties, grew blind, and died shortly before the Christianisation of Iceland. Before Egil died he buried his silver near Mosfellsbær. In his last act of violence he killed the servants who helped him bury his treasure.

When a Christian chapel was constructed at the family homestead, Egil&#x27;s body was exhumed by his son and re-buried near the altar. According to the saga, the exhumed skull bone was hit with an axe, and it turned white, showing the strength of the warrior, but also, according to one modern interpretation, suggesting the traits of Paget&#x27;s disease. It has been theorized that Egill suffered from bipolar disorder. 

==Physical appearance==
In chapter 55 of Egil&#x27;s Saga, his appearance is described as follows
==Issue==
According to &quot;Egils saga&quot;, Egil has five children with Ásgerðr Björnsdóttir: Þorgerðr Egilsdóttir, Bera Egilsdóttir, Böðvar Egilsson, Gunnar Egilsson and Þorsteinn Egilsson. In later years, Iceland&#x27;s Mýrar clan claimed descent from him.

==Poems==
Apart from being a warrior of immense might in literary sources, Egil is also celebrated for his poetry, considered by many historians to be the finest of the ancient Scandinavian poets and &quot;Sonatorrek&quot;, the dirge over his own sons, has been called &quot;the birth of Nordic personal lyric poetry&quot;. His poems were also the first Old Norse verses to use end rhyme. The following works are attributed to Egil:

#&quot;Aðalsteinsdrápa&quot;. &quot;Drápa&quot; for the Anglo-Saxon King Æthelstan.
#&quot;Höfuðlausn&quot; (&quot;The Head Ransom&quot;, sometimes referred to as &quot;Head-Ransom&quot;), with which Egil bought his life from Eiríkr Bloodaxe, who had sentenced him to death in England.
#&quot;Sonatorrek&quot; (&quot;The Loss of a Son&quot;). After the death of his son Böðvar who drowned during a storm.
#&quot;Arinbjarnarkviða&quot;. Dedicated to his companion Arinbjörn
#&quot;Skjaldardrápa&quot;.
#&quot;Berudrápa&quot;.
#&quot;Lausavísur&quot;.
#Fragments

The following is one of Egil&#x27;s &quot;Lausavísur&quot; (no. 3), found in chapter 40 of &quot;Egils Saga&quot;:


==Runes==
Egil was also a scholar of runes. His apparent mastery of their magic powers assisted him several times during his journeys. During a feast at Atla-isle, Bard&#x27;s attempt to poison Egil failed when runes carved by Egil shattered his poisoned cup.

At a companion&#x27;s request, he examined a sick woman. A local land owner, after being denied her hand in marriage, had attempted to carve love-runes. Instead, he had mistakenly carved runes causing illness. Egil burned the offending runes and carved runes for health, and the woman recovered. He then sang a poem declaring that &quot;Runes none should grave ever/Who knows not to read them.&quot;

As for the sick young woman, in addition to burning the runes, Egil ordered her to be lifted out of bed and her old bedding to be thrown away and replaced with new sheets. Recovery was swift.

Runes were also employed by Egil during the raising of the Nithing Pole against King Eirik Bloodaxe and Queen Gunnhildr.

==Egil in popular culture==
* The Icelandic brewery Ölgerðin Egil Skallagrímsson is named after him.
* There is a talk show on Icelandic television called &quot;Egil&#x27;s Silver&quot;, named after Egil&#x27;s hidden treasure (the title is also a play on words with the host&#x27;s name being Egil.)

<text>A unit of selection is a biological entity within the hierarchy of biological organization (for example, an entity such as: a self-replicating molecule, a gene, a cell, an organism, a group, or a species) that is subject to natural selection. There is debate among evolutionary biologists about the extent to which evolution has been shaped by selective pressures acting at these different levels.

There is debate over the relative importance of the units themselves. For instance, is it group or individual selection that has driven the evolution of altruism? Where altruism reduces the fitness of &quot;individuals&quot;, individual-centered explanations for the evolution of altruism become complex and rely on the use of game theory, for instance; see kin selection and group selection. There also is debate over the definition of the units themselves, and the roles for selection and replication, and whether these roles may change in the course of evolution.

== Fundamental theory ==

Two useful introductions to the fundamental theory underlying the unit of selection issue and debate, which also present examples of multi-level selection from the entire range of the biological hierarchy (typically with entities at level &quot;N&quot;-1 competing for increased representation, i.e., higher frequency, at the immediately higher level &quot;N&quot;, e.g., organisms in populations or cell lineages in organisms), are Richard Lewontin&#x27;s classic piece &quot;The Units of Selection&quot; and John Maynard-Smith and Eörs Szathmáry&#x27;s co-authored book, &quot;The Major Transitions in Evolution&quot;. As a theoretical introduction to units of selection, Lewontin writes:
The generality of the principles of natural selection means that any entities in nature that have variation, reproduction, and heritability may evolve. ...the principles can be applied equally to genes, organisms, populations, species, and at opposite ends of the scale, prebiotic molecules and ecosystems.&quot; (1970, pp. 1-2)

Elisabeth Lloyd&#x27;s book &quot;The Structure and Confirmation of Evolutionary Theory&quot; provides a basic &quot;philosophical&quot; introduction to the debate. Three more recent introductions include Samir Okasha&#x27;s book &quot;Evolution and the Levels of Selection&quot;, Pierrick Bourrat&#x27;s book &quot;Facts, Conventions, and the Levels of Selection&quot;, and Elisabeth Lloyd and Javier Suárez book &quot;Units of Selection&quot;.

== Selection at each level ==

Below, cases of selection at the genic, cellular, individual and group level from within the multi-level selection perspective are presented and discussed.

=== Nucleic acid ===

George C. Williams in his influential book &quot;Adaptation and Natural Selection&quot; was one of the first to present a gene-centered view of evolution with the gene as the unit of selection, arguing that a unit of selection should exhibit a high degree of permanence.

Richard Dawkins has written several books popularizing and expanding the idea. According to Dawkins, genes cause phenotypes and a gene is &#x27;judged&#x27; by its phenotypic effects. Dawkins distinguishes entities which survive or fail to survive (&quot;replicators&quot;) from entities with temporary existence that interact directly with the environment (&quot;vehicles&quot;). Genes are &quot;replicators&quot; whereas individuals and groups of individuals are &quot;vehicles&quot;. Dawkins argues that, although they are both aspects of the same process, &quot;replicators&quot; rather than &quot;vehicles&quot; should be preferred as units of selection. This is because replicators, owing to their permanence, should be regarded as the ultimate beneficiaries of adaptations. Genes are replicators and therefore the gene is the unit of selection. Dawkins further expounded this view in an entire chapter called &#x27;God&#x27;s utility function&#x27; in the book &quot;River Out of Eden&quot; where he explained that genes alone have utility functions.

Some clear-cut examples of selection at the level of the gene include meiotic drive and retrotransposons. In both of these cases, gene sequences increase their relative frequency in a population without necessarily providing benefits at other levels of organization. Meiotic-drive mutations (see segregation distortion) manipulate the machinery of chromosomal segregation so that chromosomes carrying the mutation are later found in more than half of the gametes produced by individuals heterozygous for the mutation, and for this reason the frequency of the mutation increases in the population.

Retrotransposons are DNA sequences that, once replicated by the cellular machinery, insert themselves in the genome more or less randomly. Such insertions can be very mutagenic and thus reduce drastically individual fitness, so that there is strong selection against elements that are very active. Meiotic-drive alleles have also been shown strongly to reduce individual fitness, clearly exemplifying the potential conflict between selection at different levels.

According to the RNA world hypothesis, RNA sequences performing both enzymatic and information storage roles in autocatalytic sets were an early unit of selection and evolution that would later transition into living cells. It is possible that RNA-based evolution is still taking place today. Other subcellular entities such as viruses, both DNA-based and RNA-based, do evolve.

The gene-centered view of evolution normally refers to selection among different alleles of the same gene. However, gene families also differ in their tendency to diversify and avoid loss during evolution. This latter form of selection more closely resembles clade selection of groups of species.

=== Epigene ===

There is also view that evolution is acting on epigenes.

=== Cell ===

Leo Buss in his book &quot;The Evolution of Individuality&quot; proposes that much of the evolution of development in animals reflects the conflict between selective pressures acting at the level of the cell and those acting at the level of the multicellular individual. This perspective can shed new light on phenomena as diverse as gastrulation and germ line sequestration.

This selection for unconstrained proliferation is in conflict with the fitness interests of the individual, and thus there is tension between selection at the level of the cell and selection at the level of the individual. Since the proliferation of specific cells of the vertebrate immune system to fight off infecting pathogens is a case of programmed and exquisitely contained cellular proliferation, it represents a case of the individual manipulating selection at the level of the cell to enhance its own fitness. In the case of the vertebrate immune system, selection at the level of the cell and individual are not in conflict.

Some view cancer stem cells as units of selection.

=== Behavioural ===
Gene–culture coevolution was developed to explain how human behavior is a product of two different and interacting evolutionary processes: genetic evolution and cultural evolution.

=== Organism ===
Selection at the level of the organism can be described as Darwinism, and is well understood and considered common. If a relatively faster gazelle manages to survive and reproduce more, the causation of the higher fitness of this gazelle can be fully accounted for if one looks at how individual gazelles fare under predation.

The speed of the faster gazelle could be caused by a single gene, be polygenic, or be fully environmentally determined, but the unit of selection in this case is the individual since speed is a property of each individual gazelle.

When speaking about individual organism evolution an extended phenotype and superorganism must be also mentioned.

=== Group ===

If a group of organisms, owing to their interactions or division of labor, provides superior fitness compared to other groups, where the fitness of the group is higher or lower than the mean fitness of the constituent individuals, group selection can be declared to occur.

Specific syndromes of selective factors can create situations in which groups are selected because they display group properties which are selected-for. Many common examples of group traits are reducible to individual traits, however. Selection of these traits is thus more simply explained as selection of individual traits.

Some mosquito-transmitted rabbit viruses are only transmitted to uninfected rabbits from infected rabbits which are still alive. This creates a selective pressure on every group of viruses already infecting a rabbit not to become too virulent and kill their host rabbit before enough mosquitoes have bitten it, since otherwise all the viruses inside the dead rabbit would rot with it. And indeed in natural systems such viruses display much lower virulence levels than do mutants of the same viruses that in laboratory culture readily outcompete non-virulent variants (or than do tick-transmitted viruses since ticks do bite dead rabbits).

In the previous passage, the group is assumed to have &quot;lower virulence&quot;, i.e., &quot;virulence&quot; is presented as a group trait. One could argue then that the selection is in fact against individual viruses that are too virulent. In this case, however, the fitness of all viruses within a rabbit is affected by what the group does to the rabbit. Indeed, the proper, directly selected group property is that of &quot;not killing the rabbit too early&quot; rather than individual virulence. In situations such as these, we would expect there to be selection for cooperation amongst the viruses in a group in such a way that the group will not &quot;kill the rabbit too early&quot;. It is of course true that any group behavior is the result of individual traits, such as individual viruses suppressing the virulence of their neighbours, but the causes of phenotypes are rarely the causes of fitness differences.

=== Species and higher levels ===

It remains controversial among biologists whether selection can operate at and above the level of species. Proponents of species selection include R. A. Fisher (1929); Sewall Wright (1956); Richard Lewontin (1970); Niles Eldredge &amp; Stephen Jay Gould (1972); Steven M. Stanley (1975). Gould proposed that there exist macroevolutionary processes which shape evolution, not driven by the microevolutionary mechanisms of the Modern Synthesis. If one views species as entities that replicate (speciate) and die (go extinct) within a clade, then species could be subject to selection and thus could change their occurrence over geological time, much as heritable selected-for traits change theirs over generations.
For evolution to be driven by species selection, differential success must be the result of selection upon species-intrinsic properties, rather than for properties of genes, cells, individuals, or populations within species. Such properties include, for example, population structure, their propensity to speciate, extinction rates, and geological persistence. While the fossil record shows differential persistence of species, examples of species-intrinsic properties subject to natural selection have been much harder to document.

One issue with selection among clades is that they are not independent, i.e. all species are descended from the same last universal common ancestor and are thus part of the same clade. This criticism does not apply to selection among different gene families that are not evolutionarily related, and which are duplicated and lost at different rates rather than speciating and going extinct at different rates.

In the microbial realm, it has been interpreted that the unit of selection is a blend of ecological and functional behaviors, or guilds, beyond the species-level.

<text>Swedish Youth (, abbr. SU) is a political youth organization (age between 14 and 30) in Finland. It is the youth wing of the Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland. The organisation claims 2,500 members. It was founded in 1943.

Svensk Ungdom is a member of the International Federation of Liberal Youth, European Liberal Youth and Nordic Center Youth.

== Organization ==
Until 2008 there was a separate student organisation, Liberala studerande LSK (&quot;Liberal Students&quot;), but since then it functions as a committee inside SU.

Several previous chairpersons of SU, such as Astrid Thors for example, have later been ministers in the Finnish government.

The newspaper of the organization is &quot;Liber&quot;.

Svensk Ungdom&#x27;s current board consists of eight people and is chaired by Frida Sigfrids.

Svensk Ungdom&#x27;s highest governing body is its annual congress (Swedish: &quot;Kongressen&quot;), which takes place every spring around April. It decides on the political guidelines and the organisation&#x27;s board members. In 2020 the annual congress was moved to September due to the COVID-19 pandemic. For the same reason the annual congress of 2021 was held entirely virtually for the first time.

<text>Aquarium station is an underground rapid transit station on the MBTA Blue Line in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is located under State Street at Atlantic Avenue on the eastern edge of Boston&#x27;s Financial District near Boston Harbor. The station is named for the nearby New England Aquarium. It is adjacent to Long Wharf, which is used by four MBTA Boat routes. The station has two side platforms serving the two tracks of the Blue Line; an arched ceiling runs the length of the platform level. With the platforms below street level, it is the second-deepest station on the MBTA system (after Porter station).

The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) opened the Atlantic Avenue Elevated on August 22, 1901, with a station at State Street. The BERy opened the East Boston Tunnel under State Street and Long Wharf for streetcars on December 30, 1904. Construction of the intermediate station at Atlantic Avenue under the Elevated was delayed; it opened on April 5, 1906. Unlike other early stations in Boston, which were built with cut-and-cover tunneling, most of Atlantic Avenue station was built as a large barrel vault. The access shaft at the east end of the station was topped with a three-story headhouse, which included a footbridge to the elevated station. Four unusual angled elevators connected the headhouse to the platforms.

In 1924, the Boston Transit Department implemented a long-planned project to convert the tunnel from streetcars to high-floor metro trains, with high platforms added at the station. The Atlantic Avenue Elevated closed in 1938, while the subway station remained open. In 1948, the city began replacing the old headhouse and elevators with a smaller structure and escalators. On January 28, 1949, a welder ignited a grease fire that exploded down an elevator shaft, killing three people and burning numerous others. The station was closed until the completion of the renovations in January 1950. The station was renamed Aquarium in 1967 as part of rebranding by the 1964-formed Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA).

The MBTA began construction on a major renovation of the station in 1996. The platforms were lengthened for six-car trains, new entrances were added west of Atlantic Avenue, and the station was made fully accessible. The station was closed from October 14, 2000 to October 29, 2001; major construction was completed in 2003. Since the renovation, the station has had water leakage issues; it also occasionally floods during high tides and storm surges. The proposed North-South Rail Link includes a possible Central Station for MBTA Commuter Rail trains located under Aquarium station.

==Station layout==

Aquarium station is located under State Street at its intersection with Atlantic Avenue, near the edge of Boston Harbor. The station has two side platforms—each long enough for six-car trains—serving the two tracks of the Blue Line. The platforms are below street level, making it the second-deepest station on the MBTA system after Porter station. The Tip O&#x27;Neill Tunnel, which carries Interstate 93, passes over the center of the station and is supported by its roof. The older eastern part of the platform level has an arched ceiling, which widens to a triple vault in the newer western section.

Mezzanines with faregates are located at both ends of the station. The east mezzanine is located on the west end of Long Wharf, near the New England Aquarium. Two glass headhouses—one with escalators and stairs, the other with an elevator—provide access from the surface. The west mezzanine is located under State Street west of Atlantic Avenue, near the Custom House Tower. That mezzanine is accessed by a headhouse—which includes an elevator—on the south side of State Street, as well as a smaller entrance inside a building on the north side of the street.

The station is also served by the MBTA bus route , which runs on Atlantic Avenue at peak hours. Aquarium station is the primary transfer point between the MBTA subway and ferry services on Boston Harbor: MBTA Boat routes F2H, F3, F4, and F5 terminate at Long Wharf, as do several Boston Harbor Islands ferry routes.
==History==
===State Street station===

Construction of the Atlantic Avenue Elevated began on January 21, 1901. The Boston Elevated Railway (BERy) opened the line on August 22, 1901, including a stop at State Street. Like the other four stations on the line, State Street had a single elevated island platform with a single mezzanine underneath. Passengers entered the station from staircases on either side of Atlantic Avenue north of State Street, and exited on two staircases to the south. The platform was originally three cars—about —long; an extension to allow four-car trains was completed on June 13, 1902.

===Atlantic Avenue station===
On May 5, 1900, the Boston Transit Commission (BTC) began construction on the East Boston Tunnel—a streetcar tunnel between East Boston and downtown Boston under Boston Harbor. Construction started near the eastern terminus in Maverick Square, as the route in downtown Boston was not yet determined. Not until July 25, 1901 did the Commission determine that the Tunnel would run under State Street, with a station at Atlantic Avenue next to busy Long Wharf. The station was constructed in two sections under separate contracts. &quot;Atlantic Chambers&quot;, which served as the west end of the underwater portion of the tunnel, was built in an open cut just west of Atlantic Avenue; it housed the elevators and stairways to access the station as well as the ticket booths. The main arched station, to the west of Atlantic Chambers, was built with drifts. The two side platforms were long, wide, and below the surface.

Atlantic Chambers was a rectangular shaft measuring by , divided by three floors into four smaller chambers. The reinforced concrete walls were between thick. At the east end of each platform was a space for elevators and stairs; these two rooms and the trackway between them occupied the lowest chamber. Construction of Atlantic Chambers began on December 5, 1901, and excavation was complete by May 29, 1903. On June 19, 1903, compressed air in the tunnel to the east blew out the bulkhead into Atlantic Chambers, killing two workers. This air pressure had been necessary to keep water from seeping into the tunnel; after the accident, Atlantic Avenue settled slightly above the tunnel. It was necessary to use additional dunnage to limit sagging of the elevated line above; even so, elevated operations were impacted from June 20 to October 7, 1903.

Unlike other early stations in Boston, which were built with cut-and-cover tunneling, most of Atlantic Avenue station was built as a large barrel vault. Drifts were first used to construct the vertical station walls, then the crown of the arch. Transverse sections of the arch were then completed, followed by the invert. The arch was wide and tall; the walls of the station were thick and the arch thick. Work began on this section on March 17, 1902; the last section of arch was completed on June 26, 1903. The rough work of the station vault was completed on August 28, 1903, with the tilework finished on January 19, 1904, and the granolithic platforms on February 10. The Paris Métro train fire in August 1903 led the BTC and BERy to desire emergency exits from stations with only a single headhouse. A pair of curved staircases were built from the western ends of the platform; they joined to form a straight staircase above the arch of the tunnel. The exit stairs were completed on September 6, 1904, with a small building in State Street covering them completed on October 10.

A three-story headhouse, measuring , was built over Atlantic Chambers. The ground floor contained the main entrance and exit for the station. The second floor (of nearly identical plan) served a footbridge to the fare mezzanine of State Street station, while the third floor was a machine room for the elevators. The headhouse was designed by Charles Brigham, who had previously designed the Scollay Square and Adams Square headhouses for the Tremont Street Subway. Shafts leading to the headhouse served as the primarily ventilation for the Boston end of the tunnel. Each platform was served with two elevators, which rose to the ground floor and more to the footbridge level. Because the elevators needed to serve the separated platforms and the narrower headhouse, they were built with an angled section with approximately of vertical travel. The elevators were about apart on the platforms and apart at both headhouse levels; as late as the 1940s, the elevators were unique among subway stations.

The BTC and BERy agreed in November 1903 to include the footbridge. However, the two could not agree on who should pay for the elevators: the BERy maintained they were a fundamental part of the station infrastructure and thus the responsibility of the BTC, while the BTC considered them an operational item and thus the domain of the BERy. In March 1904, they reached an agreement to allow construction of the elevators and headhouse (so as not to delay the station) while deferring the cost question. (The matter was not settled until a Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruling in 1913.) The BTC awarded the contract for the headhouse on August 15, 1904, with completion scheduled for December 15; however, manufacture of the steel components was severely delayed. The East Boston Tunnel opened on December 30, 1904, serving streetcars which ran between Court Street downtown and Maverick portal in East Boston, where they joined existing surface lines. The only intermediate stop was at Devonshire; Atlantic Avenue station was not yet complete. Most of the headhouse except for some detail work was completed by July 1905; the elevators were tested in January 1906. Atlantic Avenue station opened in the tunnel on April 5, 1906. The Atlantic Avenue and State Street stations had separate fare gates; a paper transfer was required to change lines.

===Modifications===

In August 1908, the elevated platform was again expanded southwards, this time to eight-car length—about —to match the length of platforms in the nearly-complete Washington Street Tunnel. An extension of the elevated mezzanine and a second exit stairwell from the elevated platform to the mezzanine opened on October 26, 1908. In 1926, significant repairs were made to the Atlantic Chamber (the headhouse of Atlantic Avenue station).

====Platform raising====
The East Boston Tunnel was originally planned to be operated with high-floor metro rolling stock and connected to the then-planned Cambridge Elevated line. When that plan was dropped in 1903 due to a disagreement between the BTC and the BERy, the stations were built with low platforms. Large bi-loading streetcars (with high floors but capable of loading from low platforms), which incorporated many attributes from metro cars used on the Main Line El, began use in 1905. However, neither these nor the large center-entrance cars introduced in 1917 (which were designed for multiple unit operation) could fully handle the crowds.

In 1921, the Boston Transit Department (BTD)—the successor to the BTC—began work at Maverick Square to convert the East Boston Tunnel to high-floor metro trains. The next year, the BTD board approved the construction of high-level platforms at Atlantic Avenue, Devonshire, Scollay Under, and Bowdoin. Construction of concrete high-level platforms above the rails at Atlantic Avenue began in December 1923 or January 1924. A section of low-level platform was left to serve streetcars during construction. Over the weekend of April 18–21, 1924, the East Boston Tunnel was converted to high-floor metro stock. Temporary wooden platform sections were put in place to allow service to begin on April 21, with the permanent concrete sections completed by July 12. The elevators at Atlantic Avenue were also modified for the new platform heights. The edges of the original low platforms can still be seen under the high platforms.

====Fire and new headhouse====

The East Boston Tunnel cut sharply into East Boston ferry ridership, which in turn reduced connecting ridership on the Atlantic Avenue Elevated. The Elevated closed on September 30, 1938, and was torn down during World War II for scrap metal. With the aging headhouse and its connection to the Elevated no longer needed, the city began planning a modernization of the station. A $242,000 contract to purchase four escalators was approved on October 17, 1946. In 1948, the Boston Transit Department awarded a $350,000 contract to add the new escalators, remove the elevators, and construct a new headhouse on the north side of State Street.

On January 28, 1949, a grease fire ignited by the acetylene torch of a welder removing one of the elevators spread down the elevator shaft and onto the platforms. The fire occurred during the morning rush hour, with 300 passengers having just alighted from an eastbound train. Most escaped through the emergency exit, which was opened by a passenger, while some used the stairs in the main headhouse. Three people died in the headhouse: two passengers who missed the ground-level exit in the smoke while climbing the stairs and became trapped on the second floor, and one construction worker. The fire was compared to the 1942 Cocoanut Grove fire due to the intensity of the victims&#x27; burns.

After the fire, the station was closed until construction was completed. The fire sparked political debate into the safety record of the MTA (which had replaced the BERy in 1947), and which entity was to blame: the city owned the subway lines and stations within its borders, while the MTA operated them. The new headhouse was a rectangular structure made of limestone and granite in the Stripped Classical style, with four escalators replacing the old elevators. The station reopened on January 12, 1950.

===MBTA era===

The construction of the Central Artery in the 1950s left the station cut off from Downtown Boston to the west. Atlantic Avenue station was renamed Aquarium on February 13, 1967, as part of a general rebranding by the newly created MBTA—the then under-construction New England Aquarium, which opened in 1969, was only some from the existing station. The subway lines were given colored identifying names, with the East Boston Tunnel route becoming the Blue Line, and several other downtown stations were renamed. The station was modernized as part of a $9 million systemwide station improvement program, with a dedication ceremony on August 26, 1968.

In the 1970s, part of Atlantic Avenue was relocated a block to the west under the Central Artery for redevelopment, which left Aquarium station on the east side of the realigned street. With its platforms some below street level, Aquarium was the deepest station on the MBTA until Porter station opened in 1984. The aging escalators were responsible for several injuries, including in 1995 when a three-year-old&#x27;s leg was badly cut.

====Reconstruction====

In 1988, the MBTA began a major renovation project to lengthen Blue Line station platforms for use of six-car trains. On February 14, 1990, the MBTA board voted to move the renovation of Aquarium station—including a new entrance on State Street—into final design. The contract for final design was not awarded until June 20, 1992, due to changes associated with the Big Dig project. The revised design called for a reinforced box structure, in which the new Central Artery tunnel would sit, on top of the station arch. In October 1995, the state opened bidding on an estimated $268 million project, which included the station renovations plus the Central Artery tunnel section from State Street to High Street.

In 1996, the MBTA began construction of the renovation and platform lengthening project at Aquarium. The work took place during the Big Dig, which moved the Central Artery to the new tunnel and built the Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway on the surface. The station was fully closed from October 14, 2000 to October 29, 2001; State was temporarily named &quot;State/Aquarium&quot; during the closure, and a shuttle bus (route 650) was run between the two stations. Two new entrances were added on State Street west of Atlantic Avenue. A new headhouse with an elevator on the south side of State Street opened on October 29, 2001, and was temporarily the only entrance to the station; an entrance on the north side of the street in the Marketplace Center building opened soon after. The renovated Long Wharf entrance, with two headhouses on the east side of the Kennedy Greenway, did not reopen until September 22, 2003. The entire reconstruction cost $110 million.

The reconstructed station was designed by Harry Ellenzweig, who had previously designed Alewife station for the MBTA decades earlier. The original station was extended westward, with wider platforms in the new section. The western extension has a &quot;triple vaulted aluminum ceiling&quot;, with the middle vault matching the curve of the original arch. The fare mezzanines on each end of the station have red slate floors, and aluminum panels cover the walls and ceilings. The headhouses were intended to mimic nearby buildings: the western headhouse incorporates a granite element similar to the adjacent State Street Block, while the sloped eastern headhouses include bricks matching the adjacent Marriott Long Wharf. The lower part of the platform walls are covered by &quot;Currents&quot; (originally &quot;Untitled Wall&quot;), a pair of -long black-and-white tile mosaics by Jun Kaneko. They were installed as part of the Arts on the Line program.

====Water issues====

Since the 1996–2003 reconstruction, Aquarium station has been plagued by water leaks, which may have been caused either by the renovation or by adjacent Big Dig construction. (Leakage was noticed in the station even before its 1906 opening, albeit at a much smaller rate.) The location of the east headhouse near Boston Harbor has resulted in additional flooding during king tides and storm surges. On January 4, 2018, the station was flooded with ocean water associated with the surge from the January 2018 North American blizzard. It was closed &quot;indefinitely&quot; but ultimately reopened the next day. A nor&#x27;easter that March caused flooding that again briefly closed the station. These floods damaged elevators and escalators at the station, leaving them out of service for months.

In 2019, the MBTA began using temporary barriers to control flooding at Aquarium during storms. A permanent fix for both leaks and flooding is estimated to cost $20–40 million. A 14-day closure of the Blue Line for maintenance work in May 2020 included drainage work at Aquarium. A $1.7 million project, which took place from August 2020 to March 2021, added supports for aluminum planks that can be temporarily installed during high water events.

====Central Station proposal====
The North–South Rail Link (NSRL) is a proposed railway tunnel which would link the two halves of the MBTA Commuter Rail system between North Station and South Station under downtown Boston. It was originally proposed to run deep beneath the Central Artery, passing under Aquarium station at a depth of . In 2003, the MBTA released the Major Investment Study/Draft Environmental Impact Report, which considered two-track and four-track NSRL designs with or without an intermediate Central Station. The station would have platforms between State Street and Broad Street. It would have four headhouses—two just north of Milk Street, and two just south of India Street and East India Row—plus a direct connection to Aquarium station. The report estimated that adding Central Station would increase commuter rail ridership by between 3,500 and 12,800 daily trips (depending on other elements of the tunnel design), but add between $540 million and $817 million (about one-sixth) to the total costs of construction. During the renovation of Aquarium station, slurry walls were built to a depth of to futureproof for the construction of the NSRL and Central Station.

A 2018 re-evaluation of the NSRL examined two-track and four-track alternatives under the Central Artery, as well as two-track alternatives under Congress Street (which was rejected in the 2003 report). Only the more-expensive four-track option would include Central Station. However, the Congress Street alternatives would have their northern station under Haymarket Square rather than under the existing North Station; this would allow for a Blue Line connection at State rather than Aquarium.

<text>The Left Youth (&quot;Vasemmistonuoret&quot; in Finnish, &quot;Vänsterunga&quot; in Swedish) is a political youth organization in Finland. It is considered the youth wing of the Left Alliance, but it is not officially affiliated with the party - members of the Left Youth are not automatically members of the Left Alliance.

The organization was founded in 1944. Until 1998, it was known as the Finnish Democratic Youth League (SDNL, &quot;Suomen demokraattinen nuorisoliitto&quot;) and until 1990 it served as the youth organization of the now-defunct Finnish People&#x27;s Democratic League (SKDL). SDNL was a founding member of World Federation of Democratic Youth, but its main international frame used to be the European Network of Democratic Young Left until its dissolution.

<doc id="1109231" wikidata="Q4006821" url="?curid=1109231" title="Sir Uvedale Price, 1st Baronet">
<text>Sir Uvedale Price, 1st Baronet (baptised 14 April 1747 – 14 September 1829), author of the &quot;Essay on the Picturesque, As Compared with the Sublime and The Beautiful&quot; (1794), was a Herefordshire landowner who was at the heart of the &#x27;Picturesque debate&#x27; of the 1790s.

==His life==

Uvedale Price was the eldest son of Robert Price, an amateur artist, by his wife the Hon. Sarah Barrington, daughter of John Shute Barrington, 1st Viscount Barrington. Educated at Eton and at Christ Church, Oxford, Price inherited the family estate of Foxley (in Yazor in Herefordshire) when he came of age in 1768, a few years after the death of his father in 1761 and of his grandfather (Uvedale Tomkins Price) in 1764. As a young man Price was a figure on London&#x27;s social scene, and was once described as the &quot;macaroni of his age,&quot; but with his inheritance and his marriage to Lady Caroline Carpenter, youngest daughter of George Carpenter, 1st Earl of Tyrconnel, he settled down at Foxley to tend to the estate and develop his theories on landscape, as well as equally controversial work on the pronunciation of the Classical languages. He served as High Sheriff of Herefordshire in 1793, and was created a baronet on 12 February 1828.

During his life, Price was befriended by Sir George Beaumont and his wife Margaret Beaumont, with whom he corresponded extensively. He was also a lifetime friend of the statesman Charles James Fox as well as being acquainted with William Wordsworth, and in later life, a correspondent of Elizabeth Barrett Browning. He died in 1829 aged 82, having finally printed his work on Greek and Latin pronunciation. His only son Robert succeeded as 2nd (and last) baronet.

==The Picturesque and Landscape theory==
Price developed his ideas with his close neighbour Richard Payne Knight, whose poem &#x27;The Landscape&#x27; was published the same year as Price&#x27;s &quot;Essay&quot; delineating his theories on &quot;The Picturesque&quot; as a mode of landscape.

Well before Price&#x27;s &quot;Essay&quot; or Knight&#x27;s poem, however, the term was used in early 18th century France to refer to a property of being &quot;in the style of a painter&quot;. Pope, in his &quot;Letter to Caryll&quot;, brought the word into English as &quot;picturesque&quot; in 1712. The term was used by various English authors throughout the 18th century (cf. &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; &#x27;picturesque&#x27;) before being described by Bagehot in &quot;Literary Studies&quot; (1879) as &quot;a quality distinct from that of beauty, or sublimity, or grandeur.&quot;

For Price, the Picturesque was more specifically defined as being located between the Beautiful and the Sublime. In practical application this meant that his preferred mode of landscaping was to retain old trees, rutted paths, and textured slopes, rather than to sweep all these away in the style that had been practised by Lancelot &quot;Capability&quot; Brown. Price contested, for example, the obsession of &quot;The Beautiful&quot; with Classical and natural symmetry, arguing instead for a less formal and more asymmetrical interpretation of nature.

Price&#x27;s ideas led to much debate in artistic and literary circles: they were parodied, for example, by Jane Austen in &quot;Northanger Abbey&quot;. Price republished the &quot;Essay&quot; several times, with additional material, and entered into a public debate with Humphry Repton over the latter&#x27;s approach to landscape design. He similarly fell out with Payne Knight, whose theories of landscape betrayed a more esoteric attitude.

However, Finns Party decided to cut ties with Finns Party Youth due to the perceived ethno nationalist support in the youth wing in 2020. The youth wing went bankrupt in May 2020, due to the cut support. The temporary chair of the is Jenna Simula, a current MP.

The current chairperson is Asseri Kinnunen, and the secretary general is Toni Saarinen.

Since 2013 the youth wing has published a magazine titled &quot;Rahvas&quot;.

In the run-up to the 2019 European elections, the youth wing posted a tweet with an image of a dark-skinned couple holding a baby, with text urging people to vote for the Finns Party &quot;if you don’t want Finland’s future to look like this&quot;

In 2020, the Finns Party ousted the youth wing&#x27;s second vice chair, Toni Jalonen, due to statements he made at a conference in Tallinn, Estonia in which he declared himself an ethnic nationalist, a traditionalist and a fascist.

<text>Guazacapán () is a town located in Santa Rosa Department in south-west Guatemala.
Guazacapán is also the name of the municipality in Santa Rosa Department around the town of Guazacapán. The municipality of Guazacapán covers an area of 130 km2 with a population of 18,855, according to the 2018 census.

== History ==
The town dates back to pre-Columbian times, being in existence prior to the arrival of the Spanish Conquistadores in the 16th century.

Guazacapán is known for the supposed witchcraft that used to be widely practiced by the indigenous people. The last of the great wizards, Pedro Dávila, died in 1974, and the craft is quickly being forgotten. There are still a few people who practice &quot;white magic&quot; in Guazacapán.

The Guazacapán area was once inhabited by Xinca, one of Guatemala&#x27;s indigenous groups. They settled there after the Pipil. Currently, there are efforts being made to teach the ancient Xinca language to the newer generations. There is in the town a rich history, and the people who live there keep that history alive through celebrations that incorporate traditional costume, marimba music and folkloric dance.

<text>Tzanata () is an inland village in the southeast of Kefalonia, one of the Ionian Islands of Greece. It is part of the community of Poros within the Eleios-Pronnoi municipal unit. It is situated 3 km southwest of Poros, 25 km southeast of Sami and 36 km east of Argostoli.

Along with the neighbouring villages of Agia Eirini and Kampitsata, it is situated in a fertile plain south of the Atros hill. The village has a small school, community centre and community clinic; a sports stadium to serve the local area is slowly being completed. A mineral water spring (vrysi) fed from the ‘bottomless’ Avithos lake at Agios Nikolaos feeds a fountain in the plane tree sheltered square where the village festivals, served by souvlaki stalls and the adjacent taverna, are held in the summer months. Water from the surrounding mountains also feeds two reservoirs just outside the village, one completed in 2005 to feed the burgeoning summer demands of nearby Skala.

In 1991 archaeologist Lazaros Kolonas, excavating in the Broutzi area of Tzanata, discovered a tholos (beehive) tomb from the Mycenaean period measuring 6.80 meters in diameter. Some claim that it is the burial place of Odysseus; others believe it to be the tomb of earlier royalty, circa 1400 BC. It is the most important historical find on Kefalonia to date. The site is signposted from the Tzanata-Poros road.

As the road to Poros enters the impressive Poros gorge, there is a rough vehicular track leading 4.5 km to Atros, the oldest monastery and surviving structure on Kefalonia.

==Transport==

Served by the fairly reliable, but infrequent, Argostoli – Poros bus.

<doc id="1109273" wikidata="Q4776946" url="?curid=1109273" title="Antonio Russolo">
<text>Antonio Russolo (1877–1943) was an Italian Futurist composer and the brother of the more famous Futurist painter, composer and theorist Luigi Russolo. He is noted for composing pieces made with the intonarumori and, together with his brother, introduced &quot;The Art of Noises&quot;.

== Biography ==
Russolo was the son of Domenico Russolo who was a clockmaker as well as a piano and organ tuner. The family moved to Latisana when Domenico became the director of the town&#x27;s Philharmonic School and the Schola Cantorum. Antonio learned music early through his father, who successfully prepared him and another brother, Giovanni, to pass the entrance exam at the Milan Conservatory. He completed a degree in piano and organ.

=== The Art of Noises ===
Russolo helped his brother Luigi construct noise-intoning intonarumori instruments in line with the noise music manifesto that Luigi released called &quot;The Art of Noises&quot;. This Futurist musical concept, which was introduced by F.T. Marinetti, sought to avoid imitating the sound of everyday life by stylizing sonic materials so that it loses its original sense; acquiring a new aural sphere in the process. It opposed the philosophy behind the Late Romanticism, which favored the reproduction of reality.

Several compositions by Russolo that included the intonarumori are considered hybrid. These were pieces based on traditional instrumentation and modified to include the noise music machines. A record made by Russolo in 1921 is the only surviving sound recording that features the original intonarumori. It includes the pieces, &quot;Corale&quot; and &quot;Serenata&quot;, which combined conventional orchestral music set against the famous noise machines. This music was released in 1924 on a 78 rpm record. In these pieces, Russolo used the intonarumori as underlay. The sounds made are described as tunes disrupted by growls and low-pitched electrical interference. In the same year, Russolo&#x27;s compositions were conducted during a concert organized by F.T. Marinetti at the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. The program included four of Russolo&#x27;s work along with two compositions of Nuccio Fiorda. The use of the noise intoners were acclaimed by critics such as Sergei Prokofiev, Sergei Diaghilev, Leonide Massine, and Piet Mondrian.

==Recordings==
* &quot;Corale, Serenata&quot; by Antonio Russolo and Luigi Russolo (1924) were published on cassette in 1988 in the &quot;Audio By Visual Artists&quot; edition of &quot;Tellus Audio Cassette Magazine&quot; #21 and are archived on the internet at Ubuweb

<doc id="1109279" wikidata="Q340587" url="?curid=1109279" title="Achondrite">
<text>An achondrite is a stony meteorite that does not contain chondrules. It consists of material similar to terrestrial basalts or plutonic rocks and has been differentiated and reprocessed to a lesser or greater degree due to melting and recrystallization on or within meteorite parent bodies. As a result, achondrites have distinct textures and mineralogies indicative of igneous processes.

Achondrites account for about 8% of meteorites overall, and the majority (about formula_1) of them belong to the HED clan, possibly originating from the crust of asteroid Vesta. Other types include Martian, Lunar, and several types thought to originate from as-yet unidentified asteroids. These groups have been determined on the basis of e.g. the Fe/Mn chemical ratio and the 17O/18O oxygen isotope ratios, thought to be characteristic &quot;fingerprints&quot; for each parent body.

==Classification==
Achondrites are classified into the following groups:
*Primitive achondrites
*Asteroidal achondrites
*Lunar meteorites
*Martian meteorites

===Primitive achondrites===
Primitive achondrites, also called PAC group, are so-called because their chemical composition is &quot;primitive&quot; in the sense that it is similar to the composition of chondrites, but their texture is igneous, indicative of melting processes. To this group belong:
* Acapulcoites (after the meteorite Acapulco, Mexico)
* Lodranites (after the meteorite Lodran)
* Winonaites (after the meteorite Winona)
* Ureilites (after the meteorite Novy Ureii, Russia)
* Brachinites (after the meteorite Brachina)

===Asteroidal achondrites===
Asteroidal achondrites, also called evolved achondrites, are so-called because they have been &quot;differentiated&quot; on a parent body. This means that their mineralogical and chemical composition was changed by melting and crystallization processes. They are divided into several groups:
* HED meteorites (Vesta). They may have originated on the asteroid 4 Vesta, because their reflection spectra are very similar. They are named after the initial letters of the three subgroups:
** Howardites
** Eucrites
** Diogenites
* Angrites
* Aubrites

===Lunar meteorites===
Lunar meteorites are meteorites that originated from the Moon.

===Martian meteorite===
Martian meteorites are meteorites that originated from Mars. They are divided into three main groups, with two exceptions (see last two entries):
* Shergottites
* Nakhlites
* Chassignites
* OPX martian meteorites (ALH 84001)
* Regolith/Soil samples (NWA 7034 and pairings)

<doc id="1109283" wikidata="Q7227799" url="?curid=1109283" title="Pongaroa">
<text>Pongaroa is a town in the Tararua District, in the southeast of the North Island of New Zealand, 110 kilometres southwest of Hastings and 200 kilometres northeast of Wellington. The nearest town is Pahiatua, 50 kilometres to the west. Popular Ākitio Beach is 30 kilometres to the east. The township straddles Route 52, a road between Masterton and Waipukurau.

The New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage gives a translation of &quot;tall tree fern&quot; for &quot;Pongaroa&quot;.

Pongaroa village has a population of about 100, with the surrounding farms bringing the total population to about 300. The area is serviced by Pongaroa School, Pongaroa General Store, Pongaroa Hotel, and Pongaroa Farm Centre. Pongaroa is also the location of the New Zealand Centre for Equine Psychology and Behaviour and Wildside Farm environmental education retreat.

Local volunteers have been responsible for the public toilets, the establishment of a freedom campsite, and improvements to the village centre.

Historically, Pongaroa belonged in the northern Wairarapa area. At one time during the early settlement years in the latter half of the 19th century, the township was much larger: people expected that the Masterton-Napier Railway would run through Pongaroa. However, eventually the Wairarapa Line cut through Pahiatua (1897) and thus that township grew, whilst Pongaroa remained a farming community. Pongaroa became an administrative centre of Akitio County, which functioned between 1899 and 1976.

Pāpāuma marae, a &quot;marae&quot; (tribal meeting ground) of the Rangitāne tribes and its Ngāti Mutuahi, Ngāti Pakapaka and Te Hika a Pāpāuma &quot;hapū&quot; (sub-tribes), is located in the Pangaoroa area.

<text>Jacob Akiba Marinsky (April 11, 1918, Buffalo, New York – September 1, 2005) was a chemist who was the co-discoverer of the element promethium.

==Biography==
Marinsky was born in Buffalo, New York on April 11, 1918. He attended the State University of New York at Buffalo, beginning at age 16 and receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in chemistry in 1939.

During World War II he was employed as a chemist for the Manhattan Project, working for Clinton Laboratories (now Oak Ridge National Laboratory) from 1944 to 1946. In 1945, together with Lawrence E. Glendenin and Charles D. Coryell, he isolated the previously undocumented rare earth element 61 (promethium). Marinsky and Glendenin produced it both by extraction from fission products and by bombarding neodymium with neutrons. They isolated it using ion-exchange chromatography. Publication of the finding was delayed until later due to the war. Marinsky and Glendenin announced the discovery at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in September 1947. Upon the suggestion of Charles D. Coryell&#x27;s wife Grace Coryell, the team named the new element for the mythical god Prometheus, who stole fire from the gods and was punished for the act by Zeus. They had also considered naming it &quot;clintonium&quot; for the facility where it was isolated.

Marinsky was among the Manhattan Project scientists who in 1945 signed a petition against using an atomic bomb on Japan.

He resumed his education after the war, obtaining a PhD in Nuclear and Inorganic Chemistry from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1949. He worked in industrial research before joining the faculty of the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1957. His research was concerned with nuclear inorganic chemistry, physicochemical studies of ion exchange, and polyelectrolyte and electrolyte systems. During the early 1960s Marinsky was a Fulbright Research Scholar at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel. He worked again for SUNY at Buffalo during the late 1960s; when during that time the university required faculty to sign an oath of loyalty to the United States, Marinsky refused, terming it a violation of civil liberties; some other faculty members lost their jobs due to such a refusal. He retired in 1988, becoming a professor emeritus.

In 1990, he received the Clifford Furnas Memorial Award of the State University of New York at Buffalo, awarded to graduates whose scientific accomplishments brought prestige to the university.

Marinsky died on September 1, 2005, from multiple myeloma. He was buried in Pine Hill Cemetery in Buffalo. He was survived by his wife, the former Ruth Slick, to whom he was married for 63 years. They were the parents of four daughters.

<text>The Gabon national football team (French: &quot;Équipe de football du Gabon&quot;) represents Gabon in men&#x27;s international football. The team&#x27;s nickname is The Panthers and it is governed by the Gabonese Football Federation. They have never qualified for the FIFA World Cup, but have qualified eight times (as of 2021) for the Africa Cup of Nations. Gabon is a member of both FIFA and Confederation of African Football (CAF).

==History==

===1960s===
Gabon made their debut on 13 April 1960 by entering the first Friendship Games (&quot;Jeux de L&#x27;Amitié&quot;) tournament, created for French-speaking African countries (a precursor to the modern African Games), held in Antananarivo, Madagascar. In the First Round they were drawn against Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), who were also making their debut, and lost 5–4, despite leading 3–2 at half-time. They did not play another match for over a year and a half, until the next time the tournament was staged, in December 1961 in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. They were drawn in Pool 3 alongside Cameroon and Senegal. Gabon began the tournament with a 3–2 defeat to Senegal on Christmas Day, before being thrashed 6–0 by Cameroon on Boxing Day, finishing bottom of their group. A few months after the tournament, the Gabonese Football Federation (&quot;Federation Gabonaise de Football&quot;) was formed to officially oversee the development of the national team and the domestic game. The new association would not have to wait long for their first win, as in their very next match on 14 July 1962 they defeated the Congo 3–1 in their first match on home soil. They played two more matches in 1962, a 1–1 home draw with Cameroon on 20 August, a vast improvement over their previous meeting, and a 3–1 away defeat to the Congo on 16 September, before entering the third and final Friendship Games held in April 1963 in Dakar, Senegal. They were drawn in Group C, along with British Gambia, the France amateur team, and Upper Volta. They opened on 12 April with a strong 4–0 win over Upper Volta, but were comfortably beaten 3–0 by the French amateurs two days later. They drew their final game 2–2 with British Gambia on 16 April and finished second in the group, a marked improvement over their previous two appearances at the tournament; however only the group winners progressed and therefore Gabon were eliminated. A few months later, Gabon entered qualification for the 1966 FIFA World Cup held in England. However, on 8 October 1964 they withdrew from the competition, along with all the other African entrants, in protest at FIFA&#x27;s decision to only award one finals place to all of Africa, Asia and Oceania.

As a result of this boycott, Gabon did not play another match for over two years until August 1965, when they hosted a friendly double-header against Nigeria, drawing 2–2 on 28 August and losing 4–1 the next day. At the 35th FIFA Congress held in London, England on 6 July 1966, Gabon were officially admitted as full members of FIFA. They played their next match on 2 December 1966 when they suffered a 4–3 defeat against the Democratic Republic of the Congo, before playing them again on 4 January 1967 at home, this time winning 1–0. They played one more friendly, a 3–0 home defeat to the Ivory Coast on 28 March, before entering qualification for the 1968 Olympic football tournament, held in Mexico. In the First Round, they were drawn against Guinea with whom they drew the first leg 0–0 at home on 18 June, before being routed in the second leg 6–1, on 9 July. In 1967, they also became full members of CAF. Following on from the Olympic qualifiers, Gabon did not play another match for over two years until they travelled to Dahomey (now Benin) on 24 August 1969 to play a friendly, which they lost 1–0.

===1970s===
Gabon then did not play for over a year, before entering qualification for the Africa Cup of Nations for the first time. Their attempt to qualify for the 1972 tournament held in Cameroon fell at the first hurdle however, as they were drawn against Ivory Coast in the First Round. They lost the first leg at home 2–1 on 8 November 1970, and were defeated 1–0 away two weeks later. Gabon then entered qualification for the 1972 Olympic football tournament held in West Germany. In the First Round they were drawn against Cameroon. Having lost the first leg 3–2 in Libreville on 30 May 1971, Gabon forfeited the tie as they did not travel to Yaoundé to contest the return leg. Following this ignominious exit, Gabon entered qualification for the 1974 FIFA World Cup held in West Germany, and were due to play Cameroon in the First Round the Summer of 1972, however they withdrew before the matches could be played. As a result of this withdrawal, they did not play another match for over a year until they entered the football tournament at the 1972 Central African Cup (a precursor to the Central African Games) held in Brazzaville, Congo. The 5-team round robin tournament included, alongside Gabon; Cameroon, the Central African Republic, the Congo, and Chad. They played their first match on 16 July against the Congo, losing 3–0. Two days later they were defeated 3–1 by the Central African Republic and on 20 July they were soundly beaten by Cameroon, 4–0. However they salvaged some pride by beating Chad 1–0 in their final match on 22 July to avoid the bottom spot. Furthermore, this tournament doubled up as a qualification group for the 1973 All-Africa Games football tournament, and as Gabon did not win the group, they failed to qualify. A year later they entered qualification for the 1974 African Cup of Nations held in Egypt, and were due to play the Central African Republic in the summer of 1973, however they once again withdrew before a ball was kicked.

As a result, Gabon did not play a single match for almost 4 years until they thrashed São Tomé and Príncipe 6–1 at home in a friendly in May 1976, which was São Tomé and Príncipe&#x27;s first international match. A few weeks later Gabon hosted the inaugural Central African Games. In the football tournament, they were drawn into Group B alongside Burundi, Cameroon and Rwanda. They played their opening match on 28 June, registering a convincing 4–1 win over Burundi. Then, on 1 July they played out a 1–1 draw against Zaire who had travelled to Gabon to play each team in Group B in a friendly capacity, and had not entered the competition proper. On 5 July Gabon gained another impressive victory, beating Rwanda 3–0. In their final group game on 7 July they held neighbours Cameroon to creditable 0–0 draw, thus securing 2nd place (having only missed out on the top spot via goal difference) and qualification for the semi-finals. On 9 July they faced Group A winners the Congo, and were narrowly beaten 1–0. However, two days later they managed to clinch 3rd place with a 3–1 victory of the Central African Republic, to put the seal on an impressive performance in their own tournament. A year later, Gabon entered qualification for the 1978 African Cup of Nations held in Ghana. After being given a bye in the First Round, they were drawn against the Congo in the Second. They lost the first leg away 3–2 on 17 July 1977, and drew the second at home 3–3 on 31 July, losing 6–5 on aggregate. Later that year, they entered a qualification tournament for the football competition at the 1978 All-Africa Games held in Algiers, Algeria. The qualification tournament for their zone, which was held in Cameroon, consisted of 2 groups, with the top two teams in each group progressing to the semi-finals. In Gabon&#x27;s group (B) were Burundi, the Congo and Equatorial Guinea. They beat Equatorial Guinea 2–0 in their opening match on Christmas Eve, defeated the Congo 1–0 on Boxing Day and beat Burundi 2–0 two days later. With 3 wins out of 3, they topped their group and faced Group A runners-up Chad in the semi-finals to whom they lost 3–1 on New Year&#x27;s Eve, and therefore failed to qualify, as only the tournament winner went to the finals. A few months later in February 1978, they hosted a friendly against Nigeria, which they lost 1–0. In January 1979, they registered a 2–2 away draw against Rwanda, before defeating Ivory Coast 2–1 at home in April.

===2010s===

In the 2010 Africa Cup of Nations, Gabon upset Cameroon 1–0 and had a good chance of progressing to the quarter-finals after a scoreless draw against Tunisia. However, Gabon lost 2–1 to Zambia as it finished in its group with a three-way tie with Zambia and Cameroon. Gabon only scored twice in the group stage and were eliminated on the goals scored tiebreaker. 
In 2012 Africa Cup of Nations, Gabon co-hosted the tournament as it won their group matches: 2–0 against Niger, 3–2 against Morocco, and 1–0 against Tunisia. The second match saw Gabon qualify for its first quarter-final since 1996 in the most dramatic circumstances. Gabon had come back to lead 2–1 only for Morocco to tie the match in early stoppage time. However, on the final play of the game, Gabon scored in the eighth minute of stoppage time, from a direct free kick. Eventually, Gabon lost 5–4 in penalties (1–1 a.e.t) in the quarterfinal against Mali, after a penalty missed by Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang, who had scored three goals in the tournament.

Gabon began its 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign in the second round in Group E as it was drawn with Niger, Burkina Faso, and Congo. Despite opening its campaign with a scoreless draw against Niger, Gabon lost 3–0 due to having fielded ineligible player Charly Moussono. After four qualifiers, Gabon scored only one goal, but thanks to an Aubameyang hat-trick on 15 June 2013, Gabon stayed in contention for a play-off berth with a 4–1 victory over Niger. However, Burkina Faso eliminated Gabon in the final qualifier with the 1–0 result as Gabon finished third in its group.

For the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations, Gabon has been drawn to qualify against Togo. Even though Daniel Cousin scored in each leg against Togo, Gabon missed out on the 2013 Africa Cup of Nations as it lost 3–2 on aggregate. A year later, Gabon played six qualifiers for the 2015 Africa Cup of Nations as it was drawn with Burkina Faso, Angola and Lesotho. Despite a stunning 1–1 result in Lesotho in qualifying, Gabon finished ahead of Burkina Faso to top the group as it qualified for the tournament with a game to spare in Angola. In January 2015, Gabon was drawn along with Burkina Faso, Congo and Equatorial Guinea. However, its 2–0 victory on the opening day of the tournament were all the points Gabon achieved during the tournament as it suffered a shocking exit in the group stage.

<doc id="1109293" wikidata="Q513043" url="?curid=1109293" title="Raymond Lemieux">
<text>Raymond Urgel Lemieux, CC, AOE, FRS (June 16, 1920 – July 22, 2000) was a Canadian organic chemist, who pioneered many discoveries in the field of chemistry, his first and most famous being the synthesis of sucrose. His contributions include the discovery of the anomeric effect and the development of general methodologies for the synthesis of saccharides still employed in the area of carbohydrate chemistry. He was a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and the Royal Society (England), and a recipient of the prestigious Albert Einstein World Award of Science and Wolf Prize in Chemistry.

==Life and career==
&quot;Dr. Raymond U. Lemieux&quot; was born in Lac La Biche, Alberta, Canada. His family moved to Edmonton, Alberta in 1926. He studied chemistry at the University of Alberta and received a BSc with Honours in Chemistry in 1943. He went on to study at McGill University, where he received his PhD in Organic Chemistry in 1946. He won a post-doctoral scholarship at Ohio State University, where Bristol Laboratories Inc. sponsored his research on the structure of streptomycin. He met his future wife, a doctoral student, at Ohio State and they were married in 1948.

In following years, he returned to Canada where he spent two years as an assistant professor at the University of Saskatchewan. Next he served as Senior Research Officer at the National Research Council&#x27;s Prairie Regional Laboratory in Saskatoon. In 1953 he and a fellow researcher, George Huber, were the first scientists to successfully synthesize sucrose. In 1954, he accepted the position of Dean in the Faculty of Pure and Applied Sciences at the University of Ottawa, where he established their Department of Chemistry. In 1961 he returned to the University of Alberta as a professor in the Chemistry Department and to serve as the chairman of the Organic Chemistry Division. He developed a method to make synthetic versions of oligosaccharides, which led to improved treatments for leukemia and hemophilia and the development of new antibiotics, blood reagents, and organ anti-rejection drugs.

While at the University of Alberta, he established a number of biochemical companies, including R&amp;L Molecular Research Ltd. in 1962, Raylo Chemicals Ltd. in 1966 (which purchased R&amp;L) and Chembiomed in 1977 (which has since been taken over by Synsorb Biotech of Calgary, Alberta.) Prof. Lemieux published an autobiography, entitled &quot;&quot;Explorations with Sugars: How Sweet It Was&quot;,&quot; in 1990.

Dr. Raymond Lemieux died of an aneurysm in 2000.

In 1999, the University of Alberta Faculty of Science and Strathcona County established the Strathcona County/R.U. Lemieux Chair in Carbohydrate Chemistry. In 2001, the University of Alberta renamed the building(s) housing the Department of Chemistry to the Gunning/Lemieux Chemistry Centre to acknowledge the contributions of Profs. Raymond Lemieux and Harry Gunning.

==Awards==

Dr. R.U. Lemieux received numerous awards and honours for his work in chemistry:

* Induction into the Royal Society of Canada (1954)
* C.S. Hudson Award of the American Chemical Society (1966)
* Became the first western Canadian to be elected a fellow of the Royal Society (England) (1967)

<text>The Gulon is a creature in Scandinavian legend, also known as a &quot;Jerff&quot; in Northern Sweden and &quot;Vielfraß&quot; in Germany. It resembles a hodgepodge of various animals, usually described as being the size and shape of a dog, with some cat-like features such as the head, ears, and claws. It also supposedly has a thick coat of shaggy brown fur and a tail resembling that of a fox.

The Gulon is notorious as a symbol of gluttony because of the strange eating habits it is supposed to have. It will make a kill and then gorge itself until it is swollen and unable to eat more, at which point it will find two trees and squeeze itself in between them, pushing the meat through its own body before returning to the kill and repeating the process.

It is probably a Wolverine based on the traits it shares with the animal native to arctic climates around the world, including Scandinavia.

<text>Nancy C. M. Hartsock (1943–2015) was a professor of Political Science and Women Studies (now Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies) at the University of Washington from 1984 to 2009.

== Personal life and education ==
Hartsock was born in 1943 in a Methodist lower-middle class family, in Ogden, Utah. She attended Wellesley College. While there, Hartsock was involved in the Wellesley Civil Rights Group. This group provided tutoring in Roxbury and Boston, Massachusetts, as well as working with the Boston NAACP.

After finishing college, Hartsock went to get her master&#x27;s degree from the University of Chicago. There, she got involved with a community organization group called The Woodlawn Organization, which was started by activist Saul Alinsky.

When Martin Luther King brought the Civil Rights movements north, Hartsock marched to help this movement. After this march, she then helped start a graduate student woman&#x27;s caucus in Political Science.

Hartsock received her Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Chicago in 1972. She was a practiced musician and prior to her dissertation, Hartsock built and played the harpsichord. Hartsock also expressed interest in equestrianism, food, travel and art.

== Career ==
Hartsock was a feminist philosopher. She was known for her work in feminist epistemology and standpoint theory, especially the 1983 essay &quot;The Feminist Standpoint&quot;, which also integrated Melanie Klein&#x27;s theories on psychoanalysis and the Oedipal crisis. Her standpoint theory derived from Marxism, which claims that the proletariat has a distinctive perspective on social relations and that only this perspective reveals the truth. She drew an analogy between the industrial labor of the proletariat and the domestic labor of women to show that women can also have a distinctive standpoint.

&quot;The Feminist Standpoint Revisited and Other Essays&quot; was then published in 1998.

Hartsock taught in the Political Science Department of the University of Michigan. After a 3 year period, she moved to Washington, D.C., and took a course at Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) on feminist theory in 1973. She then took part in the staff and was in the subscription department where she did writing and editing. Quest lasted for almost 10 years.

Once she left Quest, she taught Political Science at Johns Hopkins. There she also helped take part in the effort to bring Woman&#x27;s Studies to the University. Several years after, she moved to the University of Washington and learned that the Woman&#x27;s Studies at Johns Hopkins was now a course.

Later, she focused her attention on woman&#x27;s labor. Specifically, in the political economic dynamics of globalization. Hartsock then retired in 2009.

She served as President of the Western Political Science Association (1994–95), and was the Co-founder of the Center for Women &amp; Democracy in Seattle, WA, Founding Director (1999-2000).

== Death and legacy ==
In 1985, Hartsock was diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer and lived for 30 more years. Hartsock died on March 19, 2015, in Seattle, Washington.

Prior to her retirement in 2009 Hartsock established the Nancy C.M. Hartsock Prize for Best Graduate Paper in Feminist Theory. Students from any college, and from any department can apply.

<text>John J. Zogby (born September 3, 1948) is an American public opinion pollster, author, and public speaker. He is founder of the Zogby poll, and the Zogby International poll. Besides his profile in politics, he has also become a figure in popular culture, and he is the subject of a 2024 documentary, &quot;People, Not Numbers,&quot; based on his working principle, &quot;I poll people, not numbers.&quot;

== Early years and education ==
John Zogby was born on September 3, 1948, and grew up in Utica, New York, where he still lives. He is the son of Lebanese Catholic immigrants. His father, Joseph Rachid Zogby, was an immigrant from Lebanon who ran a successful Utica grocery store with his brothers. Immigration has always been an important part of Zogby&#x27;s personal approach to polling, and he noted his father&#x27;s immigration status in an op-ed, &quot;I am the son of an illegal immigrant. My father came here illegally from Lebanon, and my father is my heart.&quot; He dedicated &quot;Beyond the Horse Race&quot; to his mother, Salemi (Celia Ann) Zogby, who was born in Pennsylvania to Lebanese immigrant parents, and whom he remembered as &quot;An educator of two generations of Uticans, [who] shaped the lives of thousands of young people who passed through her classrooms.&quot; John Zogby graduated from Notre Dame Junior Senior High School, and received a bachelor&#x27;s degree in history from Le Moyne College in 1970 and a master&#x27;s degree in history from Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in 1974. He completed all coursework and exams for a doctorate in history at Syracuse (ABD) in 1974. In addition to teaching at SUNY Polytechnic, he taught history and political science at Mohawk Valley Community College, where he was commencement speaker in 2011, and later chaired its capital campaign. His brother, James Zogby, is the founder of the Arab American Institute, where John has served on the board. In 1981, before his polling career began, John Zogby ran for mayor of Utica, New York.

== Polling career ==
Zogby currently serves as a senior partner at John Zogby Strategies, a marketing and political consulting firm created in 2016 with two of his sons, Benjamin and Jeremy. He launched his first polling company, John Zogby Associates, in 1984, conducting mainly local polls for candidates, parties, and the media in northeastern US communities through the 1980s. He tells the story of being part of a broad layoff at an Arab-American anti-discrimination group, and launching his polling firm immediately thereafter because so many of the Arab Americans he had worked with needed him and were ready to hire him. In December 1991, polling for several radio and television stations in Upstate New York, he published a poll in New York State showing that then-president George H. W. Bush was leading the state&#x27;s governor Mario Cuomo by 6 points in that state. Governor Cuomo decided to not enter the 1992 presidential race the next day. By 1994, Zogby was polling the New York State gubernatorial race for the &quot;New York Post&quot; and WNYW-Fox 5. Zogby correctly called the winner, George Pataki, the only pollster to do so. Zogby&#x27;s company was hired by Reuters news agency to poll the 1996 presidential race. “All hail Zogby, the maverick predictor,” wrote Richard Morin, polling director at &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, when John Zogby was the only pollster who called the 1996 presidential election with near precision. Zogby achieved the same level of accuracy with his polling in the following two presidential elections.

== Books and publications ==
He is the author of four books: &quot;Beyond the Horse Race: How to Read Polls and Why We Should&quot; (Rowman &amp; Littlefield 2024), as well as &quot;The Way We&#x27;ll Be: The Zogby Report on the Transformation of the American Dream&quot; (Random House, 2008), and the &quot;First Globals: Understanding, Managing, and Unleashing Our Millennial Generation&quot; (with Joan Snyder Kuhl). &quot;We Are Many, We Are One: Neo-Tribes and Tribal Analytics in 21st Century America&quot;, emphasized a new paradigm for moving beyond demographics by allowing people who participated in the survey research to define themselves based on their attributes and values. The result is what Zogby describes as a bottom-up approach to segmentation analysis. He wrote the foreword to John Kenneth White&#x27;s book &quot;The Values Divide: American Politics and Culture in Transition&quot;. Additionally, Zogby writes periodic columns (previously weekly) on Forbes.com, and he contributes a weekly presidential report card for &quot;The Washington Examiner&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Washington Secrets,&quot; by Paul Bedard. He contributes regularly to &quot;The Guardian,&quot; and is also a founding contributor to The Huffington Post.

== Awards and advisory boards ==
A former trustee of Le Moyne College (2000–2009), Zogby received the Distinguished Alumni Award in June 2000. He was also the director of the Keenan Center for Entrepreneurship from 2016-2018. He has three honorary doctorates, from the State University of New York and the graduate school of Union University in 2005, and from the College of St. Rose in 2009, along with Jimmy Fallon. In 2008 he was awarded the Chancellor&#x27;s distinguished fellows award from the University of California Irvine. He has also received awards from the American Task Force for Lebanon. He has been named a New York State &quot;Living Legend&quot; by the Oneida County Historical Association, and has his name on the Mohawk Valley Welcome Center&#x27;s Walk of Fame.

Zogby was a former advisor at the Belfer Center of the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University. He was also a fellow of the Catholic University of America Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies. He served on the advisory council for biotechnology for the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), as a Commissioner on the CSIS Commission on Smart Power, for three years on its board of trustees, with board chair David Abshire, the CSIS founding chairman. He previously served on the congressionally created Advisory Group on Public Diplomacy for the Arab and Muslim World. Zogby is the former chairman of the educational organization Sudan Sunrise. He served on the boards of the Arab American Institute, and Upstate Venture Connect.

== In popular culture ==
John Zogby&#x27;s polls have been referenced in popular culture, including NBC&#x27;s &quot;The West Wing&quot;, CW&#x27;s &quot;Gossip Girl&quot;, the Netflix series &quot;House of Cards&quot;, Richard North Patterson&#x27;s novel &quot;The Race&quot;, the Simpsons, game shows such as the UK&#x27;s Cash Cab, and the 25th Anniversary edition of Trivial Pursuit. Zogby Polls have been cited on &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and parodied on &quot;The Late Show&quot; and NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot;. In 2004 and 2008, he was a guest on &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,&quot; an experience that he considered one of the highlights of his professional life. Political strategist Mary Matalin called him &quot;The Prince of Polling.&quot;

== Personal life ==
Although political polling could easily have drawn him to New York City or Washington, DC, he has always remained in his home town of Utica, which he sees as one key to his success in understanding American communities more broadly. His wife Kathleen is a retired special education teacher and children&#x27;s book author, &quot;Nonnie&#x27;s Lessons of Love, Hope, and Nature&quot; (2016).

<doc id="1109330" wikidata="Q5188444" url="?curid=1109330" title="Cross burning">
<text>In modern times, cross burning or cross lighting is a practice which is associated with the Ku Klux Klan. However, it was practiced long before the Klan&#x27;s inception. Since the early 20th century, the Klan has burned crosses on hillsides as a way to intimidate and threaten Black Americans and other marginalized groups.

==Scottish origins==

In Scotland, the fiery cross, known as the , was used as a declaration of war. The sight of it commanded all clan members to rally to the defence of the area. On other occasions, a small burning cross would be carried from town to town. It was used in the War of 1812 between Britain and the U.S. as a means of mobilizing the Scottish Fencibles and militia which were settled in Glengarry County, Ontario against the invaders. In 1820, over 800 fighting men of Clan Grant were gathered, by the passing of the fiery cross, to come to the aid of their Clan Chieftain and his sister in the town of Elgin, Scotland. In Scotland itself, the last significant use of the burning cross was made in 1745, during the Jacobite rising, and it was subsequently described in the novels and poetry of Sir Walter Scott, particularly &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; of 1810.

==Symbol of the Ku Klux Klan==

In the first era, Reconstruction Klans did not burn crosses. The belief that reconstruction Klans burned crosses was introduced by Thomas Dixon Jr., in his novel &quot;The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan&quot; (1905). A cross burning is first described in Book IV Chapter 2 &quot;The Fiery Cross&quot; on pages 324–326 of the 1905 edition. It is introduced by one of the characters as &quot;the old Scottish rite of the burning cross. It will send a thrill of inspiration to every clansmen in the hills.&quot; It is further elaborated that

In olden times when the Chieftain of our people summoned the clan on an errand of life and death, the Fiery Cross, extinguished in sacrificial blood, was sent by swift courier from village to village. This call was never made in vain, nor will it be to-night in the new world. Here, on this spot made holy ground by the blood of those we hold dearer than life, I raise the ancient symbol of an unconquered race of men—

This scene is accompanied by an unnumbered plate illustration by Arthur I. Keller, captioned &quot;&#x27;The fiery cross of old Scotland&#x27;s hills&#x27;&quot;, showing two robed, unmasked Klansmen, one of whom is holding a lighted cross, over a bound, blindfolded and gagged Black American, while robed and hooded klansmen look on. The novel ends with a Klansman waiting for election results stating &quot;Look at our lights on the mountains! They are ablaze - range on range our signals gleam until the Fiery Cross is lost among the stars&quot; meaning that he had won and civilization had been saved in the South. The fiery cross is mentioned once again in the final novel of Dixon&#x27;s Klan trilogy, &quot;The Traitor: A Story of the Fall of the Invisible Empire&quot;, when a Grand Dragon tosses a burning cross on a heap of discarded Klan robes and regalia in obedience to the order of the Grand Dragon to dissolve the order. This scene is accompanied by an illustration captioned &quot;Some of the men were sobbing&quot; by Charles David Williams featuring a gathering of Klansmen over a burning pile of robes, carrying three burning crosses.

==&quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;==

In D.W. Griffith&#x27;s film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (1915), an adaptation of Thomas Dixon&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Clansman&quot;, two sequences depict cross-burnings.

The first sequence depicts a Confederate colonel&#x27;s little sister, who rejects a marriage proposal by a Black captain (of the occupying Union force) and flees after he chases her (the Piedmont, South Carolina legislature had legalized interracial marriages, and the story imagines the social chaos that whites feared would develop). She is cornered at the edge of a cliff and threatens to jump off the cliff unless he stops. He continues his pursuit, and she jumps.

Her brother finds her dying at the bottom of the cliff and holds her in his arms; she identifies her attacker before she passes away. The few members of the local clan burn a small (around ) cross, drenched in the young girl&#x27;s blood. A kangaroo court is convened, hears the girl&#x27;s dying words when the colonel gives his testimony, finds the captain guilty of murder, and executes him. The clan members place his body on the front porch of the South Carolina governor&#x27;s mansion with a square piece of white sheeting with the initials KKK.

The second sequence depicts the aftermath of two home invasions. The first home invasion occurs at the governor&#x27;s mansion. A Black member of the South Carolina legislature proposes marriage to the governor&#x27;s daughter and, when she rejects his proposal, he threatens her with weapons. The governor attempts to intervene but his attempt fails and he is taken captive. The second home invasion occurs at the house of the Confederate colonel; his mother was revealed to be a clan sympathizer and she expressed her sympathy for the clan by making clan uniforms. The clan wishes to intervene in these hostage situations but it is prevented from doing so by the occupying Union troops. The colonel requests help by burning a cross in the daytime; the black smoke which is produced by the burning cross signals clans from neighboring counties to come to their aid and contest the Union military&#x27;s control of the town. Each clan wears distinct head-dresses and robes. They greet each other with their faces uncovered although they ride into town with sheeting over their faces. The colonel&#x27;s uniform has two adjacent square crosses on his robe, presumably from the original clan in Scotland.

In the United States, the first recorded cross burning occurred on November 25, 1915, ten months after the debut of &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, when a group of men which led by William J. Simmons burned a cross atop Stone Mountain, Georgia, inaugurating the revival of the Ku Klux Klan. The event was attended by 15 charter members and a few aging former members of the original Klan.

Crosses were burned during the Tallahassee bus boycott of 1956.

According to journalist and civil rights advocate Carey McWilliams, in California during the &#x27;30s, several crosses were burned as part of the intimidation practices of the vigilante groups which were organized to break off pickers&#x27; strikes by the Associated Farmers.

==In France==

&quot;Croix-de-Feu&quot; (, &quot;Cross of Fire&quot;) was a nationalist French league of the Interwar period.

==Legal position in the United States==
In 2003, the Supreme Court of the United States invoked a stage adaptation of Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s &quot;The Lady of the Lake&quot; in its &quot;Virginia v. Black&quot; decision as an example of a display of cross burning that was not intended &quot;to intimidate a person or group of persons&quot; when they struck down a Virginia statute that included the language &quot;Any such burning of a cross shall be &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence of an intent to intimidate a person or group of persons&quot; because it &quot;presumes&quot; that the &quot;intent [is] to intimidate.&quot;

<text>Father Rosario Stroscio (1922 in Sicily – 9 June 2019) was Roman Catholic Salesian priest and exorcist.

In 1997, Father Stroscio was called in by the Archbishop of Calcutta, Archbishop Henry Sebastian D&#x27;Souza to pray over the 87-year-old hospitalized Mother Teresa who had been hospitalized for heart problems. Mother Teresa was suffering from insomnia and acting strangely. The Archbishop said of the situation that, &quot;when doctors said they could not find a medical reason for her sleeplessness, I thought she might be getting attacked by the devil.&quot; After Father Stroscio prayed over her, she was calm and slept peacefully.

Some news outlets carried the story that Mother Teresa had undergone an exorcism, but the Archbishop later explained that although Father Stroscio used a prayer found in the rite of exorcism, &quot;I did not think she was possessed by an evil spirit,&quot; and so no formal exorcism took place.

<doc id="1109348" wikidata="Q1268452" url="?curid=1109348" title="National Security Study Memorandum 200">
<text>National Security Study Memorandum 200: Implications of Worldwide Population Growth for U.S. Security and Overseas Interests (NSSM200), also known as the &quot;Kissinger Report&quot;, was a national security directive completed on December 10, 1974 by the United States National Security Council under the direction of Henry Kissinger following initial orders from President of the United States Richard Nixon.

NSSM200 was reworked and adopted as official United States policy through NSDM 314 by President Gerald Ford on November 26, 1975. It was initially classified for over a decade and has been part of the public record since 1985. The memorandum and subsequent policies developed from the report were observed as a way the United States could encourage human population planning to slow down global population growth in rapidly growing populations of Lesser Developed Countries. The document describes US security interests in natural resource supplies as a motivator for assisting LDCs in curbing population growth rates. It contemplated that situations arising from scarcity of food and other economic preconditions for stable growth in LDCs could lead to political instability which could put in jeopardy supplies to industrialized countries of key minerals and other resources for their growth. 

== Background ==

Under the administration of President Richard Nixon during the Cold War, his government adopted an agenda of encouraging a reduction human population growth. Under the advice of major general William Henry Draper Jr., the US supported the creation of the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in order to establish a awareness of population growth and encourage family planning and use of contraception. The memo is explicit in its concern for being misconstrued as a form of imperialism. Some assert that the growth of future generations birthed throughout the world posed a danger to wealth accumulation, and wealthy individuals backed the US government policy of global population control in an effort to avoid blame. However, the NSSM200 addressed the alarming rates of population growth and not the threat of the populations nor to capitalism, per se. 

As a result, the NSSM200 was drafted primarily by Philander Claxton and drew attention to the idea that global population growth was of concern to long-term US economic and other global stability interests. The policy recommendations to address population growth was openly concerned with the potential appearance of &quot;economic imperialism&quot; and should be carefully approached so as &quot;not be seen ... as an industrialized country policy to keep their strength down or reserve resources for use by the rich countries&quot;, with a written goal of &quot;fertility reduction.&quot; Local organizers were introduced to how aggressive population growth strains local economy and resources and to &quot;emphasize development and improvements in the quality of life of the poor&quot;, later explaining such projects were for these and &quot;other reasons&quot;.

== Contents ==
The basic thesis of the memorandum was that population growth in the least developed countries (LDCs) is a concern to US national security, because excess population growth, growth that exceeded local food, water, housing, waste handling and other humanitarian concerns would first cause local suffering would tend to risk civil unrest and political instability in countries that otherwise had a high potential for economic development. The policy gives &quot;paramount importance&quot; to population growth planning measures and the promotion of contraception among 13 populous countries to stem rapid over population growth which the US projected to be inimical to the socio-political and economic growth of these countries, and to some national interests of the United States as the &quot;U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad.&quot; 

In summary, the NSSM200 provides four main observations:

# Population growth of LDCs if it outpaces economic development will likely create suffering and political instability, instability that may be inimical to US interests.
# The United States relies on many of these countries for many natural resources.
# High birth rates may result in growth in younger individuals who come to oppose established governments if economic conditions do not support livelihoods.
# American foreign businesses investments will become vulnerable to interference by foreign governments struggling to provide basic humanitarian support for rapidly growing populations.

It recommends that US leadership &quot;influence national leaders&quot; and that &quot;improved world-wide support for population-related efforts should be sought through increased emphasis on mass media and other population education and motivation programs by the UN, USIA, and USAID.&quot;

=== Named countries ===
Thirteen countries are named in the report as particularly high growth rates and simultaneously problematic economic and political conditions to support that growth, and with respect to US security interests: India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Turkey, Nigeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Mexico, Colombia, and Brazil. The countries were projected to create 47 percent of all world population growth.

=== General oversight ===
The paper takes a look at worldwide demographic population trends as projected in 1974.

It is well divided into two major sections: an analytical section and policy recommendations.

The policy recommendations is divided into two sections. A US population strategy and action to create conditions for decline in fertility growth. A major concern reiterated in the memo concerns the effect of population growth and economic development on famine and health.

&quot;Growing populations will have a serious impact on the need for food especially in the poorest, fastest growing LDCs.[least developed countries] While under normal weather conditions and assuming food production growth in line with recent trends, total world agricultural production could expand faster than population, there will nevertheless be serious problems in food distribution and financing, making shortages, even at today&#x27;s poor nutrition levels, probable in many of the larger more populous LDC regions. Even today 10 to 20 million people die each year due, directly or indirectly, to malnutrition. Even more serious is the consequence of major crop failures which are likely to occur from time to time.

&quot;The most serious consequence for the short and middle term is the possibility of massive famines in certain parts of the world, especially the poorest regions. World needs for food rise by 2.5 percent or more per year (making a modest allowance for improved diets and nutrition) at a time when readily available fertilizer and well-watered land is already largely being utilized. Therefore, additions to food production must come mainly from higher yields.

&quot;Countries with large population growth cannot afford constantly growing imports, but for them to raise food output steadily by 2 to 4 percent over the next generation or two is a formidable challenge.&quot;

=== Key insights ===
*&quot;The U.S. economy will require large and increasing amounts of minerals from abroad, especially from less developed countries [see National Commission on Materials Policy, Towards a National Materials Policy: Basic Data and Issues, April 1972]. That fact gives the U.S. enhanced interest in the political, economic, and social stability of the supplying countries. Wherever a lessening of population pressures through reduced birth rates can increase the prospects for such stability, population policy becomes relevant to resource supplies and to the economic interests of the United States... The location of known reserves of higher grade ores of most minerals favors increasing dependence of all industrialized regions on imports from less developed countries. The real problems of mineral supplies lie, not in basic physical sufficiency, but in the politico-economic issues of access, terms for exploration and exploitation, and division of the benefits among producers, consumers, and host country governments&quot; [Chapter III, &quot;Minerals and Fuel&quot;].
*&quot;Whether through government action, labor conflicts, sabotage, or civil disturbance, the smooth flow of needed materials will be jeopardized. Although population pressure is obviously not the only factor involved, these types of frustrations are much less likely under conditions of slow or zero population growth&quot; [Chapter III, &quot;Minerals and Fuel&quot;].
*&quot;Populations with a high proportion of growth. The young people, who are in much higher proportions in many LDCs, are likely to be more volatile, unstable, prone to extremes, alienation and violence than an older population. These young people can more readily be persuaded to attack the legal institutions of the government or real property of the &#x27;establishment,&#x27; &#x27;imperialists,&#x27; multinational corporations, or other -- often foreign -- influences blamed for their troubles&quot; [Chapter V, &quot;Implications of Population Pressures for National Security&quot;].
*&quot;We must take care that our activities should not give the appearance to the LDCs of an industrialized country policy directed against the LDCs. Caution must be taken that in any approaches in this field we support in the LDCs are ones we can support within this country. &quot;Third World&quot; leaders should be in the forefront and obtain the credit for successful programs. In this context it is important to demonstrate to LDC leaders that such family planning programs have worked and can work within a reasonable period of time.&quot; [Chapter I, &quot;World Demographic Trends&quot;]
*&quot;In these sensitive relations, however, it is important in style as well as substance to avoid the appearance of coercion.&quot;
*Abortion as a geopolitical strategy is mentioned several dozen times in the report with suggestive implications: &quot;No country has reduced its population growth without resorting to abortion... under developing country controception and foresight methods not only are frequently unavailable but often fail because of ignorance, lack of preparation, misuse and non-use. Because of these latter conditions, increasing numbers of women in the developing world have been resorting to abortion...
*Population control and population reduction tactics.

== Effects ==
Marshall Green was named Coordinator of Population Affairs on December 3, 1975. Days later on December 15, 1975, US ambassadors were informed to assist in implementation of the policies of NSDM 314 and to participate in the assessment of population growth concerns in their host nations. The policies adopted from NSSM200 and NSDM 314 developed even further in 1976 after the National Security Council advocated for the use of withholding food aid to encourage adoption of family planning approaches to prevent high population growth, with a memorandum reading; &quot;In some cases, strong direction has involved incentives such as payment to acceptors for sterilization, or disincentives such as giving low priorities in the allocation of housing or schooling to those with larger families. Such direction is the &quot;sine qua non&quot; of an effective program&quot;. This resulted in proposing to foreign nations the creation of aid-for-sterlization, housing-encouraged by sterilzation projects, or schooling aid connected to population planning[1] while also calling for: &quot;..a development strategy which emphasizes the rural poor, who are the largest and poorest group in most LDCs would be providing income increases to those with the highest fertility levels. No LDC is likely to achieve population stability unless the rural poor participate in income increases and fertility declines.&quot; 

The Economic Warfare School (EGE) said that the memorandum resulted with the United States using population control policies as a weapon of economic warfare against Nigeria by utilizing social blackmail to force sterilizations and utilizing food power as a means of mitigating population growth. The EGE alleges that Nigeria went from approaching potential nuclear capability to a less-developed country, with the United States being able to establish control of Nigeria&#x27;s resources and maintain the interests of Americans businesses there.

According to the Subcommittee of Inquiry of Voluntary Surgical Contraception of the Congress of the Republic of Peru in June 2002, NSSM200 was &quot;the global strategy defined for the last quarter of the last century by the United States government in order to obtain a decrease in the birth [growth] rate&quot; and was responsible for the involvement of the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) in forced sterilizations in Peru.

<text>Walther Gerlach (1 August 1889 – 10 August 1979) was a German physicist who co-discovered, through laboratory experiment, spin quantization in a magnetic field, the Stern–Gerlach effect. The experiment was conceived by Otto Stern in 1921 and successfully conducted first by Gerlach in early 1922.

== Education ==
Gerlach was born in Biebrich, Hessen-Nassau, German Empire, as son of Dr. med. Valentin Gerlach and his wife Marie Niederhaeuser.

He studied at the University of Tübingen from 1908, and received his doctorate in 1912, under Friedrich Paschen. The subject of his dissertation was on the measurement of radiation. After obtaining his doctorate, he continued on as an assistant to Paschen, which he had been since 1911. Gerlach completed his Habilitation at Tübingen in 1916, while serving during World War I.

== Career ==
From 1915 to 1918, during the war, Gerlach did service with the German Army. He worked on wireless telegraphy at Jena under Max Wien. He also served in the Artillerie-Prüfungskommission under Rudolf Ladenburg.

Gerlach became a Privatdozent at the University of Tübingen in 1916. A year later, he became a Privatdozent at the University of Göttingen. From 1919 to 1920, he was the head of a physics laboratory of Farbenfabriken Elberfeld, later Bayer-Werke A.G.

In 1921, he became a.o. (extraordinary) professor at the Goethe University Frankfurt. It was before 17. Feb. 1922 that Gerlach succeeded with the experiment on spin quantization in a magnetic field (&quot;Richtungsquantelung&quot;), which is commonly called the Stern–Gerlach experiment, having originally been proposed by Otto Stern and also making use of molecular beam methods developed by Stern. The experiment itself was carried out only by Gerlach, Stern by that time having left for a professorship in Rostock, in Frankfurt some time before 17. Feb 1922. On this day the &quot;critical theorist&quot; Wolfgang Pauli sent Gerlach a postcard with congratulations and the remark &quot;Jetzt wird hoffentlich auch der ungläubige Stern von der Richtungsquantelung überzeugt sein&quot; (&quot;Hopefully the disbelieving Stern will now be convinced of the spin-theory&quot;). The results were published jointly by Gerlach and Stern in 1922.

In 1925, Gerlach took a call and became an ordinarius professor at the University of Tübingen, successor to Friedrich Paschen. In 1929, he took a call and became ordinarius professor at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, successor to Wilhelm Wien. He held this position until May 1945, when he was arrested by the American and British Armed Forces.

From 1937 until 1945, Gerlach was a member of the supervisory board of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Gesellschaft (KWG). After 1946, he continued to be an influential official in its successor organization after World War II, the Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (MPG).

On 1 January 1944, Gerlach officially became head of the physics section of the Reichsforschungsrat (RFR, Reich Research Council) and Bevollmächtigter (plenipotentiary) of nuclear physics, replacing Abraham Esau. In April of that year, he founded the &quot;Reichsberichte für Physik&quot;, which were official reports appearing as supplements to the &quot;Physikalische Zeitschrift&quot;.

From May 1945, Gerlach was interned in France and Belgium by British and American Armed Forces under Operation Alsos. From July of that year to January 1946, he was interned in England at Farm Hall under Operation Epsilon, which interned 10 German scientists who were thought to have participated in the development of atomic weapons.

Upon Gerlach&#x27;s return to Germany in 1946, he became a visiting professor at the University of Bonn. From 1948, he became an ordinarius professor of experimental physics and director of the physics department at the University of Munich, a position he held until 1957. He was also rector of the university from 1948 to 1951.

From 1949 to 1951, Gerlach was the founding president of the Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, which promotes applied sciences. From 1949 to 1961, he was the vice-president of the Deutsche Gemeinschaft zur Erhaltung und Förderung der Forschung (German Association for the Support and Advancement of Scientific Research); also known in short as the Deutsche Forschungs-Gemeinschaft (DFG), previously the Notgemeinschaft der Deutschen Wissenschaft.

In 1957, Gerlach was a co-signer of the Göttingen Manifesto, which was against rearming the Federal Republic of Germany with atomic weapons.

<doc id="1109366" wikidata="Q132026" url="?curid=1109366" title="David O'Leary">
<text>David Anthony O&#x27;Leary (born 2 May 1958) is a football manager and former player. The majority of his 20-year playing career was spent as a central defender at Arsenal, where his tally of 722 appearances stands as a club record. He played 68 times for the Republic of Ireland from 1976 to 1993, and was part of the squad that reached the quarter-finals of the 1990 FIFA World Cup.

O&#x27;Leary retired as a player after two years at Leeds United, and began managing the club in 1998. He built a team of young talents, and reached the semi-finals of the UEFA Champions League in 2000–01 before being dismissed the following year. He also managed Aston Villa for three Premier League seasons and had one year in charge of Al Ahli Dubai.

==Club career==
O&#x27;Leary was born in Stoke Newington, London, on 2 May 1958, and moved to live in Dublin in 1961.

===Arsenal===
O&#x27;Leary had two weeks on trial at Manchester United before signing for Arsenal as an apprentice in 1973. He made his debut against Burnley on 16 August 1975 in a 3–3 draw, and despite being only 17, went on to make 30 appearances that season. The following year, he signed a professional contract. For the next 10 years, he played more than 40 matches a season (except for 1980–81, when he was out with a ankle injury and only played 27).

A calm and collected central defender, O&#x27;Leary was noted for his good positioning and elegant style of play. He won his first major honour with Arsenal when he played in their 3–2 win over Manchester United in the 1979 FA Cup final. He also played in the 1978 and 1980 Cup finals, and the 1980 European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup final, all of which Arsenal lost. In 1982, O&#x27;Leary became club captain but relinquished it to Graham Rix 18 months later.

In 1981, O&#x27;Leary rejected a move to Manchester United and signed a four-year extension at Arsenal. He missed the loss to Luton Town in the 1988 Football League Cup final due to an Achilles tendon rupture. O&#x27;Leary broke numerous appearance records at Arsenal; he was the youngest person to reach the 100- and 200-match milestones, and he made his 400th appearance while still only 26. He passed George Armstrong&#x27;s all-time record of 621 first-team games in November 1989. By this time, O&#x27;Leary was no longer automatic first choice (with the partnership of Tony Adams and Steve Bould at the centre of George Graham&#x27;s defence), but he still turned in over 20 appearances as Arsenal won the 1988–89 First Division title due to a 2–0 win at Anfield on the final day of the season.

O&#x27;Leary won another league title in 1991 and an FA Cup and League Cup double in 1993, though by this time he was mainly used as a substitute. He holds Arsenal&#x27;s all-time record for appearances, with 722 first-team games, in a 20-year-long association with the club. In a poll to compile the list of the club&#x27;s greatest-ever players, O&#x27;Leary was voted 14th. O&#x27;Leary assumes the role of a club ambassador for Arsenal.

===Leeds United===
O&#x27;Leary joined Leeds on a free transfer in 1993 after 19 years at Highbury. He retired due to another Achilles injury in 1995, after only 12 appearances. O&#x27;Leary was never sent off in a professional match.

==International career==
O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s international debut with the Republic of Ireland came as a teenager in a 1–1 friendly draw with England on 8 September 1976. Following the appointment of Jack Charlton, O&#x27;Leary was frozen out of the international setup for two years. After being left out of a squad for a mini tournament in Iceland in May 1986, O&#x27;Leary booked a family holiday, which he decided not to cancel when he was eventually asked up to the squad following several withdrawals. O&#x27;Leary did not feature until November 1988, thus missing out on Euro 88.

The highlight of his 68-cap international career came in the 1990 World Cup. With Ireland in a penalty shootout with Romania, Packie Bonner saved Daniel Timofte&#x27;s last penalty. O&#x27;Leary then stepped up to take the decisive final penalty to win the shootout 5–4 to take Ireland to the quarterfinals. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s strike has since been voted as the greatest moment in Irish footballing history.

On 17 October 1990, O&#x27;Leary scored his only goal for the Republic of Ireland in a 5–0 win over Turkey in a Euro 92 qualifier. O&#x27;Leary was captain in his final international game on 17 February 1993, but was injured in the opening minutes of the 2–1 friendly win over Wales at Tolka Park.

==Managerial career==
===Leeds United===
When the former Arsenal manager George Graham was put in charge at Leeds United in September 1996, O&#x27;Leary was installed as his assistant. He remained in this position for two years.

On 29 September 1998, in Graham&#x27;s last match as manager, O&#x27;Leary was sent off for arguing with match officials in a UEFA Cup first-round game away to C.S. Marítimo, which Leeds won on penalties. Graham left for Tottenham Hotspur, and on O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s debut as caretaker on 3 October, Leeds lost 1–0 at home to Leicester City, managed by Martin O&#x27;Neill who was linked with the Leeds job. After a goalless draw with Chelsea at Elland Road on 25 October, chairman Peter Ridsdale gave the job permanently to O&#x27;Leary on a 2-year deal for a salary of £600,000, then one of the highest salaries for managers in England.

At the end of the 1998–99 season, Leeds finished fourth in the Premier League and qualified for the UEFA Cup. Their 1999-2000 UEFA Cup campaign ended in the semifinal with defeat to the Turkish side Galatasaray, following the murders of two Leeds fans during violence the night before.
On the domestic front, Leeds finished third in the Premier League and qualified for the Champions League. It was their first campaign at this level since the 1992–93 season. In August 2000, O&#x27;Leary signed a six-year contract, for which he would earn £10 million.

Leeds reached the semifinals of the Champions League in 2000-01, where they lost to eventual runners-up Valencia. Their Premier League form also dipped slightly and O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s men had to settle for a UEFA Cup place, finishing fourth in the last season before the Champions League qualification spots for the English Premiership expanded from the top three to the top four. Although there was little indication of this at the time, this was a serious failure for the club because Ridsdale had borrowed £60 million against future gate receipts, budgeting for prolonged Champions League involvement.

The 2001–02 season began well for Leeds. They frequently topped the table during the first half of the season and were Premier League leaders on 1 January 2002, but a loss of form in the second half of the season had them slump into fifth place, again just outside the Champions League qualification spots, meaning that they would again have to settle for a UEFA Cup place.

Leeds players Jonathan Woodgate and Lee Bowyer were charged in an incident in Leeds city centre in January 2000, in which a man was beaten in what he believed was a racially motivated attack. In December 2001, Woodgate was convicted of affray and received 100 hours of community service, while Bowyer was acquitted. In January 2002, O&#x27;Leary wrote a book, &quot;Leeds United on Trial&quot;. In it, he revealed that the club hired private investigators in the Bowyer and Woodgate affair, and said that he felt the police wanted to &quot;put one over the club&quot;; he also criticised The Football Association for freezing the pair out of England squads until the end of the trial. He also alleged that Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink refused to play unless he could be the highest-paid player at the club.

By June 2002, O&#x27;Leary had spent almost £100 million on new players in less than four years for no reward in terms of trophies, but he had never finished outside the top five as a manager. Ridsdale sacked O&#x27;Leary as Leeds manager in the summer of 2002, replacing him with Terry Venables. O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s departure signalled a downhill spiral for the club – highly attributable to the financial state that saw the sale of several key players, which saw three more managers (Venables, Peter Reid, and Eddie Gray) come and go before the club was finally relegated from the Premier League in 2004 with £80 million debt, and fell into League One (the third tier of the league) three years later. This fall from grace led to the phrase &quot;doing a Leeds&quot;.

O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s fame at Leeds rests upon his promotion of a series of younger players such as Woodgate, Bowyer, Alan Smith, Harry Kewell, Stephen McPhail, Eirik Bakke, Ian Harte, and Danny Mills (signed for £4 million from Charlton Athletic). He promoted several members of the youth team into an exciting Leeds side that played a pressing game relying on youthful enthusiasm. In an interview regarding the decline of Leeds, O&#x27;Leary stated, &quot;I never wanted to leave Leeds. The fans are fantastic to me here. I hope they stay up because I had great times at the club.&quot;

O&#x27;Leary was fired with two years remaining of his contract and sued for compensation as the club claimed he had left by mutual consent. He settled with the club for £2 million and legal costs in February 2003.

===Aston Villa===
After settling his case with Leeds, O&#x27;Leary was linked with Sunderland who had sacked Howard Wilkinson in March 2003. On 21 May, he signed a three-year deal at Aston Villa, who had finished 16th under Graham Taylor. O&#x27;Leary targeted 6th place within two years. His first game on 16 August was a 2–1 loss at newly promoted Portsmouth; &quot;The Guardian&quot; journalist Russell Thomas wrote &quot;Punters who have already wagered on Portsmouth going down might now consider covering themselves by entering Aston Villa into the equation&quot;.

In January 2004, O&#x27;Leary criticised chairman Doug Ellis for a lack of funding for transfers, as Villa had let go of 13 players while only signing Sunderland duo Thomas Sørensen and Gavin McCann for a combined £4.5 million; forward Dion Dublin had been playing in central defence. The team finished in sixth place – one place too low for European qualification due to Millwall&#x27;s FA Cup final appearance and Middlesbrough&#x27;s League Cup triumph.

O&#x27;Leary signed AC Milan&#x27;s international defender Martin Laursen, Carlton Cole from Chelsea, and French midfielder Mathieu Berson ahead of the 2004–05 season, in which Villa finished 10th in the league. Despite six summer acquisitions including strikers Milan Baroš and Kevin Phillips, Villa finished 16th in 2005–06, just two places above the relegation zone. Following the relegation of local rivals Birmingham City and Bromwich Albion, Villa were the only Midlands side playing Premier League football in 2006–07.

On 19 July 2006, O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s contract as Aston Villa manager was terminated by mutual consent, after an investigation into a statement against Ellis allegedly given by the squad. Ellis sold the club within a few days to Randy Lerner, and Martin O&#x27;Neill was appointed as manager.

===Al-Ahli===
O&#x27;Leary returned to management on 4 July 2010 with United Arab Emirates club Al-Ahli Dubai, where World Cup-winning Italy captain Fabio Cannavaro was signed and made skipper.

On 2 April 2011, O&#x27;Leary was relieved of his duties following a 5-1 defeat at the hands of Al Jazira. On 22 April 2011, Al-Ahli officially announced its decision to sack O&#x27;Leary with his assistant coach Roy Aitken. When he was sacked, O&#x27;Leary had two years remaining on a three-year contract. In March 2012, he asked FIFA for help in getting compensation from Al-Ahli for the early termination of his contract. In May 2013, he won $5.2 million (£3.34 million) compensation. The dispute was settled by FIFA&#x27;s players&#x27; status committee. Al-Ahli claimed O&#x27;Leary had abandoned his post, despite previously stating he had been dismissed. O&#x27;Leary had won six of his 15 league games in charge.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s father was an avid Arsenal supporter who had left Ireland to work in London as a contractor, and was later proud that his son chose Arsenal instead of Manchester United, who had also offered him terms to sign for them. O&#x27;Leary is a UK resident according to current UK Companies House documents, and maintains links to Yorkshire. He has been married to wife Joy for more than forty years. In 2002 she was the subject of hate mail during a failed CPS prosecution of two Leeds football players. The couple have two children together.

O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s brother, Pierce, played for Shamrock Rovers and Celtic, and was capped seven times for the Republic of Ireland. His nephew, Ryan, declined to play for the Republic of Ireland Under-21s, choosing to play for Scotland, the country of his birth.

O&#x27;Leary endorsed a Game Boy Color game called &quot;O&#x27;Leary Manager 2000&quot;, which was released by Ubi Soft in 2000.

O&#x27;Leary was involved in a complex tax avoidance scheme, &quot;O&#x27;Leary v. McKinlay (Inspector of Taxes)&quot;, that was struck down in the Chancery Court in December 1990. The scheme involved the loan of £266,000 () by Arsenal, O&#x27;Leary&#x27;s club, to trustees in Jersey, where it was held for his benefit.

<text>The Party of Bible-abiding Christians (, PBC) was a conservative evangelical minor right-wing political party in Germany. It was founded in 1989 during a convent of the Federation of Pentecostal Churches to serve as political arm of the Christian right in Germany. It was against same-sex marriage and legality of abortion. It supported a reference to God in the European Constitution and it strongly supported Israel. In March 2015, the PBC merged with the Party for Labour, Environment and Family (AUF) into the Alliance C – Christians for Germany.

Most members were from Württemberg or Saxony and were members or sympathizers of what Germans call &quot;Freikirche&quot; (Free Church), i.e., Protestants from Pentecostal and Charismatic sects, which are not affiliated with the large Lutheran Protestant Church in Germany.

The party&#x27;s success, however, was very limited on the federal and state levels of government because it never reached the &quot;5% hurdle&quot; of votes cast necessary to get into the parliaments in Germany&#x27;s system of proportional representation. In the last federal election the PBC participated (2013), the party achieved 0.0 percent of votes.

By contrast, the conservative Christian Democratic Union and Christian Social Union in Bavaria are powerful political forces in Germany (based on the number of votes and offices held). They differ greatly from the former PBC though in accepting secularization and being traditionally close to the Protestant Church in Germany and the Roman Catholic Church.

The party was a member of the European Christian Political Movement (EPCM).

<doc id="1109384" wikidata="Q826533" url="?curid=1109384" title="Soxhlet extractor">
<text>A Soxhlet extractor is a piece of laboratory apparatus invented in 1879 by Franz von Soxhlet. It was originally designed for the extraction of a lipid from a solid material. Typically, Soxhlet extraction is used when the desired compound has a &quot;limited&quot; solubility in a solvent, and the impurity is insoluble in that solvent. It allows for unmonitored and unmanaged operation while efficiently recycling a small amount of solvent to dissolve a larger amount of material.

==Description==
A Soxhlet extractor has three main sections: a percolator (boiler and reflux) which circulates the solvent, a thimble (usually made of thick filter paper) which retains the solid to be extracted, and a siphon mechanism, which periodically empties the condensed solvent from the thimble back into the percolator.

==Assembly==

* The source material containing the compound to be extracted is placed inside the thimble.

* The thimble is loaded into the main chamber of the Soxhlet extractor.
* The extraction solvent to be used is placed in a distillation flask.
* The flask is placed on the heating element.
* The Soxhlet extractor is placed atop the flask.
* A reflux condenser is placed atop the extractor.

==Operation==
The solvent is heated to reflux. The solvent vapour travels up a distillation arm, and floods into the chamber housing the thimble of solid. The condenser ensures that any solvent vapour cools, and drips back down into the chamber housing the solid material. The chamber containing the solid material slowly fills with warm solvent. Some of the desired compound dissolves in the warm solvent. When the Soxhlet chamber is almost full, the chamber is emptied by the siphon. The solvent is returned to the distillation flask. The thimble ensures that the rapid motion of the solvent does not transport any solid material to the still pot. This cycle may be allowed to repeat many times, over hours or days.

During each cycle, a portion of the non-volatile compound dissolves in the solvent. After many cycles the desired compound is concentrated in the distillation flask. The advantage of this system is that instead of many portions of warm solvent being passed through the sample, just one batch of solvent is recycled.

After extraction the solvent is removed, typically by means of a rotary evaporator, yielding the extracted compound. The non-soluble portion of the extracted solid remains in the thimble, and is usually discarded.
Like Soxhlet extractor, the Kumagawa extractor has a specific design where the thimble holder/chamber is directly suspended inside the solvent flask (having a vertical large opening) above the boiling solvent. The thimble is surrounded by hot solvent vapour and maintained at a higher temperature compared to the Soxhlet extractor, thus allowing better extraction for compounds with higher melting points such as bitumen. The removable holder/chamber is fitted with a small siphon side arm and, in the same way as for Soxhlet, a vertical condenser ensures that the solvent drips back down into the chamber which is automatically emptied at every cycle.

==History==
William B. Jensen notes that the earliest example of a continuous extractor is archaeological evidence for a Mesopotamian hot-water extractor for organic matter dating from approximately 3500 BC. The same mechanism is present in the Pythagorean cup. Before Soxhlet, the French chemist Anselme Payen also pioneered with continuous extraction in the 1830s.

A Soxhlet apparatus has been proposed as an effective technique for washing mass standards.

<text>The Meritorious Service Medal (MSM) is a military award presented to members of the United States Armed Forces who distinguish themselves with outstanding meritorious achievement or service to the United States. 

Introduced in 1969, the MSM was long awarded as a decoration for peacetime achievement. Since 2004, it has also been bestowed in lieu of the Bronze Star Medal for meritorious achievement in a designated combat theater. Normally, the acts or services rendered must be comparable to that required for the Legion of Merit but in a duty of lesser, though considerable, responsibility.

A higher award and decoration, the Defense Meritorious Service Medal (DMSM), is intended for similar services performed under joint duty within the United States Department of Defense, including the Joint Staff, the Unified Combatant Commands, and joint task forces under their cognizance.

==Recipients==
The Meritorious Service Medal is given to all ranks for meritorious service in the U.S. Army, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Coast Guard, and U.S. Space Force. It may be awarded for meritorious performance while serving in a staff position as a field grade officer, senior chief warrant officer, or senior non-commissioned officer, or, in the case of field grade officers, for successful completion of a command tour at the battalion (Army) or squadron (Army, Air Force, or Space Force) level. It is rarely awarded to officers in pay grades O-1 through O-3 (second lieutenant, first lieutenant, captain), junior warrant officers and chief warrant officers in pay grades W-1 and W-2 (WO1 and CW2, Army only), and junior NCOs in pay grades E-6 and below.

Within the U.S. Army, according to AR 600-8-22, Paragraph 3-17, the MSM may not be upgraded to or downgraded from a recommended Bronze Star Medal. In the Army, an MSM recommendation that is downgraded will be approved as an Army Commendation Medal (ARCOM).

The U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Coast Guard subscribe to a slightly different philosophy from the Army, Air Force, and Space Force in awarding the MSM, typically reserving it for senior Navy and Coast Guard officers in pay grades O-5 to O-6 (commander and captain) and Marine Corps field grade officers in pay grades O-5 and O-6 (lieutenant colonel and colonel), with the first award of the MSM typically occurring after completion of a successful commanding officer assignment at the O-5 level. Award of the MSM to USN, USMC, and USCG officers in pay grade O-4 (USN &amp; USCG lieutenant commander / USMC major) and below, including chief warrant officers and below (other than as an award at retirement to CWO5 and CWO4) is typically by exception and normally limited to those who have held one of the service&#x27;s handful of O-4 level commanding officer assignments (e.g., Avenger-class mine countermeasures ship) or serving on a USN or USCG flag officer staff or USMC general officer staff. 
For enlisted ranks, the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard typically limit the award of the MSM to pay grades E-8 (e.g., USN/USCG senior chief petty officer and USMC master sergeant or first sergeant) and E-9 (e.g., USN/USCG master chief petty officer and USMC sergeant major or master gunnery sergeant). Awarding the MSM to pay grade E-7 (e.g., USN/USCG chief petty officer and USMC gunnery sergeant) and below is very rare and by exception. In the Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, the awarding authority for the MSM must be either a flag officer or general officer holding the pay grade of O-7 or above. It is most common for Navy and Coast Guard master chief petty officers (typically command master chief petty officers) and Marine Corps master gunnery sergeants and sergeants major to receive the MSM as an end-of-tour award or upon retirement.

Foreign military personnel in the ranks of NATO OF-5 (US O-6 equivalent) and below and people who have displayed a level of service that warrants an award of such magnitude may also be eligible to be awarded the MSM, if approved by a U.S. flag officer or general officer. To receive this medal, the individual must exhibit exceptionally meritorious service at that level of responsibility.

=== Notable recipients ===
*Allison Black; U.S. Air Force officer
*Tulsi Gabbard; Member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Hawaii&#x27;s 2nd District

==Design and devices==
The Meritorious Service Medal is a bronze medal, 1.5 inches in diameter overall, consisting of six rays issuant from the upper three points of a five-pointed star with beveled edges and containing two smaller stars defined by incised outlines; in front of the lower part of the star an eagle with wings upraised standing upon two upward curving branches of laurel tied with a ribbon between the feet of the eagle. The reverse has the encircled inscriptions &quot;UNITED STATES OF AMERICA&quot; and &quot;MERITORIOUS SERVICE&quot;. The suspension ribbon is 1 3/8 inches wide and consists of the following stripes: 1/8 inch Crimson 67112; 1/4 inch White 67101; center 5/8 inch Crimson; 1/4 inch White; and 1/8 inch Crimson.

The medal was designed by Jay Morris of the Institute of Heraldry, and the design was approved on March 20, 1969, by the medal committee appointed by the defense secretary. The ribbon design follows the colors used for the Legion of Merit to reflect the parallel between the two medals. The eagle, symbol of the United States, stands on laurel branches denoting achievement. The star is used to represent the military service and the rays emanating therefrom denote the constant efforts of individuals to achieve through excellent and meritorious service.

Additional awards of the Meritorious Service Medal are denoted by bronze oak leaf clusters in the Army, Air Force, and Space Force, with one silver oak leaf cluster denoting five additional awards. (1 silver OLC plus the medal itself represents six) and gold 5/16 inch stars in the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and U.S. Coast Guard (with a 5/16 inch silver star denoting five additional awards). These devices are also authorized for wear on the suspension and service ribbon of the medal. In certain instances, the U.S. Coast Guard also authorizes an Operational Distinguishing Device for the medal.

==History==
At the Tri-Department Awards Conference (February 5, 1968), there was a discussion about the need for a third meritorious award to provide appropriate recognition for non-combat achievement or service comparable to that of the Bronze Star Medal for combat achievement or service. It was felt that the Legion of Merit&#x27;s prestige was slipping because it was being used with increasing frequency to reward service below the Legion of Merit&#x27;s intended standard, but higher than that required for the Commendation Medals of the various military services.

An &quot;ad hoc&quot; committee was formed by the Secretary of Defense (M&amp;RA) to select a name. On November 8, 1968, the committee unanimously approved the name &quot;Meritorious Service Medal&quot;. President Lyndon B. Johnson established the MSM in , dated January 16, 1969. The Executive Order was amended by President Ronald Reagan per , dated July 2, 1981, to authorize the award for members of the armed forces of friendly foreign nations. 

Until 2003, the MSM could only be awarded for peacetime service and could not be awarded in a combat zone; the MSM equivalent for those zones was the Bronze Star Medal (BSM). As in 1968 when the MSM was created, there were concerns that the prestige of the BSM was also slipping during combat operations in Southwest Asia that had essentially been continuous since 1990. In 2003, authority to award the MSM for combat zone service was authorized, retroactive to September 11, 2001.

<text>The Meritorious Service Decorations () are Canadian decorations awarded to those who have demonstrated an outstanding level of service or set an exemplary standard of achievement to benefit or honour Canada. The decorations are available in two forms as the Meritorious Service Cross (Fr.: &quot;Croix du service méritoire&quot;) and the Meritorious Service Medal (Fr.: &quot;Médaille du service méritoire&quot;). The decoration, awarded to both Canadians and non-Canadians and available in both military and civilian divisions, is awarded by the reigning ) and presented on behalf by the Governor General.

The military version of the Meritorious Service Cross was created in 1984. In 1991, the Meritorious Service Medal was added to the military division, and the civilian division was created for both the cross and medal.

The military division recognizes individuals for bringing honour to the Canadian Forces (CF). The civilian division recognizes contributions that bring benefit or honour to Canada in any field or improve the quality of life of a community, from athletics to diplomatic relations to humanitarian activities, setting an example for others to follow. Meritorious Service Decorations recognize the performance of a military deed or military activity in an outstandingly professional manner of such a rare, high standard that it brings considerable benefit to or reflects great credit on the CF.

<text>USS &quot;Balao&quot; (SS/AGSS-285) was the lead ship of the United States Navy&#x27;s s during World War II and named for the balao, a small schooling marine fish.

==Construction and commissioning==
&quot;Balao&quot;″s keel was laid down on 26 June 1942 at the Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine. She was launched on 27 October 1942, sponsored by Mrs. Jane Aylward, wife of Lieutenant Commander Theodore C. Aylward, commissioned on 4 February 1943 and reported to the United States Pacific Fleet.

== World War II ==
After a six-week training period in New London, Conn., the submarine sailed for the Pacific Theater of Operations and joined the 7th Fleet at Brisbane, Australia, on 10 July 1943.

=== First patrol, July – September 1943 ===
At the end of a brief refit alongside submarine tender , &quot;Balao&quot; got underway on 25 July to begin her first war patrol. She topped off her fuel tanks from submarine rescue vessel on 29 July, and on 7 August took station in the scouting line in the sealanes between Truk and the Bismarck Archipelago. However, she made only five enemy contacts and was unable to launch a single attack. The scouting line was discontinued on 26 August, and &quot;Balao&quot; shifted to patrol the Palau–Rabaul shipping route where she fared no better. The submarine trained in emergency dives, and her crew frequently went to battle stations upon the sighting of enemy aircraft; but the patrol was not enlivened by action with surface ships before the boat moored alongside &quot;Fulton&quot; in Brisbane on 13 September for refit.

=== Second patrol, October – November 1943 ===
Her second war patrol began on 4 October when &quot;Balao&quot; sailed in company with for Tulagi. After refueling there on 11 October, the submarine got underway for her assigned area north of the Bismarck Archipelago and again covered the Palau-Rabaul routes. &quot;Balao&quot; sighted a convoy on 17 October, but it escaped her salvo of six torpedoes by making a radical zig-zag maneuver and increasing speed to open the range. The convoy&#x27;s escorts counterattacked with depth charges, but &quot;Balao&quot; came away unscathed. Her targets moved out of range at high speed, preventing her from regaining contact.

&quot;Balao&quot; joined &quot;Silversides&quot; in a coordinated attack on a seven-ship convoy on 23 October, firing 10 torpedoes at three ships that presented an overlapping target. She scored six hits. One ship was seen down by the bow, with her stern in the air; another listed heavily; and a third was riding low in the water. While &quot;Balao&quot; was maneuvering into position for a second attack, the convoy&#x27;s escorts fired on her, forcing the submarine to dive. &quot;Balao&quot; lost contact with the convoy and failed in her attempts to reach &quot;Silversides&quot; to exchange information. She later learned, however, that her consort sank three of the seven ships.

&quot;Balao&quot; stopped at Tulagi to refuel and to load torpedoes. On 28 October, she was assigned to a scouting line south of Truk. On 4 November, the submarine made a submerged approach to a two-ship convoy, but the six torpedoes that she fired missed their marks. &quot;Balao&quot; then shifted to the Truk-New Hanover route where she conducted an uneventful patrol until 7 November, when she headed for Milne Bay, New Guinea, for refit alongside &quot;Fulton&quot;.

=== Third patrol, December 1943 – January 1944 ===
Underway again on 6 December, &quot;Balao&quot; spent two days in training exercises and practice approaches with &quot;Ethan&quot; as her target. On 13 December, the submarine conducted communication and identification tests with friendly search planes and then began her patrol. No surface contacts came during the first two weeks, but her luck changed on 27 December when two s and two s crossed her track. The four warships maneuvered in a radical zigzag plan at a speed of , passing the submarine so rapidly that she only managed a shot at the second cruiser. &quot;Balao&quot; fired four torpedoes which overran their target. While rigging for depth charges, she heard three explosions, but upon surfacing, could see no sign of damage. The warships were long gone at their high speed.

&quot;Balao&quot; began the year 1944 with a contact that turned out to be a very large steamer and two escorts. The weather impeded her efforts to close the convoy, but also offered protection when a rain squall covered &quot;Balao&quot; while she fired six torpedoes. The submarine counted three explosions and then went deep to wait out the inevitable depth charge attack by the escorts. When &quot;Balao&quot; surfaced the next morning, the convoy had disappeared. Certain that the freighter had been sunk, &quot;Balao&quot; resumed her patrol of the shipping lanes. She later sighted a convoy of a damaged freighter and two escorts and moved in for an attack only to discover that the freighter was her target of 1 January. The escorts drove &quot;Balao&quot; off, and on 7 January, she was ordered back to Brisbane, still without a confirmed kill under her belt.

=== Fourth patrol, February – March 1944 ===
&quot;Balao&quot; arrived in Brisbane on 15 January for a normal two week refit and a brief training period. On 6 February, she was underway via Tulagi for her patrol area north of New Guinea, which she entered on 13 February. Her first opportunity to attack came just after midnight on 23 February when she closed a convoy of two freighters and one small escort. &quot;Balao&quot; fired six torpedoes at the larger of the two freighters, scoring three hits. The escort maneuvered to attack, but never came close to the submarine. Rather than risk a repetition of her disappointment during her last patrol, &quot;Balao&quot; returned to the scene to verify that the ship had sunk. A survivor was taken on board, who stated that his vessel, the 5,857-ton passenger cargo ship &quot;Nikki Maru&quot;, had gone down rapidly after being hit.

A convoy located on 26 February did not offer a chance of attack, because had first fired on it causing its escorts to chase &quot;Balao&quot; from the scene. Two days later, &quot;Balao&quot; sighted smoke on the horizon and commenced tracking three ships and an escort. Shortly after midnight, &quot;Balao&quot; went to battle stations and closed for attack. After firing her six bow tubes at the lead ship, the submarine swung her stern toward the wing ships in the formation and fired her stern tubes. &quot;Balao&quot; heard several explosions at the expected times, as torpedo after torpedo struck home. One of the damaged ships trained a gun on &quot;Balao&quot;, but a heavy internal explosion silenced the gun before &quot;Balao&quot; could be hit. The submarine could see nothing except heavy smoke in the target area, but radar watched as two &quot;pips&quot; disappeared from the screen. &quot;Balao&quot; lured the escort out of the target area in order to double back to look for the third freighter. Radar and lookouts failed to locate the merchantman, so &quot;Balao&quot; returned to patrol the shipping lanes after a very successful attack. Postwar study of Japanese shipping records identified her victims as the 2,723-ton freighter &quot;Shoho Maru&quot; and the 6,803-ton passenger cargoship &quot;Akiuro Maru&quot;.

On 3 March, &quot;Balao&quot; fired four torpedoes at a small freighter and escort from a distance that proved to be too great. All four torpedoes passed under their targets. Later that morning, &quot;Balao&quot; sighted a convoy of four small cargo ships, described as &quot;the dregs of the worst of harbors.&quot; The convoy changed course and pulled away from the submarine before she could close for attack.

The next day, &quot;Balao&quot; investigated smoke on the horizon, found two cargo ships, tracked them through a rain squall, and as she passed into clear weather, found the convoy in perfect position for her torpedoes. She fired four stern tubes at the leading ship, but heard no explosions. The torpedoes were duds or had again passed underneath. As the escorts actively pursued the submarine, &quot;Balao&quot; submerged to wait out the inevitable depth charges. When the submarine surfaced again, all trace of the convoy was gone, and she set course for Langemak Bay, New Guinea, with all her torpedoes expended. On 7 March, &quot;Balao&quot; moored alongside &quot;Coucal&quot; and took on fuel and provisions. She got underway again on the following morning, bound for Pearl Harbor where she arrived for refit on 19 March.

=== Fifth patrol, April – June 1944 ===
&quot;Balao&quot; completed refit and training on 24 April and the next day began her voyage back to action. After stopping for a few hours at Midway to refuel, she continued to her patrol area around the Palau Islands. She contacted a small convoy on 14 May but was unable to close for attack because of the diligence of the Japanese escorts. The submarine returned to patrolling the Yap–Palau shipping lanes. Her next contacts were unfavorable for attack, and problems with her surface search radar hampered her efforts to seek out enemy shipping.

On 1 June, the situation brightened. &quot;Balao&quot; made radar contact with a four-ship convoy and tracked it to an excellent position for attack. Just after midnight on 2 June, she launched six torpedoes from her bow tubes at one of the largest passenger cargo ships, scoring two hits. Although pursued by the escorts, &quot;Balao&quot; again managed to close the convoy, now with only two ships visible. Only minutes before &quot;Balao&quot; reached firing position, one of the escorts unwittingly moved to a spot on &quot;Balao&quot;″s beam and stayed there, thwarting the submarine&#x27;s second attempt. She was prevented from carrying out a dawn attack by Japanese air cover and was forced to allow the convoy to escape without further damage. A fuel shortage forced &quot;Balao&quot; to enter Majuro Atoll on 12 June to begin refit alongside submarine tender .

=== Sixth patrol, July – August 1944 ===
&quot;Balao&quot; began her sixth war patrol on 5 July when she departed Majuro for the Palau area. The submarine made a few contacts, but none worthy of pursuit. On 26 July, &quot;Balao&quot; joined in the bombardment of Angaur Island in the Palaus by firing on a lighthouse and loading docks, scoring several direct hits. The same day, she witnessed a fighter plane from the carrier splash into the water dead ahead and quickly managed to rescue the pilot. After transferring him to , &quot;Balao&quot; returned to lifeguard duties off Peleliu Island where she picked up two more downed aviators on 27 July.

On 29 July, &quot;Balao&quot; joined in a coordinated attack on two sampans, engaging them with gunfire until the Japanese abandoned ship and the sampans were destroyed. She then resumed patrol duty and continued the task until 12 August, when she rendezvoused with and headed for Tanapag Harbor, Saipan. &quot;Balao&quot; was then ordered back to the United States where she entered the Mare Island Navy Yard on 20 August for a complete overhaul. Upon the completion of that work, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 15 November and prepared to return to the war in the Pacific.

=== Seventh patrol, December 1944 – January 1945 ===
&quot;Balao&quot; left Pearl Harbor on 4 December and rendezvoused with and en route Tanapag Harbor. The trio of submarines reached port on 15 December and moored in a nest alongside &quot;Fulton&quot;. After topping off fuel, water, and provisions on 17 December, they got underway to patrol the Yellow Sea in a coordinated attack group. Until 2 January 1945, their only contacts were fishing craft and floating mines. On that day, however, &quot;Balao&quot; sighted the masts of a sailing vessel. She closed the three masted schooner and surfaced to attack. Her first two torpedoes missed the target, but the third hit squarely amidships and sank the vessel. That day proved to be lucky for &quot;Balao&quot; because, later that night, she picked up a larger ship on radar and successfully moved into position. Early on 8 January, she fired six torpedoes, three of which scored; but the stubborn &quot;tanker&quot; remained afloat despite being dead in the water. &quot;Balao&quot; fired seven more torpedoes for three more direct hits, but the target still refused to sink. The submarine closed in on the badly damaged tanker and fired another trio of torpedoes, one of which struck the final blow. However, Japanese records examined after the war indicate that &quot;Balao&quot;″s victim on this occasion was not a tanker, but the 5,244-ton freighter &quot;Daigo Maru&quot;. After that, &quot;Balao&quot; patrolled independently until 19 January when she pulled into Apra Harbor, Guam, for refit alongside .

=== Eighth patrol, February – April 1945 ===
&quot;Balao&quot; began her eighth war patrol on 27 February as part of another attack group along with (like &quot;Balao&quot;, also the lead ship of a submarine class), , and on patrol in the East China and Yellow Seas. Her first opportunity for action came on 9 March, when she sighted a small tanker with two escorts steaming along the coastline. Although not in an ideal attack position, the submarine fired four torpedoes at the tanker, all of which missed. The target&#x27;s escorts struck back at &quot;Balao&quot; with depth charges, but the submarine escaped damage and resumed patrol duty later that day. She sighted many vessels during the next eight days, but did not attack them. On 18 March, &quot;Balao&quot; caught a 188-ton trawler alone, sank it with gunfire, and then rescued three survivors in the debris. Early the next morning, she attacked a convoy of four transports guarded by four escorts. Firing 10 torpedoes at three of the targets, &quot;Balao&quot; heard four hits and the explosion on one of the transports nearly blinded her lookouts. The early morning darkness made it impossible to assess the damage, but &quot;Balao&quot; received credit for sinking &quot;Hakozaki Maru&quot;, a 10,413-ton transport. {The &quot;Tatsuhara Maru&quot; was damaged}. The submarine then escaped to deep water to continue her patrol. Later that same afternoon, &quot;Balao&quot; surfaced to attack a group of small trawlers. She sank one trawler and left three others burning fiercely.

Shortly before dawn on 21 March, &quot;Balao&quot; began tracking a convoy of two ships closely guarded by four escorts. The effectiveness with which the escorts countered her several approaches convinced &quot;Balao&quot; that she had been detected. As dawn broke, the submarine made one last approach, moving to where she fired four torpedoes. An escort picked up the submarine&#x27;s trail, and &quot;Balao&quot; ran for deep water under a smoke screen without waiting to observe results. On 26 March, &quot;Balao&quot; encountered the 880-ton cargo ship, &quot;Shinto Maru No. 1&quot;, and sank her with gunfire. A small Japanese patrol vessel made an attempt to counterattack, but &quot;Balao&quot; slipped below the surface and headed for Guam to replenish her fuel, provisions, and torpedoes. On 2 April, &quot;Balao&quot; submerged rapidly to avoid detection by a large, low-flying enemy plane and took on several feet of water in her conning tower, grounding out her radar and other electrical gear. Despite these problems, she arrived safely at Guam on 8 April for refit.

=== Ninth patrol, May – June 1945 ===
The submarine began her ninth patrol on 3 May when she headed for the Yellow Sea to patrol in a wolfpack with , , and . Targets were scarce and mechanical difficulties plagued &quot;Balao&quot;. On 19 May, the submarine attacked a small freighter, but all three of the torpedoes that she fired missed the target. Nevertheless, she did win a consolation prize when one of her torpedoes struck and sank a nearby 30-ton junk. On 23 May, &quot;Balao&quot;″s earlier mechanical difficulties rendered her stern diving planes totally inoperable, and she received orders to Pearl Harbor for refit. En route, she embarked a sailor from suffering from appendicitis and an injured crewman. Later that evening, although the radar scope was clear and no other submarines were known to be in the vicinity, &quot;Balao&quot; was suddenly attacked by torpedoes. The quick reactions of the officer of the deck caused two to pass to port and two to starboard. The submarine continued on to Midway where she arrived on 3 June, discharged her passengers, and set a course for Pearl Harbor where she arrived four days later.

=== Tenth patrol, July – August 1945 ===
A month in port readied her for sea once more, and &quot;Balao&quot; got underway on 7 July for the Nanpō Islands area and waters east of Honshū. Her primary duty during this tenth and final war patrol was to provide lifeguard services for Allied aircrew during strikes on the Japanese home islands. &quot;Balao&quot; operated with air cover while on station and rescued four aviators during the patrol. Japan had been so weakened by the final weeks of the war that surface contacts were scarce. She was able to sink one picket boat and damage another with gunfire on 14 August. Word of Japan&#x27;s capitulation came on 15 August along with orders to cease fire. &quot;Balao&quot; rendezvoused with the next day to transfer the rescued aviators, then proceeded on to Pearl Harbor, where she arrived on 25 August.

=== Post-War ===
The submarine departed Pearl Harbor on 31 August for Staten Island, New York, where her crew enjoyed a well-deserved rest period and she underwent an overhaul. &quot;Balao&quot; was decommissioned on 20 August 1946, and she was berthed in New London, Conn., as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

== 1952–1963 ==
&quot;Balao&quot; was recommissioned on 4 March 1952 at the U.S. Naval Submarine Base, New London, Connecticut, Lieutenant Commander S. V. Hadley in command, and assigned to the Atlantic Fleet&#x27;s Submarine Squadron 4 (SubRon 4). After shakedown training, the submarine was reassigned to SubRon 12 at the U.S. Naval Base in Key West, Fla. There, she served primarily as a training ship for antisubmarine and Special Development Forces in the Key West and Guantánamo Bay operating areas.

After making several goodwill visits to ports in the southern United States, &quot;Balao&quot; joined the ships of Destroyer Squadron 24 (DesRon 24) in a combined antisubmarine warfare (ASW) training and goodwill cruise to South America that began on 6 January 1957. After joint exercises with the navies of several South American countries, the ship made liberty calls to principal ports such as La Guaira, Venezuela; Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Montevideo, Uruguay; Mar del Plata and Buenos Aires, Argentina. The submarine returned to Key West on 22 March.

&quot;Balao&quot; deployed to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base four times in the next year, spending one month each time training surface ships in &quot;refresher training.&quot; The submarine departed Key West on 19 July 1958 for an overhaul at the Charleston Naval Shipyard. Upon its completion on 13 November, &quot;Balao&quot; conducted refresher training at New London, Conn. and Newport, Rhode Island. After &quot;Balao&quot;″s return to Key West on 30 November, she and spent 12 days of December in hunter-killer training.

=== Return to service ===
After her fame and stardom in the 1959 Blake Edwards film &quot;Operation Petticoat&quot;, &quot;Balao&quot; returned to local training operations. On 1 April 1960, she was reclassified as an auxiliary submarine, AGSS-285, but continued to serve as a training ship. On 3 March 1961, &quot;Balao&quot; simulated a disabled submarine for the testing of a new device for individual escape. The mechanism, known as the &quot;Steinke hood,&quot; enabled Commander W. F. Mazzone and Lieutenant H. E. Steinke, the hood&#x27;s inventor, to ascend from a depth of to the surface in 55 seconds, setting a new record.

From 28 June–4 November, the submarine underwent overhaul and battery renewal. She returned to Key West and resumed services in training. In April 1962, &quot;Balao&quot; deployed to the Mediterranean Sea where she joined the 6th Fleet for four months of exercises with other NATO navies. &quot;Balao&quot; also deployed to the western Atlantic during the Cuban Missile Crisis in October–November, but returned to routine training duty when the trouble died down.

=== Decommissioning ===
In 1963, the Board of Inspection and Survey determined &quot;Balao&quot; to be unfit for further service. The submarine was decommissioned on 1 August 1963, and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register that same day. Her hulk was sunk off the coast of northern Florida on 6 September as a target. Before this occurred, her conning tower and periscope shears were removed, and are on display on the waterfront at the National Museum of the United States Navy of the Washington Navy Yard in Washington, D.C. Her anchor was removed and is displayed at Veterans&#x27; Memorial Park in Florence, Alabama.

== Awards ==
&quot;Balao&quot; received nine battle stars for her World War II service.

<text>Olivier Occéan (), born October 23, 1981) is a retired Canadian professional soccer player and current assistant coach of IF Urædd.

== Club career ==

=== College soccer ===
Occéan played college soccer at Essex County College, Newark NJ in NJCAA Division 1 and at Southern Connecticut State University for the Fighting Owls in the NCAA Division II, from 2001 to 2003. While at the college, Occéan was twice named an NCAA All-American. He finished his career with 57 goals, including 21 as a senior, and 22 in 2001. During this time he also played for Vermont Voltage in the USL Premier Development League.

Upon graduating from college, Occéan was selected 26th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by the MetroStars. Occéan didn&#x27;t surprise many after coming from a powerhouse Division II program, which had won six NCAA titles, and looked likely to make the team. However, Occéan did surprise when, while the MetroStars were playing in the preseason La Manga Cup, Occéan impressed the Metrostars&#x27; competitors Odd Grenland so much that the team immediately offered him a contract. With Major League Soccer not willing to compete financially with the Norwegian club, Occéan ended up with Odd.

=== Odd ===
Occéan quickly impressed in Norway, earning a starting spot and immediately scoring goals. In his first season with Odd, Occéan led the team in goals with 14, although the team slumped to a mid-table finish.

=== Lillestrøm SK ===

He signed a five-year contract with Lillestrøm on December 10, 2005. The deal was worth approximately €885,000 plus about €126,000 in possible incentive pay. After a promising start however, his first season with the club was marred by a five-month goal-drought broken only in the very last match of the season. Occéan then faced the challenge of living up to the price tag and in the 2007 and 2008 seasons, the muscular striker bagged in 12 goals for the club.

=== Kickers Offenbach ===
Prior to the start of the 2010–11 season, Occean moved to Germany, joining 3. Liga side Kickers Offenbach on a free transfer. He got off to a perfect start, netting four goals in his first three league appearances, thus becoming an instant favorite with Kickers fans. In his only season at the club, he scored 16 goals in 30 matches.

=== Greuther Fürth ===
It was announced in the German media on May 25, 2011 that Occéan had signed a three-year contract with SpVgg Greuther Fürth until June 2014. Occéan made his debut for his new team on July 15 in a 3–2 home defeat to Eintracht Frankfurt. One week later, Occéan once again started for SpVgg Fürth and scored two goals leading the team to a 4–0 road victory over 1. FC Union Berlin. Occéan scored one of the most important goals of the season in the DFB-Pokal quarter finals, scoring the game winner in the 44th minute against Hoffenheim on February 8, 2012. On March 1, 2012 he was named the Canada Soccer Player of the Month for February based on his club team performances, and again for the month of March. Occéan helped lead Greuther Fürth to win the 2. Bundesliga championship. He was also awarded the league&#x27;s top scorer with 17 goals in 30 appearances, Nick Proschwitz and Alexander Meier scored the same number of goals within the league, however Occéan tallied more assists.

=== Eintracht Frankfurt ===
On July 3, 2012, Occéan transferred to Eintracht Frankfurt for €1.3 million signing a three-year contract, where he would be joining fellow Canadian Rob Friend. Occéan made his top flight debut for Frankfurt on August 25 playing all 90 minutes in a 2–1 away victory over Bayer Leverkusen. On September 15, 2012, Occéan scored his first Bundesliga goal in his third appearance for the club. He scored the second goal in an eventual 3–2 victory against Hamburger SV.

=== 1. FC Kaiserslautern ===
It was announced on July 1, 2013 that Occéan was loaned to 1. FC Kaiserslautern of the 2. Bundesliga on a two-year loan with an option for the loan to be extended even further after the 2012–13 season in which he scored only once for Frankfurt in 17 appearances.

=== Second spell at Odd ===
On January 6, 2015, Occéan signed a half-year loan deal with his former club Odd, who plays in the Norwegian Eliteserien.
On July 8, 2015, Occéan signed a two-and-a-half-year contract with Odd.

=== Urædd Fotball ===
In 2018, Occéan signed with Urædd Fotball of the 3. divisjon. Occéan concurrently also began his coaching career as a youth coach at Urædd.

After two seasons at Mjøndalen, he returned to Urædd Fotball for the 2020 season as a playing assistant coach. He ended his player career at the end of 2020 and continued at Urædd in his role as an assistant coach for the team and youth coach.

== International career ==
Occéan made his debut for Canada in a May 2004 friendly match against Wales and until the end of 2012 he has earned a total of 28 caps, scoring six goals. He has represented Canada in 15 FIFA World Cup qualification matches (four goals) and at the 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup. He scored Canada&#x27;s first and only goal from a header in a 1–0 win against Cuba in Havana, during the opening match of the semi-final round of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. On February 11, 2013 FIFA ruled that Occéan had committed an act of unsporting conduct, displayed several acts of unsporting behavior, and used offensive language towards match officials during a 2014 World Cup qualifying match against Cuba on October 12, 2012. As part of the ruling, Occéan received a 6-match suspension. It was later determined that only Canada&#x27;s official competitive matches, not friendlies, count toward the suspension meaning that the earliest that Occéan would be available for selection would be the final of the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, if Canada were to advance that far in the tournament.

<doc id="1109413" wikidata="Q77030" url="?curid=1109413" title="Gee Jon">
<text>Gee Jon (; 1895 – February 8, 1924) was a Chinese national who was the first person in the United States to be executed by lethal gas. A member of the Hip Sing Tong criminal society from San Francisco, California, Gee was sentenced to death for the murder of Tom Quong Kee, who was a member of the rivaling Bing Kung Tong in Mina, Nevada. An unsuccessful attempt to pump poison gas directly into his cell at Nevada State Prison led to the development of the gas chamber.

==Background==
Gee Jon was born around 1895 in Canton to a Cantonese family. He immigrated to the United States between 1907 and 1908. He spent most of his life at San Francisco&#x27;s Chinatown in California, though he was recorded as having briefly lived in the Chinatown area of Stockton. Gee became a member of the Hip Sing Tong society, which dealt in narcotics and liquor. In 1922, territorial disputes with the Bing Kong Tong society led to the outbreak of hostilities.

==Murder of Tom Quong Kee==

Gee Jon was ordered by Hip Sing officials to perform a gang hit on 74-year-old Chinese laundry proprietor Tom Quong Kee (), who was a nominal member of the Bing Kong Tong. Hughie Sing, a 19-year-old from Carson City, newly recruited to the Hip Sing Tong and Gee&#x27;s apprentice of two months, pointed Tom out as a target. They traveled to Mina from Reno on the 18th or 20th of August, reportedly being seen by deputy sheriff W. J. Hammill asking about work at the local Palace Café. By then Hammill had heard rumors that the men he had seen were Tong members in town to kill Tom Quong Kee and were pretending to be job-seekers on their way to Tonopah as a cover.

On the night of August 27, 1921, Gee and Sing knocked on the door of Tom&#x27;s cabin, the former armed with a .38 caliber revolver. When Tom answered the door in his pajamas, Gee, who was standing behind Sing, killed the elderly man with two shots to the heart. Tom&#x27;s body was discovered the next morning by one of his friends, reporting his find to justice of the peace L. E. Cornelius, who in turn alerted Hammill. After finding two sets of footprints at the crime scene, Hammill made a possible link to the presence of two strangers he had seen the week before. Gee and Sing were apprehended the same day in Reno after Hammill phoned chief of police John Kirkley about two possible murder suspects driving back from Mina. Their arrests were considered unusual, as other Tong killings typically went unsolved, with at least three additional murders with suspected Tong involvement being reported by the end of August. During interrogation, Sing confessed to his role in the murder and implicated Gee as the one to fire the fatal shots, under the belief that this would lead to his immediate release from custody.

===Trial and sentencing===
Gee and Sing were defended by attorneys James M. Frame and Fiore Raffetto. Sing recanted his confession and entered a not guilty plea along with Gee. In February 1922, both were convicted and sentenced to death in the District Court of Mineral County, Nevada. Sing&#x27;s sentence was commuted to life imprisonment because he was only nineteen years old and Gee had been the one to commit the shooting, also highlighting that unlike Gee, who was described as &quot;an illiterate Chinese unacquainted with American customs&quot;, Sing had been born in the United States, was educated at a bilingual grammar school and had cooperated with the authorities; he was released on parole in 1938. A bill authorizing the use of lethal gas had passed the Nevada State Legislature in 1921, making Gee eligible to become the first person to be executed by this method. Frame argued that Gee&#x27;s sentence constituted cruel and unusual punishment, but his appeal was denied. The Supreme Court of Nevada instead complimented the state legislators for &quot;inflicting the death penalty in the most humane manner known to modern science&quot;. Raffetto unsuccessfully filed a writ of certiorari with the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco. Gee was incarcerated in Nevada State Prison at Carson City and initially intended to be gassed alongside another murderer, Thomas Russell, whose sentence was commuted to life imprisonment a day before the execution date.

==Death==
=== Preparation ===
The California Cyanide Company of Los Angeles, California, was the only distributor of liquid cyanide in the western United States and refused to deliver it to Carson City over liability concerns. The poison was used to eradicate pests from citrus groves in California. Warden Denver S. Dickerson sent his assistant Tom Pickett to Los Angeles to personally pick up of lethal gas, which was contained in a mobile fumigating unit that cost $700. Four guards who did not want to participate in the process had resigned. The officials first attempted to pump poison gas directly into Gee&#x27;s cell while he was sleeping, but without success because the gas leaked from the cell. A makeshift gas chamber was set up at the butcher shop of the prison, measuring eleven feet long, ten feet wide, and eight feet high. A small window next to the wooden chair allowed witnesses to look inside. A day before the execution, two cats were used to test the lethal effectiveness of the chamber. It was declared that the animals &quot;died apparently instantly and without pain&quot; in 15 seconds. 

=== Execution ===
Gee Jon was executed in the morning hours of February 8, 1924. Gee, who had fasted for ten days before his execution date, agreed to have a last meal, consisting of ham, eggs, toast, and a cup of coffee. A guard transporting Gee to the gas chamber reportedly muttered &quot;Die like a man, Jon&quot; to the inmate as he was tied onto a metal bench while the cyanide was being prepared. Gee wept as he was strapped into the chair until the captain of the guards told him to &quot;Brace up!&quot; Around a dozen attendees, including news reporters, public health officials, and representatives of the U.S. Army, served as witnesses to the execution, many of whom smoked cigarettes before and during the execution, believing that tobacco smoke would act &quot;as protection against vagrant gas fumes that might drift their way&quot;.

At 9:40 a.m. the pump sprayed of hydrocyanic acid into the chamber. The weather was cold and humid. Because an electric heater failed, the chamber was instead of the ideal , causing some of the acid to form a puddle on the floor. Gee turned his head to look for the source of the noise, then appeared to lose consciousness in about five seconds, with his head continuing to nod up and down for six minutes. He was completely motionless after ten minutes. Some of the witnesses momentarily thought they smelled the odor of almond blossoms, thought to be the odor of cyanide, leaking from the chamber. The warden had the witnesses cleared from the area. At about 10:00 a.m., a vent was opened, and a fan was turned on to discharge the poison gas. The prison staff waited for the remaining puddle of hydrocyanic acid to evaporate before cleaning up the chamber. Gee&#x27;s body was removed from the chamber at 12:20 p.m. and taken to the prison hospital. A group of seven doctors pronounced him dead but did not conduct an autopsy on the body out of concern that some remaining gas could be released. Gee was 29 years old when he died and his body was buried at the Carson City Penitentiary cemetery. 

Just after the execution, one of the physicians who examined Gee&#x27;s body, Dr. Delos A. Turner, a Major of the U.S. Veterans&#x27; Bureau in Reno, asked for permission to perform medical experiments &quot;in the interests of science.&quot; Turner wanted to inject Gee&#x27;s corpse with camphor believing that it would bring Gee back to life. Dickerson denied the request. Another physician professed his belief that Gee had not died by gas inhalation but due to &quot;cold and exposure&quot;.

===Reaction===
Newspapers reported overwhelmingly positive on the new execution method, citing witnesses who described Gee&#x27;s death as painless by their own judgement. The &quot;Nevada State Journal&quot; proclaimed, &quot;Nevada&#x27;s novel death law is upheld by the highest court—humanity.&quot; However, the &quot;San Jose Mercury News&quot; printed, &quot;One hundred years from now Nevada will be referred to as a heathen commonwealth controlled by savages with only the outward symbols of civilization.&quot;

Warden Dickerson reported to Nevada governor James G. Scrugham and the legislature his opinion that the use of lethal gas was impractical and that he thought execution by firing squad was still the best method of execution.

<doc id="1109435" wikidata="Q7140482" url="?curid=1109435" title="Particle (ecology)">
<text>In marine and freshwater ecology, a particle is a small object. Particles can remain in suspension in the ocean or freshwater. However, they eventually settle (rate determined by Stokes&#x27; law) and accumulate as sediment. Some can enter the atmosphere through wave action where they can act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Many organisms filter particles out of the water with unique filtration mechanisms (filter feeders). Particles are often associated with high loads of toxins which attach to the surface. As these toxins are passed up the food chain they accumulate in fatty tissue and become increasingly concentrated in predators (see bioaccumulation). Very little is known about the dynamics of particles, especially when they are re-suspended by dredging. They can remain floating in the water and drift over long distances. The decomposition of some particles by bacteria consumes much oxygen and can cause the water to become hypoxic.

==Particle analysis==
Particle levels in water (or air) can be measured with a turbidity meter and analyzed with a particle counter. They can also be scanned with an underwater microscope, such as ecoSCOPE.

==Contaminant kinetics==

It takes a few days until plankton organisms have filtered the particles and incorporated the toxins into their body fat and tissue: In the southwards flow of the waters of the Hudson off the coast of New Jersey, the highest levels of mercury in copepods have not been found directly in front of the river off New York but 150 km south, off Atlantic City.

Many copepods are then captured by mysidae, krill and smallest fish like the juveniles of atlantic herring - and in each step of the foodchain the toxin concentrations increase by the factor of 10.


Filter of krill: The first degree filter setae carry in v-form two rows of second degree setae, pointing towards the inside of the feeding basket. The purple ball is one micrometer in size. To display the total area of this fascinating particle filtration structure one would have to tile 7500 times this image.


Filter basket of a mysid. These 3 cm long animals live close to shore and hover above the sea floor, constantly collecting particles. Mysids are an important food source for herring, cod, flounder, striped bass. In polluted areas they have high toxin levels in their tissue but they are very robust and require much poison to die.</text><links>

<text>Leonard Griffin (born September 11, 1982) is an American former soccer player. He currently serves as the head coach for the California men&#x27;s soccer team.

==Career==

===College and amateur===
Griffin attended Littlerock High School in Littlerock, California, and was a four-year letterman in soccer. He was a three-time first team All-League honoree, and as a senior, he was a Los Angeles Daily News first team All-Area honoree, and set the school single-season record for goals (24 goals).

Griffin played college soccer at the UCLA from 2000 to 2003. Griffin distinguished himself at the school, helping the team win a national championship in 2002, and being named an NCAA All-American in 2003.

During his college years he also played with Orange County Blue Star in the USL Premier Development League, where he played alongside Jürgen Klinsmann.

===Professional===
Upon graduating from UCLA, Griffin was drafted 11th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by the Fire. In his first year Griffin had trouble establishing himself in a single role, but instead played a variety of defensive positions for the Fire when needed, finishing with 330 minutes over 9 games. He saw 3 games for the Fire in 2005, and 6 in 2006. Griffin was waived by the Fire during the 2007 pre-season, and signed by USL First Division side Portland Timbers, joining former UCLA teammate and fellow defensive standout Scot Thompson.

In September 2007, the Columbus Crew acquired his rights from the Chicago Fire, in exchange for the Crew&#x27;s natural fourth-round selection in the 2008 MLS Supplemental Draft. In April, he was waived by the Crew to make room for the addition of Gino Padula. He then rejoined the Timbers for the 2008 season.

Griffin was signed by Los Angeles Galaxy on January 7, 2009, but suffered an injury in pre-season which prevented him from playing. Upon his recovery, and with the MLS Reserve Division having been scrapped at the end of 2008, Galaxy loaned Griffin to the Hollywood United Hitmen of the USL Premier Development League for part of the 2009 PDL season, to regain his match fitness levels. He scored a goal on his debut for Hollywood, in a May 30 game against the BYU Cougars. In late February 2010 his option was picked up by Austin Aztex of the USSF Division 2.

Griffin stayed with Austin for the 2010 season. On March 24, 2011, Griffin transferred to Los Angeles Blues of the newly formed USL Pro league.

== Coaching ==
Griffin began his college coaching career as an assistant women&#x27;s soccer coach for the Cal State San Bernardino Coyotes during the 2008 through 2010 seasons. He joined the Saint Mary&#x27;s Gaels men&#x27;s soccer program as an assistant men&#x27;s coach in 2011 and 2012, helping lead the Gaels to a West Coast Conference championship and a quarterfinal appearance in the 2011 NCAA Division I Men&#x27;s Soccer Tournament.

In 2015 he joined his alma mater as an assistant coach for the UCLA Bruins men&#x27;s soccer team following a two-year stint as an assistant coach for the California Golden Bears men&#x27;s soccer program. After two years at UCLA he was hired by the University of Portland in March 2016 and got a contract as an assistant coach of the Portland Pilots men&#x27;s soccer team.

In April 2019 he was announced as the new head coach for the San Francisco Dons men&#x27;s soccer team, replacing Eddie Soto who resigned as the prior month. He was also named the Boy&#x27;s Director of Coaching at the San Francisco Elite Academy.

In May 2021 he was announced as the new head coach for the Grand Canyon Antelopes men&#x27;s soccer team, replacing Schellas Hyndman who announced his retirement in January 2021.

Griffin would only stay at Grand Canyon for a year as he accepted the head coaching position at California in 2022.

==Personal==
Leonard is the older brother of fellow professional soccer player Maxwell Griffin. His brother-in-law Spencer Thompson was also a professional soccer player who played for the Portland Timbers.

<doc id="1109441" wikidata="Q168346" url="?curid=1109441" title="Monogram">
<text>A monogram is a motif made by overlapping or combining two or more letters or other graphemes to form one symbol. Monograms are often made by combining the initials of an individual or a company, used as recognizable symbols or logos. A series of uncombined initials is properly referred to as a cypher (e.g. a royal cypher) and is not a monogram.

Many of today&#x27;s monograms are embroidered on items for the home like towels, bedding, robes etc. 

==History==

Monograms first appeared on coins, as early as 350 BC. The earliest known examples are of the names of Greek cities which issued the coins, often the first two letters of the city&#x27;s name. For example, the monogram of Achaea consisted of the letters alpha (Α) and chi (Χ) joined together.

Monograms have been used as signatures by artists and craft workers on paintings, sculptures and pieces of furniture, especially when guilds enforced measures against unauthorized participation in the trade. A famous example of a monogram serving as an artist&#x27;s signature is the &quot;AD&quot; used by Albrecht Dürer.

==Christograms==
Over the centuries, monograms of the name of Jesus Christ have been used as Christian symbols. The IX monogram consists of the initial Greek letters of the name &quot;Jesus Christ,&quot; &quot;I&quot; for Ιησούς, (Jesus in Greek) and &quot;X&quot; for Χριστος (Christ in Greek). The &quot;IHS&quot; Christogram, denoting the first three letters of the Greek name of Jesus, is usually written as a cypher, but sometimes as a monogram.

Perhaps the most significant Christogram is the Chi Rho, formed from the first two letters of Χριστος. The symbol was used by the Roman emperor Constantine I (r. 306–337) as part of a military standard.

==Royal monograms==
&quot;Signum manus&quot; (sometimes also known as &quot;Chrismon&quot;) refers to the medieval practice, current from the Merovingian period until the 14th century in the Frankish Empire and its successors, of signing a document or charter with a special type of monogram or royal cypher.

Monograms of the names of monarchs are used as part of the insignia of public organizations in kingdoms, such as on police badges. This indicates a connection to the ruler. However, the royal cypher, so familiar on pillar boxes, is not technically a monogram, since the letters are not combined.

Royal monograms often appear on coins, frequently surmounted by a crown. Countries that have employed this device in the past include Bulgaria, Great Britain, Russia, Sweden and many German states. Today, several Danish coins carry the monogram of Margrethe II, while the current Norwegian 1 Krone coin has the &quot;H5&quot; monogram of Harald V on the obverse. The only countries using the Euro to have a royal monogram as their national identifying mark are Belgium and Monaco. In Thailand, royal monograms appear on the individual flag for each major royal family member.

==Individual monograms==
An individual&#x27;s monogram may appear in stylized form on stationery, luggage, clothing, or other personalized items. These monograms may have two or three letters.

A basic 3-letter monogram has the initial of the individual&#x27;s last name (surname) set larger, or with some special treatment in the center, while the first name initial appears to the left of it and the middle name initial appears to the right of it. There is a difference in how this is written for men and women. For example, if the individual&#x27;s name is Mary Ann Jones, and Jones is the surname, then the arrangement of letters would be thus: MJA, with the surname initial set larger in the center, the M for Mary to the left and the A for Ann to the right. Traditionally, individual monograms for men are based on the order of the name. The name Kyle George Martin would be written (KGM).

Married or engaged couples may use two-letter monograms of their entwined initials, for example on wedding invitations. Married couples may also create three-letter monograms incorporating the initial of their shared surname. For example, the monogram MJA might be used for Michael and Alice Jones. However, monogramming etiquette for the married couple varies according to the item being monogrammed. Linens, for example, typically list the woman&#x27;s given initial first, followed by the couple&#x27;s shared surname initial and then the man&#x27;s given initial (AJM).
Monograms can often be found on custom dress shirts where they can be located in a number of different positions.

Some personal monograms have become famous symbols in their own right and instantly recognizable to many, such as J.R.R. Tolkien&#x27;s monogram.

==Other monograms==

Some companies and organizations adopt a monogram for a logo, usually with the letters of their acronym. For example, as well as having an official seal, and the Texas Longhorns logo, the University of Texas at Austin uses a &quot;UT&quot; monogram (in the same color as the Longhorns logo, burnt orange). The New York Yankees baseball team also uses a monogram on their ball cap insignia. The Consolidated Edison logo, with a rounded &quot;E&quot; nested inside a &quot;C&quot;, has been described as a &quot;classic emblem.&quot;

Many fashion companies have a monogram for a logo, including Louis Vuitton and Fendi. The connected &quot;CC&quot; company logo, created by Coco Chanel, is one of the most recognizable monograms internationally.

The victor is a monogram of the Latin or Spanish painted on Spanish and Hispanic universities to celebrate a student receiving a doctorate.

Athletes have also been known to brand merchandise with their monogram logo; notably Tiger Woods and Roger Federer.
== Resistance symbols in wartime ==
A notable example of a royal monogram is the H7 monogram of King Haakon VII of Norway. While in exile during World War II, Haakon VII spearheaded the Norwegian resistance to the German occupation, and H7 became a symbol used by the Norwegian populace to mark solidarity and loyalty to the King, and adherence to the Norwegian resistance movement. The act of drawing or creating a H7 symbol in German-occupied Norway was punishable by imprisonment.

Similarly, in Poland during the war, the &quot;PW&quot; monogram was used as a resistance symbol, known as &#x27;The Anchor&#x27; (), due to its characteristic shape. Its meaning varied, as the initials were useful for many different slogans, such as &#x27;Poland Fights&#x27;, &#x27;Warsaw Uprising&#x27;, &#x27;Polish Army&#x27;, and others. Like the Norwegian example above, its use was punished by the Nazi occupation authorities.

Another example is the monogram of La Liga Filipina. The monogram sees the letters L and F as well as two hexagons.

==Zirkel==
In the Germanosphere, certain student societies (&quot;Studentenverbindung&quot;) use monograms known as &quot;Zirkel&quot; (&quot;circle&quot;, as in &quot;circle of friends&quot;), consisting of the initial letter of the organization&#x27;s name and/or the letters v,c,f or e,f,v, together with an exclamation mark if the society is still active.

==Japanese==

A Japanese rebus monogram is a monogram in a particular style, which spells a name via a rebus, as a form of Japanese wordplay or visual pun. Today they are most often seen in corporate logos or product logos.

<doc id="1109452" wikidata="Q1783104" url="?curid=1109452" title="Wigan Borough F.C.">
<text>Wigan Borough Football Club was an English football club from the town of Wigan, Lancashire. their forerunners were Wigan A.F.C., Wigan County, Wigan United and Wigan Town, County and Town having folded.

==Beginnings==
According to the Wigan Observer of 21 June 1920, Wigan Borough was originally formed as the amateur side Wigan United in November 1919, although the club predates this by at least two months as records exist from the previous September. It is also possible that United were a continuation of the club who played at Springfield Park some 20 years earlier.
United played 18 games in the 1919–20 season as members of the West Lancashire League and also entered the Richardson Cup. The club applied to join the Lancashire Combination for the 1920–21 season and continued as Wigan United for a further nine games (P9 L9) before being forced to close by the Lancashire FA as they were found guilty of paying their players for &quot;lost time&quot;, which contravened rules of the time. A new club, Wigan Association, was formed on 6 November 1920, taking over the fixtures of Wigan United for four games (P4 D1 L3). After this short period the F.A. agreed that all their demands had been met with the exception that the club would have to change their name again to avoid confusion with Wigan FC, the town&#x27;s rugby league team, allowing Wigan Association to become officially known as Wigan Borough Football Club on 11 December 1920. The newly named Wigan Borough applied for entrance to the football league&#x27;s Third Division North for the 1921–22 season, despite only finishing 17th of 18 clubs in the Lancashire Combination league. Astonishingly, they were, along with Barrow and Accrington Stanley, granted a place for the inaugural season of the competition.

==Life in the Football League==
Borough&#x27;s first match as a league club came against Arsenal in a friendly, which they won 2–1. Their first league match saw them fight back from 1–0 down to win 2–1 against Nelson, but they would go on to finish only 17th of 20 in their début season. They spent ten years at this level before resigning from the league during the 1931–32 season.

Boro&#x27;s most successful season came in 1928–29 when they finished fourth in the Third Division North League; however at the time only the regional champions were promoted. Also that season they reached the Third Round of the FA Cup, the furthest Borough would ever progress in the competition. Though they lost the match against Sheffield Wednesday 3–1, a Springfield Park record 30,443 crowd saw the game.

In 1931, the effects of the Great Depression proved too much and, unable to pay the players&#x27; wages any longer, Wigan Borough went out of business on 26 October 1931 with liabilities of £30,000. In truth the club had only made a profit for one year since they had been in the Football League. The last four players Doran, Russell, Hartley and Hallam were given free transfers in mid-December. 
The following year, Wigan&#x27;s Mayor chaired a public meeting at Queens Hall which resulted in the founding of Wigan Athletic. It would not be until 2 June 1978, however, that Wigan would have a side in the Football League once more, and four more years would be needed to restore third-tier football to the town.

==Noted players==
==Club records==
*Highest League Position: 4th, Football League Third Division North
*Largest win: 9–1 vs Lincoln (Football League Third Division North)
*Highest attendance: 30,443 vs Sheffield Wednesday (FA Cup Third Round)

<text>The Enduring Stockpile is the United States&#x27; arsenal of nuclear weapons following the end of the Cold War.

During the Cold War the United States produced over 70,000 nuclear weapons. By its end, the U.S. stockpile was about 23,000 weapons of 26 different types. The production of nuclear weapons ended in 1989, and since then existing weapons have been retired, dismantled, or mothballed. , the Enduring Stockpile consisted of about 9,600 weapons of 10 types. , about 3,000 of those weapons had been moved to the lowest readiness level, in which they are not dismantled, but are no longer in active service. In 2021, the Department of Energy website stated the stockpile was the lowest it had been since 1960.

Weapons in the Enduring Stockpile are categorized by level of readiness. The three levels are:

* Active Service: fully operational, connected to a delivery system, and available for immediate use (e.g., ICBM silos and ballistic missile submarines)
* Hedge Stockpile: fully operational, but kept in storage; available within minutes or hours; not connected to delivery systems, but delivery systems are available (e.g., missile and bomb stockpiles kept at various Air Force bases)
* Inactive Reserve: not in operational condition and/or do not have immediately available delivery systems, but can be made ready if needed.

In 2004, the stockpile included 5,886 strategic warheads and 1,120 tactical weapons. The strategic weapons included 1,490 ICBM warheads, 2,736 submarine-launched ballistic missile warheads, 1,660 bomber weapons such as strategic B61 and B83 gravity bombs, AGM-86 ALCM and several hundred spare warheads. The tactical weapons consist of 800 tactical B61 gravity bombs and 320 nuclear warheads for Tomahawk missiles.

The START II Treaty called for a reduction to a total of 3,500 to 3,000 warheads, but was not ratified by the Russian Duma. The replacement 2002 Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty delayed reductions to 2012, with a limit of 2,200 operationally deployed warheads. The New START treaty signed in 2010 commits to lowering that limit to 1,550 warheads, and was ratified by the Russian Duma on 26 January 2011.

<doc id="1109472" wikidata="Q746450" url="?curid=1109472" title="I'm Breathless">
<text>I&#x27;m Breathless is an album by American singer and songwriter Madonna, released on May 22, 1990, by Sire Records to accompany the film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. The album contains three songs written by Stephen Sondheim, which were used in the film, in addition to several songs co-written by Madonna that were inspired by but not included in the film. Madonna starred as Breathless Mahoney alongside her then-boyfriend Warren Beatty who played the title role, Dick Tracy. After filming was complete, Madonna began work on the album, with Sondheim, producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell. She also worked with producer Shep Pettibone on the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Vogue&quot;. The album was recorded in three weeks, at Johnny Yuma Recording and Ocean Way Studios, in Los Angeles, California.

Musically, &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; consists predominantly of jazz, swing and pop songs. The tracks reflected Madonna&#x27;s showgirl personality and were influenced by her relationship with Beatty. The singer wanted to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set in the days of the Untouchables law enforcement, and sang the songs accordingly. In some areas she pitched her vocals and belted the notes when necessary. She smoked cigarettes in order to portray the vocals of her character Breathless. Beatty and singer Mandy Patinkin were featured as duet partners on three of the songs.

In support of both &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; and her previous album, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, Madonna embarked on the Blond Ambition World Tour where a section was dedicated to the songs from the album. It was critically acclaimed, winning an award at the 1990 Pollstar Concert Industry Awards. However, due to its use of Catholic imagery, Pope John Paul II called for a boycott of the show. After the tour was over, Madonna performed songs from the album at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards and the 1991 Academy Awards. &quot;Vogue&quot;, the first single from &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot;, became one of Madonna&#x27;s most successful releases, reaching number one in over 30 countries. It was also critically acclaimed and was seen as an influential song, while the video helped to bring vogueing into mainstream popularity. The second and final single, &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, was a top-ten hit in the United States and the United Kingdom.

Music critics applauded the Sondheim numbers, along with Madonna&#x27;s vocals and versatility. However, some deemed the non-film songs to be of little value. &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;, one of the Sondheim tracks, went on to win the Academy Award for Best Original Song. &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; was commercially successful, peaking at number one on the European Top 100 Albums, as well as the national charts of Australia, Germany, and Japan—in the latter it became the country&#x27;s best-selling foreign album of the year. It also reached number two on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and was certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; has sold more than seven million copies worldwide.

==Background and development==

In 1990, Madonna was part of the film &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; starring as Breathless Mahoney, with Warren Beatty playing the titular character. Madonna told &quot;Premiere&quot; magazine that initially she had waited for Beatty to call her for the film. But when he did not, the singer decided to involve herself voluntarily. She pursued the part of Mahoney, but offered to work for minimum wages to avoid favoritism. Principal photography for &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; began on February 2, 1989, and ended three months later. The filmmakers considered shooting the film on-location in Chicago, Illinois, but production designer Richard Sylbert believed that &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; would work better using sound stages and backlots at Universal Studios in Universal City, California. Other filming took place at Warner Bros Studios in Burbank, California. Beatty often encouraged dozens of takes of every scene. The film was released in the United States on June 15, 1990, and was the third-highest opening weekend of 1990. &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; was the ninth-highest-grossing film in the US in 1990, and number twelve globally. The film also received positive reviews from critics. Roger Ebert from the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; praised the matte paintings, art direction and prosthetic makeup design, stating: &quot;&quot;Dick Tracy&quot; is one of the most original and visionary fantasies I&#x27;ve seen on a screen&quot;.

Beatty had realized several positive aspects of hiring Madonna as an actress for the film. She would be inclined to develop a soundtrack for &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; and the film studio would see this as a promotional opportunity before the release of their product, since Madonna was popular as a recording artist. This would also benefit Warner Bros. Records, who would get a reason to release a new Madonna record. According to J. Randy Taraborrelli, author of &quot;&quot;, by the 1980s record labels started to release albums which were closely associated with a film, thereby gaining double promotion. These were mostly termed as soundtracks although many of them were not related to the film. After the shooting for &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; was over, Madonna started working on a soundtrack in the studio. She had begun recording three songs by Stephen Sondheim for the film—&quot;Sooner or Later&quot;, &quot;More&quot; and &quot;What Can You Lose&quot;—which would be part of the album, but also had to write new songs comparable in style to the previous. Madonna also recorded &quot;Now I&#x27;m Following You&quot; whose version sung by Andy Paley appeared in the film. In her favor, she produced the entire album, including the Sondheim songs and thereby recorded them quickly in the studio. &quot;I want people to think of me as a musical comedy actress. That&#x27;s what this album is about for me. It&#x27;s a stretch. Not just pop music, but songs that have a different feel to them, a theatrical feel,” she said at the time.

Madonna was in a relationship with Beatty at that time, and her whole acting, recording and singing stemmed from impressing him with the album, which was important to her. Beatty and actor Mandy Patinkin also lent their voices for songs from the album. While &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; was being completed, it still needed a lead single. At the same time, Madonna and producer Shep Pettibone decided to compose a new song called &quot;Vogue&quot; to be placed on the B-side of &quot;Keep It Together&quot;, the final single from her fourth studio album, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (1989), to ensure that the song would fare better on the charts. When Warner executives heard the song, they decided to release it as an A-side, and was eventually included on the album. Despite not appearing in the film, &quot;Vogue&quot; was used in a commercial for &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; is one of three soundtracks released alongside the film, the others being the &quot;Dick Tracy: Original Soundtrack&quot;, and an orchestral score by Danny Elfman.

==Recording and composition==

&quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; is a jazz, swing and pop album where Madonna and Sondheim tried to recreate the music of the period portrayed in &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. According to Rikky Rooksby, author of &quot;The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna&quot;, the harmonic and melodic styles were more &quot;complex&quot; than the songs which Madonna was accustomed to, hence she found it difficult and demanding. She spoke about the &quot;wilderness&quot; of the tunes, saying that she was not confident of doing justice to the songs, and neither was Sondheim. But he kept on encouraging the singer so that the recording sessions would not be affected. Madonna also recruited producer Patrick Leonard and engineer Bill Bottrell to help her with the project. She and Leonard toiled to create music that would fit the style and production of the film, set in the days of the Untouchables law enforcement. According to Lucy O&#x27;Brien, author of &quot;&quot;, after Madonna&#x27;s split from husband Sean Penn in 1989, the singer was comfortable in her new relationship with Beatty, which influenced the songs. The singer and Leonard enlisted a ten-piece live band and jazz musicians. The sessions took place at Johnny Yuma Recording and Ocean Way Studios in Los Angeles, California, and concluded by three weeks. The songs on the album reflect Madonna&#x27;s showgirl personality where her singing ranged from &quot;rootsy, rocking&quot; in nature to slow, &quot;laid-back and soulful&quot; vocals. A studied approach was evident in most of them, which O&#x27;Brien compared to &quot;an actress playing a part and performing a vocal exercise in technique&quot;. Some of the songs had Madonna pitching her vocals and belting the notes only when necessary. A dryness was prevalent in most of the singing, which was required for the songs and the setting. Guy Pratt, who also played bass, said that the singer &quot;was in character and started smoking. She actually ponced a cigarette off me. Her character smoked, so therefore she did.&quot;

O&#x27;Brien said that the songs on &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; had a &quot;coquettish&quot; and &quot;pandering nature&quot;, and was the polar opposite to Madonna&#x27;s previous release, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, which had an introspective composition. &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; opens with the sound of an intercom and a shuffle, and power ballad &quot;He&#x27;s a Man&quot; starts, a song which Madonna sings as if she was a &quot;hooker stalking the boulevard&quot;. Also, Madonna&#x27;s &quot;haunting&quot; vocals continue after the music has faded. One of the Sondheim songs, &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;, evokes a 1930s jazz ballad with comping piano, brushed drum sounds, double bass, and horns. Conjuring the atmosphere of a smoky nightclub, the song finds Madonna in her lowest range as the melody shifts continuously. &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, the third song and second single, deals with sadomasochistic themes centered on a girl celebrating the pleasures of a &quot;good spanking&quot;. It is performed in an almost comical style, and stemmed from a line in the film, where Breathless says to Tracy, &quot;You don&#x27;t know whether to hit me or kiss me&quot;.
The following track on the album, &quot;I&#x27;m Going Bananas&quot;, is a Carmen Miranda-ish song done in a Spanish accent. A salsa rhythm is predominant, with Madonna squeezing her vocal cords while singing, backed by percussion and brass. In the fifth track, &quot;Crybaby&quot;, Madonna mimics the vocals of Betty Boop. The melody is heard over the interlining synth strings, horns and trumpets, and a bass. Rooksby explained that Madonna sang about a guy who is &quot;too sensitive and soft&quot;, and the chorus employs a chromatic chord sequence. The next track &quot;Something to Remember&quot; deals with her failed marriage to Penn and was the source of inspiration for naming her 1995 compilation album. Musically, it has melancholy chords and rambling melody, which according to Taraborrelli made it the most compelling song by Madonna.

Mark Coleman from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; described &quot;Back in Business&quot; as a &quot;nagging headache&quot;. It contains a &quot;slow-verse-fast-chorus&quot; sequence. According to Rooksby, &quot;the chorus bursts into life, with Madonna clearly relishing the lyrics about good guys finishing last... the coldness of her delivery is apt for the topic.&quot; Her vocals are accompanied by muted trumpet sounds and a saxophone solo. &quot;More&quot; is the second Sondheim number where Madonna recites the materialistic-themed lyrics with irony, over a bouncy two-beat with tap-dancing during an instrumental break. The track consists of syncopated chord structure, tempo changes and lyrical rhymes. The arrangement switches between slow and fast tempo, requiring proper enunciation by Madonna. The final Sondheim song, &quot;What Can You Lose&quot;, is the duet with Patinkin. It is a torch song where Patinkin supplies the male voice while Madonna sings during the second verse with strings and harmonics.

Madonna sings a two-part duet with Beatty titled &quot;Now I&#x27;m Following You&quot;. With beats atop a riff, Madonna reveals that &quot;Dick&quot; is an &quot;interesting name&quot;. The first part has strings, brass and muted horns, with a tap-dancing sequence during the intermediate piano solo and blues effect. At the last chord, the sound of the record getting stuck is heard, and a needle is drawn across the vinyl, leading into the much faster part two. The word &quot;Dick&quot; is continuously repeated in the main melody structure until the song ends with the sound of a record being snatched off a music player. Bill Meyers, who played piano during the recording, recalled that the song required only one take from Beatty. &quot;Vogue&quot; closes out the album and is musically different from the rest of the tracks. It is a dance number consisting of a &quot;throbbing beat&quot; and lyrically has a theme of escapism. The song talks about Vogueing, a dance form which reproduced poses from high-fashion modelling. The song also has a rap section, where Madonna names various &quot;golden era&quot; Hollywood celebrities, including Greta Garbo, Marilyn Monroe and Marlene Dietrich.

==Promotion==
Madonna first performed &quot;Vogue&quot; during her Blond Ambition tour (April–August 1990), followed by the September 6 performance at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, clad in 18th-century-inspired fashions. Madonna&#x27;s performance recreated the royal court of Marie Antoinette, dripping with sexual innuendo; at one point the singer flipped open her large skirt, allowing one of the dancers to crawl inside. Her dancer Carlton Wilborn explained that &quot;[such] level of production had never been done on MTV. The costumes, the fans, the drama... MTV just had no idea, we just came out and rocked.&quot; O&#x27;Brien described the performance as a &quot;moment of inspired brilliance&quot;, while Taraborrelli noted it as a &quot;classic, camp show that elevated the standards of future performances on that program&quot;. It was later ranked by &quot;Billboard&quot; as the sixth best performance in the history of the award show.

At the 1991 Academy Awards, Madonna appeared with singer Michael Jackson as her date and performed &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;. According to journalist Liz Smith, Madonna had promised to perform at the award show if either &quot;Sooner or Later&quot; or &quot;More&quot; was nominated in the Best Original Song category. She wore a long, tight, white dress designed by Bob Mackie and covered in sequins and pearls. On her neck she wore $20 million worth of jewelry from Harry Winston. Taraborrelli recalled that Madonna had appropriated every move and mannerisms of Marilyn Monroe for the performance, making it a tribute to the actress. When she appeared onstage, there was technical difficulty resulting in the microphone not rising from below the stage, and a stage-hand supposedly passing it to her, though it is clear from the video that a microphone was already on stage before her entrance. However, one of her earrings did come undone, prompting her to toss it away dramatically as part of her act. &quot;Billboard&quot; ranked it as the seventh &quot;most awesome&quot; Oscar performance of all time, saying that &quot;Madonna gave a performance that took us back to the glamorous days of old Hollywood.&quot;

===Tour===
&quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot;, alongside Madonna&#x27;s previous album, &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, was majorly promoted in Madonna&#x27;s third concert tour, the Blond Ambition World Tour, which visited Asia, North America and Europe. Consisting of 57 dates, the concert was divided into five sections, the first inspired by the 1927 German expressionist film &quot;Metropolis&quot;, the second by religious themes, the third by &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; and cabaret, the fourth by Art Deco, and the fifth was an encore. The show contained sexual themes and Catholic imagery, such as in Madonna&#x27;s performance of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, which was based in church-like surroundings with Madonna wearing a crucifix and her backup dancers dressed like priests and nuns. The concert was criticized for its sexual content and religious imagery; in Toronto, Canada, Madonna was threatened of being arrested for obscenity, and Pope John Paul II later called for a boycott, with one of the three Italian dates being cancelled. Despite this, the tour was a critical success, winning &quot;Most Creative Stage Production&quot; at the 1990 Pollstar Concert Industry Awards.

The performance of the &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; songs began with &quot;Sooner or Later&quot; sung atop a grand piano, followed by &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, with Madonna standing in front of a microphone. She was dressed in a striped vaudeville-style corset, playing the part of a nightclub singer. Near the end Madonna joked: &quot;You all know the pleasures of a good spanking, don&#x27;t you? [...] When I hurt people, I feel better, you know what I mean?&quot; The final song of the segment was &quot;Now I&#x27;m Following You&quot; where Madonna danced and lip-synched with dancer Salim Gauwloos, dressed as Dick Tracy. Regarding the &quot;shameless promotion&quot; of &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; in this segment, O&#x27;Brien said that &quot;along with her yen for artistic expression, Madonna has always had an eye on the bottom dollar... [But] the &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; section is the least dynamic part of the show&quot;.

===Singles===
&quot;Vogue&quot; was released as the lead single from the soundtrack, on March 27, 1990. A deep house influenced song, it became Madonna&#x27;s eighth single to top the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart. It also reached the top of the Hot Dance Club Play chart. Internationally, &quot;Vogue&quot; reached the top the charts in 30 countries, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada and Finland. It became the world&#x27;s best-selling single of 1990, selling over six million copies. &quot;Vogue&quot; has been continuously acclaimed since its release; reviewers have praised its anthemic nature, calling it a &quot;funky&quot; and &quot;catchy&quot; song, and listed it as one of the singer&#x27;s musical highlights.

The music video for &quot;Vogue&quot;, directed by David Fincher, showed Madonna paying homage to various golden era Hollywood actresses. Shot in black-and-white, the video takes stylistic inspiration from the 1920s and 30s; in it, Madonna and her dancers can be seen voguing different choreographed scenes. Critics noted the way in which Madonna used her postmodern influence to expose an underground subcultural movement to the masses and for making the sex and gender roles ambiguous in its portrayal of people. The video has been ranked as one of the greatest of all times in different critic lists and polls, and won three awards at the 1990 MTV Video Music Awards, out of a total of nine nominations.

The album&#x27;s second single, &quot;Hanky Panky&quot;, was released on June 30, 1990. Critical response for the song was positive, with &quot;The New York Times&quot; calling it &quot;a calculated bid for outrage&quot;. It enjoyed commercial success, reaching the top ten in New Zealand and the United Kingdom. In the United States, it peaked at number ten in the week of July 28, 1990. &quot;Now I&#x27;m Following You&quot;, the two-part duet with Warren Beatty, was intended to be the third single, but was ultimately canceled. Several remixes were commissioned and promos and test pressings were issued.

==Critical reception==
J. Randy Taraborrelli gave &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; a favorable review in his book &quot;&quot;, writing that it was &quot;one of Madonna&#x27;s greatest musical moments&quot;, and praising her vocal performance. Authors Allen Metz and Carol Benson wrote in their book &quot;The Madonna Companion&quot; that the album suited Madonna well, but questioned her decision to make it a subsidiary for &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; instead of an independent release. Lucky Lara from &quot;Manila Standard Today&quot; denoted the album as a &quot;surprise career decision&quot; for Madonna and found that it showcased the singer&#x27;s versatility and other facets of her pop personality. She added that the album was able to prove that Madonna &quot;is cut out to do many other things, not just the trashy stuff&quot;. Writing for the &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot;, Liz Smith gave another positive review, calling the album &quot;excellent, different from anything [Madonna] has ever attempted&quot;, and listing the Sondheim songs as highlights.

Ray Boren from &quot;Deseret News&quot; was impressed with Madonna&#x27;s vocals, calling them &quot;sultry&quot; and &quot;cutesy&quot;, listing &quot;Vogue&quot; and &quot;Something to Remember&quot; as highlights. Greg Sandow of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; gave &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; an A rating, praising Madonna for &quot;invent[ing] a new Broadway vocal persona, built around a chest voice not yet perfectly under control but still much richer and duskier than her low range sounded before.&quot; Robert Christgau from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; said the record&#x27;s &quot;show-tune-pop-shlock&quot; suits Madonna &quot;with its pedigree of wit and musicality&quot;, as does the music&#x27;s campiness, which she &quot;sure knows how to do right&quot;. He listed &quot;Cry Baby&quot;, &quot;He&#x27;s a Man&quot; and &quot;Hanky Panky&quot; as the best tracks. Mark Coleman from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; gave the album a rating of three-and-a-half out of five stars and positive review, claiming that Madonna &quot;pulls it off with brass and panache&quot;. He added that &quot;Vogue&quot; showed the singer &quot;can still deliver that indefinable something extra&quot;. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine gave it four out of five stars, declaring: &quot;&quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; proves that Madonna is a true renaissance woman&quot;.

According to Jon Pareles of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;after all the nuances Madonna has brought to the role of the bad girl, it&#x27;s strange that she would settle now for such a restricted, unexamined version of respectability&quot; and &quot;for the first time, Madonna has let the deal dictate the music&quot;. Tan Gim Ean from &quot;New Straits Times&quot; noted that Madonna played against her strengths on the songs of the album. He described her vocals as &quot;competent&quot;, but felt that the songs required &quot;more range and agility than Madonna has at her disposal.&quot; Dave Tianen from &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; described the album as a &quot;mixed bag of period pieces, some of them too cute for their own good&quot;, adding that &quot;&quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; never becomes more than the sum of its mannerisms&quot;. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that the songs are just &quot;cutesy novelty numbers&quot;, and listing &quot;Vogue&quot; as a standout track. Rooksby panned the album, saying that it &quot;failed to transcend the sterile, preserved-in-amber quality of pastiche&quot;. Mark Cooper from &quot;Q&quot; magazine lamented, in its June 1990 review, &quot;It&#x27;s something of a disappointment because the lady herself stays so firmly committed to a character who&#x27;s less original than the persona she evolved during the &#x27;80s.&quot; Nonetheless, in the same magazine&#x27;s December 1994 issue, Madonna declared: &quot;I would have to say the favorite record that I&#x27;ve made is the soundtrack to &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. I love every one of those songs... My judgment is never based on the world&#x27;s reaction.&quot; &quot;Music Week&quot; staff called a &quot;mediocre soundtrack album&quot;.

While reviewing the album on its 30th anniversary, Mike Wass from Idolator wrote that its &quot;genius&quot; lied in the ability to &quot;find the middle ground between Broadway fare and top 40 pop&quot;, concluding that &quot;[Madonna] wasn&#x27;t trying to bend and twist into another genre, she simply dismantled it and took the bits and pieces that pleased her&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Joe Blistein deemed it one Madonna&#x27;s most &quot;fascinating&quot; albums; &quot;she could have easily recorded the three Sondheim songs for &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; and called it a day. Instead, she chose to deliver a record of big-band jazz and musical-theater pastiche&quot;. Nonetheless, he opined it wouldn&#x27;t become a &quot;forgotten classic&quot;, as the singer hasn&#x27;t performed any songs from the album in any of her tours since Blond Ambition. He did finish his review by expressing: &quot;[&quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot;] remains a compelling snapshot of a pivotal moment in Madonna&#x27;s life and career, when the world rolled in ecstasy at her feet and she had the power to push it any which way she wanted, to mold it to suit her ideal&quot;.

==Impact==
In &quot;The Soundtrack Album: Listening to Media&quot; (2020), editors explained that the trend of releasing albums with the concept &quot;Music From and Inspired By&quot; began &quot;in large part due to the success of Prince&#x27;s &quot;Batman&quot; album (1989) and Madonna&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot;&quot;. In his article titled, &quot;Madonna puts &#x27;30s in vogue&quot;, music critic Jon Pareles described that the record represented the tie-in as triple play, with the album, tour, and film promoting &quot;one another&quot;. However, upon release, &quot;Cashbox&quot; magazine referred the album marked the kick-off to &quot;the most opportunistic and protacted film soundtrack strategy ever mounted&quot;. With this release, Madonna brought back the glamour of the Prohibition era. Joe Blistein from &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; explained the album &quot;recalled the Prohibition era more than anything in the contemporary zeitgeist&quot;.

Contemporary and retrospective assessments specifically praised the results despite her musical reinvention, seen as departure from her &quot;main mass-market albums&quot;, according to O&#x27;Brien. Blistein described &quot;it was a decisively dizzying left turn for an artist who&#x27;d already built a solid career out of them&quot;. In at least one interview, she herself calls &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; her &quot;best&quot; and &quot;favorite&quot; of her albums because it was &quot;different&quot;. Macmillan Educational&#x27;s publication, &quot;International Year Book: Covering the Year 1990&quot;, deduced that the album performed &quot;surprisingly well, considering that its musical roots were in the 1940s&quot;. In &quot;Madonna: The Biography&quot; (1991), Robert Matthew-Walker notes the record contained the most songs on a Madonna&#x27;s album up to that point, also arguing it shows the &quot;immense outpouring of her talent&quot;. Others discussed how Madonna would introduce Stephen Sondheim to a newer audience in her generation, including Elizabeth Wurtzel from &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s Mark Coleman. In 2021, &quot;The Atlantic&quot; editor Sophie Gilbert, explicitly states she was introduced to Sondheim&#x27;s material thanks to Madonna. Albert Montagut from &quot;El País&quot; called a &quot;novelty&quot; the fact Warren Beatty recorded a song for an album for the first time in his career.

===Rankings===
&quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; was included in a number of critics&#x27; lists. The album appeared at number five in the 1990 Pazz &amp; Jop: Dean&#x27;s List of &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. The staff of &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; recognized the release as one of &quot;The 10 Best Albums of 1990&quot;, commenting that it is in this album &quot;where she truly started pushing outside her vocal comfort zone&quot;. &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; and Stacker named it one of the &quot;100 best movie and TV soundtracks of all time&quot;. Russell Ash included &quot;I&#x27;m Breathless&quot; in his Madonna&#x27;s albums ranking section in the book &quot;The Top 10 of Everything&quot; (1999). Entertainment website &quot;E! Online&quot; commented: &quot;The album is most fondly remembered for spawning one of Madge&#x27;s most successful and influential tracks, &#x27;Vogue&#x27;&quot;. The song &quot;Something to Remember&quot; was included in VH1&#x27;s list of &quot;Madonna&#x27;s 25 Most Underrated Deep Cuts And B-Sides&quot;. The Official Charts Company also included &quot;Back in Business&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;m Going Bananas&quot; among Madonna&#x27;s best deep cuts. Album&#x27;s tracks &quot;Sooner or Later&quot;, &quot;Something to Remember&quot; and &quot;Vogue&quot; were included in a rank of the best 100 Best Madonna Songs by &quot;Parade&quot; in 2023, with the latter topping the list.

<doc id="1109481" wikidata="Q5050617" url="?curid=1109481" title="Castleton, Greater Manchester">
<text>Castleton is an area of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, England, south-southwest of Rochdale town centre and north-northeast of the city of Manchester.

Historically a part of Lancashire, Castleton&#x27;s early history is marked by its status as a township within the ancient parish of Rochdale. Prior to merging with the County Borough of Rochdale in 1900, Castleton experienced rapid growth during the 19th century as a mill town in its own right, facilitated for the most part by the construction of the Rochdale Canal which is routed through the area. Castleton&#x27;s growth was significant; so much so, that for a time it was almost the same size of nearby Rochdale.

Located between junctions 19 and 20 of the M62 motorway, Castleton today is a predominantly residential area, with a total population of 9,715, increasing to 10,159 at the 2011 Census.

==History==

The most ancient known reference to Castleton is found in the Domesday Book (1086). The name suggests a link with a fortification; the Castleton area was the site of Rochdale Castle. The castle is believed to have been located on the south bank of the River Roch, which runs through Castleton.

During the 13th century, Castleton was known as &quot;Castletown&quot;, or &quot;Castle Town&quot;.

Back around the time the canal was built, Castleton was known as Blue Pits Village, because of the blue clay that was found and mined around the area that the railway is now. This information is on a tourist sign on the entrance to the canal off the Manchester bound side of Manchester Road.

The Rochdale Canal was routed through Castleton around the year 1800 and made Castleton one of the larger industrial areas in North West England. The canal granted jobs for hundreds of local residents, as it enabled the construction of several cotton mills. With the mills came the need for engineering and from 1892, Castleton was the home of Tweedales and Smalley who manufactured looms and textile machinery. Their Globe Works factory no longer exists, being part of the Woolworth&#x27;s site.

The Manchester and Leeds Railway Company (later the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway) arrived in Castleton in 1839, and it was here that the line formerly diverged to Bury, Ramsbottom, Rawtenstall, Bacup and finally rejoined the main line at Rochdale. Castleton&#x27;s railway area was one of the last mainstays of steam, being a huge resource of freight.

Castleton Hall was a country house belonging to the Holtes; it was built in the Elizabethan period and enlarged in 1719. It was occupied in the late nineteenth century by the &quot;Joyful News Training Home and Mission&quot;, now Cliff College, which moved from Castleton to its current location at Calver in Derbyshire under the direction of the Wesleyan Methodist Church in 1904.

In 1903, Whipp &amp; Bourne Ltd. was founded by Samuel Whipp and Charles Bourne to manufacture electrical switchgear. The company closed its factory in Castleton, in 2007.

In 1913, the Dunlop Rubber company began building a vast textile mill complex at Castleton. At its peak the mill employed over 3,000 workers. Most of the mill was demolished in 1979. Dunlop Textiles ceased trading in 2005.

==Governance==
Lying within the historic county boundaries of Lancashire from a very early time, Castleton constituted a township within the ancient parish of Rochdale, in Salford hundred. During this time, Castleton stretched beyond what is now recognised as its boundaries, including with it the localities of Balderstone, Captain Fold, Hartly, Marland and Newburn.

In 1865, part of Castleton was transferred to the newly created Municipal Borough of Rochdale, in 1866 Castleton became a separate civil parish, in 1894 the parish was abolished to form Castleton by Rochdale, part also went to Rochdale, Heywood and Milnrow. In 1891 the parish had a population of 38,509. Following local government reorganisation in 1894, Castleton, though lying wholly within the administrative county of Lancashire, remained divided on this basis, forming two local government districts; &quot;County Borough of Rochdale&quot; and &quot;Castleton-by-Rochdale&quot;. Castleton-by-Rochdale was renamed to &quot;Castleton Urban District&quot; in 1896, and four years later in 1900, was abolished (as part of a mutual agreement between local councillors) split and transferred to the neighbouring Rochdale and Heywood local government districts.

As part of the provisions of the Local Government Act 1972, the former county boroughs and urban districts were abolished, and Castleton was given to the newly formed Metropolitan Borough of Rochdale within the metropolitan county of Greater Manchester.

==Economy==
Castleton was home to a large Woolworth&#x27;s warehouse and office block, based on Royle Barn Road. The site is now closed following the failure of the Woolworths group. This mill is close to Arrow Mill, which is almost adjacent on Queensway. Royle Barn Road links Castleton with Sudden, emerging near the Tesco supermarket.

Castleton is without any banks as they were all closed in the late 1980s/early 1990s. Carcraft was based there, on the former site of Asda but has now closed down.

==Landmarks==

Castleton is home to St. Martin&#x27;s C of E church. This example of religious Victorian architecture still stands tall to this very day. It was completed in 1863 and closed in 1991. It was refurbished in 2002/2003.

Castleton&#x27;s main apparent architecture is that of the old Victorian style terraces, however there are some renovated areas.

==Transport==

Castleton railway station serves the local community at Castleton, and lies on the Caldervale Line (which connects Castleton to Manchester and Leeds).

Until March 2007, Castleton was home to a Corus steel works. It was built on the site of the former British Railways Castleton Central Materials Depot.
In 1954 the Marshalling Ward consisted of four sidings between Castleton East Junction and Castleton North Junction. There was however a further seven sidings on the &quot;Down&quot; side and nine sidings on the &quot;Up&quot; side for wagon storage.

Castleton was originally the junction for the branch line to Heywood, which was then extended through Bury to Bolton. A connecting line (known as the Bury South Junction Connecting Line or Bury East Fork) enabled trains off the Castleton to Bolton line to run northwards from Bury on the Clifton Junction to Accrington line. The Bacup line left the Clifton Junction to Accrington line at Stubbins Junction. Therefore, the remaining Castleton to Rawtenstall line is combination of remnants of several lines.

The Rochdale Canal runs through Castleton, adjacent to the railway on one side, and Queensway on the other. The road passes over the canal via an old brick bridge, which was refurbished along with the canal. Castleton is also home to two of the canal&#x27;s locks, as it goes on a down gradient through Slattocks and on its way into Manchester city centre.

==Sports==
Castleton has its own rugby league and football clubs. Rochdale Mayfield A.L.R.F.C. (formerly &quot;Mayfield&quot;) play rugby league at Castleton Sports Centre. Rochdale Town F.C. (formerly Castleton Gabriels) were also based at the same ground. They played in the North West Counties Football League First Division.

==Education==
Castleton has three primary schools: Castleton County Primary School, St. Edward&#x27;s Primary School and St. Gabriel&#x27;s RC Primary School. Castleton Primary School is by far the most memorable by Castleton&#x27;s older residents, as it was built in 1902 and opened to the public as &#x27;Castleton Board School&#x27; in 1903. The school&#x27;s external secondary assembly hall/sporting equipment annex was demolished in 2003 to make way for a better building.

<doc id="1109483" wikidata="Q1156917" url="?curid=1109483" title="Mario Power Tennis">
<text>Mario Power Tennis is a 2004 sports game developed by Camelot Software Planning and published by Nintendo for the GameCube. The game is the sequel to the Nintendo 64 title &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, and is the fourth game in the &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; series. The game was ported for the Wii in 2009 as part of the &quot;New Play Control!&quot; series, and was also re-released as a Nintendo Selects title in 2012. A companion handheld game, &quot;Mario Tennis: Power Tour&quot;, was also released on Game Boy Advance around the same time as the original GameCube release, bearing the same title as &quot;Power Tennis&quot; in Europe.

&quot;Power Tennis&quot; incorporates multiple characters, themes, and locations from the &quot;Mario&quot; series. The game includes standard tennis matches, but contains variants that feature different scoring formats and objectives. Other variants include &quot;Gimmick&quot; courts, thematic areas with components and properties that directly affect gameplay. The game has 18 playable characters, each categorised by their style of play and each with a pair of unique moves known as &quot;Power Shots&quot;. &quot;Power Tennis&quot; was developed simultaneously with &quot;Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour&quot;, and the pair shared similar technology and concepts with each other during production. Such similarities include an emphasis on the &quot;Mario&quot; theme in characters and settings as well as alternative game modes such as &quot;Ring Shot&quot;.

The GameCube version was positively received in general, attaining an aggregate score of 81 percent from GameRankings and 80 out of 100 from Metacritic. Critics praised the game&#x27;s depth and variety, but criticised the Power Shot animations, which could not be skipped. The Wii version in contrast received a more mixed reaction, with praise for the graphics and multiplayer but criticism for its motion controls. In 2010, it was included as one of the games in the book &quot;1001 Video Games You Must Play Before You Die&quot;.

==Gameplay==

&quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot; includes variations of tennis matches consisting of characters, courts, and scenarios based on the &quot;Mario&quot; series. The range of courts includes the standard three types of tennis court, but consists predominantly of those themed upon games in the &quot;Mario&quot; series, known as &quot;Gimmick&quot; courts. As well as adopting the style aesthetically, these feature thematic elements that influence how the match will be played on that surface, such as the ghosts in the &quot;Luigi&#x27;s Mansion&quot; court, which hinder movement when the character comes into physical contact with them. Although standard tennis is available, variants of the sport can be played which adopt different rules and methods of victory. &quot;Ring Shot&quot; involves the player earning points by hitting the ball through rings of varying sizes, with the number of points dependent on the difficulty of the shot. The player acquires the points whenever a winning shot is made adhering to standard rules; the match is won once the predetermined number of points is equaled or surpassed. A similar mode, &quot;Item Battle&quot;, involves the characters using items based on the &quot;Mario&quot; universe to interfere with each other&#x27;s game and gain an advantage.
The central mode of the game is &quot;Tournament Mode&quot;, which comprises a set of events with accumulating difficulty. This set of events must be finished successfully to unlock playable characters. This mode can be completed either in &quot;doubles&quot; or &quot;singles&quot;, and is divided into Gimmick courts and standard courts. An alternative to these are &quot;Special Games&quot;, which involve the player trying to meet a tennis-related objective on a Gimmick court. These Special Games come in multiple forms, incorporating themes from past Nintendo games, such as &quot;Tic-Tac-Glow&quot;, which requires the player to hit balls of water to liberate Shine Sprites trapped in dirt, a reference to &quot;Super Mario Sunshine&quot;. &quot;Power Tennis&quot; supports the option for four-player multiplayer, which can be accessed during &quot;Exhibition Mode&quot;, the standard mode of play where the player can choose his or her opponents and the conditions of the match. Such options include the difficulty of the opponent, the court used, and the number of games and sets required to win the match.

&quot;Power Tennis&quot; features 18 playable characters, all of whom derive from the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise. Many characters, such as Wario, had already appeared in the game&#x27;s predecessor and several other &quot;Mario&quot; spin-offs, while this was the first appearance for Wiggler as a playable character. All of the characters are categorised into six groups that reflect their playing style: all-around, technical, power, speed, defensive, and tricky. Inherent in each character is a set of two unique moves known as &quot;Power Shots&quot;. These powerful moves, which are accompanied with an animation each time they are triggered, incorporate the character&#x27;s specific qualities. They can only be triggered occasionally in the match, but will usually result in defending or scoring a point, depending on the type of shot chosen. Generic tennis moves, such as slices, dropshots, and lobs, can be applied at any time in the match.

==Development==
&quot;Power Tennis&quot; was developed by Camelot Software Planning, with a team of approximately 30 people, headed by brothers Hiroyuki and Shugo Takahashi. The game was first unveiled in a 2002 issue of the Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot;, and was later presented at the E3 conference of 2004. Before release, the brothers discussed multiple developmental processes in an interview with &quot;Famitsu&quot;. Camelot had been working on a previous GameCube version of &quot;Mario Tennis&quot;, but discontinued the project and began again using ideas and technology from &quot;Mario Golf: Toadstool Tour&quot;, which was being developed simultaneously with the game. Shugo noted that the original would have been more serious and contained deeper gameplay, but with fewer &quot;&quot;Mario&quot;-esque&quot; gimmicks. There was also a willingness not to update the graphics only without exploring advancements to concepts and gameplay, which Hiroyuki stated would be &quot;unacceptable for a &quot;Mario&quot; game&quot;. Due to the success of its predecessor, the brothers felt pressure to make a game that was original and would not appear too similar to its predecessor on first sight.

Following release, &quot;IGN&quot; interviewed Hiroyuki regarding the development of the game. He revealed that Camelot had received co-operation from Nintendo in relation to voice acting and animation, which Takahashi stated as &quot;contributing quite a bit to the improvement of the game&#x27;s graphics&quot;. Takahashi proceeded to explain why the role-playing game elements that were present in &quot;Mario Tennis&quot; were excluded from &quot;Power Tennis&quot;, stating that he felt they were more suitable for the &quot;deep single-player experience&quot; present in portable consoles. Regarding the themed courts in the game, he explained that the concepts were conceived during long brainstorming sessions, with courts selected that would both remind gamers of older &quot;Mario&quot; games and introduce new gamers to &quot;Mario&quot; games they may not have played. When questioned regarding difficulties in developing the game, Takahashi noted the effort used in making the opening sequences, developing the Special Games, and animations, which caused problems with meeting the schedule. Although there was speculation about online capabilities before release, Takahashi refrained from making the game online-compatible due to fear of lagging problems, stating &quot;I don&#x27;t think you can play a tennis game online under the current Internet environment and feel satisfied&quot;.

Nintendo collaborated with the Lawn Tennis Association in 2005 to promote &quot;Power Tennis&quot; in the United Kingdom. The promotion featured on-site sampling and official Nintendo branding at various tennis events such as Wimbledon. The LTA&#x27;s &quot;ACE Magazine&quot; advertised &quot;Power Tennis&quot; and featured competitions offering the game as a prize. Nintendo also released an online questionnaire regarding players&#x27; habits and preferences in relation to tennis as a part of their &quot;Who Are You?&quot; campaign. Nintendo announced in 2008 that they would be re-releasing the title as part of their New Play Control! selection, which feature added Wii controls. The game can be controlled using the Wii Remote and optional Nunchuk attachment, allowing the player to trigger actions such as forehands and backhands by swinging the Remote like a tennis racket. It was released on January 15, 2009, in Japan and in March 2009 in other countries. It was later re-released in North America on June 10, 2012, along with &quot;Pikmin 2&quot; as Nintendo Selects titles.

==Reception==

The GameCube version of &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot; enjoyed a generally positive reception, with reviewers complimenting the variety of play and multiple minigames available. &quot;GameSpot&quot; named it 2004&#x27;s &quot;Best Alternative Sports Game&quot; across all platforms. &quot;GameSpy&quot;″s Raymond Padilla lauded the game&#x27;s use of characters and the player categories, stating &quot;When you put it all together, you have a broad cast of characters, each of whom offers a different feel.&quot; Despite this, the Gimmick courts were labeled by Matt Casamassina as a &quot;distraction&quot; and &quot;annoyance&quot;, although he acknowledged that some courts were better than others. Additionally, &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot;&#x27;s Michael Cole thought that most players would revert to standard courts &quot;after being &#x27;unfairly defeated&#x27; by ghosts, paint, or some other trap.&quot; &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Tom Bramwell welcomed &quot;Power Tennis&quot;″s style, which he said emphasized gameplay over simulation and realism. When comparing the game to its predecessor, reviewers praised &quot;Power Tennis&quot; for its incorporation of the &quot;Mario&quot; franchise in the different scenarios and courts.

The gameplay features introduced to the game received a mixed response. &quot;IGN&quot; noted that the Special Games varied in quality between different games, with Casamassina commenting that &quot;they certainly don&#x27;t make or break the experience.&quot; The game&#x27;s &quot;Power Shots&quot; was also met with an ambivalent reaction—the shot themselves were praised for adding strategy and character, although GameSpot&#x27;s Ryan Davis commented that &quot;it would have been nice if you could just skip past the animations and keep the wild moves.&quot; In general, the game&#x27;s multiplayer modes were more popular than single-player, with the &quot;predictable and basic&quot; artificial intelligence contributing to a low difficulty level at times. &quot;GameSpy&quot; noted how the number of options and variables enhanced the multiplayer experience, and commented that &quot;The game is very good on its own, but it excels when you bring friends into the mix.&quot; The mechanics of the tennis gameplay were also popular, with reviewers lauding the game&#x27;s accessibility as well as its depth relating to the variety of shots available and how the position of the character affects the contact with the ball.

Most critics praised &quot;Power Tennis&quot;″s presentation, with reviewers noting the game&#x27;s opening sequence especially. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; complimented the level of detail given to the themed locations and character animations, stating that it &quot;[puts] even the &quot;Mario Kart&quot; series to shame.&quot; &quot;IGN&quot; generally shared this view, although they criticised the background animations, commenting that &quot;The crowds in particular are a repeating blob of the same sprites over and over&quot;. On the other hand, the audio received a mediocre response, despite the comical voice acting. &quot;Power Tennis&quot; sold 139,000 copies during its first week of release in Japan, and sold 377,000 copies altogether in the country from release to December 31, 2006. &quot;Power Tennis&quot; had sold 296,893 units in North America by January 31, 2005. The game was at fifth position in the Australian GameCube sales charts from October 16 to October 29, 2005. During the 8th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards, &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot; received a nomination for &quot;Console Action Sports Game of the Year&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences.

In spite of the mostly positive reception the GameCube version held, the reception for the Wii remake was mixed. It holds an average score of 65/100 and 68.19% at Metacritic and GameRankings respectively. While it has been praised for the original game&#x27;s graphics holding up to current Wii games, many editors have found fault in the controls. &quot;IGN&quot; editor Mark Bozon criticized its motion controls, describing them as imprecise, for ruining a &quot;great game&quot;. &quot;X-Play&quot; editor Dana Vinson similarly disliked the controls, also describing the act of releasing GameCube titles for the Wii with motion controls as being lazy. &quot;GamePro&quot; editor Dave Rudden criticized the game for adding multiple moves into Wii Remote motions, commenting that it would have to be &quot;twice as responsive&quot; for it to work. &quot;Eurogamer&quot; editor Oli Welsh criticized both the inaccurate controls and limited improvements, stating that &quot;Wii Sports&quot; is a superior alternative. While &quot;GameDaily&quot; editor Robert Workman criticized the motion controls, he stated that everything else works. He also describes it as being mildly enjoyable with three other friends.

In spite of the negative reception, the Wii version has had some positive reception. While &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine UK&quot; editor Tom East similarly bemoaned the motion controls, he felt that the multiplayer still held up, as it becomes balanced since the other players would have the same problems with the controls. &quot;1UP.com&quot; editor Justin Haywald agreed, stating that while it made single player modes difficult, the game was meant to be played with friends. &quot;Game Informer&quot; editor Matt Helgeson, however, found the motion controls to be good, commenting that other developers should learn from Nintendo. In spite of this, fellow &quot;Game Informer&quot; editor Matthew Kato described the controls as being only so-so. GameShark editor Danielle Riendeau, however, described the controls as excellent, though adding that it occasionally misreads her shots. In the first four days of the Wii version&#x27;s release in Japan, &quot;Mario Power Tennis&quot; sold 56,000 copies. By January 3, 2010, it had sold 205,070 copies in Japan.

<text>The Telemachy (from Greek Τηλεμάχεια, &quot;Tēlemacheia&quot;) is a term traditionally applied to the first four books of Homer&#x27;s epic poem the &quot;Odyssey&quot;. They are named so because, just as the &quot;Odyssey&quot; tells the story of Odysseus, they tell the story of Odysseus&#x27;s son Telemachus as he journeys from home for the first time in search of news about his missing father.

==The &quot;Telemachy&quot; as an introduction to the &quot;Odyssey&quot;==

The &quot;Odyssey&quot; is a &quot;nostos&quot; that recalls the story of Odysseus&#x27; journey home to Ithaca, finally completed twenty years after the Trojan War began. Odysseus, however, does not directly appear in the narrative until Book 5. Instead, the &quot;Telemachy&quot;″s subject is the effect of Odysseus&#x27; absence on his family, Telemachus in particular. The first four books of the &quot;Odyssey&quot; give the reader a glimpse of the goings-on at the palace in Ithaca. There are a multitude of suitors vying for Penelope&#x27;s hand in marriage, consuming the absent king&#x27;s estate. They have been a terrible drain on the family&#x27;s wealth, as they have been nearly permanent houseguests while Penelope put off her choice for three to four years. A brooding Telemachus wants to eject the suitors, and in fact announces his intention to do so; but he is not strong enough to act on the threat. Homer thus provides Telemachus with a motive for leaving Ithaca, and the reader with this portrait of Ithaca to place Odysseus&#x27; homecoming in context and to underscore the urgency of his journey.

== Telemachus&#x27; Rites of Passage==

Homeric scholarship generally recognizes the &quot;Telemachy&quot; as the story of its eponymous hero&#x27;s journey from boyhood to manhood. It is only after having gone through this journey that Telemachus will be equipped to help Odysseus kill the suitors in Book 22. His first step toward Homer&#x27;s ideal of manhood is a figurative one: in Book 1 Penelope tries to dictate what songs a bard should sing for the suitors. Telemachus (345ff.) admonishes her, and directs her to go back to her room; this signals the first time that Telemachus asserts himself as the head of the household in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;.

In Book 2 Telemachus further tries to assert his authority when he calls an Assembly and demands that the suitors leave his estate. But since Telemachus is, in his own words (61-2), &quot;a weakling knowing nothing of valor,&quot; the suitors refuse, blaming Penelope for their staying so long. Telemachus then announces his intention to visit Sparta and Pylos in search of news about his father. This first journey away from home is an important part of the figurative journey from boyhood to manhood.

In Book 3 Telemachus is schooled in the ancient Greek social contract between hosts and their houseguests. The concept, called &quot;xenia&quot;, is simple: the host should offer the houseguest anything he wants, and the houseguest should not abuse this generosity, for he might find himself playing the part of host in the future. Nestor, the king of Pylos, exemplifies this social contract. Furthermore, Nestor&#x27;s storytelling allows Homer to relate myths that fall outside of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;&#x27;s purview. He reflects on the Trojan War, praising Odysseus for his cunning. Telemachus begins to learn and appreciate what kind of man his father was. The story Nestor tells of Orestes in particular serves as a model for Telemachus to emulate: just as Orestes killed the overbearing suitor who occupied his father Agamemnon&#x27;s estate, so should Telemachus kill the suitors and reclaim his own father&#x27;s estate.

In Book 4 Telemachus visits Menelaus in Sparta. Through the story-telling of Menelaus, Homer further narrates myths of the Trojan War that are not strictly the Odyssey&#x27;s purview. Menelaus tells Telemachus of his own detour in Egypt on his way home from the Trojan War, during which he learned that Odysseus is still alive, a virtual captive of the nymph Calypso. His wife Helen recalls one of Odysseus&#x27; exploits during the war, which prompts Menelaus to tell his own story about Odysseus&#x27; heroism in the war. These tales of bravery and cunning both further educate Telemachus about his father, and serve as further examples of heroism to which he should aspire. The story of Orestes is revisited, again, to inspire Telemachus to take action against the suitors. Telemachus takes his own steps toward manhood when he leaves Sparta. Whereas he arrived at Pylos afraid to even speak to Nestor, upon leaving Menelaus he has enough confidence in himself to ask for a gift more appropriate for an inhabitant of rocky Ithaca. Menelaus obliges, and exchanges the chariot and team of horses he had given him for a wine bowl made by Hephaestus. Telemachus then begins his journey back home. But in Ithaca, the suitors have decided to ambush and kill Telemachus before he reaches his (669) &quot;measure of manhood&quot; and begin making trouble for them: in Book 2 Telemachus is considered a boy who poses no threat; by the end of Book 4 they fear his becoming a man who could stand up to them. The &quot;Telemachy&quot; abruptly draws to a close with this cliffhanger, the Suitors setting an ambush for Telemachus at a harbour.

Typically, in the hero&#x27;s journey he will receive occasional aid from a mentor figure. In the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Athena serves as mentor to both Odysseus and Telemachus. In Book 1 she visits Telemachus disguised as the mortal Mentes to spur the young man to action. She alternately advises Telemachus in the guise of a man actually named Mentor—hence the word &quot;mentor&quot; in English.

===Capstone to &quot;Telemachy&quot;===
Near the end of the &quot;Odyssey&quot;, Telemachus demonstrates his decisiveness and independence by hanging the disloyal women slaves, instead of killing them by sword, for the sake of his honor.

==Foreshadowing in the &quot;Telemachy&quot;==
The Orestes paradigm treated above is perhaps the most overt example of foreshadowing events in the &quot;Odyssey&quot;″s later books. The stories told about Odysseus serve a similar purpose. In the &quot;Telemachy&quot; both Nestor and Menelaus praise Odysseus for his cunning. In telling of his own detour in Egypt, Menelaus emphasizes how the use of cunning and subterfuge were instrumental in his return to Sparta. It was only by hiding under a seal skin that he was able to ambush and capture Proteus, the only one who can direct Menelaus how to reach home. Although the scheme was not of Menelaus&#x27; devising, it does demonstrate that while the battlefield inspires bravery from its heroes, wily cunning also has its place when the situation demands. These recollections of stealth and subterfuge point to the tactics that Odysseus will eventually employ upon his return to Ithaca.

<doc id="1109485" wikidata="Q540201" url="?curid=1109485" title="Market Square Heroes">
<text>&quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; is the debut single by the British neo-prog band Marillion, released in October 1982 with &quot;Three Boats Down from the Candy&quot; as the B-side. The 12-inch single included an additional track, the 17:15-minute-long &quot;Grendel&quot;.

==Themes==
The A-side is an anthemic rock song whose lyric vaguely describes the rise of civil unrest under some charismatic leader in the face of increasing unemployment; the original title was &quot;UB 2,000,001&quot;. According to Marillion&#x27;s singer and lyricist Fish, the &quot;market square hero&quot; is a &quot;would-be revolutionary with all the necessary charisma and presence of a leader without direction or goals, just a sense of frustration and anger&quot;. The track was the band&#x27;s &quot;first attempt at deliberately writing a hit record and a &#x27;simple&#x27; rock song to juxtapose against our meandering but dynamic &#x27;epics&#x27;.&quot;

Members of the band have attributed the inspiration behind the main character in the song lyrics to a person they knew in Aylesbury who went by the nickname of &#x27;Brick&#x27;. In a 2009 interview, Mark Kelly stated: &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether Brick was a leftie, a militant or a skinhead but he was the inspiration for the character singing, &#x27;I&#x27;m a Market Square Hero&#x27;&quot;. Fish made reference to this theme and introduced Brick as a &quot;leftie hero&quot; before he performed the song with his former Marillion bandmates in Aylesbury at the &#x27;Hobble on the Cobbles&#x27; concert in 2007. Brick died in 2011.

===B-sides===
Musically, &quot;Three Boats Down from the Candy&quot; (the first song co-written by keyboardist Mark Kelly) and &quot;Grendel&quot; are more typical of the progressive rock style. &quot;Grendel&quot; is a long and complex composition which has drawn frequent (mostly unfavourable) comparisons with &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; by Genesis. As Fish himself admitted later:

Inspired by the John Gardner novel &quot;Grendel&quot; (1971), the lyric looks at the Beowulf myth from the perspective of the monster. Until 2012, neither Marillion nor Fish had ever played the track live after 1983. In spite (or possibly because) of this, it has developed into a cult favourite among die-hard fans; it is not uncommon to hear someone in the audience yell &quot;Grendel!&quot; at Marillion&#x27;s or Fish&#x27;s concerts even in the late 2000s.

Having categorically refused to play &quot;Grendel&quot; again for almost 30 years, Fish did so at a fan club convention held on 20 October 2012 in Leamington Spa. He performed it on the second day of the convention as well, 21 October, as an encore.

==Production==
The record was produced by Dave Hitchcock, who had also produced the Genesis album &quot;Foxtrot&quot; with &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; on it. Hitchcock was also contracted to produce Marillion&#x27;s upcoming debut album, but was heavily injured in a car accident when he drove home in a state of physical exhaustion after finishing work on the single. EMI used this occasion to convince the band to replace him with Nick Tauber, a more &quot;modern&quot; producer best known for his work with Toyah.

===Cover art===
The cover art was designed by Mark Wilkinson, who went on to create all Marillion artwork until 1988 and most of Fish&#x27;s solo artwork after that. The cover introduced two distinctive visual elements that would identify the band in the years to come: the figure of the &quot;Jester&quot; and the logo, designed by Jo Mirowski.

===Variations===
The radio edit replaces the line &quot;I am your Antichrist&quot; with &quot;I am your battle priest&quot;.

==Reception==
The single did not enter the upper reaches of the UK singles charts, peaking at no. 60; however, sales remained stable for some time due to people backtracking on the strength of later, more successful releases. The song came fourth in &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine&#x27;s Singles of the Year 1982.

==Subsequent releases==
A limited edition (3,000 copies) picture disk of the 12&quot; for &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; was released by EMI at the start of their picture disc campaign in March 1983.
None of the tracks on this release were included on Marillion&#x27;s debut album &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot;, which appeared in early 1983. Re-recorded versions of &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; and &quot;Three Boats Down from the Candy&quot; with the band&#x27;s short-termed drummer John Marter would form the B-side to the 1984 single &quot;Punch and Judy&quot;. These re-recorded versions would later be included on the 1988 compilation album &quot;B&#x27;Sides Themselves&quot;, along with &quot;Grendel&quot;; &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; is also on the 1997 compilation &quot;The Best of Both Worlds&quot;.

The original single versions of &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; and &quot;Three Boats Down from the Candy&quot; would eventually become available on CD in 1997, when EMI released them on the bonus CD of the remastered &quot;Script for a Jester&#x27;s Tear&quot; album. A CD replica of the single was also part of a collectors box-set released in July 2000 which contained Marillion&#x27;s first twelve singles, and the subsequent facsimile of the collectors box-set, &quot;The Singles &#x27;82-&#x27;88&quot;.

===Live versions===

The first time that a version of &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; would become available on an album was on the 1984 live album &quot;Real to Reel&quot;, although a live version of &quot;Three Boats Down from the Candy&quot;, recorded at the 1982 Reading Festival, was included on the &quot;Reading Rock&quot; festival album.

All three tracks also appear on the albums &quot;Early Stages&quot; (2008) and &quot;Recital of the Script&quot; (2009), and &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; is on &quot;Live from Loreley&quot; (2009).

On 26 August 2007, Fish performed &quot;Market Square Heroes&quot; at the Hobble on the Cobbles festival in the market square of Aylesbury, the original &quot;setting&quot; of the song in the town where Marillion was formed. The other members of classic line-up of the band joined Fish on stage for this song. This surprise one-off reunion was the first occasion the 1984–88 lineup has shared one stage since the split in 1988.

<text>USS &quot;Cabrilla&quot; (SS/AGSS-288), a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine, was a ship of the United States Navy named for the cabrilla, an edible fish inhabiting the Mediterranean Sea and waters off the coast of California.

&quot;Cabrilla&quot; (SS-288) was launched 24 December 1942 by Portsmouth Navy Yard in Kittery, Maine; sponsored by Mrs. L. B. Combs; commissioned 24 May 1943 and reported to the Pacific Fleet.

&quot;Cabrilla&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor on 30 August 1943, and on 12 September cleared on the first of eight war patrols. After a daring exploit in which four Filipino guerrillas were taken off Negros Island, &quot;Cabrilla&quot; completed her patrol at Fremantle, Australia, her base for the next five patrols.

During her second patrol, &quot;Cabrilla&quot; laid mines in the Gulf of Siam, and sank her first Japanese merchantman, then returned to Fremantle to prepare for her third patrol, a reconnaissance of Sunda Strait. Her fourth and fifth patrols, off Makassar, and in the Celebes and Sulu Seas, found her again striking with telling results against Japanese merchant shipping.

The most successful of her patrols was the sixth, in the South China Sea, and off Luzon from 13 September to 25 October 1944. During this period, she sank a total of 24,557 tons of shipping, including a 10,059-ton tanker. &quot;Cabrilla&quot; made her seventh war patrol in vicious weather in the Kurile Islands of northern Japan, and her last patrol found her on lifeguard duty for aviators downed at sea while carrying out attacks on Japan.

Homeward-bound after 2 arduous years, &quot;Cabrilla&quot; cleared Fremantle on 31 August 1945 for the States. Following overhaul at Philadelphia, she sailed for the Canal Zone for exercises (19 February – 17 March 1946), then underwent pre-inactivation overhaul at Philadelphia. &quot;Cabrilla&quot; was placed out of commission in reserve on 7 August 1946 at the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, New London, CT, and laid up in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet.

&quot;Cabrilla&quot; was recommissioned and redesignated Auxiliary Submarine AGSS-288, in 1962. She was decommissioned on 30 June 1968 and simultaneously struck from the Naval Register. &quot;Cabrilla&quot; was subsequently designated to be a museum ship and temporarily opened as such at Galveston Texas. However, delays in preparing a permanent berth and the poor material condition of the sub compelled the memorial organizers to exchange &quot;Cabrilla&quot; for the &quot;Gato&quot;-class submarine &quot;Cavalla&quot;. In January 1971 &quot;Cabrilla&quot; was returned to the Navy, which sold her for scrapping in April 1972.

&quot;Cabrilla&quot; received six battle stars for World War II service. Of her eight patrols, six were designated as &quot;Successful War Patrols&quot;. She is credited with having sunk a total of 38,767 tons of shipping.

<text>The ABRSM (Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music) is an examination board and registered charity based in the United Kingdom. ABRSM is one of five examination boards accredited by Ofqual to award graded exams and diploma qualifications in music within the UK&#x27;s National Qualifications Framework (along with the London College of Music, RSL Awards (Rockschool Ltd), Trinity College London, and the Music Teachers&#x27; Board). &#x27;The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music&#x27; was established in 1889 and rebranded as ABRSM in 2009. The clarifying strapline &quot;the exam board of the Royal Schools of Music&quot; was introduced in 2012.

More than 600,000 candidates take ABRSM exams each year in over 90 countries. ABRSM also provides a publishing house for music which produces syllabus booklets, sheet music and exam papers and runs professional development courses and seminars for teachers.

ABRSM is one of the UK&#x27;s 200 largest charitable organisations ranked by annual expenditure.

==History==
The Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music was founded in 1889 when Alexander Mackenzie, then the Principal of the Royal Academy of Music, and George Grove, founding Director of the Royal College of Music, decided that the two institutions should combine to form an associated examining board to run joint local exams. The first syllabi were published in 1890 for Piano, Organ, Violin, Cello and Harp, with Viola, Double Bass and woodwind instruments added the following year. Originally, the ABRSM had only two grades and were the equivalent of the current grades 6 and 7. Due to the demand for beginner grades, the present structure (grades 1–8) was introduced in 1933. In 1947, the Royal Manchester College of Music (merged to form the present Royal Northern College of Music) and Royal Scottish Academy of Music (now the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland) joined ABRSM. Specifically, the Royal Schools referred to in ABRSM&#x27;s title are the Royal Academy of Music, the Royal College of Music, the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and the Royal Northern College of Music. 

Since the post-World War II years, the ABRSM saw an increase in overseas exam applications. The curriculum also expanded, with the addition of Guitar, Harpsichord, Voice, (with the option of both classical singing and singing for musical theatre), percussion, Recorder and all brass instruments. 

The 1990s saw percussion and jazz added to the syllabus. For Diplomas, LRSM was the one that was always available. The DipABRSM and FRSM were introduced much later in the year 2000 as well as similar exams for instructors and teachers. The ARSM was introduced in the year 2016–2017 to serve as a bridge between the Grade 8 and DipABRSM exams.

In 2023 ABRSM announced major revisions to their diploma syllabuses. The DipABRSM diplomas will be withdrawn and replaced by new ARSM Diplomas in teaching and directing, alongside the ARSM performance option currently offered. Additionally, the ARSM, LRSM, and FRSM syllabuses will be revised. The DIPABRSM was withdrawn due to being at the same rqf level as ARSM and having the same learning outcomes in essence as Ali Bowen Davies said. 

In 2024, Now the Diploma system is in 3 levels-ARSM, LRSM and FRSM. The Prerequisites for ARSM, LRSM and FRSM Performance are Grade 8 in the instrument. For ARSM in Directing and Teaching, there are no entry requirements. For LRSM in Teaching, you need ARSM Teaching or Grade 8 in the instrument. For LRSM Directing, you need ARSM Directing or Grade 8 in the instrument or Theory. For FRSM Directing, you need LRSM Directing. AND for FRSM Education, you need LRSM Teaching or ARSM Performance. There are subsitutions for Grade 8. But There are no subsitutions when it comes to ARSM and LRSM Diplomas as entry requirements for LRSM/FRSM. For Example, someone holding a ATCL/AMusa/ARCT cannot substitute ARSM Performance to enter FRSM Education. 

For marks, ARSM is 34/50 for Pass, 40/50 for Merit and 45/50 for distinction. LRSM and FRSM are 50/75 for Pass, 60/75 for Merit and 68/75 for Distinction. 

In Performance, ARSM candidates must present a 30 minute programme with at least 20 minutes selected from the ARSM List and up to 10 minutes of own choice repertoire of pieces at around Grade 8 standard or above. For LRSM, candidates have to play a 45 minute programme of at least 50 percent of repertoire must be from the LRSM List and up to 50% can be own choice of pieces of around ARSM Standard or above and write a 2000 word essay for Performance in Context having 4 options to write from. And for FRSM, you need to present a 55 minute recital which at least 50% of repertoire must be from the FRSM List and up to 50% can be own choice repertoire of pieces around LRSM Standard or above. You also must write a 3500 word essay on Research and Reflection having 4 options to write about. You do not have to pass each section to pass the overall diploma. 

The ABRSM Diplomas equivalencies are to College/University Courses:

ARSM-RQF Level 4-1st Year of Bachelors Degree/Higher National Certificate/Certificate of Higher Education 

LRSM-RQF Level 6-Bachelors Degree-Final year being 3rd or 4th year

FRSM-RQF Level 7-Masters Degree/Postgraduate Level

== Music Medals ==
Music Medals are QCA–accredited music assessments and teaching resources aimed at younger, group-taught learners. Music Medals are distinct from graded music exams in that no external examiners are involved and the initial assessment is made by the teacher.

==ABRSM equivalencies and Ofqual Regulated Qualifcations==

Ofqual is the regulator for ABRSM&#x27;s qualifications of Grades and the Diplomas. The Qualifications sit on the RQF Levels Framework and make people understand the equivalent level of each qualification of ABRSM and the difficulty. The TQT and credits indicates the Size of the Qualification and tell people how long a typical learner would take to complete the qualification. For TQT you just have to multiply the credits by 10. For example in Grade 8 Performance/Practical Grades the TQT is 32 times 10= 320 hours.

==ABRSM publications==
ABRSM published its first books in 1918 and its publishing department was first set up in 1921 and was designed to provide suitable music for examinations, performance editions of popular works and new instructional compositions. One of the original editors was Sir Donald Tovey, who wrote informative notes on the music which are still highly regarded today. ABRSM (Publishing) Ltd. was established as a separate company in 1985.

==ABRSM digital resources==
Since 2009 ABRSM has produced several practice applications to support teachers and students:

* Melody Writer – a tool designed to help improve melody writing and music theory knowledge and understanding
* Aural Trainer – an iPhone app that helps students practice their aural skills
* Speedshifter – a practice tool that allows students to vary the speed of audio without altering the pitch
* Piano Practice Partner – an app for iOS and Android devices that helps students practice exam pieces for piano at Grades 1 to 3. Piano Practice Partner plays one hand so that students can play the other as they learn.

==Ethnic diversity in syllabus==

In response to the Black Lives Matter movement, on 15 July 2020, the ABRSM syllabus came under public scrutiny for the lack of BAME representation in the 2019/20 syllabus. Over 4,000 people signed a petition which found &quot;255 pieces in the new piano syllabus&quot; to not include any black composers. Chi-chi Nwanoku &quot;described the &#x27;woeful lack&#x27; of ethnic diversity in the ABRSM syllabus as appalling&quot; with Scott Caizley also stating how &quot;the ABRSM should make its syllabuses less white if it was &quot;committed to seeing a more racially diverse intake of students entering conservatoires&quot;. The ABRSM&#x27;s spokesman responded to the criticism and said &quot;the death of George Floyd in the US had made it think deeply about its efforts to get more black composers in its syllabuses&quot;.

<text>Iceland Airwaves is a music festival held annually in November in Reykjavík, Iceland, since 1999. Its main focus is showcasing new music, both Icelandic and international.

==Background==
The event is promoted and produced by Iceland Music Export and sponsored by its founder, Icelandair, in cooperation with the City of Reykjavík.
In February 2018, the event managing company, Sena Live, bought the logo and all associated trademarks of Iceland Airwaves.

==History==
The first festival was held in October 1999 as a one-off event in an airplane hangar at Reykjavík Airport. In 2014, the event switched to being held in November.

In 2018, 50% of the performers at Iceland Airwaves were female, making the festival one of the first to include gender equality in its lineup.

In 2020 and 2021, the festival was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It was held in 2022 and 2023, with a three-day schedule instead of four, as in previous years.

<text>North Stradbroke Island (Jandai: Minjerribah), colloquially &quot;Straddie&quot; or &quot;North Straddie&quot;, is an island that lies within Moreton Bay in the Australian state of Queensland, southeast of the centre of Brisbane. Originally there was only one Stradbroke Island but in 1896 it split into North Stradbroke Island and South Stradbroke Island separated by the Jumpinpin Channel. The Quandamooka people are the traditional owners of North Stradbroke island.

The island is divided into four localities: Dunwich, Amity and Point Lookout are small localities centred on the towns of the same name, while the remainder of the island is in the locality of North Stradbroke Island. All the localities are within the City of Redland.

At , it is the second largest sand island in the world. On the island there are three small towns, a number of lakes and beaches along most of the seaward coastline with rocky outcrops at Point Lookout. An Aboriginal presence on the island has been long and ongoing, resulting in a successful native title determination. Tourism is a major and growing industry on the island. The island has been the site for sand mining for more than sixty years. Tourism and currently mining are the island&#x27;s main industries.

== Geography and ecology ==
North Stradbroke Island is the second largest sand island in the world. North Stradbroke, South Stradbroke and Moreton Island act as a barrier between Moreton Bay and the Coral Sea.

The island is about long and wide with an area of roughly and a maximum elevation of . The climate of North Stradbroke Island is sub-tropical with warm, moist summers and mild winters. Average annual rainfall is and mean annual maximum temperature is .

The population of the island at the was 2026, comprising 883 in Dunwich, 678 in Point Lookout, 348 in Amity, and 117 elsewhere on the island. The number of people on the island swells significantly during the holiday season. The island is only accessible by vehicular or passenger ferries leaving from Cleveland.

There are three townships on the island. Dunwich is the largest and has most of the island&#x27;s services including a school, medical centre, local museum and the University of Queensland&#x27;s Moreton Bay Research Station. Point Lookout (referred to locally as &#x27;the point&#x27;) is on the surf side of the island and is the major tourist destination in the holiday season. The third is Amity Point which is much smaller and a popular fishing spot on the island. Flinders Beach is a small settlement of mostly holiday houses located on the main beach between Amity and Point Lookout.
The whole of the island is part of the Redland City local government area, and is incorporated as part of Division 2. The two largest lakes on the island are Brown Lake and Blue Lake.

In January 2014, about 60% of the island&#x27;s bushland was consumed by bushfires, later to regenerate.

=== Beaches ===

Five main beaches provide fishing, surfing and water opportunities on North Stradbroke Island. These are Main Beach which is long and good for surfing, Cylinder Beach which is a protected swimming beach with a smaller swell, Home Beach which is popular with swimmers, Frenchmans Beach/Deadmans Beach with rock pools but no lifesaving service and Flinders Beach which offers good swimming and beach camping. Main Beach is also the location of the entry to the Keyhole Track, which is one of the top 4WD tracks near Brisbane. The entrance is near Point Lookout to the south.

=== Lakes, springs and wetlands ===

North Stradbroke Island has over 100 freshwater lakes and wetlands and contains significant groundwater resources which are accessed by local communities and a sand mining company, Australia. In addition, a significant volume of groundwater is exported to the mainland. There is a higher number of wetlands that have been in existence since the last ice age than anywhere else on the Australian mainland. While there is the potential for expanded groundwater use, because so little is known about groundwater-dependent water bodies and ecosystems any expanded groundwater use is suspended. Dependent ecosystems include freshwater and estuarine wetlands, mangrove and paperbark communities, and surface-water fauna. Many of the wetlands are places for threatened migratory wading birds, including 34 species listed by JAMBA and CAMBA Moreton Bay Ramsar area, Marine, migratory (EPBC Act).

==== Blue Lake ====
Blue Lake, one of the largest lakes on the island, is protected within the Naree Budjong Djara National Park and is of cultural significance to the Quandamooka people of Stradbroke Island. It is a spring-fed lake relying on the stable aquifer feeding it. This stable hydrology means it has been untouched by climate change and appears to be in the same condition as it was 7,500 years ago. Blue Lake has been an important climate &#x27;refuge&#x27; for the freshwater biota of the region, and with appropriate management, the lake could continue relatively unchanged for hundreds, possibly thousands of years to come.

==== Brown Lake ====
Brown Lake is a perched lake which retains its water due to a layer of leaves lining the lake floor and is of cultural significance to the Quandamooka people of Stradbroke Island. The precipitated matter eventually forms an impermeable layer, preventing water from percolating to the water table.

==== Eighteen Mile Swamp ====

The Eighteen Mile Swamp is the largest of its kind in the world and, in particular, is a fine and extensive representation of a coastal freshwater swamp. It is unusual for its size and dimensions (very long and narrow), covering and is considered to be very young (500–6,000 years) compared with similar swamps. On 27 March 2011, the area was declared a national park, named Naree Budjong Djara National Park, &quot;My Mother Earth&quot;, by the Quandamooka people, the traditional owners of Minjerribah (North Stradbroke Island), who are engaged in its joint management with the Queensland State government. The wetland is in close proximity to the extensive Enterprise Mine.

The Eighteen Mile Swamp is home to many endangered, rare species, including the vulnerable &quot;Cryptocarya foetida&quot; whose habitat is the notophyll vine forest found at the foot and lower slope of parabolic high dunes on the west of the wetland. These high dunes on the west of Eighteen mile swamp provide excellent examples of long parabolic dunes migrating across North Stradbroke island from the south-east to the north-west. This migration has buried earlier positions of the west coast escarpment to form complex hydrological systems with the ancient dunes (estimated at up to 300,000 years old). No comparative examples of the phenomenon are seen on Moreton and Fraser Islands.

==== Myora Springs and Myora Creek Swamp ====
Myora Springs is a unique wetland site on the north west side of North Stradbroke Island, of particular cultural significance to the Quandamooka people as a sacred gathering site, and is also a declared fish habitat area. Myora Springs is known to be essential habitat for the vulnerable water mouse (&quot;Xeromys myoides&quot;) and the endangered swamp orchid (&quot;Phaius australis&quot;).

==== Lake Kounpee ====
Another perched lake, Lake Kounpee was partially drained after sand mining operations breached the impervious layer in 1987. CRL spent over $300,000 in the 10 years following this in attempts to fix the damage, and now acknowledge they can not repair the damage to the lake – &quot;turning a clear freshwater lake into a reedy waterhole&quot;.

==== Other lakes and wetlands ====
Other perched lakes include Black Snake Lagoon, Ibis lagoon (whose melaleuca community is unique in structure and floristics from other melaleuca areas on the island), Welsby Lagoon, Native Companion Lagoon and the ephemeral Tortoise Lagoon within the Naree Budjong Djara National Park. Amity swamp suffered, in 1991, when up to 100,000 litres of diesel spilled from the sand mining company, Consolidated Rutile Limited [CRL]. This was not reported until 1994, the same year CRL was awarded a commendation in the inaugural &quot;State Government Award for Environmental Excellence&quot;. It was not until 1997 that the incident was acknowledged in CRL&#x27;s &quot;Annual Report&quot; stating that the spill was expected to be cleared by 1999 – eight years after it occurred. The sand mining company was never fined by the Department of Mines and Energy for these environmental incidents and continues operating.
Flinders Swamp and its drainage lines is home to the rare acid frog (&quot;Litotia cooloolensis&quot;) and the area includes habitats for relict populations of the burrowing skink (&quot;Anomalopus truncatus&quot;). The Keyholes are a series of clear, freshwater lakes at the northern end of the 18 Mile Swamp popular with visiting canoeists. As the Yarraman Mine is now operating close to these lakes, public access has been closed, as it is a prohibited mining area.

== Fauna ==

North Stradbroke Island is home to rare, vulnerable, endangered and near threatened animals.

Examples include:
# Migratory wading birds, including 34 species listed by JAMBA and CAMBA Moreton Bay Ramsar area.
# Wallum froglet (&quot;Crinia tinnula&quot;): These occur at Dunwich, Amity, Yarraman Lakes, Blue Lake, Eighteen Mile Swamp, Brown Lake, Amity Swamp, Tortoise Lagoon and Flinders Beach Wetlands.
# Cooloola sedge frog (&quot;Litoria cooloolensis&quot;): These occur at Eighteen Mile Swamp, north of the causeway, Brown Lake, Dunwich, Point Lookout, Tortoise Lagoon, Blue Lake, Welsby Lagoon and Yarraman Lakes. The population of &quot;L. cooloolensis&quot; on North Stradbroke Island has also been called &quot;Litoria sp. cf. cooloolensis&quot; (North Stradbroke Is) and may represent an unnamed species endemic to the island, as it is genetically distinct and has a different mating call from the other population of &quot;L. cooloolensis&quot; on the Sunshine Coast.
# Oxleyan pygmy perch (&quot;Nannoperca oxleyana&quot;): There are two genetically distinct populations, east and west, but in very low abundance. The eastern population is at Eighteen Mile Swamp and Blue Lake, though only one specimen was collected there by McGregor et al. in 2008. The western population is at Little Canalpin Creek.

== Flora ==
There are 780 plant species recorded for the island, 599 native and 181 introduced species. Of these 14 species are classified as threatened or near threatened species under the &quot;Queensland Nature Conservation Act&quot; 1992, two of them are endemic to the island.

Examples include:
# Notophyll vine forest on parabolic high dunes: These occur on the foot and lower slope of high dunes on the west of Eighteen Mile Swamp, Swan Bay area and are the habitat for rare and threatened flora including &quot;Cryptocarya foetida&quot;.
# &quot;Acacia baueri&quot; Bauer&#x27;s wattle [vulnerable]: These occur in seasonally waterlogged sands in wallum areas such as Canalpin Swamp and Eighteen Mile Swamp.
# &quot;Durringtonia paludosa&quot; Durringtonia [near threatened]: These occur in Myora Swamp and Eighteen Mile Swamp, and, in 1993 Bostock and Thomas recorded the first specimens on NSI since 1935.
# &quot;Phaius australis&quot; swamp orchid [endangered]: These occur at Flinders Beach Wetlands, Myora and Eighteen Mile swamps.
# &quot;Thelypteris confluens&quot; soft swamp fern [vulnerable]: These occur found in permanently swamp areas associated with species of &quot;Baumea&quot; and &quot;Cladium&quot; at Flinders Beach Wetlands and Eighteen Mile Swamp.
# &quot;Arthraxon hispidus&quot; hairy-joint grass [vulnerable] may no longer be present on the island.
# &quot;Blandifordia grandiflora&quot; Christmas bells [endangered]
# &quot;Eleocarpus difformis&quot; underwater spikerush [endangered – endemic]
# &quot;Goodenia arenicola&quot; [presumed extinct]
# &quot;Olearia hygrophila&quot; swamp daisy [endangered – endemic]
# &quot;Persicaria elatior&quot; smartweed [vulnerable]
# &quot;Phaius bernaysi&quot; swamp orchid [endangered] likely to be a yellow colour form of &quot;P. australis&quot;, it is likely that no mainland populations remain of this colour form.
# &quot;Pterostylis nigricans&quot; brownhood orchid [near threatened]
# &quot;Schoenus scabripes&quot; bog rush [near threatened]
# &quot;Thesium australe&quot; toadflax [vulnerable]

== History ==
North Stradbroke Island has the earliest evidence of human occupation in south-east Queensland. The Aboriginal (Jandai) name of the island is &quot;Minjerribah&quot; (&quot;island in the sun&quot;). The first recorded visit by a European was by Matthew Flinders in 1802, who was seeking a source of fresh water. He was impressed by the Aboriginal people&#x27;s health and hospitality. Local historian Thomas Welsby records an Aboriginal oral tradition that there was earlier contact with non-indigenous people. This concerns two survivors who walked into one of the Aboriginal camps after their ship was wrecked on the ocean side of the island. The tradition states that one of the men was named Juan and the other Woonunga. In 1890 a member of the Campbell family, one of Stradbroke&#x27;s oldest mixed blood families, told Welsby that the remains of the ship were still visible in the 18 Mile Swamp and that the remains were of English oak. This story gives rise to a local legend that the remains of a Spanish or Portuguese shipwreck known as the Stradbroke Island Galleon exist somewhere in the 18 Mile Swamp.

In 1823 three shipwrecked sailors from Sydney, Thomas Pamphlett, John Finnegan and Richard Parsons, spent time on the island after they were washed ashore on Moreton Island. The local Aboriginal people supplied them with food and shelter and even gave them a canoe to help them on their way. Their experiences prompted interest in the Moreton Bay area and in 1827 Governor Ralph Darling came from Sydney aboard HMS &quot;Rainbow&quot;, giving the names Stradbroke Island and Dunwich in honour of the commander of the ship, Captain Henry John Rous, whose family held the titles Earl of Stradbroke and Viscount Dunwich.

A mission was established at Moongalba by Passionist priests in 1843, but their attempts failed and they left the island not long afterwards.

Myora Mission was established as a mission station in 1892 at Moongalba. It became an Aboriginal reserve and &quot;industrial and reform school&quot; in 1896, was used as a source of cheap labour, and eventually closed in 1943. These locals worked the Dunwich Benevolent Asylum and were the first Aboriginal people in Australia to receive equal wages. In 1944, after a 25-year campaign, the Aboriginal workers gained equal wages almost 20 years before anywhere else in Australia. The Asylum closed shortly after with the Aboriginal Gang only getting equal wages for one and a half years.

In September 1894, heavy seas drove aground the barque &quot;Cambus Wallace&quot; at a narrow isthmus roughly halfway down the island&#x27;s length. Salvage activity (including the detonation of a cargo of explosives) weakened the sand dunes along the spit such that by the spring of 1896, storms and tides had created a permanent opening from Moreton Bay to the Coral Sea, creating North and South Stradbroke Islands, separated by the Jumpinpin Channel.

North Stradbroke Island&#x27;s most famous local was Oodgeroo Noonuccal, formerly known as Kath Walker, the Aboriginal poet and native-rights campaigner. She was one of the prime movers of the movement that led to the 1997 landmark agreement between the local government council and the Aboriginal people of the area that claimed rights over the island and parts of Moreton Bay.

== Indigenous inhabitants ==

The Quandamooka people, an Aboriginal Australian people, are made up of the Noonuccal, Goenpul and Ngugi tribes. Quandamooka is the Aboriginal name for Moreton Bay; however North Stradbroke Island is also inhabited by the Quandamooka people. This group was traditionally nomadic, moving between a number of semi-permanent settlements and living off the land.

In July 2011, the Quandamooka people of North Stradbroke Island won a 16-year-long battle to have their Native Title claim recognised. The Federal Court determinations outline native title rights and interest over land and waters on and around North Stradbroke Island. According to the Redland City Council, the Quandamooka People&#x27;s native title consent determinations cover the majority of North Stradbroke Island, Peel Island, Goat Island, Bird Island, Stingaree Island, Crab Island and the water surrounding Moreton Bay.

In December 2021, people were not allowed to camp on the island unless they were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 to protect the Indigenous elders living on the island.

== Sand mining ==
=== History ===
In 1949, Australian Consolidated Industries (ACI) commenced sand mining operations on North Stradbroke Island. Consolidated Rutile Limited (CRL), an Australian public company listed on the Australian Stock Exchange, took over these sand mining operations in 1966 and operated two of Stradbroke&#x27;s three sand mines. CRL sand mined mineral sands. From 2001, the third mine, a silica sand mine, has been operated by Unimin Australia Limited, part of mining multi-national SCR-Sibelco, a company privately owned by the Belgian Emsens family. In 1998, Iluka Resources Limited, a publicly listed Australian company, acquired majority interest in CRL. Unimin Australia Limited acquired Iluka Resources majority interest in CRL holdings in 2009, and, in December 2010, the company changed its name to Sibelco Australia (after its Belgian parent company). Iluka Resources remains the overseas selling agent for mineral sands from Sibelco Australia&#x27;s Enterprise and Yarraman mines.

Mining began in the 1950s on the beachfront and this caused minimal disruption to the environment. However, as mining moved into the interior of the island in the late 1960s and increased in scale and size in the 1970s, the impact on Stradbroke&#x27;s ecosystem increased with Consolidated Rutile Limited (CRL) starting dredge-mining on Stradbroke&#x27;s high dunes. There are several accounts from sand mining employees of unusual artifacts being found during dredging operations. Dredge mining involves levelling the high dunes and stripping vegetation to create the dredge pond and this dramatically changed the landscape of Stradbroke. The dredge is continually moving, leaving the tailings sand, so, although the mined dunes are revegetated and stabilised, the original ecology of the Island cannot be replaced. As an alternative, development of the island for seaside residential use was mooted and in 1970 a bridge from the mainland via Russell Island was under serious consideration by the Queensland government. The Queensland Government also proposed a large-scale redevelopment of the island in the mid-1980s which would have seen the population of the island increase tenfold. However, after a concerted bid by conservationists and planners concerned at the impact on wetlands, fish breeding grounds and the impact of population growth, the idea fell from favour in February 1986 when Premier Bjelke-Petersen ruled the idea was not &quot;financially viable&quot;.

In 1991, the Australian Government and sand mining companies ACI and CRL attempted to reach an agreement on surrender of some or parts of mining lease tenements to form a national park. Half of North Stradbroke Island was to become a national park in return for a guarantee that mining could continue for the life of several mines in high-grade areas.1 The agreement was not signed by either of the mining companies nor the Government and has lapsed.

Sibelco Australia operated three sand mining sites on the island – Enterprise (by far the largest), Vance and Yarraman.
Mineral sands and silica sands at Vance mine, near Dunwich, are mined from the surface. Rutile, zircon and ilmenite were dredged from the Enterprise Mine, southeast of Dunwich (and previously the Yarraman Mine, south of Point Lookout). Enterprise was the largest mine on the island and accounted for 60% of the island&#x27;s production in 2011. It operated in close proximity to the Eighteen Mile Swamp along a migrating dredge path with a buffer zone from the wetlands prescribed by the Queensland Government. Conservationists have expressed concern that these buffer zones, the smallest of which is , are inadequate to protect the Ramsar-listed wetlands from pollution and will fail to protect the waterways, citing evidence from the 1976 inquiry into sandmining on Fraser Island which found even buffer between areas mined and wetlands was &quot;totally inadequate&quot;.
In 2009, of minerals were being produced by mining about 50 million tonnes of sand. Sibelco Australia produced of sand annually (approximately one per cent of North Stradbroke Island&#x27;s total sand). The silica extracted was used mainly in glass production, but also in digital tablets such as iPads. The mineral sands were used in paints, plastics, metals, cosmetics and biotechnological devices (such as prosthesis), both for domestic and international markets. The international market for Australian mineral sands, sold through Iluka resources, was mainly China, where 80% of exports are used as pigment in paints. A 2010 KPMG assessment, commissioned by Sibelco Australia, found 95% of revenue from NSI sand mining stayed in the Australian community.

=== Environmental concerns push for closure===
In 1991, up to 100,000 litres of diesel spilled from the sand mining company, Consolidated Rutile Limited [CRL] into Amity wetlands. This was not reported until 1994, the same year CRL was awarded a commendation in the inaugural State Government Award for Environmental Excellence. It was not until 1997 that the incident was acknowledged in CRL&#x27;s Annual Report stating that the spill was expected to be cleared by 1999 – eight years after it occurred. The sand mining company was never fined by the Department of Mines and Energy for these environmental incidents and continues operating. In 2008, CRL received the Premier&#x27;s Environment Protection Agency Sustainability Award for Resources industries for its rehabilitation processes. The award is given to a company that demonstrates leadership in environmental practices and commitment to progressive rehabilitation and long-term sustainability. At that time (according to the Stradbroke Island Management Organisation [SIMO], an environmental watch-dog organisation) two-thirds of the island were covered by mining leases.

In late 2009, CRL, which became a subsidiary of Unimin Australia, itself a subsidiary of Sibelco, after being purchased from Iluka Resources, was charged with illegal sand mining after it was alleged to have sold sand extracted from the island, to the building industry for the production of glass without the correct permit. Sibelco appealed, on technical grounds, the Magistrate&#x27;s decision that it had a case to answer on the criminal charges for the illegal selling of sand. On 22 May 2014, the Court of Appeal heard the appeal and delivered its judgement, all on the same day. It dismissed Sibelco&#x27;s appeal against criminal proceedings. The final day of this now five-year-long criminal trial was scheduled for 22 August 2014, in the Warwick Magistrates Court.

In 2009 it became public knowledge that the mining leases on North Stradbroke island had also expired for the areas of operation of the Enterprise and Yarraman Mines. This led to the June 2010 announcement by the then Premier Anna Bligh that sand mining on the island would be phased out by 2027 and the mined land and Ramsar listed wetlands would become national park, eventually to cover 80% of the island. This proposal relied on renewing expired mining leases under the &quot;Mineral Resources Act&quot;.

In another legal matter, the High Court of Australia ruled against Sibelco in June 2011 over a bid to sell sand to construction companies. Sibelco had lodged the appeal against the Redland City Council&#x27;s 2008 decision to deny the sand mining company&#x27;s application to sell of sand to construction companies over the next 100 years.

The ensuing public discussion around future land use saw concern expressed by some residents as to the impact on the island&#x27;s economy. and by conservationists who saw it as sand mining business as usual, as the non-renewal of expired leases would effectively end mining around 2014. Conservationists campaigned with the simple message that 2027 was, in fact, the forecast date for the exhaustion of the mineral deposits on NSI as already anticipated by the Enterprise and Yarraman mine operators, citing details from CRL&#x27;s letter of 13 May 2009 to the Australian Securities Exchange [ASIX] that mineral sand mining as an economic force on the island would end by 2027. Sibelco Australia&#x27;s commercial interests benefited by continued access to the mineral sand deposits on the expired leases until 2027, and, in 2010, Sibelco Australia commissioned Synergies Economic Consulting to report on the economic effect of an earlier closure of sand mining on NSI. The consultant&#x27;s report predicted an earlier closure of sand mining would prompt a rise in the price of ferry transport services, electricity services and fuel for the 2000 residents, with total employment on the island anticipated to drop by 30%.

Mining lease ML1117, the largest expired lease, contained the extensive Enterprise dredge mine, with a surface area of and a depth of . The application process for the renewal of mining leases requires the Minister for Mines for the Queensland government to consider future land uses of the area covered by the expired mining lease, under special section 286A of the &quot;Mineral Resources Act&quot;. The Minister can not renew an expired lease if further mining would be inappropriate having regard to future uses of the land. Since it was last renewed in 1986, parts of ML1117 had been included in the national estate because of its high conservation value, parts had been included in the Moreton Bay Ramsar protected wetland and all of it was for inclusion in a future national park. Conservationists foresaw there existed a strong argument that further mining would have been totally inappropriate, given regard for future and continuing land uses and therefore the lease ML1117 could not be renewed under the Mineral Resources Act. Under Queensland law, a ministerial decision to renew ML1117 would have allowed a right to judicial review of the decision in the Queensland Supreme Court by indigenous owners, the Quandamooka people of NSI, and conservationists. These parties had publicly flagged they would certainly use that right, given the good prospects of overturning the lease renewal decision upon judicial review, and bringing about the cessation of sand mining on the island around 2014.

In response to the public debate, and to the very real likelihood that expired mining leases would not be successfully renewed under the &quot;Minerals Resources Act&quot; if proper regard was given to future land use, on 22 March 2011 then Premier Anna Bligh announced that the Enterprise Mine would continue the operating until 2019, the Yarraman mine would operate until 2015 and the silica mine (Vance) until 2025. The Queensland government would approve sand mining on North Stradbroke Island not through considering an application for renewal of a mining lease under the Mineral Resources Act, but through the passage of a new Act, the &quot;Stradbroke Island Sustainability and Protection Act 2011&quot; (NSI Act). This Act was passed in April 2011. The act renewed the key expired Enterprise Mine mining lease ML1117 until 31 December 2019 and also extinguished the pre-existing judicial rights of conservationists and Indigenous owners opposed to renewal of the leases. The act also renewed two expired leases to facilitate continued silica sand mining at Vance until 2025.

Under the State Government&#x27;s &quot;Stradbroke Island Sustainability and Protection Act 2011&quot;, 80% of the island will become national park by 2026. The national park will be jointly managed by the Quandamooka people under the Indigenous land use agreement. The State Government planned to develop tourism opportunities by creating new walking tracks, camping grounds and recreational facilities. However, economic modeling undertaken by consultants commissioned by Sibelco Australia, Synergies Economic Consulting, states the growth in labour demand from tourism expansion is not expected to be rapid. This was because, at the time of the report in 2011, there was an overall weakness in domestic tourism across Australia. Under the 2011 legislation, the Enterprise mine was to close by 2019, and the much smaller Vance mine by 2025.

In January 2012, then state opposition LNP leader Campbell Newman announced that if elected his party would restore rights around mining leases to what they were [prior to the NSI Act passed in April 2011] and Sibelco Australia supported his electoral campaign by posting letters to voters by &quot;mine supporters&quot; without required disclosure, urging a vote for Campbell Newman. Sibelco belatedly obtained authorisation and in 2013 filed a disclosure revealing it had spent more than on postage and printing. However, this election promise was not fulfilled, with no restoration of rights to citizens extinguished by the &quot;North Stradbroke Island Sustainability Act&quot;. Instead, in 2013 the LNP Government passed legislation that allows sand mining on the island for an extra 16 years from 2019 to 2035. The circumstances leading up to this legislative amendment were referred to Queensland&#x27;s Crime and Misconduct Commission.

The public debate concerning sand-mining re-opened in late 2012 when conservationists and Indigenous traditional owners, the Quandamooka people of NSI, discovered that the Enterprise mine had commenced operation in 2004 without Federal government approval under the &quot;Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999&quot; (&quot;EPBC Act&quot;). As the Enterprise mine operates in close proximity to the Ramsar protected wetlands, experts had advised that the mine was having significant impact on the adjoining wetland, as water used in the sand mine&#x27;s operation flows into these protected areas. The wetlands are part of complex hydrological systems forming art of the ancient dunes, some up to 300,000 years old, and the long-term impacts on the wetlands are unknown. In August 2013, Friends of Stradbroke Island Inc was preparing to take Sibelco Australia to the Federal Court, as the Federal Government had not taken any steps to enforce Sibelco&#x27;s compliance with Australian environment protection laws.

On 6 June 2014 the Quandamooka people initiated a legal challenge, saying that the LNP Government&#x27;s extension of mining contravened the &quot;Native Title Act 1993&quot; (Cwth).

When Labor won office in 2015, the Palaszczuk government returned the end date to 2019.

===Closure of the sand mines===
The Yarraman mine closed in 2015. The Enterprise site was wound up in 2019, as per the 2011 legislation, while the much smaller Vance mine will continue to operate until 2025. A statement of intent was signed on 20 February 2019 by Sibelco Australia, the Queensland government and the Quandamooka people, by which the three sand mines would be rehabilitated. It would cost tens of millions of dollars and take five to six years. The Quandamooka Yoolooburrabee Aboriginal Corporation would move from its role in land care and cultural heritage advice into being responsible for the later stages of rehabilitation and developing the island as a cultural and wildlife sanctuary.

== Community fund ==
In 2011, Sibelco announced the formation of a new community fund, funded from the profits of sand mining – the Belgian family-owned mining company has made profits of approximately $1.5Billion dollars from its sand mining lease on Stradbroke Island. According to the fund, it &quot;is the largest community investment ever made in the history of the Bay Islands&quot;. The fund is administered by an advisory board, constituted by two members from each of the island&#x27;s townships and an executive chairperson. However, no Quandamooka people, who had their native title claim recognised in July 2011, after a 16-year proceeding, are members of the board of this community fund.

As at October 2017, there is no reference to the community fund on the Sibelco website.

==Arts, culture and tourism==
Arts such as fibre art and basketry and weaving techniques are being taught in workshops by a New Zealand-born artist living on the island, and Quandamooka Yoolooburrabee Aboriginal Corporation chief executive Cameron Costello is working to expand the tourism industry based on arts and culture, both Indigenous and non-Indigenous. The Quandamooka Festival was part of this, and the Quandamooka Arts Museum and Performance Institute is due to be completed in mid-2021.

<doc id="1109506" wikidata="Q194512" url="?curid=1109506" title="Skanör med Falsterbo">
<text>Skanör med Falsterbo is a statistical locality (Swedish &quot;tätort&quot;, locality code 3672), situated in Vellinge Municipality, Skåne County, Sweden with 6,937 inhabitants in 2010. It consists of the two old towns of Skanör and Falsterbo which have grown together and were unified in 1754, but are still regarded as different communities by locals. The preposition &quot;med&quot; means &quot;with&quot;. Thanks to its southerly and maritime position, the locality is the mildest in Sweden, with winter lows barely averaging frosts.

==Background==
It is a conurbation consisting of the two medieval towns of Skanör and Falsterbo. Both towns are located on the elongated reef-like western part of the Falsterbo Peninsula, (&quot;Falsterbonäset&quot;), Falsterbo to the south and Skanör to the north. The towns are separated by a several kilometers long bank built of earth and seaweed, and have never geographically been considered the same town.

The peninsula forms the southwesternmost tip of the Scandinavian Peninsula. It marks the border between the Baltic Sea and the Øresund, the sound that separates the Danish island Zealand from the southern Swedish province of Scania.

==Geography==
The locality is situated south of the city of Malmö, 28 km from Skanör and 30 km from Falsterbo, based on the local distance signs along the motorway. During the 20th century the towns have become affluent suburbs for people working in the Malmö-Lund region, as well as a popular site among older people who have retired from higher positions abroad or in the capital.

The peninsula is divided by the Falsterbo Canal, a waterway at the base of the Falsterbo Peninsula that shortens the route between the Øresund and the Baltic Sea, which was built to avoid mines laid in Øresund during WWII. The canal goes between the bays Höllviken (north) and Kämpingebukten (south).

==Climate==
The Swedish meteorological institute SMHI operates a weather station in Falsterbo. Like the rest of Scania, it has an oceanic climate (Cfb), but with greater maritime effects than in Malmö for example, due to its unsheltered position on the peninsula. It is also the southernmost official station in Sweden. This combination renders it have a January mean for 1961–1990 above freezing, a very unusual occurrence in Sweden. Falsterbo is often cooler than Malmö during the day and milder during the night due to the low diurnal temperature variation. The great maritime effects as well as the ice-free winters of the region contributes to both yearly heat and cold records being subdued by Swedish standards, however specific climate events have shrunk the temperature to and raised it to . In 2006, Falsterbo had an absolute December minimum of , exceptionally mild by Swedish standards. The precipitation normal value from 1961–1990 is , making it a very dry climate considering it being oceanic.

Due to the very marine nature, Falsterbo is the mildest weather station in Sweden, in spite of summer highs being far below surrounding areas. It also makes it sunnier than inland Lund, with 1902 hours of bright sunshine annually compared to the 1801 hours of Lund in the 2002–2016 period, this due to less convection build-up during spring and summer. Even being part of the Nordic mainland, Falsterbo also has a similar annual temperature to Carlisle in hypermaritime coastal England in spite of being slightly further north.

==History==

===Origin===
The origin of Skanör can be traced back to the end of the 12th century and Falsterbo is believed to have arisen shortly before. In around 1220 the Danish king built the Skanör fortress. S:ta Gertrud church in Falsterbo dates back to the 13th century, possibly the 12th.
===Growth===
During the Late Middle Ages both towns grew in importance and wealth as during late summer and autumn the peninsula was an important centre of trade and herring fishing in the annual Scania Market (&quot;Skånemarknaden&quot;). The market was held on the beach stretch between Skanör and Falsterbo and was dominated by the north German Hanseatic cities, primarily Lübeck. The Danish king delegated specific areas along the beach to these cities, so called &quot;fit&quot; or &quot;fed&quot;, where they had the right to carry out trade during the Scania Market. A large fishing village was located along the beaches of Øresund.

Soon thereafter a castle was raised in Falsterbo. In 1311 the castle was destroyed by the Hanseatic League (specifically the trade towns of Rostock, Wismar and Greifswald) in the war between these and the Danish king Erik Menved. After the war the king raised a new and larger castle in 1318 called Falsterbohus. The old castle in Skanör thus lost its importance thereafter. Olav IV of Norway, son of queen Margaret I of Denmark, died in 1387 in Falsterbohus.

After the herring population declined during the 16th century the Scania Market was dismantled and subsequently the two cities lost their former importance, but retained the town privileges, with joint administration.

===Recent history===
The two medieval towns Skanör and Falsterbo were united economically under the same mayor in 1754. Even so, they have geographically never been considered the same town, and they did not grow into a contiguous settlement until the late 1960s.

Falsterbo and Skanör remained small fishing towns until the rail line from Malmö to Falsterbo via Vellinge was built in 1904. Between 1904 and 1971 Skanör and Falsterbo each had their own railway stations. New residential areas grew up along the railway. Due to its small size Skanör med Falsterbo was the last city in Sweden to get a City Council (1934), but it had its own jurisdiction and a City Court (&quot;rådhusrätt&quot;) up until 1947. It is now a locality within Vellinge Municipality and has no administration of its own. The railway closed in 1971 and was dismantled the following year.

===Skanör Cement factory===
During the first world war a track was laid to the new cement factory located in the Skanör harbour. There are rumours that the cement factory was used as a depot for military equipment in case the war reached Sweden. Others claim that the factory was built under German influence only to serve as a disguise for a giant artillery foundation and that the bricks in the walls were placed upright to save costs. The cannon together with its counterpart in Køge in Denmark had as a purpose to guard the Øresund. In any case the cement factory was dismantled a few years thereafter. Of the cement factory only the foundation still exists today.

==Notability==
Falsterbo is known for the Falsterbo Bird Observatory, since most migratory birds leave the Scandinavian Peninsula via the 5 km long reef south of Falsterbo. The very same reef, and the fine sand beaches on the peninsula, offers some of the best sea bathing of Sweden.

Falsterbo also has an annual horse show (show jumping and dressage), the Falsterbo Horse Show. Skanör used to host the annual market, Skanörs sillamarknad.

<doc id="1109514" wikidata="Q3544623" url="?curid=1109514" title="USS Trepang (SS-412)">
<text>The first USS &quot;Trepang&quot; (SS/AGSS-412) was a &quot;Balao&quot;-class submarine in the United States Navy. She was named after the &quot;trepang&quot; (or &quot;trīpang&quot;), an Indonesian name for a marine animal called a &quot;sea slug&quot; or a &quot;sea cucumber,&quot; having a long, tough, muscular body and found in the coral reefs of the East Indies.

==Construction and commissioning==
When the contract to build &quot;Trepang&quot; was awarded to Mare Island Navy Yard in Vallejo, California, SS-412 was to be named &quot;Senorita&quot;, which would have made her the only U.S. Navy ship to be named for the &quot;señorita&quot;, a brilliantly colored fish found along the California coast. She was renamed &quot;Trepang&quot; on 24 September 1942, and her keel was laid down on 25 June 1943. She was launched on 23 March 1944 sponsored by Mrs. Jane Andre Davenport (&quot;née&quot; Gorham), the wife of &quot;Trepang&quot;′s prospective commanding officer, Commander Roy Milton Davenport, and commissioned on 22 May 1944 with Commander Davenport — already a three-time Navy Cross winner — in command.

==Service history==
===World War II===
====May–September 1944====
Following shakedown at San Diego, California, &quot;Trepang&quot; departed San Diego on 15 August 1944 and proceeded to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. where her crew trained and prepared the ship for combat.

==== First war patrol: September – October 1944 ====
Setting out from Pearl Harbor on 13 September 1944 for her first war patrol, &quot;Trepang&quot; prowled the waters south of Honshū, the largest and most important of Japan&#x27;s home islands. She remained below during daylight hours and came up after dark to get a better view as she recharged her batteries and filled up with fresh air. On the night of 30 September, &quot;Trepang&quot; spotted a fast convoy departing Tokyo Bay. The submarine gave chase and closed in on a group of ships which included two large tankers, a small freighter, and an escort. The submarine fired an overlapping spread of torpedoes which struck the freighter, 750-ton &quot;Takunan Maru&quot;, and sent her to the bottom.

On 10 October, &quot;Trepang&quot; attacked her second convoy, which consisted of a pair of tankers and a single escort. Although the submarine claimed a &quot;kill&quot;, a postwar assessment of the action did not credit her with a sinking. The following day, the error was reversed. The submarine launched four torpedoes at another Japanese ship, and her commanding officer recorded that all of the &quot;fish&quot; had missed. This time, however, postwar accounting credited &quot;Trepang&quot; with the destruction of the 1,000-ton &quot;Transport Number 105&quot;.

On 12 October, the submarine cruised some southwest of the entrance to Tokyo Bay. Soon after she came to the surface, and her radar swept the surrounding seas, four pips showed themselves on the phosphorescent screen—two large and two small—which were identified as two battleships and two destroyers.

Despite the fact that the phosphorescent waters would make his submarine stand out starkly in the night, Davenport closed at flank speed and fired a full spread of six torpedoes. The &quot;fish&quot; sped through the water toward their targets. He claimed success when explosions rumbled across the water, and flames lit up the night. Davenport turned the submarine to present her stern tubes to the enemy and loosed four more torpedoes. These all missed.

Davenport&#x27;s gallant and skillfully pressed attacks earned him his fourth Navy Cross. He felt that he had damaged a and had sunk a destroyer, but a study of Japanese records after the war did not verify either claim. [In fact the Trepang had damaged the Japanese destroyer Fuyutsuki off Omaesuki]

Her supply of torpedoes exhausted, &quot;Trepang&quot; cleared the area and headed for the Marshall Islands. She reached Majuro on 23 October for voyage repairs alongside submarine tender and brief training.

==== Second war patrol: November – December 1944 ====
On 16 November, &quot;Trepang&quot; got underway for the Philippine Islands leading a &quot;wolfpack&quot; which also included sister ships and . The wolfpack&#x27;s nickname was &quot;ROY&#x27;S RANGERS&quot; as &quot;Trepang&quot;″s own commanding officer, Roy M Davenport, was the officer in charge of the pack.

The weather was dark, windy, and rough on 6 December as &quot;Trepang&quot;″s conning tower broke the surface after a day&#x27;s submerged inshore patrol off Luzon. While shifting course toward deeper water, she detected a group of ships approaching from the northward. Upon closing to investigate, &quot;Trepang&quot; counted seven large ships and three escorts in the convoy which slowly approached the Philippines.

&quot;Trepang&quot; radioed news of her &quot;find&quot; to her packmaster and then submerged. The submarine shot straight and true, sending freighter &quot;Banshu Maru Number 31&quot; and cargo ship &quot;Jinyo Maru&quot; to the bottom in quick succession and damaging a third vessel, &quot;Fukuyo Maru&quot;. However, as &quot;Trepang&quot; came about to administer the coup de grace to &quot;Fukuyo Maru&quot;, the third cargo ship obligingly blew up and sank. Meanwhile, as &quot;Segundo&quot; and &quot;Razorback&quot; arrived on the scene, &quot;Trepang&quot; fired all of her remaining torpedoes at a fourth ship which, she reported, blew up and sank soon thereafter. However, this fourth sinking was not confirmed by Japanese records. In the meantime, the other two American submarines were trying to finish off the fleeing remnants of the shattered convoy and managed to sink two ships, one with the aid of American naval aircraft. &quot;Trepang&quot;, now out of torpedoes, sped back to Pearl Harbor, arriving before Christmas.

Following this war patrol, Davenport, one of the most highly decorated submariners of the war, left &quot;Trepang&quot; for shore duty as an instructor at the United States Naval Academy.

==== Third war patrol: January – March 1945 ====
Again sailing for Honshū, &quot;Trepang&quot;—now under Cmdr. Allen R. Faust—teamed up with submarines
, , , and , known as &quot;Mac&#x27;s Mops,&quot; on an anti-picket boat sweep past Nanpō Islands, the eastern island chain south of Tokyo, to clear the sea lanes for the aircraft carriers of Task Force 58 which in turn was about to strike the Japanese home islands to neutralize them during the assault on the strategic island of Iwo Jima. &quot;Trepang&quot; encountered no worthwhile targets during the patrol and had to settle for performing lifeguard duty for aircraft carrier assaults on Tokyo. On 24 February 1945, the submarine sank the 875-ton freighter &quot;Usuki Maru&quot; and blew the bow off another small coastal vessel. While maneuvering to finish off the crippled ship, several antisubmarine vessels appeared on the scene from behind a nearby headland and converged on the fleet boat. &quot;Trepang&quot; dove deep as the Japanese subjected her to a seven-hour depth charge barrage. On 14 March, &quot;Trepang&quot; sank the IJN Guardboat &quot;Kaiko Maru&quot; off Inubosaki. On 17 March, &quot;Trepang&quot; attacked and sank 117-ton picket boat &quot;Tsukiura Maru&quot; (a converted bonito and tunny fishing boat) off Torishima.

==== Fourth war patrol: April – May 1945 ====
Following her return to Guam in March, &quot;Trepang&quot; headed for the Yellow Sea, a &quot;hazardous duty&quot; area due to its vast stretches of shallow water. Despite the danger, the submarine performed well, sinking the 1000-ton landing craft &quot;Transport Number 146&quot; on 28 April; the 4667-ton, heavily laden freighter, &quot;Miho Maru&quot; two days later; and &quot;Minesweeper Number 20&quot; which blew sky-high with a hit on her magazine on 4 May. In addition, the submarine surfaced to shell a junk with a load of lumber. The sole member of this victim&#x27;s crew, a Korean, understood little sign language, and looked to be of little value for intelligence purposes, so he was put back on board his barely seaworthy craft, with tools and food, and sent on his way. Leaving the Yellow Sea, &quot;Trepang&quot; did a short tour of lifeguarding for B-25 Mitchell strikes on Shanghai, China, and for the continuing series of B-29 Superfortress raids on Tokyo, before she returned to Guam.

==== Fifth war patrol: June – July 1945 ====
&quot;Trepang&quot;″s fifth war patrol was divided into two parts—the first saw the ship operating in a lifeguard capacity while the second gave her a more offensive role off northeastern Honshū and eastern Hokkaidō. In the former role, she arrived on station to the southeast of Tokyo Bay. On 22 June 1945, she was on the surface in the Pacific Ocean southeast of Daiozaki Light on the coast of Honshu, Japan, when a flight of seven United States Army Air Forces B-29 Superfortress bombers jettisoned three bombs which straddled her, one landing off her port bow and two landing off her starboard quarter. She suffered no damage or casualties.

Having experienced two previous tours of lifeguarding, &quot;Trepang&quot;″s men otherwise expected a series of long dull days, spent moving in circles, squares, or triangles to break the monotony. However, shortly before 12:00 on 24 June 1945, her first day of lifeguard duty, lookouts spotted a blossoming parachute overhead and soon saw the splash of a crashed P-51 Mustang fighter damaged while escorting Superfortresses to Tokyo. &quot;Trepang&quot; bent on full power and soon picked up the downed aviator, Second Lieutenant Lamar Christian, USAAF, safe and sound. During the maneuver, another Mustang, piloted by First Lieutenant Frank Ayres, USAAF, radioed that it, too, was in trouble; and the pilot requested permission to bail out. &quot;Trepang&quot; replied telling Ayres to &quot;be patient&quot; until the first rescue was complete. Ayres circled the submarine until Christian was safely on board the submarine. Ayres then executed a perfect jump and landed some away from &quot;Trepang&quot; and was soon hauled on board.

On 27 June 1945, &quot;Trepang&quot; turned the two airmen over to the submarine which was on her way home with 30 other aviators already on board. In the middle of the transfer, the submarines picked up a radio message from a &quot;Boxkite&quot; (rescue search plane) that the surviving crew of Superfortress 44-70109 of the 504th Bomb Group, downed on 26 June 1945, was floating a mere from the Japanese seaport of Nagoya. Accompanied by her sister ship which had also been discharging passengers to &quot;Tigrone&quot;, &quot;Trepang&quot; surged ahead.

The two submarines raced to save the Superfortress&#x27;s crew. &quot;Trepang&quot; put on full speed and arrived on the scene first. She found eight survivors in four groups of rafts, spread over about of ocean. By the time &quot;Springer&quot; arrived on the scene, &quot;Trepang&quot; had picked up seven of the fliers. &quot;Springer&quot; picked up the last man. Four other members of the Superfortress crew did not survive, either having been either trapped in the plane, killed when their burning parachutes failed, or gone missing.

On 30 June 1945 En route to a rendezvous with submarine , &quot;Trepang&quot; sighted a small, troop-laden freighter — described in an official ship&#x27;s history both as a 492-displacement ton minesweeper and a 600-gross register ton cargo ship, in either case armed with two 37-millimeter guns — and sank the ship with her deck guns. A dozen or so Japanese soldiers from the flaming vessel refused to be picked up and taken prisoner and so were left to drown.

Subsequently patrolling off the eastern coast of Honshū, &quot;Trepang&quot; went scoreless until 7 July 1945 when she spotted a coastal convoy of three ships. She torpedoed and sank the lead ship—&quot;Koun Maru Number Two&quot;—but the other vessels conducted evasive action and sped away from the scene at full speed. Heading to seaward, &quot;Trepang&quot; suddenly shuddered under the impact of two depth-charge explosions. A solitary Japanese plane had spotted &quot;Trepang&quot;″s shadow in the shallow waters and had attacked her with depth charges. All missed their mark.

Given another lifeguarding assignment, &quot;Trepang&quot; stood on the alert to pick up possible downed airmen from British and American aircraft carrier strikes on the Japanese Home Islands. During this tour in July 1945, she rescued one pilot, Lieutenant, junior grade, Bill Kingston, USNR. In addition, on 14 July 1945, she witnessed a shore bombardment conducted by three battleships and a heavy cruiser against Kamaishi, Japan, during which, reportedly, &quot;Trepang&quot; sank a 100-gross register ton Lugger with her deck gun.

By now, the war was moving fast, and &quot;Trepang&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor for a refit. There, she watched the tumbling succession of staggering headlines—first the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the Soviet Union&#x27;s entry into the Far Eastern War, Japan&#x27;s tentative acceptance of surrender terms, and finally, on 15 August, peace at last.

=== Post-World War II ===
After completion of her refit, &quot;Trepang&quot; departed Pearl Harbor and arrived at San Diego on 3 September 1945. Decommissioned on 27 June 1946 and placed in reserve at Vallejo, California, at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, &quot;Trepang&quot; remained in reserve until 1967. She was redesignated as an auxiliary submarine and given the hull classification symbol AGSS-412 on 11 June 1962.

==Disposal==
Struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 30 June 1967 &quot;Trepang&quot; was authorized for disposal on 22 December 1967. She was sunk as a target in the Pacific Ocean off Southern California during Exercise &quot;Strike Ex 4-69&quot; on 16 September 1969 by the combined gunfire of the destroyers and .

==Honors and awards==
&quot;Trepang&quot; received five battle stars for World War II service and a Navy Unit Commendation.

==In media==
While in reserve, &quot;Trepang&quot; appeared in &quot;Dennis at Boot Camp,&quot; the ninth episode of the fourth season of the American situation comedy &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;, first broadcast in the United States on 25 November 1962.

<text>The Purcell Society, founded in 1876 (principally by William Hayman Cummings) is an organization dedicated to making the complete musical works of Henry Purcell available. Between 1876 and 1965, scores of all the known works of Purcell were published, in 32 volumes. Advances in musical scholarship and editorial techniques in the decades after the first volumes were issued meant that by the second half of the 20th century they were no longer meeting the needs of users. Beginning in the 1960s, the Purcell Society began to issue revised versions of the scores. The website gives details of the scores in the revised series that are currently available.

== Editorial Committee ==
The volumes of the edition (along with its companion series) were edited by a diverse group of musicians and editors, and moderated by an editorial committee. Editors and committee members include, among others: 

* Frank Bridge
* Thurston Dart
* Rebecca Herissone
* Christopher Hogwood
* Peter Holman
* Margaret Laurie
* Andrew Pinnock
* Curtis Price
* Ian Spink
* William Barclay Squire
* Charles Villiers Stanford
* Michael Tilmouth
* Ralph Vaughan Williams
* Bryan White
* Bruce Wood

==Holding libraries==
All volumes of the complete work of Henry Purcell published by the Purcell Society are available in the Zentral- und Landesbibliothek Berlin and the British Library in London.

The FAL library at the University of New Mexico has in its possession most of the volumes, with some added revised editions. The FAL is missing vols. 1, 6, 8, 10, 16, 18, 21, 23.

<text>The Transcendental Études (), S.139, are a set of twelve compositions for piano by Franz Liszt. They were published in 1852 as a revision of an 1837 set (which had not borne the title &quot;d&#x27;exécution transcendante&quot;), which in turn were – for the most part – an elaboration of a set of studies written in 1826.

== History ==

The genesis of the &quot;Transcendental Études&quot; goes back to 1825, when 14-year-old Liszt wrote a set of youthful exercises called the &quot;Étude en douze exercices&quot; (Study in twelve exercises), S.136. These pieces were not particularly technically demanding. Liszt then returned to these pieces for thematic ideas, elaborating on them considerably, in the composition of the &quot;Douze Grandes Études&quot; (Twelve Grand Studies), S.137, which were published in 1837.

The &quot;Transcendental Études&quot;, S.139, are revisions of the &quot;Douze Grandes Études&quot;. The fourth was altered and published alone as &quot;Mazeppa&quot; in late 1846, and the collection as a whole was published in 1852 and dedicated to Carl Czerny, Liszt&#x27;s piano teacher, and himself a prolific composer of études. Liszt made numerous textual changes in the final revision of the set, adapting the technical demands to facilitate execution on pianos with heavier keyboard action.

When revising the 1837 set of études into their final &quot;Transcendental&quot; versions, Liszt added programmatic titles in French and German to all but two of the pieces, Études Nos. 2 and 10. In his edition of the work, Ferruccio Busoni respectively called them &quot;Fusées&quot; (&quot;Rockets&quot;) and &quot;Appassionata,&quot; and these titles are occasionally used in modern performance. However, these alternate titles were never approved by Liszt himself, and, generally, in scholarly reference, in performance, and in authoritative urtext editions like those published by G. Henle Verlag, these two études are referred to only by their performance indications: &quot;Molto vivace&quot; and &quot;Allegro agitato molto,&quot; respectively. 

Liszt&#x27;s original idea was to write 24 études, one in each of the 24 major and minor keys. He completed only half of this project, using the neutral and flat key signatures. In 1897–1905 the Russian composer Sergei Lyapunov wrote his own set of &quot;Douze études d&#x27;exécution transcendante&quot;, Op. 11, continuing Liszt&#x27;s cycle through the keys that Liszt had not used, namely the sharp keys, to &quot;complete&quot; the set of 24. Lyapunov&#x27;s set of études was dedicated to the memory of Liszt, and bore titles as Liszt&#x27;s set had done, with the final étude being entitled &quot;Élégie en mémoire de Franz Liszt&quot;.

Very few pianists have recorded the 1837 set, and even fewer have recorded the 1826 set (which really are works of Liszt&#x27;s juvenilia). Leslie Howard is the only pianist to have recorded all three sets on a major label for international release, as part of his series of recordings for Hyperion of the complete solo piano music of Liszt.

<text>Geraldine Halls (17 December 1919 – 27 October 1996) was an Australian mystery writer and novelist who sometimes wrote under the pseudonym Charlotte Jay, Jay being Halls&#x27;s maiden name. Halls&#x27; book &quot;Beat Not the Bones&quot; won the then newly created Edgar Allan Poe Award of the Mystery Writers&#x27; Association of America for Best Novel of the Year in 1954. The crime novel, &quot;The Fugitive Eye&quot; was adapted for television for a drama series in 1961. The episode starred Charlton Heston and the series was hosted by Fred Astaire.

==Life==
Halls was born as Geraldine Mary Jay in Adelaide, South Australia on the 17 December 1919. She attended Girton School (now Pembroke School) and the University of Adelaide, and worked as a shorthand typist in Australia and England, and as a court stenographer in New Guinea, 1942–1950.

She married Albert Halls, an Oriental specialist, who worked with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Albert Halls dealt in Oriental antiques in England and Australia. Marrying Albert enabled Halls to travel to many exotic locations in which she later included in her books. Only her first novel, &quot;The Knife is Feminine&quot;, is set in Australia. The other books are set in Pakistan, Japan, Thailand, England, Lebanon, India, Papua New Guinea and the Trobriand Islands.

After a long career in writing, Halls died on 27 October 1996, in her home town of Adelaide.

<text>Gambit is an American television game show based on the card game blackjack, created by Heatter-Quigley Productions. The show originally ran on CBS from September 4, 1972, to December 10, 1976, and was recorded at CBS Television City in Studios 31, 33, 41, and 43. On October 27, 1980, NBC revived the show as &quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot;, as a replacement for &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot;, and kept it on its schedule until November 27, 1981. As the title implied, this edition of &quot;Gambit&quot; was recorded in Las Vegas at the Tropicana Las Vegas. Both versions were hosted by Wink Martindale and announced by Kenny Williams. Elaine Stewart (co-creater Merrill Heatter&#x27;s wife) was the card dealer/co-hostess for the CBS version, while Beverly Malden filled this role for the first half of &quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot;, and was later replaced by Lee Menning.

Another Merrill Heatter-produced, blackjack-based quiz show, &quot;Catch 21&quot;, began airing on GSN in 2008.

==Gameplay==

===Main game===
The object of the main game was similar to blackjack, with two married couples attempting to build a hand as close to 21 as possible without going over (&quot;busting&quot;). Number cards (2 through 10) were worth their face value, face cards (Kings, Queens, Jacks) counted as 10, and Aces counted as either 1 or 11.

Martindale asked a series of toss-up questions, usually multiple-choice or true-false. The first couple who buzzed-in and correctly answered the question won control of the top card from a deck of oversized playing cards. An incorrect answer awarded control of the card to the couple&#x27;s opponents.

Once a couple gained control of a card, they had the option of adding it to their own hand or passing it to their opponents. The first card of the game was revealed before the question was asked. Each subsequent card was presented face-down and was turned up once the couple in control decided who should receive it. After a couple received any card (either by choice or by having it passed to them) that put them in the lead and could potentially bust with another card, they could elect to &quot;freeze&quot;, preventing them from receiving any more cards. Freezing was not permitted when the two couples were tied. If one couple froze, the other continued answering questions and received a card after each one.

A couple could win the game in one of four ways:
* If they reached a total of 21. Doing so also won the Gambit Jackpot, a cash bonus that reset to $500 after it was claimed. On the original series, the Gambit Jackpot increased by $500 at the start of each program if it had not been won on the previous show. On &quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot;, the Gambit Jackpot increased for each match it went unclaimed.
* If their opponents busted.
* If they froze and their opponents missed a subsequent question.
* If they exceeded their frozen opponents&#x27; total without busting.

Each game was worth $100. The first team to win two out of three games won the match and advanced to the bonus round.

===Bonus round===

====Gambit Board====
For the entire original series and the first half of &quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot;, the winning couple played the Gambit Bonus Board. They faced a large game board with 21 numbered flip-panels (18 numbered video screens on &quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot;), each concealing a prize. After selecting a number, the couple received the prize behind it and a card was added to their hand from the top of the deck.

The couple could end the bonus game by doing any of the following:
* Choosing to stop before reaching 21, which allowed them to keep all the prizes they had uncovered. Couples could do this if they feared the next card might cause them to bust, or if they had won a desirable prize that they did not want to risk losing. In early episodes of &quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot;, a couple could elect to stop only when their hand totaled 17 or more.
* Busting, at which point they lost everything they found on the board.
* Reaching 21 exactly, which awarded a new car (original series) or $5,000 cash (&quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot;), the Gambit Jackpot, and all prizes uncovered during the bonus game.

Throughout the CBS run, champions remained on the show until they either lost in the main game or reached/exceeded the $25,000 winnings limit that the network had in place for its game shows at the time.

From 1972 to 1975, the show featured an annual promotion in which the first couple to get a two-card 21 (an Ace and a face card/10) in the bonus round won either $200 a week for a year (totaling $10,400) or a flat $10,000, depending on the year.

Special awards were occasionally hidden among the numbers, including:

* Half-Checks: Showed cash amounts from $500 to $10,000 that had been split down the middle. Each right half showed two zeroes, while each left half showed the first digit(s) of the amount (for example, &quot;$2,5&quot; left and &quot;00&quot; right awarded $2,500). Any left and right halves could be matched together, crediting the couple with that amount of money. If a couple ended a bonus game without busting and had an unmatched half-check, they held onto it and would try to find its opposite half if they won their next match.
* Suit Cards: Displayed one of the four playing card suits. The couple won $500 immediately, plus an additional $500 for each card in the indicated suit that they had in their hand when the round ended.
* Hot Card: A card whose rank was kept hidden until the round was over. The couple won $1,000 if they had a card of this rank in their hand, or $100 otherwise.
* Swap: Allowed the couple to trade in one of their prizes for another pick from the board after the round ended, if they chose to do so. This award did not add a card to the couple&#x27;s hand.
* Take Two: Allowed the couple to choose two more numbers before being dealt the next card.
* 100/200/500 Times: After the round ended, one card was dealt from the deck and its value was multiplied by the indicated number in dollars. Aces always counted as 11 in this respect, for a maximum of $1,100, $2,200, or $5,500.
* Top or Bottom: A blind choice between two prizes of a similar type, one of which was considerably more expensive than the other. &quot;Cruise,&quot; for example, could award a cruise to either the Caribbean or Catalina Island.
* Stop or Go: After the round ended, cards were dealt out one at a time, each worth $100 times its value (with aces counted as 11). The couple could stop at any time, but if a card came up that matched the suit of the first one dealt, the game ended and they lost the accumulated money.
* Beat the House (original series) / Beat the Dealer (&quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot;): After the round ended, the couple played a hand of traditional blackjack against Martindale, who acted as the house and had to follow standard rules (hit on 16 or lower, stand on 17 or higher). If the couple won, they received an additional $2,500 (original series) or $1,000 (&quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot;).

====Big Numbers====
For the second half of the NBC version, the Gambit Board was replaced with the Big Numbers round from the earlier Heatter-Quigley production &quot;High Rollers&quot;.

The rules of the game were the same as on &quot;High Rollers&quot;, where the champion couple tried to remove the numbers 1 through 9 from a game board by rolling two dice. After each roll, the couple had to choose one or more numbers still on the board that exactly added up to the total showing on the dice; those numbers were then removed and taken out of play. Rolling doubles at any point earned the couple an insurance marker, which enabled them to continue playing if they made a roll that could not be completed with the numbers on the board. If they made such a roll and did not have an insurance marker, or if they removed every number except 1, the round ended.

Removing all nine numbers awarded the Gambit Galaxy, a jackpot which included $5,000 cash and a collection of prizes that increased in value every time it was not won. If the couple failed to complete the round, they won $100 for each number they had removed.

==Broadcast history==

===CBS, 1972–76===

CBS originally aired &quot;Gambit&quot; at 11 a.m/10 Central, where it defeated NBC&#x27;s &quot;Sale of the Century&quot;. It also easily beat Alex Trebek&#x27;s American debut program, &quot;The Wizard of Odds&quot;, which NBC began in July 1973. On April 1, 1974 (the same day &quot;Now You See It&quot; with Jack Narz premiered), CBS moved the show back a half-hour to 10:30/9:30, where it faced NBC&#x27;s aging quiz &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; with Art Fleming, just over a full decade before Trebek would host a revival of that show himself. NBC moved &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; to the afternoons on July 1 and placed one of the many Bill Cullen-Bob Stewart collaborations, &quot;Winning Streak&quot; in the slot. That show&#x27;s weakness made late 1974 the high point of &quot;Gambit&quot;″s original daytime run at least in the Nielsen ratings.

On January 6, 1975, NBC replaced &quot;Winning Streak&quot; with &quot;Wheel of Fortune&quot;, which took a chunk out of &quot;Gambit&quot;″s audience. On the same day, NBC expanded the soap opera &quot;Another World&quot; to sixty minutes and the impact it had on the ratings of &quot;The Price Is Right&quot;, which aired at 3:00 pm, forced CBS to shuffle its schedule again on August 18, 1975, and move &quot;Price&quot; back to the morning schedule, which it had left in 1973. &quot;Gambit&quot; moved back to 11:00 am, bumping &quot;Tattletales&quot; back to the afternoon after two months and remained there until late 1977, when it returned to the morning until its March 1978 cancellation. At that slot, &quot;Gambit&quot; initially had to go against its sister Heatter-Quigley show &quot;High Rollers&quot;, also hosted by Alex Trebek. However, NBC decided to air a sixty-minute edition of &quot;Wheel&quot; beginning on December 1 with the second half competing with &quot;Gambit&quot;. Furthermore, NBC left &quot;Wheel&quot; at 11:00 am when the experiment ended seven weeks later in January 1976 and it continued to eat away at &quot;Gambit&quot; in the ratings. The network canceled the four-year-old game two weeks before Christmas 1976 and replaced it with Goodson-Todman&#x27;s &quot;Double Dare&quot; with Trebek taking the hosting position after &quot;High Rollers&quot; came to an end on June 11, 1976.

After its cancellation, repeats of &quot;Gambit&quot; were later seen on KHJ-TV Channel 9 (now KCAL-TV) in Los Angeles, starting in fall 1977 and running until spring 1978.

===NBC, 1980–81 (&quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot;)===
Along with Goodson-Todman&#x27;s &quot;Blockbusters&quot; (which aired immediately after), the retitled &quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot; returned on October 27, 1980, as one of two replacements for the short-lived &quot;The David Letterman Show&quot; (Letterman did a tribute/parody of &quot;Gambit&quot; to conclude his last program). Stan Worth composed the theme for this version, with Beverly Malden serving as card dealer before she was replaced by Lee Menning. Producer Robert Noah, director Jerome Shaw, and announcer Kenny Williams all carried over from the original.

Despite limited competition (reruns of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot; on CBS, and local or syndicated programming on ABC affiliates), the revival failed to draw the ratings of its predecessor and was cancelled after just over a year, ending on November 27, 1981.

==Personnel==
Both the original version and &quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot; were hosted by Wink Martindale, with Kenny Williams, announcer of many other Heatter-Quigley shows, as announcer. Jerome Shaw was the director of both versions, and Robert Noah the producer. Elaine Stewart was the card dealer on the original version, while Beverly Malden served in this role on early episodes of &quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot; before being replaced by Lee Menning. Mort Garson composed the original version&#x27;s theme, and Stan Worth composed the theme to &quot;Las Vegas Gambit&quot;.

==&quot;Catch 21&quot;==

&quot;Gambit&quot; creator Merrill Heatter developed a similar show, &quot;Catch 21&quot;, which premiered on GSN July 21, 2008 with Alfonso Ribeiro as host and Mikki Padilla as dealer.

==Episode status==
A good chunk of the series is considered lost despite CBS having abandoned their wiping process around the same time. &quot;The Joker&#x27;s Wild&quot; which premiered the same day as Gambit (September 4, 1972) also had a majority of its episodes lost to time until the first two seasons of the CBS run were found. Five episodes of the CBS version from 1973 are held by the UCLA Film and Television Archive. The pilot for an unsold 1990 revival, hosted by Bob Eubanks, is also present within the same collection. Several episodes including the CBS finale exist on YouTube and Dailymotion. Reruns of the CBS series aired on WPIX-TV and KHJ-TV in 1976 and 1977, with Rhodes Productions handling distribution, but it is not clear what happened to these episodes afterward.

<doc id="1109569" wikidata="Q795297" url="?curid=1109569" title="B57 nuclear bomb">
<text>The B57 nuclear bomb was a tactical nuclear weapon developed by the United States during the Cold War.

Development began at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1960 to meet a requirement for a multi-purpose weapon, suitable for use as a nuclear depth charge or a nuclear bomb against ground targets. Entering production in 1963 as the Mk 57, the bomb was designed to be dropped from high-speed tactical aircraft. It had a streamlined casing to withstand supersonic flight. It was 3 m (9 ft 10 in) long, with a diameter of about 37.5 cm (14.75 in). Basic weight was approximately 227 kilograms (500 lbs).

Some versions of the B57 were equipped with a parachute retarder (a 3.8 m/12.5 ft diameter nylon/kevlar ribbon parachute) to slow the weapon&#x27;s descent, allowing the aircraft to escape the blast (or to allow the weapon to survive impact with the ground in laydown mode) at altitudes as low as 15 m (50 ft). Various fuzing modes were available, including a hydrostatic fuze for use as a depth charge for anti-submarine use.

The B57 was produced in six versions (mods) with explosive yields ranging from 5 to 20 kilotons. Mod 0 was 5 kt, Mod 1 and Mod 2 were 10 kt, Mod 3 and Mod 4 were 15 kt, and Mod 5 was 20 kt. The depth bomb version of the B57, for the U.S. Navy, replaced the Mk 101 Lulu and had selectable yield up to 10 kt.

The B57 used the Tsetse primary design for its core design, shared with several other mid- and late-1950s designs.

The B57 was produced from 1963 to 1967. After 1968, the weapon became known as the B57 rather than the Mk 57. 3,100 weapons were built, the last of which was retired in June 1993.

The B57 could be deployed by most U.S. fighter, bomber and Navy antisubmarine warfare and patrol aircraft (S-3 Viking and P-3 Orion), and by some U.S. Navy helicopters including the SH-3 Sea King and SH-60F Seahawk. The B57 was also deployed with Canada&#x27;s CF-104s in Germany, and the Royal Air Force&#x27;s Nimrod from RAF St Mawgan and RAF Kinloss in the United Kingdom and Malta in the Mediterranean.

<text>William Hesmer (born November 23, 1981) is an American former professional soccer player who played as a goalkeeper.

==Career==

===College===
Hesmer was born in Wilson, North Carolina. He played college soccer at Wake Forest University from 2000 to 2003, establishing himself as one of the nation&#x27;s best goalkeepers at that level. As a junior, Hesmer was named an NSCAA second team All-American, and as a senior was named a first team All-American.

===Professional===
After graduating from college, Hesmer was drafted 17th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft by Kansas City Wizards. However, with Tony Meola starting in goal, and the very experienced Bo Oshoniyi as his backup, Hesmer was not able to establish himself, and finished the MLS season without playing a single minute, although he did take to the field – for one single minute in a game against Rochester Raging Rhinos – during a brief loan spell with the Richmond Kickers in the A-League.

In the 2006 season, Hesmer earned a handful of appearances, but did not make an impact on the first team. He was selected in the 2006 MLS Expansion Draft by Toronto FC, but was only with the club for a matter of hours before being dealt to Columbus Crew for a partial allocation. The 2007 season saw Hesmer establish himself as the first team keeper for the Crew. He started 20 matches for the Columbus club.

In the 2008 season, Hesmer stopped penalty kicks in each of the Crew&#x27;s first two matches, as well as a third against New England on May 8. He has been called into camp for the United States National Team but has yet to receive a cap.

He surpassed Jon Busch as the franchise&#x27;s all-time shutout leader by earning his 26th in a 1–0 triumph over Kansas City Wizards at CommunityAmerica Ballpark on May 23, 2010.

Hesmer became the third goalkeeper in MLS history to score a goal in a 2–2 draw with Toronto FC at BMO Field on October 16, 2010. With the Crew trailing 2–1 in second-half stoppage time, he sprinted to the center of the Toronto FC penalty area as an extra attacker while an Eddie Gaven corner kick was in mid-flight. The ball was headed by Chad Marshall back to Hesmer, who was given enough time to trap, set and fire it into the net.

A fractured right shoulder resulting from a collision with Danny Califf in the 85th minute of a 3–1 victory over Philadelphia Union in the regular season finale at Columbus Crew Stadium on October 24, 2010, forced Hesmer to miss the playoffs.

He made his 100th league appearance for the Crew on March 26, 2011, keeping a clean sheet in a 0–0 tie with New York Red Bulls.

An ankle sprain suffered during the first day of preseason training, sidelined Hesmer to begin the 2012 season. During the rehabilitation period, he made what would be his final appearance in the Black &amp; Gold, starting and playing the first half for the Crew reserves in a 2–1 loss to the Montreal Impact reserves, following the Crew senior squad&#x27;s home opener on March 24, 2012, at Columbus Crew Stadium. In April, Hesmer was forced to undergo surgery on his right hip, which had been initially injured three years earlier, costing him the remainder of the season. At the end of the year, Columbus declined his 2013 contract option and Hesmer chose to enter the 2012 MLS Re-Entry Draft. On December 14, 2012, he was selected by Los Angeles Galaxy in stage two of the draft.

Despite being selected, Hesmer didn&#x27;t sign with the Galaxy and opted to retire on February 19, 2013.

Will was signed to a one-day contract with the Carolina Railhawks as a backup goalkeeper for their June 24, 2014, Open Cup match against the LA Galaxy.

His post-career plans involved working in wealth management for Raymond James in Raleigh, North Carolina.

<text>The AMX-30 is a main battle tank designed by Ateliers de construction d&#x27;Issy-les-Moulineaux (AMX, then GIAT) and first delivered to the French Army in August 1966. The first five tanks were issued to the 501st &quot;Régiment de Chars de Combat&quot; (Tank Regiment) in August of that year. The production version of the AMX-30B weighed , and sacrificed protection for increased mobility. The French believed that it would have required too much armour to protect against the latest anti-tank threats, thereby reducing the tank&#x27;s maneuverability. Protection, instead, was provided by the speed and the compact dimensions of the vehicle, including a height of 2.28 metres. It had a 105 mm gun, firing a then advanced high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead known as the &quot;Obus G&quot;. The &quot;Obus G&quot; used an outer shell, separated from the main charge by ball bearings, to allow the round to be spin stabilized by the gun without spinning the warhead inside which would disrupt jet formation. Mobility was provided by the HS-110 diesel engine, although the troublesome transmission adversely affected the tank&#x27;s performance.

In 1979, due to issues caused by the transmission, the French Army began to modernize its fleet of tanks to AMX-30B2 standards, which included a new transmission, an improved engine and the introduction of a new OFL 105 F1 fin-stabilized kinetic energy penetrator. Production of the AMX-30 also extended to a number of variants, including the AMX-30D armoured recovery vehicle, the AMX-30R anti-aircraft gun system, a bridge-layer, the Pluton tactical nuclear missile launcher and a surface-to-air missile launcher.

It was preceded by two post-war French medium tank designs. The first, the ARL 44, was an interim tank. Its replacement, the AMX 50, was cancelled in the mid-1950s in favour of adopting the M47 Patton tank. In 1956, the French government entered a cooperative development program with West Germany and Italy in an effort to design a standardized tank. Although the three nations agreed to a series of specific characteristics that the new tank should have, and both France and Germany began work on distinctive prototypes with the intent of testing them and combining the best of both, the program failed as Germany decided not to adopt the new French tank gun and France declared that it would postpone production until 1965. As a result, both nations decided to adopt tanks based on their own prototypes. The German tank became the Leopard 1, while the French prototype became the AMX-30.

As early as 1969, the AMX-30 and variants were ordered by Greece, soon followed by Spain (AMX-30E). In the coming years, the AMX-30 would be exported to Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Cyprus and Chile. By the end of production, 3,571 units of AMX-30s and its variants had been manufactured. Both Spain and Venezuela later began extensive modernization programs to extend the life of their vehicles and to bring their tanks up to more modern standards. In the 1991 Gulf War, AMX-30s were deployed by both the French and Qatari armies. Qatari AMX-30s saw action against Iraqi forces at the Battle of Khafji. France and most other nations replaced their AMX-30s with more up-to-date equipment by the end of the 20th century.

==Background==
Although the occupation of France during World War II temporarily interrupted French development of armoured fighting vehicles, clandestine research allowed the French to quickly recover lost ground after its liberation in mid-1944. During the occupation, the French had secretly worked on an armour program that was, in 1944, taken over by the state workshop &quot;Atelier de Construction de Rueil&quot; (ARL), resulting in the design and production of the ARL 44, which began production in 1946. The tank was powered by a Maybach HL-230 engine, and armed with a tank gun. Although the vehicle was comparable to contemporary battle tanks in firepower and engine power, it suffered from distinct disadvantages, including an antiquated track design. While 600 were planned, only 60 were ultimately produced by 1950. That year, these were issued to the French Army&#x27;s 503rd Tank Regiment. Given that the ARL 44 had been considered only a stop-gap vehicle for the French Army&#x27;s armoured forces since inception, work on a new tank had begun as early as March 1945.

Development of the new tank was offered to five separate manufacturers: &quot;Atelier de Construction d&#x27;Issy-les-Moulineaux&quot; (AMX), &quot;Forges et Chantiers de la Méditerranée&quot; (FCM), Renault, &quot;Societe Lorraine de Dietrich&quot; (SLD-Lorraine) and &quot;Societé d&#x27;Outillage Mécanique et d&#x27;Usinage d&#x27;Artillerie&quot; (SOMUA). The new vehicle was based on the new post-war requirement for a single battle tank. The new vehicle was designated the AMX 50. Its hull and suspension were similar to that of the German Panther tank, which had been used by the French Army in the immediate post-war. The French government&#x27;s specifications for the new tank were strongly influenced by both the Panther tank and the heavier Tiger I; specifically, the French Army was looking for a tank with the protection of the former and the firepower of the latter. Although the design borrowed from German tanks, including the Maybach engine, based on an earlier model, and the torsion bar sprung road wheels, the AMX 50 also included a number of unique features. For example, it included an oscillating turret, mounted on trunnions, which was the first of its kind. The oscillating turret consisted of two parts, one of which was mounted on the trunnions of the lower part, attached to the turret ring. The main gun was attached to the upper part, facilitating gun elevation and depression, as well as simplifying the fire control equipment and the installation of the automatic loading system. Of the three contractors, Renault withdrew from the program, while in early 1946 the French government selected AMX and SOMUA to continue the development. The prototypes were designated M4s, and AMX completed its prototype in 1949, while SOMUA would not be finished until 1956. AMX&#x27;s first prototype was armed with a cannon, although a second prototype was fitted with a larger gun in July 1950 Although it was intended to put the AMX 50 into production as the standard medium tank of the Western European Union, financial reasons and the arrival of military aid from the United States in the form of 856 M47 Patton tanks caused the original program to be abandoned. In 1951 it was decided to turn the program into a heavy tank project with an even larger tank gun; though three prototypes were built, this too was abandoned in 1956, mainly due to a failure to design a powerful enough engine.

With the demise of the AMX 50 program in 1951, France temporarily officially abandoned the thought of producing a medium tank. It was expected that West Germany would soon be allowed to rearm, and the Germans had appeared to entertain the concept of equipping their forces with a host of low-cost light, but relatively powerfully armed tanks, their quantity compensating for a lack of full armament parity with the latest medium tanks. The prospect of delivering many thousands of these to the Germans induced the French to adopt the idea and plan to create light tank &quot;Type 67&quot; armoured divisions, for which the AMX-13/105 was specially designed. A private enterprise design aimed at fulfilling the same requirement was the somewhat larger Char Batignolles-Châtillon. A derived medium tank prototype of the latter, made in 1955, proved that it was possible to produce a tank with a first-rate gun and frontally protected with steel equivalence within a weight constraint of . This revived interest in the medium tank concept.

In 1956, the WEU defence workgroup FINBEL (named after France, Italy, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg), founded in 1953 and consisting of representatives of the various General Staffs, drafted a set of specifications for a new medium tank to eventually replace their American and British tanks. That same year, Germany joined the workgroup, turning it into FINABEL (the added &quot;A&quot; standing for &quot;Allemagne&quot;, &quot;Germany&quot; in French) and on 27 October 1956 at Colomb-Béchar a bilateral agreement was concluded between France and Germany to collaborate in building a tank. Though the other FINABEL nations did not formally participate, the type was called &quot;Europa-Panzer&quot; to indicate its common European nature, and experts from all countries were involved in the design process. The specifications (FINABEL 3A5) for the new tank called for a lightweight and mobile battle tank, setting the weight limit to and compromising the ability to heavily armour the vehicle. French and German engineers, during a conference in Bonn on 12 February 1957, defined the requirements for the future tank. This included a maximum width of , a height of and a tank gun, to be developed by the Franco-German military research institute at Saint Louis. The new tank would have an air-cooled, petrol engine, a torsion bar suspension with hydraulic shocks, a power-to-weight ratio of at least /metric ton and a road range of at least . In May, Italy joined the project, though only nominally, without any material contribution, because after the war it had no tank design bureaus. That same year, on 28 November, the French and German ministries of defence in Paris agreed upon a contract which would allow both countries to produce two prototypes separately. The next year, however, the project suffered a first setback when Charles de Gaulle took power in France, creating the Fifth Republic: the Paris treaty had as its main point developing a common nuclear weapon and on 17 June 1958 de Gaulle decided to refuse Germany and Italy the atomic bomb, to avoid antagonizing the US and United Kingdom. This made Germany lose much interest in a common tank project also.

The French prototypes were developed and produced by the &quot;Atelier de Construction d&#x27;Issy-les-Moulineaux&quot;, under the direction of General Joseph Molinié of the &quot;Direction des Études et Fabrications d&#x27;Armements&quot; (DEFA, the later &quot;Direction Technique des Armements Terrestres&quot;) and AMX head engineer Heissler, The first prototype was completed in September 1960 and tested from February 1961; the second, with an improved range finder and track was tested in July 1961. These first vehicles had a very rounded turret, in a deliberate imitation of the Soviet T-54, and Sofam petrol engines. Another seven, with an improved sleeker turret cast, were manufactured between 1961 and 1963. Work on the German prototypes was carried out by two teams, including Team A composed of Porsche, Maschinenbau Kiel, Luther &amp; Jordan and Jung-Jungenthal . Team B was made up by Ruhrstahl, Rheinstahl-HANOMAG and Henschel. Wood mock-ups were completed in 1959, while the first two prototypes were finished by 1961 (completed by Team A).

==Development history==
De Gaulle decided that France, though formally remaining a member, would no longer participate in the NATO military organization. This caused a rift between France and West Germany, which then started to emphasize standardization with American equipment, especially in armament, and to follow the new NATO policy to use multifuel diesel engines. German defence minister Franz Josef Strauss began to oppose the common tank project. In July 1963, the defence committee of the German Bundesrat decided to procure a purely national tank. In response, the same month the French government decided likewise.

Comparative trials were nevertheless held at Mailly-le-Camp, Meppen, Bourges and Satory between five French and five German prototypes between August and October 1963, under Italian, Dutch, Belgian and American supervision. The French type had received a separate national designation: &quot;AMX 30&quot;. The trials indicated that the German type, on 1 October also getting its own name &quot;Leopard&quot;, had a better mobility and acceleration. The French government decided that it could not procure a new tank until 1965, while the Germans refused to adopt the Franco-German tank gun, in lieu of the British Royal Ordnance L7, of which they had already ordered 1,500 in the autumn of 1962, their plan having failed for Rheinmetall to produce in Germany a common type of munition of sufficient quality. Suggestions to save the project by combining the French turret with the German chassis failed. As a result, the program was cancelled and the French and Germans definitely decided to adopt their two separate tanks.

The prototypes of the AMX-30 weighed , and were compact, with a width of , comparable only to the Swiss Panzer 61, and a height of , comparable only to the Soviet T-55. In contrast to the AMX-50, the AMX-30 was issued a conventional turret, because it was found that it was more difficult to seal oscillating turrets from radioactive dust and against water when the tank was submerged. Oscillating turrets also had a large ballistic weakness in the area of the skirt and turret ring. Originally, the first two prototypes were powered by a spark ignition engine, named the SOFAM 12 GSds. Later, a multi-fuel diesel engine was adopted, developed by Hispano-Suiza. The seven 1963 prototypes of the AMX-30 were later rebuilt with the new diesel engine. Two further prototypes, meant to be direct preproduction vehicles, were delivered in November 1965. Besides the diesel engines, they had changed hull and turret casts and different gun mantlets; the latter would again be changed in the production vehicles.

The first production versions of the AMX-30, named &quot;AMX 30B&quot; to distinguish them from the &quot;AMX 30A&quot; prototypes, were completed in June 1966, manufactured with a welded and cast hull and a fully cast turret. The production version of the tank had a combat weight of . The AMX-30&#x27;s survivability was based on its mobility; French engineers believed that the tank&#x27;s mobility would have been compromised had they added enough steel plating to protect against modern anti-tank threats, including high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warheads. As a result, the type had the thinnest armour of any main battle tank produced at the time. The turret has a maximum armour thickness of , the armour sloped at 70 degrees on the front plate and 23 degrees on the side, offering protection against armour piercing projectiles. The Line-of-Sight armour values are: for the front of the hull; for the forward sides of the hull; for the rear sides and rear of the hull; for the hull top and bottom; for the turret front; for the turret sides; for the turret rear and for the turret top. Further protection is offered by a nuclear, biological and chemical protection suit, including a ventilation system.

One of the unique features of the AMX-30 was the &quot;Obus à Charge Creuse de 105 mm Modèle F1&quot; (Obus G) HEAT projectile and its main gun, the Modèle F1, a monoblock steel cannon. HEAT warheads suffer when spin stabilized, a product of rifled barrels, causing the French to develop the Obus G, (Gresse). This projectile was composed of two major parts, including the outer shell and a suspended inner shell, separated by ball bearings. This allowed the projectile to be spin-stabilized, and therefore more accurate than a normal fin-stabilized HEAT round, while the inner shell did not spin, allowing the warhead to work at maximum efficiency. The warhead, containing 780 gram hexolite, could penetrate up to of steel armour and was effective against tanks at up to . As it combined a good accuracy with a penetration that was independent of range, it has been considered an &quot;ideal round&quot; for its day The AMX-30 was also designed to fire the OE F1 Mle.60 high explosive projectile, the SCC F1 training warhead and the OFUM PH-105 F1 smoke round. The main gun was coupled with a recoil brake, which had a maximum extension of , and could depress to −8 degrees or elevate to 20 degrees. The turret&#x27;s firepower was augmented by a coaxial M2 Browning machine gun. The tank commander also made use of a anti-aircraft machine gun on the turret roof. The vehicle carried 50 projectiles, 748 rounds and 2,050 bullets. The tank commander was issued a cupola which offered ten all-around direct-vision episcopes, and a binocular telescope with 10x magnification. The commander was also given an optical full-field coincidence range finder. The gunner was given a telescoping gun sight and two observation periscopes.

The production version of the AMX-30 was fitted with Hispano-Suiza&#x27;s HS-110 diesel engine, located in the rear of the hull. The engine could be replaced on the field in 45 minutes, and produced , offering the tank a maximum velocity of on roads. The fuel efficient engine, in conjunction with a total fuel capacity of , gave the AMX-30 a maximum road range of up to . The engine&#x27;s drive is taken through a Gravina G.H.B.200C twin-plate centrifugal clutch. The gearbox was an AMX 5-SD-200D, with five forward gears and five reverse gears. This transmission was heavily influenced by that of the German Panther tank and was based on a project which had begun in 1938. The transmission was one of the AMX-30&#x27;s major faults and caused a variety of mechanical problems, including that the driver would have to manually change gears at specific times, even if the tank was moving over rough terrain. The tank&#x27;s weight is distributed over five double, aluminum-alloy, rubber-tyred road wheels on either side, propelled on wide tracks. The tank could ford deep water obstacles without preparation, up to with minor preparation, and up to with full preparation. Full preparation for water operations consisted of the addition of a snorkel tube, the installation of blanking plates, carried on the front of the hull, over the engine compartment&#x27;s air intake louvers, and the installation of infrared driving equipment, including a searchlight. In 1969, a special diving and evacuation training vehicle, without engine or tracks, was created and nicknamed the &quot;AMX 30 Gloutte&quot; (from the French &quot;faire glouglou&quot;, &quot;gurgle&quot;); it could be quickly be lowered by winch into a reservoir and was equipped with an escape tube.

===Modernization===
During the production run, many improvements were implemented. These did not include gun stabilization from 1971, and from 1972 replacing the original coaxial heavy machine gun with a dual purpose autocannon against light armour and helicopters, with the ability to depress to −8 degrees and elevate to 40 degrees. All French army vehicles were eventually brought to this newer standard; the designation remained &quot;AMX 30B&quot;.

Beginning as early as 1973, only seven years after the beginning of production, the French began a research program for a future modification of the tank. The project was to result in a &quot;AMX 30 Valorisé&quot; (&quot;upgraded AMX-30&quot;). In June 1979, the French Army decided to both build new and modernize existing AMX-30s with an improved fire control system and a new transmission, and designated them &quot;AMX-30B2&quot;s. The first new production vehicles were taken into service in January 1982. Improvements to the COTAC APX M-508 fire control system included the installation of a laser rangefinder and a low-light TV (LLTV). The main gun&#x27;s lethality was improved with the introduction of a new armour piercing fin stabilized discarding sabot (APFSDS). The original engine was exchanged for an improved variant, known as the HS-110.2, producing . The poor transmission was replaced with the semi-automatic SESM ENC200 transmission (now RENK France), with a torque converter. The suspension was improved by adopting new torsion bars and shocks, which increased the vertical deflection range of the road wheels, thereby improving the tank&#x27;s off-road mobility. From 1998, the French army started to replace the engines of its remaining AMX-30 tanks and variants with 500 Renault Mack E9 750 hp engines.

Leclerc tank had already been ordered in the 1990s, however the AMX-30 continued to play a key role in the French army and two further up-grades were implemented in limited numbers for &quot;French rapid reaction force&quot; which was made up of 2 Tank Regiments &quot;1er and 2e Chasseurs&quot;. The first upgrade was an Explosive Reactive Armour package called &quot;BRENUS&quot;. Final upgrade was the purchase of 500 Renault RVI Mack E9 turbocharged diesel engines generating 750 hp These two tank regiments in peacetime were combined into a single one;, but the other two ANX-30 regiments, the &quot;2e/5e Dragons&quot;, only had their tanks adapted for a possible relatively quick upgrade, in case of an emergency. The BRENUS system used 112 GIAT BS (&quot;Brique de Surblindage&quot;) G2 explosive reactive boxes with a total weight of , offering a protection equivalent to of steel at 60° versus shaped charges and more than of steel versus kinetic energy projectiles such as APFSDS. During the 1990s, the AMX-30 has also been used as a testbed for several stealth technologies, including air cooling of hull surfaces and the use of visual camouflage. This prototype is known as the &quot;Démonstrateur Furtif à Chenille&quot;. Its hull and turret are fully covered by a superstructure built of angled plates made of radar absorbent material.

In the late 1980s, a consortium of West German companies developed the &quot;Super AMX-30&quot; modernization package for AMX-30B. The consortium itself consisted of AEG, Krupp Atlas Elektronik, MTU, Wegmann &amp; Co., Diehl, ZF Friedrichshafen, and GLS. The upgrades to the power packs were new MTU MB833 Ka501 diesel engine with 850 hp, ZF LSG-3000 automatic transmission, new engine cooling system, and increased fuel capacity up to 1,028 liters. The upgrades on mobility also includes upgraded torsion bars, hydraulic shock absorbers, new slightly larger road wheels, and Diehl Type 234 tracks. The fire control systems were upgraded with MOLF-30 modular laser FCS by Krupp Atlas Elektronik, gyro-stabilized gun and gunner&#x27;s day/night sight, laser rangefinder, and fully electric turret drive. Optional additional armour on the turret also available per buyer request. A single prototype was made and were publicly unveiled and tested in Saudi Arabia. The upgrade failed to find a buyer.

===Comparison to contemporary tanks===
==Variants==

The AMX-30 has a number of different variations, including a number of other armoured vehicles based on the same chassis. A simplified version of the tank, without the infrared searchlight and periscopes and a less complex commander&#x27;s cupola was developed for export, known as the &quot;basic AMX-30&quot;. This version also came devoid of the pressurized air filtering system, and moved the smaller machine gun into the coaxial position and the larger M2 to the turret roof. Another version was considered for the French Army, adopting a tank gun able to fire the supersonic (&quot;Anti-Char Rapide Autopropulsé&quot;) anti-tank guided missile, as well as high explosive rounds. A prototype was finished in 1967 with a new cast turret, wide enough to hold the much larger armament. However, the high costs of the missiles forced the French Army to abandon the program in 1972. The vehicles based on the chassis include an armoured recovery vehicle, a bridgelayer, a self-propelled anti-aircraft vehicle, a tactical nuclear missile launcher and a self-propelled artillery piece.

===AMX-30D – &quot;Dépanneur-Niveleur&quot;===
The armoured recovery vehicle, known as the &quot;AMX-30D&quot; (AMX-30 &quot;Dépanneur-Niveleur&quot;), was designed to recuperate or help maintain vehicles in the field. Work on the AMX-30D began in 1966, as the French Army researched developing a recovery vehicle to be issued to units receiving the AMX-30 tank. A prototype was produced and delivered for experimentation in 1971, and in February 1973 the first of a pre-series of five vehicles was delivered. That same year, another 100 AMX-30Ds were ordered, and these began production in 1975. The recovery vehicle includes a winch powered by the vehicle&#x27;s engine, with the ability to pull a maximum of of weight. The vehicle also has an heavy towing cable, while an auxiliary winch has another towing cable, able to tow up to when working over the front of the AMX-30D. In the latter case the vehicle must be supported by removable props, which are carried on the vehicle, and the bulldozer blade must be lowered on the ground. The crane can lift up the power pack and the turret. Instead of a turret, the AMX-30D is fitted with a superstructure, and weighs , although with the extra power pack it can weigh up to . The vehicle can protect itself with a machine gun. The driver&#x27;s visibility is aided by the inclusion of three M-223 episcopes. The AMX-30D has a maximum on-road velocity of and a maximum road range of .

===AMX-30H – &quot;Poseur de pont&quot;===
The &quot;AMX-30H bridgelayer&quot;, or &quot;Poseur de pont&quot;, consists of the AMX-30&#x27;s chassis with a box-like superstructure, supporting a scissor-type folding bridge. The bridge can span gaps. The bridge has a width of , but can be increased to through the use of appliqué panels. It can support weighs of up to . Bridgelayer development began as early as 1963, although it was not until June 1967 that development began on a prototype. Although a prototype designated &quot;AMX-30H&quot; was finished in 1968, it was not until 1971 that the vehicle was evaluated. At the end of the evaluations in September 1971, a pre-series of five vehicles was ordered, resulting in a new period of evaluations beginning on 16 October 1972. In 1975, the AMX-30H was declared standard in the French Army, although none of these vehicles were ever ordered. 12 vehicles were purchased by the Saudi Arabian Army.

===AMX-30 DCA – &quot;défense contre avion&quot;===
The self-propelled anti-aircraft gun began development in 1969 to provide this type of vehicle to the French Army and for export. Although ultimately none were ordered for France, in 1975 Saudi Arabia ordered an improved version (53 units,) denominated the &quot;AMX-30SA&quot; (first known as the &quot;AMX-30 DCA&quot;, for &quot;défense contre avion&quot;.) Developed to defend against low-altitude attacks, the system included two Hispano-Suiza 831 A automatic guns, coupled to an &quot;Oeil-noir&quot; fire control system. This system had already been installed on the AMX-13, in lieu of a heavier chassis, using a turret designated the S 401 A. Although this particular vehicle began production in 1962, the appearance of the AMX-30 offered a larger chassis to which the S 401 A turret could be mounted on, providing superior mobility. The heavier AMX-30 also provided a more stable platform for the guns, and allowed the system to carry much more ammunition (1,200 rounds, as compared to the 600 carried by the AMX-13 version). The guns were designed to fire in 5-round or 15-round bursts, with a cyclic rate of fire of 650 rounds per minute. They were controlled by an analogue computer, receiving information from a Doppler radar, which could be folded into an armoured box when not in use to protect from damage. The fire control depended on visual tracking, and so could only work in daylight and clear weather.

===AMX-30R and Pluton===
Three missile systems were developed to be mounted on the AMX-30 chassis. Recognizing the need for tactical nuclear missile mobile launchers, the French Army began developing the Pluton missile in 1963. In 1964, the program was suspended and instead the French Army opted for a missile with a longer range, able to be mounted on the AMX-30. A contract to develop the system was established in 1968. The first prototype was soon delivered and testing occurred between July and August 1970, followed by the production of a second prototype in 1971. Two more prototypes were fabricated in 1972. The next year, the vehicle was put into mass production and by 1 May 1974 four of these vehicles had been delivered to the 3rd Artillery Regiment. The missile itself weighs and is long. Using a simplified inertial guidance system and a solid propellant rocket motor, the Pluton has a maximum range of . The second missile system is the &quot;AMX-30R&quot; (Roland) surface-to-air missile launching system, which began development in 1974. Five vehicles of a pre-series were completed by 1977 and then evaluated, prompting the order of 183 vehicles that same year. The Roland includes a rectangular superstructure, taller than that of both the AMX-30D and the Pluton, which houses the radar system and mounts two launching tubes on either side, with an autoloading system feeding from an eight missile reserve inside the superstructure. The Roland&#x27;s exploration radar has a detection range of . The third missile system, called the &quot;AMX-30SA SAM&quot;, was developed in 1975 for Saudi Arabia, to fire the SA-10 &quot;Shahine&quot;, developed and manufactured by Thomson-CSF; the launching vehicle was heavily based on the AMX-30R.

===AMX 30 AuF1 &quot;canon automoteur&quot;===
The &quot;canon automoteur de 155 GCT&quot; (for &quot;Grande Cadence de Tir&quot;, fast rate of fire) was developed based on the AMX-30 chassis to provide tactical artillery support to units in the French Army, who refer to it as the &quot;AMX 30 AuF1&quot;. The howitzer was 40 calibers long, and was autoloaded allowing it a rate of fire of eight rounds per minute, with a maximum range of with the LU211 round. The turret enables the gun to have an elevation of up to 66 degrees, and allows it to traverse a full 360 degrees. The vehicle carries 42 rounds of ammunition, with combustible cartridge cases. The origins of the decision to design a self-propelled howitzer can be traced back to 1969, with the first prototype completed in 1972. By 1979, seven prototypes had been produced, and six pre-series vehicles, followed by the production of 110 vehicles. This order was later increased to 190.

===AMX 32===
The first prototype of an improved AMX-30 for the export market, known as the &quot;AMX-32&quot;, was unveiled in June 1979. Originally intended as an alternative for the AMX-30B2, and deliberately imitating the spaced armour concept the Germans had successfully implemented on the Leopard 1A3 and A4, the AMX-32 fielded greater armour protection to offer increased survivability against anti-tank guided missiles. A autocannon was included as the main gun&#x27;s coaxial weapon, and a machine gun attached to the roof. However, no orders were ever placed.

==Production==

AMX-30 production occurred at the &quot;Atelier de Construction de Roanne&quot; in the town of Roanne. This heavy manufacturing factory was built during World War I to produce artillery shells, although by 1952 the factory had begun producing armoured fighting vehicles. Before producing the AMX-30, for example, it had made 1,900 AMX-13s and variants. The Roanne factory was responsible for final assembly, most components were made elsewhere: the powerplant by the &quot;Atelier de Construction de Limoges&quot;, the full armour set by the &quot;Ateliers et Forges de la Loire&quot;, the turret by the &quot;Atelier de Construction de Tarbes&quot;, the cannon by the &quot;Atelier de Construction de Bourges&quot;, the cupola and machine-gun by the &quot;Manufacture d&#x27;Armes de Saint-Étienne&quot; and the optics by the &quot;Atelier de Construction de Puteaux&quot;; all these again used many subcontractors. In a series of corporate mergers under state guidance, most of these firms would eventually be concentrated into GIAT.

Originally, 300 AMX-30s were ordered by the French Army, and by 1971 the order had been increased to 900, divided between eight batches, including all variants based on the chassis. Beginning in 1966, ten AMX-30s were assembled per month, and the first five were issued in August 1966 to the 501st &quot;Régiment de Chars de Combat&quot;. Monthly production grew to 15–20 tanks as new factories began to manufacture components of the vehicle and existing factories increased their production potential. However, in April 1969, production was again reduced to ten per month. By 1971, about 180 vehicles were in service; in 1975 delivery began of the last 143 units of the final eighth batch of the original order. In 1985, the number of AMX-30s had risen to 1,173. By the end of production, France had accepted 1,355 AMX-30s into service, including 166 brand-new AMX-30B2s. Another 493 tanks were refitted and modernized to AMX-30B2 standards; originally 271 new and 820 refitted vehicles had been planned. The French Army also accepted a large number of variants, including 195 self-propelled howitzers, 44 AMX-30 Pluton tactical nuclear missile launchers, 183 AMX-30Rs, 134 AMX-30Ds and 48 engineer vehicles (AMX-30EBG). The last 35 new battle tanks were in 1989 ordered by Cyprus and the last new variant vehicles, a batch of twenty GCTs, in 1994 by France.

In the late 1990s, the French Army began to accept the new Leclerc main battle tank to replace the antiquated AMX-30. The first units to be outfitted with the new tank were the 501st and 503rd tank regiments, followed by the 6th and 12th Cuirassier Regiments.

==Export==


Having in February 1964 decided to produce its own battle tank, Israel at first considered licensed production of AMX-30 hulls, while importing the turrets from France. Favouring heavier armour over mobility, Major-General Israel Tal discontinued negotiations with France when the United Kingdom agreed to allow licensed production of the Chieftain tank, in 1966.

France eventually also failed to obtain orders from the remaining two FINABEL nations, Belgium and the Netherlands: the Dutch did not even test the type and the Belgians ordered the Leopard when France refused to allow partial component production of the AMX-30 in Belgium, fearing it would increase the unit cost.

Less costly and easier to maintain, the AMX-30 has been preferred over the Leopard 1 by less affluent or developed nations.

In 1969, the Greek military junta agreed to procure a total of 190 AMX-30s and 14 AMX-30Ds, making Greece the first foreign nation to purchase the French tank. Throughout the 1960s, Spain had considered both the AMX-30 and the Leopard 1 to complement their existing fleet of M47 and M48 Patton tanks. Ultimately, Spain opted for the AMX-30 for a variety of reasons, including British unwillingness to sell the L7 tank gun to a fascist regime and the French offer to allow the AMX-30 to be manufactured in Spain. Spain ordered 19 tanks in 1970, and later agreed to manufacture another 180 tanks in Spain. In 1979, Spain began the production of a second batch of 100 tanks, completing a total of 299 AMX-30s issued to the Spanish Army; these were designated AMX-30Es. Spain also procured 10 AMX-30Ds and 18 AMX-30Rs. As production of the AMX-30E ended in 1979, the Spanish Army was already looking for a modernization program to improve the quality of the tank&#x27;s mobility. In 1987, the Spanish Army began a six-year modernization program which brought 150 tanks up to AMX-30EM2 standards and modified another 149 tanks to AMX-30EM1 standards. The former was a much more complete upgrade, which saw improvements to the tank&#x27;s mobility through the adoption of a new engine and gearbox, as well as to the tank&#x27;s firepower, with the development of a new kinetic energy penetrator and the introduction of a far more complex and accurate fire control system for the tank&#x27;s gunner, amongst other things. The AMX-30EM1 was termed a &quot;reconstruction&quot; and only saw improvements to the tank&#x27;s mobility by adopting a new transmission and renovating much of the vehicle&#x27;s worn out systems, such as the brakes, indicators and controls. These rebuilt AMX-30s were soon replaced by M60 Patton tanks procured from the United States in the early 1990s, while its fleet of AMX-30EM2s was later replaced by the B1 Centauro anti-tank vehicle.

In 1972, France was able to gain a contract with Saudi Arabia over the purchase of 190 of the AMX-30S variant, designed for the desert environment of the Middle Eastern nation. Named the Palmier Contract, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s tanks were delivered between 1973 and 1979, while 59 AMX-30Ds were exported between 1975 and 1979, 12 AMX-30Ps between 1977 and 1979, and finally 51 self-propelled howitzers, delivered between 1979 and 1980. Between 1979 and 1981, Saudi Arabia also received 52 AMX-30SAs and later 50 AMX-30C1 &quot;Shanine-2&quot;s delivered in two batches, between 1980 and 1989. By the 21st century, 50% of Saudi Arabia&#x27;s AMX-30 fleet were in storage, given that the AMX-30 lacked the capabilities to deal with more modern threats, such as against Iraqi T-62s and T-72s, and Israeli Merkava tanks. These were largely displaced by an order for 315 M1A2 Abrams tanks in 1989, and the acquisition of 450 M60A3 Patton tanks. Although Saudi Arabia planned to procure more M1 tanks, it was unable to do so for financial reasons and the AMX-30 has still not been retired.

Venezuela originally placed an order for 142 tanks in 1972, although this was later reduced to 82 and four AMX-30Ds. In the mid-1980s, Venezuela adopted a modernization plan for its deprecated AMX-30s, opting to replace the original engine with a new Continental AVDS-1790-5A diesel engine, producing and exchanging the existing transmission with an Allison CD-850-6A. Venezuelan AMX-30s received new fuel tanks, increasing the tank&#x27;s road range to , while firepower was improved through the adoption of a modern Lansadot MkI fire control system and Ballistic computer from Elbit Systems. In 1977, France and Qatar signed an agreement which garnered France another 24 AMX-30s sold, which would rise to 54 when Qatar ordered a further 30 AMX-30B2s in 1987. The United Arab Emirates placed an order in 1977 for 64 tanks and a single armoured recovery vehicle, to complete an armoured brigade, in 1977. Due to political issues between Chile and Argentina, the former placed an order for 46 tanks, although this was later cut short to 21 when the contract was canceled by the French government in 1981. In 1982, Cyprus acquired a total of 16 AMX-30B2s and a single AMX-30D, and later ordered another 36 AMX-30B2s. Total production of the AMX-30 and variants totaled 3,571 units.

Later many used vehicles were resold to other nations: in 2005 Cyprus had 102 AMX-30s (obtained from Greece) and 52 AMX-30B2s; Bosnia 32 AMX-30s (from the UAE). French strength had dwindled to about 250 AMX-30B2s.

==Combat history==

=== Athens Polytechnic uprising ===

In the early hours of 17 November 1973, an AMX-30 tank operated by the Greek junta crashed through the gates of the National Technical University of Athens, which had been occupied by students since 14 November. This was the beginning of the final events that ended the Athens Polytechnic uprising and the anti-junta revolt in Greece.

=== Gulf War ===

Qatari AMX-30s saw combat during the Gulf War at the Battle of Khafji, where on 30 January 1991 they counter-attacked in an attempt to retake the city of Khafji from Iraqi forces which had occupied it the night before. During the action, Qatari AMX-30s knocked out three Iraqi T-55s and captured four more. Two Qatari AMX-30s were lost during the battle.

The French participation in the Persian Gulf War, codenamed &quot;Opération Daguet&quot;, saw the deployment of the &quot;6e Division Légère Blindée&quot; (&quot;6th Light Armoured Division&quot;), referred to for the duration of the conflict as the &quot;Division Daguet&quot;. Most of its armoured component was provided by the AMX-10RCs of the cavalry reconnaissance regiments, but a heavy armoured unit, the &quot;4e Régiment de Dragons&quot; (&quot;4th Dragoon Regiment&quot;) was also sent to the region with a complement of 44 AMX-30B2s. Experimentally, a new regimental organisational structure was used, with three squadrons of thirteen tanks, a command tank and six reserve vehicles, instead of the then normal strength of 52 units. Also six older AMX-30Bs were deployed, fitted with Soviet mine rollers provided by Germany from East German stocks, and named &quot;AMX 30 Demin&quot;. The vehicles were all manned by professional crews, without conscripts. The Daguet Division was positioned to the West of the Coalition forces, to protect the left flank of the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps. This disposition gave the French commander greater autonomy, and also lessened the likelihood of encountering Iraqi T-72s, which were superior both to the AMX-10RCs and the AMX-30B2s. With the beginning of the ground offensive of 24 February 1991, French forces moved to attack its first target, &quot;Objective Rochambeau&quot;, which was defended by a brigade from the Iraqi 45th Infantry Division. A raid by Gazelle helicopters paved the way for an attack by the &quot;4e Régiment de Dragons&quot;. Demoralized by heavy coalition bombardments, the Iraqi defenders rapidly surrendered. The following day, the &quot;4e Dragons&quot; moved on to their next objective, &quot;Chambord&quot;, where they reported destroying ten tanks, three BMPs, fifteen trucks and five mortars with the assistance of USAF A-10s, and capturing numerous prisoners. The final objective was the As-Salman air base (&quot;Objective White&quot;), that was reported captured by 18:15, after a multi-pronged attack, with the &quot;4e Dragons&quot; attacking from the south. In all, the AMX-30s fired 270 main gun rounds.

=== Houthi–Saudi Arabian conflict ===

In 2015, Saudi Arabia&#x27;s AMX-30s and M1 Abrams tanks deployed along the border with Yemen. Two were lost.

<text>Reynaldo Ordóñez Pereira (born January 11, 1971) is a Cuban former professional baseball shortstop. He played nine seasons in Major League Baseball for the New York Mets, Tampa Bay Devil Rays, and Chicago Cubs.

==Early life==
Ordóñez was a promising young player for the Havana Industriales club in the Cuban National Series, and was named to the Cuban national team at the 1993 Summer Universiade in Buffalo, New York. He defected to the United States at the tournament, two days after teammate Eddie Oropesa; in doing so, he became only the third player since the Cuban Revolution to openly defect to the United States. In March 2013, Ordóñez finally traveled back to Cuba 20 years after defecting.

==Professional career==

===St. Paul Saints===
Before signing with a major league team, Ordóñez played part of the 1993 season with the St. Paul Saints of the Northern League. In 15 games with the Saints, he batted .283. He signed with the Mets as a free agent after the season, on October 29, 1993, and retired from baseball in 2007 after several years of injury-related absence from the majors.

===New York Mets===
Ordóñez joined the Single-A St. Lucie Mets of the Florida State League in 1994 and later that season moved up to Double-A with the Eastern League&#x27;s Binghamton Mets. He made his major league debut in 1996. Ordóñez won three consecutive Gold Glove Awards for his outstanding defensive play with the Mets from 1997 to 1999. During the 1999 and 2000 seasons, Ordóñez set a major league record for shortstops by playing 101 consecutive games without committing a fielding error. Furthermore, in 1999, Ordóñez committed only four errors while posting a .994 fielding percentage. It is arguably the best defensive single-season performance ever by a major league shortstop based on the number of errors.

Though he rarely struck out and was capable of laying down sacrifice bunts, Ordóñez was not a particularly effective hitter. Besides a career batting average of .246, he was not a good base stealer, drew few walks and little power. His lifetime OPS of .600 was almost 200 points lower than the major league average (.782 in 2000, for example).

Ordóñez&#x27;s defensive play never recovered after he fractured his left arm on May 29, 2000, when attempting to tag the Los Angeles Dodgers&#x27; F.P. Santangelo out at second base, an injury that prevented the three-time Gold Glove winner from playing in the 2000 World Series (the &quot;Subway Series&quot;) against the New York Yankees. Given that he offered little offensively, with his defense diminished, his value as a player became drastically reduced. Ordóñez was taunted by unhappy Mets fans throughout the 2002 season, particularly because the much-heralded double play combination of him and Roberto Alomar failed to produce.

===Devil Rays and Cubs===
On December 15, 2002, Ordóñez was traded to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for two minor league players to be named later, along with $4.25 million to cover his salary. Ordóñez missed most of the 2003 season due to injuries and signed with the Chicago Cubs in 2004. He made his Cubs debut in Game 1 of a doubleheader against the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 28. He recorded his first hit in a Cubs uniform on June 2 against the Houston Astros. Ordóñez played 23 games and recorded 10 hits before being given his release by the Cubs on July 23, 2004.

===San Diego Padres===
In 2004, incoming rookie Khalil Greene beat out Ordóñez for the position of shortstop with the San Diego Padres during spring training. He was unsure at the time whether he would ever play Major League Baseball again, and did not play for any major league organization during the and seasons.

===Seattle Mariners===
On November 14, 2006, Ordóñez was signed to a minor league contract by the Seattle Mariners. On April 1, 2007, Ordóñez was reassigned to the Mariners&#x27; minor league camp, but stated to the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; newspaper that at the age of 35, he was &quot;too old for that.&quot; According to reports, Ordóñez was originally included on the Mariners&#x27; final 25-man roster, but an 11th hour trade with the San Francisco Giants for outfielder Jason Ellison led to his reassignment. Ordóñez hoped to catch on with another major league franchise but never did.

==Personal life==
In 2001, Ordóñez agreed to pay his ex-wife, Hilda Maria Fiallo, $6,250 per month in child support, for their son, Rey Jr. This amounted to a 4,166 percent raise for Fiallo, who had been previously granted child support payments of only $1.50 per month by a Cuban court.

<doc id="1109597" wikidata="Q220096" url="?curid=1109597" title="José Reyes (infielder)">
<text>José Bernabe Reyes (born June 11, 1983) is a Dominican-American former professional baseball infielder. He played most notably at shortstop, in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the New York Mets, Miami Marlins, Toronto Blue Jays, and Colorado Rockies.

Reyes is a four-time MLB All-Star. He led MLB in triples in 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2011. Reyes also led the National League (NL) in stolen bases in 2005, 2006, and 2007. He was the NL batting champion in 2011. He is also the New York Mets&#x27; all-time leader in triples (113) and stolen bases (408).

==Minor league career==
Reyes was spotted by New York Mets scouts during a tryout camp in Santiago in the summer of 1999. After initial concerns over Reyes&#x27; slight frame, the Mets offered him a contract, which he signed on August 16, 1999. Despite traditionally sending youngsters to play in their Dominican academy, the Mets made an exception with Reyes and sent him to the Kingsport Mets of the Rookie-level Appalachian League for the 2000 season. He finished the season with a .250 batting average in 49 games.

For the 2001 season, Reyes was assigned to the Capital City Bombers of the Class A South Atlantic League. He excelled both in the field and at the plate, hitting .307 with 42 extra-base hits and winning the Player of the Year award.

After being invited to spring training with the major league Mets, Reyes began the 2002 season with the St. Lucie Mets in the Class A-Advanced Florida State League. In the first three months of the season, he demonstrated that he could handle the step up, and was promoted to the Binghamton Mets of the Double-A Eastern League. In his first game, Reyes had five hits and four RBIs, and he completed the season with a .287 average, 27 steals and 26 extra-base hits in 65 games.

On December 15, 2002, the Mets traded starting shortstop Rey Ordóñez to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. Two weeks later, the Mets signed veteran Rey Sánchez to a one-year deal, with the plan being to allow Reyes to mature in the minors while Sanchez kept the big-league spot warm for him. Reyes spent the first two months of the 2003 season with the Norfolk Tides of the Triple-A International League, where he batted .269 and stole 26 bases in just 42 games.

Injuries to Mike Piazza and Mo Vaughn had contributed to the Mets&#x27; poor performance in the National League East, and eventually convinced manager Art Howe to begin playing some of the team&#x27;s younger talent. When Rey Sánchez strained his thumb on June 5, 2003, Reyes received his call-up to the majors.

==Major League career==

===New York Mets (2003–11)===

====2003–05====
Reyes made his major league debut on June 10, 2003, against the Texas Rangers, the day before his 20th birthday, going 2-for-4 with a pair of runs scored in a 9–7 loss. Reyes was the first teenager to play for the Mets since Gregg Jefferies in 1987, and the first to start a game since Dwight Gooden in 1984. After the game, Reyes collected the ball from his first career hit and sent it to his parents. Over the following weeks Reyes&#x27; impressive form continued, including a grand slam off Jarrod Washburn in an 8–0 victory over the Angels. When Rey Sánchez completed his month-long spell on the DL, Reyes&#x27; strong play moved Sánchez to the bench.

Reyes&#x27; season was cut short a month early by a sprained ankle, but he still managed to compile impressive rookie numbers. In 69 games, he batted .307 with 32 RBIs and 13 stolen bases. Reyes finished 8th in voting for the 2003 NL Rookie of the Year.

Prior to the 2004 season, the Mets signed Japanese star Kazuo Matsui, whose only condition upon signing was that he got a chance to play his regular position, shortstop. As a result, Reyes was asked to learn second base duties. Early on in the season, Reyes strained a hamstring and remained on the DL until June 19.

When he returned, the Mets were involved in a close race in the National League East with the Marlins, Phillies, and Braves. However, a back problem for Reyes and injuries to other key Mets players led to a collapse and instead of being involved in a pennant race, the team found itself fighting to stay out of last place in the division. By the end of the season, Reyes had returned to his preferred position of shortstop, with Matsui moving to second base. Reyes ended a disappointing season with a batting average of .255, 14 RBIs, and 19 stolen bases in 53 games.

At the age of 21, Reyes was handed the leadoff spot in the Mets&#x27; lineup in his first full season in the major leagues. Despite struggling slightly with his plate discipline — he had only 27 walks in a league-high 733 plate appearances — he finished the season with solid numbers. In 161 games he had 48 extra-base hits, 58 RBIs and 60 stolen bases. Reyes led the National League in stolen bases and led the majors in triples. However, he also led all National League shortstops with 18 errors.

====2006–07====

During spring training in 2006, the Mets brought in former player Rickey Henderson as a specialist instructor. One of the reasons Henderson was hired was to help tutor Reyes in the arts of getting on base and stealing bases — skills at which Henderson excelled throughout his own career.

Reyes won Player of the Week honors in the National League for the weeks beginning June 12 and 19, becoming the first Mets player to be named the NL Player of the Week for two consecutive weeks since Jesse Orosco in 1983. During this two-week period Reyes had 32 hits in 57 at-bats (a .561 batting average) and raised his season batting average from .246 to .302. On June 21, 2006, in a 6–5 loss against the Cincinnati Reds Reyes hit for the cycle, becoming the ninth player in team history to do so.

Reyes&#x27; outgoing personality began to make him a fan favorite in New York. He became well known for the elaborate handshakes he creates with his teammates to celebrate runs scored. In his spots as &quot;Professor Reyes&quot;, Reyes taught the Shea faithful the Spanish language between innings on the stadium&#x27;s Diamond Vision screen, helping to make him one of the Mets&#x27; most popular players.

On August 3, 2006, Reyes signed a four-year, $23.25 million contract extension with the Mets, thereby avoiding salary arbitration. The contract includes an $11 million option for 2011 with a buy-out of $500,000 if the Mets do not pick up the option. Reyes also received a $1.5 million signing bonus.

On August 15, 2006, Reyes hit three home runs in an 11–4 loss against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. Two days later, he became the second player in Mets history to record at least 50 stolen bases in consecutive seasons. On September 7, 2006, Reyes hit the first inside-the-park home run of his career, against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Shea Stadium. Reyes was timed at 14.81 seconds for his dash around the bases — the equivalent of running a circular 100-meter dash in about 13.5 seconds.

As the 2006 season wound down, Reyes was in pursuit of an unusual feat — reaching 20 home runs, 20 triples, 20 doubles, and 20 stolen bases. Reyes finished the 2006 regular season with an average of .300, 19 home runs, 81 RBIs, 122 runs, and 64 stolen bases in 153 games. He increased his on-base percentage by 54 points, and his slugging percentage was almost 100 points higher than in 2005. Reyes&#x27; walk rate nearly doubled — in 30 fewer plate appearances, he went from 27 walks to 53. He also showed similar improvement in the field — in 2006 he had a range factor of 3.86, the lowest of all major league shortstops. Reyes picked up a Silver Slugger Award, was called up to his first All-Star Game, and finished 7th in NL MVP voting.

The Mets clinched their spot in the playoffs, and Reyes experienced the postseason for the first time in his career. He made his playoff debut on October 4, 2006, against the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 2006 National League Division Series. Though he hit just .167 for the series, he came up big in key situations, scoring the winning run in Game 1, driving in the go-ahead run in Game 2, and knocking in the game-tying run in the 6th inning of Game 3. In Game 6 of the 2006 National League Championship Series against the St. Louis Cardinals and facing elimination, Reyes hit a leadoff home run in the first inning to jump start his team and help force a deciding Game 7, which the Mets went on to lose, 3–1.

In November 2006, Reyes participated in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series along with teammates John Maine and David Wright. He hit a two-run walk-off home run in the 10th inning of Game 5, giving the MLB team their first sweep of their NPB rivals.

On July 12, 2007, Reyes hit the ninth leadoff home run of his career against Cincinnati Reds pitcher Bronson Arroyo, setting a new record for the franchise.

In August, Reyes stole his 50th base of the year, becoming the first New York baseball player to steal 50 or more bases in three consecutive seasons. On August 22, 2007, Reyes stole his 65th, 66th, and 67th bases and broke Roger Cedeño&#x27;s Mets record for the most stolen bases in a single season. August also saw Reyes tie the Mets record for stealing at least one base in four straight games.

In the last month of the season, Reyes&#x27; struggles were seen to be a key component of the Mets&#x27; late-season collapse. He batted .205 and had an on-base percentage of only .279. His struggles brought much criticism from Mets fans. On the second-to-last day of the regular season he was involved in a benches-clearing brawl against the Florida Marlins, which started when Miguel Olivo charged across the diamond and threw a punch at Reyes. Olivo would be ejected from the game and Reyes was allowed to stay in. The Mets would win the game 13–0. Reyes finished the season with a .280 batting average, 60 extra-base hits, 12 home runs, 57 RBIs, and 78 stolen bases in 160 games.

====2008–09====
In spring training and the early part of the 2008 season, Reyes vocalized a plan to focus a little more on baseball, and a little less on the theatrics — such as his dugout dances after home runs — that drew criticism during the late part of 2007 when the Mets were struggling. One of the casualties of this change of focus was the &quot;Professor Reyes&quot; segment played between innings at Shea where he taught the fans Spanish words and phrases. This was replaced by &quot;Maine Street USA&quot; with John Maine, and &quot;Do The Wright Thing&quot; with David Wright, which failed to match the popularity of Reyes&#x27; spots. However, with some prodding by his teammates, Reyes was encouraged to continue playing with the same energy as he had previously.

On July 3, Reyes&#x27; childhood friend Argenis Reyes was called up from the Triple-A New Orleans Zephyrs. When Argenis played, he and Reyes made up the middle infield for the Mets, with Argenis Reyes at second base. On July 20, Reyes overtook Mookie Wilson as the Mets&#x27; all-time triples leader after legging out his 63rd career triple in the fourth inning of a game against the Cincinnati Reds.

On September 10, Reyes broke the Mets&#x27; all-time record for stolen bases, previously held by Mookie Wilson, with his 282nd career stolen base coming in the third inning of a game against the Washington Nationals. After stealing second to break the record, he then stole third and scored the go-ahead run on a single by David Wright. On September 23, 2008, Reyes achieved his first 200-hit season with a bases-clearing triple. He is the second Mets player to reach this landmark, after Lance Johnson in 1996. Reyes finished the season with a batting average of .297, with 72 extra-base hits (including a majors-leading 19 triples), 68 RBIs and 56 stolen bases.

A few days before spring training, Mets manager Jerry Manuel announced that he was considering moving Reyes from the leadoff spot to 2nd or 3rd in the line-up. However, Reyes playing in the World Baseball Classic meant his playing time in the Mets training camp was limited, and led to Manuel deciding to move Reyes back to the leadoff spot. Speaking of the decision, Reyes said, &quot;That&#x27;s where I&#x27;ve hit all my life ... I&#x27;d like to be a leadoff hitter.&quot;

On May 3, 2009, Reyes was placed on the DL due to a calf injury. Reyes was expected to be back in early June but when rehabbing the injury he pulled himself from an extended spring training game; an MRI exam the following day revealed the tear, which Reyes confirmed was different from the initial injury. A September return was considered possible but he suffered yet another injury, a torn right hamstring while doing rehab work in August.

====2010====

On March 11, 2010, Reyes was diagnosed with a hyperactive thyroid gland, and was ordered by doctors to cease spring training activity. On March 23, his thyroid levels returned to normal and he was cleared to play. He was placed on the 15-day disabled list and missed the start of the regular season.

On May 25, he had his 1000th career hit off of the Phillies&#x27; Jamie Moyer. On June 8, Reyes hit a game-tying home run in the 7th inning with two outs that had to be reviewed. The shot was originally called a double because it bounced back into play. The Mets went on to win the game in the 11th on a walk off shot by Ike Davis.

On July 4, Reyes was selected to his third All-Star Game, but he was unable to play due to an injury; Dodgers shortstop Rafael Furcal replaced Reyes. However, Reyes still attended the All-Star Game with his family.

====2011====

On June 28, in his 1,000th career game, Reyes stole his 360th base. This put him in the top 100 all-time in stolen bases. Reyes was voted in as the starting shortstop for the National League in the 2011 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. However, he did not participate due to a strained left hamstring.

Throughout the 2011 season, there were talks about Reyes&#x27; future and if it would be with the Mets. He decided he did not want to talk about it until the end of the season. As well as being a possible top target for teams in free agency, he was reportedly involved in trade talks with multiple teams, but the Mets decided they would hold onto him for the rest of the season and make an effort to re-sign him.

Reyes was once again placed on the disabled list due to a strained left hamstring.

On the final day of the season, after bunting for a single in his first at-bat in the first inning, Reyes asked his manager to remove him from the game, ending his season with a .337 batting average, two points ahead of Ryan Braun of the Milwaukee Brewers in the race for the NL batting title. Braun went 0–4 later in the day to finish at .332. Reyes became the first Met in franchise history to win an NL batting title. Reyes&#x27;s decision came on the 70th anniversary of Ted Williams&#x27; refusal to sit out a doubleheader on the last day of the 1941 season, putting his .400 batting average at risk but ultimately hitting 6-for-8 and raising his average from .39955 to .406. Reyes played in 126 games in 2011, the fewest games played by a batting champion since Manny Ramirez&#x27;s 120 games played in 2002. He became a free agent at the end of the season.

===Miami Marlins (2012)===

On December 7, 2011, Reyes agreed to a six-year, $106 million contract with the Miami Marlins. Upon his signing with the Miami Marlins, he appeared on MLB Network where he had his signature dreadlocks cut off on February 3 to coincide with Marlins&#x27; dress code prohibiting long hair.

Reyes had the first Marlins hit at Marlins Park, against Kyle Lohse of the St. Louis Cardinals, breaking up a no-hitter in the 7th inning.

Reyes finished the year hitting .287 and finished second in the NL in triples (12), second in at-bats per strikeout (11.5), and third in steals (40). He split time between the leadoff role and batting third.

===Toronto Blue Jays (2013–15)===
On November 19, 2012, Reyes was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays along with Josh Johnson, Mark Buehrle, John Buck, and Emilio Bonifacio, in exchange for Jeff Mathis, Adeiny Hechavarria, Henderson Álvarez, Yunel Escobar, Jake Marisnick, Anthony DeSclafani, and Justin Nicolino. Reyes needed to be carted off the field during a game against the Kansas City Royals on April 12, 2013, after hearing a pop in his left ankle while sliding into second. Reyes was placed on the 15-day disabled list on April 13. On April 15, general manager Alex Anthopoulos reported that an MRI scan revealed no fracture and that no surgery would be required, but that Reyes was expected to miss three months. On April 15, CBS Sports reported that Reyes&#x27;s ankle injury was less severe than originally thought, reducing his time on the DL to eight weeks, but that was later refuted by Blue Jays management. He was placed on the 60-day disabled list on April 23 to make room for Aaron Laffey.
Reyes was held out of baseball activities for several weeks before playing two innings in a simulated game on June 14. He then began a rehab assignment in High-A Dunedin. Reyes played in 3 games and recorded a .417 average with 3 runs scored, 1 RBI and 1 stolen base. Reyes was promoted to Triple-A Buffalo on June 21, and scored the winning run against the Durham Bulls. After playing three games in Buffalo, Alex Anthopoulos said Reyes would play another game in Buffalo, followed by a game in Double-A New Hampshire. The plan was for Reyes to then be called up on June 27 when the Blue Jays begin a 4-game series against the Boston Red Sox, however it was later reported that Reyes would be called up one day earlier. Reyes went to Tampa Bay on June 25, rather than going to New Hampshire and was present in the dugout, despite not being able to play. He went 0–4 in his return to the lineup on June 26, but the Blue Jays won on R. A. Dickey&#x27;s complete game shutout 3–0. Reyes recorded his first hit since coming off the disabled list on June 28 against the Boston Red Sox. The hit was also his 1,500th career hit. Reyes played his first game at home since coming off the disabled list on Canada Day and went 3–5 with a solo home run. On August 2, in a 7–5 loss to the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, Reyes recorded his 500th career RBI on a two-run home run. In a game against the Seattle Mariners on August 6, Reyes hit his 100th career home run, a solo shot to lead off the game off of Félix Hernández.

After experiencing a minor hamstring strain during spring training, Reyes began the 2014 season batting leadoff for the Blue Jays. In his first at-bat on Opening Day he aggravated his hamstring injury while running to first base, and was placed on the 15-day disabled list at the end of the game. Reyes was activated on April 19, after playing in two rehab games with the High-A Dunedin Blue Jays. He avoided the disabled list for the rest of the season, playing in 143 games and batting .287 with 9 home runs, 51 RBI, and 30 stolen bases.

On April 28, 2015, Reyes was placed on the 15-day disabled list due to a rib strain. He was activated on May 25. Before being traded to Colorado, Reyes had batted .285 with 4 home runs and 34 RBI in 69 games with the Blue Jays.

===Colorado Rockies (2015)===
On July 27, 2015, Reyes was traded to the Colorado Rockies, along with Jeff Hoffman, Miguel Castro, and Jesús Tinoco, in exchange for Troy Tulowitzki and LaTroy Hawkins. In 47 more games with the Rockies, Reyes batted .259 with three home runs, 19 RBI, and eight stolen bases. Overall in 2015, combined with both teams, Reyes played 132 total games with a .274 batting average, 24 stolen bases, 19 home runs, and 53 RBI.

=== Second stint with the New York Mets (2016–2018) ===
On June 25, 2016, Reyes became a free agent and signed a minor league contract with the New York Mets. Reyes began his second stint in the Mets organization by being assigned to the Brooklyn Cyclones. In his stints with the Cyclones and the Binghamton Mets, Reyes batted .176, and made an error at third base. On July 4, the Mets announced that they would be activating Reyes on July 5. In his first MLB game with the Mets since 2011, Reyes went 0-for-4. On July 30, Reyes was placed on the 15-day disabled list with a Grade 1 intercostal muscle strain.

Reyes returned from the disabled list in August, and proceeded to become what some considered the spark for a run deprived Mets offense. On September 22, Reyes hit a two-run home run in the bottom of the 9th inning in a pivotal game against the Philadelphia Phillies to even the score at 6–6. Asdrúbal Cabrera would later hit a three-run home run in the 11th inning to win, 9–8, propelling the Mets to a Wild Card berth. Reyes batted .267 with eight home runs and 24 RBIs in 2016. After 60 games with the Mets in 2016, the club picked up its option on its contract with Reyes, keeping him with the team for the major league minimum salary in 2017.
Prior to the 2017 season, Reyes began working out as a full-time utility player, playing the infield and center field. Reyes&#x27; first appearance in center field came on May 13 against the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller Park. He only played one inning in center field, before finishing the game at shortstop. On May 20, Reyes collected his 2,000 career hit; a single off Los Angeles Angels pitcher Alex Meyer. On July 24, Reyes became the 39th player in MLB history to steal 500 career bases.

In 2017, he batted .246/.315/.413, the lowest batting average of his major league career, with 15 home runs and 75 runs scored. After the season, he re-signed with the Mets on a one-year, $2 million contract.

On July 31, 2018, when the Mets were already down 19–1 to the Washington Nationals, Reyes fulfilled a longtime dream and pitched the 8th inning, conceding six runs, including two home runs. He then became the first MLB player since Cap Anson in 1884 to give up two home runs as a pitcher in one game and subsequently hit two home runs in the following game (on August 1). In 2018, he batted .189/.260/.320 with five stolen bases (each a career low).

He elected free agency on October 29, 2018.

On July 29, 2020, Reyes announced his official retirement from professional baseball on his Twitter account.

==International career==

===2006 World Baseball Classic===
Reyes represented the Dominican Republic in the 2006 World Baseball Classic. The team finished top of their group in both the first and second rounds, but fell to Puerto Rico in the semi-finals. Reyes&#x27; playing time was limited due to the presence of Miguel Tejada in the shortstop spot. In 6 at-bats, Reyes collected 1 hit and 1 run, as well as 2 stolen bases.

===2009 World Baseball Classic===
Reyes was again called up to the Dominican Republic team for the 2009 competition. He had a disappointing tournament as the Dominican Republic were eliminated after only three games, suffering two defeats against the underdog Netherlands team. Reyes finished the tournament with just one hit and two runs from nine at-bats.

===2013 World Baseball Classic===
After two disappointing tournaments in 2006 and 2009, Reyes and the Dominican Republic team ran the table in 2013 tournament going 7–0 to make it to the Classic Final against Puerto Rico. They defeated their 2009 nemesis the Netherlands in the semifinal 4–1 and redeemed their 2009 losses. In the final, the Dominican Republic defeated Puerto Rico 3–0 to become the first team to go undefeated in the tournament. Reyes had a much better tournament in 2013, batting .314 with a home run and 11 hits.

==Music==
Reyes is a dembow musician and owner of a record label. In May 2011, Reyes released his debut song, &quot;Bat Roto&quot; (Spanish for &quot;Broken Bat&quot;), that was played on Spanish radio stations and in nightclubs in the United States and the Dominican Republic. In July, he released a video for his reggaeton song named &quot;No Hay Amigo&quot; (&quot;There is No Friend&quot;), which featured established reggaeton artists Julio Voltio, Vakero, and Big Mato.

Reyes used the song Chacarron by El Chombo for his walk-up music throughout his career with the New York Mets.

Reyes created a record label, EL7 Music, whose name was inspired by his uniform number. As of 2011, he had financed all of the label&#x27;s operations.

He is featured in the song &quot;5 Mujeres&quot; by Lirico En La Casa released with a music video by March 22, 2019.

==Personal life==

After leaving the Mets for free agency, Reyes continued to make his offseason home on Long Island. He had lived in Manhasset, New York with his wife, Katherine, and then moved to Old Brookville. Reyes was a close friend to former right-handed pitcher José Lima. When Lima died May 23, 2010, Reyes said, &quot;He&#x27;s the funniest guy you could ever meet, he always smiled, he was always happy. It was good to know him. It&#x27;s a real tough day...I&#x27;ve known him a long time. People in the Dominican Republic love the guy a lot, so it&#x27;s a very tough day not only for the Dominican people, but for everyone because of the guy that he was.&quot;

Reyes married Katherine Ramirez on July 25, 2008. They have three daughters and a son together: Catherine, Ashley, Joselyn and Fernando.

Reyes and his wife became American citizens on April 4, 2018.

=== Domestic violence ===
During the 2015–16 offseason, Reyes was charged with domestic violence, stemming from an incident with his wife while on vacation in Wailea, Hawaii. He allegedly grabbed her by the throat and shoved her into a door before hotel security called the police. She was taken to the emergency room with injuries to the side, neck, and wrist. On February 23, 2016, MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred announced that Reyes would be placed on paid administrative leave until at least April, when his trial began. On March 30, 2016, prosecutors in Maui moved to dismiss the domestic abuse charges on the grounds that his wife was refusing to cooperate as a witness. On May 13, Manfred announced that Reyes was suspended without pay until May 31, spanning the Colorado Rockies&#x27; first 51 games of the season. On May 31, the day his suspension expired, he was optioned to Triple-A Albuquerque for a rehab assignment. Despite projections that he would return to the team, he was designated for assignment by the Rockies on June 15.

== Media appearances ==
On December 7, 2007, Reyes was announced as the cover athlete for &quot;Major League Baseball 2K8&quot; from 2K Sports, taking over from New York Yankees counterpart Derek Jeter. Reyes was also the cover athlete for the Nintendo DS spinoff, &quot;Major League Baseball 2K8 Fantasy All-Stars&quot;, albeit in cartoon form.

<doc id="1109603" wikidata="Q7801283" url="?curid=1109603" title="Tiffin School">
<text>Tiffin School is a boys&#x27; grammar school in Kingston upon Thames, England. It has specialist status in both the performing arts and languages. The school moved from voluntary aided status to become an Academy School on 1 July 2011. Founded in 1880, Tiffin School educates 1,400 pupils as of March 2023.

==Admissions==
Entry into the school is by academic selection, using both an English and a mathematics test. The school admits 180 students each year in year 7. Since at least 2002, students have been able to apply to join Tiffin for Sixth Form (Years 12 and 13); approximately 35-40% of the boys are &#x27;new boys&#x27;, from other schools. Admission to the sixth form is based on GCSE results. From September 2019, the Sixth Form became co-educational and admits around 80 girls. Tiffin remains an all boys’ school from Years 7 to 11.

==History==
Plans were drawn up in 1874 for two new schools; Tiffin Boys&#x27; School and Tiffin Girls&#x27; School, each taking 150 pupils. A single building by the Fairfield housing both schools was opened in January 1880.

In 1929, the boys&#x27; school moved to its present site, in Queen Elizabeth Road near the centre of Kingston. It became a grammar school under the Education Act 1944. The school changed from being voluntary-controlled to being grant-maintained in 1992. On 1 July 2011, the school achieved Academy status.

===New buildings===

In 1937, a new building was opened for the Girls&#x27; School for 480 pupils. They had previously been in the same building as the Boys&#x27; School.

In 2011, an all-weather AstroTurf pitch was erected on part of the old grass field, funded by Jim Dixon and a National Lottery grant. The cricket nets were refurbished and named the Neil Desai cricket nets to commemorate his death.

Over the course of late 2017 and early 2018, a new building attached to the existing Dempsey Centre was opened.

==Present day==

There are between 180 and 190 boys in each year, and about 500 in the Sixth Form. In 2019, the school began admitting girls to the sixth form, with an aim to have at least 100 girls overall between the Lower and Upper Sixth. 
The Dempsey Centre, named after Dr Tony Dempsey, who retired as head in 2004, was opened in September of that year.
It contains ICT suites, a lecture theatre, a library and a new careers office.

In 2004, Sean Heslop took over as head of Tiffin School, due to Dempsey&#x27;s retirement. Heslop subsequently left the school in 2009 to take a position at Folkestone Academy. He was subsequently arrested and bailed by the police on the charge of abusing a position of trust with a minor. He was acquitted of all charges.

In 2009, Hilda Clarke became the first female head of Tiffin School. She is a former head of Langley Grammar School in Slough and former deputy head of Tiffin Girls&#x27; School in Kingston upon Thames. In November 2014, it was announced that Clarke had stepped down and was replaced by the former deputy head and longstanding history teacher Mike Gascoigne. The current head is Garth Williams.

==Ofsted report==
The Ofsted report in 2002 stated that &quot;the school is very popular; annually, it receives around 1,300 applications for the 140 available places. Very nearly all 16-year-olds continue into the Sixth Form and around 40 more join the Sixth Form each year from other schools. On entry, the pupils’ and Sixth Form students’ attainment is very high compared with the national average.&quot; In the 2007 Ofsted Report, Tiffin was rated outstanding (grade 1) in every area.

In the 2013 Ofsted Report, pupils&#x27; exam results overall were in the top 40% of similar schools&#x27; results, and in the top 20% of all schools.

In the 2022 Ofsted Report, Tiffin was rated &#x27;good&#x27; (grade 2) overall. 

==Academic achievement==
According to the &quot;Sunday Times&quot; Parent Power Guide, the school is ranked 10th in the top hundred State Secondary Schools based on 2011 examination results. The 2011 results for the school are:

* A-level %A*-B: 90.9
* GCSE %A*-A: 82.8
In 2022, the school achieved its &quot;best set of grades&quot; for GCSEs and A levels in the last 10 years. 

* A-level %A*-B: 91.46
* GCSE %9-7: 84.52

==Music==
The school has a prestigious choir and several musical ensembles, including a swing band and symphony orchestra, of which many pupils are also members of the nearby Thames Youth Orchestra. Every year, the school performs an oratorio either held in the Rose Theatre or the Tiffin Sports Hall, which consists of students, parents, staff and friends and is accompanied by the London Mozart Players or the Brandenburg Symphony Orchestra or the Sinfonia Britannica. 

===Tiffin Boys&#x27; Choir===
The Tiffin Boys&#x27; Choir (directed by James Day), which celebrated its 60th anniversary in 2017, performs at venues including the Royal Opera House, the Royal Festival Hall, and the Barbican with London orchestras, and it regularly goes on tour. The choir has recorded CDs such as &quot;Rejoice in the Lamb&quot; and &quot;Christmas at Tiffin&quot;. It has also appeared on recordings of Mahler with Klaus Tennstedt, Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; with Antonio Pappano and Britten&#x27;s &quot;War Requiem&quot; with Kurt Masur. The choir was featured on the last episode of &quot;TFI Friday&quot;, on the soundtrack of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; starring Kate Winslet, and on the subsequently released top-ten Kate Winslet single &quot;What If&quot;.

==Sports==
Tiffin School is active in all the main sports. It has facilities for rugby, athletics, football and cricket at a 29-acre (119,000 m²) site in East Molesey near Hampton Court, known as Grist&#x27;s (named after a former headmaster). Tiffin School Boat Club is based at Canbury Boathouse, which is shared with Kingston Rowing Club along the Thames at Canbury Gardens. The school has a sports hall and all-weather AstroTurf pitch which are used by external sports clubs after and before school hours. Tiffin School provides ball boys for The Championships, Wimbledon.

==Notable former pupils==
Former pupils are known as Old Tiffinians. The Tiffinian Association arranges reunion events such as dinners and sports fixtures.

<doc id="1109607" wikidata="Q7552516" url="?curid=1109607" title="Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers">
<text>The Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) was founded in Los Angeles, California in 1974 by a group of engineers employed by the city of Los Angeles. Their objective was to form a National organization of professional engineers to serve as role models in the Latino community.
Social Networking was the key basis for the organization, as SHPE quickly established two student chapters to begin the network that would grow to encompass the nation and reach countries outside the United States. Currently, there are close to 300 chapters across the United States that are part of SHPE&#x27;s network.

On June 1, 2017, SHPE announced Raquel Tamez would join the organization as Chief Executive Officer. One month later, Miguel Alemañy was announced as the new Chair of the National Board of Directors.

Along with AISES, NSBE, and SWE, SHPE is a founding member of the 50K Coalition, the collaborative is made up of more than 40 organizations with the goal of producing 50,000 diverse engineering graduates every year by the year 2025. In addition to SHPE, SHPE is also a member of the STEM Education Coalition, which raises public awareness about the critical role that STEM education plays in enabling the United States to remain the economic and technological leader of the global marketplace for years to come.

== Programs ==
Volunteer leaders serve in leadership roles within SHPE&#x27;s regions and chapters, which deliver SHPE&#x27;s core programs. In addition to raising awareness of STEM and increasing access to it among Hispanic and Latino communities, SHPE&#x27;s programs serve K-12, undergraduate, graduate students, as well as academic and industry professionals. SHPE offers the following individual programs in addition to its overall leadership development framework (SHPEology) for undergraduates, graduate students, and working professionals. There are a number of programs run by SHPE, which are listed below:

* SHPE Academics: Supports the journey of those in academia
* SHPE Professionals: Offers leadership strategies that make a positive workplace impact
* SHPE Technology &amp; Innovation: Shines a spotlight on the latest technology and innovation in STEM
* SHPE K-12: Offers student-focused programs to get young people excited about STEM
* MentorSHPE: Provides a platform for members to build lasting relationships with other members
* Noche de Ciencias: Family science night events promoting STEM awareness to K-12 students
* ScholarSHPE: Offers students financial support to narrow the gap in the Hispanic and Latino STEM education pipeline
* SHPEology: Designed to raise awareness about the importance of Hispanic and Latino inclusion in STEM
* SHPEtina: Empowering Latinas in STEM offers strategies to thrive and overcome obstacles 

== Events ==
SHPE also maintains a strong network by hosting three annual events offering leadership skills training and networking opportunities for its membership and supporters. These events include:

* National Convention. As the organization&#x27;s signature event, this is the largest technical and career conference for Hispanics and Latinos in the United States, attracting over 6,000 engineering professionals, students, and corporate representatives. The conference features educational and technical panel discussions and workshops for its professional and student attendees. In addition, companies recruit talent for jobs and internships via a Career Fair Expo, as well as support competitions that allow undergraduate and graduate students the opportunity to showcase their talents. There are specialized programs available for pre-college students, prospective graduate students, and academic and engineering professionals, as well as a Distinguished Lecture Series led by STEM academics.
* National Institute for Leadership Advancement (NILA). This conference convenes newly elected chapter leaders from SHPE&#x27;s undergraduate and professional chapters, offering leadership, community engagement, and mentorship skills training through workshops, lectures, individual and team exercises, hands-on activities, and small group breakout sessions. All attendees receive the Certified Chapter Leader certificate upon program completion.
* Regional Leadership Development Conference (RLDC). These conferences, which are held in all seven of SHPE&#x27;s regions at a university, convene members of a region&#x27;s student chapters to improve their organizational, managerial, and technical skills. There is a focus on developing and improving chapters’ K-12 outreach programs, chapter infrastructure improvement, and corporate network strengthening.

<text>The Pan-Purple Coalition () or the Alliance of Fairness and Justice (AFJ, ) is a social activist umbrella group based in the Republic of China (Taiwan). The coalition brings together nine social welfare organizations and promotes the causes of the underprivileged. It supports progressive taxation, a national social welfare system, education reforms, and gender and ethnic equality.

Its name is a reference to the Pan-Blue Coalition and the Pan-Green Coalition, two political coalitions also based in Taiwan. The Pan-Purple Coalition has accused Pan-Blue and Pan-Green of causing ethnic rifts running along the issue of unification with China vs. independence, and has rejected overtures to join either group despite having organizations which individually had former associations with either group. Ultimately, they are not considered a political faction within Taiwan but rather a group which supports the current status quo situation between mainland China and Taiwan.

<doc id="1109655" wikidata="Q3313196" url="?curid=1109655" title="Mike Allred">
<text>Michael Dalton &quot;Mike&quot; Allred (born 1962) is an American comic book artist and writer. He is most well known for his independent comics creation Madman and for co-creating and drawing the comic book series &quot;iZombie&quot;. His work often draws upon pop art, as well as commercial and comic art of the 1950s and 1960s.

==Early life==
Michael Dalton Allred was born in 1962 in Roseburg, Oregon. His father, Dale Leroy Allred (May 20, 1926 – October 5, 2007), was born in Portland, Oregon. He was a psychologist and professor at Umpqua Community College and the University of Oregon, and received a Doctor of Philosophy in 1959 at Purdue University. Allred&#x27;s mother, RaeBell Jenkins (née Bird; July 19, 1934 – February 17, 2014), was born in Bluebell, Utah. The two married in December 1951 in Salt Lake City, Utah. In 1973, Allred&#x27;s parents divorced, and he stayed with his father in Eugene, Oregon, while his brothers and mother moved to Utah. In 1980, he attended Ricks College as an art major but switched to broadcasting fearing that he couldn&#x27;t make a living as an artist.

==Career==
Mike Allred began his career as a radio host on KYES AM 950 (KY95) in Roseburg, Oregon. He later became a television reporter in Europe, and started drawing comics in 1989 with the 104-page graphic novel &quot;Dead Air&quot; (Slave Labor Graphics). The story loosely followed his stint in radio as a sidebar to the true focus of the novel, the effects of post-nuclear war over a small Oregon town. He followed this up with his similarly titled works &quot;Graphique Musique&quot; (1990) and &quot;Grafik Muzik&quot; (Caliber Comics 1990–1991), in which he set out the style that he was to become known for with his most famous character, Madman.

Madman first appeared as Frank Einstein in &quot;Creatures of the Id&quot; and &quot;Grafik Muzik&quot; published in 1990, but it wasn&#x27;t until March 1992 that the first &quot;Madman&quot; miniseries debuted from Tundra Publishing in March 1992. The series gained further recognition with its move to Dark Horse Comics in April 1994, where it was relaunched as &quot;Madman Comics&quot; and went on to be nominated for several Harvey Awards. &quot;Madman Comics&quot; ran for 20 issues and ended in 2000. From 2007 to 2009, Image Comics published &quot;Madman: Atomic Comics&quot; for 17 issues.

Allred drew part of the 1993 &quot;Worlds&#x27; End&quot; story arc in Neil Gaiman&#x27;s &quot;The Sandman&quot; series.

Allred appeared as himself in the 1997 feature film &quot;Chasing Amy&quot; as part of the opening scene at a comic book convention, signing copies of his comic &quot;Madman&quot;. He also provides the artwork for the fictional comic book &quot;Bluntman and Chronic&quot;.

Allred himself gained further mainstream attention with the science-fiction/rock-and-roll comic &quot;Red Rocket 7&quot; (Dark Horse, 1997) and his art for writer Peter Milligan&#x27;s series &quot;X-Force&quot;, which he began drawing in July 2001, and subsequently became &quot;X-Statix&quot;. In 2000, AAA Pop published Allred&#x27;s &quot;The Atomics&quot;, featuring a group of beatniks with superpowers. Issue #116 of &quot;X-Force&quot;, the first collaboration between Allred and Milligan, was the first Marvel comic book to not have the Comics Code Authority stamp of approval since 1971.

In 2004 and 2005, Allred wrote and drew &quot;The Golden Plates&quot;, an adaptation of the Book of Mormon. Allred is a Latter-Day Saint, and completed much of the work on this project in collaboration with his wife Laura Allred.

Allred worked again with Neil Gaiman in 2009 on the Metamorpho feature in &quot;Wednesday Comics&quot;. The &quot;Madman All-New Giant-Size Super-Ginchy Special!&quot; was published in April 2011. Allred and writer Matt Fraction crafted a &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; spinoff series, &quot;FF&quot;, in 2013. The following year, Allred and writer Dan Slott launched a new &quot;Silver Surfer&quot; series at Marvel. His comic book series &quot;iZombie&quot;, which ran from 2010 to 2012, was adapted into a 2015 television series of the same name. Allred drew the 1960s variant cover for &quot;Action Comics&quot; #1000 (June 2018).

His wife, Laura, frequently works as his colorist. Mike Allred had worked with Mark Russell in 2022 and 2024 to make Superman: Space Age (2022), and Batman: Dark Age (2024).

==Personal life==
Allred was raised as a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. He considers himself a Mormon, though a liberal-leaning one, and has stated that he still identifies with the beliefs. He considers the Book of Mormon to be a phenomenal and fascinating story irrespective of its factual accuracy.

==Awards==
Allred&#x27;s retro-styled artwork is a frequent nominee for comics awards such as the Harveys, the Eisners, and the Eagles. In his career, he has received:

* 2005 Special AML Award for &quot;The Golden Plates&quot;
* 2009 Inkpot Award
* 2011 AML Award in the category of &quot;Special Award in Graphical Narrative&quot; for a lifetime of comic art
* 2015 The television adaptation of his Vertigo comic book series &quot;iZombie&quot; was the recipient of the Best New Fandom award at the 2015 MTV Fandom Awards
* 2016 The Eisner Award for Best Single Issue/One Shot (&quot;Silver Surfer&quot; #11)
