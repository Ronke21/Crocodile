<text>Arima, officially The Royal Chartered Borough of Arima is the easternmost and second largest in area of the three boroughs of Trinidad and Tobago. It is geographically adjacent to Sangre Grande and Arouca at the south central foothills of the Northern Range. To the south is the Caroni–Arena Dam. Coterminous with Town of Arima since 1888, the borough of Arima is the fourth-largest municipality in population in the country (after Port of Spain, Chaguanas and San Fernando). The census estimated it had 33,606 residents in 2011.

In 1887, the town petitioned Queen Victoria for municipal status as part of the celebration for the Golden Jubilee of Queen Victoria. This was granted in the following year, and Arima became a Royal Borough on 1 August 1888. Historically the third-largest town of Trinidad and Tobago, Arima is fourth since Chaguanas became the largest town in the country.

== History ==
Contrary to the belief that the city is named after the Arawak word for &quot;water&quot;, rooted in the Arima River, it was actually named after a plant and its roots that was used for fishing by the First Peoples.

==Geography==
=== Climate ===
The borough has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen &quot;Af&quot;), bordering on a tropical monsoon climate, characterised with little seasonal variations due to its close proximity to the Northern Range. Temperatures typically range from 20 to 31 degrees Celsius, and annual rainfall averages around 2000 millimeters. The wet season lasts from June to November, and although there is no true dry season, there is a noticeably drier stretch from January to April. Hail has occurred in the town but is rare.

==Culture and entertainment==
Arima hosts an annual Borough Day anniversary celebration in August. The celebration incorporates Carnival-style street parades and usually coincides with the staging of the Santa Rosa Carib Community annual festival. The annual Arima Carnival includes street parades of masqueraders on Carnival Tuesday, J&#x27;ouvert bands on Carnival Monday, as well as a local calypso competition.

== Neighborhoods and suburbs ==
The borough contains may communities and population center, often names after the plantations on which existed where they once situated including:

* O’Meara
* Santa Rosa Heights
* The Crossings 
* Malabar
* Tumpna Road
* Calvary Hill
* Torrecilla Gardens 
* La Florissant 
* Christina Gardens
* Gopaul Lands

==Transportation==

===Highways and roads===
The major land transportation arteries are the Churchill–Roosevelt Highway, Eastern Main Road and the Priority Bus Route which all link Arima with major towns and cities along the East–West Corridor metropolitan area. Among other important routes are the Arima Bypass, Cocorite Street, Tumpuna Road and O&#x27;Meara Road which links neighbourhoods around the town to the Town Center.

===Transit===
Arima plays an important role for north-eastern Trinidad as a multi-modal transportation hub for many of the towns and neighbourhoods on the eastern side of the island. A bus terminal provides service by the PTSC Bus network to Sangre Grande, Mundo Nuevo, Blanchisseuse, Carapo, Malabar, Morne La Croix, La Horquetta, Wallerfield Brasso Seco and to the capital Port of Spain.

Maxi taxis (private, owner-operated minibuses) operate throughout Trinidad and Tobago as a kind of semi-public transport. They operate along fixed routes, have fixed fares and meeting points, but do not operate under a fixed schedule. These maxi taxis provide services from the town center to Port of Spain via the Priority Bus Route and Churchill-Roosevelt Highway, making stops along the East–West Corridor. They also provide transport to Sangre Grande.

== Sports ==

The major national super-league team, FC Santa Rosa and Arima Football League, which is based at the Arima Velodrome.

Abilene Wildcats Athletic Club, Trinity College East Athletics Club, Silver Bullets Athletic Club, D&#x27;Abadie Progressive Athletic Club, and Spartans High Speed Performance Athletic Club are also based in Arima.

Most suburbs, communities and neighbourhoods around the Borough have their own sporting complexes and community swimming pools.

The three major sporting arenas in Arima are:

*The Larry Gomes Stadium
*Arima Velodrome
*Santa Rosa Race Track 
*Sunil Narine and Larry Gomes are West Indies cricket players born in Arima.

== Attractions ==
*Asa Wright Nature Centre, located in Arima Valley, it has a nature walk and swimming at a natural stream pool.
*Santa Rosa Carib Centre, located on Paul Mitchell Road, off De Gannes Street in Arima, it contains items from Arima&#x27;s native Carib history and is the headquarters of the Carib Queen. It also has displays about Carib descendants in Arima. Native items are also available for purchase.
*Cleaver Woods, it has nature walks and Amerindian exhibits.
*Princess Royal Park (Arima Savannah) is a wide, open, savannah, surrounded by Pro Queen Street to the east, Robinson Street to the south, Queen Mary Avenue to the west and the Arima Velodrome to the north.

===Utilities===

Electric generation is handled by Powergen, while electrical distribution is handled by the Trinidad and Tobago Electricity Commission (T&amp;TEC). Powergen has natural gas fired generation plants at Point Lisas, Penal, and Wrightson Road in Port of Spain. Additional power can be supplied from power generation facilities controlled by Inncogen at Point Lisas.

Telecommunications are regulated by the Telecommunications Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (TATT). It has been working to break up the monopoly, granting several new licences in 2005 to new companies in the market. Fixed-line telephone service is a monopoly controlled by Telecommunications Services of Trinidad and Tobago (TSTT). Licenses have been granted for competition in this area, but start-up is a while away. Wireless telephony is controlled by TSTT and bmobile, as well as Digicel, which came later. Licenses have been granted for a private company, Laqtel, to offer wireless service in competition with TSTT and Digicel. However, Laqtel had its licence revoked, and is undergoing severe financial difficulties.

Digital cable television is provided by Flow. High-speed internet service of up to 100 Mbit/s and digital landline telephone service are all available in Arima.

Water and sewerage are under the purview of the Water and Sewerage Authority of Trinidad and Tobago (WASA).

==Education==
There are 17 primary (private and public) and 4 secondary educational institutions in Arima, and some post-secondary level technical training institutes. St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent in Arima was closed many years ago and the building now houses a retreat centre called Emmaus Centre.

<text>The Holden Caprice is a full-size car which was produced by Holden in Australia from 1990 to October 2017. The similar Holden Statesman, which was also introduced in 1990 as a model below the Caprice, was discontinued in September 2010. Between 1971 and 1984, Holden marketed their long-wheelbase sedans under the Statesman marque.

Statesman and Caprice are essentially long-wheelbase variants of the Commodore range, and as of 2006, were the largest rear-wheel drive sedans offered by GM. Internationally, Statesmans and Caprices have been rebadged as the Buick Royaum, Daewoo Statesman, and Chevrolet Caprice. In addition, these cars have formed the basis of the Chinese-built Buick Park Avenue and the Bitter Vero, a rebodied version from Germany.

The main difference between the Statesman and the Caprice lies within their equipment packages. Moreover, Caprices are commonly powered by V8 engines rather than V6s and, whilst modern Caprices may be mistaken as fully specified versions of the cheaper Statesman, the two were separate Holden models in the past. In appearance, Caprices can be distinguished by their unique interior and exterior trim such as the grille insert. In addition to the large V8 engine, in latter years, the Caprice suspension was often more sport-oriented (from the 2003 WK series).

Traditionally in Australia, the Statesman and Caprice have been direct rivals to the Ford Fairlane and LTD, respectively. However, Ford&#x27;s decision to discontinue these models in 2007 left Holden with the Chrysler 300C as the only direct competition at pricing point occupied, at least until the launch of the Hyundai Genesis in 2015. As announced by Holden in 2014, its entire Australian production comprising the Caprice ceased in 2017.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;&quot; means impulsive, unpredictable or sudden condition, or series of changes or a brief romance.

== Statesman (HQ–WB; 1971–1984) ==


Prior to the introduction of the Holden Statesman and Caprice models in 1990, Holden marketed its long-wheelbase sedan range through a separate Statesman marque, absent of all &quot;Holden&quot; branding. These original vehicles, were sold through the General Motors-Holden&#x27;s dealership channel, and were based on the mainstream Holden range (Belmont, Kingswood, Monaro and Premier), offering more luxury, additional length than the Holden sedan and coupe models (the Statesman shared the same wheelbase as the Holden Wagon, Utility and Panel Van), and styling to differentiate it from the smaller Holden sedans. The first of such cars were introduced in 1971 as the HQ series Statesman, replacing the short-lived Holden Brougham. Although designed specifically for the Australian market, front end styling of the Statesman Caprice bears a strong resemblance to the 1971 North American Chevrolet Caprice. Subsequent HJ, HX and HZ models were updates to the original HQ bodywork, as was the final WB series which introduced a new six-window glasshouse. WB represented the most significant update yet, with only the front doors and bonnet common with the HZ sheetmetal. Notwithstanding these alterations, the WB fell short of great market success, that is, until 1984 when production cessation was announced, generating a rapid sales ascent. For Holden, the decision had been made—the line&#x27;s discontinuance was irreversible.

== First generation (1990–1999) ==

=== VQ ===


In March 1990, after a six-year hiatus since the WB Statesman&#x27;s dismissal, demand for a long-wheelbase luxury sedan in Australia saw Holden resurrect the Statesman and Caprice names. Given the model designation VQ, these new luxury models utilised the long-wheelbase chassis taken from the VN Commodore station wagon, as opposed to the VN sedan&#x27;s short-wheelbase. These VN models were in turn heavily revised and enlarged versions of the Opel Omega A. In comparison to the regular Commodore sedan, VQs added an additional of length, and were still longer than the VN wagon.

Holden made many efforts to distinguish the Statesman from the Commodore, on which it is based. These features include a formal grille and a very different glasshouse reminiscent of contemporary GM products such as the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme (&quot;see image&quot;), and the rear license plate repositioned to the bumper, while incorporating the doors and headlights from the Commodore station wagon. Both Statesman and Caprice models were offered and equipped with independent rear suspension—a feature introduced one year later on high-end VP Commodores. Also in 1991, Holden introduced the VQ Series II models. The Series II Caprice ushered anti-lock brakes as standard, however it was optional on the Statesman. The Commodore&#x27;s 3.8-litre &quot;3800&quot; V6 engine was now optional on the Statesman only, with the old 5.0-litre V8 remaining standard across the range. Both powerplants were mated with a four-speed &quot;THM700R4&quot; automatic transmission.

Holden Special Vehicles offered several different versions of the VQ Statesman and Caprice, with enhanced performance and appearance. These vehicles were designated as HSV Statesman 5000i, SV90 and SV93.
=== VR ===


The VR followed in March 1994, mirroring the model change of the standard VR Commodore, incorporating engineering improvements as well as sheet metal changes. The updated running gear included a new electronically controlled version of the &quot;GM 4L60-E&quot; automatic transmission, and the latest revision of the Buick 3.8-litre V6 engine. The engine now featured rolling-element bearings in the valve rocker arms, increasing compression ratios from the VQ II series engine. The revised V6 was now standard on the Statesman and available for the very first time as an option on the Caprice. These changes combined to deliver an increase in power to and further improvement in noise, vibration, and harshness levels. In terms of equipment, a driver&#x27;s airbag became standard on both the Statesman and Caprice.

For the VR series, Holden no longer used separate model designations for its Statesman and Caprice. Instead, they adopted the same two-letter title as the Commodore. This same principle applied for the VS models, but not for those succeeding it.
=== VS ===


The VS, launched in April 1995, saw the introduction of the updated &quot;Ecotec&quot; (Emissions and Consumption Optimisation through TEChnology) version of the Buick V6 engine which coincided with the changes to the engine in the United States. The &quot;Ecotec&quot; engine packed 13 percent more power, an increase of over the VR. Holden mated the new engine with a modified version of the &quot;GM 4L60-E&quot; automatic transmission, bringing improved throttle response and smoother changes between gears. Series II and III revisions came in September 1996 and June 1998, mainly consisting of a more rounded rear treatment and new alloy wheel designs. The Series II also heralded the introduction of the &quot;L67&quot; Supercharged V6. This engine slotted in between the existing V6 and V8 engines and was officially rated at , just below the V8, though a HSV option for the 5.0-litre V8 was available. A special edition Statesman International was briefly offered in October 1995 and again as a Series II in February 1997.

For the Statesman, Holden included the ten-stack CD changer from the VR Caprice as standard. A new two-stage door remote was also made standard across the range. The remote, located on the key fob allows for just the driver&#x27;s door to be unlocked. Safety-wise, a passenger airbag was introduced as standard in the VS range, following the introduction of a driver&#x27;s airbag on the VR series. The Used Car Safety Ratings, undertaken by the Monash University Accident Research Centre, found that first generation Statesmans (VQ–VS) provide an &quot;average level&quot; of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident.

HSV released the HSV Grange model in October 1996 (as part of VS II) as a sports variant of the Caprice. Manufactured at Elizabeth, South Australia, and finished by HSV at Clayton, Victoria, the Grange was available in 185i and 215i variants, powered by 5.0- and stroked 5.7-litre V8 engines, respectively. The VS Grange was the first Grange produced by HSV, having previously produced Statesman and Caprice models under its own brand. Standard features for the VS II Grange included 17-inch alloy wheels, a ten-speaker sound system with a ten-disc CD stacker, climate control air conditioning, a power adjustable driver&#x27;s seat (with memory settings), leather upholstery, cruise control, front fog lights, a leather-wrapped steering wheel, remote central locking, power windows and mirrors, telescopic steering wheel adjustment, a trip computer, power sunroof, woodgrain interior trim, an alarm and immobiliser. The 215i variants were also fitted with a Hydratrak limited slip differential.
== Second generation (1999–2006) ==

=== WH ===
The next model came in June 1999, two years after the launch of the all-new VT Commodore from which the new WH was initially based. The WH series saw Holden return to a standalone model designation, rather than adopting the same used by the short-wheelbase Commodore. Models followed much the same pattern as the previous car: a standard Statesman, a special edition Statesman International, and the Caprice as flagship. The doors and front windscreen were again shared with the mainstream Commodore while wheelbase was increased to . WH Series I cars built between 1999 and 2000 had more in common with VT II Commodore, while 2000 onwards bore more resemblance to the updated VX Commodore in parts and finish.

Engines were as per the Commodore, so a 3.8-litre V6 &quot;Ecotec&quot; unit, a supercharged version of the same, and a new 5.7-litre &quot;Generation III&quot; V8, rated at . A Series II revision in August 2001 brought a power increase for the &quot;Ecotec&quot; V6 bringing it up to . Since the WH, which was engineered for both right- and left-hand drive, the Statesman has been exported to the Middle East as the Chevrolet Caprice, following the same model changes as the Holden.

Compared to the previous model, stability improved through the use of wider tracks a longer wheelbase and four-channel ABS disc brakes with traction control. Usable boot space increased to 541 litres. Cornering lights were provided integrated into the front fog light assembly- these cornering lights were illuminated whenever the indicator was operating on that side of the car, illuminating a turning path for the driver. Electrochromatic rear view mirror sensed headlight glare from vehicles travelling behind, and automatically adjusts mirror glass tint level to reduce driver glare.

Dual zone climate control was a standard feature across the WH range, as was 12-mode trip computer integrated into the instrument cluster. Caprice including rear roof mounted climate control and stereo controls for rear passengers- rear passengers were also provided with two headphone jacks in the rear parcel shelf and could listen to a different audio source to the front occupants. A rear flip down table was incorporated into the rear armrest, complete with storage pocket and cup holders. The exclusive-to-Caprice options included standard Howe leather seats, 260-watt 12-speaker DSP audio system, individual ignition key memory (not available in Statesman- stereo settings, seating position) for three drivers, upright Holden crest logo on the bonnet, chrome exterior door handles, as well as heated side view mirrors and auto dipping passenger side view mirror to avoid alloy wheel damage when reversing. Headlights could be set to automatically sense low light levels and turn on without driver input. Caprice featured a fine chrome vertical bar grille, while Statesman used a chrome matrix style front grille design, and lacked chrome exterior door handles.

HSV branded special order options included electric tilt and slide glass sunroof, VDO MS5000 satellite navigation system in place of front console ashtray, HSV alloy pedals, limited slip differential, rear deck spoiler and choice of two 17-inch alloy wheel styles. Vehicles specially ordered with any HSV optional extras received a Holden-by-Design individually numbered build plate in the engine bay.

The use of self-levelling rear air suspension available in Caprice brought advantages when hauling heavy loads and improved vehicle dynamics when towing. Safety in the WH model was also enhanced, with the addition of side impact head &amp; torso airbags and pyrotechnic seat belt pretensioners along with drivers steering wheel and passenger dashboard airbags all as standard. If the seat belt pretensioners trigger, the doors automatically unlock, both engine and fuel pump shut down and all interior lights will switch on. Also new to the WH are the electric wing mirrors, which when reversing, the passenger mirror faces downwards to assist the driver when parking, thus preventing kerbside wheel damage.

Released in June 1999, the HSV Grange (WH) received modifications to the Statesman&#x27;s specification (Statesman VINs begin with &quot;6H8WHY&quot;, whereas the VIN of a Caprice is &quot;6H8WHZ&quot;; the Grange shares the &quot;Y&quot; digit in its VIN with Statesman). Again, the Grange was finished by HSV in Clayton, Victoria. It was available with the 3.8-litre supercharged V6 and 5.7-litre V8 engines. The WH Grange had HSV&#x27;s &quot;Prestige&quot; suspension tune, specially-developed Monroe Sensatrac shock absorbers, a front anti-roll bar, a rear anti-roll bar and a self-levelling function for the rear suspension (shared with Caprice). Standard features for the WH Grange included 18-inch ten-spoke alloy wheels, a 260-watt sound system with ten speakers and a six-disc CD changer, climate control air conditioning, eight-way power adjustable front seats, leather upholstery, cruise control, front fog lights, leather-wrapped steering wheel with audio controls, remote central locking, power windows and mirrors, a height and reach adjustable steering wheel, driver seat and mirror memory settings, an electrochromatic rear view mirror, trip computer and an immobiliser. The Grange was also fitted with a limited slip rear differential as well as a choice of two higher performance brake packages, increased diameter front and rear swaybars and an exclusive-to-Grange HSV body kit consisting of front bumper with enlarged cooling intake, unique stainless steel meshed intake grille with HSV logo in the centre, flared deep side skirts, deep skirted three-piece rear bumper, rear decklid spoiler and rear HSV badging.

=== WK ===


A revised WK series was launched in May 2003, with a facelift. The curvaceous front and rear end styling of the WH was abandoned in favour of angular lines, starting with the headlights borrowed from the VY Calais. From the rear, the redesigned taillights were now separated by sheet metal, rather than being joined with a horizontal strip of plastic. The redesign had the after effect of lowering the WK&#x27;s drag coefficient to 0.30. Other changes came in the form of revised bumpers, wheel trims, with the interior dashboard and centre console receiving a major overhaul. Powertrains carried over from the previous model, but the &quot;Generation III&quot; V8 engine was now rated at for the Statesman and for the Caprice. Other engineering changes were made to the structural integrity of the car. The reinforced front flooring and sills gives the upshot of a 70 percent reduction in lower limb injuries in offset frontal crash tests at .

Feature wise, the Statesman now offered standard rear parking sensors and optional satellite navigation, with the Caprice receiving a dual screen DVD entertainment system for the rear passengers. The Used Car Safety Ratings found that WH/WK Statesmans provide a &quot;significantly better than average&quot; level of occupant protection in the event of an accident.

Standard features for the HSV Grange (WK) included 18-inch alloy wheels, a twelve speaker Blaupunkt sound system with a 430-watt amplifier, subwoofer and a six-stack CD player, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, leather seats and trim, eight-way power adjustable front seats, cruise control with speed alert, driver&#x27;s seat and mirror memory settings, DVD player with twin seven-inch rear seat LCD screens and remote control, rear parking sensors, a leather-wrapped multi-function steering wheel, remote central locking, power windows and mirrors, a height and reach adjustable steering wheel, an electrochromatic rear view mirror, trip computer, cargo net and an immobiliser. As standard, the Grange was also fitted with a limited slip rear differential, larger front &amp; rear sway bars, larger performance brakes and an HSV exclusive-to-Grange body kit consisting of front bumper, side skirts, rear bumper and deck lid spoiler.
=== WL ===


Released in August 2004, the WL brought with it an all-new 3.6-litre &quot;Alloytec&quot; V6 engine, succeeding the WK&#x27;s &quot;Ecotec&quot; unit. Power and torque figures were rated at and , respectively. The Statesman&#x27;s optional V8 was the version from the WK Caprice, with the WL Caprice&#x27;s engine obtaining a further . The V8s received a stronger &quot;GM 4L65-E&quot; automatic transmission, while the &quot;Alloytec&quot; V6 versions received a new five-speed &quot;GM 5L40-E&quot; automatic. Several new safety features were added to the WL line-up. Such include brake assist, electronic brakeforce distribution, Electronic Stability Program and LED tail lamps. The new LED lamps give an additional of warning to trailing motorists travelling at because they illuminate in 60 nanoseconds, compared to 1,000 for conventional incandescent light bulbs.

In 2005, General Motors began exporting the Statesman to China, where it was badged as the Buick Royaum and sold through the GM-SAIC Network. The Royaum was initially equipped with the 3.6-litre &quot;Alloytec&quot; engine fitted to the Statesman, however the 2.8-litre &quot;LP1&quot; engine followed later in the year. Both engines were paired to a 5 speed automatic gearbox. Trims levels were known as 2.8 GL Deluxe, 2.8 GL Comfort and 3.6 GS Deluxe. The 3.6 trim level was changed to 3.6 Luxury Sports for 2005 and was priced at (). The Royaum was not a sales success, tallying 2,008 sales in 2005 and 3,631 sales in 2006. Production ended in the same year as it was replaced by the new GM Omega platform WM/WN Caprice Statesman-based Buick Park Avenue assembled in Shanghai by GM Shanghai.

An additional export programme to South Korea was announced on 12 April 2005 under the Daewoo Statesman name. During 2005, Holden exported almost 2,000 units of the Daewoo to South Korea. With an identical powertrain to the Buick, the South Korean export model was sold through the GM Daewoo network.

Standard features for the WL series HSV Grange included 19-inch alloy wheels, a 430-watt Blaupunkt sound system with twelve speakers and a six-stack CD player, dual-zone climate control air conditioning, Nappa leather seats, eight-way power adjustable front seats, driver&#x27;s seat and mirror memory settings, cruise control with speed alert, front fog lamps, a front and rear parking sensors, DVD player with twin seven-inch rear seat LCD screens and remote control, leather-wrapped multi-function steering wheel, remote central locking, power windows and heated mirrors, automatically dipping mirrors when reversing, a height and reach adjustable steering wheel, an electrochromatic rear vision mirror, tyre pressure sensors, a trip computer and an immobiliser. As standard, the Grange was also fitted with a limited slip rear differential as well as larger diameter front and rear sway bars, performance brakes and an exclusive body kit consisting of more aggressive front bumper, side skirts, rear bumper and deck lid spoiler.

== Third generation (2006–2017) ==
=== WM ===
The third generation WM was launched alongside the VE Commodore on 16 July 2006 at the Melbourne Convention &amp; Exhibition Centre. With the Statesman&#x27;s export plans, it was decided that its launch should be simultaneous with that of the Commodore, rather than months later, as had been the convention. The WM development programme reportedly cost General Motors A$190 million with another $1.04 billion devoted to the VE Commodore model which the Statesman is based upon. The WM series utilises the GM Zeta platform developed by Holden. Unlike previous models, the WM no longer shares its architecture with an Opel sedan, and has rear doors different from those found on the Commodore. Previously, it had to share the doors, or at least the lower parts, with the lesser Commodore. This is just one of the ways Holden has tried to create greater differentiation between the Statesman and the Commodore on which it is based.

Like the second generation model, the WM is exported to the Middle East as the Chevrolet Caprice. In China, the sister model had been produced as the Buick Park Avenue from 2007, mainly using locally sourced parts and sharing some globally sourced parts. The Park Avenue was discontinued in 2012.

In 2008, Holden recommenced Caprice exports to South Korea as the Daewoo Veritas after showcasing a pre-production Daewoo L4X in 2007. Compared to the Australian-specification model, the Veritas is V6-powered only and has a modified rear floorpan to accommodate the electrically adjustable rear seats incorporating a massage function. The head restraints are also electrically adjustable, with the Caprice&#x27;s dual headrest-mounted LCD screens orphaned in favour of a single, ceiling-mounted unit. GM Daewoo announced an updated Veritas on 31 March 2009 to take effect from 1 April. The update, which was yet to be seen in other markets, comprised a revised powertrain combination, featuring a new direct injection version of the 3.6-litre &quot;Alloytec&quot; engine. This new engine results in a power increase from to together with more torque and a reduced fuel consumption figure. These efficiency improvements have been enough to satisfy the government of South Korea&#x27;s &quot;Korea Ultra-Low Emission Vehicle&quot; (KULEV) requirements. In place of the five-speed automatic transmission previously, these revised models ship with a six-speed &quot;GM 6L50&quot; unit, featuring &quot;Active Select&quot;.

The update to the Veritas in South Korea was adopted in the Holden versions for the 2010 model year (MY10). This update was announced on 4 August 2009, and released in September. The now direct-injected 3.6-litre V6, labelled Spark Ignition Direct Injection (SIDI) by Holden, is rated at and of torque. Gains in efficiency have been achieved via the implementation of direct fuel injection, improvements to the fuel cutout during coasting, the addition of a more efficient alternator and voltage regulator, a 50 rpm lower idle speed (to 550 rpm), and a new &quot;turbine damper&quot; for the automatic transmission that works to suppress vibrations at low rpm, thus enabling earlier upshifts. In 2010 the Veritas was discontinued after GM phased out the Daewoo brand in South Korea in favour of Chevrolet.

In 2010, Holden made the decision to discontinue the Statesman nameplate. To replace this gap in their lineup, Holden reduced the price of the V6 Caprice and removed equipment so it roughly mirrored the equipment levels found in the Statesman. This coincided with the release of the &quot;Series II&quot; versions of the Caprice (non V) which was only available in V6 form and was intended to replace the Statesman in price and equipment, and the introduction of the &quot;Series II&quot; Caprice V which was only available in V8 guise and roughly followed the feature set found in the &quot;Series I&quot; Caprice.

Between 2011 and 2017, a rebadged version of the Holden Caprice was sold in North America as a police cruiser, called the Chevrolet Caprice PPV (Police Patrol Vehicle). It uses the interior and dashboard of the lower-end Commodore Omega, and is marketed as an alternative to the Chevrolet Impala (produced in Oshawa, Ontario, Canada) for heavy-duty fleet use.

=== WN ===

In 2013, Holden released the WN series, being the final Australian-made Caprice. It consisted of new alloy wheels and upgraded dashboard and electronics, both inherited from short-wheelbase Calais V (VF). It was also the most advanced, safest Caprice model produced, fitted with an eight-inch touch screen in the centre console, keyless entry and auto-park assist standard. Other features include a heads-up display on the windscreen, forward and rear collision warning systems, blind spot monitors and a lane departure warning system.

There are two engine options, the V6 LPG engine or the 6.0-litre &quot;L77&quot; V8 engine rated at coupled with the six-speed &quot;6L80E&quot; automatic transmission. Both drivetrains are inherited from their Commodore equivalents. Since the WN Series II in 2015, the Caprice received an upgrade to the 6.2-litre &quot;LS3&quot; V8 engine producing , like the donor Commodore model. No BiModal exhaust option with LS3 engine.

== HSV Grange ==

From the arrival of the VS series, Holden Special Vehicles (HSV) modified the Statesman, equipping it with higher performance V8s and sold as the HSV Grange, replacing the previous HSV Statesman 5000i, SV90 and SV93 from the VQ series. Starting from WM and WN series, the Grange has been based on the Caprice, due to the demise of the Statesman. The last series (WN) of HSV Grange was equipped with the version of the 6.2-litre &quot;LS3&quot; V8 engine.

<text>Kiewit Corporation is an American construction company based in Omaha, Nebraska founded in 1884. In 2021, it was ranked 243rd on the Fortune 500. Privately held, it is one of the largest construction and engineering organizations in North America. It is an employee-owned company.

==History==
The company was founded in 1884 as Kiewit Brothers Masonry Contractors by Peter and Andrew Kiewit, who were of Dutch descent. Their father, John Kiewit, emigrated from The Hague in 1857, where he learned the trade of brickmaking. John Kiewit established a brickyard in Omaha, Nebraska where his sons worked and learned the skills for their masonry business. Early projects included the seven-story Lincoln Hotel in Lincoln as stonemasons and the Bekins warehouse as general contractor. It is an employee-owned company.

The original brothers dissolved their partnership in 1904 and the founding Peter Kiewit continued as a sole proprietorship. In 1912, two of his sons, Ralph and George Kiewit, joined their father as partners in the firm. One of their constructions was the Omaha Fire Department Hose Company No. 4 building, erected in 1913. When the founding Peter Kiewit died in 1914, his son Ralph led the company. George and Ralph Kiewit left the company.

The founder&#x27;s youngest son, Peter Kiewit Jr., joined the firm in 1919. He led the firm from 1924 until his death in 1979. Peter Jr. turned the firm into one of the largest construction companies in the world. He was also very active in the Omaha area, including leadership of the Knights of Ak-Sar-Ben.

In 1931, Peter Kiewit incorporated the company as Peter Kiewit Sons’ Co. The firm began building transportation projects during the Great Depression.

Walter Scott was also a key figure in the growth of Kiewit. Scott was initially hired to work on the tower project at the Nebraska State Capitol and spent the remainder of his career at Kiewit becoming chief engineer.

==Notable projects==
*Throughout the 1920s the company built several historic buildings around Nebraska including the Livestock Exchange Building (1926), the old Lincoln station (1926), the Nebraska State Capitol Tower (1927), Joslyn Art Museum (1928), and Union Station (Omaha)(1929). 

*Between 1951 and 1966, Kiewit built Thule Air Base for the U.S. military in Thule, Greenland. Located on the northwest coast of Greenland, the base features a 10,000 foot runway. 
*In 1969, Kiewit began constructing the 63rd Street Tunnel between Manhattan and Queens in New York City. The initial project was part of a $2 billion program to expand the New York City Subway and Long Island Rail Road. 

*Between 1980 and 1985, the company built the mile-long $750 million Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore Harbor. 
*In the 1990s, Kiewit was part of a joint venture to build the $517 million T-Mobile Park in Seattle, home of the Seattle Mariners baseball team. The project was completed in 1999.
*Kiewit Infrastructure South is part of the team constructing the 11.5 mile, six-station Phase II of the Washington Metro&#x27;s Silver Line in Virginia.

==Leadership==
Rick Lanoha is the current chief executive officer of Kiewit Corporation. His predecessors include Peter Kiewit, Bob Wilson, Walter Scott Jr., Ken Stinson, and Bruce E. Grewcock. Prior to Grewcock&#x27;s retirement, on January 1, 2020, Lanoha had served as president and chief operating officer since 2016 and was elected to Kiewit&#x27;s board of directors in 2009.

Walter Scott, Jr. was first elected to the Peter Kiewit Sons&#x27; Incorporated board in 1964. 
In 1979, he was elected president. When Peter Kiewit died later that same year, Scott was selected to succeed him as chairman.

==Expansions==
In 1963, Peter Kiewit bought the &quot;Omaha World-Herald&quot; to keep it locally owned. Under the terms of his will, the employees bought the paper in 1979.

Starting in 1985 (Kiewit built MFS in the early 1990s; Level 3 was built in the 1997 to 1999 circa), Kiewit also constructed a nationwide fiber optic network. This network was later spun off as Level 3 Communications, which became the formal successor corporation to the original Peter Kiewit Sons&#x27;.

They have a training facility called Kiewit University in its new Omaha, Nebraska campus that trains employees from throughout the US.

<doc id="1100499" wikidata="Q402287" url="?curid=1100499" title="Pedigree collapse">
<text>In genealogy, pedigree collapse describes how reproduction between two individuals who share an ancestor causes the number of distinct ancestors in the family tree of their offspring to be smaller than it could otherwise be. Robert C. Gunderson coined the term; synonyms include implex and the German Ahnenschwund (&quot;loss of ancestors&quot;).

== Overview ==
Without pedigree collapse, a person&#x27;s ancestor tree is a binary tree, formed by the person, the parents (2), the grandparents (4), great-grandparents (8), and so on. However, the number of individuals in such a tree grows exponentially and will eventually become impossibly high. For example, a single individual alive today would, over 30 generations going back to the High Middle Ages, have 230 or roughly 1 billion ancestors, more than the total world population at the time.

This paradox is explained by shared ancestors. Instead of consisting of all different individuals, a tree may have multiple places occupied by a single individual. This typically happens when the parents of an ancestor are related to each other (sometimes unbeknownst to themselves). For example, the offspring of two first cousins has at most only six great-grandparents instead of the usual eight. This reduction in the number of ancestors is referred to as pedigree collapse. It collapses the ancestor tree into a directed acyclic graph.

In some cultures, cousins and other relations were permitted, encouraged, or required to marry. This may have been to keep kin bonds, wealth and property within a family (endogamy) or simply because there was a limited number of potential marriage partners available. Among royalty, the frequent requirement to marry only other royals resulted in a reduced gene pool in which most individuals were the result of extensive pedigree collapse. Alfonso XII of Spain, for example, had only four great-grandparents instead of the usual eight. Furthermore, two of these great-grandparents, Charles IV of Spain and Maria Luisa of Parma, who themselves were first cousins, were parents of another great-grandparent, Maria Isabella of Spain. Essentially, Alfonso&#x27;s parents were double first cousins, i.e. his two grandfathers were brothers and his two grandmothers were sisters, meaning there were only two sets of great-grandparents rather than four. In addition, each grandfather had married one of their sister&#x27;s daughters, i.e. they had each married their sororal niece.

More generally, in many cultures intermarriage may frequently occur within a small village, limiting the available gene pool.


















==Ancestry==

The House of Habsburg gives a well-documented example of pedigree collapse. In the case of Charles II, the last Habsburg King of Spain, there were three uncle-niece marriages among the seven unions of his immediate ancestry (i.e. parents, grandparents and great-grandparents). His father and two of his great-grandfathers married their nieces. His paternal grandparents were first cousins once removed, but they comprised two of the seven marriages because they were also parents to his maternal grandmother. His maternal grandparents&#x27; marriage and the final marriage of great-grandparents was between first cousins.
The maximum pedigree collapse of 50% within a single generation is caused by procreation between full siblings; such children have only two different grandparents instead of the usual four. If two half-siblings procreate, their children have three grandparents instead of four (25%).

If a child and parent were to procreate, their offspring would have four grandparents; so, procreation between parents and children would result in less pedigree collapse than procreation between full siblings – although one of the grandparents would also be a parent and therefore introduce no additional genes.

If a person procreates with a full sibling of one of their parents (as with the uncle-niece marriages mentioned above), the offspring have four different persons as grandparents, and eight great-grandparents, but again some of these contribute no additional genes (see Inbreeding).

Small, isolated populations such as those of remote islands represent extreme examples of pedigree collapse, but the common historical tendency to marry those within walking distance, due to the relative immobility of the population before modern transport, meant that most marriage partners were at least distantly related. Even in America around the 19th century, the tendency of immigrants to marry among their ethnic, language or cultural group produced many cousin marriages.

If one considers as a function of time the number of a given individual&#x27;s ancestors who were alive at time , it is likely that for most individuals this function has a maximum at around 1200 AD. It was suggested in 1985 that everyone on Earth is at most 50th cousin to everyone else, based on a relatively random mating model. Simulations published in 2004 which take into account the geographical separations and less random patterns of mating in real life suggest that some populations are separated by up to a few thousand years, with a most recent common ancestor perhaps 76 generations back, though some highly remote populations may have been isolated for somewhat longer.

<doc id="1100501" wikidata="Q212311" url="?curid=1100501" title="Pro Wrestling Zero1">
<text>, often referred to simply as Zero1 and sometimes referred to as Pro Wrestling Zero1 Catch as Catch Can (stylized as ZERO1 and PRO WRESTLING ZERO1 CATCH AS CATCH CAN, respectively), is a Japanese professional wrestling promotion founded in 2001.

Formerly known as Pro Wrestling Zero-One and Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max (stylized as Pro Wrestling ZERO-ONE and Pro Wrestling Zero1-MAX, respectively), it was affiliated with the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) from 2001 until late 2004, and briefly reaffiliated in 2011. It was also affiliated with AWA Superstars of Wrestling (AWA) from 2005 until late 2007, the Global Professional Wrestling Alliance (GPWA) from 2006 to 2009, and was affiliated with the United Wrestling Network (UWN) from 2017 to 2022.

==History==
===As Pro Wrestling Zero-One===

The promotion was founded by former New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) star Shinya Hashimoto who was quickly joined by Shinjiro Otani. In 2000, Hashimoto proposed an independent promotion within NJPW called &quot;New Japan Pro-Wrestling Zero&quot;, but the idea was shot down. When Hashimoto was fired by NJPW in November 2000, he registered the Pro Wrestling Zero-One name.

In its early years, Zero1 had working agreements with Pro Wrestling Noah (Noah), All Japan Pro Wrestling (AJPW), NJPW, Riki Pro, Hustle, Big Mouth Loud, King&#x27;s Road, and Dragondoor. These agreements enabled Zero1 wrestlers to challenge for and hold the other promotions&#x27; titles. The promotion also operated their own dojo, which was referred to as the &quot;Takeshiba Coliseum&quot;. 

On November 30, 2004, Shinya Hashimoto gave up ownership of the promotion, telling the press that due to financial problems he had decided to step away from the company. A new parent company &quot;First On Stage&quot; was formed consisting of president Yoshiyuki Nakamura, ring announcer Oki Okidata, Shinjiro Otani and a company named Baltic Curry. First On Stage renamed the promotion to Pro Wrestling Zero1-Max, with Otani and Nakamura taking over the promotion&#x27;s general operations. Among other major changes made to the promotion&#x27;s structure was the decision to join AWA Superstars of Wrestling (AWA) as the alliance&#x27;s only Japanese member. Due to their new affiliation with the AWA, the promotion&#x27;s previous National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) affiliation was given to rival promotion NJPW. 

Since April 2005, Zero1 has held yearly pay-per-view events at the Yasukuni Shrine, which is controversial for its relation to World War II. Larger Japanese wrestling promotions like NJPW, AJPW, and Noah have traditionally stayed away from such venues due to their controversial nature.

On September 12, 2006, Zero1-Max joined 12 other wrestling companies to form the Global Professional Wrestling Alliance (GPWA), a professional wrestling alliance that intended to &quot;foster an environment of cooperation rather than competition.&quot; The alliance planned to hold occasional &quot;Super Shows&quot; where all member promotions would send wrestlers to compete under the GPWA banner. Noah&#x27;s CEO Mitsuharu Misawa was inaugurated as the first chairman of the GPWA, while Zero1-Max&#x27;s Yoshiyuki Nakamura was announced as the alliance&#x27;s president. The GPWA would later fold in 2009.

===As Pro Wrestling Zero1===
In 2008, the promotion shortened its name to Pro Wrestling Zero1. In 2011, the promotion returned to the NWA as their Japanese territory. In March 2011, NWA presented Zero1 with the NWA Pan-Pacific Premium Heavyweight Championship in celebration of the promotion&#x27;s tenth anniversary. In July, Daisuke Sekimoto won the Fire Festival to become the first NWA Pan-Pacific Premium Heavyweight champion. Later in 2011, Zero1 left the NWA, renaming their NWA-branded championships to &quot;New Wrestling Alliance&quot; championships.

Following their 2011 departure from the NWA, Zero1 launched an American affiliate, Zero1 USA, taking over the promotion previously known as NWA Midwest. In 2012, an Australian division of Zero1, known as Zero1 Australia, opened in Adelaide taking over what was previously known as NWA Pro Australia; in 2014 the relationship between Zero1 and Zero1 Australia ended with the Australian-based promotion renaming to Wrestle Rampage. Later in 2012, the Zero1 Hong Kong and Zero1 Mexico branches opened. In 2013, Yoshiyuki Nakamura opened a new division of Zero1 in Belarus.

On December 17, 2013, Zero1 announced a corporate restructuring taking place at the start of the 2014.

During a September 16, 2016 press conference, Dream On Stage was announced as Zero1&#x27;s new parent company. Also announced was a partnership between Zero1 and Akebono&#x27;s Ōdō company. On May 22, 2017, Zero1 partnered with the United Wrestling Network to become the group&#x27;s official Japanese affiliate. On July 3, 2018, it was announced that the promotion be undergoing a management change, with Yoshitaka Ono stepping down as the CEO. Katsumi Sasazaki would be appointed the representative director and president of the promotion, while Shinjiro Otani took on the chairman of the board position and Masato Tanaka and Kohei Sato split the vice-president role of the promotion.

On February 1, 2020, Zero1 president Kazuhiro Iwamoto announced that the ownership of the promotion would be transferred from the previous management company Dream On Stage to iFD. Iwamoto additionally announced a plan to reform the promotion, which would include holding a show in the Ryōgoku Kokugikan on April 13, 2021, as part of the promotion&#x27;s 20th anniversary. A further goal would be holding a show in the Roygoku Kokugikan annually, while also providing Zero1 wrestlers with fixed contracts and social security. 

During a hiatus caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the promotion suffered from severe financial problems. Kazuhiro Iwamoto resigned from his position as president while wrestlers Tatsuhito Takaiwa, Ikuto Hidaka, and Kohei Sato all departed the promotion. In July 2020, it was announced that the company was acquired by Daiko Holdings Group. That same month, they hired former Frontier Martial-Arts Wrestling women&#x27;s wrestler Megumi Kudo as their general manager.

On December 27, 2024, during a press conference, it was announced that the promotion was acquired by Studio Backdrop. It was additionally announced that Zero1 affiliate Tochigi Pro-Wrestling would begin operating independently of Zero1 and Masato Tanaka would launch Zero1 Hardcore, a Zero1 affiliate based on hardcore wrestling.

<text>Autocar (stylized in all caps) is a weekly British automobile magazine published by Haymarket Media Group. It was first published in 1895 and refers to itself as &quot;the world&#x27;s oldest car magazine&quot;. Mark Tisshaw is editor and other team members include Steve Cropley, Rachel Burgess, James Attwood, Matt Prior, Matt Saunders and Felix Page. 

&quot;Autocar&quot; has several international editions, including China, India, New Zealand, and South Africa.

==History==

The publication was launched as &quot;The Autocar&quot; by Iliffe and Son Ltd. &quot;in the interests of the mechanically propelled road carriage&quot; on 2 November 1895 when, it is believed, there were only six or seven cars in the United Kingdom. L. J. K. Setright suggests that the magazine was set up by Henry Sturmey as an organ of propaganda for Harry J. Lawson, founder of the Daimler Company and a journalist on the magazine in its early days. Henry Sturmey stood down as editor of &quot;The Autocar&quot; magazine and left the company in 1901.

&quot;Autocar&quot; claims to have invented the road test in 1928 when it analysed the Austin 7 Gordon England Sunshine Saloon. &quot;Autocar&quot; has been published weekly throughout its life with only strikes in the 1970s interrupting its frequency.

The magazine&#x27;s name was changed from &quot;The Autocar&quot; to &quot;Autocar&quot; at the start of 1962.

In 1988 &quot;Autocar&quot; absorbed the rival magazine &quot;Motor&quot;, with which it had done battle on the newsstands since 1903. From the 7 September 1988 issue the magazine became &quot;Autocar &amp; Motor&quot;. It reverted to &quot;Autocar&quot; for the 21 September 1994 issue.

The magazine has scored many firsts in its history, including the first full road tests and independent performance tests of the Jaguar XJ220, McLaren F1, and the Porsche 911 GT1. 

It was also the first magazine to produce independently recorded performance figures for the Bugatti Veyron, which were published in the 31 May 2006 issue.

In 2023, &quot;Autocar&quot; digitised its entire archive dating back to 1895. The Autocar Archive is available to subscribers online.

==Regular features==
* News – includes &quot;scoop&quot; photographs and information about still-secret future models
* First drives – brief road tests of new models
* Group tests – analysis of how a model compares relative to rivals
* Motorsport – summaries of current racing news, predominantly in Formula 1 and rallying
* Road tests – Thorough test and analysis of one new model per issue. In the issue closest to Christmas, &quot;Autocar&quot; traditionally publishes a &quot;road test&quot; of a more unusual vehicle. These have included tests of New Routemaster, HMS Ark Royal, Concorde, and HMS Diamond.
* Used car news
* Long term car tests
* New car data

==Writers and illustrators==
In the 1950s, the magazine&#x27;s sport editor, John Cooper, used Cooper T11 parts to create the Cooper-Alta. Former &quot;Autocar&quot; writers include Russell Bulgin, Chris Harris, and former &quot;Top Gear&quot; presenter James May. 

In 1992, May was fired from &quot;Autocar&quot; after he added an acrostic into the 1992 &quot;Road Test Yearbook&quot;. May had to write every review in the issue. Each spread featured four reviews and each review started with a big red capital letter known as a rubricated initial. May was bored and to alleviate the boredom, he wrote the reviews so the first four spreads would spell the words &quot;ROAD&quot;, &quot;TEST&quot;, &quot;YEAR&quot; and &quot;BOOK&quot;. The other pages had another acrostic but that was not immediately recognizable as it was spread over the rest of the magazine, spelling seemingly random letters starting with &quot;SOYO&quot; and &quot;UTHI&quot;. After it was published, readers discovered it. This was the one that got James May fired because it used profanity. The message, when punctuated was: &quot;So you think it&#x27;s really good, yeah? You should try making the bloody thing up; it&#x27;s a real pain in the arse.&quot;

Current &quot;Autocar&quot; writers include Richard Bremner, used car expert James Ruppert, Editor at Large Matt Prior and Editor in Chief Steve Cropley. 

The current editor is Mark Tisshaw, a former deputy editor, news editor and reporter for the magazine.

<text>Tullamore is a small town in the North-Western corner of the Parkes Shire in the Central West of New South Wales, Australia. At the , Tullamore had a population of 369.

It lies in an expanding broadacre cropping country. Tullamore has a railway station on the Bogan Gate–Tottenham Branch line. It is served by a newly constructed medical centre and a K-12 central school.

Tullamore is the first town mentioned in the original (Australian) version of the song &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Everywhere&quot;.

Jimmy Barnes performed at Pola Park in Tullamore, New South Wales on Saturday, November 2, 2019. The concert was part of his &quot;Shutting Down Your Town&quot; tour to promote his album My Criminal Record.

==History==
The area known as Tullamore was first settled as &quot;Bullock Creek&quot; in 1870. The post office opened under that name on 1 April 1890.It was then renamed Gobondery.

In 1895 Jim Tully, whose family came from Tullamore in Ireland, built a hotel and called it &quot;Tullie&#x27;s Exchange Hotel&quot;. The Kerley family, also from the Tullamore area in Ireland, settled on a nearby property and called it Tullamore Station. It is believed that the town obtained its name from this property. The post office was officially renamed &quot;Tullamore&quot; in 1895.

The original Exchange Hotel was destroyed by fire on December 28, 1919, only a few weeks after its publican James Tully had died.

European exploration of the area began in the early 1800s, with the first recorded European visit by Major Thomas Mitchell in 1835 during his exploration of the Lachlan River. Settlers began to establish pastoral stations in the 1840s, and the region&#x27;s economy grew through sheep grazing and agriculture.

In the early 20th century, Tullamore&#x27;s population grew steadily as the region&#x27;s agricultural sector flourished, particularly through wheat farming and sheep grazing. During World War II, Tullamore played a significant role in the war effort, with local farmers supplying the Australian military with essential food supplies.

== Economy ==
Agriculture remains the dominant industry in Tullamore, with wheat, barley, and canola crops grown in the region, alongside sheep grazing for wool and meat production. The township&#x27;s economic base has also expanded to include some local retail businesses, including a post office, café, and a general store.

Tullamore was home to the Tullamore Grain Cooperative, a major player in the region&#x27;s grain production and distribution particularly during the first and second world wars. The cooperative was a key driver in the establishment of the Bogan Gate to Tottenham railway, and the various grain silos along its route for grain storage to support wartime effort.
Whilst the Tullamore grain silo is currently not in service, it is understood that its owner Graincorp is currently reviewing plans to re-establish the facility with a larger rebuilt silo at the site, in conjunction with a proposed rail line extension through to Narromine to connect to the Brisbane Melbourne freight corridor.

== Culture and landmarks ==
A notable landmark in Tullamore is the Tullamore War Memorial located in the center of the township. This memorial honors local soldiers who served in both World Wars, and it is a focal point for the town&#x27;s Remembrance Day services.

The Tullamore Hotel is another local icon, dating back to the early 20th century. Known for its rustic charm and warm hospitality, it remains a popular spot for both locals and passing travelers. The hotel also serves as the social hub of the community, where events, meetings, and celebrations are held throughout the year.

==Climate==
Being near the geographical centre of New South Wales, the seasonal range is quite marked, with long, hot summers and cool winters, and rather scanty rainfall through the year – mainly resulting from severe thunderstorms and Northwest cloudbands. There are two known occurrences of snowfall in the district, on 5 July 1900 and some time in 1874 (both having occurred on the Melrose Plains to the south-west).

==Tullamore Show Grounds==
The Tullamore Show Grounds on Cornet Street hosts the annual Tullamore Show each August.

<doc id="1100516" wikidata="Q1782962" url="?curid=1100516" title="Model predictive control">
<text>Model predictive control (MPC) is an advanced method of process control that is used to control a process while satisfying a set of constraints. It has been in use in the process industries in chemical plants and oil refineries since the 1980s. In recent years it has also been used in power system balancing models and in power electronics. Model predictive controllers rely on dynamic models of the process, most often linear empirical models obtained by system identification. The main advantage of MPC is the fact that it allows the current timeslot to be optimized, while keeping future timeslots in account. This is achieved by optimizing a finite time-horizon, but only implementing the current timeslot and then optimizing again, repeatedly, thus differing from a linear–quadratic regulator (LQR). Also MPC has the ability to anticipate future events and can take control actions accordingly. PID controllers do not have this predictive ability. MPC is nearly universally implemented as a digital control, although there is research into achieving faster response times with specially designed analog circuitry.

Generalized predictive control (GPC) and dynamic matrix control (DMC) are classical examples of MPC.

== Overview ==

The models used in MPC are generally intended to represent the behavior of complex and simple dynamical systems. The additional complexity of the MPC control algorithm is not generally needed to provide adequate control of simple systems, which are often controlled well by generic PID controllers. Common dynamic characteristics that are difficult for PID controllers include large time delays and high-order dynamics.

MPC models predict the change in the dependent variables of the modeled system that will be caused by changes in the independent variables. In a chemical process, independent variables that can be adjusted by the controller are often either the setpoints of regulatory PID controllers (pressure, flow, temperature, etc.) or the final control element (valves, dampers, etc.). Independent variables that cannot be adjusted by the controller are used as disturbances. Dependent variables in these processes are other measurements that represent either control objectives or process constraints.

MPC uses the current plant measurements, the current dynamic state of the process, the MPC models, and the process variable targets and limits to calculate future changes in the dependent variables. These changes are calculated to hold the dependent variables close to target while honoring constraints on both independent and dependent variables. The MPC typically sends out only the first change in each independent variable to be implemented, and repeats the calculation when the next change is required.

While many real processes are not linear, they can often be considered to be approximately linear over a small operating range. Linear MPC approaches are used in the majority of applications with the feedback mechanism of the MPC compensating for prediction errors due to structural mismatch between the model and the process. In model predictive controllers that consist only of linear models, the superposition principle of linear algebra enables the effect of changes in multiple independent variables to be added together to predict the response of the dependent variables. This simplifies the control problem to a series of direct matrix algebra calculations that are fast and robust.

When linear models are not sufficiently accurate to represent the real process nonlinearities, several approaches can be used. In some cases, the process variables can be transformed before and/or after the linear MPC model to reduce the nonlinearity. The process can be controlled with nonlinear MPC that uses a nonlinear model directly in the control application. The nonlinear model may be in the form of an empirical data fit (e.g. artificial neural networks) or a high-fidelity dynamic model based on fundamental mass and energy balances. The nonlinear model may be linearized to derive a Kalman filter or specify a model for linear MPC.

An algorithmic study by El-Gherwi, Budman, and El Kamel shows that utilizing a dual-mode approach can provide significant reduction in online computations while maintaining comparative performance to a non-altered implementation. The proposed algorithm solves N convex optimization problems in parallel based on exchange of information among controllers.

===Theory behind MPC===

 MPC is based on iterative, finite-horizon optimization of a plant model. At time formula_1 the current plant state is sampled and a cost minimizing control strategy is computed (via a numerical minimization algorithm) for a relatively short time horizon in the future: formula_2. Specifically, an online or on-the-fly calculation is used to explore state trajectories that emanate from the current state and find (via the solution of Euler–Lagrange equations) a cost-minimizing control strategy until time formula_3. Only the first step of the control strategy is implemented, then the plant state is sampled again and the calculations are repeated starting from the new current state, yielding a new control and new predicted state path. The prediction horizon keeps being shifted forward and for this reason MPC is also called receding horizon control. Although this approach is not optimal, in practice it has given very good results. Much academic research has been done to find fast methods of solution of Euler–Lagrange type equations, to understand the global stability properties of MPC&#x27;s local optimization, and in general to improve the MPC method.

=== Principles of MPC ===

Model predictive control is a multivariable control algorithm that uses:
* an internal dynamic model of the process
* a cost function &quot;J&quot; over the receding horizon
* an optimization algorithm minimizing the cost function &quot;J&quot; using the control input &quot;u&quot;

An example of a quadratic cost function for optimization is given by:

:formula_4
without violating constraints (low/high limits) with

:formula_5: formula_6th controlled variable (e.g. measured temperature)
:formula_7: formula_6th reference variable (e.g. required temperature)
:formula_9: formula_6th manipulated variable (e.g. control valve)
:formula_11: weighting coefficient reflecting the relative importance of formula_5
:formula_13: weighting coefficient penalizing relative big changes in formula_9
etc.

==Nonlinear MPC==

Nonlinear model predictive control, or NMPC, is a variant of model predictive control that is characterized by the use of nonlinear system models in the prediction. As in linear MPC, NMPC requires the iterative solution of optimal control problems on a finite prediction horizon. While these problems are convex in linear MPC, in nonlinear MPC they are not necessarily convex anymore. This poses challenges for both NMPC stability theory and numerical solution.

The numerical solution of the NMPC optimal control problems is typically based on direct optimal control methods using Newton-type optimization schemes, in one of the variants: direct single shooting, direct multiple shooting methods, or direct collocation. NMPC algorithms typically exploit the fact that consecutive optimal control problems are similar to each other. This allows to initialize the Newton-type solution procedure efficiently by a suitably shifted guess from the previously computed optimal solution, saving considerable amounts of computation time. The similarity of subsequent problems is even further exploited by path following algorithms (or &quot;real-time iterations&quot;) that never attempt to iterate any optimization problem to convergence, but instead only take a few iterations towards the solution of the most current NMPC problem, before proceeding to the next one, which is suitably initialized; see, e.g... Another promising candidate for the nonlinear optimization problem is to use a randomized optimization method. Optimum solutions are found by generating random samples that satisfy the constraints in the solution space and finding the optimum one based on cost function.

While NMPC applications have in the past been mostly used in the process and chemical industries with comparatively slow sampling rates, NMPC is being increasingly applied, with advancements in controller hardware and computational algorithms, e.g., preconditioning, to applications with high sampling rates, e.g., in the automotive industry, or even when the states are distributed in space (Distributed parameter systems). As an application in aerospace, recently, NMPC has been used to track optimal terrain-following/avoidance trajectories in real-time.

== Explicit MPC ==
Explicit MPC (eMPC) allows fast evaluation of the control law for some systems, in stark contrast to the online MPC. Explicit MPC is based on the parametric programming technique, where the solution to the MPC control problem formulated as optimization problem is pre-computed offline. This offline solution, i.e., the control law, is often in the form of a piecewise affine function (PWA), hence the eMPC controller stores the coefficients of the PWA for each a subset (control region) of the state space, where the PWA is constant, as well as coefficients of some parametric representations of all the regions. Every region turns out to geometrically be a convex polytope for linear MPC, commonly parameterized by coefficients for its faces, requiring quantization accuracy analysis. Obtaining the optimal control action is then reduced to first determining the region containing the current state and second a mere evaluation of PWA using the PWA coefficients stored for all regions. If the total number of the regions is small, the implementation of the eMPC does not require significant computational resources (compared to the online MPC) and is uniquely suited to control systems with fast dynamics. A serious drawback of eMPC is exponential growth of the total number of the control regions with respect to some key parameters of the controlled system, e.g., the number of states, thus dramatically increasing controller memory requirements and making the first step of PWA evaluation, i.e. searching for the current control region, computationally expensive.

== Robust MPC ==

Robust variants of model predictive control are able to account for set bounded disturbance while still ensuring state constraints are met. Some of the main approaches to robust MPC are given below.

* &quot;Min-max MPC&quot;. In this formulation, the optimization is performed with respect to all possible evolutions of the disturbance. This is the optimal solution to linear robust control problems, however it carries a high computational cost. The basic idea behind the min/max MPC approach is to modify the on-line &quot;min&quot; optimization to a &quot;min-max&quot; problem, minimizing the worst case of the objective function, maximized over all possible plants from the uncertainty set.
* &quot;Constraint Tightening MPC&quot;. Here the state constraints are enlarged by a given margin so that a trajectory can be guaranteed to be found under any evolution of disturbance.
* &quot;Tube MPC&quot;. This uses an independent nominal model of the system, and uses a feedback controller to ensure the actual state converges to the nominal state. The amount of separation required from the state constraints is determined by the robust positively invariant (RPI) set, which is the set of all possible state deviations that may be introduced by disturbance with the feedback controller.
* &quot;Multi-stage MPC&quot;. This uses a scenario-tree formulation by approximating the uncertainty space with a set of samples and the approach is non-conservative because it takes into account that the measurement information is available at every time stage in the prediction and the decisions at every stage can be different and can act as recourse to counteract the effects of uncertainties. The drawback of the approach however is that the size of the problem grows exponentially with the number of uncertainties and the prediction horizon.
* &quot;Tube-enhanced multi-stage MPC&quot;. This approach synergizes multi-stage MPC and tube-based MPC. It provides high degrees of freedom to choose the desired trade-off between optimality and simplicity by the classification of uncertainties and the choice of control laws in the predictions.

==Commercially available MPC software==

Commercial MPC packages are available and typically contain tools for model identification and analysis, controller design and tuning, as well as controller performance evaluation.

A survey of commercially available packages has been provided by S.J. Qin and T.A. Badgwell in &quot;Control Engineering Practice&quot; 11 (2003) 733–764.

== MPC vs. LQR ==
Model predictive control and linear-quadratic regulators are both expressions of optimal control, with different schemes of setting up optimisation costs.

While a model predictive controller often looks at fixed length, often graduatingly weighted sets of error functions, the linear-quadratic regulator looks at all linear system inputs and provides the transfer function that will reduce the total error across the frequency spectrum, trading off state error against input frequency.

Due to these fundamental differences, LQR has better global stability properties, but MPC often has more locally optimal[?] and complex performance.

The main differences between MPC and LQR are that LQR optimizes across the entire time window (horizon) whereas MPC optimizes in a receding time window, and that with MPC a new solution is computed often whereas LQR uses the same single (optimal) solution for the whole time horizon. Therefore, MPC typically solves the optimization problem in a smaller time window than the whole horizon and hence may obtain a suboptimal solution. However, because MPC makes no assumptions about linearity, it can handle hard constraints as well as migration of a nonlinear system away from its linearized operating point, both of which are major drawbacks to LQR.

This means that LQR can become weak when operating away from stable fixed points. MPC can chart a path between these fixed points, but convergence of a solution is not guaranteed, especially if thought as to the convexity and complexity of the problem space has been neglected.

<text>The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) is a federal research branch of the Australian Government Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment, located in Canberra, Australia. ABARES was established on 21 August 1945 as the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE), and is also involved in commercial consultancy. It was merged with the Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS) in 2010. The main role of ABARES is to provide &quot;professionally independent data, research, analysis and advice that informs public and private decisions affecting Australian agriculture, fisheries and forestry&quot;. ABARES maintains the AgSurf database which includes farm survey data on farm performance, production benchmarks, farm management, socioeconomic indicators relating to the grains, beef, sheep and dairy industries in Australia. ABARES has received funding from business and industry groups. ABARES&#x27; website notes that &quot;Over half of ABARES&#x27; external revenue is derived from commercial consulting work.&quot;

==History==
ABARES was founded on the 21st of August 1945 as the Bureau of Agricultural Economics (BAE) with the preliminary purpose of researching the economic potential of primary industries and their efficiency. Initially, the bureau was established to operate within the Ministry of Post-War Reconstruction and was then transferred into the Ministry for Commerce and Agriculture in August 1946. In 1988, the bureau combined with the Bureau of Mineral Resources to become the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE) which would further widen the field of research to include energy, minerals markets and issues such as climate change. In 2010, ABARE undertook a further merger with the Bureau of Rural Sciences (BRS) with the goal to grant ABARES the capacity to undertake integrated economic, scientific and social science research.
In 1952, the bureau began to undertake frequent review and forecasts of farm survey data. Formal and regular assessments including a wider variety of productivity indicators of Australian agriculture began in the 1980s.

==People==
ABARES is under the direct leadership of several federal Ministers which include:

In 1948, ABARES had 25 professional staff with university degrees in economics or agricultural economics, and this number grew to 55 in 1954 than to 85 in 1962. During the 1970s ABARES&#x27; employee count had risen to 200 with special qualifications in economics. In the 1980s when the then ABARE merged with the Bureau of Mineral Resources to become ABARES, the total employee count peaked at just above 300, from the 1980s the employee count of ABARES declined to roughly 125 employees as of 2017–18.

== Data Collection, Processes and Procedures ==
ABARES collects a broad range of commodity, climate and agricultural data. The data ABARES collects is the chief source of publicly available data for Australian agricultural and resource economics related commodities and industries, and has been described as more accurate in these fields than other organisations. ABARES&#x27; surveys are sometimes collected via face-to-face interviews. Compared with other national agricultural and resource economics data collection agencies, ABARES is considered one of the more reliable and thorough. While ABARES does collate and produce reports exclusively within ABARES, often, ABARES will co-produce reports and documents with industry groups. By working collaboratively, the advice ABARES and the private entity provide will be received more effectively than information provided solely by ABARES or a private entity.

ABARES collates three annual agricultural surveys which includes:

 – The Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industry Survey (AAGIS)
 – Australian Dairy Industry Survey (ADI)
 – Murray-Darling Basin Irrigation Survey 

The Australian Agricultural and Grazing Industry Survey (AAGIS) is a large report compiled by ABARES which assesses broadacre industries on a yearly basis. ABARES determines the target number and types of farms to include in the AAGIS survey. To do this, ABARES collects data on farms that participated in the survey in the previous year (and would like to participate in the current year) and then resample the remaining population to reach the target number and composition. Furthermore, the data collected within the AAGIS survey is split into various zones as to aid consistent data interpretation.

The ADI survey covers farms that are engaged in dairying. Australia&#x27;s Dairy industry is the third largest rural industry behind wheat and beef and has a gross value of $4 billion.

The Murray-Darling Basin Irrigation Survey covers a broad range of industries and subindustries. The gross revenue from agriculture in the basin was $13.6 billion in 2000–01, of which $4.6 billion was estimated to be derived from irrigation. Irrigated agriculture is practiced on about 15 000 different farming properties throughout the Basin. The three main industries in this survey include Broadacre, Dairy and Horticulture. These are then subdivided into smaller industries to survey data on sheep farming, beef farming, grain growing, rice growing, cotton growing, dairy cattle farming, vegetable growing under cover and outdoors, grape, apple and pear, stone fruit, citrus fruit and other fruit and tree nut growing.

ABARES additionally collaborates with many other Australian government agencies to collect data on specific industries that may overlap with the other agency.
== Publications ==
The data collected by ABARES is often used for governmental and private sector consulting. Additionally, the data collected by ABARES has been used by independent researchers on several occasions to assist in accurate and reliable reporting. ABARES also produces many forecasts throughout the year, &quot;ABARES regularly prepares forecasts of area, production, and yields for more than twenty winter and summer crops in each Australian State&quot;. Among the regular forecasts and reports is a weekly national update, the update covers a range of topic including climate data, key issues, commodity information and water usage.

Forecasting and modelling was widely used in commodity outlook studies, it wasn&#x27;t until the 1970s these models were applied to agricultural markets. The expanding of these forecasts and models globally allowed ABARES to dedicate more of their resources to publishing these types of models. The 1980s introduction of the Econometric Model of Australian Broadacre Agriculture (EMABA) was one of the first major forecasting models produced by ABARES. Agricultural forecasts are still regularly published with the aim to provide information on expected prices to help ensure that markets operate fairly, and, identify and form policy responses to emerging issues. Additionally, ABARES publishes data on land usage and land occupation which assists in forecasts and modelling.

Through hosting the Annual National Outlook Conference, ABARES has been able to collate annual forecasts of major commodities and quarterly gross values of agricultural production, resources and exports.

During the 2018 Banking Royal Commission, ABARES provided a broad range of data from farm surveys and other public resources to assist the investigation of farm indebtedness. The main publication that was used for the background report was the &quot;Regional farm debt: northern Queensland gulf, south west Queensland and north west New South Wales&quot; report which was published in December 2014.

Additionally, ABARES publish a number of series, including the Australian quarterly forecast report, &quot;Agricultural commodities&quot; , since September 2011).

=== History of Agricultural commodities report ===
The &quot;Agricultural commodities&quot; title replaced &quot;Australian commodities: forecasts and issues&quot; , March 1994 – June 2011), formerly &quot;Agriculture and Resources Quarterly&quot; , March 1989 – December 1993).

&quot;Agriculture and Resources Quarterly&quot; originated from the merging of &quot;Resource Trends&quot; , September 1986 – December 1988) and &quot;Quarterly review of the rural economy&quot; , February 1979 – December 1988, previously &quot;Quarterly review of agricultural economics&quot; , January 1948 – April/July 1978).

== Controversy ==
In February 1998 the Commonwealth Ombudsman produced a report of an investigation into ABARE&#x27;s external funding of climate change economic modelling. The investigation was instigated after the Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) sought membership of ABARES&#x27; established GIGABARE Steering Committee. ABARES sought a membership fee from ACF which the ACF requested to be waived. After the waiver was declined the ACF then made a formal complaint to the Ombudsman on the basis of:

 * ABARES&#x27;s undisclosed source for research funding,
 * ABARES&#x27;s lack of appropriate guidelines and protocols for private sector funding, where private funded projects informed government decisions, and
 * The Steering Committees established by ABARES&#x27; were not accessible to organisations without significant financial resources and thus ABARES&#x27; role providing assistance and advice would be swayed in favour of business interests.

As a result of the investigation the Ombudsman ruled against ABARES and concluded the GIGABARE committee was constituted by ABARE primarily as a means of raising additional revenue for these projects. As a result of the findings ABARES underwent radical restructuring which aimed to limit the possibility of corrupt or fraudulent behaviour into the future.

<text>The Santa Rosa First Peoples Community is the major organisation of Indigenous people in Trinidad and Tobago. The Kalinago of Arima are descended from the original Amerindian inhabitants of Trinidad; Amerindians from the former &quot;encomiendas&quot; of Tacarigua and Arauca (Arouca) were resettled to Arima between 1784 and 1786. The SRCC was incorporated in 1973 to preserve the culture of the Caribs of Arima and maintain their role in the annual Santa Rosa Festival (dedicated to Santa Rosa de Lima, the first Catholic saint canonised in the New World).

The SRCC is headed by its President Ricardo Bharath Hernandez and maintains a leadership role among Indigenous organisations in Trinidad. The community is also the base for the Carib Queen.

The Amerindians were relocated to open their lands for settlement by the influx of French settlers brought in by the &quot;Cedula of Population&quot; and to separate the Indigenous people from the newcomers (&quot;see: History of Trinidad and Tobago&quot;). The Mission was granted 1000 acres (4 km²) of land by Governor José María Chacón, and Governor Ralph Woodford added 320 acres (1.3 km²). However, as the Mission gradually dissolved, these lands were seized by the state.

<text>Major General Nguyễn Văn Hiếu (23 June 1929, Tianjin, China – 8 April 1975, Biên Hòa, Vietnam) was a general in the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). As a child he lived in Shanghai. He later emigrated with his ethnic Vietnamese parents to Saigon when the Chinese Communist Party took over China in 1949. He attended Aurore University in Shanghai, China. In 1950, he attended the Vietnamese Military Academy, graduating second in his class in 1951. In 1963, he graduated from Command and General Staff College, at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

His assignments included G3/Joint General Staff, G3/I Corps, Chief of Staff of 1st Division, Chief of Staff of I Corps, Chief of Staff of II Corps, Commander of 22nd Division, Chief of Staff of II Corps, Commander of 5th Division, Deputy Commander of I Corps, Minister of Anti-Corruption under Vice-President Trần Văn Hương, Deputy Commander of III Corps, Commander of Forward HQ III Corps and MG Deputy Commander of III Corps. He was found dead on 8 April 1975 at III Corps Headquarters, Biên Hòa, and theories that he had been assassinated emerged. Two days later, he was posthumously promoted to lieutenant general.

==Military operations==

===Quyết Thắng 202 (Đỗ Xá), 1964===

Hiếu, II Corps Chief of Staff, designed and executed Operation Quyết Thắng (Sure Win) 202 aiming directly at the Viet Cong (VC) stronghold at Đỗ Xá (), deep in the Annamite Mountains, at the junction of Kon Tum, Quảng Ngãi and Quảng Tin provinces, from 27 April to 27 May 1964. Units of 50th Regiment, 25th Division participated under the command of Major Phan Trong Trinh, four Ranger battalions under the command of Major Son Thuong and one Airborne battalion under the command of Captain Ngô Quang Trưởng.

Troops were ferried to two landing zones by three helicopters squadrons: USMC HMM-364 Squadron, 117th and 119th squadron of US Army 52nd Aviation Battalion. The VC attacked the helicopters at the landing zones during the two first days, and then vanished into the mountains, avoiding contacts with the invading troops. Operation Đỗ Xá achieved the following results: a communication network of the VC command composed of five stations was destroyed, one of which was used to communicate with North Vietnam, and the other four to link with provincial VC units; the VC lost 62 killed, 17 captured, two 0.51 caliber machine guns, one 0.30 caliber machine gun, 69 individual weapons, and a large quantity of mines and grenades, engineer equipment, explosives, medicine, and documents; in addition, 185 structures, 17 tons of food and of crops were destroyed.

===Thần Phong II===
In 1965, the VC attacked all over the Central Highlands in the II Military Region. In early July 1965, three People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam (PAVN) regiments (including 32nd and possibly the 33rd) completely isolated the Central Highlands. ARVN units could not use National Routes 1, 11, 14, 19 and 21, and all resupplies to the Highlands had to be performed by air. On 8 July 1965 Hiếu, II Corps Chief of Staff, was entrusted with the design and execution of a plan to reopen National Route 19.

Contrary to the general practice of a road-clearing operation by concentrating troops to progressively destroy the ambushes set up by the enemy along the highway, from D-6 to D+2, Hiếu ordered the 22nd Division and the 3rd Armored Squadron to attack from Qui Nhơn to Tuy Hòa along National Route 1; the 2nd Airborne Task Force together with Regional Forces and Civilian Irregulars Defense Group Forces to retake Lê Thành District; VNMC Alpha Task Force and the 42nd Regiment to attack from Pleiku up north to Đak Sut on National Route 14; and the 20th Engineer Group to attack from Phú Bổn to Tuy Hòa to repair Interprovincial Route 7.

After sowing confusion among the enemy, Hiếu &quot;press[ed] the Viet Cong from three directions with movements launched from Pleiku and Qui Nhơn and a vertical envelopment from north of An Khê. These maneuvers were executed by a task force of the Pleiku sector departing from Pleiku, two task forces of the 22nd Infantry Division departing from Qui Nhơn, and a task force of two airborne battalions heliborne into northern An Khê and attacking south with Task Force Alpha of the marines brigade conducting the linkup.&quot; These actions resulted in the free flow of cargo convoys during 5 days from D+3 to D+7, &quot;allowing an initial buildup of 5,365 tons of supplies in Pleiku&quot;. Later, operational units withdrew to their camps during D+8 and D+9. As a result of Operation Thần Phong, &quot;the convoys transfused new life into the Highlands. Along with an immediate drop of 25 to 30 percent in the price of food and commodities, the population regained their feelings of security, confidence, and hope. Schoolboys in Pleiku voluntarily helped the troops in unloading the cargoes, and people who had started to evacuate now returned to their homesteads.&quot; 

===Pleime, 1965===

After the unsuccessful attempt to overcome the Đức Cơ Special Forces camp in August 1965, General Võ Nguyên Giáp launched the Winter Spring Campaign aiming at cutting South Vietnam in two, from Pleiku in the Central Highlands to Qui Nhơn in the coastal regions. The plan of General Chu Huy Man, VC Field Commander was as follows:
# PAVN 33rd Regiment feigns to attack Plei Me Camp to entice II Corps to dispatch relief column from Pleiku;
# PAVN 32nd Regiment sets an ambush to destroy the relief column (an easy target without artillery support nearby);
# after destroying the relief column, 32nd Regiment joins up with 33rd Regiment in overcoming Plei Me Camp;
# in the meantime, with the defense of Pleiku weakened by the troops sent out to rescue Plei Me, PAVN 66th Regiment initiates a preliminary attack against II Corps HQ, awaiting 32nd and 33rd Regiments to overcome Plei Me and to join forces to attack and occupy Pleiku.

Hiếu consulted with the US 1st Cavalry Division and came up with the following plan:
# II Corps feigns biting the bait by reinforcing Plei Me with a unit of ARVN Airborne Rangers and dispatches a task force from Pleiku to relieve Plei Me;
# 1st Cavalry Division lends a brigade to reinforce the defense of Pleiku and heli-lifts artillery batteries to several locations near the ambush site to support the relief column when under attacked.

This plan neutralized the PAVN 66th Regiment, which remained inactive in the Chư Prông area, destroyed the PAVN 33rd Regiment at the ambush site and the PAVN 32nd Regiment abandoned the siege of Plei Me and withdrew into the surrounding jungle.

===Liên Kết 66===
42nd Regiment, 22nd Division, reinforced by 3rd Airborne Task Force established a blocking position on the mountain side, joined force with an armored squadron of M113s in sweeping the enemy from National Route 1 into the mountains at Phù Cũ Pass in Bình Định Province. Infantrymen following the M113s launched fierce assaults, after an initial salvo of artillery. Airborne Task Force Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Nguyễn Khoa Nam observing the battle from the mountainside with binocular stated: &quot;Colonel Hiếu conducts his troops like a seasoned &#x27;armor officer&#x27;, and combatants of 22nd Division fought as elegantly as our paratroopers.&quot;

===Đại Bàng 800===
In February 1967, Hiếu launched Operation Đại Bàng 800. For three days prior to Vietnamese operation, units of the US 1st Cavalry Division were unsuccessful in discovering the enemy in their operational areas. Hiếu lured the enemy by dispatching a reduced regiment to set up an overnight camp in Phù Mỹ, knowing that enemy spies amongst the indigenous farmers would report the status of the operational troops. Hiếu positioned a motorized infantry battalion and an armored unit 10 kilometers away. Thinking they had an easy target, the enemy attacked the camp with a regiment belonging to the PAVN 3rd Division at 2:00 a.m. Alerted by the regiment&#x27;s commander, Hiếu sent in the reserve forces to cut off the enemy&#x27;s retreat and join forces with the defenders. After a three-hour fierce battle, the enemy reportedly left behind more than 300 dead and numerous weapons.

In August 1969 General Le Ngoc Trien replaced Hiếu as commander of the 22nd Division and Hiếu replaced the inept, but politically-connected General Phạm Quốc Thuần as commander of the 5th Division, however US officials had major reservations about this replacement, not regarding Hiếu as a dynamic leader.

===Toàn Thắng 46===
From May to July 1970, the 5th Division participated in the Cambodian Campaign with Operation Total Victory 46 in the Fishhook area, north of Lộc Ninh. This base area was considered to be used by the PAVN 5th Division as a headquarters location and training area and the 70th Rear Service Group which moved supplies down the Serges Jungle Highway. Elements of the PAVN 5th Division were identified along with elements of the 70th Rear Service Group and its affiliated hospitals. The division&#x27;s mission was to attack and destroy the 70th and 80th Rear Service Groups: one hospital and one training center. Division elements will locate and destroy or evacuate enemy foods, ammunition, weapons and medical caches in the operational area. In preparation for the operation Hiếu with his G3, the CDAT commander and the DCAT G3 made the initial area coordination with General Casey of the 1st Cavalry Division and his G3. Upon completion of this initial coordination the Assistant Division Commander of the 5th Division, Commanding Officer of the 9th Regiment, and the DCAT G3 effected direct coordination with the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. During the operation coordination was made by the 9th Regimental Commander and his DCAT Commander for the joint occupation of Fire Support Base Gonder by elements of the 9th Regiment and the 1st Cavalry Division. Operation Total Victory 46 was conducted in 5 phases. Phase I was the attack phase. Phase II, III and IV were search and destroy phases. Phase V was the withdrawal phase.

In mid-1970 MACV rated General Hiếu as &quot;unsatisfactory&quot; and recommended his relief as commander of the 5th Division.

===Toàn Thắng 8/B/5===
The 5th Division was notified by III Corps Headquarters on 14 October 1970, to prepare for limited combat operations in the Snuol District of Cambodia, for the purpose of destroying enemy forces, installations, and obtaining enemy information. Operation Total Victory 8/B/9 was conducted from 23 October to 10 November 1970 against the PAVN 5th Division: 174 Regiment, 275 Regiment, Z27 Recon Battalion; Rear Service Group 86, C11 (medical); C1/K2 Guerrilla force, northwest of Snuol; Guerrilla force, Snuol Town Market; Guerrilla force, K&#x27;bai Trach, southwest of Snuol. Hiếu together with his G3 Staff, was in charge of planning the details of the whole operation. The operational Task Organization was composed of 3 Task Forces: TF1 (Commanded by CO, 1st ACR), TF9 (Commanded by CO, 9th Regiment) and TF333 (Commanded by CO, 3rd Ranger GP). TF333 was entrusted the protection and security of the main supply route. The Division Operation Plan was approved by III Corps on 21 October 1970. A final coordination meeting was conducted on 22 October 1970 at Lai Khê, and was attended by all commanders involved. Operation Total Victory 8/B/5 was composed of 3 phases. Phase I: movement to contact and contact in the vicinity of Snoul. Phase II: movement north of Snoul. Phase III is the withdrawal phase.

===Toàn Thắng TT02 (Snuol 1971)===

In the end of 1970, Hiếu planned to lure the enemy with a regiment placed in Snuol in Cambodian territory, north of Lộc Ninh on National Route 13. The PAVN had 3 divisions (5th, 7th and 9th) operating in that area. III Corps was ready to commit all of its three Divisions (5th, 18th and 25th) in the event the North Vietnamese engaged one, two or all three divisions into the battlefield. General Trí the III Corps Commander died in a helicopter accident at the end of February 1971. General Minh, who replaced Trí, did not want to follow through with the luring plan, when 8th Task Force was succeeding in attracting the PAVN who gathered two divisions (5th and 7th) around Snuol. The beleaguered troops of 8th Task Force, when neither rescue column nor B-52 bombers were in sight, were about to raise the white flag to surrender to the PAVN. However, Hiếu executed his withdrawal plan in time to bring his troops back to Lộc Ninh. The troops&#x27; withdrawal was executed in three phases:

# on 29 May 1971, 1/8th Battalion pierced through enemy blocking line at the northern outpost to rejoin the 8th Task Force Command Post located at Snuol market;
# on 30 May 1971, 8th Task Force using 1/8th Battalion as the spear-head to pierce enemy blocking line, followed behind by 2/8th Battalion, Task Force Command Post, 1st Armored Squadron with 2/7th Battalion acting as rear cover, to withdraw from Snuol to the location defended by 3/8th Battalion, 3 kilometers Southeast of Snuol on National Route 13;
# on 31 May 1971, 3/8th Battalion replaced 1/8th Battalion as the spearhead in piercing enemy blocking line, followed by 3/9th Battalion, 2/7th Battalion, Task Force Command Post, 1st Armored Squadron with 1/8th Battalion acting as rear cover, allowing 8th Task Force to reach the border on a 3 kilometer stretch and to return to Lộc Ninh.

Regarded by US advisers as the worst ARVN Division commander, Hiếu&#x27;s forces had been badly handled during the Snuol operation, and his troops, according to II Field Force, Vietnam commander Michael S. Davison, were close to mutiny. Pushed by both Abrams and Minh to relieve him, Thiệu finally acceded and in April 1971 brought Col. Lê Văn Hưng up from Phong Dinh Province to take over the battered Division. Unfortunately, Hưng was the one ARVN officer whose candidacy American advisers had specifically recommended against. To the despair of US advisers Hiếu was promoted to deputy commander of I Corps.

===Easter Offensive===
Following their incompetent handling of the First Battle of Quảng Trị, both Hiếu and the I Corps commander Hoàng Xuân Lãm were relieved. Lãm was replaced by Lieutenant general Ngô Quang Trưởng, who succeeded in halting the PAVN advance at the Mỹ Chánh Line. Hiếu was replaced by Lieutenant general Lâm Quang Thi.

===Svay Riêng, 1974===

In 1974, as Deputy Commander of Operations/III Corps, assistant to General Phạm Quốc Thuần, Hiếu applied Blitzkrieg (lightning war) tactics to alleviate the pressure exerted by the PAVN 5th Division originating from Svay Rieng Province in the Parrot&#x27;s Beak area of Cambodian territory aiming at Đức Huệ base camp. Hiếu employed twenty mobile battalions to surround the Parrot&#x27;s Beak area. Secondly, on April 27, he launched 49th Infantry Regiment and 7th Ranger Group through the swamp lands around Đức Huệ towards the Cambodian border, and had Republic of Vietnam Air Force airplanes attack positions of PAVN 5th Division units. In the meantime, he relied on two Regional Force battalions belonging to IV Corps to move from Mộc Hóa up north to establish blocking positions on the southwestern edge of the PAVN 5th Division&#x27;s logistical base and assembly area. On 28 April, Hiếu launched eleven battalions into the battleground to conduct preliminary operation in preparation of the main offensive.

The next morning, three armored squadrons of the III Corps Assault Task Force rushed across the Cambodian border from Gò Dầu Hạ, aiming directly at PAVN 5th Division HQ. Meanwhile, a task force composing of infantry and armor of IV Corps, originating from Mộc Hóa, maneuvered across the Cambodian border into the Elephant&#x27;s Foot area to threaten the retreat of the PAVN 275th Regiment. The three armored squadrons continued their three-pronged advance 16 kilometers deep into the Cambodia before they veered south toward Hậu Nghĩa, and helicopters dropped troops unexpectedly on PAVN positions, while other ARVN units conducted rapid operations into the region between Đức Huệ and Gò Dầu Hạ. On 10 May, when the last ARVN units returned to their base camp, enemy communications and supplies networks were seriously disrupted. The PAVN suffered 1,200 killed, 65 prisoners, and tons of weapons captured; while, due to speed, secrecy and coordination factors of a multi-faced operation, the ARVN suffered less than 100 casualties.

==Anticorruption czar==
Vice President Trần Văn Hương appointed Hiếu anticorruption czar on 10 February 1972. He occupied this position until October 1973. At that time corruption was rampant among the ARVN leadership, in the army, the administration, the police, the power authority, Air Vietnam, customs, etc. Hiếu chose to attack first the Military Pension Fund. After a five-month investigation, he presented his findings in detail on the national television on 14 July 1972.

As a result, the Defense Minister, General Nguyễn Văn Vy and seven colonels were ousted and the Military Pension Fund disbanded. Hiếu was not allowed to move on to other corruption targets. Thiệu limited Hiếu&#x27;s investigative authority and prior presidential approval was necessary to commence an investigation at the level of chief of province. These limitations disappointed Hiếu who sought to return to the military and declared, &quot;Either we correct our faults or the Communists will correct them for us.&quot; 

==Evaluation==
I Corps American Advisors&#x27; evaluation report in May 1968:

Colonel John Hayes, ARVN 5th Infantry Division Senior Advisor&#x27;s evaluation on 7 February 1970:
General Trần Văn Đôn&#x27;s assessment:
==Unanswered questions concerning his death==
On 8 April 1975, news came out of III Corps headquarters in Biên Hòa that Hiếu was found dead in his office. The next day, after attending the military press conference, UPI correspondent sent out the following dispatch: &quot;SAIGON (UPI) - The deputy commander of South Vietnamese troops defending the Saigon area was found shot to death Tuesday night following an argument with his superior over tactics. Military sources said he apparently committed suicide. The sources said Maj. Gen. Hiếu was found with a bullet wound in his mouth at his III Corps office at the edge of Biên Hòa airbase, northeast of Saigon. It was not known whether Hiếu&#x27;s death was connected with the Tuesday morning bombing of the Presidential palace of Nguyễn Văn Thiệu.&quot;

<text>The Nebraska State Capitol is the seat of government of the U.S. state of Nebraska and is located in downtown Lincoln. Designed by New York architect Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue in 1920, it was constructed of Indiana limestone from 1922 to 1932. The capitol houses the primary executive and judicial offices of Nebraska and is home to the Nebraska Legislature—the only unicameral state legislature in the United States.

The Nebraska State Capitol&#x27;s tower can be seen away. It was the first state capitol to incorporate a functional tower into its design. Goodhue stated that &quot;Nebraska is a level country and its capitol should have some altitude or beacon effect.&quot; In 1976, the National Park Service designated the capitol a National Historic Landmark, and in 1997, the Park Service extended the designation to include the capitol grounds, which Ernst H. Herminghaus designed in 1932.

==Dimensions and features==

The structure is anchored by a three-story, square base. This square base houses offices most frequently visited by the public. The second floor (main floor) is home to the office of the Governor of Nebraska, the Nebraska Supreme Court, the Nebraska Court of Appeals, and the Nebraska Legislature.

From the center of the base, a tower rises , crowned by a gold-tiled dome. The finial—&quot;The Sower&quot; and its pedestal—add an additional to the building&#x27;s height. Common measurements list the capitol at , making it the second-tallest U.S. statehouse, surpassed only by the Louisiana State Capitol (then-Governor of Louisiana Huey Pierce Long insisted the new Louisiana capitol be built taller than Nebraska&#x27;s.).

Goodhue originally envisioned much of the tower to house the collections of the Nebraska State Library, and he planned for each of the tower floors to include glass-floored stacks for book storage. As early as November 1920, however, Goodhue indicated that the tower could serve any purpose, including office space. By September 1925, the Capitol Commission decided that the tower should be built for office space. Tower floors continue to house various offices today.

In total, there are 15 stories in the capitol (three mechanical levels also exist within the tower between the 3rd and 4th floors). Memorial Chamber on the 14th floor—the highest publicly accessible level—has four observation decks that offer views of Lincoln from above the ground.

Lincoln Municipal Code places height restrictions on structures within the designated Capitol Environs District. This code helps to maintain the capitol&#x27;s title as the tallest building in Lincoln. The capitol held the title of tallest building in Nebraska until 1969 with the completion of the Woodmen Tower in downtown Omaha. With the completion of Omaha&#x27;s First National Bank Tower in 2002, the capitol became the third-tallest building in Nebraska.

==Capital cities, capitol buildings==
Congress officially opened Nebraska Territory with the passage of the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854. Almost instantly a factional divide between North Platters (those living north of the Platte River) and South Platters (those living south of the Platte) arose over the question of capital location. Much to the chagrin of the South Platters, Acting Governor Thomas B. Cuming selected the small northern village of Omaha City for the seat of government. Cuming was from Iowa, and as his political allies were investors in the Council Bluffs and Nebraska Ferry Company, Omaha as capital would be beneficial to his personal political career. 
Results from the first territorial census, however, revealed 914 North Platters and 1,818 South Platters. The South Platters, with greater legislative representation, would be able to take the capital, but Cuming ignored proportional representation and assigned seven councilmen and fourteen representatives to the north and six councilmen and twelve representatives to the south. The North Platters, with greater political power, confirmed Omaha as the capital.

In Omaha, two structures served the Territory of Nebraska. The first was a two-story brick building donated by the Council Bluffs and Nebraska Ferry Company. This building, formerly located on 9th Street between Douglas and Farnam, served the Territorial Legislature for the sessions of 1855 and 1857. A second building, constructed in 1857–58 on the site of present-day Omaha Central High School, served the remaining sessions of the Territorial Legislature and the first sessions of the State Legislature beginning in 1867. In June 1867, the Third Session of the State Legislature passed Senate Bill Number 44 which &quot;provid[ed] for the location of the Seat of Government of the State of Nebraska, and for the erection of public building thereat.&quot; The bill also created a commission (remembered as the Capital Commission) whose charge was to select a capital site somewhere within the boundaries of Seward County, the southern halves of Butler and Saunders counties, and the northern half of Lancaster County. On July 29, 1867, the Capital Commission selected the village of Lancaster as the capital city and renamed it Lincoln.

In Lincoln, two structures first served the State of Nebraska. On October 10, 1867, the Capital Commission contracted Chicago architect John Morris to build a statehouse in Lincoln on the newly platted Capitol Square (bounded by the streets of 14th and 16th, H and K). Morris designed the capitol with local limestones which began to deteriorate upon the building&#x27;s completion in late 1868. By 1879, the State of Nebraska determined to replace its crumbling statehouse through piecemeal construction of a new capitol. Architect William H. Willcox designed a Renaissance Revival capitol, and the legislature appropriated $75,000 for construction of its west wing—finished in 1881. The same year, the legislature appropriated $100,000 for an east wing, which was finished in 1882. In 1883, the legislature authorized the Board of Public Lands and Buildings to raze the old capitol and construct the central portion of the Willcox design, not to exceed $450,000. The State of Nebraska finally completed its new, second state capitol in 1888.
The second state capitol began to experience structural issues, especially in its foundation, within a couple of decades of its completion. After the building was deemed unsafe, the Nebraska Legislature made several attempts to fund the construction of a third state capitol.

== Architectural history ==

On February 20, 1919, the Nebraska Legislature passed House Roll 3 which established the Nebraska Capitol Commission to oversee construction of a new statehouse. The next day, Governor McKelvie signed the bill with its emergency clause and appointed the new commission. William E. Hardy, president of Hardy Furniture Company, and Walter W. Head, vice president of the Omaha National Bank, were Republicans from Lincoln and Omaha respectively. William H. Thompson, a prominent lawyer, was a Democrat from Grand Island. The three citizen members joined the ex officio members, Governor McKelvie and State Engineer George E. Johnson, to become the Nebraska Capitol Commission.

House Roll 3 declared that the cost of the capitol was not to exceed $5 million and established the Capitol Fund, which consisted of the proceeds of a special property tax. The Capitol Commission let the Capitol Fund accrue for two years before construction in order to have ample cash reserves. Throughout construction of the capitol, the legislature extended the levy and ultimately raised the spending limit to $10 million. The Nebraska State Constitution limits state indebtedness, so most state projects must be funded on a &quot;pay-as-you-go&quot; basis. The State of Nebraska funded the capitol under the same principles, and the final cost, $9,800,449.07, was completely paid when the Capitol Commission dissolved in 1935.

=== Competition program ===

One of the Capitol Commission&#x27;s first actions was to hire Omaha architect Thomas Rogers Kimball to serve as the commission&#x27;s professional advisor. Kimball, who was president of the American Institute of Architects, devised a two-stage competition for the selection of a capitol architect. In the preliminary stage, the commission invited Nebraska architects to submit capitol designs and hired Irving Kane Pond to serve as judge. Together, Pond and the commission selected Ellery L. Davis (Lincoln), John Latenser &amp; Sons (Omaha), and John McDonald and Alan McDonald (Omaha) to compete in the final stage. Next the commission opened the final stage to nationally known architects including: Bliss &amp; Faville (San Francisco), Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue (New York), H. Van Buren Magonigle (New York), McKim, Mead, and White (New York), John Russell Pope (New York), Tracy &amp; Swartwout (New York), and Paul Cret and Zantzinger, Borie and Medary (Philadelphia).

Kimball wrote an innovative competition program that did not dictate plan, style, or material for the capitol. The program did state, however, the commission&#x27;s desire that the architect collaborate with &quot;sculptor, painter, and landscapist&quot; to create a unified design. Finally, Kimball organized the competition so that the jury was selected only after the ten competitors had submitted their designs to the Capitol Commission. The designs were identified by numbers and &quot;separate sealed envelopes contained the architects&#x27; names and plan numbers.&quot; Next, the Capitol Commission chose the first of three competition jurors, Waddy Butler Wood; the competitors chose the second, James Gamble Rogers; and Wood and Rogers chose the third, Willis Polk. On June 26, 1920, the jury chose the author of design &quot;Number 4&quot; as the architect of the Nebraska State Capitol. The author of design &quot;Number 4&quot; was Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue.

=== Goodhue&#x27;s design ===

Goodhue designed the Nebraska State Capitol in a roughly Classical architectural style, and he felt &quot;impelled to produce something quite unlike the usual...thing of the sort, with its veneered order and invariable Roman dome.&quot; Goodhue employed Classical principles of geometric form and hierarchical arrangement but eliminated the traditional use of columns, pediments, and domes. In addition to the restrained Classical vocabulary, Goodhue mixed elements of Achaemenid, Assyrian, Byzantine, Gothic, and Romanesque architecture.

Goodhue was a well-established church architect. He designed St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Church (New York), the West Point Cadet Chapel, and the Church of the Intercession (New York). The Nebraska State Capitol features similar church vocabulary. The plan is a modified cross-in-square plan enclosed by a square. Four arms radiate from a central domed rotunda, upon which rises the tower with its unarticulated windows and flat surfaces—much like an enlarged spire.

=== Construction ===

In March 1922, the Capitol Commission built an electric railroad spur from Lincoln&#x27;s Burlington yards. The state-owned line ran along H Street from 7th to 14th Streets and provided an easy means for delivery of construction materials. Then on April 15, 1922, Governor Samuel R. McKelvie ceremonially broke ground, thus beginning a ten-year construction process which occurred in four phases. Building in phases allowed construction to commence before demolition of the old statehouse. With completion of the capitol&#x27;s Phase 1 in 1924, state operations moved into the new structure. The old capitol was subsequently razed. On April 23, 1924—just two years into the capitol&#x27;s construction—Bertram Goodhue died, and his associates formed a firm, Bertram Grosvenor Goodhue Associates, to finish the capitol and other ongoing Goodhue projects. After construction ended in 1932, the Capitol Commission hired Lincoln landscape architect Ernst Herminghaus to design the grounds.
=== Integrated art program ===

Bertram Goodhue employed two New York artists, Lee Lawrie and Hildreth Meière, in both the exterior and interior ornamentation of the Nebraska State Capitol. Lawrie, a sculptor, designed all of the engaged relief panels and buttress figures of the exterior, along with interior column capitals, doors, and fireplace surrounds. Meière, a muralist, designed the marble mosaic panels of the floors and the ceramic tile panels of the vaults.

On January 20, 1922, the Capitol Commission requested Goodhue to consult with Hartley Burr Alexander, of the University of Nebraska&#x27;s department of philosophy, &quot;to work out the inscriptions to be used on the Capitol Building.&quot; In addition to the inscriptions, Alexander began to work closely with Goodhue and Lawrie on the themes of the exterior sculptures. When Goodhue died in 1924, Alexander feared that the thematic development in future portions of the capitol would be inconsistent with the established schemes. He therefore wrote an overarching thematic program, &quot;Nebraska State Capitol: Synopsis of Decorations and Inscriptions,&quot; in July 1926. Alexander&#x27;s synopsis thus served as a guide for the remaining interior and exterior decorations, and Alexander was bestowed with the title of Thematic Consultant.

==Exterior==

The exterior of the Nebraska State Capitol is architecturally composed of two parts: the three-story, square base and the tower. Alexander envisioned the base, with its inner cross, as an emblem of the quarters of the Earth representing the drama of human experience, and he envisioned the tower as Earth&#x27;s gnomon representing human ideals. &quot;The Sower&quot;—the finial atop the capitol&#x27;s gold-tiled dome—completes the vertical movement of the exterior symbolism representing agriculture and the &quot;chief purpose in forming society, to sow nobler ideas of living.&quot;

Lee Lawrie designed the principal exterior decoration, representing the history of Western law. &quot;The Sower,&quot; his best-known work at the capitol, is the only work there that is in the round, or free-standing. The remaining ornamentation is engaged within the building&#x27;s limestone in bas-relief, pierced, and buttress form. After Lawrie finalized his designs in plaster maquettes, the Edward Ardolino stone carving contractor employed Alessandro Beretta to execute the carving &quot;in situ&quot;. Beretta would take as long as ten weeks per panel, and use as many as 70 different tools. He finished the carving on November 19, 1934.

===The Main Portal===

The main portal introduces the sculpted ornamentation representing the foundation of life on the Great Plains. Two parapets adorned with relief panels of bison flank the main stairs. The bison represent Plains Indians indigenous to Nebraska, and the principal nations are inscribed within the panels (alphabetically): 
* Arapahoe
* Arikara

* Cheyenne
* Kiowa

* Pawnee
* Ponca

* Omaha
* Otoe

* Sioux
* Winnebago
19th century European Americans are also represented above the main entrance with the gilded relief, &quot;Spirit of the Pioneers&quot;. The relief sits directly atop Alexander&#x27;s inscription: &quot;The Salvation of the State is Watchfulness in the Citizen.&quot; Additionally, an inscription at the crown of the main portal reads: &quot;Wisdom, Justice, Power, and Mercy, Constant Guardians of the Law.&quot; Four buttress figures flank the inscription representing the aforementioned guardians. 

===The Promenade Circuit===

The names of the ninety-three counties of Nebraska are inscribed along the top of the base of the capitol and are loosely grouped by number of letters per name. Directly above the county names, twenty-one panels (eighteen bas-reliefs, three pierced) represent the creation of law. The panels are best observed from the promenade, beginning on the northwest corner of the building:

&quot;Hebrew Law&quot;: Northwest
* &quot;Moses Bringing the Law from Sinai&quot;
* &quot;Deborah Judging Israel&quot;
* &quot;The Judgement of Solomon&quot;

&quot;Greco-Roman Law&quot;: West
* &quot;Solon Giving a New Constitution to Athens&quot;
* &quot;The Publishing of the Twelve Tables in Rome&quot;
* &quot;The Establishment of the Tribunate of the People&quot;

&quot;Greco-Roman Law&quot;: Southwest
* &quot;Plato Writing His Dialog on the Ideal Republic&quot;
* &quot;Orestes Before the Areopagites&quot;
* &quot;The Codification of Roman Law under Justinian&quot;

&quot;Historical Documents&quot;: South (pierced panels)
* &quot;The Signing of the Declaration of Independence&quot;
* &quot;The Magna Carta&quot;
* &quot;The Writing of the Constitution of the United States&quot;

&quot;English Law&quot;: Southeast
* &quot;The Codification of Anglo-Saxon Law under Ethelbert&quot;
* &quot;Milton Defending Free Speech before Cromwell&quot;
* &quot;Burke Defending America in Parliament&quot;

&quot;Freedom in America&quot;: East
* &quot;Las Casas Pleading the Cause of the Indian&quot;
* &quot;The Signing of the Pilgrim Compact on the Mayflower&quot;
* &quot;Lincoln and the Emancipation Proclamation&quot;

&quot;Nebraska Law&quot;: Northeast
* &quot;The Purchase of Louisiana from Napoleon&quot;
* &quot;The Kansas-Nebraska Bill&quot;
* &quot;The Admission of Nebraska as a State in the Union&quot;

Ten buttress sculptures along the top of the capitol&#x27;s south arm represent the great western lawgivers. The buttress figures are depicted in chronological order from west to east and are best observed from the south steps with the exception of the first and the last. The figures of Minos and Napoleon are best observed from the northwest and northeast courtyards respectively:
* &quot;Minos&quot;
* &quot;Hammurabi&quot;

* &quot;Moses&quot; 
* &quot;Akhnaton&quot;

* &quot;Solon&quot; 
* &quot;Solomon&quot;

* &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;
* &quot;Justinian&quot;

* &quot;Charlemagne&quot;
* &quot;Napoleon&quot;
===The Tower===

Eight buttress sculptures around the base of the tower represent the ideals of culture. The buttress figures are best observed from within the four courtyards or at a distance from the sidewalk around the building:
Northwest
* &quot;Pentaour: Dawn of History&quot;
* &quot;Ezekiel: Cosmic Tradition&quot;

Southwest
* &quot;Socrates: Birth of Reason&quot;
* &quot;Marcus Aurelius: Reign of Law&quot;

Southeast
* &quot;St. John the Apostle: Glorification of Faith&quot;
* &quot;Louis IX: Age of Chivalry&quot;

Northeast
* &quot;Isaac Newton: Discovery of Nature&quot;
* &quot;Abraham Lincoln: Liberation of Peoples&quot;
===Landscape===

In May 1933, under ever-worsening economic conditions, the Nebraska Legislature re-appropriated the Capitol Commission&#x27;s unexpended budget. With depleted funds, the commission resolved to terminate its own existence, leaving some projects like the interior murals and the courtyard fountains incomplete. In 2017, the State of Nebraska installed the originally-planned fountains in cast-bronze in each of the Capitol&#x27;s four courtyards.

==Interior==

The interior of the Nebraska State Capitol&#x27;s monumental corridor is architecturally composed of three rooms: Vestibule, Great Hall, and Rotunda. Decorations expanding upon themes of Nebraska are read in a specific sequence beginning at the main, north door. Monumental ornamentation is also found within the Governor&#x27;s Suite, the Warner Legislative Chamber (former senate), the George W. Norris Legislative Chamber (unicameral), and Memorial Chamber (14th floor).

Meière designed the black and white marble mosaic panels of the Great Hall and Rotunda representing the &quot;Procession of Life.&quot; Working with Alexander, Meière drew her inspiration from the Siena Cathedral after the two toured the cathedral in the summer of 1925. Meière also drew inspiration from Siena for her ceiling designs of the Vestibule, Great Hall, and Rotunda representing &quot;Nature, Man, and Society.&quot; In addition to her thematic consultation with Alexander, Meière collaborated closely with the Rafael Guastavino Company of New York to create decorative timbrel vaulting. The vaults are composed of two types of ceramic tiles: glazed polychrome tile and unglazed acoustical terracotta tile called Rumford.

===Vestibule===

The Vestibule introduces the interior ornamentation of the capitol and represents &quot;Gifts of Nature&quot;. The sun is the room&#x27;s central motif and is prominently featured as a medallion within the dome. The dome also incorporates mosaic images of agriculture, flora, and fauna. The vaulting is supported by the largest columns in the capitol—four monoliths of Red Verona marble. The columns&#x27; capitals, designed by Lee Lawrie, are vaguely Corinthian and feature bull motifs inspired from ancient Persepolis architecture.

===Great Hall===

The Great Hall follows the Vestibule and represents &quot;Life of Man&quot;. Three medallions—&quot;Traditions of the Past&quot;, &quot;Life of the Present&quot;, and &quot;Ideals of the Future&quot;—anchor the mosaic vaulting. Additionally, sixteen mosaic panels within the arches depict scenes of human activity, including an &quot;Architect&quot;, a &quot;Ball Player&quot;, and a &quot;Scientist&quot;.

The &quot;Procession of Life&quot; begins in the Great Hall&#x27;s floor with the mosaic &quot;Genius of Creative Energy&quot;—an Apollo-like figure—surrounded by &quot;Cosmic Energy&quot;, lightning, moons, orbs, etc. Three tondi (circular) mosaics follow, depicting the &quot;Spirit of the Soil&quot;, the &quot;Spirit of Vegetation&quot;, and the &quot;Spirit of Animal Life&quot;.

The Great Hall also introduces the Nebraska Hall of Fame—a collection of bronze busts of noteworthy Nebraskans. The capitol&#x27;s Thematic Consultant, Hartley Burr Alexander, is among the 26 current inductees.

===Rotunda===

The Rotunda follows the Great Hall and represents &quot;Virtues of the State.&quot; Eight winged virtues form a celestial rose within the mosaic dome: &quot;Temperance&quot;, &quot;Wisdom&quot;, &quot;Faith&quot;, &quot;Justice&quot;, &quot;Magnanimity&quot;, &quot;Charity&quot;, &quot;Hope&quot;, and &quot;Courage&quot;.

The &quot;Procession of Life&quot; continues in the Rotunda&#x27;s floor with the mosaic panel &quot;Vital Energy&quot;, which shows the &quot;Genius of Life&quot;—an Eros-like figure with butterflies and pine cones. At the Rotunda&#x27;s center, four tondi mosaics representing the &quot;Genius of Water&quot;, the &quot;Genius of Fire&quot;, the &quot;Genius of Air&quot;, and the &quot;Genius of Earth&quot; surround a larger tondo mosaic of &quot;Earth as the Life-giver&quot;. A mosaic band, or guilloche, interlaces the five tondi and depicts the fossil life of the Great Plains. Meière based the fossil mosaics on scientific illustrations drawn by University of Nebraska geologist Erwin Hinckley Barbour. The &quot;Procession of Life&quot; concludes at the Rotunda&#x27;s south entrance with &quot;The Family&quot;.

===Warner Legislative Chamber (east)===

The Warner Legislative Chamber is located to the east of the Rotunda and was originally designed for the Nebraska House of Representatives. In 1927, the Capitol Commission concluded that the chamber was of inadequate size for the representative body, so the Goodhue Associates enlarged the original west, Senate chamber design (which was not yet constructed) and reassigned it for use by the House. Upon the capitol&#x27;s completion in 1932, the Capitol Commission thus reassigned the east chamber to the Nebraska Senate. The chamber served the Senate during the 1933 and 1935 legislative sessions. With the 1937 inception of the unicameral legislature, the east chamber functioned as a committee hearing room and today serves as a public gathering space. On February 4, 1998, the Ninety-Fifth Nebraska Legislature named the chamber in honor of state senators Charles Warner and Jerome Warner with the passage of Legislative Resolution 322.

The chamber represents Plains Indians—Nebraska&#x27;s first inhabitants. The chamber&#x27;s mahogany doors, designed by Lee Lawrie, introduce the theme and depict a woman and a man standing on either side of a tree of life comprising cornstalks. Each door weighs , and Lincoln artisan, Keats Lorenz, executed the carving.

Meière designed the mosaic dome to emulate beadwork, and the vaulting depicts four scenes of Indian life. Alexander also shared images of indigenous art with Meière for inspiration, including ledger art by Amos Bad Heart Bull. Meière used one particular drawing depicting a Sun Dance rite for the design of a tapestry above the speaker&#x27;s niche.

===George W. Norris Legislative Chamber (west)===

The George W. Norris Legislative Chamber is located to the west of the Rotunda. Upon the chamber&#x27;s completion in 1932, it served the Nebraska House of Representatives during the 1933 and 1935 legislative sessions. In 1937, the chamber—being the larger of the two legislative halls—began to serve the unicameral legislature. On February 16, 1984, the Eighty-Eighth Nebraska Legislature named the chamber in honor of U.S. Senator George W. Norris with the passage of Legislative Resolution 257.

The chamber represents Euro-American expansion. The chamber&#x27;s tooled-leather doors, designed by Meière, introduce the theme and depict a tree of life scene styled with Assyrian and Egyptian motifs.

Meière also designed the gold leaf patterns on the walnut-beamed ceiling. The dominant images depict the three Euro-American powers that have claimed the land that is today Nebraska: Spain (castle and lion), France (fleur-de-lis and honey bee), and the United States of America (shield and bald eagle).

===Murals===

The mural program of the capitol is composed of twenty-one defined murals throughout the monumental hallways and Law Library, and a series of allegorical scenes within the Governor&#x27;s Suite.

On September 22, 1925, the Capitol Commission accepted proposals by New York artist Augustus Vincent Tack to paint rooms within the Governor&#x27;s Suite—proposals begun with Bertram Goodhue prior to his death in 1924. Tack completed and installed his series of allegorical figures in November 1927.

On February 21, 1930, the Capitol Commission hired Lincoln artist Elizabeth Dolan to paint a mural on the north wall of the Law Library. Dolan completed &quot;The Spirit of the Prairie&quot; in August 1930. It is the only mural in the capitol painted &quot;in situ&quot;.

Apart from the Governor&#x27;s Suite and the Law Library, Goodhue designed 20 recessed mural spaces for the monumental hallways of the capitol. In May 1933, under ever-worsening economic conditions, the Nebraska Legislature re-appropriated the Capitol Commission&#x27;s unexpended budget. With depleted funds, the commission resolved to terminate its own existence, leaving the mural project incomplete.

In 1951, the Nebraska Legislature created the Capitol Mural Commission and empowered it to complete the mural program. Over the next 50 years, the Capitol Mural Commission held a series of competitions to select artists for the remaining murals. The commission also used details from Dr. Hartley Burr Alexander&#x27;s original thematic plan to guide the subject matter of the murals. 

== Lincoln Monument ==
The Lincoln Monument, located on the capitol&#x27;s west grounds, is composed of the bronze statue, &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot;, created by Daniel Chester French, and the corresponding granite plinth and stele, designed by architect Henry Bacon.

On February 12, 1908, the Young Men&#x27;s Republican Club organized the Abraham Lincoln Memorial Association to seek funds for the erection of an Abraham Lincoln statue on the Nebraska State Capitol grounds, and on July 8, 1908, the association invited Frank M. Hall to organize a committee to commission a sculptor. The committee (including Hall, State Auditor Silas Barton, Dr. H.B. Lowry, General Charles F. Manderson, Governor Ashton C. Shallenberger, Addison Waite, and Gurdon Wattles), awarded French the commission on June 24, 1909, and the committee unveiled the monument on September 2, 1912. Bacon and French later collaborated on the Lincoln Memorial (1914–22) in Washington, D.C.

The Lincoln Monument predates the current statehouse, and the Capitol Commission drew special attention to the monument during the final stage of competition to select an architect for a new capitol in 1920. In a note to the competing architects, the commission wrote, &quot;Solutions should consider this monument and suggest for it a proper part in the ensemble, preferably but not imperatively on the building site proper.&quot; Construction of the new capitol commenced in 1922, and the Lincoln Monument remained intact.

==Social history==

Because of its prominent tower the capitol is popularly nicknamed &quot;Tower on the Plains&quot; or &quot;Penis of the Plains.&quot;

The capitol and its grounds are a frequent site of political demonstrations, rallies, and news conferences.

<text>The University of Houston System is a public university system in the U.S. state of Texas, comprising four separate and distinct universities. It also owns and holds broadcasting licenses to a public television station (KUHT) and a public radio station (KUHF).

The fourth-largest university system in Texas, the UH System has more than 70,000 students and 495,000 alumni from the four distinct universities. Its flagship institution is the University of Houston, a comprehensive doctoral degree-granting research university of about 43,000 students. The economic impact of the UH System contributes over $3 billion annually to the Texas economy, while generating about 24,000 jobs.

The administration is housed in the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building, located on the campus of the University of Houston. The chancellor of the UH System is Renu Khator, who serves concurrently as president of the University of Houston. The System is governed by nine voting-member board of regents, appointed by the Governor of Texas.

==History==
The University of Houston, founded in 1927, entered the state system of higher education in 1963. The evolvement of a University of Houston System came from a recommendation in May 1968 which called for the creation of a university near NASA&#x27;s Manned Spacecraft Center to offer upper-division and graduate-level programs. By 1971, the 62nd Texas Legislature passed House Bill 199 authorizing the establishment of the University of Houston at Clear Lake City as a separate and distinct institution with the organization and control vested in the Board of Regents of the University of Houston.

Recognizing the need for a university presence in Downtown Houston, the board of regents acquired the assets of South Texas Junior College on August 6, 1974 and opened the University of Houston–Downtown College (UH/DC) as a four-year institution under the organization and control of the University of Houston. By August 1979, it became a stand-alone university when the 66th Texas Legislature established UH/DC as a separate and distinct institution in the University of Houston System.

The University of Houston System was created by statute on August 29, 1977, under House Bill 188 during the 65th Texas Legislature. The Board of Regents of the University of Houston was renamed the Board of Regents of the University of Houston System. Philip G. Hoffman became the first chancellor of the System, after serving as president of the University of Houston from 1961 to 1977.

During the 68th Texas Legislature, Senate Bill 235 (SB 235) was signed into law and became effective immediately on April 26, 1983. The bill statutorily established the University of Houston–Victoria as a separate and distinct institution in the University of Houston System, and allowed the university system to acquire and dispose of land or other real property outside of Harris County. In addition, SB 235 changed the names of existing UH System institutions as follows:
:University of Houston was renamed University of Houston–University Park;
:University of Houston at Clear Lake City was renamed University of Houston–Clear Lake; and
:University of Houston–Downtown College was renamed University of Houston–Downtown.
A proposal to reorganize and consolidate state university systems emerged in 1986. The UH System would have been merged into a new university system to include a total of 10 institutions under the recommended reorganization referred to as the &quot;Gulf Coast System.&quot; The proposed consolidation grouping drew oppositions from affected institutions, and the plan never materialized.

In 1991, the University of Houston–University Park reverted to its original name: University of Houston. The addition of the &quot;University Park&quot; appellation was done with little discussion and had never gained community acceptance.

In 1997, the administrations of the UH System and the University of Houston were combined under a single chief executive officer, with the dual title of Chancellor of the UH System and President of the University of Houston. Arthur K. Smith became the first person to have held the combined position.

In November 2007, Renu Khator was selected as the eighth chancellor of the University of Houston System and thirteenth president of the University of Houston. Khator became the first female to hold the chancellorship position, and took office in January 2008. She is the third person to hold the dual role of UH System chancellor and UH president.

On November 16, 2011, the University of Houston System announced that the University of Houston as an institution would replace the university system as the administrative entity for the University of Houston System at Sugar Land. With this action, the campus was renamed the &quot;University of Houston Sugar Land&quot; in January 2012.
==Organizational structure==
===Governance===

The governance, control, jurisdiction, organization, and management of the University of Houston System is vested in its board of regents. The board has all the rights, powers, and duties that it has with respect to the organization and control of the four component institutions in the System; however, each component institution is maintained as a separate and distinct university.

The Board consists of a chair, , secretary, and seven other members, including one student who serves a one-year term as regent. Every two years, the Governor of Texas, subject to the confirmation of the Texas Senate, appoints three members to the board of regents. Every member except for the student regent serves a six-year term. Responsibilities for members are specifically listed in the bylaws of the board of regents.

The chairman of the board of regents is Tilman J. Fertitta, CEO of Landry&#x27;s, Inc. Fertitta attended the University of Houston, and was a student in the Hilton College. He was appointed to the board in 2009, and will serve through August 31, 2027—having been reappointed for an additional six-year term. 
===Administration===

The chancellor is the chief executive officer of the University of Houston System. The chancellor, appointed by the System&#x27;s board of regents, has certain authorities that are specified in the regent bylaws. The chancellor has the option to delegate responsibilities to others such as the vice-chancellor, university presidents, and university athletic directors. Such delegations are subject to the board of regents bylaws and UH System policies.

Since 1997, the UH System chancellor has been serving concurrently as the President of the University of Houston. Thus, the chancellor holds a dual role. As of January 2008, Renu Khator has been the chancellor of UH System and president of the University of Houston. The administration of the System is located in the Ezekiel W. Cullen Building on the campus of the University of Houston.

The Chancellor&#x27;s official residence is known as the &quot;Wortham House.&quot; The house was designed by Alfred C. Finn, and built by Frank P. Sterling in 1925 as the &quot;Sterling House.&quot; In 1948, the house was donated to the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and later sold to Gus and Lyndall Wortham in 1951. Upon her death in July 1980, Lyndall Wortham donated the property to the University of Houston. The house, located in the Houston neighborhood of Southampton, serves as a facility for small functions or gatherings of the UH System.
==Component institutions==
At present, the University of Houston System is self described as a &quot;four-university organization&quot; consisting of the campuses listed below. These campuses are under the control of the board of regents and chancellor. Each institution is a stand-alone university, confers its own degrees, and maintain additional instruction sites within the Houston Metropolitan area. 
 
===Off campus branches===
Each university has additional instruction sites that make education accessible to the greater population of Houston. Each are degree-granting, and students have the same status as other University of Houston students. The following are schools and their respective off campus branches:

University of Houston
* UH at Sugar Land
* UH at Katy

<doc id="1100564" wikidata="Q3806738" url="?curid=1100564" title="James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine">
<text>James Taylor and the Original Flying Machine is an archival release of 1966 recordings of American singer-songwriter James Taylor&#x27;s band The Flying Machine (not to be confused with The Flying Machine of &quot;Smile a Little Smile for Me&quot; fame from 1969), first released in February 1971.

==History==
The songs on the album were recorded with Taylor&#x27;s band The Flying Machine in a late 1966 three-hour session in New York City&#x27;s Select Sound Studios. They were produced by Chip Taylor, who had been involved in some recent pop hits, and Al Gorgoni, who also added harpsichord to the band&#x27;s sound. The group felt the resulting tracks were of only demo quality. After &quot;Night Owl&quot; (b/w &quot;Brighten Your Night with My Day&quot;) was released as an unsuccessful single by Jay Gee Records, a subsidiary of Jubilee Records, no work towards an album release went forward.

Taylor subsequently signed with Apple Records, failed commercially again, but then became a huge success with Warner Bros. Records on &quot;Sweet Baby James&quot; in 1970 and &quot;Mud Slide Slim and the Blue Horizon&quot; in 1971. Euphoria Records then released the sessions using the name &quot;The Original Flying Machine&quot;, to distinguish the group from the UK outfit The Flying Machine who had emerged in 1969 with the hit song &quot;Smile a Little Smile for Me&quot;. The released album had modest success capitalizing on Taylor&#x27;s fame, reaching #74 on the U.S. pop albums chart. Flying Machine member Danny Kortchmar was not pleased, saying &quot;The people involved wouldn&#x27;t spring for the money for a whole album of James&#x27; songs [in 1967]. So it seemed terrible years later when the same people put out the &quot;Flying Machine&quot; album of those few sessions.&quot;

The sessions were re-released by Gadfly Records, with additional short intros and two remixes, in 1996.

<doc id="1100577" wikidata="Q184503" url="?curid=1100577" title="Digitigrade">
<text>In terrestrial vertebrates, digitigrade () locomotion is walking or running on the toes (from the Latin &quot;digitus&quot;, &#x27;finger&#x27;, and &quot;gradior&quot;, &#x27;walk&#x27;). A digitigrade animal is one that stands or walks with its toes (phalanges) on the ground, and the rest of its foot lifted. Digitigrades include birds (what many see as bird&#x27;s knees are actually ankles), cats, dogs, and many other mammals, but not plantigrades (such as humans) or unguligrades (such as horses). Digitigrades generally move more quickly than other animals
There are structural differences between the limb anatomy of plantigrades, unguligrades, and digitigrades. Digitigrade and unguligrade animals have relatively long carpals and tarsals, and the bones which correspond to the human ankle are thus set much higher in the limb than in a human. In a digitigrade animal, this effectively lengthens the foot, so much so that what are often thought of as a digitigrade animal&#x27;s &quot;hands&quot; and &quot;feet&quot; correspond to only the human fingers or toes. Digitigrade locomotion is responsible for the distinctive hooked shape of dog legs.

Plantigrade animals, such as humans, normally walk with the soles of their feet on the ground. Unguligrade animals, such as horses and cattle, walk only on the distal-most tips of their digits. Digitigrade animals walk on their distal and intermediate phalanges; more than one segment of the digit makes contact with the ground, either directly (as in birds) or via paw-pads (as in dogs and cats).

==Examples==

* Mesonychidae
* Dinosaurs (digitigrade and semi-digitigrade)
** Birds (except for loons and grebes which are plantigrade)
* Suina (semi-digitigrade)
* Hippopotamidae (semi-digitigrade)
* &quot;Pakicetus&quot;
* &quot;Indohyus&quot;
* Thylacine 
* Felidae
* Hyenas
* Mongooses
* Canidae
* Derived hyaenodonts (range from digitigrade to semidigitigrade: ancestrally plantigrade)
* Elephants (semi-digitigrade)
* Capybaras (semi-digitigrade)
* &quot;Trucidocynodon&quot; (semi-digitigrade at least in the forelimbs)
*Certain primates (including some monkeys and lemurs)

<text>Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians, also known as Afro-Trinbagonians or Black Trinidadians and Tobagonians, are people from Trinidad and Tobago who are of Sub-Saharan African descent, mostly from West Africa. Social interpretations of race in Trinidad and Tobago are often used to dictate who is of West African descent. Mulatto-Creole, Dougla, Blasian, Zambo, Maroon, Pardo, Quadroon, Octoroon or Hexadecaroon (Quintroon) were all racial terms used to measure the amount of West African ancestry someone possessed in Trinidad and Tobago and throughout North American, Latin American and Caribbean history.

Afro-Trinidadians and Tobagonians accounted for 34.22 percent of the population of Trinidad and Tobago according to the 2011 Census. An additional 22.8 percent of Trinidadians described themselves as being multiracial, of whom 7.7 percent were Dougla (mixed African and Indian ethnicity).

The islands of Trinidad and Tobago (united in 1888) have a different racial history. The island of Trinidad is mainly multiracial, while the population of Tobago is primarily what is considered Afro-Tobagonian, which is synonymous with Afro-Trinidadian, with the exception that the people of Tobago are almost exclusively of direct African ancestry. In an effort to bridge the cultural and ethnic split between the two islands, many people choose to be called Trinbagonians as a gesture of unification.

==Origins==

The ultimate origin of most African ancestry in the Americas is in West and Central Africa. The most common ethnic groups of the enslaved Africans in Trinidad and Tobago were Igbo, Kongo, Ibibio, Yoruba and Malinke people. All of these groups, among others, were heavily affected by the Atlantic slave trade. The population census of 1813 shows that among African-born slaves the Igbo were the most numerous.

Around half of Afro-Trinidadians were the descendants of emigrants from other islands of the Caribbean, especially Martinique, Guadeloupe, Saint Vincent and Grenada. Other Afro-Trinidadians trace their ancestry to American slaves recruited to fight for the British in the War of 1812 or from indentured labourers from West Africa.

==History==
In 1498, Christopher Columbus landed on the island of Trinidad, where he encountered the indigenous Taíno people. A while after Columbus&#x27;s landing, Trinidad became a territory of the Spanish Empire. The Spanish enslaved the native population and over time mixed with them, their offspring creating the Mestizo identity. The Mulattos came about after Spain started transporting enslaved Africans to Trinidad in 1517 via the Atlantic slave trade. By the time the African, Mulattoes and Mestizos started intermixing, the Amerindians had become almost nonexistent.

In 1783, the King of Spain passed the Cedula of Population law, which promised free land to Europeans willing to relocate to Trinidad to work. With this law French settlers migrated to Trinidad from the French Antilles to work the sugar cane plantations. They, too, added to the ancestry of Trinidadians, creating the creole identity; Spanish, French and Patois were the languages spoken.

In 1802, Great Britain took over the island and slavery was eventually abolished in 1834. The abolition of slavery led to an influx of indentured servants from places such as China. While some left, many stayed and married into the Trinidadian populace. In 1911, many more Chinese came after the Chinese Revolution.

In the 1840s, European indentured servants began arriving, including the French, Spanish, Germans, Swiss, Portuguese, English, Scottish, Welsh, Cornish, Irish, Corsican, Italians, Dutch, Norwegian and Polish. Over time, many of these settlers married into the families of the freed slaves.

On 30 May 1845, the British transported indentured servants from India to Trinidad. This day is known as Indian Arrival Day. A small portion of the group of Indians also began to racially mix into the Trinidadian populace, their descendants became known as the Dougla people. After the use of indentured servants was abolished 1917, a second group of Indians steadily migrated to Trinidad from India, mostly for business.

==Use of Afro-Trinidadian and Tobagonian==
===Afro-Trinidadian and Tobagonian===
Between 1968 and 1970, the &quot;Black Power Revolution&quot; gained strength in Trinidad and Tobago. The National Joint Action Committee (NJAC) was formed by a group of undergraduates at the St. Augustine Campus of the University of the West Indies. Influenced by people such as Fidel Castro, Stokely Carmichael and Malcolm X. The National Joint Action Committee demonstrated to bring about Black Power and a return to African heritage and African culture.

On 6 April 1970, protester Basil Davis, was killed by the police. This was followed on 13 April by the resignation of A. N. R. Robinson, Member of Parliament for Tobago East. On 18 April, sugar workers went on strike and there was talk of a general strike. In response to this, Williams proclaimed a State of Emergency on 21 April and arrested 15 Black Power leaders. Responding in turn, a portion of the Trinidad Defence Force, led by Raffique Shah and Rex Lassalle, mutinied and took hostages at the army barracks at Teteron. Through the action of the Coast Guard and negotiations between the Government and the rebels, the mutiny was contained and the mutineers surrendered on 25 April. It was around this time that the term Afro-Trinidadian started to be used.

==Culture==
The massive influx of enslaved Africans to Trinidad and Tobago shores that happened in the 19th century was important in shaping the cultural space of Trinidad and Tobago. Afro-Trinidadian culture is immanent within and encapsulates all other cultures. Afro-Trinidadian culture is decisive in steelpan culture, Carnival culture, soca culture, and calypso culture and also helped in many ways to shape.

==Religious groups==

Most Afro-Trinidadian and Tobagonians are Christian, with the largest group being Roman Catholics, Anglicans and (in Tobago) Methodists. Smaller numbers follow Afro-Caribbean syncretic faiths such as the Spiritual Baptist Church and the Rastafari movement. Non-Christians include adherents of Islam, the Orisha-Shango (Yoruba) faith, Afro-American religions, the Baháʼí Faith, Hinduism or are followers of Sai Baba.

<text>The University of Houston–Downtown (UHD) is a public university in Houston, Texas. Established in 1974 as University of Houston–Downtown College (UH–DC), it has a campus that spans in Downtown Houston with a satellite location, UHD–Northwest, inside Lone Star College–University Park. The university is one of four institutions in the University of Houston System.

, UHD enrolled 14,105 students in 4 academic colleges and offers 57 degree programs—45 bachelor&#x27;s and 12 master&#x27;s. Awarding more than 2,700 degrees annually, the university has more than 67,000 alumni.

==History==
The University of Houston–Downtown College was established when the University of Houston acquired the assets of South Texas Junior College at One Main Street on August 6, 1974. On April 26, 1983, Senate Bill 235 (SB 235) changed name of the institution to the University of Houston–Downtown.

The University of Houston–Downtown&#x27;s expansion and physical growth continued in the late 1990s. The Willow Street Pump Station was renovated, and the Commerce Street Building opened, providing a new home for the College of Public Service. In the early 2000s, the Shea Street Building opened as the new home for the College of Business.

UHD celebrated a milestone when it enrolled the first class of MBA students in the College of Business. In 2016, a 26,000-square-foot Welcome Center opened its doors, and the O&#x27;Kane Gallery landed a new home featuring exhibitions for student, faculty, and local and national artists. Dedicated to the health and wellness of the Campus Community, the Wellness &amp; Success Center opens its doors in January 2023.

==Campus==

The UHD campus consists of eight buildings at the north end of Downtown Houston and the south end of Northside, next to the crossing of Interstate 10 and Main Street. The university is located near the site where Houston was founded, Allen&#x27;s Landing. Two of the university&#x27;s buildings—One Main Building (formerly the Merchants and Manufacturers Building) and the Willow Street Pump Station—are listed in the National Register of Historic Places. UHD also offers classes online at three campuses: UHD-Northwest, Lone Star College Kingwood, and Lone Star College CyFair.

In 2020, UHD opened the College of Sciences and Technology building. The new Wellness &amp; Success Center opened its doors on January 17, 2023.

The university is home to the Harry W. O&#x27;Kane Gallery (commonly known as the O&#x27;Kane Gallery, which was established in 1970 by gifts from Harry W. O&#x27;Kane, Mary W. Bingman, and the Humphreys Foundation. The O&#x27;Kane Gallery presents five to six exhibitions that meet the diverse interests of UHD students, faculty, staff, alumni, and campus visitors. Exhibitions in all media provide educational support to various university courses and to nearby schools. The Gallery also functions as a site for university forums, meetings, and receptions. Exhibitions are free and open to the public.

The university once maintained a student dormitory in the former Continental Houston Hotel, located south of the Buffalo Bayou, from 1982 to August 1991; the facility began its use as a hotel in 1961. The students were forced to leave the dormitory the month it closed, and the facility was demolished in 1993. UHD decided to raze the building because the university deemed it more cost effective to do so instead of renovating the facility. The demolition expenses totaled $700,000 while the renovation would have been $8,000,000. Initially the area was to be used for parking cars while a student center was to be later established there.

The UHD campus is served by METRORail&#x27;s UH–Downtown station on the Red Line.

<doc id="1100585" wikidata="Q17097974" url="?curid=1100585" title="Furrlough">
<text>Furrlough is a furry comic book originally published by Antarctic Press and continued by Radio Comix. It is edited by Elin Winkler and is nicknamed (dubbed) &quot;Your Funny Animal Anthology&quot;.

First published in 1991, &quot;Furrlough&quot; originally featured military-themed comic book stories with anthropomorphic characters. But as more issues were published, the comic expanded to also include action, adventure, fantasy and sci-fi stories as well. In 1997, Antarctic Press underwent a restructuring in an attempt to focus on more mainstream comics, and in the process several comic books were dropped, including &quot;Furrlough&quot; and its sister title, &quot;Genus&quot;. However, these books were still popular and profitable, so two former Antarctic Press employees decided to continue publishing them under a brand-new comic company, Radio Comix.

Radio Comix began publishing &quot;Furrlough&quot; with issue #52 in April 1997, and was published monthly until early 2008 when the frequency of publication began to vary. As of February 2013, 192 issues have been published (not including spin-offs), with several hundred contributors appearing over the years (with 187 writers &amp; artists in the first 99 issues).

The first full-color issue of Furrlough, &quot;Furrlough Color Special&quot; #1, arrived in comic book shops on June 17, 2009. The first square-bound issue of Furrlough, Furrlough #190, arrived in comic book shops on September 9, 2010.

The most popular stories to appear in &quot;Furrlough&quot; (as voted by its readers) include: &quot;Full Knight Gear&quot; by Michael Vega, &quot;Heebas&quot; by Scotty Arsenault, &quot;The Otters&quot; by Scott Mills, &quot;Stosstrupp&quot; by Ted Sheppard, and &quot;Tall Tails&quot; by Daphne Lage.

The first issue&#x27;s most notable stories was the first appearance of Joe Rosales&#x27; Romanics and Ted Sheppard&#x27;s Stosstrupp, which both are among the most popular in Furrlough&#x27;s Top 100 stories. Romanics stories were published in Furrlough over the years including &quot;Best of Furrlough&quot; volume 1 and &quot;Furrlough&#x27;s Finest&quot; #1.

&quot;Stosstrupp&quot; was published in its own publication (&quot;Stosstrupp Review&quot;). This was something which would happen to several stories appearing in &quot;Furrlough&quot;, including &quot;Collars and Cuffs&quot;, &quot;Guardian Knights&quot; (published by Limelight), &quot;Here Comes a Candle&quot; (Shanda Fantasy Arts), &quot;Misty the Mouse&quot; (Shanda) and &quot;Zaibatsu Tears&quot; (Limelight).

In July 2023, it was announced on Twitter that Antarctic Press would be taking over and resuming the publication of the comic from Radio Comix.

<doc id="1100593" wikidata="Q5368985" url="?curid=1100593" title="Emancipation Day">
<text>Emancipation Day is observed in many former European colonies in the Caribbean and areas of the United States on various dates to commemorate the emancipation of slaves of African descent.

In much of the formerly British territories in the Caribbean Emancipation Day is marked on 1 August, commemorating the anniversary of the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. On 1 August 1985, Trinidad and Tobago became the first independent country to declare Emancipation Day as a public holiday to commemorate the abolition of slavery. Historically, 1 August was known as West Indian Emancipation Day and it became a key mobilisation tool and holiday for the antislavery movement in the United States.

It is also observed in other areas in regard to the abolition of other forms of involuntary servitude.

==Trinidad and Tobago==
On 1 August 1985, Trinidad and Tobago, as an independent country, became the first former British territory to declare a national holiday to commemorate the abolition of slavery.

In Trinidad and Tobago, Emancipation Day replaced Columbus Discovery Day, which commemorated the arrival of Christopher Columbus at Moruga on 31 July 1498, as a national public holiday.

The commemoration begins the night before with an all-night vigil and includes religious services, cultural events, street processions past historic landmarks, addresses from dignitaries including an address from the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago and ends with an evening of shows that include a torchlight procession to the national stadium.

==August 1==

The Slavery Abolition Act 1833, which abolished slavery throughout the British Empire (with the exceptions &quot;of the Territories in the Possession of the East India Company&quot;, the &quot;Island of Ceylon&quot; and &quot;the Island of Saint Helena&quot;; the exceptions were eliminated in 1843), came into force the following year, on 1 August 1834.

The legislation only freed slaves below the age of six. Enslaved people older than six years of age were redesignated as &quot;apprentices&quot; and required to work, 40 hours per week without pay, as part of compensation payment to their former owners. Full emancipation was finally achieved at midnight on 31 July 1838.

The holiday is known as August Monday in Guyana, Dominica, The Bahamas, The Virgin Islands, and Saint Lucia, among other territories, as it&#x27;s commemorated on the first Monday in August.

===Antigua and Barbuda===
Antigua and Barbuda celebrates carnival on and around the first Monday of August. Since 1834 Antigua and Barbuda have observed the end of slavery. The first Monday and Tuesday in August was observed as a bank holiday so the populace can celebrate Emancipation Day. Monday is J&#x27;ouvert, a street party that mimics the early morning emancipation.

===Anguilla===
Anguilla: In addition to commemorating emancipation, it is the first day of &quot;August Week&quot;, the Anguillian Carnival celebrations. J&#x27;ouvert is celebrated 1 August, as Carnival commences.

===The Bahamas===
The Bahamas: Celebrations are mainly concentrated in Fox Hill Village, Nassau, a former slave village whose inhabitants, according to folklore, heard about their freedom a week after everyone else on the island.

Emancipation Day is marked by the Cup Match, a two-day public holiday and cricket match, played by residents of the island, is unique to Bermuda. Cup Match started when members of Friendly Societies and Lodges in Somerset in the west and St. George&#x27;s Parish, in the east, gathered to mark the anniversary of the abolition of slavery. In 1902 a silver cup was introduced to the tournament, and that year the first official Cup Match cricket match was played on 12 June 1902. In the Public Holidays Act 1947 national public holidays were introduced on the Thursday and Friday before the first Monday in August, they were named Cup Match Day and Somers Day (named after George Somers, the founder of Bermuda). 
In 1999 Cup Match Day was renamed Emancipation Day, and Somers Day was renamed Mary Prince Day in February 2020 to remember Bermudan writer and enslaved woman Mary Prince.

===British Virgin Islands===
British Virgin Islands: The first Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday of August are celebrated as &quot;August Festival&quot;.

===Canada===
In March 2021, the Canadian House of Commons voted unanimously on a motion to recognize 1 August as Emancipation Day across Canada. However, African-Canadian communities have commemorated Emancipation Day since the 1800s, most notably Black communities in the towns of Windsor, Owen Sound, Amherstburg, and Sandwich, in Ontario, and provinces including New Brunswick and Nova Scotia.

The first of August marks the day the Slavery Abolition Act 1833 ended slavery in the British Empire in 1834 and, thus, also in Canada. However, the first colony in the British Empire to have anti-slavery legislation was Upper Canada, now Ontario. John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada, passed the 1793 Act Against Slavery, banning the importation of slaves and mandating that children born to enslaved women would be enslaved until they were 25 years old, as opposed to in perpetuity. This was the first jurisdiction in the British Empire to abolish the slave trade and limit slavery. The Act Against Slavery was superseded by the Slavery Abolition Act.

In 2022, the celebrations of Emancipation Day in Canada were declared a National Historic Event by Parks Canada.

====Nova Scotia====
Emancipation Day was set on 1 August by the Legislative Assembly of Nova Scotia on 13 April 2021. The event is marked with a provincial ceremony, as well as community-led events. Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia Arthur LeBlanc said in 2022, &quot;as a province, we come together to renew our commitment to equity, peace, and dignity for all. We continue to structure our institutions and communities around the value of inclusion so that past harms are not repeated.&quot; The province also recognizes 23 August as the International Day for the Remembrance of the Slave Trade and its Abolition, in recognition of people of African descent in Haiti and the Dominican Republic fighting for their freedom in 1791.

====Ontario====

In 2008, the provincial legislature designated 1 August as &quot;Emancipation Day&quot;. The act of parliament stated in its preamble: &quot;it is important to recognize the heritage of Ontario’s Black community and the contributions that it has made and continues to make to Ontario. It is also important to recall the ongoing international struggle for human rights and freedom from repression for persons of all races, which can be best personified by Lieutenant Governor John Graves Simcoe and Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Accordingly, it is appropriate to recognize 1 August formally as Emancipation Day and to celebrate it.&quot;

Notable Emancipation Day commemoriation include The Big Picnic, organised by the Toronto Division of the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA), which attracted thousands of attendees from the 1920s through to the 1950s. The first The Big Picnic was held in 1924, at Lakeside Park, in the community of Port Dalhousie.

In 1932, the first Emancipation Day Parade was held in Windsor and would come to be known as the &quot;greatest freedom show on Earth&quot;. Organized by Walter Perry, the parade and festival boasted famous guests like Martin Luther King Jr, Mary McLeod Bethune, Stevie Wonder, Benjamin Mays, Fred Shuttlesworth, Martha Reeves and The Vandellas, and Eleanor Roosevelt. Though Perry&#x27;s death in 1968 had a significant influence on the end of the tradition, fears over the Detroit Riot of 1967 caused the city&#x27;s councillors to deny organizers necessary permits to stage an Emancipation Day celebration. Owen Sound has celebrated Emancipation with a picnic for 157 years, and now holds an Emancipation Festival.

Toronto hosts the Toronto Caribbean Carnival (known as Caribana until 2006), which is held the first Saturday in August of Civic Holiday, observed on the first Monday of August. Started in 1967, it is a two-week celebration culminating in the long weekend, with the Kings and Queens Festival, Caribana parade, and Olympic Island activities.

===Jamaica===

1 August, Emancipation Day in Jamaica is a public holiday and part of a week-long cultural celebration, during which Jamaicans also celebrate Jamaica Independence Day on 6 August 1962. Both 1 August and 6 August are public holidays.

Emancipation Day had stopped being observed as a nation holiday in 1962 at the time of independence. It was reinstated as a national public holiday under The Holidays (Public General) Act 1998 after a six-year campaign led by Rex Nettleford, among others.

Traditionally people would keep at vigil on 31 July and at midnight ring church bell and play drums in parks and public squares to re-enact the first moments of freedom for enslaved Africans. On Emancipation Day there is a reenactment of the reading of the Emancipation Declaration in town centres especially Spanish Town which was the seat of the Jamaican government when the Emancipation Act was passed in 1838.

Emancipation Park, a public park in Kingston, opened on the eve of Emancipation Day, 31 July in 2002, is named in commemoration of Emancipation Day.

===Saint Kitts and Nevis===

===Saint Vincent and the Grenadines===
Saint Vincent and the Grenadines also celebrates Emmancipation day annually on August 1.

The Act for the Abolition of Slavery in St. Vincent was transmitted to Britain on May 28, 1834. On the first of August in the year 1834, a total of 18,102 individuals who were previously enslaved transitioned into the status of apprentices.

A total of 2,959 children under the age of six were promptly released, along with 1,189 individuals who were either elderly or physically unable to care for themselves.

The enslaved individuals residing on the island of St. Vincent (SVG) were granted “complete emancipation” on August 1, 1838, following a period of “partial freedom” that was initially granted to them in 1834 through the enactment of the Abolition Act.
=== South Africa ===
The Slavery Abolition Act 1833 came into full effect in the Cape Colony on the 1 December 1838, after a four-year period of forced apprenticeship. About 39,000 enslaved people were freed and £1.2 million (roughly equivalent to £4,175,000,000 as a proportion of GDP in 2016 pounds) – of £3 million originally set aside by the British government – was paid out in compensation to 1,300 former slave holding farmers in the colony.

1 December is celebrated as Emancipation Day in South Africa most notably in the city of Cape Town.

== Suriname and the Dutch Caribbean – July 1 ==
On 1 July 1863, slavery was abolished in the colonies of Kingdom of the Netherlands, which included Suriname and the Caribbean islands of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Saba, Sint Eustatius, and Bonaire (known today as the Dutch Caribbean). However, much of the enslaved population had to continue working on the plantations for an additional 10 years in order to mitigate the &quot;loss caused by this measure&quot; to the plantation owners. Today, 1 July is an official holiday in Suriname and Sint Eustatius, but not anywhere else in the Kingdom of the Netherlands. 

=== Suriname ===

On 1 July, Keti Koti (Sranantongo: &quot;the chain is cut&quot; or &quot;the chain is broken&quot;) is celebrated that marks Emancipation Day in Suriname, a former colony of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. It marks the date when slavery was abolished in Suriname in 1863. The day also remembers that enslaved people in Suriname would not be fully free until 1873, after a mandatory 10-year transition period during which time they were required to work on the plantations for minimal pay and with state sanctioned force. On 1 July 1955, Keti Koti officially became a public holiday in Suriname.

=== Dutch Caribbean ===
The islands of the Dutch Caribbean commemorate emancipation on July 1.

* On Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Saba, and Bonaire, Emancipation Day is commemorated on 1 July, but it is not an official public holiday. On Saba, Emancipation Day is a civil servant holiday (i.e., all government offices are closed).
* On Sint Eustatius, Emancipation Day is commemorated on 1 July as an official public holiday. In January 2021, Island Council of St. Eustatius voted to replace Carnival Monday with Emancipation Day a public holiday.

==French West Indies==
This includes eight territories currently under French sovereignty in the Antilles islands of the Caribbean:

*Martinique commemorates emancipation with a national holiday on 22 May, marking the slave resistance on that day in 1848 that forced Governor Claude Rostoland to issue a decree abolishing slavery.
*Guadeloupe commemorates emancipation on 27 May.
*Saint Martin has a week-long celebration around 27 May, commemorating the abolition of slavery.

== Central America ==

Corn Island received its emancipation on 27 August 1841.

==United States==
=== District of Columbia – 16 April ===
The District of Columbia observes 16 April as Emancipation Day. On 16 April 1862, President Abraham Lincoln signed the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act, an act of Compensated emancipation, for the release of certain persons held to service or labor in the District of Columbia. The Act, introduced by Massachusetts senator and ardent abolitionist Henry Wilson, freed about 3,100 slaves in the District of Columbia nine months before President Lincoln issued his broader Emancipation Proclamation. The District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act represents the only example of compensation by the federal government to former owners of emancipated slaves.

On 4 January 2005, Mayor Anthony A. Williams signed legislation making Emancipation Day an official public holiday in the District. Although Emancipation Day occurs on 16 April, by law when 16 April falls during a weekend, Emancipation Day is observed on the nearest weekday. This affects the Internal Revenue Service&#x27;s due date for tax returns, which traditionally must be submitted by 15 April. As the federal government observes the holiday, it causes the federal and all state tax deadlines to be moved to 18 April if Emancipation Day falls on a Saturday or Sunday and to 17 April if Emancipation Day falls on a Monday. Each year, activities are now held during this observed holiday, including the traditional Emancipation Day parade. The parade had taken place yearly from 1866 to 1901. After a 101-year hiatus, DC&#x27;s parade resumed in 2002, just three years ahead of the new holiday.

===Florida – 20 May===
The state of Florida observes emancipation in a ceremonial day on 20 May. In the capital, Tallahassee, Civil War re-enactors playing the part of Major General Edward McCook and other union soldiers act out the speech General McCook gave from the steps of the Knott House on 20 May 1865. This was the first reading of the Emancipation Proclamation in Florida.

===Georgia – Saturday closest to 29 May===

Thomaston, Georgia, has been the site of an Emancipation Day celebration since May 1866. Organizers believe it is &quot;the oldest, continuously observed annual emancipation event in the United States.&quot; The annual event is scheduled for the Saturday closest to 29 May. William Guilford was an early organizer of the event first held in 1866.

=== Kentucky and Tennessee – 8 August ===
Emancipation Day is celebrated on 8 August in Hopkinsville, Christian County; Paducah, McCracken County; and Russellville, Logan County Kentucky, as well as other communities in western Kentucky and for many years in Southern Illinois in Hardin County. According to the &quot;Paducah Sun&quot; newspaper, this is the anniversary of the day slaves in this region learned of their freedom in 1865. According to a PBS documentary, it celebrates the liberation of the people enslaved by U.S. President Andrew Johnson, one of whom started the annual celebration in eastern Tennessee.

In 1938, William A. Johnson, who was born enslaved to Andrew Johnson in 1858, spoke at a Tennessee Emancipation Day celebration at Chilhowee Park.

=== Maryland – 1 November ===
Emancipation Day is celebrated in Maryland on 1 November. Maryland started officially recognizing Emancipation Day in 2013, when then-Governor Martin O’Malley signed a measure to celebrate the freeing of slaves in Maryland on 1 November . Slavery was abolished in Maryland just six months before the end of the Civil War. Maryland&#x27;s slavery abolishment also was approved two months before the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s 13th Amendment was passed by Congress, and a full year before the 13th Amendment was ratified.

On 1 November 2020, Maryland Governor Larry Hogan issued a proclamation recognizing Maryland Emancipation Day. &quot;156 years ago, a new state constitution abolished slavery in Maryland. I have issued a proclamation recognizing Maryland Emancipation Day as we reflect on the legacies of the brave Marylanders who risked everything so that they and others might enjoy the promise of freedom.&quot;

On 30 October 2020, Montgomery County Executive Marc Elrich and County Council President Sidney Katz, on behalf of the entire Council, presented a joint proclamation Friday proclaiming Sunday, 1 November, as “Emancipation Day” in Montgomery County.

=== Massachusetts - 8 July ===

Massachusetts Emancipation Day, also known as Quock Walker Day, was established by the state legislature in 2022 and first legally observed statewide in 2023. It was observed in the town of Lexington starting in 2020. The observance commemorates the 1783 decision in the freedom suit of Quock Walker, which found slavery to be an unenforceable legal arrangement under the 1780 Massachusetts Constitution. Massachusetts became the first state to record zero slaves in the federal census of 1790, as slavery was abandoned in favor of indentured servitude or paid employment.

===Mississippi – 8 May===

In Columbus, Mississippi, Emancipation Day is celebrated on 8 May, known locally as &quot;Eight o&#x27; May&quot;. As in other southern states, the local celebration commemorates the date in 1865 when African Americans in eastern Mississippi learned of their freedom.

Though the 13th amendment was ratified by the necessary three-quarters vote, Mississippi withheld its ratification document after the constitutional amendment was submitted to the states. Mississippi finally submitted the ratification document on 7 February 2013.

===Texas – 19 June===
In Texas, Emancipation Day is celebrated on 19 June. It commemorates the announcement in Texas of the abolition of slavery made on that day in 1865 in Galvaston, Texas. It is commonly known as Juneteenth. Since the late 20th century, this date has gained recognition beyond Texas, and became a federal holiday in 2021. Celebratory traditions often include readings of the Emancipation Proclamation, singing traditional songs, rodeos, street fairs, family reunions, cookouts, park parties, historical reenactments, and Miss Juneteenth contests.

===Virginia – 3 April===

In Richmond, Virginia, 3 April is commemorated as Emancipation Day. 3 April marks the day, in 1865, that Richmond fell to the Union Army, who were led by the United States Colored Troops.

====US Virgin Islands – 3 July====
The United States Virgin Islands celebrates V.I. Emancipation Day (Danish West Indies Emancipation Day) as an official holiday on 3 July. It commemorates the Danish Governor Peter von Scholten&#x27;s 1848 proclamation that &quot;all unfree in the Danish West Indies are from today emancipated,&quot; following a slave rebellion led by John Gottlieb (Moses Gottlieb, General Buddhoe) in Frederiksted, Saint Croix.

In addition to recognizing Emancipation Day, since 2017 the full week leading up to 3 July has been recognized as Virgin Islands Freedom Week. Emancipation Day, Freedom Week, and the culmination of St. John Festival are celebrated throughout the U.S. Virgin Islands with concerts, dancing, workshops, a historical skit, and a reenactment of the walk to Fort Frederik.

<doc id="1100595" wikidata="Q4093696" url="?curid=1100595" title="Titanium diboride">
<text>Titanium diboride (TiB2) is an extremely hard ceramic which has excellent heat conductivity, oxidation stability and wear resistance. TiB2 is also a reasonable electrical conductor, so it can be used as a cathode material in aluminium smelting and can be shaped by electrical discharge machining.

==Physical properties==
TiB2 shares some properties with boron carbide and titanium carbide, but many of its properties are superior to those of B4C &amp; TiC:

===Exceptional hardness at extreme temperature===
*2nd hardest material at 3000°C (diamond)
*3rd hardest material at 2800°C (cBN)
*4th hardest material at 2100°C (B4C)
*5th hardest material at 1000°C (B6O)

===Advantages over other borides===
*Highest boride elastic modulus
*Highest boride fracture toughness
*Highest boride compressive strength
*3rd highest boride melting point (3230 °C) (HfB2)

===Other advantages===
*High thermal conductivity (60-120 W/(m K)),
*High electrical conductivity (~105 S/cm)

===Drawbacks===
* Difficult to mold due to high melting temperature
* Difficult to sinter due to the high covalent bonding
* Limited to pressing to small Monolithic pieces using of spark plasma sintering

==Chemical properties==
With respect to chemical stability, TiB2 is more stable in contact with pure iron than tungsten carbide or silicon nitride.

TiB2 is resistant to oxidation in air at temperatures up to 1100 °C, and to hydrochloric and hydrofluoric acids, but reacts with alkalis, nitric acid and sulfuric acid.

==Production==

TiB2 does not occur naturally in the earth. Titanium diboride powder can be prepared by a variety of high-temperature methods, such as the direct reactions of titanium or its oxides/hydrides, with elemental boron over 1000 °C, carbothermal reduction by thermite reaction of titanium oxide and boron oxide, or hydrogen reduction of boron halides in the presence of the metal or its halides. Among various synthesis routes, electrochemical synthesis and solid state reactions have been developed to prepare finer titanium diboride in large quantity. An example of solid state reaction is the borothermic reduction, which can be illustrated by the following reactions:

(1) 2 TiO2 + B4C + 3C → 2 TiB2 + 4 CO

(2) TiO2 + 3NaBH4 → TiB2 + 2Na(g,l) + NaBO2 + 6H2(g)

The first synthesis route (1), however, cannot produce nanosized powders. Nanocrystalline (5–100 nm) TiB2 was synthesized using the reaction (2) or the following techniques: 
* Solution phase reaction of NaBH4 and TiCl4, followed by annealing the amorphous precursor obtained at 900–1100 °C.
*Mechanical alloying of a mixture of elemental Ti and B powders.
*Self-propagating high-temperature synthesis process involving addition of varying amounts of NaCl.
*Milling assisted self-propagating high-temperature synthesis (MA-SHS).
*Solvothermal reaction in benzene of metallic sodium with amorphous boron powder and TiCl4 at 400 °C:
::TiCl4 + 2 B + 4 Na → TiB2 + 4 NaCl

Many TiB2 applications are inhibited by economic factors, particularly the costs of densifying a high melting point material - the melting point is about 2970 °C, and, thanks to a layer of titanium dioxide that forms on the surface of the particles of a powder, it is very resistant to sintering. Admixture of about 10% silicon nitride facilitates the sintering, though sintering without silicon nitride has been demonstrated as well.

Thin films of TiB2 can be produced by several techniques. The electroplating of TiB2 layers possess two main advantages compared with physical vapor deposition or chemical vapor deposition: the growing rate of the layer is 200 times higher (up to 5 μm/s) and the inconveniences of covering complex shaped products are dramatically reduced.

==Potential applications==
Current use of TiB2 appears to be limited to specialized applications in such areas as impact resistant armor, cutting tools, crucibles, neutron absorbers and wear resistant coatings.

TiB2 is extensively used for evaporation boats for vapour coating of aluminium. It is an attractive material for the aluminium industry as an inoculant to refine the grain size when casting aluminium alloys, because of its wettability by and low solubility in molten aluminium and good electrical conductivity.

Thin films of TiB2 can be used to provide wear and corrosion resistance to a cheap and/or tough substrate.

<text>Australian coins refers to the coins which are or were in use as Australian currency. During the early days of the colonies that formed Australia, foreign as well as British currency was used, but in 1910, a decade after federation, Australian coins were introduced. Australia used pounds, shillings and pence until 1966, when it adopted the decimal system with the Australian dollar divided into 100 cents.

For many years after the first Australian colony, New South Wales (NSW), was founded in 1788, it did not have its own currency and had to rely on the coins of other countries. During the early days of the colony, commodities such as wheat were sometimes used as a currency because of the shortage of coins. Also many transactions were carried out using promissory notes or a barter system, which included trafficking in alcohol, known as &#x27;rum currency&#x27;, a system disbanded when Macquarie became governor on 1 January 1810.

Spanish dollars were sometimes cut into &quot;pieces of eight&quot;, quarters, and then into 2/3 and 1/3 segments, with the 2/3 segments (1/6 of original coin) being &quot;shillings&quot; and the 1/3 segments (1/12 of original coin) &quot;sixpences&quot; In 1791 Governor Phillip of New South Wales fixed the value of the Spanish dollar to equal five shillings.

Under the decree of 19 November 1800 by the governor Philip Gidley King, the following eleven coins were legal tender for the exchange value of:
*Gold Johanna (Portugal coin of 12800 Reis) = £4/0/- (four pounds)
*Gold Half Johanna (Portugal coin of 6400 Reis) = £2/0/- (two pounds
*Guinea = £1/2/- (One pound and two shillings)
*Gold Mohur = £1/17/6 (one pound, 17 shillings and sixpence).
*Spanish dollar = 5 shillings.
*Ducat = 9/6 (9 shillings 6 pence).
*Rupee = 2/6 (2 shillings and 6 pence).
*Pagoda = 8/- (8 shillings). .
*Dutch Guilder = 2/- (2 shillings).
*English shilling = 1/1 (1 shilling and 1 penny).
*Copper coin of 1 oz = 2 pence.

The settlers did have some George III one-penny coins, which were referred to as &quot;Cartwheel pennies&quot;. These were the first British coins to be officially exported to the Australian colonies, and so can be considered Australia&#x27;s first official coins. They were dated 1797 and 1799, with Britannia on one side and King George III on the other.

In 1812, Governor Lachlan Macquarie of New South Wales bought Spanish dollar coins, following the arrival of the ship &quot;Samarang&quot; at Port Jackson with 40,000 Spanish dollars, paying four shillings and nine pence for each dollar. He was worried that the coins would quickly be exported out of the colony and had holes cut in the middle of them to try to keep them in Australia. These were known as Holey dollars (valued at five shillings), with the piece from the middle being called the Dump (valued at around 15 pence). Both were declared legal currency on 30 September 1813 and went into circulation in 1814.

British currency became the official currency of the Australian colonies after 1825, with almost £100,000-worth of British coins being imported during 1824–25. The Holey dollar was no longer legal tender after 1829. The most notable Holey Dollar was the &quot;Hannibal Head&quot; a one of a kind coin that features the portrait of King Joseph I of Spain. The Hannibal Head sold at auction in 2018 to a private collector for $500,000.

==Gold coins and Sovereigns==

Unofficial gold coins were used during the gold rush of the 1850s. Traders&#x27; tokens were also used because of the shortage of coins caused by the large increase in population. Requests to make gold coins in Adelaide in 1852 to compensate for the shortage of coins were rejected by Britain after 25,000 One Pound pieces were struck.

Australia&#x27;s first official mint was in Sydney, founded in 1855. It produced gold coins with an original design between 1855 and 1870, with &quot;Sydney Mint, Australia, One Sovereign&quot; on one side and Queen Victoria on the other, or &quot;Sydney Mint, Australia, Half Sovereign&quot;, before starting in 1870 to mint gold coins of British design. One gold sovereign equalled £1.

==The pound==

Federation in 1901 gave the Commonwealth a constitutional power to issue coins and removed this power from the States. British coins continued in use until 1910, when Australian silver coins were introduced. These included florins, shillings, sixpences and threepences. They had a portrait of King Edward VII on one side. Australian pennies and half-pennies were introduced into circulation the following year. In 1931 gold sovereigns stopped being minted in Australia. A crown or five-shilling coin was minted in 1937 and 1938.

==The dollar==
The Australian dollar replaced the Australian pound on 14 February 1966 as part of the decimalisation process. At this time, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cent coins were issued. $1 coins were first issued in 1984, and $2 coins soon followed in 1988. The one- and two-cent coins were discontinued in 1990 and withdrawn from circulation in February 1992.

<doc id="1100615" wikidata="Q361357" url="?curid=1100615" title="Tiberius Julius Alexander">
<text>Tiberius Julius Alexander (fl. 1st century) was an equestrian governor and general in the Roman Empire. Born into a wealthy Jewish family of Alexandria but abandoning or neglecting the Jewish religion, he rose to become the 2nd procurator of Judea (&quot;c.&quot; 46 – 48) under Claudius. While Prefect of Egypt (66–69), he employed his legions against the Alexandrian Jews in a brutal response to ethnic violence, and was instrumental in the Emperor Vespasian&#x27;s rise to power. In 70, he participated in the Siege of Jerusalem as Titus&#x27; second-in-command. He became the most powerful Jew of his age, and is ranked as one of the most prominent Jews in military history.

==Early life==
Tiberius Julius Alexander was probably born early in the reign of the Emperor Tiberius (14–37). His father was Alexander, an Alexandrian Jew who held the office of Alabarch as head of customs on the Arabian frontier, but it may have denoted a senior customs official. The family of the older Alexander, a member of the Egyptian gentry, had Roman citizenship, something not infrequent among the wealthy Jews of Alexandria. He also had business connections both with Agrippa, grandson of Herod the Great, and with Antonia, mother of the emperor Claudius. Another prominent member of Tiberius Alexander&#x27;s family was his uncle, the philosopher Philo.

With both Tiberius and his younger brother Marcus Julius Alexander, the father preferred to give them a grounding in classical languages, rather than have them receive a traditional Jewish education, and both had been groomed to enter into the Roman bureaucracy Marcus Julius Alexander was the first husband of Herodian Princess Berenice. Marcus died in 43 or 44, leaving no children. The Jewish historian Josephus introduces his portrait of Tiberius by condemning him for impiety, explaining that he &quot;did not remain in his ancestral customs&quot;. This has traditionally been taken to mean that he became an apostate from Judaism at an early age, a view which finds some support in his appearance as a character in two of Philo&#x27;s philosophical dialogues, making arguments against divine providence which Philo attempts to refute. However, some more recent scholars believe that Josephus is criticizing Alexander simply for his decision to take up the service of Rome, placing the interests of the Empire above the Jewish religion.

He nevertheless continued to benefit from his family&#x27;s connections, which were enhanced after the Emperor Claudius came to power in 41. Agrippa had helped to secure Claudius&#x27; accession after the assassination of Caligula, and was appointed king of Judea. Tiberius&#x27; father, who had been imprisoned by Caligula, was released on Claudius&#x27; orders, and it was at this time that his younger brother Marcus became Berenice&#x27;s husband. Tiberius&#x27;s first senior appointment was as governor of the Thebaid in 42 CE.

==Career until 63==
Tiberius Alexander was evidently well enough connected for an equestrian career in Roman public life. The first position he is known to have held, beginning in about 42, was that of &quot;epistrategus&quot; of the Thebaid, one of the three regions into which the Roman province of Egypt was divided. This was an administrative and judicial post involving no military command. He may have perhaps maintained contacts with his brother Marcus, who was trading in the same area until his premature death in 43 or 44.

In recognition of his administrative abilities in the Thebaid after four years of service there, Claudius appointed him procurator of Judea in 46 CE. The province had returned to direct Roman rule only after the death of Agrippa in 44, and from the tenure of Alexander&#x27;s predecessor Cuspius Fadus it had been a hotbed of zealot nationalism. Despite the opinion of some fellow Jews that he was a turncoat, his period of office as Procurator in Judea was marked by peace, as Josephus himself writes. He did condemn James and Simon, sons of an earlier rebel named Judas of Galilee, to crucifixion. It was also at this time that Judea was afflicted by a severe famine. In 48 he was succeeded by Ventidius Cumanus.

Alexander appears to have risen in the ranks – though the details are unknown, until, with the reign of Nero, he served as a staff officer under the prominent general Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo during campaigns against Parthia, under whom he distinguished himself. In 63 he was dispatched along with Corbulo&#x27;s son-in-law to escort the Armenian king Tiridates, with whom he himself had initiated negotiations, to the Roman camp, on the first stage of his journey to receive the status of client king from Nero.

==Prefecture of Egypt==
In May 66, after Corbulo had backed him, Nero appointed Alexander Prefect of Egypt, one of the two most prestigious posts available to an equestrian along with Prefect of the Praetorian Guard. Alexander may have benefitted from a philhellenic tendency in equestrian appointments under Nero, but his experience of Egypt must also have commended him. The year he assumed office saw the outbreak of the First Jewish–Roman War in Judea, and aggression inevitably spilled over into the large Jewish community of Alexandria. An outbreak of ethnic violence during a Greek assembly escalated when the Greeks took prisoners, leading the Jewish side to threaten to burn the assembled Greeks to death. Alexander sent mediators to calm the Jews, warning he would have to use the Roman legions if violence continued. The threat was ineffective, and Josephus describes the outcome: 

A less violent side to Alexander&#x27;s government is demonstrated by other evidence. Over a century after his time, his administrative decisions were still being cited as precedents. Some of these are known from a surviving edict issued on 6 July 68, less than a month after Nero&#x27;s death. This denounces, and introduces measures against, a variety of abuses including inaccurate tax assessments, malicious prosecutions and the imprisonment of debtors by private creditors. The edict&#x27;s only allusion to the chaotic political situation comes as a call for trust in the benevolence of the new Emperor, Galba, and his ability to put right the wrongs of the past. Alexander was making representations to Galba on behalf of the provincials, presumably representing the desired reforms as the price of loyalty from this vital grain-producing province.

Neither Galba nor his successor Otho survived long in office. In April 69, Vitellius was recognized as Emperor by the Roman Senate, but his opponents were beginning to rally behind Vespasian, commander of the Roman forces conducting the war in Judea. The loyalties of Alexander, who commanded two legions and had control of the grain shipments from Alexandria to Rome, were of crucial importance. Fortunately for Vespasian, Alexander was willing to correspond with him secretly; go-betweens suspected by modern historians include Berenice (soon to be lover of Vespasian&#x27;s son Titus), and an Egyptian official named Basilides. On 1 July Alexander became the first to make a decisive move against Vitellius: on receipt of a letter from Vespasian, he instructed his forces to take the oath of allegiance to Vespasian as Emperor. His lead was followed by legions throughout the eastern Empire, and the anniversary of Vespasian&#x27;s accession was later celebrated on this date.

==Siege of Jerusalem==

Vespasian moved rapidly to Egypt, leaving the Jewish war under the command of Titus. At the same time Alexander, as a proven commander with experience of Jewish affairs, was sent by Vespasian to join Titus as his chief of staff and adviser, second only to Titus himself. The siege of Jerusalem was conducted by four legions, and even after the city walls were overcome, the defenders held out in the Temple. Alexander participated in an initial decision not to destroy the Temple, which would remain an ornament, but to quench the fire. Two subsequent assaults by Jewish forces were repelled, and the survivors retreated to the inner temple. In a sortie, according to Josephus they clashed with the Roman troops tasked with putting the flames out, and one enraged Roman soldier threw a brand into the sanctum, destroying it. Josephus&#x27;s accounts of the sequence of events, and of who was responsible, is highly contradictory, though, as in rabbinic tradition, both this and the earlier destruction of the Temple were due to God&#x27;s will, Nebuchadnezzer and the Romans being but his instruments. 

==Later career==
By this time, Vespasian&#x27;s position in Rome was secure. The details of Alexander&#x27;s career under the new emperor remain unclear. A damaged papyrus refers to Alexander as holding the position of &quot;Praetorian Prefect&quot;, which is open to two interpretations. It could indicate his rank during Titus&#x27; campaign in 70, which would mean that he held his own independent &quot;imperium&quot; (commanding authority). According to another view, it means that he became Prefect of the Praetorian Guard at Rome, which in later years became a common position for former Prefects of Egypt. In either case, Alexander attained a position in the Roman Empire that was unparalleled for a man of Jewish birth, not to mention one who suffered from the further stigma of an Egyptian origin. The xenophobic speaker of Juvenal&#x27;s first &quot;Satire&quot;, composed in the late 1st or early in the 2nd century AD, complains of passing the Forum&#x27;s triumphal statues, &quot;where some Egyptian Arabarch&#x27;s had the nerve to set up his titles. At his image it&#x27;s right to do more than piss!&quot; This is very likely a reference to Alexander.

<text>Mountain Pointe High School is a secondary school located in Ahwatukee, Arizona one of eight public high schools serving the Tempe Union High School District.

== History ==
The Ahwatukee area of Phoenix experienced explosive growth in the 1990s. The Kyrene School District, the elementary school district in the area, opened a string of new schools here at this time, and the Tempe Union High School District followed suit by opening its last two high schools west of I-10. Mountain Pointe was completed by the fall of 1990, but the Tempe Union district could not open it right away due to funding shortfalls. The new, US$27 million facility ($ in dollars) opened to students the following year. The 1,100 students in grades 9 and 10 that attended the school at its start were asked to pick a mascot: an eagle, thunder, rough riders or a pride of lions, which won out. Its rival Desert Vista High School was opened to serve the growing southwestern part of Ahwatukee in 1996. Prior to Mountain Pointe&#x27;s opening, Ahwatukee was part of the service areas of Corona del Sol High School (five miles away from Mountain Pointe and east of the Interstate 10 freeway) and Tempe High School. In the spring of 1994, Mountain Pointe graduated its first graduating class.

Mountain Pointe is the largest high school in Ahwatukee with open boundaries. Many people who live in the 85044 zip code attend Mountain Pointe along with commuters from the South Mountain area. There also are a great number of students from the Maricopa area that attend Mountain Pointe High School. The Tempe Union High School District, which had to redraw boundaries significantly in the early 2000s as Corona del Sol grew over its capacity, also includes significant portions of west Chandler in Mountain Pointe&#x27;s boundaries. While Corona has since shrunk in size, the boundary oddities remain. As of 2021, approximately 51 percent of Mountain Pointe students lived outside of the school&#x27;s boundaries.

== Campus ==
Mountain Pointe is an open boundary school that permits any student to attend. Mountain Pointe enforces a closed-campus policy and has since its inception, in which ninth, tenth, and eleventh graders may not leave campus without an adult checking them out for the day. Seniors are only permitted to leave campus with a special ID which can only be obtained with a signed and notarized parent permission form.

As of the 2009–2010 school year, Mountain Pointe High School now operates on a traditional schedule. This change comes after a ruling in which all six of the Tempe Union district schools did not meet the Arizona standards for required classroom time. The day now consists of five 57 minute classes, one 63 minute homeroom (five extra minutes for announcements), and a 30-minute lunch. A major criticism of traditional schedule is the loss of an academic lab, a 45–minute study hall, which allowed each student to travel to one teacher for extra help. A 40-minute academic lab returned to Mountain Pointe in the fall of 2011.

The football team won the Division I Arizona State Championship by defeating defending champions Chandler Hamilton 42–19 on November 30, 2013.

<text>Country Club Park is a neighborhood in Los Angeles, California.

==History==

The name Country Club Park refers to the area&#x27;s previous use. In 1897, The Los Angeles Golf Club established a 9-hole course called the Windmill Links at Pico and Alvarado Street. Overcrowding inspired the organizers to move west and in 1899, the club moved to the corner of Pico and Western (the area that is now Country Club Park). The course remained there until 1910, at which time it moved to Holmby Hills.

After The Los Angeles Golf Club moved west, Isaac Milbank, with partner George Chase, subdivided the property for mostly large homes and mansions. Country Club Park matured in the 1920s and homes were constructed in the latest architectural styles: Craftsman, Tudor Revival, Spanish Colonial Revival, Colonial Revival and Mediterranean Revival.

In the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Shelley v. Kraemer&quot; (1948) which struck down racial exclusionary covenants, Country Club Park was one of the first affluent neighborhoods in Los Angeles to allow blacks to purchase homes.

In 2010, the neighborhood was designated a Los Angeles Historic Preservation Overlay Zone because of the large number of intact buildings dating back to the earliest phases of Los Angeles’ development.

==Geography==
Country Club Park is bounded by Olympic Boulevard on the north, Crenshaw Boulevard on the west, Pico Boulevard on the south, and Western Avenue on the east. The neighborhood of Arlington Heights is directly south. Wilshire Park is north. Oxford Square is west.

Country Club Park is partially gated; three streets that intersect Pico Boulevard are closed to through-traffic and pedestrians.

==Parks and recreation==

* Country Club Park Heritage Plaza - 1015 South Wilton Place. It has a children&#x27;s play area, picnic tables, and a walking path.

==In Media==

* American Horror Story (pilot episode)

Designed and built in 1902 by Alfred Rosenheim, the president of the American Institute of Architects&#x27; Los Angeles chapter, the Collegiate Gothic-style single family home is located at 1120 Westchester Place. It is known as the Rosenheim Mansion. The home was previously used as a convent. An adjoining chapel was removed from exterior shots using CGI.

After the pilot episode, filming continued on sets constructed to be an exact replica of the house. Details such as Lewis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows, and hammered bronze light fixtures, were re-created to preserve the look of the house.

* Ali
* Daddy Day Care
* Running with Scissors

==Notable residents==
* Joel Fluellen, actor
*Lena Horne, entertainer

<text>Bruce Eugene (born June 20, 1982) is a former American football quarterback who is currently a college football coach. He played college football for and graduated from Grambling State University.

==College career==
Standing six feet (1.83 m) tall, and weighing over 260 lb Eugene was given the nickname &quot;Round Mound of Touchdown&quot;. He was much heavier than the typical quarterback, but proved to be exceptionally quick and agile for a man his size. He was also a very accurate passer, and was rated one of the top players in Division I-AA college football.

Injured in the first game of the 2004 season, Eugene sat out the entire remainder of the year. He received a sixth year of eligibility from the NCAA.

Eugene was a three-time finalist for the coveted Walter Payton Award, which is given annually to I-AA&#x27;s top football player (the equivalent of the Heisman Trophy in Division I-A). In 2003, he threw for 3,805 yards with 34 TD vs 13 INT. He also ran for 412 yards with 6 TD. He followed that up with an amazing performance during the 2005 season throwing for 4,408 yards with 56 TD vs 6 INT while running for an additional 157 yards and 3 TD.

At the NFL combine, Eugene recorded a score of 41 on the Wonderlic test, one of the highest ever.

==Professional career==
Eugene was signed as a free agent by the New Orleans Saints within hours of the conclusion of the 2006 NFL draft. Bruce was released from the Saints on June 15, 2006. After a short stint with the Canadian Football League&#x27;s Saskatchewan Roughriders he signed with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers on January 11, 2007.

Eugene was assigned to the Frankfurt Galaxy of the now-defunct NFL Europa for the 2007 season. Frankfurt Galaxy was at the time the defending World Bowl champion. At the end of training camp, Eugene was released by Frankfurt, then acquired by 3-time World Bowl champions Berlin Thunder, where he replaced third-string quarterback Walter Washington, who was released after camp, and injured back-up Omar Jacobs. He played his first game for Thunder in the 7–16 loss to the Hamburg Sea Devils on April 22, 2007.

==Coaching career==
Eugene moved into coaching, working at different schools in the Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) in New York City. In 2011, he was the quarterbacks coach at Alcorn State University in Lorman, Mississippi. In 2012, he returned to PSAL as the head football coach at High School of Enterprise, Business, &amp; Technology (also known as Grand Street Campus or Grand Street) in Brooklyn, New York.

In 2014, WGNO named him one of the best high school quarterbacks who played in the New Orleans metro in any of the previous 23 years. Eugene was a star quarterback at Walter Cohen High School of New Orleans.

In December 2015, Eugene became the first African-American coach to win the Public Schools Athletic League (PSAL) football city championship at the highest level. His team (Grand Street) defeated Eramus Hall 28–26 at Yankee Stadium. The New York Jets organization named him the 2015 &quot;High School Coach Of The Year&quot; and awarded his team $4,000.

<doc id="1100630" wikidata="Q6970302" url="?curid=1100630" title="National Alliance for Reconstruction">
<text>The National Alliance for Reconstruction (NAR) was the governing party in Trinidad and Tobago between 1986 and 1991. The party has been inactive since 2005.

==History==
The party was established in 1986, aiming to be a multi-racial party. It was formed by former People&#x27;s National Movement members and opposition parties, including the Organisation for National Reconstruction (a party established in by PNM dissident Karl Hudson-Phillips in 1980), the United Labour Front, the Democratic Action Congress and the Tapia House Movement – the latter three having previously been part of an electoral pact known as the National Alliance.

The new party won the 1986 elections, taking around 66% of the national vote (the first time the PNM had failed to win over 50% since 1956) and winning 33 of the 36 seats in the Trinidad and Tobago. A. N. R. Robinson, previously leader of the DAC, became prime minister.

The NAR entered government with broad national support and goodwill, but support declined as fiscal austerity and neo-liberal economic policies imposed by the International Monetary Fund&#x27;s Structural Adjustment Program resulted in increased unemployment and a 10% cut in salaries in the public service. Infighting over government posts and economic policies split the party and some ministers defected after a single year in power. In 1988 former ULF leader Basdeo Panday was expelled, taking with him five other former ULF members to form the United National Congress. Subsequently, a further five MPs defected to become independents.

In 1990 the Jamaat al Muslimeen attempted to capitalise on the dissatisfaction with an attempted coup. Despite surviving the attempted coup the NAR was defeated in the 1991 general elections, winning only two seats, both in Tobago. Following the defeat Robinson resigned as party leader, and several other prominent NAR members retired, leaving the NAR severely weakened. In the 1992 local elections the NAR suffered another humiliating defeat, failing to win a single seat. The NAR did however retain its dominance in the Tobago House of Assembly, winning eleven of the twelve seats in the 1992 elections.

The party went through rapid leadership changes. Former Works Minister Carson Charles served as leader from 1992 until 1993. He was replaced by former Finance Minister Selby Wilson. Charles left the NAR and formed his own group the National Development Party. In a 1994 by-election an attempt was made to have the NAR and its two daughter parties the UNC and NDP, run a joint platform. However, the proposals failed to come to fruition. The UNC was adopting a policy of attracting &#x27;NAR voters&#x27; directly rather than attempting another formal alliance, and following his failure to reunite the party, Wilson resigned and the NAR was leaderless until just prior to the 1995 elections. During this period NAR chairman Robert Mayers served as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader. When elections were called in 1995, Robinson was persuaded to return and resume leadership of the party.

In the elections the party retained its two Tobago seats, but failed to win any in Trinidad. However, it joined the UNC-led coalition and returned to government. Robinson was appointed Minister Extraordinaire and was elected president in 1997. Former Speaker of the House Nizam Mohammed replaced him as NAR leader.

However the NAR continued to weaken and fracture. Its bargaining position was reduced when two PNM (People&#x27;s National Movement) MPs defected and joined the government as independents. In the 1996 Tobago elections an NAR assemblywoman, Deborah Moore-Miggins, contested as an Independent and won, although the party won ten of the twelve seats. However, two other NAR assemblymen later defected and joined her in forming the People&#x27;s Empowerment Party.

During the 1996 local elections the NAR contested around a third of the 124 seats, whilst the UNC contested the remaining two-thirds. Most of the seats contested by the NAR however were PNM strongholds, where the NAR had little support. Even in places like Arima where the NAR could potentially have won, independent candidates split the vote, leading to PNM victories. The NAR won no seats and accused the UNC of supporting the independents, deliberately preventing the NAR from regaining representation in Trinidad.

Further problems for the party from its two MPs. Morgan Job (who had taken over Robinson&#x27;s seat) frequently sided with the UNC against the NAR leadership, whilst the other was increasing friendly with the PEP and eventually became an independent. The party subsequently withdrew from the government. Mohammed did not seek reelection and former Attorney General Anthony Smart became the new NAR leader in 1999. In the 2000 elections the party was reduced to a single seat.

The following year the party lost the Tobago House of Assembly elections, defeated by the PNM. Early national elections were also held in 2001, which saw the NAR lose its single seat. In another early election the following year the party increased its vote share to 1.1%, but failed to regain a seat.

The NAR suffered a further blow in 2004 when a portion of the Tobago wing of the party led by Hochoy Charles split away from the NAR and re-formed the DAC, reducing the NAR to two seats. In the 2005 Tobago elections it received just 113 votes and lost both.

<doc id="1100634" wikidata="Q3945126" url="?curid=1100634" title="Saint Xavier University">
<text>Saint Xavier University (or SXU) is a private Roman Catholic university in Chicago, Illinois. Founded in 1846 by the Sisters of Mercy, the university enrolls 3,749 students.

== History ==
Saint Xavier University was founded as a women&#x27;s college by the Sisters of Mercy in 1846 at the request of Bishop William Quarter. With the City of Chicago less than 10 years old, the religious sisters, under the guidance of Mother Mary Francis Xavier Warde, R.S.M., established Saint Francis Xavier Female Academy. The Academy, which would later become Saint Xavier College, and finally Saint Xavier University, was the first Mercy College in the world and is the oldest chartered college in the city of Chicago.

In the year 1846, five sisters of Mercy were sent to the city of Chicago from Pittsburgh to start Catholic work in the new city. The original campus (then referred to as an academy), soon gained, in 1847, a state charter which allowed for the granting of degrees from the academy. After this location (Wabash Avenue between Madison and Monroe in downtown Chicago) burned down in the Great Chicago Fire of 1871, the campus was rebuilt on the southern boundary of Chicago.

In 1915, the school became an official college, teaching &quot;all branches of higher learning&quot;.

== Academics ==
Saint Xavier University offers undergraduate majors and graduate programs through its two colleges:

* The College of Liberal Arts and Education
* The College of Nursing, Health Sciences and Business (a recognized Center of Excellence by the National League for Nursing)

Saint Xavier University has one of the most diverse undergraduate student bodies in Chicago and is a federally designated Hispanic-serving institution.

== Campuses ==

=== Chicago ===
Saint Xavier&#x27;s main campus is located in City of Chicago in the Mt. Greenwood neighborhood on the corner of 103rd Street and Central Park Avenue. It is in close proximity to the suburb of Evergreen Park, Illinois.

The university&#x27;s main campus is made up of several buildings, including the Warde Academic Center, which is the oldest building on campus and houses administrative offices and the library; the Shannon Center; McDonough Chapel, a small Catholic chapel; the Graham School of Management Building; Andrew Conference Center and Driehaus Center. Within a mile of the main campus are the Visual Arts Center and O&#x27;Grady Center, which houses the departments of University Relations and University Advancement.

In 2001, an influx of students to the University led to the opening of four new dormitories on campus. Residence halls listed below;

* McCarthy Hall (opened 2001)
* Morris Hall (opened 2002)
* O&#x27;Brien Hall (opened 2008)
* Pacelli Hall (opened 1959)
* Rubloff Hall (opened 2006)

In 2009, former Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley recognized Saint Xavier University for its eco-friendly efforts with the opening of the Arthur Rubloff Hall and O&#x27;Brien Halls on campus. These residence halls are environmentally friendly, featuring rooftop gardens and clean-source alternative energy.

In 2021, Saint Xavier celebrated its 175th anniversary and received an official state resolution honoring its legacy in Chicago. 

== Athletics ==
The Saint Xavier (SXU) athletic teams are called the Cougars. The university is a member of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA), primarily competing in the Chicagoland Collegiate Athletic Conference (CCAC) in most of its sports since the 1973–74 academic year; while its football team competes in the Midwest League of the Mid-States Football Association (MSFA).

SXU competes in 20 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, bowling, cross country, esports, football, golf, soccer, track &amp; field and volleyball; women&#x27;s sports include basketball, bowling, cross country, golf, soccer, softball, track &amp; field and volleyball; and co-ed sports include cheerleading and dance.

=== Facilities ===
Athletic facilities on campus include the Shannon Center, which holds up to 3,500 students and houses the university fitness center. It is home to both men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball and volleyball teams. Bruce R. Deaton Memorial Field is home to football, soccer, and track.

=== Accomplishments ===
In 2011, Saint Xavier won the NAIA Football National Championship.

<text>In basketball, a personal foul is a breach of the rules concerning personal contact with an opponent. It is the most common type of foul in basketball. A player fouls out on reaching a limit on personal fouls for the game and is disqualified from participation in the remainder of the game.

Players routinely initiate illegal contact to purposely affect the play, hoping it is seen as too minor to be ruled a foul. The threshold is subjective and varies among officials and from game to game. Most contact fouls are not regarded as unsportsmanlike. However, excessive or unjustified contact is penalized more severely. The NBA refers to these as [[flagrant foul]]s; other rulebooks call them unsportsmanlike or disqualifying fouls.

==History==

Basketball has always had the concept of fouls. In 1891, James Naismith&#x27;s original 13 rules defined a foul as:
*running with the ball,
*holding the ball with the arms or body,
*striking the ball with the fist,
*shouldering, holding, pushing, striking or tripping in any way of an opponent.
Only the fourth definition remains. Running with the ball and striking it with the fist are now violations. Holding the ball with the arms or body is now rare but legal.

Originally, on a player&#x27;s second foul, the player would be removed without substitution until the next successful goal (similar to a penalty in ice hockey). Before long, free throws were introduced, originally worth three points each, then one. Originally, any team member was allowed to shoot free throws. In 1924, the rules were changed so that the fouled player shot the free throws.

The victim of a contact foul used to be given three attempts at a free throw, and the offense retained possession of the basketball. Now, a player fouled in the act of shooting gets from one to three shots and the other team tends to get possession afterwards (see Penalties below).

==Principles==
Personal contact does not necessarily constitute a personal foul, unless it gives a player an advantage or puts the opponent at a disadvantage.

===Cylinder===
In FIBA, the cylinder principle gives each player exclusive rights within an imaginary cylinder defined:
*in the front by the palms of the hands, when the arms are bent at the elbows so that the forearms and hands are raised, but no farther in front than the feet,
*in the rear by the buttocks,
*at the sides by the outside edge of the arms and legs.
The cylinder extends from the floor to the ceiling, allowing the player to jump upward.

A player can occupy any cylinder not already occupied by the opponent. No one else is allowed to step or reach into this cylinder. A player must not extend his limbs or bend his body in a way that is not normal. If there is a breach of this principle that places the opponent at a disadvantage, the official may penalise it.

The NBA does not use the cylinder principle to judge contact; it only says that a player may not bend or reach in a position that is not normal (nor push, hold, and so on).

===Elements of time and distance===
The elements of time and distance concern the reaction time and distance of another person. They apply only to players without the ball, not to the ball carrier. For example, a player cannot suddenly step in front of a sprinting player, even without invading the cylinder. Another example is when a player sets a screen directly behind a player: the player would not physically be able to react to the screen in enough time to avoid it.

==Types of foul==
===Charging and blocking===

When significant illegal contact between the ball-carrier and a defender occurs, it usually means that either:
*The defender committed a blocking foul, or
*The ball-carrier committed the offensive foul of charging.

Deciding between the two is complex, partly subjective, and often controversial.

Generally, the ball-carrier committed a charge if all of the following are true:
*The defender was still, or moving sideways or backward but not forward, when contact occurred.
*The defender took a legal guarding position before the contact, that is, one with both feet on the floor.
*The defender was hit on the torso (as opposed to the arm or leg).

In the NBA, in contact during a move to the basket, officials do not consider the position of the defender&#x27;s feet, but decide whether the defensive player&#x27;s torso was set in position before the offensive player began his upward motion. An exception is that a charging foul is usually not called if the ball-handler is within a 4-foot (1.22 m) radius around the center of the basket (known in the rules as the &quot;restricted area&quot; and sometimes colloquially as the &quot;smiley face&quot;). That is, if the ball-carrier is under the basket, the defense usually cannot restrict his or her movement by drawing a charge. However, a charge can be called if the offensive player receives the ball within an area close to the basket known as the &quot;lower defensive box.&quot;

A related call is the player control foul.

;Strategy
Apart from using hands in neutral space to shield or deflect a pass or a shot, the defender uses his or her body to impede the ball-carrier&#x27;s advance toward the basket. The defender&#x27;s only absolute way to achieve this is to stand directly in the ball-carrier&#x27;s path and &quot;draw a charge.&quot; Short of this, the defender&#x27;s use of the body may make the ball-carrier hesitate or change tactics. Both opponents are restrained by their desire not to commit a foul.

It is not a foul to grab for the ball, or to touch a hand of the ball-carrier that is on the ball, but the ball-carrier, especially in the act of shooting, can easily cause greater contact that is a blocking foul against the defender.

Once contact is made, the defender may fall to the ground to exaggerate the force of the collision and induce a foul to be called. (The ball-carrier rarely does so, as it would disrupt the effort to score a goal.) Overt deception is disparagingly called a &quot;flop&quot; and is penalized at every level of basketball.

;Screening
A screen is an attempt by an offensive player to stop a defender from guarding the ball-carrier. For example, John Stockton and Karl Malone were well known for their pick and roll (or &quot;screen and roll&quot;) play. The ball-carrier&#x27;s teammate is the screener; he stands in the path of the defender as the ball-carrier dribbles past the screener. This at least costs the defender time, and may induce a collision. Either leaves the ball-carrier unguarded. However, if the screener moves towards the ball-carrier when contact occurs, or does not respect the elements of time and distance, or initiates contact, he is charged with illegal screening or setting a moving pick. These are offensive fouls.

===Other fouls on the ball-carrier===
In the NBA, the ball-carrier cannot attempt to dribble past a defender where there is not enough space, such as dribbling between a defender and either a boundary or another defensive player. If the ball-carrier has space to put head and shoulders past the defender, then the defender is responsible.

In FIBA, this rule is not codified, but contact caused by the dribbler is still penalized.

===Fouls away from the ball===
The rules are symmetrical for contact between offensive and defensive players not involving the ball-carrier. Any player has the right to a position on the court legally acquired. A player acquiring a position that will impede an opponent must respect the elements of time and distance; that is, not take a position so close, or so quickly, that the opponent cannot avoid contact. This includes gradually slowing down after running with the opponent, and situations where the opponent is shielded from seeing the player&#x27;s movement.

===Other personal fouls===
*Pushing – Contact that displaces an opponent (for example, pushing a player away from the basket, or using body weight to affect a player&#x27;s movement).
*Holding – Contact that interferes with a player&#x27;s freedom of movement (for example, physically grabbing a player driving to the basket).
*Illegal use of hands – Extending the hands outside the cylinder and causing illegal contact (for example, going for a steal but hitting the player&#x27;s hand or arm, or hitting the arm of a shooter).
*Hand-checking – Contact by the defense on a ball handler that impedes a player&#x27;s speed, quickness, rhythm, and/or balance.
*Illegal use of elbow – Moving one&#x27;s elbow outside the cylinder to disadvantage an opponent. This mostly occurs during a post-up play situation, where either offense or defense attempt to gain a better position.
*Illegal use of legs or knees (on the dunk) – Jumping up with one knee forward as to intentionally hit the defender.

===Non-foul===
Referees who called every case of illegal player contact would dominate the game to the exclusion of the athletes, but reluctance to make calls would make the game excessively violent. The rules direct referees to seek a balance between these extremes, though they do not define it.

When players are competing for a ball that goes out of bounds, and one player commits illegal but minor contact, referees often do not feel a foul is justified but resolve the situation by simply awarding possession of the ball to the other team.

The &quot;reach-in foul&quot; is a misnomer. Reaching toward a player is not a foul, though physical contact may be a foul.

==Penalties==
The official scorer records the foul in two counts of fouls on the scoresheet:
*As a player foul against the offending player during the game. A player who accumulates too many fouls will foul out (see below).
*As a team foul against the offending player&#x27;s team during the current quarter or half. A team that accumulates too many fouls in that period enters the penalty situation and puts the other team into the &quot;bonus.&quot; In men&#x27;s college basketball (but not women&#x27;s), another, higher number of team fouls gives the other team a &quot;double bonus&quot; regarding the number of free throws. (See the article on free throws.)

On a foul committed by the defense (and on a loose-ball foul when neither team is in possession of the ball), if the team committing the foul is in the penalty situation or the fouled player was in the act of shooting, the fouled player is awarded free throws. Otherwise, and on offensive fouls, the fouled player&#x27;s team is awarded possession of the ball to pass inbounds from the out-of-bounds point nearest to the foul. In the NBA, if the fouling player is in the player foul penalty situation, it is treated as a technical foul and any player may take the one free throw, with the shooting team retaining control of the ball. The shot clock is reset.

In some rulebooks, such as that of FIBA, a technical foul is included in the count of player fouls.

If the game goes to overtime, foul counts are not reset, but continue as though overtime were a continuation of the final regulation period. The NBA and WNBA are exceptions, in that each overtime period has its own count of team fouls.

;Free throws plus possession
The NBA awards the fouled player free throws followed by possession of the ball in the following cases:
*A flagrant foul.
*A defense foul when the ball carrier is in the frontcourt with a &quot;clear path&quot; to the basket (no defender between the ball carrier and the basket).
*A foul &quot;away from the ball&quot; in the last two minutes of the game.
*A &quot;take foul&quot;, which occurs when a defender intentionally fouls to disrupt a fast break transition.

In full-court play, FIBA awards the fouled player one free throw plus possession of the ball for a &quot;throw-in foul&quot;, defined as a foul in the last 2 minutes of a period (either a quarter or overtime) against an offensive player while the ball is out of bounds and either in the hands of the referee or at the disposal of the player taking the throw-in.

Since 2020, The Basketball Tournament has awarded one free throw plus possession for any defensive foul during the Elam Ending that would result in bonus free throws at any other point during the game. This was introduced to eliminate an incentive to foul when the offensive team needed a three-pointer to win while the defensive team needed at most 2 points.

===Strategy===

Fans and commentators often speak of a &quot;good foul&quot; when the fouled player would otherwise have made a sure basket. By fouling the player and preventing an easy two points, the defender forces the offensive player to &quot;earn&quot; the two points from the free throw line. However, if the foul does not prevent the player from scoring, the basket is counted and the fouled player gets an additional free throw.

After the fouled player shoots free throws, the team that was on defense is likely to gain possession of the ball. This is by award, if the final free throw was made. Even if it is missed, defensive players can occupy better positions at the side of the lane to get the rebound.

Near the end of the game, a team that is losing may purposefully foul offensive players to stop the clock and regain possession of the ball, with the hope that the player will miss his free throws. Coaches study free-throw percentages, so that the defense will foul a ball carrier who is poor at free-throw shooting. The &quot;Hack-a-Shaq&quot; strategy was famously practiced against Shaquille O&#x27;Neal in view of his poor percentage. The defense is not free to foul its choice of the five offensive players, as a foul &quot;away from the ball&quot; results in free throws plus possession. The use of intentional fouls to prolong a game is unique to basketball; most other sports consider such maneuvers a form of unsportsmanlike conduct and impose stiffer penalties to teams that attempt them (see the professional foul and unfair act in football codes).

;Foul to give
Near the end of a period, a team may have committed so few fouls that it can commit one or more fouls without putting the opponent in the bonus. It is said that the team has one or more fouls to give. A player who is not close to fouling out can foul an opponent with impunity to prevent a likely score.

To keep games from being bogged down with cheap fouls, the NBA rules provide that the second foul in the final two minutes of a period puts the fouled team in the bonus (enabling free throws) regardless of the number of team fouls.

===Fouling out===
A player who commits five personal fouls over the course of a 40-minute game, or six in a 48-minute game, fouls out and is disqualified for the remainder of the game. A player within one or two fouls of fouling out is in &quot;foul trouble.&quot; Players who foul out are not ejected and may remain in the bench area for the remainder of the game. Fouling out of a game is not a disciplinary action.

In the NCAA and FIBA, if a team is reduced below five players by fouling out, injury, or ejection, play continues. A team is declared the loser if reduced to a single player.

This rule was invoked in an NCAA game between the Minnesota Golden Gophers and the Alabama Crimson Tide on November 25, 2017. With 13:39 remaining in the second half, a scuffle broke out involving Minnesota players in the game and Alabama players on the bench. Alabama&#x27;s entire bench was ejected, leaving the Crimson Tide with only five active players. Alabama&#x27;s Dazon Ingram fouled out at the 11:37 mark, and John Petty left the game with a sprained ankle, forcing the Tide to play the final 10:41 with three players.

In the NBA and WNBA, teams cannot be reduced below five players. A player foul penalty situation exists when only five eligible players remain. If there are only five players, a player who fouls out stays in the game. If another of the five players is ejected or injured, the last player to foul out rejoins the game. Under the player foul penalty rule, each situation results in a technical foul, with the non-offending team shooting one technical foul free throw. If that player commits another foul, the opponent will be awarded one additional free throw under the same situation in addition to any free throws awarded, including offensive fouls, which normally are not assessed free throws. Each such situation will be scored as a non-unsportsmanlike conduct technical foul. These technical fouls are not for unsportsmanlike conduct, so they do not result in ejections from the game.

This rule let Don Otten set the NBA record for personal fouls in a regular-season game. He had eight fouls while playing for the Tri-Cities Blackhawks (now the Atlanta Hawks) against the Sheboygan Red Skins on November 24, 1949. The rule was also invoked in a game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Cleveland Cavaliers on February 5, 2014. With the Lakers down to five players due to injuries, when Robert Sacre fouled out, he remained in the game.

In FIBA-authorized 3x3 half-court competition, players cannot foul out because personal foul counts are kept only on a team basis and not individually. However, unsportsmanlike and disqualifying fouls (equivalent to the flagrant fouls of most North American rule sets) are assessed to individuals, and a player who commits two unsportsmanlike fouls or one disqualifying foul is removed from the game.

In the NBA, disqualifying fouls are two technicals or one flagrant 2 (unnecessary and excessive contact). Bench players and staff are subject to accumulating team technical fouls. The coaching staff is also subject to ejection from the game. Ejected personnel may incur fines as well.

<text>Bowed [[kite]]s such as the Japanese rokkaku, and traditional versions of the more familiar &quot;diamond&quot; shaped kites such as the Malay or Eddy, are tensioned into a bow in order to improve their stability to the point where a tail often becomes unnecessary.

The classic long-tail diamond kite, with a simple two-point bridle, has its lateral roll or flutter (oscillation) greatly reduced or eliminated by a bow in its horizontal spar. Some modern designs use a fixed plastic joiner with a dihedral shape instead of a bowed spar to achieve the same stability effect.

<text>A branch president is a leader of a &quot;branch&quot; of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

The calling of branch president is very similar to the calling of bishop, except that instead of presiding over a ward, the branch president presides over a branch. The branch president is directly responsible for the operation of his branch and the well-being of its patrons. The branch president usually has two counselors to assist him in his duties; these three men comprise the &quot;branch presidency&quot;. Like almost all callings in the LDS Church, the branch president is not paid for his work in the church.

A branch president must hold the priesthood and at a minimum must hold the office of priest. Unlike a bishop, a branch president is not required to be a high priest, or be married, but conforming with these stipulations may depend on whether the branch is part of a district or a stake. In branches within stakes that contain several priesthood holders a branch president will usually be married and may be ordained to the office of high priest. In branches where no resident member is a worthy priesthood holder, a full-time missionary may be called to be branch president.

Branch presidents are given the honorific title &quot;President&quot;.

<text>National Team Unity (NTU) was a political party in Trinidad and Tobago led by Human Rights lawyer and former Attorney General Ramesh Lawrence Maharaj. 
Founded as &quot;Team Unity&quot;, to contest party elections within the United National Congress in 2001, the slate of candidates was led by Maharaj. Team Unity won 21 of 24 contested executive posts including the Deputy Leadership (won by Maharaj).
Later that year a rift with UNC leader Basdeo Panday led Maharaj, together with Oropouche Member of Parliament Trevor Sudama and Naparima MP Ralph Maraj, to leave the party. This caused the UNC to lose its parliamentary majority, forcing national elections.
Renaming itself National Team Unity, the party contested the 2001 general elections, winning 2.5% of the vote but no seats. It did not contest the 2002 general elections.

By 2003 the NTU was described as &quot;apparently defunct&quot;, with Maharaj looking to start a new political vehicle. He would later rejoin the United National Congress.

<doc id="1100652" wikidata="Q348137" url="?curid=1100652" title="Leopold I, Margrave of Austria">
<text>Leopold I (also &quot;Luitpold&quot;; 940 – 10 July 994), known as the Illustrious () was a member of the House of Babenberg who ruled as Margrave of Austria from 976 until his death. He was the first margrave of the Babenberg dynasty which ruled the March and Duchy of Austria until its extinction in 1246.

==Biography==
The origins of Leopold the Illustrious are not known. According to some sources, his father Berthold was count in the Nordgau, the region north of Ratisbon (Regensburg) in the Duchy of Bavaria. A more recent theory identifies Leopold as a younger son of Duke Arnulf of Bavaria and brother (or nephew) of Count Berthold of Schweinfurt. While his ancestry remains disputed, a descent from the Popponids (Elder House of Babenberg) is assumed and some affiliation with the ducal Luitpoldings dynasty is probable.

Leopold is first mentioned in a document issued by Emperor Otto I on 13 February 962 as &quot;Liupo&quot;, count of the Bavarian &quot;Donaugau&quot; region near Ratisbon, count of the &quot;Traungau&quot; region, and a faithful follower of the emperor. After Otto I had defeated the Magyars in the 955 Battle of Lechfeld, he re-established the Bavarian &quot;Marcha orientalis&quot; (Eastern March) in the conquered territories, placing them under the command of Margrave Burkhard, a brother-in-law of Duchess Judith, consort of Duke Henry II of Bavaria. When Burkhard joined the uprising of Duke Henry II (&quot;the Wrangler&quot;) against Emperor Otto II, he was deposed at the Imperial Diet of Ratisbon in 976. According to a charter dated 21 July 976, loyal Leopold was appointed margrave of the &quot;Marcha orientalis&quot;, the core territory of the later Archduchy of Austria.
The resettlement of the east was a slow process that centered from the fortress of Pöchlarn down the Danube river. Leopold&#x27;s margraviate originally coincided with the present-day Wachau valley, and whose eastern boundary was the Traisen river near Sankt Pölten east of Krems. With the Magyar threat largely reduced following their defeat in 955, Leopold focused on securing his holdings from internal threats and dissensions. In 984, he engaged in the reduction of the fortress at Melk, which was still controlled by supporters of the late margrave. Once Melk was secured, Leopold most likely used it as his residence, founding a monastery there for twelve secular priests. By 987, Leopold extended the boundary of his margraviate to the east as far as the Wienerwald mountain range and by 991, jointly with reinstated Duke Henry II of Bavaria, further down to the Fischa river.

In 994, Leopold travelled to Würzburg to mediate a dispute between his cousin Margrave Henry of Schweinfurt and the Würzburg bishop Bernward von Rothenburg, one of whose knights Henry had seized and blinded. At a tournament held on 8 July, Leopold was hit in the eye by an arrow directed at his cousin. Two days later, on 10 July 994, he died from his injuries. He was buried in Würzburg. In 1015, his son Duke Ernest I of Swabia, was buried next to his father. In the thirteenth century, their remains were returned to Melk Abbey.

==Historiography==
Leopold ruled over the re-established &quot;Marcha orientalis&quot; for eighteen years. He organized and expanded it with great ability, and left behind a margravate that had assumed the character of &quot;an ordered and civilized land&quot;. The chronicler Thietmar wrote that no man was wiser that he in all his actions, or of a worthier nature. Perhaps the highest testimony to Leopold&#x27;s life and reputation came from the actions of Emperor Otto III, who immediately invested his son Henry I with his father&#x27;s margravate.

Although Leopold is not mentioned in the &quot;Babenberger Chronicle&quot; written by his descendant Otto of Freising—which only starts with Leopold&#x27;s grandson Adalbert—he is known today as the progenitor of the Babenberg dynasty. Otto of Freising&#x27;s claim of ancestry to the Franconian Babenbergs, who are remembered for the Babenberger insurgency of the early tenth century, has not been proven, but cannot be completely ruled out.

In 1976, the millennial anniversary of Leopold&#x27;s appointment as margrave was celebrated as a &quot;Thousand Years of Austria&quot;. Celebrations under the same title were held twenty years later at the anniversary of the famous 996 &quot;Ostarrîchi&quot; document first mentioning the Old German name of Austria.

==Marriage==
Leopold married Richardis, the daughter of Count Ernest IV of Sualafeldgau (according to other sources of the Ezzonid count Erenfried II) and probably the aunt of Duke Adalbero of Carinthia. Their marriage produced eight children:
# Henry I (died 1018), second Margrave of Austria
# Judith
# Ernest I (died 1015), Duke of Swabia
# Adalbert (985–1055), third Margrave of Austria
# Poppo (986–1047), Archbishop of Trier
# Kunigunda
# Hemma, married Count Rapoto of Dießen
# Christina, a nun at Trier

<doc id="1100659" wikidata="Q7626936" url="?curid=1100659" title="Stuart Parker (politician)">
<text>Stuart Parker (born 1972) is a Canadian politician who was the acting leader of the BC Ecosocialists party in 2020 and was the leader of the Green Party in British Columbia, Canada, from 1993 to 2000. In 2009, during the Ontario by-election to replace MPP Michael Bryant, he unsuccessfully sought the Ontario New Democratic Party nomination for the St. Paul&#x27;s provincial riding.

==Green Party activism==
Prior to winning the party&#x27;s leadership at the age of 21, he had been the founder and spokesperson of the party&#x27;s youth wing, the Young Greens from 1988 to 1992 and was best known for coordinating the group&#x27;s successful national campaign against McDonald&#x27;s Restaurants&#x27; use of ozone-destroying foam packaging. Parker and the Young Greens received substantial credit from Canada&#x27;s national media in 1990 when the restaurant giant abandoned the use of chlorofluorocarbon-based foam. The group&#x27;s continued campaign against the use of CFCs in foam packaging led to CKF Incorporated, Canada&#x27;s largest manufacturer of CFC-based foam, abandoning the use of CFCs in manufacturing in 1993.

Parker managed to take the party from a tiny group of 59 in 1992 to a party that was only four candidates short of a full slate in the 1996 provincial election. He built links to poverty activists and labour groups. During his leadership, the party&#x27;s standing in public opinion polls rose from 1% to 11%. During his time as the party leader, Parker was arrested in anti-clearcutting blockades in Clayoquot Sound in 1993 and the Slocan Valley in 1997.

Reversing his earlier position, he negotiated agreements with the municipal affiliates of the then-incumbent British Columbia New Democratic Party (NDP) provincial government and the labour councils of Vancouver and Victoria in 1998 and 1999, resulting in the first and the only Red-Green coalitions in Canadian history in BC&#x27;s 1999 municipal elections. As part of these coalitions, the Greens won their first-ever municipal seats in Canadian cities.

Ultimately, his focus on building a broadly left-wing green party in BC brought criticism from some members of the environmental movement in the province. Those people played a significant role in the efforts that eventually led to Parker&#x27;s defeat at the party&#x27;s March 2000 convention - after previous unsuccessful attempts to unseat him in 1998 and 1999.

At the time of Parker&#x27;s defeat, his supporters in the party were in negotiations with the NDP over a potential provincial electoral alliance. His successor, Adriane Carr, cancelled these negotiations.

On June 2, 2020, Parker rejoined the party and endorsed Dimitri Lascaris in the leadership election.

Parker is a founder of the BC Ecosocialist and was its acting leader, as well as a prospective candidate in the 2020 British Columbia general election. He resigned as both after allegations he made transphobic comments.

===BC Ecosocialists===
BC Ecosocialists was a provincial political party in British Columbia, Canada. Its stated aims included steering the province to a greener society and fighting discrimination against the First Nations and immigrants. Formed in 2019, the 2020 British Columbia general election was expected to be its first.

Shortly after the 2020 provincial election was called, Parker resigned following allegations of transphobia. Parker dismissed the allegations as &quot;a blizzard of cancel culture silliness&quot;, but resigned as party leader on September 22, 2020, leaving the position vacant. The party did not field any candidates in the election.

==== Policy ====
The party described itself as &quot;Further left than the NDP, greener than the greens&quot;. It listed figures Greta Thunberg, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and Autumn Peltier as their inspirations, among others. It supported the water protector activists at Standing Rock Indian Reservation, particularly praising these people prioritizing the Earth and its inhabitants over wealth.

The party&#x27;s main priority was to provide a better quality of living for all people, including housing for all, food for all, and creating a sustainable environment. It proposed the adoption of a Green New Deal to create jobs by developing green energy sources in British Columbia (BC). The party planned to increase taxes for top earning individuals and corporations in order to fund such projects, as well as make improvements to the transportation infrastructure. It also wanted to freeze fossil fuel development in the province.

The Ecosocialists promised to break up large cooperative institutions into small, community based cooperatives. Their main targets were Vancity and the Mountain Equipment Co-op. They also planned to raise the minimum wage to $16 per hour, criticizing John Horgan&#x27;s plan to keep the minimum wage below Alberta&#x27;s until 2021.

The party also aimed to improve human rights of minority groups in BC, particularly the First Nations in British Columbia, the LGBT+ community, and persons with disabilities, and put an end to gender inequality. The party had a decolonization policy, described as &quot;returning power, land and resources to Indigenous people, not just tearful apologies and photo-ops&quot;.

The party planned to provide further resources to fight white collar crime, with emphasis on those who break workers&#x27; safety and wage laws, as well as pollution. It aimed to decriminalize drug usage, and instead focus on rehabilitation for addicts. It would also file suit against the oil and coal industries for their roles in climate change.

The party wanted to shift to a proportional representation system of voting based on the Norwegian system. Furthermore, the party wanted to increase aboriginal representation in the legislature by adopting the New Zealand model, which includes Māori electorates, and make election day a statutory holiday to improve voter turnout.

==NDP and electoral reform activism==
Parker&#x27;s departure from the party came as the Greens were perceived to be moving to the political right. He subsequently worked with the NDP in the 2001 provincial election and with the federal New Democratic Party in the 2004 federal election.

Upon leaving the Green Party, Parker initially worked as a lobbyist for Mike Geoghegan. Despite leaving the Greens and joining the NDP, he remained a strong advocate for electoral reform, specifically proportional representation. A co-founder of the BC Electoral Change Coalition in 1997, he served on the board of Fair Voting BC (2000–2002, 2006–2009) and on the board of Fair Vote Canada (2005–2007). He served as a spokesperson for the &quot;YES&quot; campaign in the 2005 and 2009 BC referendums on voting reform.

Living in Ontario in 2009, he sought the NDP nomination for the provincial by-election in the St. Paul&#x27;s electoral district, but was defeated by lawyer Julian Heller.

Following the defeat, Parker was encouraged by the NDP&#x27;s national office and the board of the St. Paul&#x27;s federal riding association to seek the party&#x27;s federal nomination. However, in March 2010, after initially being approved by the party&#x27;s vetting process the previous November, he was informed by head office staff that he was not only disqualified from running in St. Paul&#x27;s, but barred from running for a federal NDP nomination anywhere in Canada. Party officials objected to four posts he had made to his personal Facebook page in the intervening months, particularly one in which he urged Toronto NDP supporters to back the NDP candidate for mayor in the wake of a sex scandal.

In March 2018, Stuart Parker resigned from the NDP over the provincial government&#x27;s subsidies to transnational fossil fuel producers.

==Surrey municipal politics==

Parker organizes reading groups through the Los Altos Institute, which describes itself as a &quot;left-wing think tank&quot;, and Los Altos began a reading group in Surrey, BC in 2016.
From that Surrey group, in April 2018, Parker announced the creation of a civic party in the city of Surrey called Proudly Surrey. The party ran candidates for City Council, including Parker, a candidate for mayor, Dr. Pauline Greaves, and candidates for Surrey School Board in the October 20, 2018, municipal election.

==Personal==

The son of Valerie Jerome and nephew of Harry Jerome, Parker was the first leader of a registered political party in BC of African descent and gave the keynote speech to the opening ceremony of the province&#x27;s Black History Month in 1994.

He is currently based in the Vancouver area after doing a travel-intensive postdoctoral fellowship from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada on the religions of indigenous peoples of the Americas and Polynesia. He works as a university lecturer at both Simon Fraser University and the British Columbia Institute of Technology.

==Election results==
1. Vancouver Parks Board and Surrey City Council are chosen in a citywide (at-large) election in which seven candidates are elected. Although Parker received 3.2% of the total votes, approximately 23% of electors voted for him and in Surrey, he received the support of just shy of 9% of voters.

<doc id="1100670" wikidata="Q2659367" url="?curid=1100670" title="Immigration to Australia">
<text>The Australian continent was first settled when ancestors of Indigenous Australians arrived via the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia and New Guinea over 50,000 years ago.
European colonisation began in 1788 with the establishment of a British penal colony in New South Wales. Beginning in 1901, Australia maintained the White Australia policy for much of the 20th century, which forbid the entrance in Australia of people of non-European ethnic origins. Following World War II, the policy was gradually relaxed, and was abolished entirely in 1973. Since 1945, more than 7 million people have settled in Australia.

Between 1788 and the mid-20th century, the vast majority of settlers and immigrants came from Britain and Ireland (principally England, Ireland and Scotland), although there was significant immigration from China and Germany during the 19th century. In the decades immediately following World War II, Australia received a large wave of immigration from across Europe, with many more immigrants arriving from Southern and Eastern Europe than in previous decades. Since the end of the White Australia policy in 1973, Australia has pursued an official policy of multiculturalism, and there has been a large and continuing wave of immigration from across the world, with Asia being the largest source of immigrants in the 21st century. In 2019–20, immigration to Australia came to a halt during the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn saw a shrinkage of the Australian population for the first time since World War I, though in the following period 2021–22 showed a very strong recovery of migrant arrivals. 

Net overseas migration has increased from 30,042 in 1992–93 to 178,582 persons in 2015–16, and 536,000 in 2022–23. The largest components of immigration are the skilled migration and family re-union programs. A 2014 sociological study concluded that: &quot;Australia and Canada are the most receptive to immigration among western nations.&quot; In 2023, BCG ranked Australia as the top country destination for individuals seeking to work and live a high-quality life based on global assessments.

Australia is a signatory to the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and has resettled many asylum seekers. In recent years, Australia&#x27;s policy of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals by boat has attracted controversy.

== Immigration history of Australia ==

The first migration of humans to the continent took place around 65,000 years ago via the islands of Maritime Southeast Asia and Papua New Guinea as part of the early history of human migration out of Africa.

=== Penal transportation ===
European migration to Australia began with the British convict settlement of Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788. The First Fleet comprised 11 ships carrying 775 convicts and 645 officials, members of the crew, marines, and their families and children. The settlers consisted of petty criminals, second-rate soldiers and a crew of sailors. There were few with skills needed to start a self-sufficient settlement, such as farmers and builders, and the colony experienced hunger and hardships. Male settlers far outnumbered female settlers. The Second Fleet arrived in 1790 bringing more convicts. The conditions of the transportation was described as horrific and worse than slave transports. Of the 1,026 convicts who embarked, 267 (256 men and 11 women) died during the voyage (26%); a further 486 were sick when they arrived of which 124 died soon after. The fleet was more of a drain on the struggling settlement than of any benefit. Conditions on the Third Fleet, which followed on the heels of the Second Fleet in 1791, were a bit better. The fleet comprised 11 ships. Of the more than 2000 convicts brought onto the ships, 173 male convicts and 9 female convicts died during the voyage. Other transport fleets bringing further convicts as well as freemen to the colony would follow. By the end of the penal transportation in 1868, approximately 165,000 people had entered Australia as convicts.

=== Bounty Immigration ===

The colonies promoted migration by a variety of schemes. The Bounty Immigration Scheme (1835-1841) boosted emigration from the United Kingdom to New South Wales. The South Australia Company was established to encourage settlement in South Australia by labourers and skilled migrants.

=== Gold rush and population growth ===


The Gold Rush era, beginning in 1851, led to an enormous expansion in population, including large numbers of British and Irish settlers, followed by smaller numbers of Germans, other Europeans, and Chinese. This latter group was subject to increasing restrictions and discrimination, making it impossible for many to remain in the country. With the federation of the Australian colonies into a single nation, one of the first acts of the new Commonwealth Government was the Immigration Restriction Act 1901, otherwise known as the White Australia policy, which was a strengthening and unification of disparate colonial policies designed to restrict non-White settlement. Because of opposition from the British government, an explicit racial policy was avoided in the legislation, with the control mechanism being a dictation test in a European language selected by the immigration officer. This was selected to be one the immigrant did not know; the last time an immigrant passed a test was in 1909. Perhaps the most celebrated case was Egon Erwin Kisch, a left-wing Austrian journalist who could speak five languages, who was failed in a test in Scottish Gaelic and deported as illiterate.

The government also found that if it wanted immigrants, it had to subsidise migration. The great distance from Europe made Australia a more expensive and less attractive destination than Canada and the United States. The number of immigrants needed during different stages of the economic cycle could be controlled by varying the subsidy. Before Federation in 1901, assisted migrants received passage assistance from colonial government funds. The British government paid for the passage of convicts, paupers, the military, and civil servants. Few immigrants received colonial government assistance before 1831. However, young women were receiving assisted passages from state governments to migrate to Australia in the early years of Federation.

With the onset of the Great Depression, the Governor-General proclaimed the cessation of immigration until further notice. The next group to arrive were 5,000 Jewish refugee families from Germany in 1938. Approved groups such as these were assured of entry by being issued a Certificate of Exemption from the Dictation Test.

=== Post-war immigration to Australia ===

After World War II, Australia launched a massive immigration program, believing that having narrowly avoided a Japanese invasion, Australia must &quot;populate or perish&quot;. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Europeans migrated to Australia and over 1,000,000 British subjects immigrated under the Assisted Passage Migration Scheme, colloquially becoming known as Ten Pound Poms. The scheme initially targeted citizens of all Commonwealth countries; after the war it gradually extended to other countries such as the Netherlands and Italy. The qualifications were straightforward: migrants needed to be in sound health and under the age of 45 years. There were initially no skill restrictions, although under the White Australia Policy, people from mixed-race backgrounds found it very difficult to take advantage of the scheme.

In 1973, multiculturalism largely displaced cultural selectivity in immigration policy.

Net overseas migration reached a record level of 536,000 in 2022–23, up from 170,900 in 2021–22. Overall migration was 739,000 in 2022-23.

=== Overview ===
==Current immigration programs==

=== Migration program ===

There are a number of different types of Australian immigration, classed under different categories of visa:
* Skilled Occupation visas - Australian working visas are most commonly granted to highly skilled workers. Candidates are assessed against a points-based system, with points allocated for certain standards of education. These visas are often sponsored by individual States, which recruit workers according to specific needs. Visas may also be granted to applicants sponsored by an Australian business. The most popular form of sponsored working visa was the 457 visa set in place in 1996 which has now been abolished by the Turnbull government.
* Student visas - The Australian Government actively encourages foreign students to study in Australia. There are a number of categories of a student visa, most of which require a confirmed offer from an educational institution.
* Family visas - Visas are often granted on the basis of family ties in Australia. There are a number of different types of Australian family visas, including Contributory Parent visas, Child Visa and Partner visas.
* Working holiday visa - This visa is a residence permit allowing travelers to undertake employment (and sometimes study) in the country issuing the visa to supplement education.

Employment and family visas can often lead to Australian citizenship; however, this requires the applicant to have lived in Australia for at least four years with at least one year as a permanent resident.
* Investor visas - Foreign investors could invest the business or fund in Australia to acquire the Permanent Residential of Australia, after 4 years (including the year which acquire the visa), they need to take the exam and make a declaration in order to be a citizen of Australia.

Claims have been made that Australia&#x27;s migration program is in conflict with anti age-discrimination legislation and there have been calls to remove or amend the age limit of 50 for general skilled migrants.

===Humanitarian program===

Australia grants two types of visa under its humanitarian program:

* Refugee-category visas for refugees under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees
* Special Humanitarian Programme (SHP) visas for persons who are subject to substantial discrimination amounting to gross violation of their human rights in their home country

The cap for visas granted under the humanitarian program was 13,750 for 2015–16, plus an additional 12,000 visas available for refugees from the conflicts in Syria and Iraq.

===Migration and settlement services===

The Australian Government and the community provide a number of migration-assistance and settlement-support services: 
* The Adult Migrant English Program, available to eligible migrants from the humanitarian, family and skilled-visa streams, provides free English-language courses for those who do not have functional English. Up to 510 hours of English language courses are provided during the first five years of settlement in Australia.
* The Department of Home Affairs operates a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week telephone-based interpreting service called the Translating and Interpreting Service National, which facilitates contact between non-English speakers and interpreters, enabling access to government and community services.
* The Settlement Grants Program provides funding to assist humanitarian entrants and migrants settle in Australia and to participate equitably in Australian society as soon as possible after arrival. The program is targeted to deliver settlement services to humanitarian entrants, family migrants with low levels of English proficiency and dependants of skilled migrants in rural and regional areas with low English-proficiency.
* The Australian Cultural Orientation program provides practical advice and the opportunity to ask questions about travel to and life in Australia to refugee and humanitarian visa holders who are preparing to settle in Australia. The program is delivered overseas over five days before the visa holder begins his or her journey.
* Refugee and humanitarian visa holders are also eligible to receive on-arrival settlement support through the Humanitarian Settlement Services program, which provides intensive settlement-support and equips individuals with the skills and knowledge to independently access services beyond the initial settlement period.
* The Immigration Advice and Application Assistance Scheme provides professional assistance, free of charge, to disadvantaged visa-applicants, to help with the completion and submission of visa applications, liaison with the department, and advice on complex immigration matters. It also provides migration advice to prospective visa-applicants and sponsors.
* In response to the needs of asylum seekers, the Asylum Seeker Assistance Scheme was established in 1992 to address Australia&#x27;s obligations under the Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. The Australian Red Cross administers the scheme under contract to the Department of Immigration and Citizenship. It provides financial assistance to asylum seekers in the community who satisfy specific eligibility criteria, and also facilitates access to casework assistance and to other support services for asylum seekers through the Australian Red Cross.
* A variety of community-based services cater to the needs of newly-arrived migrants, refugees, and asylum seekers. Some of these services, such as Migrant Resource Centres, receive funding from the Commonwealth Government.

== Country of birth of Australian residents ==

, 30% of the Australian resident population, or 7,529,570 people, had been born overseas.

The following table shows Australia&#x27;s population by country of birth as estimated by the Australian Bureau of Statistics in 2020. It shows only countries or regions or birth with a population of over 100,000 residing in Australia.


The separate Australian States show some differences in settlement patterns, as demonstrated in the statistics compiled during the 2006 Census:
* New South Wales had the largest population, and the largest foreign-born population, in Australia (1,544,023). Certain nationalities concentrated notably in this state: 74.5% of Lebanese-born, 63.1% of Iraqi-born, 63.0% of South Korean-born, 59.4% of Fijian-born, and 59.4% of Chinese-born Australian residents lived in New South Wales.
* Victoria, the second-most populous state, also had the second-largest number of overseas-born persons (1,161,984). 50.6% of Sri Lankan-born, 50.1% of Turkish-born, 49.4% of Greek-born and 41.6% of Italian-born Australian residents lived in Victoria.
* Western Australia, with 528,827 overseas-born residents, had the highest proportion of foreign-born population. The state attracted 29.6% of all Singaporean-born Australian residents, and narrowly trailed New South Wales in having the largest population of British-born Australian residents.
* Queensland had 695,525 overseas-born residents, and attracted the greatest proportion of persons born in Papua New Guinea (52.4%) and in New Zealand (38.2%).

==Impacts and concerns==
There are a range of views in the Australian community on the composition and level of immigration, and on the possible effects of varying the level of immigration and population growth.

In 2002, a CSIRO population study commissioned by the former Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, outlined six potential dilemmas associated with immigration-driven population growth. These included: the absolute numbers of aged residents continuing to rise despite high immigration off-setting ageing and declining birth-rates in a proportional sense; a worsening of Australia&#x27;s trade balance due to more imports and higher consumption of domestic production; increased greenhouse gas emissions; overuse of agricultural soils; marine fisheries and domestic supplies of oil and gas; and a decline in urban air quality, river quality and biodiversity.

===Environment===

Some environmental movements believe that as the driest inhabited continent, Australia cannot continue to sustain its current rate of population growth without becoming overpopulated. The Sustainable Population Australia (SPA) argues that climate change will lead to a deterioration of natural ecosystems through increased temperatures, extreme weather events and less rainfall in the southern part of the continent, thus reducing its capacity to sustain a large population even further. The Australia Institute has concluded that Australia&#x27;s population growth has been one of the main factors driving growth in domestic greenhouse gas emissions. It concluded that the average emissions per capita in the countries that immigrants come from is only 42 percent of average emissions in Australia, finding that as immigrants alter their lifestyle to that of Australians, they increase global greenhouse gas emissions. The Institute calculated that each additional 70,000 immigrants will lead to additional emissions of 20 million tonnes of greenhouse gases by the end of the Kyoto target period (2012) and 30 million tonnes by 2020.

===Housing and infrastructure===
A number of economists, such as Macquarie Bank analyst Rory Robertson, assert that high immigration and the propensity of new arrivals to cluster in the capital cities is exacerbating the nation&#x27;s housing affordability problem. According to Robertson, Federal Government policies that fuel demand for housing, such as the currently high levels of immigration, as well as capital gains tax discounts and subsidies to boost fertility, have had a greater impact on housing affordability than land release on urban fringes.

The Productivity Commission in its 2004 Inquiry Report No. 28, &quot;First Home Ownership&quot;, concluded: &quot;Growth in immigration since the mid-1990s has been an important contributor to underlying demand, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne.&quot; The Reserve Bank of Australia in its submission to the same Productivity Commission report stated that &quot;rapid growth in overseas visitors such as students may have boosted demand for rental housing&quot;. However, the Commission found that &quot;the ABS resident population estimates have limitations when used for assessing housing demand. Given the significant influx of foreigners coming to work or study in Australia in recent years, it seems highly likely that short-stay visitor movements may have added to the demand for housing. However, the Commissions are unaware of any research that quantifies the effects.&quot;

Some individuals and interest groups have also argued that immigration causes overburdened infrastructure.

In 2024, Australia faced a housing crisis, exacerbated by the Albanese government&#x27;s immigration policies.

===Employment===

Australia maintains a list of skilled occupations that are currently acceptable for immigration to Australia.

In 2009, following the global financial crisis, the Australian government reduced its immigration target by 14%, and the permanent migration program for skilled migrants was reduced to 115,000 people for that financial year. In 2010–2011, the migration intake was adjusted so that 67.5% of the permanent migration program would be for skilled migrants, and 113,725 visas were granted.

According to &quot;Graduate Careers Australia&quot;, there have been some declines in full-time employment between 2012–2015 for recent university graduates of various degrees, including dentistry, computer science, architecture, psychology, and nursing. In 2014, a number of the professional associations for some of these fields criticised the immigration policy for skilled migrants, contending that these policies have contributed to difficulties for local degree holders in obtaining full-time employment. In 2016, the Department of Health forecast a shortfall in nurses of approximately 85,000 by 2025 and 123,000 by 2030.

In 2016, Monash University academics published a report which contended that Australia&#x27;s immigration program is deeply flawed. The government&#x27;s &quot;Medium to Long-Term Strategic Skill List&quot; allows immigration by professionals who end up competing with graduates of Australian universities for scarce positions. On the other hand, Australia&#x27;s shortage of skilled tradespeople is not being addressed.

===Economic growth and aging population===
Another element in the immigration debate is a concern to alleviate adverse impacts arising from Australia&#x27;s ageing population. In the 1990s, the former Federal Treasurer Peter Costello stated that Australia is underpopulated due to a low birth rate, and that negative population growth will have adverse long-term effects on the economy as the population ages and the labour market becomes less competitive. To avoid this outcome the government increased immigration to fill gaps in labour markets and introduced a subsidy to encourage families to have more children. However, opponents of population growth such as Sustainable Population Australia do not accept that population growth will decline and reverse, based on current immigration and fertility projections.

There is debate over whether immigration can slow the ageing of Australia&#x27;s population. In a research paper entitled &quot;Population Futures for Australia: the Policy Alternatives&quot;, Peter McDonald claims that &quot;it is demographic nonsense to believe that immigration can help to keep our population young.&quot; However, according to Creedy and Alvarado (p. 99), by 2031 there will be a 1.1 per cent fall in the proportion of the population aged over 65 if net migration rate is 80,000 per year. If net migration rate is 170,000 per year, the proportion of the population aged over 65 would reduce by 3.1 per cent. As of 2007 during the leadership of John Howard, the net migration rate was 160,000 per year.

According to the Commonwealth Treasury, immigration can reduce the average age of the Australian population: &quot;The level of net overseas migration is important: net inflows of migrants to Australia reduce the rate of population ageing because migrants are younger on average than the resident population. Currently, around 85 per cent of migrants are aged under 40 when they migrate to Australia, compared to around 55 per cent for the resident population.&quot; Ross Gittins, an economics columnist at Fairfax Media, has said that the Government&#x27;s focus on skilled migration has in fact reduced the average age of migrants. &quot;More than half are aged 15 to 34, compared with 28 per cent of our population. Only 2 per cent of permanent immigrants are 65 or older, compared with 13 per cent of our population.&quot; Because of these statistics, Gittens claims that immigration is slowing the ageing of the Australian population and that the &quot;net benefit to the economy is a lot more clear-cut.&quot;

Robert Birrell, director of the Centre for Population and Urban Research at Monash University, has argued: &quot;It is true that a net migration intake averaging around 180,000 per year will mean that the proportion of persons aged 65 plus to the total population will be a few percentage points lower in 2050 than it would be with a low migration intake. But this ‘gain’ would be bought at the expense of having to accommodate a much larger population. These people too, will age, thus requiring an even larger migration intake in subsequent years to look after them.&quot;

In July 2005 the Productivity Commission launched a commissioned study entitled &quot;Economic Impacts of Migration and Population Growth&quot;, and released an initial position paper on 17 January 2006 which states that the increase of income per capita provided by higher migration (50 percent more than the base model) by the 2024–2025 financial year would be $335 (0.6%), an amount described as &quot;very small.&quot; The paper also found that Australians would on average work 1.3 percent longer hours, about twice the proportional increase in income.

Using regression analysis, Addison and Worswick found in a 2002 study that &quot;there is no evidence that immigration has negatively impacted on the wages of young or low-skilled natives.&quot; Furthermore, Addison&#x27;s study found that immigration did not increase unemployment among native workers. Rather, immigration decreased unemployment. However, in 2005 the Productivity Commission concluded that higher immigration levels would result in lower wage growth for existing Australian residents. On the impact of immigration on unemployment levels, the Commission said: &quot;The conclusion that immigration has not caused unemployment at an aggregate level does not imply that it cannot lead to higher unemployment for specific groups. Immigration could worsen the labour market outcomes of people who work in sectors of the economy that have high concentrations of immigrant workers.&quot;

Gittins claims there is considerable opposition to immigration in Australia by &quot;battlers&quot; because of the belief that immigrants will steal jobs. Gittins claims though that &quot;it&#x27;s true that immigrants add to the supply of labour. But it&#x27;s equally true that, by consuming and bringing families who consume, they also add to the demand for labour – usually by more.&quot; Overall, Gittins has written that the &quot;economic case for rapid population growth though immigration is surprisingly weak,&quot; noting the diseconomies of scale, infrastructure costs and negative environmental impacts associated with continued immigration-driven population growth.

Robert Birrell has asserted that high immigration levels are being used by the Federal Government to stimulate aggregate economic growth, but that per capita growth is more important to Australians. Birrell concluded that high migration does not benefit existing residents, because it dilutes the benefit that can accrue from the export of non-renewable resources which form a large part of the Australian economy. As well, Birrell argues that a slowdown in labour force growth would require employers to pay greater attention to training, wages and conditions of workers.

===Social cohesion===
The impact that immigration has on social cohesion in Australia is not clear. According to a 2018 report by the Scanlon Report, between 80 and 82% of Australians felt that immigration had a positive impact on Australian society. Australians under the age of 30 were twice as likely to feel positively about immigration as Australians over the age of 60 were. A follow-up report in 2019 found that 85% of Australians polled felt that multiculturalism had made a positive impact on Australia, but 40% admitted negative or very negative feelings towards Muslims.

==Politics and public debate==

Over the last decade, leaders of the major Federal political parties have demonstrated support for high level immigration (including John Howard, Peter Costello and Kim Beazley). There was, overall, an upward trend in the number of immigrants to Australia over the period of the Howard Government (1996–2007). The Rudd Labor Government (elected 2007) increased the quota again once in office. In 2010, both major parties continue to support high immigration, with former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd advocating a &#x27;Big Australia&#x27;; and Opposition Leader Tony Abbott stating in a 2010 Australia Day speech that: &quot;My instinct is to extend to as many people as possible the freedom and benefits of life in Australia&quot;. On 7 August 2018, the Australian Bureau of Statistics population clock reached 25 million 33 years ahead of predictions, with 62% of the growth in the last ten years being a result of immigration.

In 2003, economist Ross Gittins, a columnist at &quot;Fairfax Media&quot;, said former Prime Minister John Howard had been &quot;a tricky chap&quot; on immigration, by appearing &quot;tough&quot; on illegal immigration to win support from the working class, while simultaneously winning support from employers with high legal immigration. In 2006, the Labor Party under Kim Beazley took a stance against the importation of increasingly large numbers of temporary skilled migrant workers by employers, arguing that this is simply a way for employers to drive down wages.

In 2019, a Lowy Institute poll found that 49% of Australians say that ‘the total number of migrants coming to Australia each year is too high’, while a minority said it is ‘too low’ (13%), representing a 10-point rise in opposition to immigration since 2014. Furthermore, 67% say that &#x27;overall, immigration has a positive impact on the economy’, while 65% say that ‘immigrants strengthen the country because of their hard work and talents’, and 62% believe that ‘accepting immigrants from many different countries makes Australia stronger’.

Senator Pauline Hanson has called for a national plebiscite asking voters if they think immigration is too high. The Australian Senate voted the proposal down 54 votes to 2.

Surveys from 2018 and 2023 have found that over 15% polled have shown support for discrimination when it comes to immigration intake. Support for discrimination was higher on basis of religion then race or ethnicity.

<text>Nguyễn Viết Thanh (1931–2 May 1970) was born in Long An, French Indochina. He served in the Vietnam National Army and the Army of the Republic of Vietnam, rising to the Major General.

==Military Career==
Source:
===Vietnam National Army===
Toward the end of March 1951, he was drafted to join the Army and enlisted in the Đà Lạt Military Academy. On 1 April 1951, he joined the Lý Thường Kiệt class which was the 4th class of the academy. He graduated on 1 December 1951, with the rank of second lieutenant.

After graduation, he was appointed platoon commander of the 12th Platoon of the 51st Company of the 15th Battalion of Vietnam which was stationed in Rạch Giá. In late 1952, he was appointed commander of the 51st Company of the 15th Battalion. In June 1953, he was promoted to lieutenant.

In December 1953, he assumed a battalion commander of the 707th Local Battalion.

In early 1955, he was promoted to captain. In April of the same year, he attended the Regiment Commander training at the Center for Military Studies in Sài Gòn.

===Army of the Republic of Vietnam===
In late 1955, Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem changed the name of the Vietnam National Army to the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. He retained the same position in a new military structure.

In early 1956, moving to the field of Military Training, he assumed the Chief of Staff position of the Đà Lạt Military Academy. In the middle of 1956, he left South Vietnam to attend senior infantry training at the United States Army Infantry School at Fort Benning, Georgia, USA.

In early 1957, after completing the training in the US, he was transferred to Thủ Đức Military Academy to hold the position of battalion commander of the 6th class of The Reserve Officer Cadet. On 26 October 1959, National Day of The First Republic, he was promoted to major.

In early 1960, he was transferred to the headquarters to take on the position of Chief of the Defense Planning Department.

In February 1961, transferring to the field of Military Administration, he was appointed major of Long An province.

In mid-1962, he left Long An province to assume the position of Regiment Commander of the 12th Regiment, 7th Infantry Division.

On 20 December 1963 he moved back to the administrative field to be the major of a newly re-established Gò Công province. In February 1964, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel.

In April 1965, he handed over Gò Công province to his successor. Returning to the infantry, he was promoted to Colonel, and he was appointed to be commander of the 7th Infantry Division. Colonel Sidney Bryan Berry, senior adviser to the 7th Division in 1965, had described Thanh as an &quot;aggressive&quot; commander with &quot;sound tactical sense&quot; who &quot;knows when to commit his reserve&quot; and &quot;has a deep understanding of the war and his division.&quot; On June 19, 1966, Armed Forces Day, he was promoted to Brigadier General.

In October 1966, he was appointed head of the delegation along with Brigadier General Phạm Quốc Tâm, commander of the 5th Infantry Division, to guide the delegation on an official visit to Taiwan.

In 1967 he was rated by COMUSMACV General William Westmoreland as the best ARVN division commander. However, Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support (CORDS) advisers differed and in 1967 found &quot;his personal cautiousness and reluctance to push the battalions [those in securing missions] into more offensive activities... difficult to understand,&quot; claiming that he discouraged the initiative and aggressiveness of his subordinates.&quot; CORDS chief Robert Komer agreed and in 1968 described Thanh as unaggressive, unimaginative, and &quot;rather a xenophobe.&quot;

On 19 June 1968, he was promoted to Major general. In early July, he was appointed commander of IV Corps and Fourth Corps Tactical Zone.

Major general George S. Eckhardt, a senior IV Corps adviser in 1968 and 1969, related Thanh&#x27;s popularity when the two generals flew to My Tho, Thanh&#x27;s previous 7th divisional headquarters, for a quiet lunch. When people learned of their presence, they crammed into the restaurant to welcome his return. For over half an hour, &quot;Thanh bowed and shook hands with the stream of well-wishers.&quot; Brigadier General George Wear commented, &quot;When the ARVN troops were well-led they fought as well as anyone&#x27;s soldiers.&quot; Thanh was one such commander.

On 2 May 1970, Thanh flew in a helicopter to direct the Cửu Long (Mekong) offensive operation over the Cambodian border to destroy communist sanctuaries. His helicopter collided in midair with a U.S. AH-1 Cobra attack helicopter inside Cambodia. Thanh was killed aged 39.

According to COMUSMACV General Creighton Abrams, on 20 May 1970 tape, &quot;The handling of the forces and the tactics by all the forces in IV Corps can only be described as brilliant.&quot; Thanh planned the Parrot&#x27;s Beak, Cambodia operation himself and he kept his plan secret from his staff. He only revealed the plan to General Hal D. McCown, senior adviser of Delta Regional Assistance Command. One day before the start of the Cửu Long (Mekong) operation, 1 May 1970, he instructed the 9th division commander on what he wanted him to execute. &quot;It was really beautifully done.&quot;

<text>Carnival of Souls is a 1962 American psychological horror film produced and directed by Herk Harvey and written by John Clifford from a story by Clifford and Harvey, and starring Candace Hilligoss. Its plot follows Mary Henry, a young woman whose life is disturbed after a car accident. She relocates to a new city, where she finds herself unable to assimilate with the locals, and becomes drawn to the pavilion of an abandoned carnival. Director Harvey also appears in the film as a ghoulish stranger who stalks her throughout. The film is set to an organ score by Gene Moore.

Filmed in Lawrence, Kansas, and Salt Lake City, &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; was shot on a budget of $33,000, and Harvey employed various guerrilla filmmaking techniques to finish the production. The film is loosely based on the French short &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot; (1961), an adaptation of the 1890 story of the same name by Ambrose Bierce, and Harvey was inspired by the visual style of filmmakers such as Ingmar Bergman and Jean Cocteau. &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; was Harvey&#x27;s only feature film, and did not gain widespread attention when originally released as a double feature with the now mostly forgotten &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Messenger&quot; in 1962.

Since the 1980s, the film has been noted by critics and film scholars for its cinematography and foreboding atmosphere. The film has a large cult following and is occasionally screened at film and Halloween festivals.

==Plot==

In Kansas, Mary Henry is riding in a car with two other young women when two men challenge them to a road race. During the race, the women&#x27;s car is nudged by the boy&#x27;s and plunges off a bridge into a muddy river. Three hours after the police start dredging the water to look for them, Mary miraculously surfaces on the river bank, but cannot remember how she survived.

Mary moves to Salt Lake City, where she has been hired as a church organist. While driving near an abandoned pavilion on the shores of the Great Salt Lake, Mary begins experiencing visions of a ghoulish, pale-faced figure (referred to as &quot;The Man&quot; in the credits). A gas station attendant tells her the pavilion was first a bathhouse, then a dance hall, and finally a carnival before it was abandoned. In town, Mary rents a room and visits the church where she will be playing the organ. Mary takes a ride out to the pavilion at the lake with the church&#x27;s minister who stops her from entering, warning that it is against the law.

Mary continues experiencing visions of The Man and also rejects the repeated advances of John, a neighboring lodger. Mary goes to the pavilion by herself to investigate but does not find anything. Later, Mary begins experiencing terrifying interludes when she becomes invisible and inaudible to the rest of the world, as if she were not there. During one of these episodes, Mary meets Dr. Samuels, who offers to help her while acknowledging he is not a psychiatrist. Mary returns to the church by herself to practice the organ and finds herself shifting from a hymn to eerie music. In a trance, she sees visions of The Man and other ghouls dancing at the pavilion. The minister, hearing the strange music, denounces it as sacrilege and insists that Mary resign.

That night, Mary accompanies John to a bar. Terrified of being alone with her nightmares, Mary tells John she wants his company. When they return home, John tries to convince Mary to let him stay the night; however, Mary becomes hysterical when she sees The Man in the mirror. John leaves, believing Mary to be insane. The following morning, Mary returns to the pavilion where she encounters The Man and his fellow ghouls. She tries frantically to escape, but the locals do not acknowledge her and she only encounters more ghouls until she wakes up, revealing the previous scene to be merely a nightmare. She is later drawn back to the pavilion once again, where she finds the ghouls dancing, with a ghoul version of herself paired with The Man. She tries to run away but is chased by the ghouls onto the beach, where she collapses as they close in.

The following day, Dr. Samuels, the minister, and the police go to the pavilion to look for Mary. They find her footprints but note that she has otherwise vanished. Back in Kansas, the submerged car is finally pulled from the river. Mary&#x27;s body is seen in the front seat alongside the other two women.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===

Harvey was a director and producer of industrial and educational films based in Lawrence, Kansas, where he worked for the Centron Corporation. While returning to Kansas after shooting a Centron film in California, Harvey developed the idea for &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; after driving past the abandoned Saltair Pavilion in Salt Lake City. &quot;When I got back to Lawrence, I asked my friend and co-worker at Centron Films, John Clifford, who was a writer there, how he&#x27;d like to write a feature,&quot; Harvey recalled. &quot;The last scene, I told him, had to be a whole bunch of ghouls dancing in that ballroom; the rest was up to him. He wrote it in three weeks.&quot;

The screenplay is loosely based on the French short film &quot;An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge&quot; (1961), an adaptation of the 1890 story of the same name by Ambrose Bierce.

===Casting===

In New York City, Harvey discovered then-twenty six year-old actress Candace Hilligoss, who had trained with Lee Strasberg, and cast her in the lead role of Mary Henry. Hilligoss had been offered a role in the Richard Hilliard-directed horror film &quot;Violent Midnight&quot; (1963), but opted for the role in &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;. She stated that at the time, she took the role as a &quot;take-the-money-and-run type of situation&quot;; she was paid approximately $2,000 for her work in the film.

===Filming===
Harvey shot &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; in three weeks on location in Lawrence and Salt Lake City, after taking three weeks off from his job at Centron in order to direct the film, and starting with an initial production budget of $17,000. He raised the $17,000 cash budget by asking local businessmen if they were willing to invest $500 in his production. The other $13,000 of the total $30,000 budget was deferred. Harvey was able to secure the rental of the Saltair Pavilion for $50, and several other scenes, such as the scene featuring Mary in the department store, were shot guerrilla style, with Harvey paying off locals to allow the crew to quickly film. Hilligoss described the filming process as brisk, with the cast and crew working seven days a week.

Harvey aimed for the film to have &quot;the look of Bergman and the feel of Cocteau,&quot; and employed techniques he had learned in his work on industrial films in order to limit production costs. There was not enough money for a process screen to create a rear projection effect, which was the method typically used at that time to create the impression that a scene was taking place inside a moving car, by combining footage shot inside a static car with separate footage of a moving background. Instead, Harvey used a battery-powered hand-held Arriflex camera to film the shots inside moving cars, removing the need for compositing. The Arriflex, which was at that time more often used by cameramen filming newsreel footage, also allowed them to use a moving camera in other scenes without the need for gear like dollies or cranes.

Harvey&#x27;s assistant director was Reza Badiyi, a young Iranian immigrant who was just beginning his film work in the States. At this time, Badiyi had been second-unit director on one other film, Robert Altman&#x27;s directing debut, &quot;The Delinquents&quot;, but would go on to make (amongst other notable work) some of the best-known, iconic television series openings and montages, including &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Get Smart&quot;, and &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show&quot;. The shot in which the face of The Man appears in the car window was accomplished through the use of an angled mirror placed on the far side of the window. The scene at the start of the film in which the car goes off the bridge and into the river was filmed in Lecompton, Kansas. The town did not charge a fee for the use of the bridge, only requiring the film crew to replace the bridge&#x27;s damaged rails once they were done filming. This was done, at a cost of $12 for the repair.

===Musical score===

&quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; features an original organ score by local Kansas City organist and composer Gene Moore. Film and music scholar Julie Brown comments on the score, noting: &quot;The organ is one of the spectral presences in &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot;, summoning up, or being summoned up by, the various allusions in the film to cinema&#x27;s past.&quot; Screenwriter John Clifford has stated that the locations Harvey chose for the film (particularly the Saltair Pavilion, and the grand church organ) influenced the decision to use an organ score. The onscreen depiction of the organ played by Mary was implemented by Harvey to add to the film&#x27;s &quot;Gothic look.&quot;

An original soundtrack album for &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; was released in 1988, featuring Gene Moore&#x27;s original musical score.

In 2023, Waxwork Records licensed the soundtrack rights from Peter Soby and Matthew Irvine and released &quot;Carnival Of Souls&quot; as part of the Rob Zombie Presents soundtrack series. It was pressed on coloured vinyl and housed in special packaging featuring artwork by Graham Humphreys.

==Release==
&quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; had its world premiere at the Main Street Theatre in Lawrence, Kansas, in September 1962. While the US release of &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; failed to include a copyright on the prints, automatically placing them in the public domain, the foreign release marketed by Walter Manley did contain a copyright card and was protected for overseas sales. The 35 mm theatrical prints were cut by Herz-Lion to 78 minutes which trimmed the camera original. However, the 16 mm television copies were printed complete and individually cut by each station to fit their time slot, which is why they vary in length.

WOR-TV in New York City used to broadcast the film intact in a late night timeslot in the 1960s. The scenes cut by the theatrical distributor include a scene where Mary stops at a gas station and discusses the carnival building with the attendant, a longer dialogue sequence between the organ factory boss and a carpenter and an extra scene where the doctor talks to the landlady. In 1989, the film was screened at festivals across Europe and the United States, affording it renewed public interest, and it has subsequently appeared at numerous Halloween film festivals.

Prints of &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; vary in length from 78 minutes in theatrical release to 84 minutes in the original cut. While some sources have erroneously listed the film at a 91-minute-runtime, Michael Weldon stated in &quot;The Psychotronic Video Guide to Film&quot; that the original theatrical cut of the film ran approximately 80 minutes. He also stated that the director&#x27;s cut, which runs 84 minutes, is &quot;the best and most complete version we&#x27;ll ever see.&quot;

===Reception and legacy===
&quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; went largely unnoticed by critics upon its initial release and received &quot;delayed acclaim&quot; in the ensuing decades, with numerous arthouse screenings in 1989 in conjunction with the Halloween season. It has since become regarded by many film schools as a classic, often praised for its lighting and sound design, in which &quot;sight and sound come together... in a horrifying way.&quot; Some scholars, such as S. S. Prawer, consider &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; more an art film than a straightforward horror film. The &quot;Time Out&quot; film guide commended the film&#x27;s &quot;striking black-and-white compositions, disorienting dream sequences and eerie atmosphere,&quot; adding that the film &quot;has the feel of a silent German expressionist movie. Unfortunately, so does some of the acting, which suffers from exaggerated facial expressions and bizarre gesturing. But the mesmerising power of the carnival and dance-hall sequences far outweighs the corniness of the awkward intimate scenes.&quot;

Leonard Maltin gave &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; a score of two-and-a-half out of four stars, calling the film an &quot;eerie&quot; and &quot;imaginative low budget effort.&quot; Critic Roger Ebert likened the film to a &quot;lost episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;,&quot; and noted that it possessed an &quot;intriguing power.&quot; Joe Brown of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; remarked upon the film&#x27;s cinematography, writing: &quot;Harvey&#x27;s camerawork gives a new twist to the word &#x27;deadpan,&#x27; making the most mundane places and people imaginable seem like ghastly hallucinations, and the director shows a flair for elegantly employing existing locations and lighting for maximum disorientation value.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; saw the 1989 screening at the Fantasy Festival and wrote: &quot;What has earned &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; its reputation is the director&#x27;s knack for building a mood of fatalistic angst.&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;″ Peter Rainer perceived the film&#x27;s cinematography to be inconsistent in merit, called the acting &quot;fairly amateurish to begin with, [and] has a one-take-only quality&quot;, and noted the &quot;inept post-dubbing&quot;; however, he wrote that &quot;these rinky-dink elements only add to the horror.&quot;

&quot;TV Guide&quot; gave &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; a score of three stars out of four, praising the film&#x27;s atmosphere, acting, and eerie score, calling it, &quot;A chilling ghost story with artistic pretensions.&quot; &quot;Film Reel.com&quot; gave &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; a positive review, praising the film&#x27;s atmosphere, slow-building tension, and disturbing visuals.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 87% based on , with a rating average of 7.2/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states that the film &quot;offers delightfully chilling proof that when it comes to telling an effective horror story, less can often be much, much more&quot;.

Some observers have noted that the movie&#x27;s undead strongly influenced Night of the Living Dead by George Romero, and the abandoned pavilion&#x27;s similarity to the Overlook Hotel in The Shining by Stanley Kubrick.

=== Rights ===
Although some believe that &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; is in the public domain, the original filmmakers received official copyright status on the film in 1987 in the names of Harold Harvey and John W. Clifford, under copyright registration number PAO1-230-677, in the Office of the United States Register of Copyrights, Washington, D.C. John W. Clifford also has a copyright as an unpublished manuscript his original screenplay (copyright # PAU2-064-013). Clifford and Harvey were legally able to copyright their film because the original distributor, Harcourt Productions, never filed for copyright in 1962. The film, including the original negative and a handful of surviving prints and outtakes were purchased from the filmmakers, along with all rights, by Peter Soby and Matthew Irvine of Chicago West Entertainment in January 1997.

===Home media===
&quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; has been released in a significant number of formats through numerous distributors, which, according to film scholars Chris Vander Kaay and Kathleen Fernandez-Vander Kaay, has ensured it &quot;a constant presence in the video market and [contributed to] its enduring cult popularity.&quot; The Criterion Collection licensed the official copyright version of the film from Peter Soby and Matthew Irvine and issued a 2-disc DVD set of the film in 2000, featuring both a 78-minute theatrical version and an extended 84-minute director&#x27;s cut. In 2009, Legend Films released the film on DVD featuring both the black-and-white and a colorized version of the directors cut, including an audio commentary track by comedian Michael J. Nelson, a former writer and host of &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot;. In 2016, the Criterion Collection reissued the film on DVD, as well as premiering it on Blu-ray, featuring a new restoration.

&quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; has gradually developed a cult following since its release and is now considered a low-budget classic. The film has since been included in multiple lists by various media outlets as one of the greatest horror films ever made. &quot;Complex&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; number 39 on its list of the 50 scariest movies ever made. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; placed the film at #32 on its &quot;100 Best Horror Movies of All Time&quot;. &quot;Paste&quot; magazine ranked the film at #85 in its list of &quot;100 Best Horror Movies of All Time&quot;.

In 2012, the Academy Film Archive restored &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; alongside Peter Soby and Matthew Irvine. They also keep the original negatives stored in their facilities. The film has been named as a precursor to the works of various filmmakers, including David Lynch, George A. Romero, Lucrecia Martel and James Wan.

The film was used for a RiffTrax Live event in October 2016, where former &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; cast members Bill Corbett, Kevin Murphy and Michael J. Nelson riffed the film for a live audience and broadcast to other theaters through NCM Fathom. Rifftrax&#x27;s website offers the video downloads of the live performance as well as a studio-recorded riff of the film.

A novelization of the film titled &quot;Nightmare Pavilion&quot; written by Andrew J. Rausch was released by Happy Cloud Media in October 2020.

===Remakes===

There has yet to be a true remake of the original, however Peter Soby negotiated &quot;based on&quot; rights of &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; with the writer, John Clifford, and the director Herk Harvey which led in 1998 to a &quot;based on&quot; film entitled &#x27;Wes Craven Presents Carnival of Souls&quot; directed by Adam Grossman and Anthony Hickox and starring Bobbie Phillips. This &quot;based on&quot; film has little in common with the 1962 film, borrowing little more than the revelation at the end. Sidney Berger, who had appeared in the original film as John Linden, appeared in a cameo in the remake. The remake followed the story of a young woman (Phillips) and her confrontation with her mother&#x27;s murderer. According to Candace Hilligoss, the filmmakers had asked for her, the star of the first film, to also appear, but she declined, feeling that Clifford and the filmmakers of the remake had shown disrespect to her in initiating the film without consulting her or considering her treatment for a sequel to the 1962 version. Peter Soby actually wanted Hilligoss to be a part of the &quot;based on&quot; film as a producer and to have a role in the film, however, she had written her own script on spec entitled &quot;Carnival of Souls II&quot; which Soby, Harvey and Clifford felt was not the right tone. It was centered on her character from the original film, Mary Henry, coming back as a ghost 35 years later and falling in love with a younger man. Candace refused to be a part of the new production if it wasn&#x27;t her script, so unfortunately Soby, who officially acquired the rights from Harvey and Clifford, had to part ways with her. The &quot;based on&quot; film was marketed as &quot;Wes Craven Presents &#x27;Carnival of Souls″&quot; because Soby negotiated with TriMark Pictures to contractually agree to make a film &quot;based on&quot; the original and not a remake with the same title. It received negative appraisals from most reviewers and did not manage to secure theatrical release, going direct-to-video.

===In popular culture===
When Mary is speaking to the manager of the organ factory at the beginning of the film, he says to her: &quot;It takes more than intellect to be a musician. Put your soul into it. OK?&quot; This sample was used on the 1998 song &quot;Church of Noise&quot; by the Northern Irish rock band Therapy?.

Mary laments towards the end of the film: &quot;I don&#x27;t belong in the world, that&#x27;s what it is. Something separates me from other people. Everywhere I turn, there&#x27;s something blocking my escape.&quot; A sample of this line was used at the beginning of the Lana Del Rey song &quot;13 Beaches&quot; on her album &quot;Lust for Life&quot; (2017).

Clips of the film were used throughout the Drake video &quot;Knife Talk&quot;.

Clips of the film were also used by the band Why These Coyotes for their song Dance Around the Fire.

The dancehall scenes featured at the end of the film were referenced in the music video for Phoebe Bridgers&#x27; &quot;Smoke Signals&quot;.

Peter Soby licensed the official perfume rights to Marissa Zappas who released the official &quot;Carnival of Souls&quot; perfume on October 31, 2024.

<text>Wilson Airport is an airport in Nairobi, Kenya. It has flights to many regional airports in Kenya while Nairobi&#x27;s main airport, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, serves domestic and many international destinations.

==Location==
Wilson Airport, is in Nairobi County, in the city of Nairobi, the capital of Kenya and the largest metropolitan centre in that country. It lies approximately , by road, south of the central business district. Nearby suburbs include Langata, South C, and Kibera.

This location is approximately , by road, west of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, the largest civilian airport in the country.

==Overview==
The airport serves domestic and international traffic. It is used mostly by general aviation traffic. Industries that use Wilson Airport extensively include tourism, health care and agriculture. Wilson Airport averages traffic of around 120,000 landings and take-offs annually.

Airkenya and other small airlines use Wilson Airport for scheduled domestic passenger services, instead of Jomo Kenyatta International Airport. Missionary aviation operators AMREF, Mission Aviation Fellowship (MAF) and AIM AIR use Wilson Airport as their airport base on the African continent. It is used also for flight training. The airport is under the supervision of Kenya Airports Authority (KAA).

As a result of faster check-in times and fewer flight delays, as compared to Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, Wilson Airport is commonly used by business executive aircraft for domestic and international travel. Common domestic destinations from Wilson Airport include Kisumu Airport, Mombasa International Airport and Eldoret International Airport.

At above sea level, Wilson Airport has two asphalt runways: Runway 1 (heading 07/25) measures long and wide; Runway 2 (heading 14/32) measures long and wide.

==History==
The airport was established as Nairobi West Aerodrome in 1929 by Florence Kerr Wilson, a wealthy widow. Built at a cost of £50,000 (£3.2 million in 2020), Mrs Wilson hired pilot Tom Campbell Black to run the airport. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the airport, its aircraft fleet and its pilots were taken over by the then colonial government and made a Royal Air Force base until after the war when it continued functioning as a civilian airport. In 1962, it was named Wilson Airport in honour of its founder who died in 1968.

==Airlines and destinations==
==Accidents and incidents==
*On 24 December 1968, a Douglas C-47A 5Y-ADI of the Kenya Police Air Wing crashed shortly after takeoff. The incident was attributed to inadequately secured cargo. All three people on board were killed.
* On 11 October 2019, a Silverstone Air Services Fokker 50 registration 5Y-IZO operating flight 620 to Mombasa, Kenya, overran the runway on takeoff from Wilson. The aircraft was extensively damaged but there were no fatalities.
* On 5 March 2024, a Safarilink Aviation de Havilland Dash 8-300, registration 5Y-SLK, shortly after takeoff from Wilson collided with a Cessna 172, registration 5Y-NNJ, operated by a local flying school. The Cessna crashed and the two occupants were killed. The Dash 8 had minor damage and landed back at Wilson with no casualties.

Holcombe was born in Mobile, Alabama, and raised in San Antonio, Texas. He moved to Houston when he was 18, and founded his own construction business, the O. F. Holcombe Company, at age 26. His business acumen and contacts eventually made Holcombe a millionaire.

Six years after founding his business, in 1921, Holcombe won his first term as mayor. He served as mayor from 1921 to 1929. Holcombe was defeated in the 1929 election by Walter Monteith, who supported a more fiscally conservative approach. Holcombe ran for mayor again in 1931, promising to do more for the unemployed, but Monteith was elected again.

Holcombe served subsequent mayoral terms from 1933 to 1937, 1939 to 1941, 1947 to 1953, and 1956 to 1958. His administrations were considered to be conservative and pro-business, though Holcombe was also aggressive about expanding the city&#x27;s boundaries and improving public services (such as libraries, a municipal auditorium, and an improved sewage system).

Holcombe married Mary Grey Miller on May 3, 1912. They had one daughter, Elisabeth, who married Henry Markley Crosswell, Jr.

==Honors==
During the early 1960s, Houston renamed the stretch of Bellaire Boulevard east of Southside Place, which runs through the Texas Medical Center, as Holcombe Boulevard. In the late 1980s, the municipality of West University Place also renamed Bellaire Boulevard as Holcombe Boulevard within its jurisdiction.

<text>Pedro Moraes Trindade, commonly known as Mestre Moraes, (born February 9, 1950, in Ilha de Maré in Salvador, Brazil) is a master of capoeira.

He lives in Salvador, Bahia, teaching at a public school and overseeing GCAP, which serves as a cultural outreach project, training both older visiting students and children who lack direction for channeling their energies.

Meste Moraes was student of João Grande and the teacher of Cobra Mansa.

== Biography ==

Moraes was born on the island of Maré in the Bay of All The Saints, one of the legendary locations celebrated in capoeira songs, and was raised in Salvador.

His father was also a practitioner of capoeira Angola, the traditional style of Bahia.

=== In Pastinha&#x27;s academy ===

At the age of eight, he started to train at the academy of Mestre Pastinha. By that time Pastinha was blind with and no longer taught classes, so academy was run by his students João Grande and João Pequeno. He states that he is truly the student of João Grande due to the impression made on the young Moraes by the inspiring way that João Grande played capoeira.

=== Rio years ===

Moraes joined the Marines and was relocated to Rio de Janeiro in the early 1970s. By 1974, he had already begun instructing capoeira Angola in the northern suburb of Belfort Roxo. He also led the &quot;Modá-Ruê&quot; group, which taught residents of Rio de Janeiro about &#x27;Northeastern folklore,&#x27; encompassing practices like maculelê, samba de roda, puxada de rede, and even &quot;lamento africano&quot;. To preserve and transmit his mentors&#x27; teachings, he founded &quot;Grupo Capoeira Angola Pelourinho&quot; (GCAP) in 1980.

What set Moraes apart from many other Bahians in Rio was his unwavering commitment to playing Angola, even when faced with practitioners of different styles, whether they were ring fighters or swift athletes from Senzala. According to Mestre Marco Aurélio, word spread about &quot;an African was visiting the rodas of the city, who played a different capoeira&quot;. Salvadorian capoeiristas visiting Rio often found themselves facing aggressive opponents focused on efficiency rather than ritualistic, playful games. When Moraes played, he didn&#x27;t rely on high-kick sequences but consistently adhered to the inner game of Angola, known as &quot;jogo de dentro&quot;. Moraes not only skillfully avoided kicks but sometimes even &#x27;slapped the guy on his bottom’.

=== Back to Salvador ===

In 1982, Moraes and his top student, Cobra Mansa, relocated to Salvador. Following Pastinha&#x27;s passing in 1981, capoeira Angola appeared to be heading towards extinction, as many older mestres had retired or significantly embraced the regional style.

Moraes and Cobrinha Mansa&#x27;s return revitalized the Salvador capoeira community. At the time, capoeira Angola was often seen as an art for elderly men. However, their youthful presence challenged this notion and showcased potential of capoeira angola. Mestre João Grande even agreed to teach again for GCAP after a six-year absence.

The group not only focused on capoeira but also capoeira history and black culture. His aim was to return to capoeira&#x27;s African, specifically Angolan roots. Moraes is a strong advocate of the Angola style of capoeira, and believes that the source of capoeira is the &quot;n&#x27;golo&quot;, ritual combat performed by Bantu people in southwestern Angola.

Moraes codified the Angolan musical style, and defined its basic instrumental ensemble, and requires GCAP&#x27;s members to be versed in all aspects of capoeira Angola&#x27;s music.

<doc id="1100733" wikidata="Q285136" url="?curid=1100733" title="VU meter">
<text>A volume unit (VU) meter or standard volume indicator (SVI) is a device displaying a representation of the signal level in audio equipment. 

The original design was proposed in the 1940 IRE paper, &quot;A New Standard Volume Indicator and Reference Level&quot;, written by experts from CBS, NBC, and Bell Telephone Laboratories. The Acoustical Society of America then standardized it in 1942 (ANSI C16.5-1942) for use in telephone installation and radio broadcast stations. 

Consumer audio equipment often features VU meters, both for utility purposes (e.g. in recording equipment) and for aesthetics (in playback devices).

The original VU meter is a passive electromechanical device, namely a 200 μA DC d&#x27;Arsonval movement ammeter fed from a full-wave copper-oxide rectifier mounted within the meter case. The mass of the needle causes a relatively slow response, which in effect integrates or smooths the signal, with a rise time of 300 ms. This has the effect of averaging out peaks and troughs of short duration, and reflects the perceived loudness of the material more closely than the more modern and initially more expensive PPM meters. For this reason many audio practitioners prefer the VU meter to its alternatives, though the meter indication does not reflect some of the key features of the signal, most notably its peak level, which in many cases, must not pass a defined limit.

0 VU is equal to +4 dBu, or 1.228 volts RMS, a power of about 2.5 milliwatts when applied across a 600-ohm load. 0 VU is often referred to as &quot;0 dB&quot;. The meter was designed not to measure the signal, but to let users aim the signal level to a target level of 0 VU (sometimes labelled 100%), so it is not important that the device is non-linear and imprecise for low levels. In effect, the scale ranges from −20 VU to +3 VU, with −3 VU right in the middle (half the power of 0 VU). Purely electronic devices may emulate the response of the needle; they are VU-meters in as much as they respect the standard.

In the broadcast industry, loudness monitoring was standardized, in 2009 in the United States by the ATSC A/85, in 2010 in Europe by the EBU R 128, in 2011 in Japan by the TR-B32, and in 2010 in Australia by the OP-59.

== Lead ==
The original designers of the VU meter were tasked with finding a way to measure complex audio signals with a simple technology.

Since a VU meter is a mechanical device, it can never reflect the instantaneous signal peaks of complex audio signals. The designers of the VU meter therefore took a different approach. They created a meter that did &quot;not&quot; measure peaks, but simply inferred them. A real VU meter has a very specific &quot;ballistic characteristic&quot;. This means that it responds to changing audio signals at a very precise speed, rising from no signal to 99% of &quot;0 VU&quot; when a 1 kHz sine wave tone is applied for 300 milliseconds.

When using a VU meter, the audio system is calibrated with a sine wave tone at a &quot;reference level&quot; for the system. At the reference level, the VU meter shows &quot;0&quot; for a sine-wave tone, but the engineer must know that, with music or speech, to always infer that peak levels are always between 6 dB and 10 dB higher than the reference level. The usefulness of the VU meter comes from the fact that for most types of audio sources the system engineer can count on these peaks being within this range and can design the audio system with confidence. Good engineering practice is to always build in a little extra &quot;headroom&quot;, as it is called, to cover the strange conditions where an audio signal might exceed normal peak levels or the equipment operator fails to adjust the levels correctly. Typically the levels considered when designing systems using a VU meter are: 
* Reference level (typically +4 dBu, valid with tones only);
* Standard output level (10 dB above reference, typical peak levels);
* Clip level (6 dB above standard output level, &quot;headroom&quot; to allow for unusual conditions)

== Standard characteristics ==

The behaviour of VU meters is defined in ANSI C16.5-1942, British Standard BS 6840, and IEC 60268-17.

=== Reference level ===
=== Rise time ===
The rise time, defined as the time it takes for the needle to reach 99% of the distance to 0 VU when the VU-meter is submitted to a signal that steps from 0 to a level that reads 0 VU, is 300 ms.

The overshoot must be within 1 to 1.5%.

The fall time is the same as the rise time, 300 ms.

=== Frequency response ===

The level specification is meant at 1000 Hz. The reading should not depart from the reading at 1000 Hz by more than 0.2 dB from 35 Hz to 10 kHz or more than 0.5 dB between 25 Hz and 16 kHz.

Note that the specification mentions only sinusoid waveforms. Given the electromechanical principle of the meter, the deviation of the needle is actually approximately proportional to the &quot;average&quot; of the part of the signal with more than approximately 0.4 V instantaneously because of the two copper-oxide rectifiers always in series, which transfer function curve has a knee around 0.2 V. Signals generally do not have a sinusoidal waveform by far, even if they all fall within the VU-meter bandpass. The reading is the average of the voltage, and is not an indication of the power of the signal, which is proportional to the average of the square of the voltage, or the root-mean-square (RMS) value. As a conventional &quot;VU reading&quot;, however, it served its purpose as an indication a) of the overall level and dynamics of the signal and b) of the proximity to the maximum admitted level, to the operators of recording and broadcasting equipment. Maintenance staff could also use it as a measurement apparatus, to check for losses in transmissions and level alignment, provided that they used exclusively sine waves as test signals.

=== Impedance ===
The VU meter and its attenuator should present a 7,500-ohm impedance to the circuit it is applied to, measured with a sinusoid signal that sets the indicator to 0 dB.

== History ==

The VU-meter was originally developed in 1939 by the combined effort of Bell Labs and broadcasters CBS and NBC. In the 1970s–80s, neon-filled, planar dual displays with up to 201 segments per stereo channel were popular among broadcasters as fast bar graph VU meters.

== Other level meters ==
The consumer audio industry often uses volume indicators that do not comply with any standard. 

BBC sound engineers would refer to the VU meter as the &quot;Virtually Useless&quot; meter, preferring the PPM.

Academic research has shown that an SVI or VU meter behaves differently to the average value and RMS meters. The ballistics shown by this instrument, in response to signals with a large crest factor, position its readings halfway between both. For example, an increment of 3 dB in the crest factor of an audio signal gives approximately a fall of −3 dB in a RMS meter, −6 dB in an average meter, and −4 dB in a VU meter.

<doc id="1100734" wikidata="Q13474384" url="?curid=1100734" title="Absolute idealism">
<text>Absolute idealism is chiefly associated with Friedrich Schelling and G. W. F. Hegel, both of whom were German idealist philosophers in the 19th century. The label has also been attached to others such as Josiah Royce, an American philosopher who was greatly influenced by Hegel&#x27;s work, and the British idealists. 

According to Hegel, being is ultimately comprehensible only as an all-inclusive whole (&quot;das Absolute&quot;). Hegel asserted that in order for the thinking subject (human reason or consciousness) to be able to know its object (the world) at all, there must be in some sense an identity of thought and being. Otherwise, the subject would never have access to the object and we would have no certainty about any of our knowledge of the world. 

The absolute idealist position dominated philosophy in nineteenth-century Britain and Germany, while exerting significantly less influence in the United States. The absolute idealist position should be distinguished from the subjective idealism of Berkeley, the transcendental idealism of Kant, or the post-Kantian transcendental idealism (also known as &quot;critical idealism&quot;) of Fichte and of the early Schelling.

==Schelling and Hegel&#x27;s concepts of the absolute==
According to the scholar Andrew Bowie, Hegel&#x27;s system depends upon showing how each view and positing of how the world is really has an internal contradiction: &quot;This necessarily leads thought to more comprehensive ways of grasping the world, until the point where there can be no more comprehensive way because there is no longer any contradiction to give rise to it.&quot;

For Hegel, the interaction of opposites generates, in a dialectical fashion, all concepts necessary to comprehend what is. 

For Kant, reason was only for us, and the categories only emerged within the subject. However, for Hegel, reason is fully immanent. Spirit emerges from nature in history and, in art, religion, and philosophy, knows itself in its truth. 

Hegel shows that the world is not other than self. With the realization that mind and world are, by logical necessity, meaningfully coherent, our access to the world is made secure, a security that was lost in Kant&#x27;s proclamation that the thing-in-itself was ultimately inaccessible.

Hegel&#x27;s position is a critical transformation of the concept of the absolute advanced by Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling (1775–1854), who argued for a philosophy of Identity; as articulated by Bowie:

For Schelling, the absolute is a causeless &#x27;ground&#x27; upon which relativity (difference and similarity) can be discerned by human judgement (and thus permit &#x27;freedom&#x27; itself) and this ground must be simultaneously not of the &#x27;particular&#x27; world of finites, but also not wholly different from them (or else there would be no commensurability with empirical reality, objects, sense data, etc. to be compared as &#x27;relative&#x27; or otherwise).

In both Schelling and Hegel&#x27;s systems (especially the latter), the project aims towards a completion of metaphysics. As Redding describes it: &quot;While opinions divide as to how Hegel&#x27;s approach to logic relates to that of Kant, it is important to grasp that for Hegel logic is not simply a science of the form of our thoughts. It is also a science of actual &quot;content&quot; as well, and as such has an ontological dimension.&quot;

For Schelling, reason was an organic &#x27;striving&#x27; in nature, and this striving was one in which the subject and the object approached an identity. Schelling saw reason as the link between spirit and the phenomenal world, as Lauer explains: &quot;For Schelling [...] nature is not the negative of reason, to be submitted to it as reason makes the world its home, but has since its inception been turning itself into a home for reason.&quot; 

Hegel&#x27;s doubts about intellectual intuition&#x27;s ability to prove or legitimate that the particular is in identity with whole led him to progressively formulate a speculative dialectic in which concepts like &quot;Aufhebung&quot; came to be articulated. Beiser summarizes the early formulation as follows:

a) Some finite concept, true of only a limited part of reality, would go beyond its limits in attempting to know all of reality. It would claim to be an adequate concept to describe the absolute because, like the absolute, it has a complete or self-sufficient meaning independent of any other concept. 

b) This claim would come into conflict with the fact that the concept depends for its meaning on some other concept, having meaning only in contrast to its negation. There would then be a contradiction between its claim to independence and its de facto dependence upon another concept. 

c) The only way to resolve the contradiction would be to reinterpret the claim to independence, so that it applies not just to one concept to the exclusion of the other but to the whole of both concepts. Of course, the same stages could be repeated on a higher level, and so on, until we come to the complete system of all concepts, which is alone adequate to describe the absolute.

Hegel&#x27;s innovation in German Idealism was to theorize a historical mode of self-consciousness self-reflection capable of generating a more inclusively holistic understanding of what it ultimately means to be rational in the grand scheme of things.

==Absolute idealism in Britain==

By the beginning of the 19th century, German idealist philosophy, particularly that of Kant, Hegel, and Fichte, was being read by British philosophers. Figures such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Thomas Carlyle, and J. F. Ferrier, found in idealism an alternative and a response to the then-dominant empiricist views in Britain. Early authors such as James Hutchison Stirling not only attempted to introduce German idealist thought to Britain, but sought to present their own version of absolute idealism in an English medium. 

Edward Caird and T.H. Green were of the first generation of British idealists who took the work of Hegel and some of his successors and, from their positions as professors at the universities of Glasgow and Oxford, respectively, influenced generations of students. Absolute idealism was more fully developed in a second generation by their students, especially F.H. Bradley and Bernard Bosanquet. Bradley&#x27;s 1893 &quot;Appearance and Reality&quot; and Bosanquet&#x27;s two volumes of Gifford lectures, &quot;The Principle of Individuality and Value&quot; (1912) and &quot;The Value and Destiny of the Individual&quot; were the most influential volumes of absolute idealism of the period. British absolute idealism had an influence not only within philosophy, but in theology, politics, and social and public policy. Moreover, many of the students of the idealists, in turn, introduced absolute idealism to Canada, southern Africa, and India.

==Reactions==

Absolute idealism has greatly altered the philosophical landscape. This influence is mostly felt in the strong opposition it engendered. Both logical positivism and analytic philosophy grew out of a rebellion against Hegelianism prevalent in England during the 19th century. Continental phenomenology, existentialism, and postmodernism also seek to &#x27;free themselves from Hegel&#x27;s thought&#x27;. 

Martin Heidegger, one of the leading figures of Continental philosophy in the 20th century, sought to distance himself from Hegel&#x27;s work. One of Heidegger&#x27;s philosophical themes in &quot;Being and Time&quot; was &quot;overcoming metaphysics,&quot; aiming to distinguish his book from Hegelian tracts. After the 1927 publication, Heidegger&#x27;s &quot;early dismissal of them [German idealists] gives way to ever-mounting respect and critical engagement.&quot; He continued to compare and contrast his philosophy with Absolute idealism, principally due to critical comments that certain elements of this school of thought anticipated Heideggerian notions of &quot;overcoming metaphysics.&quot;

<text>Leopold III (, , 1073 – 15 November 1136), known as Leopold the Good, was the Margrave of Austria from 1095 to his death in 1136. He was a member of the House of Babenberg. He was canonized on 6 January 1485 and became the patron saint of Austria, Lower Austria, Upper Austria and Vienna. His feast day is 15 November.

==Biography==
Leopold was born at Babenberg castle in Gars am Kamp, the son of Margrave Leopold II and Ida of Formbach-Ratelnberg. The Babenbergs had come to Austria from Bavaria where the family had risen to prominence in the 10th century. He grew up in the diocese of Passau under the influence of the reformer bishop Altmann of Passau. 

In 1096, Leopold succeeded his father as margrave of Austria at the age of 23. He married twice. His first wife, who died in 1105, may have been one of the von Perg family. The following year he married Agnes, the widowed sister of Emperor Henry V whom he had supported against her father Henry IV. This connection to the Salians raised the importance of the House of Babenberg, to which important royal rights over the margraviate of Austria were granted. Also, Agnes had influential connections through her previous marriage to Frederick of Hohenstaufen, one of her sons being Conrad III of Germany.

Leopold called himself &quot;Princeps Terræ&quot;, a reflection of his sense of territorial independence. He was considered a candidate in the election of the Kaiser of the Holy Roman Empire in 1125, but declined this honour.

He is mainly remembered for the development of the country and, in particular, the founding of several monasteries. His most important foundation is Klosterneuburg (1108). According to legend, the Virgin Mary appeared to him and led him to a place where he found the veil of his wife Agnes, who had lost it years earlier. He established the Klosterneuburg Monastery there. He subsequently expanded the settlement to become his residence.

Leopold also founded the monasteries of Heiligenkreuz, Kleinmariazell and Seitenstetten which developed a territory still largely covered by forest. All of these induced the church to canonize him in 1485.

Leopold also fostered the development of cities, such as Klosterneuburg, Vienna and Krems. The last one was granted the right to mint but never attained great importance.

The writings of Henry of Melk and Ava of Göttweig, which are the first literary texts from Austria, date back to Leopold&#x27;s time.

He is buried in the Klosterneuburg Monastery, which he founded. His skull is kept in an embroidered reliquary, which leaves the forehead exposed; it also wears an archducal hat.

In 1663, under the rule of his namesake Emperor Leopold I, he was declared patron saint of Austria instead of Coloman of Stockerau.

The brothers Joseph and Michael Haydn, each of whom sang in the choir of St. Stephen&#x27;s Cathedral, both sang in that capacity at Klosterneuburg on this day. Joseph Haydn later became the more famous composer of the two. Michael Haydn later (in 1805) wrote a mass in honour of Leopold, the &quot;Missa sub titulo Sancti Leopoldi.&quot;

Since the death of Emperor Leopold I, the King&#x27;s Feast is celebrated in Belgium on Leopold&#x27;s feast day.

==Children==
His first marriage, to Maria/Adelheid von Perg, was childless.

By his second wife, Agnes of Germany, widow of Frederick I, Duke of Swabia:
* Adalbert
* Henry II Jasomirgott (1107–1177)
* Leopold IV ( 1108 – 1141)
* Berta, m. Henry III, Burgrave of Regensburg
* Agnes (c. 1108/13 – c. 1160/63), m. Władysław II of Poland
* Ernst
* Uta, m. Luitpold I, Count of Plain
* Otto of Freising (c. 1114 – 1158), Bishop of Freising, and biographer of his nephew (from his mother&#x27;s first marriage), Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa
* Conrad, Bishop of Passau and Archbishop of Salzburg
* Elisabeth, m. Hermann II of Winzenburg
* Judith, m. William V of Montferrat
* Gertrude, m. Duke (later King) Vladislaus II of Bohemia
According to the &quot;Continuation of the Chronicles of Klosterneuburg&quot;, there may have been up to seven others (possibly from multiple births) stillborn or who died in infancy.

In 2013, documentation regarding the results of DNA testing of the remains of the family buried in Klosterneuburg &amp; Heiligenkreuz strongly favor that Adalbert was the son of Leopold and Agnes.

<text>Newmont Corporation is an American gold mining company based in Greenwood Village, Colorado. 
It is the world&#x27;s largest gold mining corporation. Incorporated in 1921, it owns gold mines in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Australia, Ghana, Argentina, Peru, and Suriname. In addition to gold, Newmont mines copper, silver, zinc and lead.

The Newmont Corporation bought Canadian mining company, Goldcorp in 2019 for USD $10 billion.

In 2023, Newmont acquired Newcrest mining for USD $16.8 billion.

Newmont has approximately 31,600 employees and contractors worldwide, and is the only gold company in the S&amp;P 500 stock market index.

== History ==

===Early years===

The Newmont Company was founded in 1916 in New York by Colonel William Boyce Thompson as a holding company to invest in Worldwide mineral, oil, and related companies. According to company lore, the name &quot;Newmont&quot; is a portmanteau &quot;New York&quot; and &quot;Montana&quot;, reflecting where Thompson made his fortune and where he grew up. Newmont made its first major gold investment in 1917, with a founding 25 percent in the Anglo American Corporation of South Africa. Four years later, in 1921, the Newmont Company reincorporated as the Newmont Corporation.
In 1929, Newmont became a mining company with its first gold product in by acquiring California&#x27;s Empire Star Mine. By 1939, Newmont was operating 12 gold mines in North America.

The company acquired interests overseas. For decades around the middle of the 20th century, Newmont had a controlling interest in the Tsumeb mine in Namibia and in the O&#x27;Okiep Copper Company in Namaqualand, South Africa.

Beginning in 1925, Newmont acquired interests in a Texas oil field. Eventually, Newmont&#x27;s oil interests included more than 70 blocks in the Louisiana, Gulf of Mexico area and oil and gas production in the North Sea.

Fred Searls became president in 1947, after serving as the company&#x27;s exploration geologist. Searls retired in 1954, and Plato Malozemoff took over as president.

Newmont began mining at Carlin, Nevada, in 1965. The &quot;Carlin Trend&quot; or &quot;Carlin Unconformity&quot; is the largest gold discovery in North America during the 20th century. In 1971 Newmont began heap leaching low grade ores there.

In 1971, the South-West African (now Namibia) Tsumeb &amp; Kombat mines managed by Newmont, had its operations stopped during the 1971–72 Namibian contract workers strike over the contract labor system and apartheid.

===Major growth===
In the 1980s, Newmont thwarted five takeover bids – from Consolidated Gold Fields (ConsGold), T. Boone Pickens, Minorco, Hanson Industries and James Goldsmith – who sought to break Newmont apart and sell its assets to increase shareholder value.

In 1987, defending against a $6.3 billion bid by T. Boone Pickens, the company paid a US$33 per share special dividend to all shareholders, US$2.2 billion in cash, of which US$1.75 billion was borrowed. To reduce this debt the company undertook a divestment program involving all of its copper, oil, gas, and coal interests.

As a further step in the restructuring, the company moved its headquarters from New York City to Denver in 1988. A decade later, Newmont Mining Corporation and Newmont Gold Company combined assets to form a unified worldwide gold company. Shareholders of both companies had identical interests in the reserves, production and earnings of Newmont Gold&#x27;s operations.

Newmont then merged with Santa Fe Railroad (a former Atchison, Topeka &amp; Santa Fe Railway subsidiary, sold in preparation for the merger that produced the BNSF) to form North America&#x27;s largest gold producer.

On June 21, 2000, Newmont announced a merger with Battle Mountain Gold. The merger was completed in January 2001.

In February 2002, Newmont completed the acquisition of Normandy Mining and Franco-Nevada. Newmont faced competition in its bid for Normandy from AngloGold. By eventually outbidding the South African company, Newmont became the world&#x27;s largest gold producer, with an annual production in excess of 8 million ounces.

In 2007, the company eliminated its 1.5 million ounce legacy hedge book to make Newmont the world&#x27;s largest unhedged gold producer. The following year, Newmont acquired Miramar Mining Corporation and its Hope Bay deposit in the Canadian Arctic.

In 2009, Newmont purchased the remaining one-third interest in Boddington Gold Mine from AngloGold Ashanti, bringing its ownership to 100 percent.

In April 2011, the company acquired Canada&#x27;s Fronteer Gold Inc. for CA$2.3 billion. This made the company the world&#x27;s second-largest gold producer.

In 2017, Newmont produced 5.65 million ounces of gold at all-in sustaining costs of US$924 per ounce. The company reported adjusted net income of $780 million for the year, and further reduced net debt down to US$0.8 billion.

In 2019, it acquired Canada&#x27;s Goldcorp for $10 billion. In May 2023, Newmont agreed terms to purchase Newcrest. The Deal was completed in November 2023.

Goldcorp had previously been under public scrutiny for documented human-rights abuses, including poisoning river-water that led to severe illnesses in local children living close to the mining operation (https://theviolenceofdevelopment.com/the-true-cost-of-gold-in-honduras/)

===Controversies===
====Buyat Bay, Sulawesi, Indonesia====
In August 2004, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment filed a civil lawsuit against Newmont, claiming tailings from the company&#x27;s Minahasa Raya mine polluted Buyat Bay. The company was cleared by an Indonesian court, with the judge ruling the pollution charges could not be proven.

==== Ghana====

In 2009, a group of NGOs awarded Newmont with the Public Eye on Davos award (a criticism for &quot;purely profit-oriented globalization&quot;) for its Akyem project in Ghana. Newmont said the award was issued based on several paragraphs of text which “clearly were intended to distort the facts”.

In 2010, Newmont was fined $4.9 million by the Ghanaian Environmental Protection Agency for not preventing, reporting and investigating a cyanide spill at Ahafo mine in an &quot;appropriate and timely manner&quot;.

==Former operations==
Newmont has purchased and sold a number of operations in recent years:

* Red Lake Mine: Newmont completed sale of Red Lake mine for $375 million on March 31, 2020.
* Continental Gold: Newmont sold its 19.9 percent equity stake and convertible bond in Continental Gold Inc. for $260 million on March 5, 2020.
* Super Pit gold mine: Newmont sold its 50 percent stake in Kalgoorlie Consolidated Gold Mines to Northern Star Resources for $800 million in January 2020.
* Golden Grove Mine: Owned by Normandy Mining since 1991, Golden Grove was acquired by Newmont Australia Ltd in February 2002 when Newmont took over Normandy. Newmont sold the mine to Oxiana Limited in June 2005 for A$265 million.
* Pajingo: Pajingo (100% owned) is an underground mine located approximately 93 miles (150 kilometers) southwest of Townsville, Queensland, and 45 miles (72 kilometers) south of the local township of Charters Towers. Newmont sold the mine in late 2007; it is now owned by Conquest Mining.
* Bronzewing Gold Mine: View Resources purchased the mine in July 2004 from Newmont for A$9.0 million, a package that also included the Mount McClure mining operation, 8 km west of Bronzewing.
* Wiluna Gold Mine: Also part of the Normandy acquisition, in December 2003 Newmont sold Wiluna to a local management buyout team for shares and A$3.65 million in cash. The mine was onsold 3 years later for A$29.5 million.
* Zarafshan: Newmont was part of a joint venture gold project in Uzbekistan, the first major Western investment in the region since the breakup of the Soviet Union. A difficult place to operate, Uzbekistan expropriated the company&#x27;s assets in 2006.
* Kori Kollo: The Kori Kollo open pit mine is on a high plain in northwestern Bolivia near Oruro, on government mining concessions issued to a Bolivian corporation, Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A. (“Inti Raymi”), in which Newmont had an 88% interest. The remaining 12% was owned by Mrs. Beatriz Rocabado. Inti Raymi owned and operated the mine. On July 23, 2009, Newmont announced the transfer of its interest in Empresa Minera Inti Raymi S.A., which owned the Kori Kollo gold mine and Kori Chaca gold mine, to Compania Procesadora de Minerales S.A. (&quot;CPM&quot;), a company controlled by Newmont&#x27;s long-time Bolivian partner Jose Mercado.
* Minahasa: Newmont owns 80% of Minahasa and the remaining 20% interest is a carried interest held by P.T. Tanjung Serapung, an unrelated Indonesian company. Minahasa is located on the island of Sulawesi, approximately 1,500 miles (2,414 kilometers) northeast of Jakarta. Mining was completed in late 2001 and gold production was completed in 2004.
* Golden Giant: Newmont&#x27;s Canadian operations previously included two underground mines. Golden Giant (100% owned) was located approximately 25 miles (40 kilometers) east of Marathon, Ontario, Canada, and had been in production since 1985. Mining operations at Golden Giant were completed in December 2005 with remnant mining and milling production continuing throughout most of 2006.
* Holloway: Holloway was located approximately 35 miles (56 kilometers) east of Matheson, Ontario, and about 400 miles (644 kilometers) northeast of Golden Giant. It was in production since 1996. On November 6, 2006, Newmont completed the sale of the Holloway mine to St. Andrews Goldfields Ltd. resulting in a $13 pre-tax gain.
*Martha Mine: Newmont completed the sale of its Waihi assets in New Zealand in October 2015. 
*Batu Hijau mine: Newmont completed the sale of Batu Hijau to PT Amman Mineral Internasional in 2016.

<text>Madster (initially called Aimster) was a peer-to-peer file sharing service. It was released in Napster&#x27;s wake in August 2000 and shut down in December 2002 as a result of a lawsuit by the Recording Industry Association of America.

==Origin==
According to John Deep, a professor at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, the Madster software was originally inspired by his daughter&#x27;s use of instant messaging software. His idea was to combine instant messaging with file sharing. John Deep&#x27;s daughter Aimee had an interest in providing privacy to her online friends; instant messaging was lacking when it came to privacy protection.

==Features==
The Madster service was initially called Aimster, but it was later renamed to Madster due to concerns that the Aimster name infringed AOL&#x27;s AIM (AOL Instant Messenger) trademark. The Madster software allowed users to share files via instant messaging services. In particular, users could share files specifically with users who were included on a &quot;buddy list&quot; with the advantage of privacy.

Around March 2001, support for encrypted network communications was included in a new release of the Madster software (at the time, the Aimster name was still in use.) Among other things, the Madster service hoped that the US Digital Millennium Copyright Act would have the effect of prohibiting others from monitoring the encrypted Madster network communications. In addition, the Madster operators argued that the encryption meant that they could not be aware of any copyright infringement that took place. Later on, around April-May 2001, a service was introduced wherein a network including tens of thousands of people could be searched for music and other content and new users would by default be added to this network although users could choose to instead restrict trading to buddy list members. At one point, the company announced a premium service that was available for US$4.95 per month.

&quot;PC Magazine&quot; gave Madster a 1 out of 5 rating of &quot;Dismal,&quot; based on interface design, partner advertising, and content selection.

==Recording industry collaboration==
In 2000, for a short time, Capitol Records authorized Madster (which was called Aimster at the time) to provide some Radiohead video files on the service&#x27;s Web site and to release a skin for the Madster software that had a Radiohead theme. This collaboration was done for the purpose of promoting a new Radiohead album.

==Legal problems and shutdown==
In December 2002, the company was ordered by a federal judge to disconnect its computer systems from the Internet. Earlier on in September, the court stated that Aimster had knowledge of copyright infringements, including a Web-based &quot;Aimster Guardian&quot; tutorial that showed copyrighted materials and the tracking of popular songs on the service via &quot;Club Aimster&quot;; the latter also indicated contribution to infringing activity and the monthly fees for the service indicated a financial interest for the Aimster operators in conjunction with infringing usage. The requirement for users to sign up and log in to use the service meant that Aimster was in a position to control the activities of its users. The injunction to disconnect was upheld in June 2003 by the decision in &quot;In re Aimster Copyright Litigation&quot; of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. In particular, it was found that Madster&#x27;s support of encrypted file sharing was &quot;willful blindness&quot; and was not a valid defense with regard to copyright infringement. At the same time, a company could avoid copyright liability if it was &quot;highly burdensome&quot; for the company to detect and prevent copyright infringement. In January 2004, the US Supreme Court refused without explanation to hear an appeal of the lower court&#x27;s ruling.

Madster was represented in court by Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, the same law firm which defended Napster. In 2005, Deep sued Boies for malpractice and misappropriation, but lost the case in 2008.

<text>Club Atlético Rosario Central (), more commonly referred to as Rosario Central, is a sports club based in Rosario, Argentina, that plays in the Argentine Primera División. The club was officially founded on 24 December 1889, by a group of railway workers, taking its name from the British-owned Central Argentine Railway company. One of the oldest Argentine and Latin American teams, it is considered a pioneer in its hometown and the only one of current Santa Fe province teams to have won an international title organised by CONMEBOL, the Copa Conmebol, won by the club in 1995.

Originally a member of the Rosario&#x27;s Football Association, the club affiliated itself to the Argentine Football Association (AFA) in 1939. Since then, Rosario Central has won the Argentine Primera Division five times, with the last domestic title being the 2023 Copa de la Liga Profesional. In addition, Rosario Central won six National cups, with the 2018 Copa Argentina being its most recent achievement. Also, Rosario Central won the Copa CONMEBOL (the precursor of the current Copa Sudamericana) in 1995. In 2012, the club was considered by FIFA as one of the 11 most &quot;classical clubs&quot; in Argentine football.

Rosario Central has a strong rivalry with Newell&#x27;s Old Boys. The matches played between them are named &quot;El Clasico Rosarino&quot;, The rivalry is among the most heated in Argentina. Nowadays Rosario Central has the biggest difference in history between both teams, due to, having 19 winnings more than his eternal rival. That dissimilarity in favor of Rosario Central is kept across 70 years ago. An extraordinary circumstance in the history of the Argentinian league, known as &quot;The oldest paternity ever&quot;.

Rosario Central&#x27;s home stadium is Estadio Dr. Lisandro de la Torre, known simply as &quot;El Gigante de Arroyito&quot; (The Giant of Arroyito) is one of the stadiums where Argentina played in the 1978 FIFA World Cup.

==History==
===The beginning===

By the end of the 1880s, a group of workers of British–owned company Central Argentine Railway used to play a kind of football game in fields located near Alberdi Avenue in Rosario. In the Christmas eve of 1889 they met at a bar with the purpose of establishing a club. British English citizen Thomas Mutton suggested the name &quot;Central Argentine Railway Athletic Club&quot;, which was approved. Scotsman Colin Calder was chosen as first president of the new club.

At the beginning, only CAR employees were admitted as members. The first field was located on a railway&#x27;s land while a disused wagon served as club&#x27;s headquarters. The first recorded game was played in 1890 when CARAC played a friendly match v the crew of a British ship&#x27;s crew, which ended 1–1. A second match between both teams finished with CARAC winning 2–1.
During many years Central Argentine played only internal matches or faced the Rosario Cricket Club (current Club Atlético del Rosario) occasionally. In 1904 the railway companies Central Argentino and Buenos Aires merged, which caused a high number of criollo workers moved to Rosario. They quickly became football enthusiasts so the club increased its number of members to 130 people. During an assembly, executive Miguel Green (also forward of the team) suggested that people outside the railway company could be accepted as member of the club. The proposal was widely discussed until it was finally approved so the statute was modified, including the change of name to Spanish form &quot;Club Atlético Rosario Central&quot;. Since those changes were approved, a significant number of workers of the city came to Rosario Central to become members of the club.

===Liga Rosarina and National cups===
The Liga Rosarina de Football (Rosario&#x27;s Football League) was created in March 1905. The first tournament organised by the body was the &quot;Copa Santiago Pinasco&quot;, named that way because the Mayor of Rosario, Santiago Pinasco, donated the trophy.

Central debuted on 21 May 1905, defeating Rosario A.C. by 3–1. On June, Rosario Central player Zenón Díaz was called for a Rosario combined that played a friendly match v English club Nottingham Forest (that was touring South America). The first official title won by Rosario Central came in 1908, when the squad won the &quot;Copa Nicasio Vila&quot; (the first division of LRF). The team finished unbeaten with 48 goals scored and only 9 conceded. Some notable players were Zenón Díaz, Harry Hayes, Augusto Winn, J.H. Grant, Juan Díaz.
In 1913 the club disaffiliated from the Liga Rosarina, founding with other clubs the dissident &quot;Federación Rosarina de Football&quot;. Central won this league in 1913. That same year, Rosario Central won its first national title, the Copa de Competencia La Nación, a domestic cup organised by dissident Federación Argentina de Football. Rosario Central won the competition after defeating Argentino de Quilmes 3–2 in Estadio G.E.B.A. of Buenos Aires.

In 1914 Central would return to Liga Rosarina, winning the championship after playing 20 matches, winning 19 games with 1 draw. The team scored 99 goals and only conceded 10, being Harry Hayes the top scorer of the tournament with 51 goals.

The squad also would win the 1915, 1916 and 1917 regional titles, becoming four-champion of the Rosarian League. In 1919, Central won the Rosario&#x27;s league title again, winning 3–2 the final match against their history rivals: Newell&#x27;s Old Boys.
The second national title won by Rosario Central was the Copa Dr. Carlos Ibarguren, a trophy contested by the champions of Buenos Aires and Rosario. Central won the 1915 edition beating Racing Club (that had won three Primera División titles consecutively) 3–1 in the final.

In 1916 Central won the Copa de Honor Municipalidad de Buenos Aires after beating Independiente 1–0. That same year the Rosarino team won the Copa de Competencia Jockey Club defeating Independiente again. A new national title would come in 1920, when Central won the Copa de Competencia organised by dissident body Asociación Amateurs de Football (AAmF) against Sportivo Almagro. During the 1910 decade, Rosario Central won a total of five National cups.

In 1920 Rosario Central left the Rosarian League again, and joined other clubs to establish a dissident league, winning the 1920 and 1921 titles. Two years later, Central and the dissident clubs would return again to the Rosarian league.

In the following years, Central won the 1923, 1927, 1928 (won against Newell&#x27;s in the final match), and 1930 championship, becoming the most successful team in Liga de Rosario&#x27;s history.

In 1931 football became professional in Argentina, so a new Association, &quot;Asociación Rosarina de Fútbol&quot;, was created in Rosario to organize the first professional championships. The Copa Nicasio Vila changed its name to &quot;Torneo Gobernador Luciano Molinas&quot;, honoring then Governor of Santa Fe Province Luciano Molinas. Rosario Central won the 1937 and 1938 titles.

===Coming to Primera División===

In 1939, Rosario Central and its arch-rival Newell&#x27;s Old Boys requested Argentine Football Association to be added to the main league championship of Argentina, the Primera División. The Association accepted the requirement therefore both clubs joined the top-flight division of Argentine football.

Despite playing in the Primera División, Rosario Central continue contesting the Rosarian Football Association competitions with reserve teams formed by amateur footballers. During its first year in Primera División, Rosario Central finished 11° with 33 points earned (15 loses).

In 1941 Rosario Central was relegated to the second division, Primera B, after losing 20 matches with only 6 won. Nevertheless, Central only lasted one season in second division, returning one year later, after 25 matches won and only 4 lost. In 1950 Central was relegated again after a poor campaign in Primera. As its precedent relegation, Central promoted to the top division one year after being relegated, so the team returned to Primera in 1951.

=== First league titles ===
Rosario Central won its first national league title, in the 1971 Nacional championship with Angel Labruna as coach defeating San Lorenzo in the final game. Central had previously beat arch-rival Newell&#x27;s 1–0 in semi-finals with a goal scored by Aldo Poy, who dove to head the ball before it touched the grass (a way of heading popularly known as &quot;palomita&quot; in South America). That goal is still remembered by Central supporters who usually reunite on 19 December, to recreate the goal. Many times Poy himself has taken part of the celebration.
The second league title for the club came two years later, winning the 1973 Nacional with Carlos Griguol as coach. Some of the most notable players were Poy, Carlos Aimar and Eduardo Solari. The most frequent line-up was: Carlos Biasutto, Jorge González, Aurelio Pascuttini, Daniel Killer, Mario Killer, Carlos Aimar, Eduardo Solari, Aldo Poy, Ramón Bóveda, Roberto Cabral and Daniel Aricó.

For the 1974 season, Central acquired striker Mario Kempes from Instituto Atlético Central Córdoba (Kempes and Instituto mate Osvaldo Ardiles were to be reunited in the national team that won the 1978 World Cup).

After seven years without titles, Central won the 1980 Nacional with Ángel Tulio Zof on the bench. That team was called &quot;La Sinfónica (the Symphony Orchestra)&quot; because of the exquisite playing displayed by the team on the field. Central defeated Racing de Córdoba 5–0 in the first final game, and lost 2–0 in the second match but proclaimed champion due to goal average. Daniel Carnevali, Juan Carlos Ghielmetti, Edgardo Bauza, Oscar Craiyacich, Jorge García, José Gaitán, Daniel Sperandío, Eduardo Bacas, Félix Orte, Víctor Marchetti and Daniel Teglia was the frequent line-up on the fields.

After a few years with bad seasons, the team was relegated in 1984, but returned to first division just one year later after winning the Primera B championship, coached by Pedro Marchetta. Central returned to Primera to play the 1986–87 season, winning the title at the end of the tournament but coached by Zof again. This was a first in Argentine football (oddly, Central Español performed a similar feat in Uruguay in the years 1983–84, also a first).

The 1986–87 team was formed by Alejandro Lanari, Hernán Díaz, Jorge Balbis, Edgardo Bauza, Pedernera, Omar Palma, Adelqui Cornaglia, Roberto Gasparini, Osvaldo Escudero, Fernando Lanzidei and Hugo Galloni.

===International titles===
The first years of the decade of 1990 Central did not make good campaigns in domestic tournaments, although the team won the CONMEBOL Cup (the precursor of the current Copa Sudamericana) in 1995, being the only international title achieved by a Santa Fe Province based team to date. Central defeated Brazilian squad Atlético Mineiro 4–0 in Arroyito after losing by the same score in the first match in Brazil. Finally Central won the Cup by Penalty shoot-out, with a score of 4–3.

The club has participated in eleven editions of the Copa Libertadores, and is currently tied for fifth place with Estudiantes de la Plata and Vélez Sársfield, all of which trail participation leaders Boca Juniors, River Plate, Independiente, and San Lorenzo de Almagro.

===Decline and resurrection===
After the 2010 Clausura, Rosario Central&#x27;s poor form over the past three years forced it into a relegation/promotion play-off against Nacional B side All Boys, which won the tie over two legs 4–1 on aggregate (defining the series with a thrashing 3–0 in Arroyito), relegating Rosario Central to Primera B Nacional, the second tier of Argentine football. It was the fourth time the club was relegated to play in the second division.

Rosario Central spent several seasons in the B Nacional until 19 May 2013, when the squad secured the promotion to Primera División after beating Gimnasia y Esgrima de Jujuy by 3–0. The three goals were scored by Javier Toledo. The team was coached by Miguel Ángel Russo.

===The eleventh official title: the 2018 Copa Argentina.===
In May 2018, the club saw the return of Edgardo Bauza as Central&#x27;s coach in his second cycle.221 The coach stated that ‘I knew no other objective than to be champion with Central. ’.

Edgardo Bauza led Rosario Central to the championship title after 23 years.
In the Round of 32, the Auriazules faced Juventud Antoniana with a 6-0 win. Then, in both the Round of 16 and Round of 16, the Canalla drew both matches: the first goalless against Talleres de Córdoba, advancing 5-3 on penalties. In the Round of 16, the Arroyito club drew 1-1 against Almagro and defeated them 5-4 on penalty kicks.224

In the quarter-finals, Central and Newell&#x27;s played a new Rosario derby. As in 1969 and 1970, the &#x27;Blue and yellows&#x27; again defeated their arch-rivals and advanced to the semi-finals with goals by Herrera and Zampedri, with Torres scoring the equaliser for Newell&#x27;s.225

Central faced Temperley in the semi-finals. The match ended in a 1-1 draw after a goal by the light blue side in the last minutes of the match. However, &quot;Los Canallas&quot; eventually won on penalties 4-2, qualifying for their fourth Copa Argentina final.226

The cup final was played on 6 December at the Malvinas Argentinas stadium in Mendoza against Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata. In this final, both teams were looking to put an end to a streak of more than twenty years without silverware.227 Central won the first half with a goal by Zampedri, but in the second half Lorenzo Faravelli equalised. The tie remained equal throughout the ninety minutes, and a penalty shoot-out was forced. There, the Rosarinos scored four and Gimansia only one - previously one had been deflected and another had been saved by goalkeeper Jeremías Ledesma - to make Central champions of the Copa Argentina for the first time in their history. It also gave them qualification for the 2019 Copa Libertadores and the 2018 Supercopa Argentina.

Champion squad: Jeremías Ledesma, Josué Ayala, Miguel Barbieri, Matías Caruzzo, Óscar Cabezas, Marcelo Ortiz, Alfonso Parot, Elías Gómez, Gonzalo Bettini, Nahuel Gómez, Diego Arismendi, Leonardo Gil, Joaquín Pereyra, Néstor Ortigoza, Andrés Lioi, José Luis Fernández, Washington Camacho, Federico Carrizo, Maximiliano Lovera, Fernando Zampedri, Marco Ruben, Agustín Maziero and Germán Herrera. 

Manager: Edgardo Bauza

===Miguel Angel Russo&#x27;s return and the twelfth championship title: the Copa de la Liga 2023===

On 19 December 2022, after Gonzalo Belloso won the presidential elections at Rosario Central, Miguel Ángel Russo was re-hired by the Rosario club to lead the team in the 2023 season, thus assuming his fifth cycle at the club, replacing Carlos Tévez.

Miguel Russo arrived in January 2023 and was the champion coach with Central in December of that year.
Under the experienced coach, Rosario Central had a very successful 2023: they were 8th in the first half of the year, and champions in the Professional League Cup 2023, played in the second half.231 In addition, the Auriazul team was the only team in the Primera División that did not lose at home in the whole calendar year, having made the Gigante de Arroyito a fortress. The champion&#x27;s title (and also the accumulation of points in the Annual Table) allowed them to qualify for the 2024 Copa Libertadores.

The second half of the year saw the 2023 Professional League Cup. The start of the tournament saw an inconsistent Central, winning home games but failing to win away. Everything started to improve on matchday 7, when the &#x27;Auriazul&#x27; team defeated their classic rivals 1-0 at the Estadio Gigante de Arroyito, and from that victory against Newell&#x27;s Old Boys, they did not know defeat for the rest of the championship. Finally, Central qualified for the playoffs on the last matchday of the regular phase, after defeating Arsenal 2-1 away. It finished in fourth place in its zone, and thus was able to fight for the championship.

In the knockout rounds, the &#x27;Canalla&#x27; went through beating big teams until they reached the definition for the title: they beat Racing Club in the quarter-finals on penalties (they had started 2-0, drew 2-2 and ended up winning on penalties). In the semis, they did the same against River Plate, in a tough 0-0 draw at the Mario Alberto Kempes Stadium in Córdoba, which was also decided by penalties, and showed Rosario goalkeeper Jorge Broun as the outstanding figure, saving 3 penalty kicks from the 12 steps. Finally, Rosario Central celebrated a new championship title at the Estadio Único Madre de Ciudades de Santiago del Estero, where more than 25,000 &quot;Canallas&quot; fans accompanied the team and filled the Santiago del Estero stadium with the illusion of a new title. In an even and hard-fought match, Rosario Central beat Club Atlético Platense 1-0 in the final with a beautiful goal by Maximiliano Lovera 39 minutes into the first half, and thus was able to crown the 12th official title in its history. 

Champion squad: Jorge Broun, Axel Werner, Valentino Quintero, Carlos Quintana, Agustín Sández, Damián Martínez, Juan Cruz Komar, Facundo Mallo, Alan Rodríguez, Ulises Ciccioli, Ismael Cortéz, Facundo Agüero, Kevin Silva, Fernando Rodríguez, Francis Mac Allister, Walter Montoya, Agustín Toledo, Ignacio Malcorra, Jaminton Campaz, Dannovi Quiñonez, Francesco Lo Celso, Lautaro Giaccone, Giovanni Bogado, Marcelo Acosta, Tomás O&#x27;Connor, Leandro Iglesias, Kevin Ortíz, Tobías Cervera, Maximiliano Lovera, Octavio Bianchi, Juan Cruz Cerrudo, Luca Martínez Dupuy, Fabricio Oviedo, Agustín Módica.

Manager: Miguel Ángel Russo

==Stadium==
Rosario Central plays in the Gigante de Arroyito stadium, located in the confluence of Avellaneda Boulevard and Génova Avenue, in the Lisandro de la Torre neighborhood (popularly known as &quot;Arroyito&quot;), in north-east Rosario. It has an official capacity of 46,955 spectators.

The stadium was one of the venues chosen for the 1978 FIFA World Cup. In that tournament, all three-second-round games of the Argentine squad were played in the &quot;Gigante&quot;. Local hero Kempes enjoyed the support of the fans and went on to become the top scorer of the tournament. Besides, the &quot;Gigante de Arroyito&quot; was one of the venues for the 1987 Copa América, hosted by Argentina.

==Nicknames==

Central&#x27;s common nickname is &quot;canallas&quot; (&quot;rabble&quot;, &quot;scoundrels&quot;, which is a rather mild insult in Argentina) because it is said that the club refused to play a charity match for a leprosy clinic in the 1920s; rival side Newell&#x27;s acquired the &quot;leprosos&quot; (lepers) nickname when it did play in that event.

Another version states that in 1928 the Central supporters burned down some canvas near the Club Belgrano stadium (which Central had a strong rivalry). When the Belgrano supporters saw that, they started to shout to them: &quot;You&#x27;re scoundrels! Scoundrels!&quot;.

In January 2007, Roberto Fontanarrosa a Rosario native and a devout fan of the club, created a logo that revised the definition and spelling of Central&#x27;s nickname. The new spelling he gave was &quot;canaya&quot;, because according to him, people from the city of Rosario use and pronounce the word with a &quot;y&quot; for the sole purpose of referring to the club fans.

Central is also known as &quot;La Academia&quot; (like the fellow Argentine team Racing Club) due to the number of players that become professional from the youth teams; but also to the number of consecutive titles that the club won in the Rosario&#x27;s League (at an amateur level), in comparison to what Racing Club did in the Buenos Aires&#x27; League.

==Supporters==
Rosario Central&#x27;s supporters are considered one of the most significant of Argentina.
The Newspaper Olé was published last 5 January 2008 by a recent study realized by the English magazine UK Football. The same one, published that a ranking with the 50 most vibrant supporters of the world.

<text>A cyclopentadienyl complex is a coordination complex of a metal and cyclopentadienyl groups (, abbreviated as Cp−). Cyclopentadienyl ligands almost invariably bind to metals as a pentahapto (&quot;η&quot;5-) bonding mode. The metal–cyclopentadienyl interaction is typically drawn as a single line from the metal center to the center of the Cp ring.

==Examples==
&quot;Bis&quot;cyclopentadienyl complexes are called metallocenes. A famous example of this type of complex is ferrocene (FeCp2), which has many analogues for other metals, such as chromocene (CrCp2), cobaltocene (CoCp2), and nickelocene (NiCp2). When the Cp rings are mutually parallel the compound is known as a sandwich complex. This area of organometallic chemistry was first developed in the 1950s. Bent metallocenes are represented by compounds of the type [MCp2Lx]. Some are catalysts for ethylene polymerization. Metallocenes are often thermally stable, and find use as catalysts in various types of reactions.

Mixed-ligand Cp complexes containing Cp ligand and one or more other ligands. They are more numerous. One widely studied example is the Fp dimer, (Cp2Fe2(CO)4). Monometallic compounds featuring only one Cp ring are often known as half sandwich compounds or as piano stool compounds, one example being methylcyclopentadienylmanganese tricarbonyl (CpMn(CO)3).

==Bonding modes==
All 5 carbon atoms of a Cp ligand are bound to the metal in the vast majority of M–Cp complexes. This bonding mode is called &quot;η&quot;5-coordination. The M–Cp bonding arises from overlap of the five π molecular orbitals of the Cp ligand with the s, p, and d orbitals on the metal. These complexes are referred to as π-complexes. Almost all of the transition metals employ this coordination mode.

In relatively rare cases, Cp binds to metals via only one carbon center. These types of interactions are described as σ-complexes because they only have a σ bond between the metal and the cyclopentadienyl group. Typical examples of this type of complex are group 14 metal complexes such as CpSiMe3. An example of both is (Cp2Fe(CO)2). It is probable that &quot;η&quot;1-Cp complexes are intermediates in the formation of &quot;η&quot;5-Cp complexes.

Still rarer, the Cp unit can bond to the metal via three carbons. In these &quot;η&quot;3-Cp complexes, the bonding resembles that in allyl ligands. Such complexes, sometimes called &quot;slipped Cp complexes&quot;, are invoked as intermediates in ring slipping reactions.

==Synthesis of Cp complexes==
The compounds are generally prepared by salt metathesis reactions of alkali-metal cyclopentadienyl compounds with transition metal chlorides. Sodium cyclopentadienide (NaCp) and lithium cyclopentadienide are commonly used. Trimethylsilylcyclopentadiene cyclopentadienylthallium (CpTl) are alternative sources. For the preparation of some particularly robust complexes, e.g. nickelocene, cyclopentadiene is employed in the presence of a conventional base such as KOH. When only a single Cp ligand is installed, the other ligands typically carbonyl, halogen, alkyl, and hydride.

Most Cp complexes are prepared by substitution of preformed Cp complexes by replacement of halide, CO, and other simple ligands.

==Variations of Cp complexes==
===Ansa Cp ligands===

A pair of cyclopentadienyl ligands can be covalently linked giving rise to so-call ansa metallocenes. The angle between the two Cp rings is fixed. Rotation of the rings about the metal-centroid axis is stopped as well. A related class of derivatives give rise to the constrained geometry complexes. In these cases, a Cp ligand as linked to a non-Cp ligand. Such complexes have been commercialized for the production of polypropylene.

===Bulky Cp ligands===

Pentamethylcyclopentadiene gives rise to pentamethylcyclopentadienyl (Cp*) complexes. These ligands are more basic and more lipophilic. Replacing methyl groups with larger substituents results in cyclopentadienes that are so encumbered that pentaalkyl derivatives are no longer possible. Well-studied ligands of this type include C5R4H− (R = iso-Pr) and 1,2,4-C5R3H2− (R = &quot;tert&quot;-Bu).

===Constrained geometry complexes===

Constrained geometry complexes are related to ansa-metallocenes except that one ligand is not Cp-related.

==Applications==
Cp metal complexes are mainly used as stoichiometric reagents in chemical research. Ferrocenium reagents are oxidants. Cobaltocene is a strong, soluble reductant.

Derivatives of Cp2TiCl2 and Cp2ZrCl2 are the basis of some reagents in organic synthesis. Upon treatment with aluminoxane, these dihalides give catalysts for olefin polymerization. Such species are called Kaminsky-type catalysts.

<text>The Kenyatta International Convention Centre (KICC), formerly the Kenyatta International Conference Centre, is a 32-story building located in Nairobi, Kenya. The KICC is located in the City Square of Nairobi, and is a crucial address for a number of Government offices, including those of recently elected Senators.

The KICC has been listed among the top venues for hosting conferences on the continent. After completion, the building held the rank of the tallest building in Nairobi up until the construction of Teleposta Towers. The building has since then ceded its position as the tallest tower to a host of other newer projects including the UAP Old Mutual Tower, Times Tower and the Britam Tower, which is the tallest building in Nairobi as of 2020.

== History ==
The Kenyatta International Conference Centre, locally known as the &quot;KICC&quot;, was commissioned by Mzee Jomo Kenyatta, the first President of the Republic of Kenya, in 1967. It was designed by Karl Henrik Nøstvik architect with David Mutiso. The construction was carried out by contractors Solel Boneh &amp; Factah. This was done in three phases. Phase I was the construction of the podium, Phase II consisted of the main tower and Phase III involved the Plenary. Construction was completed in 1973, with the opening ceremony occurring in September 1973 presided over by President Kenyatta. The KICC was then made a State Corporation established under the Tourism Act in 2011, which came into operation on 1 September 2012. Whereas the centre is known as a leading meeting venue in Nairobi, its national mandate following the Act became to nurture and promote the country as a destination most preferred for business travel and MICE tourism. M.I.C.E has been recognized as one of the four key products to be developed under the Kenya Vision 2030.

In September 2013, as the complex celebrated its 40th anniversary, it was renamed to the Kenyatta International Convention Centre.

==Structure==

===General===
The KICC currently stands as the ninth tallest building in Kenya, reaching a height of just over 105 metres. It succeeded the Hilton Nairobi as the tallest building in Kenya, a position it held for 26 years before being surpassed by Teleposta Tower. The tower consists of 32 floors, including a revolving restaurant which offers panoramic views of the city, rotating 360° in 76 minutes. The building&#x27;s light terracotta façade reflects traditional African architecture, as does the use of simple solid shapes- cuboids make up the Plenary hall, the tower consists of a cylinder composed of several cuboids and the amphitheatre and helipad both resemble cones.

There are several well-equipped conference and meeting rooms with the largest having a capacity over 6,000 delegates. The KICC is equipped with Simultaneous Interpretation Equipment with a capability of up to seven languages, a modern business centre, a banking facility, tour and travel services, expansive grounds and ample and secure parking. It is often depicted as an icon of Nairobi.

Up until the 1980s, there was a &#x27;revolving restaurant&#x27; atop the KICC that was popular with politicians and the elite, but years of neglect literally brought it to a halt, though concerted efforts in 2012 to revive it were somewhat short lived. The 148-seater restaurant has a revolving mortar programmed to make approximately one revolution in 76 minutes.

=== The Amphitheatre ===
The amphitheater is designed for medium-sized events and accommodates 800 people on three balconies surrounding the auditorium, making it suitable for business meetings. It is equipped with SIE Booths, full logic recording facilities, a public address system and sound proofing.

=== Tsavo Ballroom ===
The largest conference chamber of its kind in East Africa, the plenary is fortified with sound proof grey stone, deep natural wood and lofty ceilings. It caters for large international meetings, exhibitions and grand balls, and has a capacity of 5000 people. It is equipped with Advanced Sound Amplification &amp; recording systems, Wireless Simultaneous interpretation Equipment (up to 7 languages) booths, and observer galleries. Its high ceilings were made for elaborate décor, hosting banners and other promotional materials.

=== Courtyard ===

This is a paved 75 square meter courtyard surrounding the 1971 statue of Kenyatta by James Butler. The courtyard was designed as a respite for those attending conferences and includes gardens, pools and geyser fountains. Numerous flag poles and balconies in the courtyard are fashioned to host promotional identities.

<text>Reggie Nalder (born Alfred Natzler; 4 September 1907 – 19 November 1991) was a prolific Austrian film and television character actor from the late 1940s to the early 1990s. His distinctive features—partially the result of disfiguring burns—together with a haunting style and demeanor led to his being called &quot;The Face That Launched a Thousand Trips&quot;.

==Life and career==

Born in Vienna, Austria-Hungary, he was the son of actor and operetta singer Sigmund Natzler. He was a cousin of actresses and singers Grete Natzler and Hertha Natzler. As a young man he performed at second-rate Vienna theatres and from the 1930s in several cabarets in Paris. After World War II he worked for the German language service of the BBC.

Nalder is perhaps best remembered for his roles as an assassin in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1956 remake of &quot;The Man Who Knew Too Much&quot;, the vampire Kurt Barlow in the 1979 TV adaptation of the Stephen King novel &quot;Salem&#x27;s Lot&quot;, and the Andorian ambassador Shras in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; episode &quot;Journey to Babel&quot;.

Nalder appeared, at the request of star Frank Sinatra, in a brief, uncredited role as a communist spymaster named Dmitri in John Frankenheimer&#x27;s 1962 film &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot;. He also had a brief role in the 1981 Walt Disney film &quot;The Devil and Max Devlin&quot; but stated in an interview that he could not stand working with Bill Cosby, the star of the film. He described him as &quot;a pig&quot;, as well as &quot;rude, arrogant, and very untalented.&quot;

Nalder&#x27;s television work also included episodes of the series &quot;77 Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;It Takes A Thief&quot;, &quot;Surfside Six&quot;, Boris Karloff&#x27;s &quot;Thriller&quot; (&quot;The Terror In Teakwood&quot; and &quot;The Return Of Andrew Bentley&quot;), &quot;McCloud&quot; and &quot;I Spy&quot;. Nalder was also credited as &quot;Detlef Van Berg&quot; in the X rated films &quot;Dracula Sucks&quot; (1978) and &quot;Blue Ice&quot; (1985), but performed in no scenes of a pornographic nature.

==Death==
Nalder died of bone cancer in Santa Monica, California in 1991, aged 84.

<doc id="1100783" wikidata="Q7411979" url="?curid=1100783" title="Samuel Lawrence (Canadian politician)">
<text>Samuel Lawrence (August 16, 1879 – October 25, 1959) was a Canadian politician and trade unionist. He was the first member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario and subsequently served as Mayor of Hamilton, Ontario.

Lawrence was born in Somerset, England and went to work in a quarry at the age of 12. He became a shop steward in the Operative Stonemasons&#x27; Union at the age of 18. He entered politics, running for election in Battersea in London.

Known as &quot;Mr. Labour&quot;, Sam Lawrence was an alderman, controller, and the Mayor of Hamilton, Ontario from 1944 to 1949. He was also President of the Stone Cutters&#x27; Union, Vice-President of the Hamilton Trades and Labour Council, and leader of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) party in the Ontario legislature as well as Ontario CCF president in the early 1940s

==Early years==
Born in the Somerset village of Norton-sub-Hamdon to William Lawrence and Ann Geard on 16 August 1879, Sam was the fourth child in a family of 5 boys and 5 girls and he attended school from the age of 3 to 10. His father, who Sam described as a &#x27;radical liberal&#x27;, was a stonemason, and Sam gave him credit for the position he took in the Labour movement. At the age of 12, Lawrence was working twelve hours a day, from six to six, and was apprenticed to a stonemason at 13. He had served half his time when his father became the foreman at Arundel Castle, the principal seat of the Duke of Norfolk. Lawrence went to London at 17 and joined the Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons of England, Ireland and Wales in Battersea and was shop steward at the age of 18.

Whilst serving in the Coldstream Guards during the Boer War, a young recruit by the name of Knobby Taylor loaned Lawrence &quot;Looking Backward&quot; by Edward Bellamy. Lawrence&#x27;s experiences in the Boer War and Bellamy&#x27;s American Utopian novel led to him becoming a socialist. In 1906, the then 27-year-old trade unionist and war veteran stood in an abortive election campaign for the Battersea Borough Council and, six years later, decided to follow three of his brothers and two sisters who had already gone to Canada.

== Career ==
Lawrence immigrated to Canada, settling in Hamilton, Ontario with his family in 1912. He immediately joined the Journeymen Stonecutters&#x27; Association of North America and found work as a stonemason. He became involved in the local labour movement and was elected to Hamilton, Ontario City Council as an Independent Labour Party alderman in 1922. He ran as a Labour candidate in the 1925 federal election but lost his bid for a seat in the House of Commons of Canada, coming in second. He remained on city council and was elected to Hamilton&#x27;s Board of Control in 1929, retaining his seat until 1934 when he was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as the Member of the Legislative Assembly (MLA) for Hamilton East, the first Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) MLA ever elected in Ontario. He was also the only CCFer elected in the 1934 election, and was defeated in his bid for re-election in the 1937 election. He was elected Ontario CCF president in 1941, and served as Mayor of Hamilton from 1944 to 1949 leading a CCF slate in that city.

Lawrence then served for a time as president of the local Industrial Union Council, and subsequently regained his seat on the Board of Control and kept it for six years. He was elected the first Labour mayor of Hamilton in the 1944 municipal election and was re-elected mayor annually until his retirement from the office in 1949.

During his tenure as mayor, the city went through the deeply divisive 85-day Stelco strike of 1946. The strike was the union&#x27;s first, and its victory established the United Steel Workers of America as a major force in Canada. It also helped establish the right of Canadian workers to collective bargaining. Lawrence was publicly supportive of the strike, and led a 10,000-person march from Woodlawns Park to the gates of Stelco. Despite pressure from the federal and provincial governments, he refused to call in police or the military against the illegal strike, and thus helped ensure its victory. When the federal government sent the army in, Lawrence angrily stated that &quot;the government was acting as the nation&#x27;s chief strike breaker.&quot;

After stepping down as mayor in 1949, Lawrence continued on the Board of Control for six years until his retirement from politics.

=== Legacy ===
 &quot;Sam Lawrence Park&quot; can be found on the western-end of Concession Street. Prior to 1944, this property was the Webb Quarry. In February 1944, The City of Hamilton was given of land for park use by Thomas Hambly Ross, MP (Hamilton East), and his wife Olive. The park was originally named Ross Park, then renamed Patton Park in 1946, in honour of Captain John MacMillan Stevenson Patton, a Hamiltonian who risked his life during World War II by moving an unexploded bomb away from an aircraft plant. For this exploit he received the first George Cross for Valour. In 1960, the park was renamed to honour Sam Lawrence. During 1990 to 1994, &quot;Sam Lawrence Park&quot; underwent a major upgrading that included repairing the stone walls, installing new walkways, site lighting, site furniture, and the redevelopment of the major rock gardens.

When the (Ontario) Workers Arts and Heritage Centre purchased the historic Custom House on Stuart Street in the north end of Hamilton in 1996, they began hosting an annual Sam Lawrence Dinner after their November AGM.

<text>The Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) is the Crown corporation responsible for operating the electricity market and directing the operation of the bulk electrical system in the province of Ontario, Canada. It is one of seven independent system operators in North America.

The IESO was established in April 1999 as the Independent Electricity Market Operator (IMO) under the government of Ontario during the premiership of Mike Harris in preparation for deregulation of the province&#x27;s electrical supply and transmission system. As part of government plans to privatize the assets of Ontario Hydro, the utility was split into five separate Crown corporations with the IMO responsible for directing the flow of electricity across the high-voltage, province-wide network owned by Hydro One and other transmission companies. It was also given the responsibility of managing and operating the competitive wholesale electricity market and working with neighbouring jurisdictions to manage an integrated North American electricity network.

The IMO was renamed to the IESO in January 2005 as a result of the passage of Bill 100, which redefined the direction of deregulation and also led to the creation of the Ontario Power Authority.

As a Crown corporation, IESO is owned by the government of Ontario but operates at arms-length. It is governed by a board whose directors are appointed by the provincial government, its fees and licences are set by the Ontario Energy Board and it operates independently of all participants in the electricity market.

In April 2012, the Energy Minister of Ontario Chris Bentley introduced legislation in provincial Parliament to merge the Ontario Power Authority and IESO. The merger was expected to take place in late 2012. After the Premier of Ontario Dalton McGuinty resigned in the fall of 2012, the merger was postponed.

As of January 1, 2015 the IESO and the Ontario Power Authority were merged.

<text>The Wilderness Road was one of two principal routes used by colonial and early national era settlers to reach Kentucky from the East. Although this road goes through the Cumberland Gap into southern Kentucky and northern Tennessee, the other (more northern route) is sometimes called the &quot;Cumberland Road&quot; because it started in Fort Cumberland in Maryland. Despite Kentucky Senator Henry Clay&#x27;s advocacy of this route, early in the 19th century, the northern route was selected for the National Road, connecting near Washington, Pennsylvania into the Ohio Valley of northern Kentucky and Ohio.

In 1775, Daniel Boone blazed a trail for the Transylvania Company from Fort Chiswell in Virginia through the Cumberland Gap. It was later lengthened, following Indian trails, to reach the Falls of the Ohio at Louisville. The Wilderness Road was steep, rough and narrow. It could be traversed only on foot or horseback. By contrast, wagons could travel along the National Road route (originally the Braddock Road blazed by the competing Ohio Company and George Washington circa 1750), particularly after the improvements.

Despite the adverse conditions, thousands of families used the Wilderness Road. In 1792, the new Kentucky legislature provided money to upgrade the road. In 1796, an improved all-weather road was opened for wagon and carriage travel. The road was abandoned around 1840 (construction on the National Road after Vandalia, Illinois also stopping owing to the Panic of 1837 and early railroad construction), although modern highways follow much of its route.

==Early exploration==
The first European explorers of the southern Appalachian Mountains were Spanish. Hernando de Soto and his troops traversed the region in 1540 and 1541 searching for gold.

The first recorded English explorations of the mountains were those of Abraham Wood, which began around 1650. Later, Wood sent exploring parties into the mountains. The Batts-Fallam expedition reached the New River Valley in 1671. In 1673, Wood sent Gabriel Arthur and James Needham to the Overhill Cherokee of modern Tennessee. The purpose was to try to make direct contact with the Cherokee for trade, so as to circumvent the Ocaneechee &quot;middlemen&quot; traders.

The expedition did reach the Overhill Cherokee area, but Needham was killed on the return trip. Gabriel Arthur was almost killed, but was rescued and adopted by a Cherokee chief. For his own safety, Arthur was then sent with one of the chief&#x27;s raiding parties. For about a year, he traveled with the Cherokee throughout the Appalachians. He was probably the first European to visit modern West Virginia.
In 1750, Dr. Thomas Walker, an investor in the Loyal Land Company, with five companions, made a famous exploration through the Cumberland Gap and into eastern Kentucky. The Loyal Land Company settled people in southwest Virginia, but not Kentucky.

In 1769, Virginia longhunter and explorer Joseph Martin made the first of several forays into the region. Acting as an agent for Dr. Thomas Walker, to whom Martin was connected through family relationships, Martin began an expedition to Powell&#x27;s Valley in early 1769 in return for a promised land grant from Walker and the Loyal Land Company. Martin and his men built the earliest westernmost frontier fort at present-day Rose Hill, Virginia, a fort dubbed Martin&#x27;s Station. Later that year Indians chased off Martin and his men, who returned to Albemarle County. Martin returned six years later to rebuild the fort, and a few months later became an agent for Richard Henderson&#x27;s Transylvania Company.

In 1774, Richard Henderson, a judge from North Carolina, organized a land speculation company with a number of other prominent North Carolinians called the &quot;Transylvania Company&quot;. The men hoped to purchase land from the Cherokees on the Kentucky side of the Appalachian Mountains and establish a British proprietary colony. Henderson hired Daniel Boone, an experienced hunter who had explored Kentucky, to blaze a trail through the Cumberland Gap into central Kentucky.

==Boone, the trailblazer==

The Appalachian Mountains form a natural barrier to east–west travel. From New York to Georgia there are only five ways to travel to the west, with only three natural interior breaks allowing animal powered travel without great engineering works. These were the Gaps of the Allegheny and the several ways such as the Kittanning Paths in Pennsylvania, the Cumberland Narrows in northwestern Maryland host to Nemacolin&#x27;s Path, and the Cumberland Gap in the four-state region of North Carolina and Virginia on the east side and through the gap, Tennessee and Kentucky.

While late 19th and 20th century technologies would later bridge the mountain chain in other places, these all required significant civil engineering works to make a road bed past the barrier range geologist classify as the ridge-and-valley Appalachians. Settlers from Pennsylvania tended to migrate south along the Great Wagon Road through the Great Appalachian Valley and Shenandoah Valley.
Daniel Boone was from Pennsylvania and migrated south with his family along this road. From an early age, Boone was one of the longhunters who hunted and trapped among the Native American nations along the western frontiers of Virginia, so-called because of the long time they spent away from home on hunts in the wilderness. Boone would sometimes be gone for months and even years before returning home from his hunting expeditions.

Boone recommended three essentials for a pioneer: &quot;A good gun, a good horse, and a good wife.&quot; He also would need a strong body, a sharp ax and good luck. Another essential was salt. Before 1776, it had to be shipped into the Thirteen Colonies from the West Indies at great expense. It was the only meat preservative available for men on the move and Kentucky had an extra lure with its large salt brine lakes near what is today the community of Boonesborough, Kentucky. The many &quot;salt licks&quot; of Kentucky are today reflected in the many place names in the state that use the words &quot;lick&quot; or &quot;licking&quot;.
Starting on March 10, 1775, Boone, along with 35 axmen, cut a trail from Long Island in Kingsport, Tennessee through the forests and mountains to Kentucky. It was a rough mud trail, hardly more than a path. The Transylvania Company had obtained title to Kentucky from the Cherokee and Iroquois, and even the Shawnee chief Cornstalk, defeated in Dunmore&#x27;s War, had promised at the Treaty of Camp Charlotte on October 19, 1774, that his tribe would no longer hunt or claim land south of the Ohio River in Kentucky.

Notwithstanding this promise, the Shawnee viewed Boone and other settlers as invaders. On March 24, 1775, Boone and his party were only from their final destination of the Kentucky River when they camped for the night. Just before daybreak a group of Shawnee, slinging tomahawks, attacked the sleeping men. Some of Boone&#x27;s party were killed and a few were wounded but most were able to escape into the woods. Boone regrouped his men and managed to drive off the hostile Shawnee. The party lost some of their horses. Here Boone built a temporary open barricade with 6 to high logs.

By the next year, the Shawnee had been joined by the Chickamauga Cherokee in the Cherokee–American wars with the settlers, which lasted until 1794.

==Route==

The route of the Wilderness Road made a long loop from Virginia southward to Tennessee and then northward to Kentucky, a distance of .

From the Long Island of the Holston River (modern Kingsport, Tennessee), the road went north through Moccasin Gap of Clinch Mountain, then crossed the Clinch River and crossed rough land (called the Devils Raceway) to the North Fork Clinch River. Then it crossed Powell Mountain at Kanes Gap. From there it ran southwest through the valley of the Powell River to the Cumberland Gap.

After passing over the Cumberland Gap the Wilderness Road forked. The southern fork passed over the Cumberland Plateau to Nashville, Tennessee via the Cumberland River. The northern fork split into two parts. The eastern spur went into the Bluegrass region of Kentucky to Boonesborough on the Kentucky River (near Lexington). The western spur ran to the Falls of the Ohio (Louisville). As settlements grew southward, the road stretched all the way to Knoxville, Tennessee, by 1792.

===Western spur===
Due to road realignments in many places modern roads do not always follow the old wilderness trails.

====Skaggs Trace====
The western spur of the Wilderness road was originally known as Skaggs&#x27; Trace, named after the longhunter Henry Skaggs. The trace began just outside Hazel Patch, in present-day Laurel County, and continued to Crab Orchard.

====Logan&#x27;s Trace====
In 1775 Benjamin Logan&#x27;s party, that included John Floyd, split with Daniel Boone&#x27;s party and turned westward on Skaggs Trace. The trail went through the Crab Orchard approximately 10 miles where a Blockhouse was built to protect settlers in the area and named Logan&#x27;s Fort. From there the trail went to the area that became Danville (1783) originally named Crow&#x27;s Station in 1774, what would become Springfield (1793), Harrodsburg referred to as Harrod&#x27;s Town or Oldtown and founded by James Harrod on June 16, 1774, abandoned and resettled in 1775, Bardstown (settled in 1780), Shepherdsville (founded as Bullitt&#x27;s Lick in 1773), and the Falls of the Ohio.

Robert Emmett McDowell (1914–1975), Kentucky historian and Filson Historical Society member since 1956, claims there are errors in Filson&#x27;s map. The map shows the trail leaving Louisville through Sullivan&#x27;s Old Station, Kuvkendahl&#x27;s Mill, the Fishpools to Bullitt&#x27;s Lick, then through Bardstown to Danville. McDowell claims that originally the trail went through Harrodsburg not Danville, and Sullivan&#x27;s Old Station and Kuykendahl&#x27;s Mill were not on the main road but high water alternate paths. Further claims were made that the Wilderness Trail was improved after General George Rogers Clark landed at the Falls of the Ohio which would facilitate the movement of troops and supplies as well as settlers.

In 1784 Filson, also an historian, wrote &quot;The Discovery, Settlement and present State of Kentucke and an Essay towards the Topography, and Natural History of that important Country&quot;. Reuben Thomas Durrett indicates there are inaccuracies as well.

==Dangers==

Because of the threat of Native American attacks, the road was so dangerous that most pioneers traveled well armed. Robbers and criminals also could be found on the road, ready to pounce on weaker pioneers. Although the Transylvania Company had purchased the region from the Cherokee, and the Iroquois had ceded it at the Treaty of Fort Stanwix, other tribes, such as the Shawnee, still claimed it and lived there.
Often entire communities and church congregations would move together over the road to new settlements. Hundreds of pioneers were killed by Indian attacks.

Defensive log blockhouses built alongside the road had portholes in the walls for firing at Native American attackers. They were often called &quot;stations&quot;. No one knew exactly when the next attack would happen. The Shawnee came from the north, while the Chickamauga (Cherokees who rejected the land sale treaty) came from the south. The tribes were resentful of the settlers taking their ancestral hunting lands, and the French and Indian War had further stirred up their passions against the white man.

There was a great variety of animal life in the wilderness. At night, the pioneers could hear the hoots and screeches of owls, the howls of wolves, and the cries of panthers and wild cats. Sometimes the Native Americans imitated these sounds. Venomous snakes such as copperheads and rattlesnakes blended into the leaves and undergrowth and were a danger to the pioneers, their horses and cattle.

==Settlement==

Judge Richard Henderson had made a treaty with the Cherokee at Sycamore Shoals in 1775, purchasing over of land between the Cumberland and Kentucky Rivers. On March 28, 1775, he left Long Island (Kingsport, Tennessee) with about 30 horsemen on the grueling trip down the Wilderness Road to Kentucky. At Martin&#x27;s Station 40 to 50 additional pioneers joined the venture. On their way, they met nearly a hundred refugees fleeing Native American attacks further down the road.

Despite the danger, the party kept going toward Kentucky. Since some of the streams were flooded, the pioneers had to swim with their horses. On April 20, they arrived at Boonesborough, a fortified town, named by Judge Henderson in honor of Boone.
After 1770, a surge of over 400,000 Scots-Irish immigrants arrived in the colonies to escape the poor harvest, high rents and religious intolerance of Ulster. Since the better lands had already been taken, they constantly pressed onward to the western frontier of the foothills of the Carolinas.

The flood of Scots-Irish, German, and others immigrants kept coming. Over 200,000 pioneers came over the Wilderness Road, enduring severe hardships. In the winter of 1778–79, the weather was so cold that the Kentucky River froze to a depth of two feet. The frontier settlements alongside the road struggled to survive. Many of the cattle and hogs froze to death. The settlers had to eat frozen cattle and horses to survive.

Often the Chickamauga, under the leadership of Dragging Canoe, would hide in ambush for weeks between Cumberland Gap and Crab Orchard, a distance of . They would not attack large groups but wait for weaker ones who were not able to defend themselves. More than 100 men, women and children were killed in the fall of 1784 along the Wilderness Road. Many families, even in ice and snow, crossed the creeks and rivers without shoes or stockings; they often had no money and few clothes. They lived off the land by hunting in the woods and by fishing in the streams.

Since they had hardly any money, entire families sometimes walked hundreds of miles after landing in America. They even used cattle as pack animals to carry their heavy loads. Cabins were built and land was cleared of trees and undergrowth so crops could be planted.

Chestnut was the most popular wood since its logs could be used to build cabins and rail fences to protect crops from wild animals. It could easily be split into shingles for roofs to cover cabins and barns. Its bark was used to make medicine and tannic acid for tanning and dyeing. In the fall, its rich nuts were used to fatten razorback hogs for the market and the home. Hemlock was also highly valued for its many uses.

==Commerce and mail==
The Wilderness Road served as a great path of commerce for the early settlers in Kentucky, as well as for wagon-loads of slaves being transported through Tennessee to plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana. Horses, cattle, sheep and hogs herded in the other direction found waiting markets in the Carolinas, Maryland and Virginia. Hogs in groups of 500 or more were driven down the Road to market. Beef in Eastern markets had become a main source of income for farmers in Kentucky.

A postal road was opened in 1792 from Bean Station, Tennessee through Cumberland Gap to Danville, Kentucky. This was due largely to the efforts of Governor Isaac Shelby of Kentucky. This connection of Kentucky to the East was a great advantage. Frontier settlers considered the postal riders heroes and waited eagerly for their arrival for news from settlements along the trails as well as getting their mail and newspapers.

==Civil War and decline==

Use of the Wilderness Road fell when the National Road was opened in 1818, allowing travel to the Ohio River on more level ground from the East. The Panic of 1837, geology and new railroad technology doomed the James River Canal, once envisioned as augmenting this commercial route. At the same time, the steamboat first appeared on the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers, allowing faster and cheaper travel both up and down the rivers. During the 1850s, the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad was constructed along part of this route.

During the American Civil War, both the Union Army and the Confederate States Army used the Wilderness Road. An early battle (Camp Wildcat), stymied the first Confederate attempt to seize control of neutral Kentucky. The Cumberland Gap changed hands four times throughout the war. Southern troops used the road for marches into Virginia. General Ulysses S. Grant came down the road for the Union campaign in Tennessee in 1864. Grant was so taken by the Road that he said, &quot;With two brigades of the Army of the Cumberland I could hold that pass against the army which Napoleon led to Moscow.&quot;

==Preservation ==

A segment of the Wilderness Road was among the first roads in the United States to be paved. The old road from the town of Cumberland Gap, Tennessee to Middlesboro, Kentucky through the mountain pass was paved and completed on October 3, 1908. This was an &quot;object-lesson&quot; road (a new kind of paved macadam construction funded by local communities but with federal governmental supervision) initiated by the U.S. Office of Public Roads. At that time, only about of paved roads existed in the United States. Its name was later changed to U.S. Route 25E. This new road brought a new industry, tourism, to the rural areas filling hotels and restaurants with travelers.
Cumberland Gap is a National Historical Park, and portions of the Wilderness Road can be visited at Wilderness Road State Park in Virginia. Additionally, a reconstructed fort at Martin&#x27;s Station in Virginia on the Wilderness Road can be visited about east of the Cumberland Gap. Since the completion of the Cumberland Gap Tunnel in 1996, a project has been underway to restore the original appearance of the Wilderness Road as it crosses the historic Cumberland Gap.

Since 2001, Hwy. 25E has been obliterated over several miles of its length and the original grade restored, including the addition of of elevation to restore the Gap to its original contour, with virtually all modern artifacts, buildings and roads removed. The replanting of thousands of seedlings from original forest stocks in the area is intended, over a period of decades, to recreate a forest that will allow visitors to view the crossing of the Gap on the Wilderness Road as travelers would have experienced it circa 1790. This section of the Wilderness Road is now a hiking trail, including an interpretive center about the road&#x27;s history located on the Tennessee side.

<doc id="1100809" wikidata="Q476836" url="?curid=1100809" title="Arsenal de Sarandí">
<text>Arsenal Fútbol Club (), usually referred as Arsenal de Sarandí , or simply Arsenal, is an Argentine sports club from the Sarandí district of Avellaneda Partido, Greater Buenos Aires.

The football team currently plays in Primera Nacional, the second division of the Argentine football league system. The squad plays its home games at the Estadio Julio H. Grondona, named after one of the founders, which has a capacity of 18,500. It opened in 1964 but was not used in the First Division until 2004. The club&#x27;s colours are red and light blue, in honour of the traditional teams of Avellaneda (Independiente and Racing). Arsenal won its first Primera División championship in 2012. Until then, club&#x27;s major title had been the Copa Sudamericana win in 2007.

Apart from football, the club hosts other sports such as field hockey, futsal, and handball.

==History==
===The beginning===

The club was founded in January 1957 by brothers Héctor and Julio Humberto Grondona, inspired by the English club Arsenal. Not only does it share its name with the eponymous Gunners of North London, the stories of the naming of the two clubs are very similar – both had military arsenals nearby. The team&#x27;s shirt colour is light blue with a diagonal red band (similar to the shirt used by River Plate). The colours were chosen as a combination of the two older clubs in Avellaneda – Racing (light blue) and Independiente (red).
Julio Grondona went on to become president of Independiente, and then, in 1979, president of the Argentine Football Association, until 2014. He was also a vice-president of FIFA. Héctor Grondona, and then son Julio Ricardo, became presidents of Arsenal.

The club&#x27;s best known former player is Jorge Burruchaga, who started his career at Arsenal in 1979, and had several stints as coach. &quot;Burru&quot;, as he is nicknamed, scored the winning goal for Argentina in the 1986 FIFA World Cup final against Germany.

Arsenal&#x27;s football team was promoted to successively higher divisions in 1962, 1986 and 1992, finally reaching the Primera División in 2002.

On 6 September 2006, Arsenal and Spanish club FC Barcelona (Barça) struck a deal whereby in exchange for the option to acquire young players that have not played more than one year in the Arsenal first team, Barça would help to improve Arsenal&#x27;s infrastructure.

A member from Barça was to oversee the project, and visit the club on a monthly basis. This deal, however, fell through in 2007, reportedly because Arsenal could not afford the infrastructure to keep up with the plan.

===International tournaments===
The club&#x27;s first appearance in an international tournament was in 2004, when, coached by Burruchaga, Arsenal reached the Quarter-finals of the Copa Sudamericana, eliminating Banfield and River Plate before losing to Bolivian club, Bolívar in its first ever official tie with a non-Argentine team.

Arsenal&#x27;s results in the Apertura and Clausura of the 2006–07 season, qualified them for two major international tournaments, the secondary 2007 Copa Sudamericana and the top 2008 Copa Libertadores, the first time in their history that Arsenal qualified for South America&#x27;s premier club tournament.

Arsenal&#x27;s run through the 2007 Copa Sudamericana would lead &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; to declare them &quot;the underdog that couldn&#x27;t be stopped&quot;. They beat reigning Argentine champions San Lorenzo in the qualifying round to earn a place in the Round of 16 where it faced Brazilian team Goiás. Arsenal won 3–2 in Brazil and recorded a 1–1 draw in the second leg to win the tie 4–3 on aggregate, achieving its first official victory over foreign opposition. Arsenal then met Mexican side Guadalajara in the quarter-finals, with a 0–0 draw at home, and a 3–1 victory at Estadio Jalisco. Advancing to the semi-finals, Arsenal met the other Argentine team still in the running, River Plate. Both games against River ended 0–0, Arsenal progressing to the final after winning the penalty shootout 4–2, with a number of saves from Mario Cuenca, Arsenal&#x27;s goalkeeper.

In the first leg of the 2007 Copa Sudamericana final, Arsenal beat Club América of Mexico 3–2 at Estadio Azteca. Their upcoming home field advantage was mitigated by the fact that the second match could not be held in the Estadio Julio H. Grondona, because its capacity of 16,300 did not meet the CONMEBOL criteria of 40,000 for major finals. The game was finally held at the Estadio Juan Domingo Perón in Avellaneda. Arsenal entered the match without captain Carlos Castiglione, who was suspended due to a red card in the first leg. With these mitigating factors, Arsenal needed to avoid letting Club América win by a two-goal margin. The match started badly for the Argentine team when Christian Díaz scored an own goal inside the first 20 minutes. José Luis Calderón then hit the woodwork twice for Arsenal. In the 2nd half Arsenal conceded a second goal, but with only 7 minutes remaining Martín Andrizzi scored, giving Arsenal their first major title on the away goals rule.

Arsenal was not as successful in the 2008 Copa Libertadores, which started the month after their 2007 Copa Sudamericana. However, on 30 July 2008, Arsenal won its second international cup, the Suruga Bank Championship, which they qualified for as Copa Sudamericana champion. The rival was J.League Cup champions Gamba Osaka from Japan. After a hard match, captain Carlos Casteglione scored the only goal with a precise header on the 86th minute of play.

===First domestic titles===
Arsenal won its first championship on 24 June 2012 after defeating Belgrano de Córdoba 1–0 with a goal scored by Lisandro López. The squad totalized 38 points over 19 games played, with 11 matches won and only 3 defeats. Arsenal also became the first team to win a Primera División title after playing in the five divisions that Argentine football league system is made of. As champions, Arsenal classified for the Supercopa Argentina, a one-match tournament between the Primera División and the Copa Argentina winners. On 7 November 2012 Arsenal defeated Copa Argentina champions Boca Juniors 4–3 by penalties after a 0–0 draw.

Arsenal won the Copa Argentina on 16 October 2013 by defeating San Lorenzo de Almagro 3–0 in a final match played at the Catamarca Province

==Stadium==
The Estadio Julio H. Grondona in Sarandí has a capacity of 36,300, and is known as &quot;el Viaducto&quot; (The Viaduct). It is located at 3660 Juan Díaz De Solís in Sarandí.

Arsenal&#x27;s first stadium was started to be built on 11 October 1962, officially opening on 22 August 1964. When Arsenal won promotion to the Primera, its basic concrete stadium was deemed unfit for the league and the team played at the grounds of Lanús and Racing for two seasons until work on the stadium was complete. The remodeled stadium (named &quot;Julio Humberto Grondona&quot;) was opened on 7 August 2004 with a party for the fans. The first game was against Banfield in the Copa Sudamericana. The new stadium has witnessed defeats of the biggest teams in Argentine football such as Boca Juniors and River Plate.

<text>Jelon Vieira is a Brazilian choreographer and teacher who, in 2000, achieved recognition by New York City&#x27;s Brazilian Cultural Center as a pioneer in presenting to American audiences the Afro-Brazilian art and dance form, Capoeira.

In 1975, Vieira and fellow choreographer/performer Loremil Machado became the first capoeira mestres to live and teach in the United States. Vieira states that their first jobs in New York were doing capoeira demonstrations in Bronx public schools and that he spent the summer of 1975 doing weekly demonstrations in Central Park. His early supporters included choreographer Alvin Ailey, off-Broadway theater pioneer Ellen Stewart, and Brooklyn schoolteacher and martial artist Robert Cooper. In the 1970s, Vieira and Machado taught and performed in multiple locations across New York City, with notable venues including the Clark Center for the Performing Arts and &quot;for four or five years,&quot; a weekly performance set to jazz music at the Cachaça nightclub on East 62nd Street.

For over a quarter century, as the founder and artistic director of The Capoeira Foundation, Vieira has guided the dance company, DanceBrazil through critically acclaimed engagements across the United States, including performances at Spoleto Festival USA, the Kennedy Center and Lincoln Center. The company has also toured in Europe, Asia and Brazil and has been featured on the PBS documentary series, &quot;EGG, the Arts Show&quot; and &quot;Alive from Off-Center&quot;.

Vieira has worked with numerous major cultural institutions, including NYC&#x27;s Caribbean Cultural Center and San Antonio&#x27;s Carver Community Cultural Center. In 1999, City Lore, a New York City community organization, inducted him into its Hall of Fame for lifetime contribution. In addition to his solo performances and works for DanceBrazil, his choreographic credits include the films &quot;Brenda Starr&quot;, &quot;Rooftops&quot;, and &quot;Boomerang&quot;.

For &quot;Times Square 2000&quot;, the globally televised, multinational 24-hour dance marathon in New York City, Vieira was chosen to create the only Brazilian performance. He has been a guest master teacher at Yale University, Oberlin College, Columbia University, Princeton University, Stanford University and other institutions.

In 2000, he was the Bacardi Distinguished Visiting Eminent Scholar at the University of Florida in Gainesville. He has taught Capoeira to legendary footballer Pelé and American movie stars Wesley Snipes and Eddie Murphy. Snipes, himself a top martial arts practitioner, has described Vieira as one of &quot;the masters of the martial arts of the 20th century&quot;.

He is a recipient of a 2008 National Heritage Fellowship awarded by the National Endowment for the Arts, which is the United States government&#x27;s highest honor in the folk and traditional arts.

Upon returning to Brazil, in his home community of Boca do Rio, a bairro of the nation&#x27;s third-largest city, Salvador, Vieira continues to teach children and young adults the art of Capoeira to build self-esteem, instill self-discipline and raise social consciousness while at the same time becoming a vital part of their own community. In 2007, after having devoted many years to &quot;Grupo Capoeira Brasil&quot;, he founded &quot;Grupo Capoeira Luanda&quot;.

<text>Comanche is a series of simulation games published by NovaLogic, later THQ Nordic after their acquisition. The goal of each of these games is to fly military missions in a RAH-66 Comanche attack helicopter, which was in development and prototyping at the time of release.

&quot;Comanche&quot; was the first commercial flight simulation based on voxel technology via the company&#x27;s proprietary Voxel Space engine (written entirely in assembly language). This rendering technique allowed for much more detailed and realistic terrain compared to simulations based on vector graphics at that time.

==Games==
Throughout the years, several games and add-ons have been published:
*&quot;&quot; (1992)
**&quot;Comanche: Global Challenge&quot; (1993) - three new campaigns
**&quot;Comanche: Over the Edge&quot; (1993) - four new campaigns
**&quot;Comanche CD&quot; (1994) - a compilation of &quot;Maximum Overkill&quot; and mission disks, plus 10 bonus missions. Rereleased in 1997 from SoftKey As Comanche CD Special Edition. Includes a demo of America Online, and features Windows 95 compatibility.
*&quot;Werewolf vs Comanche&quot; (1995) - a pack of two games with a compatible multiplayer mode
**&quot;Comanche 2&quot; (1996) - the stand-alone release of the Comanche portion of &quot;Werewolf vs. Comanche&quot;.
*&quot;Comanche 3&quot; (1997)
**&quot;Comanche Gold&quot; (1998) - &quot;Comanche 3&quot; with additional campaigns and various enhancements
*&quot;Comanche 4&quot; (2001)
* &quot;Comanche&quot; (2021) - set in the near-future. Early access version was released on Steam on 12 March 2020 1.0 release was on 26 August 2021. The game was developed by Nukklear before early access release and then by Ashborne Games.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot;″s reviewer—United States Army Aviation AH-64 pilot Bryan Walker—liked &quot;Comanche Maximum Overkill&quot; in 1993, calling it an &quot;eye-popping glimpse into 21st-century helicopter warfare&quot;. He stated that it created a &quot;more believable terrain model than the Army&#x27;s Combat Mission Simulator&quot; and was the first game to replicate &quot;the thrill of low-altitude flying&quot;. Walker enjoyed the flight model&#x27;s stability and ease of use, and reported that the cockpit corresponded to MANPRINT (&quot;Manpower and Personnel Integration&quot;) principles. He compared the helicopter&#x27;s handling as akin to &quot;a slug ... joystick jocks may end up gritting their teeth&quot;, and also criticized the &quot;meager&quot; choice of missions and enemy targets, and the unrealistically high durability and weapon loads. Walker nonetheless concluded that &quot;cutting-edge graphics firepower gives [it] the edge to sweep more than a couple of competitors off the battlefield&quot;.

In 1993 Walker reviewed &quot;Mission Disk One&quot; for the magazine, stating that he &quot;honestly expected more from an add-on disk that retails for $40&quot;. He criticized the lack of improvement in the flight model (&quot;&quot;CMO&quot;″s Comanche still flies like Barney Fife is at the controls&quot;), and concluded that it &quot;is like refueling a gunship without rearming it&quot;. In 1994 Walker liked the harder difficulty of the &quot;Over the Edge&quot; mission disk&#x27;s &quot;40 tough new missions&quot;, as well as the improved graphics and controls. He concluded that the expansion &quot;clearly shows the superiority of the new features and makes for a far more enjoyable game&quot;. Walker also liked the &quot;Comanche CD&quot; compilation but only recommended it to those new to the game or without the expansions. He reiterated, however, that &quot;many of the limitations I noted in my review of the original &quot;CMO&quot; are still present ... it would be nice to see NovaLogic produce a chopper title on par with &quot;Falcon 3.0&quot; in the technical realism arena&quot;.

A reviewer for &quot;Next Generation&quot; opined that &quot;For pure multiplayer action, &quot;Werewolf vs. Comanche&quot; is hard to beat.&quot; He noted that because the two crafts are on separate discs, gamers only needed to buy half as many copies of the game as the number of players in a networked session. He scored it four out of five stars.

&quot;Comanche Maximum Overdrive&quot; was nominated for an award at the 1993 Game Developers Conference.

The overall &quot;Comanche&quot; series achieved combined global sales of 2.5 million copies by November 2001, before the release of &quot;Comanche 4&quot;.

&quot;Comanche Mac&quot; received 4 out of 5 stars from &quot;MacUser&quot;. In 1995, Flux magazine ranked Comanche 18th on their Top 100 Video Games. They praised the game calling it: &quot;One of the most graphically pleasing flight sims around.&quot;

<doc id="1100845" wikidata="Q1644726" url="?curid=1100845" title="Oera Linda Book">
<text>The Oera Linda Book is a manuscript written in imitated Old Frisian, purporting to cover historical, mythological, and religious themes of remote antiquity, from 2194 BCE to 803 CE. Among academics in Germanic philology, the document is considered to be a hoax or forgery.

The manuscript first came to public awareness in the 1860s. In 1872, Jan Gerhardus Ottema published a Dutch translation and defended it as genuine. Over the next few years there was a heated public controversy, but by 1879 it was universally accepted that the text was a recent composition. Nevertheless, a public controversy was revived in the context of 1930s Nazi occultism, and the book is still occasionally brought up in esotericism and Atlantis literature. The manuscript&#x27;s author is not known with certainty, hence it is unknown whether the intention was to produce a pseudepigraphical hoax, a parody, or simply an exercise in poetic fantasy.

Historian Goffe Jensma published a monograph on the manuscript in 2004, &quot;De gemaskerde god&quot; (The Masked God), including a discussion of the history of its reception and a new translation in 2006. Jensma concludes that it was probably intended as a &quot;hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians,&quot; as well as an &quot;experiential exemplary exercise&quot; by Dutch theologian and poet François Haverschmidt. 

==History of reception==

===19th century===
The Oera Linda Book, known in Old Frisian as &quot;Thet Oera Linda Bok&quot;, came to light in 1867 when Cornelis Over de Linden (1811–1874) handed the manuscript, which he claimed to have inherited from his grandfather, via his aunt, over to Eelco Verwijs (1830–1880), the provincial librarian of Friesland, for translation and publication. Verwijs rejected the manuscript, but in 1872 Jan Gerhardus Ottema (1804–1879), a prominent member of the Frisian Society for History and Culture, published a Dutch translation. Ottema believed it to be written in authentic Old Frisian. The book was subsequently translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876, and published by Trübner &amp; Co. of London.

Within the first few years after the appearance of the Oera Linda Book, its recent origin was established not only based on the exceptional claims being made, but also because of a number of anachronisms it contained. The text was nevertheless a source of inspiration for a number of occultists and speculative historians. While there was some debate among Dutch academics and in a number of newspapers about the book&#x27;s authenticity during the 1870s, by 1879 it was widely recognized as a forgery.

===Nazi Germany===
More than forty years later, beginning in 1922, Dutch &quot;völkisch&quot; philologist Herman Wirth revived the issue. Wirth published a German translation of what he dubbed the &quot;Nordic Bible&quot; in 1933, as &quot;Die Ura Linda Chronik&quot;.

A panel discussion on Wirth&#x27;s book at the University of Berlin on 4 May 1934 was the immediate impulse for the foundation of &quot;Ahnenerbe&quot; by Himmler and Wirth, together with Richard Walther Darré. Because of the infatuation of Himmler with the Oera Linda Book and its consequent association with Nazi occultism, it became known as &quot;Himmler&#x27;s Bible&quot;. Wirth&#x27;s book was by no means universally acclaimed among the Nazi-era Nordicist academics, and the 1934 panel discussion was steeped in heated controversy. Alfred Rosenberg and his circle rejected it. Gustav Neckel had praised Wirth&#x27;s work before publication, but upon seeing its content published a dismayed recension.

Speaking in defense of the book&#x27;s authenticity were Walther Wüst and Otto Huth, besides Wirth himself. Speaking against its authenticity were Neckel, Karl Hermann Jacob-Friesen (who said it was a satirical hoax by Linden) and Arthur Hübner. Hübner was one of the most respected Germanists of his generation, and his verdict of the Oera Linda being a falsification settled the defeat of Wirth&#x27;s party. The public defeat of Himmler&#x27;s scholarly brand of &quot;esoteric Nordicism&quot; resulted in the foundation of Ahnenerbe, which attracted occultists such as Karl Maria Wiligut and was viewed with suspicion by the mainstream National Socialist ideologues of Amt Rosenberg.

===Modern esotericism===
The book experienced a revival of popularity in the English-speaking world with the writings of Robert Scrutton. In &quot;The Other Atlantis&quot; (1977) he reproduced the full text of Sandbach&#x27;s 1876 English translation, interspersed with his own commentaries on history and mythology. In &quot;Secrets of Lost Atland&quot; (1979) he became the first to link the book with the concept of earth mysteries, and, in particular, ley lines and telluric energy. Following Scrutton&#x27;s example, English language accounts of the Oera Linda Book tend to place it within the New Age or alternate history genres, and do not associate it with National Socialism, as is the case in Germany.

Another figure to formulate a contemporary Neopagan tradition influenced by the Oera Linda Book was Tony Steele, who considered the book to reveal the genuine truth about the ancient European megalithic culture. In &quot;Water Witches&quot; (1998) he examined the book&#x27;s use as a cultural identity marker by the Frisian-descended canal folk of the English Midlands. In &quot;The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft&quot; (2001) he connected the religious practices of the priestesses described in the book with later medieval witchcraft traditions. Steele&#x27;s 2023 horror thriller novel &quot;In a Flat Landscape&quot; also makes the Oera Linda Book a central part of the story.

Russia

A new stir rose in Russia in the 1990s when political philosopher Alexander Dugin took up the work of Herman Wirth. In his influential 1999 anthology &quot;Absoliutnaia rodina&quot;, he views the book of Oera Linda as a textbook example of a deeply rooted myth of the Aryan race that can easily be transformed into political ideologies. This is exactly what he did, according to critics: the chronicle was used to support a Eurasianism worldview, while ironically he hated the epic from the Atlantic world. As a counterpart to Friesian history, Dugin promoted the myth of the supposedly lost &quot;Palestinabuch&quot;, in which Wirth is said to have described the true history of the Jewish people. In 2007, one of his students provided a Russian translation of the Oera Linda Book with a detailed preface.

==Authorship==
Among those who doubt the book&#x27;s authenticity, the most popular candidates for the author of the manuscript are Cornelis Over de Linden or Eelco Verwijs. A recent third choice is the Protestant preacher François Haverschmidt (1835–1894), well known for writing poetry under the pseudonym Piet Paaltjens. Haverschmidt lived in Friesland and was an acquaintance of Verwijs.

Goffe Jensma (2004) argued that Haverschmidt was the main writer of the book, with the help of Over de Linden and Verwijs. According to Jensma, who would later become professor of Frisian language and literature at the University of Groningen, Haverschmidt intended the Oera Linda Book as a parody of the Christian Bible. An article in late 2007 by Jensma says that the three authors of the translation intended it &quot;to be a temporary hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians and as an experiential exemplary exercise in reading the Holy Bible in a non-fundamentalist, symbolical way.&quot; Ignoring clues that it was a forgery, J. G. Ottema took it seriously, and it achieved popularity for the reasons given above. Its creators felt unable to admit that they had written it, and it became the foundation for new occult beliefs. Jensma concludes his article by saying &quot;It is a perfect irony that a book written to unmask the Holy Bible as a book of human making was to become a bible itself.&quot;

==Contents==
Themes running through the Oera Linda Book include catastrophism, nationalism, matriarchy, and mythology. The text alleges that Europe and other lands were, for a large part of their history, ruled by a succession of folk-mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess Frya, daughter of the creator god Wr-alda and Jrtha, the earth mother. The claim is also made that this Frisian civilization possessed an alphabet that was the ancestor of the Greek and Phoenician alphabets. Modern historiography is essentially ignored, particularly in the area of basic chronology of known events in the recent and distant past of Europe. Geographical evidence that was readily available even as far back as Over de Linden&#x27;s time is incorrectly reported. 

The earliest portion of the Oera Linda Book, namely &quot;Frya&#x27;s Tex&quot;, was supposedly composed in 2194 BC, whereas the most recent part, the letter of Hidde Oera Linda, claims to date to AD 1256. Almost half of the entire book comprises &quot;The Book of Adela&#x27;s Followers&quot;, the original text around which the rest grew. It is purported to have been compiled in the 6th century BC from a mixture of contemporary writings and ancient inscriptions. The last two sections of the Oera Linda Book contain a number of lacunae and the book itself breaks off in mid-sentence.

It also describes a lost land called &#x27;Atland&#x27; (the name given to Atlantis by the 17th-century scholar Olof Rudbeck), which was supposedly submerged in 2194 BC – the same year as 19th-century Dutch and Frisian almanacs, following traditional Biblical chronology, gave for Noah&#x27;s flood.

<text>Robert Jervis (April 30, 1940 – December 9, 2021) was an American political scientist who was the Adlai E. Stevenson Professor of International Politics in the Department of Political Science at Columbia University. Jervis was co-editor of the &quot;Cornell Studies in Security Affairs&quot;, a series published by Cornell University Press.

He is known for his contributions to political psychology, international relations theory, nuclear strategy, and intelligence studies. According to the Open Syllabus Project, Jervis is one of the most-frequently cited authors on college syllabi for political science courses.

==Early life and education==
Robert Jervis was born in New York City in 1940. He earned a BA from Oberlin College in 1962. At Oberlin, he developed an interest in nuclear strategy, and was influenced by Thomas Schelling’s &quot;Strategy of Conflict&quot; and Glenn Snyder’s &quot;Deterrence and Defense.&quot; In 1962, he began graduate work at University of California, Berkeley, where he studied under Glenn Snyder. He received a PhD from UC Berkeley in 1968.

== Career ==
From 1968 to 1972, he was an assistant professor of government at Harvard University and was an associate professor from 1972 to 1974. According to Jervis, Schelling brought him to Harvard.&quot;&quot; In 1974, Jervis was a candidate for the tenured chair vacated by Henry Kissinger when he started working in the Richard Nixon administration, but the Government department at Harvard did not consider Jervis qualified. At Harvard, he developed a close friendship with Schelling and Kenneth Waltz.&quot;&quot; From 1974 to 1980, he was a professor of political science at the University of California, Los Angeles. He was a member of the Columbia University faculty from 1980 until his death in 2021. He was a member of the Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies in the School of International and Public Affairs. He was president of the American Political Science Association in 2000–2001.

Jervis consulted for the CIA.&quot;&quot;

He worked on perceptions and misperceptions in foreign policy decision making. Jervis played a key role in introducing insights from psychology to International Relations scholarship. Charles Glaser described Jervis&#x27;s work on the security dilemma as &quot;among the most important works in international relations of the past few decades.&quot;

According to Jack Snyder, &quot;Jervis&#x27;s body of thought can be categorized in terms of five interrelated themes: communication in strategic bargaining, perception and misperception in international politics, cooperation in anarchy, the nuclear revolution, and complex system effects and unintended consequences.&quot; According to Thomas J. Christensen and Keren Yarhi-Milo, &quot;in seeking to understand both behavior and outcomes in world affairs, Jervis championed the role of individuals’ perceptions and formative experiences rather than just broad political, social, and economic forces... [His] work was always rooted in the complexities of actual decision-making by real people with quirks and flaws.&quot;

Jervis was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. In 2006 he was awarded the NAS Award for Behavior Research Relevant to the Prevention of Nuclear War from the National Academy of Sciences. He participated in the 2010 Hertog Global Strategy Initiative, a high-level research program on nuclear proliferation.

In 2021, he was elected member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences. Jervis was the recipient of the 1990 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order.

==Personal life and death==
Jervis met his wife Kathe (née Weil) Jervis in 1961 on a student trip to the Soviet Union. Together they had two daughters, Alexa and Lisa. Lisa Jervis is a co-founder of &quot;Bitch&quot; magazine.

In the early 1960s, while studying for his PhD in Political Science at the University of California at Berkeley, Jervis participated in the Free Speech Movement.

Jervis died of lung cancer in his Manhattan home on December 9, 2021, at the age of 81. He is honored at Columbia University with an annual conference bearing his name.

<doc id="1100854" wikidata="Q3430812" url="?curid=1100854" title="Richard Grey (priest)">
<text>Richard Grey D.D. (6 April 1696 – 28 February 1771) was an English churchman and author, archdeacon of Bedford from 1757. He is now remembered for his &quot;Memoria Technica&quot;, a work on a memory system.

==Life==
He was born in Newcastle, the son of John Grey. He matriculated at Lincoln College, Oxford, 20 June 1712, and graduated B.A. in 1716 and M.A. 16 January 1719. He was ordained in 1719, and became chaplain and secretary to Nathaniel Crew, bishop of Durham. Crew had him presented in the following year to the rectory of Hinton, Northamptonshire. Through the same influence Grey obtained the little rectory of Steane Chapel, and in 1725 the additional living of Kimcote, near Lutterworth, Leicestershire. He was also appointed a prebendary of St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, London, and official and commissary of the archdeaconry of Leicester. He proceeded D.D. in 1731, and was archdeacon of Bedford from 1757 for the rest of his life.

Grey was a friend of Philip Doddridge, was well known to Samuel Johnson, who admired his learning, and was intimate with John Moore. He died on 28 February 1771 and was buried at Hinton, where he had been rector for fifty years.

==&quot;Memoria Technica&quot;==
In 1730 appeared Grey&#x27;s &#x27;Memoria Technica; or a new Method of Artificial Memory.&#x27; Grey&#x27;s system consisted in changing the last syllable of names into letters which represented figures according to an arbitrary table, and in stringing together the new formations in lines with a hexameter beat. It therefore uses strings of letters to remember numbers. Example: az = 10, tel = 325, teib = 381. The &#x27;Memoria Technica&#x27; was applied to the dates and figures of chronology, geography, measures of weight and length, astronomy, and so on, and though uncouth and complicated met with great favour. The book went through several editions in the author&#x27;s lifetime, and continued to be reprinted with modifications till 1861. On Grey&#x27;s system were founded Solomon Lowe&#x27;s &#x27;Mnemonics,&#x27; and several aids to memory connected with other names.

According to Francis Fauvel Gouraud, Grey indicated that a discussion on Hebrew linguistics in William Beveridge (bishop)&#x27;s &quot;Institutionum chronotogicarum libri duo, una cum totidem arithmetices chronologicæ libellis&quot; (London, 1669) inspired him to create his system of mnemotechniques which later evolved in to the Mnemonic major system.

==Other works==
Greay&#x27;s numerous publications began with &quot;An Answer to Barbeyrac&#x27;s Spirit of the Ecclesiastics of all Ages as to the Doctrines of Morality&quot;, 1722. In 1730 he published &quot;A System of English Ecclesiastical Law, extracted from the &quot;Codex Juris Ecclesiastici Angli&quot;&quot; of Bishop Edmund Gibson, for the use of students for holy orders. It was in recognition of this work, which passed through four editions in a few years, that the University of Oxford gave him the degree of D.D.

In 1736 Grey published &quot;The Miserable and Distracted State of Religion in England&quot;, after previous consultation with Dr. Zachary Grey. Three pedagogic works on Hebrew were &quot;A New and Easy Method of Learning Hebrew without points, to which is added by way of Praxis the Book of Proverbs divided according to the metre, with the Masoretical readings in Roman letters&quot; (1739, 3 parts), &quot;Tabula exhibens Paradigmata Verborum Hebraicorum&quot; (1739), and &quot;Historia Josephi Patriarchi; praemittitur nova methodus Hebraice discendi&quot;. &quot;Liber Jobi in versiculos metrice divisus; accedit canticum Moysis&quot; from 1742 resulted in the 1744 &quot;An Answer to Mr. Warburton&#x27;s &quot;Remarks on several Occasional Reflections&quot; so far as they concern the preface to a late edition of the Book of Job&quot;, in allusion to which William Warburton in the second part of his &#x27;Remarks&#x27; called him an &quot;impotent railer&quot;. &quot;The Last Words of David, divided according to Metre, with Notes Critical and Explanatory&quot; and the 1754 &quot;Of the Immortality of the Soul, from the Latin of I. H. Browne&quot; were translations. Grey also printed sermons and pamphlets on religious subjects.

==Family==
Grey married Joyce, youngest daughter of John Thicknesse, rector of Farthingo, Northamptonshire, and brother of Philip Thicknesse. She died on 12 January 1794, aged 89. He left three daughters, of whom the eldest, Joyce, married at the age of forty-five Dr. Philip Lloyd, dean of Norwich, and was known for painted windows in Norwich Cathedral. The youngest, Bridget, married the Rev. William Thomas Bowles, and was mother of William Lisle Bowles.

<text>The Ontario Energy Board is the provincial regulator of natural gas and electricity utilities in Ontario, Canada. This includes setting rates, and licensing all participants in the electricity sector including the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO), generators, transmitters, distributors, wholesalers and electricity retailers, as well as natural gas marketers who sell to low volume customers.

To ensure an adequate level of consumer protection in the energy markets, the Board developed codes of conduct for gas marketers and electricity retailers, and established a complaint resolution process for energy consumers. The Board also provides a broad range of information to energy consumers about electricity and natural gas in Ontario.

The Board oversees the electricity market and ensures regulated gas and electricity monopoly utilities comply with Board decisions and orders. This includes conducting audits, performing compliance monitoring activities and monitoring various aspects of the gas and electricity utilities’ financial operating performance.

==Electricity==
In the electricity sector, the Board sets transmission and distribution rates, and approves the IESO&#x27;s budget and fees. The Board also sets the regulated price of electricity for residential and small business consumers on the Regulated Price Plan. Consumers who have signed contracts with an electricity retailer will pay the price set out in their contract.
The Board licenses all electricity retailers who sell electricity to residential and small commercial consumers.

Prior approval by the Board is required for: 
* Construction of electricity transmission lines longer than two kilometres;
* Amalgamation between an electricity distributor and another company; 
* Acquisition of a significant shareholding (in excess of 20 per cent of the voting securities) of an electricity transmission or distribution company; 
* Disposal of electricity transmission or distribution assets; 
* Acquisition of electricity transmission or distribution assets by an electricity generation company or affiliate; and 
* Acquisition of electricity generation facilities by an electricity transmission or distribution company or affiliate.

The Board also monitors markets in the electricity sector and reports to the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure on the efficiency, fairness, transparency and competitiveness of the markets, and reports any abuse or potential abuse of market power. The Board may also be asked to review the IESO market rules and consider appeals of IESO orders.

==Natural gas==
In the natural gas sector, utilities are required to submit the rates they propose to charge their customers to the Board for review. The Board approves rates associated with the cost to transport, store and distribute natural gas from utilities to consumers as well as charges to administer natural gas accounts. The Board also approves the price utilities can charge consumers for the natural gas they use. Natural gas utilities do not make a profit on the sale of natural gas. It is sold to consumers with no mark-up. Consumers who have signed contracts with a natural gas marketer will pay the price set out in their contract.

The Board licenses all natural gas marketers who sell natural gas to residential and small commercial consumers.

The Board is required to determine if constructing a natural gas pipeline is in the public interest by considering need, safety, economic feasibility, community benefits, security of supply and environmental impacts. Each municipality may grant a gas utility the right to deliver gas service and use road allowances or utility easements within its borders. The specific terms and conditions of these franchise agreements between the municipality and the utility are subject to Board approval.

The Board also reviews applications by gas distributors to create and operate underground gas storage areas and designates geological formations suitable to store natural gas in Ontario. 
Board approval is also required before a natural gas utility can sell its distribution system or amalgamate with another distributor.

There are currently two default service providers of natural gas in Ontario, Enbridge and Union Gas. These two entities are regulated by the Board.
The Board does not regulate competitive services in the natural gas sector. These include the sale of natural gas, water heater rentals and repair or maintenance services. These products and services are competitive services and can be obtained from various companies.

<doc id="1100874" wikidata="Q1644152" url="?curid=1100874" title="Godrevy">
<text>Godrevy (, meaning &quot;small farms&quot;) ( ) is an area on the eastern side of St Ives Bay, west Cornwall, England, United Kingdom, which faces the Atlantic Ocean. It is popular with both the surfing community and walkers. It is part owned by the National Trust, and offshore on Godrevy Island is a lighthouse maintained by Trinity House which is said to be the inspiration for Virginia Woolf&#x27;s novel &quot;To the Lighthouse&quot;. Godrevy lies within the Cornwall Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and the South West Coast Path runs around the whole promontory. There are several public car parks on the western side where the National Trust owns and operates a café.

== Godrevy Head ==

The headland () is on the Atlantic coast in Cornwall on the eastern side of St Ives Bay and about three miles (5 km) northeast of the town of Hayle. The nearest village is Gwithian, half a mile west beyond Godrevy Bridge across the Red River. The promontory is roughly square in shape and faces north into the Atlantic occupying an area of approximately . In 1939, and of coastline was donated to the National Trust by D. W. Thomas of Gwithian, followed by a further of land adjoining Godrevy Farm in 1962 by Nicholas and Charles Thomas. Godrevy Head has some of the best coastal heathland in Cornwall, with many species of plant, animal and insect life. Part of the headland, along with the coast to the east, was designated as part of the Godrevy Head to St Agnes SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest) in 1951.

The western side of Godrevy Head is bounded by rocks to the north and a wide sandy beach to the south which is popular for surfing. At the north-western corner of the headland is Godrevy Point; at the north-eastern corner is Navax Point (, meaning &quot;head of the autumn dwelling&quot;). The cliffs between the two points are approximately above sea level.

On the northern side of the headland are two coves named Mutton Cove and Kynance Cove (, meaning &quot;cove of the autumn dwelling&quot;) beyond which the Nathaga Rocks (, meaning &quot;milky ones&quot;) lie off Navax Point. On the eastern side of the headland are Castle Giver Cove (, meaning &quot;cove of the goat&#x27;s castle&quot;) and Fishing Cove.

South of Navax Point is an area of heath named The Knavocks (, meaning &quot;autumn dwelling&quot;) which is managed by The National Trust. The grassland and gorse scrub is criss-crossed with footpaths and is home to many species of butterflies and birds, notably nesting European stonechats. The Knavocks, like other coastal heathlands in Cornwall, is managed by regularly cutting back the gorse and by grazing, the National Trust having introduced a herd of ponies for the purpose.

Beyond Fishing Cove, the coast swings to the east towards Hell&#x27;s Mouth and North Cliffs. The land here rises to approximately , the highest point on this section of clifftop.

The cliffs, offshore rocks and coast around Godrevy Head form a renowned habitat for seabirds including cormorants, fulmars, guillemots, and razorbills and several species of gull. There is also a substantial population of grey seals throughout the year. Occasionally, bottlenose dolphins can be seen in the area.

==Godrevy Island and The Stones==

Godrevy Island lies approx three hundred yards off Godrevy Point. The uninhabited island is the site of Godrevy Lighthouse, operated by Trinity House. The island covers an area of and is home to seagulls, oystercatchers and pipits. Its vegetation is dominated by grasses, with primroses and sea thrift flowering in the spring. Landings may only be made on the island with the permission of Trinity House.

Seaward of Godrevy Island is a submerged reef known as The Stones, which extends for approximately to the northwest across the eastern approach to St Ives Bay. It has been the site of many sinkings over the years but it was not until the disastrous loss of the SS &quot;Nile&quot; on 30 November 1854, with the loss of all aboard, that Trinity House was pressured to construct a lighthouse on the island. It was built in 1859 and was converted to fully automatic operation in 1939.

== Geology ==
The rocks at Godrevy are Devonian mudstones overlain with Quaternary ice age deposits. The mudstone was laid in a deep sea sedimentary basin and subject to seismic activity, forming turbidites. Under gravitational slumping the coarser material settled first followed by the finer material.

Overlying the turbidites are a sequence of rocks laid down during recent ice ages, and Godrevy is considered to be one of the most important Pleistocene (2,588,000 to 11,700 years ago) sites in the south-west of England. Mammal fossils are rare in Cornwall and a dog was found within the poorly sorted, coarse-grained sediments of head dated between 12,000 and 15,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of canine domestication is a dog, or possible a wolf puppy, in a human burial site in Israel from 12,000 years ago. The earliest British domestic dog remains are from Starr Carr, Yorkshire, dated to 9,538 (± 350) BP. In order to date the skeleton and to test three hypotheses, part of a bone was sampled at the Oxford University Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit using accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS).

The three hypotheses were:
* if the skeleton is in context with the geology (i.e. the same age as the head deposits), then the deposits are younger than previously thought,
* if the dating of the head deposits is correct, then the dog is a very early example of domestication,
* if the skeleton is younger, it is not in context with the geology.

The dog skeleton dates to 1650 AD (± 30), which implies that it is possible for a recently dead animal to be within ice age deposits but leave no indication of how it happened. Fossil occurrence within ice age deposits need to be treated with caution, and skeletal remains need to be dated by AMS to provide their actual age and geological significance.

==Religion==
The Godrevy team ministry within the Church of England Diocese of Truro includes five churches in the St Ives district.

<text>WowWee Group Limited is a privately held, Hong Kong–based Canadian consumer technology company.

==History==
Initially from Canada, the two founding brothers (Richard and Peter Yanofsky) moved to Hong Kong to form the company in 1982, as an independent research &amp; development and manufacturing outfit. As an OEM seller, they produced products such as the Power Rangers Power Gloves and the Talking Tots dolls. In 1987, the company changed focus, building and marketing toys under their own brand in response to a fall in OEM orders. In 1999, they produced new products including a robotic dog (MegaByte), T-Rex, and the Animaltronics and Dinotronics lines of remote control animals. In 1998 the company was purchased by Hasbro.

===Under Hasbro===
Shortly before the Hasbro sale, Peter Yanofsky reportedly caught physicist/roboticist Mark Tilden on the Discovery Channel, and soon hired him as a consultant. Initially Tilden worked part-time with WowWee while he continued his work with the Los Alamos National Laboratory, but in 2001, Tilden joined the company full-time. One of his first products with WowWee was the B.I.O. Bug, released in 2001. Unfortunately, while sales were doing well, they weren&#x27;t as strong as either WowWee or Hasbro would have liked. In part this has been attributed to the after-effects of 9/11 and the anthrax attacks, while Tilden has also expressed disappointment with some of the limitations placed on the product design by Hasbro. After moving to WowWee full-time in 2001, Tilden focused his attention on developing Robosapien.

While Tilden was developing Robosapien, Hasbro canceled the project several times, leading Yanofsky to negotiate out of the contract in 2003. Robosapien was released in 2004, and over 1.5 million were reportedly sold in the first five months of sale. Robosapien was the first commercially available biomorphic robot, and the first to integrate personality-like features. Tilden continued to develop the line with the Robosapien V2 (released in 2005), which added functionality like speech capability; RS Media robot (released in 2006), which included user-created functions, and Roboreptile (also in 2006). The Roboquad a four-wheeled robot (released in 2007); the RS Tri-Bot, a three-wheeled robot (released in summer 2008), and RS Media (2006).

In 2007, working with inventor Sean Frawley, WowWee released the FlyTech Dragonflya remote control flying ornithopter. The Dragonfly was named as one of the inventions of the year by Time in 2007. The success of the Dragonfly led to other flying toys, such as the Bladestar (a remote controlled helicopter) and the Butterfly (a wind-up ornithopter aimed at younger children).

===Under Optimal Group===
On September 27, 2007, the publicly traded Optimal Group announced they had entered into a purchase agreement to acquire WowWee Ltd, which they completed in November of that year.

At the 2008 CES, several new products (including the Rovio and Femisapien) were announced with their estimated release dates and prices.

===Private again; Fingerlings &amp; Avastars===
In 2010, the management of WowWee entered into a support agreement with Optimal Group, and took the company private again. In 2014, a new product, MiP, was released. It won more than 10 Tech and Toy awards, including the Toy Industry Associations’ 2015 TOTY award for Innovative Toy of the Year. MiP was also named &quot;Innovative Toy of the Year&quot; at the National Robotics Week. At the 2015 CES, WowWee announced products including MiPosaur and REV.

In 2017, the company employed about 100 people. For the 2017 Christmas season, it introduced, through a series of viral promotions on social media, a product called Fingerlings. The tiny robots, in the shape of monkeys, sloths and unicorns, became one of the most popular toys of the season. Some shoppers complained that they were sold fake Fingerlings on Amazon and Walmart&#x27;s websites. In 2018, WowWee followed up the success with large interactive plush Fingerlings in the Fingerlings Hugs series.

In 2022, WowWee formed a partnership with the Roblox development group Gamefam to launch the Avastars line of dolls.

==2010 lawsuit==
On November 23, 2010, Engadget revealed that WowWee and a number of retailers were being sued for trademark infringement by Gibson Guitar Corporation for unlawfully using the shapes of the bodies and headstocks of Gibson&#x27;s signature guitars in their Paper Jamz line of battery operated toy guitars. WowWee denied any wrongdoing and asserted that the shapes Gibson claimed as trademarks were generic and therefore could not function as trademarks. On November 24, 2010, the court denied Gibson&#x27;s request for a temporary restraining order, but on December 22, 2010, granted Gibson&#x27;s motion for a preliminary injunction. The case was later settled, with WowWee paying Gibson an undisclosed amount for licensing the likeness of Gibson guitars, according to Gibson CEO, Henry Juszkiewicz.

== 2022 lawsuit ==
On August 3, 2022, the video game company Roblox Corporation sued WowWee due to the Avastars line of toys. Roblox claimed that the Avastars&#x27; designs were too similar to that of a classic Roblox avatar.

<doc id="1100881" wikidata="Q7342727" url="?curid=1100881" title="Robert Campeau">
<text>Robert Joseph Antoine Campeau (August 3, 1923 June 12, 2017) was a Canadian financier and real estate developer. Starting from a single house constructed in 1940 in the Alta Vista neighbourhood of Ottawa, Ontario, Campeau built a large land development corporation around the development of the suburb of Kanata. Expansion in the U.S. led Campeau to diversify into the ownership of retail department stores to anchor commercial development projects. The Campeau Corporation used leveraged buyouts to buy the department stores and went bankrupt when it could not maintain the debt payments, in the largest retailing bankruptcy at the time in U.S. history.

==Early years==
Born in Chelmsford, Ontario, Campeau&#x27;s formal education ended in Grade 8, at the age of 14. He worked in jobs at Inco as a general labourer, carpenter and machinist. In 1949, he entered the residential end of the construction business. His first project was a single home constructed in partnership with his cousin in Ottawa, Ontario.

==Real estate development==

In Ottawa, Campeau was able to construct both office complexes and residential subdivisions to accommodate Canada&#x27;s rapidly expanding civil service. Campeau frequently found himself at odds with Ottawa Mayor Charlotte Whitton over planning decisions. Whitton was quoted as saying, &quot;When I look at his (Campeau&#x27;s) houses, I think perhaps nuclear bombardment might not be such a terrible thing after all.&quot; His Campeau Corporation had two main rivals in the residential housing market: Assaly Construction Limited and Minto Developments Inc., the latter owned by the family of future Ottawa Mayor Lorry Greenberg. Despite opposition from Whitton, Campeau developed a reputation as a high-quality builder and became the most successful in the city. A street is named after him in the Ottawa suburb of Kanata, much of which he developed.

For many years, it was city policy that buildings in the downtown core were not to be taller than the &quot;Peace Tower&quot; of the parliament buildings. Campeau objected to this rule and was drawn into conflict with city council over large high-rise developments such as Place de Ville.

Due to his relationships with many civil servants and ministers, he was able to have most of his projects approved. Campeau&#x27;s real estate development success soon spread outside Ottawa. In Toronto his developments included Scotia Tower (the city&#x27;s third tallest skyscraper) and the Harbour Castle Hotel (now part of the Westin Hotels chain).

==Corporate takeovers and bankruptcy==
In the 1980s, Campeau embarked on a series of leveraged buyouts (LBOs). His first attempt at a large takeover was the Royal Trust Company, which was valued at Can$7 billion compared to the $866 million for Campeau Corporation. The bank was later sold and is now part of the Royal Bank of Canada.

As his business expanded, Campeau ventured into the United States, looking for acquisitions that would add shopping mall real estate to his portfolio of assets. Through junk bond LBOs, Campeau Corporation gained control of Allied Stores for US$3.6 billion in 1986 and Federated Department Stores, owner of Bloomingdale&#x27;s, for $6.6 billion in 1988. Campeau retained well-known investment banker Bruce Wasserstein to assist with the transactions. However, the debt obligations that needed to be covered following the merger were too large, and, exacerbated by a market downturn that hurt retail sales, Campeau Corporation was unable to meet its debt obligations.

By June 1989, following Campeau&#x27;s takeover of Federated Department Stores, both Federated and Allied Department Stores were losing money despite increased sales in year-over-year comparisons. Federated and Allied eventually filed for bankruptcy reorganization. The company was eventually acquired by the Reichman brothers, who filed for bankruptcy themselves, and Campeau Corporation ceased to exist.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial stated, &quot;Any corporate executive can figure out how to file for bankruptcy when the bottom drops out of the business. It took the special genius of Robert Campeau, chairman of the Campeau Corporation, to figure out how to bankrupt more than 250 profitable department stores. The dramatic jolt to Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Abraham &amp; Straus, Jordan Marsh, and the other proud stores reflects his overreaching grasp and oversized ego.&quot;

==Personal life==

Campeau resided in a lakeside castle in Austria and he became involved in some real estate projects including developing a large subdivision in Teltow (former GDR) near Berlin, Germany. That project failed, and Campeau&#x27;s company went bankrupt in 2001. The funds of the charitable foundation (Robert Campeau Family Foundation) used in his business were lost.
Campeau died on June 12, 2017, in Ottawa.

<doc id="1100882" wikidata="Q638655" url="?curid=1100882" title="Traidenis">
<text>Traidenis (; ; died 1282) was Grand Duke of Lithuania from 1269 or 1270 until 1282. He is the second most prominent grand duke of Lithuania in the 13th century after Mindaugas. His reign ended a seven-year unrest period after Mindaugas was assassinated in 1263 and firmly established the Grand Duchy as a pagan state for another hundred years.

Traidenis expanded the Grand Duchy into the territories of Sudovians and Semigalians and strengthened its presence in Black Ruthenia. Unlike Mindaugas, Traidenis did not concentrate on expansion into the east.

==Biography==
The circumstances surrounding Traidenis&#x27; advance to power are not clear. While his ancestors are unknown, it is known that he came from Aukštaitija, as he was Duke of Kernavė. From the outset his relationships with Galicia–Volhynia were tense as he replaced Shvarn, Duke of Galicia–Volhynia and Lithuania. The tension eventually resulted in the 1274–1276 war. Despite Mongol support to Galicia–Volhynia, Traidenis was successful in battle and his control over Black Ruthenia (Novogrudok, Grodno, Slonim, and other cities) was strengthened. Traidenis also made incursions into Poland, especially surroundings of Lublin and Łęczyca, that continued to about 1306. However, these raids did not affect Masovia as Traidenis established a dynastic link through his daughter Gaudemunda with its dukes. This dynastic relationship was further developed by Gediminas.

Traidenis, known for his devotion to paganism and anti-German attitude, was also successful in fighting with the Livonian Order. In 1270 he won the Battle of Karuse, fought on ice near Saaremaa, and killed Otto von Lutterberg, master of the Order. A new master, Andreas von Westfalen, sought a quick revenge, but was also killed by Traidenis. However, by 1272 the Order retaliated, attacking Semigalia and building Dinaburg Castle in 1273 on lands nominally controlled by Traidenis. Despite four siege engines used to throw stones, he was unable to capture the new fortress and had to retreat in 1278. In 1279 the order attacked Lithuanian lands, reaching as far as Kernavė, but on their way back they suffered a great defeat in the Battle of Aizkraukle. The Order&#x27;s master, Ernst von Rassburg, became the third master to be killed by Traidenis. The defeat encouraged conquered Semigallians to rebel. The Semigalians, led by Nameisis, were now willing to acknowledge Lithuania&#x27;s superiority and asked Traidenis for assistance. In 1281, Traidenis conquered Jersika Castle in the present-day Preiļi District, and was able to exchange it for Dinaburg Castle. However, Traidenis died soon afterwards, and assistance to Semigalians, exhausted by constant warfare, diminished. Traidenis is the first known Lithuanian duke to have died a natural death. All others before him were assassinated or killed in battle.

<text>Bryce, also often referred to colloquially as Bryce3D, is a 3D modeling, rendering and animation program specializing in fractal landscapes. The name is taken from Bryce Canyon—a rugged region with many of the same landscapes that were first simulated with the software.

== History ==
The original Bryce software arose from work with fractal geometry to create realistic computer images of mountain ranges and coastlines. An initial set of fractal based programs were developed by Ken Musgrave (who later created MojoWorld) a student of Benoît Mandelbrot, and extended by Eric Wenger. Wenger later met and worked with software artist Kai Krause to design a basic user interface. The first commercial version, Bryce 1.0, appeared in 1994 for the Macintosh.

Bryce 2.0, shipped in 1996, included much beyond the original notion of creating a realistic mountain range. These included independent light sources, complex atmospheric effects, the addition of primitive forms with Boolean methods to combine them, a revamped Texture Editor and the ability to export models to DXF. Bryce 2.0 was also ported to the Windows platform, although the first stable version, 2.1, was not released until 1997.

The ability to animate a scene was added (in a stable form) with the cross-platform Bryce 3D (version 3.1) in 1997 by the newly formed MetaCreations Corporation. A &quot;camera object&quot; unseen in the final image acted as the observer. The camera can be held in one place for a single image, or sent on a trajectory with images being rendered at many locations. The collection of images created along the camera&#x27;s trajectory are combined to create a realistic animation simulating a journey through a dynamic world.

In 1999 Bryce 4.0 was released with major improvements in the handling of atmospheres and skies, textures and also in the import/export of objects.

In 2000 Bryce was purchased by Corel Corporation. Corel released version 5 of Bryce in 2001, which included several new features, like Tree Lab and metaballs. Unfortunately, rendering on version 5 was much slower than version 4, and the price tag set by Corel higher. Soon followed a patch to version 5.01, which fixed some bugs and added a few undocumented features.

In 2004, the software was sold again, to Daz 3D. In 2005, Daz 3D released Bryce 5.5 which included the Daz Studio Character plugin. This integration between DAZ&#x27;s application for the manipulation of 3D models, Daz Studio, and Bryce allowed users to import content from Daz Studio and Poser, complete with all materials including transparencies, directly into Bryce, thus making it easier to have human figures in Bryce scenes.

In October 2006, Daz 3D released Bryce 6.0 and has released an update (6.1), this includes a Mac Intel compatible update. New features include animation import, support for dual-processor systems as well as hyper-threading, random replicate tool, advanced terrain editing, HDRI support and other tweaks. The interface remained largely the same, but with a green tint to it, and different buttons in the create palette.

In June 2007, Daz 3D re-released Bryce 5.5 as a freeware.

In Summer 2009, Daz 3D released version 3 of Daz Studio. This version seemed to break Bryce 6.1.

In December 2009, Daz 3D released Bryce 6.3 which improved stability, and added support for Mac OS X v10.6.

Bryce 7 was released in July 2010. New features include the Instancing Lab and advanced lighting. Updated features include the Daz Studio Bridge, the Sky Lab, clouds and HDRI. Bryce 7 is available in three versions, a limited free version, a standard version lacking the new features and a pro version with the new features. Bryce 7 is not currently compatible with OS X Lion (10.7), Mountain Lion (10.8), or Mavericks (10.9) (except for Bryce 7 Personal Limited Edition 7.1.0.74), thus the newest version of OS X it is compatible with is Snow Leopard (10.6).

As late as October 2018, Bryce 7 development has been halted, including when it comes to addressing macOS compatibility.

==Early life==
Point was born in Louhans, Saône-et-Loire, France. His family kept an inn where he started cooking when he was ten. He moved to Paris and worked at some of its best restaurants before working with Paul Bocuse&#x27;s father at the in Évian-les-Bains.

==Career==
He had received his training with Foyot in Paris, the Bristol Hotel, Paris, the Majestic in Cannes, and the Royal Hotel in Évian-les-Bains. In 1922, he and his family moved to Vienne, a city in southeast France near Lyon, and opened a restaurant. Two years later his father left the restaurant to Fernand, who renamed it La Pyramide.

Point opened Restaurant de la Pyramide when he was 24, about south of Lyon in the town of Vienne. The restaurant was awarded three Michelin stars.

==Ma Gastronomie==
His book &quot;Ma Gastronomie&quot; was first published in French in 1969. The book includes 200 recipes based on Point&#x27;s notes. The chef Charlie Trotter described Point&#x27;s &quot;Ma Gastronomie&quot; as the most important cookbook.

<doc id="1100905" wikidata="Q546815" url="?curid=1100905" title="Anil Biswas (politician)">
<text>Anil Biswas (2 March 1944 – 26 March 2006), often referred to as Keru, was an Indian communist politician. He was the secretary of the West Bengal State Committee of Communist Party of India (Marxist) and member of the party&#x27;s politburo beginning in 1998 until his death in 2006.

== Early life ==
Biswas born in a middle class Mahishya family of &quot;Darermath&quot; village near Karimpur, Nadia district. While in high school he was attracted to the Left movement in the area. in 1961 he joined the Krishnagar Government College and came under the influence of Marxist leaders like Harinarayan Adhikari and Dinesh Mazumdar and also became an active member of the Students&#x27; Federation of India. He was a student leader in College elections. After taking an Honours degree in political science, he shifted to Kolkata to pursue his academic career.

== Politics ==
He became the full-fledged party member of the CPI(M) in 1965. In the same year he was arrested under the Defence of India Rules 1962 and was imprisoned for 11 months. From jail custody he completed the master&#x27;s degree in political science. In 1969, he became a whole timer of the party and began his party work as a journalist in the Ganashakti, the party&#x27;s daily organ.

Biswas was elected to the CPIM West Bengal state committee in 1978 and elected to the state secretariat in 1982. Biswas remained closely associated with Ganashakti and edited it between 1983-1998. It was during his editorship the newspaper reached the height of circulation. Biswas became member of the Central Committee of the party in the year of 1985. &quot;It was due to his guidance that the Ganashakthi became a full-fledged and comprehensive newspaper,&quot; CPIM said in homage to Biswas.

In 1998, he became a member of the Polit Bureau. He was mentored by Pramod Dasgupta. 

In 1998, took charge as the secretary of the State committee after his predecessor Sailen Dasgupta resigned owing to ill-health and old age. He was reelected as state secretary in 2002 and 2005. 

He was the editor of &quot;Marxbadi Path&quot; (The Road of the Marxist), the theoretical quarterly in West Bengal.

He was known to be a deft strategist and the brain behind the party&#x27;s important decisions in West Bengal politics. In one of his genius decisions, he influenced the party to name Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee as Chief Minister of West Bengal replacing Jyoti Basu before the 2000 West Bengal Legislative Assembly Elections. This was a strategically shrewd decision because people of West Bengal were frustrated by the same Chief Minister for more than 20 years. It got the Left front a huge victory in spite of strong opposition from Mamata Banerjee&#x27;s TMC. Because of Anil Biswas&#x27; organized election tactics as the State General Secretary in the 2006 West Bengal Assembly Election, the opposition reduced to significantly small number of seats. He used to manage the media and the ground-workers so well that he knew the pulse of the general public in and out. It is largely believed that the demise of Anil Biswas and other important ground-leaders such as Subhas Chakraborty paved the way for the opposition to come into power replacing the Left Front.

== Death ==
He died on 26 March 2006 after being hospitalised by a brain haemorrhage on 18 March. His body was donated to NRS Medical College and Hospital according to his last wishes. He is survived by his wife Gita and daughter Ajanta.

<text>Joseph Lawrence Alioto (February 12, 1916 – January 29, 1998) was an American politician who served as the 36th mayor of San Francisco, California, from 1968 to 1976.

==Biography==
Alioto was born in San Francisco in 1916. His father, Giuseppe Alioto, was a Sicilian immigrant who owned and operated several fish processing companies. His mother, Domenica Mae Lazio, was born in San Francisco. His parents met on a fishing boat while escaping the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

===Education===
He attended Sacred Heart High School (presently Sacred Heart Cathedral Preparatory). He graduated with honors from St. Mary&#x27;s College, Moraga, California, in 1937 and from law school at The Catholic University of America with honors in 1940.

===Law practice===
Alioto worked for the Antitrust Division of the Justice Department and then for the Board of Economic Warfare. He returned to San Francisco after World War II and started an antitrust practice, representing Walt Disney and Samuel Goldwyn, among others, eventually becoming a millionaire. He was on the briefs in &quot;Radovich v. National Football League&quot; and argued &quot;Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide &amp; Carbon Corp.&quot;, 370 U.S. 690 (1962), an antitrust landmark, and &quot;Utah Pie Co. v. Continental Baking Co.&quot;, 386 U.S. 685 (1967), all three Supreme Court of the United States cases. In Radovich, the Supreme Court held that professional football, unlike baseball, was subject to antitrust laws. Continental Ore is one of the most comprehensive and important antitrust cases ever decided by the Supreme Court.

In 1980, he represented Al Davis and the Oakland Raiders in a landmark antitrust case entitled &quot;Los Angeles Coliseum Commission v. The NFL&quot;. The case established the right of football franchises to move to football markets throughout the United States without the approval of other franchise owners. In 1993, he represented his father-in-law Billy Sullivan in his lawsuit against the NFL. The court ruled that Sullivan was forced by the league to sell his team at below market value and awarded him $114 million.

===Early government career===
Alioto served on the San Francisco Board of Education from 1948 to 1954; and in 1955, he served as the first Chairman of the San Francisco Redevelopment Agency.

==Mayoralty==
Alioto signed on as campaign finance chairman for the mayoral candidacy of California State Senator J. Eugene McAteer in the 1967 San Francisco mayoral election. When McAteer collapsed and died while playing a game of handball, Alioto entered the race. John Shelley, the incumbent, bowed out, allegedly because of poor health but probably because Alioto was more pro-development than Shelley; additionally, Shelley was expected to lose a re-match against his 1963 opponent, Republican Harold Dobbs. Alioto defeated Dobbs, 44.2%-37.8%, in an 18-candidate field. He would be reelected in 1971.

Alioto delivered the speech nominating Hubert Humphrey at the 1968 Democratic National Convention. There were rumors that Humphrey would select Alioto as his running mate, but Humphrey selected Edmund Muskie. An article in the September 23, 1969, issue of &quot;Look&quot; magazine claimed that Alioto had business and personal ties to the Los Angeles Mafioso boss Jimmy Fratianno. Alioto later sued &quot;Look&quot; for libel and won a $450,000 judgment. In the course of the litigation, Alioto proved that &quot;Look&quot;, desperate and on the verge of bankruptcy, simply conjured up (with no proof) an alleged mob meeting in Vacaville, California, at the Nut Tree Restaurant. He later claimed that he had documents that showed that the Nixon administration leaked disinformation to the magazine in order to stall his career.

In January 1970, the State of Washington, three cities, a port authority, and eight public utilities brought a civil suit against Alioto because he split a $2.3 million fee in an antitrust case with Washington State Attorney General John J. O&#x27;Connell and an O’Connell deputy, George Faler. Attorney General O’Connell had maintained Public Utility Districts as private clients during his time as AG. The Public Utility Districts were suing electrical manufactures that were fixing prices at an improperly high level. The case began in 1962 and O’Connell retained Alioto, a very successful anti-trust attorney, to work on the case. Originally, Alioto agreed to receive 15% of what was awarded with a $1 million cap. Later, O’Connell, apparently without telling his clients, abolished the fee ceiling. Alioto ended up receiving approximately $2.3 million and gave $802,815 of those fees to O’Connell and Faler. The state and other groups sued to have the entire $2.3 million returned; Alioto successfully sought a change of venue from Washington to San Francisco. The trial took six months and jury unanimously found the three were entitled to the $2.3 million.

Alioto was also indicted by a federal grand jury in March 1971 on bribery charges because of the means by which the fees were awarded. When the case went to court, Alioto was cleared of the federal charges by a judge who ordered acquittal because he was convinced a jury would not convict when it considered the evidence.

Under California law it was illegal for public employees to strike. Nevertheless, city employees called a strike in March 1974, picketing City Hall and shutting down municipal services. After a week Mayor Alioto and the San Francisco Board of Supervisors agreed to the strikers&#x27; demands. The city controller, however, refused to pay out what he believed were illegal salaries. In April 1975 the California Supreme Court ordered the city controller to pay the salaries, with Justice Mathew Tobriner finding that contracts secured through illegal strikes are still legally enforceable.

Major crime became a problem with the Zodiac Killer, the Symbionese Liberation Army attacks and the Black Power Zebra Murders all occurring during Alioto&#x27;s mayoralty.

During the Zebra Murders in 1974, Alioto&#x27;s wife, Angelina Alioto, vanished, reappearing after 18 days to claim that she had taken off to &quot;punish&quot; her husband for neglect. During the time Angelina was missing, she toured the missions of California as part of a religious pilgrimage. Angelina filed divorce proceedings against him in 1975. He remarried in 1978.

Alioto ran in the 1974 Democratic primary for governor, finishing second behind Jerry Brown.

In July 1975 the LAPD unexpectedly announced a pay raise. For years the San Francisco Police Department had been the top paid in the state, with the San Francisco Fire Department guaranteed the same pay. The SF police promptly demanded they be paid more than the LAPD. The Board of Supervisors, however, determined that the pay raise would drive the city into deficit, and unanimously approved a raise only half of what the police requested.

California law still prohibited public employees from striking. The police and firefighters elected to strike anyway, with 90% illegally abandoning their posts.

The city then obtained a court order declaring the strike illegal and enjoining the officers to return to work. The court messenger delivering the order was met with violence and the police continued to strike.

Only managers and African-American officers remained, with 45 officers and 3 fire trucks responsible for the whole city. Supervisor Dianne Feinstein pleaded for Mayor Alioto to ask Governor Jerry Brown to call out the National Guard to patrol the streets but Alioto refused.

When enraged citizens confronted police at the picket lines the police arrested them. Federal authorities were forced to intervene after striking firefighters attempted to seize San Francisco International Airport. Heavy drinking on the picket line became common and after striking police officers started shooting out streetlights the ACLU obtained a court order prohibiting strikers from carrying their service revolvers. Again, the police ignored the court order.

On August 20 a bomb detonated at the Mayor&#x27;s home with a sign reading &quot;Don’t Threaten Us&quot; left on his lawn. On August 21 Mayor Alioto advised the Supervisors that they should concede to the strikers&#x27; demands. The Supervisors unanimously refused. Mayor Alioto then immediately declared a state of emergency, assumed &quot;legislative powers&quot;, and granted the strikers’ demands.

The Supervisors and taxpayers sued but the court reaffirmed that contracts obtained through illegal strikes are still legally enforceable. Nevertheless, the Supervisors placed on the November ballot charter initiatives revoking the mayor&#x27;s emergency powers, requiring police to be automatically fired if they strike, preventing firemen from holding second jobs, and requiring future pay raises to be averaged with California&#x27;s other large cities. All the ballot initiatives passed by extremely large margins.

In 1974 and 1975, Alioto served as president of the United States Conference of Mayors.

==Later life==
After he left office, Alioto went back into private practice. He and his son Joseph Jr. lost a major malpractice case against a cattle rancher in 1980. He received millions in legal fees after counseling the Oakland Raiders win against the City of Oakland. In 1991, he and his son went to battle in court against each other over legal fees in the Raiders case.

===Death===
Alioto died of prostate cancer in San Francisco on January 29, 1998, and was interred at Cypress Lawn Cemetery in Colma, California. A cenotaph is located at Holy Cross Cemetery (Section D).

==Legacy==

Alioto presided over a time of turmoil and change in San Francisco. 
Events that occurred during his tenure as mayor included strife in the Haight-Ashbury with the drug culture, anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, the start of the gay Castro District, Black Panther marches, the Zebra murders and Zodiac killings. He ran on a platform of reducing taxes and fighting crime.

Alioto put his energy behind the development of three major building projects: the Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) system; the Transamerica Pyramid; and the Embarcadero Center. These efforts engendered opposition in the development stage but were eventually built, transforming the quality of life and skyline of San Francisco.

Alioto helped to bring more minorities into city politics, launched a reform of the city charter, and mediated protracted police and fire department strikes in 1975. Alioto&#x27;s tenure began with a citywide newspaper strike of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; in February 1968. The first faculty strike at a college or university in the United States was at San Francisco State College, now San Francisco State University, during 1968–1969; Alioto gave the law enforcement resources of the City and County of San Francisco to the university president, S.I. Hayakawa.

The Joseph L. Alioto Recreation Center at his alma mater, Saint Mary&#x27;s College in Moraga, California, opened in 2015 and is named after him. The privately funded facility cost $23.5 million, and includes an outdoor aquatics center, indoor exercise equipment, a rock climbing wall, and a cafe. The center serves the general student body, while varsity athletes use separate dedicated training facilities.
After his death, the Civic Center Plaza in San Francisco was dedicated as the &quot;Joseph L. Alioto Performing Arts Piazza&quot; on October 28, 1998. Additionally, there is a mini park and community garden named for him in the Mission District of San Francisco.

==Alioto family==
Alioto had five sons and a daughter with his first wife Angelina Genaro, and a son and daughter with his second wife Kathleen Sullivan.

Members of Alioto&#x27;s family are still involved in San Francisco politics. His second wife, Kathleen Sullivan Alioto, was a member of the Boston School committee and a candidate for a United States Senate seat in Massachusetts in the 1978 primary. Sullivan and Alioto married in 1978 and remained together until his death in 1998. Because they were both divorced, the wedding was performed by excommunicated Catholic priest and activist Joseph O&#x27;Rourke.

Angela Alioto, the daughter from his first marriage, served eight years as a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, two as its president. One of Angela&#x27;s three sons, Joe Alioto Veronese, campaigned for a California State Senate seat in 2008. One of his granddaughters, Michela Alioto-Pier, was appointed to the Board of Supervisors in 2003 by San Francisco mayor Gavin Newsom and won election to the Board in 2004. His grandson Joseph Alioto Jr. ran an unsuccessful bid for a seat on the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in District 3. Several of his sons, as well as many of his grandchildren, are successful attorneys and businesspersons in the San Francisco Bay Area.

<text>Lynx (stylized as LYNX) is a transit system serving the greater Orlando, Florida area. Operated by the Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority, it provides bus, curb-to-curb, and paratransit services in three counties: Orange, Seminole, and Osceola. Bus routes are referred to as Links.

LYNX does not operate SunRail, the region&#x27;s commuter rail service, but it does provide bus connections to SunRail stations within its service area. 

In , the system had a ridership of , or about per weekday as of .

==History==
Bus service in Orlando was originally provided by the Orlando Transit Company, a private operator. When the company halted service in 1972 due to financial troubles, three local counties organized the Orange-Seminole-Osceola Transportation Authority (OSOTA) to operate bus services in its place. The agency&#x27;s bus service was originally named Tri-County Transit (TCT).

Despite the name, Tri-County Transit only operated in Orange County and Seminole County; bus routes for Osceola County were planned but not funded. Service to Osceola County was not introduced until January 1993 with an eight-month trial route.

In 1992, OSOTA held a public contest to choose a new name for Tri-County Transit. The winning name, LYNX, was chosen from 12,000 entries. The following year, OSOTA was merged with the Central Florida Commuter Rail Authority (which was organized to construct a commuter rail system along Interstate 4) and was renamed to the Central Florida Regional Transportation Authority.

In November 2004, LYNX opened LYNX Central Station, the bus system&#x27;s primary transit hub. The station became an intermodal station in 2014 with the opening of SunRail.

==Services==

=== LYNX Bus ===
LYNX operates 68 bus routes throughout its three-county service area. The bus system connects to LakeXpress (servicing Lake County) in Four Corners, Winter Garden, and Zellwood, and it also connects to Citrus Connection (servicing Polk County) in Four Corners and Poinciana. All SunRail stations within the service area have bus connections, though transfers are irregularly timed.

LYNX directly services Disney Springs and the Transportation and Ticket Center of Walt Disney World, as well as some employee areas. All other transportation in WDW is provided by Disney&#x27;s own bus system. A similar system is used at Universal Orlando; LYNX connects to Universal CityWalk (and, by extension, the original two parks), while Universal&#x27;s resorts are connected via trails, water taxis, and a resort-operated bus.

Bus frequency varies by route, ranging from every fifteen minutes to every hour. On official maps, routes with frequencies of thirty minutes or better are colored purple, while less-frequent routes are colored orange. All routes are available Monday through Friday; weekend and holiday service varies by route.

Three routes (407, 418, and 441), branded as FastLink, use a limited-stop route pattern to provide faster trips. These routes only operate weekdays from 6 AM to 6 PM.

All LYNX buses, with the exception of those used on the LYMMO system, have front-mounted bike racks which can be used at no extra charge.

Bus stop signs were originally designated with a lynx paw in place of a traditional bus icon, with Links servicing the stop listed below. Following a rebranding initiative, this was replaced with a bus icon that incorporates the lynx paw.

==== LYMMO (Bus Rapid Transit) ====
LYMMO is a free bus rapid transit system in Downtown Orlando, which utilizes bus lanes and priority signals to improve speed and reliability. The service connects downtown destinations, such as Lake Eola Park and Kia Center, to parking and LYNX Central Station. The service was first launched in 1997 and claims to be the oldest BRT system in the United States.

The system consists of three circulator routes, each named after citrus fruits: the Orange Line (officially Link 60), the Lime Line (Link 61), and the Grapefruit Line (Link 62). The routes operate daily with headways of 8-15 minutes at peak and 15-20 minutes off-peak. 

Starting on August 20, 2023, during off-peak hours (10 AM-2 PM and 6:30 PM-10:30 PM), a portion of the Orange Line in the Creative Village neighborhood is instead serviced by SWAN, an autonomous shuttle.

=== NeighborLink ===
NeighborLink (formerly PickUpLine) is an on-demand service that allows riders to schedule curb-to-curb trips within 11 specified zones. Trips can be scheduled online, by phone, or through an app. Trips must be scheduled at least two hours in advance.

=== Access LYNX ===
Access LYNX is a paratransit service which provides ADA-compliant service to patrons incapable of using the bus system, as well as non-ADA service to users without reliable transportation due to disability, age, or income. Since June 2023, Access LYNX has been operated by Transdev.

=== Vanpool ===
LYNX operates a vanpool program for riders in its service area, which allows groups of six to fifteen people to rent a vehicle for a monthly fee. The cost covers registration and service, but it does not cover fuel or tolls.

=== Road Rangers ===
In partnership with the Florida Department of Transportation, LYNX operates Road Rangers, a roadside assistance program for drivers on Interstate 4. Road Rangers provides minor vehicle repairs, towing, and communication with first responders to drivers.

Road Rangers services two stretches of I-4, totaling 48 miles. The eastern stretch lasts from Exit 132 (Interstate 95) to Exit 98 (Lake Mary Boulevard). The western stretch lasts from Exit 72 (Florida State Road 528) to Exit 58 (Osceola County Road 532).

== Facilities ==
LYNX&#x27;s administrative offices are located at LYNX Central Station.

LYNX has two operations centers for the maintenance and storage of its bus fleet. Most bus routes (85%) are serviced by the LYNX Operations Center (LOC), located in Orlando off John Young Parkway. Osceola Satellite Facility (OSF), located in Kissimmee, services most Osceola County routes.

In 2022, LYNX began considering sites for a third operations center. The $80 million facility will be located in Osceola County and will support up to 250 vehicles.

==Fares==
A standard adult one-way fare is $2, which includes a free transfer within 90 minutes of activation. (The transfer cannot be used on the same Link, e.g. for round trips.) Payment can be made in cash or via the PawPass app. An All-Day Pass, which lasts until 3 AM the following morning, is available for $4.50 upon request.

LYNX offers a rolling 7-Day Pass for $16 and a rolling 30-Day pass for $50. These passes may be purchased at LYNX Central Station, online, via the PawPass app, or at Orlando-area retailers. Up to three riders under 7 can board for free with fare-paying rider; additional children (or children without adults) require a $1 fare.

Discounted fare IDs are available to youth (age 7 - 18 and/or currently in high school), seniors (age 65+), Medicare card holders, and disabled people. Patrons with a discounted fare ID can buy passes for half price.

<doc id="1100910" wikidata="Q1416504" url="?curid=1100910" title="Pacific Solution">
<text>The Pacific Solution is the name given to the government of Australia&#x27;s policy of transporting asylum seekers to detention centres on island nations in the Pacific Ocean, rather than allowing them to land on the Australian mainland. Initially implemented from 2001 to 2007, it had bipartisan support from the Coalition and Labor opposition at the time. The Pacific Solution consisted of three central strategies:
*Thousands of islands were excised from the Australian migration zone and Australian territory; 
*The Australian Defence Force commenced Operation Relex to intercept vessels carrying asylum seekers (SIEVs);
*The asylum seekers were removed to detention centres in Nauru and on Manus Island, Papua New Guinea, while their refugee status was determined. 
A number of pieces of legislation enabled this policy. The policy was developed by the Howard government in response to the Tampa affair in August 2001 and the Children Overboard affair, and was implemented by Immigration Minister Philip Ruddock on 28 September before the 2001 federal election of 24 November.

The policy was largely dismantled in 2008 by the first Rudd government following the election of the Labor Party; Chris Evans, the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship described it as &quot;a cynical, costly and ultimately unsuccessful exercise&quot;.

In August 2012, the succeeding Gillard government (Labor) introduced a similar policy, reopening the Nauru and Manus detention centres for offshore processing.

On 19 July 2013, newly returned Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, during his short-lived second term of office, announced that &quot;asylum seekers who come here by boat without a visa will never be settled in Australia&quot;, striking a Regional Resettlement Arrangement between Australia and Papua New Guinea, colloquially known as the PNG Solution, to divert all &quot;unauthorised maritime arrivals&quot; to mandatory detention on Manus Island with no possibility of attaining Australian residency.

The Operation Sovereign Borders policy took over from the Pacific Solution after the 2013 federal election, won by the Coalition. It commenced on 18 September 2013 under the new Abbott government. On 31 March 2019, Operation Sovereign Borders reported that there were no people held in the detention centre on Nauru, which had been closed, and that the Manus centre had been officially closed on 31 October 2017. However, on 30 September 2019 the total number of asylum seekers still in PNG and Nauru was 562 (separate numbers were not published), being housed in alternative accommodation.

==Implementation (2001–2007)==

The Australian Government passed legislation on 27 September 2001, with amendments to the Commonwealth &quot;Migration Act 1958&quot;, enacted by the &quot;Migration Legislation Amendment (Excision from the Migration Zone) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2001&quot;. Specifically, the new amendment to the 1958 Act allowed &quot;offshore entry persons&quot; to be taken to &quot;declared countries&quot;, with Nauru and Papua New Guinea made &quot;declared countries&quot; under the Act. The implementation of this legislation became known as the Pacific Solution at the same time as or soon after the passing of the legislation (at least within a year).

By redefining the area of Australian territory that could be landed upon and then legitimately used for claims of asylum (the migration zone), and by removing any intercepted people to third countries for processing, the aim was to deter future asylum seekers from making the dangerous journey by boat, once they knew that their trip would probably not end with a legitimate claim for asylum in Australia.

On 28 October 2001, at his 2001 election campaign policy launch, Prime Minister John Howard said &quot;we will decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come&quot;, in an effort to build support for the policy.

Asylum seekers were intercepted at sea while sailing from Indonesia and moved using Australian naval vessels. Detention centres were set up on Christmas Island, Manus Island in Papua New Guinea, and on the island nation of Nauru. Some were also accepted for processing by New Zealand. Most of the asylum seekers came from Afghanistan (largely of the Hazara ethnic group), Iraq, Iran, China, and Vietnam. The last asylum seekers to be detained on Nauru before the end of the policy had come from Sri Lanka and Myanmar.

Arrivals dropped from a total of 5516 people in 2001 to one arrival in 2002 after implementation of the policy, and remained below 150 annually until 2008. The removal of the Taliban from power in Afghanistan may have had some effect in this decrease, as nearly six million Afghans had returned to Afghanistan since 2002, almost a quarter of the country&#x27;s population at the time.

Four boats were successfully returned to Indonesian waters out of the twelve Suspected Illegal Entry Vessels (SIEVs) intercepted by the Navy during Operation Relex during 2001–2002, having made 10 attempts to enforce the policy, based on judgements of whether it was safe to do so or not. Three men allegedly drowned trying to swim back to shore after returning to Indonesia.

In November 2003, a boat carrying 53 passengers was successfully deterred, and in March 2004, Customs returned a boat with 15 people after interception at the Ashmore Islands.

The success rate was 36 per cent of boats, or 31 per cent of asylum seekers sent back to Indonesia. Details of operations from 2005 to 2008 are scant. Operation Resolute began in July 2006, run jointly by the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service and the Australian Defence Force.

During the Pacific Solution period, mainland detention centres were closed at Baxter, Woomera and Curtin. A lower level of boat arrivals continued throughout the Pacific Solution period, although it was reported to have peaked in 2012, since the abolition of the policy, despite worldwide asylum claim numbers remaining low by historical standards. These arrivals also corresponded with increasing numbers of new refugee arrivals in Indonesia after the abandonment of the policy: 385 in 2008, 3,230 in 2009, 3,905 in 2010, 4,052 in 2011, 7,218 in 2012 and 8,332 in 2013. A probable link between restrictive refugee policies and lower attempts at seeking asylum in Australia by boat have been confirmed by the UNHCR: in April 2014, UNHCR Indonesia representative Manual Jordao stated: &quot;Word that the prospects of reaching Australia by boat from Indonesia are now virtually zero appears to have reached smugglers and would-be asylum seekers in countries of origin such as Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan and Myanmar. The numbers registering with the UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR) in Indonesia have dropped from about 100 a day during 2013 to about 100 a week now.&quot;

The number of asylum seekers assessed as genuine refugees via the Pacific Solution process was lower than for onshore processing. 68 per cent of the asylum seekers were deemed genuine refugees and less than 40 per cent of asylum seekers sent to Nauru received resettlement in Australia. A 2006 report by the Australian Human Rights Commission showed that of the 1509 asylum seekers sent to Nauru by that time, 586 were granted Australian resettlement (39%), 360 resettled in New Zealand (24%), 19 resettled in Sweden (1.2%), 10 in Canada (&lt;1%) and 4 in Norway (&lt;1%). A total of 482 asylum seekers (32%) were deemed not genuine refugees and sent home.

The cost of the Pacific Solution between 2001 and 2007 was at least .

Amnesty International, refugee rights groups and other non-governmental organisations said that Australia was failing to meet its international obligations. The ad hoc nature in which the policy evolved was also criticised, as it resulted in people being moved to Manus Island and Nauru before facilities were ready. Poor facilities and services including intermittent electricity and fresh water, poor medical facilities and the serious mental impact of detention on people in these conditions without the certainty of being granted refugee status were also strongly criticised.

==Suspension==
During the campaign for the 2007 parliamentary election, Australian Labor Party leader Kevin Rudd promised to continue the Howard government&#x27;s policies of turning boats back to Indonesia and the issue of temporary protection visas. Upon Kevin Rudd&#x27;s 2007 election win, the Pacific Solution was abandoned, with the Nauru processing centre closed down in February 2008, a move welcomed by the UN Refugee Agency. The last detainees left Manus Island in 2004 and Nauru in February 2008. 

The Republic of Nauru was concerned about losing much-needed aid from Australia. Opposition immigration spokesman Chris Ellison said the closure could suggest to people-smugglers that Australia was weakening on border protection.

==Re-implementation (post-2007)==

The Australian Government opened the Christmas Island Immigration Reception and Processing Centre in late 2008, and has since expanded facilities and accommodation there. In the 2012–2013 financial year the Government of Australia budgeted $1.1 billion to cover the processing costs for 450 arrivals per month.

From 2007 to 2010, the number of asylum seeker arrivals by boat increased substantially—from 148 in 2007 to 6555 in 2010. This contributed to Rudd&#x27;s ailing popularity through to 2010, when he resigned prior to a leadership spill of the Australian Labor Party to Julia Gillard; at this time Rudd said &quot;This party and government will not be lurching to the right on the question of asylum seekers&quot;.

In July 2010, Gillard showed support for the utilisation of &quot;regional processing centres&quot;. In December 2010, in the aftermath of an asylum seeker boat sinking at Christmas Island in which 48 occupants perished, Queensland Premier and ALP national president Anna Bligh called for a complete review of the government&#x27;s policy on asylum seekers. In May 2011, the Gillard government announced plans to address the issue of asylum seekers arriving by boat with an asylum seeker &#x27;swap&#x27; deal for long-standing genuine refugees in Malaysia. Refugee lawyers asked the High Court to strike down the deal, arguing that the Immigration Minister did not have the power to send asylum seekers to a country that has no legal obligations to protect them.

There were calls on the Australian Government to reinstate the Pacific Solution by reopening the detention centres on Nauru. Several of these came from former outspoken critics of the policy. Refugee lawyer Marion Le, who had demanded the facility be shut down in 2005, said that it was &quot;time for Labor to bite the bullet and reopen Nauru&quot;, while human rights lawyer Julian Burnside disagreed, but conceded that &quot;Nauru [was] certainly the less worse, but both are unacceptable.&quot; This echoed the sentiment of Independent MP Andrew Wilkie who several days previously, while stopping short of calling for a return to the previous arrangement, noted that &quot;John Howard&#x27;s Pacific Solution was better.&quot; The Malaysian people swap deal was deemed unlawful by the High Court.

During the 2010 Australian federal election campaign Liberal Leader Tony Abbott said he would meet with the President of Nauru, Marcus Stephen, to demonstrate the Coalition&#x27;s resolve to reinstate the Pacific Solution policy, should he become prime minister. Prime Minister Julia Gillard announced 6 July 2010 that talks were under way to set up a regional processing centre for asylum seekers in East Timor.

In August 2012, a government-appointed expert panel (Houston Report) recommended a number of changes to the current policy including the reintroduction of the Pacific Solution after an increase in boat people and deaths at sea. It handed down 22 recommendations, including the immediate reopening of immigration detention facilities on Manus Island and Nauru, which the government implemented with bipartisan support. This was expected to cost $2 billion over four years for Nauru and $900 million for Papua New Guinea.

The bill to do so was passed on 16 August 2012. Asylum seekers who arrive by boat to Australia are now to be transferred to remote Pacific islands indefinitely while their claims to refugee status are being processed. Amnesty International described the conditions of the Nauru detention facility as &quot;appalling&quot; at this time. 

The Government announced on 21 November 2012 that it was recommencing onshore processing with bridging visas.
On 21 November 2012 Immigration Minister Chris Bowen announced the reopening the Pontville Detention Centre in Tasmania. On 19 July 2013 in a joint press conference with PNG Prime Minister Peter O&#x27;Neill and Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd detailed the Regional Resettlement Arrangement between Australia and Papua New Guinea:
The subsequent Department of Immigration and Citizenship press release stated: &quot;Australia will work with PNG to expand the Manus Island Regional Processing Centre, as well as explore the construction of other regional processing centres in Papua New Guinea...The arrangements also allows for other countries (including Pacific Island states) to participate in similar arrangements in the future.&quot;

The number of arrivals continued to climb, to 25,173 in the 2012–13 financial year, and approximately 862 asylum seekers died trying to reach Australia between 2008 and July 2013. In June 2013, Kevin Rudd toppled Gillard in another leadership spill, following weeks of polls indicating the ALP would be defeated at the next election.

==Operation Sovereign Borders==

A new policy on boat arrival deterrence, Operation Sovereign Borders, was launched by the new Liberal–National Coalition on 18 September 2013.

==Papua New Guinea==
The Regional Resettlement Arrangement between Australia and Papua New Guinea, colloquially known as the PNG solution, is an Australian Government policy in which any asylum seeker who comes to Australia by boat without a visa will be refused settlement in Australia, instead being settled in Papua New Guinea if they are found to be legitimate refugees. The policy includes a significant expansion of the Australian immigration detention facility on Manus Island, where refugees will be sent to be processed prior to resettlement in Papua New Guinea, and if their refugee status is found to be non-genuine, they will be either repatriated, sent to a third country other than Australia or remain in detention indefinitely. The policy was announced on 19 July 2013 by Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Peter O&#x27;Neill, effective immediately, in response to a growing number of asylum seeker boat arrivals. The then Opposition Leader Tony Abbott initially welcomed the policy, while Greens leader Christine Milne and several human rights advocate groups opposed it, with demonstrations protesting the policy held in every major Australian city after the announcement.

===Announcement===
In the fortnight prior to the announcement of the PNG solution, Rudd visited Indonesia for regular annual talks with Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono where they discussed asylum seeker issues, but played down expectations of a policy announcement. On 15 July, he and Immigration Minister Tony Burke visited Papua New Guinea to discuss asylum seeker policy, in light of a UN Refugee Agency report saying the Manus Island detention centre did not meet international standards.

On 19 July 2013, Rudd, Burke and Papua New Guinean Prime Minister Peter O&#x27;Neill announced the policy in Brisbane. Rudd declared &quot;From now on, any asylum seeker who arrives in Australia by boat will have no chance of being settled in Australia as refugees.&quot; In his speech, he said that asylum seekers taken to Christmas Island will be sent to Manus Island or elsewhere, where their refugee status will be assessed. The announcement also outlined plans to expand the Manus Island detention facility, from 600 occupants to 3,000. All refugees found to be legitimate will be resettled in Papua New Guinea. Any asylum seekers found to be non-genuine refugees will either be repatriated, moved to a third country other than Australia if it is unsafe to be repatriated, or remain in detention indefinitely. Australia will bear the full cost of the setup of the policy, as well as provide funding for reforms of Papua New Guinea&#x27;s university sector, and assistance with health, education and law and order. Rudd described the policy as &quot;a very hard-line decision&quot; to &quot;combat the scourge of people smuggling&quot;. The two-page Regional Resettlement Arrangement outlining the policy was signed by Rudd and O&#x27;Neill prior to the announcement.

===Reception===
The Australian Opposition Leader Tony Abbott initially showed support for the policy, but said it &quot;wouldn&#x27;t work under Mr Rudd&quot;. The Australian Greens leader Christine Milne slammed the announcement, describing the announcement as &quot;a day of shame&quot;. It was condemned by human rights groups such as Amnesty International Australia, who wrote &quot;Mark this day in history as the day Australia decided to turn its back on the world&#x27;s most vulnerable people, closed the door and threw away the key&quot;; and the UN Refugee Agency, describing the policy as potentially &quot;harmful to the physical and psycho-social wellbeing of transferees, particularly families and children&quot;. Protests of hundreds of refugee supporters were held in Melbourne, Sydney, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide following the announcement.

On Manus Island, public opinion regarding the policy and the expansion of the detention centre was mixed. Gary Juffa, governor of the Oro Province, suggested asylum seekers resettled there are likely to be met with hostility.

<text>Benjamin Church (August 24, 1734 – 1778) was effectively the first Surgeon General of the United States Army, serving as the &quot;Chief Physician &amp; Director General&quot; of the Medical Service of the Continental Army from July 27, 1775, to October 17, 1775. He was also active in Boston&#x27;s Sons of Liberty movement in the years before the war. However, early in the American Revolution, Church was also sending secret information to General Thomas Gage, the British commander, and when one of his letters into Boston was intercepted, he was tried and convicted of &quot;communicating with the enemy&quot;. He was jailed but eventually released, likely dying somewhere in the Caribbean Sea in 1778.

==Biography==

===Family and education===
Church was born in Newport, Colony of Rhode Island, the son of Benjamin Church, a merchant of Boston and deacon of the Hollis Street Church conducted by the Rev. Mather Byles. His great-grandfather, Colonel Benjamin Church, took a prominent part in the war with the Narragansett Indians and led the force which hunted King Philip to his death on August 12, 1676. Church (the third Benjamin Church) was a &quot;Mayflower&quot; descendant through his great-great-grandmother Elizabeth Warren Church, who was the daughter of Richard Warren, one of the &quot;Mayflower&quot; passengers. Benjamin&#x27;s sister Alice married Boston printer John Fleeming.

The third Benjamin attended the Boston Latin School and graduated from Harvard College in 1754. He studied medicine with Joseph Pynchon, later continuing his studies in London. While there, he married Hannah Hill of Ross, Herefordshire. Returning to Boston he built up a reputation as a talented physician and a skillful surgeon. Church performed cataract surgery, and is also remembered for treating the eye ailments of John Adams. By 1769, he had acquired ownership over a slave named John Quamino, who later purchased his freedom with the earnings from a lottery ticket.

===Political ambiguities===
With growing friction between the colonies and Great Britain, Church supported the Whig cause vigorously with his pen. There is evidence that during this period he was variously considered as an ardent Patriot and as a secret Tory sympathizer. He examined the body of Crispus Attucks and treated some of the wounded in the Boston Massacre on March 5, 1770. In 1773, he delivered the annual Massacre Day oration, &quot;To Commemorate the Bloody Tragedy of the Fifth of March 1770&quot;, which marked him as an orator of high order.

In 1774, Church was elected a delegate to the Massachusetts Provincial Congress and later made a member of its Committee of Safety, which was in charge of preparing for armed conflict. Around the same time, Gen. Gage began receiving detailed intelligence on the Provincial Congress&#x27;s activities. On February 21, 1775, the Provincial Congress appointed Church and Joseph Warren a committee to make an inventory of medical supplies necessary for the army and, on March 7, voted them the sum of five hundred pounds for the purchase of such supplies.

On May 8, 1775, after the Revolutionary War had begun, Church became a member of an examining board for surgeons for the army. A June 19 resolution ordered &quot;that Dr. Church, Dr. Taylor, and Dr. Whiting be a committee to consider what method is proper to take to supply the hospitals with surgeons and that the same gentlemen be a committee to provide medicine and other necessaries for hospitals.&quot; As the chairman of a subcommittee of the Committee of Safety, he signed a report on May 12 which recommended a system of defensive works on Prospect Hill and Bunker Hill. Colleagues noted, however, that he had insisted on entering Boston soon after the Battle of Lexington and Concord, and while there he was seen in conference with British General Thomas Gage; he claimed to have been arrested and released.

===Director General===
In May, Church went to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to consult the Continental Congress about the defense of Massachusetts colony. On July 27, that body authorized the establishment of a Medical Department of the Army with a Director General and Chief Physician who would be head of both the Hospital Department of the first Army Hospital and of the first headquarters of regimental surgeons (located in the Henry Vassall House, Cambridge, MA). In the meantime, on July 2, General George Washington had arrived at Cambridge to take command of the colonial forces, and Church was one of the committee appointed to receive him.

Church had difficulty administering his department, and the regimental surgeons. A storm of complaints poured into Army headquarters, and Washington was compelled to order an investigation of the Medical Service. In his own defense, Church complained that rivals were jealous of his position and reportedly asked for permission to leave the Army. In the meantime, an incident arose which brought him before an Army court martial on October 4, 1775.

===&quot;Criminal correspondence&quot; and court martial===
In July 1775, Church had sent a cipher letter addressed to a Major Cane, a British officer in Boston, through a former mistress. The letter was intercepted by another of the woman&#x27;s ex-lovers, and was sent to Washington in September. When two teams of gentlemen decoded it, they found it contained an account of the American forces before Boston, though no disclosures of great importance. It did, however, declare Church&#x27;s devotion to the Crown, and it asked for directions for continuing the correspondence.

The matter was placed before a court of inquiry made up of general officers, Washington presiding, to whom Church admitted the authorship of the letter, but explained that it was written with the object of impressing the enemy with the strength and position of the colonial forces in order to prevent an attack while the Continental army was still short of ammunition and in hopes of aiding to bring about an end to hostilities. The court considered that Church had carried on a criminal correspondence with the enemy and recommended that the matter be referred to the Continental Congress for its action. The report of Washington to the President of Congress stated:

Church was briefly incarcerated in a room of the Henry Vassall House in Cambridge, where his carved name can be seen today.

The Massachusetts Provincial Congress arraigned Church on November 2. Despite an eloquent appeal in his own defense, he was unanimously expelled as a member of the House due to other &quot;coded documents&quot; of his being found in the trial proceedings that Congress regarded as proving his guilt. The Continental Congress on October 17, 1775, elected John Morgan &quot;in the room of&quot; Church, and on November 7 passed the following resolution:

In accordance with this resolution, Church was confined at Norwich, Connecticut. Becoming ill, he was released from jail in January 1776, and was permitted considerable movement under guard. On May 13, he returned to Massachusetts under bond. He remained imprisoned until 1778, and was named in the Massachusetts Banishment Act of that year. Shortly thereafter he sailed from Boston, presumably for Martinique, but the vessel on which he took passage was never heard from again.

==Assessment==
When scholars were able to open General Gage&#x27;s files early in the 20th century, they discovered earlier letters with significant intelligence about the American forces that could only have come from Church. The files included notes that had been entrusted to him to carry into and out of Boston. Until then, historians had had difficulty estimating the degree of Church&#x27;s guilt. It is now clear that he was supplying the British military with information in early 1775.

Church&#x27;s widow and family were pensioned by the British government.

==Popular culture==
*In the video game &quot;Assassin&#x27;s Creed III&quot;, Church is portrayed as a member of the antagonistic Templars, and secretly joins the service of George Washington in order to influence him and his army. However, after losing faith in the Templar cause, he betrays his Order by secretly spying for the British and, after being exposed and disgraced, attempts to flee to England aboard the fictional man o&#x27;war HMS &quot;Welcome&quot; with supplies stolen from Washington&#x27;s army. He is intercepted by the Assassin Connor Kenway and his father, Templar Grand Master Haytham Kenway; the &quot;Welcome&quot; is boarded and a defiant Church is beaten severely by Haytham before Connor stabs him to death and retrieves the supplies from a nearby island.
*Church appears as a character in the novel &quot;Thieftaker&quot; by D. B. Jackson in which he examines the titular character.

<text>Eugene H. Hasenfus (born January 22, 1941) is a former United States Marine who helped fly weapons shipments on behalf of the U.S. government to the right wing rebel Contras in Nicaragua. The sole survivor after his plane was shot down by the Nicaraguan government in 1986, he was sentenced to 30 years in prison for terrorism and other charges, but pardoned and released the same year. The statements of admission he made to the Sandinista government resulted in a controversy in the U.S. government, after the Reagan administration denied any connection to him.

==Personal life==
Eugene Hasenfus was born on January 22, 1941. In 1986, he lived in Marinette, Wisconsin. The U.S. Army described him as having joined the Marine Corps in May 1960 and having spent five years in the Corps before receiving an honorable discharge. At the time of his capture, he was married to Sally Hasenfus. He had a brother named William.

==Contra scandal==
===Capture===

On October 5, 1986, Hasenfus was aboard a Fairchild C-123 cargo plane, N4410F, when it was shot down over Nicaragua by the Sandinista government with a Soviet SA-7 surface-to-air missile. The aircraft was brought down when it was approximately north of the border with Costa Rica, and a little over southeast of Managua, Nicaragua&#x27;s capital and largest city. The plane had been flying weapons to the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels, including 50,000 rifle cartridges for the Soviet-made AK-47, 60 collapsible AK-47s, nearly as many RPG-7&#x27;s, and 150 pairs of jungle boots. Three members of the flight crew were killed: Hasenfus was the only survivor. The two pilots and a Nicaraguan radio operator died in the crash. Hasenfus had been wearing a parachute, unusual for Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) operatives at the time. Hasenfus managed to dive out of the open cargo hatch of the plane after it was hit by the Nicaraguan missile; he was later captured while sleeping in a makeshift hammock made from his parachute.

===CIA links===

After he was captured by the Nicaraguan government, Hasenfus stated at a press conference that he had previously dropped supplies to CIA operatives in Southeast Asia, and that flights into Nicaragua were directly supervised by the CIA. His statement also included his recruitment by a friend in the CIA, an operation based in Ilopango airbase in El Salvador, supported by U.S. army colonel James Steele. The CIA and the U.S. government of Ronald Reagan denied any connection with the flight, though they said they supported any civilian effort to support the Contras. U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz stated that the plane had been paid for by private operators, and that none of the men on it had any connection to the U.S. government. 

Hasenfus later repudiated his statement, saying that he was unaware if his fellow workers were employed by the CIA, and that he had only heard rumors to that effect. The men in question, Max Gomez and Ramon Medina, were Cuban Americans. The CIA had at the time been legally forbidden by the U.S. Congress from helping the Contras. Gomez and Medina had been identified as people who had helped organize covert arms supplies to the Contras.

Hasenfus was charged with &quot;terrorism, conspiracy and disturbing public security&quot;. Hasenfus stated that he was sure, however, that the operation to supply the Contras with weapons, named Enterprise, was ultimately supervised by the U.S. government. The capture of Hasenfus provided direct evidence of a link between the Contras, and the U.S. government and the Reagan White house; documents found on the dead men linked them to Oliver North.

===Sentencing and aftermath===
Hasenfus was tried in Nicaragua, and on November 15, 1986, sentenced to 30 years in prison for terrorism and other charges. His wife Sally made a plea to Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega for clemency. Nicaraguan defense minister Humberto Ortega (President Ortega’s brother) stated later that the sentence was not directed at Hasenfus himself, but toward the &quot;irrational, unjust policy&quot; of the U.S. government. On December 17, 1986, Hasenfus was pardoned and released by the Nicaraguan government, at the request of U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd. 

Hasenfus subsequently unsuccessfully sued US Air Force officer Richard Secord, who was involved with organizing weapons shipments to the Contras, Albert Hakim, Southern Air Transport and Corporate Air Services over issues relating to his capture and trial. The controversy over the flight led U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Tip O&#x27;Neill to launch an investigation into the flight. The U.S. press generally suspected that there was more to the story of Hasenfus than the Reagan administration had admitted; according to scholar Scott Armstrong, this had the effect of making them more skeptical of the U.S. government&#x27;s initial denial of the weapons-for-hostages deal during the Iran-Contra affair.

=== Later life ===
Hasenfus continued living in Wisconsin afterwards. In the 2000s he was repeatedly arrested for indecent exposure. After violating the terms of his probation by exposing himself in a Wal-Mart parking lot in Marinette in 2005, he was imprisoned for several months at the Green Bay Correctional Institution. He was released on the 19th anniversary of his release by Nicaragua.
