<text>Bruce Curry (born March 29, 1956, in Marlin, Texas), is an American former professional boxer. He was the WBC Super Lightweight Champion from 1983 to 1984.

==Family==
He is a member of a very traditional family in the boxing scene: he is the oldest of three brothers and all boxers (Bruce&#x27;s younger brother Donald Curry is considered the most successful boxer in the family, having won four belts in the welterweight category (WBC, WBA, IBF and &quot;The Ring&quot;), and one in the light middleweight category (WBC), plus a spot in the International Boxing Hall of Fame).

==Amateur career==
Curry was a two-time Texas Golden Gloves Champion and runner-up to Sugar Ray Leonard at the 1976 U.S. Olympic Boxing Trials. Curry reportedly had an amateur record of 315-11. During his amateur career he was trained by Wesley Gale Parker.

==Professional career==
Curry turned professional in 1976 and won his first fourteen professional fights. On November 18, 1977, he fought Wilfred Benítez, the former WBA Junior Welterweight Champion. Curry knocked Benitez down three times but lost by a controversial ten-round split decision due to the scoring system.

He signed to fight Minoru Sugiya in Japan on January 26, 1978. He was then offered a rematch with Benitez, which would take place a mere 11 days later, on February 4. He decided to go take both fights. He knocked out Sugiya in three rounds and then flew back to the U.S. for the Benitez fight, which Benitez won by a ten-round majority decision. Benitez trained harder for the rematch and Curry was travel-worn. &quot;I just wanted to get it done and go to bed,&quot; Curry said. &quot;I should have sent out for coffee.&quot;

Curry won his next two fights and then lost back-to-back fights, getting stopped in nine rounds by Domingo Ayala and losing to Adolfo Viruet by a ten-round decision. Curry put together three straight wins and then fought Thomas Hearns, who was 19-0 with 18 knockouts. The 6&#x27; 1&quot; Hearns stopped Curry in three rounds, however, the fight is best remembered in boxing circles as a rare but true example of &quot;going down swinging,&quot; with Curry punching valiantly even as he fell to the canvas.

He won eleven of his next thirteen fights and then got his first world title shot. On May 18, 1983, Curry beat Leroy Haley by a twelve-round unanimous decision to win the WBC Super Lightweight Championship. Curry&#x27;s younger brother, Donald, won the WBA Welterweight Championship several months earlier. They were the first pair of brothers to hold world titles simultaneously. Another Curry brother, Graylin, was also a professional boxer.

Curry made two successful title defenses, knocking out Hidekazu Akai in seven rounds and winning a rematch with Haley by a twelve-round split decision. On January 29, 1984, Curry lost the title by a tenth-round knockout to Billy Costello.

On February 2, 1984, Curry was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, after he fired several shots at his trainer, Jesse Reid, following an altercation at a gym. He had fought with Reid after blaming him for his loss to Costello. Curry was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and carrying a concealed weapon.

Curry was found innocent by reason of insanity and ordered confined to a mental hospital until he was no longer a threat to society. He was released on March 26, 1985, after a team of three psychiatrists said he was no longer mentally ill.

Curry fought just one more time, defeating Tomas Garcia by a ten-round decision on April 29, 1986. He finished with a record of 35-8 with 17 knockouts.

<text>&quot;Touched by the Hand of God&quot; is a song by English band New Order, released as a single on 7 December 1987. The song was originally recorded for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Salvation!&quot; and the version released as a single was remixed by Arthur Baker. The B-side was a dub remix, titled &quot;Touched by the Hand of Dub&quot;, and the release had the catalogue number FAC 193; its production is credited to New Order.

Although not a track taken from a studio album, &quot;Touched by the Hand of God&quot; appears on the 2008 collector&#x27;s edition of New Order&#x27;s album &quot;Brotherhood&quot; in its remix version, on the 1994 compilation &quot;The Best of New Order&quot; and in remixed form on 1995&#x27;s &quot;The Rest of New Order&quot;. In the US, the song was released as the B-side to the group&#x27;s following single &quot;Blue Monday 1988&quot;, though it was billed as a double A-side on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Dance Club Play and Maxi-Singles charts.

==Music video==
The video that accompanied the song was directed by Kathryn Bigelow, and parodied glam metal groups of the same period, with the band miming to the music while wearing long wigs and leather clothing. The video also contains a love scene that is intercut with the performance shots, and stars Femi Gardiner and Bill Paxton. The concept was proposed by manager Rob Gretton, and was inspired by the band having seen the clichés of then-popular videos on MTV while touring America. Bassist Peter Hook said in a 2000 interview that one of the bands that served as inspiration for the spoof video was Mötley Crüe, whose song “Girls, Girls, Girls” played in heavy rotation on MTV at the time.

<text>Samsu-iluna (Amorite: &quot;Shamshu-iluna&quot;, &quot;The Sun (is) our god&quot;) (–1712 BC) was the seventh king of the founding Amorite dynasty of Babylon. His reign is estimated from 1749 BC to 1712 BC (middle chronology), or from 1686 to 1648 BC (short chronology). He was the son and successor of Hammurabi (r. 1792-1750 BC) by an unknown mother. His reign was marked by the violent uprisings of areas conquered by his father and the abandonment of several important cities (primarily in 

==Circumstances of Samsu-iluna&#x27;s reign==
When Hammurabi rose to power in the city of Babylon, he controlled a small region directly around that city, and was surrounded by vastly more powerful opponents on all sides. By the time he died, he had conquered Sumer, Eshnunna, Assyria and Mari making himself master of Mesopotamia. He had also significantly weakened and humiliated Elam and the 

While defeated, however, these states were not destroyed; if Hammurabi had a plan for welding them to Babylon he did not live long enough to see it through. Within a few years after his death, Elam and Assyria had left from Babylon&#x27;s orbit and revolutions had started in all the conquered territories. The task of dealing with these troubles—and others—fell to Samsu-iluna. Though he campaigned tirelessly and seems to have won frequently, the king proved unable to stop the empire&#x27;s unwinding. Through it all, however, he did manage to keep the core of his kingdom intact, and this allowed the city of Babylon to cement its position in history.

==Fragmentation of the Empire==

In the 9th year of Samsu-iluna&#x27;s reign a man calling himself Rim-sin (known in the literature as Rim-sin II, and thought to perhaps be a nephew of the Rim-sin who opposed raised a rebellion against Babylonian authority in Larsa which spread to include some 26 cities, among them Uruk, Ur, Isin and Kisurra in the south, and in the north. There is a statue inscription of Samsu-iluna which describes some of this conflict.

Samsu-iluna seems to have had the upper-hand militarily. Within a year he dealt the coalition a shattering blow which took the northern cities out of the fight. In the aftermath the king of Eshnunna, Iluni, was dragged to Babylon and executed by Over the course of the next 4 years, Samsu-iluna&#x27;s armies tangled with Rim-sin&#x27;s forces up and down the borderlands between Babylon, Sumer and Elam. Eventually Samsu-iluna attacked Ur, pulled down its walls and put the city to the sack, he then did the same to Uruk, and Isin as Finally Larsa itself was defeated and Rim-sin II was killed, thus ending the 

A few years later, a pretender calling himself Ilum-ma-ili, and claiming descent from the last king of Isin, raised another pan-Sumerian revolt. Samsu-iluna marched an army to Sumer, and the two met in a battle which proved indecisive; a second battle sometime later went Ilum-ma-ili&#x27;s way, and in its aftermath, he founded the which would remain in control of Sumer for the next 300 years. Samsu-iluna seems to have taken a defensive approach after this; in the 18th year of his reign, he saw to the rebuilding of 6 fortresses in the vicinity of which might have been intended to keep that city under Babylonian control. Ultimately, this proved fruitless; by the time of Samsu-iluna&#x27;s death, Nippur recognized Ilum-ma-ili as 

Apparently, Eshnunna had not reconciled itself to Babylonian control either, because in Samsu-iluna&#x27;s 20th year it rebelled Samsu-iluna marched his army through the region and, presumably after some bloodshed, constructed the fortress of Dur-samsuiluna to keep them in line. This seems to have done the trick, as later documents see Samsu-iluna take a more conciliatory stance repairing infrastructure and restoring 

Both Assyria and Elam used the general chaos to re-assert their independence. Kuturnahunte I of Elam, seizing the opportunity left by Samsu-iluna&#x27;s attack on Uruk, marched into the (now wall-less) city and plundered it. Among the items looted was a statue of Inanna which would not be returned until the reign of Ashurbanipal eleven centuries In Assyria, a native vice regent named Puzur-Sin ejected Asinum who had been a vassal king of his fellow Amorite Hammurabi. A native king Ashur-dugul seized the throne, and a period of civil war in Assyria ensued. Samsu-Iluna seems to have been powerless to intervene, and finally a king named Adasi, restored a stable native dynasty in Assyria, removing any vestages of Amorite-Babylonian influence

In the end, Samsu-iluna was left with a kingdom that was only fractionally larger than the one his father had started out with 50 years prior (but which did leave him mastery of the Euphrates up to and including the ruins of Mari and its The status of Eshnunna is difficult to determine with any accuracy, and while it may have remained in Babylonian hands the city was exhausted and its political influence at an end.

==Depopulation of Sumer==

Samsu-iluna&#x27;s campaigns might not have been solely responsible for the havoc wreaked upon Uruk and Ur, and his loss of Sumer might have been as much a calculated retreat as defeat.

Records in the cities of Ur and Uruk essentially stop after the 10th year of Samsu-iluna&#x27;s reign, their priests apparently continued writing, but from more northerly Larsa&#x27;s records also end about this time. Records keep going in Nippur and Isin until Samsu-iluna&#x27;s 29th year, and then cease there as well. These breaks are also observed in the archeological record, where evidence points to these cities being largely or completely abandoned for hundreds of years, until well into the 

Reasons for this are hard to come by. Certainly the constant warfare cannot have helped matters, but Samsu-iluna appears to have campaigned just as hard in the north, and that region was thriving during the The rise of Babylon marks a definite end to Sumerian cultural dominance of Mesopotamia and a shift to Akkadian for government and popular perhaps people who claimed cultural ties to the Sumerian past retrenched around the southerly cities which Iluna-ilu controlled. Several members of his dynasty took Sumerian names, and it appears they consciously strove to return to the region&#x27;s Sumerian It is also possible that economic or environmental factors were involved; it is known that both Hammurabi and Rim-sin I had instituted policies which altered the economies of the perhaps these proved unsustainable in the long-term.

==Other campaigns==
*Slaving raids by Sutean tribes appear to have been a constant problem for Babylon during this period, and Samsu-iluna spent some time dealing with He promulgated a law barring Babylonian citizens from purchasing as slaves citizens of the (presumably oft-raided) cities of Idamaras and 
*In the 9th year of his reign, Samsu-iluna turned back an invasion by a Kassite This is the earliest known mention of the Kassites, who would go on to rule Babylonia after the collapse of the Amorite dynasty.
*Around the 24th year of his reign, Samsu-iluna attacked and destroyed the city of Apum, killing its king Yakun-ashar. A year later he seems to have attacked the city of Terqa as well, possibly adding it to his 
*In his 28th year, Samsu-iluna defeated the armies of two otherwise unknown western kings recorded as Iadikhabum and 
*In the 35th year of his reign, Samsu-iluna repelled an Amorite 

==Religious and Astronomical achievements==
Though troubled, Samsu-iluna&#x27;s reign was not entirely focused on war. He is known to have rebuilt the walls of Kish, Nippur and Sippar for and to have propagated the Marduk cult as had his father. He also apparently restored the E-babbar temple of Shamash(Also known as Utu) in Larsa,ziggurats at and the ziggurat of Zababa and Ishtar at 

Additionally, there is speculation that Samsu-iluna instituted the Standard Babylonian calendar, possibly as a means of tying his empire more closely together.

<text>Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) Second Central Committee or CPI (M-L) 2nd CC is a political party in India. It emerged in 1973 when the pro-Charu Majumdar faction of the original CPI (M-L) got divided into pro and anti-Lin Piao groups. The CPI (M-L) 2nd CC represents the pro-Lin Piao stream. At present, the party is active in states like Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal.

==History==
The undivided CPI (M-L), the mother organization of CPI (M-L) 2nd CC, was formed in 1969 by the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries, which had actually split from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in 1967 after a protracted course of inner-party struggle against revisionist and neo-revisionist deviations. The CPI (M-L), led by radical Communist leaders like Charu Majumdar, Saroj Dutta, Jagjit Singh Sohal and others, advocated armed struggle against parliamentary elections. They categorised India as a semi-feudal, semi-colonial state led by the comprador bourgeoisie and the feudal class under the dictates of imperialism and social-imperialism. From 1969 to 1972, the party fought the Indian state tirelessly by taking to the path of ‘protracted people’s war’ of Mao Zedong and built up the struggles of Srikakulam, Kheri-Lakhimpur, Mushahari, Debra-Gopiballabhpur etc. In 1970 it organised its First Party Congress in Calcutta, West Bengal.

The CPI (M-L), however, could not continue with the struggle it had launched against the state and its alleged agents. After its general secretary&#x27;s (Charu Majumdar) death on 28 July 1972 at Lal Bazar Police Custody in Calcutta, it got divided into different factions, one of which was pro-Charu Majumdar by nature. In 1973, after the 10th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party, the pro-Charu Majumdar CPI (M-L) became further divided into two groups, namely pro and anti-Lin Piao factions. Mahadev Mukherjee was the leader of the pro-Lin Piao group.

The pro-Lin Piao faction organized its &#x27;Second Party Congress&#x27; in December 1973 at Kamalpur, a Naxalite bastion in Hooghly-Burdwan district frontier. The Congress reaffirmed the programme of the undivided CPI (M-L), adopted at the first party congress in 1970, and paid red salutes to Lin Piao and Charu Majumdar. As soon as the Congress was over, the party launched a wave of weapon snatches, attacks on police, prison escapes and annihilation campaigns. By 1973-74 10 policemen in West Bengal were killed by the party and there were 39 incidents of gun snatching. But when the state machinery came down on the revolutionaries heavily, the party had to face a serious setback. Most of the leaders were either incarcerated or killed. The reorganisation process, therefore, began after August 1977 when the detainees were released.

In September 1978, as a result of the annihilation of a landowner at Manihari in Katihar district of Bihar, the Central Committee got divided between Mahadev Mukherjee and his supporters on the one hand and the hardliner section of the party led by Ajijul Haque and Nishit Bhattacharya on the other. After Mahadev Mukherjee&#x27;s expulsion Haque and Bhattacharya assumed leadership and reorganised the party. They named it CPI (M-L) 2nd CC as a continuation of the Central Committee that was elected in the Second Party Congress (Kamalpur) in 1973. During Haque and Bhattacharya&#x27;s tenure, that is between 1978 and 1982, CPI (M-L) 2nd CC formed a provisional revolutionary government in the rural areas of North and South Bengal and in the struggle zones of Bihar. After a series of clashes with the state, both Haque and Bhattacharya were arrested. They were subsequently expelled from the party due to Haque signing a cease fire deal with the government of West Bengal. After their expulsion 2nd CC gradually became a dying force. Despite a number of efforts, the new leadership could not raise the level of struggles. On 19 May 2003 a part of the party merged with the Maoist Communist Centre of India. It had to withdraw its pro-Lin Piao stand for the merger to go through.

==Basic Standpoints==
The Basic Standpoints of CPI (M-L) 2nd CC are as follows:
* It believes that it is the only genuine heir of the undivided CPI (M-L) that was formed on 22 April 1969 by Charu Majumdar and his comrades.
* It takes Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong thought and Charu Mazumdar’s Politics as its theoretical guideline.
* It believes that this is the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution in which imperialism is heading for total collapse and socialism is advancing, despite temporary setbacks, to worldwide victory.
* It maintains that India is a semi-feudal and semi-colonial country based on Neo-colonial nature of exploitation.
* It rejects the parliamentary path for the whole of this strategic period and advocates the path of armed agrarian revolution by waging a successful people’s war—encircling cities with villages as shown by Mao and Lin Piao.

<doc id="1094884" wikidata="Q585358" url="?curid=1094884" title="Kilim">
<text>A kilim ( ; ; ) is a flat tapestry-woven carpet or rug traditionally produced in countries of the former Persian Empire, including Iran, but also in the Balkans and the Turkic countries. Kilims can be purely decorative or can function as prayer rugs. Modern kilims are popular floor coverings in Western households.

==Etymology==

The word &#x27;kilim&#x27; originates from the Persian () where it means &#x27;to spread roughly&#x27;, perhaps of Akkadian or Aramean origin.

==History==
Like pile carpets, kilim have been produced since ancient times. The explorer Mark Aurel Stein found kilims dating to at least the fourth or fifth century CE in Hotan, China:

:&quot;As kilims are much less durable than rugs that have a pile to protect the warp and weft, it is not surprising that few of great age remain... The weave is almost identical with that of modern kilims, and has about fourteen threads of warp and sixteen threads of weft to the inch. The pattern consists of narrow stripes of blue, green, brownish yellow, and red, containing very small geometric designs. With this one exception, so peculiarly preserved, there are probably very few over a century old.&quot;

==Weaving technique==

Kilims are produced by tightly interweaving the warp and weft strands of the weave to produce a flat surface with no pile. Kilim weaves are tapestry weaves, technically weft-faced plain weaves, that is, the horizontal weft strands are pulled tightly downward so that they hide the vertical warp strands.

When the end of a color boundary is reached, the weft yarn is wound back from the boundary point. Thus, if the boundary of a field is a straight vertical line, a vertical slit forms between the two different color areas where they meet. For this reason, most kilims can be classed as &quot;slit woven&quot; textiles. The slits are beloved by collectors, as they produce very sharp-etched designs, emphasizing the geometry of the weave. Weaving strategies for avoiding slit formation, such as interlocking, produce a more blurred design image.

The weft strands, which carry the visible design and color, are almost always wool, whereas the hidden warp strands can be either wool or cotton. The warp strands are only visible at the ends, where they emerge as the fringe. This fringe is usually tied in bunches, to ensure against loosening or unraveling of the weave.&#x27;

== Motifs ==

Many motifs are used in Turkish kilims, each with many variations. A few examples are illustrated here, with meanings as described by Güran Erbek in &quot;Kilim&quot;. A widely used motif is the elibelinde, a stylized female figure representing motherhood and fertility. Other motifs express the tribal weavers&#x27; desires for protection of their families&#x27; flocks from wolves with the wolf&#x27;s mouth or the wolf&#x27;s foot motif (Turkish: , ), or for safety from the sting of the scorpion (Turkish: ). Several motifs hope for the safety of the weaver&#x27;s family from the evil eye (Turkish: , also used as a motif), which could be divided into four with a cross symbol (Turkish: ), or averted with the symbol of a hook (Turkish: ), a human eye (Turkish: ), or an amulet (Turkish: ; often, a triangular package containing a sacred verse). Such an amulet woven into a rug is not a picture of the thing itself: it actually is an amulet, believed to confer protection by its presence.

Other motifs symbolise fertility, as with the trousseau chest motif (Turkish: ), or the explicit fertility (, ) motif. The motif for running water (Turkish: ) similarly depicts the resource literally. The desire to tie a family or lovers together may be depicted with a fetter motif (Turkish: ). Several other motifs represent the desire for good luck and happiness, as for instance the bird (Turkish: ) and the star or Solomon&#x27;s seal (Turkish: ). The oriental symbol of yin and yang is used for love and unison (Turkish: ).

==Rugs and commerce==
Because kilims are often cheaper than pile rugs, beginning carpet collectors often start with them. Despite what many perceive as their secondary (or inferior) status to pile carpets, kilims have become increasingly collectible in themselves in recent years, with quality pieces now commanding high prices. What some sensed as inferiority was actually a different nature of rugs woven for indigenous use as opposed to rugs woven on a strictly commercial basis. Because kilims were not a major export commodity, there were no foreign market pressures changing the designs, as happened with pile carpets. Once collectors began to value authentic village weaving, kilims became popular. Three factors then combined to reduce the quality of the West&#x27;s newly discovered kilims. The first was a development in industrial chemistry. An important element in the attractiveness of traditional rugs is &quot;abrash&quot;, the dappled appearance resulting from variation in shade of each colour caused by hand-dyeing of the yarn. The synthetic (aniline-derived) dyes introduced late in the Victorian era abolished abrash, giving brilliant colours which however often faded with time. A second factor was the loss of the nomadic way of life across Central Asia. Once people had settled, the tribal character of their weavings faded. A third factor was a direct consequence of the kilim&#x27;s new-found marketability. As rugs began to be made for export and money rather than personal use, the local style and social significance of each type of carpet was lost. Patterns and colours were chosen to suit the market, rather than woven according to tradition and to suit the needs of the weaver&#x27;s family and the weaver&#x27;s own hopes and fears.
===Anatolian (Turkish)===
Perhaps the best known and most highly regarded, these kilims are traditionally distinguished by the areas, villages or cities in which they are produced, such as Konya, Malatya, Karapınar and Hotamis. Most Anatolian kilims are slit woven. Larger antique kilims were woven in two to three separate sections on small nomadic horizontal floor looms in three feet wide long strips, then carefully sewn together matching the patterns edges to create an ultimately wider rug. These pieces are still produced in very limited quantities by nomadic tribes for their personal use and are commonly known as cicims.

*Cicim or Jijim or Jajim are kilims woven in narrow strips that are sewn together.
*Zili is a rough supplementary-weft method used to decorate practical objects such as mats, sacks, cushions and tents.

<text>A diluent (also referred to as a filler, dilutant or thinner) is a diluting agent. Certain fluids are too viscous to be pumped easily or too dense to flow from one particular point to the other. This can be troublesome, because it might not be economically feasible to transport such fluids in this state. To ease this restricted movement, diluents are added. This decreases the viscosity of the fluids, thereby also decreasing the pumping/transportation costs.

One industrial application is the transport of crude oil via pipelines. Heavy crude oil/bitumen are fluids with high viscosity, especially at low temperatures. The addition of a diluent enables the diluted fluid (dilbit in the case of bitumen) to meet pipeline specifications in order for it to be efficiently transported. Typical diluent in this case is naphtha or condensate.

Types of diluents more familiar to the general public include paint thinner and nail polish thinner, both of which improve the consistency and applicability of the products to which they are added. Diluent is also used as a term in solvent extraction for an inert solvent in which a metal extraction agent (extractant) is dissolved. In solvent extraction the diluent has potentially several uses. It can be used as a solvent (in the purely chemical sense rather than the solvent extraction sense) to dissolve an extractant which is a solid and so render it suitable for use in a liquid–liquid extraction process. In other cases such as PUREX nuclear reprocessing the diluent (kerosene) is used to reduce the maximum metal loading which the organic layer can reach. If the organic layer was to acquire too much metal then a solid metal complex might form, or more worryingly in a nuclear process the potential for a criticality accident if the fissile metal concentration in the organic phase becomes too high. Commonly in both lab and industrial solvent extraction of metals petroleum kerosene is used as a diluent, but in recent times it has been shown that Neste&#x27;s second generation biodiesel which was formed by hydrodeoxygenation can be used as a diluent.

Water is probably the most common and familiar diluent, but many substances, such as oils, do not dissolve well in water and therefore require different diluents to be diluted effectively without separating into parts.

==Medications==
Diluents are also very important in the pharmaceutical industry. They are inactive ingredients that are added to tablets and capsules in addition to the active drug. For example, a Tylenol 325 mg tablet does not weigh 325 mg. This is the weight of the active acetaminophen, while the tablet weighs more due to other additives known as diluents. These additives may be used as binders, disintegrants (help the tablet break apart in the digestive system), or flavor enhancers. Some very common diluents in tablets include starch, cellulose derivatives, and magnesium stearate (a lubricant). (See also Excipient.)

Diluents are also used in vaccines such as MMR to reconstitute the vaccine after storage.

== Breathing gas ==
In underwater diving a diluent gas is generally used to reduce the oxygen fraction of the breathing gas to a non-toxic level appropriate to the ambient pressure at which it is to be breathed. Diluent gases for this use are metabolically inert and non-toxic, but may have some level of narcotic effect at high partial pressure. The commonly used diluents for breathing gases are nitrogen, provided in the form of air, and helium, provided as heliox, or both nitrogen and helium together as trimix. The diluent used in scuba rebreathers contains enough oxygen to support life as it is also used as a bailout gas.

Helium is also useful as a breathing gas diluent to reduce work of breathing of gases, both at high ambient pressures, and for medical purposes, but it is an expensive gas, which limits its utility.

==Drugs==
The 1985 diethylene glycol wine scandal was an incident in which several Austrian wineries illegally adulterated their wines using the toxic substance diethylene glycol (a primary ingredient in some brands of antifreeze) to make the wines appear sweeter and more full-bodied in the style of late harvest wines.

<text>The Pulaski Yankees were a minor league baseball team based in Pulaski, Virginia, United States. They were an Advanced Rookie League team in the Appalachian League. The team played its home games at Calfee Park. They were affiliated with several Major League Baseball teams, including the New York Yankees in their final season.

The Pulaski Yankees were awarded Minor League Baseball&#x27;s top honor, the John H. Johnson President&#x27;s Award, in 2019. The award recognizes the &quot;complete baseball franchise—based on franchise stability, contributions to league stability, contributions to baseball in the community, and promotion of the baseball industry.&quot;

The start of the 2020 season was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic before ultimately being cancelled on June 30. In conjunction with a contraction of Minor League Baseball beginning with the 2021 season, the Appalachian League was reorganized as a collegiate summer baseball league, and the Yankees were replaced by a new franchise, the Pulaski River Turtles, in the revamped league designed for rising college freshmen and sophomores.

Pulaski&#x27;s teams won the Appalachian League&#x27;s championship in , , , and .

Pulaski was the 2010 Appalachian League Eastern Division Champion.

==Ballpark==
The Pulaski Yankees played at Calfee Park. Calfee Park opened in 1935 and had a capacity of 3,200 fans. A number of houses that surround the park had good views of games.

The park had major renovations prior to the season, with a new grandstand behind the plate and along the first-base side as well as &quot;open-air suites&quot; (railed-in areas with picnic tables) farther down on the first-base line. A new scoreboard was also installed.

Since the Shelor Automotive Group purchased Calfee Park from the Town of Pulaski in 2015, ownership has completed numerous upgrades including a renovated home team clubhouse; a new visiting team clubhouse, concession stand, press box, and souvenir store; the addition of two VIP Towers, upgrading seating, and a 35’ x 22’ JumboTron; a Bermuda grass playing field and new irrigation system; construction of new home offices for ballpark employees; and the expansion of the upper concourse.

Most recently prior to the 2019 season, a three-tiered party deck and new boxes were added along the third base line, increasing the ballpark&#x27;s capacity to 3,200. Additional upgrades including 800 new seats behind the party deck and new concessions points of sale were planned for 2020 before being put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Calfee Park was voted the best rookie-level ballpark in America in 2019 and 2020 by a fan vote in Ballpark Digest&#x27;s annual Best of the Ballparks competition.

<doc id="1094913" wikidata="Q1342453" url="?curid=1094913" title="World in Motion">
<text>&quot;World in Motion...&quot; is a song by British band New Order (performed with the England national football team, credited as ENGLANDneworder). The song is New Order&#x27;s only number-one song on the UK Singles Chart. It was produced for the England national football team&#x27;s 1990 FIFA World Cup campaign and features a guest rap by England footballer John Barnes and additional vocals by several members of the English team of 1990 and comedian Keith Allen, who co-wrote the lyrics.

Singer Bernard Sumner described the single to &quot;NME&quot; as &quot;the last straw for Joy Division fans&quot;, noting how its upbeat sound had inverted their former band&#x27;s famously gloomy image. The song was originally to be called &quot;E for England&quot;, with lyrics that ran &quot;E is for England, England starts with E / We&#x27;ll all be smiling when we&#x27;re in Italy&quot;, but the Football Association vetoed the title, realising that it sounded suspiciously like a reference to the drug ecstasy.

==Song==
===Origins===
The Football Association&#x27;s (FA) press officer at the time, David Bloomfield, who had been a fan of Joy Division, contacted Tony Wilson, the head of New Order&#x27;s label Factory Records, with the suggestion that the band record a track for the forthcoming World Cup in Italy. Without any hesitation, Wilson agreed. Bloomfield had seen and heard England&#x27;s previous World Cup tunes and thought them uniformly dull, with the possible exception of the 1970 single, &quot;Back Home&quot;.

Bloomfield had been inspired by a track by Colourbox called &quot;The Official Colourbox World Cup Theme&quot;, and he had noticed that the respected BBC Radio DJ John Peel occasionally played tracks by American football teams, deeming them good enough to play on his show without a hint of irony.

Watching television one night, Bloomfield found himself watching &quot;Best and Marsh&quot;, a concoction of football chat and action clips. When the credits ran at the end of the programme, he noticed that the theme music was provided by New Order. In a eureka-like moment, he knew in an instant that he needed to contact Wilson and get the ball rolling.

There was a minor standoff between the agent acting on behalf of the England squad and Wilson with Bloomfield acting to get the parties talking once more. The players were by no means all willing to get involved. They were of the view that World Cup records were all dire and many did not want to be associated with a band that few of them were familiar with.

==Recording==
The recording session took place before the squad met up on the afternoon of 25 March 1990, prior to an international match at Wembley. The FA had requested members of the squad be involved in recording the song and six players turned up on the day; John Barnes, Peter Beardsley, Paul Gascoigne, Steve McMahon, Chris Waddle and Des Walker. On the day of the recording, the lyrics had yet to be finalised, with players, band members and others all collaborating on parts. There was a good mood in the studio as the players added their vocals to the backing track that New Order had put together. The FA placed no restrictions or indeed gave any guidance to New Order, although Bloomfield had warned that he did not want anything associated with hooliganism.

A plan to have each player take turns to sing a line of the rap verse was abandoned, and instead it was decided to audition each player to perform the rap in its entirety. John Barnes ended up being selected after Beardsley, Gascoigne, McMahon and Walker were all deemed unsuitable either due to their broad northern English accents or inability to keep the required rhythm. Waddle was not auditioned as Barnes was selected before he was trialled. As such, Barnes was the only player given a leading vocal on the song, the others being restricted to backing vocals.

The backing track for &quot;World in Motion...&quot; bore some similarities to the instrumental theme tune for the DEF II current affairs programme, &quot;Reportage&quot;, which had been written for the show by Stephen Morris and Gillian Gilbert of New Order. &quot;World in Motion...&quot; was produced by Stephen Hague, who had also produced one of the group&#x27;s earlier hits, &quot;True Faith&quot;. The single was released on 21 May 1990. It was New Order&#x27;s last release on Factory Records.

The &quot;They think it&#x27;s all over&quot; quotation, uttered by football commentator Kenneth Wolstenholme at the end of the 1966 World Cup Final, between England and West Germany, is utilised at the beginning and end of the track (though not the original; Wolstenholme re-recorded the phrase specially for the producers), and somewhat less known samples, such as &quot;A beauty scored by Bobby Charlton&quot; and &quot;We Want Goals&quot;, are taken from &quot;Goal!&quot;, the official documentary film of the tournament of 1966; the voice is that of actor Nigel Patrick.

The squad with Allen shout &quot;express yourself&quot; in the verses and sing the refrain at the end; in the &quot;Carabinieri mix&quot; they are also heard providing backing vocals in the chorus.

A rap is performed by England player John Barnes towards the end of the track. The song was not originally going to feature a rap; it was the brainchild of Keith Allen after he had been recruited to help inject some humour into the song in case of poor reception.

The rap verse has been described as the most memorable part of the original song. According to BBC News entertainment reporter Chris Leggett, Barnes&#x27;s 1990 effort was the first time a footballer had managed a respectable performance in a World Cup song, all previous efforts having been marked by out-of-tune recordings and mimed performances on the likes of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Writers such as Tom McGowan have claimed &quot;even England fans who weren&#x27;t alive in 1990&quot; know the lyrics.

===&quot;The B-Side&quot;===
The single&#x27;s B-side, an early version of the A-side, was titled &quot;The B-Side&quot;, extending the football theme of the release. It was produced by former Swans member Roli Mosimann. Besides a different arrangement and some different lyrics, this version lacks the commentary samples and squad vocals, with Keith Allen&#x27;s &quot;naff football chants and JB impersonation&quot; (as credited on the sleeve) in their place.

===Remixes===
Like &quot;True Faith&quot;, &quot;Fine Time&quot; and &quot;Round &amp; Round&quot; before it, the single was issued on two separate 12&quot; singles, the first featuring the original mix of the song, the second containing reinterpretations by outside remixers. This would be the last New Order single released in this way until &quot;Be a Rebel&quot; in 2020/21. Remixers Andrew Weatherall and Terry Farley were supplied with an alternative chorus vocal, with the result that the chorus hook on their mixes runs &quot;&quot;We&#x27;ve&quot; got the world in motion&quot; rather than the original &quot;&quot;Love&#x27;s&quot; got the world in motion&quot;.

In 1996, LFO&#x27;s Mark Bell remixed version of the song appeared on &quot;The Beautiful Game&quot;, which was released to tie in with Euro 96.

In 2010, one reworked version of the song was used in an advert for the Mars Bar. The A side features heavily in the film &quot;Butterfly Kiss&quot;; both the song itself is heard as well as the two main actresses singing versions of it.

===Re-release===
The single was re-released for the 2002 FIFA World Cup, this time with the track &quot;Such a Good Thing&quot; replacing &quot;The B-Side&quot;. It failed to enter the UK Top 40. This version was planned to have David Beckham performing the rap, but the F.A. vetoed the idea. It was due to have been re-released again in remixed form for the 2006 FIFA World Cup, but despite a release date in the United Kingdom of 29 May 2006, a last-minute decision was taken to shelve this release and the remix has never surfaced. &quot;Such a Good Thing&quot; would be the final original New Order song to be released as a B-side, with all following singles simply including alternate mixes of the A-side and/or previously released tracks (typically in a remixed form).

===Legacy===
In 1998, New Order performed the song live for the first time at the Reading Festival with Allen. In the interim time Allen had written another England football song, the unofficial release &quot;Vindaloo&quot;. Allen performed it with the band again at the Move Festival at the Old Trafford Cricket Ground in 2002, and in 2005 at Glastonbury.

John Barnes has occasionally revisited his rap during public appearances.

The song has often been compared to &quot;Three Lions&quot;, with polls often conducted during England campaigns asking fans which song is better.

In July 2021, the song entered the UK Singles Chart again, charting at number 61 on the chart dated 9–15 July 2021.

== In popular media ==
The rap in the song was featured in a scene in series 2, episode 5 of the British sitcom &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;. In this scene, the character Neil &quot;Smithy&quot; Smith (James Corden) starts the rap when Gavin Shipman (Mathew Horne) opens the door to welcome Smithy to his home. Gavin then joins in the rap, followed by his father, Mick Shipman (Larry Lamb), and then his mother, Pam Shipman (Alison Steadman).

<text>The Department of Posts, d/b/a India Post, is an Indian public sector postal system statutory body headquartered in New Delhi, India. It is an organisation under the Ministry of Communications. Generally known as the Post Office, it is the most widely distributed postal system in the world, and India is the country that has the largest number of post offices in the world. It is involved in delivering mail (post), remitting money by money orders, accepting deposits under Small Savings Schemes, providing life insurance coverage under Postal Life Insurance (PLI) and Rural Postal Life Insurance (RPLI) and providing retail services like bill collection, sale of forms, etc.

Apart from delivering services to general public and corporates, India Post is also proud custodian of a rich heritage of postal buildings that echo the historical evolution and architectural grandeur of bygone eras. India Post has declared 44 heritage buildings so far.

Warren Hastings had taken initiative under East India Company to start the Postal Service in the country in 1766. It was initially established under the name &quot;Company Mail&quot;. It was later modified into a service under the Crown in 1854 by Lord Dalhousie. Dalhousie introduced uniform postage rates (universal service) and helped to pass the India Post Office Act 1854 which significantly improved upon 1837 Post Office act which had introduced regular post offices in India. It created the position Director General of Post for the whole country. The DoP also acts as an agent for the Indian government in discharging other services for citizens such as old age pension payments and Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) wage disbursement. With 164,972 post offices (as of March 2024), India Post is the widest postal network in the world.

The country has been divided into 23 postal circles, each circle headed by a Chief Postmaster General. Each circle is divided into regions, headed by a Postmaster General and comprising field units known as Divisions. These divisions are further divided into subdivisions. In addition to the 23 circles, there is a base circle to provide postal services to the Armed Forces of India headed by a Director General. One of the highest post offices in the world is in Hikkim, At 4,400m above sea level in northern India&#x27;s remote Spiti Valley, the Hikkim post office is a vital connection to the outside world.

==History==

===Posts and the British Raj (1858–1947)===
The British Raj was instituted in 1858, when the rule of the East India Company was transferred to the Crown.

A number of acts were enacted during the British Raj to expand and regulate posts and telegraphs service:
*The Government Savings Bank Act, 1873 (5 of 1873), passed by the legislature 28 January 1873, was enacted in 1881. On 1 April 1882, Post Office Savings Banks opened throughout India (except in the Bombay Presidency). In Madras Presidency, it was limited; in the Bengal Presidency, no POSBs were established in Calcutta or Howrah.
*Postal life insurance began on 1 February 1884 as a welfare measure for the employees of the Posts &amp; Telegraphs Department as Government of India dispatch No. 299 dated 18 October 1882 to the Secretary of State.
*The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885
*The Indian Post Office Act, 1898, passed by the legislature on 22 March 1898, became effective on 1 July 1898 regulating postal service. It was preceded by Act III of 1882 and Act XVI of 1896.
*The Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933

The world&#x27;s first official airmail flight took place in India on 18 February 1911, a journey of lasting 27 minutes. Henri Pequet, a French pilot, carried about of mail (approximately 6,000 letters and cards) across the Ganges from Allahabad to Naini; included in the airmail was a letter to King George V of the United Kingdom. India Post inaugurated a floating post office in August 2011 at Dal Lake in Srinagar, Kashmir. Telegraphy and telephony made their appearance as part of the postal service before becoming separate departments. One unique telegraph office was established and operated in the capital of Lhasa until the People&#x27;s Republic of China&#x27;s annexation of Tibet. The Posts and Telegraphs departments merged in 1914, later separated again on 1 January 1985.

===After independence in 1947===
Since India became independent in 1947, the postal service continues to function on a nationwide basis, providing a variety of services. The structure of the organization has the directorate at its apex; below it are circle offices, regional offices, the superintendent&#x27;s offices, head post offices, sub-post offices and branch offices. In April 1959, the Indian Postal Department adopted the motto &quot;Service before help&quot;; it revised its logo in September 2008.
The number of post offices was 23,344 when India became independent in 1947 and these were primarily in urban areas. The number increased to 165,000 2025 and 90% of these were in rural areas.

==Postage-stamp history==
===First adhesive stamps in Asia===
The first adhesive postage stamps in Asia were issued in the Indian district of Scinde in July 1852 by Bartle Frere, chief commissioner of the region. Frere was an admirer of Rowland Hill, the English postal reformer who had introduced the Penny Post. The Scinde stamps became known as &quot;Scinde Dawks&quot;; &quot;Dawk&quot; is the Anglicised spelling of the Hindustani word &quot;Dak&quot; or (&quot;post&quot;). These stamps, with a value of -anna, were in use until June 1866. The first all-India stamps were issued on 1 October 1854.

===Stamps issued by the East India Company===

The volume of mail moved by the postal system increased significantly, doubling between 1854 and 1866 and doubling again by 1871. The Indian Post Office Act, 1866 (XIV) introduced reforms by 1 May 1866 to correct some of the more obvious postal-system deficiencies and abuses. Postal-service efficiencies were also introduced. In 1863, lower rates were set for &quot;steamer&quot; mail to Europe at (six annas, eight pies for a -ounce letter). Lower rates were also introduced for inland mail.

New regulations removed special postal privileges enjoyed by officials of the East India Company. Stamps for official use were prepared and carefully accounted for, to combat abuses by officials. In 1854 Spain had printed special stamps for official communications, but in 1866 India was the first country to adopt the expedient of overprinting &quot;Service&quot; on postage stamps and &quot;Service Postage&quot; on revenue stamps. This innovation was later widely adopted by other countries.

Shortages developed, so stamps also had to be improvised. Some &quot;Service Postage&quot; overprinted rarities resulted from abrupt changes in postal regulations. New designs for the four-anna and six-anna-eight-pie stamps were issued in 1866. Nevertheless, there was a shortage of stamps to meet the new rates. Provisional six-anna stamps were improvised by cutting the top and bottom from a current foreign-bill revenue stamp and overprinting &quot;Postage&quot;. India was the first country in the Commonwealth to issue airmail stamps.

===Post-independence stamps===
India attained independence on 15 August 1947. Thereafter, the Indian Posts and Telegraph Department embarked on a broad-based policy for the issuance of stamps. On 21 November 1947 the first new stamp was issued by independent India. It depicts the Indian flag with the patriots&#x27; slogan, &quot;Jai Hind&quot; (&quot;long live India&quot;), at the top right-hand corner. The stamp was valued at three and one-half annas. A memorial to Mahatma Gandhi was issued 15 August 1948 on the first anniversary of independence. One year later a definitive series appeared, depicting India&#x27;s broad cultural heritage (primarily Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Sikh and Jain temples, sculptures, monuments and fortresses). A subsequent issue commemorated the beginning of the Republic of India on 26 January 1950. Definitives included a technology-and-development theme in 1955, a series depicting a map of India in 1957 (denominated in &quot;naya paisa&quot;—decimal currency) and a 1965 series with a wide variety of images. The old inscription &quot;India Postage&quot; was replaced in 1962 with &quot;भारत INDIA&quot;, although three stamps (issued from December 1962 to January 1963) carried the earlier inscription.

India has printed stamps and postal stationery for other countries, mostly neighbours. Countries which have had stamps printed in India include Burma (before independence), Nepal, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Portugal and Ethiopia. The country has issued definitive and commemorative stamps. Six definitive series on India&#x27;s heritage and progress in a number of fields have been issued. The seventh series, with a theme of science and technology, began in 1986. Between independence and 1983, 770 stamps were issued.

==Losses==

The postal department has always been the biggest loss-making entity in India, surpassing others like the Air India and BSNL, with an annual loss to the exchequer to the tune of ₹15,000 crore in the fiscal year 2019, and amounting to ₹15,541 crore in the calendar year 2020. The following table shows losses incurred by the postal department over the years.

==PIN==

The Postal Index Number (PIN, or sometimes redundantly PIN code) is a six-digit postal code. The PIN system was made by Shriram Bhikaji Velankar when he was at service in Kolkata. It was introduced on 15 August 1972 by former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. There are nine postal zones in the country; the first eight are geographical regions, and the ninth is reserved for the Army Postal Service (APS905898).

The PIN system is organised in the following way:

* The first digit indicates the zone. 
* The first two digits indicate the sub-zone (or postal circle). 
* The first three digits indicate a sorting district. 
* The first four digits indicate a service route.
* The last two digits indicate the delivery post office.

The PIN for an address may be found on the Postal Service website. There are total of 19,101 PINs covering 154,725 post offices in India, with the exception of the Army Postal Service, 2014.

==Digital Address Code==
Indian post proposed a 10 digit unique identification number to each and every address in India based on geo coordinates called DIGIPIN. Digital Address Code (DAC) will be assigned to all types of addresses in the country ranging from independent houses, individual building, every flat in the given apartment, every shop in a commercial building and every individual unit in an office complex. Draft approach paper on Digital Address Code was issued by Indian Post for public comments.

==Project Arrow==
Project Arrow was launched in April 2008. The project plans to upgrade post offices in urban and rural areas, improving service and appearance into a vibrant and responsive organization and to make a visible and positive difference. The project aims to create an effective, friendly environment for staff and customers, providing secure IT services and improving mail delivery, remittances (electronic and manual) and postal-savings plans. Core areas for improvement are branding, information technology, human resources and infrastructure. The project to improve service has been implemented in more than 23,500 post offices, and &#x27;look and feel&#x27; improvements have been made in 2,940 post offices. The Department of Posts received the Prime Minister’s Awards for Excellence in Public Administration during 2008–09 for &quot;Project Arrow – Transforming India Post&quot; on 21 April 2010.

Multipurpose counter machines with computers were introduced in post offices in 1991 to improve customer service and increase staff productivity. 25,000 departmental post offices out of 25,464 were computerized between as of 2011–2012. In 2012, a plan costing was formulated to computerize rural post offices.

==Services==

===Philately===

The first philatelic Society in India was founded in Calcutta on 6 March 1897 to service postage-stamp collections. Function include design, printing and distribution of special or commemorative postage stamps, definitive postage stamps and items of postal stationery, promotion of philately, conduct of philatelic examinations at the national level, participation in international exhibitions and monitoring exhibitions at the state, regional and district levels and maintenance of the National Philatelic Museum. 
Philatelic bureaus were established in head post offices located at circle headquarters and at district-capital head post offices (as necessary). There are 68 philately bureaus and 1111 philatelic counters, including all head post offices (&quot;Mukhya Dak Ghars&quot;) in the country as of 31 March 2011. A domestic philatelic deposit-account system was introduced on 1 August 1965 at all philatelic bureaus. Customers are given priority in purchasing commemorative or special-issue stamps, first-day covers and information sheets soon after their issue by opening a deposit account at any philatelic bureau. The number of philately deposit-accountholders grew from 23,905 in 1999–2000 to 168,282 in 2006–2007 and 183,202 in 2008–2009. Four philatelic bureaux—the Bombay, Madras, Calcutta and Parliament Street, New Delhi GPOs are authorized to sell United Nations stamps. A quarterly philatelic magazine, &quot;Philapost&quot;, was launched in 2008.

The Department of Post has also developed software for philatelic inventory management, known as &quot;Philsim&quot;. It is used for all activities relating to philately, including forecasting, indenting, invoicing, monitoring supply and demand and recording sales and revenue for commemorative stamps and other philatelic products at philately bureaus and counters (and definitive stamps and stationery at circle stamp depots and head post offices).

The National Philatelic Museum was inaugurated on 6 July 1968 in New Delhi. It had its beginnings at a meeting of the Philatelic Advisory Committee on 18 September 1962. Besides a large collection of India Postage stamps designed, printed and issued, it has a large collection of Indian states (confederate and feudatory), early essays, proofs and colour trials, a collection of Indian stamps used abroad, early Indian postcards, postal stationery and thematic collections. The museum was renovated in 2009 with more exhibits, a philatelic bureau and postal objects (such as Victorian post boxes). The Department of Posts inaugurated the National Philatelic Museum on 11 July 2011. It exhibits rare postage stamps from around the world and provides a venue for philatelists to exhibit their collections.

===Army Postal Service===

The Army Postal Service (APS) functions as a government-operated military mail system in India. A primary feature of Army Postal Service systems is that normally they are subsidized to ensure that military mail posted between duty stations abroad and the home country (or vice versa) does not cost the sender any more than normal domestic mail traffic. In some cases, Indian military personnel in a combat zone may post letters and/or packages to the home country for free, while in others, senders located in a specific overseas area may send military mail to another military recipient, also located in the same overseas area, without charge.

===Electronic Indian Postal Order===
The Electronic Indian Postal Order (e-IPO) was introduced on 22 March 2013, initially only for citizens living abroad. The postal orders can be used for online payment of fees for access to information under the Right to Information Act, 2005. The service was expanded to include all Indian citizens on 14 February 2014.

===Postal Life insurance===
Postal Life Insurance (PLI) was introduced on 1 February 1884 with the express approval of the Secretary of State (for India) to Her Majesty, the Queen Empress of India. It was essentially a welfare scheme for the benefit of Postal employees in 1884 and later extended to the employees of Telegraph Department in 1888. In 1894, PLI extended insurance cover to female employees of P &amp; T Department at a time when no other insurance company covered female lives. It is the oldest life insurer in this country. There was over 6.4 million policies active as on 31 March 2015 with a sum assured of . Premium income of PLI for the year 2014-15 was . It was extended to all rural residents on 24 March 1995.

Policies for government employees include &quot;Santhosh&quot; (endowment assurance), &quot;Suraksha&quot; (whole-life assurance), &quot;Suvidha&quot; (convertible whole-life assurance), &quot;Sumangal&quot; (anticipated endowment policy) and &quot;Yugal Suraksha&quot; (joint life endowment assurance). India Post started Rural Postal Life Insurance (RPLI) for the rural public in 1995. RPLI plans include &quot;Gram Santosh&quot; (endowment assurance), &quot;Gram Suraksha&quot; (whole-life assurance), &quot;Gram Suvidha&quot; (convertible whole-life assurance), &quot;Gram Sumangal&quot; (anticipated endowment assurance) and &quot;Gram Priya&quot;.

===Postal savings===
The post office offers a number of savings plans, including recurring deposit accounts, Sukanya Samriddhi Account (SSA) is also known as Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (SSY), National Savings Certificates (&quot;NSC&quot;), Kisan Vikas Patra (KVP), the Public Provident Fund, savings-bank accounts, monthly-income plans, senior-citizens&#x27; savings plans and time-deposit accounts.

===Banking===

In 2013, it was revealed that the Indian postal service had formulated plans to enter the banking industry after RBI guidelines for the issuance of new banking licenses were released. Eventually they are planning to open a Post Bank of India, an independent banking service.

As of 29 February 2016, 18,231 post offices are utilizing Core Banking Solutions (CBS). ATMs are installed at 576 Post Office locations and debit cards issued to Post Office Savings Bank customers. Core Insurance Solution (CIS) for Postal Life Insurance (PLI) is rolled out in 808 head post offices and corresponding 24,000+ sub post offices. In September 2017, it was announced that by 2018 all of the 1.55 lakh post offices, every postman and &quot;grameen dak sevak&quot; (postmaster) will accept all payment options that the India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) plans to provide.

On 1 September 2018, the India Post Payments Bank was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

===Data collection===
A collaboration between the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation (MoSPI) and the Department of Posts has enabled the computation of consumer-price indices for rural areas. These statistics were previously unobtainable, due to problems of remoteness and scale. The agreement authorises the postal service to collect data on prices paid for selected consumer goods. In February 2011, MoSPI published its first Consumer Price Index (CPI) and All-India Consumer Price Index. The information has since been published monthly, based on data available from 1,181 villages across the country.

===E-commerce delivery===

The boom in e-commerce and the surging number of cash-on-delivery consignments has led India Post to partner with major e-commerce portals for delivering pre-paid as well as cash on delivery (COD) parcels. According to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology, Ravi Shankar Prasad, revenue of India Post from such deliveries would go up to in the year 2015–16.

<doc id="1094925" wikidata="Q946479" url="?curid=1094925" title="Minibus">
<text>A minibus, microbus, or minicoach is a passenger-carrying motor vehicle that is designed to carry more people than a multi-purpose vehicle or minivan, but fewer people than a full-size bus. In the United Kingdom, the word &quot;minibus&quot; is used to describe any full-sized passenger-carrying van or panel truck. Minibuses have a seating capacity of between 12 and 30. Larger minibuses may be called midibuses. Minibuses are typically front-engine step-in vehicles, although low floor minibuses are particularly common in Japan.

==History==
It is unknown when the first minibus vehicle was developed. For example, Ford Model T vehicles were modified for passenger transport by early bus companies and entrepreneurs. Ford produced a version during the 1920s to carry up to twelve people. 

In the Soviet Union, the production of minibuses began in the mid-1950s, among the first mass-produced minibuses were the RAF-10, UAZ-451B, and Start. Since September 1961, the RAF-977D &quot;Latvia&quot; minibus began to be mass-produced.

==Regional variants==

There are many different form of public transportation services around the world that are provided by using vehicles that can be considered as minibus:
*Angkot in Indonesia
*Bas Mini in Malaysia
*Chiva bus in Colombia and Ecuador
*Colectivo in southern South America
*Community bus (Japanese コミュニティバス &quot;komiunitibasu&quot;) in Japan (Include minibus and midibus)
*Dala dala in Tanzania
*Dollar van a.k.a. jitneys, in the United States.
* in Turkey
*Modern Jeepney in the Philippines
*Maeul-bus (Korean 마을버스) in South Korea
*Marshrutka in eastern Europe.
*Matatu around Kenya
*Minibus taxi in South Africa, Ethiopia, see also Taxi wars in South Africa
*Pesero, minibuses operating as regular buses in Mexico, especially in Mexico City.
*Public light buses, in Hong Kong.
*Sherut in Israel
*Songthaew around Thailand and Lao
*Tap tap in Haiti
*Tro tro around Ghana
*Weyala in Ethiopia

==Driving licence==
Some countries may require an additional class of driving licence over a normal private car licence, and some may require a full commercial driving licence. The need for such a licence may depend on:
*Vehicle weight or size
*Seating capacity
*Driver age
*Intended usage
*Additional training (such as the Minibus Driver Awareness Scheme in the UK)

In the UK: The holder of an ordinary car driving licence which was obtained prior to January 1997, once aged 21 years minimum, may drive a Minibus with a capacity of 16 passengers. Where the &quot;ordinary car driving licence&quot; is obtained after December 1996, they will have to take a separate test to drive a vehicle with a capacity of more than 8 passengers. However, there is an exemption for certain volunteer drivers, where the vehicle does not exceed 3500 kg GVW (or 4250 kg GVW if the vehicle is designed to be wheelchair accessible).

A driving licence issued in Ontario, Canada, for an equivalent of a UK class B or class B-auto driving licence (in the case of Ontario, a class G licence), allows its holder to drive vehicles with:
*11 tonnes maximum authorized mass, including trailers with 4.6 tonnes MAM 6 tonnes MAM in certain cases)
*passenger seating capacity of 9 or less

Anyone wanting to drive a vehicle in Ontario, with the same MAM limits as for class G vehicles, with fewer than 25, but at least 10, passenger seats, must obtain a bus licence. This will allow, for example, its holder to drive 12- and 15-passenger vans] that Transport Canada defines as large passenger vans.

<text>Samuel Bass (July 21, 1851 – July 21, 1878) was a 19th-century American train robber, outlaw, and outlaw gang leader. Notably, he was a member of a gang of six that robbed a Union Pacific train in Nebraska of $60,000 in newly minted gold from San Francisco, California. To date, this is the biggest train robbery to have been committed in the USA. He died as a result of wounds sustained in a gun battle with law enforcement officers.

==Early life==
Sam Bass was born in Mitchell, Indiana, on July 21, 1851; the son of Daniel and Elizabeth Jane (Sheeks) Bass. He was orphaned before his fourteenth birthday, and afterwards was raised by an abusive uncle. Bass left home due to this abuse at the age of 19.

Bass worked for about a year at a sawmill in Rosedale, Mississippi, but eventually drifted west to north Texas; where he worked for a time for Sheriff Egan of Denton. He tried his hand at wrangling cattle, but was unfulfilled by the hard work and low pay. Bass eventually bought a horse and raced it, living on the proceeds for some years. After the horse became too old to race, Bass and a partner, Joel Collins, formed a cattle drive for several ranchers in the San Antonio, Texas area, including Luther Bounds, who later financed operations for the infamous Fannie Porter. In 1876, they drove the cattle to Nebraska, but squandered their (and the ranchers&#x27;) proceeds by gambling it away in the gold rush town of Deadwood in the Black Hills area.

==Life of crime==
Now broke, Bass and Collins attempted to work as freighters, but were unable to make a living. The duo then formed an outlaw gang, preying primarily on stage coaches. They notably robbed the Union Pacific Railroad gold train from San Francisco on September 18, 1877, intercepting the train at Big Springs, Nebraska and robbing over $60,000 (equivalent to about $ million in 2022). The gang split up following this heist.

Bass returned to Texas and formed a new gang responsible for a string of stagecoach robberies. In 1878, the gang held up two stagecoaches and four trains within 25 miles (40 km) of Dallas. Although the robberies netted them little money, they became the object of a manhunt by Pinkerton National Detective Agency agents and a special company of the Texas Rangers headed by Captain Junius Peak.

==A trap is set==
Bass was able to elude the Texas Rangers until a member of his gang, Jim Murphy, turned informant. Mr. Murphy&#x27;s father, who was very ill at the time, had been taken into custody and held for questioning. He was not allowed to be seen by a doctor and was prevented from receiving medical treatment, which caused his condition to rapidly worsen. Lawmen sent a message to Murphy informing him that they had his father in custody, and that if Murphy did not agree to meet with them, they would continue to withhold medical treatment from the father. Knowing how sick his father was, Murphy agreed to the meeting. There, he reluctantly agreed to turn informant. John B. Jones was subsequently notified of Bass&#x27;s movements and set up an ambush at Round Rock, Texas, where Bass and the gang planned to rob the Williamson County Bank.

==Final shootout==
On July 19, 1878, Bass and his gang were scouting the area before the robbery. When they bought some tobacco at a store, they were noticed by Williamson County Deputy Sheriff A. W. Grimes. When Grimes approached the men to request that they surrender their sidearms, he was shot and killed. A gunfight ensued. As Bass attempted to flee, he was shot by Texas Rangers agents George Herold and Sergeant Richard Ware. Soapy Smith and his cousin, Edwin, witnessed Ware&#x27;s shot. Soapy exclaimed, &quot;I think you got him!&quot; No one residing in Round Rock, and none of the visiting Texas Rangers (except Jim Murphy), knew what any of the Bass gang looked like. In fact, after Seaborne Barnes was killed and lay on the street, Ware had to have Murphy identify the body, as no one else knew who the man was. Ware himself stated that he had seen the same three men earlier in town crossing the street to enter the dry goods store, but in fact did not recognize them as the Bass gang.

==Death==
Bass was later found lying in a pasture west of Round Rock by Williamson County Deputy James Milton Tucker. More specifically, Bass had to call out to the posse as they were about to ride by him, shouting, &quot;Hey I&#x27;m over here. I&#x27;m Sam Bass, the one you are looking for.&quot; He was taken into custody and died the next day on July 21, 1878, his 27th birthday. No photograph was taken of Bass either while he was dying in town under a doctor&#x27;s care or after he died, even though the Texas Rangers were under tremendous pressure from Austin politicians to capture or kill him. To this day no known photo has ever been confirmed to be of Bass, and when his sister visited Round Rock a year after his death to place a better headstone, she indicated that the photo on the wanted poster shown to her by the Williamson County Sheriff was not of her brother. Bass was buried in Round Rock in what is now known as Round Rock Cemetery. His grave is now marked with a replacement headstone—as the original suffered at the hands of souvenir collectors over the years. What remains of the original stone is on display at the Round Rock Public Library.

==Legacy==
There are roads named after Bass in Round Rock, Texas, Denton, Texas and west of Sanger, Texas. During Round Rock&#x27;s annual &quot;Frontier Days&quot; celebration, performers re-enact the shootout in the old downtown.

Rosston, Texas celebrates Sam Bass Day annually on the third Saturday in July.

There is also the Sam Bass Fire Department of Brushy Creek in Round Rock, TX Williamson County.

==Dramatic representations==
Bass has since been portrayed in several books, radio programs, television shows, and movies.
* In a 1936 episode on the syndicated radio drama &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, Bass&#x27;s last days are portrayed.
*&quot;Calamity Jane and Sam Bass&quot; is a 1949 American Western film directed by George Sherman and starring Yvonne De Carlo, Howard Duff and Dorothy Hart.
*In a 1951 Western movie &quot;The Texas Rangers&quot;, Sam Bass is played by William Bishop.
*In 1953, Sam Bass was the antagonist in a newspaper daily strip story about Laredo Crockett by Bob Schoenke.
*1957 &quot;Tales of Wells Fargo&quot; Season 1 Episode 10; Main Character Jim Hardie is ordered to infiltrate Sam Bass&#x27; gang so that he can learn where they hole up between raids. Sam Bass is played by Chuck Connors. Michael Landon plays a young man in this episode. 
*A &quot;Lone Ranger&quot; episode about Sam Bass was broadcast on April 24, 1944, taking great liberties with the facts.
*In 1959, Alan Hale Jr. played Bass in the episode &quot;The Saga of Sam Bass&quot;, on the ABC/Warner Bros. western television series &quot;Colt .45&quot;.
*The 2015 Western movie &quot;Kill or Be Killed&quot; was loosely inspired by outlaw Sam Bass and his gang.

<text>USS &quot;Upshur&quot; (DD–144) was a in the United States Navy before and during World War II. She was the first ship named for Rear Admiral John Henry Upshur.

&quot;Upshur&quot; was laid down on 19 February 1918 at Philadelphia by William Cramp &amp; Sons&#x27; shipyards. The ship is launched on 4 July 1918, sponsored by Mrs. Alexander Gustavus Brown, the granddaughter of Rear Admiral Upshur. The destroyer commissioned at the Philadelphia Navy Yard on 23 December 1918.

==Service history==

===1919–1922===
Following shakedown and fitting out, &quot;Upshur&quot; departed Newport, Rhode Island, on 20 May 1919, bound via the Azores for north European waters. She arrived at Devonport, England, on 16 June and shifted to Harwich two days later before subsequently calling at Heligoland, Germany; Copenhagen, Denmark; and the free city of Danzig. She eventually returned, via Harwich and Ponta Delgada, to the United States, arriving at New York City on 22 July.

Assigned to the Pacific Fleet soon thereafter, &quot;Upshur&quot; transited the Panama Canal, bound for San Diego, her base of operations until the spring of the following year. During her time at San Diego, the ship conducted gunnery and torpedo training and local coastal operations. In April 1920, &quot;Upshur&quot; got underway and proceeded via Honolulu, Pearl Harbor, Midway, and Guam to the Far East, arriving at Cavite, in the Philippines, on 20 May. She soon sailed for duty on the lower Yangtze River as part of the Yangtze River Patrol.

At Yueyang on 16 June, troops of warlord Zhang Jingyao executed American missionary, William A. Reimert. At Hankou when the incident occurred, &quot;Upshur&quot;, acting under urgent orders, got underway for the trouble spot on 22 June—departing with such great haste that four of her complement (one officer and three enlisted men) were left behind. Arriving at Yueyang on 23 June, &quot;Upshur&quot; sent ashore a landing party of one officer and 40 men at 1805 on 25 June to protect the American mission. Two days later—when local tensions had eased—they were reembarked.

The Standard Oil Company&#x27;s steamer &quot;Mei Foo&quot; arrived at Yueyang on 28 June and delivered 100 bags of rice for refugees in the vicinity. Over the ensuing days, &quot;Upshur&quot; delivered that food staple to the American mission. In the meantime, the Commander in Chief, Asiatic Fleet, Admiral Albert Cleaves, arrived at Yueyang in to observe the local situation. Eventually, the offending Chinese official in charge, Zhang Jingyao, was removed, and the Chinese foreign office, while investigating the incident, expressed its profound regrets.

&quot;Upshur&quot; remained on the Yangtze until 9 July, when she resumed routine operations—target practices and torpedo drills. For her tour on the river, the destroyer received commendation in the Secretary of the Navy&#x27;s annual report, noted as being &quot;especially serviceable in establishing radio communication along the river.&quot;

&quot;Upshur&quot; conducted exercises in the Philippine Islands in the winter and in Chinese waters, off Yantai, in the summer, with more training and &quot;showing the flag&quot; cruises in between. During her tour in the Asiatic Fleet, &quot;Upshur&quot; was reclassified DD-144 on 17 July 1920. After completing her assignment in the Far East early in 1922, the destroyer arrived back on the west coast in the spring and was decommissioned at San Diego on 15 May 1922 and placed in reserve.

===1923–1941===
Recommissioned on 2 June 1930, &quot;Upshur&quot; operated with the Battle Fleet and Scouting Force, first on the west coast and later on the east, until decommissioned on 22 December 1936 at Philadelphia. She was berthed in the Philadelphia Navy Yard until the autumn of 1939.

Soon after the outbreak of World War II in Poland in September 1939, President Roosevelt declared the neutrality of the United States and ordered the establishment of a Neutrality Patrol off the eastern seaboard and gulf coast on 5 September. To augment the ships first assigned to this duty, the Navy began reactivation of 77 light minelayers and destroyers. Accordingly, &quot;Upshur&quot; went back into commission at Philadelphia on 4 October, a little over a month after Germany invaded Poland. Attached to the Atlantic Squadron of the United States Fleet, &quot;Upshur&quot; interspersed her routine training evolutions—battle practices, torpedo exercises, and tactical maneuvers—with patrols safeguarding America&#x27;s neutral shores along the Atlantic and gulf coasts.

&quot;Upshur&quot;″s routine was broken briefly in December 1939. On 13 December, the North German Norddeutscher Lloyd steamship &quot;Columbus&quot; slipped out of Veracruz, Mexico, in an attempt to reach Germany and slip through the British blockade. She had not reckoned with the Neutrality Patrol, however, that persistently shadowed the liner from the moment she stood out of the Mexican port. &quot;Upshur&quot; participated in the tracking and reporting of the steamer, the 13th largest merchant steamship in the world. &quot;Columbus&quot; ultimately met her doom on 19 December; she was scuttled when confronted by British destroyer . The cruiser , standing nearby, rescued the &quot;Columbus&quot; crew.

The rapid fall of France in early 1940 caused alarm in the western hemisphere that French possessions in the West Indies might fall into German hands. American planners drew up contingency plans to take these isles by force if necessary. In the event of such an invasion, &quot;Upshur&quot; and her sisters in Destroyer Squadron 30 were slated to screen the counter-battery and gunfire support group built around , , and . The crisis abated by late 1940.

In between the routine neutrality patrol assignments and training, &quot;Upshur&quot; was called upon to perform a special escort mission. On 23 December 1940, the heavy cruiser &quot;Tuscaloosa&quot; departed Norfolk with William D. Leahy, Ambassador to Vichy France, and his wife, embarked, bound for Lisbon, Portugal. &quot;Upshur&quot; and escorted the heavy cruiser, until they were detached on Christmas Day to return to Norfolk while the cruiser proceeded on, unescorted, on her diplomatic mission.

In March 1941, the Support Force was established for the United States Fleet, under the command of Rear Admiral Arthur L. Bristol. Based at Narragansett Bay, this group prepared for assignment to &quot;distant seas&quot; and was formed around , , , and . Four patrol plane squadrons and three destroyer squadrons—the last including &quot;Upshur&quot;—rounded out the Support Force.

Over the ensuing months, &quot;Upshur&quot; operated alternately out of Naval Station Argentia, Newfoundland; Newport, Rhode Island; Philadelphia; Narragansett Bay; Boston; and Reykjavík, Iceland, after its occupation by the United States that summer. On 11 September, the destroyer departed Argentia, bound for a rendezvous with an outward-bound convoy headed for the British Isles.

Five days later HX 150, a convoy of 50 merchantmen of British and Allied nationalities put to sea from Halifax, Nova Scotia, escorted locally by Canadian units. On 17 September, about out of Argentia, the American escort group under Captain Morton L. Deyo, which included &quot;Upshur&quot;, met up with the British convoy. The ensuing days witnessed the five American destroyers shepherding the convoy towards the &quot;Mid-Ocean Meeting Point&quot; (MOMP). &quot;Upshur&quot; steamed on the port side of the convoy, out, searching with her sound equipment on a 30-degree sector during the day, and patrolling out at night. The Americans brought the convoy safely to the MOMP, where British ships— two destroyers and four corvettes—picked up the England-bound ships. The five American destroyers then convoyed the Iceland-bound section of the convoy to Reykjavík. This convoy was the first one assisted by the United States Navy in the Battle of the Atlantic.

This mission proved to be only the beginning of American escort operations prior to the formal entry of the United States into World War II, as ships of the Support Force escorted 14 convoys between 16 September and 30 October. As the months wore on, clashes of American warships with German submarines grew in frequency and intensity. was damaged by a German torpedo on 17 October, and suffered a similar fate on the 30th. The next day, was sunk by the . Over the ensuing period from 1 November to 7 December 1941, Support Force destroyers conducted seven round-trip convoy missions in shepherding 14 convoys consisting of some 550 ships across the North Atlantic.

===World War II===
In the period following full-scale American entry into the war with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 and until the middle of February 1942, Support Force destroyers escorted a dozen convoys in each direction across the Atlantic—750 ships—in comparative safety.

On the night of 4 February 1942, &quot;Upshur&quot; departed Londonderry Port, Northern Ireland, in company with , , , and the United States Coast Guard cutter . Throughout the day on 5 February, the ships hunted a U-boat whose intentions seemed to be to follow the Americans to their outbound convoy assignment. Seven times the destroyers and the Coast Guard cutter attacked the submarine, dropping 30 depth charges, but could not &quot;kill&quot; the elusive submersible.

After rendezvousing with Convoy ON 63 on the morning of 7 February, the escorts shaped a course southwest with the 30 merchant vessels, shepherding them along in the wintry seas. &quot;Upshur&quot;″s lookouts spotted a U-boat running on the surface two miles (3 km) away and gave chase, but the German lookouts were alert, and the submarine submerged before &quot;Upshur&quot; could attack.

For two hours, &quot;Upshur&quot; and &quot;Ingham&quot; scoured the area, dropping 15 depth charges before they returned to their stations. &quot;Upshur&quot; had no sooner returned to station when she again spotted the U-boat away. Accelerating to flank speed, the flush-decker headed towards the enemy, only to have the U-boat submerge out of sight once more. &quot;Upshur&quot; fired two rounds from her forward gun—both shells splashing around the enemy&#x27;s disappearing conning tower. &quot;Gleaves&quot; soon arrived on the scene and assisted &quot;Upshur&quot; in searching for the U-boat. Neither ship was able to make contact with the enemy that day nor the next, but they succeeded in preventing the German submersible from making contact with the convoy and managed to bring all of their charges safely into port.

Over the ensuing two years, &quot;Upshur&quot; operated on convoy escort missions with the Atlantic Fleet. Her duties took her from the eastern seaboard of the United States to the mouth of the Mediterranean Sea, from the inhospitable climes of the North Atlantic to the tropical Caribbean.

===Convoys escorted===
==Auxiliary service==
As the Allies slowly gained the upper hand in the Battle of the Atlantic, newer and more modern destroyers replaced the aging flush-deckers as front line convoy escorts. Throughout 1944, &quot;Upshur&quot; operated between Norfolk, Virginia, and Quonset Point, Rhode Island, serving as plane guard and target vessel during qualification trials for aircraft carriers. During this period, she worked successively with , , , , , , , and . Reclassified as a miscellaneous auxiliary, AG-103 on 3 June 1945, &quot;Upshur&quot; was plane-guarding for when Japan capitulated on 15 August, ending the war in the Pacific. Decommissioned at Norfolk, Virginia, on 2 November 1945, &quot;Upshur&quot; was struck from the Navy list on 11 November; was sold to the Northern Metals Company of Philadelphia on 26 September 1947; and was scrapped by April 1948.

<text>Francis John Tovey (8 September 1956 – 3 April 2002), known also by his stage name Fad Gadget, was a British avant-garde electronic musician and vocalist. He was a proponent of both new wave and early industrial music, fusing pop-structured songs with mechanised experimentation.

As Fad Gadget, his music was characterised by the use of synthesizers in conjunction with sounds of found objects, including drills and electric razors. His bleak, sarcastic and darkly humorous lyrics were filled with biting social commentary toward subjects such as machinery, industrialisation, consumerism, human sexuality, mass media, religion, domestic violence and dehumanization, often sung in a deadpan voice.

==Early years==
As a child, Frank Tovey lived in Bow. His father, Frank Tovey, Sr. was a porter in Billingsgate Fish Market.
At school, Francis tried to learn many different musical instruments. He realised he did not have the co-ordination to be able to play any of them really well. Tovey drifted away from the idea of playing music, and began getting involved in other art forms instead. He later studied visual arts and mime at Leeds Polytechnic. He felt the need to give his mime act some sort of musical accompaniment so he went back to the idea of recording music. The initial musical pieces were formed of sound manipulation using tape recorders.

Tovey began experimenting using an old Grundig tape recorder. He disconnected the erase head from the playback head and installed a simple switch between the two. This gave him control over what sounds could be erased or kept. He spent a lot of time building up sound collages using this method. After finishing full-time education Tovey began working at various jobs and around the mid seventies managed to set up his own home studio. At the time he was living in London, in a small house. The only space where he could set up his studio was in a cupboard. The initial equipment he used consisted mainly of his Grundig tape recorder. At this time he was using no musical instrument at all. The first keyboard instrument he owned was a Crumar Compac electric piano. He also bought a Korg Minipops drum machine from a home organ shop. He eventually decided to purchase a Korg synthesiser. He thought that due to his lack of musical ability he would be able to create some impressive sounds. After the purchase of this equipment he began writing music seriously; it was at this time he sent a demo tape of &quot;Back to Nature&quot; to Daniel Miller, who had just released his first single as The Normal.

==Signing to Mute Records==
Frank Tovey signed as Fad Gadget to Daniel Miller&#x27;s Mute Records. He was the first artist to sign to Mute. &quot;Back to Nature&quot; was recorded as the second Mute Records release at RMS Studio in London. At the time RMS was an eight track studio. Gadget had no real experience of recording within a studio environment, so he left most of the decision making to Daniel Miller. Most of the recorded instruments on &quot;Back to Nature&quot; belonged to Tovey, although he used equipment belonging to Miller as well; this included an ARP 2600 synthesiser.

&quot;Back to Nature&quot; was a great success for Mute Records so a follow-up record was produced; the follow-up was titled &quot;Ricky&#x27;s Hand&quot;. The recording included Gadget&#x27;s wife, Barbara, singing a vocal part near the end of the recording; the vocal part is then mixed with a synthesiser part into the outro of the song. Fad Gadget then went on to record an album for Mute Records. &quot;Fireside Favourites&quot; was recorded at Blackwing Studios in London. He decided to record the album without Daniel Miller&#x27;s assistance.

Gadget felt it was important that he made all the decisions about recording the album himself. Gadget also felt the ideas and concepts behind his live performances were just as important. His live appearances progressed to dressing in theatrical costumes, reflecting back to his days studying visual arts, and he quickly became known for his confrontational stage antics. Some of these included covering himself in tar and feathers, swinging his microphone like a whip, leaping backwards into the audience, dancing across bar tables while kicking over people&#x27;s drinks, climbing up speakers, hanging from ceiling fixtures, pulling out his body hair and playing instruments with his head, often ending up in personal injury. Gadget was particularly infamous for spreading shaving cream on his naked body onstage, an image of which is depicted on the cover of &quot;The Best of Fad Gadget&quot;. &quot;Sounds&quot; magazine described him as &quot;...the bumbling but talented Dr Who of electro-pop&quot;. In 1981 Gadget released another one-off single on Mute Records, &quot;Make Room&quot;, featuring the b-side &quot;Lady Shave&quot;, which went on to become &quot;one of his most iconic tracks&quot;.

==Recording==
Fad Gadget recorded two more albums for Mute Records at Blackwing Studios which was using more complex recording equipment. &quot;Incontinent&quot; and &quot;Under the Flag&quot; showed a progressive change in Gadget&#x27;s music; due both to the technological advances and his own growing knowledge of recording techniques. It was during the recording of &quot;Under the Flag&quot; that he began using the Roland MC-4 Microcomposer. This made it easy for Tovey to create a more controlled style of music. This style was carried on with the recording of the album &quot;Gag&quot;.

The recording of &quot;Gag&quot; was a turning point in Gadget&#x27;s recording career. It would be the first time he used a band of musicians to record an album; before he had recorded most of the musical parts himself. It would also see a major change in the recording location from London to Hansa Tonstudio in Berlin. He had wanted a break from the way he had been recording in London. The acoustic spaces in the German studio had excited Gadget. He was also excited about the recording equipment that was installed at Hansa at that time, including the computer controlled mixing desk. He found the new recording practices refreshing, having other people collaborating in the writing and recording process. Some of these collaborators included the viola player, Joni Sackett, and keyboard player, David Simmonds. The recordings included many acoustic instruments, which veered away from the electronic instruments which had been used on previous recording sessions. Fad Gadget had used synthesisers when they were not fashionable to use – he had now moved away from electronic instrumentation when it was the current trend with other recording artists.

During the recording of &quot;Gag&quot; the German industrial band, Einstürzende Neubauten, were recording for Some Bizzare Records at Hansa and had been the support act for Fad Gadget at a gig at &quot;The Loft&quot; venue in Berlin. Frank liked their use of industrial equipment and found objects, something he had encouraged Nick Cash (his drummer and percussionist since his first album) to do. Fad Gadget heard a large printing press nearby which had a distinctive rhythm and got Gareth Jones, the co-producer/engineer, to record it. The recording was looped and became the basis for &quot;Collapsing New People.&quot; (Einstürzende Neubauten translated means, &quot;collapsing new buildings.&quot;) The sample was used firstly on two tracks on Fad Gadget&#x27;s &quot;Collapsing New People&quot; 12&quot; released November 1983. All these recordings were engineered by Gareth Jones and the sample used was stored on his Akai sampler with Cash drumming along and keeping the swing of the machine. Gadget then thought it would be good to ask Neubauten if they would add some of their percussion noise to the mix; however, Frank thought there was enough going on in the track and their contribution was used on the b-side &quot;Spoil The Child&quot; and on the 12&quot; mix of the song. Neubauten&#x27;s percussion was overdubbed over the already recorded backing tracks. The percussion tracks proved difficult to mix at the final stage, but Gadget was pleased with the final result. The track &quot;Collapsing New People&quot; was released as a single by Mute Records.

After recording the album &quot;Gag&quot;, Gadget began recording under his real name – Frank Tovey. He carried on moving toward acoustic instruments and in 1984 had decided he might want to record on his own again. He recorded several LPs of more experimental work under the name Frank Tovey, beginning with &quot;Easy Listening for the Hard of Hearing&quot;, a collaboration with Boyd Rice recorded in 1981.

In 1989, he changed musical tactics in his criticism of industrialisation, recording a mostly acoustic album of protest and labour songs &quot;Tyranny and the Hired Hand&quot; including such standards as &quot;Sixteen Tons&quot;. He then tried his hand at writing similar material, recorded two more albums with a backing band named The Pyros. After touring in 1993, Gadget withdrew from the music business.

==Final years==
In his later years, Gadget began to perform at festivals and also supported his former colleagues and Mute label-mates, Depeche Mode, on their European tour. He was working on a new album at the time of his death. Fad Gadget suffered from heart problems since childhood, and died of a heart attack on 3 April 2002 at the age of 45. In 2006, with the Pyros and family, he has two movies dedicated to him, &quot;Fad Gadget by Frank Tovey&quot; and &quot;Grand Union: A Documentary&quot;.

==Legacy and influence==
Despite a lack of commercial success, Fad Gadget is regarded as a pioneer in synth-pop, electro and industrial music. He influenced bands and artists such as Depeche Mode, Vince Clarke (of Erasure), Boy George (of Culture Club), Information Society, cEvin Key (of Skinny Puppy), Liars, The Twilight Sad, and DJ Premier. EBM band Suicide Commando also credit him with influencing their sound in an interview with journalist Ramona Depares.

John Frusciante (of the Red Hot Chili Peppers) listed Fad Gadget&#x27;s &quot;Under the Flag&quot; in his top 40 favorite albums of all time.

Industrial metal band Ministry recorded a cover of the song &quot;Ricky&#x27;s Hand&quot; on their 2024 album &quot;Hopiumforthemasses&quot;.

His album &quot;Gag&quot; was ranked #76 in Treblezine&#x27;s list of &quot;The Top 100 Best Post-Punk Albums&quot;.

<text>The Diary of Samuel Marchbanks, published by Clarke, Irwin in 1947, is the first of the Samuel Marchbanks books by Canadian novelist and journalist Robertson Davies. The other two books in this series are &quot;The Table Talk of Samuel Marchbanks&quot; (1949) and &quot;Samuel Marchbanks&#x27; Almanack&quot; (1967).

Davies created the Samuel Marchbanks character while editor of the &quot;Peterborough Examiner&quot; newspaper in the small city of Peterborough, Ontario, northeast of Toronto. He wrote the first column under the Marchbanks pseudonym in 1944.

&quot;The Diary of Samuel Marchbanks&quot; presents a year&#x27;s worth of Marchbanks&#x27; columns in a diary format. For this book Davies chose the best columns from 1945 and 1946 and added a few new pieces.

Davies&#x27; writings as Samuel Marchbanks were also collected in a one-volume edition, &quot;The Papers of Samuel Marchbanks&quot; in 1985.

<doc id="1094946" wikidata="Q1987140" url="?curid=1094946" title="I Ching divination">
<text>&quot;I Ching&quot; divination is a form of cleromancy applied to the &quot;I Ching&quot;. The text of the &quot;I Ching&quot; consists of sixty-four hexagrams: six-line figures of &quot;yin&quot; (broken) or &quot;yang&quot; (solid) lines, and commentaries on them. There are two main methods of building up the lines of the hexagram, using either 50 yarrow stalks or three coins. Some of the lines may be designated &quot;old&quot; lines, in which case the lines are subsequently changed to create a second hexagram. The text relating to the hexagram(s) and old lines (if any) is studied, and the meanings derived from such study can be interpreted as an oracle.

== Methods ==
Each hexagram is six lines, written sequentially one above the other; each of the lines represents a state that is either &quot;yin&quot; ( : dark, feminine, &quot;etc.&quot;, represented by a broken line) or &quot;yang&quot; ( : light, masculine, &quot;etc.&quot;, a solid line), and either &quot;old&quot; (moving or changing, represented by an &quot;X&quot; written on the middle of a &quot;yin&quot; line, or a circle written on the middle of a &quot;yang&quot; line) or &quot;young&quot; (static, unchanging). The usual methods for consulting the &quot;I Ching&quot; as an oracle produce a &quot;sacred&quot; or &quot;ritual&quot; number for each type of line: 6 (for an old &quot;yin&quot; line), 7 (young &quot;yang&quot;), 8 (young &quot;yin&quot;), or 9 (old &quot;yang&quot;). The six lines are produced in order using the chosen method (see below for examples), beginning at the first (lowest) one and proceeding upward to the sixth (uppermost) line, each with its corresponding number. Then, the commentaries applying to the generated hexagram are studied; if the hexagram contains no old lines at all, that concludes the consultation, but if there are one or more old lines, the separate commentary for each such line is also studied. Then, the lines are appropriately changed (any old &quot;yin&quot; lines into young &quot;yang&quot; lines, and any old &quot;yang&quot; lines into young &quot;yin&quot; lines), which—with the young lines in the original hexagram remaining the same—results in a second, different, hexagram, the commentarial material on which is then also studied.

The method used by the diviner to generate the hexagram(s) depends on their circumstances and beliefs; the yarrow-stalk method is usually employed by traditionalists who find significance in its complexity, and in the resulting time needed to manipulate the stalks to produce a hexagram. Coin methods, and others, are used either by those short of time, or by fortune-tellers who need a quick reading. There are also methods to generate a hexagram by interpreting the time, direction, person, &quot;etc.&quot;, instead of throwing coins or dividing and counting yarrow stalks.
Several of the methods described below &quot;force&quot; exactly one, or no, moving lines; the traditional yarrow-stalk method allows from zero to six moving lines. The yarrow-stalk method favours static lines over moving lines in the ratio 3:1.

=== Precursor to &quot;I Ching&quot;: Cracks in turtle shell ===
Plastromancy or the turtle-shell oracle is probably the earliest recorded form of fortune telling. The diviner would apply heat to a piece of a turtle shell (sometimes with a hot poker), and interpret the resulting cracks. The cracks were sometimes annotated with inscriptions, the oldest Chinese writings that have been discovered. This oracle predated the earliest versions of the &quot;Zhou Yi&quot; (dated from about 1100 BC) by hundreds of years.

A variant on this method was to use ox shoulder bones, a practice called scapulimancy. When thick material was to be cracked, the underside was thinned by carving with a knife.

=== Yarrow stalks ===
Hexagrams may be generated by the manipulation of yarrow stalks. These are usually genuine &quot;Achillea millefolium&quot; stalks that have been cut and prepared for such purposes, or any form of wooden rod or sticks (the quality ranging from cheap hardwood to very expensive red sandalwood, &quot;etc.&quot;) which are plain, lacquered, or varnished. When genuine &quot;Achillea&quot; is used, varieties local to the diviner are considered the best, as they would contain &quot;qi&quot; closer to, and more in tune with, the diviner, or they may come from a particularly spiritual or relevant place, such as on the grounds of a Confucian temple. When not in use, they are kept in a cloth or silk bag/pouch or a wooden case/box.

Fifty yarrow stalks are used, though one stalk is set aside at the beginning and takes no further part in the process of consultation. The remaining forty-nine stalks are roughly sorted into two piles, and then for the right hand pile one stalk is initially &quot;remaindered&quot;; then the pile is &quot;cast off&quot; in lots of four (&quot;i.e.&quot;, groups of four stalks are removed). The remainders from each half are combined (traditionally placed between the fingers of one hand during the counting process) and set aside, with the process then repeated twice (&quot;i.e.&quot;, for a total of three times). The total number of stalks in the remainder pile will necessarily (if the procedure has been followed correctly) be 9 or 5, in the first count, and 8 or 4, in the second. 9 or 8 is assigned a value of 2; 5 or 4, a value of 3. The total of the three passes will be one of just four values: 6 (2+2+2), 7 (2+2+3), 8 (2+3+3), or 9 (3+3+3)—that value is the number of the first line.
The forty-nine stalks are then gathered and the entire procedure repeated to generate each of the remaining five lines of the hexagram.

The yarrow-stalk method produces unequal probabilities for obtaining each of the four totals, as shown in the table. Compared to the three-coin method discussed next, the probabilities of the lines produced by the yarrow-stalk method are significantly different.

Note that the Yarrow algorithm is a particular algorithm for generating random numbers; while it is named after the yarrow-stalk method of consulting the &quot;I Ching&quot;, its details are unrelated to it.

=== Coins ===

==== Three-coin method ====
The three-coin method came into use over a thousand years after the yarrow-stalk method. The quickest, easiest, and most popular method by far, it has largely supplanted yarrow stalks, but produces outcomes with different likelihoods. Three coins are tossed at once; each coin is given a value of 2 or 3, depending upon whether it is heads or tails, respectively. Six such tosses make the hexagram. Some fortune-tellers use an empty tortoise shell to shake the coins in before throwing them on a dish or plate.

==== Modified Three-coin method ====
The three-coin method can be modified to have the same probabilities as the yarrow-stalk method by having one of the coins be of a second coin type, or in some way be marked as special (i.e., be distinguishable from the other coins). All three coins are tossed at once. The results are counted just as in the original three-coin method, with two exceptions: one to make &quot;yin&quot; less likely to move, and one to make &quot;yang&quot; more likely to move. (The probability for 6/8/9/7 in the coin method is 2/6/2/6, but in the yarrow-stalk method is 1/7/3/5; hence, 6 has to occur less often, and 9 has to occur more often.)

In the case where the special coin is tails and the other two are both tails—which would normally produce a 6—re-flip the marked coin: if it remains tails, then it remains a 6 (moving &quot;yin&quot;); otherwise, treat it as an 8 (static &quot;yin&quot;). As a 6 can become a 6 or an 8, it reduces the probability of the moving 6. In other words, it makes the old &quot;yin&quot; less likely to change (or move).

In the case where the special coin is heads and the other two are both tails—which would normally produce a 7—re-flip the marked coin: if it remains heads, then it remains as a 7 (static &quot;yang&quot;); otherwise, it becomes a 9 (moving &quot;yang&quot;). As a 7 can become a 7 or an 9, it reduces the probability of the static 7. In other words, it makes the young &quot;yang&quot; less likely and hence more &quot;yang&quot;s change as a result.

This method retains the 50% chance of yin:yang, but changes the ratio of moving &quot;yin&quot; to static &quot;yin&quot; from 1:3 to 1:7; likewise, it changes the ratio of moving &quot;yang&quot; to static &quot;yang&quot; from 1:3 to 3:5, which is the same probabilities as the yarrow-stalk method.

==== Two-coin method ====

Some purists contend that there is a problem with the three-coin method because its probabilities differ from the more ancient, yarrow-stalk, method. In fact, over the centuries there have even been other methods used for consulting the oracle.

The two-coin method involves tossing one pair of coins &quot;twice&quot;: on the first toss, two heads give a value of 2, and anything else is 3; on the second toss, each coin is valued separately, to give a sum from 6 to 9, as above. This results in the same distribution of probabilities as for the yarrow-stalk method.

==== Simplified two-coin method ====

A modified version of the two-coin method improves on the original on several aspects. First, while maintaining the probabilities of the traditional yarrow-stalk method, it simplifies outcomes such that they become intuitive at first sight, without need of further calculations. Second, it reduces the average number of coin throws per hexagram by 25%, from 12 to 9. It does so by requiring to throw the coins a second time only if both coins land on the same face (either both heads, or both tails), thus only in 50% of instances. Third, it is easy to memorize, as it clearly identifies heads with yang, and tails with yin, and a greater share of heads/tails with old (aka mature, moving, changing) yang/yin.

The modified two-coin method involves tossing one pair of coins of different size or shape. The larger, or heavier coin is assigned primacy (and is reported here as first, dominant, outcome) while the outcome of the smaller one comes second. Let H be heads and T tails.

If the coins land H, T, yang dominates and the outcome is young yang, unchanging. There is no need to throw the coins again for the same line.

If the coins land T, H, then yin dominates and the outcome is young yin, unchanging. Again, there is no need to throw the coins again for the same line.

If the coins land both on heads (H, H) then the outcome is for sure yang, but one must throw again to verify if the yang is changing (aka old) or unchanging (young). In case the second throw yields at least one H (either H, H, or H, T, or T, H), then the yang is changing. If both coins land on T (T, T) at second throw then the yang is unchanging.

If the coins land both on tails (T, T) then the outcome is for sure yin, but one must throw again to verify if the yin is changing or unchanging. In case the second throw yields both tails (T, T), then the yin is changing. If any of the two coins lands on H (either H, T, or T, H, or H, H) at second throw then the yin is unchanging.

The modified two-coin method yields old yang (changing) 3/16 of the times. Unchanging yang 5/16 times, and unchanging yin 7/16. The remaining 1/16 outcomes is old yin (changing).

It is considered simplified as it reduces the number of throws and calculations needed to correctly identify the outcome of each hexagram line, compared to any other method. While this has its advantages, some purists consider the time required to build the hexagram as a fundamental aspect of I Ching divination, for its ceremonial as well as introspective purposes. This said, any other coin based method can be considered similarly lacking on this regard, when compared to the yarrow-stalk method.

As is the case for the conventional two-coin method and the four coin method, the simplified two-coin method can be boiled down to binary numbers, simply interpreting any H as 1 and any T as 0. Then, old yin takes value of 0000 (0 in decimal numbers), unchanging yin values between 0001 and 0111 (1 to 7), unchanging yang those between 1000 and 1100 (8 to 12), and old yang from 1101 to 1111 (13 to 15). This also clearly showcases the relative probabilities of each outcome.

==== Four coins ====

With tails assigned the value 0 (zero) and heads the value 1, four coins tossed at once can be used to generate a four-bit binary number, the right-most coin indicating the first bit, the next coin (to the first&#x27;s left) indicating the next bit, etc. The number 0000 is called &quot;old yin&quot;; the next three numbers—0001, 0010, and 0011 (the binary numbers whose decimal equivalents are 1, 2, and 3, respectively)—are called &quot;old yang&quot;, with a similar principle applied to the remaining twelve outcomes. This gives identical results to the yarrow-stalk method.



The two-coin method described above can be performed with four coins, simply by having one pair of coins be alike—of the same size or denomination—while the other two are of a different size or denomination; the larger coins can then be counted as the first toss, while the two smaller coins constitute the second toss (or &quot;vice versa&quot;).

==== Six coins ====

Six coins—five identical coins and one different—can be thrown at once. The coin that lands closest to a line drawn on the table will make the first line of the hexagram, and so on: heads for yang, tails for yin. The distinct coin is a moving line. This method has the dual failings that (1) it forces every hexagram to be a changing hexagram, and (2) it only ever allows exactly one line to be changing.

==== Eight coins on Ba Qian ====
Eight coins, one marked, are tossed at once. They are picked up in order and placed onto a Bagua diagram; the marked coin rests on the lower trigram. The eight process is repeated for the upper trigram. After a third toss, the first six coins are placed on the hexagram to mark a moving line. This has the deficiency or allowing at most one moving line, whereas all six lines could be moving in traditional methods.

=== Dice ===
Any dice with an even number of faces can also be used in the same fashion as the coin tosses, with even die rolls for heads and odd for tails. An eight-sided die (d8) can be used to simulate the chances of a line being an old moving line equivalent to the yarrow-stalk method. For example, because the chances of any &quot;yin&quot; line or any &quot;yang&quot; line are equal in the yarrow-stalk method, there is a one-in-eight chance of getting any basic trigram, the same chance held under the &quot;ba qian&quot; method, so the &quot;ba qian&quot; method can be used to determine the basic hexagram. The d8 can then be used by rolling it once for each line to determine moving lines. A result of 1 on a &quot;yin&quot; line, or 3 or less on a &quot;yang&quot; line, will make that line a moving line, preserving the yarrow-stalk method&#x27;s outcomes.

Another dice method that produces the 1:7:3:5 ratio of the yarrow-stalk method is to add 1d4 + 1d8. All odd results are considered &quot;yin&quot;, with the result of 11 denoting an old &quot;yin&quot;. Any even results would be considered &quot;yang&quot;, with both 4 and 10 treated as old &quot;yang&quot;.

Two dice methods that not only produce the yarrow-stalk probabilities but also maintain the traditional even–odd associations of &quot;yin&quot; and &quot;yang&quot; are the 3d4 and 2d8 methods. In the 3d4 method, one rolls three four-sided dice and adds their outcomes, treating all odd totals as &quot;yang&quot; and all even totals as &quot;yin&quot;, with totals of 4, 7, and 12 indicating a moving line. The 2d8 method works analogously for two eight-sided dice, but here, any total over 10 (with the exception of 12) is considered moving.

=== Calendric cycles and astrology ===
There is a tradition of Taoist thought which explores numerology, esoteric cosmology, astrology and feng shui in connection with the &quot;I Ching&quot;.

The eleventh-century Neo-Confucian philosopher Shao Yung contributed advanced methods of divination including the Plum Blossom Yi Numerology, a horary astrology that takes into account the number of calligraphic brush strokes of one&#x27;s query. Following the associations Carl Jung drew between astrology and &quot;I Ching&quot; with the introduction of his theory of synchronicity, the authors of modern Yi studies are much informed by the astrological paradigm. Chu and Sherrill provide five astrological systems in &quot;An Anthology of I Ching&quot; and in &quot;The Astrology of I Ching&quot; develop a form of symbolic astrology that uses the eight trigrams in connection with the time of one&#x27;s birth to generate an oracle from which further hexagrams and a daily line judgement are derived. Another modern development incorporates the planetary positions of one&#x27;s natal horoscope against the backdrop of Shao Yung&#x27;s circular Fu Xi arrangement and the Western zodiac to provide multiple hexagrams corresponding to each of the planets.

=== Wen Wang Gua method ===
This method goes back to Jing Fang (78–37 BC). While a hexagram is derived with one of the common methods like coin or yarrow stalks, here the divination is not interpreted on the basis of the classic &quot;I Ching&quot; text. Instead, this system connects each of the six hexagram lines to one of the Twelve Earthly Branches, and then the picture can be analyzed with the use of 5 Elements (Wu Xing).

By bringing in the Chinese calendar, this method not only tries to determine &quot;what&quot; will happen, but also &quot;when&quot; it will happen. As such, Wen Wang Gua makes a bridge between &quot;I Ching&quot; and the Four Pillars of Destiny.

=== Software methods ===

The preceding (&quot;concrete&quot;/physical) methods can be simulated in (&quot;abstract&quot;/conceptual) software. This has the theoretical advantage of improving randomness aspects of consulting the &quot;I Ching&quot; (&quot;not-doing&quot; in the personal sense, enhancing the &quot;universal&quot; principle). For all methods, one must pre-focus/prepare the mind.

Here is a typical example for the &quot;modified three-coin&quot; method:

With a modified three-coin method as default, this may avoid the Sung dynasty issue, &quot;i.e.&quot;, when you have an easily available and simple method, you use it—but with a wrong probability! (Also, the first number starts from the bottom like a hexagram.)

A JavaScript version of the Yarrow Stalk method, which generates slightly different probabilities, is available in open source form at GitHub.

== Probability analysis of &quot;I Ching&quot; divination ==

Most analyses of the probabilities of either the coin method or yarrow-stalk method agree on the probabilities for each method. The coin method varies significantly from the yarrow-stalk method, in that the former gives the same probability to both of the moving lines and to both of the static lines, which is not the case in the yarrow-stalk method.

However, the calculation of the frequencies for the yarrow-stalk method—generally believed to be the same as those described in this article in the simplified method using sixteen objects—contains a further error, in the opinion of Andrew Kennedy, which is that of including the selection of &quot;zero&quot; as a quantity for either hand. The yarrow-stalk procedure &quot;expressly requires&quot; that the four numbers be produced &quot;without&quot; using zero; Kennedy shows that by not allowing the user to select zero for either hand, or a single stalk for the right hand (this stalk is moved to the left hand before counting by fours, and so also leaves a zero in the right hand), the hexagram frequencies change significantly for a daily user of the oracle. Kennedy has modified the simplified method of using sixteen coloured objects described in this article as follows:
This arrangement produces Kennedy&#x27;s calculated frequencies within 0.1%.

==In popular culture==

* In the &quot;Profiler&quot; episode &quot;Unholy Alliance&quot;, a serial killer uses &quot;I Ching&quot;, and the hexagram determines what and how someone is chosen and killed.
* In the &quot;Mad Men&quot; episode &quot;The Crash&quot;, Frank Gleason&#x27;s flower child daughter, Wendy, uses the three-coin method to tell fortunes at the offices of the newly merged firm.
* In &quot;The Man In the High Castle&quot; by Philip K. Dick, several characters consult the &quot;I Ching&quot; at various points and consider the answers given. Dick apparently used the &quot;I Ching&quot; while writing his novel, to help him decide on the direction of the plot.
** In the TV adaptation of the novel, the &quot;I Ching&quot; is habitually used by character Nabosuke Tagomi, who later teaches this to Juliana Crain and Trudy Walker.
* In the song &quot;God&quot;, John Lennon states that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t believe in &quot;I Ching&quot;&quot;, among many other religious and cultural phenomena that he claims to not believe in or follow.
* The song &quot;Walking On The Chinese Wall&quot; by Philip Bailey references the &quot;I Ching&quot; and the coin method.
* In Philip Pullman&#x27;s &quot;The Amber Spyglass&quot;, Mary Malone uses the &quot;I Ching&quot; as a way to communicate with Dust.
* In the &quot;Dark Shadows&quot; original TV series episode &quot;700&quot;, Barnabas Collins and Professor Elliott Stokes discover a set of &quot;I Ching&quot; wands in a drawer in an abandoned section of the Collinwood mansion in 1969. Barnabas casts himself into a trance using the wands, allowing his astral body to travel back to the year 1897.
* In the video game &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot;, players can undertake a mission to collect several self-driving cars driven by artificial intelligence. If the player chooses to grant the cars independence, they will receive messages from one vehicle stating that it has discovered the meaning of life through the 61st hexagram.
* The song &quot;Chapter 24&quot; by Pink Floyd takes its lyrics from the commentary on the 24th hexagram.
* In Sheila Heti&#x27;s 2018 autobiographical novel &quot;Motherhood&quot;, Heti includes conversations where she asks yes or no questions about art, love and motherhood, and attempts to answer them using coin flips. This was inspired by the &quot;I Ching&quot;&quot;.&quot;

<text>South Stack () is an island situated just off Holy Island on the northwest coast of Anglesey, Wales.

==Geology==

South Stack is an island known as a sea stack. It was formed by the wave erosion of sedimentary rocks that once connected the island to the mainland. 

The area is known geologically as the South Stack Formation. Its strata includes sandstones and interbedded shales which have been contorted by large folds and crumples. The folds can be seen in the seacliffs (best viewed from the steps leading down to the lighthouse). Thick beds of pure Holyhead Quartzite, which forms the bulk of Holyhead Mountain, lie above these folded sedimentary rocks. Recent studies suggests the rocks appearance was caused by large scale earth movements which is not a part of the normal sedimentary process; however, this theory remains controversial. Similar evidence of upthrusts can be seen in the cliffs to the south of South Stack.

The geology of South Stack has been chosen as one of the top 100 geosites in the United Kingdom by Geological Society of London, for its display of small-scale folding.

==Lighthouse==

South Stack Lighthouse, which was completed in 1809, is sited above the sea on South Stack. Its lamp tower is -tall and the lighthouse complex covers . There are over 390 stone steps and 10 metal steps down to the footbridge.

Originally the only way to cross to the island was in a basket suspended from a hemp cable. In 1828, an iron suspension bridge was built; it was replaced in 1964 with a steel cable truss bridge. However, in 1983 it had to be closed to the public due to safety concerns. After a new aluminium bridge was built, the lighthouse was reopened to the public in 1997. It has become a popular destination, attracting thousands of visitors every year.

==Nature reserve==
The island&#x27;s cliffs are part of the South Stack Cliffs RSPB reserve which are home to an estimated 8,000 nesting birds during the breeding season. An RSPB visitor centre (with bird hide) is located at Elin&#x27;s Tower on the mainland. Birds and marine life seen from the centre include choughs, peregrine falcons, and kestrels as well as harbour porpoises, grey seals, Risso&#x27;s dolphins and bottlenose dolphins.

===Tidal energy project===
In 2019, proposals to develop a &#x27;West Anglesey Demonstration Zone&#x27; tidal energy project at South Stack were submitted under the Transport and Works Act 1992 to the Welsh Government for planning consent. Consent for the project, called Morlais was awarded in December 2021 and construction of the onshore grid connection works took place in 2023.

As the development will come within of the South Stack SSSI, concerns have been expressed about the visual impact on the Anglesey Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty and the Holyhead Mountain Heritage Coast, along with the resultant impact on the tourism, recreation and fishing sectors. The developers have identified that seabird and mammal populations would be affected within the Holy Island Coast Special Area of Conservation and Special Protection Area along with the North Anglesey Marine Special Area of Conservation. Most notably bottlenose dolphin and harbour porpoise would likely be affected, whilst razorbill and common guillemot will be severely impacted. The RSPB is concerned that the razorbill colony on South Stack could be wiped out.

==Walking trails==
Part of the Anglesey Coastal Path, which is a long-distance footpath around the island of Anglesey, passes South Stack. The Cybi Circular Walk around Holyhead Mountain has long and short variants; the short walk is long and takes around two hours to complete. Travelling from the Breakwater Country Park, other sites along the way are the North Stack Fog Signal station, Caer y Tŵr, and Tŷ Mawr Hut Circles.

==Media==
South Stack&#x27;s natural beauty has been used in photography and literature. The cover photo for Roxy Music&#x27;s &quot;Siren&quot; album was taken directly below the central span of the bridge on a slope on the south side, by Graham Hughes in August 1975. In 2010, a French comic entitled &quot;Les Gardiens des Enfers&quot; (&quot;The Guardians of Hell&quot;) was published. Its story is mainly set in South Stack lighthouse in 1859. The cover and the first pages can be seen on the publisher&#x27;s website.

<text>&quot;Shellshock&quot; is the eleventh single released by British group New Order on 17 March 1986. The song originally appeared on the soundtrack to the movie &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; one month prior to its single release. Production is credited to New Order and John Robie, and is loosely inspired by the 1983 Robie-produced R&amp;B club hit, &quot;One More Shot&quot;—a studio project where Robie performed under the band name, C-Bank, and featuring vocals by Jenny Burton.

The single had differing B-sides; in the UK (catalogue number: FAC 143) the 7-inch came with the recycled &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot; instrumental, which also turned up in the movie &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; (although not on the soundtrack), while the 12-inch had a dub mix titled &quot;Shellcock&quot;. The US release had the also previously released instrumental version of &quot;Thieves Like Us&quot;, which had appeared on the &quot;Murder&quot; 12-inch single on Factory Benelux.

&quot;Shellshock&quot; was an international hit, making the mainstream chart in the UK, Ireland, Australia and New Zealand.

The 12-inch boasts an extended remix of the song running nearly ten minutes, New Order&#x27;s longest single not based on a track from one of their studio albums (discounting remixes of legacy songs) behind the 22.5-minute uncut release of &quot;Video 5 8 6&quot;. For the release of the popular singles compilation &quot;Substance&quot;, the original &quot;Pretty in Pink&quot; soundtrack version was not used, as is widely believed, but an edited version of the 12-inch remix cut down to six-and-a-half minutes, omitting an entire verse of vocals. It is this version that appears most often on CD. The 9:41 single remix does not appear on any subsequent New Order compilations, however it surfaced on CD and digital download in 2011 on Volume 6 of the Blank &amp; Jones &quot;Soeighties&quot; compilation series, titled &quot;Extended Version&quot;.

In 2022 the full original 12&quot; version, with a track length of 9:46, was finally released widely in digital format to streaming platforms as a single with the title &quot;&quot;Shellshock (2022 Digital Master&#x27;)&#x27;&quot;.

<doc id="1094950" wikidata="Q201680" url="?curid=1094950" title="Burn rate">
<text>Burn rate is the rate at which a company consumes its cash. It is typically expressed in monthly terms and used for startups. E.g., &quot;the company&#x27;s burn rate is currently $65,000 per month.&quot; In this sense, the word &quot;burn&quot; is a synonymous term for negative cash flow. It is also a measure of how fast a company will use up its shareholder capital. If the shareholder capital is exhausted, the company will either have to start making a profit, find additional funding, or close down.

Burn rate can also refer to how quickly individuals spend their money, particularly their discretionary income. For example, Mackenzie Investments commissioned a test to gauge the spending and saving behavior of Canadians to determine if they are “Overspenders.”

Burn rate is also used in project management to determine the rate at which hours (allocated to a project) are being used, to identify when work is going out of scope, or when efficiencies are being lost. The term is also used in biology, to refer to a person&#x27;s basic metabolic rate; in rocketry, it refers to the rate at which a rocket is burning fuel; and in chemistry.

==History==
The term came into common use during the dot-com era when many start-up companies went through several stages of funding before emerging into profitability and positive cash flows and thus becoming self-sustainable (or, as for the majority, failing to find additional funding and sustainable business models and thus going bankrupt). In between funding events, burn rate becomes an important management measure, since together with the available funds, it provides a time measure to when the next funding event needs to take place.

Some entrepreneurs and investors say that part of the reasons behind the dot-com bust was the unsound management and financial investor practices to keep the burn rate up, taking it as a proxy for how fast the start-up company was acquiring a customer base.

== In project management ==

Aside from financing, the term burn rate is also used in project management to determine the rate at which hours (allocated to a project) are being used, to identify when work is going out of scope, or when efficiencies are being lost. Simply put, the burn rate of any project is the rate at which the project budget is being burned (spent).

<doc id="1094952" wikidata="Q7767871" url="?curid=1094952" title="The Table Talk of Samuel Marchbanks">
<text>The Table Talk of Samuel Marchbanks, published by Clarke Irwin in 1949, is the second of the Samuel Marchbanks books by Canadian novelist and journalist Robertson Davies. The other two books in this series are &quot;The Diary of Samuel Marchbanks&quot; (1947) and &quot;Samuel Marchbanks&#x27; Almanack&quot; (1967).

==History==
Davies created the Samuel Marchbanks character while he was the editor of the &quot;Peterborough Examiner&quot; newspaper in the small city of Peterborough, Ontario, northeast of Toronto. He wrote the first column under the Marchbanks pseudonym in 1944.

&quot;The Table Talk of Samuel Marchbanks&quot; presents a number of Marchbanks&#x27; columns from 1947 and 1948, presenting them as observations purportedly made by Marchbanks during a seven-course formal dinner.

Davies&#x27; writings as Samuel Marchbanks were also collected in a one-volume edition, &quot;The Papers of Samuel Marchbanks&quot; in 1985.</text><links>

<doc id="1094955" wikidata="Q2469437" url="?curid=1094955" title="USS Greer">
<text>USS &quot;Greer&quot; (DD–145) was a in the United States Navy, the first ship named for Rear Admiral James A. Greer (1833–1904). In what became known as the &quot;&quot;Greer&quot; incident,&quot; she became the first US Navy ship to fire on a German ship, three months before the United States officially entered World War II. The incident led President Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue what became known as his &quot;shoot-on-sight&quot; order. Roosevelt publicly confirmed the &quot;shoot on sight&quot; order on 11 September 1941, effectively declaring naval war against Germany and Italy in the Battle of the Atlantic.

&quot;Greer&quot; was launched by William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship &amp; Engine Building Co., Philadelphia, 1 August 1918; sponsored by Miss Evelina Porter Gleaves, daughter of Rear Admiral Albert Gleaves; and commissioned 31 December 1918.

==Service history==
===1919 to 1941===

&quot;Greer&quot;″s shake down took her to Azores, from which she rendezvoused with , carrying President Woodrow Wilson home from the Versailles Peace Conference, and escorted her to the United States. After exercises in coastal waters, &quot;Greer&quot; was assigned to Trepassey Bay, Newfoundland, for duties during a transatlantic flight by four Navy seaplanes, one of which, NC-4, safely completed the historic undertaking. After further training exercises and a European cruise, &quot;Greer&quot; was assigned to the Pacific Fleet, reaching San Francisco 18 November 1919.

Six months&#x27; duty with the Pacific Fleet terminated 25 March 1920, when &quot;Greer&quot; sailed to join the Asiatic Fleet. After standing by off Shanghai to protect American lives and property during riots there in May, &quot;Greer&quot; sailed to Port Arthur and Dairen on intelligence missions and returned to Cavite, Philippines, for fleet exercises. The destroyer returned to San Francisco 29 September 1921 via Guam, Midway, and Pearl Harbor. &quot;Greer&quot; decommissioned at San Diego 22 June 1922, and was placed in reserve.

&quot;Greer&quot; recommissioned 31 March 1930. Operating with the Battle Fleet, she participated in a variety of exercises along the coast from Alaska to Panama, with an occasional voyage to Hawaii. Transferred to the Scouting Fleet 1 February 1931, she cruised off Panama, Haiti, and Cuba before being attached to the Rotating Reserve from August 1933 to February 1934. Training exercises, battle practice, and plane guard duty filled &quot;Greer&quot;″s peacetime routine for the next 2 years. She sailed for the East Coast and duty with the Training Squadron 3 June 1936. After conducting Naval Reserve cruises throughout that summer, &quot;Greer&quot; sailed for the Philadelphia Navy Yard 28 September and decommissioned there 13 January 1937.

As war swept across Europe, &quot;Greer&quot; recommissioned 4 October 1939 and joined Destroyer Division 61 as flagship. After patrolling the East Coast and Caribbean, &quot;Greer&quot; joined the Neutrality Patrol in February 1940. Detached from this duty 5 October, the destroyer patrolled the Caribbean that winter. She joined other American ships on operations in the North Atlantic early in 1941, out of Reykjavík, Iceland, and NS Argentia, Newfoundland. United States ships, as non-belligerents, could not attack Axis submarines; but, as the German High Command stepped up the pace of the war through the summer of 1941, &quot;Greer&quot; found herself involved in an incident which brought America&#x27;s entry into the war nearer.

===The &quot;Greer&quot; incident, September 1941===
The &quot;&quot;Greer&quot; incident&quot; occurred 4 September. By all accounts, a German submarine (later identified as ) fired upon the &quot;Greer,&quot; but made no contact. When news of the encounter reached the United States, public concern ran high. Initial reports reported that a British aircraft aided in repelling the attack.

In response, Germany claimed &quot;that the attack had not been initiated by the German submarine; on the contrary, ... the submarine had been attacked with depth bombs, pursued continuously in the German blockade zone, and assailed by depth bombs until midnight.&quot; The communique implied that the US destroyer had dropped the first depth bombs. Germany accused President Roosevelt of &quot;endeavoring with all the means at his disposal to provoke incidents for the purpose of baiting the American people into the war.&quot;
The United States Department of the Navy replied that the German claims were inaccurate and that &quot;the initial attack in the engagement was made by the submarine on the &quot;Greer&quot;.&quot; Roosevelt made the &quot;Greer&quot; incident the principal focus of one of his famed &quot;fireside chats&quot;, where he explained a new order he issued as commander-in-chief that escalated America nearer to outright involvement in the European war. In Roosevelt&#x27;s words:
The &quot;Greer&quot; was flying the American flag. Her identity as an American ship was unmistakable. She was then and there attacked by a submarine. Germany admits that it was a German submarine. The submarine deliberately fired a torpedo at the &quot;Greer&quot;, followed by another torpedo attack. In spite of what Hitler&#x27;s propaganda bureau has invented, and in spite of what any American obstructionist organisation may prefer to believe, I tell you the blunt fact that the German submarine fired first upon this American destroyer without warning, and with the deliberate design to sink her.
Declaring that Germany had been guilty of &quot;an act of piracy,&quot; President Roosevelt announced what became known as his &quot;shoot-on-sight&quot; order: that Nazi submarines&#x27; &quot;very presence in any waters which America deems vital to its defense constitutes an attack. In the waters which we deem necessary for our defense, American naval vessels and American planes will no longer wait until Axis submarines lurking under the water, or Axis raiders on the surface of the sea, strike their deadly blow—first.&quot; He concluded:
The aggression is not ours. [Our concern] is solely defense. But let this warning be clear. From now on, if German or Italian vessels of war enter the waters, the protection of which is necessary for American defense, they do so at their own peril. … The sole responsibility rests upon Germany. There will be no shooting unless Germany continues to seek it.

Senator David I. Walsh (Democrat–Massachusetts), isolationist Chair of the Senate Committee on Naval Affairs, scheduled a committee hearing to unearth the details of the incident, which prompted Admiral Harold R. Stark, Chief of Naval Operations, to issue a written report. Stark&#x27;s account, made public in October 1941, confirmed that the &quot;Greer&quot; dropped its charges only after the submarine fired its first torpedo at it, but revealed that the &quot;Greer&quot; had gone in search of the submarine after its presence was noted by the British aircraft. Admiral Stark&#x27;s report stated:
At 0840 that morning, &quot;Greer&quot;, carrying mail and passengers to Iceland, &quot;was informed by a British plane of the presence of a submerged submarine about 10 miles [(16 km)] directly ahead. … Acting on the information from the British plane the &quot;Greer&quot; proceeded to search for the submarine and at 0920 she located the submarine directly ahead by her underwater sound equipment. The &quot;Greer&quot; proceeded then to trail the submarine and broadcast the submarine&#x27;s position. This action, taken by the &quot;Greer&quot;, was in accordance with her orders, that is, to give out information but not to attack.&quot; The British plane continued in the vicinity of the submarine until 1032, but prior to her departure the plane dropped four depth charges in the vicinity of the submarine. The &quot;Greer&quot; maintained [its] contact until about 1248. During this period (three hours 28 minutes), the &quot;Greer&quot; manoeuvred so as to keep the submarine ahead. At 1240 the submarine changed course and closed the &quot;Greer&quot;. At 1245 an impulse bubble (indicating the discharge of a torpedo by the submarine) was sighted close aboard the &quot;Greer&quot;. At 1249 a torpedo track was sighted crossing the wake of the ship from starboard to port, distant about 100 yards [(100 m)] astern. At this time the &quot;Greer&quot; lost sound contact with the submarine. At 1300 the &quot;Greer&quot; started searching for the submarine and at 1512 … the &quot;Greer&quot; made underwater contact with a submarine. The &quot;Greer&quot; attacked immediately with depth charges.

Stark went on to report that the result of the encounter was undetermined, although most assumed from the German response that the sub had survived. In fact, U-652 had indeed survived and promptly headed west to participate in the devastating U-boat pack attack on convoy SC 42 in early September.

Historian Charles A. Beard would later write that Admiral Stark&#x27;s report to the Senate Committee &quot;made the President&#x27;s statement... appear in some respects inadequate, and, in others, incorrect.&quot; In his postwar summary of the Stark report, Beard emphasised that (1) the &quot;Greer&quot; had chased the sub and held contact with the sub for 3 hours and 28 minutes before the sub fired its first torpedo; (2) the &quot;Greer&quot; then lost contact with the sub, searched, and after re-establishing contact two hours later, attacked immediately with depth charges, then (3) searched for three more hours before proceeding to its destination.

The Stark report&#x27;s account of how the &quot;Greer&quot;&#x27;s engagement began caused Pulitzer-prizewinning New York Times reporter Arthur Krock to address it (and the Nazi sub engagements with the &quot;Kearny&quot;, and the &quot;Reuben James&quot;) when speaking about &quot;who &#x27;attacked&#x27; whom.&quot; Krock defined the term &quot;attack&quot; as &quot;an onset, an aggressive initiation of combat, a move which is the antithesis of &#x27;defense.&#x27;&quot; &quot;In that definition,&quot; he said, &quot;all three of our destroyers attacked the German submarines.&quot;

A 2005 book concluded that Senator Walsh&#x27;s &quot;very aggressive actions in the &quot;USS Greer&quot; case prevented war from breaking out in the Atlantic.&quot;

The episode did not escalate into war because both Hitler and Roosevelt were being very cautious. Hitler concentrated his resources on defeating the Soviet Union, while Roosevelt was building up a broad base of support for aggressive patrols of the North Atlantic.

===1941 to 1945===
&quot;Greer&quot; remained in the North Atlantic through 1941, shepherding convoys to and from MOMP, the mid-ocean meeting point at which American ships took over escort duties from the hard-pressed Royal Navy. After overhaul at Boston, she turned south 3 March 1942 to resume patrol duty in the Caribbean. In addition to regular escort duties, &quot;Greer&quot; performed many other tasks, including rescuing 39 victims of German U-boats. In May she stood guard off Pointe a Pitre, Guadeloupe, trying to keep the Vichy French government from getting to sea.

Sailing from Guantanamo Bay 23 January 1943, &quot;Greer&quot; sailed to Boston then headed for the Atlantic convoy duty. Departing NS Argentia, Newfoundland 1 March 1943, she escorted merchantmen for Northern Ireland. During heavy North Atlantic gales, Convoy SC 121 lost seven ships to three separate U-boat attacks before reaching Londonderry Port on 13 March. &quot;Greer&quot; then escorted 40 merchantmen on the return voyage without incident, and continued on to Hampton Roads 15 April with tanker &quot;Chicopee&quot;.

After exercises in Casco Bay, &quot;Greer&quot; departed New York City 11 May with a convoy of 83 ships. Reaching Casablanca, Morocco, 1 June, the destroyer patrolled off the North African port and then recrossed the Atlantic, arriving New York 27 June. After another run to Northern Ireland, &quot;Greer&quot; returned to New York 11 August.

After steaming to Norfolk, she sailed for the British West Indies 26 August to serve briefly as plane guard to . She rendezvoused with a convoy in the Caribbean and headed for North Africa. Diverted to New York, she docked there 14 September. Routine training exercises turned into tragedy 15 October as &quot;Greer&quot; collided with off the mouth of Indian River, Delaware Capes (35 miles (56 km) south-east of Cape May, New Jersey). &quot;Moonstone&quot; sank in less than 4 minutes, but &quot;Greer&quot; rescued all the crew but one.

After repairs, the destroyer escorted the Free French cruiser &quot;Gloire&quot; from New York to Norfolk. &quot;Greer&quot; sailed 26 December with another Casablanca-bound convoy and after an uneventful crossing returned to Boston 9 February 1944. This was the final transatlantic crossing for the old four-stack destroyer, as she and her sister ships were replaced by newer and faster escorts.

===Convoys escorted===
===Auxiliary service===
The veteran destroyer spent the remainder of her long career performing a variety of necessary tasks in American waters. After a tour of submarine training duty at New London, &quot;Greer&quot; became plane guard for several new aircraft carriers during the summer of 1944. Operating from various New England ports, she served with ,
, , and . Sailing to Key West in February 1945, &quot;Greer&quot; continued plane guard duty until 11 June when she sailed to the Philadelphia Navy Yard.

&quot;Greer&quot; decommissioned 19 July 1945. Her name was stricken from the Navy list 13 August and her hull was sold to the Boston Metal Salvage Company of Baltimore, Maryland on 30 November 1945.

<doc id="1094965" wikidata="Q712767" url="?curid=1094965" title="Bill Nicholson (footballer)">
<text>William Edward Nicholson (26 January 1919 – 23 October 2004) was an English football player, coach, manager and scout who had a 55-year association with Tottenham Hotspur. He is considered one of the most important figures in the club&#x27;s history, winning eight major trophies in his 16-year managerial spell, and most notably guiding the team to their Double-winning season of 1960–61.

==Early life==
Born in Scarborough, North Riding of Yorkshire, the eighth of nine children, Nicholson was a pupil at the town&#x27;s Gladstone Road Junior School before attending Scarborough High School for Boys. He worked briefly in a laundry after leaving school, but at the age of 17 he was invited to a trial at Tottenham Hotspur, where he arrived on 16 March 1936 after playing for Young Liberals and Scarborough Working Men&#x27;s Club in his youth. After a month&#x27;s trial, he was taken on as a ground-staff boy at £2 a week. He played for Spurs&#x27; nursery club Northfleet United and won a Kent Senior Cup winners medal in the final against Dover. He signed as a full professional for Tottenham in August 1938, and played his first Football League game at Ewood Park against Blackburn Rovers on 22 October 1938.

==Playing career==
Nicholson joined the Durham Light Infantry on the outbreak of World War II in 1939. As a professional footballer he was sent on a Physical Education course and was made a sergeant-instructor, training new intakes of troops throughout the war. During the Second World War he was a guest player for several clubs, including Newcastle United where he played on 19 occasions. Although the war probably cost him half his playing career, he did not regret it as his experiences taught him the man-management skills which were to have such a great effect later in his career.

In 1946, Nicholson returned to the Spurs first team, playing at centre half for two seasons, then moving to right half for a further six years. He was a vital part of the legendary &quot;push and run&quot; Tottenham team which won the league championship in the 1950–51 season.

He made his full international debut for England on 19 May 1951 against Portugal at Goodison Park, Liverpool, and made an immediate impression by scoring with his first touch of the ball after only 19 seconds. This proved to be his only international appearance due to injuries, his habit of putting his club before his country, and the dominance of Billy Wright. Nicholson is quoted as saying &quot;My duty is to get fit for Tottenham. Well, they pay my wages, don&#x27;t they?&quot;. Of his only appearance he said &quot;Stan Pearson nodded it back and I ran on to let go a first time shot which, from the moment I hit it, I knew was going in. But for the next game they brought back Billy Wright and I accepted that because he was the better player&quot;. Nicholson is the only player to have scored for England with his first touch in international football and subsequently never play at that level again.

==Managerial career==
Nicholson took a Football Association (FA) coaching course and joined the coaching staff at Tottenham upon his retirement as a player. He quickly rose through the ranks of the coaching staff to become first team coach in 1955. He subsequently assisted England manager Walter Winterbottom at the 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden.

On 11 October 1958, Nicholson was called to the Tottenham boardroom and appointed manager of the club in succession to Jimmy Anderson. At the time the club was sixth from the bottom of the First Division and there was little indication that the greatest period in the history of the club was about to begin. That afternoon, in the club&#x27;s first game under Nicholson&#x27;s management, Tottenham Hotspur beat Everton 10–4 at White Hart Lane. This represented a new club record, surpassed only by their 13–2 (10–1 at half-time) FA Cup replay win over Crewe Alexandra in the 1959–60 season.
Less than two years later Spurs wrote their place in the history books when they won the Football League championship and the FA Cup in the 1960–61 season, the first &quot;double&quot; of the twentieth century. Spurs dominated the opposition that year, winning their first eleven games and scoring 115 goals in 42 games. The following year they won the FA Cup again, and narrowly missed a place in the 1961–62 European Cup Final, losing to Benfica in the semi-final.

In the 1962–63 season, Nicholson again put Spurs in the history books when they became the first British club to win a major European trophy. In Rotterdam on 15 May 1963, Spurs defeated favourites Atlético Madrid 5–1 to win the European Cup Winners Cup.

In 1966–67 Nicholson&#x27;s Spurs won their third FA Cup in seven years by beating Chelsea in the first-ever all-London final. This was followed by a string of trophies in the early 1970s – the League Cup was won in 1970–71 and 1972–73, and the UEFA Cup in 1971–72.

As the 1970s wore on, Nicholson became increasingly disillusioned with football, in particular the increased player wages and the endemic hooliganism. He was appalled by the hooliganism he witnessed at the UEFA Cup final that Spurs lost to Feyenoord. Nicholson decided to resign after a poor start to the 1974–75 season and losing 4–0 to Middlesbrough in the League Cup in September 1974. Nicholson later said of his resignation: &quot;The simple truth was that I was burned out, I had no more to offer.&quot; His tenure ended in acrimony as Nicholson wished to select for his replacement Danny Blanchflower as manager and Johnny Giles as player-coach, but Spurs chairman Sidney Wale was angered that Nicholson had contacted Giles and Blanchflower without his knowledge. Although Nicholson had intended to stay at the club as an advisor, the club chose to sever all ties with a £10,000 payoff and refused Nicholson a testimonial.

==Post-managerial career==
After quitting the Spurs manager&#x27;s job, Nicholson spent a year at West Ham United as an advisor and a scout. When Keith Burkinshaw became Spurs&#x27; manager in 1976, one of his first requests was that Nicholson be brought back to White Hart Lane as a consultant. His knowledge and experience were invaluable, and he showed that he still had an eye for players by recommending several to Burkinshaw, including Graham Roberts, Tony Galvin, and Gary Mabbutt. Nicholson continued to work as a consultant until 1991, when he was awarded the title of Club President.

==Recognition==
Nicholson was appointed an OBE in 1975. In 1999 an approach road to White Hart Lane was named &quot;Bill Nicholson Way&quot; in his honour. On 8 August 2001, the club played a testimonial match in Nicholson&#x27;s honour against Italian club ACF Fiorentina, following an initial testimonial against West Ham on 21 August 1983. In 2003 Nicholson was inducted into the English Football Hall of Fame in recognition of his impact as a manager. Spurs fans had also campaigned for many years to have Nicholson knighted in recognition of his outstanding achievements and contribution to football but they were unsuccessful. Bill Nicholson died on 23 October 2004 after a long illness.

Bill Nicholson has been credited with saying, &#x27;It is better to fail aiming high than to succeed aiming low. And we of Spurs have set our sights very high, so high in fact that even failure will have in it an echo of glory.&#x27; Sports historian, Norman Giller, who has written biographies on both Nicholson and his skipper Danny Blanchflower, traces this quote to Blanchflower. &quot;Bill was a blunt Yorkshireman who just did not use this sort of language,&quot; Giller has written in &quot;Danny was the poet of the team and he both said this and wrote it in his newspaper columns when captain of Tottenham. Somehow somebody has put the words into Nicholson&#x27;s mouth, but it was definitely Danny who said it first.&quot;

<doc id="1094966" wikidata="Q334541" url="?curid=1094966" title="Tony Pulis">
<text>Anthony Richard Pulis (; born 16 January 1958) is a Welsh former professional football manager and former footballer who last managed Sheffield Wednesday.

Pulis obtained his FA coaching badge at age 19, followed by his UEFA &#x27;A&#x27; licence aged 21 – making him one of the youngest professional players ever to have obtained the qualification. His son, Anthony, was a professional footballer and played at Stoke. Pulis had a 17-year career as a defender where he played for Bristol Rovers, Newport County, AFC Bournemouth and Gillingham. He also had a short spell in Hong Kong with Happy Valley.

Pulis took his first steps into management at Bournemouth, where he was a player/coach and then Harry Redknapp&#x27;s assistant. He then took control when Redknapp left the club. He then went on to Gillingham before leaving in 1999 after a dispute with chairman Paul Scally. Pulis then had unsuccessful spells at Bristol City and Portsmouth before being appointed manager of Stoke City in 2002. He guided Stoke through a tough 2002–03 season avoiding relegation to the Second Division on the final day of the season. He spent two more seasons with Stoke before being sacked by Stoke&#x27;s Icelandic board for &quot;failing to exploit the foreign market&quot;. He spent the 2005–06 season at Plymouth Argyle before returning to Stoke along with Peter Coates. After narrowly missing out on a play-off spot in the 2006–07 season he guided Stoke to the Premier League in the 2007–08 season by finishing runners-up in the Championship.

With Stoke amongst the favourites for relegation upon their return to the top flight after a 23-year absence, Stoke went on to comfortably survive and finished in 12th position. Pulis made history during the 2010–11 season as he guided Stoke to their first FA Cup Final after beating Bolton Wanderers 5–0 in the semi-final. The &quot;Potters&quot;, however, lost the final 1–0 to Manchester City, but had the consolation of qualifying for European football. In the UEFA Europa League, Stoke lost 2–0 on aggregate in the round of 32 to Spanish giants Valencia. The 2012–13 season saw Stoke make little progress and Pulis left the club by mutual consent on 21 May 2013.

Pulis returned to management on 23 November 2013 joining Crystal Palace on a two-and-a-half-year contract. He guided Palace away from relegation, to their highest Premier League finish of 11th in 2013–14, which earned him the Premier League Manager of the Season award. He left the club, however, shortly before the start of the subsequent season. He joined West Bromwich Albion in January 2015, a post he held until November 2017. Pulis achieved a top half finish with West Brom in the 2016–17 season, finishing 10th, but the club made a poor start to the following season, culminating in his sacking. On Boxing Day 2017, Pulis was appointed manager of Middlesbrough, a post he held until May 2019. On 13 November 2020, Pulis returned to management when he was named manager of Sheffield Wednesday; however, on 28 December, he was sacked after 10 games in charge. Following his sacking, he announced his retirement from football management.

==Playing career==
Pulis began his career at Bristol Rovers where he joined their school of football excellence in Eastville from Newport YMCA. Pulis cites his time at Eastville as an excellent grounding with his Rovers teammate and friend Ian Holloway also making it in football management. &quot;We learned our trade at a football club with really, really good people who had old fashioned values, I truly believe that it&#x27;s because of the way we were brought up back then that we have managed to go on and achieve what we have done in the game. The basic principles were drilled into us, both on and off the pitch. Nothing was given to us and we had to work very, very hard for everything we got.&quot;

Pulis made 85 league appearances for the &quot;Pirates&quot; before leaving to join Hong Kong club Happy Valley AA in 1982. The club finished second in the Hong Kong First Division League and won the Hong Kong Senior Challenge Shield in his eight-month stint with the club. He then returned to Rovers the following year and made a further 45 league appearances before moving to his home town club Newport County in 1984. At Newport, Pulis became a popular member of the squad and his former County teammate David Giles believes Pulis was always destined for top-level management.

With County struggling financially, Harry Redknapp signed Pulis at AFC Bournemouth, spending three years at Dean Court before joining Gillingham in 1989 for £10,000 on a three-year deal. Gillingham manager Damien Richardson had envisaged utilising Pulis as a sweeper but his time in Kent was blighted by an injury suffered in a pre-season friendly against West Ham, limiting him to just 16 appearances. After contemplating a career outside of football and studying for a small business qualification Pulis returned to Bournemouth a year later for a fee of £15,000 to take up a player/coach role. He made 16 appearances, scoring one goal, while in this role.

==Managerial career==
===AFC Bournemouth===
Pulis was promoted to the position of manager in 1992, following Harry Redknapp&#x27;s decision to leave the club for Premier League side West Ham United. Pulis spent two seasons at Bournemouth, both seasons saw the &quot;Cherries&quot; finish in 17th position before moving on. During his time at the club Pulis spent less than £400,000 on transfers, but recouped nearly £2.7 million in player sales. Among his purchases was Steve Fletcher, signed from Hartlepool United for £30,000, who would go on to make a record 728 appearances for the Dorset side across two spells.

===Gillingham===
Pulis then joined Gillingham in the summer of 1995, whom he managed for a further four seasons, turning a team that had struggled at the very bottom of the Football League into a promotion winning one in his first season, and laying the foundations for the club&#x27;s eventual elevation to the First Division for the first time in their history.

In the 1995–96 season the Kent side gained promotion after finishing second behind Preston North End, setting a record for the fewest goals conceded by a team in the course of a 46-game Football League season in the process, with goalkeeper Jim Stannard keeping 29 clean sheets. The following season Gillingham started poorly, sitting in the relegation places towards the end of 1996, but improved to finish in 11th place and just six points below the promotion play-off places. The 1997–98 season saw further improvement, with the Gills finishing in 8th place and missing out on the play-off places only on the goals-scored rule. 

In the 1999 Second Division play-off final, the &quot;Gills&quot; were 2–0 up with less than two minutes left, following goals by the prolific partnership of Robert Taylor and Carl Asaba, only to see Manchester City score twice, the equaliser in injury time, and after that win a penalty shoot-out 3–1. Following the defeat, Pulis was controversially sacked by the club amidst claims of gross misconduct. He later brought a £400,000 court case against Gillingham chairman Paul Scally for unpaid bonuses, which was settled out of court in 2001 for £75,000.

===Bristol City===
Pulis was appointed manager of Bristol City in July 1999, prior to the start of the 1999–2000 season. A previous long stint at bitter rivals Bristol Rovers meant that Pulis&#x27;s appointment was met with mixed reception. He made several reasonably big purchases including Steve Jones and former Rovers player Peter Beadle, but his popularity hit an all-time low only six months into his term as manager and when rumours surfaced of a switch to Portsmouth, home fans chanted for him to leave. He moved on to Portsmouth shortly, where Milan Mandarić had recently taken over as chairman.

===Portsmouth===
In January 2000, Pulis left Bristol City to become manager of Portsmouth. He took Portsmouth from the bottom three to mid-table but lasted only ten months in the job before being sacked and being replaced by Steve Claridge in October 2000.

===Stoke City===
Pulis was then out of work for two years, before the resignation of Stoke City&#x27;s manager Steve Cotterill early into the 2002–03 season led to Pulis being given the job that November. Pulis immediately found himself in a relegation battle and it looked likely that the club would be relegated back to the Second Division only a year after being promoted. Pulis, however, completed the signings of striker Ade Akinbiyi and goalkeeper Mark Crossley, on loan from Crystal Palace and Middlesbrough respectively, who helped turn around the club&#x27;s bad run. Stoke avoided relegation on the final day of the 2002–03 season with a 1–0 win over Reading at the Britannia Stadium, with Akinbiyi scoring the only goal of the match. Pulis rates Stoke&#x27;s survival in 2002–03 as one of his best achievements in management.

In the following season, 2003–04, Pulis guided the club to an 11th-place finish. Tensions grew between the manager and chairman, Gunnar Gíslason, in the 2004–05 season. Pulis was frustrated with his lack of transfer funds which led to Dave Brammer and Steve Simonsen, both of whom were free agents, being his only significant signings prior to the start of the season. Pulis, however, did add Anthony Pulis, his son, and Lewis Buxton to his squad in January 2005. The disagreement between Pulis and the club&#x27;s Icelandic ownership culminated with Pulis parting company with the club on 28 June 2005. He was sacked for &quot;failing to exploit the foreign transfer market&quot; by then chairman Gíslason. Following his dismissal, Pulis bemoaned the club&#x27;s decision to sell Ade Akinbiyi to Championship rivals Burnley, stating, &quot;We sold our top scorer and never replaced him.&quot; Dutch manager Johan Boskamp was named as Pulis&#x27;s successor on 29 June 2005, only a day after Pulis was sacked.

===Plymouth Argyle===
After a brief spell assisting with training sessions at Boston United (then managed by his friend Steve Evans), Pulis was appointed as manager at Championship side Plymouth Argyle in September 2005, managing to turn a floundering team into one that with the right investment could challenge for a top half/play off place in 2006–07. The turn-around coincided with the loan of West Ham United central defender Elliott Ward and the club improved even further with the permanent signing of Lilian Nalis from Sheffield United. Plymouth Argyle ended the season 14th in the Championship table.

===Return to Stoke City===

In May 2006, Pulis was the subject of an approach from former club Stoke, who had recently parted company with manager Johan Boskamp, following Peter Coates&#x27; takeover of the club. Plymouth reportedly turned down this approach. On 14 June 2006, however, it was announced that Pulis would be returning as manager of Stoke.

Pulis bolstered his squad for the 2006–07 season with the permanent additions of Danny Higginbotham, Ricardo Fuller and Vincent Péricard. His most notable coup was the loan signing of Lee Hendrie from Aston Villa. Hendrie&#x27;s arrival along with the loan signings of Salif Diao, Andy Griffin and Rory Delap coincided with a change of form for the &quot;Potters&quot; following a poor start to the season. Stoke went as high as fourth in the table prior to the January transfer window.

Pulis was named Manager of the Month for April 2007 after Stoke picked up 11 points from 5 league games. This unbeaten run lifted Stoke to seventh in the table, on equal points with sixth-place Southampton. A 1–1 draw against Queens Park Rangers on the final day of the season, however, led to Stoke finishing eighth in the Championship. Pulis sold several key players prior to the 2007–08 season; club captain Danny Higginbotham was one of a number of players to depart, joining Sunderland for £3 million. Pulis, however, utilised the loan market again, signing five players on loan, including Ryan Shawcross from Manchester United, with a few of these loan signings joining on a permanent deal in the January transfer window.

Pulis guided Stoke City to promotion to the Premier League on the final matchday of the season, to be Stoke&#x27;s first top flight campaign in 23 years. Upon promotion, Pulis admitted the need to strengthen his squad but he also made it clear that the club would not go &#x27;over the top&#x27; with spending. Stoke&#x27;s biggest summer signing was that of striker Dave Kitson, who joined from recently relegated Reading for £5.5 million. Kitson was followed by the captures of Seyi Olofinjana from Wolverhampton Wanderers for £3 million, Abdoulaye Faye from Newcastle United for £2.25 million, Amdy Faye from Charlton Athletic for an undisclosed fee, Andrew Davies joined for £1.2 million from Southampton, defender Ibrahima Sonko signed for an initial £2 million fee from Reading and former &quot;Potter&quot; Danny Higginbotham rejoined his former club from Sunderland for an undisclosed fee. Pulis was also prepared to move players on, including his son Anthony Pulis and striker Jon Parkin.

After a promising start to the Premier League season, Stoke&#x27;s mid-season slump left them as one of the favourites for relegation. The January additions of Sheffield United&#x27;s James Beattie and West Ham winger Matthew Etherington, however, helped rejuvenate their season. Stoke dipped in and out of the relegation zone until March, when a good run of form lifted them above the bottom three. Their 2–1 win away to Hull City on 9 May 2009 secured their Premier League survival. Pulis has received much praise for his work with Stoke on a limited budget, in particular his achievement of keeping them in the Premier League. He was mentioned as a possible candidate for the 2008–09 Premier League Manager of the Year award.

The following season saw Stoke consolidating their Premier League status rather than facing relegation, and also saw them reach the quarter-finals of the FA Cup with victories over York City, Arsenal and Manchester City before losing to Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Stoke finished 11th in the Premier League with 47 points, a place higher and two points more than last season. Pulis made his 300th appearance as Stoke manager with a 3–0 win over Blackburn Rovers on 6 February 2010. The result was Stoke&#x27;s largest top-flight win for nearly 24 years after a 4–0 win over Wolverhampton Wanderers in 1984. Following criticism from Fulham player Danny Murphy over the way Pulis sets his team out to play, Pulis decided to release a six-minute statement defending the management staff and club as well as questioning Murphy&#x27;s agenda.

After a number of controversial refereeing decisions that went against Stoke, Pulis advocated the introduction of a relegation system for referees to stop poor decisions. He became only the third manager in Stoke&#x27;s history to guide the club to the semi-finals of the FA Cup after a quarter-final victory over West Ham. They then went on to beat Bolton 5–0, making Pulis the first manager to guide Stoke to an FA Cup Final. Stoke, however, lost the final 1–0 to Manchester City, with Yaya Touré scoring the only goal. By reaching the final, Stoke qualified for the 2011–12 UEFA Europa League, after Manchester City confirmed a place in the UEFA Champions League. Club chairman Peter Coates said in May 2011 that Pulis is Stoke&#x27;s greatest ever manager.

In the Europa League, Stoke were drawn against Croatian giants Hajduk Split, where Stoke won both legs 1–0 to become the first Stoke side to win a two-legged European tie. Pulis signed former England internationals Jonathan Woodgate and Matthew Upson on free transfers to strengthen his centre backs following the departure of Abdoulaye Faye. He took charge of his 800th competitive match in August 2011. On transfer deadline day, Pulis signed Cameron Jerome from Birmingham City as well as Tottenham Hotspur duo Peter Crouch and Wilson Palacios; Crouch, at a fee of £10 million, broke the club&#x27;s transfer record for the fourth successive season. In the group stages of the Europa League, Stoke were drawn against Beşiktaş, Dynamo Kyiv and Maccabi Tel Aviv, and after a 1–1 draw against Kyiv in December, Stoke qualified for the knock-out stages. Pulis described the achievement as a &quot;milestone&quot; in the club&#x27;s history. Stoke were handed a glamour tie against Spanish giants Valencia in the round of 32. He reached 400 matches as Stoke manager in January 2012. Stoke lost both legs against Valencia 1–0 and exited the Europa League. In the second leg in Valencia, Stoke took a largely reserve side and named just four substitutes which included academy captain Lucas Dawson. This attracted much criticism of Pulis by supporters but he defended his choice. Stoke finished the 2011–12 season in 14th position.

In the summer of 2012, Pulis was again busy in the transfer market, letting Ricardo Fuller leave bringing in a number of new midfield players. In came American duo Geoff Cameron and Maurice Edu, Scottish pair Jamie Ness and Charlie Adam, Wolverhampton Wanderers winger Michael Kightly, Blackburn&#x27;s French prospect Steven Nzonzi and former England international striker Michael Owen. Stoke made a steady start to the 2012–13 season despite a tough opening set of fixtures. Pulis has stated that he would like to see out the remainder of his managerial career at Stoke and that he is starting to change his side&#x27;s style of play. Stoke went on a ten match unbeaten run from 10 November to 29 December, and held one of the best defensive records in Europe.

Stoke, however, made a poor start to 2013 picking up just a point in January and a frustrating transfer window saw just two new arrivals American winger Brek Shea and England goalkeeper Jack Butland. Performances and results remained poor in February and Pulis came under heavy criticism from supporters after an uninspiring home defeat against West Ham. Victories against Queens Park Rangers and Norwich City saw Stoke avoid the threat of relegation and they finished the 2012–13 Premier League season in 13th position. It was a season of little progress at Stoke, and Pulis left the club on 21 May 2013 after a meeting with club chairman Peter Coates. Speaking after his departure, Pulis revealed that he was disappointed by Coates&#x27; decision but accepted his reasons. He was replaced by another Welsh manager, Mark Hughes.

===Crystal Palace===
On 23 November 2013, Pulis was appointed manager of Crystal Palace on a two-and-a-half-year contract, taking over from Ian Holloway. His first win came on 3 December 2013, a 1–0 home win against West Ham. In the early part of 2014, the team went on a run of five consecutive victories, which included wins over Chelsea, Cardiff City, Aston Villa, Everton and West Ham. This run of form earned Palace mathematical safety and saw Pulis named as Manager of the Month for April 2014. Palace finished the 2013–14 Premier League season in 11th position with 45 points, which saw Pulis named as the Premier League Manager of the Year.

During the summer of 2014, Pulis was hired by the BBC to be a pundit for the 2014 FIFA World Cup in Brazil. When he was not working, he used his spare time watching other games to scout new players and to see different managers at work. Shortly before the start of the subsequent 2014–15 season, however, Pulis left the club &quot;by mutual consent&quot;, saying that it was because he was not being backed in the transfer market by the Palace board. In November 2016, Pulis was ordered by a high court judge to pay Crystal Palace £3.7 million for fraudulent misrepresentation in a dispute with Steve Parish over a £2 million &quot;survival&quot; bonus paid to him on his request over two weeks earlier than contractually necessary the day before he announced his departure.

===West Bromwich Albion===
On 1 January 2015, Pulis was appointed head coach at West Bromwich Albion. He won his first game in charge 7–0 against Conference Premier side Gateshead in an FA Cup third round match. During the January transfer window, Pulis secured the services of former Manchester United midfielder Darren Fletcher, who Pulis soon promoted to first team captain, with Chris Brunt as deputy. Under Pulis, the &quot;Baggies&quot; went through February unbeaten, keeping three clean sheets in a row in the process. West Brom&#x27;s form saw Pulis named as the Premier League Manager of the Month for February. West Brom secured victories over Chelsea and Manchester United, and Pulis duly led the team to a 13th-place finish in the Premier League.

For the 2015–16 season, Pulis signed striker Salomón Rondón for a club record fee of £12 million from Zenit Saint Petersburg. Pulis&#x27;s statement that he wanted Leicester City to win the 2015–16 Premier League and the motivation of his players was credited by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; with spoiling their rivals Tottenham&#x27;s celebration party. In the summer of 2016, Pulis was hired by ITV to be a pundit for UEFA Euro 2016 in France. He was used for his knowledge and previous punditry experience to commentate live on Wales. There were other games such as Spain-Turkey where Pulis also commentated live on the match.

Six games into the 2016–17 season, Pulis reached the milestone of 1,000 games as a professional manager which came against his former club, Stoke. At the end of October, Pulis signed a one-year extension to his contract. The extension committed him to the club until the summer of 2018. As the season drew to a close Pulis was part of the six-man shortlist for the Premier League Manager of the Season award, eventually losing out to Chelsea manager Antonio Conte. The club finished in the top half of the table under his guidance, occupying 8th place for much of the season, before a poor run of only two points in their final nine games saw them drop to 10th. On 11 August 2017, Pulis signed a further contract extension which committed him to the club until 2019. Upon signing he said: &quot;I&#x27;m delighted to extend my contract because it continues the stability within the Club which is essential for its progress.&quot;

Pulis was sacked as West Brom manager on 20 November 2017, after a poor run of results where they had won only four of their last 22 Premier League games, a run stretching back to 2016–17. He left with West Brom occupying 17th place in the table. Throughout his tenure, concerns had been raised by supporters over his perceived &quot;negative&quot; brand of football, and a lack of progress at the club.

===Middlesbrough===
On 26 December 2017, Pulis was appointed as manager of Championship club Middlesbrough, replacing the sacked Garry Monk, who left the club ninth in the Championship table, after an indifferent first half to their season. On that same day as his appointment, Pulis was present in the stands to watch Middlesbrough, managed by Academy manager Craig Liddle in the interim period, defeat Bolton Wanderers 2–0 at the Riverside Stadium. Pulis&#x27;s first match in charge of Middlesbrough ended in a 1–0 home defeat to Aston Villa.

Pulis&#x27;s first win as Middlesbrough manager came on 1 January 2018, a comeback 3–2 victory at Preston North End. As the season continued, Middlesbrough temporarily began to suffer under the similar results under Pulis that they received under Monk&#x27;s management, though Pulis turned the team&#x27;s fortunes around, and they finished fifth, qualifying to the play-offs. However, they were defeated 1–0 by Villa, thus being confirmed as a Championship club for another season, much to the devastation of the club&#x27;s fans, players and staff.

In Pulis&#x27;s first full season as Middlesbrough, the team had a relatively strong run of results through to February, including a 3–2 away win against Pulis&#x27;s previous club West Bromwich Albion. His side went on to maintain a top six position until March, though a run of six consecutive defeats saw them drop out of the top six for the first time that season. Middlesbrough finished the season in 7th and Pulis left the club when the decision was taken to not extend his contract.

===Sheffield Wednesday===
On 13 November 2020, Pulis returned to management after over a year out of football, joining Championship club Sheffield Wednesday, the second consecutive appointment for which he had replaced Garry Monk. He brought in Mike Trusson as his assistant manager and Craig Gardner as first-team coach during his first week. His first match in charge ended in a 1–0 defeat against Preston North End after Josh Windass was sent off, after 17 minutes. He got his first point the following game in another away game, a 1–1 draw against Swansea City, with Adam Reach getting the first goal of his reign. After the 2–0 defeat to Nottingham Forest, he broke the record for worst start for any manager at Sheffield Wednesday, getting 3 points from a possible 24. He won his first game as manager at the ninth time of asking against Coventry City in a 1–0 win, with Tom Lees getting the winning goal. On 28 December 2020, Pulis was sacked as Wednesday manager after having secured just one victory from ten league games. Sky Sports reported that major disagreements between Pulis and club owner Dejphon Chansiri over transfer plans for the upcoming January transfer window were the main cause of Pulis&#x27;s dismissal. Chansiri later described his appointment of Pulis as a &quot;mistake&quot;.

==Style of management==

Pulis has a reputation within the game for achieving solid results on small budgets and also maintains the proud record of never being relegated as a player, coach or manager. Throughout his managerial career Pulis has used the long ball style of play, and been known for placing an emphasis on defence and utilising set-pieces to pose a goal threat. He has a reputation for securing safety for struggling clubs, giving him a &quot;Red Adair&quot; type image which he finds frustrating. 

Stoke City chairman Peter Coates stated that Pulis had studied, and was influenced by, Italian styles of play, saying: &quot;The so-called &quot;Catenaccio&quot; defensive system interested him and the Italians haven&#x27;t done too badly, have they, with their four World Cups?&quot;.

==Personal life==
Pulis was born in the Pill area of Newport, in Wales. He was brought up there, with his father, Angelo, a steelworker, and his mother, Jean, as well as his brothers and sisters. Growing up in Newport, he supported Manchester United as well as attending matches at Cardiff City and Newport County. One of his brothers, Ray, also used to play for Newport and is currently chairman of Welsh non-league side Pill AFC. His son Anthony is a retired professional footballer who currently serves as an assistant coach for the Major League Soccer side Real Salt Lake. Pulis&#x27;s former Bristol Rovers teammate Ian Holloway is Anthony&#x27;s godfather. He also has a daughter, Stephanie whose partner, Jack Swann is an amateur footballer who played for Bournemouth Poppies. His grandfather was born in Ħaż-Żabbar, Malta before he moved to Wales.

Pulis was awarded an honorary degree at the University of Staffordshire on 10 July 2009. He received the reward for his contribution in helping sports journalism students at the university. He was also awarded the award at the University of Wales, Newport, on 15 April 2013. Pulis participated in the 2009 London Marathon to raise money for the Donna Louise Trust which assists a children hospice. He completed the marathon in 4 hours 31 minutes 57 seconds.
In May 2010, Pulis climbed to the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro with Nick Hancock to raise money for the Stoke-on-Trent based charity the Donna Louise Trust. In March 2012, he escaped a driving ban for speeding after his lawyer claimed that the city of Stoke-on-Trent would suffer as a result. On 31 May 2012, Pulis was an Olympic Torch bearer for the 2012 Summer Olympics. On 1 June 2015, Pulis completed a 450-mile rowing challenge from Tower Bridge in London to the Eiffel Tower in Paris. He once again teamed up with Nick Hancock and other team members for the Donna Louise Hospice in Stoke. The seven-day nautical challenge eventually raised over £250,000 for the charity.

Pulis is a Catholic and regularly attends church. His mother died on 13 September 2010, the same day that Stoke had a Monday night fixture against Aston Villa. Pulis made an unexpected return to the dug-out after the half-time break, having missed the first half, amidst huge applause from the home crowd. At this time, Villa were 1–0 up but goals from Kenwyne Jones and Robert Huth gave Stoke a 2–1 win and their first points of the season.

<doc id="1094970" wikidata="Q7412105" url="?curid=1094970" title="Samuel Marchbanks' Almanack">
<text>Samuel Marchbanks&#x27; Almanack, published by McClelland and Stewart in 1967, is the third and last of the Samuel Marchbanks books by Canadian novelist and journalist Robertson Davies. The other two books in this series are &quot;The Diary of Samuel Marchbanks&quot; (1947) and &quot;The Table Talk of Samuel Marchbanks&quot; (1949). Davies&#x27; writings as Samuel Marchbanks were also collected in a one-volume edition, &quot;The Papers of Samuel Marchbanks&quot; in 1985.

==Background==
Davies created the Samuel Marchbanks character whilst editor of the &quot;Peterborough Examiner&quot; newspaper in the small city of Peterborough, Ontario, northeast of Toronto. He wrote the first column under the Marchbanks pseudonym in 1944.

Davies first started work on &quot;Samuel Marchbanks&#x27; Almanack&quot; in 1953, but the manuscript was rejected by his publisher, Clarke Irwin. Davies filed the rejected manuscript away, not to return to it for a decade. He resubmitted it for publication in 1966, this time choosing McClelland and Stewart as the prospective publisher. The book is presented in the form of an almanac, based on the signs of the Zodiac.</text><links>

<text>Stian Grimseth (born 24 July 1972) is a Norwegian former weightlifter from Naustdal. He won the gold medal in snatch at the European Championships in 1996 and 1997, and the bronze medal in total at the latter. Grimseth won twelve consecutive gold medals at the Norwegian Championship from 1993 to 2004, and two additional national gold medals in 2007 and 2008. He is a two-time Olympian and competed at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics in the +108 kg event and the 2004 Athens Olympics in the +105 kg event. Grimseth retired in 2008. He was elected President of the Norwegian Weightlifting Federation in 2019.

In September 2000, Grimseth tested positive for the banned substance nandrolone and missed the 2000 Sydney Olympics. He later served a six month national and 15 month international suspension. Analyses showed that the substance came from the supplement Ribose and Grimseth filed a lawsuit against the manufacturer Universal Nutrition in 2002 that was settled four years later. 

Grimseth is an active member of the Conservative Party.

<text>Orion&#x27;s Belt is an asterism in the constellation of Orion. Other names include the Belt of Orion, the Three Kings, and the Three Sisters. The belt consists of three bright and easily identifiable collinear star systems – Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka – nearly equally spaced in a line, spanning an angular size of ~ (2.3°).

Owing to the high surface temperatures of their constituent stars, the intense light emitted is blue-white in color. In spite of their spot-like appearance, only Alnilam is a single star; Alnitak is a triple star system, and Mintaka a sextuple. All three owe their luminosity to the presence of one or more blue supergiants. The brightest as viewed from Sol is Alnilam, with an apparent magnitude of 1.69, followed by Alnitak at 1.74 and Mintaka at 2.25. The ten stars of the three systems have a combined luminosity approximately 970,000 times that of the Sun.

Orion&#x27;s Belt appears widely in historical literature and in various cultures, under many different names. It has played a central role in astral navigation in the Northern hemisphere since prehistoric times. It is considered to be among the clearest constellations in the winter sky, although it is not visible during summer, when the Sun is too visually close.

==Belt features==

The names of the three stars that comprise the belt derive from Arabic. All three were once known as () meaning &quot;string of pearls&quot; with spelling variants that include and , which was suggested by Knobel to be mistakes in transliteration or copy errors.

===Alnitak===

Alnitak (ζ Orionis) is a triple star system at the eastern end of Orion&#x27;s belt and is 1,260 light-years from the Earth. Alnitak B is a 4th-magnitude B-type star which orbits Alnitak A every 1,500 years. The primary (Alnitak A) is itself a close binary, comprising Alnitak Aa (a blue supergiant of spectral type O9.7 Ibe and an apparent magnitude of 2.0) and Alnitak Ab (a blue subgiant of spectral type B1IV and an apparent magnitude of about 4). Alnitak Aa is estimated to be up to 28 times as massive as the Sun and have a diameter 20 times greater. It is the brightest star of class O in the night sky.

===Alnilam===

Alnilam (ε Orionis) is a singular B0 supergiant, approximately 2,000 light-years away from Earth and magnitude 1.69. It is the 29th-brightest star in the sky and the fourth-brightest in Orion. It is 375,000 times more luminous than the Sun. Its spectrum serves as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.

===Mintaka===
Mintaka (δ Orionis) is a six-star system at the western end of the Belt, and the star system closest to the celestial equator. It is the nearest massive multiple stellar system, composed of three spectroscopic components. The most luminous individual star is a O9.5 II blue giant. Together, the system has a combined ~250,000 solar luminosity. Mintaka is 1,200 light-years distant, with a visual magnitude of 2.25. The innermost binary has a period of 5.732 days and a semi-major axis of approximately 32 million kilometers (0.22 AU), with the two massive stars eclipsing each other twice per completed orbit as viewed from Sol, from which regular minor dips in brightness arise.

==References in history and culture==
Richard Hinckley Allen lists many folk names for the Belt of Orion. English ones include: Jacob&#x27;s Rod or Jacob&#x27;s Staff; Peter&#x27;s Staff; the Golden Yard-arm; The L, or Ell; The Ell and Yard; the Yard-stick, and the Yard-wand; the Ellwand; Our Lady&#x27;s Wand; the Magi / the Three Kings; the Three Marys; or simply the Three Stars.

The passage &quot;Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion?&quot; is found in the Bible&#x27;s Book of Job, and a reference to Orion is found in the Book of Amos. Tennyson&#x27;s poem &quot;The Princess&quot; describes Orion&#x27;s belt as:

In China&#x27;s Classic of Poetry, the asterism, under the name &quot;Shen&quot; (参), was paired with Antares, which is known as &quot;Shang&quot; (商), to be a metaphor for two people who could never unite. This might have stemmed from the observation that both Orion&#x27;s Belt and Antares rise in the east and set in the west, but Antares only rises once Orion&#x27;s Belt has set and vice versa.

The Malay people refer to the Orion Belt as &quot;Bintang Tiga Beradik&quot; (literally &quot;three brother stars&quot;). This constellation is often used to indicate the direction of the qibla, the Islamic direction of prayer for the people of the Malay Archipelago. Like other stars, the three stars also serve as navigational guides for Malay sailors

The three stars of the belt are known in Portugal and South America as &quot;Las Tres Marías&quot; in Spanish, and as &quot;As Três Marias&quot; in Portuguese. They also mark the northern night sky when the Sun is at its lowest point, and were a clear marker for ancient timekeeping. In Mexico they are called the &quot;Los Tres Reyes Magos.&quot;

In Finnish mythology, the Belt of Orion is called &quot;Väinämöisen vyö&quot; (Väinämöinen&#x27;s Belt). The stars which appear to &quot;hang&quot; off the belt form an asterism called &quot;Kalevanmiekka&quot; (Kaleva&#x27;s sword). In pre-Christian Scandinavia, the belt was known as Frigg&#x27;s Distaff (&quot;Friggerock&quot;) or Freyja&#x27;s distaff. Similarly Jacob&#x27;s Staff and Peter&#x27;s Staff were European biblical derived terms, as were the Three Magi, or the Three Kings. Väinämöinen&#x27;s Scythe (Kalevala) and Kalevan Sword are terms from Finnish mythology.

The Seri people of northwestern Mexico call the three belt stars &quot;Hapj&quot; (a name denoting a hunter) which consists of three stars: &quot;Hap&quot; (mule deer), &quot;Haamoja&quot; (pronghorn), and &quot;Mojet&quot; (bighorn sheep). &quot;Hap&quot; is in the middle and has been shot by the hunter; its blood has dripped onto Tiburón Island.

The Māori people of New Zealand refer to the belt as &quot;Tautoru&quot; (literally &quot;string of three&quot;), and it is often seen as the stern of the constellation &quot;Te Waka o Rangi&quot; (the canoe of Rangi), which extends to its prow at &quot;Matariki&quot; (The Pleiades). The rising of &quot;Matariki&quot; in the dawn sky marks the Māori New Year in late May or early June.

The discredited archaeological Orion correlation theory postulated a connection between the positions of the Giza pyramids and those of the belt, with the linkage shown to be spurious when placed within the proper historical context.

<doc id="1094987" wikidata="Q191138" url="?curid=1094987" title="Shunsuke Nakamura">
<text>is a Japanese former professional footballer. He is currently a first-team coach of Yokohama FC. He is the only person to have been named J.League Most Valuable Player more than once, receiving the award in 2000 and 2013. Renowned as one of the best free kick takers ever and one of the greatest Japanese footballers of all time, Steve Perryman once remarked that Nakamura &quot;could open a tin of beans with his left foot&quot;.

Nakamura began his professional career with J1 League club Yokohama Marinos in 1997, eventually making 338 league appearances during two spells at the club totalling just over twelve seasons. In between his spells at Marinos, Nakamura played in Europe with Espanyol, Celtic, and Reggina. During his time at Celtic, he became one of the best Asian players to have ever played in Europe; he was nominated for the 2007 Ballon d&#x27;Or, was named Scottish Player of the Year and SFWA Footballer of the Year in 2007, and became the first Japanese player to score in the UEFA Champions League. His team accomplishments at Celtic include winning the Scottish Premier League in 2006, 2007, and 2008, the Scottish League Cup in 2006 and 2009, and the Scottish Cup in 2007.

Nakamura has 98 caps and 24 goals for the Japan national football team, including appearances in the FIFA World Cup finals in 2006 and 2010 and winning the AFC Asian Cup in 2000 and 2004; he was named Most Valuable Player of the 2004 competition. He also appeared in the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship as a member of the Japan under-20 team and the 2000 Summer Olympics as a member of the Japan under-23 team.

==Early life==
Born and raised in Yokohama, Japan, Nakamura began playing football competitively at age 5 with local junior club side Misono FC, where his playmaking abilities already garnered attention from locals. In fifth grade, he was selected for Yokohama&#x27;s city junior all-star team&#x27;s tour of the Soviet Union, even though the team was only meant to include sixth graders.

At age 12 in 1991, Nakamura joined the youth setup of , one of the predecessors of the club known today as Yokohama F. Marinos. While training at the youth setup, Nakamura was already honing his dead-ball technique, practising free kicks for an hour every day outside of team practice; his coaches also acknowledged he had good ball skills and technique. However, at that time Nakamura was physically underdeveloped compared to his teammates and struggled to transition to the youth level, and eventually was not chosen for the youth team.

Rather than continue on the fringes of Nissan&#x27;s youth setup, Nakamura instead decided to enroll at in Kawasaki, despite the school being a two-and-a-half-hour commute each way. Nakamura led Tōkō Gakuen to Japan&#x27;s national high school football tournament in 1995 and to the tournament final in 1996. It was his performance there that earned him a call-up to the Japan under-20 team for the 1996 AFC Youth Championship and subsequently for the 1997 FIFA World Youth Championship.

By his graduation from Tōkō Gakuen in 1997, Nakamura had attracted interest from several top-flight Japanese clubs, including offers from Júbilo Iwata, Verdy Kawasaki, and Gamba Osaka.

==Club career==

===Yokohama Marinos===
In 1997, Nakamura chose to sign with J.League Division 1 club Yokohama Marinos, the club whose youth setup he had left only a few years earlier. Nakamura made his début with Marinos on 8 March in a J.League Cup match against Verdy Kawasaki and his league début on 16 April against Gamba Osaka. Nakamura finished his rookie season with 31 appearances and 5 goals.

Nakamura had his break-out season the following year in 1998, making 37 appearances and scoring 10 goals; his playmaking ability in creating scoring chances for teammates also contributed to Nakamura being considered one of the best young players in Japan. In 2000, Nakamura had his best season in Yokohama, recording 5 goals and 11 assists in league play, helping Marinos to the first-stage championship; Nakamura was awarded J.League Most Valuable Player for his contributions. The following year, Nakamura made 31 appearances and scored 5 goals in all competitions, including 6 appearances and 2 goals in the 2001 J.League Cup, which the Marinos won.

Due to his success, Nakamura became the subject of transfer target rumours from a number of European clubs including Real Madrid and several Lega Calcio sides such as Reggina, Chievo, Perugia, Napoli, Lecce, and Atalanta. Nakamura felt he had to leave Japan and play in Europe to further develop and advance his career, especially after the disappointment of being left off of Japan&#x27;s 2002 World Cup squad. Nakamura left Marinos partway through the 2002 season to join Reggina, newly promoted to Serie A, after the clubs agreed to a 6-month loan and US$3.5 million transfer fee. Prior to his departure from Marinos, Nakamura remained in top form, scoring 4 goals in 8 appearances.

===Reggina===
Nakamura had come to the attention of Reggina scouts after an international match against Honduras during the 2002 Kirin Cup in which Nakamura had a standout performance and scored two goals. Reggina gained promotion to Serie A after the 2001–02 season and had already been looking to sign a marquee player for some time. It is said that, on the day Reggina secured promotion, then-Chairman Pasquale Foti had already called the Marinos to inquire about a Nakamura transfer while Reggina&#x27;s players were still on the pitch celebrating.

Expectations for Nakamura were very high; the prestigious number 10 shirt was even taken from teammate Francesco Cozza and given to Nakamura, and the club sold 25,000 Nakamura shirts in the first five months he was at the club. Nakamura responded by scoring in three consecutive matches early in the season; in league play, Nakamura finished the season with 32 appearances and tied for the team lead with 7 goals, helping Reggina narrowly avoid relegation (Reggina defeated Atalanta in the relegation playoff).

Nakamura struggled with injuries in 2003 and was limited to just 18 appearances in the 2003–04 season (these injuries also caused him to miss a 2003 Confederations Cup game against Colombia and national team duty in November 2003). Additionally, Reggina underwent four managerial changes in just Nakamura&#x27;s first two years at the club; Walter Mazzarri, hired in the summer of 2004, would already be Nakamura&#x27;s fifth manager at Reggina. The frequent changes resulted in Nakamura mostly coming off the bench during the 2003–04 season and not fitting in well under Mazzarri in 2004–05 when Reggina only scored 36 goals in their entire league campaign, with Nakamura only managing to contribute two goals (although each came in crucial 1–0 league victories in a season where Reggina finished only 2 points clear of the relegation zone). Coupled with Reggina&#x27;s struggle to avoid relegation every season that he had been at the club, Nakamura became concerned he was regressing from top-level football and decided it was time to move on.

===Celtic===
Nakamura expressed interest in playing in Spain and media reports linked him to La Liga sides Atlético Madrid and Deportivo as well as Bundesliga clubs Borussia Dortmund and Borussia Mönchengladbach in the summer of 2005. Other European clubs including Leeds United, Lazio, and Parma reportedly had also expressed interest during Nakamura&#x27;s time at Reggina, but Nakamura ultimately chose to join Scottish Premier League runners-up Celtic.

New manager Gordon Strachan became interested in acquiring Nakamura due to his national team appearances in the 2005 Confederations Cup, in particular for his performance against Brazil in which Nakamura scored a goal and helped Japan to a 2–2 draw. The deal with Celtic was completed on 29 July 2005 for a reported transfer fee of £2.5 million, although Strachan has claimed the actual fee was far lower; part of the discrepancy may be due to the deal involving Celtic securing the player&#x27;s image rights with a view to enhancing the club&#x27;s profile and merchandising sales in the Far East. In welcoming Nakamura to the club, Strachan stated that Nakamura &quot;has got imagination and he sees passes other people can&#x27;t see.&quot;

====2005–06 season====

Nakamura joined Celtic at a time of relative crisis for the club and new manager Strachan. Celtic had been eliminated from European competition after being unable to overcome a shock 0–5 first leg defeat to Artmedia Bratislava in the second qualifying round of the 2005–06 Champions League and also had an inauspicious start to the league season, needing an injury time equaliser from Craig Beattie just to draw with Motherwell in the league opener. For this reason, Strachan immediately inserted Nakamura into the match day line-up for the second league game of the season against Dundee United on 6 August, despite Nakamura not being match fit as he had not played since the Confederations Cup earlier in the summer. Nevertheless, Nakamura had an excellent debut and was named Man of the Match, earning a standing ovation from the home Celtic support when he was substituted in the 84th minute. Both Tommy Burns and Neil Lennon, at the time first-team coach and club captain, respectively, have credited Nakamura&#x27;s arrival at Celtic with helping turn around Celtic&#x27;s disappointing start to the season.

Nakamura finished his debut season at Celtic with 38 appearances, 6 goals, and 10 assists. His creativity, as well as his work ethic and composure under pressure, won praise from teammates, manager Gordon Strachan and Celtic supporters. In reviewing Nakamura&#x27;s debut season, Strachan said that Nakamura&#x27;s &quot;touch and vision were outstanding... In goal assists, I really do not think there is a player in Scotland to touch him.&quot; In his first season with Celtic, Nakamura won his first major club titles, the Scottish Premier League and Scottish League Cup.

====2006–07 season====

In his second season at Celtic, Nakamura played his debut Champions League game on 13 September against Manchester United at Old Trafford. He scored from a free kick to bring the game level at 2–2, making him the first Japanese footballer to score a goal in the Champions League, although Celtic eventually lost 3–2. On 14 October, in a league game against Dundee United at Tannadice, Nakamura scored the first hat-trick of his Celtic career and won the Man of the Match award; the game ended 4–1 in Celtic&#x27;s favour.

On 21 November, Nakamura scored perhaps the most important goal of his career with a 30-yard free kick against Manchester United at Celtic Park in a crucial Champions League game, leading to Celtic qualifying for the Champions League knockout stage for the first time. Sky Sports pundit and Southampton legend Matt Le Tissier later ranked Nakamura&#x27;s free kick as among the best five set-piece goals he has ever seen. On 26 December, Nakamura chipped the ball over Dundee United&#x27;s goalkeeper Derek Stillie at Celtic Park; the goal earned Nakamura the SPL Goal of the Season award. It was Nakamura&#x27;s performance in the final 20 minutes of the game which allowed Celtic to escape with a point, prompting Gordon Strachan to proclaim him &quot;a genius&quot;.

On 25 February, during the Scottish Cup quarter-final between Celtic and Inverness Caledonian Thistle, Nakamura broke a bone in his left hand after an Inverness player stepped on it. Nevertheless, Nakamura played in the next game on 3 March against Dunfermline Athletic. &quot;Hoops&quot; manager Gordon Strachan insisted that Celtic couldn&#x27;t play the second leg of the Champions League match against A.C. Milan in the San Siro without him. He played in both legs of the fixture, the first of which was a 0–0 draw at Celtic Park, with Milan going on to win the tie 1–0 after extra-time at the San Siro.

On 22 April, Celtic won their 41st league championship, and second in a row. The title was won in dramatic fashion by an injury time free kick from Nakamura in a 2–1 victory against Kilmarnock. The result left Celtic 13 points clear of Rangers with four matches remaining. Quite fittingly, later that day Nakamura was recognised by his peers with the Scottish Player of the Year award. This was followed in May with the SFWA Footballer of the Year award and both Players&#x27; Player of the Year award and the Fans&#x27; Player of the Year award at Celtic&#x27;s own end of season awards ceremony.

Due to Nakamura&#x27;s form, transfer rumours again swirled during the summer window suggesting that Nakamura might exercise a release clause in his contract to join one of Europe&#x27;s other elite clubs, including Liverpool; however, Nakamura reiterated his desire to remain at Celtic.

====2007–08 season====
Nakamura featured little in the first part of Celtic&#x27;s 2007–08 campaign due to a knee injury which was initially picked up in a Champions League qualifying match against Spartak Moscow in August 2007. Nakamura attempted to play through the injury, including coming on as an 85th-minute substitute in a Champions League group stage match against A.C. Milan and being involved in the buildup to Scott McDonald&#x27;s injury time winner. However, Nakamura wound up repeatedly aggravating the injury, including in a match against Motherwell on 27 October, after which an MRI revealed nerve damage next to a knee ligament and Nakamura sat out for nearly three months. During this time, Celtic slipped from the top of the table into second place; teammate Artur Boruc called Nakamura&#x27;s absence the &quot;big difference&quot; in Celtic&#x27;s drop in form. Nakamura returned to play on 12 January, for Celtic&#x27;s Scottish Cup match against Stirling Albion, in which he scored a goal.

On 16 April, in a crucial Old Firm league game that Celtic had to win in order to prevent Glasgow rivals Rangers from winning the league title, Nakamura scored his first goal against Rangers, making him the first ever Japanese player to score in an Old Firm game. Typically, it was a fantastic goal, this time being a 30-yard volley. He later had a goal bound effort cleared off the line by a Carlos Cuéllar handball in the same match; although McDonald missed the ensuing penalty, Celtic eventually won the game 2–1. Celtic won the league title on the last day of the season, their third title in a row.

====2008–09 season====
On 13 September 2008, Nakamura played his 100th Scottish Premier League match in a 4–2 victory against Motherwell.

On 28 February 2009, he scored a hat trick against St Mirren in a 7–0 win.

===Espanyol===

Media assumed that Nakamura would return to his hometown club Yokohama F. Marinos after his four-year contract with Celtic expired at the end of June 2009; however, negotiations broke down over contract terms. On 22 June, Nakamura instead agreed to a two-year contract with La Liga side Espanyol.

Nakamura made his debut with Espanyol in the first league match of the 2009–10 season against Athletic Bilbao, playing the entire game. However, as the season went on Nakamura lost his place in the first team, spending significant time on the bench and with most of his appearances being as a substitute.

By December, Espanyol staff expressed concerns about Nakamura&#x27;s slow adaptation to Spain and Spanish football, with manager Mauricio Pochettino even suggesting that most of the issues were cultural. Despite assurances from Espanyol as late as January that Nakamura still had a future at the club, Espanyol acknowledged that during the winter transfer window they had accepted a bid from Middlesbrough, who wanted to reunite Nakamura with new manager Gordon Strachan but there were questions about whether Nakamura would accept playing for a club in the second tier. By the following month Espanyol had transfer-listed Nakamura; media reports cited language and communication problems. On 26 February, Marinos agreed to a €1 million transfer fee. Nakamura acknowledged that his return to Marinos was largely due to ensuring playing time so that he would be selected and ready for the 2010 World Cup.

===Yokohama F. Marinos===
Nakamura rejoined Yokohama F. Marinos for the 2010 J.League season - 8 years after leaving the club to play in Europe. Nakamura appeared in 32 of Marinos&#x27; 34 league games in his first season back at the club, including 31 starts and 5 goals.

In 2011, Nakamura was appointed captain of Marinos and led the club to its best point total (56) since Marinos last won the league in 2004.

During the 2013 season, Nakamura made 33 appearances and scored 10 goals in league play. He also made 10 appearances and scored 2 goals in the 2013 Emperor&#x27;s Cup, which the Marinos won. His league goal tally included a free kick goal against Oita Trinita on 27 October, Nakamura&#x27;s 17th direct free kick goal in J1 League, surpassing Yasuhito Endo for the all-time league record. However, Nakamura was sidelined with injury late in the season and the Marinos lost three of their final four games, finishing one point behind Sanfrecce Hiroshima in the title race. Nakamura described Marinos&#x27; collapse as the &quot;worst moment&quot; of his career. Nevertheless, Nakamura was awarded J.League Most Valuable Player for his contributions, becoming the first and only multiple-time winner and, at the time, the oldest recipient of the award.

During the 2016 season, Nakamura became the longest-serving captain in Marinos history, passing Masami Ihara. He also scored free kick goals against Avispa Fukuoka on 5 March and against Gamba Osaka on 2 April, his 21st and 22nd direct free kick goals in J.League, further extending the all-time league record.

After the end of the 2016 season, J1 League rivals Júbilo Iwata made a multi-year contract offer to Nakamura. This led to media speculation in December that Nakamura was unhappy at Marinos due to interference in both player and staff personnel decisions by City Football Group, who had taken a 20% stake in Marinos in 2014. Júbilo Iwata confirmed signing Nakamura on 8 January. Nakamura reiterated his desire to retire with boyhood club Marinos - the only club he had played for in J.League - and expressed disappointment that he never won a league title with Marinos, but cited the ongoing stakeholder interference as creating an atmosphere where &quot;every day there were things I felt were wrong&quot; and he could not &quot;face football properly&quot;. Nakamura reportedly accepted an annual wage of ¥80 million from Júbilo Iwata despite a contract extension offer from Marinos worth ¥120 million annually. Marinos general manager publicly expressed regret at the club&#x27;s failure to re-sign Nakamura, saying &quot;We absolutely cannot allow something like this to happen again.&quot; A Marinos official reportedly stated that due to Nakamura&#x27;s popularity with fans, his departure could result in a one-third drop in Marinos annual revenue.

===Júbilo Iwata===
Nakamura joined Júbilo Iwata for the 2017 season. He scored his first goal for Júbilo in a match against Omiya Ardija on 11 March, scoring from a direct free kick to bring his record J.League tally to 23; the goal was later nominated for J.League Goal of the Month for the February–March period. Nakamura followed up the nomination by winning J.League Goal of the Month for April for his 30-yard strike against Kashima Antlers on 22 April. However his opportunity to play decreased in 2018 season. In 2019 season, he played only 2 matches until July.

===Yokohama FC===
On 11 July 2019, Nakamura moved to J2 League club Yokohama FC. As he immediately become one of the most experienced figures in the locker room, alongside Kazuyoshi Miura, Nakamura made six appearances in the 2019 season, scoring one goal as Yokohama finished second in the league (behind only title winners Kashiwa Reysol) and went on to win promotion back to the J1 League.

After ten more appearances during the 2020 season, with his team finishing 15th in the table, during the 2021 season Nakamura played twelve more matches (plus one game each in the League Cup and the Emperor&#x27;s Cup) as Yokohama finished bottom of the league and got relegated. However, on 22 December 2021, the club announced that the midfielder had just extended his contract with them for one more year.

=== Retirement ===
Nakamura announced his retirement from football on 17 October 2022.

==International career==
===Youth national teams===
Nakamura&#x27;s national team career with Japan started in 1996 as the only high school player selected to the Under-19 team for the Asia Youth Championship. The following year, he was a member of Japan&#x27;s Under-20 team that finished in the final 8 of the 1997 World Youth Championship.

In 1999, Nakamura was selected a member of Japan&#x27;s Under-23 team that won all its Asian qualifying matches in the run up to the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney. Nakamura formed a lethal combination in the attacking midfield with Shinji Ono on a team that would form the core of the Japan national team, and included Atsushi Yanagisawa, Junichi Inamoto and Naohiro Takahara. In Sydney, Japan reached the quarterfinal round.

===Under Troussier===
Nakamura made his senior national team debut on 13 February 2000, in an Asian Cup qualifier match against Singapore. He scored his first national team goal against Brunei in the very next match on 16 February 2000, also in Asian Cup qualifying.

After playing a key role in Japan&#x27;s championship at the 2000 Asian Cup, Nakamura appeared to have cemented his place in the national team, having played every match of the tournament. However, his national team career took a sharp turn in a friendly match on 25 March 2001, a humiliating 5–0 loss to France. He did not play for the team led by manager Philippe Troussier again until almost a year later, in a friendly match against Ukraine on 21 March 2002.

Although Nakamura played in four friendly matches leading up to the 2002 World Cup Finals, he was left out of the 23-man squad to the disappointment of fans. In the second to last warm up match for the World Cup against Honduras, he scored two goals, one of them a curling shot made directly from a corner kick. However, he picked up a knee injury against Honduras and did not play in the final warm up match, a 3–0 loss against Norway, and was ultimately not picked for the World Cup squad.

Despite Nakamura&#x27;s talents, Troussier could not find a place for him in his rigid, defensive-minded system. He believed Nakamura lacked the physique and stamina to play either the center or the left of the midfield, and had a surplus of players at both positions.

===Under Zico===
After the World Cup, Troussier resigned as manager of Japan, and was replaced by former Brazil and Kashima Antlers star Zico. The new coach immediately brought the talented player back to the national team, starting Nakamura in his debut against Jamaica.

Zico has lauded Nakamura&#x27;s improvement since 2002, especially his physical development, stating, &quot;Unquestionably, he has improved a great deal since his move to Serie A. He is the soul of our midfield.&quot; Nakamura has flourished under Zico&#x27;s attacking style and earned his place as the central playmaker. He led Japan to the championship at Asian Cup 2004, where he was named Most Valuable Player, and qualification for the 2006 World Cup Finals. Nakamura also starred for Japan in the 2003 and 2005 Confederations Cup, scoring a total of 4 goals in 5 matches.

Nakamura was suspended for the World Cup qualification match against North Korea on 8 June 2005 that clinched Japan&#x27;s place in the 2006 Finals, he nonetheless played a key role in the qualifying run and had replaced Hidetoshi Nakata as the main playmaker in Japan&#x27;s attack during that period.

In the 2006 FIFA World Cup Nakamura scored the controversial opening goal in Japan&#x27;s first game against Australia, which Australia came back to win 3–1.

After the 2010 World Cup, Nakamura retired from international football.

==Style of play==
A versatile playmaker, with good feet, Nakamura was capable of playing in several midfield positions, including in the centre of the pitch or out wide, although he normally played as an attacking midfielder behind the forwards. A left-footed player, Nakamura was renowned for his creativity and long range passing ability, as well as his accuracy from free kicks, making a name for himself as a set-piece specialist.

==Managerial career==
On 18 January 2023, it was announced that Nakamura would become the first team coach of Yokohama FC ahead of the 2023 season.

==Personal life==
Nakamura married a former Japanese celebrity in 2004. That same year, his first son was born. His second son was born on 15 January 2008 in Glasgow, Scotland. According to the &quot;Evening Times&quot;, he is a fan of the &quot;Grand Theft Auto&quot; and &quot;Gran Turismo&quot; video game series. He has appeared on the front cover (some of them with Zico) of the Japanese releases of Konami&#x27;s &quot;Winning Eleven&quot; video game series (&quot;WE 5&quot;, &quot;WE 9&quot;, &quot;WE 9: Ubiquitous Evolution&quot; and &quot;WE 10&quot;) in 2001, 2005 and 2006. He also appeared on the front cover of Namco&#x27;s &quot;Football Kingdom Trial Edition&quot; in 2004. He is the paid promoter of the Yamada electronics chain. His current boot sponsor is Adidas. Nakamura has illustrated the precision of his free kicks with novelty performances on television, including knocking ornaments off the top of a wedding cake without affecting the cake itself and striking a ball through the window of a moving bus.

<doc id="1095005" wikidata="Q36759" url="?curid=1095005" title="Teochew Min">
<text>Teochew, also known as Teo-Swa (or Chaoshan), is a Southern Min language spoken by the Teochew people in the Chaoshan region of eastern Guangdong and by their diaspora around the world. It is sometimes referred to as &quot;Chiuchow&quot;, its Cantonese rendering, due to English romanization by colonial officials and explorers. It is closely related to Hokkien, as it shares some cognates and phonology with Hokkien.

Teochew preserves many Old Chinese pronunciations and vocabulary that have been lost in some of the other modern varieties of Chinese. As such, Teochew is described as one of the most conservative Chinese languages.

==History and geography==
Historically, the Teochew prefecture included modern prefecture-level cities of Chaozhou, Jieyang and Shantou. In China, this region is now known as Teoswa. Parts of the Hakka-speaking Meizhou city, such as Dabu County and Fengshun, were also parts of the Teochew prefecture and contain pocket communities of Teochew speakers.

As the Teochew region was one of the major sources of Chinese emigration to Southeast Asia during the 18th to 20th centuries, a considerable Overseas Chinese community in that region is Teochew-speaking. In particular, the Teochew people settled in significant numbers in Thailand, Cambodia and Laos, where they form the largest Chinese sub-language group. Additionally, there are many Teochew-speakers among Chinese communities in Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia (especially in the states of Johor, Malacca, Penang, Kedah and Selangor with significant minorities in Sarawak) and Indonesia (especially in West Kalimantan). Waves of migration from Teochew region to Hong Kong, especially after the communist victory of the Chinese Civil War in 1949, has also resulted in the formation of a community there, although most descendants now primarily speak Cantonese and English as a result of colonialism and assimilation to the dominant Cantonese culture.

Teochew speakers are also found among overseas Chinese communities in Japan and the Western world (notably in the United States, Canada, Australia, United Kingdom, France and Italy), a result of both direct emigration from the Chaoshan region to these nations and also secondary emigration from Southeast Asia.

In Singapore, Teochew remains the ancestral language of many Chinese Singaporeans, with Chinese of Teochew descent making up second largest Chinese group in Singapore, after the Hoklo. Despite this many Teochew people, particularly the younger generations, are shifting towards English and Mandarin as their main spoken language. This is due to the Singapore government&#x27;s stringent bilingual policy that promotes English as the official language of education, government and commerce and promotes Mandarin at the expense of other Chinese languages. Some Teochew assimilated with the larger Hokkien community and speak Hokkien rather than Teochew due to Hokkien&#x27;s prominent role as a lingua franca previously among the Singaporean Chinese community.

==Classification==
Teochew is a Southern Min language. As with other Sinitic languages, it is not mutually intelligible with Mandarin, Cantonese or Shanghainese. It has only limited intelligibility with Hokkien. Even within the Teochew dialects, there is substantial variation in phonology between different regions and between different Teochew communities overseas.

The dialects of Teochew include:
* Northern Teochew, or Chaozhou division (), including:
** Teochew proper (), spoken in urban Chaozhou (Xiangqiao District); a similar dialect is spoken in Chenghai
** Kekyeo dialect (), spoken in urban Jieyang (Rongcheng District); related dialects are spoken in adjacent areas in Jiedong, Jiexi, as well as in northern parts of Puning and Chaoyang
** Swatow dialect (), spoken in urban Shantou (Jinping and Longhu)
** Raoping dialect (), spoken in Raoping County
* Southern Teochew, or Chaoyang-Puning division (), including:
** Teoyeo dialect (), spoken in the historical Teoyeo (Chaoyang) county, which includes modern Chaoyang, Chaonan, and Haojiang
** Puning dialect (), spoken in urban Puning
** Huilai dialect (), spoken in Huilai County

Some classifications consider the Hai Lok Hong dialect a part of Teochew (as the third branch), while others consider it a part of Hokkien or an independent Southern Min variety.

In the Namoa island, there are two dialects, both distinct from the mainland Teochew, with Western Namoa dialect inclining towards the Northern Teochew, and Eastern Namoa dialect showing Hokkien influence, as this part of the island was included in Zhangzhou prefecture in 16—19 centuries.

Chawan dialect, spoken in Fujian along the Guangdong border, is quite different from other southern dialects of Hokkien. It has some lexical influence from Teochew and relatively higher mutual intelligibility with it, yet in other aspects it clusters more with Hokkien than Teochew.

The main criterion in the classification of Teochew dialects is the presence or absence of the vowel . It is found in Northern Teochew in words like &quot;hṳ̂&quot; 魚 &#x27; &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;sṳ̄&quot; 事 &#x27; &quot;thing; matter&quot;. Southern Teochew has instead (&quot;hû&quot; 魚 &#x27;, &quot;sū&quot; 事 &#x27;). Hai Lok Hong and Eastern Namoa dialects have or instead, depending on the etymology of the word (&quot;hî&quot; 魚 &#x27;, but &quot;sū&quot; 事 &#x27;), similarly to the Chiangchew Hokkien. Southern Teochew may be further divided into Huilai—Puning dialects and Teoyeo dialects, based on their tone contours.
The prestige dialects of Teochew all belong to the Northern branch. The Northern Teochew dialects are mutually intelligible between each other, but less so with the Southern branch.

Various stereotypes and cultural traits are associated with different Teochew dialects. For instance, within the Shantou city, the urban Swatow dialect is perceived as &quot;energetic&quot;, &quot;gentle&quot;, but also &quot;snobbish&quot; or &quot;pretentious&quot; by speakers of other dialects; the Chenghai dialect (similar to urban Chaozhou dialect) is perceived as &quot;soft&quot;, &quot;cute&quot;, and &quot;high-pitched&quot;; the Teoyeo dialect is perceived as &quot;harsh&quot;, &quot;aggressive&quot; and &quot;countrified&quot;.

== Writing system ==
Written Southern Min is known since at least the 16th century. The earliest known work is a 1566 edition of the &quot;Tale of the Lychee Mirror&quot;, a folk drama written in a mixture of Teochew and Chinchew Hokkien.

Teochew writing is neither standardized nor is widely used. In Imperial China, most writing was conducted in Classical Chinese, while vernacular writing was only used in novels, songbooks and opera scripts. After the Xinhai revolution, only written Mandarin was supported by the government, while speakers of other Sinitic languages, including Teochew, remaining largely illiterate in their own tongues.

Teochew rime dictionaries appeared relatively late, the earliest of them being &quot;Fifteen consonants of Teochew language&quot; (, 1911) by Chio Ju-lim () and &quot;Fifteen consonants of Teochew sound&quot; (, 1913) by Teo See-tiang ().

=== Chinese characters ===
Most of the Teochew vocabulary can be traced back to Old Chinese, and thus can be written using Chinese characters. There are different ways to write words that do not have a clearly associated etymological character, including:
* using a character with the same meaning regardless of its reading
* borrowing a phonetically close character regardless of its meaning
* inventing a new character
* attempting to find an original character

Teochew shares characters with Hokkien for cognate words, but it is also influenced by the Cantonese written tradition.

=== Romanization ===

There are two principal romanization systems for Teochew:
* &quot;Pe̍h-ūe-jī&quot;, originally invented for Hokkien in the 19th century and adapted for Teochew (particularly the Swatow dialect)
* &quot;Peng&#x27;im&quot;, invented in the 1960s and based on the &quot;Hanyu Pinyin&quot; romanization for Mandarin

While &quot;Peng&#x27;im&quot; has some presence in academic works published in PRC, many publications on Teochew use their custom IPA-based romanizations.




==Phonetics and phonology==
===Consonants===

Teochew, like other Southern Min varieties, is one of the few modern Sinitic languages which have voiced obstruents (stops, fricatives and affricates); however, unlike Wu and Xiang Chinese, the Teochew voiced stops and fricatives did not evolve from Middle Chinese voiced obstruents, but from nasals.

The voiced stops and and also are voicelessly prenasalized , , , respectively.

The voiced affricate , initial in such words as &quot;jī&quot; &#x27; (/dzi˩/), &quot;jĭ&quot; &#x27; (/dzi˧˥/), &quot;jiâng&quot; &#x27; (/dziaŋ˥/), &quot;jia̍k&quot; &#x27; (/dziak˦/) loses its affricate property with some younger speakers abroad, and is relaxed to [z].

Unlike in Hokkien, nasal initials in Teochew are not generally considered allophones of the voiced plosives, as nasals are relatively more common in Teochew and have less usage restrictions. For example, Teochew allows for syllables like &quot;nge̍k&quot; 逆 , which are impossible in Hokkien.

In Southern dialects of Teochew, labial initials (/p/, /pʰ/, /b/, /m/) have labiodental allophones ([pf], [pfʰ], [bv], [mv~ɱ]) before /-u-/.
=== Syllables ===

Syllables in Teochew contain an onset consonant, a medial glide, a nucleus, usually in the form of a vowel, but can also be occupied by a syllabic consonant like [ŋ], and a final consonant. All the elements of the syllable except for the nucleus are optional, which means a vowel or a syllabic consonant alone can stand as a fully-fledged syllable.

==== Onsets ====

All the consonants except for the glottal stop ʔ shown in the consonants chart above can act as the onset of a syllable; however, the onset position is not obligatorily occupied.

==== Finals ====
Teochew finals consist maximally of a medial, nucleus and coda. The medial can be /i-/ or /u-/, the nucleus can be a monophthong or diphthong, and the coda can be a nasal or a stop. A syllable must consist minimally of a vowel nucleus or syllabic nasal.

In most dialects of Teochew, historical codas and are merged with and . They were still present in mainstream Teochew in the 19th century, but now they are found only in certain peripheral dialects of Teochew, as well as in Hai Lok Hong Min.

Chaozhou /ieng/ and /iek/ are used in syllables that previously had /ien/ and /iet/, e.g. 顯 is different from 響 in Chaozhou (as /hieŋ˥˧/ and /hiaŋ˥˧/) and Hokkien (as /hien˥˧/ and /hiaŋ˥˧/), but not Swatow (both are /hiaŋ˥˧/).

Apart from the aforementioned rhymes, there are a few limitedly used finals with both glottal stop and nazalization, usually found in ideophones and interjections, e.g. &quot;he̍hⁿ&quot; /hẽʔ˥˦/ &quot;agitated; confused&quot;, &quot;hauhⁿ&quot; /hãũʔ˧˨/ &quot;to eat in large bites&quot;, &quot;khuàhⁿ-ua̍hⁿ&quot; /kʰũãʔ˨˩˨꜒꜔.ũãʔ˥˦/ &quot;comfortable&quot;.

=== Tones ===
Teochew, like other Chinese varieties, is a tonal language. Like other Southern Min varieties, Teochew has split the Middle Chinese four tone into two registers (four &quot;dark tones&quot; and four &quot;light tones&quot;). The tones are numbered from 1 through 8, either in the &quot;dark—light&quot; order (the checked tones are 7 and 8) or in the &quot;level—rising—departing—entering&quot; order (the checked tones are 4 and 8). This section follows the second order, as used in Peng&#x27;im.
Depending on the position of a word in a phrase, the tones can change and adopt extensive tone sandhi.

==== Northern Teochew ====
Northern Teochew dialects are not too different from each other in their tones. There are small differences in pronunciation of the tone ⑦, which can vary between low falling (21 ˨˩) and low level (22 ˨) among different dialects and individual speakers.

There are minor differences in tone sandhi among the Northern Teochew dialects:
* The most important difference is that the dark departing tone (③) becomes high falling (53 ˥˧) in Chaozhou and Jieyang and high level (55 ˥) in Shantou and Raoping.
* In Chaozhou, the two level tones (① and ⑤) become slightly rising in sandhi (34 ˧˦ and 23 ˨˧ respectively), rather than level (33 ˧ and 22 ˨ ~ 21 ˨˩) as in other dialects.
* In Jieyang, Chenghai and Chaozhou, the sandhi of tones ②, ③, and ④ have two pronunciations, one being slightly higher (35 ˧˥, 53 ˥˧, 54 ˥˦), used before syllables with high-onset tones (⑤ 55 ˥, ② 53 ˥˧, and ⑧ 54 ˥˦), and another one slightly lower (24 ˨˦, 42 ˦˨, 43 ˦˧), used before all other tones. In Shantou and Raoping, these tones have the same post-sandhi value regardless of the next syllable&#x27;s tone.
* In Jieyang, Chenghai and Chaozhou, the pronunciation of tone ② will become low level (21 ˨˩) after post-sandhi syllables of tone ②, ③, and ④, which is caused by the assimilation of falling tones.

The light departing tone (⑦) after sandhi is usually merged with the post-sandhi tone ⑤ or ⑥, depending on the dialect. For convenience, since the difference between them is still not large, all three light tones after sandhi may be described as identical and equal to pre-sandhi tone ⑦. The sandhi rules for Northern Teochew may be simplified as follows:

==== Southern Teochew ====
Southern Teochew tones are noticeably diverse. Based on their tones, the Southern Teochew dialects can be divided into two broad areas: Teoyeo and Hui-Pou.


Currently, a tone shift is ongoing in the Teoyeo dialect. There is a continuum between the &quot;old accent&quot; and &quot;new accent&quot;. This shift is more advanced in urban dialects in Eastern Chaoyang (incl. Haojiang, especially the Dahao dialect), among female speakers, and in the younger generations (born after the 1980s). The principal features of this shift are as follows:
* Dark level tone (①) shifts from 21 ˨˩ to 31 ˧˩.
* Light level tone (⑤) shifts from high level 44 ˦ to mid-level 33 ˧ or mid-rising 23 ˨˧.
* Dark rising tone (②) shifts from high fallig 551 ˥˥˩ to high level 55 ˥, and in urban Eastern Teoyeo dialects it can even become high rising 45 ˦˥ or 35 ˧˥.
* Dark departing tone (③) and light departing tone (⑦) are falling in a &quot;parallel&quot; pattern (53 ˥˧ and 42 ˦˨ respectively) in the old accent, while in the new accent they are still falling, but the light departing tone (⑦) is more &quot;flat&quot; (52 ˥˨ and 43 ˦˧~44 ˦ respectively).

&quot;Old&quot; Teoyeo accent is notable for the fact that out of its five non-checked tones, four tones have falling contour.

Hui-Pou dialects are more homogeneous in their tones than Teoyeo dialects. Puning and Eastern Huilai dialects have 8 tones, while Central and Western Huilai have 7 tones (tone ⑦ is merged with other tones). Some of the Huilai dialects undergo tone shift similar to that in Teoyeo dialects, but to a lesser extent (particularly, tone ② becomes high level 55 rather than high falling 53).

==== Neutral tone ====
Like Hokkien, Teochew has the neutral tone. In pronunciation, the neutral tone is considered to be identical to the light departing tone (⑦) in the respective dialect, but when the original tone of the syllable was dark rising (②), the neutral tone is identical to the dark departing tone (③), and when the original tone was an entering tone (④ or ⑧), the neutral tone is identical to the dark entering tone (④).

Some works refer to the neutral tone as &quot;left-dominant tone sandhi&quot;. However, unlike the general (&quot;right-dominant&quot;) Teochew tone sandhi, which is a regular phonetic change, the neutral tone is lexical and its occurrence cannot be predicted. Compare the following examples with the morpheme &quot;nî&quot; &quot;year&quot;, where some words have the neutral tone, while others preserve the original tone.
:&quot;tsâiⁿ--nî&quot; &quot;year before last&quot;
:&quot;ău--nî&quot; &quot;year after next&quot;
:&quot;tuā-tsâiⁿ--nî&quot; &quot;three years ago&quot;
:&quot;jĭ-káu--nî&quot; &quot;year 29&quot; 
but:
:&quot;kim-nî&quot; &quot;this year&quot;
:&quot;kū-nî&quot; &quot;last year&quot;
:&quot;mê-nî&quot; &quot;next year&quot;
:&quot;jĭ-tsa̍p-ngŏu-nî&quot; &quot;25 years&quot;

==Grammar==
The grammar of Teochew is similar to other Min languages, as well as some southern varieties of Chinese, especially with Hakka, Yue and Wu. The sequence &#x27;subject–verb–object&#x27; is typical, like Standard Mandarin, although the &#x27;subject–object–verb&#x27; form is also possible using particles.

=== Morphology ===

==== Pronouns ====

===== Personal pronouns =====

The personal pronouns in Teochew, like in other Chinese languages, do not show case marking, therefore &quot;uá&quot; &#x27; means both &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; and &quot;i-nâng&quot; &#x27; means &quot;they&quot; and &quot;them&quot;. The Southern Min languages, like some Mandarin dialects, have a distinction between an inclusive and exclusive we, meaning that when the addressee is being included, the inclusive pronoun &quot;náng&quot; &#x27; would be used, otherwise &quot;uáng&quot; &#x27; is employed. Outside Southern Min varieties like Teochew, no other southern Chinese variety has this distinction.


===== Possessive pronouns =====

Teochew does not distinguish the possessive pronouns from the possessive adjectives. As a general rule, the possessive pronouns or adjectives are formed by adding the genitive or possessive marker &quot;kâi&quot; to their respective personal pronouns, as summarized below:

As &quot;kâi&quot; is the generic measure word, it may be replaced by other more appropriate classifiers:

===== Demonstrative pronouns =====
Teochew has the typical two-way distinction between the demonstratives, namely the proximals and the distals. The basic determiners are &quot;tsí&quot; &#x27; &quot;this&quot; and &quot;hṳ́&quot; &#x27; &quot;that&quot;, and they require at least a classifier (generic &quot;kâi&quot; &#x27;, collective &quot;tshoh&quot; &#x27;, or another), which can be optionally preceded by a numeral.

===== Interrogative pronouns =====

==== Numerals ====
Some numerals in Teochew have two variants: the literary one and the vernacular one.

Generally, vernacular variants are used, and literary readings are limited to certain set compounds and idioms, e.g.: &quot;Sam-kok&quot; , &quot;ngóu-kim&quot; , &quot;kiú-siau&quot; , &quot;ngóu-tsháiⁿ-phiang-hung&quot; , &quot;sam-sṳ-jṳ̂-kiâⁿ&quot; , &quot;kiú-liû-sam-kàu&quot; , etc.

However, literary forms of and are more commonly used, particularly in the following cases:
* for the last digit in compound numbers:
::&quot;tsa̍p ik&quot; &quot;eleven&quot;
::&quot;saⁿ tsa̍p jĭ&quot; &quot;thirty two&quot;
* for counting tens (but not hundreds or thousands) in compound numbers
::&quot;jĭ tsa̍p ik&quot; &quot;twenty one&quot;
::but:
::&quot;tse̍k peh&quot; &quot;one hundred&quot;
::&quot;nŏ tshoiⁿ&quot; &quot;two thousands&quot;
* in ordinal numbers, names for days, and dates
::&quot;tŏiⁿ jĭ&quot; &quot;second&quot;
::&quot;tsheⁿ khî ik&quot; &quot;Monday&quot;
::&quot;tsiaⁿ gue̍h tshiu ik&quot; &quot;first day of the Lunar New Year&quot;
::&quot;jĭ-khàng-iau-poih-nî jĭ-gue̍h jĭ-hō&quot; &quot;February 2, 2018&quot;

=== Passive construction ===
In Teochew passive construction, the agent phrase &quot;by somebody&quot; always has to be present, and is introduced by the preposition &quot;khṳh&quot; &#x27; or &quot;pung&quot; &#x27;, both literally meaning &quot;to give&quot;. If the agent is not explicitly named, its position is taken by &quot;nâng&quot; (lit. &quot;a person; one; somebody&quot;).

While in Mandarin one can have the agent introducer or alone without the agent itself, in Teochew it is not grammatical to omit this dummy agent &quot;nâng&quot; .
:: (cf. Mandarin )

The agent phrase &quot;pung nâng&quot; always comes immediately after the subject, not at the end of the sentence or between the auxiliary and the past participle like in some European languages (e.g. German, Dutch).

=== Comparison ===

====Comparative construction with two or more nouns ====

Teochew, like Cantonese but unlike Hokkien, uses the construction &quot;X ADJ &quot;kuè&quot; Y&quot;, to express the comparison:
:: (cf. Cantonese )

However, due to modern influences from Mandarin, the Mandarin structure &quot;X Y ADJ&quot; has also gained popularity over the years. Therefore, the same sentence can be re-structured and becomes:
:: (cf. Mandarin )

====Comparative construction with only one noun ====

The - or -construction must involve two or more nouns to be compared; an ill-formed sentence will be yielded when only one is being mentioned:

Teochew is different from English, where the second noun being compared can be left out (&quot;Tatyana is more beautiful &quot;(than Lisa)&quot;&quot;. In cases like this, the -construction must be used instead:

The same holds true for Mandarin and Cantonese in that another structure needs to be used when only one of the nouns being compared is mentioned. Teochew and Mandarin both use a pre-modifier (before the adjective) while Cantonese uses a post-modifier (after the adjective).
* Mandarin

* Cantonese
There are two words which are intrinsically comparative in meaning, i.e. &quot;iâⁿ&quot; &#x27; &quot;to win&quot; and &quot;su&quot; &#x27; &quot;to lose&quot;. They can be used alone or in conjunction with the -structure:


Note the use of the adverbial &quot;hoh tsōi&quot; at the end of the sentence to express a higher degree.

====Equal construction ====

In Teochew, the idea of equality is expressed with the word &quot;pêⁿ&quot; &#x27; or &quot;pêⁿ-iōⁿ&quot; &#x27;:


====Superlative construction ====

To express the superlative, Teochew uses the adverb &quot;siăng&quot; &#x27; or &quot;siăng-téng&quot; &#x27;. The latter variant is usually used with a complimentary connotation.


==Vocabulary==
Teochew vocabulary consists of several layers, including:
* Pan-Sinitic words, found in most other languages of the Sinosphere (such as Hokkien, Japanese, Mandarin, Cantonese, Korean, etc), often derived from Literary Chinese or orthographically borrowed from Japanese or Mandarin
::&quot;ì-kièng&quot; &quot;opinion&quot;,
::&quot;kok-ke&quot; &quot;state; country&quot;,
::&quot;kak-hung&quot; &quot;to marry&quot;,
::&quot;khùng-nâng&quot; &quot;hard; difficult&quot;,
::&quot;seng-mĕng&quot; &quot;life&quot;,
::&quot;tāu-hū&quot; &quot;tofu&quot;
::&quot;tiĕng-uē&quot; &quot;telephone&quot;,
::&quot;tshuk-kháu&quot; &quot;exit&quot;,
::&quot;huang-uàⁿ&quot; &quot;plan; scheme&quot;,
::&quot;bûng-huè&quot; &quot;culture&quot;,
::&quot;kāng-huâ-kok&quot; &quot;republic&quot;,
::&quot;tiĕng-náu&quot; &quot;computer&quot;
* Basic words derived from Old Chinese, usually via Proto-Min; generally, they are not found in other languages of the Sinosphere, except as morphemes in compound words
::&quot;lṳ́&quot; &quot;you&quot;,
::&quot;ma̍k&quot; &quot;eye&quot;,
::&quot;tṳ̄&quot; &quot;chopsticks&quot;,
::&quot;nâng&quot; &quot;man; person&quot;,
::&quot;saⁿ&quot; &quot;shirt&quot;
* Min-specific words, usually shared with other Min languages (or at least Southern Min languages like Hokkien)
::&quot;ta&quot; &quot;dry&quot;,
::&quot;khṳ̀ng&quot; &quot;to hide&quot;,
::&quot;khṳh&quot; &quot;to give&quot;,
::&quot;lim&quot; &quot;to drink&quot;
* Teochew-specific words
::&quot;tàⁿ&quot; &quot;to say; to talk&quot;,
::&quot;ĭⁿ&quot; &quot;to sleep&quot;,
::&quot;ngà&quot; &quot;stupid; foolish&quot;,
::&quot;jṳ̂&quot; &quot;to wipe; to mop&quot;,
::&quot;tsò-nî&quot; &quot;why; how&quot;

Most of the Teochew vocabulary (around 70-80%) consists of the pan-Sinitic words. However, their proportion is much lower among the most basic words used in daily speech, as they tend to belong to the last three categories. This pattern is also seen in other languages of the Sinosphere, e.g. in Japanese, where the Sino-Japanese words constitute around 60-70% of total vocabulary, but only around 20% of words used in common speech.

=== Literary and vernacular readings ===
In Teochew, like in other Min languages, it is common for a character to have at least two readings, called &quot;literary&quot; and &quot;vernacular&quot;. The number of such doublets in Teochew is somewhat smaller than in Hokkien, due to Teochew being prone to use only vernacular readings and lose their literary counterparts.

==Relationship with Hokkien==
Teochew and Hokkien are both Southern Min languages. Hokkien, which is spoken in southern Fujian, shares many phonetic similarities with Teochew, but they have low lexical similarity. Although Teochew and Hokkien share some cognates, there are pronounced differences in most vowels with some consonant and tone shifts.
Teochew has only 51% intelligibility with the Tong&#x27;an Xiamen dialect of Hokkien (Cheng 1997), approximately the same as the percentage of intelligibility as between Russian and Ukrainian languages, while it has even lower mutual intelligibility language with other dialects of the Hokkien language.

Most Teochew people do not speak Hokkien and the majority of Hokkien and Teochew people both see themselves as a distinct ethnic groups / nation. There are a minority of Teochew people who speak Hokkien as their mother tongue, most of whom have close contact or relatives in the neighbouring three originally-Teochew counties of what is now South Fujian, which were seceded to Fujian during the early Tang dynasty and subsequently assimilated into the Hokkien population. These Hokkien-speaking Teochews are more likely to treat Teochew simply as accented dialect of Hokkien. These people usually have a strong sense of Hokkien identity.

=== Pronunciation ===
In Hokkien, denasalization of initial consonants is extensive, and sounds [m], [n], [ng] are usually viewed as allophones of /b/, /l~d/, /g/ used with nasalized rhymes. In Teochew and Hai Lok Hong, denasalization is less common.
Hokkien and Hai Lok Hong have three pairs of codas: -ng/-k, -m/-p and -n/-t. Most dialects of Teochew have merged -n/-t with -ng/-k. On the other hand, many Teochew dialects, except urban Swatow and Chenghai, do not dissimilate the Middle Chinese rhyme &quot;-jom&quot;, e.g. they have &quot;huàm&quot; , &quot;huăm&quot; , &quot;huap&quot; , while Hokkien has &quot;huàn&quot; , &quot;huǎn&quot; , &quot;huat&quot; .

Teochew (except some Southern Teochew dialects) and Hai Lok Hong have 8 citation tones, while most dialects of Hokkien have 7 tones.

In individual rhymes, the differences between Hokkien and Teochew are comparable to differences between the dialects of each language. For example, both Northern Hokkien and Northern Teochew have the /ɯ/ sound, which is not found in Southern Teochew and Southern Hokkien. Northern Hokkien and Teochew both have &quot;-ng&quot; (in Hokkien and Southern Teochew) or &quot;-ung&quot; (in Northern Teochew) rhyme in words like &quot;pn̄g/pūng&quot;, &quot;mn̂g/mûng&quot;, while Southern Hokkien and Hai Lok Hong have &quot;-uiⁿ&quot; instead ( &quot;pūiⁿ&quot;, &quot;mûi&quot;).

=== Grammar ===
Teochew grammar shows some Cantonese or Hakka influence. For example,
* Teochew uses comparative structure with &quot;-kuè&quot; &quot;to exceed, to surpass&quot;, as in Cantonese, while Hokkien uses native Min comparative construction with an adverb &quot;khah&quot; &quot;more&quot;.
* Teochew, like Cantonese, uses bare classifiers to mean &quot;this&quot;, but this usage is not typical for Hokkien.
* Teochew uses relevant classifiers to indicate possession; e.g., the phrase &quot;my book&quot; may be expressed with both &quot;uá púng tsṳ&quot; (with classifier for books) and &quot;uá kâi tsṳ&quot; (with possessive particle) in Teochew, but in Hokkien, only &quot;góa ê tsṳ&quot; is used.

Teochew differs from Hokkien in function words:
=== Vocabulary ===
Teochew has many differences with Hokkien in its basic vocabulary. Some of the differences are due to influence from Cantonese, while others are alternative yet still native Min words.

Teochew tends to use more vernacular readings where Hokkien prefers the literary readings. For instance, Hokkien uses &quot;to-siā&quot; for &quot;Thank you&quot;, with literary reading for the first character, while Teochew reads it with the vernacular reading as &quot;tsōi-siā&quot;. The character has both literary reading (Teochew &quot;ang&quot;, Hokkien &quot;an&quot;) and vernacular reading (both &quot;uaⁿ&quot;), the latter more commonly used in Teochew ( &quot;uaⁿ-tshuâng&quot;, &quot;uaⁿ-sim&quot;, &quot;uaⁿ-úng&quot;, &quot;tī-uaⁿ&quot;, etc), while being rare in Hokkien (used in a few place names: &quot;Tâng-uaⁿ&quot;, &quot;Lâm-uaⁿ&quot;, &quot;Hūi-uaⁿ&quot;).

For some characters, literary readings only exist in Hokkien (even if used exclusively for declamation of Classical Chinese texts), while many vernacular readings are used only in Teochew.

<text>Endre Ady (Hungarian: &quot;diósadi Ady András Endre,&quot; archaic English: Andrew Ady; 22 November 1877 – 27 January 1919) was a turn-of-the-century Hungarian poet and journalist. Regarded by many as the greatest Hungarian poet of the 20th century, he was noted for his steadfast belief in social progress and development and for his poetry&#x27;s exploration of fundamental questions of the modern European experience: love, temporality, faith, individuality, and patriotism.

==Biography==


Ady was born in Érmindszent, Szilágy County (part of Austria-Hungary at the time; now a village in Căuaș commune, Satu Mare County, Romania, called Adyfalva in Hungarian and Ady Endre in Romanian). He belonged to an impoverished Calvinist noble family. Endre was the second of three children. The eldest, a girl named Ilona, died at an early age. The author and poet Mariska Ady (1888-1977) was a niece of Endre Ady.

Between 1892 and 1896, Ady attended the Calvinist College in Zilah (today Zalău, Romania). On 22 March 1896, he published his first poem in the Zilah newspaper &quot;Szilágy&quot;.

He later studied law at the Reformed College in Debrecen. After dropping out, he became a journalist. He published his first poems in a volume called &quot;Versek&quot; &quot;(Poems)&quot; in 1899. He soon grew tired of Debrecen (the town later became a symbol of backwardness in his poetry) and moved to Nagyvárad (today Oradea, Romania), a city with a rich cultural life. In articles written in 1902 for the local newspaper &quot;Nagyváradi Napló&quot;, Ady paid close attention to the social features of his time. &quot;Wesselényi and a poor peasant! Perhaps unwittingly, master Fadrusz has carved a satire&quot;, he wrote, referring to the unveiling of the Wesselényi Monument.

Working as a journalist and spending time with like-minded people broadened his horizons. He published a new collection of poems in 1903, but remained relatively unknown. The turning point came in August 1903 when he met Adél Brüll Diósy, a wealthy, married Jewish woman who was living in Paris at the time but was visiting her home in Nagyvárad. &quot;Léda&quot; (as he called her in his poems) became his muse; his love for her and their visit to Paris, helped him to develop his talent. He visited Paris seven times between 1904 and 1911. When he returned after his first visit (which lasted for a year), he moved to Budapest and began work for the newspaper &quot;Budapesti Napló (Budapest Journal)&quot;, where he published more than 500 articles and plenty of poems. 

Being interested in politics, Ady became a member of the radical group &quot;Huszadik Század&quot; (Twentieth Century, or possibly Twentieth Brigade). In 1906 he published his third book of poetry, &quot;Új versek&quot; &quot;(New Poems)&quot;, which is a landmark in literature and marks the birth of modern Hungarian poetry. His fourth collection, &quot;Vér és arany&quot; &quot;(Blood and Gold)&quot;, brought him real success and critical acclaim.

In 1906 Ady decided to leave the country and went to Paris again. In 1907, he had to quit his job at &quot;Budapesti Napló&quot;.

In 1908, the first issue of a new periodical called &quot;Nyugat (The West)&quot; published a poem and an essay by him. He worked for this periodical for the rest of his life; from 1912 he was one of the editors. Also in 1908 in Nagyvárad, he was one of the founders of a literary circle called &quot;A Holnap&quot; (Tomorrow). The group published an anthology of poems of Ady and others including Mihály Babits, Gyula Juhász and Béla Balázs. The poems of this anthology met with disapproval and incomprehension. Many people attacked the anthology for containing erotic poems. In addition, Ady was criticized for his unpatriotic feelings in a poem in which he emphasized the contrast between the rich cultural life he longed for and the cruel realities of the Hungarian peasant world.

Ady disliked his name being linked with other poets, who he thought were jumping on his bandwagon. He wrote a short story, &quot;The duk-duk affair&quot;, in which he mocked those who were following the trend he was setting.

Ady was an editor and leading figure of &quot;Nyugat&quot; (West), an important Hungarian literary journal. He also wrote political articles for other journals criticizing the political situation of the time. He did not like the nationalism of the leading parties, but also criticized the anti-nationalism of the social democrats; he knew how far Hungary was behind the more developed countries, but clearly saw the faults of Western countries too.

From 1909 he often needed sanitarium treatment for his health, which was undermined by syphilis. The political situation became critical: the workers were protesting against the government, and Ady saw a revolution approaching. His personal life was also in crisis; his affair with Léda became more and more burdensome. As Ady become a prominent poet, Léda lost her leading role in the relationship. He broke up with her in April 1912.

In 1914, he met the 20-year-old Berta Boncza, with whom he had been corresponding since 1911. In 1915 they married without her father&#x27;s permission. In his poems he called her &quot;Csinszka&quot;.

==Last years==

After the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, Ady saw war approaching. Everyone he knew was enthusiastic about the war, and he was left alone with his fears and worries about the future. He published his last book of poetry in 1918. He was terminally ill when he wrote his last poem, &quot;Üdvözlet a győzőnek&quot; (Greetings to the victor). Syphilis had weakened his aorta, so that he might die at any moment from a massive haemorrhage. He was elected president of the Vörösmarty Academy, an organization of modern writers, but could not deliver his opening speech; he died in Budapest on 27 January 1919, and was buried in the city&#x27;s Kerepesi Cemetery.

==Poetry==

At the beginning of the 20th century, Hungarian poets tried to follow the folksy style of Sándor Petőfi, but most lacked his vision and talent; the style did not renew itself. Ady was the first to break from this tradition into a modern style. Although he liked to identify as a lonely, misunderstood revolutionary, most of the poets of his generation supported him, and many imitated his style.

His first two books of poetry did not show anything new; he was still under the influence of 19th-century poets such as Petőfi or János Vajda. The first elements of his own style appeared not in his poems but in his essays and other writings.

Ady was undoubtedly influenced by the works of Baudelaire and Verlaine. He often used Symbolist techniques; his recurring themes are God, Hungarian identity, and the struggle for survival in modern society. Other themes are present only in certain periods of his life (money, life and death, Léda).

<text>The Bradford Bulls are a professional rugby league club in Bradford, West Yorkshire, England, and compete in the Championship, the second tier of British rugby league. 

The club have won the League Championship six times, the Challenge Cup five times and three World Club Challenge titles. They have also won many smaller things such as The RFL Yorkshire Cup 11 times.

The club was originally founded as Bradford Northern, but were renamed Bradford Bulls in 1995. Bradford&#x27;s main rivalries are with Leeds, Halifax and Huddersfield. They have played the majority of their existence at Odsal and their traditional kit colours are white with red, amber and black chevrons.

==History==

===1863–1907: Bradford F.C.===
The original Bradford Football Club was formed in 1863 and played rugby football, subsequently joining the Rugby Football Union. Initially the club played at Horton Cricket Ground, All Saints Road but were asked to leave because of damage to the pitch. They then moved to Laisteridge Lane and later North Park Road in Manningham. A nomadic existence continued as they then went on to Peel Park, then Girlington and Apperley Bridge.

Bradford Football Club and Bradford Cricket Club bought Park Avenue in 1879 and this resulted in the club becoming &quot;Bradford Cricket, Athletic and Football Club&quot;. The club&#x27;s headquarters were at the Talbot Darley Street, and later The Alexandra, Great Horton Road. The club achieved its first major success by winning the Yorkshire Cup in 1884.

After the 1890–91 season, Bradford along with other Yorkshire Senior clubs Batley, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hull, Hunslet, Leeds, Liversedge, Manningham and Wakefield decided that they wanted their own county league starting in 1891 along the lines of a similar competition that had been played in Lancashire. The clubs wanted full control of the league but the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union would not sanction the competition as it meant giving up control of rugby football to the senior clubs.

In 1895, along with cross-town neighbours Manningham F.C., Bradford was among 22 clubs to secede from the Rugby Football Union after the historic meeting at the George Hotel in Huddersfield in response to a dispute over &quot;broken time&quot; payments to players who were thus part-time professionals. These 22 clubs formed the Northern Rugby Football Union (which eventually became the Rugby Football League) and rugby league football was born.

Bradford enjoyed some success in the new competition. In the 1903–04 Northern Rugby Football Union season, the team finished level on points with Salford at the top of the league and then won the resulting play-off 5–0. In 1905–06, Bradford beat Salford 5–0 to win the Challenge Cup and were runners-up in the Championship. In 1906–07, Bradford won the Yorkshire County Cup 8–5 against Hull Kingston Rovers.

During this time Manningham F.C. had run into financial difficulties and, despite a summer archery contest that generated enough money to ensure their survival, its members were persuaded to swap codes and play association football instead. Manningham was invited to join the Football League in 1903, in an attempt to promote football in a rugby-dominated region, and the newly renamed Bradford City A.F.C. was voted into full membership of the Second Division without having played a game of football, having a complete team or even being able to guarantee a ground. The creation of Bradford City led to demands for association football at Park Avenue too. The ground had already hosted some football matches including one in the 1880s between Blackburn Rovers and Blackburn Olympic F.C. In 1895, a Bradford side had beaten a team from Moss Side, Manchester, by 4–1 in front of 3,000 spectators. Following the change at Bradford City, a meeting was called of the Bradford FC members on 15 April 1907 to decide the rugby club&#x27;s future. An initial vote appeared to favour continuing in rugby league, but then opinion shifted towards rugby union and the chairman, Mr Briggs, used his influence to swing the committee behind the proposed move to association football. This act, sometimes referred to as &quot;The Great Betrayal&quot;, led to Bradford FC becoming the Bradford Park Avenue Association Football Club. The minority faction decided to split and form a new club to continue playing in the Northern Union, appropriately called &quot;Bradford Northern&quot;, which applied for and was granted Bradford FC&#x27;s place in the 1907–08 Northern Rugby Football Union season. Bradford Northern&#x27;s first home ground was the Greenfield Athletic Ground in Dudley Hill, to the south of the city. They based themselves at the Greenfield Hotel.

===1907–1963: Bradford Northern===
Northern moved to Birch Lane in 1908. Bradford council offered the club a site for a new stadium between Rooley Lane and Mayo Avenue in 1927. However the NRFU said the site was too small and the club kept on looking. Before moving to Odsal, Bradford Northern had had two other homes at Greenfield Athletic Ground in Dudley Hill and at Birch Lane which was part of the Bowling Old Lane cricket ground, although at times they also had to hire Valley Parade as the capacity at Birch Lane was insufficient for large matches.

On 20 June 1933 Bradford Northern signed a ten-year lease with Bradford council for a former quarry being used as a waste dump at Odsal Top. It was turned into the biggest stadium outside Wembley. The Bradford Northern team played its first match there on 1 September 1934.

Success came to Bradford in the 1940s with a number of cup wins: the Yorkshire cup in 1940–41, 1942–43, 1944–45, 1945–46, 1948–49 and 1949–50; and the Challenge Cup 1943–44, 1946–47 and 1948–49. In the Championship Bradford found it difficult to win either before the war or after despite being runners up in 1942–43 and 1947–48. On Saturday 3 November 1945, Bradford Northern met Wakefield Trinity in the final of the Yorkshire Cup held at Thrum Hall, Halifax. Wakefield began the match as favourites, they had lost only one of thirteen matches thus far in the season. However, Bradford won 5–2 Frank Whitcombe scoring the try converted by George Carmichael and lifted the Yorkshire Cup for the fourth time in six seasons.

Bradford defeated Leeds 8–4 to win the Challenge Cup Final at Wembley in 1947. The 1947–48 Challenge Cup final was notable as it was the first rugby league match to be attended by the reigning monarch, King George VI, who presented the trophy. It was also the first televised rugby league match as it was broadcast to the Midlands. Bradford lost 8–3 to Wigan and Frank Whitcombe became the first player to win the Lance Todd trophy on the losing side. The 1949 Challenge Cup final was sold out for the first time as 95,050 spectators saw Bradford beat Halifax. In 1951–52 Bradford were runners up in the league but beat New Zealand at Odsal in the first floodlit football match of any code in the North of England.

In 1953, a crowd of 69,429 watched Bradford play Huddersfield in the Challenge Cup&#x27;s third round. This was Bradford&#x27;s highest ever attendance. They also won the Yorkshire Cup final 7–2 against Hull. Bradford and Leigh were the first rugby league clubs to stage matches on a Sunday in December 1954, although there was opposition from the Sunday Observance lobby.

Bradford&#x27;s support declined rapidly in the 1963 season, attracting a record low crowd of 324 against Barrow. The club went out of business on 10 December 1963, having played just 13 matches; winning 1 and losing 12, scoring 109 points and conceding 284, the results were declared null and void, and expunged from the 1963–64 season&#x27;s records.

===1964–1995: Third club===
A meeting on 14 April 1964 saw 1,500 people turn out to discuss the formation of a new club, and those present promised a £1000 to help get plans for the new organisation underway. Amongst those who led proceedings were former players Joe Phillips and Trevor Foster. On 20 July 1964, Bradford Northern (1964) Ltd came into existence. The club&#x27;s new side had been built for around £15,000 and had Jack Wilkinson as coach. On 22 August 1964, Hull Kingston Rovers provided the opposition in the reformed club&#x27;s first match and 14,500 spectators turned out to show their support, as Odsal hosted its first 10,000 plus gate for a Bradford Northern match since 1957.

The reformed club won its first cup in 1965–66 by beating Hunslet 17–8 in the final of the Yorkshire County Cup. In 1972–73 Bradford lost the Challenge Cup final against Featherstone Rovers 33–14. In 1973–74 Bradford won the Second Division Championship and were promoted back to the First Division. During this season Keith Mumby made his début, becoming the Bradford&#x27;s youngest player at only 16 years of age, kicking 12 goals and scoring a try in the match against Doncaster. He went on to make a record 576 appearances for the club. In 1974–75 Bradford won the Regal Trophy 3–2 against Widnes.

Peter Fox joined Bradford as coach for the first time in 1977–78. Bradford won the Premiership final 17–8 against Widnes and were also Championship runners-up.

In 1978–79 Bradford appeared in another Premiership final this time losing 24–2 to Leeds. A year later Bradford won the Championship and Regal Trophy, Peter Fox winning the award for Coach of the Year. In 1980–81 the club made it back-to-back championships. In 1981–82, Bradford lost the Yorkshire Cup final 10–5 against Castleford and lost again in 1982–83, this time 18–7 against Hull F.C. Keith Mumby won the award for First Division Player of the Year while Brian Noble won the Young Player award.

In 1985, Ellery Hanley left Northern to join Wigan for a then record transfer deal, worth £80,000 and a player exchange involving Steve Donlan and Phil Ford. By November 1987, Bradford had cash-flow problems and the local council refused to help financially, but appointed a special committee to administer the clubs&#x27; finances. In December 1987, desperate for cash, Bradford transfer-listed 22 players for a total of £210,000 plus Phil Ford for £120,000.

In 1987–88 Bradford won the Yorkshire Cup final replay against Castleford 11–2 after drawing 12–12. Ron Willey coached Bradford Northern for a short stint in 1989–90 and led them to the Premiership final and success in the Yorkshire Cup final when they beat Featherstone Rovers 20–14.

David Hobbs became coach at Northern in 1990 until he left for Wakefield Trinity in 1994. Bradford lost the Regal Trophy against Warrington 12–2 in 1990–91. Peter Fox returned to Bradford for a second spell as coach in 1991, and in 1993–94, Bradford finished as runners-up behind Wigan on points difference. Fox left the club in 1995.

===1996–2011: Golden era===
In 1996, the first tier of English rugby league clubs changed from a winter to a summer season and played the inaugural Super League season. Bradford dropped the &#x27;Northern&#x27; name to become Bradford Bulls. Australian Brian Smith took over as head coach in 1995, with Matthew Elliott as his assistant. The Bulls won the Super League title in the 1997 season, the last before the Play off/ Grand Final structure was implemented in 1998.

When Smith left, Elliot coached the Bradford Bulls to the 1999 Super League Grand Final and in 2000 the Bulls won the Challenge Cup for the first time in 51 years with victory over Leeds in Edinburgh.

Brian Noble was appointed Bradford head coach in November 2000. Noble took the Bradford Bulls to the 2001 Super League Grand Final in which they defeated the Wigan Warriors. As Super League VI champions, the Bulls played against 2001 NRL Premiers, the Newcastle Knights in the 2002 World Club Challenge. Noble oversaw Bradford&#x27;s victory. He took the Bulls to the 2002 Super League Grand Final which was lost to St. Helens.

On 20 April 2006, Steve McNamara was promoted to head coach of Bradford following Brian Noble&#x27;s departure to Wigan. At the time he was the youngest coach in Britain. In his first season in charge, he guided Bradford to the Super League play-offs before the club were knocked out in the grand final eliminator by Hull

Following an eighth consecutive defeat, the Bulls&#x27; worst run in Super League, McNamara&#x27;s contract was mutually terminated on 13 July 2010. Lee St Hilaire was coach for the rest of the 2010 season.

Mick Potter became coach in 2011. Despite the club being placed in receivership in 2012, the team was on the verge of making the semi-finals of Super League as Potter remained as unpaid coach.

===2012–2017: Administrations, relegation and liquidation===
In March 2012 the club announced that it was in financial difficulties and needed £1 million to keep the club afloat. A public appeal saw a lot of new funds pour in from supporters, but following the issue of a winding up petition from HMRC for unpaid taxes the holding company for the club was forced to go into administration on 26 June 2012. The Rugby Football League announced that had the company been wound up then the team would be allowed to complete their fixtures for the 2012 Super League season under the possible ownership of a supporters trust. On 2 July 2012, the club&#x27;s administrator, Brendan Guilfoyle, made sixteen members of staff, including the coach Mick Potter and chief executive Ryan Duckett, redundant, but announced that the club would attempt to fulfill its fixtures. Mick Potter continued as an unpaid coach until the end of the season. On 31 August 2012 a bid for the club from a local consortium, headed by Bradford businessman Omar Khan, was accepted by the administrator and was ratified by the RFL in early September. Days later the RFL also granted the new owners a one-year probationary licence enabling the club to compete in Super League XVIII in 2013.

Francis Cummins was appointed as head coach of the Bulls in September 2012.
During the 2012/13 season the Bulls appointed Dr Allan Johnston to the backroom staff to support the players wellbeing and performance. This appointment was thought to be the first of its kind in Rugby League.
In late December 2013 it was announced that chairman Mark Moore and directors Ian Watt and Andrew Calvert had resigned.

In 2014, relegation was reintroduced to the Super League with two teams being relegated. Bradford were deducted 6 points for entering administration early on in the season and the Bulls were relegated from the top division of rugby league in Britain for the first time in 40 years. Francis Cummins was sacked around the time of relegation and replaced by James Lowes and won most of their remaining games.

Bradford began their first Championship campaign in 40 years against Leigh away where they narrowly lost the game. By the end of the regular season they entered the Super 8s finishing second. In the Qualifiers Bradford failed to make the top three for automatic entry to Super League for 2016, finishing 5th which meant a trip to Wakefield to play them in the first ever Million Pound Game. Bradford would lose 24–16, condemning them to a second year in the Championship.

In preparation for the 2016 season, Bradford completed the signings of several experienced players, such as Centre Kris Welham from Super League side Hull Kingston Rovers, as well as Oscar Thomas, Mitch Clark, Johnny Campbell, Jonathan Walker and Kurt Haggerty from London Broncos, Doncaster, Batley and Leigh. Bradford started the season strongly, with a win over fellow promotion hopefuls Featherstone Rovers by 22–12. Omari Caro scored a hat-trick in this match. This was followed up by away wins at Whitehaven and Swinton. Bradford&#x27;s season was ultimately disappointing with failure to reach the Qualifiers, this meant Bradford would miss out on a chance of promotion

On 14 November 2016, Bradford Bulls were placed in administration for the third time since 2012. On 16 November, the Rugby Football League (RFL) cancelled Bradford&#x27;s membership, making their future uncertain. In the ensuing weeks several bids to buy the club were made but despite one bid being acceptable to the RFL, none were accepted by the administrator and the club went into liquidation on 3 January 2017.

Following liquidation the RFL issued a statement saying:
===2017–2019: Fourth club===
After the Bulls went into liquidation in January 2017 the Rugby Football League invited bids to form a new club based in Bradford who would be allowed to take the place of the Bulls in the 2017 Championship but started with a 12-point penalty deduction.

The RFL issued a set of criteria for anyone wishing to bid for the new club and there were 12 expressions of interest of which four were converted into bids submitted to the RFL. On 13 January the RFL announced that a consortium to run the new club had been selected and notified of the decision. The new owner was publicly announced on 17 January as Andrew Chalmers, the former chairman of the New Zealand Rugby League. Also involved is former player and coach, Graham Lowe.

The parent company of the club is registered as Bradford Bulls 2017 Limited at Companies House, and the team continue to be known as Bradford Bulls, also retaining the club colours, stadium and several players from the 2016 squad. On 20 January 2017 Geoff Toovey was named as coach and Leon Pryce as captain. However, a delay in processing his paperwork left Toovey unable to fulfil his role and led to Leigh Beattie being appointed as interim coach.

Before the start of the 2018 season, the Bulls appointed the highly experienced John Kear as coach, and under his guidance, gained promotion to the Championship.

===2019–present: Move to Dewsbury and Return to Odsal===
In August 2019, Bulls chairman Andrew Chalmers announced that the club could no longer afford to play at Odsal and were to relocate to Dewsbury for two years after the preferred alternatives, Valley Parade and Horsfall Stadium were deemed too expensive. On 1 September 2019, Bradford Bulls played the last game at Odsal stadium for the next year and a half, and bade a temporary farewell to the 85-year-old home ground for the team.
In November 2019, Nigel Wood, Mark Sawyer, and Eric Perez took over the ownership of the club, although Perez&#x27;s involvement would only be temporary, as interim chair for a few months.
The Bulls returned to Odsal in May 2021. In the 2022 RFL Championship season, Bradford finished a disappointing 9th on the table. The 2023 RFL Championship season and the 2024 RFL Championship season showed that hope was still there as The Bulls managed to get to the semi finals in both seasons but fell short after two losses to Toulouse Olympique. 

==Stadiums==
===1907–1933: Greenfield and Birch Lane===

The Bradford Northern club had played at a number of venues including the Greenfield Athletic Ground in Dudley Hill and Bowling Old Lane Cricket Club&#x27;s ground in Birch Lane. By the early 1920s, however, Birch Lane&#x27;s limitations were clear and Northern began to seek another home. Precarious finances prevented the club being able to take up an offer to develop land off Rooley Lane or to upgrade and move back to Greenfield, but in 1933, Bradford City Council gave them the opportunity to transform land at Odsal Top into their home ground.

===1934–Present: Odsal===

Apart from two seasons in 2001 and 2002 when the Bradford Bulls played their home games at Valley Parade, groundsharing with football club Bradford City A.F.C, prior to leaving Odsal for Crown Flatt, Dewsbury in 2019, Odsal Stadium has been the home ground of Bradford Northern/Bulls since 1934 along with regular speedway and stock car racing meetings over the years, BriSCA F1 Stock Cars and BriSCA F2 Stock Cars. having returned to Odsal since 2021. Odsal Stadium had also hosted many other sports, including association football, American football, basketball, featuring the Harlem Globetrotters, wrestling, show jumping and kabaddi. The stadium&#x27;s largest attendances was 102,569, when Halifax played Warrington on 5 May 1954 in the Challenge Cup Final replay.

Due to financial concerns amidst rising administration costs of using the single-use RFL-owned stadium, the rent reported to be £450,000 rent per year, the Bradford Bulls left Odsal in 2019, temporarily playing at Crown Flatt in Dewsbury including home matches of the COVID-19 abandoned rugby league season of 2020 plus three league fixtures of the 2021 season, however they returned to Odsal during the 2021 season when stock car promotors YorStox successfully returned professional stock car racing as co-tenants at the now multi-use venue, absorbing stadium hire costs, a flattened shale track laid to re-enable motorsports events. The Bulls&#x27; acting chief executive, Mark Sawyer, told Rugby League Live at the time: &quot;Staging motorsport events is the first piece in the jigsaw puzzle towards how we&#x27;re going to balance the books at Odsal&quot;, stressing that he believed Bulls supporters were positive about the return of motorsports, quoted as saying &quot;The feedback we get from our Bradford supporter base is that a number of them are interested in watching motorsport.

In September 2024 it was revealed that the Bradford Bulls had issued a warning surrounding the club&#x27;s finances, calling for more financial support from the RFL. Despite a £22,000 profit in their latest set of accounts, the chief executive Jason Hirst warned it will take the increasing backing of owners, benefactors, sponsors, supporters and volunteers to keep the Bulls in the black.

==Crest and colours==
===Crest===
Up until the Super League era the club was known as Bradford Northern and used a stylised boar&#x27;s head similar to the one atop the Bradford city coat of arms. When the club was rebranded Bradford Bulls the crest was changed to a similar design to that of the Chicago Bulls.

===Colours===
Bradford&#x27;s traditional playing colours are a red, amber and black hoop, on a white background. Bradford&#x27;s home strips are predominantly white with a red, amber and black hoop or &quot;V&quot;. Away strips have had many designs and colours, but usually integrate the traditional red, amber and black into the design. In some cases, Bradford have been known to have a third kit that has had many different designs such as the 2024 season where the third kit pays homage to a shirt, the design of which was 90 years old to celebrate the time they have spent at Odsal.

==Kit sponsors and manufacturers==
==Rivalries==

Bradford&#x27;s main rivals historically whilst playing in the Super League, were the Leeds Rhinos who they have played in multiple finals, especially during the early years of the competition, and also the Huddersfield Giants and St Helens whom they faced in two successive Challenge cup finals during the golden era. Since the Bulls were relegated to the RL Championship in 2014, their main local rivalry is now between themselves and the Halifax Panthers, the Championship a division below the Super League. 

They also have a lesser local rivalry with Keighley Cougars, although this was arguably considered a one-way rivalry as competitive fixtures were rare since they mostly played in different divisions.

<text>Leeds Rhinos are a professional rugby league club in Leeds, West Yorkshire, England. The club play their home games at AMT Headingley Rugby Stadium and compete in the Super League, the top tier of British rugby league.

Leeds Rhinos have won the League Championship 11 times, Challenge Cup 14 times and World Club Challenge three times. 

The club share big long-standing West Yorkshire Derby rivalries with Huddersfield Giants and Bradford Bulls. Leeds&#x27; traditional home colours are blue and amber shirts with white shorts and blue socks.

==History==
===1870–1895: Foundation and early years===
In 1864, H. I. Jenkinson placed an advert in the &quot;Leeds Mercury&quot; inviting players to meet up at Woodhouse Moor a few days a week from 7 a.m. to 8 a.m. That advert attracted more than 500 members. From this interest several clubs were formed, including Leeds St John&#x27;s.

Leeds St John&#x27;s was formed in 1870 and was originally known as the &quot;Old Blue and Ambers&quot;. The club played at the Militia Barracks from 1870 to 1888 before moving to Cardigan Fields, near Headingley, Leeds. Membership was originally confined to the church classes but was soon expanded. By 1887 St John&#x27;s had reached its first cup final, the Yorkshire Cup losing to Wakefield Trinity.

The city of Leeds had an abundance of rugby football clubs and although members of the Yorkshire RFU (which was in turn a constituent body of the RFU), it was decided to form a &#x27;more local&#x27; association. It was for this reason that the Leeds &amp; District organisation was formalised when a meeting took place at the Green Dragon Hotel, Leeds on 27 September 1888. The foundation clubs were Bramley, Holbeck, Hunslet, Kirkstall, Leeds Parish Church, Leeds St John&#x27;s and Wortley.

In 1888 the Cardigan Estate was sold at auction and Lot 17a was purchased by a group of Leeds citizens, who intended to form the city&#x27;s leading sports club. Lot 17a became what is now Headingley Stadium.

Leeds St John&#x27;s played its final season under that name in 1889–90, before becoming the football section of Leeds Cricket, Football and Athletic Co Ltd the following season. With Headingley still being completed, Leeds&#x27; first game was staged at Cardigan Fields, the home side defeating Otley. The first game at Headingley was played on 20 September 1890, when Manningham were beaten by one try and one dropped goal to nil.

After the 1890–91 season, Leeds along with other Yorkshire Senior clubs Batley, Bradford, Brighouse, Dewsbury, Halifax, Huddersfield, Hull, Hunslet, Leeds, Liversedge, Manningham and Wakefield decided that they wanted their own county league starting in 1891 along the lines of a similar competition that had been played in Lancashire. The clubs wanted full control of the league but the Yorkshire Rugby Football Union would not sanction the competition as it meant giving up control of rugby football to the senior clubs.

In 1892, 27,654 spectators, a then record in British rugby, attended the third round showdown between Leeds and Halifax at Headingley.

===1895–1920: Northern Union breakaway===

A special general meeting was held in 1895 that voted decisively to support the breakaway Northern Union as a founder member, resulting in two resignations from the club. Leeds&#x27; début in the Northern Union was a 6–3 success at Leigh on 7 September 1895, the inaugural day of the new competition.
In 1901, the Leeds Parish Church team disbanded and put all of its players at Leeds&#x27; disposal. That same year saw the formation of the Northern Rugby League, with a number of leading clubs leaving the Yorkshire League and the Lancashire League and joining the new competition. Leeds was not admitted until the following year when it was placed in the newly formed second division and quickly gained promotion as runners-up to Keighley.

Leeds City FC joined football&#x27;s Second Division in 1905–06, and finished sixth out of 20 clubs in the club&#x27;s first season. Rugby&#x27;s monopoly with the locals seemed to have been broken, with Leeds Rugby League&#x27;s average gate numbers falling by nearly 50% in that first league season.

In 1910, Leeds came of age with the team finishing in sixth place in the league, but that was just a warm-up for the Challenge Cup campaign. Leeds beat Hull Kingston Rovers, Rochdale Hornets, Keighley and then scraped through 11–10 against Warrington in the semifinal before meeting Hull F.C. in the final. Rain on the morning of the game meant conditions were against flowing rugby. The scores were level at 7–7 with fifteen minutes left. However, neither team could break the deadlock, and the final went to a replay two days later, again at Fartown, Huddersfield. Leeds made no mistake this time and ran out convincing 26–12 winners having led 16–0 at half-time.

The club lost many players to the First World War; of a total of fifty-one players who served in the military, fifteen were killed. The usual league programme was interrupted during 1914–18. During this period, Leeds played a number of &quot;guest players&quot; in the Emergency League competition. The Headingley club reached the Championship final for the first time in 1915, but lost 35–2 to Huddersfield, then a record score. The Emergency League was then suspended. Leeds reverted to rugby union during the First World War to play a one-off challenge game against the Royal Navy Depot from Plymouth in 1917. This was a precursor to the following Christmas when two Challenge games were organised between the two sides but this time with one of each code. The Navy won the union game 9–3 on Christmas Eve but proved equally adept at league recording a 24–3 win on 28 December.

===1921–1942: Inter-war period===
In 1921, Harold Buck became the game&#x27;s first £1,000 transfer when he moved from Hunslet to Leeds.

On Saturday 27 October 1934, Leeds and Wakefield Trinity met in the final of the Yorkshire Cup at Crown Flatt, Dewsbury. The match was played in front of a crowd of 22,598 and ended in a 5–5 draw. Four days later the two clubs drew again, with Leeds eventually lifting the trophy after a second replay, the only occasion it took three attempts to settle a Yorkshire Cup Final. A total of 52,402 spectators watched the three games.

Leeds forward Joe Thompson was the top point scorer for both the 1929–30 and 1927–28 seasons.

In 1937, Leeds paid the stand-off Vic Hey a then-record £1,400 signing-on fee to lure him from Australia. Vic was regarded as a major loss to the Australian game and this contributed to the RFL imposing a ban on international transfers, which lasted until 1940.

In 1938, Leeds played Swinton in the Rugby Football League Championship semi-final. Leeds won the match 5 points to 2 to set up a history-making all-Leeds clash with neighbours Hunslet in the final. The match was played at the Elland Road football ground, to accommodate a huge demand from the city&#x27;s rugby league supporters. Over 54,000 people watched the game, a then record for a match in England. Hunslet triumphed 8–2 to take the title.

Leeds won the Challenge Cup in 1941 and 1942 beating Halifax both times at games held at Odsal.

===1950–1960: Post-war===
Following the Second World War, Leeds club struggled to make a serious impact in rugby league despite having a financial advantage over the majority of other teams. Arthur Clues was the first Australian to come and play in Britain after the war and the great Australian second rower was signed by Leeds. His rivalry with the Great Britain and Wales prop Frank Whitcombe, who played for Bradford Northern was legendary. Their confrontations on the field during the Leeds v Bradford Northern local derby games are part of rugby league folklore.

It was not until the late 1950s, when in 1957 the club secured its first post-war Challenge Cup victory, that the young side being built began to show signs of what was to come. Joe Warham came to Leeds as coach in 1958 and a Yorkshire Cup triumph followed, but the side still lacked enough quality to compete at the top of the Lancashire section of the competition in which it was then playing.

However, &quot;the Loiners&quot; (their historical nickname) were to establish themselves as a dominant force by the end of the coming decade. In 1960 Dai Prosser was appointed to assist Joe Warham with the coaching duties and the club signed a new back three of Jack Fairbank, Brian Shaw and Dennis Goodwin to strengthen the forward pack. The recruitment paid off: the club was crowned Champions for the first time in 1961 with Lewis Jones leading them to a 25–10 victory over Warrington in the Championship Final at Odsal Stadium, Bradford.

===1960–1980: First Championship titles===
In the late 1960s, under the guidance of Roy Francis, Leeds repeatedly finished top of the league. The club contested perhaps the most memorable of all Wembley occasions, the &quot;watersplash final&quot; of 1968, which was played despite a downpour that saturated the pitch. It produced the most dramatic of finishes, when Lance Todd trophy winner Don Fox had the easiest of conversions to win it for Wakefield Trinity, but missed it to leave Leeds 11–10 winners.

Francis then quit the club to take up a coaching position in Australia, and Joe Warham again took charge as coach, on an interim basis, midway through the 1969 campaign. The Championship trophy duly returned to Headingley for the second time after a tough final against Castleford at Odsal Stadium.

In 1970 Leeds returned to the Championship final, and Odsal, but lost to St. Helens despite having taken an early lead. Tables were turned in December when the same teams met in the final of the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy, Leeds emerging victorious this time.

Coached by Derek &quot;Rocky&quot; Turner, Leeds returned to Wembley in 1971 and 1972 but lost out both times – in 1971 losing 24–7 to rank outsiders Leigh and suffering the indignity of captain Syd Hynes being the first man to &#x27;take an early bath&#x27; at Wembley. A third championship, in 1972, provided consolation.

Eric Ashton (former Wigan and Great Britain centre) coached Leeds for the 1973–74 season before leaving to coach St. Helens.

Leeds continued to collect silverware: the Regal Trophy in 1973 and the Premiership (the then-current form of the championship playoff) in 1975. The team held the Yorkshire Cup seven times between 1969 and 1980.

1976–77 was a season of mixed emotions. The Salford versus Leeds league match was abandoned after 38 minutes when Chris Sanderson of Leeds suffered a fatal injury. Leeds led 5–2, but the game was declared null and void and not replayed. The club recovered to win the Challenge Cup at the end of the season. This success was repeated in 1978, in a classic final against St Helens at Wembley Stadium with Leeds completing what was then a record comeback, from 10–0 down. Former captain Syd Hynes was coach on both occasions.

This was followed up with another Premiership win, in 1979. However, these victories were the &#x27;last hurrah&#x27; of the great 1960s, and 1970s sides and a barren spell followed in the 1980s.

===1980–1996: Nearly Men===
Leeds&#x27; only triumphs were the 1984 John Player Trophy (beating Widnes) under coach Maurice Bamford and the Yorkshire County Cup in 1980 (beating Hull Kingston Rovers) and 1988(beating Castleford). Leeds were beaten finalists in the John Player Trophy four times in the 1980s, and 1990s.

Between December 1986 and April 1988, Maurice Bamford was coach of Leeds.

Leeds eventually returned to Wembley for a Challenge Cup Final appearance in 1994 against Wigan. Leeds returned to Wembley a year later, again to face Wigan again, but were beaten more easily.

===1996–2003: Start of the Super League era===
In 1996 Gary Hetherington sold his controlling interest in Sheffield Eagles and joined Paul Caddick to take over the ailing Leeds C F &amp; A Co Ltd, owners and operators of Headingley Stadium and Leeds Rugby League Club. 1996 marked the beginning of summer rugby as the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season.

In 1997, the club renamed itself Leeds Rhinos. Dean Bell took over as head coach following his retirement as a player at Auckland Warriors. Iestyn Harris joined Leeds that year for a record-breaking £350,000 transfer and was appointed captain in his first full season at the age of only 21. Leeds experienced great financial difficulty and even flirted with relegation as they won only six matches all year and finished third from bottom in Super League, above only Oldham and Paris.

Bell became head of the academy team. In 1998 Graham Murray replaced Bell and joined the Leeds Rhinos as head coach and the team reached the inaugural Grand Final, at Old Trafford, being beaten by Wigan. In 1999 Leeds finally landed their first silverware in a decade, and their first Challenge Cup for more than 20 years, with a convincing 52–16 win over London at Wembley.

In 2000, Leeds reached the Challenge Cup Final but finished runners up to Yorkshire rivals Bradford at Murrayfield, Edinburgh. Daryl Powell became coach of Leeds after he retired from playing in 2001.
In 2003, despite being top of the table at the time, Leeds announced Tony Smith would replace Darryl Powell as head coach for the 2004 season. Leeds returned to the Challenge Cup final in 2003, again to face Bradford, this time at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff where they were beaten 22–20.

===2004–2017: Golden Era===

The Rhinos ended their 32-year wait for a league championship by winning the 2004 Super League Grand Final This marked the start of more than a decade of on-field success. As champions of the previous year, Leeds played in the 2005 World Club Challenge beating the 2004 Australian premiers Canterbury Bulldogs. Leeds next trophy was the 2007 Grand Final, which marked the final game as coach of the club for Tony Smith. He was replaced by former New Zealand international team coach Brian McClennan. Further success followed in 2008 when Leeds again beat Australian opposition in the 2008 World Club Challenge, Melbourne Storm the defeated opponents on this occasion. Leeds then retained the Super League championship by winning the Grand final. This marked the first time the club had won consecutive titles. A third consecutive league title followed in 2009, when Leeds won the 2009 Super League Grand Final, and thus became the first club ever to win the trophy three times in a row.

After failing to win a trophy in 2010, Leeds started the 2011 season in mixed form, and by July appeared to be in danger of missing out on the play-offs completely. They ultimately did finish in a play-off spot and went on to win the 2011 Super League Grand Final. They reached the Challenge Cup Final in 2012, as they had the previous year, but again finished runners up. The Rhinos did however, successfully defend their Super League title by winning the 2012 Super League Grand Final. Success in the Grand Final earned them another World Club Challenge match against Melbourne Storm, in which they were defeated. Leeds would ultimately fail to win any silverware in 2013, however they did end their long run without a Challenge Cup final win by beating Castleford Tigers at Wembley in the 2014 final.

In March 2014, it was announced that Leeds would share a partnership with the Atlanta Rhinos, who play in the USA Rugby League. Leeds stated they would help bring a professional approach to the Atlanta club by sharing information and playing talent.

====The Treble====
Leeds had a highly successful season in 2015, winning the Challenge Cup, League Leaders Shield and the Grand Final, completing the modern day rugby league treble and becoming only the third team in the Super League era to achieve this after Bradford in 2003 and St. Helens in 2006.

Leeds&#x27; victory in the 2015 Grand Final was the final competitive game of Rugby League for three long serving players of the game, as Jamie Peacock &amp; Kylie Leuluai retired at the end of the season and Kevin Sinfield joined Leeds&#x27; sister club in Rugby Union, Yorkshire Carnegie.

Leeds struggled in the season following their best ever season in 2015. they spent most of the regular season in the bottom two league positions before finding form and just missing out on 8th place to Widnes therefore being confined to fight to keep their Super League status in The Qualifiers for the first time. The club comfortably finished first in the Qualifiers only losing to Huddersfield.

The following season was a return to form, finishing second to Castleford and only a point off of their 2015 treble winning season tally. They went on to play Castleford in the Grand Final winning 24–6, the club&#x27;s 11th title and 8th of the Super League era.

===2018–present: Struggles and rebuild===
After the successful 2017 season, the 2016 season was written off as an anomaly, however 2018 was to be another bad year for the club. They finished 9th in the regular season and finished second in the Qualifiers narrowly avoiding the Million Pound Game on points difference.

For the 2019 season the club appointed former player David Furner as head coach to rebuild the team. After an unsuccessful start to the season Furner was sacked and replaced with Richard Agar as caretaker coach. Agars first game in charge was a loss in the Challenge Cup to second division Bradford Bulls. Agar was given the job permanently at the end of the season after keeping the club in Super League.

Leeds made a bright start to the 2020 Super League season although their season was disrupted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the postponed season the club made it to their first Challenge Cup final in five years where they beat Salford 17–16. It was their first major trophy after the &#x27;Golden Era&#x27;. Leeds reached the first week of the playoffs but were eliminated after losing to Catalans Dragons 26–14.

In the 2021 Super League season, Leeds finished in 5th place on the table and qualified for the playoffs. In the elimination playoff, they defeated Wigan 8–0 at the DW Stadium to book a semi-final match against St Helens.
Leeds started the 2022 Super League season poorly winning only one match in their opening 10 games. Before Leeds round 10 match against Toulouse Olympique, Leeds were sat 11th on the table. Following the clubs round 11 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers, Agar resigned as head coach of the club. He was later replaced by Rohan Smith. Under Smith, Leeds won 13 of their next 18 games to reach the 2022 Super League Grand Final. Along the way, the club upset both Catalans Dragons and Wigan in the playoffs to reach the decider. In the grand final, Leeds were defeated 24–12 against St Helens RFC.
Leeds finished the 2023 Super League season in 8th place and could not replicate what happened in 2022. The club also suffered heavy losses throughout the year including a 61–0 loss against the Catalans Dragons and a 50–0 defeat by Wigan.
Leeds finished the 2024 Super League season in the same position they finished a year earlier. Midway through the season, head coach Rohan Smith stepped down from his role and was replaced by former Parramatta head coach Brad Arthur.

==Colours and badge==

Colours
Leeds play in traditional Leeds colours blue and amber (home). Their home kits are famously blue with an amber band around the chest and on the arms. Between 2011 and 2013 Leeds wore pink away kits with proceeds of shirt sales going to breast cancer charities.

Badge
Between the club&#x27;s foundation in 1865 and the formation of Super League in 1996 Leeds used the city&#x27;s crest on their kits as they were just known as Leeds RLFC or Leeds Loiners. In 1996, the formation of Super League saw Leeds change their name to Leeds Rhinos. The new badge is mainly blue and has a rhino with the word rhino above it in a semi circle and Leeds at the top of the badge.

==Stadium==

Leeds have played at Headingley since 1890 and the ground is owned by Leeds. The rugby ground is also on the same site as the cricket ground operated by Yorkshire County Cricket Club. The North Stand of the rugby ground backs onto the cricket ground. The Carnegie Stand was built in 2006 to replace the old, uncovered, Eastern Terrace and also expanded the capacity to 21,000, adding extra seating on the top tier and terracing on the bottom.

Between 2017 and 2019 the stadium was extensively redeveloped with both the South and North Stands being demolished and replaced by modern constructions, the latter in co-operation with Yorkshire CCC. Seating was added in the upper level of the new South Stand and a large corporate suite, originally called the Emerald Suite, is located within the North Stand overlooking both cricket and rugby pitches. Any significant redevelopment or expansion of the Western Terrace would require the demolition of housing and rerouting of a public right of way.
&#x27;

==Kit sponsors and manufacturers==
Leeds have had four shirt sponsors since 1981. In April 1994, they signed a 10-year sponsorship deal with Tetley&#x27;s Brewery worth a record £2.3 million. The Rhinos&#x27; current main shirt sponsors, Leeds Building Society, are currently the longest sponsorship deal the club have had. In 2023 the club signed a three-year extension with Leeds Building Society, making it the longest shirt sponsorship deal of any English rugby team in both codes. Since 2020 the club&#x27;s kits have been made by UK-based company Oxen.
==Mascot==

Ronnie the Rhino is the mascot of Leeds Rhinos. He gets the crowd going before the match and at half time he normally gets children involved by playing some sort of game. Ronnie the Rhino visits schools as part of the Leeds Rhinos Community project, with the intention of promoting sports and healthy living. Former &quot;Ronnie&quot; Daniel Duffy stood for Leeds North West in the 1997 general election, obtaining 232 votes.

==Rivalries==

During the early part of the Super League era, Leeds&#x27; main local rivals were Bradford Bulls, who they played in two Grand Finals and beat in 2004 to win their first Super League title. However the Bulls have since slipped down to the lower leagues and competitive games are rare. Leeds also have a cross-city rivalry with Hunslet, who they play annually in the Harry Jepson OBE Memorial Cup. Leeds and Hunslet F.C. played against each other in the &#x27;all Leeds&#x27; 1938 Championship Final at Elland Road, won by Hunslet, which attracted a still-record Rugby League attendance for the city of 54,112. Since the 1970s, however, Hunslet have largely played in lower leagues so competitive fixtures are rare.

Leeds also have West Yorkshire derbies with Castleford Tigers and with Wakefield Trinity, who they play every Boxing Day in the annual Festive Challenge. 

Since the formation of Super League there has been a major rivalry with St. Helens, who lost five consecutive Grand Finals between 2007 and 2011, four of which were against Leeds. The two sides have been the most successful during the Super League era. There are also other cross-Pennine rivalries against Wigan Warriors, whom they have played in big games and beat in a final for the first time in 2015, and against Warrington Wolves, who they have played in Challenge Cup and Grand Finals.

===Man of Steel winners===
The Man of Steel Award (latterly the Steve Prescott Man of Steel Award) is an annual honour, awarded by the Super League to the most outstanding player in the British game for that year.

===Golden Boot winners===
The Golden Boot Award is a rugby league award handed out annually for achievements in rugby league by Rugby League World magazine. The Golden Boot is given, usually in December after the conclusion of all the year&#x27;s matches, to the player adjudged to be the best in the world, as determined by a ballot of international media representatives.

It was decided by the judges that Garry Schofield should be the winner in 1990, but unfortunately the sponsors of the Golden Boot backed out and the award was shelved. After a nine-year hiatus, League Publications Ltd, having bought Rugby League World, brought back the award in 1999. In 2011 they decided to give Schofield his Golden Boot and he is now included in the roll call of winners of the prestigious award.

The oldest winner of the award is Kevin Sinfield, who won in 2012 at the age of 32.

<text>Wigan Warriors is an English professional rugby league club based in Wigan, Greater Manchester. 

The club competes in the Super League, the top tier of the British rugby league system. Formed in 1872, the club is a founding member of the Northern Rugby Football Union following the schism in 1895. The club is currently the most successful club in the history of the sport, having won 163 trophies in total (8 of these were won prior to the formation of the Northern Rugby Football Union).
The club has played its home games at the Brick Community Stadium since 1999. Before this time, the club&#x27;s home was Central Park and had been since 1902. The club first wore the cherry and white colours it is now synonymous for in 1885 and adopted these colours on a permanent basis in late 1888. 
The club has won 24 league titles (17 first division and 7 Super League), 21 Challenge Cups and 5 World Club Challenges. Wigan&#x27;s most successful period was during the 1980s and 1990s, with the club winning seven consecutive league titles, eight Challenge Cup finals in a row (1988–1995) and winning the World Club Challenge on three occasions including the club&#x27;s win against Brisbane Broncos at Queensland Sport and Athletics Centre with victory in 1994.

==History==
===1872–1902: Formation, Re-formation and NRFU foundation===
On 21 November 1872, Wigan Football Club was founded by members of Wigan Cricket Club following a meeting at the Royal Hotel, Standishgate. The meeting saw around 50 members enroll into the club most of whom were members of the cricket club. The following committee was selected: T. R. Ellis, H. V. Kyrke, J. Sayers, E. R. Walker, J. Smith, J. Souter, H. Wall and R. Procter. The recently re-elected Mayor of Wigan Mr Nathan Eckersley was made club President. Many of the club&#x27;s founding members were well-to-do; some owned businesses or were solicitors, magistrates and suchlike. Wigan F.C. played on Folly Field, near Upper Dicconson Street and used the nearby Dicconson Arms Hotel as a HQ.

The first match took place on 30 November when members played against each other in a practice match at Folly Field the match attracted around 2,000 spectators. After a series of trial and practice matches, they travelled to Warrington to play their first competitive match on 18 January 1873. The game ended in a draw. The club played six games in its first season finishing with a record of three wins and three draws.

An inability to recruit enough regular and quality players led to many members of Upholland Football Club joining the club in 1876. This was a significant boost to the playing ranks. The club changed its name on 20 October 1876 and became Wigan &amp; District Football Club to represent the new influx of players which had joined from the outskirts of town. The Upholland club disbanded due to the large number of players who joined Wigan. The club moved and played its home games at the Wigan Cricket Club at Prescott Street just off Frog Lane. The first game at Prescott Street was played against St. Helens on 25 November 1876 which Wigan won comfortably. The club did not fulfil all its fixtures in the 1877/78 season. The club played its last match that season against Liverpool Wanderers on 17 November 1877. There are no current records of the club after 23 November 1877 that year as the club disbanded. Many of the members who joined Wigan from Upholland eventually returned to the Upholland club which was re-formed following the Wigan club being disbanded.

On 22 September 1879, the club was re-formed as Wigan Wasps Football Club by new members at a meeting in the Dicconson Arms. The main instigators of the re-formation of the club anew were W. L. Baldwin, J. Slevin, J. Underwood, Joe Wardle and others. Mr. Underwood was secretary and Mr. Alfred Hodgkinson was named as the treasurer. Many of the new members involved in the re-establishment of the club had also been involved with the Hare &amp; Hounds running club and were of a more working-class background than the cricketers who had originally founded the club. The club moved back to Folly Field and used the Dicconson Arms Hotel as a HQ again before using the Legs of Man Hotel in the town centre as a HQ a few years later.

In 1881 the club reverted to its original name of Wigan Football Club. It had been suggested that the club should do so but this was finally decided when Club Secretary William Marsden wrote to Wigan Cricket Club to see if they would be forming another football club in the near future as they had done when originally creating Wigan. The cricketers weren&#x27;t involved with the club anymore but Mr Marsden felt it would be courtesy to ask what their intentions were in relation to football. The secretary of the cricket club wrote back saying it was completely justified for Wigan Wasps to become Wigan Football Club again as the cricketers had no intention of forming another football club with that name or being involved with football at all and as such the club remained the only rugby football club in town at that time.

In 1883, Wigan won its first trophy, the Wigan Union Charity Cup. The club won the West Lancashire and Border Towns Union Cup in 1884 and the Wigan Union Charity Cup again in 1885. The club played in cherry and white jerseys for the first time on 26 September 1885.
In 1888 they hosted the touring New Zealand Maoris.

During this era Wigan were represented by some iconic players. James &#x27;Jim&#x27; Slevin, Ned Bullough, William &#x27;Billy&#x27; Atkinson and John &#x27;Jack&#x27; Anderton. Jim Slevin arguably being the most important player for Wigan during this era. He made a total of 290 appearances, scoring 131 tries and was involved in the club winning 8 trophies.

Wigan, Leigh and Salford were suspended by the RFU for breaking the strict amateur code despite their argument that broken-time payments were necessary to avoid undue hardship for their working class players. The clubs were placed joint bottom of the Lancashire league. With automatic promotion and relegation, they faced dropping down a division, and potential financial ruin. In 1895 Wigan joined with other clubs from Yorkshire and Lancashire to found the Northern Union which led eventually to the sport of rugby league. This was a result of the breakaway from the Rugby Football Union.

The County Championship was introduced in October 1895 with Cheshire entertaining Lancashire. The Red Rose side contained three players from Wigan: Winstanley (full back) and Unsworth and Brown (forwards).

In 1896–97, due to the increased number of Northern Union teams the Northern League was abandoned in favour of two County Senior leagues. The second half of the season saw the introduction of the Northern Union Cup (later known as the Rugby League Cup). Wigan reached the third round before being knocked out by St. Helens.

In 1904, fourteen clubs resigned from the two county leagues to form a new Northern Rugby League for season 1901–02. Wigan, however, remained in the Lancashire Senior Competition.

Wigan became sub-tenants of Springfield Park, which they shared with Wigan United AFC, playing their first game there on 14 September 1901. A crowd of 4,000 saw them beat Morecambe 12–0. During this season Wigan won the Lancashire Senior Competition.

Wigan&#x27;s record crowd at Springfield was 10,000 when they beat Widnes on 19 March 1902. The last game was on 28 April 1902 when Wigan beat the Rest of Lancashire Senior Competition. Two meetings were held by Wigan members during the season to discuss the possibility of turning the club into a Limited Company but the idea did not take off.

===1902–1945: Move to Central Park and Wartime Emergency League===

On 6 September 1902, Wigan played at Central Park for the first time in the opening match of the newly formed First Division. An estimated crowd of 9,000 spectators saw Wigan beat Batley 14–8.

In the 1905–06 season they won their first cup, in rugby league, the Lancashire County Cup. Between 1906 and 1923 Wigan won the Lancashire League another seven times and the Lancashire Cup another four times. Wigan were the first winners of the Lancashire cup.

Wigan played New Zealand on 9 November 1907 and ran out winners by 12 points to 8 in front of a crowd of around 30,000.
Great Britain, then known as the Northern Union, played their first-ever test against New Zealand on 25 January 1908. James &quot;Jim&quot; Leytham, Bert Jenkins and John &quot;Johnny&quot; Thomas of Wigan were in the home side and Leytham scored a try. Jenkins and Thomas had previously played in the first Welsh game against New Zealand on 1 January 1908.

On Saturday 28 October 1911, Wigan played a match against the Australasian team which visited England on the 1911–12 Kangaroo tour of Great Britain and won.

On 12 May 1921, Wigan became a limited company.

In June 1922 Jim Sullivan joined Wigan from Cardiff RFC when he was only 17. His cash value was put at £750, which was a staggering signing-on fee for an adolescent who had not yet played 13-a-side rugby (based on increases in average earnings, this would be approximately £137,700 in 2015). His first game was at home against Widnes on 27 August 1921, and he scored ten points in a 21–0 win. Almost inevitably, Jim Sullivan scored the first points in the first Challenge Cup Final to be played at Wembley Stadium, kicking a penalty after only three minutes of the inaugural Challenge Cup Final against Dewsbury in 1929 in which he led Wigan to a 13–2 victory. Sullivan became player-coach in 1932.

Wigan won their first Challenge Cup in the 1923–24 season when they beat Oldham 21–4 in Rochdale.

In 1933 the Prince of Wales attended Central Park, becoming the first royal to watch a rugby league match.

On 25 October 1938 Australian Harry Sunderland arrived in Wigan to take up the duties of Secretary-Manager at Central Park. On 28 September the following year, Sunderland&#x27;s contract was terminated and he and the club parted company.

The outbreak of World War II disrupted the Rugby Football League Championship but Wigan continued to play in the Lancashire War League and the Emergency War League.

During the war years the club went through the 1940–41 season unbeaten although they lost the Championship final. They lost the 1944 Challenge Cup Final over two games to Bradford Northern 8–3 but made up for it beating Dewsbury in the Championship Final.

===1945–1980: Post war era===
Jim Sullivan&#x27;s last game, as a player, for Wigan was at Mount Pleasant, Batley, on 23 February 1946. He remained at Central Park for another six seasons as coach.

In 1948 Wigan took part in the first televised rugby league match when their 8–3 Challenge Cup Final victory over Bradford Northern was broadcast to the Midlands. In another first this was the first rugby league match to be attended by the reigning monarch, King George VI, who presented the trophy.

On Saturday 27 October 1951, 33,230 spectators saw Wigan beat Leigh 14–6 in the final of the Lancashire Cup at Station Road, Swinton. In 1952 Wigan won their sixth consecutive Lancashire Cup.

Wigan were also featured in the first league match to be broadcast, a clash with Wakefield Trinity at Central Park on 12 January 1952.

In 1953 Wigan signed Billy Boston for £150. 8,000 fans saw Billy Boston début for Wigan in the &#x27;A&#x27; team. He later became one of the most successful and famous Wigan players of all time. Eric Ashton signed for Wigan for £150 in 1955. Wigan went to Wembley six times in the Boston / Ashton era and won three times.

The visit of St. Helens on 27 March 1959 produced Central Park&#x27;s all-time record attendance of 47,747 which is still a record for any rugby league game in Lancashire. Wigan went on to win the game 19–14 after holding off a Saints comeback. Mick Sullivan moved to Wigan for a then record £9,500 fee in 1957.

Joe Egan returned to coach Wigan and during his time they won the Championship play-off final in 1960 defeating Wakefield Trinity 21–5, the Challenge Cup in 1958, 1959, 13–9 against Workington Town and 30–13 against Hull F.C. respectively before losing in 12–6 to St. Helens in 1961 which was to be his last game in charge.

Wigan continued to have regular success in both league and cup competitions until 1974 when Wigan went eight seasons without winning any leagues or cups.

Eric Ashton coached Wigan from 1963 to 1973. In 1966, Wigan locked television cameras out of their ground in the belief that they affected attendances. They were fined £500 by the Rugby Football League. Wigan beat Oldham 16–13 in the 1966 Lancashire Cup Final. Billy Boston played his last match in the cherry and white, against Wakefield Trinity at the end of April 1968.

Wigan celebrated the centenary year of the club in November 1972, with a match against Australia at Central Park, on Saturday 17 November, the result finished as a 18–18 draw.

Wigan pulled off a surprise victory 19–9 over Salford in the Lancashire Cup Final which was played at Wilderspool, Warrington on Saturday 13 October 1973. Cup holders Salford had lost only one match prior to the final, against the touring Australians.

Ted Toohey became coach of Wigan in May 1974 before being sacked in January 1975, this would set the pattern of coaches lasting one or two seasons before being replaced. Star coach, Joe Coan then took control until he resigned in September 1976, the board accepted his decision &quot;with reluctance&quot;. Vince Karalius then took over but was sacked in September 1979, he was replaced by Kel Coslett.

===1980–1996: Relegation, subsequent promotion, and most successful period===
In 1980, Wigan were relegated from the top flight for the first time in their history and Coslett was replaced by George Fairbairn as player-coach. During the second division season they recorded a record average attendance for the division of 8,198. Wigan won promotion back to the top flight the following season but Fairbairn lasted no longer than May 1981 before moving to Hull Kingston Rovers. Maurice Bamford took over as coach of Wigan before being sacked in May 1982 and was replaced by Alex Murphy.

Maurice Lindsay came to Wigan in the early 1980s to join directors Jack Robinson, Tom Rathbone and ex-player Jack Hilton. Wigan became one of the first teams to go full-time professional in the league, this led to an upsurge in the fortunes of the club.

Between February and October 1987, under new coach, former New Zealand coach Graham Lowe, Wigan won a record 29 games in a row as follows: 20 Division One matches, 3 Premiership Trophy matches, 4 Lancashire Cup matches, 1 Charity Shield final, 1 World Club Challenge Final. Wigan defeated Australian club Manly-Warringah 8–2 in front of a crowd of 36,895 at Central Park for an unofficial World Club Championship (though many who were at Central Park still claim the attendance was closer to 50,000). It was the first time an English club side had beaten a team of Australians at rugby league since the 1978 Kangaroo tour. After Lowe left in 1989, Australian John Monie, a former premiership winning coach with the Parramatta Eels, continued the success at Central Park. From 1988 to 1995 Wigan won the Challenge Cup 8 seasons in a row including their 27–0 win over St Helens in 1989, the first time any team had been held scoreless in a Cup Final at Wembley; this period was Wigan&#x27;s most successful period to date. They also won the Championship seven times, League Cup four times, Premiership Trophy three times, Charity Shield twice and three World Club Championships.

In February 1990, Wigan announced a record £280,000 profit but by 1993 this had become a loss of £300,000 on a turnover of £3 million, in no small way to the cost of the Whitbread Stand that had been built at the clubhouse end of Central Park in 1991–92 at an estimated cost of £1.3 million. By March 1994 Wigan&#x27;s wage bill topped £2 million a year.

John Dorahy became coach for the 1993 season. Despite supervising Wigan through to the Challenge Cup and the Rugby Football League Championship, Dorahy was dismissed in May 1994, only days after the club&#x27;s return from Wembley. In a statement by the club, Dorahy was said to have been sacked for &quot;gross misconduct&quot;. Graeme West was appointed as coach, after fans petitioned for him to get the job.

In his first month as coach, at the end of the 1993–94 Rugby Football League season West secured the First Division Premiership Trophy against Castleford, and then traveled with the team to Brisbane, guiding them in their 1994 World Club Challenge victory over Australian premiers, the Brisbane Broncos in front of a WCC record attendance of 54,220. At the end of his first full season, he and the team won the League Championship, Challenge Cup, Regal Trophy, and Premiership—the &#x27;Grand Slam&#x27; of all 4 trophies. Even though Wigan dominated rugby league from 1985 to 1995, it was the only season the club achieved this feat. This would be somewhat surpassed in 2024, with Wigan winning all 4 trophies available to them in the same season, the World Club Challenge, Challenge Cup, League Leaders Shield and Super League Grand Final.

===1996–present: Summer era rugby===
Wigan played in a special 2 match challenge series against Bath RFC in 1996, with one game played under league rules, and the other under union rules. Wigan won the league game 82–6 at Maine Road, but lost the return union game 44–19 at Twickenham.

In July 1996 Andy Farrell was named the Wigan club&#x27;s captain. Farrell enjoyed a fantastic 1996 and was rewarded with the Man of Steel Award.

Eric Hughes became coach of Wigan Warriors, replacing Graeme West in February 1997 following an early exit from the Challenge Cup in 2 consecutive years. In 1997 the club was renamed as the Wigan Warriors. Wigan&#x27;s dominance came under threat with the new league now fully professional and the introduction of the salary cap and the 20/20 rule. After going out of the Challenge Cup to Salford in 1996 and St Helens in 1997, they returned to Wembley for the final time in 1998. Still undefeated in the league and the fact coach John Monie—in his second spell at Wigan—had never lost a cup tie meant Wigan were huge favourites against the unfancied Sheffield Eagles. But on 2 May 1998 the Eagles would go down in rugby league history causing the biggest upset in the competition&#x27;s history with a 17–8 win.

Wigan won the Minor Premiership and the first Super League Grand Final in 1998 with a 10–4 victory over Leeds at Old Trafford, Manchester.

In November 1999, coach Andy Goodway was sacked by Wigan chairman Maurice Lindsay after the Warriors&#x27; failure to win a trophy for the first time in 15 years. After a buy-out by Dave Whelan, both the Warriors and the town&#x27;s football team, Wigan Athletic, moved to the JJB Stadium. As part of the rugby league&#x27;s &quot;on the road&quot; scheme Wigan met Gateshead Thunder at Tynecastle, Edinburgh. Maurice Lindsay also returned as director. On an emotional day of high drama Wigan&#x27;s final game at Central Park was against arch rivals St Helens on Sunday 5 September 1999. Wigan legend Ellery Hanley returned as St Helens coach but a Jason Robinson virtuoso try meant the game was won by Wigan 28–20. The first game at the new stadium was a defeat in a Super League play-off match against Castleford on 19 September 1999.

Frank Endacott joined Wigan as head coach after the 1999 season and in 2000 Wigan finished top of the Super League and reached the Grand Final for the second time but were beaten 29–16 by St Helens. Endacott was sacked in 2001 following a string of poor results and was replaced by Australian Stuart Raper. Raper guided Wigan to the 2001 Super League Grand Final but were well beaten by Bradford Bulls, 37-6. That year Andy Farrell also set a new club record for points in a season with 429.

However, the following season Raper guided Wigan to their 17th Challenge Cup, defeating St Helens 21-12 at Murrayfield Stadium, 7 years after previously lifting the trophy. Wigan&#x27;s Kris Radlinski inspired the side with a player-of-the-match performance against the much-fancied Saints to claim the Lance Todd Trophy despite being in hospital the previous week with a foot infection.

Stuart Raper was sacked in July 2003 and was replaced by assistant coach Mike Gregory - Gregory oversaw an improvement and led the Warriors to a third place finish as Wigan became the first team from outside of the top-two to reach the Grand Final. However, Wigan fell short on the night and were defeated by Bradford Bulls 25-12.

In 2004 Gregory guided Wigan to the Challenge Cup final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff but Wigan could not repeat their 2002 feat and were beaten 32-16.

Defeat was Gregory&#x27;s final match as Head Coach of Wigan who travelled to the USA to receive treatment for an illness he contracted after an insect bite whilst in Australia.
It later emerged that Gregory was suffering with Motor Neurone Disease and he did not return as Wigan coach.

Denis Betts took over as Wigan Head Coach, leading Wigan to a fourth place finish in 2004. Despite play-off victories against St Helens and Wakefield Trinity Wildcats, Wigan missed out on the 2004 Grand Final, losing to Leeds Rhinos in the Final Eliminator.

After a stellar season played largely at prop forward, Wigan captain Andy Farrell was named Man of Steel for the second time.

In March 2005, Farrell signed for Rugby Union side Saracens. He was replaced as captain by Kris Radlinski. Wigan&#x27;s form in early 2005 was inconsistent, but they did defeat St Helens in the traditional Good Friday Derby 22-20 in front of a record crowd of 25,004. Betts was later demoted to Assistant Coach and replaced as Head Coach by former St Helens boss Ian Millward. However, Millward&#x27;s tenure was not a successful period and included embarrassing defeats to Leeds Rhinos and St Helens 70-0 and 75-0 respectively.

2006 proved to be another tough year for Wigan with Ian Millward being sacked following a run of one win in eight games which saw the club face a genuine threat of relegation. The Australian was replaced by Bradford Bulls and Great Britain coach Brian Noble. Despite a points deduction following a breach of the salary cap, the side rallied under Noble and eventually finished in 8th position just outside the play-offs.

In early 2006, club captain Kris Radlinski retired from playing owing to persistent injuries. Despite later coming out of retirement in an attempt to help the club avoid relegation, Radlinski was replaced as skipper by 23 year-old loose forward Sean O&#x27;Loughlin.

Wigan improved in 2007, inspired by the acquisition of Australian stand-off Trent Barrett and appeared set for a first appearance in the play-offs since 2004, however, this was placed under threat following another points deduction - taking the team from 4th to 9th place. Wigan also reached the Challenge Cup Semi Finals in 2007 but were defeated by Catalans Dragons. Following the points deduction and semi final defeat, Wigan Chairman Maurice Lindsay announced that he would stepping down from his role at the end of the campaign.

The Warriors recovered from a difficult mid-season to finish sixth in the regular season and qualify for the play-offs. In this play-off campaign, Wigan overturned a 30-6 deficit to defeat Bradford Bulls 30-31 in a match widely regarded as the greatest comeback in Super League history. The following week, Wigan defeated Hull FC 18-21 to set up a play-off eliminator with Leeds Rhinos. Unfortunately for Wigan, this proved one game too far and the Warriors were defeated 36-6.

At the end of the 2007 season, it was announced that Harlequins owner Ian Lenagan had purchased an 89% stake in the club.

The 2008 Super League season saw Wigan finish in fourth place - a best finish since 2004. However, the club again fell short of the Grand Final, losing 18-14 to Leeds Rhinos.

Wigan initially struggled in the 2009 Super League season and suffered an embarrassing defeat to winless Celtic Crusaders. Wigan again reached the Challenge Cup semi-final and play off final eliminator, but were defeated by Warrington Wolves and St Helens respectively.

Despite leading Wigan to five semi-finals in three seasons, Brian Noble&#x27;s contract as Head Coach was not renewed at the close of the 2009 season. Noble is credited with stabilising the Warriors following a tumultuous 2005 and 2006.

Noble was replaced by Melbourne Storm assistant coach Michael Maguire who was appointed as the new Head Coach ahead of the 2010 season.

One of Maguire&#x27;s first actions was to implement a &#x27;leadership group&#x27; in which several players would join Sean O&#x27;Loughlin as captain on a match-by-match basis.

Despite only making one major close-season signing, the upturn in Wigan&#x27;s fortune under Maguire was immediate - opening the campaign with a comprehensive 38-6 win at home to Crusaders. Maguire also led the Warriors to their maiden victory at Warrington&#x27;s Halliwell Jones Stadium, where the club had not won since its opening in 2003. Further success followed when Wigan defeated St Helens 10-18 in the traditional Good Friday fixture. This was Wigan&#x27;s first Easter victory over Saints since 2005 and meant Wigan won the final meeting between the clubs at Knowsley Road. Wigan finished the season in top spot for the first time since 2000 and claimed the League Leaders Shield. Following victories over Hull Kingston Rovers and Leeds Rhinos in the Super League play-offs, Wigan reached the Grand Final for the first time since 2003. Wigan went on to defeat rivals St Helens St Helens 22-10 at Old Trafford in front of 71,526 spectators - the club&#x27;s first league championship since 1998 and 19th in total. The club also swept the boards at the annual Man of Steel Awards, with Sam Tomkins winning young player of the year, Michael Maguire claiming coach of the year, winger Pat Richards taking the Man of Steel award whilst the club was named club of the year.

Victory meant that Wigan qualified for the 2011 World Club Challenge in which they were defeated 15-21 by Australian premiers St George Illawarra Dragons.

Ahead of the 2011 campaign, the leadership group was dropped and Sean O&#x27;Loughlin returned as sole captain - a position he would retain until his retirement in 2020.

2011 was another successful year for Wigan with the club reaching their first Challenge Cup Final for seven years, defeating Leeds Rhinos 28-18. Victory marked Wigan&#x27;s first Challenge Cup victory since 2002 and a first victory at Wembley Stadium since 1995. However, Wigan could not retain their Super League crown, losing in the play-offs to St Helens.

Following the conclusion of the 2011 season, Michael Maguire left his position to return to Australia to coach South Sydney Rabbitohs. Maguire is credited with returning the Warriors to the top table of British Rugby League after a difficult decade.

Maguire was replaced as Head Coach by his assistant Shaun Wane.

Wane&#x27;s debut season started poorly with a 16-20 defeat at home to Huddersfield Giants. However, Wigan&#x27;s form soon recovered, with Wane claiming victory in that season&#x27;s Good Friday Derby, defeating St Helens 10-28 in the first derby to take place at Langtree Park. Wigan also went on a 10-game winning streak which included thrashings of Saints at Magic Weekend and Leeds Rhinos at Headingley Stadium. Wane guided the Warriors to a first-placed finish and claimed the League Leaders Shield, but was unable to reach either the Challenge Cup Final or Grand Final - falling to Leeds Rhinos in the semi-finals of both competitions.

Warriors full-back Sam Tomkins was named 2012 Steve Prescott Man of Steel.

Expectations were varied ahead of the 2013 campaign, with the Warriors having lost several key players. However, it turned out to a be a memorable year for club. Wigan firstly claimed a 19th Challenge Cup victory, defeating Hull FC 16-0 at Wembley Stadium. Wigan then righted the wrongs of 2011 and 2012 in reaching the Grand Final - the Warriors recovered from a 16-2 deficit to defeat Warrington Wolves 16-30 and claimed a 20th league title and a League and Cup double - the club&#x27;s first since 1995.

Following victory in the Grand Final, Wigan broke with custom and travelled to Australia to contest the 2014 World Club Challenge, but were defeated 36-14 by the Sydney Roosters.

The Warriors finished in second place in 2014 and reached the Grand Final where they were defeated 14-6 by St Helens in a game that was overshadowed by prop forward Ben Flower&#x27;s red card for a brutal double punch on Saints halfback Lance Hohaia. The Warriors were also knocked out of the Challenge Cup at the quarter-final stage by Castleford Tigers.

Wigan again finished in second place in 2015 and reached an eighth Grand Final. However, they were again defeated - losing 22-20 to Leeds Rhinos in front of a record crowd of 73,512. Wigan suffered a shock early exit in the Challenge Cup - losing to Hull Kingston Rovers in the sixth round.

Wigan fared better in 2016. The club reached the semi-finals of the Challenge Cup, losing to Hull FC and recorded a third successive second-placed finish and a fourth straight Grand Final appearance. However, the Warriors were able to put the disappointment of the previous two years behind them and defeated Warrington Wolves 6-12. Victory marked Wigan&#x27;s fourth Super League title, and 21st Championship in total.

2017 was a mixed season for Wigan. The club claimed a record-extending fourth 2017 World Club Challenge victory with a win over Cronulla Sharks, 22-6. However, Wigan&#x27;s form dropped and in mid-season, the side went eight Super League matches without a win. The Warriors finished the season in sixth place, missing out on the play-offs for the first time since 2006. Wigan also lost out in the Challenge Cup Final, where they were defeated 18-14 by Hull FC at Wembley Stadium.

2018 was a brighter year for Wigan. The year began with a trip to Australia in Round 2 to play Hull FC in the first-ever Super League game to be played outside of Europe. Wigan were victorious at WIN Stadium, defeating Hull FC 24–10. At the Super 8s stage of the season, Wigan won an unprecedented 7 out of 7 matches including revenge for the Good Friday defeat by soundly beating arch rivals St Helens 10-30 at the Totally Wicked Stadium. Wigan reached a sixth Grand Final in nine years with a 14-0 play-off victory against Castleford Tigers where they again faced Warrington Wolves. Two tries from winger Dom Manfredi helped the Warriors to a 12–4 win in front of 64,892. This was the club&#x27;s fifth Grand Final win taking the overall total of League Championships the club has won to 22. Victory also avenged the Warriors exit from the Challenge Cup at the hands of the Wolves back in June.

In August 2018 it was announced that Shaun Wane would leave his position as Head Coach at the end of the 2018 season. Wane would be replaced by former Wigan half back Adrian Lam for the 2019 season, whilst club legend Shaun Edwards would return from Rugby Union to lead the side from 2020 onwards.

Victory in the Grand Final turned out to be Wane&#x27;s last act as Head Coach - he left the role having won three Grand Finals, a Challenge Cup, a League Leaders Shield, and a World Club Challenge, making him the most successful Wigan coach of the summer era. He is credited with maintaining the club&#x27;s status as a Rugby League powerhouse with an emphasis on homegrown talent.

As a result of victory in the Grand Final, one of Lam&#x27;s first games as Head Coach would be the World Club Challenge where the Warriors again faced Sydney Roosters. Unfortunately Wigan were unable to avenge the 2014 defeat and went down 8-20 in front of 21,331 at the DW Stadium.

In April 2019 it was announced that Shaun Edwards would not be taking up his role as Head Coach from 2020 onwards. Lam&#x27;s contract was later extended to 2020 and 2021 In May 2019, Wigan travelled to Barcelona to face Catalans Dragons at the iconic Nou Camp but were beaten 33-16. Despite a poor start to 2019, Wigan finished the regular season in second place, but suffered a shock defeat in the play-offs against Salford Red Devils, losing 4-28 at the DW Stadium to miss out on the Grand Final.

The 2020 Super League season was interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and a points-percentage system was implemented to account for the varying number of matches each team played. The Warriors claimed the League Leaders Shield and reached the Grand Final which was played at the KCOM Stadium in Hull. The final turned out to be one of the most dramatic in history - with scores tied at 4-4 and with ten seconds remaining, St Helens player Jack Welsby touched down to win the game 4-8.

The match was club legend Sean O&#x27;Loughlin&#x27;s last appearance for Wigan who retired aged 38. O&#x27;Loughlin was replaced as skipper for the 2021 season by Thomas Leuluai.

In the 2021 Super League season, Wigan endured a difficult campaign finishing in 4th place on the table. After winning their first five games of the campaign, the Warriors were knocked out of the Challenge Cup by Hull FC. Throughout the season, Wigan&#x27;s attack struggled to spark and the club suffered a defeat at home to St Helens in which they did not score a try. Five days later the club were defeated 0-14 at home by Leeds Rhinos - the first time the Warriors had been nilled at home in the Super League era. In August 2021 it was announced that Adrian Lam would leave his position as Head Coach at the end of the season. Lam&#x27;s final game was the elimination play-off match against Leeds Rhinos, in which the Warriors were again held scoreless at home, losing 0-8.

Supporters are divided on Lam&#x27;s tenure as Wigan coach. His detractors argue that he failed to deliver on his promise to play &#x27;flamboyant&#x27; rugby and that he had a poor record in important games. However, his defenders comment that he was hamstrung by the fall-out from the COVID-19 pandemic and from the confusion over whether Shaun Edwards would take up his role in 2020. It is also pointed out that Wigan were the only team to participate in 25 games in 2021, including many that took place midweek.

On 5 October 2021, Matt Peet was named as Wigan Head Coach with Shaun Wane returning in a director role. Sean O&#x27;Loughlin and Lee Briers also joined the coaching staff.

Peet oversaw an immediate improvement in the club&#x27;s form and reached the Challenge Cup Final, held at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. In a tight game, a late try from Warriors winger Liam Marshall claimed a 16-14 victory and a 20th Challenge Cup for Wigan. On 15 July 2022, Wigan&#x27;s Bevan French broke the individual record for tries in a Super League game, touching down seven times in a 60-0 win at home to Hull FC. Wigan finished the 2022 Super League season in second place on the table and were favourites to reach the Grand Final. However, the club suffered a shock 8-20 loss to Leeds in the semi-final which denied them a place in the decider.

Wigan captain Thomas Leuluai retired at the end of the season and was replaced as skipper by second-row forward Liam Farrell.

In 2023 Wigan were unable to retain the Challenge Cup losing in the semi-finals to Hull Kingston Rovers in golden-point extra time. However, following this defeat Wigan did not lose another game all season, in a 10-game winning streak that included a 0-50 hammering of Leeds Rhinos. Wigan claimed the League Leaders Shield and exacted revenge on Hull KR in the play-off semi finals, defeating the Robins 42-12 to set up a Grand Final with Catalans Dragons. In the Grand Final, the Warriors overcame the Dragons 10-2 to claim a sixth Super League title and a 23rd championship in total.

Bevan French was named Steve Prescott Man of Steel for 2023.

On 15 July 2023, it was announced that Warriors chairman Ian Lenagan would step down as Chairman and Shareholder on 30 November 2023, with his shares being sold to Mike Danson. Chris Brookes would replace Lenagan as Chairman.

Lenagan&#x27;s stewardship of the club is perceived by supporters as having restored the Warriors to their rightful place as one of the country&#x27;s elite rugby league clubs. During his sixteen years at the club, Wigan won 6 Super League titles, 3 Challenge Cups, 4 League Leaders Shields, and a World Club Challenge.

The 2024 season proved even more successful for the Wigan club and on 24 February 2024, the Warriors defeated Australian premiers Penrith Panthers in the World Club Challenge to claim a record-extending fifth title. Following victories over Sheffield Eagles, Castleford Tigers and Hull Kingston Rovers, the Warriors reached the Challenge Cup Final where they defeated Warrington Wolves 18-8 at Wembley to take their cup tally to 21. Final success meant that Wigan held all four major trophies simultaneously - the first time this had occurred since 2007. Later in 2024, Wigan retained the League Leaders Shield, topping the table in back-to-back seasons for the first time in the summer era. Following a 38-0 semi-final victory against Leigh Leopards, Wigan reached the Grand Final where they defeated Hull Kingston Rovers 9-2 in a low-scoring affair. Wigan&#x27;s Bevan French scored the only try of the game and was awarded the inaugural Rob Burrow Award as player of the match - this was following the renaming of the award from the Harry Sunderland Trophy.

Victory marked the Warriors winning back-to-back Grand Finals for the first time, whilst also completing a ‘Quadruple’ or &#x27;Grand Slam&#x27;, claiming the World Club Challenge, the League Leaders Shield, the Challenge Cup, and the Super League Grand Final in a calendar year - the first time such a feat had been achieved in the summer era and Wigan’s first Quadruple since 1994.

The win secured Wigan&#x27;s qualification for the 2025 World Club Challenge against NRL premiers Penrith Panthers in a rematch of the 2024 fixture. However, owing to each side&#x27;s pre-arranged fixture commitments, speculation remains over the status of the fixture. 
 In an October Instagram post, Panthers halfback Nathan Cleary expressed a desire for the fixture to take place at the NRL&#x27;s Magic Round. Warriors CEO Kris Radlinski also stated that he would seek to play the fixture &quot;at any costs&quot;, but the release of the 2025 Super League fixtures in November 2024 appeared to indicate that the fixture would not be taking place.

In the Super League era, Wigan have won 7 Super League titles, 5 Challenge Cups, 2 World Club Challenges, and 5 League Leaders Shields. The majority of this success came between 2010 and 2023, during the &#x27;Lenagan years&#x27;.

==Name==
The club started out life as Wigan Football Club &quot;(stylised as Wigan FC)&quot; in 1872. When the club was re-formed in 1879, the club&#x27;s name was Wigan Wasps Football Club. &quot;Wasps&quot; was dropped from the club&#x27;s name in 1881 and the club&#x27;s name was again Wigan Football Club (stylised as Wigan FC). As Northern Union evolved into Rugby League, Wigan would officially become Wigan Rugby League Football Club &quot;(stylised as Wigan RLFC)&quot; or officially written as Wigan Rugby League &quot;(stylised as Wigan RL)&quot; this being a shorter written version of the former rather than a name change. The club added Warriors to its name in 1997. The club was and still is commonly referred to simply as Wigan.

==Colours==
The colours cherry and white are the most synonymous with the club. The home kits have mostly consisted of the colours cherry and white since 1888 in different variations, usually hoops, but not always. The Wigan team first played in cherry and white jerseys on 19 September 1885 in a match against Bury. The club did not settle on the colours until 22 December 1888 when after this time there is no mention of Wigan deviating from these colours as the primary colours. It is known that the team did wear a variety of different-coloured jerseys at different times before 19 September 1885 and in-between that date and 22 December 1888. These included; blue and white hooped jerseys, black jerseys with white shorts and black socks, white jerseys, white-and-coral hooped jerseys and a chocolate-and-coral hooped jersey with black socks. The white Maltese cross was added to the club&#x27;s jerseys for the start of the 1884–85 season but how long this remained as a feature on the jersey is unknown. The white jerseys were worn on several occasions during the 1885 season and were also worn at least once during 1887. The chocolate-and-coral hooped jerseys were worn during the 1886–1887 season with black socks, however, the colour of the shorts which were worn is unknown. It is also unknown how many times Wigan turned out in the chocolate-and-coral jersey that year.

With some brief interludes, the club spent the majority of the 20th century wearing regular cherry and white hooped jerseys with white shorts.

From the late 1980s onwards shirt designs became more varied, but remained largely variations on cherry and white hoops. However, the club started to experiment with wearing red shorts as opposed to white.

From roughly 2015-onwards, the version of &#x27;cherry&#x27; red featured on Warriors home shirts has been a much darker shade of red. From the late 1980s to the late 1990s, Wigan&#x27;s away kit was usually royal blue and white hoops, with the template often being the exact same as the home kit, but in alternative colours. In the 21st century, royal blue and white away jerseys have made brief returns, notably in 2005 and 2016.

From 2022-onwards, Wigan&#x27;s third kit was a design inspired by their charity partners and a percentage of proceeds from sales would be donated to the respective charity.

Wigan released their kits for 2025 in November 2024. The home shirt features the traditional cherry and white hoops complete with black and gold trim whilst the shorts and stockings are both cherry red. The away kit is all navy blue with &#x27;electric blue&#x27; flashes across the front. The Warriors revealed their charity third kit on 23 November 2024 - an all-lilac kit in partnership with Wigan &amp; Leigh Hospice, a local charity that helped Warriors winger Liam Marshall&#x27;s mother Debbie, who died in February 2024.

==Club crest==
Wigan have used a variation of the coat of arms (which was granted to the Borough of Wigan on 8 April 1922) as the club crest for a large part of the club&#x27;s history. The club first used the crest on the playing jerseys for the 1948 Challenge Cup Final against Bradford. The crest appeared on the jersey in other future cup finals but would not become a permanent feature on the playing jerseys until 1984.

Below are further details on the Club Crest:

Excerpts from an Article, by Mr. Arthur J. Hawkes, Chief Librarian.

Possessing a series of town seals from the twelfth century onwards, Wigan, at the opening of the twentieth century still remained without &quot;ensigns proper to its order.&quot;

Wigan is one of the oldest boroughs in England (third oldest in Lancashire after Liverpool and Salford). Town liberties or borough rights existed in England in Anglo-Saxon times, several centuries before the Norman Conquest. Places like London, York, Winchester, Norwich, etc., are known from records to have exercised these privileges, and it may properly be inferred that Wigan also enjoyed them. Finally, we have the report of the Norry King of Arms in 1613 that &quot;the towne and bourrough of Wiggin was antiently Incorporated by the most noble Kinge, Kinge Hen, the first in the first yeare of his raygne&quot; (i.e., 1100)—a certified copy of which document is now in the Public Library. Under William the Conqueror, the borough privileges were restricted, but on the accession of Henry I they were largely restored by virtue of his great coronation charter of liberties. The liberties of individual towns were restored or confirmed by special charter, some of which are extant. If we can rely upon the report of the Herald in 1613, Wigan was one of the first boroughs to be so restored. Following this we have a long series of royal charters, mostly still extant, some containing special marks of royal favour, which charters will be detailed in the next number.

J. Paul Rylands describes the coat above as &quot;perhaps the very best of all Lancashire town arms, for it might, heraldically, belong to the Middle Ages, and is indeed symbolic of antiquity and loyalty.&quot; It is certainly a very privileged coat of arms, as few if any coats bear so many symbols of royal favour. Indeed, the incorporation of royal insignia into armorial bearings is jealously guarded and usually proscribed by the court officials. In Wigan&#x27;s new grant there are (1) A king&#x27;s Head, crowned, (2) the Royal &quot;Leopard&quot; (or &quot;lion couchant guardant&quot;), (3) a mediaeval royal crown, and (4) the supporting lions. The king&#x27;s head in the crest officially represents no particular king, in the words of the Rouge Croix herald (in whose hands the design took shape) it is intended &quot;to be a conventional likeness to an early English Monarch.&quot; It is actually modelled on the portrait of King Edward III, but from the point of view of the town it symbolises especially King Henry I. On Wigan&#x27;s earliest town seal—probably the 12th century—there appears to be a towered or castellated gateway over the centre of which is depicted what seems to be the crowned head of Henry I. These devices therefore, are taken as the chief symbols of the new bearings, the towered gateway becomes a Norman castle and the king&#x27;s head becomes a crest—indicating Wigan as a town of consequence and royal patronage at the opening of the twelfth century. The royal lion, again, marks another important period in Wigan history. Edward III, by a charter of 1350, granted Wigan the right (with several other towns) to use a royal seal known as the &quot;King&#x27;s Recognisance Seal,&quot; on which was figured the king&#x27;s head and the royal lion. The Somerset Herald expressed the opinion that as none of the other towns had made use of the king&#x27;s permission by adopting the figures in their arms, Wigan could with propriety include them, and his view prevailed with the Chapter of Heralds.

Supporters are nowadays usually granted only to the great cities, but Wigan&#x27;s ancient importance has been thereby recognised, the lions giving the distinction to a highly dignified and privileged coat of arms. There is a final feature of unusual interest. The branches of the mountain ash held in the lion&#x27;s paws add something to the conventional &quot;mantling&quot; or flowered scrolls which usually ornament armorial bearings. The design of the floriation is usually a matter for the artist and without heraldic significance. But in the case of Wigan&#x27;s arms, the mountain ash, known in the northern dialects as the Wiggin or Wigan Tree, forms a &quot;rebus&quot; or pun on the name of the town, and has the advantage of giving further symbolism to an already significant coat. The rebus has tradition behind it, for the Wiggin Tree is a conspicuous feature of several of the town&#x27;s mediaeval seals.

The motto adopted &quot;Ancient and Loyal&quot; is in keeping with the arms. For a great many years Wigan has on all occasions, official and unofficial, invariably referred to itself as the &quot;Ancient and Loyal Borough,&quot; but few are aware that authority for its use can be found in the charter of Charles II, the governing charter of the town until the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. In that charter Wigan is designated by the king &quot;an ancient borough&quot; and granted a &quot;special token of our favour for its loyalty to us,&quot; so that nothing could be more fitting than its adoption as the town&#x27;s motto.

On 1 November 2020, the club changed its crest to a new design. The club drew inspiration for the Warrior design element of the badge from the Brigantes who were Celtic Britons and controlled a large part of Northern England, including Wigan, in pre-Roman times. The name Brigantes became synonymous with the most fervent elements of the club&#x27;s support base dating back to the early 2010s.

The shield element of the new logo is taken from the original club crest as is the Ancient &amp; Loyal motto with the circular shape of the badge emulating the shape of the Northern soul logo. Wigan had a vibrant Northern soul scene back in the 1960s when the Northern soul music and dance movement first emerged. The background features the club&#x27;s famous Cherry and White hoops which was incorporated into the club crest for the first time. The date of the club&#x27;s foundation is also included on the club badge for the first time.

==Stadiums==
===Pre–1902===
Wigan Football Club played on Folly Field, Upper Dicconson Street. The club played its first match at Folly Field on 30 November 1872 and remained at the ground for four years. Wigan Football Club went on to become Wigan &amp; District Football Club, the newly named Wigan &amp; District Football Club played its matches at Prescott Street (The West End Grounds). The club played at Prescott Street until the club disbanded. With the re-formation of the club as Wigan Wasps Football Club, the club returned to Folly Field from 1879 to 1886 when it moved its matches back to Prescott Street.

Wigan played their home games at Wigan Cricket Club on Prescott Street until 1901 when they moved to Springfield Park which they shared with the town&#x27;s association soccer club Wigan United A.F.C. The first rugby match at Springfield Park was played on 14 September 1901 and was between Wigan and Morecambe in front of 4,000 spectators. The record rugby attendance for the ground was 10,000 achieved on 19 March 1902 when Wigan beat Widnes. Forty days later Wigan played their last game at Springfield Park when they defeated the Rest of Lancashire Senior Competition.

===1902–1999: Central Park===
In 1902 Wigan moved to their purpose-built rugby ground called Central Park. Wigan played their first game at Central Park against Batley on 6 September 1902, which Wigan won 14–8. The area was originally farm land called Central Field, with a row of houses already built along both north and south ends of the land (Hilton St and Colin St). By the end of the 1990s, the area had begun to suffer from its location next to the River Douglas as well as disused coal mines directly underneath, resulting in occasional drainage problems which affected the pitch.

Central Park would be the home of Wigan Rugby League until 1999, when they moved to the newly built JJB Stadium. The last match at Central Park was against St Helens on 5 September 1999, a game which Wigan won 28–20 in front of 18,179 supporters. As Wigan developed into one of the most famous rugby league clubs in the world, Central Park also became one of the most famous grounds.

Wigan won the 1987 World Club Challenge match against 1987 Sydney (New South Wales Rugby League) Premiers Manly-Warringah at Central Park played on 7 October. The try-less game, won 8–2, was played in front of a reported crowd of 36,895, though many of those in attendance believed the attendance was actually closer to 50,000.

The record attendance for a game at Central Park was 47,747 set on 27 March 1959 against St Helens.

===1999–present: The Brick Community Stadium===
Towards the end of the 1999 season Wigan Warriors moved to the newly built JJB Stadium (Renamed in 2024 to the Brick Community Stadium) which they currently share with the Wigan football club Wigan Athletic. The stadium is owned by Mike Danson, who is the majority shareholder. Warriors&#x27; first game at the then JJB Stadium was a Super League play-off match against the Castleford Tigers which Wigan lost 14–10.

The stadium has had numerous names since being built in 2007 dependant on its sponsorship.

Wigan used to have a state-of-the-art training facility at the small stadium Edge Hall Road in Orrell (now named the Co-Operative Community Stadium) where the first team, reserve team &amp; academy team prepared, trained and rehabilitated ahead of and after matches. It is also where the Reserve &amp; Academy sides used to play their home games.

Recently this site has been sold for development after the Warriors moved all team operations to the newly renovated Robin Park Arena next door to the Brick Community Stadium in a deal with Wigan Council. A multi-million-pound regeneration has turned this into one of the best training facilities inside of rugby league, whilst also maintaining world class facilities for other local sporting clubs and the general public to use.

Brick Community Stadium has an official capacity of 25,133. The Warriors&#x27; record attendance at the Brick is 25,004 set against St Helens on 25 March 2005.

==Training ground==

Wigan’s training ground is the Robin Park Arena, situated next door to the Brick Community Stadium.

==Academy==
Wigan&#x27;s academy and youth development system is regarded as one of the very best in the UK within rugby league and contributes immensely to the sport. The club has a very strong and proud tradition of producing a large quantity of high quality rugby league players. Wigan prides itself on having a significant group of homegrown talent within its first team squad. The players which Wigan produce often go on to represent Wigan&#x27;s first team or they may leave the club and play for other Super League and Championship clubs. Over the years, Wigan have faced Super League and Championship teams containing former players who have either debuted and had careers in the first team but have then left the club or have come through the youth development system and have moved on before playing for the first team.

==Supporters==
Wigan is one of the most well supported British rugby league clubs.

Home matches during the 1880s saw Wigan regularly attracted over 7,000 supporters. The rugby code often dwarfed those seen on the same weekend at Association Football matches around the country. Up until 1895, Wigan had 18 matches that attracted over 8,000 supporters on home soil whilst matches against Warrington, Swinton and Oldham were a big draw on away days. The highest recorded home attendance was for the 1886 Wigan Union Charity Cup Final between Wigan and Aspull which attracted 18,000 spectators.

During the 1880s, Wigan fans often took advantage of local train companies offering cheap rail fares for big matches. The local train companies took advantage of Wigan supporters who travelled in numbers to away matches. The most popular matches of that era included trips to Warrington and Swinton where between 2,000 and 3,000 supporters travelled regularly.

During the 2006 season, in which the team was struggling to avoid relegation, home attendances increased as fans came to support the club and offer vocal support, many of whom may have not attended on a regular basis previously.

The club averaged 16,016 per home game in 2007. In 2010 Wigan were officially the best-supported club in Super League with a higher average attendance than nearest rivals Leeds Rhinos. The club have now been confirmed as the best-supported club for the last three seasons of 2010, 2011 and 2012.

As a gesture of thanks, the 2008 season saw the Wigan fans have the squad number 18 dedicated to them, a practice which has since continued each season. Joe Lydon commented &quot;This is a new practice for clubs who recognise the extra special support which loyal fans can provide to their team in both good and bad times. It is particularly apt for Wigan fans&quot;&quot;.&quot;

From early 2008, the Wigan fans have often chanted to the tune of The Entertainer. One of the beginning lines of this particular chant is &quot;We&#x27;re the Greatest Club in the World&quot;.

The fans have their own supporters club, The Riversiders, who meet monthly and often have special guests at the meetings including past and present players, coaching staff and members of the Rugby Football League.

In 2010 some supporters set up a group to improve the atmosphere at both home and away games, known as the Wigan Brigantes, Brigantes being the name of the tribe that inhabited this and other large parts of northern England before and during the Roman era. The group started by erecting flags across the South Stand gantry at the DW Stadium, beginning with 12 at the start of the 2010 season and grew steadily from there. The group&#x27;s banner had the phrase &quot;Long After Tonight Is All Over&quot; as a nod to the Jimmy Radcliffe song that was a staple of the Wigan Casino club during the Northern soul era, and to show their rivals that their support would continue well after the final whistle had sounded. This was particularly true of some of Wigan&#x27;s away games during the 2011 season, where their fans often stayed well over half an hour after the final hooter singing to the tune of &quot;Dale Cavese&quot;.

There is also a regular fans&#x27; forum meeting with chairman Ian Lenagan and the current head coach to discuss the latest issues concerning the club and the work that is being done behind the scenes. So far every meeting has been a sell out.

Wigan&#x27;s fans and Wigan people in general are known as &#x27;pie eaters&#x27; or &#x27;pies&#x27; which is reference to the 1926 General Strike, when Wigan miners were forced to eat &#x27;humble pie&#x27; and return to work before miners in other towns, even though they had been on strike before the other towns joined in. Since then the word &#x27;pie&#x27; has come to mean the pastry rather than the metaphor &#x27;Humble Pie&#x27;, with many fine bakeries and bakers in the town.

==Rivalries==

===St Helens===
The club&#x27;s strongest and fiercest rivalry is with St Helens.

Matches between the two teams are played traditionally on Good Friday and Boxing Day, though the latter fixture has stopped following the move to summer rugby in 1996. The first meeting between the two sides took place in November 1895, where the two sides played out a 0-0 stalemate in front of 3,000 spectators at Knowsley Road.

The two clubs are two of the most successful clubs in world Rugby League and regularly compete against one another for silverware.

Wigan boast of having beaten the Saints in the last meetings at Central Park and Knowsley Road and the first meeting at Langtree Park. Saints did, however, defeat the Warriors in the first meeting at the JJB Stadium. The sides have met in the Challenge Cup Final a total of six times, both sides having been successful three times. However, the Saints boast a better record in Super League Grand Finals, having defeated Wigan three times in four meetings.

Overall, Wigan have a superior record over their rivals, having won 205 of the contests to St Helens&#x27; 138.

As of October 2024, the last meeting between the two sides was on 17 August 2024, with Wigan winning 20-0 at Magic Weekend.

===Leigh Leopards===
The Leigh Leopards are traditional rivals of the club due to both being located within the Borough of Wigan. Matches between the two clubs are, therefore, local derbies.

The rivalry between these two clubs, however, has been muted due to the fact that the two clubs have regularly competed in different competitions and, therefore, have not played each other consistently (during the Super League era, Wigan and Leigh have only been together in Super League for five seasons, in 2005, 2017, 2021, 2023 &amp; 2024).

The 2023 season saw heightened attention being given toward the rivalry as both clubs enjoyed successful seasons, the branding of the rivalry as ‘The Battle of The Borough’ gained notoriety because of this.

As of October 2024, Wigan have won 154 meetings to Leigh&#x27;s 55.

At the time of writing, the last meeting between the sides took place on 5 October 2024 in the Super League play-off semi-final, Wigan winning 38-0.

===Warrington Wolves===

Wigan also have a rivalry with neighbours Warrington Wolves. This rivalry has become particularly fierce from the late 2000s onwards, owing to the Wolves&#x27; emergence as a club that contends for silverware. The Warriors also failed to claim victory at Warrington&#x27;s Halliwell Jones Stadium for seven years following its opening in 2003. Furthermore, the two clubs compete annually for the Locker Cup.

The clubs have met in two Challenge Cup Finals and three Super League Grand Finals, Wigan having won all five. Wigan supporters enjoying mocking Wolves fans for their club&#x27;s failure to win the Championship since 1955.

Wigan also boast the superior record in head-to-head meetings, claiming 188 wins to Warrington&#x27;s 126.

The last meeting between the two sides was on 26 July 2024, the Wolves running out 4-40 winners.

In July 2024, it was announced that Wigan and Warrington would play each other in Las Vegas on 1 March 2025, in the first Super League game to take place in the United States.

===Leeds Rhinos===

A more notable rivalry is one with Leeds Rhinos, given the two clubs&#x27; respective status as two of the most successful and best-supported clubs in British rugby league. 
Between 2007 and 2018, the only season either Leeds or Wigan did not win the Super League Grand Final was in 2014. Curiously enough, the sides only met once in that period at Old Trafford, with the Rhinos winning 22-20 in 2015. However, that is the only time the Rhinos have defeated the Warriors in a major final - Wigan having beaten Leeds in three Challenge Cup Finals, and the 1998 Super League Grand Final.

In head-to-head meetings between the two sides since 1896, Wigan have claimed victory 155 times whilst Leeds have won 106.

At the time of writing, the last match between the two clubs resulted in a 38-0 win for Wigan.

==In the community==
Wigan confirmed via the official website that they had been granted charitable status on Wednesday 29 April 2009 via the &quot;charitable arm&quot; of the club the Wigan Warriors Community Foundation. Wigan Warriors carry out extensive community work that stretches from Amateur Rugby League Football clubs to Schools as well as running highly successful community training camps for young people. A part of the community work is visiting primary schools to deliver a programme specifically designed for young people entitled &#x27;Lessons for Life&#x27;. The programme is delivered via a geographic family of schools approach and results in each school receiving two hours of Rugby League coaching per week for a six-week period. Additionally every school is offered the opportunity to start an extra curricular club and take part in a &quot;Warriors Tag Festival&quot;. The club will now be able to deliver an even more extensive community programme via the Wigan Warriors Community Foundation.

Wigan became the first club in the country to receive Sport England&#x27;s Clubmark Gold Award. The Gold award, only available from 1 April 2009, shows the clubs commitment to Duty of Care and Child Protection, Coaching and Competition, Sports Equity and Ethics and Club Management. The Gold award not only meets the minimum standards in all areas, but surpasses them and meets additional criteria too.

Combined with education provider ProCo, Wigan have established a work based learning academy in the town to provide opportunities to young people whilst also providing a permanent base for its scholarship and academy squads. The Work Academy has been given the name &quot;Central Park&quot; in reference to Wigan&#x27;s former home and also makes reference to the education provider.

<text>St Helens R.F.C., commonly known as Saints, is a professional rugby league club in St Helens, Merseyside, England. Founded in 1873, the club is one of the oldest members of the Rugby Football League, and one of the most successful clubs in its history. The club plays their home games at the Totally Wicked Stadium and currently compete in Super League, the top tier of British rugby league system. Since 1961 the club&#x27;s home colours have been distinctive white shirts with a prominent red &quot;V&quot; on the chest of the jersey.

St Helens have won the League Championship 17 times, the Challenge Cup 13 times and World Club Challenge on three occasions. Since the foundation of the Super League in 1996, Saints have been the most successful team, winning 10 championships (including 4 in a row between 2019 and 2022), and being runner up a further 5 times (losing to Leeds Rhinos each time between 2007 and 2011), while winning the League Leaders Shield 9 times.

They club have a traditional rivalry with Wigan Warriors as the two most successful clubs in the British game, and close regional rivals. The clubs face each other traditionally on Good Friday. The club also have a local rivalry with the Warrington Wolves and a rivalry with Leeds Rhinos borne out of close competition during the Super League era.

==History==

===Early years (1873–1945)===
St Helens are the oldest members of the Rugby Football League. Founded as St Helens Football Club on 19 November 1873 at the Fleece Hotel by William Douglas Herman, they played their first ever match on 31 January 1874 against Liverpool Royal Infirmary. They became known as St Helens Rangers up until the 1880s. The club moved from the City Ground in 1890 where they had shared with St Helens Recs when neither were members of the Northern Rugby Football Union. They defeated Manchester Rangers in the first match played at Knowsley Road.

In 1895 the club were one of 22 clubs that resigned from the Rugby Football Union and established the Northern Union. The first match of the new code was an 8–3 win at home to Rochdale Hornets before 3,000 spectators, Bob Doherty scoring St Helens&#x27; first try. They played in a vertically striped blue and white jersey—a stark contrast to the well known broad red band which would become the kit for the club later. The club reverted to this kit for one season during the rugby league centenary season in 1995.

The Challenge Cup was launched in 1897 and it was St Helens who contested its first final with Batley, at Headingley, Leeds. The &quot;Gallant Youths&quot; of Batley emerged victorious 10–3, with Dave &quot;Red&quot; Traynor scoring the lone St Helens&#x27; try.
Between 1897 and 1901, St Helens were not successful, even generally considered a mid—table side.&lt;ref name=&quot;1897/1898 Lancashire League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1898/1899 Lancashire League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1899/1900 Lancashire League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They finished second to bottom in the 1900–01 Lancashire League season, meaning they did not qualify to compete in the national league the year later. In the 1901–02 season, however, they did finish third in the Lancashire league.&lt;ref name=&quot;1901/1902 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1902–03, the combined Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues saw St Helens enter for the first time. St Helens were placed in Division 1 but finished next to bottom and suffered relegation.&lt;ref name=&quot;1902/1903 Division 1 League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Promotion was gained at the first attempt,&lt;ref name=&quot;1903/1904 Division 2 League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; only for another poor year to see them finish once again in a relegation position.&lt;ref name=&quot;1904/1905 Division 1 League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However the two Divisions became one League to save the club from a second relegation.&lt;ref name=&quot;1905/1906 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The Champion fortunes that St Helens fans&#x27; greet today were certainly not apparent in this period, with the club finishing fourth to bottom in 1907,&lt;ref name=&quot;1906/1907 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; third to bottom in 1908,&lt;ref name=&quot;1907/1908 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and consistently mid—table between 1909 and 1913.&lt;ref name=&quot;1908/1909 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1909/1910 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1910/1911 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1911/1912 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1912/1913 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 June 1913, St Helens Recs joined the Northern Union after defecting from rugby union and association football. The Recs were based individually at the City Road ground, after previously sharing with St Helens, before their move to Knowsley Road, when neither played rugby league. The Recs played their first game on 6 September 1913. St Helens now had two professional rugby league teams. In both sides first year in co—existence, St Helens finished yet again in a disappointing low mid—table finish.&lt;ref name=&quot;1913/1914 Emergency War League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

During the First World War, St Helens struggled to compete and failed to complete the full fixture list of the Emergency War League on two occasions,&lt;ref name=&quot;1915/1916 Emergency War League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1916/1917 Emergency War League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1917/1918 Emergency War League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; with the club finishing mid—table in the first year of the war,&lt;ref name=&quot;1914/1915 Emergency War League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being beaten by 37 points to 3 by Huddersfield in that year&#x27;s Challenge Cup Final.

The aftermath of the war was still taking its toll on national sport, not merely the club&#x27;s ability to compete and complete fixtures, on 31 January 1918 &#x27;close down&#x27; due to a lack of finances following a 22–0 defeat by Widnes. Saints re-open on 25 December 1918 and are beaten 20 points to nil by St Helens Recs in a friendly fixture at City Road. In the shortened 1918–1919 season, St Helens played only nine times.&lt;ref name=&quot;1918/1919 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The club&#x27;s lack of success and disappointing league finishes continued for another seven seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;1919/1920 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1920/1921 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1921/1922 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1922/1923 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1923/1924 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1924/1925 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1925/1926 Northern Football Union League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The club defeated town rivals the Recs in the Lancashire County Cup Final by 10 points to 2 in the 1926–27 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;1926/1927 Lancashire Cup Final&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The season after, they were trophyless, finishing tenth in a 28—team league.&lt;ref name=&quot;1928/1929 Lancashire Final&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; One year after the Challenge Cup&#x27;s début at Wembley, St Helens reached the final there where they were defeated by 10 points to 3 by Widnes in 1930. They won their first ever National Championship in the 1931–32 season,&lt;ref name=&quot;1931/1932 National League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; defeating Huddersfield 9–5 in the final.&lt;ref name=&quot;1931/1932 National League Final&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This was the same season that they won their second Lancashire League,&lt;ref name=&quot;1930/1931 Lancashire League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the first coming in the 1929–30 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;1929/1930 Lancashire League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; They lost the 1933 Lancashire Cup Final to Warrington, whilst finishing in no competitive position in the league once more.&lt;ref name=&quot;1932/1933 National League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; St Helens reached no finals or achieved any more honours during the remainder of the 1930s. Also, what appeared to be building as something of an inter—town derby between the two St Helens clubs was struck down as St Helens Recs played their last game on 29 April 1939, as, due to the economic depression, it was not possible for the town to sustain two teams.

Like during the First World War, the club could not enjoy having a full—time squad during the Second World War and struggled to compete. They did not compete in the National Championship until a 17 team Emergency War League was formed in the 1941–42 season,&lt;ref name=&quot;1941/1942 Emergency War League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and did not win any regional honours. They finished bottom of the EWL in seasons 1942–43&lt;ref name=&quot;1942/1943 Emergency War League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and 1943–44&lt;ref name=&quot;1943/1944 Emergency War League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and next-to-bottom in 1944–45.&lt;ref name=&quot;1944/1945 Emergency War League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-war (1945–1979)===
The club&#x27;s fortunes that had seen them be successful so rarely the decade previous did not change in the 1940s. After the commitments of the Second World War, St Helens still found it hard to compete, and the trend of finishing as a mid—table side was once more apparent.&lt;ref name=&quot;1945/46 National League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1946/47 National League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1947/48 National League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1948/49 National League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1949/50 National League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first two years of the 1950s, the last two years of Peter Lyons&#x27; reign, also ended trophyless.&lt;ref name=&quot;1950/51 National League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1951/52 National League Table&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of Jim Sullivan as head coach in 1952 heralded a successful era for St Helens, and helped to establish the club as a respected force in British and eventually world rugby league. Under Sullivan, St Helens reached, and lost, the 1952–53 Challenge Cup final. They didn&#x27;t have long to wait for trophies as St Helens won the Lancashire Leagues, in 1952–53, The 1953 Championship final against Halifax was held at Manchester City&#x27;s Maine Road ground; in front of a crowd of over 50,000, Saints won their second Championship 24–14. They also won the 1953 Lancashire Cup, beating Wigan 16–8 at Swinton, the first time the two old rivals had clashed in a major final, Saints.

Sullivan took Saints to their first victory in the Challenge Cup final (against Halifax in 1956), On Saturday 24 November 1956, St Helens inflicted a touring Australia its biggest ever defeat with a 44–2 win.

The following year saw Saints win the 1956-7 Lancashire League 1956–57 and they won it again in 1958–59. 
Sullivan&#x27;s second championship came in 1958–59. A second Lancashire County Cup came in 1960–61,
Ex—St Helens captain and prop-forward Alan Prescott took over from Jim Sullivan as head coach in 1959. Perhaps the golden era of the club came in the 1960s, as well as more lately in the Super League era. With a galaxy of stars including Tom van Vollenhoven, Alex Murphy, Dick Huddart, Cliff Watson, Ray French and Vince Karalius, the 1960s was a decade of great success for the Saints. In Prescott&#x27;s first season as coach he lifted the Lancashire League in the 1959–60 season. During this decade, the recognisable &#x27;red vee&#x27; strip first appeared in 1961 for the final against Wigan. St Helens won this epic 12–6, and the kit has since become synonymous with the club. Mick Sullivan joined Saints for £11,000, then a record transfer fee. They won the Lancashire Cup in the 1961–62 season, with a 25–9 success over Swinton (at Central Park, Wigan) seeing yet more silverware come St Helens&#x27; way under the management of Prescott. After his departure in 1962, Stan McCormick led the club to retaining the Lancashire Cup in his first year, again beating Swinton; and St Helens made it a quadruplet of Lancashire Cup successes with wins against Leigh in 1964, and once more Swinton in 1965, the latter success under coach Joe Coan. St Helens won the Western Division Championship under McCormick&#x27;s rule, beating Swinton 10–7. St Helens, under coach Joe Coan, lost the 1964–65 Championship final to Halifax at Station Road, Swinton.&lt;ref name=&quot;1964/65 Championship Final&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The 1965 New Zealand tourists appeared at Knowsley Road on Wednesday 15 September. Saints inflicted a 28–7 defeat on their visitors, their biggest loss of the tour. A League and Cup double was achieved under Coan in the 1965–66 season, whilst they lost the Floodlit Trophy final against Castleford. St Helens were beaten by Wakefield Trinity in the 1967 Rugby Football League Championship Final at Station Road, Swinton on 10 May 1967 by 20 points to 9 in a replay, after a 7–7 draw 4 days earlier. This would be Coan&#x27;s last year in charge at St Helens after a highly successful period as boss. He was replaced by Cliff Evans.

Evans&#x27; first full season in charge at the club saw him win the club&#x27;s eighth Lancashire Cup in 1968; winning 13–10 against Warrington after a replay. St Helens retained the Lancashire Cup the year later, whilst also winning the Lancashire League for being the highest placed Lancashire side in the National standings,&lt;ref name=&quot;1968/69 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and they also reached the final of the Floodlit Trophy that season, where they were beaten 7–4 by Wigan. The 1969–70 season would be the year that Evans would leave his post, but not without winning a National Championship, beating Leeds in the final after finishing third overall.

The 1970s were also seen as a successful spell for St Helens, as they reached three Challenge Cup finals in the period. Jim Challinor took over from Cliff Evans in 1970, and in his first season, he won the Championship,&lt;ref name=&quot;1970/71 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and reached two finals, the Lancashire Cup and Floodlit Trophy, losing both. In this season, a European Championship—not dissimilar to today&#x27;s World Club Challenge—was contested between St Helens and French champions St Gaudens. Over a two—legged game, St Helens won 92–11 on aggregate.&lt;ref name=&quot;1970/71 European Championship Final 1st Leg&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1970/71 European Championship Final 2nd Leg&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In their first Challenge Cup Final of the 1970s, they defeated Leeds in 1972 16–13, in addition to winning their first Floodlit Trophy, after losing out in the final three times before, with an 8–2 win over Rochdale. The club reached the Championship final in that season, but were beaten. No success was achieved in seasons 1972–73 and 1973–74, with St Helens finishing third and second in the respective years.&lt;ref name=&quot;1972/73 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1973/74 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This could be a possible reason for Jim Challinor&#x27;s replacement with Eric Ashton as head coach. In Ashton&#x27;s first season in charge, St Helens won the Championship,&lt;ref name=&quot;1974/75 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and contested the inaugural Premiership Final, losing 26–11 to Leeds. They repeated their first Challenge Cup success of the 1970s three years after the first against Widnes in 1976 where they were victorious by 20–5 in the famous &#x27;Dads Army&#x27; final. They also won the Premiership against Salford, and the Floodlit Trophy against Dewsbury in a successful season. In the same year, St Helens lost to Eastern Suburbs in an unofficial World Club Challenge Final by 25 points to 2. The club won the Premiership in 1977, but, on 13 December 1977, Saints lost 26–11 to Hull Kingston Rovers in the final of the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy. In 1978 Leeds avenged their 1972 loss against St Helens, emerging winners by 14–12. St Helens lost the Floodlit Trophy in the 1978–79 season, going down to Widnes. The 1979–80 season was unsuccessful, with St Helens finishing mid—table.&lt;ref name=&quot;1979/80 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Ashton left the club after this disappointing year.

===The 1980s, and early to mid-1990s===
Former club player and Welsh international Kel Coslett took over as coach in June 1980. However, his spell as coach was not nearly as successful as his spell as a player, and St Helens won nothing whilst under Coslett&#x27;s command, finishing mid-table in both seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;1980/81 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1981/82 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He held the post for two years before handing over to Billy Benyon. Not in-keeping with several of his predecessors, Benyon did not enjoy any success in his first season as St Helens coach, losing the Lancashire Cup final of that year to Warrington. Nothing was won in the 1983–84 season,&lt;ref name=&quot;1983/84 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but Saints won back the Lancashire Cup, with a 26–18 win at Wigan in the 1984–85 season. They also won the Premiership in the same season with a 36–16 victory over defending champions Hull Kingston Rovers at Elland Road in Leeds. The 1984–85 season saw the arrival (for one season only) of giant Australian international centre Mal Meninga who quickly became a crowd favourite at Knowsley Road. In Benyon&#x27;s last season as coach, 1985–86, nothing was won.&lt;ref name=&quot;1985/86 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrival of Alex Murphy as coach in 1986 produced some colourful displays from a team that was widely regarded as an entertaining team to watch, but seemed to be constant runners-up. This was illustrated by the defeat by Halifax in the Challenge Cup final at Wembley, 19–18, in 1987. Success was achieved in 1988 when St Helens lifted their one and only John Player Trophy with a 15–14 victory over Leeds in January 1988, at Central Park, Wigan. Neil Holding with the crucial, match-winning drop-goal. They, however, lost to Widnes in the Premiership Final at Old Trafford at the end of the season, further showing this team&#x27;s ability to get to finals and not be able to compete on the best stage. Nothing was achieved in the next two seasons,&lt;ref name=&quot;1988/89 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1989/90 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; including a defeat in the 1989 Challenge Cup Final and Murphy stood down as coach.

Murphy was succeeded by Mike McClennan in February 1990. In his first season, McClennan took St Helens to the 1991 Challenge Cup Final, where they were defeated by 13 points to 8 by Wigan. They won the Lancashire Cup, in the 1991–92 season, beating Rochdale Hornets. They also lost the Premiership Final that season, losing to Wigan. In 1993 the club avenged their defeat by Wigan the season previous to win the Premiership, in the same season that they won the Charity Shield, and lost the Lancashire Cup final. McClennan was head coach until December 1993, when Eric Hughes succeeded him as head coach in 1994. Under Hughes, St Helens only reached the one, Regal Trophy Final, where they lost to Wigan in 1996 by 25 to 16. They finished fourth in both of Hughes&#x27; seasons in charge.&lt;ref name=&quot;1994/95 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1995/96 League Tables&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of trophies in the St Helens cabinet, after the club had suddenly become so accustomed to success, would need to change in the &quot;new&quot; brand Super League that formed in 1996; hence Hughes&#x27; departure in 1996 and replacement with Australian Shaun McRae.

===Summer era===

Following on from their most constant ambition for successes, first experienced really in the 1960s, Saints became one of the most successful side of the summer era. Since the inception of Super League in 1996, they have won the title on eight occasions, and have added seven Challenge Cups to their five previous successes. Indeed, they won the inaugural Super League, albeit by finishing top of the league before the play—off era. St Helens defeated Bradford 8–6 in the 1999 Super League Grand Final, their first Grand Final, with more than 50,000 people witnessing Chris Joynt lift the trophy at Old Trafford. They also won the World Club Challenge in 2001 and 2007, beating Brisbane both times. In 2023 they then beat Penrith Panthers 13-12 in Australia to win it for a third time. 

====Late 1990s====
The success of the Saints in Super League began under the leadership of Shaun McRae in 1996. During his tenure the club won one league title (1996), a year in which he was named Super League&#x27;s coach of the year, and enjoyed back—to—back successes over Bradford in the Challenge Cup (1996 and 1997). St Helens lost consecutive Premiership finals to Wigan in 1996, and 1997. 1998 proved to be a trophyless year, and Ellery Hanley succeeded McRae in 1999, after the Australian left for new Super League side Gateshead. Hanley led Saints to Grand Final success against Bradford in October of his first year in charge. Hanley was considered by many to be a polarising figure and after several acrimonious disagreements with the St Helens board of directors, he was sacked a month into the following season. Ian Millward was appointed as Hanley&#x27;s successor as head coach.

====2000s====

=====Millward&#x27;s reign and a controversial sacking (2000–2005)=====
Under Millward, St Helens quickly became the most exciting team in the competition, playing expansive, attacking rugby. He saw them soundly beaten in the 2000 World Club Challenge, losing 44–6 to Melbourne, but lead them to retaining their Super League title in 2000 beating Wigan 29–16. They also won the Challenge Cup in 2001; 13–6 over Bradford, with the final held at Twickenham Stadium for the first time, and the 2001 World Club Challenge, earning a 20–18 win over the Broncos. Millward then lead Saints to the top of Super League VII, and to reclaim the Super League title in the 2002 Grand Final, Sean Long snatching a last minute 19–18 win over the Bradford with a drop—goal. They lost the 2002 Challenge Cup Final to Wigan at Murrayfield Stadium by 21 points to 12. They were hammered in the 2003 World Club Challenge by Sydney by 38 points to 0. In this season, they failed to win a trophy after being knocked out of the Challenge Cup by Leeds at the semi—final stage, and the Super League play—offs by Wigan at the same stage. In 2004 they beat arch—rivals Wigan 32–16 at the Millennium Stadium, Cardiff in front of a capacity crowd of 73,734 people to win the Challenge Cup, Long gaining his second of an eventual three Lance Todd Trophies.

Millward&#x27;s reign was not without controversy and his St Helens career ended controversially after he was suspended in May 2005. He was sacked for gross misconduct a week later. Daniel Anderson was appointed as coach, Millward was then made coach of archrivals Wigan.

=====The Anderson era (2005–2008)=====

Daniel Anderson saw his new team become the first team to top the Super League and fail to reach Old Trafford in 2005. However,
St Helens won the 2006 Challenge Cup Final at Twickenham Stadium, beating Huddersfield 42–12. Scrum-half Sean Long was awarded the Lance Todd trophy for a record third time for his man—of—the—match performance during the final.

St Helens followed up their Challenge Cup win by claiming the League Leader&#x27;s Shield, before cementing their reputation as the team of the year by defeating Hull 26 points to 4 in the Super League Grand Final. Once more St Helens confirmed their status as the outstanding team of the summer era. Additionally, Paul Wellens received the Man of Steel Award for the 2006 season.

In December 2006 St Helens were awarded with the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Team Award at the Annual BBC Sports Personality of the Year Ceremony. This accolade recognises the best team in any sport within the United Kingdom. At the same ceremony Daniel Anderson was given the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award – this was the first time a rugby league coach had won the award.

After a slow start to the 2007 season, Saints added to their history by beating Brisbane 18–14 to win the 2007 World Club Challenge. 
In July, they beat Super League rivals, Bradford, to reach the first Challenge Cup final at the new Wembley Stadium. Here, St Helens successfully defended their Challenge Cup by defeating Catalans Dragons 30–8 in the final on 25 August 2007. They were beaten in the Grand Final that year by Leeds by 33 points to 6, despite finishing at the top of the league ladder for the third successive season. James Roby, however, became the second St Helens player, and home—grown talent in two years to win the Man of Steel Award.

Saints success in the Challenge Cup continued in 2008 with a victory at the new Wembley Stadium, this time defeating Hull F.C. 28–16. Paul Wellens received the Lance Todd Trophy after sharing the award with team-mate Leon Pryce the year earlier.

They also achieved first place again in the 2008 Super League season—for the fourth year running—winning the League Leaders Shield, and beat Leeds 38–10 for the right to go to Old Trafford to contest the Grand Final. However, St Helens were once again defeated by Leeds in the Grand Final, by a margin of 24 to 16, on 4 October 2008. James Graham, on a positive note, made it a hat—trick of ex—Blackbrook Royals to win the Man of Steel Award whilst playing for St Helens. This would be Anderson&#x27;s last game in charge of the club, as he announced he was to return to Australia and the Parramatta Eels of the NRL. St Helens fans and players alike were saddened to see Anderson leave, after not only upholding the tradition of St Helens exciting brand of rugby, but giving them a defensive and disciplined edge that was never apparent under Ian Millward. His personality and relationship with the fans was an additional reason why St Helens fans were disgruntled in him leaving after four years in charge and why next boss Mick Potter faced a fair amount of criticism in his initial period as boss.

=====The Potter years (2009–2010)=====
Mick Potter was announced as the successor to Anderson, which received many plaudits from the St. Helens fans and the European game as a whole, as the year previous he had led the Catalans Dragons to a record—high third—placed finish in the league. On 9 August 2009, St Helens reached a record ninth consecutive Challenge Cup semi—final, where they were beaten by 24 points to 14 by the Huddersfield Giants. This prevented Saints from reaching the final at the new Wembley Stadium for a third successive time and from winning the cup for a fourth time running. This defeat naturally came as a shock to the St Helens faithful, after so often in the last 15 years seeing the team reach the pinnacle of this competition and go on to win the cup. It was from here that the criticism began, and questions were raised particularly of his tactics and his activity (or lack of) in the transfer market.

On 3 October 2009, Saints defeated fierce rivals the Wigan Warriors to book their place at a fourth consecutive Super League Grand Final,
only to lose out to the Leeds Rhinos in the final, 18–10, making the Leeds Rhinos the only team to win the Grand Final three times consecutively. A 20-year-old Kyle Eastmond scored all of Saints&#x27; points. A trophyless year for the first time since 2003 was another catalyst to Potter&#x27;s critics abusing and slating his appointment, with even rumours of rifts within the changing rooms.

====2010s====

2010 was the year that saw Potter surrender to his critics and leave St. Helens. Criticisms from club legends like Paul Sculthorpe and Sean Long regarding his personal skills with the fans, as well as the continued fan rejection saw him let his contract run out and, initially, seek a job in the NRL, but eventually, and perhaps surprisingly, join Bradford on a two—year contract. Names like Royce Simmons, Mal Meninga, and assistant coach Kieron Purtill, were linked with the job for 2011. Simmons was the chosen man for the job, as announced on 22 July 2010. The 2010 season would also see legendary hooker and captain Keiron Cunningham retire from the game after 17 years with his one and only club. However, Cunningham would not be leaving without leaving a lasting legacy on the club. A lifelike bronze statue of Cunningham was built and placed on display in the town, before being transported to the club&#x27;s new stadium upon its construction in 2012. He would additionally take up a coaching role with the academy, as well as a strength and conditioning role with the first team. In light of these decisions, neither Cunningham nor Potter halted their personal and the St Helens team quest for success; shown by their tenth successive semi—final appearance in the Challenge Cup. However, Saints failure to perform on the big stage was once more shown, going down in this semi—final by 32–28. Defeating Huddersfield Giants in the qualifying semi—final in the 2010 play-off series by 42–22 not only saw Saints qualify for their fifth Grand Final in five years, but also saw the final ever game to be played at Knowsley Road. Fittingly, Cunningham snatched the final ever try at the famous old ground in typical fashion from dummy—half. However, for the fourth year running, St Helens once more proved flops in the Grand Final. One of the finest finals of the Super League era was anticipated, but the flamboyant Saints that the fans saw so rarely under Potter once more failed to materialise, and, in front of a near sell—out crowd of 71,526, they fell to a 22–10 loss to rivals Wigan. It was not the romantic finish to the Saints careers of Potter, Cunningham or any of the departing members of the squad that many had hoped for, but nevertheless, a new era was just around the corner, as Simmons&#x27; reign began.

=====Beginning of a new era (2011–present)=====

Australian Royce Simmons took over from compatriot Mick Potter for the start of the 2011 season. As the club awaited completion of the new stadium, all home fixtures in 2011 were played at the Halton Stadium in Widnes, effectively meaning St Helens were forced to play an entire season of away fixtures. In addition, they suffered upheaval in terms of the playing squad; having already lost the influential Cunningham to retirement and other club legends like Sean Long, the start of the season was overshadowed by the news that Kyle Eastmond, who had been earmarked as Long&#x27;s replacement, and inspirational leader James Graham were both looking to leave the club. A number of serious injuries to further key players such as Leon Pryce and Ade Gardner meant the team was facing an uphill battle on the field all season. However, despite all the problems faced, St Helens defied the odds to reach their 11th Challenge Cup semi-final in a row, and at the end of the season they qualified for their sixth consecutive Grand Final. However, for the fifth year in a row they were on the losing side, as the injury-plagued squad finally succumbed to Leeds. However, the 2011 season saw the emergence of a new crop of talent, with players such as Jonny Lomax and Lee Gaskell stepping up to fill the gaps left by senior players and earning rave reviews for their performances.

In 2012, the club moved into their new home at Langtree Park. However, the season started with a terrible run of results, which culminated in Royce Simmons being sacked in March. With assistant coach Kieron Purtill also leaving, the coaching reins were taken up by youth coach Mike Rush for the remainder of the 2012 season, with Keiron Cunningham acting as his assistant. Following St Helens&#x27;s defeat by Wigan in the quarter-final of the Challenge Cup, which ended a run of 11 consecutive semi-final appearances, it was announced that Nathan Brown would be taking over as head coach for 2013, with Rush moving back into his previous role.

At the end of the Super League XIX regular season, St Helens claimed the League Leaders&#x27; Shield and reached the 2014 Super League Grand Final against Wigan where they won the match 14–6 claiming their 13th premiership.

In the Super League XXIII season, St Helens claimed the League Leader&#x27;s Shield and Ben Barba who had joined the club that year won the Man of Steel award. St Helens were favourites to reach another grand final but were upset in the preliminary final by Warrington 18–13 at Langtree Park.

During the Super League XXIV season, St Helens reached the Challenge Cup final against Warrington but lost the match 18–4 at Wembley Stadium.

At the end of the Super League XXIV regular season, St Helens won the League Leader&#x27;s Shield for a second consecutive year after finished 16 points clear of second placed Wigan.
St Helens would go on to reach the 2019 Super League Grand Final at Old Trafford against Salford. St Helens won the match 23–6 securing their 14th championship.

At the end of the 2020 season, St Helens finished second behind league leaders Wigan. After easily accounting for Catalans Dragons in the semi-final, St Helens played against Wigan in the 2020 Super League Grand Final. With only seconds remaining and with the scores locked at 4-4, St Helens scored a try after the siren through Jack Welsby to win back to back championships in the most dramatic of circumstances.

On 17 July 2021, St. Helens won the Challenge Cup for the first time in 13 years beating Castleford in the final 26–12. St. Helens had trailed the match at half-time 12–6.
St Helens finished the 2021 Super League season in second place on the table. They then went on to defeat Catalan Dragons 12–10 in a hotly-contested Grand Final, securing the club&#x27;s first league and cup double since 2006 and an historic &#x27;three-peat&#x27; - becoming only the second team in the summer era to win three consecutive championships.

St Helens ended the 2022 regular season as League Leaders, thus earning them a bye to the semi-finals. They beat Salford 19-12, to reach their 4th consecutive Grand Final. They faced Leeds in the Grand Final, after Leeds beat Catalans in the eliminators, and Wigan in the semi-final. St Helens won the match 24–12, to win their fourth final in a row, and by doing so, they become the first team in Super League history to win four in a row.

Before the start of the 2023 Super League season, St Helens travelled to Australia for the 2023 World Club Challenge. A week before the match, St Helens played one pre-season trial fixture against St. George Illawarra which St Helens won 30–18 at WIN Stadium.
In the week leading up to the World Club Challenge game against Penrith, many pundits, former players and coaches predicted St Helens would lose the match heavily with Phil Gould stating &quot;Penrith should be allowed to declare at half-time&quot;. St Helens would go on to win the World Club Challenge game 13-12 in golden point extra-time to claim their third trophy in the competition. St Helens had led the match 12-0 until a late try by Penrith took the game into extra-time.
In the 2023 Super League season, St Helens finished third on the table equal on points with league leaders Wigan and the Catalans Dragons. In the elimination playoff, the club defeated Warrington which set up a match with Catalans at the Stade Gilbert Brutus. St Helens lead the match until the final minute when Catalans player Sam Tomkins scored a try underneath the posts to win the match for Catalans and end St Helens four-year dominance of the competition.
St Helens began the 2024 Super League season strongly winning six of their opening seven games. However, injuries in the middle of the season to key players saw results drop. On 26 July 2024, St Helens were defeated by Leigh 46-4 which meant the club had lost five matches in a row for the first time since the Super League era began.
St Helens would finish the 2024 Super League season in sixth place on the table, their lowest finish of the Super League era. The club were eliminated in the first week of the playoffs against Warrington. St Helens were not expected to win the game but took Warrington to golden point extra-time where George Williams would kick the winning drop goal for Warrington.

==Academy==
The St Helens academy has produced some of the finest youngsters, potential stars and internationals the world of rugby league has seen. Although initially, players were signed either from other clubs, or would go straight into first team reckoning after being signed from their amateur club at a much later age than today&#x27;s system; as the game became more widespread in the town, across the North—West and nationally, a system had to be introduced in order to suffice the amount of youth talent that the club homed. More early examples of players that made the grade following on form their stints in the academy and reserves (previously known as the &quot;St Helens Colts&quot;) include Steve Prescott, Paul Forber, Gary Connolly, and Chris Arkwright. St Helens&#x27; traditional policy with youth was to make them better players for the club. Now, however, it can be argued that Saints look to make them internationals, with no less than five of the current St Helens squad&#x27;s youth products having gone on to represent either Great Britain or England or both. St Helens youth policy does not operate solely in the borough boundaries of the town. Indeed, many of St Helens current and past squads call areas like Widnes, Wigan, Cumbria and Oldham home. St Helens have, also, branched even into rugby union territory and other wider national areas for youth players; most recently, Daniel Brotherton, a winger from Northampton, signed a professional contract with the club, and has made great strides in the under 18s after his signing from Northampton Demons.

==Women&#x27;s side==
==Rivalries==

===Wigan Warriors===

There is a strong rivalry between St Helens and Wigan; the local derby between the two clubs has been traditionally regarded as the biggest in British rugby league, as well as one of the oldest in world rugby league. Both being founder members of the Northern Rugby Football Union, the derby has been played since 1895, making it amongst the most historical derbys in both British and global rugby league. Remarkably, the first encounter between the fierce rivals ended in a 0–0 draw at Knowsley Road, The games were traditionally played on Boxing Day, however were moved to Good Friday, during the busy Easter period in rugby league. More recently, the game was even played on Maundy Thursday in Super League. In all league encounters between the two since 1895, there have been 235 games, with Wigan having won nearly double the number of games that St Helens have. Saints winning 83, drawing 11 and losing 141. All competitive games, i.e. cup and league games combined, show that in the 366 games played, St Helens have won 141, there have been 19 draws and Wigan have won 206. They too have contested no fewer than 6 Challenge Cup Finals, and have met in three Super League Grand Finals; St Helens winning 29–16 in 2000, with Wigan initially gaining revenge in 2010, with a 22–10 win, before Saints claimed the 2014 Super League Grand Final by a score of 14–6, taking a 2–1 lead in their Super League Grand Final head-to-heads. Wigan and St Helens have also met in 4 Premiership Finals, Wigan winning 3, St Helens once, 3 Lancashire County Cup Finals, St Helens winning two, Wigan one, and one Floodlit Trophy Final in 1968, Wigan winning 7–4. The two have traditionally met each other in the Magic Weekend too. The two teams have a pretty even record, winning two (at Millennium Stadium in 2007 and 2008) and losing two (at Murrayfield in 2009 and Etihad Stadium in 2012), with one draw (at Millennium Stadium in 2011) in five ties. St Helens greatest winning margin and the highest game score between the two in competitive football was a 75–0 win in a 2005 Challenge Cup round 6 game. Wigan&#x27;s biggest win was a 65–12 win in Super League II, 1997.

===Bradford Bulls===

Saints contested several finals in the modern game with Bradford Bulls, following up from their vast successes respectively in previous decades. When known as Bradford Northern, Bradford experienced their period of success largely in the 1940s, at a time when St Helens struggled to compete due to the commitments of World War II. In fact, it was only in the 1950s that St Helens won their first Challenge Cup and National League, and at this time, when St Helens were establishing themselves and improving in the 1950s, and 1960s, Bradford were disproving, and in fact folded in 1963. So the contest between the two can be doubted as a historical or traditional one. However, during the modern, Summer era, the game between the two gained prestige. The two contested consecutive Challenge Cup finals in 1996 and 1997, and later in 2001, St Helens winning all three. In Super League Grand Finals, St Helens and Bradford met twice, in 1999 and 2002, St Helens again winning all encounters.

===Leeds Rhinos===
Leeds have arguably the strongest rivalry with St Helens, out of all the Yorkshire clubs that have a history with St Helens. They have contested the last three Super League finals, but the rugby they have produced in recent years is considered amongst the best in Super League. The derby is also sometimes considered a contest in terms of pride between the two counties. Leeds and St Helens have also a historical background, contesting the 1971–72 and 1977–78 Challenge Cup Finals, each team winning one each. However, the derby is often noted for its bad behaviour—on and off the field. Especially recently, with incidents like the Ryan Bailey &quot;chicken wing&quot; tackle on Maurie Fa&#x27;asavalu in 2008, the presence of James Graham when the two meet, as well as the numerous fights that have broken out between the two sets of players, the game is certainly regarded as a feisty one, as well as one that produces entertaining rugby. Such activities off the field and between games like fights between supporters, has led to some fans being discouraged from attending the fixture at Knowsley Road; shown by somewhat disappointing crowd figures, such as an example of 11,048 in 2010.

===Warrington Wolves===

The other &quot;big&quot; North West club in Super League, Warrington, have also built up an anticipated derby contest with St Helens, particularly within Super League. As St Helens are unbeaten at Knowsley Road against the Wire since 1996, as well as boasting a generally impressive record against the Wolves in all meetings in Super League, the game is seen as an opportunity for Warrington to rectify their record against the Saints. In terms of cup and league final meetings; the two have met in two Lancashire Cup finals, St Helens winning once after a replay in 1967, and one Premiership final, St Helens winning in 1977. However, they remarkably have never met in Challenge Cup or Super League Finals. On 26 February 2011, Warrington Wolves beat St. Helens for the first time in 10 years ending the Saints Hoodoo over the club. The fixture was played at the Saints temporary home at Widnes. The Wolves also beat the Saints in the reverse fixture to do the league double for the first time in 17 years. In 2012 the Wolves beat St. Helens in the Grand Final elimination clash at Langtree Park to book the Warrington Wolves a place at the Grand Final.

==Associates==

===Junior rugby in St Helens===
There is a massive junior and youth contingent of rugby league players in St Helens. Clubs such as Thatto Heath and Blackbrook Royals have produced many of the former and current superstars in St Helens&#x27; squads over the years, and continue to do so. Clubs in the St Helens area also include Bold Miners, Portico Vine, Pilkington Recs, Haydock Warriors, Newton Storm, Eccleston Lions and Haresfinch Hawks which provide players for St Helens through the junior years and the scholarship schemes at the club, before eventually signing professionally at 16. But St Helens&#x27; youth roots do not stop in the St Helens area. Indeed, club legend Keiron Cunningham signed for the club from Wigan St Judes, and Saints also look to clubs like Wigan St Patricks and Orrell St James in the Wigan area, and Halton Farnworth Hornets in the Widnes area for youth talent. However, a criticism of the St Helens scouting system is that they tend not to look at players beyond the junior ages (6–16 years old), and talented players who continue into amateur rugby tend to be signed very rarely.
===Feeder clubs===
Without having strict feeder sides, such as the system that exists in Australasia, St Helens have, in the last 20 years, particularly with the inception of the dual—registration scheme in 2009, built up partnerships with Co-operative Championship sides like Widnes and Leigh. St Helens have also been known to loan fringe players to &quot;less strong&quot; Super League sides such as Salford and Crusaders and previously Widnes. St Helens have also forged links with the Canada Rugby League (CRL) and their team Toronto City Saints, who have adopted the popular piece of St Helens insignia in their crest. Outside of rugby league, St Helens have forged partnerships with British Basketball League side Mersey Tigers, and English Premier Ice Hockey League team Manchester Phoenix.

==Supporters==
St Helens are one of the best supported teams in Super League, averaging 11,543 according to 2014 figures. Situated, prior to their recent move to Widnes, in Eccleston and Thatto Heath, a lot of support naturally derives from that area. Many strongholds of support also come from the Eastern side of the town; areas like Blackbrook, Haydock, and Parr. However, there exists considerable support towards Newton, Billinge and Ashton also. Their support is also not restricted to the town, with bases in Liverpool, Manchester, Birmingham, Northamptonshire, the South and North Wales.

The club also have their own supporters clubs, one for the club itself which has folded, and one for fans in the South. International, as well as national support is also strong with Saints. A recent survey showed fan bases in Australia, the United States, France, Spain, Ireland, Scotland, Canada, the Middle East, Chile and Greece. The club also have something of a fan base forming in the Far East, with fans from Singapore and Japan.

==Colours and badge==

===Colours===

In their rugby football days and early years as a rugby league club, St Helens wore a vertically striped blue and white jersey with blue shorts and socks. In their initial period at Knowsley Road, St Helens wore a similar jersey, but the stripes were horizontal, and the colours were blue and grey. These colours however were dropped in favour of a more traditional to today, red and white design. The jersey had a single broad red horizontal band, on a white background, and was used until 1961.

In the 1961 Challenge Cup final against Wigan, the strip still seen today—the famous red V—was first utilised. In 1981, the club changed colours again, albeit temporarily, when Umbro designed and manufactured a French—style jersey of blue, with a white and red V. These colours were donned for two years, before the traditional colours were reverted to.

1985 saw the first jersey that was supported by a visible sponsor—St Helens Glass. Umbro were once again the designers of this varsity blue jersey with a royal blue vee—shaped chevron, a kit similar to the away kit of 2008. This was also the first jersey to feature the famous stickman of St Helens insignia. The 1985 New Zealand tour jersey was similar to the home shirt of 2009, sponsored also by Pilkington.

Between 1991 and 1994, a somewhat controversial and odd design of jersey was employed, where the chevron that St Helens had now adopted in place of the traditional V finished three—quarters of the way down the shirt. Umbro remained the club&#x27;s kit suppliers until 1994, when Stag took over. Their jerseys were far more lightweight than what they had replaced, and they chose to revert to a more conventional fashion of red V in their designs. The kit used first by the club was reverted to during their centenary year in 1995.

In 1997, yet another change of design that was controversial with the fans, a kit that featured a white drop—down V with a black and red mesh design at the bottom of the jersey. This was Mizuno&#x27;s first design, taking over from Stag. The traditional red V was once more reverted to, after the controversial design, with a more circular design used for the 1999 season. In 2000, a more regular V was seen again. In 2003, a triple—V design was seen, and the first to be used by long—serving kit designers Puma AG. 2004 saw a double curvy red V used, before, in 2005, yet again tradition was reverted to in the design and this design was used until 2009. The away strip used in 2005 was the famous blue strip with a dark blue V. 2009 saw the long red V of 1985&#x27;s design appear again, before, in 2010, a casual thin red V was seen.

In 2010, the club used the first kit they played a rugby league game design as a commemorative strip, to celebrate their 110th and final year at the ground. 2011 saw the Puma contract expire, and Australian manufacturing giants ISC take over the making of the jerseys. This strip saw a somewhat shorter red vee, compared to the ventures of the design in 2009 and &#x27;10.




===Badge===

The club&#x27;s jerseys were initially adorned by the town&#x27;s coat of arms. This was utilised until 1985. However, as Saints became a more national institution, they decided that a more recognisable badge needed to be adopted. The 1985 season therefore saw the famous stickman of St Helens first used. This was used as the main jersey emblem until 1991, when the St Helens sports club emblem, not dissimilar to the coat of arms used previously, was seen. This was used until 1996, when, with the implement of Super League into the British rugby league calendar, Saints chose to display a badge that featured an overlapping &quot;S&quot; and &quot;H&quot; in red, with the club&#x27;s name around the border. This was used until 2010, when the club decided to unofficially rebrand to &quot;Saints RL&quot;, to coincide with them leaving Knowsley Road, and going &quot;on the road&quot; to Widnes for a season. The new crest was in the shape of a shield, and featured the over lapping &quot;S&quot; and &quot;H&quot; that the previous logo featured, but also displayed a red vee within the design, and &quot;Saints RL&quot; in upper case lettering at the top of the shield. This new crest drew criticism from large sections of the St Helens faithful, who were afraid of the club losing its connection to the town to attract a wider fan base.

===Kit manufacturers and sponsors===
Since 2015 St Helens&#x27; kit has been supplied by O&#x27;Neills. Previous suppliers include Umbro (1986–94), Stag (1995–96), Mizuno Corporation (1997–99), Y2K (2000), Exito (2001–02), Puma (2003–10), and ISC (2011–14).

Their current main shirt sponsor is Home Bargains. Previous main sponsors have included St Helens Glass (1986–87, 2000–01), McEwan&#x27;s Lager (1987–98), John Smith&#x27;s (1999), Caledonia (2002), Comodo (2003), All Sports (2004–05), Earth money (2006–07), Pilkington Activ (2008–09), Frontline (2010), Medicash (2011), Typhoo (2012 - 2016), RCMA Group (2017), and Cash Converters (2018 - 2021). St. Helens were also sponsored by Gillette for a one-off appearance at the 2004 Dubai Rugby 7s invitational.

See Below:
==Mascots==
During the Super League era, the participating teams have adopted mascots and nicknames usually in alliteration with the name of their home town. Initially, the St Helens mascots were Bernard and Bernadette, St Bernard dogs; depicting something of a married couple with their on-field humorous antics. However, in 2009, the mascots changed to Boots and Bernard; happy and angry masculine characters. Bernard doesn&#x27;t appear as often as Boots, with Boots being a more child-friendly image for the club, while Bernard retains the &#x27;seriousness&#x27; of the mascots role to the club.

==Stadiums==

St Helens&#x27; former stadium was Knowsley Road, renamed in 2008 to the GPW Recruitment Stadium for sponsorship reasons. Prior to this, in particular when St Helens were playing simply rugby football, they shared the City Ground with St Helens Recs. They left this stadium in 1890 for Knowsley Road and played there for 120 years. The ground at the time of its construction was considered modern, with one seated stand, and three standing areas that could, prior to strict safety regulations set in place, hold up to 40,000 people, shown by their record home crowd of 35,695 against Wigan in 1949. In their first match at the new ground, St Helens beat Manchester Rangers, played under rugby football rules. After the great schism of 1895, and St Helens joining the NRFU, their first game at Knowsley Road under traditional rugby league rules was against Rochdale, in front of 3,000 spectators. Over the years, however, age took its toll on the ground. Despite the big names like Meninga, van Vollenhoven, Lyon etc. coming to the club, it was constantly argued that, unlike other big clubs, St Helens did not have the stadium to suit their on—field talent. In 2006, the ground was treated to something of a makeover, after financial input from St Helens big money sponsors Earth Money. This aided the ground in gaining international rugby, with a fixture between Great Britain and New Zealand being held there in 2006. However, in 2008, St Helens were given a warning letter from the RFL, as a result of the ensuing licensing system that was to be introduced into Super League in 2009, stating that the quality of their current stadium was too poor for the expected quality of a licence in the league. Thankfully for Saints, they were permitted by the council to begin construction on a new ground, and confirmed that they would move away from Knowsley Road in 2011. It was announced that the new complex, to be built on an unused glass site in Peasley Cross, was to feature at least 12,000 seats, a large car park, and a Tesco store next to the ground. In addition to this, an iconic bridge, directly linking the ground to the town centre went under construction on 9 August 2010. Whether the stadium would be ready for the beginning of the 2011 season was always uncertain, and grounds such as Leigh Sports Village were suggested to home Saints for the period between. However, the Halton Stadium, Widnes was the chosen venue for Saints for the 2011 season, and they played all of their home games there, before permanently relocating in 2012. Saints currently play at the Totally Wicked Stadium.

<text>The Melbourne Hawks were a planned Australian Football League (AFL) team that would have consisted of the merger between the Melbourne and Hawthorn clubs at the end of the 1996 season. Out of all the proposed merger combinations in the 1990s, it seemed most ideal, as it was known that Hawthorn had a football team which had success (8 premierships in the previous 25 years) but were in a dire financial situation—as opposed to Melbourne, which had a sound financial base but were a club which had not won a premiership for over 30 years.

==Background==
Since the mid-1980s, the formerly all-Victorian Victorian Football League (VFL) competition had undertaken a large expansion program which saw the league expand from being a state-based competition (centred around the inner suburbs of Melbourne) to a national competition. The decision to undertake this expansion was in response to elite national leagues being run by other sporting codes (for example the Australian Rugby League, the National Basketball League, and the National Soccer League), which threatened to undermine interest in football at both a junior and elite level. The VFL expansion included new teams from Perth, Adelaide, and Brisbane, in addition to the relocation of South Melbourne to Sydney, and saw the league change its name from the VFL to the Australian Football League (AFL).

The expansion led to Victoria holding a disproportionately large number of teams relative to the other states. By the mid-1990s, there were eleven teams based in Victoria – ten of those in the inner suburbs of Melbourne – and concerns were raised about the long term viability (both on the field, and economically) of some of the weaker Melbourne-based clubs. Members of the AFL Commission (the governing body for the competition) began to worry that, relative to the new interstate clubs and more powerful Victorian-based teams, the weaker Melbourne-based clubs would not have a sufficiently large supporter base to survive in the new national competition. Statistics published in newspapers like the &quot;Herald Sun&quot; showed that several Melbourne-based clubs (including Hawthorn and Melbourne) only had a fraction of the membership base of either their interstate or cross-town rivals. It was suggested by some at the time that the Melbourne market could realistically support no more than six to eight teams.

The AFL, under CEO Ross Oakley, proposed that the preferred outcome for these smaller Melbourne-based clubs would be to merge (or amalgamate) with other smaller teams. According to the AFL at the time, mergers would create super-clubs which would retain at least some of the traditions and history of its former teams; clearly preferable to having both teams eventually financially collapse. Merging with other Melbourne-based clubs, rather than relocating interstate, would allow local supporters to continue attending their teams&#x27; matches. Based on this logic, the AFL undertook an active program of pursuing mergers between Melbourne-based clubs. The AFL began this policy by offering A$6 million to any newly merged football team (an offer which grew to A$8 million by mid-1996).

Within Melbourne, discussions about potential mergers were often greeted with deep suspicion and open hostility. While the growth of a national competition from the former VFL has arguably been highly beneficial to the code of Australian rules football overall, throughout the 1980s and 1990s, many Melburnians were opposed to reform attempts. The merger debate led to widespread accusations that the league&#x27;s administrators had grown out-of-touch with the sport&#x27;s grass-roots supporter base. The league openly discussing the elimination of some Melbourne-based clubs through mergers led to widespread anger, and disillusionment, towards the league.

==Merger proposals==
Upon pressure and incentives from the league, and saturation of the dire warnings about the consequences of too many teams based in Melbourne, a number of Melbourne-based clubs began investigating and pursuing potential mergers. Some proposals raised in the local media included various combinations of Melbourne, Hawthorn, St Kilda, Footscray, Fitzroy, North Melbourne and Richmond, and only a late fightback campaign had averted a merger between Fitzroy and Footscray in 1989. Carlton, Collingwood, Essendon, Geelong were generally exempt from these proposals due to their financial success.

===Case for a merger===
Of the potential mergers that were speculated about in the media, the one which perhaps seemed to make the most sense was the potential merger between Melbourne and Hawthorn. On the surface, the merger appeared to make sense for a number of reasons:

* Throughout the 1980s and early 1990s, Hawthorn had fielded exceptional teams which had won the club a succession of grand final appearances (eight in nine years) and premierships (five in nine years). Hawthorn, under then-coach Ken Judge, had also undertaken a youth recruitment campaign which had netted the club a number of promising players, including future Brownlow Medalist Shane Crawford.
** In contrast, Melbourne had not won a premiership in more than three decades and suffered from a relatively weak on-field performance.
* Melbourne was in a relatively strong financial position.
** In contrast, Hawthorn was suffering from mounting debts and financial losses. It had struggled to obtain and maintain corporate sponsorship, at one point in 1992 not having a corporate sponsor in spite of having won the previous Grand Final.
* Hawthorn had a centralised training facility, administration centre, and social club (on land owned by the social club) at its Glenferrie Oval complex. The team&#x27;s training facilities had recently been upgraded and were amongst the best in the league.
** In contrast, Melbourne did not have a central base: it trained at the Junction Oval in St Kilda, had its administration facilities in Jolimont, and had a social club in Sandringham.
* Both clubs were perceived to have had a traditionally middle-class supporter base; Melbourne had a historical connection to the Melbourne Cricket Club, while Hawthorn was based in the middle class, inner-eastern suburb of Hawthorn.
* Both clubs, in contrast to the stronger Melbourne-based clubs (like Collingwood, Carlton, or Essendon), and the stronger interstate teams (like Adelaide, or West Coast), had a relatively small membership base.

It is perhaps from a combination of these reasons that negotiations would proceed further between Melbourne and Hawthorn than between other potential merger partners.

===Negotiations===
The negotiations advanced considerably and settled on a number of key aspects of the proposed team. Speculation about ongoing merger negotiations often appeared in the mainstream media prior to the official announcement, with several key details leaking to the press. Key points related to the club&#x27;s identity which were agreed upon during negotiations prior to the official announcement included that:

* The new team&#x27;s name would be &quot;Melbourne&quot; and would use Hawthorn&#x27;s &quot;Hawks&quot; nickname
* The new team&#x27;s guernsey would resemble Melbourne&#x27;s, except feature a gold &#x27;V&#x27; and a gold Hawk
* The amalgamated team would use Melbourne&#x27;s red and blue with Hawthorn&#x27;s gold
* Hawthorn&#x27;s Hawk would be the new team&#x27;s logo
* New club best and fairest award to be known as the Crimmins–Truscott Trophy
* New club song combined Melbourne&#x27;s theme song and Hawthorn theme song, lyrics were:
 &quot; We&#x27;re the Melbourne Hawks, We&#x27;re the high-flying hawks! &quot;
 &quot; We&#x27;re the mighty Melbourne Hawks! &quot;
 &quot; We play each game, and we play to win! &quot;
 &quot; Watch out! We play it with a grin! &quot;
 &quot; Every heart beats true for the gold, red and blue, &quot;
 &quot; As we sing this song for you: &quot;
 &quot; One for all and all for one, two will make us stronger... &quot;
 &quot; Keep your eye on the Mighty Melbourne Hawks! &quot;

Some commentators noted that the merged team would more closely resemble Melbourne than Hawthorn and speculated whether Hawthorn suffered from a weaker bargaining position as a result of its weak financial situation.

Under the package offered by the AFL, the transitional arrangements for the merged club would be as follows:
*A $6M payout from the AFL over three years, with the only condition that paying off creditors be the first priority
*Ten home games at the Melbourne Cricket Ground each year from 1997 until 1999, then alternating between nine and ten games until 2007.
*A senior list of 44 players in 1997, reducing to 42 in 1998, before dropping to the standard 38 in 1999.
*Unrestricted access to players from both Hawthorn&#x27;s and Melbourne&#x27;s lists when compiling the initial playing list.
*Permission to exceed the league&#x27;s salary cap (then $2.9M/yr) by $300k in 1997, $200k in 1998 and $100k in 1999.
*Free membership for children in 1997
*A $225k advanced payout to implement and promote the merger, whether it happened or not

==Don Scott and &quot;Operation Payback&quot;==
In the wake of the official merger announcement, Don Scott (a former Hawthorn footballer) launched the &quot;Operation Payback&quot; campaign. Aided by the business acumen of former Pacific Dunlop executive Ian Dicker the campaign, which would be backed by other former Hawthorn footballers including Dermott Brereton and Brian Falconer, was multifaceted and included a number of aims:

* To launch a motion officially opposing the merger proposal, and to present the anti-merger case, at the extraordinary general meeting where Hawthorn members would vote on the merger proposal
* To run a fundraising campaign to alleviate Hawthorn&#x27;s immediate debt problems
* To secure business support (including potential sponsors and bank overdrafts) for the survival of Hawthorn
* To secure the support of prominent past and present footballers for the anti-merger campaign at Hawthorn

== Joe Gutnick ==
In the weeks following Scott&#x27;s launch of the Operation Payback campaign, a similar anti-merger campaign was launched for the Melbourne Football Club by former premiership player Brian Dixon, who was aided by millionaire businessman Joseph Gutnick. Gutnick, a Melbourne supporter who had accumulated his wealth (and earned the nickname &quot;Diamond&quot; Joe Gutnick) through investments in Western Australian mining, pledged to donate A$3 million to Melbourne if the merger vote was defeated.

=== Popular backlash to the merger proposal ===
Following the launch of Operation Payback, and Gutnick&#x27;s campaign at Melbourne, a vocal backlash to the merger proposal emerged amongst the supporters at both clubs. Banners with slogans including &quot;No Merger&quot; and &quot;Operation Payback&quot; became a common fixture at both Hawthorn training sessions, Hawthorn matches, and at Glenferrie Road. Other signs appeared, including several which decried the system of &#x27;proxy votes&#x27; for members unable to attend the anti-merger meeting (it was speculated by some of those who opposed the merger proposal that proxy votes would help the pro-merger cause). It is important to note, however, that this opposition was not universal: several thousand members (as noted earlier) ended up voting in favor of the merger proposal; including a majority of Melbourne supporters. In some cases, those supporting the merger were equally as passionate as those who opposed it.

==Merger game==

The end of the 1996 season saw Melbourne and Hawthorn play each other in the last round of that season. The &quot;merger game&quot;, as it was called, was a spirited contest as it was a likely possibility that it would be the last Hawthorn vs Melbourne contest and, as the result that Melbourne could not make the finals and Hawthorn needed to win the game by any margin to have any chance to contest the 1996 finals series, many supporters saw this game as a last chance to see their team play football.
A crowd of 63,196 attended the Melbourne Cricket Ground to see Jason Dunstall kick 10 goals and the Hawks win by one point. In a now-famous moment of defiance to both the league and his team&#x27;s board, Chris Langford (Hawthorn&#x27;s full-back), took off his Hawthorn jumper and proudly held it above his head while leaving the field. Prior to the game, an &quot;anti-merger&quot; rally, led by Scott, was held at Hawthorn&#x27;s then training ground, Glenferrie Oval.

Later in the round, Richmond lost to North Melbourne by a large margin. This loss ensured that Hawthorn were playing in the finals. The finals system at the time meant that Hawthorn, which finished in eighth position, had to play the team which finished first, Sydney Swans, in Sydney. Hawthorn would lose by 6 points and be knocked out in the first week of the 1996 finals, a week after the merger votes.

===Teams===


Hawthorn&#x27;s future four-time premiership coach Alastair Clarkson played for Melbourne that night, as did three of his assistant coaches: David Neitz, Todd Viney and Adem Yze.

==Vote==

Both the Hawthorn and Melbourne Football Clubs called extraordinary general meetings – Hawthorn held their meeting at the Camberwell Civic Centre, while Melbourne held its meeting at Dallas Brooks Hall. To the surprise of the respective clubs&#x27; boards, the meeting halls were filled, with more members and supporters of each team watching proceedings on large monitors outside. Entrepreneurial peddlers set up stalls selling merchandise along the long queues into the respective meeting halls.

The Hawthorn meeting was chaired by former premiership player and lawyer Richard Loveridge. 
The debates about the merger were passionate. When triple premiership coach Allan Jeans got up to speak on behalf of the merger the crowd shouted him down. Anti-merger coordinator Don Scott (in a now-famous moment) at one point holding up a mock-up of the Melbourne Hawks jumper, and proceeding to rip off a Velcro hawk and yellow V-neck to reveal a Melbourne jumper underneath. Prior to the commencement of the meetings, vocal anti-merger supporters chanted team songs and anti-merger slogans.

While Melbourne members (aided by a large bloc of proxy votes and the inability of all interested parties to get inside the hall to vote) voted 4,679 to 4,229 in favour of the merger, Hawthorn members overwhelming voted against it by a vote of 5,241 to 2,841 and the proposal was defeated. Large-scale resignations followed on both boards as those who had supported the merger fell on their swords; several prominent members of the anti-merger campaigns (including Dicker, Scott, Brereton, and Gutnick) would take senior executive or board positions at both clubs in the wake of the merger. The two sides continue to play in their original form to this day.

==Aftermath==
Before the failed merger of Melbourne and Hawthorn, on 4 July 1996, the Fitzroy and Brisbane clubs had been merged by the directive of the AFL commission to take effect as the Brisbane Lions on 1 November 1996. Footscray and North Melbourne also changed their names to the Western Bulldogs and the Kangaroos respectively to attract more fans, having both been considered for mergers in the last two decades.

Shortly after the season and the collapse of the Melbourne-Hawthorn merger, AFL CEO Ross Oakley, who had overseen the previous decade, stepped down and was replaced by Wayne Jackson. With the new CEO came a change in the league&#x27;s off-field direction, and in October 1996 the $6M incentive for Victorian clubs to merge was taken off the table. A new structure, which included stronger and earlier action against insolvent clubs, as well as restrictions on private ownership, was put forward. Nevertheless, decades later, merger and relocation talks among weaker Victorian clubs continue.

===Melbourne===

In the months following the 1996 merger vote, prominent businessman Joseph Gutnick became president of the Melbourne Football Club. He put $3 million of his own money into the club, which performed inconsistently onfield over the following few years, reaching and then missing the finals in alternating years between 1998 and 2004. Despite making the Grand Final in 2000 and making the finals in 2002, Gutnick was voted out by the members. The club generally struggled financially for 19 years afterwards, and had struggled to make finals on a consistent basis. However, in 2018 they played in the finals series for the first time since 2006.

In 2003, Melbourne plunged into a new crisis, winning only five games for the year and posting a $1 million loss. President Gabriel Szondy resigned and it seemed that Daniher&#x27;s tenure as coach was under threat. But, continuing the recent trend, in 2004, Melbourne climbed the ladder again, to finish seventh. They made finals again in 2005 and 2006, but 2007 was a poor season for Melbourne; Daniher resigned after the club recorded just two wins in its first thirteen games, and Melbourne finished 14th out of 16 clubs.

Off the field, the club remained in serious turmoil. In the first sign of troubles in February 2008, CEO Steve Harris resigned. Paul Gardner addressed the media in response to comments from the club&#x27;s auditors spelling disaster for the club. Gardner reiterated that the club had posted a $97,000 profit at the end of 2007. Despite celebrating the club&#x27;s birthday with an official mid-season function, shortly afterward chairman Paul Gardner resigned, handing the presidency to former club champion Jim Stynes, who inherited a $4.5 million debt.

Stynes wasted no time attempting to change the club&#x27;s direction and eliminate debt, introducing a drive called &quot;Debt Demolition&quot;, beginning with a call for members to sign up. A 5 August fundraiser raised $1.3 million, and the club raised well over $3 million in total. Despite the reduced debt, in November new club CEO Cameron Schwab declared that it required urgent AFL assistance to continue, requesting additional funding to its special annual distribution. The AFL committed $1 million to the club in 2009, with the MCC matching the AFL contribution. By the midpoint of the 2009 season, things had improved off field for Melbourne. They had secured a record number of members, remerged with the MCC, and knocked off more debt. On-field matters, however, worsened, and allegations of tanking in the latter part of the season tarnished the club.

Midway through the 2010 season, Melbourne chairman Jim Stynes announced that Melbourne had paid off all debts, which, along with a record club membership, secured Melbourne&#x27;s short-term future as a stand-alone club.

In 2021, Melbourne reached the Grand Final for the second time since the failed merger, where they ended their 57-year premiership drought with a defeat of the .

===Hawthorn===

Hawthorn has managed to grow in strength on and off the field since the merger. Membership jumped from 12,484 to 27,000 in 1997 and has continued to increase every year. One of the proposed advantages of merging was playing on the MCG, and Hawthorn moved its home games there in 2000 after the AFL closed Waverley Park. 

The Hawks moved from their home base at Glenferrie. They relocated to the old Waverley Park, which was being carved into lucrative real estate by Mirvac. Under the terms of the deal, the oval and immediate surrounds were to remain for sporting purposes. Mirvac needed a club to occupy the oval. Hawthorn paid $1 and, in return, received the freehold on the entire oval and a portion of what is now the administrative buildings.

The club began playing a few home games each year in Launceston in 2001, predominantly against the non-Victorian clubs, which earns it a hefty sponsorship from the Tasmanian government. In 2015, Hawthorn signed a five-year, $19 million deal with the Tasmanian State Government to continue to play four home and away games and a pre-season game in Launceston until the end of 2021; this agreement was later extended an additional year through 2022. The club now boasts one of the highest memberships among Victorian clubs, and was a dominant club on-field in the early 21st century with four premierships between 2008 and 2015.

<text>The Widnes Vikings are an English rugby league club in Widnes, Cheshire, which competes in the Betfred Championship. The club plays home matches at DCBL Stadium. Founded as Widnes Football Club, they are one of the original twenty-two rugby clubs that formed the Northern Rugby Football Union in 1895. Their historic nickname is &quot;The Chemics&quot; after the main industry in Widnes, but now they use their modern nickname, &quot;The Vikings&quot;.

The club enjoyed a period of success in the 1970s, 1980s, and early 1990s, and were frequently described as &quot;Cup Kings&quot; reaching the Challenge Cup Final 7 times in 10 years between 1975 and 1984. In 1989, after winning their third Rugby League Premiership, Widnes became the first official World Club Champions by beating the Australian champions Canberra Raiders 30–18 at Old Trafford. They have a strong local rivalry with Warrington Wolves. Widnes are the last team other than Wigan, St Helens, Leeds or Bradford to win the top division which occurred in 1989.

==History==
===Early years===

The Farnworth &amp; Appleton Cricket Club was formed in 1871 and four years later the members decided to embrace the burgeoning football code. At their fourth annual evening party in the Drill Hall, Widnes, in November 1875, club Chairman Henry Lea &quot;gave a short account of the club since it commenced about four years ago, and indicated that they had now started a football club in connexion (sic) with it, and hoped all would join&quot;. The first known game for the new Farnworth and Appleton FC was in Widnes in January 1876 played under rugby rules against Northwich Victoria. A few weeks later a return match was played at Drill Field, Northwich under soccer rules. Vics won both games. These are the only two known fixtures in that truncated first season.

By May 1876 the club had changed its name to Widnes FC and the cricket side of the organisation had disbanded, presumably to concentrate on football activities. By the late 1870s the club was being referred to as &quot;The Chemicals&quot;—subsequently shortened to &#x27;The Chemics&#x27;.

The first ground was on Albert Road behind what is now the Premier Wetherspoon&#x27;s pub and a short spell followed in the Simms Cross area. From around 1878–84 the club were based at the junction of Millfield/Peelhouse Lane, apart from season 1880–81 when they played on the Widnes Cricket Club ground at Lowerhouse Lane. From 1884–95 they rented a field at Lowerhouse Lane before moving to their third separate site on that road in October 1895. The first ever game at what later became Naughton Park was against Liversedge on Saturday 12 October 1895.

In 1895, Widnes were founder members of the Northern Union which broke away from the Rugby Football Union. Their first game was an away fixture against Runcorn which they lost 15–4. During the early years, the club often had to sell players to balance the books. The strength of junior rugby league in the area meant the club had a steady stream of new players to offset any losses.

In 1902, the Lancashire and Yorkshire leagues were combined to form a second division, Widnes was added to the first division.

In 1914, Arthur &#x27;Chick&#x27; Johnson was capped for the Lions (captained by Harold Wagstaff) in the famous Rorke&#x27;s Drift test, a match in which they overcame all the odds, and injuries to beat Australia with a depleted side of 10 against 13. He scored an extraordinary try to win the game, dribbling the ball from inside his own half. Widnes closed for the 1915–16 season but recommenced playing in 1916 following the introduction of conscription which meant that would not be accused of keeping men from volunteering for the First World War. Thirteen Widnes players were killed during the conflict.

The club&#x27;s first ever success came when they won the Lancashire League trophy in the 1919–20 season. However, the 1920s saw the club almost go to the wall. Local rivals Warrington donated their share of the traditional Easter and Christmas derby matches to keep Widnes afloat in 1927–28.

In 1930, Widnes with 12 local-born players defied the odds to beat St. Helens 10–3 to bring home the Challenge Cup.

The Kingsway housing scheme threatened the loss of Widnes&#x27; ground. After several years of fundraising during the Great Depression of the 1930s, £3,250 was raised to save the ground. This came with a stipulation that the ground could be sold only to the local council at the original price. The newly named Naughton Park was opened in 1932.

A major boost for the club was Widnes&#x27; first ever trip to the Challenge Cup final, staged at Wembley. Their opponents were St. Helens, Saints scored after six minutes to take a 3–0 lead, but Widnes hit back with a penalty try, a further try and a penalty to take a 10–3 half-time lead. A scoreless second half meant Widnes had won the cup.

Widnes became the first club to make two trips to Wembley, with a loss to Hunslet in the 1934 cup final.

In 1935–36, the team came close to being rugby league champions. Having finished third in the table, Widnes beat Liverpool 10–9 but lost to Hull FC, in the championship final. A third trip to Wembley came in 1937, with an 18–5 win over Keighley. The final was dubbed &quot;McCue&#x27;s Match&quot; as the halfback played an important part in the win.

Widnes dropped out of the wartime Lancashire league in 1940–41 and did not return to league competition until 1945–46.

===Post war===

Tommy McCue led the club to its first ever Lancashire Cup win, with a 7–3 victory against Wigan in 1945.

Back at Wembley in 1950, the team was beaten 19–0 by Warrington. During this period, the club reverted to selling its players to richer teams.

Local man Vince Karalius joined Widnes from St. Helens in 1962 and was appointed club captain. In his first season, Widnes finished third in the Championship, which equalled the club&#x27;s best league placing. In 1962, the league was split into East and West of the Pennines; Widnes and Workington Town met at Central Park, Wigan, in the first final of the Western Division Championship on Saturday 10 November 1962. With two minutes remaining, Lowdon dropped a goal to earn Workington a 9–9 draw. Later in the month Workington Town won the replay 10–0.

The following season saw him lead his team to Wembley, where Widnes were Rugby League Challenge Cup winners after they defeated Hull Kingston Rovers 13–5. No team had ever played more games in reaching Wembley than Widnes in 1964. In the first round, two replays were necessary before beating Leigh. Liverpool City were beaten in the second round, then Widnes played Swinton in front of 19,000 at Naughton Park. A 5–5 draw meant another replay, which was a scoreless draw at Station Road. A second replay at Wigan was watched by 21,369 with Widnes winning 15–3. The semi-final against Castleford was drawn 7–7. A crowd of 28,732 spectators watched the replay, which Widnes won. A Wembley crowd of 84,488 saw Widnes win the Challenge Cup for the third time with a 13–5 victory over Hull Kingston Rovers. This was the Chemics first trophy success in eighteen years.&quot;

===The &quot;Cup Kings&quot;===
The 1970s saw the first really outstanding Widnes team. A host of young local players developed into the &quot;Cup Kings&quot;, a golden age for the club. The first cup-final was a loss in the 1971–72 Lancashire Cup.

Six years after he retired from playing Vince Karalius returned to Widnes as coach; appointed in January 1972. The following two seasons, Widnes reached the finals of the BBC2 Floodlit Trophy. The first success came in the 1975 Lancashire Cup which Widnes won by beating Salford that season. They also won the 1975 Challenge Cup final 14–7 versus Warrington at Wembley. This was the first time in their history that Widnes had won two trophies in the same season. At his zenith, Karalius, stepped down once from his role as coach. He was replaced in May 1975 by Frank Myler.

Widnes visited Wembley in the following two seasons, losing to St. Helens and then Leeds. However, this was made up for by victories in the Lancashire Cup and John Player Trophy. The season after this (1977–78) saw their first league championship. The team went through the season unbeaten at home in the league. There were also trips to the John Player and Premiership finals.

Keith Elwell began his run of 242 consecutive appearances at Wembley in the 1976–77 Challenge Cup Final, including two as a substitute. He finished his run at Hull F.C. on 26 September 1982. This record for consecutive appearances for one club stands to this day.

Doug Laughton took over the job of team coach when Frank Myler retired from the position in 1978. The 1978–79 season saw no less than four cups come to Widnes—the BBC2 floodlit trophy, Lancashire Cup, Premiership and a win at Wembley over Wakefield Trinity in front of a crowd of 93,218. Widnes also defeated the Ashes-winning 1978 Kangaroo tourists.

The 1979–80 season saw Widnes beat Bradford Northern in the Premiership final, but come second to them in the league and John Player Trophy. The Lancashire Cup was won for the fifth time in the 1970s.

The 1980s started with a Wembley win over Hull Kingston Rovers in 1980–81. The season after this, Widnes again returned to Wembley, to face Hull F.C. Widnes led 14–6 with less than 20 minutes to go, but the game finished 14–14 and Hull won the replay 18–9 at Elland Road, Leeds. Widnes kept their record of winning a cup every season by defeating Hull 23–8 in the Premiership final. The next season saw Hull again beaten by Widnes in the Premiership final.

Vince Karalius returned to the club in March 1983 as co-coach with Harry Dawson. Dawson quit as coach in March 1984 with Karalius continuing as team manager. Karalius led a strong Widnes side to the finals of the Lancashire Cup and John Player Trophy and another Wembley victory appearance 19–6 against Wigan.

===The &quot;Greatest Team&quot;===
Doug Laughton returned to the club in January 1986 and began a series of signings of players from other league clubs and from rugby union. One such player was Martin Offiah, who in 1987–88 scored a club record 42 tries. The team went on to win the championship that season, clinching it with a 50-point win away over Hunslet. Widnes then beat St. Helens 38–14 in the Premiership Final at Old Trafford, Manchester a game in which Alan Tait made his début.

The 1988–89 season saw the club sign rugby union star Jonathan Davies from Llanelli for £225,000. Widnes and Wigan battled each other for the silverware. Widnes beat Wigan in the Charity Shield but lost to them in the Regal Trophy Final. The Championship came down to the last game of the season, a capacity crowd (officially 16,000) at Naughton Park saw Widnes beat Wigan 32–18 to win the title for the second year running. The Premiership was won again, with over 40,000 at Old Trafford to see Widnes beat Hull 18–10. Martin Offiah scored another 58 tries for Widnes, bringing up 100 tries for Widnes in just 76 games.

The 1989–90 season saw Widnes play at Anfield, Liverpool beating Wigan 27–22. Widnes beat St Esteve 60-6 to become European Club Champions to set up the first official World Club Challenge match against Australia&#x27;s Grand Final winners. Canberra took a 12–0 lead but were then swept aside as Widnes stormed home 30–18 to become the first official World Club Champions.

Widnes continued to be competitive winning the Lancashire Cup against Salford (1991) and the Regal Trophy against Leeds (1992). Widnes were also runners up in the League Championship and Premiership (1991) and the Challenge Cup (1993). After losing 3 Challenge Cup semifinals in 1987, 1989 and 1991, this belated trip to Wembley in 1993 came too late to avert financial problems. To balance the books, over 25 first team players were sold to other teams. This resulted in the club sinking to 12th in the division one table, avoiding relegation.

Tony Myler became coach of Widnes in May 1994. In August 1995 the club decided to bring back Doug Laughton for a third stint as team manager which resulted in Myler&#x27;s sacking as coach.

===Summer era===
In 1996, the first tier of British rugby league clubs played the inaugural Super League season and changed from a winter to a summer season. When the RFL announced that a new 12-team Super League was to be formed a chaotic period ensued in which the club was out, then in, then out, then in merged with local rivals Warrington and then finally out again as they finished below the cut-off point of 10th in the existing top flight.

The club adopted the name &quot;Widnes Vikings&quot; on 27 November 1996; the club had originally intended to adopt the moniker &#x27;Warriors&#x27; but were asked to reconsider by the RFL, as Whitehaven were planning to adopt this name also. Further player and coaching departures ensued and the club struggled in the new first division, the club&#x27;s first ever finish in the relegation zone followed. They spent the next five years in the Northern Ford Premiership.

Graeme West took over as coach after Doug Laughton&#x27;s third stint, his reign lasted from May 1997 until August 1998. During this time, the playing arena was rebuilt and the old stands, terraces and facilities were demolished to be replaced with a state-of-the-art all-seater stadium and was also renamed from Naughton Park to the Halton Community Stadium. West was later replaced as coach by Colin Whitfield.

In 1999 Widnes narrowly missed out on a place in the Northern Ford Premiership Grand Final. The 2000 season was one of transition with head coach Colin Whitfield being sacked and replaced by David Hulme. A record attendance for the newly rebuilt stadium was set at 6,644 for a Northern Ford Premiership game against Leigh on Boxing Day 2000. Widnes finished off a poor season in 8th place in the NFP.

Under new coach Neil Kelly, Widnes won promotion to Super League in 2001 after beating Oldham 24–12 in the Northern Ford Premiership Grand Final.

Their début season in the Super League was in 2002, and the Vikings surprised everyone by narrowly missing out on a play-off place, and finishing seventh.

The following season saw them consolidate with a 9th place finish, and in 2004 they avoided relegation on the final day of the season, with Castleford&#x27;s defeat by Wakefield Trinity saving Widnes&#x27; fate. Stuart Spruce was caretaker manager.

Frank Endacott arrived at Widnes as coach in 2005, but could not improve on the previous seasons. With two teams being relegated in 2005, due to the inclusion of Catalans Dragons in Superleague from 2006 onwards, Widnes were relegated back down to the second tier of the English game (LHF National League 1).

Widnes parted company with coach Frank Endacott, and new coach Steve McCormack rebuilt the squad, which notably included Australian full back David Peachey, who kept his word to join the club, despite its relegation.

Stephen Vaughan completed a take-over of Widnes in 2006 and the club made it to the LHF National League Grand Final, but were beaten 29–16 by Hull Kingston Rovers at Warrington&#x27;s Halliwell Jones Stadium.

Stephen Vaughan quit as chairman of Widnes at the start of 2007 and stepped down from the club&#x27;s board of directors, placing the club&#x27;s season into a &#x27;boom or bust&#x27; scenario. Widnes won the 2007 Northern Rail Cup Final with a 54–6 victory over Whitehaven at Bloomfield Road stadium and went on to reach the National League Grand Final at the end of the season. They were beaten 42–10 by Castleford at Headingley and in the days that followed, Widnes had no option but to place themselves into voluntary administration.

===New beginning===
On 2 November 2007, Widnes were purchased by Steve O&#x27;Connor, a local business man who had just sold his haulage firm to the Stobart Group. Steve McCormack was re-appointed as Head Coach, and the club were re-admitted into National League 1. A nine-point deduction for going into administration was successfully neutralised through winning their first three games, and Widnes qualified for the National League One Playoffs by finishing in sixth place. A 32–16 defeat by third-placed Halifax however brought the nostalgic 2008 campaign to an end.

Off the field, Widnes had applied for a Super League licence for the 2009 season along with 18 other clubs. However, the club was not granted a licence to play in the Super League, with the recent financial history of the club coming under close scrutiny.

In 2009 Widnes parted company with Steve McCormack and for a period John Stankevitch became caretaker manager. Paul Cullen was unveiled as McCormack&#x27;s eventual successor and managed the club to victory in the seasons Northern Rail Cup Final, beating a strong Barrow Raiders side 34–18.

In the following season, Widnes again reached the Northern Rail Cup Final but were beaten 25–24 by Batley Bulldogs. The club also reached the 2010 Co-operative Championship playoffs but were knocked out in the opening round by Barrow Raiders.

===Return to Super League===
In 2011 Widnes were granted a Super League licence for the 2012–14 seasons and Denis Betts was confirmed as the man who would coach the club. A flourish of new signings were announced and the pioneering &#x27;Viking Stronghold&#x27; initiative moved from strength to strength. Widnes also installed a fourth generation artificial pitch (or ipitch as it became known) during the off season, making them the first team in modern day rugby league to not play on a traditional grass pitch. Widnes&#x27; tenancy in the Co-operative Championship culminated in September 2011 with a fifth place league finish, and a first round playoff defeat of 36–20 against Sheffield at Bramall Lane.

February 2012 saw Widnes&#x27; re-emergence into the top tier of rugby league, and they claimed their first two points against Wigan in a 37–36 win. The club managed to prove a number of critics wrong by gaining 12 points in total by the end of their first season back, but this was not enough to prevent the club from finishing at the bottom of the Super League table.

The 2013 season saw a marked improvement on the field by Widnes, with the team earning a total of 22 league points and finishing 10th in the Super League table.

The 2014 season proved to be the most successful season of the franchise period, with the club finishing eighth in the Super League table on 27 points and subsequently qualifying for the end of season play-offs for the first time in their history. A 22–19 away defeat by the Warrington Wolves brought the curtain down on a season that can only be seen as a success for the Vikings, with a Challenge Cup Semi-Final appearance against the Castleford being the key highlight. However, it was also during the 2014 season that the club received the news that &quot;legendary supporter&quot; Pat Price had died and condolences for &#x27;the first lady of Rugby League&#x27; were received from clubs and supporters throughout the sport.

The RFL overhauled Super League for the 2015 season, scrapping the Franchise System and re-adopted promotion &amp; relegation. Widnes finished in 9th position on 19 points, and then went on to consolidate their Super League status in the Middle 8&#x27;s.

The 2016 season saw the Vikings put together a number of early exciting performances, including defeating the previous season&#x27;s champions Leeds 56–12. This placed Widnes top of the Super League table, heading into the Easter fixtures. Before the start of the 2017, Widnes sold their inspirational captain and best player to their bitter rivals Warrington. This move was completed whilst Brown was still in contract and despite warnings from fans, this proved the beginning of the end for Widnes as a potential mid table team.

In 2017, the team finished bottom but avoided relegation by beating the Catalans Dragons and the Million Pound Game.
The lack of ambition of the club was now available for everybody to see with Chairman Steven O’Connor washing his hands of the club and moving to Australia in order to pursue further business projects. This was done without O’Connor fulfilling his promise to the club and town that the club would not be entering Super League to “Make up the numbers”. The current board headed by James Rule failed to heed the mistakes of the 2017 season and further recruitment to the squad was extremely poor. This lack of ambition and value for money resulted in fans walking away from the club in their droves.

===Relegation and financial problems===
The 2018 season continued as the previous one with few quality signings and a team no longer good enough to compete in Super League. The club lost nineteen games in a row, which led to coach Denis Betts being dismissed with Francis Cummins taking interim charge; however, he could not prevent the club from falling into the Championship. On 1 February 2019, CEO James Rule resigned because the club faced significant financial challenges as a result of relegation. Speculation about the future of the club began to mount following a significant silence by the club&#x27;s then chairman, Steve O’Connor.

The club went into administration on 22 February 2019 after a take-over bid failed; as a result of this development the Rugby Football League imposed a 12-point penalty on the club and their upcoming game against Sheffield was postponed. Following a fundraising campaign called &quot;Vikings Quids In&quot;, supported by fans and other rugby league clubs, over £100,000 was raised. On 1 March 2019, the RFL accepted a takeover by a seven-strong consortium registered as Widnes Rugby League Club Limited, however the 12 point deduction remained in place leaving the club on minus 8 points. An investigation has begun to establish where large amounts of sponsorship and other funds have gone whilst the previous board were in charge. This may result in criminal proceedings against those responsible if any wrongdoing is
discovered.

===Vikings Resurgence===
In March 2019, the club narrowly escaped liquidation, thanks in large part to crowdfunding pages setup by the remaining Widnes Vikings fans. Newly appointed Head Coach Kieron Purtill began leading the club in a moderately successful streak of wins, culminating in reaching the finals of the 2019 RFL 1895 Cup against Sheffield Eagles. In the 2022 RFL Championship season, Widnes finished seventh on the table and missed the playoffs.

==Grounds==

The club&#x27;s home ground is Halton Stadium. The club had a number of grounds before settling at Lowerhouse Lane in 1895. The death of the club&#x27;s secretary, Tom Naughton in 1932, led to the ground on Lowerhouse Lane being renamed Naughton Park as a gesture of the team&#x27;s appreciation. Naughton Park became one of the best known Rugby League grounds in the country due to the success of the &#x27;Chemics&#x27; in the 1970s, and 1980s. In the 1990s Halton Council in partnership with the Widnes agreed to build a new stadium on the existing site, which would provide a multi-purpose complex including a social club, conference facilities, recreational facilities and catering/function facilities and would be the new home venue for Widnes RLFC. The new stadium was officially opened on 2 November 1997 following the completion of phase 1 of a multimillion-pound redevelopment and was renamed the Halton Community Stadium. On 29 January 1999 Halton Borough Council took over responsibility for the entire stadium, both financially and managerially. This was necessary as the joint venture companies arrangements were not performing as expected. The stadium reached completion with the opening of the East Stand in September 2005 and is an all-seater stadium which has a capacity of 13,500. It has also had the honour to have staged national finals and international fixtures. In August 2011, the stadium turf was removed and replaced with a third generation artificial pitch (or ipitch as it became known), in order to improve overall match performance and maximize the use of the club&#x27;s facilities. The stadium&#x27;s name has changed a number of times due to sponsorship purposes, with the latest name being the DCBL Stadium.

==Club jerseys==
* Since promotion to Super League in 2002

===Historic Jerseys===
Prior to the over-commercialization of the sport and the changing of kit design on a yearly basis, Widnes traditionally wore a black and white hooped jersey with white shorts. However, throughout their most dominant period of the 1970s, the club actually wore an all white jersey with 3/4 length sleeves and black shorts. It is quite common for fans to desire the club to return to one of these two jerseys. In addition, historically the club played in red when away from home.

<text>The telson () is the hindmost division of the body of an arthropod. Depending on the definition, the telson is either considered to be the final segment of the arthropod body, or an additional division that is not a true segment on account of not arising in the embryo from teloblast areas as other segments. It never carries any appendages, but a forked &quot;tail&quot; called the caudal furca may be present. The shape and composition of the telson differs between arthropod groups.

==Crustaceans==
In lobsters, shrimp and other decapods, the telson, along with the uropods, forms the tail fan. This is used as a paddle in the caridoid escape reaction (&quot;lobstering&quot;), whereby an alarmed animal rapidly flexes its tail, causing it to dart backwards. Krill can reach speeds of over 60 cm per second by this means. The trigger time to optical stimulus is, in spite of the low temperatures, only 55 milliseconds.

In the Isopoda and Tanaidacea (superorder Peracarida), the last abdominal body segment is fused with the telson, forming a &quot;pleotelson&quot;.

==Chelicerates==

The term &quot;telson&quot; is widely used for the caudal spine of some chelicerates. The chelicerate telson can be clearly seen in a number of fossil species (like in eurypterids) and in extant animals (like the horseshoe crab &quot;tail&quot; and the scorpion sting). Some authorities have urged that the usage of this word in this context be discouraged.

==Myriapods==

In millipedes, the telson consists of a legless pre-anal body segment (which may contain a posterior extension known as an &quot;epiproct&quot;), a pair of anal valves (&quot;paraprocts&quot;) or plates closing off the anus, and a plate below the anus (&quot;hypoproct&quot;), also known as a subanal scale.

In centipedes the telson is the hindmost body segment, posterior to the genital openings, bearing two anal valves.

==Hexapods==
Proturans, an order of minute soil-dwelling animals, are the only hexapods with a telson.

<doc id="1095061" wikidata="Q2031282" url="?curid=1095061" title="Second Battle of Newbury">
<text>The Second Battle of Newbury was a battle of the First English Civil War fought on 27 October 1644, in Speen, adjoining Newbury in Berkshire. The battle was fought close to the site of the First Battle of Newbury, which took place in late September the previous year.

The combined armies of Parliament inflicted a tactical defeat on the Royalists, but failed to gain any strategic advantage.

==Background==
In the early months of 1644, the Parliamentarians had won victories at Cheriton in the south of England and Nantwich in the northwest. Also, they had secured the allegiance of the Scottish Covenanters, who sent an army into the north east. These developments both distracted the Royalists and weakened their forces around Oxford, King Charles&#x27;s wartime capital.

Early in June, the Parliamentarian armies of the Earl of Essex and Sir William Waller threatened to surround Oxford. King Charles made a night march to escape to Worcester. He was still in danger but on 6 June, Essex and Waller (who disliked each other) conferred at Stow-on-the-Wold and fatally decided to divide their armies. While Waller continued to shadow the King, Essex marched into the West Country, to relieve Lyme which was under siege, and then to subdue Devon and Cornwall.

This allowed the King to double back and return to Oxford to collect reinforcements. On 29 June, he then won a victory over Waller at Cropredy Bridge. Waller&#x27;s army, most of which was unwilling to serve far from its home areas in London and the southeast, was subsequently crippled for several weeks by desertions and threatened mutinies. The King was thus free to march after Essex&#x27;s army.

Essex was soon trapped against the coast at Lostwithiel. He relied on support from the Parliamentarian navy, but contrary winds prevented the Parliamentarian ships leaving Portsmouth. Although Essex himself escaped in a fishing boat and his cavalry broke out of encirclement, the rest of his army was forced to surrender on 2 September, losing their arms and equipment. The troops were paroled, but suffered severely from exposure and attacks by country people during their march to Portsmouth. Although they were re-equipped, only 3,000 infantry (out of the 6,000 who started) were fit for service.

==Campaign==
After the victory at Lostwithiel, King Charles first probed the Parliamentarian defences at Plymouth then marched back across the southern counties of England to relieve several garrisons (including Banbury, Basing House and Donnington Castle, near Newbury), which had been isolated while he had been campaigning in the west. King Charles was joined briefly by Prince Rupert, who had been defeated at the Battle of Marston Moor in northern England on 2 July. The King ordered Rupert to march into Gloucestershire in an attempt to draw some of the Parliamentarian armies after him. However, the Parliamentarians did not send any units to follow Rupert, and his manoeuvre divided the Royalist forces, rather than those of Parliament.

By the time that King Charles arrived in Berkshire with his army, the Earl of Essex had assembled three Parliamentarian armies and positioned them to block any Royalist advance on London. By 19 October Waller was at Basingstoke where he was joined by the Earl of Manchester with the Eastern Association army the next day. The Earl of Essex also arrived at Basingstoke on 20 October with an army composed largely of elements of the cavalry and infantry that had survived the battle at Lostwithiel.

On 22 October, Charles relieved Donnington Castle. He knighted Lieutenant Colonel John Boys, the commander of its garrison, and promoted him to colonel. He hoped to relieve Basing House next, but the combined Parliamentarian armies were too strong for him to risk an advance. He therefore waited around Newbury for Rupert, and another detachment under the Earl of Northampton which had been sent to relieve Banbury, to rejoin him.

==Dispositions and plans==
Charles&#x27; army held three strong points: Donnington Castle north of Newbury, Shaw House northeast of the town and the village of Speen to the west. The River Kennet prevented the Parliamentarians making any outflanking move to the south, but the small River Lambourn divided the Royalists at Speen and Newbury from those at Shaw House and Donnington Castle.

Shaw House and its grounds including some Iron Age embankments incorporated into the defences, were defended by Lord Astley, with three &quot;tertias&quot; or brigades of infantry under his son, Sir Bernard Astley, Colonel Thomas Blagge and Colonel George Lisle. Speen was held by Rupert&#x27;s brother Prince Maurice, with a mixed detachment from the Royalist forces from the west country. Charles&#x27;s cavalry under George, Lord Goring were in reserve. They were divided into four brigades under Goring himself, Lord Wentworth, the Earl of Cleveland and Sir Humphrey Bennett. The Earl of Brentford was the Lord General, and Charles&#x27; deputy Lord Hopton commanded the artillery.

Early on 26 October, the combined Parliamentarian armies advanced to Clay Hill, a few miles east of Newbury, where they set up an artillery battery. Intermittent exchanges of cannon fire took place throughout the day. Essex had been taken ill, and Waller and Manchester decided that a frontal attack on Donnington Castle and Shaw House would be too costly. They opted instead to divide their forces. While Manchester demonstrated with 7,000 infantry against Shaw House, Waller took 12,000 men (including the infantry from the Earl of Essex&#x27;s army, a brigade of the London Trained Bands and most of the cavalry) on a long march of around the Royalist position to fall on Speen from the west. It was intended that on hearing the opening cannonade from Waller&#x27;s guns, Manchester would then put in a full-scale attack on Shaw House.

==Battle==

Waller set off late on 26 October and camped overnight far to the north. His force broke camp and resumed its outflanking move on 27 October while Manchester launched a diversionary attack on Shaw House. Although the Royalists at Donnington Castle observed Waller&#x27;s movement, and even sent a small detachment of cavalry to harry his rearguard, the troops at Speen were not warned of the danger. Waller&#x27;s force crossed to the south bank of the Lambourn at Boxford, and formed up and attacked at 3 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon, with cavalry under Oliver Cromwell on the left flank, infantry under Philip Skippon in the centre and cavalry under Sir William Balfour on the right.

Maurice&#x27;s forces had been dispersed to forage, and were caught unprepared. Although they repelled the first attack on Speen, the Parliamentarian infantry rallied and stormed the village, capturing several cannon (including some which the Royalists had captured at Lostwithiel). Balfour routed Maurice&#x27;s cavalry and also defeated the Earl of Cleveland&#x27;s brigade, but was then checked by the fresh Queen&#x27;s Regiment of horse and musketeers under Sir Thomas Blagge lining hedges east of Speen. Cromwell was uncharacteristically slow in coming into action and his wing was thrown back by a charge by Goring&#x27;s remaining cavalry under Goring himself.

The Earl of Manchester was slow to throw in his own attack, pleading that the noise of Waller&#x27;s guns had not been heard over the exchanges of artillery fire at Shaw House. Just before dark, he made a determined attack on Shaw House, but was beaten back.

Casualties in the day&#x27;s fighting were heavy, but roughly even on both sides.

==Aftermath==
The Royalists had held off the Parliamentarian forces but Charles knew his army was not up to another day&#x27;s fighting. He was outnumbered and with the loss of Speen, his forces were vulnerable to another attack the next morning. He hastily retreated to the north, leaving his wounded and most of his guns and baggage in Donnington Castle. Much of the Royalist army withdrew over a bridge over the River Lambourne which was an obvious line of retreat, but no Parliamentarian troops blocked their path, and the Royalists were free to withdraw.

The following day, the Parliamentarian commanders held a council of war at Speen. Cromwell, Balfour and Sir Arthur Hesilrige eventually were allowed to take cavalry in pursuit of the King&#x27;s army, but soon found that the Royalists had already crossed the River Thames at Wallingford and had reached the safety of the neighbourhood of Oxford. The Parliamentarians called off the pursuit and instead made a hasty attack on Donnington Castle. The attack was defeated with heavy casualties.

By 1 November, Charles had been reinforced by Rupert, Northampton and other forces to a strength of 15,000 men, and was able to relieve Donnington Castle again on 9 November. The Parliamentarians declined to contest the second relief of Donnington, and the Royalists found on 19 November that they had also raised the siege of Basing House. Charles thus ended the campaigning season with a notable success.

The Parliamentarian armies&#x27; unwieldy council of war was divided. When the King offered battle on 9 November, Manchester made his famous remark that &quot;The King need not care how oft he fights... If we fight 100 times and beat him 99 he will be King still, but if he beats us but once, or the last time, we shall be hanged, we shall lose our estates, and our posterities be undone.&quot; Cromwell, his lieutenant general, made the equally famous rejoinder, &quot;If this be so, why did we take up arms at first? This is against fighting ever hereafter. If so, let us make peace, be it never so base&quot;.

The dissatisfaction expressed by Cromwell and other Parliamentarians over the failure to trap Charles after the battle and the subsequent half-hearted operations, eventually resulted in the passing of the Self-denying Ordinance, which deprived Essex, Waller and Manchester of their commands, and the formation of the New Model Army, with which Parliament gained victory the next year.

Newbury was one of the few battles of the English Civil War in which an army attempted a wide outflanking move. Waller and Manchester took a risk in dividing their army, but were aware that they enjoyed superiority of numbers.

<doc id="1095072" wikidata="Q7359991" url="?curid=1095072" title="Roker">
<text>Roker ( ) is a seaside resort of Sunderland, city of Sunderland district, Tyne and Wear. England. It is north of the River Wear&#x27;s mouth and Monkwearmouth, west of the North Sea, east of Fulwell and Seaburn is south. It lies within historic County Durham.

The majority of the houses in Roker are terraced or semi-detached. Further west, to the part bordering Fulwell, are cul-de-sacs with semi-detached bungalows; these are owned mainly by members of Roker&#x27;s sizeable elderly population. On Roker Terrace, the area&#x27;s main street, there are exclusive apartments and hotels which overlook the seafront.

In addition to Seaburn seafront, the coast at Roker seafront played host to Sunderland International Airshow, the biggest free air show in Europe; this took place annually, usually over the last weekend in July. However, it has been cancelled indefinitely as Sunderland City Council says it wants to make the city carbon neutral. The popular event, which attracted hundreds of thousands of spectators to Roker, was last held in 2019, just before the COVID-19 pandemic.

== Toponymy ==
The name was first recorded as &quot;Roca&quot; in 1768. The exact origin of the name is unclear, but it may be a transferred name from Cabo da Roca in Sinatra, Portugal.

==History==

The story of Roker began in 1587, when the Abbs family were granted land on the north side of the River Wear on the condition that they provided six soldiers to defend the mouth of the river. Fast forward to 1840, when Roker Terrace was built upon the cliff tops, along with Monkwearmouth baths and Roker Park soon after. The pier and lower promenade were built six years later.

In 1898, Roker Park Stadium was built and Roker became known worldwide for being home to Sunderland A.F.C.. It was used for ninety-nine years until 1997, when the club moved nearby to the Stadium of Light.

In the early 20th century, Roker became a hugely popular resort for locals and tourists alike, and in 1928 it was taken over by the Borough of Sunderland, along with Fulwell and Seaburn.

In 1995, Roker Park Conservation Area was declared.

==Landmarks==
St Andrew&#x27;s Church, built 1905–07, is recognised as one of the finest churches of the first half of the twentieth century and the masterpiece of Edward Schroeder Prior.

One well-known landmark of sorts in Roker is the &quot;Bungalow Cafe&quot;, which is an old-fashioned café in a tiny bungalow on the upper promenade. Also famous is the signpost next to the café, marked: &quot;To Beach&quot; (pointing towards the beach), &quot;To Village&quot; (pointing into Roker), &quot;To Bungalow&quot; (pointing to the cafe) and &quot;To Germany&quot; (pointing out to sea).

A museum is located in the Roker Watch House, which was originally opened in 1906 as the headquarters of the Roker Volunteer Life Brigade. It is open every Sunday afternoon and on Bank Holiday Mondays.

Other nearby landmarks are the statue of Bede&#x27;s cross, on the cliff top near Roker Park, and St Peter&#x27;s Church, Monkwearmouth. The cross recognises the work of the Venerable Bede, who worked in the North-East all his life at the twin monasteries of Wearmouth and Jarrow. There is bid for the twin monasteries to gain World Heritage Site status.

===Lighthouses and pier===
From 1717, the newly formed River Wear Commission began to improve the harbour entrance at the mouth of the Wear. By 1750, a pair of breakwaters had been built, which survive in truncated form as the &#x27;Old&#x27; North and South Piers.

By the beginning of the next century, each had a lighthouse at its end. The lighthouse which stands today in Roker Cliff Park originally stood on the Old South Pier; it was deactivated in 1903 and removed eighty years later.

With the growth of Sunderland as a port, it was decided to improve the approach to the river by creating an outer harbour, protected by a new pair of new breakwaters curving out into the North Sea from the shore on each side. The new piers were the brainchild of Henry Hay Wake, who at the age of 25 had been appointed Chief Engineer to the River Wear Commission, in succession to Thomas Meik in 1868. The foundation stone for the New North Pier (Roker Pier) was laid on 14 September 1885. Applauded at the time as a triumph of engineering, the pier is built of granite-faced concrete blocks, which were loaded onto wagons at River Weir Works by a Goliath crane and unloaded and placed at the end of the pier by a Titan crane.

The opposite &quot;New South Pier&quot; was begun at around the same time, but never fully completed due to the start of the First World War; the twin lighthouse planned for its end was never built.

====Roker Pier Lighthouse====

The lighthouse at the pier head was completed in 1903. Its distinctive stripes are of naturally coloured red and white Aberdeen granite. When built, it was said to be Britain&#x27;s most powerful port lighthouse. Equipped with a third-order rotating catadioptric optic (consisting of a single-panel Fresnel lens backed by a prismatic mirror), it displayed a single flash every five seconds. The lighthouse had initially been lit by gas from the town mains, like its predecessors, but the supply to the end of the pier was found to be intermittent; as a result, the gas light was soon replaced by a Chance Brothers incandescent petroleum vapour mantle lamp. This increased the effective intensity of the light from 40,000 to 150,000 candle power, to give it a range of .

A fog siren was also provided, powered by compressed air from a pair of 7-horsepower gas engines located in the basement. It gave a two-second blast every twenty seconds in foggy weather from a sounder on the parapet, which was regulated by clockwork.

The light was semi-automated in 1936, when a new light system was installed by AGA. The main lamp was a 750-watt incandescent light bulb, with a gas mantle lamp (fed from the town supply) provided as a stand-by, activated by an automatic lamp changer; a small electric motor automatically wound the clockwork which rotated the lens.

Full automation followed in 1972, when the old optic was replaced by two back-to-back arrays of six sealed beam units mounted on an AGA gearless rotating pedestal, to give the light an increased range of ; a new fog horn was also provided at the same time. The system was supervised remotely from the Pilot House on the Old North Pier. Subsequent to its removal, the 1903 optic was added to the maritime collection of Sunderland Museum and Art Gallery.

In 2007, the lighting system was again replaced with a dual-drive Pelangi PRL400 rotating pedestal and lamp.

Roker Pier Lighthouse still functions today. Both pier and lighthouse have undergone significant refurbishment in recent years. In 2012, as part of the restoration, a new flashing LED lamp array was installed, replacing the small Pelangi unit previously in use. In 2018, following a comprehensive six-year process of refurbishment, the lighthouse was opened to the public for the first time; regular guided tours now take place, with access provided by way of the tunnel which runs the length of the pier.

== Transport ==
Roker is served by Tyne and Wear Metro&#x27;s Green line; Stadium of Light metro station facilitates regular services between Airport, Newcastle Central, Gateshead Interchange, and South Hylton. 

Bus services are operated primarily by Stagecoach North East and Go North East, with routes linking the area with Sunderland and South Shields.

==Demographics==
The population of Roker is approximately 4,600. Since the redevelopment of former brownfield areas of heavy industry into affluent riverside housing areas, and the founding of the St Peters Campus of the University of Sunderland to the immediate south of the area, Roker has undergone rapid demographic change. The first of these two changes brought a large influx of professional and managerial workers into the areas now known as St Peters Riverside and North Haven. The arrival of the university campus has seen a large number of the larger houses in the vicinity of Roker Avenue being converted into flats and student residences. The pursuant studentification has brought a substantial Chinese community into the area for the first time, along with a variety of other nationalities.

Along with the district of Monkwearmouth, Roker forms the St Peter&#x27;s electoral ward on Sunderland City Council, which is a division of the Sunderland Central parliamentary seat. St Peter&#x27;s was a safe Conservative ward in the 1980s, but became a battleground between the Conservatives and Labour in the 1990s and has remained as such ever since. Of the ward&#x27;s three council seats, all three are held by the Conservatives.

==Streetname traditions==
On the site of Sunderland AFC&#x27;s former stadium is a small housing estate; its street names are all references to the football club: Promotion Close, Clockstand Close, Goalmouth Close, Midfield Drive, Turnstile Mews and Roker Park Close.

The streets in between Roker Baths Road and Roker Avenue are all named after members of William Ewart Gladstone&#x27;s cabinet, including: Gladstone, Hartington, Forster, Bright and Stansfield.

<text>John T. Mills (November 12, 1817 – November 30, 1871) was an Irish-born American jurist who was an associate judge of the Third, Seventh and Eighth Judicial Districts of the Supreme Court of the Republic of Texas.

==Biography==

Born in County Antrim, Ireland, Mills immigrated to America with his parents as a child. His family settled in Beaufort County, South Carolina, where he studied law before moving to Clarksville, Republic of Texas, in 1837. From 1839 to 1845 he served three consecutive terms as an associate judge of the Supreme Court in the Third, Seventh, and Eighth Judicial Districts. After Texas was admitted to the Union, he served as a judge for the state in various district courts from 1846 to 1850. In 1849, he ran on the Democratic ticket for governor, but was not elected.

Mills&#x27; first marriage, to Mary Jane Vining, lasted from 1843 until her death in 1854; he married a Mrs. Adair and moved to Marshall shortly thereafter. His second marriage produced a son. John Mills died in Marshall, Texas, and is buried in the Marshall Cemetery there. Mills County, Texas, is named in his honor.

<doc id="1095076" wikidata="Q535981" url="?curid=1095076" title="Peace, order, and good government">
<text>In many Commonwealth jurisdictions, the phrase &quot;peace, order, and good government&quot; (POGG) is an expression used in law to express the legitimate objects of legislative powers conferred by statute. The phrase appears in many Imperial Acts of Parliament and Letters Patent, most notably the constitutions of Barbados, several of the British Overseas Territories, Canada, Australia and formerly New Zealand and South Africa.

== Background ==
Legal documents often contain a residual clause which expresses which entity will have authority over jurisdictions that have not otherwise been delineated or are in dispute. While specific authorities are often enumerated in legal documents as well, the designation of a residual power helps provide direction to future decision-makers and in emerging issue areas.

At its origin, the preferred phrase was &quot;peace, &quot;welfare&quot; and good government,&quot; but this eventually evolved into &quot;peace, &quot;order&quot; and good government,&quot; which soon became part of the standard phraseology used in British colonies to denote the residual power of the government. Although this phrase is used in the constitutional documents of several commonwealth countries, it has taken on a particular importance in the Canadian constitution due to repeated disputes about the nature of residual federal power in Canada.

It is often contrasted with &quot;life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness&quot;, a spiritually analogous phrase found in the US Declaration of Independence. While in British colonial India&#x27;s Constitution of 1935, the reference was used: &quot;Peace or Tranquility&quot;.

== Canada ==
In Canada, &quot;peace, order and good government&quot; (in French, &quot;paix, ordre et bon gouvernement&quot;) is sometimes abbreviated as POGG and is often used to describe the principles upon which that country&#x27;s Confederation took place.

A similar phrase, &quot;peace, welfare, and good government&quot;, had been used the Act of Union 1840 that created the Province of Canada. The now familiar phrase &quot;peace, order and good government&quot; was originally used in the British North America Act, 1867 (now known as the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;) enacted by the Imperial Parliament, and it defines the principles under which the Parliament of Canada should legislate. Specifically, the phrase appears in section 91 of the federal Act, which is part of the block of sections that divide legislative powers between the federal and provincial levels of government.

POGG is a head of power arising from opening words of section 91 and is distinct from the enumerated powers under that section. The broad language suggests to some although not to others that there is a comprehensive grant of residual legislative authority to the federal government. Although the residual nature of the clause remains, the scope of the clause has been limited by the jurisprudence of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC). The JCPC narrowed the scope of the clause to the three distinct branches which remain while also broadly interpreting the scope of provincial authority over property and civil rights under section 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The jurisprudence has been defined into three branches: Emergency Branch, Gap or Purely Residual Branch, and National Concern Branch, as defined in the Supreme Court of Canada judgment .

=== Interpretation doctrines ===
Although the text of the act gives Parliament residuary powers to enact laws in any area that has not been allocated to the provincial governments, subsequent jurisprudence has limited the scope of the &quot;peace, order, and good government&quot; power. The limitation on the scope of this clause stems from the narrow interpretation of its branches and the expansive interpretation of provincial powers under section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Particularly limiting is the breadth of provincial power over property and civil rights under s. 92(13). Although the Emergency Branch and the National Concern Branch may be viewed as delimited federal competencies like the enumerated clauses under section 91 (see e.g. &quot;AG Canada v AG Ontario (Labour Conventions)&quot;, [1937] AC 326 (PC)), the clause remains residuary.

The powers under POGG must be interpreted in light of the subsequent jurisprudence on the limitations of the clause and the expansive powers of the provinces under their enumerated heads of power. If a matter does not fall within one of the enumerated classes in section 92, section 91, or the emergency or national concern branches, then it falls within the narrowly defined residual branch of POGG. The POGG power is best understood as a narrowly defined residual power limited to the following three branches.

==== The Gap or Purely Residual Branch ====
POGG&#x27;s gap-filling power covers issues such as drafting oversights and matters not within the boundaries of a province. Drafting oversights include things the drafters of the Constitution forgot to think about but would unambiguously have allocated to Parliament if they had. For instance, section 92 allocates responsibility for provincially incorporated companies to the legislatures but section 91 says nothing about federally incorporated companies: the gap branch allocates this jurisdiction to Parliament, per &quot;John Deere Plow Co v Wharton&quot;, 1915. Matters not within the boundaries of a particular province include Canadian territorial lands and waters that are within provincial boundaries such as the seabed off the coast of Newfoundland, per &quot;Reference Re Seabed and Subsoil of Continental Shelf Offshore Newfoundland&quot;, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 86.

The gap branch is rarely relied on because there is so little left to default to the federal government after taking into account the enumerated provincial power over property and civil rights under section 92(13) which applies to any transaction, person or activity that is found within the province. Historically new subject matters, such as aeronautics, do not necessarily fall residually to the federal government, per &quot;Johannesson v West St Paul (Rural Municipality of)&quot;, 1952.

==== The Emergency Branch ====
Parliament may invoke emergency powers under the emergency branch of POGG. This began in 1882, when the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (then the supreme authority over Canadian law) ruled in &quot;Russell v. The Queen&quot; that the federal government could legislate with regard to alcohol, because even though this would probably have been considered provincial jurisdiction in ordinary circumstances, the federal government was acting to ensure order in Canada. This concept further evolved during the 1920s, when in the 1922 Board of Commerce case, it was stated that POGG could be invoked in times of war and famine, to allow Parliament to intervene in matters of provincial jurisdiction. POGG was later used this way in the &quot;Anti-Inflation Reference&quot; of 1976, when the Supreme Court of Canada allowed Parliament to regulate inflation on the grounds that it posed a considerable economic problem for Canada. In that case, a great degree of deference was exercised in accepting what the federal government deemed to be an emergency.

==== The National Concern Branch ====
The &quot;national concern&quot; doctrine (sometimes referred to as &quot;national dimensions&quot;) was an alternate means of applying the POGG powers that found use in the mid-20th century. It allowed Parliament to legislate on matters that would normally fall to the provincial government when the issue became of such importance that it concerned the entire country.

The doctrine originated from a statement by Lord Watson in the Local Prohibition case (1896), wherein he stated:
:&quot;Their Lordships do not doubt that some matters, in their origin local and provincial, might attain such dimensions as to affect the body politic of the Dominion, and to justify the Canadian Parliament in passing laws for their regulation or abolition in the interest of the Dominion.&quot;
After this case the doctrine was completely ignored until 1946 when Viscount Simons brought it back in the case of &quot;Ontario v. Canada Temperance Foundation&quot;, [1946] A.C. 193 (P.C.). The test as stated in &quot;Temperance Foundation&quot; was whether the matter &quot;goes beyond local or provincial concern or interests and must from its inherent nature be the concern of the Dominion as a whole&quot;.

==== Current approach towards interpretation ====
The above branches of the power are currently governed by the principles stated by Le Dain J. in &quot;R. v. Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd.&quot;:

=== Sociological value ===
Despite its technical purpose, the phrase &quot;peace, order and good government&quot; has also become meaningful to Canadians. This tripartite motto is sometimes said to define Canadian values in a way comparable to “liberté, égalité, fraternité” (liberty, equality, fraternity) in France or “life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness” in the United States.

It has been used by some scholars to make broad characterizations of Canada&#x27;s political culture. US sociologist Seymour Martin Lipset, for example, contrasted POGG with the American tripartite motto to conclude Canadians generally believe in a higher degree of deference to the law. As Canadian historian Donald Creighton argued in his report to the Royal Commission on Dominion-Provincial Relations, the expression was used interchangeably in the 19th century by Canadian and Imperial officials with the expression &quot;peace, welfare and good government&quot;. The term &quot;welfare&quot; referred not to its more narrow modern echoes, but to the protection of the common wealth, the general public good. &quot;Good government&quot; referred to good public administration, on the one hand, but also had echoes of what we now talk of as good governance, which incorporates the notion of appropriate self-governance by civil society actors, since one element of good government was thought to be its limitation to its appropriate sphere of responsibility.

== Elsewhere in the Commonwealth ==
The phrase &quot;peace, order and good government&quot; appears in many 19th and 20th century British Acts of Parliament, such as the New Zealand Constitution Act 1852, the Colonial Laws Validity Act 1865, the British Settlements Act 1887, the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, the South Africa Act 1909, Hong Kong Letters Patent 1917, and the West Indies Act 1962 and the Government of Ireland Act 1920. In the Constitution of Malta, the phrase is followed by the qualifier &quot;in conformity with full respect for human rights, generally accepted principles of international law and Malta’s international and regional obligations in particular those assumed by the treaty of accession to the European Union&quot;.

In &quot;Ibrelebbe v. The Queen&quot; [1964] AC 900, 923, the words &quot;peace, order and good government&quot; contained in the Ceylon Constitution Order-in-Council (1946) were said by the Privy Council to: &quot;connote, in British constitutional language, the widest law-making powers appropriate to a sovereign&quot;. Likewise in Australia, the High Court found in &quot;Union Steamship v King&quot; [1988] HCA 55 that the grant of power to legislate &#x27;for peace, order/welfare and good government&#x27; was a plenary power to legislate within/for the territory.

However, in New Zealand, those powers are not considered as unlimited. In &quot;The Trustees Executors and Agency Co. Ltd v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation&quot; (1933) 49 CLR 220, Justice Evatt of the High Court of Australia wrote a separate judgement analyzing the power to make laws for the &quot;peace, order and good government of New Zealand&quot; under the New Zealand Constitution. Evatt held that laws dealing only with circumstances, persons or things outside of New Zealand, while not &quot;prima facie&quot; invalid could, in some cases, fail to satisfy the description of being for the peace, order and good government &quot;of New Zealand&quot;. A law that failed to satisfy that description would be beyond legislative power and invalid, but Evatt J noted that cases of this kind would be &quot;very rare&quot;.

In &quot;R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex p Bancoult (No 1)&quot; [2000] EWHC 413, the High Court of England and Wales struck down an ordinance made in 1971 by the Commissioner of the British Indian Ocean Territory expelling the entire population of the Chagos Archipelago to make way for an American military base at Diego Garcia, purportedly under his power to legislate for the &quot;peace, order and good government&quot; of the territory. Lord Justice Laws, ordering the British government to allow the inhabitants to return to their former homes, condemned the depopulation of the islands in the name of &quot;peace, order and good government&quot; with the words:

It was Tacitus who said: &quot;They make a desert and call it peace – (Agricola 30). He meant it as an irony; but here, it was an abject legal failure.&quot;
Despite this, in 2008 the House of Lords in &quot;R v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Bancoult (No 2)&quot; held that the plenary power exists to the extent that even legislation removing all inhabitants from a territory is valid; this was later confirmed in the 2016 UK Supreme Court case &quot;R (on the application of Bancoult (No 2)) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs&quot;.

<doc id="1095078" wikidata="Q2412728" url="?curid=1095078" title="The March of Time">
<text>The March of Time is an American newsreel series sponsored by Time Inc. and shown in movie theaters from 1935 to 1951. It was based on a radio news series broadcast from 1931 to 1945 that was produced by advertising agency Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn (BBDO). The &quot;voice&quot; of both series was Westbrook Van Voorhis. Produced and written by Louis de Rochemont and his brother Richard de Rochemont, &quot;The March of Time&quot; was recognized with an Academy Honorary Award in 1937.

&quot;The March of Time&quot; organization also produced four feature films for theatrical release, and created documentary series for early television. Its first TV series, &quot;Crusade in Europe&quot; (1949), received a Peabody Award and one of the first Emmy Awards.

==Production==
&quot;The March of Time&quot; was based on a news documentary and dramatization series, also called &quot;The March of Time&quot;, that was first broadcast on CBS Radio in 1931. Produced by Madison Avenue advertising agency, Batten, Barton, Durstine &amp; Osborn (BBDO), the series was designed to cross promote Time magazine on the radio. Usually called a newsreel series, &quot;The March of Time&quot; was actually a monthly series of short feature films twice the length of standard newsreels. The films were didactic, with a subjective point of view. The editors of &quot;Time&quot; described it as &quot;pictorial journalism&quot;. Like its radio namesake, &quot;The March of Time&quot; included reporting, on-location shots, and dramatic reenactments. &quot;The March of Time&quot;&#x27;s relationship to the newsreel was compared to the weekly interpretive news magazine&#x27;s relationship to the daily newspaper.

&quot;The March of Time&quot; was launched February 1, 1935, in over 500 theaters. Each entry in the series was either a two- or three-reel film (20 or 30 minutes). Westbrook Van Voorhis, who hosted the radio program, served as narrator of the film series. The series, which finally totalled close to 200 segments, was an immediate success with audiences. Because of its high production costs—estimated at $50,000 per episode, released at the rate of about one episode per month—the series was a money loser. However, it remained in production for six years beyond the cancellation of the radio show on which it was based.

The films were originally distributed by First Division Pictures, an independent distributor of minor-studio product. Major studio RKO Radio Pictures took over distribution in August 1935, and 20th Century-Fox began releasing the series in September 1942. At its peak &quot;The March of Time&quot; was seen by 25 million U.S. moviegoers a month.

&quot;Implicit in all &quot;March of Time&quot; issues was a kind of uncomplicated American liberalism — general good intentions, a healthy journalistic skepticism, faith in enlightened self-interest, and substantial pride in American progress and potential&quot;, wrote &quot;March of Time&quot; chronicler Raymond Fielding:

The men who made the &quot;March of Time&quot; were not political theorists, they were journalists. For them, fascism, communism, and native demagogues seemed foreign to the American ethic, and they exposed and attacked them accordingly. … A cinematic &quot;agent provocateur&quot;, the &quot;March of Time&quot; turned over a lot of rocks, both at home and abroad, and illuminated the creatures it found beneath them. The demagogues and quacks whom they attacked in the 1930s may seem like obvious targets now, but they didn&#x27;t seem so then. They were popular, powerful, frightening people, and the &quot;March of Time&quot; stood entirely alone in theatrical motion picture circles as a muckraker.

In late 1936, producer Roy E. Larsen reluctantly left &quot;The March of Time&quot; to serve as publisher of &quot;Life&quot;, a weekly news magazine that began publication in November 1936. &quot;Time&quot; executives had long vacillated over launching such a magazine, but the success of &quot;The March of Time&quot;&#x27;s experiments in pictorial journalism overcame the hesitation of the corporation&#x27;s board of directors. Larsen proposed that the new magazine be named &quot;The March of Time&quot;, but the name &quot;Life&quot; was purchased from the owners of a declining periodical. &quot;Life&quot; magazine was a great success and notable influence on photojournalism throughout its 36-year history.

Louis de Rochemont succeeded Larsen as producer of &quot;The March of Time&quot;, while Larsen continued to supervise the operations of the series on behalf of the &quot;Time&quot; corporation.

Examining the subjects of &quot;The March of Time&quot;, series historian Raymond Fielding found that episodes dealing with a single country and its affairs comprised 32.6 to 36 percent of the entire series. Economic issues were the subject of 10 percent of the episodes, and domestic politics 5 percent. Between 1935 and 1942, approximately 24 percent of the episodes were about war or the threat of war; from December 1941 until the end of World War II nearly every episode dealt with war.

&quot;Although the &quot;March of Time&quot; was professedly nonpartisan, a clear and persistent antifascist tone was becoming apparent in its analysis of world politics and rising militarism&quot;, Fielding wrote. &quot;&#x27;Rehearsal for War&#x27; [August 6, 1937] was unquestionably anti-Franco, which was exactly what liberal staff members had intended.&quot;

During Louis de Rochemont&#x27;s tenure (1935–1943), 14 percent of the &quot;March of Time&quot; episodes were about the impact of specific individuals on political, economic and military events — a number that dropped significantly after his departure. De Rochemont&#x27;s particular interest in the geopolitical role of the world&#x27;s waterways resulted in 7.5 percent of all episodes devoted to the subject.

&quot;The March of Time&quot; film series ended in 1951, when the widespread adoption of television and daily TV news shows made the newsreel format obsolete. Newsreel series such as &quot;Pathé News&quot; (1910–1956), &quot;Paramount News&quot; (1927–1957), &quot;Fox Movietone News&quot; (1928–1963), &quot;Hearst Metrotone News/News of the Day&quot; (1914–1967), and &quot;Universal Newsreel&quot; (1929–1967) continued for a while longer.

==Episodes==
Unless noted, sources for episode information are &quot;The March of Time, 1935–1951&quot; by Raymond Fielding, and the HBO Archive&#x27;s summary of &quot;The March of Time&quot; newsreels. Episodes 1.1–1.4 were distributed by First Division Pictures; episodes 1.5–8.13 were distributed by RKO Pictures; episodes 9.1–17.6 were distributed by 20th Century-Fox.

==Reviews and commentary==
*Writing for &quot;The Spectator&quot; in 1935, Graham Greene favorably contrasted the film with contemporary British news films whose stories he described as &quot;scraps of unimportant material [...] flung without arrangement on to the screen&quot;. Praising the producers of &quot;The March of Time&quot;, Greene suggested that &quot;their fortnightly programmes can be compared with an authoritative article by a special correspondent rather than with a haphazard page of photographs from the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;&quot;, and went on to discuss the danger of censorship for this nascent news medium in light of England&#x27;s stronger libel laws and the British Board of Film Censors&#x27; decision to severely cut scenes of the Parisian riots related to the Croix de Feu, and to remove the film&#x27;s final scene revealing the source of the Croix de Feu&#x27;s funding - an act of censorship that Greene noted as making the film &quot;Fascist in tone&quot;.
* Alistair Cooke, &quot;The Listener&quot; (November 20, 1935) — &quot;The March of Time&quot; is not the result of bright inspiration. Behind it is ten years&#x27; experience with a magazine of the same style; an army of correspondents and cameramen scattered throughout the world; an historical film library it took two years to prepare; a newspaper cutting library as exhaustive as anything extant; and in New York and Chicago a vast research staff alert to trace the origins of any family, war, author, statesman, treaty, or breath or rumour. With no less than this should any other film company irresponsibly compete.
* Bosley Crowther, &quot;The New York Times&quot; (October 31, 1937) — And now, less than three years old but already an institution, the March of Time is today one of the most successful and forward-looking features on the screen — a dynamic force for the purveyance of information through the medium of the film.
* D. A. Spencer and H. D. Waley, &quot;The Cinema Today&quot; (1939) — Although the ideal behind these films is to present, as objectively as possible, accounts of world happenings, there is no doubt whatever that they are helping to mould our views on such happenings. In America legislation regulating child labour … has at last passed both Houses of Congress by a narrow margin which is believed to be due to the &quot;March of Time&quot;. Their film on cancer has done a good deal to arouse the national conscience of America to the evils of the quackery that battens on fear of this scourge, while in England, before the present campaign for National Fitness was under way, their film &quot;Food and Physical Training&quot; aroused enormous interest and debate in that it brought home to many people&#x27;s minds the fact that the animals at the zoo are better fed and housed than many of the nation&#x27;s children.
* Neil Genzlinger, &quot;The New York Times&quot; (September 2, 2010) — It&#x27;s hard to know today even what to call these films. (Raymond Fielding, a retired college educator who wrote a book about the series, told me that roughly 290 were made.) &#x27;&quot;Newsreels&#x27;&quot; seems inadequate; they are longer, more detailed and much more opinionated than the standard-issue newsreels that preceded them. &quot;Documentaries&quot; is closer, but the blaring orchestrations and outlandish voice-overs sound nothing like a modern documentary. It&#x27;s tempting to give up and label these whats-its a mass-media Neanderthal — an evolutionary dead end; an attempt to merge the tools of newsgathering and filmmaking that had its moment but died out. Except that, once you watch a few and learn about how they were made, you start to see a little &quot;March of Time&quot; in almost everything: Fox News, &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;, the History channel, schlocky reality shows of the &quot;I Shouldn&#x27;t Be Alive&quot; variety, PBS&#x27;s &quot;P.O.V.&quot;
* Tom Shales, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; (September 4, 2010) — Fascinating, enthralling, enlightening—many a superlative applies to these documentary shorts, which have gathered value with the march of time itself and have been rescued from the ravages of time by New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art and the HBO Archive, corporate relative of the series&#x27;s original creators. … It&#x27;s something of an irony that &quot;The March of Time&quot; may be less famous today than a bull&#x27;s-eye parody of it — a parody that millions have seen, many of them perhaps not even knowing that it is a parody or what it&#x27;s lampooning. Does &quot;News on the March&quot; ring a bell? It&#x27;s the title of the fake-out newsreel that begins the Orson Welles classic &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, and it includes wily duplications of all the &quot;March of Time&quot; trademarks, including the white-on-black transitional title cards, the wall-to-wall musical score and the bombastic narration.

==Awards and recognition==
* &quot;The March of Time&quot; received an honorary Academy Award in 1937 &quot;for its significance to motion pictures and for having revolutionized one of the most important branches of the industry — the newsreel.&quot;
* On October 27, 1937, &quot;The March of Time&quot; episode &quot;Conquering Cancer&quot; received the first Clement Cleveland Medal, established by the New York City Cancer Committee of the American Society for the Control of Cancer. &quot;Louis de Rochemont was especially proud of a letter he received from U.S. Surgeon General Parran crediting the film with providing a crucial influence in securing a federal appropriation for the National Cancer Institute&quot;, reported &quot;March of Time&quot; chronicler Raymond Fielding.
* &quot;The March of Time&quot; episode &quot;Norway in Revolt&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) in 1941.
* &quot;Prelude to Victory&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) in 1942.
* &quot;Youth in Crisis&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) in 1943.
* &quot;Atomic Power&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) in 1946.
* &quot;A Chance to Live&quot; received the Academy Award for Best Documentary (Short Subject) in 1949.
* &quot;Inside Nazi Germany&quot;, a 1938 &quot;March of Time&quot; episode directed by Jack Glenn, was an inductee of the 1993 National Film Registry list in 1993.

==Feature films==
Four feature-length films were produced by &quot;The March of Time&quot;.
* &quot;The Ramparts We Watch&quot; (August 1940, 99 minutes)
* &quot;The Story of the Vatican&quot; (August 1941, 53 minutes)
* &quot;We Are the Marines&quot; (December 1942, 70 minutes)
* &quot;The Golden Twenties&quot; (April 1950, 67 minutes)

==Television==
In 1949 &quot;The March of Time&quot; created the first extensive documentary series for television, &quot;Crusade in Europe&quot;, based on the book by Dwight D. Eisenhower. The ABC series received a Peabody Award and one of the first Emmy Awards (Best Public Service, Cultural or Educational Program). It was followed by &quot;Crusade in the Pacific&quot; (1951).

In 1965–1966, producer David L. Wolper revived the &quot;March of Time&quot; title for a series of documentary films produced in association with Time-Life, Inc. The series was not successful.

==Cultural references==
Dorothy Fields&#x27; lyrics for the song &quot;A Fine Romance&quot;, introduced by Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers in the 1936 RKO film &quot;Swing Time&quot;, include a reference to the newsreel series:

A fine romance, with no kisses.&lt;br&gt;A fine romance, my friend, this is.&lt;br&gt;True love should have the thrills that a healthy crime has.&lt;br&gt;We don&#x27;t have half the thrills that &quot;The March of Time&quot; has.

The March of Dimes, a fundraising organization that still exists, was named by Eddie Cantor in 1938 as a play on &quot;The March of Time&quot;. Because Franklin D. Roosevelt founded the March of Dimes, originally called the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, a dime was chosen to honor him after his death.

&quot;The March of Time&quot; series was satirized in Orson Welles&#x27;s film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; (1941) with the &quot;News on the March&quot; segment showing the life and funeral of the fictional Charles Foster Kane.

The Canadian documentary series &quot;The World in Action&quot; (1942–1945) was patterned after &quot;The March of Time&quot; newsreel series.

<text>Sachkhere () is a town at the northern edge of the Imereti Province in Western Georgia. It is the center of the Sachkhere Municipality.

Farming is a major contributor to the economy of Sachkhere. Alva LLC estimates that there are 4,000 small and medium-sized farms and ranches in the region, supported by a program of technical assistance sponsored by USAID and administered by the Farmer-to-Farmer program of CNFA.

== History ==
From the end of the 15th century, much land in the region was owned by the noble Tsereteli family.

By the 19th century, Sachkhere had become a very diverse settlement with a sizable community of Georgian Jews. According to official statistics published by the administration of the viceroy, in 1880 the total population of 1,034 people was composed of the following religious groups: 628 Georgian Jews, 206 Orthodox Christians (presumably mostly Georgians), and 200 Gregorian Armenians.

Some Georgian Jews had moved to Sachkhere from the city of Kutaisi. Prior to the end of serfdom implemented in Kutaisi Governorate from 1865 as part of the Russian Empire&#x27;s Emancipation reform (1861), many Sachkhere Jews had been serfs on the lands of the Tsereteli family.

In 1878, 9 Georgian Jews were arrested in Sachkhere for the alleged killing of a Christian girl from the neighbouring village of Perevisa in Shorapani uezd. A classic case of blood libel, they were falsely accused of abducting the girl and extracting her blood for purportedly Jewish religious rituals. In March 1879, the case was heard at the Kutaisi Circuit Court, which had been established in early 1868 as one of several new courts in the South Caucasus created by Tsar Alexander II.&#x27;s Judicial Reform. During the trial, the defence lawyers Petr Aleksandrov, Lev Kupernik and Moisei Kikodze convinced the judges that the accusations against the Jewish men were mostly based on false testimony. All of the accused were acquitted. The previous year Aleksandrov had already defended the Russian revolutionary Vera Zasulich at a highly publicised jury trial in St Petersburg, which had also resulted in an acquittal.

== Science ==
The microbiologist George Eliava (1892–1937) was born in Sachkhere.

==Sport==
Though small, Sachkhere is famous for having produced two Olympic weightlifting champions - Lasha Talakhadze and Giorgi Asanidze.
