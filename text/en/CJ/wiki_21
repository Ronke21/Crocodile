<text>Vincent Tan Chee Yioun (; born 23 February 1952) is a Malaysian business magnate, investor and philanthropist who is a founder and chairperson of Berjaya Corporation, a diversified conglomerate listed on the Malaysian stock exchange. Besides holding stakes through the Berjaya Corporation group of companies, Tan&#x27;s other stakes include interest in internet–related businesses, water utilities, media, retail and telecommunications.

In 2010, he entered the &quot;Forbes&quot; billionaire list, with an estimated worth of USD 1.6 billion (RM4.2 billion). Tan&#x27;s success in the Malaysian business sector has been attributed in part to his close association with prominent Malay political figures. As of April 2024, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth at $730 million, making him the 29th richest person in Malaysia.

==Early life==
Tan was born in Batu Pahat in 1952, and studied at Batu Pahat High School.
Tan had originally planned to study law in New Zealand, but as his father&#x27;s business was failing, he found work as a clerk in a bank instead. He then sold life insurance for AIA and became an agency manager at AIA by the age of 23.

Tan then started private companies in trading, credit, general insurance and real estate. He started a joint venture with Tokio Marine &amp; Fire Insurance that became United Prime Insurance. In 1981, he won a McDonald&#x27;s franchise in Malaysia, took an advance operations course at Hamburger University, and became the managing director of McDonald&#x27;s Malaysia in 1982.

==Business==
=== Berjaya Corporation ===

In 1984, Tan moved into Berjaya, which purchased 48% of the consumer durables company Regnis the same year. Tan had association with the then finance minister Daim Zainuddin. In 1985, Tan bought 51% of Sports Toto from the Malaysian government. Pre-tax profit of Sports Toto rose from RM 5 million in 1985 to RM 36 by April 1989. He injected his shares in Sports Toto into Berjaya to gain control of Berjaya. In 1988, he swapped his shares in Berjaya for Raleigh Bhd, a lost-making company linked to Daim, which was then renamed Inter-Pacific and turned into Berjaya&#x27;s holding company. Under his leadership, Berjaya&#x27;s pretax profit rose from RM 700,000 in 1984 to RM 70 million in 1989.

In 2010, Tan received a gaming license for his wholly owned subsidiary Ascot Sports Sdn Bhd. However, the license was revoked in October 2010, and as of July 2018 the government said it had no plans to reissue it.

Below are the listed subsidiaries under Berjaya Corporation Berhad:
* Berjaya Land Berhad
* Berjaya Sports Toto Berhad
* Berjaya Food Berhad (including Pappa Rich brand)
* REDtone International Berhad
* Berjaya Philippines Inc.

===Football===
====Cardiff City====

In May 2010, Tan became the owner of Cardiff City after a consortium of Malaysian investors (led by Dato Chan Tien Ghee) bought 30% of the club&#x27;s shares.

In May 2012, the consortium said they would invest £100 million to increase the stadium&#x27;s capacity and build a new training ground, providing they were given permission to rebrand the club from blue to red. The plans sparked outrage among Cardiff supporters, who quickly organised an emergency meeting to discuss how they would respond to the proposal. The plans were subsequently dropped.

One month later, the club went ahead with the rebranding, to expand Cardiff&#x27;s appeal in foreign markets. Cardiff&#x27;s badge was redesigned to include a red dragon, while their home kit was changed from blue to red. The club&#x27;s £30 million debt to the Langston Corporation was also cleared.

In April 2013, following Cardiff&#x27;s promotion to the Premier League, Tan promised to spend £25 million to help Cardiff establish themselves in the top flight, and publicly stated his interest in listing his 36.1% stake on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE). An initial public offering (IPO) would sell shares in the club to the public for the first time, in an attempt to gain capital to expand the business.

In October 2013, Tan created more controversy after suspending Iain Moody, the club&#x27;s head of recruitment, who had apparently overspent by £15 million during the summer transfer window. Moody was initially added to the backroom staff by then manager Malky Mackay, and helped Cardiff sign several players ahead of their inaugural Premier League campaign. He was replaced by Alisher Apsalyamovby, a 23-year-old Kazakh who was previously on work experience with the club and is a friend of Tan&#x27;s son. A few months later, following an investigation over Apsalyamovby&#x27;s visa, he was forced to leave the club.

Despite going over budget during the summer, Mackay publicly stated his plans to boost his squad during the January transfer window, which upset Tan, who said that no money would be made available. Mackay said he would not resign following Tan&#x27;s criticism, and was subsequently backed by Cardiff fans. Towards the end of December, Tan told Mackay to resign or be sacked. He managed two more games before being sacked. After his sacking, it was alleged that Mackay had sent texts of an anti-Chinese nature, which was defended by Dave Whelan, owner of his subsequent employers Wigan Athletic. Tan responded by calling both of them racists, and saying &quot;I hope that stops at two racists in Wigan, not snowballing to 2,000 or 20,000 racists in Wigan.&quot;

On 2 January 2014, former Manchester United striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær was hired as Mackay&#x27;s replacement, but he was unable to save Cardiff from relegation. Solskjær left the club later that year and was replaced by Russell Slade.

In October 2016, Tan hired Neil Warnock, at the time the oldest working coach in Britain, as manager. By 2018, Cardiff City had been promoted to the Premier League once again. In their one season back in the Premier League, they finished 18th and were relegated back to the Championship.

====FK Sarajevo====
In December 2013, Tan bought Bosnian club FK Sarajevo. Under the deal, Cardiff will cooperate with FK Sarajevo, exchanging players and taking part in a football academy, yet to be established, which Tan has said will lure new talents. FK Sarajevo have since brought in players such as Miloš Stojčev, Džemal Berberović and Nemanja Bilbija, who helped the club win the 2013–14 Bosnian Cup, their first title since winning the domestic Premier League in 2006–07. Prior to the Cup triumph, Robert Jarni was brought in as manager of the club in December 2013 by Tan, but was dismissed after only four months (on 7 April 2014, while the team were still in the semi-finals of the Bosnian Cup) because the club had failed to keep their chances of winning the premier league title alive during the later stages of the 2013-14 season. In July 2014, FK Sarajevo played a friendly match against Tan&#x27;s Cardiff City FC U21, winning 4–1. FK Sarajevo qualified for the Play-off round of the 2014–15 UEFA Europa League, where they lost to German Bundesliga side Borussia Mönchengladbach.

In May 2014, the heaviest rains and floods in 120 years hit Bosnia and the surrounding region. The worst affected areas were the towns of Doboj and Maglaj, which were cut off from the rest of the country when all major roads flooded. Damage from landslides and floods was estimated to run into hundreds of millions of euros and twenty-four people were killed. The cost of the disaster, officials said, could exceed that of the Bosnian War. In June 2014, Tan made a personal donation of €114,000, while the people of Malaysia raised a total of €169,000 toward Bosnia&#x27;s flood relief fund.

On 17 July 2014, during the halftime break of the Europa League qualifying match between FK Sarajevo and Norwegian club Haugesund at the Olympic Stadium in Sarajevo, Tan presented pledges of assistance of €255,000 each to two hospitals in Doboj and Maglaj, to be used for medical equipment. He said in a pre-match interview: &quot;Because of my involvement with Sarajevo Football Club, when I heard about the floods, I urged the &quot;Sun&quot; newspaper to run a campaign to raise donations to help Bosnia.&quot;

====Kortrijk====
Belgian football team KV Kortrijk was bought for five million euro by Vincent Tan on 12 May 2015. In 2019, Tan convinced the club to sign Malaysian teen sensation Luqman Hakim Shamsudin of Selangor on a five-year contract.

====Los Angeles FC====
In 2014, it was announced that Tan was part of a large ownership group involved with Major League Soccer club Los Angeles FC, who joined the league in 2018.

Reports from 2017 indicate that Tan is looking to sell Cardiff City, his stake in Major League Soccer’s Los Angeles FC and his professional teams in Bosnia and Belgium. In 2020, Tan sold his 20% stake in the club.

===Horse racing===
In April 2014, Tan (through one of his representatives) bought a two-year-old colt from Doncaster Bloodstock Breeze-Up Sales for £190,000. It will be trained by Australian Jeremy Gask in Wiltshire. Eamonn Wilmott, Gask&#x27;s business partner, said: &quot;We are very excited, and pleased to have Mr Tan involved. The horse looks exceptional and dominated the parade rings outside the sales.&quot;

== Philanthropy ==
Tan is the founder of the Better Malaysia Foundation, which provides interest-free loans and scholarships to students in need. In 2011, he was featured on &quot;Forbes Asia&quot;&#x27;s list of Heroes of Philanthropy due to his pledge to donate half his fortune to social causes.

In 2017, Vincent Tan donated RM500,000 to Mercy Malaysia and Tzu Chi Malaysia, bringing the total sum of his donations to both organizations to RM7.6 million.

<doc id="1086306" wikidata="Q756984" url="?curid=1086306" title="Shelling of Mainila">
<text>The Shelling of Mainila (, ), or the Mainila incident (), was a military incident on 26 November 1939 in which the Soviet Union&#x27;s Red Army shelled the Soviet village of Mainila () near Beloostrov. The Soviet Union declared that the fire originated from Finland across the nearby border and claimed to have had losses in personnel. Through that false flag operation, the Soviet Union gained a great propaganda boost and a &quot;casus belli&quot; for launching the Winter War four days later.

Historians have now concluded that the shelling of Mainila was a fabrication carried out by the Soviet NKVD state security agency.

== Background ==
The Soviet Union had signed international and mutual nonaggression treaties with Finland: the Treaty of Tartu of 1920, the Non-aggression Pact between Finland and the Soviet Union signed in 1932 and again in 1934, and further the Charter of the League of Nations. The Soviet government attempted to adhere to a tradition of legalism, and a &quot;casus belli&quot; was required for war. Earlier in the same year, Nazi Germany had staged the similar Gleiwitz incident to generate an excuse to withdraw from its nonaggression pact with Poland. Also the Soviet war games held in March 1938 and 1939 had been based on a scenario where border incidents taking place at the village of Mainila would have sparked the war.

== The incident ==
Seven shots were fired, and three Finnish observation posts detected their fall. These witnesses estimated that the shells detonated approximately inside Soviet territory. Finland proposed a neutral investigation of the incident, but the Soviet Union refused and broke diplomatic relations with Finland on November 29.

Materials in the private archives of Soviet party leader Andrei Zhdanov show that the incident was orchestrated to paint Finland as an aggressor and launch an offensive. The Finnish side denied responsibility for the attacks and identified Soviet artillery as their source—indeed, the war diaries of nearby Finnish artillery batteries show that Mainila was out of range of all of them, as they had been withdrawn to prevent such incidents.

The Soviet Union then renounced the non-aggression pact with Finland and, on 30 November 1939, launched the first offensives of the Winter War.

==Aftermath==

John Gunther, an American journalist and author wrote in December 1939 that the incident &quot;was as clumsy and obviously fabricated as all such &#x27;incidents&#x27; have been since Mukden in 1931&quot;. The Finns conducted an immediate investigation, which concluded that no Finnish artillery or mortars could have reached the village of Mainila. Field Marshal C.G.E. Mannerheim had ordered all Finnish guns drawn back out of range. Finnish border guards testified they had heard the sound of artillery fire from the Soviet side of the border.

Russian historian Pavel Aptekar analyzed declassified Soviet military documents and found that the daily reports from troops in the area did not report any losses in personnel during the time period in question, leading him to conclude that the shelling of Soviet troops was staged.

In his 1970 memoir, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev wrote on the start of the Winter War: &quot;We had fired our salvo, and the Finns had replied with artillery fire of their own. De facto, the war had begun. There is, of course, another version of the facts: it&#x27;s said that the Finns started shooting first and that we were compelled to shoot back. It&#x27;s always like that when people start a war. They say, &quot;You fired the first shot,&quot; or &quot;You slapped me first, and I&#x27;m only hitting back.&quot;

On 18 May 1994, Russian President Boris Yeltsin denounced the Winter War, saying it had been a war of aggression.

== 1941 Finnish shelling of Mainila ==

During the Continuation War, the 18th Division of the Finnish Army reached Rajajoki on 31 August 1941 and started preparations for taking the village of Mainila. Their division commander Colonel Pajari recognized the propaganda value and arranged for an artillery strike on the village to be witnessed by combat camera personnel, and the village was taken a couple of days later. In his report to HQ in Mikkeli, Pajari stated that &quot;on 31st August 1941 the 18th division conducted the Shelling of Mainila.&quot;

<text>Thomas Simpson FRS (20 August 1710 – 14 May 1761) was a British mathematician and inventor known for the eponymous Simpson&#x27;s rule to approximate definite integrals. The attribution, as often in mathematics, can be debated: this rule had been found 100 years earlier by Johannes Kepler, and in German it is called Keplersche Fassregel, or roughly &quot;Kepler&#x27;s Barrel Rule&quot;.

==Biography==

Simpson was born in Sutton Cheney, Leicestershire. The son of a weaver, Simpson taught himself mathematics. At the age of nineteen, he married a fifty-year old widow with two children. As a youth, he became interested in astrology after seeing a solar eclipse. He also dabbled in divination and caused fits in a girl after &#x27;raising a devil&#x27; from her. After this incident, he and his wife fled to Derby. He moved with his wife and children to London at age twenty-five, where he supported his family by weaving during the day and teaching mathematics at night.

From 1743, he taught mathematics at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich. Simpson was a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1758, Simpson was elected a foreign member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

He died in Market Bosworth, and was laid to rest in Sutton Cheney. A plaque inside the church commemorates him.

== Early work ==

Simpson&#x27;s treatise entitled &quot;The Nature and Laws of Chance&quot; and &quot;The Doctrine of Annuities and Reversions&quot; were based on the work of De Moivre and were attempts at making the same material more brief and understandable. Simpson stated this clearly in &quot;The Nature and Laws of Chance&quot;, referring to Abraham De Moivre&#x27;s &quot;The Doctrine of Chances&quot;: &quot;tho&#x27; it neither wants Matter nor Elegance to recommend it, yet the Price must, I am sensible, have put it out of the Power of many to purchase it&quot;. In both works, Simpson cited De Moivre&#x27;s work and did not claim originality beyond the presentation of some more accurate data. While he and De Moivre initially got along, De Moivre eventually felt that his income was threatened by Simpson&#x27;s work and in his second edition of &quot;Annuities upon Lives&quot;, wrote in the preface:

&quot;After the pains I have taken to perfect this Second Edition, it may happen, that a certain Person, whom I need not name, out of Compassion to the Public, will publish a Second Edition of his Book on the same Subject, which he will afford at a very moderate Price, not regarding whether he mutilates my Propositions, obscures what is clear, makes a Shew of new Rules, and works by mine; in short, confounds, in his usual way, every thing with a croud of useless Symbols; if this be the Case, I must forgive the indigent Author, and his disappointed Bookseller.&quot;

==Work==
The method commonly called Simpson&#x27;s Rule was known and used earlier by Bonaventura Cavalieri (a student of Galileo) in 1639, and later by James Gregory; still, the long popularity of Simpson&#x27;s textbooks invites this association with his name, in that many readers would have learnt it from them.

In the context of disputes surrounding methods advanced by René Descartes, Pierre de Fermat proposed the challenge to find a point D such that the sum of the distances to three given points, A, B and C is least, a challenge popularised in Italy by Marin Mersenne in the early 1640s. Simpson treats the problem in the first part of &quot;Doctrine and Application of Fluxions&quot; (1750), on pp. 26–28, by the description of circular arcs at which the edges of the triangle ABC subtend an angle of pi/3; in the second part of the book, on pp. 505–506 he extends this geometrical method, in effect, to weighted sums of the distances. Several of Simpson&#x27;s books contain selections of optimisation problems treated by simple geometrical considerations in similar manner, as (for Simpson) an illuminating counterpart to possible treatment by fluxional (calculus) methods. But Simpson does not treat the problem in the essay on geometrical problems of maxima and minima appended to his textbook on Geometry of 1747, although it does appear in the considerably reworked edition of 1760. Comparative attention might, however, usefully be drawn to a paper in English from eighty years earlier as suggesting that the underlying ideas were already recognised then:
* J. Collins A Solution, Given by Mr. John Collins of a Chorographical Probleme, Proposed by Richard Townley Esq. Who Doubtless Hath Solved the Same Otherwise, &quot;Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London&quot;, 6 (1671), pp. 2093–2096.

Of further related interest are problems posed in the early 1750s by J. Orchard, in &quot;The British Palladium&quot;, and by T. Moss, in &quot;The Ladies&#x27; Diary; or Woman&#x27;s Almanack&quot; (at that period not yet edited by Simpson).

==Simpson-Weber triangle problem==

This type of generalisation was later popularised by Alfred Weber in 1909. The Simpson-Weber triangle problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A, B, and C in such a way that the sum of the transportation costs between D and each of the three other points is minimised. In 1971, Luc-Normand Tellier found the first direct (non iterative) numerical solution of the Fermat and Simpson-Weber triangle problems. Long before Von Thünen&#x27;s contributions, which go back to 1818, the Fermat point problem can be seen as the very beginning of space economy.

In 1985, Luc-Normand Tellier formulated an all-new problem called the “attraction-repulsion problem”, which constitutes a generalisation of both the Fermat and Simpson-Weber problems. In its simplest version, the attraction-repulsion problem consists in locating a point D with respect to three points A1, A2 and R in such a way that the attractive forces exerted by points A1 and A2, and the repulsive force exerted by point R cancel each other out. In the same book, Tellier solved that problem for the first time in the triangle case, and he reinterpreted the space economy theory, especially, the theory of land rent, in the light of the concepts of attractive and repulsive forces stemming from the attraction-repulsion problem. That problem was later further analysed by mathematicians like Chen, Hansen, Jaumard and Tuy (1992), and Jalal and Krarup (2003). The attraction-repulsion problem is seen by Ottaviano and Thisse (2005) as a prelude to the New Economic Geography that developed in the 1990s, and earned Paul Krugman a Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences in 2008.

<text>Anthony Robin Ellis (born 8 January 1942) is a British actor and cookery book writer best known for his role as Captain Ross Poldark in the 29 episodes of the 1975 BBC classic series &quot;Poldark&quot;, adapted from a series of books by the British author Winston Graham. He also appeared in &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, &quot;Cluedo&quot;, &quot;The Good Soldier&quot; (an adaptation of the Ford Madox Ford novel), &quot;Elizabeth R&quot; (playing Essex), &quot;The Moonstone&quot;, &quot;Bel Ami&quot;, &quot;Sense and Sensibility&quot; (which also featured Clive Francis), &quot;The Casebook of Sherlock Holmes&quot;, &quot;She Loves Me&quot; (in which he sings) and &quot;Blue Remembered Hills&quot; (written by Dennis Potter). In 2015–17 and 2019 he appeared in the &quot;Poldark&quot; series remake as Reverend Halse.

==Life and career==
Ellis was born in Ipswich, Suffolk. He was educated at the independent Highgate School in Highgate in north London, and at Fitzwilliam College, Cambridge where he read history and appeared in over 20 plays. His first West End performance was in Sheridan&#x27;s &quot;The Rivals&quot; at the Haymarket Theatre, as Captain Jack Absolute. He went on to play in &quot;The Real Inspector Hound&quot; at the Criterion Theatre and &quot;Widowers&#x27; Houses&quot; at the Royal Court. He was part of the innovative Actors&#x27; Company, founded in 1972 by Ian McKellen and Edward Petherbridge, organised and run democratically by the actors themselves. In that repertory company he appeared in &quot;&#x27;Tis Pity She&#x27;s a Whore&quot;, &quot;Ruling the Roost&quot;, &quot;The Way of the World&quot;, &quot;The Wood Demon&quot;, &quot;The Bacchae&quot;, &quot;Tartuffe&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot; and &quot;Knots&quot; (based on the R. D. Laing book).

Ellis&#x27;s big break came in 1975 with his first major role in a popular television series. He played the heart throb Ross Poldark in the BBC 1 series, &quot;Poldark&quot;.

In 1969, he played Ames in the film &quot;Arthur? Arthur!&quot;. Ellis co-starred with Lee Remick in the Merchant Ivory film &quot;The Europeans&quot; (1979), based on the novel by Henry James, playing the role of John Acton. Ellis appeared in the CBS mini-series &quot;The Curse of King Tut&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (playing Howard Carter, the Englishman who discovered the tomb of King Tut), in the ITV drama &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and in a BBC adaptation of &quot;A Dark-Adapted Eye&quot; (1994) a psychological thriller written by Ruth Rendell.

Ellis also had a long career in the theatre, including a stint with the Royal Shakespeare Company. He appeared there in a musical version of &quot;The Comedy of Errors&quot; playing Pinch; in &quot;King Lear&quot; playing Edmund; &quot;Troilus and Cressida&quot; playing Achilles; and in &quot;Much Ado About Nothing&quot; playing Don Pedro. His last West End theatre performance was with Zoë Wanamaker in &quot;Sylvia&quot; by A.R. Gurney at the Apollo Theatre in 1996.

He is a well-known voiceover artist, and co-owned a voiceover agency called Voices in London for many years. He has narrated documentaries, including &quot;Fall of the Wall&quot;, &quot;The Second Russian Revolution&quot;, &quot;The Death of Yugoslavia&quot; and &quot;End of Empire&quot;.

He is the author of a memoir entitled &quot;Making Poldark&quot; about the series (originally published by Bossiney Books, ). &quot;Making Poldark&quot; was expanded and revised in 2012, and republished by Palo Alto Publishing (). An audio version of his memoir was released on Audible in June 2015.

He had a recurring role in the 2015-2019 BBC adaptation of &quot;Poldark&quot; as Reverend Halse.

In 2021, he played the Ghost in an online production of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, produced by the Gorilla Repertory Theater in New York, which was scheduled for completion in autumn 2021.

==Cookery book writer==

His first cookery book, &quot;Delicious Dishes for Diabetics: A Mediterranean Way of Eating&quot;, was published in 2011. The US edition was titled &quot;Delicious Dishes for Diabetics: Eating Well with Type 2 Diabetes&quot;.

His second cookery book, &quot;Healthy Eating for Life&quot;, came out in 2014. His third cookery book, &quot;Mediterranean Cooking for Diabetics: Delicious Dishes to Control or Avoid Diabetes&quot; was published in 2016 by Little, Brown UK. His fourth cookery book, &quot;Robin Ellis&#x27;s Mediterranean Vegetarian Cooking&quot; was published in June 2020 by Little, Brown UK.

==Personal life==
Ellis lives with his wife Meredith in southwest France. His younger brothers are the actor Jack Ellis and the director Peter Ellis, who died in 2006.

<text>Station Group Gardermoen (Norwegian: Gardermoen flystasjon) is located about 50 km north of Oslo, Norway. It is colocated with Norway&#x27;s main airport, Oslo Airport, Gardermoen.

335 Squadron and 717 Squadron of the Royal Norwegian Air Force are stationed at Gardermoen, which operates respectively C-130J-30 &quot;Super Hercules&quot; transport aircraft and Dassault Falcon 20 electronic warfare aircraft. 

==History==
The Norwegian Army started using Gardermoen as a camp already in 1740, when it was called Fredericksfeldt. The first flight took place in 1912, and by 1920 there were multiple hangars at the airport.

During the German invasion of Norway in World War II the Germans bombed the airport, but built it up with two 2000-meter runways during the war.

The military airport was founded on December 1, 1996, with new installations for 1,2 billion NOK. The airfield is built to easily expand cheaply and fast whenever needed. On October 8, 1998 the main airport serving Oslo was moved from Fornebu to Gardermoen. The new airport had among other facilities two runways.

The Air Force was considering moving its operations at Gardermoen to Rygge Air Station by consent of the Chief of Defence of Norway, General Sigurd Frisvold in the 2003-2004 period; however, this proposition was turned down by the Norwegian Parliament&#x27;s Defence Committee. Thus, the air station currently remains operational.

<text>The Suba (&quot;Abasuba&quot;) are a heterogeneous Bantu group of people in Kenya with an amalgamation of clans drawn from their main tribes Ganda people, Luhya people, and Soga who speak the Suba language that is closely similar to the Ganda language spare some lexical items borrowed from Luo. Their population is estimated at 157,787, with substantial fluent speakers. They migrated to Kenya from Uganda and settled on the two Lake Victoria islands of Rusinga and Mfangano, others also settled on the mainland areas including Gembe, Gwassi, Kaksingri of Suba South and Migori and are believed to be the last tribe to have settled in Kenya. The immigrants to present-day Subaland trace their ancestry among Ganda people, Luhya people, Soga people, and the Luo people. The evidence supporting this is the fact that some Suba groups speak languages similar to Luganda, Lusoga and the Luhya. The Suba groups tracing ancestry among the Kenyan tribes preceded those groups from Uganda in present-day Subaland and are the numerous and influential ones. Those groups from Uganda are mostly concentrated in Rusinga and Mfangano islands with small pockets of them being found in mainland Kenya. Linguistically, the Suba are highly influenced by the neighbouring Luo, to the point of a language shift having taken place among large portions of the mainland Suba. As a result, their own language has been classified as endangered. Despite this language shift, the Suba have kept a distinct ethnic identity. The Rusinga Festival is held in December of every year as a cultural festival to celebrate and preserve Suba culture and language.

A community cultural festival known as Rusinga Island Cultural, Religious and Arts Festival popularly known as RICRAF is an annual community event which celebrates the cultural heritage of the indigenous Abasuba peoples of Rusinga Island, celebrates the island&#x27;s archeological significance and gives the islanders a platform to showcase cultural arts and industry. 

The Abagirango (Suna Girango) is another group that is usually erroneously grouped together with the Abasuba of Suba South and Suba North, since they also call themselves Abasuba. But, this is because Girango had a son named Musuba (Suba) and this Musuba had many children than his other brothers, for instance, Tegi and Gire hence descendants of Musuba calling themselves Abasuba meaning Musuba&#x27;s people. Suba clans in Suna include Simbete, Sweta, and Wiga; and they have a clear and distinct ancestry that goes back to forefathers who crossed red Sea from Misri as illustrated below:

Ragwe&lt;--Siora&lt;--Montheya&lt;--Girango&lt;--Musubaabs

Their language is also distinct and very different from the Olusuba language spoken by the Abasuba of Homa Bay County. The Suna people speak the Ekisuba/Egesuba language which is the same language spoken by their brothers the Suba people (Tanzania). Currently, those who claim to speak Ekisuba actually speak igikuria (bunchari dialect) which is the same language as the Ekisuba/Egesuba spare the name difference.

There are also people in Tanzania (Tarime, Musoma and Rorya Districts, Mara Region) who call themselves Suba, and are part of the Abagirango since their language and cultural heritage is the same.

==General Information==

The Suba people who settled on the islands include smaller clans called the Eluzinga or&#x27;Chula&#x27;, meaning the people of the islands. This group includes the following clans: Waware, Awakiwanga (Kaswanga), Wanyama, Waregi, Awamasengere (Kamasengere), Wasaki and Awangoze (Ngodhe), while others were called the Awibuang&#x27;ano/Awaivuang&#x27;ano (Mfangano/Fang&#x27;ano). This group includes Wakula, Wasamo, Wagimbe, Wiramba who are related to Awakiimba (Kakiimba), Awisokolwa and Waozi. Other groups also poured into Mfangano due to the pressure from advancing Luos in Central Nyanza especially in areas around Imbo Naya. They settled in Mfangano and they include; Wayokia, Wakisasi/Awakisori, Wakiara/Wakiala. Others include Kamreri, Kayanja and Waondo who are found in Mirunda Gembe Suba North. Other clans began forming when the people did much more expansion onto the islands. For example, there are other clans whose clan names were distinguished by their new geographic location.

The clan that predominantly lives the closest to Lake Victoria and is the bigger of the sub groups is the people that go by the name Awigassi or Gwasii and they happen to reside upon the Gwasii Hills, Gwassi and Wakula are related since their forefathers Kiboye and Witewe were brothers before escaping to the east after a revolt in the Bagandan Kingdom in the year 1700. Waware were also involved in this struggle. Other groups that reside on a hill are the Uregi who reside on the Uregi Hills of Meari which is a town in the Nyanza province as well as Awangoe residing in the Ungoe Hills. The Awakune or Kaksingri clan live along the lake from Gingo to a small fishing village called Sindo to Ragwe and Ngeri, and they are closely related with Uregi who live in the Uregi Hills since their forefathers came from the same home. Today many people in the islands and the highlands subsequent to Lake Victoria still retain the original Suba dialect that is the Olusuba that is closely related to the Ganda language, and Lusoga although it is heavily influenced by the bigger Dholuo and Kuria in some areas through interaction. As a result of that interaction, the Olusuba has borrowed a significant amount of lexical items from Dholuo and Kuria that were absent in the original Luganda-like Olusuba dialect.

Further information upon the tribesmen&#x27;s expansion remained unclear pretty unclear considering that the Niger-Congo family has the largest number of dialects within Africa. Distinguishing the different dialects become rather difficult because they all predominantly use the noun class system. With that being said it has become rather unclear as to how deep into Kenya the Suba people managed to travel being as distinguishing them from other dialects becomes harder and harder as the language is slowly being influenced by its neighboring language, Luo. Suba scholars have taken the initiative to rewrite the History and more information is now available.

Other Suba speakers are found in the Southern shores of the Lake in Muhuru Bay. They are generally called Muhuhuru People and they also speak the Suba language. Some pockets of Uregi, Gwassi, and Kaksingri are also found in Muhuru Bay in Migori county.

Even the greater Suna people who based in Migori county usually identify themselves as Suba and are linguistically and culturally distinct and are unconnected to the Abasuba from Suba district. The Suna people are a heterogeneous group that comprises Luo and splinter tribes from the Kuria. The Suna have however integrated clans originally part of the Olusuba speaking Suba such as Waware, Wiga and Kaswanga into their various sub-groups. The Suna people are the Abagirango or Girango people who call themselves Abasuba because Girango had a son named Musuba (Suba) and not because they are related to the Olusuba speaking Suba of Homa Bay County who are descended of migrants from Buganda and Busoga that entered Kenya through Rusinga and Mfangano Islands by boats.

However, the correct name for the Suna people is ABAGIRANGO although they are referenced as Suna/Suba-Girango to distinguish them from the Olusuba speaking Suba of Homa Bay County who are distinct in terms of heritage from the Abagirango. The term Suba was originally used by Luos to refer to splinter tribes from their main tribes of Kisii, Kuria and Luhya and the term later became the name of the Olusuba speaking people of Homa Bay County who migrated from Uganda escaping the expansion of the Buganda Kingdom. They settled in Kenya as refugees and they had a well formed and a very organised language, political system and economic activities. The Suba in Suna Migori County, Kenya refers to a heterogeneous people of Luo, and Kuria. A clear evidence of this is a town named Suba Kuria in Migori County, Kenya. The Suna Abasuba include the Wasweta (Kadika, Katiga, Kakrao,), Wasimbete (Bahiri kiberi, Bahiri ng&#x27;ong&#x27;o, bahiri Nkena, Miaro, Nchogu) and Wiga (Wakwena, Nyasasi, Wanje, Nyathocho, Kamsuru).

Their original language is Ekisuba/Egesuba which has several dialects such as sweta, simbiti, surwa, kine, etc. Currently, they speak a language that includes a combination of Kisuba and Egikuria language – that is the bunchari dialect, and many of the communities interact freely with the Suba people in Tanzania (Surwa, Sweta, Simbiti, Hacha, Nguruimi, Kine etc.) and the Kuria (Rianchoka, Banchari, Batimbaru etc.) people. Clans of Suna people; Wasweta, Kadika, Wiga, Wanje, Katiga, Kakaeta, Kanyameda, Wasimbete, Wakwera, Wanyara, Kamn&#x27;go&#x27;ngo

==Culture==

The culture of the Suba People is very distinct from those of the Luo. The Suba people practice circumcision as an initiation process from boyhood to adulthood. Mostly boys are circumcised. In some clans, even girls are circumcised. Suna Girango circumcision process is very similar to their neighbors the kuria even the saro names, for instance, Nginaro, Misungu, Gitang&#x27;osa, Kirina, etc.

Clans had roles assigned to them such as circumcision, animals sacrifices and dispute settlements.

Subas were also involved in rain Making sacrifices such as animal sacrifices to appease the gods and clan spirits called Emisambwa singular Omusambwa in Suba District. These were carried out in special shrines which can still be found across Suba such as Utende, Kwitutu, Mungusa and Kiboye Shrines. Subas also revered snakes such as the Python and they believed that Clan spirit dwelled amongst them. An example is given of the spirit of Gumba in Rusinga and Mungusa of Kaksingri.

Dowry included 30heads of Cattle but this also depends upon the purity of the lady to be married. A lady with a child would attract lower number of heads of cattle. Her age mates would accompany her with songs to her new home and celebrate. Alcohol made from Sorghum and Cassava was served as a form of celebration. Ladies also decorated their tummy with special drawings.

During funerals there were gifted elders who would carry Engawvo a type of shield and a long spear and Chant around the homestead while adorned with twigs.

Suba people also practiced rock art as witnessed in the caves of Kwitone in Gulwe Mfangano.

The Suba people are cattle farmers- a culture that they borrowed from the Luos. Even though the Luo no longer keep large herds of cattle, the Suba still keep cattle in large numbers. This is especially common in Migori District in Suba west division where cattle rustling between Kurians and Girango people is common. Subas also loved sport fishing where there was a special species they went for.
The Abasuba also commonly practice polygamy, some of the members of the clan are named to have had even ten wives.

==Language barrier==
One of the biggest issues relating to the Suba language declination is the sole fact that Kenya viewed the language as inferior. The education system is teaching English and Luo to the newer generations of Suba children thus impairing the possibilities of the language to come back. Some even say that the fluent language speakers are middle-aged and have yet to establish a system to rebuild the language so that it may take proper footing as one of Africa&#x27;s many languages, thus it has established a language status of at risk. Many blame the elders as they do not take proper measures to ensure the language&#x27;s existence by teaching their young ones from an early onset. The biggest concern deriving from the pressures of reviving the language is the fear that their children will begin to build an identity crisis while attending school, considering that it is taught in either English or Luo.

Other than the Rusinga Festival, one of the most recent efforts to preserve the dying language has been the production of a Bible in Suba. Efforts to translate the Bible into Suba started as early as 1988, but it was only completed in 2011.

<doc id="1086319" wikidata="Q14554941" url="?curid=1086319" title="Asphodelaceae">
<text>Asphodelaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Asparagales. Such a family has been recognized by most taxonomists, but the circumscription has varied widely. In its current circumscription in the APG IV system, it includes about 40 genera and 900 known species. The type genus is &quot;Asphodelus&quot;.

The family has a wide, but scattered, distribution throughout the tropics and temperate zones; for example, &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot; is endemic to Australia, while the &quot;Aloes&quot; are unique to Africa and parts of the Arabian Peninsula. Many of the family&#x27;s genera are cultivated as ornamentals, with some being highly collectible and sought-after, such as &quot;Haworthia&quot; and &quot;Gasteria&quot;, as well as their intergeneric hybrids with &quot;Aloe&quot; (&quot;x Gasteraloe&quot;, x &quot;Gastorthia&quot;, x &quot;Haworthaloe&quot;, etc.), while a few are grown commercially for cut flowers. Two species of &quot;Aloe&quot;, &quot;A. vera&quot; and &quot;A. maculata&quot;, are grown for their leaf sap, which contains digestive enzymes, and has medicinal and cosmetic applications.

==Description==

Members of the Asphodelaceae are diverse, with few characters uniting the three subfamilies currently recognized. The presence of anthraquinones is one common character. The flowers (the inflorescence) are typically borne on a leafless stalk (scape) which arises from a basal rosette of leaves. The individual flowers have jointed stalks (pedicels). A disk of woody tissue (a hypostase) is present at the base of the ovule.

The subfamily Xanthorrhoeoideae contains only the genus &quot;Xanthorrhoea&quot;, native to Australia. Plants typically develop thick woody stems; the flowers are arranged in a dense spike. Members of the subfamily Asphodeloideae are often leaf succulents, such as aloes and haworthias, although the subfamily also includes ornamental perennials such as red hot pokers (&quot;Kniphofia&quot;). Members of the subfamily Hemerocallidoideae are varied in habit. Daylilies (&quot;Hemerocallis&quot;) are one of the widely grown members of this subfamily.

==Systematics==

===Phylogeny===

The order Asparagales can be divided into a basal paraphyletic group, the &quot;lower Asparagales&quot;, which includes the Asphodelaceae as defined here, and a well-supported monophyletic group of &quot;core Asparagales&quot;, comprising Amaryllidaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot; and Asparagaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;. Three separate families were at one time recognized (e.g. in the first APG system of 1998): Asphodelaceae, Hemerocallidaceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that the three are closely related, although Rudall considered that the combination into a single clade was not supported by morphological analysis. The most recent APG classification, the APG IV system of 2016, places the three former families into a single family, the Asphodelaceae &quot;sensu lato&quot;. The former families are treated as three subfamilies: Asphodeloideae, Hemerocallidoideae and Xanthorrhoeoideae.

The following phylogenetic tree for Asphodelaceae sensu lato is based on a molecular phylogenetic analysis of the DNA sequences of the chloroplast genes rbcL, matK, and ndhF. All branches have at least 70% bootstrap support. Of the 36 genera recognized by the authors, 29 were sampled. &quot;Eccremis&quot; was not sampled, but is added here because it is known to be closely related to &quot;Pasithea&quot; and is often combined with it. &quot;Hodgsoniola&quot; belongs somewhere in the grade from &quot;Tricoryne&quot; to &quot;Johnsonia&quot;. The unsampled genera, &quot;Astroloba, Chortolirion&quot; and &quot;Gasteria&quot;, belong to subfamily Asphodeloideae.

===History===
The family now called Asphodelaceae has had a complex history; its circumscription and placement in an order have varied widely.

In the Cronquist system of 1981, members of the Asphodelaceae were placed in the order Liliales. Cronquist had difficulty classifying the less obviously delineated lilioid monocots; consequently, he placed taxa from both the modern orders Asparagales and Liliales into a single family Liliaceae.

In some of the older systems of plant taxonomy, such as the Cronquist system, the plants that now form the family Dasypogonaceae were also considered to belong to this family. Molecular phylogenetic studies have shown that Dasypogonaceae belongs to the commelinids and is therefore not even in the same order as Asphodelaceae.

The decision to group three formerly separate families, Asphodelaceae sensu stricto, Hemerocallidaceae and Xanthorrhoeaceae, into a single family first occurred as an option in the APG II system of 2003. The name used for the broader family was then Xanthorrhoeaceae; earlier references to the Xanthorrhoeaceae relate only to the subfamily Xanthorrhoeoideae. The changes were a consequence of improvement in molecular and morphological analysis and also a reflection of the increased emphasis on placing families within an appropriate order.

The APG III system of 2009 dropped the option of keeping the three families separate, using only the expanded family, still under the name Xanthorrhoeaceae. Anticipating a decision to conserve the name Asphodelaceae over Xanthorrhoeaceae (which came to pass in 2017), the APG IV system uses Asphodelaceae as the name for the expanded family.
The three previous families were then the subfamilies Asphodeloideae, Hemerocallidoideae and Xanthorrhoeoideae. Earlier these three had been treated as separate families.

The family Asphodelaceae was made a nomen conservandum (conserved name) in 2017. Previously, the name Xanthorrhoeaceae had priority. This was anticipated in the APG IV family lists.

===Genera===
The genera listed below are from the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families, with the division into subfamilies based on APWeb .

The nothogenus &quot;Gasteraloe&quot; contains hybrids between &quot;Aloe&quot; and &quot;Gasteria&quot;.

The genus &quot;Xeronema&quot; is now placed in a separate family, the Xeronemataceae.

<doc id="1086327" wikidata="Q2019734" url="?curid=1086327" title="Goudhurst">
<text>Goudhurst is a village and civil parish in the borough of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England. It lies in the Weald, around south of Maidstone, on the crossroads of the A262 and B2079.

The parish consists of three wards: Goudhurst, Kilndown and Curtisden Green. Hamlets include Bedgebury Cross, Iden Green, Stonecrouch and Winchet Hill.

==Etymology==
The word Goudhurst is derived from Goud Hurst, the &quot;Good Hurst&quot; (an opening in a forest) due to the hill&#x27;s strategic position within the local landscape. A less plausible (but attractive) derivation is the Old English &quot;guo hyrst&quot;, meaning Battle Hill, or the wooded hill on which a battle has been fought. The name apparently commemorates a battle fought on this high ground in Saxon times. The spelling has evolved over the centuries: Gmthhyrste (), Guthurst or Guhthersts (), Gudhersts (1232), Guthhurste (1278), Goutherst (1316), Goodherst (1610), then the current-day spelling.

==History==

The village was one of those involved in the Wealden iron industry; it was a centre for the growing of hops and for weaving. A group of weavers&#x27; cottages stands opposite the church.

The Battle of Goudhurst in 1747 led to the end of the Hawkhurst Gang of smugglers and the execution of local gang leader Thomas Kingsmill whose body was hung in chains in the village.

The village&#x27;s recent history is documented in the &quot;Goudhurst Jubilee Book&quot; (1935), &quot;Goudhurst Coronation Book&quot; (1937) and &quot;Goudhurst and Kilndown Millennium Book&quot; (2001, ) which contain reminiscences, directories, historical notes, matters of local intelligence and records of celebrations starting from the 1800s or before. The books were printed as limited editions with the authors recording the written and the oral history of the village.

In 2023 Peter A Harding published &quot;After the War was Over&quot; (2023) which captures his memories of an idyllic childhood at Goudhurst during the late 1940s and early 1950s.

===St Mary&#x27;s Church===

The church stands on a hill and its tower commands views of the surrounding countryside. 
For this reason it was a major surveying point in the Anglo-French Survey (1784–1790) to measure the precise distance and relationship between the Paris Observatory and the Royal Greenwich Observatory, supervised by General William Roy. Sightings were made to Frant to the west, Tenterden to the east, Wrotham Hill to the north and Fairlight Down to the south.

St Mary&#x27;s church was founded in 1170 by Robert de Crevecour. The church has been altered and restored many times over the centuries. Until 1637 it had a tall spire which was destroyed by lightning in that year. In 1638 three London masons rebuilt the west tower. During the Victorian era the church was restored by the architects William Slater and Richard Carpenter. The church contains a remarkable painted wood and gesso effigy to Sir Alexander Culpeper (d.1599) and his wife Constance.

===Bedgebury===
Bedgebury is one of the oldest estates in Kent: having given its name to the de Bedgebury family, it passed into the hands of the Culpeper family in 1450. When the estate was sold in 1680, a new house was built which itself became a girls&#x27; school in the 1920s (closed in the summer of 2006). In 2007 the school was purchased by the Bell
Educational Trust, an educational charity. In the summer of 2007 the school reopened as the Bell Bedgebury International School, and the grounds also played host to the Bell Bedgebury Language Centre. In November 2010, the owners decided to close and sell the school. – the riding school and 125 acres were sold separately and are now independent. Bedgebury Pinetum is nearby. It was acquired by the Forestry Commission in 1924.

=== Village Green ===
A former Glebe Field at the East end of St Mary&#x27;s Church was registered as a village green by Kent County Council in June 2016. It is 2.47 acres in extent and is surrounded by trees and hedges. It is owned by the Diocese of Canterbury and is maintained by Goudhurst Parish Council which has a long lease for this purpose. A volunteer group called The Friends of Goudhurst Village Green has been established with the aim to protect and preserve Goudhurst Village Green for the use of the residents of Goudhurst Parish by right, for lawful sports and pastimes, in perpetuity. St Mary&#x27;s Church is permitted to use the village green for parking for occasional events such as large weddings and funerals.

===Public transport===

In the past, the branch railway line from Paddock Wood had a station for the village. It was opened on 1 October 1892 and was originally named &#x27;Hope Mill for Goudhurst and Lamberhurst&#x27; before being renamed to &#x27;Goudhurst&#x27; on 4 September 1893, the day the final part of the line came into service – the extension to Hawkhurst via Cranbrook; physically, the station was about half a mile from the centre of Goudhurst, and somewhat further from Lamberhurst. The station was closed on 12 June 1961 because of lack of use, passenger numbers having dropped to fewer than 200 per day. The track was lifted in 1964, and in 1967 the station sites were offered for sale.

At present, the only public transport for Goudhurst are two bus routes operated by Arriva Southern Counties – the 26 to Maidstone, and the 297 which runs to Tunbridge Wells in the west and Tenterden and Ashford in the east.

==Education==
The village is in the Cranbrook School catchment area.

<doc id="1086329" wikidata="Q259135" url="?curid=1086329" title="Amanita porphyria">
<text>Amanita porphyria, also known as the grey veiled amanita or the porphyry amanita, is a fairly common, inedible mushroom of the genus &quot;Amanita&quot; found in Europe and North America.

==Taxonomy==
This fungus was described in 1805 under the current name, &quot;Amanita porphyria&quot;, by Johannes Baptista von Albertini and Lewis David de Schweinitz in their work &quot;Conspectus Fungorum in Lusatiae superioris agro Niskiensi crescentium e methodo Persooniana&quot; (&quot;An overview of fungi growing in the area of Niesky in Upper Lusatia, according to the methodology of Persoon&quot;). The name was then sanctioned by Fries, meaning that the name &quot;Amanita porphyria&quot; is given priority even if the normal nomenclatural rules would give precedence to another nameand indeed the Danish mycologist Heinrich Christian Friedrich Schumacher had already described the same species as &quot;Agaricus gracilis&quot; in 1803. The sanctioning can be shown in the author string by means of a colon as in the following: &quot;&quot;A. porphyria&quot; Alb. &amp; Schwein. : Fr.&quot;

The epithet &quot;porphyria&quot; comes from the Ancient Greek word porphúra (πορφύρα), meaning the Tyrian purple dye. This colour may be seen in the cap of the mushroom (though it is not always evident).

==Description==
The smooth cap is hemispherical when young and later flat, sometimes with grey patches of veil. It is about in diameter, and brown with either a purplish or a greyish hue.

As normal in the genus &quot;Amanita&quot;, the gills are whitish and free from the stem and the spores are white. The gills darken when bruised.

The stem is 5–12 cm high and 0.6–1.5 cm thick, with a basal bulb which may or may not be surrounded by a white membranous volva. The fragile ring is grey-violet or blackened.

The flesh is white with a smell of raw potato or radish.

The amyloid spores are almost spherical with a diameter of 8–10 μm.

=== Similar species ===
&quot;A. porphyria&quot; is similar in overall shape and smell to the very common &quot;A. citrina&quot;, but the cap colour is different and the ring has a grey/violet coloration. It can also be confused with the panther cap (&quot;A. pantherina&quot;)

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;A. porphyria&quot; usually grows on poor soil under coniferous trees, especially spruce, but also fir, hemlock, and some deciduous ones such as birch. It is mycorrhizal, living in symbiosis with the trees.

It occurs from summer to autumn and is commoner in mountains or further to the north. In Europe it is very common in boreal or hemiboreal forests but less so in temperate areas. It is also found in northern North America from east to west. There was some uncertainty whether North American specimens should really be classified under a different name, but there is now firm DNA evidence that all the variants actually belong to the same species. It has also been recorded in Australia.

==Toxicity==
&quot;A. porphyria&quot; is not suitable for consumption. More importantly, it can easily be confused with much more poisonous species, such as the death cap &quot;Amanita phalloides&quot;.

<text>The Gbadolite Agreement, signed on December 31, 2002, in Gbadolite, Democratic Republic of the Congo, attempted unsuccessfully to end the Second Congo War. The signatories, all of which were supported by the Ugandan government, are the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), the Rally for Congolese Democracy-National (RCD-N) and the Rally for Congolese Democracy-Liberation Movement (RCD-ML).

The parties agreed to a ceasefire in the Isiro-Bafwasende-Beni-Watsa quadrangle and to immediately accept United Nations military observers in the area. It also contained guarantees of the freedom of movement of the civilian population and humanitarian organizations from one area to another.

As with previous treaties the Gbadolite Agreement failed to end the war.

<text>The United States Civil Service Commission was a government agency of the federal government of the United States. It was created to select employees of federal government on merit rather than relationships. In 1979, it was dissolved as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978; the Office of Personnel Management and the Merit Systems Protection Board are the successor agencies.

== History ==
On March 3, 1871, President Ulysses S. Grant signed into law the first U.S. civil service reform legislation, which had been passed by Congress. The act created the United States Civil Service Commission, that was implemented by President Grant and funded for two years by Congress lasting until 1874. However, Congress which relied heavily on patronage, especially the Senate, did not renew funding of the Civil Service Commission. President Grant&#x27;s successor, President Rutherford B. Hayes requested a renewal of funding but none was granted.

President Hayes&#x27; successor, James A. Garfield, advocated Civil Service reform. His efforts against the spoils system, also known as patronage, were cut short after he was assassinated by Charles J. Guiteau.

=== Pendleton law ===
President Garfield&#x27;s successor, President Chester A. Arthur, took up the cause of Civil Service reform and was able to lobby Congress to pass the Pendleton Civil Service Reform Act in 1883. The Pendleton law was passed in part following a public outcry over the assassination of President Garfield. The Pendleton Act renewed funding for the Civil Service Commission and established a three-man commission to run Civil Service whose commissioners were chosen by President Arthur. The Civil Service Commission administered the civil service of the United States federal government. The Pendleton law required certain applicants to take the civil service exam in order to be given certain jobs; it also prevented elected officials and political appointees from firing civil servants, removing civil servants from the influences of political patronage and partisan behavior. President Arthur and succeeding Presidents continued to expand the authority of the Civil Service Commission and federal departments that the Civil Service was covered. The Civil Service Commission, in addition to reducing patronage, also alleviated the burdensome task of the President of the United States in appointing federal office seekers.

Under the Commission Model, policy making and administrative powers were given to semi-independent commission rather than to the president. Reformers believed that a commission formed outside of the president’s chain of command would ensure that civil servants would be selected on the basis of merit system and the career service would operate in a politically neutral fashion. Civil Service Commissions typically consisted of three to seven individuals appointed by the chief executive on a bipartisan basis and for limited terms. Commissioners were responsible for direct administration of personnel system, including rule-making authority, administration of merit examinations, and enforcement of merit rules.

=== 1953 Executive Order ===
On April 27, 1953, President Eisenhower issued Executive Order 10450, which banned gay men and lesbians from working for any agency of the federal government, including the United States Civil Service Commission. It was not until 1973 that a federal judge ruled that a person&#x27;s sexual orientation alone could not be the sole reason for termination from federal employment, and not until 1975 that the United States Civil Service Commission announced that they would consider applications by gays and lesbians on a case by case basis.

=== 1978 reorganization ===
Effective January 1, 1978, functions of the commission were split between the Office of Personnel Management and the Merit Systems Protection Board under the provisions of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978 &quot;(43 F.R. 36037, 92 Stat. 3783)&quot; and the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978. In addition, other functions were placed under jurisdiction of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the Federal Labor Relations Authority (FLRA) and the Office of Special Counsel (OSC).

<text>Deadline is a British comics magazine published between 1988 and 1995.

Created by &quot;2000 AD&quot; artists Brett Ewins and Steve Dillon, &quot;Deadline&quot; featured a mix of comic strips and written articles aimed at adult readers. &quot;Deadline&quot; sat at the forefront of the wave of British comics anthologies for mature audiences that included &quot;Crisis&quot;, &quot;Revolver&quot; and &quot;Toxic!&quot;, and had a cultural influence beyond the comics world, most notably via its breakout star Tank Girl. &quot;Deadline&quot; was published by Deadline Publications Ltd.

==History==
The magazine&#x27;s origins lie in the earlier publication &quot;Strange Days&quot;, an anthology title created by Ewins, Brendan McCarthy and Peter Milligan.

Much of the non-strip content centred on alternative and indie music. Coupled with the subversive nature of many of the comic strips, the magazine had a distinctive counterculture ethos and post-punk sensibility.

The magazine was owned and financed by Tom Astor (grandson of Nancy Astor), and initially edited by Steve Dillon and Brett Ewins before transferring editorship to Dave Elliott, then Si Spencer and finally Frank Wynne (a former staff member of &quot;Crisis&quot; and subsequently translator of Michel Houellebecq). Alongside original material, Elliott and Wynne also introduced reprints of American alternative comics such as &quot;Love and Rockets&quot;, Bob Burden&#x27;s Flaming Carrot and Evan Dorkin strips such as &quot;Milk and Cheese&quot;. Elliott also arranged for content from the magazine to be reprinted in the US by Dark Horse Comics as &quot;Deadline USA&quot;.

&quot;Deadline&quot; enjoyed the patronage of those who would not normally purchase comics and the support of several key bands of the time, with Blur making regular appearances in the &quot;Tank Girl&quot; strips (&quot;Tank Girl&quot; artist Jamie Hewlett was good friends with Blur&#x27;s Damon Albarn), and covers including Ride, Curve, Carter USM and the Senseless Things. However, the commercial failure of the &quot;Tank Girl&quot; film and the crossing over of the alternative scene into the mainstream (around the time of Britpop, a movement it had helped to champion) saw the magazine eventually fold at the end of 1995.

In the late 2000s, Alan Grant edited the title &quot;Wasted&quot;, which owed much to the style and ethos of &quot;Deadline&quot; a decade and a half earlier.

<doc id="1086390" wikidata="Q1026874" url="?curid=1086390" title="Hanstholm">
<text>Hanstholm is a small town and a former island, now elevated area in Thisted municipality of Region Nordjylland, located in northern Denmark. The population of the town is 2,085 (1 January 2024).

==Etymology==
The former island Hanstholm (short form of the original name Hansted Holm) has many placenames, including Hansted, Nørby, Gårddal, Ræhr, Hamborg, Bjerre, Febbersted, Krog, Nytorp and Vigsø. In the beginning of the second millennium, churches were built in Vigsø, Ræhr and Hansted, forming three parishes.

At the end of the 20th century, Denmark&#x27;s largest harbour was built in Hansted, and a 10-fold larger harbour town was needed. A new town was planned, covering the places Hansted, Gårddal and Nørby, and the new town was officially named Hanstholm. This has led to some confusion, because the people from the towns Ræhr and Vigsø live on Hanstholm (the former island), they live in Hanstholm postal district, they live in Hanstholm municipality, but they don&#x27;t live in Hanstholm town.

However, since all the parts of this new harbour town belong to Hansted parish, and because Hansted has been the harbour town for so many centuries, many people refer to this town simply as Hansted instead of Hanstholm.

Besides Hanstholm and Hansted, one more name is related to this, Hanherred:

* Hansted means &quot;The place of Han&quot;. This suffix is often used with town names in Denmark.
* Hanstholm means &quot;The island of Hansted&quot;.
* Hanherred means &quot;The herred of Han&quot;, where herred is an old-age administrative division.

==Geography==

To the north is Vigsø Bay (‘’Vigsø Bugt’’) a part of Skagerrak. To the west is the North Sea.

The ferry MV Norröna of Smyril Line operated a weekly summer service to the Faroe Islands and Iceland from Hanstholm until 2010. This service now departs from Hirtshals.

The northern part of Denmark is rising because of plate tectonics, and has lifted the island of Hanstholm out of the water so that it is no longer an island, but an elevated area. You can still see two old farms: Bådsgård, which means boat farm, is located on the previous island Hanstholm; Færgegård, which means ferry farm, is located in Sårup towards Hansted. Today you can simply drive between Sårup and Hansted.

==Urban planning==

As Hansted&#x27;s population grew from a couple of hundred to several thousand people during the 20th century, some urban planning was applied. It seems to have been modelled in the same way as other growing Danish towns in the 1960s, which basically means that you can drive through the city without noticing the size of it.

Most shopping is concentrated in a shopping mall (Hanstholm Centret), and there are separate pedestrian and bicycle paths covering most of the city.

==History==
===Prehistoric===
Several excavations have shown that the Hanstholm area was inhabited by farmers as early as 1000 B.C.

===Teutons===
In the year 120 B.C., teutons inhabited the area, but left in a large exodus, together with the Cimbri, towards the south, where they encountered the Romans.

===Age of the Vikings===
In the years 800 to 1050, Hanstholm and the area around it were islands, and nearby was the gathering point for the Vikings for their invasions of England and France.

===First Christianity===
According to legend, the first Christian church in the Thy area was built in 1040 in Vestervig, where Christian priests coming from England entered Denmark. A big monastery was later built here and this was the beginning of the end of the Viking era.

The churches in Ræhr, Hansted and Vigsø were built in the 12th century in Roman style, and on Hansted church, one of the stones shows the picture of a trading vessel. This trading vessel has been used as model for the arms of the former Hanstholm municipality.

===Norwegian trade===
From approximately 1600 to approximately 1850, people from the area of Hanstholm traded considerably with Norway, which was a part of Denmark at that time, with special boats across the Skagerrak. They exported food, mostly grain, and imported logs. There were no trees in the whole area, so wood was in high demand. The primary harbours for this trade were Vigsø and Klitmøller, the latter because they had water mills to produce flour.

For this trade, special ships were designed, named &#x27;sandskuder&#x27;, meaning &#x27;sand boats&#x27;. They were able to sail directly onto the beach and were designed for the transport of grain, flour and logs.

===Sand drift===
A lot of sand began to drift from the west coast towards the east in the 14th century. In 1555, the sand drift had damaged a large area of Vigsø parish, and the local pastor suggested the abandonment of both the parish and the church. However, people stayed in the area, and the parish remained active. The other parishes were hit hard as well, and in 1690 there were dunes on the pastor&#x27;s fields, more than 12 metres high.

Numerous attempts to stop the sand drift finally succeeded in the 19th century by the planting of trees and lyme grass. However, many low coastal areas between the former islands had already been covered with dunes. South of Hanstholm, a unique dune landscape of approximately 4,000 hectares has become a wildlife reservation, named Hansted Reservat.

===Hanstholm Lighthouse 1843===
The lighthouse was initially built in 1842, but the construction was too weak, so it had to be torn down and rebuilt in 1843. It was the first lens-based lighthouse in Denmark. When it was electrified in 1889, it became the strongest lighthouse in Denmark, and still is today, even though the light intensity has been lowered. In a period of its life, it was also the strongest lighthouse in the world. The lighthouse was automated in 1970, and in 1979 the buildings associated with the lighthouse were converted to a museum about the nature and history of the surrounding area.

From the top of the lighthouse, 65 metres above the ocean, you can see the entire area.

===World War II===

During the Second World War, the citizens of Hansted were removed and Europe&#x27;s biggest fortress was built by the Germans in this area. Large 38 cm. naval guns were installed, that could shoot almost half the distance to Norway, in order to block allied entry into the Kattegat and thus the Baltic Sea. Similar cannons were installed in Kristiansand in Norway. Thousands of bunkers were constructed in the area. After the war it was too dangerous to blow them away and the bunkers themselves were too solid to remove in other ways. Therefore, most bunkers still remain in the ground, and some can even be seen on beaches or in the water, where the ocean has moved the coastline (the coastline moved, but the bunkers did not). Only a few bunkers lying in the way of road constructions have later been blown up using a special method of filling them with water before the explosion. A museum in Hanstholm gives access to the central parts of this World War II fortress.

After the war, many conifers were planted in order to provide shelter against the wind and in order to hide the German concrete constructions (ref. SkovOgNatur brochure).

The conifers are now slowly being replaced by broadleaf trees, which are more natural to area.

===The Municipal reform of 2007===
As a result of the Municipal reform of 2007, Hanstholm Municipality ceasted to exist on 1 January 2007, when it was merged with Thisted and Sydthy municipalities to form the new Thisted Municipality.

==Port of Hanstholm==

Hanstholm is located on the northern edge of a salt dome, and this edge consists of very hard chalk, which is the reason that ice age erosion did not remove these formations. Because the ocean streams in this area prevent the ocean from freezing, and because of Hanstholm&#x27;s geographic location, it is the perfect place for an industrial harbour, open all year.

In 1917, the Danish Parliament decided by law to build a harbour in Hanstholm. However, this was delayed by numerous incidents, including the low grants in the 1930s, and even though the Germans had plans to use the harbour as part of their strategy when they occupied Denmark in the Second World War, they stopped all construction in June 1943, removed all machines and blew up the buildings on the beach.

After the Second World War, a political struggle began to complete the harbour&#x27;s construction, but the other harbours in Denmark feared this. But the passing of a new law on 29 April 1960 finally led to the harbour&#x27;s completion. It opened in 1967 and today is one of the largest harbours in Denmark.

Fjord Line ferries sailed from Hanstholm until autumn 2008 to Western Norway (Egersund, Haugesund and Bergen). Fjord Line&#x27;s fast ferry Fjord Cat to Kristiansand sailed from the harbour (ex-MasterCat and Mads Mols) until October 2009.

Previously there has also been a ferry service to the Faroe Islands and Iceland from Hanstholm with the ferry Norröna owned by the Faroese shipping company Smyril Line. But in the autumn of 2010, after almost 20 years of regular ferry service to and from the Faroe Islands and Iceland, the shipping company Smyril Line unexpectedly chose to stop all of its operations to and from Hanstholm. Instead it moved all Danish operations to the Port of Hirtshals approximately 140 km north of Hanstholm.

With the loss of the ferry service to the Faroe Islands and Iceland, Hanstholm also lost its last ferry connection to and from the city, but there are still on-going attempts to establish new ferry routes to the city, and at the same time try to get some of the old ferry routes back to the port of Hanstholm.

==Museums==

There are two museums in Hanstholm, one of which enables visitors to go down into the World War II bunkers, see how the soldiers lived, drive the ammunition train from ammunition depots to the cannons, and get an impression of how huge they were.

<text>Itri is a small city and &quot;comune&quot; the province of Latina, Lazio, central Italy.

Itri is an agricultural centre divided in two parts by a small river, the Pontone. It lies in a valley between the Monti Aurunci and the sea, not far from the Gulf of Gaeta. The more ancient part, with the Castle, was partly destroyed during World War II.

The &quot;Itrani&quot; speak a particular variant of the Neapolitan language called &quot;Itrano&quot;.

==History==
The first direct documentary record of Itri dates to 914, but settlements in the neighbourhood existed from prehistoric times, as proved by findings from the Neolithic and the Bronze Ages.

According to legend, Itri&#x27;s origins appear to coincide with the destruction of Amyclae, a maritime city founded by the twin sons of Zeus, Castor and Pollux, whose Spartan followers clashed with Aeneas. The Greek colony was most likely on the coast at about north of Fondi. Amyclae was founded between Lake Fondi and the Terracina coast, on the edge of the murky waters of the swamps present at the time. The quiet Amyclaeans were plagued by the cursed and numerous evil forces of the swamp, unstoppable beings such as the monstrous serpent with nine heads, the Lernaean Hydra, which attacked with poisonous venom, and whose heads would re-grow as quickly as Hercules could slice them off with his sword. The city of Amyclae was soon annihilated. The few survivors abandoned the city and relocated a few kilometers south to the area now known as Itri. These first inhabitants of Itri supposedly adopted the emblems of the &quot;Signum Salutis&quot;, a serpent, as their symbol of power, and &quot;Amycleus&quot;, the dog&#x27;s head, as their symbol of fidelity.

More likely, Itri was probably a town or outpost of the Aurunci, later conquered and assimilated by the Romans.

The name Itri derives from the Latin word &quot;iter&quot;, meaning &quot;route&quot; or &quot;way&quot;, appropriate since the city lies where the old Roman Via Appia, built in 312 BC, crosses the Monti Aurunci by way of a narrow pass, the Gola di Sant&#x27;Andrea, called by Charles Dickens a &quot;noble mountain pass&quot;. An alternative hypothesis on the origin of the town&#x27;s name suggest it derived from the cult of the Eastern God Mithra, as there is a large subterranean temple dedicated to him a few hundred meters south of the town. Still another suggestion is that it derives from the Greek for snake &quot;hydra&quot;, pronounced in some dialects as &quot;itra&quot;. In Roman times Itri would have been no more than a post station, a role it continued in until well into the nineteenth century; in Bourbon times Itri was the 12th of 18 posting stations going south from Rome to Naples.

In the Middle Ages the population grew, and three lines of walls were built to protect the people living around the castle. Itri was part of the duchy of Gaeta and was a possession of the Dell&#x27;Aquila family, dukes of Fondi. In modern times Itri was part of the Kingdom of Naples.

Due to its location on the Gola di Sant&#x27;Andrea, Itri has historically been the scene of much military activity and a number of important battles. Perhaps the most famous occurred in 1503 when Consalvo of Cordova defeated the French army under the command of the Duke of Nemours, an action known as the Battle of the Garigliano.

During World War II, Allied bombing destroyed 75 percent of the city edifices.


==Main sights==
* The Castle, which commands all the neighbouring valley. It has a square tower merloned wall, attributed to Duke Docibilis I of Gaeta (882), to which his grandson Marinus II added a polygonal tower. A third tower, nicknamed &quot;del Coccodrillo&quot; (&quot;Crocodile&quot;) is site in a lower position, directly over Via Appia. A third line of wall is from the mid-13th century.
* The church of &quot;San Michele Arcangelo&quot; (11th century), in Arabic-Norman style.
*The 12th-century bell tower of the destroyed church of St. Maria Maggiore, with Byzantine art-style decorations.
*The Sanctuary of the Madonna della Civita is located from the city on a mountain once devoted to the Roman God Mercury with a splendid panorama. It houses a holy image of the Virgin, which, according to the legend, was painted by St. Luke. It was crowned here by Pope Pius VI, and again by Pius IX in 1877. King Ferdinand II of Naples visited the place in 1849.
*The Fortress of Sant&#x27;Andrea was built in the first century BC on the remains of an ancient Roman villa, located along the Old Via Appia in the direction of Fondi. This fortress was used by Fra Diavolo during the defensive operations against the French in 1798.
*The Church of &quot;Santa Maria di Loreto&quot; is located on a hill northeast from the center of the town. It is connected to the convent of the Cappuccini order. The painting of the Madonna of Loreto, created by 18th century Neapolitan artist Sarnelli, hangs above the church&#x27;s altar.

==Patron saint==
The &quot;Madonna della Civita&quot; is the patron saint of the town; her feast is celebrated on July 21.

Popular tradition narrates that the sacred painting representing the image of the Madonna was found in the 8th century by a deaf and mute shepherd, who was looking for a missing cow on Mount Civita. Upon discovering the painting, the mute shepherd fell to his knees, prayed, and miraculously was able to hear and speak for the first time in his life. He went back to the town to share his discovery with the Itrani, who were shocked and amazed to witness that the shepherd could now hear and speak.

The origin of the painting appears to be dated back to the 8th century, when the Byzantine Emperor Leo III ordered religious persecutions and banned the cult of sacred images.

==People==

*Michele Pezza (Fra Diavolo)
*Pope Urban VI
*Paolo Burali d&#x27;Arezzo

==Culture==

* On March 19 of each year, the people of Itri celebrate the feast of Saint Joseph (&quot;Festa di San Giuseppe&quot;), patron of the carpenters. The festivity is tied to a secular tradition, and on that night very large bonfires are ignited, around which people dance around, sing and prepare the traditional “zeppole di San Giuseppe”, a traditional fried dough made with sugar, eggs and coated with honey.
* The day of Corpus Domini (60 days after Easter), Itri celebrates &quot;L&#x27;Infiorata&quot;. An entire main street of the town, the via della Repubblica, is covered with a variety of different colored flower petals, used to reproduce sacred images and images of the town itself, such as the castle and its churches. At the end of the day, the religious procession passes over the floral masterpieces.
* The Feast of the &quot;Madonna della Civita&quot; is Itri&#x27;s main attraction, celebrated typically on three consecutive days, July 20, 21 and 22. This is often an occasion for Itri&#x27;s emigrants to return to their hometown. The 3-day feast is celebrated with religious processions, people walking up and down via Civita Farnese among amusement rides and hundreds of stands selling just about anything. Each night culminates with the performance of singers (with the most famous one performing on the last night of the celebrations) and spectacular fireworks.
*: The neighborhood of Knightsville, Cranston, Rhode Island in the United States also celebrates this holiday because many immigrants from Itri moved there.
* On the first Sunday of August, Itri celebrates the most important product of its economy, the olive. The feast known as the &quot;Sagra dell&#x27;Ulivo&quot; is celebrated with oil (on bruschetta) and olive tastings. Folkloristic groups also sing and dance in the main piazza. Itri exports much of its olive oil and olives, under the denomination of &quot;Gaeta Olives&quot;. The product adopted the name of the more known nearby city because they were shipped from the seaport of Gaeta.
* Among the traditional dishes prepared in Itri are the &quot;Pasta e Fagioli &quot;(pasta with beans), Polenta with Sausage Ragu, Risotto with Porcini Mushrooms, Linguine with Asparagus, grilled, roasted or sauteed wild game (such as wild boar, jackrabbit, pheasant, quails, and other local wild birds), and the delicious Marzolino cheese (a sheep&#x27;s-milk cheese) made locally. Many of the dishes prepared with porcini, asparagus, truffles and wild game come from the remote woods of Itri&#x27;s own &quot;Campello&quot; location.

==Cultural references==

*The movie &quot;Two Women&quot; (&quot;La Ciociara&quot;) with Sofia Loren was filmed in Itri.
*The legendary Itrano combatant Michele Pezza was the inspiration for Daniel Auber&#x27;s 3-act opera &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot;, and the 1933 Laurel and Hardy film, &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brother&quot;.

<text>The Department of Public Safety of the State of Texas, commonly known as the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS), is a department of the state government of Texas. The DPS is responsible for statewide law enforcement and driver license administration. The Public Safety Commission oversees the DPS. However, under state law, the Governor of Texas may assume command of the department during a public disaster, riot, insurrection, formation of a dangerous resistance to enforcement of law, or to perform his constitutional duty to enforce law. The commission&#x27;s five members are appointed by the governor and confirmed by the Texas Senate, to serve without pay for staggered, six-year terms. The commission formulates plans and policies for enforcing criminal, traffic and safety laws, preventing and detecting crime, apprehending law violators, and educating citizens about laws and public safety.

The agency is headquartered at 5805 North Lamar Boulevard in Austin.

==History==

In March 1927, the &quot;License and Weight Division&quot; was formed to address the escalating problems of increased traffic, and the continual damages caused by large trucks on the narrow state roads. These new inspector positions were staffed by State Police units equipped with motorcycles, and would enforce motor vehicle laws and regulations. Concurrently, the Texas Rangers would continue to conduct the State&#x27;s law enforcement investigations.

In 1931, during the Great Depression, Texas and other states created a movement that sought to &quot;reform the administrative machinery, and to reduce the high cost of state government.&quot; The Texas Legislature enrolled Griffenhagen and Associates, &quot;specialists in public administration and finance who had worked on similar projects throughout the United States and Canada, to make a survey and act as consultants.&quot; The firm concluded that Texas&#x27; exceptional geographic size caused the Rangers and the License and Weight Division to struggle in providing adequate enforcement across the entire state. The firm also noted the State Highway Patrol&#x27;s inability to enforce felony charges, which burdened the Rangers with excessive enforcement responsibilities, when they were already overworked. Additionally, the firm negatively reported on the state of Texas utilizing the National Guard for law enforcement along the border. Recommendations were made to accumulate the necessary finances to create a state law enforcement agency. Four bureaus—Administration, State Police, Rangers, and Fire Prevention—were suggested to be created with the implementation of the new force.

The findings of Griffenhagen and Associates were ultimately unpopular across the state, and the Texas Senate created a committee to conduct its own survey of the State&#x27;s law enforcement. As a result of the committee findings, on January 24, 1935, Senate Bill 146 was introduced. The bill created a &quot;Department of Public Safety&quot; that housed both the Rangers and the State Highway Patrol within one collective organization. The bill received final approval on February 18, 1935, and was sent to the House before finally reaching a joint committee for final revisions. On May 3, 1935, the final bill was voted on and passed, but without two-thirds approval.

On August 10, 1935, the Texas Legislature created the Department of Public Safety, along with 103 other bills. The newly formed department became the new home for the Texas Rangers, The Highway Patrol, and the crime laboratory.

Although Governor James V. Allred created the DPS with the signing of Senate Bill 146, the Legislature was responsible for the selection of three civilians to serve as the &quot;Public Safety Commission&quot;. The three selected were: George W. Cottingham, Ernest R. Goens, and Albert Sidney Johnson. Consequently, the trio appointed Captain L.G. Phares as acting director, and Homer Garrison Jr. as assistant director of the new agency. Phares was replaced by Colonel Horace H. Carmichael, who served until his death on September 24, 1938. Homer Garrison Jr. became the third director on September 27, 1938, and continued on as director for nearly 30 years, until his death on May 7, 1968. Garrison made numerous enhancements to the department during his storied career, including improvements to the training curriculum, which was recognized by J. Edgar Hoover, director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
==Divisions==
DPS is divided into multiple divisions:
* Aircraft Operations
*Chief Auditor&#x27;s Office
*Crime Laboratory
*Crime Records
*Criminal Investigations
*Cyber Security
*Director&#x27;s Staff
*Drivers License
*Finance
*Highway Patrol
*Information Technology
*Infrastructure Operations
*Intelligence &amp; Counterterrorism
*Media and Communications Office
*Media and Government Relations
*Office of General Counsel
*Office of Inspector General
*Regulatory Services
* Texas Rangers
* Training Operations

===Infrastructure Operations Division===
The Infrastructure Operations Division oversees facility management, fleet operations, communications, strategy implementation, risk management, project management, asset management, mail operations, printing services, warehousing, supply chain distribution, and procurement for the department.

===Criminal Investigations Division===
In 2009, the Department of Public Safety created the Criminal Investigations Division (CID) as part of a major restructuring of the department. The CID consists of 700 members, including 573 commissioned officers and 129 civilian support personnel. The CID Assistant Director&#x27;s Office consists of the assistant director, deputy assistant director, an administrative major, and four civilian support personnel.

The CID is divided into four different sections, which are specialized by function:

* Gang Section
* Drug Section
* Special Investigative Section
* Investigative Support Section

The CID sections work together to prevent, suppress, and solve crime in cooperation with city, county, state, and federal law enforcement agencies. Multi-jurisdictional violations typically investigated by CID include terrorism, gang-related organized crime, illegal drug trafficking, motor vehicle theft, gambling, public corruption, fraud, theft, and counterfeit documents.

===Driver License Division===
The Driver License Division is responsible for the issuing and revocation of Texas driver licenses and identification cards.

===Texas Highway Patrol===

The Highway Patrol Division is the unit of the department most frequently seen by citizens. Uniformed troopers of the highway patrol are responsible for enforcing traffic and criminal law, usually in unincorporated areas, and serve as the uniformed Texas state police.

Troopers in the Highway Patrol Division also serve a capitol security role, as well as operating the DPS Bike Patrol, Motor Patrol, and Mounted Horse Patrol, all of which serve the Texas Capitol Complex in Austin.

===Intelligence and Counterterrorism Division===
The Intelligence and Counterterrorism Division (ICT) plays a leading role in the department&#x27;s goal of combating terrorism and organized crime.

ICT manages and operates the Texas Fusion Center, formerly called the Texas Joint Crime Information Center (TXJCIC), which serves as the centerpiece in establishing and maintaining a statewide information sharing network. Through the development, acquisition, analysis and dissemination of criminal intelligence information, the Texas Fusion Center supports criminal investigations across the state on a 24/7 basis. Texas Fusion Center personnel include non-commissioned analytical experts and a small number of commissioned officers. Also participating in the Texas Fusion Center are personnel from various other law enforcement and public safety agencies, such as Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department, Department of Homeland Security, Department of the Treasury, Federal Bureau of Investigation, Drug Enforcement Administration, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and Air and Army National Guard. ICT analysts also work at other regional fusion and intelligence centers located throughout Texas.

ICT also oversees security at DPS headquarters and the Texas Capitol Complex, a 46 square block area in downtown Austin. The Capitol Complex includes the State Capitol, state office buildings, parking lots and garages, and private office buildings. Security at the Capitol Complex is the responsibility of ICT&#x27;s Capitol District, which is charged with protecting state property and buildings, and providing a safe environment for state officials, employees, and the general public. The Capitol District provides total police service within the Capitol Complex, including traffic enforcement, parking enforcement, and criminal investigations.

===Texas Rangers===

Arguably the most well-known division of the DPS is the Texas Ranger Division, also known as . The Texas Rangers are responsible for state-level criminal investigations, among other duties. The Texas Ranger Division consists of 166 sworn Rangers.

===Mounted Horse Patrol Unit===
The unit was established in 2014 to patrol the State Capitol Complex. The MHPU is a component of the THP Division, and functions in coordination with other patrol units within the Capitol Region and other law enforcement agencies. The mission of the MHPU is to enhance community policing efforts, have positive interactions with community members and visitors to the Capitol Complex, suppress civil disturbances, and deter terrorism and criminal activity.

==2010 corruption investigation==

* In 2010, Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) Trooper Mark DeArza, 39, of Houston, and DPS clerk Lidia Gutierrez, 37, of Galena Park, Texas, were convicted of conspiring to sell Texas driver&#x27;s licenses to unqualified applicants for a fee after pleading guilty to the charge before United States District Judge Gray Miller. According to the FBI public record of the case, the FBI learned through a confidential source of information (CS) that the operator of a Conoco station located on Almeda-Genoa Street in Houston was allegedly selling Texas driver&#x27;s licenses for a fee. On two separate occasions, first on May 14, 2010, then again on July 26, the CS met with the operator of the gasoline station, and allegedly paid him $3000 for assistance in obtaining a Texas driver&#x27;s license, and $3500 for assistance with obtaining a commercial driver&#x27;s license for a friend. In the first instance, the CS was referred to and met with DeArza at the DPS office on May 17, 2010, and with his assistance and that of Gutierrez, obtained a Texas driver&#x27;s license which he was unauthorized to receive. In the second instance, the CS sought a commercial driver&#x27;s license for a friend. The CS allegedly paid $3500 for the arrangements to be made with DeArza and Gutierrez to obtain this driver&#x27;s license as well. On July 26, 2010, at the gasoline station, the CS received a temporary driver&#x27;s license personally delivered by DeArza. The CS later received both Texas driver&#x27;s licenses by United States mail. Maen Bittar, 46, of Houston, the operator of a Houston Conoco gas station, pleaded guilty before U.S. District Judge Gray Miller—admitting collecting fees from individuals, such as illegal aliens, in amounts of $3000 or more to arrange with DPS employees Mark DeArza, a DPS Trooper, and Lidia Gutierrez, a DPS clerk, to process applications and receive driver&#x27;s licenses for these unqualified individuals.
* In 2010, a Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS) trooper was sentenced to four years in prison for depriving multiple motorists of their civil rights, U.S. Attorney José Angel Moreno and Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights Thomas E. Perez announced. Michael Anthony Higgins (1967–2010), 42, formerly of the Corpus Christi area, was found guilty on January 13, 2010, by a jury&#x27;s verdict on all four counts of the indictment of willfully stealing money from motorists he stopped on the highway while working as a trooper. In addition to the four-year prison term, U.S. District Judge John D. Rainey ordered Higgins to pay $850 restitution, representing the money he took from the motorists, and will serve a one-year term of supervised release following completion of his prison term. Upon motion of the government, Judge Rainey ordered Higgins, previously released on bond, to be immediately remanded to the custody of the U.S. Marshals Service. Higgins was prosecuted for stopping motorists who appeared to be of Hispanic descent and stealing their money, usually in amounts of several hundred dollars. As a result of the civilian complaints, DPS, in conjunction with the Texas Rangers, initiated an undercover operation to investigate Higgins. An undercover police officer posed as a civilian of Hispanic descent with limited English language ability, and was issued several pre-recorded $100 bills. While being monitored by DPS aerial surveillance, the undercover officer drove past Higgins&#x27; duty area in Kleberg County, and was eventually stopped by Higgins. Upon making the traffic stop, Higgins asked the undercover officer for money in his possession, and then took the money behind the passenger side door of his police cruiser. After Higgins returned bills to the officer, the officer realized that some of the money was missing. Texas Rangers and DPS officers confronted Higgins and, upon inspection of the police cruiser, found two of the pre-recorded $100 bills secreted in the passenger side door pocket, which was next to the area where Higgins had gone to count the money. The case was investigated by the FBI, Texas Rangers, and Officers of the Texas DPS. The case was prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Ruben Perez of the U.S. Attorney Office for the Southern District of Texas, and Trial Attorney Jim Felte from the Civil Rights Division. Not long after being sentenced, Higgins died on April 29, 2010, at the age of 42, while incarcerated in the Coastal Bend Detention Center in Robstown, Texas. Complaining of chest pains the night before, Higgins collapsed, and CPR was performed before he was transported by emergency medical services to Calallen Hospital, where he later died. He was pronounced dead at 7:32 a.m.

==Organization==
The governing body of the Department of Public Safety is the Public Safety Commission, with all members being appointed by the Governor of Texas. The commission is responsible for appointing the director of the department. The director is assisted in managing the department by three deputy directors and multiple division chiefs. Most divisions report to the director through one of the three deputy directors.

The commission also appoints an inspector general to act as an inspector for the department, and a chief audit executive as part of the internal audit department known as the Chief Auditor&#x27;s Office, who are both independent of the director. The general counsel acts as the counsel for the commission and the department.

<text>Atlakviða (&quot;The Lay of Atli&quot;) is one of the heroic poems of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. One of the main characters is Atli who originates from Attila the Hun. It is one of the most archaic Eddic poems, possibly dating to as early as the 9th century. Owing to its stylistic similarity to &quot;Hrafnsmál&quot; it has been suggested that the poem might have been composed by Þorbjörn Hornklofi. It is preserved in the Codex Regius and the same story is related in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;. In the manuscript the poem is identified as Greenlandic but most scholars believe that this results from a confusion with &quot;Atlamál&quot;. The metre of the poem alternates irregularly between &quot;málaháttr&quot; and &quot;fornyrðislag&quot;. This may be an indication that two or more original poems have been merged or that the short and long lines were not felt as constituting two different metres at the time the poem was composed.

==Historical background==
&quot;Atlakviða&quot;&#x27;s subject relates to the historical interaction between Burgundians and Huns in the 5th century. The poem is the oldest surviving version of the legend about the visit of the Burgundian rulers to Atli&#x27;s court and the revenge of Guðrún. Ultimately derived from Burgundian heroic legend, the Scandinavian literature about the subject is believed to be based on either Low German models or Gothic poems that reached Scandinavia via the Baltic region.

Scholars date the composition of &quot;Atlakviða&quot; to around the year 900, which makes it one of the oldest lays of the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The 13th-century Codex Regius, in which the poem survives, says that it was written in Greenland, but the early composition date makes this implausible, since Greenland was not colonized until around 985. A Norwegian origin is considered likely. Due to stylistic similarities to the skaldic poem &quot;Hrafnsmál&quot;, the medievalist Felix Genzmer argued that &quot;Atlakviða&quot; was written by that poem&#x27;s author Þorbjörn Hornklofi in 872; it may at least have been inspired by &quot;Hrafnsmál&quot;. The metre in &quot;Atlakviða&quot; combines &quot;málaháttr&quot; and &quot;fornyrðislag&quot;, which together with stylistic variations also has led to suggestions that the poem was written by several authors. In the Scandinavian material, the same story is treated in a different way in the later poem &quot;Atlamál&quot; and retold in prose in the &quot;Völsunga saga&quot;.

==Synopsis==
Atli, king of the Huns, sends a messenger to Gunnarr, king of the Burgundians, and his younger brother Högni. The messenger says that Atli is inviting the brothers to his court and offering them great riches. The brothers are skeptical of the offer since they already have an exceedingly great treasure of gold. Confirming their suspicions is a ring sent by their sister Guðrún, Atli&#x27;s wife, with a wolf&#x27;s hair wrapped onto it. Atli obviously plans treachery but Gunnarr still decides to take up the offer, vowing that if he doesn&#x27;t return no-one will benefit from his riches.

As Gunnarr and Högni arrive at Atli&#x27;s court they meet Guðrún who tells them that they should not have come. Gunnarr is seized by Atli&#x27;s men while Högni fights and kills eight men before he is subdued. The Huns ask Gunnarr if he wants to ransom his life by telling them where he has hidden his gold. He tells them that he wants to see Högni&#x27;s heart. They first cut out the heart of a cowardly man named Hjalli and bring it to Gunnarr but he sees from the cowardly trembling of the heart who its owner was. Then they cut out Högni&#x27;s heart and he dies laughing. Gunnarr recognizes the heart of his brave brother but tells the Huns that now that he alone knows the location of the gold he can be certain that it will never be disclosed. The Huns then throw him into a snake pit where he dies playing a harp.

Guðrún prepares a banquet for Atli and his court. When the feast is well underway she tells Atli that he is actually eating the flesh of their two sons. Guðrún later kills the unattentive Atli in his bed, sets loose the hounds and awakens the housecarls she has bribed. Guðrún throws a burning twig into the hall and eventually Atli&#x27;s entire estate is set ablaze. All the people in the hall, Atli&#x27;s temple, the &quot;dwelling of the Buthlungs&quot; as well as shield-maidens are consumed by the fire.

==Themes and interpretations==
Gunnarr is shown to be heroic in his moment of defeat and the poet explicitly praises both his and Högni&#x27;s choices of action. The acceptance of Atli&#x27;s invitation in spite of clear danger can be understood as necessary in order to not be labeled a coward. The German studies scholar Carola L. Gottzmann interprets the visit as a reaction to Atli&#x27;s offer of gifts, which implies a demand of submission to the Hunnic king. The poet praises how Gunnarr ensures that his gold never will be found, which may be seen as contrary to the ethics of the Germanic lord-retainer system, where societal bonds were created through the generous distribution of wealth. The poem&#x27;s description of gold as a &quot;discord-metal of men&quot; () does however align with the &quot;Icelandic Rune Poem&quot;&#x27;s opening line, &quot;wealth is kinsmen&#x27;s discord&quot; ().

Guðrún is relentless in her need to avenge her brothers. Although the poem expresses horror when it portrays the consequences of her actions—filicide, unsuspecting cannibalism and the deaths of kings—there is no direct condemnation of her behaviour. Unlike in &quot;Guðrúnarhvöt&quot;, where Guðrún is angry at the Norns for making her kill her sons, &quot;Atlakviða&quot; only suggests sorrow once, in strophe 37, before strophe 38 says that she &quot;never wept&quot;. She kills Atli when he is in a defenseless state and unlike in &quot;Atlamál&quot;, he is not portrayed as a tyrannical husband. The final strophe (43) does stress that her actions led to the deaths of three kings. According to the medievalist Ursula Dronke, this might have been a later addition, but the strophe that precedes it also focuses on the deaths her actions caused. The heroic ethic of vengeance that overtakes Guðrún makes her monstrous, giving her an inhuman self-control which the poem&#x27;s author appears to find both horrific and admirable.

<text>Jabbo Smith (born Cladys Smith; December 24, 1908 – January 16, 1991) was an American jazz musician, known for his virtuoso playing on the trumpet.

==Biography==
Smith was born in Pembroke, Georgia, United States. At the age of six he went into the Jenkins Orphanage in Charleston, South Carolina where he learned trumpet and trombone, and by the age of 10 was touring with the Jenkins Band. At the age of 16 he had left the Orphanage to become a professional musician, at first playing in bands in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Atlantic City, New Jersey, before making his base in Manhattan, New York City, from about 1925 through 1928, where he made the first of his well regarded recordings.

From February to May 1928, Smith was featured in the band along with Fats Waller and James P. Johnson in the Waller/Andy Razaf Broadway musical and dance revue &quot;Keep Shufflin&quot;&#x27; which ran for 104 performances.

Later on in 1928 he toured with James P. Johnson&#x27;s Orchestra, when their show broke up in Chicago, Illinois, where Smith stayed for a few years. His series of 20 recordings for Brunswick Records in 1929 are his most famous (19 were issued), and Smith was billed as a rival to Louis Armstrong. Most of these records did not sell well enough for Brunswick to extend his contract.

In March 1935, in Chicago, Smith was featured in a recording session produced by Helen Oakley under the name of Charles LaVere &amp; His Chicagoans, which included a vocal by both Smith and LaVere on LaVere&#x27;s composition and arrangement of &quot;Boogaboo Blues&quot;. It is an early example of inter-racial blues recordings, although far from the first as such had been made at least since about 1921.

In the 1930s, Smith moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, which would be his main base for many years, alternating with returns to New York. In Milwaukee he collaborated with saxophonist Bill Johnson. Subsequently, Smith dropped out of the public eye, playing music part-time in Milwaukee with a regular job at an automobile hire company.

Smith made a comeback starting in the late 1960s, successfully playing with bands and shows in New York, New Orleans, Louisiana, London, and France through the 1970s and into the 1980s. He was one of the musicians in the musical &quot;One Mo’ Time&quot; about an African-American vaudeville in the 1920s. A recording with the original cast including Jabbo Smith was produced (Warner Bros Records WB 56850).

Concerts in France, Italy, Switzerland and Netherlands took place with Smith and the Hot Antic Jazz Band. They were recorded in concert in 1982, and the live album, &quot;Jabbo Smith and the Hot Antic Jazz Band: European Concerts&quot;, was released.

In January 1991, Jabbo Smith died in New York City, at the age of 82.

<text>Þrymskviða (Þrym&#x27;s Poem; the name can be anglicised as &quot;Thrymskviða&quot;, &quot;Thrymskvitha&quot;, &quot;Thrymskvidha&quot; or &quot;Thrymskvida&quot;) is one of the best known poems from the &quot;Poetic Edda&quot;. The Norse myth had enduring popularity in Scandinavia and continued to be told and sung in several forms until the 19th century.

==Synopsis==

In the poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, Thor wakes and finds that his powerful hammer, Mjöllnir, is missing. Thor turns to Loki first, and tells him that nobody knows that the hammer has been stolen. The two then go to the court of the goddess Freyja, and Thor asks her if he may borrow her feather cloak so that he may attempt to find Mjöllnir. Freyja agrees, saying she would lend it even if it were made of silver and gold, and Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling.

In Jötunheimr, the &quot;jötunn&quot; lord Þrymr sits on a burial mound, plaiting golden collars for his female dogs, and trimming the manes of his horses. Þrymr sees Loki, and asks what could be amiss among the Æsir and the Elves; why is Loki alone in the Jötunheimr? Loki responds that he has bad news for both the elves and the Æsir: that Thor&#x27;s hammer, Mjöllnir, was gone. Þrymr says that he has hidden Mjöllnir eight leagues beneath the earth, from which it will be retrieved if Freyja is brought to marry him. Loki flies off, the feather cloak whistling, away from Jötunheimr and back to the court of the gods.

Thor asks Loki if his efforts were successful, and that Loki should tell him while he is still in the air as &quot;tales often escape a sitting man, and the man lying down often barks out lies&quot;. Loki states that it was indeed an effort, and also a success, for he has discovered that Þrymr has the hammer, but that it cannot be retrieved unless Freyja is brought to marry Þrymr. The two return to Freyja, and tell her to dress herself in a bridal head dress, as they will drive her to Jötunheimr. Freyja, indignant and angry, goes into a rage, causing all of the halls of the Æsir to tremble in her anger, and her necklace, the famed Brísingamen, flies off of her. Freyja flatly refuses, saying that if she did (allow herself to mate a &quot;jötunn&quot;) that would make her the most man-crazed wench around.

As a result, the gods and goddesses meet and hold a Thing (Assembly) to discuss and debate the matter. At the Thing, the god Heimdallr puts forth the suggestion that, in place of Freyja, Thor should be dressed as the bride, complete with jewels, women&#x27;s clothing down to his knees, a bridal head-dress, and the necklace (or neck-ring) Brísingamen (and, arguably, another lower necklace covering the breast, though this is contested). Thor comments he would be ridiculed as a sissy) if he submits to the idea, but Loki (here described as &quot;son of Laufey&quot;) dissuades him saying that this will be the only way to get back Mjöllnir, and without Mjöllnir, the &quot;jötnar&quot; will overtake Asgard. The gods dress Thor as a bride, and Loki states that he will go with Thor as his handmaiden (or bridesmaid), and that the two shall drive to Jötunheimr together.

After riding together in Thor&#x27;s goat-driven chariot, the two, disguised, arrive in Jötunheimr. Þrymr commands the &quot;jötnar&quot; in his hall to spread straw on the benches, for Freyja has arrived to marry him. Þrymr recounts his treasured animals and treasures including many necklaces, stating that Freyja was all that he was missing in his wealth.

Early in the evening, the disguised Loki and Thor meet with Þrymr and the assembled &quot;jötnar&quot;. Thor eats and drinks ferociously, consuming entire animals and three casks of mead. Þrymr finds the behaviour at odds with his impression of Freyja, and Loki sitting there like a &quot;very shrewd maid&quot;, invents the excuse that &quot;Freyja&#x27;s&quot; behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. Þrymr then lifts &quot;Freyja&#x27;s&quot; veil and wants to kiss &quot;her&quot; until catching the terrifying eyes staring back at him, seemingly burning with fire. Loki states that this is because &quot;Freyja&quot; had not slept for eight nights in her eagerness.

The &quot;wretched sister&quot; of the &quot;jötnar&quot; appears, asks for gold [arm-]rings as bridal gifts from &quot;Freyja&quot;, and the &quot;jötnar&quot; bring out Mjöllnir to &quot;sanctify the bride&quot;, to lay it on her lap, and marry the two by &quot;the hand&quot; of the goddess Vár. Thor laughs internally when he sees the hammer, takes hold of it, strikes Þrymr, beats all of the jötnar, and kills the &quot;older sister&quot; of the &quot;jötnar&quot;.

==Dating==
There is no agreement among scholars on the age of &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;. Some have seen it as thoroughly heathen and among the oldest of the Eddaic poems, dating it to 900 AD. but this view is now in the minority.

A number of scholars, on the other hand, dates the poem to the first half of the 13th century, and collectively they have advanced four main reasons for the younger dating. Jan de Vries characterized the work to be a Christian-era parody of the heathen gods.

One basis of the older dating is the archaic language, in particular, the heavy use of the &quot;of&quot;/&quot;af&quot; particle, which is not addressed by some supporters of later dating, such as the Swedish scholar . Finnur Jónsson also argued there were some died-out pagan customs preserved in the poem, for example, the necklaces of the type hanging to the chest were no longer in style by the Christian era.

==Analysis==
The storyline is a prime example of the folktale motif ATU 1148b &quot;The Theft of the Thunder-Instrument&quot; (or &quot;Thunder&#x27;s Instrument&quot;), and also incorporates ATU 403c &quot;The Substituted Bride&quot;.

In other tales, Loki&#x27;s explanations for Thor&#x27;s behavior has its clearest analogies in the tale &quot;Little Red Riding Hood&quot;, where the wolf provides equally odd explanations for its differences from the grandmother than Little Red Riding Hood was expecting.

==Balladry==
There are versions of the story in ballad-form, composed during the medieval (or post-medieval) periods, in Danish, Swedish, Norwegian, and Icelandic. These are catalogued as TSB type E 126: i.e., the Danish &quot;Tord af Havsgaard&quot; (DgF 1), Swedish &quot;Tors hammarhämmtning&quot; (SMB 212), Norwegian &quot;Torekall&quot; (NMB 188), and the Icelandic &quot;rímur&quot; cycle &quot;Þrymlur&quot; (c. 1350–1450).

=== Danish ===
The various known redactions of the Danish ballad &quot;Tord af Havsgård&quot; (DgF 1) are subdivided into variant types 1A B Ca–c.

Version A has been translated as &quot;Thor of Asgard&quot; by Prior (1860), and as &quot;Thord of Hafsgaard&quot; by E. M. Smith-Dampier (1914). In Ballad 1A, &quot;Tord af Havsgård&quot; (tr. &quot;Thord of Hafsgaard&quot;) the title hero is riding over the green meadow, having lost his gold hammer for a long while, and the ballad proclaims (in the emended reading) &quot;so a man shall win a shrew (wildwoman)&quot;, explained by commentators as a jocular hint of Tord himself (or his &quot;old father&quot;) later having to dress up as a bride.

Tord tells his brother Lokke Leymand (or &quot;Jester&quot;) to go to Nørrefjeld (tr. &quot;Norrefield&quot;, &quot;Northland&quot;) to seek the hammer, and Lokke wears the (&quot;feather-skin&quot;) to fly there to the &quot;&quot;(, tr. &quot;Giant-King&quot;). The Giant-King reveals he has hidden the hammer 55 fathoms (15 and 40 fathoms) deep in the earth and will not return it, unless Tord and Lokke relinquish their sister (Fredens-borgh [sic.], normalized as Freiensborg, tr. &quot;Fredensborg&quot;) to become the giant&#x27;s wife. When Lokke brings home this proposition, his proud sister springs up from the bench and replies, &quot;Give me away to a Christian man, not some loathely troll&quot;, and she suggests they brush up the hair of &quot;our old father&quot; and pass him off as a maiden to send to Nørrefjeld. Although one should expect her to say &quot;our brother&quot;, it is clarified by commentators that &quot;Old Father&quot; is a commonplace nickname for a thunder deity, hence, Tord is really meant here as the person being dressed up as bride. There is a banquet, and as in the Eddic version, the cross-dressed bride shows enormous appetite devouring a whole ox and other foods. The appetite raises the giant&#x27;s suspicion and Lokke delivers an excuse (quite similar to the one in the Eddic poem). Now 8 champions bring the hammer borne on a tree, and places it on the bride&#x27;s knee; Tord wields the hammer as if it were a wand, and slays the &quot;&quot; (Giant-King).

=== Swedish ===
The Swedish ballad was recorded in the 17th century. In the Swedish ballad (version Ab, normalized spelling), Thor is called &quot;Torkar&quot;, Loki is called &quot;Locke Lewe&quot;, Freyja is called &quot;Frojenborg&quot; and Þrymr is called &quot;Trolletram&quot;.

While in the Danish Ballad the three god figures are presented as siblings, in the Swedish version, this relationship is removed or obfuscated. Torkar addresses Locke as &quot;&quot; (st. 2), meaning my &quot;hired servant&quot;. And the &quot;maiden Frojenborg&quot; (&quot;&quot;, st. 6) is demanded (see below), instead of &quot;your sister&quot; (, C ver., st. 7).

Trolletram has buried Torkar&#x27;s hammer &quot;fifteen fathoms and forty&quot; in the ground, and tells Locke to take the answer back to Torkar that &quot;His hammer he ne&#x27;er will see, / Until he sends Fröyenborg.. to me&quot;, i.e., the &quot;maiden Frojenborg&quot;. 

=== Norwegian ===
The Norwegian version &quot;Torekall&quot; has been translated into English under the title &quot;Thorekarl of Asgarth&quot;.

== Opera ==
The first full-length Icelandic opera, Jón Ásgeirsson&#x27;s &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, was premiered at Iceland&#x27;s National Theater in 1974. The libretto is based on the text of the poem &quot;Þrymskviða&quot;, but also incorporates material from several other Eddic poems.

==Icelandic statue==

A seated bronze statue of Thor (about 6.4 cm) known as the Eyrarland statue from about AD 1000 was recovered at a farm near Akureyri, Iceland and is a featured display at the National Museum of Iceland. Thor is holding Mjöllnir, sculpted in the typically Icelandic cross-like shape. It has been suggested that the statue is related to a scene from &quot;Þrymskviða&quot; where Thor recovers his hammer while seated by grasping it with both hands during the wedding ceremony.

<doc id="1086407" wikidata="Q5506785" url="?curid=1086407" title="The Invasion of Time">
<text>The Invasion of Time is the sixth and final serial of the 15th season of the British science fiction television series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, which was first broadcast in six weekly parts on BBC1 from 4 February to 11 March 1978. It features the final appearance of Louise Jameson as the companion Leela.

In the serial, the Vardans break the defences of Gallifrey to allow the Sontarans to invade and control the power of the Time Lords.

==Plot==
To the confusion of Leela and K9, the Fourth Doctor has a covert meeting with aliens before taking his companions to the Citadel at Gallifrey. Once there, he lays claim to the vacant Presidency as his right by Time Lord law—he is the only candidate, as established in the story &quot;The Deadly Assassin&quot;. While reviewing the presidential suite, he orders it lined with lead. During his induction ceremony, the Crown of Rassilon seems to reject him, and he&#x27;s injured. Leela is accused of having attacked him, when in fact she tried to help him, and she&#x27;s banished from the Citadel. Later, in front of the gathered Time Lords, the Doctor greets three figures that materialise within the Citadel, the Vardans, whom he had met before coming to Gallifrey, and addresses them as the Time Lords&#x27; new masters. Amid the confusion, the compliant Castellan Kelner kowtows to the Vardans and assists them in taking over, issuing arrests and ordering banishment for any Time Lords that he sees as disloyal. The Doctor confides in Chancellor Borusa, once they&#x27;re in his lead-lined suite, that the Vardans can read their thoughts but lead blocks this. The Doctor plans to lock the Vardans in a time lock on their home planet as they are a dangerous race, but needed to keep up this facade in order to determine the location of their homeworld, and banished Leela for her own safety. The Doctor later explains the same to the Citadel guard commander Andred, using a force field from the TARDIS to shield his thoughts, to gain his help.

Meanwhile, Leela has faith that the Doctor&#x27;s actions are towards a larger goal, and along with the banished Time Lady Rodan, travel across the wastelands of Gallifrey. They meet a group of outsiders that have abandoned Time Lord ways, led by Nesbin. Leela explains the situation at the Citadel, and Nesbin agrees to help, assembling a resistance force to help take the Citadel back.

When Kelner and the Vardans accuse the Doctor of being untrustworthy, he offers to show his commitment by dismantling the quantum forcefield that surrounds Gallifrey, which would allow the Vardans&#x27; full invasion force to arrive. However, the Doctor tricks them, and only creates a small hole in the forcefield, large enough for K9 to trace the Vardans to their home planet and engage the time lock, causing the Vardans to disappear. The situation seems resolved but moments later, a squad of Sontaran warriors transport into the Citadel. Their leader, Commander Stor, explains they had used the Vardans to help disable the forcefield, and seizes control of the Citadel. While Kelner quickly aligns with the Sontarans, the Doctor, Borusa, and their allies escape, regrouping with Leela, Rodan, Nesbin, and the other outsiders. Leela joins Andred to help defend the Citadel with the combined resistance group and Citadel guards, while Rodan repairs the hole in the forcefield. The Doctor wants the Great Key of Rassilon, but there is no record of it. He deduces that Rassilon gave the key to the first chancellor and that its location has been handed down from chancellor to chancellor ever since. He convinces Borusa to give it to him, which he plans to use to power a Demat Gun, a weapon that erases its target from all of time. Stor learns of this and orders a squad of Sontarans to give chase in the Doctor&#x27;s TARDIS with assistance from Kelner. The Doctor is able to elude them within the labyrinthine corridors of the TARDIS, and with Rodan and K9&#x27;s help, constructs the Demat Gun. He goes out into the Citadel to find Stor, who is attempting to destroy the entire galaxy, including Stor and the Sontaran fleet, with a bomb. The Doctor fires the Demat Gun, and the Sontaran invaders disappear, ending the threat. When he awakes, the Doctor remembers nothing of the events, and Borusa calls it the &quot;wisdom of Rassilon&quot;, as he can return the key to its hiding place. He then has Kelner arrested for treason and starts the process of rebuilding the Citadel.

As the Doctor prepares to leave, Leela announces she plans to stay behind with Andred, as they have found a romantic interest in each other, and K9 also insists he must stay to help Leela. After saying his goodbyes, the Doctor enters the TARDIS, pulls out a large crate labelled &quot;K9 MII&quot;.

==Production==
The script is credited to David Agnew, a pseudonym often used by the BBC for work produced &quot;in house&quot; by contracted production team members. On this occasion it masks the authors Anthony Read (the series&#x27; script editor) and Graham Williams (series producer). This story was written as a replacement for another story, &quot;The Killers of the Dark&quot; by David Weir, which was considered too expensive and complex to shoot. The script was written in just two weeks, with four days for rewrites. Additionally, when asked about the unused script at a convention, Graham Williams, having forgotten the exact title, made up the name &quot;Gin Sengh&quot;, as in &quot;The Killer Cats of Gin Sengh&quot; (or &quot;Geng Singh&quot;—the spelling being indeterminate), resulting in the fan myth that this was the original title. It was Robert Holmes who suggested to Graham Williams that this story be split into two segments, the first four episodes being based around the Vardans and the final two episodes being based around the Sontarans who come into the story at the end of episode 4.

Louise Jameson, who had already announced her departure from the show, reportedly wished for her character, Leela, to be killed at the end of the series, and was disappointed that Leela instead opted to stay behind on Gallifrey with Andred, even though nothing in the script suggests a romance between the two characters. The producers decided that killing off her character would be too traumatic for younger viewers.

An industrial strike, which was eventually resolved before production, forced the studio sets to be constructed within St Anne&#x27;s Hospital in Redhill as the BBC&#x27;s Christmas holiday specials were given priority in the regular studios. As a result of the industrial strike, Graham Williams was given the option of not producing the final six episodes of the season and have the money rollover into the next season. Williams rejected this because of the additional problem of inflation that year and didn&#x27;t want the budgeted money to depreciate even further.

In addition to St Anne&#x27;s Hospital, location filming also took place at British Oxygen, Hammersmith and Beachfields quarry in Redhill, Surrey.

The Sontaran costumes were cumbersome and limited the field of vision of the actors wearing them, so much so that they are often seen tripping through and over props. At one point, a Sontaran (played by the actor Stuart Fell) nearly takes a fall after missing a short jump and landing on a pool chair. As the aliens originate on a planet of notably high gravity, however, their clumsiness is easily explained.

The closing credits of episodes three, four, and six feature the return of the section of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; theme commonly called the &quot;Middle Eight&quot;, this sequence not having been heard since the early Jon Pertwee era.

===Cast notes===
Milton Johns had previously appeared as Benik in &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; (1967–68) and Guy Crayford in &quot;The Android Invasion&quot; (1975). Christopher Tranchell had previously played Roger Colbert in &quot;The Massacre of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Eve&quot; (1966) and Jenkins in &quot;The Faceless Ones&quot; (1967).

==Analysis==
Writer and journalist Matthew Sweet has compared the Doctor&#x27;s strategy of feigning madness in this story to &quot;Hamlet&quot;.

==Broadcast and reception==
Following transmission of the story, producer Graham Williams met with Head of Serials Graeme MacDonald, and they agreed that the story had contained too high a level of humour, resulting in a lack of credibility in Stor, and a lack of dramatic tension, and that in future any humour in the programme should counterpoint and strengthen the story rather than undermine and weaken it. Memos to this effect were to be issued to future directors of the show, in order to preserve a level of seriousness that both men felt to be necessary; however, the humorous trend continued until Williams&#x27; tenure came to an end in 1979.

Paul Cornell, Martin Day, and Keith Topping wrote in &quot;The Discontinuity Guide&quot; (1995) that the serial &quot;stands up reasonably well&quot;, though the Vardans&#x27; appearances were &quot;ludicrous&quot;. In &quot;The Television Companion&quot; (1998), David J. Howe and Stephen James Walker wrote that the story was &quot;something of a mess&quot;. Although there were good special effects, they stated it had a lack of good characters, found Baker&#x27;s performance to be &quot;below par&quot;, and criticised the &quot;pathetic&quot; Vardans. In 2010, Mark Braxton of &quot;Radio Times&quot; was also disappointed, finding many &quot;inept sequences&quot;. He also criticised the way Leela was written in the serial, as well as her sudden departure. DVD Talk&#x27;s John Sinnott was more positive, giving the serial four out of five stars. He acknowledged that it was &quot;a flawed and uneven adventure&quot; with issues in plot logic, but it succeeded in &quot;goofy fun&quot; with a good performance by Baker. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 listed the cliffhanger to Episode Two—in which it appears the Doctor is evil—as one of the greatest cliffhangers in the history of the programme in 2010.

<doc id="1086433" wikidata="Q1257373" url="?curid=1086433" title="Maykop culture">
<text>The Maykop culture or Maikop culture (, , scientific transliteration: &quot;Majkop,&quot;), c. 3700 BC–3000 BC, is a major Bronze Age archaeological culture in the western Caucasus region.

It extends along the area from the Taman Peninsula at the Kerch Strait to near the modern border of Dagestan and southwards to the Kura River. The culture takes its name from a royal burial, the Maykop kurgan in the Kuban River valley.

According to genetic studies on ancient DNA published in 2018, the Maykop population came from the south, from Imereti, and was descended from the Chalcolithic farmers known as Darkveti-Meshoko who first colonized the north side of the Caucasus. Maykop is therefore the &quot;ideal archaeological candidate for the founders of the Northwest Caucasian language family&quot;.

==Territory==

In the south, the Maykop culture bordered the approximately contemporaneous Kura–Araxes culture (3500—2200 BC), which extends into the Armenian Plateau and apparently influenced it. To the north is the Yamna culture, including the Novotitarovskaya culture (3300—2700), which it overlaps in territorial extent. It is contemporaneous with the late Uruk period in Mesopotamia.

The Kuban River is navigable for much of its length and provides an easy water-passage via the Sea of Azov to the territory of the Yamna culture, along the Don and Donets River systems. The Maykop culture was thus well-situated to exploit the trading possibilities with the central Ukraine area.

Radiocarbon dates for various monuments of the Maykop culture are from 3950 - 3650 - 3610 - 2980 calBC.
After the discovery of the Leyla-Tepe culture in the 1980s, some links were noted with the Maykop culture.

The Leyla-Tepe culture is a culture of archaeological interest from the Chalcolithic era. Its population was distributed on the southern slopes of the Central Caucasus (modern Azerbaijan, Agdam District), from 4350 until 4000 B.C. Similar amphora burials in the South Caucasus are found in the Western Georgian Jar-Burial Culture.

The culture has also been linked to the north Ubaid period monuments, in particular, with the settlements in the Eastern Anatolia Region. The settlement is of a typical Western-Asian variety, with the dwellings packed closely together and made of mud bricks with smoke outlets.

It has been suggested that the Leyla-Tepe were the founders of the Maykop culture. An expedition to Syria by the Russian Academy of Sciences revealed the similarity of the Maykop and Leyla-Tepe artifacts with those found recently while excavating the ancient city of Tel Khazneh I, from the 4th millennium BC.

In 2010, nearly 200 Bronze Age sites were reported stretching over 60 miles from the Kuban River to Nalchik, at an altitude of between 4,620 feet and 7,920 feet. They were all &quot;visibly constructed according to the same architectural plan, with an oval courtyard in the center, and connected by roads.&quot;

== Culture ==


=== Art ===
In the early 20th century, researchers established the existence of a local Maykop animal style in the artifacts found. This style was seen as the prototype for animal styles of later archaeological cultures: the Maykop animal style is more than a thousand years older than the Scythian, Sarmatian and Celtic animal styles.

Attributed to the Maykop culture are petroglyphs which have yet to be deciphered.

=== Horse breeding ===
The Maykop people lived sedentary lives, and horses formed a very low percentage of their livestock, which mostly consisted of pigs and cattle.

Archaeologists have discovered a unique form of bronze cheek-piece, which consists of a bronze rod with a twisted loop in the middle that threads through the nodes and connects to the bridle, halter strap, and headband. Notches and bumps on the edges of the cheek-pieces were, apparently, to attach nose and under-lip straps.

Some of the earliest wagon wheels in the world are found in Maykop culture area. The two solid wooden wheels from the kurgan of Novokorsunskaya in the Kuban region have been dated to the second half of the fourth millennium.

=== Terrace agriculture ===
The construction of artificial terrace complexes in the mountains is evidence of their sedentary living, high population density, and high levels of agricultural and technical skills. The terraces were built around the fourth millennium BC. and all subsequent cultures used them for agricultural purposes. The vast majority of pottery found on the terraces are from the Maykop period, the rest from the Scythian and Alan period. The Maykop terraces are among the most ancient in the world, but they are little studied. The longevity of the terraces (more than 5000 years) points to a tradition of landscape engineering.

==Origins==

===Colchis region===
Based on Wang (2018), David W. Anthony (2019) notes that &quot;the Maikop population was descended from the Eneolithic farmers [that] came from the south, probably from western Georgia [the Darkveti-Meshoko culture], and are the ideal archaeological candidate for the founders of the Northwest Caucasian language family.&quot; He also notes that the Bronze Age Maykop individuals tested by Wang (2018) could not have contributed to the Yamnaya gene pool, Yamnaya being the archeological culture most likely connected to the spread of Indo-European languages. Wang (2018) further found that &#x27;Steppe Maykop&#x27; (a population related to the Maykop culture) probably had a minor East Asian-related component, which was estimated at ~6.9% of their ancestry, relating them to Ancient North Eurasians (Upper Palaeolithic Siberians AG3, MA1) and Native Americans.

===Pontic–Caspian steppe===
Its burial practices resemble the burial practices described in the Kurgan hypothesis of Marija Gimbutas, and it has been speculated that the Maykop culture may have contributed to the Yamnaya culture which is nowadays recognised as the ancestor of most Indo-European languages. According to a 2019 article by David Anthony,

However, more detailed studies cast doubt on this scenario. The Maykop DNA contains quite a large admixture (30%–40%) of Anatolian Farmer ancestry. Anthony continues:

According to J.P. Mallory, writing in 1987 before ancient DNA evidence became available:
Anthony agrees that the Maykop culture people probably spoke languages which are ancestral to the Northwest Caucasian languages found in the same region today. Nonetheless, their culture seems to have influenced that of the early Indo-Europeans. Anthony writes:

===Iranian Plateau===
According to Mariya Ivanova the Maykop origins were on the Iranian Plateau:
===Azerbaijan===
More recently, some very ancient kurgans have been discovered at Soyuqbulaq in Azerbaijan. These kurgans date to the beginning of the 4th millennium BC, and belong to Leylatepe Culture. According to the excavators of these kurgans, there are some significant parallels between Soyugbulaq kurgans and the Maykop kurgans:

<doc id="1086440" wikidata="Q3043161" url="?curid=1086440" title="Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency">
<text>Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency also known as OTC deficiency is the most common urea cycle disorder in humans. Ornithine transcarbamylase, the defective enzyme in this disorder, is the final enzyme in the proximal portion of the urea cycle, responsible for converting carbamoyl phosphate and ornithine into citrulline. OTC deficiency is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females.

In severely affected individuals, ammonia concentrations increase rapidly causing ataxia, lethargy and death without rapid intervention. OTC deficiency is diagnosed using a combination of clinical findings and biochemical testing, while confirmation is often done using molecular genetics techniques.

Once an individual has been diagnosed, the treatment goal is to avoid precipitating episodes that can cause an increased ammonia concentration. The most common treatment combines a low protein diet with nitrogen scavenging agents. Liver transplant is considered curative for this disease. Experimental trials of gene therapy using adenoviral vectors resulted in the death of one participant, Jesse Gelsinger, and have been discontinued.

==Signs and symptoms==
As with several other metabolic conditions, OTC deficiency can have variable presentations, regarding age of onset and the severity of symptoms. This compounded when considering heterozygous females and the possibility of non-random X-inactivation. In the classic and most well-known presentation, a male infant appears well initially, but by the second day of life they are irritable, lethargic and stop feeding. A metabolic encephalopathy develops, and this can progress to coma and death without treatment. Ammonia is only toxic to the brain, other tissues can handle elevated ammonia concentrations without problems.

Later onset forms of OTC deficiency can have variable presentations. Although late onset forms of the disease are often considered milder than the classic infantile presentation, any affected individual is at risk for an episode of hyperammonemia that could still be life-threatening, if presented with the appropriate stressors. These patients will often present with headaches, nausea, vomiting, delayed growth and a variety of psychiatric symptoms (confusion, delirium, aggression, or self-injury). A detailed dietary history of an affected individual with undiagnosed OTC deficiency will often reveal a history of protein avoidance.

The prognosis of a patient with severe OTC deficiency is well correlated with the length of the hyperammonemic period rather than the degree of hyperammonemia or the presence of other symptoms, such as seizures. Even for patients with late onset forms of the disease, their overall clinical picture is dependent on the extent of hyperammonemia they have experienced, even if it has remained unrecognized.

==Genetics==
OTC deficiency is caused by mutations in the &quot;OTC&quot; gene, which is located on the X chromosome. &quot;OTC&quot; codes for the mitochondrial enzyme ornithine transcarbamylase, which is expressed only in liver. The functional enzyme consists of three identical subunits. OTC is the last enzyme in the proximal portion of the urea cycle, which consists of the reactions that take place in the mitochondria. The substrates of the reaction catalyzed by ornithine transcarbamylase are ornithine and carbamyl phosphate, while the product is citrulline.

There are no common mutations that cause disease, however 10 - 15% of disease causing mutations are deletions. It is inherited in an X-linked recessive manner, meaning males are more commonly affected than females. Females who carry a defective copy of the gene can be severely affected or asymptomatic, largely depending on the random nature of X-inactivation. There is some degree of genotype — phenotype correlation with OTC deficiency, but this depends on a number of situations. Individuals with milder mutations, often associated with late onset disease can still present with severe illness when exposed to sufficient metabolic stress. Correlations are more difficult to ascertain in females, since the residual activity of OTC in the liver is impacted not only by the nature of the mutation, but also by the random pattern of X-inactivation. OTC deficiency is estimated to be the most common urea cycle disorder. An exact incidence is difficult to calculate, due to the varying clinical presentations of later onset forms of the disease. Early estimates of the incidence were as high as 1:14,000 live births, however later studies have decreased these estimates to approximately 1:60,000 - 1:72,000.

==Diagnosis==
In individuals with marked hyperammonemia, a urea cycle disorder is usually high on the list of possible causes. While the immediate focus is lowering the patient&#x27;s ammonia concentrations, identifying the specific cause of increased ammonia levels is key as well.

Diagnostic testing for OTC deficiency, or any individual with hyperammonemia involves plasma and urine amino acid analysis, urine organic acid analysis (to identify the presence or absence of orotic acid, as well as rule out an organic acidemia) and plasma acylcarnitines (will be normal in OTC deficiency, but can identify some other causes of hyperammonemia). An individual with untreated OTC deficiency will show decreased citrulline and arginine concentrations (because the enzyme block is proximal to these intermediates) and increased orotic acid. The increased orotic acid concentrations result from the buildup of carbamoyl phosphate. This biochemical phenotype (increased ammonia, low citrulline and increased orotic acid) is classic for OTC deficiency, but can also be seen in neonatal presentations of ornithine aminotransferase deficiency. Only severely affected males consistently demonstrate this classic biochemical phenotype.

Heterozygous females can be difficult to diagnose. With the rise of sequencing techniques, molecular testing has become preferred, particularly when the disease causing mutations in the family are known. Historically, heterozygous females were often diagnosed using an allopurinol challenge. In a female with reduced enzyme activity, an oral dose of allopurinol would be metabolized to oxypurinol ribonucleotide, which blocks the pyrimidine biosynthetic pathway. When this induced enzymatic block is combined with reduced physiologic enzyme activity as seen in heterozygotes, the elevation of orotic acid could be used to differentiate heterozygotes from unaffected individuals. This test was not universally effective, as it had both false negative and false positive results.

Ornithine transcarbamylase is only expressed in the liver, thus performing an enzyme assay to confirm the diagnosis requires a liver biopsy. Before molecular genetic testing was commonly available, this was one of the only methods for confirmation of a suspected diagnosis. In cases where prenatal diagnosis was requested, a fetal liver biopsy used to be required to confirm if a fetus was affected. Modern molecular techniques have eliminated this need, and gene sequencing is now the preferred method of diagnosis in asymptomatic family members after the diagnosis has been confirmed in a proband.

==Treatment==
The treatment goal for individuals affected with OTC deficiency is the avoidance of hyperammonemia. This can be accomplished through a strictly controlled low-protein diet, as well as preventative treatment with nitrogen scavenging agents such as sodium benzoate. The goal is to minimize the nitrogen intake while allowing waste nitrogen to be excreted by alternate pathways. Arginine is typically supplemented as well, in an effort to improve the overall function of the urea cycle. If a hyperammonemic episode occurs, the aim of treatment is to reduce the individual&#x27;s ammonia levels as soon as possible. In extreme cases, this can involve hemodialysis.

Gene therapy had been considered a possibility for curative treatment for OTC deficiency, and clinical trials were taking place at the University of Pennsylvania in the late 1990s. These were halted after the death of Jesse Gelsinger, a young man taking part in a phase I trial using an adenovirus vector. Currently, the only option for curing OTC deficiency is a liver transplant, which restores normal enzyme activity. A 2005 review of 51 patients with OTC deficiency who underwent liver transplant estimated 5-year survival rates of greater than 90%. Severe cases of OTC deficiency are typically evaluated for liver transplant by 6 months of age.

==Prognosis==
A 1999 retrospective study of 74 cases of neonatal onset found that 32 (43%) patients died during their first hyperammonemic episode. Of those who survived, less than 20% survived to age 14. Few of these patients received liver transplants.

==Society and culture==
Ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency was the final diagnosis of a patient treated in the 15th episode of 1st season of House, M. D. It was also the final diagnosis of a patient that died in the 3rd episode of 3rd season of Chicago Med.

<doc id="1086443" wikidata="Q27552044" url="?curid=1086443" title="Sup35p">
<text>Sup35p is the &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; (a yeast) eukaryotic translation release factor. More specifically, it is the yeast eukaryotic release factor 3 (eRF3), which forms the translation termination complex with eRF1 (Sup45p in yeast). This complex recognizes and catalyzes the release of the nascent polypeptide chain when the ribosome encounters a stop codon. While eRF1 recognizes stop codons, eRF3 facilitates the release of the polypeptide chain through GTP hydrolysis.

Partial loss of function results in nonsense suppression, in which stop codons are ignored and proteins are abnormally synthesized with carboxyl terminal extensions. Complete loss of function is fatal.

== History ==
Sup35p was shown to propagate in a prion form in 1994 by Reed Wickner. For this reason it is an intensely studied protein. When yeast cells harbor Sup35p in the prion state the resulting phenotype is known as [PSI+]. In [PSI+] cells Sup35p exists in an amyloid state that can be propagated and passed to daughter cells. This results in less soluble and functional protein and thus in an increased rate of nonsense suppression (translational read-through of stop codons).

The overexpression of the gene has been shown to induce the [Psi+] conformation.

== Evolutionary capacitance ==
Several journal articles have suggested that the ability to interconvert between [PSI+] and [psi-](prion-free) states provides an evolutionary advantage, but this remains an area of much debate.

Susan Lindquist has shown that isogenic populations of yeast can express different phenotypes based on whether they had the prion form of Sup35p or the non-prion form. She did an experiment where seven strains of yeast with different genetic backgrounds were grown under many different stressful conditions, with matched [PSI+] and [psi-] strains. In some cases, the [PSI+] version grew faster, in others [psi-] grew faster. She proposed that [PSI+] may act as an evolutionary capacitor to facilitate adaptation by releasing cryptic genetic variation in natural populations at times of stress. This variation would lie beyond stop codons, which show a high rate of in-frame loss in yeast. Mathematical models suggest that [PSI+] may have evolved for this function.

==Physical Characteristics==

Sup 35 contains a carboxyl-terminal region (C-terminus), which is responsible for the translation-termination activity. The amino-terminal(N-terminus) region of the protein is responsible for alternately folding depending on the conformation. The middle (m) domain has an unknown function. In an effort to determine the function of these N and M regions, in Susan Lindquists&#x27; experiment two of the strains were engineered to produce a version of Sup35p which does not include the N and M regions.

The Sup35p protein is 685 amino acids long. The C-terminal contains 5 complete and one incomplete repeat of the Oligopeptide repeat sequence PQGGYQQ-YN. In modified versions of the gene, it has been shown that the more repeats of this sequence present, the more the protein is to assume the [Psi+] confirmation. In fact, the addition of two extra repeats (R2) result in the [Psi-] to [Psi+] conversion in being 5000 times faster. PMN2, a mutant, dominant version of the gene Sup35p, has a glycine to aspartic acid substitution in the second repeat. The resulting phenotype is a lack of ability to maintain the [Psi+] conformation.

The N-terminus has a high glutamine/asparagine amount at 43%, while the average yeast protein only contains 9%. The N terminus is 114 amino acids long and is termed the prion forming domain (PrD). Over expression of the Sup35p gene can lead to [Psi+].

Both the N and M terminals and the C terminus form binding sites to Sup45p, giving a total of two. Also, in binding to Sup45p the [psi+] protein can cause it to aggregate and form a prion.

==Adenine Pathway==

The phenotypic differences between [psi-] and [psi+] is made clear when the ability of the cell to make adenine is tampered with. The buildup of P-ribosylamino imidazole (AIR) (a precursor in the adenine pathway in yeast) induces a red pigment in a yeast colony visible to the naked eye. In isogenic strains where the non-sense mutation is in the middle of either the gene ADE 2 or ADE 1 (enzymes involved in the pathway), the [psi-] strain has either build ups of P-ribosylamino imidazole (AIR), or P-ribosylamino imidazolecarboxylate (CAIR), respectively. Because CAIR converts back into AIR if the enzyme that catalyzes it to the next precursor is absent, either mutation will cause a red color in the [psi-] strain. The [psi+] strain appears white even when subjected to the same non-sense mutations. Thus, it is inferred that the eRF3 of the [psi+] is non-functional.

This phenomenon is because the eRF3 in [psi-] is able to disconnect the ribosome effectively, so the enzyme cannot be properly synthesized. However, in the [psi+] strain, the enzyme is able to be synthesized enough so that the pathway still successfully produces adenine.

<text>Baghdati () is a town of 3,700 people in the Imereti region of western Georgia, at the edge of the Ajameti forest on the river Khanistsqali, a tributary of the Rioni.

==Geography==
The town is located at the edge of the Ajameti forest on the left bank of the river Khanistsqali, about west-northwest of Tbilisi and south-southeast of Kutaisi.

The climate of Baghdati can be classified as moderately humid subtropical (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfa&quot;). 

==History==

Baghdati is one of the oldest villages in the historical Imereti region. Its name shares the same origins as the name of the capital of Iraq, Baghdād: &quot;Bagh&quot; &#x27;god&#x27; and &quot;dāti&quot; &#x27;given&#x27;, which can be translated as &quot;God-given&quot; or &quot;God&#x27;s gift&quot; in the Pahlavi language. When Georgia was part of the Russian Empire and during the Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic, its name was changed to Baghdadi (). In 1940, it was renamed Mayakovsky (; ), after the poet Vladimir Mayakovsky who was born here in 1893. In 1981, Mayakovsky was granted town status. In 1991, the original name, slightly modified, was restored.

==Demographics==

==Economy==
In Baghdati there is a furniture factory and companies in the food industry (canned food, wine). The nearest railway stations are located in Rioni and Kutaisi.

==Culture==
Baghdati has the Vladimir Mayakovsky Museum and a National Theatre. It is also home to the Baghdati Cultural Center and the Baghdati Central Stadium.

==Notable people==

<text>Sun City is a luxury resort and casino, situated in the North West Province of South Africa. It is located between the Elands River and the Pilanesberg, built on the land of Bakubung Village (known as Ledig) about 140 km (90 miles) northwest of Johannesburg, near the city of Rustenburg. The complex borders the Pilanesberg National Park. It is made up of a number of themed sub-resorts with hotels on each, including the original Sun City Resort, The Cabanas, The Cascades and the Lost City (The Palace).

== History ==

=== Beginning ===
Sun City was developed by the hotel magnate Sol Kerzner as part of his Sun International group of properties. It was officially opened on 7 December 1979, then located in the Bantustan of Bophuthatswana.

As Bophuthatswana had been declared an independent state by South Africa&#x27;s apartheid government (although unrecognised as such by any other country), it could provide entertainment such as gambling and topless revue shows, which were banned in South Africa. Those factors, as well as its relatively close location to the large metropolitan areas of Pretoria and Johannesburg, ensured that Sun City soon became a popular holiday and weekend destination. During apartheid, Sun City imposed severe restrictions on the ability of black South Africans to enter the Sun City area legally.

=== Music performances and boycotts ===
The United Nations had imposed a cultural boycott on South Africa in condemnation of apartheid. To overcome this, Kerzner offered substantial financial incentives to performing artists to use Sun City as a venue. Several acts disregarded the boycott and performed at the venue, such as The Beach Boys, Linda Ronstadt, Cher, Ray Charles, Millie Jackson, Liza Minnelli, Frank Sinatra (1981), Shirley Bassey (1981), Olivia Newton-John (1982), Dolly Parton (1982), Neil Sedaka (1982), Paul Anka, Status Quo, Rod Stewart (July 1983), Elton John (October 1983), and Boney M. (1984).

British rock band Queen&#x27;s series of performances at the venue in October 1984 in transgression of the boycott caused considerable controversy, prompting criticism in the British music press, a fine from the Musicians&#x27; Union and their inclusion on the United Nations&#x27; blacklisted artists. Following the criticism, Queen strongly defended their decision, saying they &quot;play to anybody who wants to come and listen&quot; and were &quot;a very non-political group&quot;, but donated to a school for the deaf and blind to assert their philanthropic values. In 2021, drummer Roger Taylor voiced regret for the Sun City shows, stating that &quot;We went with the best intentions, but I still think it was kind of a mistake.&quot;

On 25 October 1980, Sun City&#x27;s &quot;Superbowl&quot; hosted a racially mixed world heavyweight boxing championship fight between champion American Mike Weaver and challenger South African Gerrie Coetzee. Weaver won the fight by knockout in the 13th round, successfully defending his World Boxing Association world heavyweight title.

In 1985, E Street Band guitarist Steven Van Zandt made the venue the focus of his music-industry activist group Artists United Against Apartheid. Forty-nine top recording artists collaborated on a song called &quot;Sun City&quot;, in which they pledged they would not perform at the resort because of their opposition to apartheid. Additionally, Simple Minds included the song as part of a live medley on their &quot;Live in the City of Light&quot; double album in 1987. The same year, Black Sabbath played six shows in Sun City with a short-lived line-up featuring original guitarist Tony Iommi, keyboardist Geoff Nicholls, then-new vocalist Tony Martin, and a rhythm section with drummer Terry Chimes (The Clash) and bassist Dave Spitz (Great White).

=== Skytrain ===
In January 1986 the Skytrain people mover, built with Otis Hovair technology, took its first trip on a line that connects a remote parking lot to the Entertainment Centre. Two trains of three cars shuttle on the route.

=== Post-apartheid ===
Sun City has continued since Bophuthatswana was re-incorporated in the new South Africa in 1994.

The resort has four hotels:
* Sun City Hotel or The Main Hotel 
* Cascades Hotel;
* The Cabanas;
* The Palace of the Lost City.

Sun City has the Vacation Club which is a hotel but also sold in a timeshare scheme.

Sun City also has two international-standard 18-hole golf courses, the Gary Player Country Club and the Lost City Golf Course, both designed by Gary Player. The Gary Player Country Club is home to the Nedbank Golf Challenge (formerly the Nedbank Million Dollar Golf Challenge) that is held annually.

The Sun City resort has hosted various concerts and events, including the Miss South Africa and Miss South Africa Teen Pageant. These pageants take place annually in Sun City&#x27;s Super Bowl Arena and the Valley of Waves. It also hosted Miss World pageant five times, from 1992 to 1995, and 2001. The resort was also the site of the Sun City Agreement.

In 2001, Sun City was the site of the 2nd IIFA Awards. Held at the Arena, it honoured both artistic and technical excellence of professionals in Bollywood, for that year. Also on that year on 19 May, Irish vocal pop band Westlife held a concert for their Where Dreams Come True Tour supporting their album &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;.

In 2014, the film &quot;Blended&quot; starring Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler premiered on the premises after being filmed mostly at the resort, as was the 2017 film &quot;10 Days in Sun City&quot;.

In 2022, the World Classic Powerlifting Championships 2022 was held in Sun City.
In 2024, the Commonwealth Powerlifting Championships and the World Masters will also be held in Sun City.

<text>Cedric Constantine Myton (born 1947) is a Jamaican Rastafari reggae musician who was a founding member of the roots reggae band The Congos.

==Career==
Myton was born in Old Harbour, Jamaica. He began his singing career with the group The Bell Stars, who recorded one single 45&quot; &quot;over and over&quot; (1967), which was a minor success. Alongside Lincoln Thompson, &quot;preps&quot; Lewis, and Devon Russell, Myton formed The Tartans in 1968, the group released many 45&quot; singles, and had early success in 1969 with the hit 45 &quot;Dance All Night&quot;. After a couple of years The Tartans disbanded, and Myton alongside Lincoln &quot;Prince&quot; Thompson, formed &quot;The Royal Rasses&quot;. Myton spent almost three years alongside Thompson, writing the tracks which would constitute the Royal Rasses album &quot;Humanity.&quot; Myton also sang on every track on &quot;Humanity.&quot; This album was a big success, although Myton left The Royal Rasses shortly after the release of &quot;Humanity.&quot; The band continued without Myton, who went on to form The Congos, alongside Roydel Johnson, who had a rich &quot;tenor&quot; and Watty Burnett who provided a &quot;Deep Barritone&quot;, which combined with Myton&#x27;s rich &quot;Falsetto&quot; anchored The Congos.

The first album they recorded, &quot;Heart of the Congos,&quot; was produced by Lee &quot;Scratch&quot; Perry. Due to both a dispute between the Perry and Island Records&#x27; favouritism of Bob Marley, &quot;Heart of the Congos&quot; was shelved because it was deemed &quot;a strong album.&quot; Island Records, led by Chris Blackwell, felt it would take away the limelight from Marley. Initially it was released in very limited numbers on Perry&#x27;s Black Art label and Perry re-mixed the album adding various external sounds, such as &quot;cow horns&quot; provided by the baritone Burnett. Many years later the English group The Beat released &quot;Heart of the Congos&quot; on their own Go-Feet label, as did the company Blood and Fire. &quot;Heart of the Congos&quot; was a big success.

Later Myton pursued a solo career. After some time, the Congos reformed and recorded an album titled, &quot;Back in the Black Ark.&quot; The group toured as well, appearing at music festivals such as the 2012 Rototom Sunsplash.

<doc id="1086462" wikidata="Q13111739" url="?curid=1086462" title="Indian Congress (Socialist)">
<text>Indian Congress (Socialist) (IC(S)) also known as Congress (Secular) was a political party in India between 1978 and 1986.

The party was formed through a split in the Indian National Congress. Initially the party was known as the Indian National Congress (Urs) and was led by D. Devraj Urs.

It broke away from the parent party in 1978 following Indira Gandhi&#x27;s drubbing in the 1977 General Elections. Urs took with him many legislators from Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra and Goa including future Union Ministers and Chief Ministers A.K. Antony, Sharad Pawar, Dev Kant Baruah, Priyaranjan Das Munshi, Sarat Chandra Sinha, K. P. Unnikrishnan and Mohammad Yunus Saleem.

When Sharad Pawar took over the party presidency in October 1981, the name of the party was changed to Indian Congress (Socialist).

He became the youngest chief minister of Maharashtra by toppling the Vasantdada Patil-led Congress government in 1978. He led a group of 40 MLAs to split from the parent party and formed the government with Janata Party&#x27;s support.

In 1980, after Indira Gandhi swept the Lok Sabha polls, Pawar&#x27;s state government was dismissed. In the Maharashtra elections in 1980, his party lost.

Again in 1985, Pawar&#x27;s party the Indian National Congress (Socialist) won only 54 seats and he became the Leader of Opposition in Maharashtra. With the split and the decline of the Janata Party nationally, Pawar soon realised that he can&#x27;t get back to power in Maharashtra on his own. Pawar merged his party back into the Congress in 1986.

One section led by Sarat Chandra Sinha broke away from IC(S) in 1984 and formed a separate party known as Indian Congress (Socialist) – Sarat Chandra Sinha. This faction merged with Sharad Pawar&#x27;s Nationalist Congress Party in 1999.

However, in Kerala, the residual faction of Indian Congress (Socialist), Congress (Secular) led by Kadannappalli Ramachandran still exists and is a part of the Left Democratic Front. In 2007, Democratic Indira Congress (Left) merged with this party.

<text>Zestaponi (, ) is the administrative center of Zestaponi District in Western Georgia. Zestaponi is the center of an ancient, historical part of Georgia – Margveti, which is a part of Imereti province. Zestaponi is the center of Margveti&#x27;s Eparchy of the Georgian Orthodox Church. Zestaponi is situated in the furthest east of the Colchis Plateau, and is built on both banks of the Qvirila River.

It is an important industrial center, with a large ferro-alloy plant processing manganese ore from nearby Chiatura. Zestaponi is in the Kolkheti lowlands, a semi-tropical region with relatively cold winters averaging in January and hot summers averaging in August. The surrounding countryside is a wine-growing region.

==Industry==

The town of Zestaponi and the smaller neighboring town of Shorapani are industrial centers.
The Zestaponi ferro-alloy plant processes raw manganese ore shipped by rail down the Kvirila valley from Chiatura, supplying 6% of world demand.
The largest ferroalloy plant in the country, in 1998 it produced 35,000 tonnes of silicomanganese and 11,000 tonnes of medium-carbon manganese alloy. This was well below its previous peak production of 110,000 tonnes of manganese-based alloys. The British steel trading company Stemcor acquired the ferro-alloy plant in February 2006.

Two other plants in the Zestaponi / Shorapani area produce electrical products, aluminum and copper cable and wire. There were more plants in the Soviet era producing fireproof clay, marble and clothing. Zestaponi is also one of the winery-vinery centers of Georgia. Wine prepared from the Tsitsqa and Tsolikouri species are widely known.

==History==

Zestaponi lies west of the small but ancient fortress town of Shorapani, founded by Pharnavaz I of Iberia in the 3rd century BC. The town of Zestaponi is first mentioned in historical records in the 1560s. The name of the city is connected with the bank of river Kvirila (), upper bank (), that was used by the local population and foreign travelers from ancient times.

In the 1820s a Cossack army was posted in the town, which was then called &quot;Kvirila&quot; after the river that runs through it. During the Russian Empire, the city was the administrative center of the Shorapani Uyezd of the Kutaisi Governorate. In 1920, the name was changed again to &quot;Jugeli&quot;, after a famous revolutionary. In 1921, the city regained its historical name.

There are many historical monuments in the Zestaponi region: Zeda Saqara (11th century), Tabakini (6th century), Tseva (11th century), Sanakhshire and other churches, and castles from the early Middle Ages in Shrosha and Shorapani. Shorapani (Sarapanis) is the toponymy, that is mentioned in old Greek mythology. That was Sarapanis that Jason and his Argonaut friends approached during their travel in old Colchis (Kolkhida).

==Sports and culture==

The local football club, FC Zestaponi, plays in the top league in Georgia and twice won the Georgian championship in the 2010-11 and 2011-12 season. The local women&#x27;s basketball team was champion of Georgia in 2011. The city&#x27;s stadium was built by Zestaponi Ferro-alloy Plant in 1952 and since its renovation has a capacity of 4,600.

The writer Boris Akunin and philosopher Tengiz Tsereteli were born in Zestaponi. The psychologist and philosopher Dimitri Uznadze was born in the nearby village of Sakara in 1886. Famous Georgian actors Shalva Ghambashidze, Ushangi Chkheidze, Sergo and Bukhuti Zakariadze were also born in Zestaponi. World wrestling (Greco-Roman) champion Mikhail Saladze is from Zestaponi.

<text>Dan Smith is an American illustrator and graphic artist known for his work for Wizards of the Coast, FASA, White Wolf, Steve Jackson Games, Iron Crown, Hasbro, Nintendo, and Namco. 

While known primarily as an illustrator, Dan Smith is also a designer of family card games, including &quot;Battle of the Bands&quot;, &quot;Portable Adventures&quot; and &quot;King of Crime&quot;.

Dan Smith has a variety of illustration styles ranging from kid friendly to teen edgy. His black-and-white work for &quot;GURPS&quot; became so prominent in the 1990s, he became the unofficial &#x27;house artist&#x27;. One of his techniques was to photograph friends in poses as illustration models. This allows friends to flip through role-playing game books and see themselves on the pages dressed as wizards and secret agents.

Dan Smith, with fellow graphic designers Jeff Koke and Derek Pearcy, won the 1997 Origins Award for &quot;Best Graphic Presentation of a Roleplaying Game, Adventure, or Supplement&quot; for the role-playing game &quot;In Nomine&quot;.
He also garnered a nomination for best traditional card game and supplement for his seminal Battle of the Bands and its sequel, Backstage Pass.

<doc id="1086475" wikidata="Q1879193" url="?curid=1086475" title="Upper Heyford, Oxfordshire">
<text>Upper Heyford is a village and civil parish about northwest of Bicester in Oxfordshire, England. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 1,295.

The village is just east of the River Cherwell. &quot;Upper&quot; distinguishes it from Lower Heyford which is about &quot;lower&quot;, downstream along the Cherwell valley. The parish measures about east–west and almost north–south. In 1959 it covered .

The parish&#x27;s western boundary is just west of the river. Chilgrove Drive, a continuation of Aves ditch, forms part of the parish&#x27;s eastern boundary. Field boundaries bound the parish on the south. In the north the boundary crosses the former RAF Upper Heyford airfield, following the course of former field boundaries.

==Prehistory==
The Portway is a pre-Roman road running parallel with the River Cherwell on high ground about east of the river. Its course bisects Upper Heyford parish and passes just east of the village. Part of it forms a minor road to Kirtlington.

==Manor==
The Domesday Book of 1086 records the village as &quot;Haiford&quot;, with a manor of 10 hides that was one of the many estates of the Norman baron Robert D&#x27;Oyly. Along with many manors of the D&#x27;Oyly estate, Heyford became part of the Honour of Wallingford. The manor was tenanted by the de Chesney family until the late 12th century, when Maud de Chesney became married to Henry FitzGerold, chamberlain to Henry II. Maud left the manor to her eldest son Warin, who had succeeded to the manor by 1198 and after whom the village became called &quot;Heyford Warren&quot;. Warin&#x27;s daughter Margaret married Baldwin de Redvers, son of William de Redvers, 5th Earl of Devon. Heyford Warren remained with the Earls of Devon and thereby passed to Isabella de Fortibus, Countess of Devon in 1262.

Isabella outlived all her children, so after her death in 1293 her inheritance was disputed between Warin de Lisle and Hugh de Courtenay, who later became 9th Earl of Devon. Warin died in 1296 but his son Robert eventually won seisin of Heyford Warren in 1310, except for two and a half virgates that were awarded to de Courtenay. Robert also received the nearby manor of Fritwell from the Countess&#x27;s estate. In 1380 his great-grandson, also Robert de Lisle, sold the manor along with some land at Barford St. Michael for £1,000 to William of Wykeham, Bishop of Winchester, who made them part of his endowment for the foundation of New College, Oxford.
In about 1400 or shortly thereafter New College had a tithe barn built at Manor Farm in the village. Its plan is by , it is of nine bays and built of coursed rubble with ashlar quoins and buttresses. The roof is of Stonesfield slate and has raised-cruck trusses. The building has similarities with tithe barns at Swalcliffe and Adderbury, both of which were also built for New College early in the 15th century. It is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.

Upper Heyford&#x27;s common lands were enclosed in 1842. New College still held the manor in the early 1950s.

==Church and chapels==
===Church of England===

The village had a church by AD 1074. Inside the current Church of England parish church of St Mary is a 14th-century recumbent effigy of a priest in a 14th-century arched recess in the chancel. The church may have been rebuilt in the latter part of the 15th century, but only the Perpendicular Gothic west tower survives from that time.

Major repairs to the roof and south aisle were made in 1668 and 1769, but by the 1860s the nave and chancel were in a poor condition again. In 1865 the church was demolished except for the west tower. A new church, designed by the architect Thomas Talbot Bury in a Gothic Revival interpretation of Perpendicular Gothic, was built in its place and completed in 1867.
This Victorian building has very regular coursed masonry, which departs conspicuously from the traditional Mediæval rubble masonry of the tower and, presumably, the demolished parts of the previous church. Bury preserved only a handful of features from the Mediæval church: a Perpendicular Gothic window in the north wall of the chancel, a piscina, a tomb recess and a 14th-century effigy of a priest. St Mary&#x27;s is a Grade II* listed building.

The tower has three bells, the oldest of which is the tenor bell cast in 1624 by Richard I Purdue, who had foundries in places including Glastonbury and Stoford in Somerset. Mears &amp; Stainbank of the Whitechapel Bell Foundry cast the second bell in 1866 and the treble bell in 1946. St Mary&#x27;s has also a Sanctus bell of unknown date.

St Mary&#x27;s parsonage was designed by William Wilkinson and built in 1869.

St Mary&#x27;s parish is now part of the Cherwell Valley Benefice, along with the parishes of Ardley, Fritwell, Lower Heyford, Somerton and Souldern.

===Methodist chapels===

In 1829 a meeting-place for Protestant Dissenters was licensed in Upper Heyford. They may have been Wesleyan Methodists, whose chapel was rebuilt in 1867. By 1955 its congregation had dwindled to three members. It later closed and was converted into a shop. It is now a private house.

In 1849 a second meeting-place was licensed, probably for Reformed Methodists. It was used until the 1880s. In the 1850s and 1860s the Primitive Methodists also had a licensed meeting-place in Upper Heyford.

==Cemetery==
In 1919 or 1920 a new parish cemetery was opened immediately northeast of St Mary&#x27;s churchyard, on the opposite side of Church Walk.

In the Second World War an area in the southwest corner of the new cemetery, nearest the church, was reserved for Imperial War Graves Commission burials. 40 airmen from RAF Upper Heyford are now buried here, including eight from the Royal Canadian Air Force and two from the Royal New Zealand Air Force.

Not all RAF Upper Heyford burials are here. Another 26 are in the churchyard of the neighbouring parish of All Saints, Middleton Stoney.

==Economic and social history==

By 1784 Upper Heyford had a pub called the Three Horse Shoes. It was still trading in the 20th century, but is now a private house. After 1887 and in 1951 the village had two pubs. Now only the Barley Mow (see below) is still trading.

In 1787 the Oxford Canal was extended south from Banbury down the Cherwell valley as far as Northbrook near Kirtlington. In so doing it passed through the Upper Heyford parish just west of the village. Allen&#x27;s Lock on the canal is just north of the village.
By 1815 Upper Heyford had a small Dame school. It was still operating in 1833 but had ceased by 1854. In 1828 St Mary&#x27;s parish opened a Sunday school supported by New College. A National School was built and opened in 1859 and enlarged in 1893. In 1925 it was reorganised as a junior school, with senior pupils going to the school at Steeple Aston. The school was still open in 1954 but has since closed. The building is now a private house.

The Oxford and Rugby Railway was authorised in 1845 and its – section opened in September 1850. It passes through the northwest corner of Upper Heyford parish, crossing both the River Cherwell and the Oxford Canal.

==RAF Upper Heyford==

About east of the village is the former RAF Upper Heyford airfield. The RAF used the airfield from the 1920s as a bomber station, then in the 1950s assigned to the USAF. Since its closure in 1994 the airfield has been converted into a substantial industrial and commercial estate. The runway, once the second longest in Europe, is used to store new cars awaiting delivery to dealers. Numerous Cold War relics remain including disused bunkers, water towers, huts and fences. Many of the buildings are now let out as industrial units. An estate of several hundred former MoD houses immediately south of the airfield is being redeveloped as an estate of 700 new homes called Heyford Park.

===Air crashes===

From time to time there were air crashes associated with the air base. Two serious air crashes that happened in Upper Heyford parish were in 1954 and 1992.

In May 1954 a Boeing B-47 Stratojet of the 22nd Bombardment Group crashed in a field about northwest of the Oxford – Banbury railway line and burst into flames. The aircraft was not carrying bombs, but rounds from its two .50-calibre M2 Browning machine guns exploded in the fire and continued to do so for several hours.

On 17 September 1992 a General Dynamics F-111E of the 55th Fighter Squadron suffered an hydraulic failure on a routine training flight. A controller on the ground at the air base told the two crew to eject. But pilot Jerry Lindh and navigator/weapons systems officer David &quot;Mike&quot; McGuire feared the aircraft could hit either Upper Heyford village or its neighbour North Aston, so they chose to remain with their aircraft to try to control its descent.

A customer of the Three Horse Shoes pub who saw the crash reported &quot;The jet was making a horrible sputtering noise and looked to barely be in control. I can only describe it as a wobbly wing-flapping with the wing tips alternatively going +/- 25-30 degrees with the right wing dipping furthest.&quot;
The aircraft was on approach to the airfield&#x27;s main runway but skimmed Somerton Road, struck the tops of a set of pole-mounted landing lights, ploughed through a hedge, crashed onto the runway and exploded. The landlord of the Barley Mow pub in Somerton Road said &quot;The pub shook and I looked out and saw the aircraft skating across the road in two separate parts. It went through the fence and on to the base and burst into flames.&quot;

On the final approach Captain Lindh and Major McGuire did launch their escape pod, but it was entangled in the airfield perimeter fence and both men were killed. Residents paid tribute to the two men for sacrificing themselves to save the village. They paid for a monument to the two men to be made and erected in the air force section of Upper Heyford cemetery.

On 2 April 2022 a plane crashed into an empty newly-built block of flats. The pilot was taken to hospital and no-one else was injured.

==Amenities==

Upper Heyford has one pub, the Barley Mow. It is controlled by Fuller&#x27;s Brewery.

The village has a village hall, allotments, sports field, football club and children&#x27;s playground.

===Public transport===
Red Rose Travel bus route 25 serves Upper Heyford, linking the village with Bicester &quot;via&quot; Middleton Stoney in one direction, and with Lower Heyford in the other. There are bus stops in Camp Road: at the east end of the village near the junction of Somerton Road, and at Heyford Park near the entrance of the former airfield.

Buses run from Mondays to Saturdays, mostly at hourly intervals. There is no late evening service, and no service on Sundays or bank holidays.

==Climate==
Unusually for a location in the UK, Upper Heyford has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate using the new averages for 1991–2020. It is one of only two places in the UK with this climate. The other is Woodbridge, Suffolk.

<text>Stone Of Tears is the second book in Terry Goodkind&#x27;s epic fantasy series &quot;The Sword of Truth&quot;.

==Plot summary==
After the death of Darken Rahl and planning his wedding to Kahlan, Richard is afflicted by a series of painful headaches. He also learns from Shota that he is the bastard son of Darken Rahl and the grandson of Zeddicus Zu&#x27;l Zorander.

Richard gets a visit from three Sisters of the Light, who inform him that his headaches are caused by the awakening of the gift within him and are fatal and unstoppable, unless he receives magical training. The Sisters tell him that he must go with them and wear a Rada&#x27;Han, a magical collar, in order to control his headaches and the gift. They also explain that they will offer him their help three times, and, if he refuses each time, they will not be able to help him ever again. Richard refuses twice, and each time a Sister commits suicide.

Seeking guidance on how to repair the veil, Richard and Kahlan request another &quot;gathering&quot;; this involves turning to the &quot;ancestors&#x27; spirits&quot; for help. But instead of being able to speak to the spirits, Richard and Kahlan are sent down to the underworld and are placed face-to-face with Darken Rahl. Rahl touches Richard with the Keeper&#x27;s mark, making him unconscious and lets Kahlan know that Richard is only minutes away from death.

As Kahlan desperately tries to save Richard, a glowing spirit emerges, Denna, who tells Kahlan that she has to force Richard into wearing the collar; if he does not, the headaches will kill him and everything will be lost. Denna then takes Richard&#x27;s mark, and is sent down to the underworld and the Keeper. As the third and final Sister returns, Kahlan tells Richard that he has to put on the collar. When he tries to explain his reluctance, Kahlan makes him believe that the only way to prove his love for her is to wear it. Richard reluctantly agrees to wear the collar and the sister reveals to them that the third reason for wearing the collar is to inflict pain on the wearer. He leaves, telling her merely to find Zedd. Devastated, Richard submits to the remaining Sister, and leaves with her to go to the Palace of Prophets.

Richard travels with Sister Verna to the Palace of the Prophets, which is located in the Old World. Along the way, they pass between the Barrier, and Richard is drawn to one of the black towers, and is compelled to collect some of the black sand he finds. Later, he is instructed to execute a captive woman as tribute to pass through tribal land, but refuses and chooses to free the woman instead, who promises to take them through the Baku Ban Mana lands. Despite a promise of safe passage, she forces Richard into a battle with thirty Baka Ban Mana blademasters as their oath dictates. Richard slaughters them by tapping in the Sword of Truth&#x27;s collective knowledge of blade fighting. Killing them all, he is bound to marry the priestess, and Richard gives her his magic whistle of the Bird Man to attack the neighboring tribes&#x27; crops and force a peace between them.

Arriving at the Palace of the Prophets, Richard threatens to kill anyone who prevents him from leaving, stating he is a prisoner, not a guest or a student. However, Richard is treated lavishly, and given absurd amounts of gold, which are symbols of his status as a novice wizard, designed to make him not see value in personal wealth. Rather, he uses the money to bribe the entire staff of the Palace to his service, even hiring a brothel on retainer to service the guards. He discovers he is a war wizard: one who has the gift of both additive and subtractive magic. Later, he learns from Nathan Rahl, another wizard in the Palace of the Prophets and Richard&#x27;s ancient ancestor, that he is the first to be born with such power in three thousand years. It is revealed that the Prelate brought Richard to the Palace to flush out the Sisters of the Dark, a secret society within the Sisters of the Light dedicated to the task of unleashing the Keeper into the world of the living.

Kahlan embarks on a long trek back to her home of Aydindril along with three mud people. Along the way, they come across a sacked city, Ebinissia, with the inhabitants&#x27; corpses filling the streets and the surrounding countryside. Kahlan and the three mud people race to catch up with a band of some five thousand troops that are trailing the enemy which sacked Ebinissia. She is shocked to realize that these soldiers are all teenagers and entirely undertrained and unprepared to attack the seasoned, well organized and vastly superior enemy forces. She assumes command of the army and organizes a series of guerilla attacks on what she now knows to be The Imperial Order. Victorious, Kahlan returns to Ayndindril, where she stumbles across Zedd and the sorceress Adie, both of whom had their memories deleted earlier. She returns his memory by telling him that Richard is with the Sisters of the Light. Enraged, Zedd tells Kahlan he will have her beheaded for what she has done, and that she has condemned Richard to a thousand years of his literal nightmares.

After months at the Palace, Richard escapes after killing several Sisters of the Dark. Knowing he must save the world first, he travels to D&#x27;hara. At the Peoples Palace, Richard destroys a spell from a Sister of the Dark by using the black sorcerer&#x27;s sand to corrupt the spell. He then avoids making a last moment mistake by placing the Stone of Tears on Darken Rahl. Richard returns the Stone of Tears to the underworld and once again defeats the Keeper, he rushes to Aydindril to find Kahlan. Upon finding Kahlan has already been executed, Richard kills all the councillors who sentenced her to death. Finding Kahlan&#x27;s grave, he realizes that Zedd has cast a death spell to make all believe that Kahlan is dead. Denna&#x27;s spirit visited the both of them and they were reunited in a place between worlds.

== Wizard&#x27;s Second Rule ==

&quot;Stone of Tears&quot; reveals the Wizard&#x27;s Second Rule:

It is explained in the book as follows: &quot;It sounds a paradox, but kindness and good intentions can be an insidious path to destruction. Sometimes doing what seems right is wrong, and can cause harm. The only counter to it is knowledge, wisdom, forethought, and understanding the First Rule. Even then, that is not always enough. [...] Violation can cause anything from discomfort, to disaster, to death.&quot;

<doc id="1086479" wikidata="Q143945" url="?curid=1086479" title="Carla Bruni">
<text>Carla Bruni-Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa (born Carla Gilberta Bruni Tedeschi; ; 23 December 1967) is an Italian and French singer, songwriter and fashion model who served as the first lady of France from 2008—when she married then president Nicolas Sarkozy—to 2012.

She was born in Italy and moved to France at the age of seven. Bruni was a model from 1987 to 1997 before taking up a career in music. She wrote several songs for Julien Clerc that were featured on his 2000 album, &quot;Si j&#x27;étais elle&quot;. Bruni released her first album, &quot;Quelqu&#x27;un m&#x27;a dit&quot;, in 2003, which eventually spent 34 weeks in the top 10 of the French Albums Chart. Bruni won the Victoire Award for Female Artist of the Year at the 2004 Victoires de la Musique. The same year, Bruni released her second album, &quot;No Promises&quot;, then the following year, she released her third album, &quot;Comme si de rien n&#x27;était.&quot; In 2013, Bruni released her fourth album, &quot;Little French Songs&quot;. In 2017, Bruni released her fifth album, &quot;French Touch&quot;. In 2024, she walked in the Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show.

==Early life and family==
Bruni was born in Turin, Italy. She is legally the daughter of Italian concert pianist Marisa Borini and industrialist, classical composer Alberto Bruni Tedeschi. In 2008, however, Bruni told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that her biological father is Maurizio Remmert, a classical guitarist who comes from a wealthy family. When Remmert met Marisa Borini at a concert in Turin, he was a 19-year-old classical guitarist, and their affair lasted six years. Her sister is actress and movie director Valeria Bruni Tedeschi. She had a brother, Virginio Bruni Tedeschi (1959 – 4 July 2006), who died from complications of HIV/AIDS. Her (legal) paternal grandparents and her maternal grandfather were Italian, while the last quarter of her ancestry is French. She is second cousin of Alessandra Martines.

Bruni is an heiress to the fortune created by the Italian tire manufacturing company CEAT, founded in the 1920s by her legal grandfather, Virginio Bruni Tedeschi. The company was sold in the 1970s to Pirelli (the brand continues in its former subsidiary in India, founded in 1958). The family moved to France in 1975, purportedly to escape the threat of kidnapping by the Red Brigades, a Communist terrorist group active in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s. Bruni grew up in France from the age of seven and attended the finishing school Château Mont-Choisi in Lausanne, Switzerland. She went to Paris to study art and architecture, but left school at 19 to become a model. By her biological father, Bruni has a half-sister, Consuelo Remmert.

==Career==

===1987–1996: Early career and modelling===

Bruni signed with City Models in 1987, aged 19. Paul Marciano, president and creative director of Guess? Inc., came across her picture among composite cards of aspiring models, and chose her to model with Estelle Lefébure in campaigns for Guess? jeans. Bruni subsequently worked for designers and fashion houses such as Christian Dior, Givenchy, Paco Rabanne, Sonia Rykiel, Christian Lacroix, Karl Lagerfeld, John Galliano, Yves Saint-Laurent, Shiatzy Chen, Chanel, and Versace. By the 1990s, Bruni was among the 20 highest-paid fashion models, earning US$7.5 million in her peak year. While modelling, Bruni dated Eric Clapton, then Mick Jagger. On 11 April 2008, a 1993 nude photograph of Bruni taken during her modelling career sold at auction for US$91,000 (€65,093) – more than 60 times the expected price. She was a modeling subject of a 1999 &quot;trompe-l&#x27;œil&quot; wool-knit dress body painting by Joanne Gair that is included in Gair&#x27;s second book, &quot;Body Painting: Masterpieces by Joanne Gair&quot;.

===1997–2005: Music career and debut album===

In 1997, Bruni quit the world of fashion to devote herself to music. She sent her lyrics to Julien Clerc in 1999, based on which he composed six tracks on his 2000 album &quot;Si j&#x27;étais elle&quot;.

In 2003, her debut album &quot;Quelqu&#x27;un m&#x27;a dit&quot;, produced by Louis Bertignac and released in Europe, was a surprise hit, selling 2 million copies. Three songs from the album appear in Hans Canosa&#x27;s 2005 American film &quot;Conversations with Other Women&quot;, the song &quot;Le Plus Beau du quartier&quot; was used in H&amp;M&#x27;s Christmas 2006 commercial, and the title track was featured in the 2003 movie &quot;Le Divorce&quot; and in the 2009 movie &quot;(500) Days of Summer&quot;. In January 2010, her song &quot;L&#x27;amoureuse&quot; was featured in an episode of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Chuck&quot;, &quot;Chuck vs. First Class&quot;.

In 2005, she wrote the lyrics for 10 out of 12 songs for Louis Bertignac&#x27;s new album &quot;Longtemps&quot;, and performed two duets with him on the album, &quot;Les Frôleuses&quot; and &quot;Sans toi&quot;. 

===2006–2008: &quot;No Promises&quot; and &quot;Comme si de rien n&#x27;était&quot;===

She continued recording after her marriage. She released her third album &quot;Comme si de rien n&#x27;était&quot; on 11 July 2008. The songs are self-penned except for one rendition of &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; and another song featuring Michel Houellebecq&#x27;s poem &quot;La Possibilité d&#x27;une île&quot; set to music. Royalties from the album will be donated to unidentified charitable and humanitarian causes.

===2009–present: &quot;Little French Songs&quot;, return to modelling, and other projects===
Bruni sang for Nelson Mandela&#x27;s 91st birthday on 18 July 2009 at Radio City Music Hall in New York City.

In September 2009, she recorded a duet with Harry Connick, Jr. for the French edition of his album &quot;Your Songs&quot;. They sang The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;And I Love Her&quot;. The album was released in France on 26 October 2009.

Following months of speculation, in a television interview broadcast on 23 November 2009, Bruni revealed that she had accepted a role in a forthcoming Woody Allen film. She admitted her reasoning for embarking on the Paris production; &quot;I&#x27;m not an actress at all. Perhaps I&#x27;ll be completely hopeless, but I can&#x27;t miss an opportunity like this one. When I&#x27;m a grandmother I&#x27;d like to be able to say I made a film with Woody Allen.&quot; 

In September 2010, she contributed a cover of David Bowie&#x27;s &quot;Absolute Beginners&quot; for the War Child charity record &quot;We Were So Turned On: A Tribute to David Bowie&quot; (Manimal Vinyl). They also released the track as a split 7-inch vinyl split with UK legends, Duran Duran.

Italian singer/songwriter Simone Cristicchi&#x27;s entry in the 2010 San Remo Italian Song Festival was the song &quot;Meno Male&quot;, with the chorus lyrics of &quot;Meno male che c&#x27;è Carla Bruni&quot; (&quot;Thank goodness for Carla Bruni&quot;). The song appears to mock Bruni and her husband, but Cristicchi stated in an interview for Italian television weekly &quot;TV Sorrisi e Canzoni&quot; &quot;I use sarcasm to explain our Italian way of always wanting to follow any type of gossip without being interested in real problems.&quot; Bruni was to be a guest singer at the 2010 San Remo festival, but withdrew from participating.

In September 2017, Bruni, along with models Claudia Schiffer, Naomi Campbell, Helena Christensen, and Cindy Crawford, closed the Versace spring/summer 2018 fashion show, which was an homage to the late Gianni Versace.

Bruni presented two three-part music series on BBC Radio 2: &quot;Postcards from Paris&quot; in 2014 and &quot;C&#x27;est La Vie&quot; in 2018.

Bruni is considered a fashion industry &quot;legend&quot;, according to models.com.

In October 2024, Bruni returned to the runway to walk in the first Victoria&#x27;s Secret Fashion Show to take place in six years.

===Political activities===
Following Bruni&#x27;s marriage to President Nicolas Sarkozy on 2 February 2008, she moved into the Élysée Palace for the remainder of Sarkozy&#x27;s five-year term. Bruni was given an office on the east wing of the palace, which was known as &quot;Madame&#x27;s wing&quot; and was assigned a private secretary.

Although constitutionally, Bruni had no official role within the government, she assisted her husband with a number of official obligations. She also accompanied Sarkozy on state visits, most notably, to the United Kingdom, where her presence led to the visit being widely publicized. Bruni also accompanied Sarkozy on a state visit to meet the Dalai Lama in August 2008.

Bruni has represented The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria numerous times as an ambassador and has visited Burkina Faso and Benin while representing the organisation.

In 2010, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine ranked Bruni as the 35th-most powerful woman in the world.

==Personal life==

=== Political views ===
During the 2007 French presidential election, Bruni stated that she would have voted for Ségolène Royal, who was running against her future husband, Nicolas Sarkozy. Bruni said her lack of French citizenship disallowed her from voting, but she would have voted left-wing due to it being a family tradition. In an October 2011 interview with the British newspaper &quot;The Sunday Herald,&quot; Bruni said, &quot;My family have always voted to the left. It&#x27;s tradition. I&#x27;ll never vote right wing.&quot;

In an interview with &quot;Le Point&quot;, Bruni said, when asked about her political leanings, &quot;I am left wing, but I&#x27;m not against my husband or his party. I am not an activist.&quot; In a May 2011 interview with &quot;Le Parisien&quot;, Bruni said she no longer felt left-wing and identified as an ultra-Sarkozyist.

In a 2012 &quot;Vogue&quot; magazine interview, Bruni stated, &quot;My generation doesn&#x27;t need feminism ... I&#x27;m not at all an active feminist. On the contrary, I&#x27;m bourgeois.&quot; On 16 November 2020, she told BBC Radio Five Live: &quot;Of course I&#x27;m a feminist, like every woman is&quot; and &quot;My husband is very much a feminist man.&quot; She also said that she was &quot;not at all a political person.&quot;

In 2012, she stated that she supports same-sex marriage and same-sex adoption.

===Relationship with the Enthovens===
In 2001, Bruni had her first child, son Aurélien, with philosophy professor Raphaël Enthoven. Bruni has been described as having been the mistress of Enthoven&#x27;s father, journalist Jean-Paul Enthoven, when she began her relationship with the younger Enthoven, who was at the time married to novelist Justine Lévy; Bruni claims that she only went out with Jean-Paul Enthoven a few times and was never his lover, and that Raphaël Enthoven was already divorcing his wife when she encountered him months after last seeing Jean-Paul. 

The song &quot;Raphaël&quot; from Bruni&#x27;s album &quot;Quelqu&#x27;un m&#x27;a dit&quot; is about her relationship with Raphaël Enthoven, and Justine Lévy&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Rien de Grave&quot; (published in English in 2005 as &quot;Nothing Serious&quot;) is about the end of her marriage; a character named &quot;Paula&quot; represents Bruni. Bruni told &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; that Raphaël Enthoven ended their relationship in May 2007 because he felt they had become &quot;like friends&quot;, and that they remained on good terms.

=== Spouse of the president of France ===

Bruni met the recently divorced French president Nicolas Sarkozy in November 2007, at a dinner party. After a brief romance, they married on 2 February 2008 at the Élysée Palace in Paris. The marriage is Bruni&#x27;s first and Sarkozy&#x27;s third. Bruni acquired French nationality by naturalization on 10 December 2008. She has since made contradictory statements as to whether she still holds Italian nationality, as well. On 28 April 2014 episode of the &quot;Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, she confirmed that she still holds Italian citizenship. 

Following her marriage to Sarkozy, in February 2008, Bruni continued accompanying him on state visits, including to the United Kingdom in March 2008, which created a sensation in the international press and for the public in both Britain and France. As First Lady, she had an office and staff at her disposal in the East wing of the Élysée Palace.

Controversy arose on the eve of the state visit to the UK, with the publication by Christie&#x27;s auction house of a nude photograph of Bruni taken during her career as a model. The photograph sold for $91,000. Also, great interest began in Bruni&#x27;s wardrobe, which was Christian Dior, seen as a diplomatic choice, since Dior is a French design house, but the wardrobe was designed by John Galliano, a British designer working for Dior. Another controversy was the use of a popular photo of the French President and Bruni in the print advertising of Ryanair. The couple was awarded damages by a French court.

In December 2008, Bruni sued the makers of a bag featuring a nude shot taken during her youth. Clothes designer Pardon produced 10,000 of the shopping bags emblazoned with the nude photo taken in 1993, showing Bruni staring at the camera with her crossed hands covering her crotch.

On 19 October 2011, Bruni gave birth to a daughter, Giulia, in the &quot;Clinique de la Muette&quot;, in Paris.

===Witness tampering===

On 9 July 2024, Bruni-Sarkozy was put on bail after being charged with having put pressure on a witness who accused ex-president Nicolas Sarkozy of having received illegal campaign financing from Libya.

She was suspected of being involved in bribing Lebanese judicial personnel.

<doc id="1086485" wikidata="Q5399755" url="?curid=1086485" title="Essex Junto">
<text>The Essex Junto was a powerful group of New England Federalist Party lawyers, merchants, and politicians, so called because many in the original group were from Essex County, Massachusetts.

== Origins and definition ==
The term was coined as an invective by John Hancock in 1778 to describe the main opponents of a proposed constitution on Massachusetts. The proposed constitution was rejected by the people; the state adopted the Massachusetts Constitution in 1780. John Adams is also frequently credited with the use of the name.

Some politicians identified with the Essex Junto were Timothy Pickering, George Cabot, Fisher Ames, Francis Dana, Nathan Dane, Benjamin Goodhue, Stephen Higginson, Jonathan Jackson, John Lowell, Israel Thorndike, and Theophilus Parsons.

== Early political activity ==
The group supported Alexander Hamilton and a group of Massachusetts radicals led by Timothy Pickering that agitated for the dissolution of the Union or for New England&#x27;s secession. When Hamilton was recruited to the plot to secede New England from the Union, he rejected the offer. Consequently, the Essex Junto tried to gain the support of Aaron Burr, who accepted the offer in hopes of regaining political power removed by his loss against Thomas Jefferson.

== War of 1812 ==
During the War of 1812, the Junto was called &quot;Blue Lights&quot; because of the common belief and reports from the US Navy that they would shine blue lights to alert the British blockading ships of escaping American ships or to alert British ships to come ashore and carry out illegal trade. It supported the Hartford Convention&#x27;s disaffection with the War of 1812, but the claim that it seriously proposed secession of New England is not considered historically accurate.

<text>Bennelong Point, a former island in Sydney Harbour, is a headland that, since the 1970s, is the location of the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.

==History==
Bennelong Point is known to the local Gadigal people of the Eora nation as Dubbagullee.

The point was originally a small tidal island, Tubowgule, later renamed as Bennelong Island, that largely consisted of rocks with a small beach on the western side. The island was located on the tip of the eastern arm of Sydney Cove and was separated from the mainland at high tide. For a brief period in 1788, this relatively isolated protrusion into Port Jackson was called Cattle Point as it was used to confine the few cattle and horses that had been brought from Cape Town by Governor Arthur Phillip with the First Fleet.

The area at that time was also strewn with discarded oyster shells from many long years of gathering by the local aboriginal women. Those shells were regathered by the newly arrived convict women and burnt to make lime for cement mortar. The point was called Limeburners&#x27; Point for that reason, though those shells only furnished enough lime to make a single building, the two-storey Government House.

In the early 1790s, the Aboriginal man Woollarawarre Bennelong— employed as a cultural interlocutor by the British—persuaded Governor of New South Wales, Arthur Phillip, to build a brick hut for him on the point, giving it its colonial name.

In December 1798, a half-moon battery was constructed at the extreme northern end of the Point, mounted with guns from &quot;HMS Supply&quot;.

In the period from 1818 to 1821, the tidal area between Bennelong Island and the mainland was filled with rocks excavated from the Bennelong Point peninsula. The entire area was leveled to create a low platform and to provide suitable stone for the construction of Fort Macquarie. While the fort was being built, a large portion of the rocky escarpment at Bennelong Point was also cut away to allow a road to be built around the point from Sydney Cove to Farm Cove. This was known as Tarpeian Way.

The existence of the original tidal island and its rubble fill were largely forgotten until the late 1950s when both were rediscovered during the excavations related to the construction of the Sydney Opera House. Prior to the Opera House&#x27;s construction, Bennelong Point had housed Fort Macquarie Tram Depot.

<doc id="1086493" wikidata="Q931849" url="?curid=1086493" title="Sol Kerzner">
<text>Solomon &#x27;Sol&#x27; Kerzner, (23 August 1935 – 21 March 2020) was a South African accountant and business magnate. He founded both of South Africa&#x27;s largest hotel groups, the Southern Sun Hotel Group and Sun International. He was also the founder, chairman and CEO of Kerzner International. During his career in the resort industry, he was involved in various political and business controversies.

==Early life and education==

Kerzner was born in Durban to Russian Jewish immigrants. His family owned and operated a chain of kosher hotels. Prior to hospitality, Kerzner played with the Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra and was also an avid boxer becoming the Varsity Welterweight Champion. Kerzner graduated from the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg with a BCom (Hons) in Accounting, and later qualified as a Chartered Accountant. He then took control of the family company.

==Career==

In 1962, he purchased the Astra Hotel in Durban. Following the success of that property, Kerzner built South Africa&#x27;s first five-star graded hotel in Umhlanga, a town north of Durban – he opened this resort in December 1964 which he named the Beverly Hills Hotel.

Following the Beverly Hills, Kerzner built the 450-room Elangeni Hotel (now part of the combined Southern Sun Elangeni &amp; Maharani), overlooking Durban&#x27;s beachfront and, in 1969, in partnership with South African Breweries, he established the chain of Southern Sun Hotels, which by 1983 operated 30 luxury hotels with more than 7,000 rooms. In 1975, Kerzner opened his first hotel outside South Africa on the Indian Ocean island of Mauritius, which he named &quot;Le Saint Géran&quot;.

=== Sun City ===

In 1979, Kerzner developed Sun City, the most ambitious resort project in Africa. Over a period of ten years, he built four hotels, a man-made lake, two Gary Player-designed championship golf courses, and an entertainment centre with an indoor 6,000-seat multi-purpose arena at which he presented many superstars including Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli, Queen and Shirley Bassey. The arena was also the venue of many World Title fights promoted by Bob Arum. In 1985, Kerzner&#x27;s Sun City, South Africa resort was the topic of an anti-Apartheid rock album titled &quot;Sun City&quot; by a group of rock musicians calling themselves Artists United Against Apartheid.

In 1994, following the first multiracial elections in South Africa, Kerzner was asked by incoming President Nelson Mandela to arrange the VIP function at the Presidential Inauguration, which was attended by approximately a thousand people, including many of the world&#x27;s leaders and heads of state.

=== Mohegan Sun ===

In 1996, Kerzner opened the Mohegan Sun casino in Uncasville, Connecticut. In 2000, a second phase of the project was opened including a 1,200-room hotel through a joint venture with the Mohegan Tribe of Connecticut called Trading Cove Associates. TCA relinquished its management of the resort in 2002, but Kerzner through his company received a 5% dividend on the gross revenue generated by Mohegan Sun until 2014. The property is one of the largest gambling and entertainment complexes in the United States.

=== Later career ===

As a result of the success of the Sun City Resort with its Gary Player Country Club golf course (ranked number 1 in South Africa), he became involved in an international hotel, leisure and gambling resorts: most notably for his role as the developer behind the Atlantis Resort in The Bahamas. In that capacity, in late 1994, Kerzner made his first major acquisition outside Africa with the purchase of the Paradise Island Resort in The Bahamas. This 1,150-room resort was in bankruptcy at the time. After acquiring the resort, Kerzner launched a re-development and expansion program. It transformed Paradise Island into a 2,300-room resort; that included one of the world&#x27;s grandest artificial marine habitats and the Caribbean&#x27;s biggest casino.

In 2002, Kerzner launched One&amp;Only Resorts which currently operates numerous properties in The Bahamas, Mexico, Mauritius, the Maldives, South Africa, Dubai, Rwanda and Hayman Island. New projects by the company are also planned for China, Montenegro and Saudi Arabia.

In early 2007, Kerzner expanded Atlantis, Paradise Island with 2 new hotels; The Cove, and The Reef, which added 1,100 new rooms to the property. This expansion was overseen by Alan Leibman, which included 21 retail outlets and new restaurants by celebrity chefs Jean-Georges Vongerichten, Nobu Matsuhisa and Bobby Flay. Kerzner extended the Atlantis brand globally with the development of Atlantis, The Palm, Dubai, with a 1,500-room, water-themed resort opened in late-September 2008 on The Palm Jumeirah; a multibillion-dollar leisure and residential development in Dubai. In September 2009, the &quot;Mazagan Beach Resort&quot; a luxury hotel in El Jadida, Morocco, was inaugurated by Kerzner accompanied by show celebrities.

In October 2013, Kerzner announced that he was building a new Atlantis hotel at Sanya, Hainan Island in China with Fosun International. The 62-hectare resort has 1,300 rooms and a water park like the other Atlantis hotels. The project is reported to have cost $1.63 billion.

== Corruption, collusion and apartheid involvement ==

In 1984, Kerzner made a deal with Leslie Young, the Minister of Finance for the bantustan of Bophutatswana, that any investments by his company, Sun International, that had the effect of advertising apartheid abroad, would be tax-deductible. Sun International paid next to no money for taxes in South Africa due to tax breaks.

In 1987, an agreement between Young and Kerzner stated that 90% of taxes from entertainers in Bophutatswana would go back to Sun International, with any entertainer making more than R26,000 having to pay half their income to Bophutatswana.

In 1990, Kerzner was found to have paid R5 million to the Transkeian Chief George Matanzima for gaming licenses, R2 million of which was said to be a bribe. The case surrounding this was dropped in 1997.

In 1997, Alan Greenblo was banned from publishing a biography on Kerzner, &quot;Kerzner - Unauthorized&quot;. While Kerzner wanted sections of the book to be removed, Witwatersrand Judge Monas Flemming banned it. Sections of the book were published in Noseweek the same year.

Kerzner was a contact listed in Jeffrey Epstein&#x27;s &quot;little black book&quot;, which gained attention following the conviction and death of Epstein, who was a convicted sex offender.

== Personal life==

Kerzner was married four times. His first wife was Maureen Adler and together they had three children: Butch Kerzner, Andrea Kerzner and Beverly Kerzner Mace. His second wife was Shirley Bestbier; they had two children: Brandon Kerzner and Chantal Kerzner Sweeney. She committed suicide soon after the birth of her second child.

His marriage to his third wife, Miss World 1974 Anneline Kriel, ended in divorce after five years. During a lengthy period in the 1990s, he dated the model Christina Estrada and got engaged, but never married her. He married his fourth wife, Heather Murphy in 2000 and they divorced in 2011.

Kerzner&#x27;s son, Howard &quot;Butch&quot; Kerzner died on 11 October 2006 when the helicopter he was traveling in crashed near Sosua, in the Puerto Plata province of the Dominican Republic. He left behind his wife, Vanessa Kerzner, and two children Tai and Kailin. Sol Kerzner&#x27;s daughter, Andrea, is the founder and CEO of Lalela, a charity dedicated to bringing the arts to at-risk youth in South Africa.

Kerzner was awarded the Lifetime Achievement Award for his contributions to the industry during the International Hotel Investment Forum (IHIF) in March 2019.

Kerzner was appointed an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George, which allowed him to have the postnominal letters &#x27;K.C.M.G.&#x27; after his name - but not the prenominal title of &#x27;Sir&#x27; before his name, as he was not a citizen of a Commonwealth realm or the U.K. at the time of his honor being conferred.

==Death==

Kerzner died of cancer on 21 March 2020 in Cape Town.

<text>Ortona (Abruzzese: &quot;&quot;; ) is a coastal town and municipality of the Province of Chieti in the Italian region of Abruzzo, with some 23,000 inhabitants.

In 1943 Ortona was the site of the bloody Battle of Ortona, known as &quot;Western Stalingrad&quot;. A patron saint of Ortona is Saint Thomas the Apostle (Tommaso), whose relics were brought to Ortona in the 13th century by a sailor and are kept in the Cathedral of Saint Thomas.

== History ==
The origins of Ortona are uncertain. Presumably, it was first inhabited by the Frentani, an Italic population. In 2005, during works near the Castle, a Bronze Age settlement was discovered, and the Roman town largely coincided with this first settlement. Some sections of paved roads and urban walls, as well as some archaeological findings are the only remains of this period. Ortona remained a part of the Eastern Roman Empire (later Byzantine Empire) for several centuries, before it was annexed by the Kingdom of the Lombards. In 803 the Franks incorporated Ortona into the county of Chieti. From that date on, the town remained tied to Chieti and its territory.

In 1258 the relics of the Apostle Thomas were brought to Ortona by the sailor Leone Acciaiuoli. In 1302 the Croatian lord George Šubić raided Ortona and extracted tribute from its denizens. In the first half of the 15th century its walls were built, and during this period Ortona fought with the nearby town of Lanciano in a fierce war that ended in 1427. On June 30, 1447, ships from Venice destroyed the port of Ortona; consequently the King of Sicily at that time commissioned the construction of a Castle to dominate the renovated port. In 1582 the town was acquired by Margaret of Parma, daughter of Emperor Charles V and Duchess of Parma. In 1584 Margaret decided to build a great mansion (known as Palazzo Farnese), which was never completed due to her death.

After the establishment of the Kingdom of Italy in 1860, Ortona became one of the first sea resorts on the Adriatic Sea. On 9 September 1943, the royal family of the House of Savoy left German-occupied Italy from the port of Ortona. The defensive Gustav Line was established by the Germans at Ortona (extending towards Cassino on the opposite side of Italy). Ortona offered the Allies a supply port on the Adriatic and was fiercely defended by the Germans. The struggle between the German paratroopers and the 2nd Canadian Infantry Brigade attracted the attention of the international press, leading the Battle of Ortona to be known as &quot;Little Stalingrad.&quot;

== Transport ==
Ortona is served from Port of Ortona, an important port of Adriatic Sea.

== Main sights==
*Cathedral of San Tommaso (relics of saint Thomas the Apostle)
*Cathedral Museum 
*Church of Santa Maria di Costantinopoli 
*Church of Santa Caterina d&#x27;Alessandria 
*Lighthouse
*Medieval Aragona Castle
*Museum of Ortona battle 
*Moro River Canadian War Cemetery
*Trabucchi (fishing machines) on sea

Ortona is home of several beaches that appeal to tourists and one historical museum based on the battle of Ortona. The Abruzzo, Lazio and Molise National Park is not far either.

==International relations==

Ortona is twinned with:
* Cassino, Italy, since 1991
* Volgograd, Russia, since 2013
* Metković, Croatia, since 2016

==People==
* The composer Francesco Paolo Tosti was born in Ortona.
* The pornstar Rocco Siffredi was born in Ortona.

<doc id="1086503" wikidata="Q1808373" url="?curid=1086503" title="Ronan Point">
<text>Ronan Point was a 22-storey tower block in Canning Town in Newham, East London, that partially collapsed on 16 May 1968, only two months after it opened. A gas explosion blew out some load-bearing walls, causing the collapse of one entire corner of the building; four people died and 17 were injured. The nature of the failure (caused by both poor design and poor construction) led to a loss of public confidence in high-rise residential buildings, and major changes in British building regulations resulted.

==Construction==
Ronan Point was part of the wave of tower blocks built in the 1960s as cheap, affordable prefabricated housing for inhabitants of West Ham and other areas of London. The building was named after Deputy Mayor Harry Ronan, former chairman of London Borough of Newham&#x27;s Housing Committee. The tower was built by Taylor Woodrow Anglian using the large panel system building technology, which involves casting large concrete sections off-site and bolting them together to construct the building. The precast system used was the Danish Larsen &amp; Nielsen system.

Construction started in 1966 and was completed on 11 March 1968.

==Collapse==
At approximately 5:45 am on 16 May 1968, resident Ivy Hodge went into her kitchen in flat 90, a corner flat on the 18th floor of the building, and lit a match to light the gas stove for a cup of tea. The match sparked a gas explosion that blew out the load-bearing flank wall, which had been supporting the four flats above. The flank wall fell away, leaving the floors above Hodge&#x27;s living room and bedroom unsupported, causing their collapse. Falling floor slabs from Hodge&#x27;s floor and the floors above stacked onto the floors below, causing a progressive collapse of all of the floors of the living room portions of the south-east units of the building.

The building had just opened, and three of the four flats immediately above Hodge&#x27;s were unoccupied. Four of the 260 residents died immediately and seventeen were injured, including a young mother who was stranded on a narrow ledge when the rest of her living room disappeared. Hodge survived, having been knocked unconscious in her kitchen by the blast. Leaking gas had collected in the hallway outside her kitchen, and the largest area of overpressure from the gas explosion&#x27;s blast wave occurred at this concentration of gas in the hallway, causing the highest pressures of the blast wave to travel outward to the exterior flank wall uninterrupted. The existing overpressure in the kitchen as a result of the gas explosion&#x27;s origin there blunted the higher overpressure caused by the hallway explosion, leaving the walls of the kitchen intact and sparing Hodge&#x27;s life. Hodge&#x27;s stove had also remained intact, and was taken to her new address.

The gas leak was determined to have been caused by a cracked nut connecting the building&#x27;s gas line to Hodge&#x27;s stove, which was believed to have cracked due to being overtightened at the time of installation. The force of the blast also had lifted upward a portion of the ceiling in Hodge&#x27;s unit (i.e., the unit above&#x27;s floor slab) causing loss of the gravity load between the floor slab and flank wall necessary to keep the flank wall anchored to the floor slab. Further, a subsequent investigation determined that mechanical elements of the floor slab/flank wall connection were not properly designed to account for the effects of gravity load changes due to lateral forces such as high winds or explosions. In the immediate aftermath of the collapse, the managing director of Taylor Woodrow Anglian denied that the collapse was related to a failure of the building itself.

Among the dead were Thomas and Pauline Murrell, a married couple living on the top floor. They had refused their allocated flat eight times but ultimately agreed because their former home had been condemned. The low death toll is thought to be due to the early hour of the collapse, when most residents were in their bedrooms, instead of their sitting rooms and kitchens which were affected by the collapse. The day after the collapse saw 3 residents dead, 3 unrecovered, and 3 hospitalized. Those hospitalized included Ivy Hodges for minor burns, and 82 year old Ann Carter, who later died.

==Griffiths inquiry==

In the immediate aftermath of the collapse, the government commissioned an inquiry, led by Hugh Griffiths, QC. It reported on dangers caused by pressure on the walls from explosion, wind, or fire, finding that although the design had complied with the current regulations, the following recommendations should be implemented:
*Gas supplies should be disconnected from existing tall buildings until they have been strengthened
*Consideration should be given to a requirement to notify the gas board of new gas installations
*Consideration should be given to improving ventilation in high blocks
*The regulations for the storage of explosive materials in high blocks should be reviewed
*All blocks over six storeys should be appraised by a structural engineer
*Where necessary high blocks should be strengthened 
*Designers of new tall blocks should design them so they are not susceptible to progressive collapse
*Designers should have regard to recent research on frequency and duration of high wind speeds etc.
*Designers should have regard to the effects of fire on the structural behaviour of the building

==Rebuilding and later demolition==
Ronan Point was partly rebuilt after the explosion, using strengthened joints designed to deal with those issues, and the building regulations were altered to ensure that similar designs would not be permitted in the future. However, public confidence in the safety of residential tower blocks was irreparably shaken, and the public scepticism of Ronan Point was later found to be appropriate. Many residents, even those in unaffected flats, refused to return after the evacuation.

Sam Webb, an architect who had given evidence to the Griffiths inquiry, predicted that after approximately 15 years, Ronan Point would develop structural problems and collapse. Webb&#x27;s concerns eventually led the council to evacuate the building, and then to demolish it in 1986 in a piecemeal manner (rather than, for example, using explosives). When this was done, the extent of the defects found shocked even some of the activists, including Webb himself. It was discovered that most of the mechanical connections between floor slabs and flank walls had not been attached properly during construction. Significant corner-cutting had also been undertaken during the construction, with bolts often missing. Holes that should have been filled with concrete were found stuffed with garbage and newspaper. On the lower floors, cracks were found in the concrete where it had been point-loaded, and it was alleged that the extra pressure on those points during a high wind (such as during the Great Storm of 1987, barely a year after the demolition) would soon have led to building collapse.

==Effect on legislation==
The partial collapse of Ronan Point led to major changes in building regulations. The first of these came with the 5th Amendment to the Building Regulations in 1970. These are now embodied in Part A of the Building Regulations and cover &quot;Disproportionate Collapse&quot;. They require that &quot;the building shall be constructed so that in the event of an accident the building will not suffer collapse to an extent disproportionate to the cause&quot;. They specifically cover pressures which may be caused for example by wind forces, explosions (either internal or external), or vehicle incursions, and note that seismic design may occasionally be required.

Immediately after the publication of the report, the Government brought out interim measures to ensure the safety and integrity of buildings in the event of an explosion. All new buildings of over five storeys constructed after November 1968 were required to be able to resist an explosive force of . Existing buildings were allowed to resist an explosive force of , provided that the gas supply was removed and flats were refitted for electric cooking and heating.

Many other jurisdictions, including the US, have since amended their building codes to require that buildings subject to explosions or other accidents will not collapse to an extent disproportionate to the cause.

Two days after the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017, John Knapton, emeritus professor of structural engineering at Newcastle University, claimed that regulations which came into force in 1971, following lessons learned from Ronan Point, had improved building structural strength in such a way as to prevent the collapse of the Grenfell Tower, which was built in 1974.

==Effect on housing==
In 1985, the Building Research Establishment published a report entitled &quot;The Structure of Ronan Point and other Taylor Woodrow – Anglian buildings&quot; to advise local councils and building owners on checking the structural stability of their blocks. Southwark Council confirmed in 2017 that strengthening work ordered after Ronan Point may not have been carried out on the Ledbury Estate, after structural weaknesses were found that led to the evacuation of four tower blocks.

Within a couple of decades of the collapse of Ronan Point, the public&#x27;s lack of confidence in the construction technique used at Ronan Point, together with the social problems within such developments, led to the demolition of many tower blocks. In particular, the construction technique involved metal bolts which expand when they rust and crack the concrete around them. In 2018, it was reported that two tower blocks on the Broadwater Farm estate in Tottenham, Tangmere House and Northholt House, were structurally unsound and could collapse catastrophically if there is a gas explosion or if a vehicle collides with the base. Both are to be evacuated urgently. Other buildings in Broadwater Farm had less serious problems.

==Legacy==
In May 2018, 50 years after the partial collapse, Ronan Point was the subject of an experimental documentary film, &quot;And Then We Heard Shouts and Cries&quot;, by artist Ricky Chambers. Chambers&#x27; grandparents and mother had lived in flat 87 on the 18th floor of the tower block at the time of the gas explosion.

<text>Last Gasp is a San Francisco–based book publisher with a lowbrow art and counterculture focus. Owned and operated by Ron Turner, for most of its existence Last Gasp was a publisher, distributor, and wholesaler of underground comix and books of all types.

Last Gasp was established in 1970. Although the company came onto the scene a bit later than some of the other underground publishers, Last Gasp continued publishing comics far longer than most of its competitors. In addition to publishing notable original titles like &quot;Slow Death&quot;, &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot;, &quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot;, and &quot;Weirdo&quot;, it also picked up the publishing reins of important titles—such as &quot;Zap Comix&quot; and &quot;Young Lust&quot;—from rivals who had gone out of business.

Although Last Gasp no longer publishes &quot;floppy&quot; comics; the company continues to publish art and photography books, graphic novels, fiction, and poetry, producing 10–15 new titles per year.

== History ==
Last Gasp Eco Funnies was founded in Berkeley, California, in 1970 by San Francisco State University graduate student Ronald E. Turner, with the help of Gary Arlington, to publish the ecologically-themed comics title &quot;Slow Death Funnies&quot; (in conjunction with the first Earth Day). Last Gasp followed &quot;Slow Death Funnies&quot; with the all-female anthology &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe&quot;, spearheaded by Trina Robbins.

Last Gasp incorporated on September 11, 1971. In the time period 1971–1973, Last Gasp published &quot;Air Pirates Funnies&quot; #1–2 and a number of other Air Pirates-related titles, including &quot;The Tortoise and the Hare&quot;, &quot;Dopin&#x27; Dan&quot; #1–3, and &quot;Merton of the Movement&quot;. (Turner insists that he only served as an advisor to the Air Pirates collective, despite them crediting his company as &quot;publisher.&quot;) Considered to be an &quot;enabler&quot; of the Air Pirates infamous Walt Disney parodies, Turner&#x27;s name was added to Disney&#x27;s lawsuit against the collective. Turner quickly settled with Disney, but Air Pirates Dan O&#x27;Neill, Bobby London, and Ted Richards continued fighting, in a case that dragged on for years.

The company&#x27;s success with &quot;Slow Death&quot; and &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe&quot; enabled Last Gasp to expand into distribution, in addition to publishing. The company soon became a major part of the underground comix movement. Sociopolitical themes were explored in Last Gasp series such as Guy Colwell&#x27;s &quot;Inner City Romance&quot; (1972–1979), which portrayed gritty urban tales; &quot;Armageddon&quot; (1973), which focused on anarcho-capitalism; and &quot;Anarchy Comics&quot; (1978), which focused on left-wing politics. In addition to publishing &quot;Wimmen&#x27;s Comix&quot; for much of its run, Last Gasp published a number of other comix with feminist themes, including &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Me, Babe&quot;, &quot;Tits &amp; Clits Comix&quot;, &quot;Twisted Sisters&quot; #1, and &quot;Good Girls&quot;.

In 1972, Last Gasp published Justin Green&#x27;s seminal autobiographical comic &quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot;.

Beginning in 1972, Last Gasp began publishing ongoing titles moving over from other companies; beginning with &quot;Young Lust&quot;, and then Rand Holmes&#x27; &quot;Harold Hedd&quot;. In 1977, the company picked up Joyce Farmer and Lyn Chevely&#x27;s &quot;Tits &amp; Clits Comix&quot;, publishing that series until 1987. Last Gasp published the final three issues of &quot;San Francisco Comic Book&quot; in 1980–1983, and the latter half of &quot;Zap Comix&quot;&#x27; run from 1982 to 2005.

Last Gasp also published &quot;Weirdo&quot; from 1981 to 1993, and &quot;Cherry Poptart&quot; from 1982 to 1992.

In the early 1980s Last Gasp published some of the first books about the West Coast punk rock scene, including a number of titles by Peter Belsito.

Last Gasp moved its headquarters from Berkeley to San Francisco in c. 1975. Starting in 1975, Ron Turner began hosting the annual &quot;Burritos, Beer &amp; Cheer&quot; holiday party at the Last Gasp offices, which was also a fundraiser for the Martin de Porres House of Hospitality, a free soup kitchen located in San Francisco. Last Gasp hosted &quot;Burritos, Beer &amp; Cheer&quot; for more than 30 years.

In the period 2004–2010, Last Gasp published English-language compilations of popular manga titles, including Fumiyo Kouno&#x27;s &quot;Town of Evening Calm, Country of Cherry Blossoms&quot;; Junko Mizuno&#x27;s &quot;Pure Trance&quot;; and Keiji Nakazawa&#x27;s &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot;.

In early December 2016, Last Gasp announced it was ending its comics distribution business to focus solely on book publishing. (As one of the last independent distributors, they handled comics distribution from more than 100 small comics publishers.) As a consequence, the company planned to lay off the bulk of its dozen employees by February 2017.

==Career after politics==
After his retirement from politics, Jayakumar served as Chair of the National University of Singapore Faculty of Law&#x27;s Advisory Council and Patron of the NUS Centre for International Law. He became an emeritus professor at the NUS Faculty of Law, and a consultant at Drew &amp; Napier, one of the Big Four law firms in Singapore. On 1 July 2020, he was appointed pro-chancellor of the National University of Singapore, where he served until 2023. 

On 4 April 2021, during the National Day Awards, Jayakumar was conferred the Order of Temasek (With High Distinction), the nation&#x27;s highest civilian honour, by President Halimah Yacob for his &quot;wide-ranging, invaluable and unique contributions to the well-being and security of Singapore&quot;. In the investiture ceremony, he was praised for having &quot;given his entire life to the service of Singapore&quot; and the citation of his award said: &quot;Uniquely among public servants, Prof Jayakumar brought an exceptionally keen legal mind to bear on a considerable range of issues, from national security and foreign policy to political and constitutional developments.&quot;

== Publications ==
Jayakumar has written and published several books related to his life and experiences in foreign affairs and diplomacy. In 2009, Jayakumar and Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh published the book titled &quot;Pedra Branca: The Road to the World Court&quot;, which covers the territorial dispute between Malaysia and Singapore over Pedra Branca, a small island of strategic value located near the entry point to the Straits of Malacca. 

In 2011, Jayakumar published a book titled &quot;Diplomacy: A Singapore Experience&quot;. The book covers his reflections on many events and episodes during his many years in public service. It also shared behind-the-scenes political decision making that governed Singapore&#x27;s responses during important post-independence events that formed the basis of Singapore&#x27;s foreign policy principles. 

In 2015, he published a memoir titled &quot;Be at the Table or Be on the Menu: A Singapore Memoir&quot;, which covers his early life and his career as a law academic and dean before he entered politics. 

In 2019, Jayakumar, Ambassador-at-Large Tommy Koh and Deputy Attorney-General Lionel Lee launched the book titled &quot;Pedra Branca: Story Of The Unheard Cases&quot;, which recounts how Singapore&#x27;s team prepared in the dispute with Malaysia over the sovereignty of Pedra Branca and also serves as a continuation to &quot;Pedra Branca: The Road to the World Court&quot;. 

In November 2020, Jayakumar introduced his book titled &quot;Governing: A Singapore Perspective&quot;, which covers his views and experiences of Singapore&#x27;s governance, such as how he viewed the Lee family dispute over their 38 Oxley Road home, and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong&#x27;s retirement plan if the COVID-19 crisis has not improved.

<doc id="1086510" wikidata="Q3699902" url="?curid=1086510" title="Lady Cynthia Asquith">
<text>Lady Cynthia Mary Evelyn Asquith (née Charteris; 27 September 1887 – 31 March 1960) was an English writer and socialite, known for her ghost stories and diaries. She also wrote novels, edited a number of anthologies, wrote for children and covered the British Royal family.

==Early life==
Lady Cynthia was born at Clouds House, East Knoyle, Wiltshire on 27 September 1887, one of seven children of Hugo Richard Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss (1857–1937), and Mary Constance Wyndham, of The Souls fame. Among her siblings were Hugo Francis Charteris, Lord Elcho (who married Lady Violet Manners, the daughter of Henry Manners, 8th Duke of Rutland, and was killed in action in the Great War), Guy Lawrence Charteris, Colin Charteris (who died young), Lady Mary Charteris (wife of Capt. Algernon Walter Strickland and, after his death, John George Lyon), Yvo Alan Charteris (also killed in action during the Great War), and Lady Irene Charteris (wife of Ivor Windsor-Clive, 2nd Earl of Plymouth).

Her paternal grandparents were Francis Charteris, 10th Earl of Wemyss and his first wife Lady Anne Frederica Anson (second daughter of Thomas Anson, 1st Earl of Lichfield). Her maternal grandparents were Capt. Hon. Percy Scawen Wyndham MP for Cumberland West (second son of George Wyndham, 1st Baron Leconfield), and the former Madeleine Eden Campbell (sixth daughter of Maj.-Gen. Sir Guy Campbell, 1st Baronet).

==Career==
In 1913, Asquith met D. H. Lawrence in Margate and became a friend and correspondent. She took a position as secretary to the Peter Pan creator J. M. Barrie, with whom she became close friends, continuing to work for him until his death in 1937. Barrie left most of his estate to her, except for the Peter Pan works. Author L. P. Hartley became a lifelong friend after they met in the early 1920s.

Asquith became known for editing &quot;The Ghost Book&quot;, an anthology of supernatural fiction, including work by D. H. Lawrence, Algernon Blackwood, Arthur Machen, Oliver Onions, and May Sinclair.

One of Asquith&#x27;s stories, &quot;The Follower&quot;, was adapted for BBC Radio, along with others by Algernon Blackwood, Marjorie Bowen, and Noel Streatfeild; all were later reprinted in the Cecil Madden anthology &quot;My Grimmest Nightmare&quot; (1935). She contributed to the screenplay of the 1937 film &quot;Dreaming Lips&quot;, which starred Elisabeth Bergner.

In 1957, Asquith appeared as a contestant in the ITV Quiz show &quot;The 64,000 Question&quot; (hosted by Jerry Desmonde) where she won the top prize of £3,200 answering questions on the works of Jane Austen.

==Personal life==
On 28 July 1910, Lady Cynthia married Herbert Asquith (1881–1947), second son of H. H. Asquith, the Liberal Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1908 to 1916, with whom he is sometimes confused. They had three children:

*John Michael Asquith (1911–1937), who suffered mental problems and died in an institution.
*Michael Henry Asquith (1914–2004), who married in 1938 Diana Eveline Montagu Battye, daughter of Lt.-Col. Perceval Lawrence Montagu Battye. They divorced in 1952; he married secondly Helga Brigitta Ebba Elizabeth Ritter, daughter of Dr Walther Sigmund Casimir Ritter, in 1953.
*Simon Roland Anthony Asquith (1919–1973), who married in 1942 Vivien Lawrence Jones, daughter of Sir Lawrence Jones, 5th Baronet and Lady Evelyn Alice Grey (a daughter of Albert Grey, 4th Earl Grey)

Lady Cynthia&#x27;s husband died in Bath on 5 August 1947 aged 66, and Lady Cynthia herself on 31 March 1960, aged 72.

<text>Orissa Jana Congress (Orissa Peoples Congress), generally just called the &quot;Jana Congress&quot;, was a political party in the Indian state of Orissa. The Jana Congress was formed in 1966 when Harekrushna Mahatab (former Orissa Chief Minister) left the Indian National Congress. After the 1967 elections the Jana Congress took part in a coalition government in the state together with Swatantra Party. That government lasted from 1967 to 1969. In the 1971 and 1974 state elections the Jana Congress fared badly, and could only win a single seat. In 1977 the Jana Congress merged into the Janata Party.

<doc id="1086518" wikidata="Q376557" url="?curid=1086518" title="Spada da lato">
<text>The spada da lato (Italian) or side-sword is a type of sword popular in Italy during the Renaissance. It is a continuation of the medieval knightly sword, and the immediate predecessor, or early form, of the rapier of the early modern period. Side-swords were used concurrently with rapiers as well, particularly for military applications, although differentiating swords between civilian and military use was not something that was done in the period when a soldier had to arm himself. Its use was taught in the Dardi school of Italian fencing and others, and was influential on the classical rapier fencing of the 17th century. The equivalent Spanish term, &quot;espada ropera&quot; (&quot;dress sword&quot;) is seen as the origin of the term &quot;rapier&quot;, although this is disputed.
Italian antiquarians use the term &quot;spada da lato&quot; for rapiers typical of the period of c. 1560–1630, the Italian term for the fully developed rapier of the later 17th century is &quot;spada da lato striscia&quot;, or just &quot;spada striscia&quot; &quot;strip-sword&quot;., but the term &quot;rapier&quot; or &quot;rapiera&quot; is also used in modern Italian.

<text>The eastern Orphean warbler (Curruca crassirostris) is a typical warbler of the genus &quot;Curruca&quot;. This species occurs in summer around the Mediterranean, through the Balkans via Turkey, the Caucasus and surrounding regions to Central Asia. It is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa.

At 15–16 cm length—somewhat larger than a blackcap—this is one of the largest species of typical warblers. The adult males have a plain grey back. The bill is long and pointed and the legs black. The male has a dark grey head, black eye mask, and white throat. The iris is white. Females and immatures have a paler head and reddish underparts; their grey back has a brownish tinge. The iris is dark in young birds. It is difficult to visually distinguish from the Western Orphean warbler.

The song is a series of warbling &quot;&quot; and scolding notes. Its song is more varied than that of the western Orphean warbler, approaching the Nightingale in richness.

These small passerine birds are found in open deciduous woodland. 4–6 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush or tree. Like most &quot;warblers&quot;, the eastern Orphean warbler is a nectarivore.

<doc id="1086520" wikidata="Q8664" url="?curid=1086520" title="Rinchinbal Khan">
<text>Rinchinbal (Mongolian: Ринчинбал , ; ), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Ningzong of Yuan (; May 1, 1326 – December 14, 1332), was a son of Kuśala (Emperor Mingzong) who was briefly installed to the throne of the Yuan dynasty of China, but died soon after he was installed to the throne. Apart from Emperor of China, he is also considered the 14th Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, although it was only nominal due to the division of the empire.

==Biography==
He was the second son of Kuśala (Emperor Mingzong) and a younger brother of Toghun Temür (Emperor Huizong). His mother was Babusha of the Naiman tribe, who met Kusala when he lived in exile in Central Asia under the Chagatai Khanate.

When his father Kuśala died and was succeeded by his younger brother Tugh Temür (who is thought to have poisoned Kuśala), Rinchinbal was appointed to Prince of Fu. Tugh Temur made his son Aratnadara heir apparent in January 1331. In order to secure her son&#x27;s throne, Tugh Temur&#x27;s Khatun Budashiri executed Rinchinbal&#x27;s mother, Babusha, and exiled Toghan Temur to Korea. These proved unnecessary, however, Aratnadara died one month after his designation as heir.
Although Tugh Temür had a son named El Tegüs when he died in 1332, it is said that on his deathbed the Khagan expressed remorse for what he had done to his elder brother and his intention to pass the throne to Toghan Temur, Kusala&#x27;s eldest son, instead of his own son. The grand councilor El Temür resisted letting Kuśala&#x27;s eldest son Toghun Temür accede to the throne since he was suspected of having poisoned his father Kuśala. When Tugh Temur&#x27;s widow and El Tegüs&#x27;s mother Budashiri Khatun respected Tugh Temür&#x27;s will of making Kuśala&#x27;s son succeed the throne, the 6 year old Rinchinbal was chosen. While Toghun Temür was kept far away from the capital Dadu, Rinchinbal was in Dadu and had become favored by Tugh Temür. Rinchinbal was enthroned as the new emperor on October 23, 1332, but he died on December 14.

El Temür again asked Budashiri to install El Tegüs but it was declined again. He had no choice but to invite Toghun Temür back from far-away Guangxi in southwest China.

<text>Teramo (; ) is a city and &quot;comune&quot; in the Italian region of Abruzzo, the capital of the province of Teramo.

The city, from Rome, is situated between the highest mountains of the Apennines (Gran Sasso d&#x27;Italia) and the Adriatic coast. The town is located by the confluence of the Vezzola and Tordino rivers, on a hillside area where the terrain features along with the Mediterranean climate make the territory rich in vineyards and olive groves.

The economy of the town is mostly based on activities connected with agriculture and commerce, as well as a sound industrial sector: textiles, foods, engineering, building materials and ceramics. Teramo can be reached from the A14 and the A24 motorways.

==Climate==
The climate in the region is described as fresh-temperate. During the coolest month, which is January, temperatures average around . On the other hand, during the warmest month, July, temperatures average around . In winter, the region experiences significant snowfall, as observed in 2005. Precipitation is not frequent and is mainly concentrated in late spring. Summers in the area are characterised by days of relatively high temperatures.

== Name ==

Interamna (Greek: : Eth. Interamnas, Interamnātis) was the name of several cities in different parts of Italy. Its etymology, already pointed out by Varro and Festus, indicates their position at the confluence of two streams. The form &quot;Interamnium&quot; (Greek: ), and the ethnic form Interamnis are also found, but more rarely. The name referred to the two rivers Vezzola and Tordino, between which it lies.

The name is already defined in extant manuscripts of the &quot;Liber Coloniarum&quot; into Teramne, whence its modern form of Teramo. But in the Middle Ages it appears to have been known also by the name of Aprutium, supposed to be a corruption of Praetutium, or rather of the name of the people Praetutii, applied (as was so often the case in Gaul) to their chief city. Thus the name &quot;Abrutium&quot; is present among the cities of Picenum enumerated by the &quot;Geographer of Ravenna&quot; (iv. 31); and under the Lombards a &quot;comes Aprutii&quot; is mentioned. The name has been retained in that of Abruzzo, now a region of Italy.

== History ==
===Pre Roman Age===
A settlement of the 1st millennium BC and some buildings of ancient Italic tribes were the object of archaeological excavations. The most ancient historical remains were found in the outskirts of the city, precisely in the neighborhood Madonna delle grazie, where, among many, a burial place with a dagger and a halberd were found. Allegedly, the development of the old settlement was due to the commercial center founded by the Etruscan civilization.

According to the Roman author Sextus Julius Frontinus, the ancient Perut or Pretut (meaning &quot;Hill surrounded by waters&quot;) strongly developed in dimensions and importance until it became the capital of the Praetutii tribe.

===Roman age ===

In the battle of Sentinum (295 BC), the Romans defied the Italian confederation (Sabellians, Etrusci, Umbri and their allies the Gauls), starting the Samnite Wars. In 290 BC, the Sabine area, along with the Praetutii’s region was occupied by the legions sent by the consul Manius Curius Dentatus. The city took the Latin name of Interamnia Praetuttiorum or Interamnia Praetutia (&quot;City of the Praetutii between two rivers&quot;). During the reign of Augustus Interamnia is included in the Picenum district. The area of the current province was divided from south to north into the Ager Hatrianus, Ager Praetutianus and Ager Palmense.

After the Second Social War, Interamnia became a municipium. The city lost the status of Municipium because of the participation of Lucius Cornelius Sulla in the Social war (91–88 BC), but the city will subsequently regain it for expressed will of Julius Caesar.

During the Roman age, thanks to its nearness to the capital of the empire, the city lived a prosperous and favorable moment as proven by the numerous mosaics, theater, thermal baths and the amphitheater remains. As historians like Ptolemy, Livy and Pliny remember, the city reached its best period under the emperor Hadrian, with the constructions of the temples dedicated to Mars and Apollo.

===Middle Ages===
Little is known about Teramo in the early Middle Ages, after first destruction of the city in the year 410 by the Visigoths under Alaric I. The Ostrogoths ruled Interamnia 552–554 AD. Right after the Gothic War (6th century), the city became a Byzantine possession. Teramo was included in the Marchia Firmana, part of the Exarchate of Ravenna. Later it was a Lombard fief and part of the Duchy of Spoleto.

In 1129, the city was conquered by the Normans, as part of the County of Apulia. In 1140, it became a possession of Roger II of Sicily, the first King of Sicily. During the strife following Roger&#x27;s coronation, Teramo was destroyed by a Norman force under Robert II of Loritello. Only the tower of Piazza Sant’Anna was saved from this sack; from this moment on it will be called Torre Bruciata (burnt tower). In 1268, the domination of the House of Hohenstaufen, who had inherited Sicily from Roger II&#x27;s line, ended; they were replaced by the House of Anjou.

The ecclesiastical authority of the Aprutina Diocese, led by the bishops Rainaldo Acquaviva, Niccolò degli Arcioni (1317), Stefano da Teramo (1335) and Pietro di Valle (1366) boosted the city&#x27;s economy, as witnessed by the construction of castles, churches, cloisters and palaces along with the great privileges granted by the sovereigns. Within the following two centuries Teramo became part of the Kingdom of Naples.

===Renaissance and modern era ===
The 15th century saw the struggles between the most important families of the city (De Valle and Melatino). The exemplary hanging of 13 followers of Melatino&#x27;s family is still remembered in a stone shield in the very center of the city. The monument represents two heads with their tongues out under the writing “A lo parlare agi mesura” (mind what you say).

During the first years of the century, the tyrant Antonello de Valle was assassinated; his castle, located in what is now Garibaldi Square, was demolished. The legend says that the belligerence between the families ended thanks to the women of the city who proclaimed a strike of affection. Despite the internal struggles, the city lived a very developed cultural period in the century. Artists like Jacobello del Fiore and Nicola da Guardiagrele were called to work in the city, which had commercial relationship with Tuscany and Venice.

After the death of Ferdinand II, Charles II of Spain sold Teramo to the Duke of Atri for 40,000 ducats. The people of Teramo rebelled, but with no result. In 1626 Teramo was struck by an earthquake, followed four years later by the plague. From 1707, after of the War of the Spanish Succession, the Habsburg monarchy rules the whole Kingdom of the Two Sicilies for 27 years. During the Age of Enlightenment Teramo is an active centre of intellectual life, especially with Melchiorre Delfico, a notable poet, composer and Italian philosopher. In 1798 French troops entered Teramo, and though they were initially repulsed by the citizens, they returned a few days later, sacking the whole city.

In 1806, Napoleon defeated the troops of Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies, and Teramo became a French possession until 1815, when it reverted to the Kingdom of Naples. King Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies visited the city in 1832, 1844 and 1847. In 1890, the Observatory of Collurania was founded.

===Contemporary age===
In 1925,the first Italian Psychoanalytic Society was founded in Teramo.

During World War II, on 25 June 1943, German troops arrived in Teramo and proceeded to Bosco Martese where they fought against the men of the Resistance movement. The episode is remembered as the &quot;Battle of Bosco Martese&quot;.

In 1972, the first edition of Interamnia World Cup was held.

The University of Teramo was founded in the city in 1993.

== Main sights ==
The city&#x27;s main attractions include:

*the Cathedral of Saint Berardo, built in 1158 by bishop Guido II, in Romanesque style. It has a portal in Gothic style, finished in 1332 by the Roman master Deodato di Cosma.

== Gastronomy ==

The provincial Teramo gastronomy is known for its variety and richness. Typical ingredients include agnello (lamb), peperoncino (hot pepper), formaggio pecorino (sheep milk cheeses), and slow roasted pork. Common wines are the renowned Montepulciano and Trebbiano d&#x27;Abruzzo.

Typical dishes from Teramo and the surrounding communities include the following:
* scrippelle – This dish is served in the throughout the Teramo province and is somewhat similar to French crêpes, although typically made without milk. There are two common variations. The first is scrippelle &#x27;mbusse – (dialect for scrippelle in brodo or broth) and consists of scrippelle rolled up in Pecorino or Parmesan cheese and served in chicken broth. A second variation is timballo – scrippelle layered with ragù, meat or tiny meatballs (polpettini), various cheeses such as scamorza, and sometimes peas (piselli).
* maccheroni alla chitarra – a flat, stringlike egg pasta which takes its name from the wooden instrument, basically a wooden frame strung with fine metal wire, called a chitarra (guitar), used to cut the pasta.
* mazzarelle – lamb&#x27;s lung and innards wrapped in beet greens or chard and braised in white wine or tomato sauce. Not for the faint of heart and not to be confused with mozzarella cheese.
* virtù – a vegetable soup typically prepared in May of each year to celebrate spiritual redemption and the bountiful virtues of the Earth. It is made with a wide variety of locally grown vegetables and typically includes &quot;annit&quot; (a type of wild fennel).
* tacchino alla canzanese – a dish famous in the nearby provincial town of Canzano. Made by slow baking a turkey in gelatin (an ancient method of preserving meat) and typically served cold.
* vino cotto – a fortified wine, found also in the Marche region, produced by slowly boiling down grape juice before fermentation and aging thus producing a sweet and rich dessert-type of wine. Consumed both straight up and in cooking.
* &quot;caggiunitti&quot; – deep fried almond fritters typically made with chocolate and chestnuts.
* bocconotti – traditional Teramo dish, known with different variations in the rest of Italy, sweet typical of Montorio Al Vomano (city in the province of Teramo) covered with shortcrust pastry and stuffed with grape jam, chocolate and toasted almonds.

<text>Imaging radar is an application of radar which is used to create two-dimensional images, typically of landscapes. Imaging radar provides its light to illuminate an area on the ground and take a picture at radio wavelengths. It uses an antenna and digital computer storage to record its images. In a radar image, one can see only the energy that was reflected back towards the radar antenna. The radar moves along a flight path and the area illuminated by the radar, or footprint, is moved along the surface in a swath, building the image as it does so.

Digital radar images are composed of many dots. Each pixel in the radar image represents the radar backscatter for that area on the ground (terrain return): brighter areas represent high backscatter, darker areas represents low backscatter.

The traditional application of radar is to display the position and motion of typically highly reflective objects (such as aircraft or ships) by sending out a radiowave signal, and then detecting the direction and delay of the reflected signal. Imaging radar on the other hand attempts to form an image of one object (e.g. a landscape) by furthermore registering the intensity of the reflected signal to determine the amount of scattering. The registered electromagnetic scattering is then mapped onto a two-dimensional plane, with points with a higher reflectivity getting assigned usually a brighter color, thus creating an image.

Several techniques have evolved to do this. Generally they take advantage of the Doppler effect caused by the rotation or other motion of the object and by the changing view of the object brought about by the relative motion between the object and the back-scatter that is perceived by the radar of the object (typically, a plane) flying over the earth. Through recent improvements of the techniques, radar imaging is getting more accurate. Imaging radar has been used to map the Earth, other planets, asteroids, other celestial objects and to categorize targets for military systems.

==Description==

An imaging radar is a kind of radar equipment which can be used for imaging. A typical radar technology includes emitting radio waves, receiving their reflection, and using this information to generate data. For an imaging radar, the returning waves are used to create an image. When the radio waves reflect off objects, this will make some changes in the radio waves and can provide data about the objects, including how far the waves traveled and what kind of objects they encountered. Using the acquired data, a computer can create a 3-D or 2-D image of the target.

Imaging radar has several advantages. It can operate in the presence of obstacles that obscure the target, and can penetrate ground (sand), water, or walls.

==Time-Frequency Domain techniques==

Time-Frequency Domain techniques are essential in imaging radar to analyze and process signals that vary in both time and frequency. Radar signals are often non-stationary due to moving targets or environmental changes. Time-Frequency Domain techniques provide insights into how signal characteristics (e.g., frequency) evolve over time, enabling better understanding and extraction of target information.

Common Methods for Time-Frequency Analysis：
==Applications==

Applications include: surface topography &amp; coastal change; land use monitoring, agricultural monitoring, ice patrol, environmental monitoring;weather radar- storm monitoring, wind shear warning;medical microwave tomography; through wall radar imaging; 3-D measurements, etc.

=== Through wall radar imaging ===
Wall parameter estimation uses Ultra Wide-Band radar systems. The handle M-sequence UWB radar with horn and circular antennas was used for data gathering and supporting the scanning method.

===3-D measurements===
3-D measurements are supplied by amplitude-modulated laser radars—Erim sensor and Perceptron sensor. In terms of speed and reliability for median-range operations, 3-D measurements have superior performance.

==Techniques and methods==
Current radar imaging techniques rely mainly on synthetic aperture radar (SAR) and inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging. Emerging technology utilizes monopulse radar 3-D imaging.

===Real aperture radar===

Real aperture radar (RAR) is a form of radar that transmits a narrow angle beam of pulse radio wave in the range direction at right angles to the flight direction and receives the backscattering from the targets which will be transformed to a radar image from the received signals.

Usually the reflected pulse will be arranged in the order of return time from the targets, which corresponds to the range direction scanning.

The resolution in the range direction depends on the pulse width. The resolution in the azimuth direction is identical to the multiplication of beam width and the distance to a target.

====AVTIS radar====
The AVTIS radar is a 94 GHz real aperture 3D imaging radar. It uses Frequency-Modulated Continuous-Wave modulation and employs a mechanically scanned monostatic with sub-metre range resolution.

===Laser radar===

Laser radar is a remote sensing technology that measures distance by illuminating a target with a laser and analyzing the reflected light.

Laser radar is used for multi-dimensional imaging and information gathering. In all information gathering modes, lasers that transmit in the eye-safe region are required as well as sensitive receivers at these wavelengths.

3-D imaging requires the capacity to measure the range to the first scatter within every pixel. Hence, an array of range counters is needed. A monolithic approach to an array of range counters is being developed. This technology must be coupled with highly sensitive detectors of eye-safe wavelengths.

To measure Doppler information requires a different type of detection scheme than is used for spatial imaging. The returned laser energy must be mixed with a local oscillator in a heterodyne system to allow extraction of the Doppler shift.

===Synthetic aperture radar (SAR)===

Synthetic-aperture radar (SAR) is a form of radar which moves a real aperture or antenna through a series of positions along the objects to provide distinctive long-term coherent-signal variations. This can be used to obtain higher resolution.

SARs produce a two-dimensional (2-D) image. One dimension in the image is called range and is a measure of the &quot;line-of-sight&quot; distance from the radar to the object. Range is determined by measuring the time from transmission of a pulse to receiving the echo from a target. Also, range resolution is determined by the transmitted pulse width. The other dimension is called azimuth and is perpendicular to range. The ability of SAR to produce relatively fine azimuth resolution makes it different from other radars. To obtain fine azimuth resolution, a physically large antenna is needed to focus the transmitted and received energy into a sharp beam. The sharpness of the beam defines the azimuth resolution. An airborne radar could collect data while flying this distance and process the data as if it came from a physically long antenna. The distance the aircraft flies in synthesizing the antenna is known as the synthetic aperture. A narrow synthetic beam width results from the relatively long synthetic aperture, which gets finer resolution than a smaller physical antenna.

===Inverse aperture radar (ISAR)===

Inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) is another kind of SAR system which can produce high-resolution on two- and three-dimensional images.

An ISAR system consists of a stationary radar antenna and a target scene that is undergoing some motion. ISAR is theoretically equivalent to SAR in that high-azimuth resolution is achieved via relative motion between the sensor and object, yet the ISAR moving target scene is usually made up of non cooperative objects.

Algorithms with more complex schemes for motion error correction are needed for ISAR imaging than those needed in SAR. ISAR technology uses the movement of the target rather than the emitter to make the synthetic aperture. ISAR radars are commonly
used on vessels or aircraft and can provide a radar image of sufficient quality for target recognition. The ISAR image is often adequate to discriminate between various missiles, military aircraft, and civilian aircraft.

====Disadvantages of ISAR====

# The ISAR imaging cannot obtain the real azimuth of the target
# There sometimes exists a reverse image. For example, the image formed of a boat when it rolls forwards and backwards in the ocean.
# The ISAR image is the 2-D projection image of the target on the Range-Doppler plane which is perpendicular to the rotating axis. When the Range-Doppler plane and the coordinate plane are different, the ISAR image can not reflect the real shape of the target. Thus, the ISAR imaging can not obtain the real shape information of the target in most situations.
Rolling is side to side. Pitching is forward and backwards, yawing is turning left or right.

===Monopulse radar 3-D imaging technique===

Monopulse radar 3-D imaging technique uses 1-D range image and monopulse angle measurement to get the real coordinates of each scatterer. Using this technique, the image doesn&#x27;t vary with the change of the target&#x27;s movement. Monopulse radar 3-D imaging utilizes the ISAR techniques to separate scatterers in the Doppler domain and perform monopulse angle measurement.

Monopulse radar 3-D imaging can obtain the 3 views of 3-D objects by using any two of the three parameters obtained from the azimuth difference beam, elevation difference beam and range measurement, which means the views of front, top and side can be azimuth-elevation, azimuth-range and elevation-range, respectively.

Monopulse imaging generally adapts to near-range targets, and the image obtained by monopulse radar 3-D imaging is the physical image which is consistent with the real size of the object.

=== 4D imaging radar ===
4D imaging radar leverages a Multiple Input Multiple Output (MiMo) antenna array for high-resolution detection, mapping and tracking of multiple static and dynamic targets simultaneously. It combines 3D imaging with Doppler analysis to create the additional dimension – velocity.A 4D imaging radar system measures the time of flight from each transmitting (Tx) antenna to a target and back to each receiving (Rx) antenna, processing data from the numerous ellipsoids formed. The point at which the ellipsoids intersect – known as a hot spot - reveals the exact position of a target at any given moment.
Its versatility and reliability make 4D imaging radar ideal for smart home, automotive, retail, security, healthcare and many other environments. The technology is valued for combining all the benefits of camera, LIDAR, thermal imaging and ultrasonic technologies, with additional benefits: 

* Resolution: the large MiMo antenna array enables accurate detection and tracking of multiple static and dynamic targets simultaneously.
* Cost efficiency: 4D imaging radar costs around the same as a 2D radar sensor, but with immense added value: richer data, higher accuracy and more functionality, while offering an optimal price-performance balance.
* Robustness and privacy: There are no optics involved, so this technology is robust in all lighting and weather conditions. 4D imaging radar does not require line of sight with targets, enabling its operation in darkness, smoke, steam, glare and inclement weather. It also ensures privacy and discreet surveillance by design, an increasingly important concern across all industries.

<text>Edward Dahlberg (July 22, 1900 – February 27, 1977) was an American novelist, essayist, and autobiographer.

==Background==
Edward Dahlberg was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Elizabeth Dahlberg. Together, mother and son led a vagabond existence until 1905 when she operated the Star Lady Barbershop in Kansas City. Edward was sent to a Catholic orphanage in Kansas City at the age of six for one year. In April 1912, Dahlberg was sent to the Jewish Orphan Asylum in Cleveland, Ohio, where he lived until 1917. He eventually attended the University of California, Berkeley (1922–23) and Columbia University (B.S. in philosophy. 1925).

==Career==
Dahlberg enlisted in the U.S. Army during World War I, in which he lost the use of an eye after being struck with a rifle butt. In the late 1920s, Dahlberg became part of the expatriate group of American writers living in Paris. His first novel, &quot;Bottom Dogs&quot;, was based on his childhood experiences at the orphanage and his travels in the American West; it was published in London with an introduction by D. H. Lawrence. With his advance money, Dahlberg returned to New York City and resided in Greenwich Village. In 1933 he visited Germany, where he wrote anti-Nazi articles for &quot;The Times&quot; and counseled many German intellectuals, Jews, communists and anarchists to flee Germany. In 1934 he published the first American anti-Nazi novel, &quot;Those Who Perish&quot;. From the 1940s onwards, Dahlberg made his living as an author and also taught at various colleges and universities. From 1944 to 1948 he taught at Boston University. In 1948, he taught briefly at the experimental Black Mountain College. He was replaced on the staff by his friend and fellow author, Charles Olson.

During his years as an expatriate writer in 1920s Paris, he knew James Joyce, Samuel Beckett, Sean O&#x27;Casey, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, W. B. Yeats, D. H. Lawrence and many others. A proletarian novelist of the 1930s, a spokesman for a fundamental humanism in the 1940s, he was an important member and editor for the Stieglitz Group, which promoted human rights all over the world. He spoke out against the mistreatment of African Americans, Indigenous Americans (Native Americans), Jews, immigrants, and workers. He was jailed three or four times for standing up to inhumanity. For a number of years, Dahlberg devoted himself to literary study. His extensive readings of the works of Dante, Shakespeare, Thoreau, Sir Thomas Browne, Robert Burton, Isaac D&#x27;Israeli, and many others resulted in a writing style quite different from the social realism that characterized his earlier writing.

He moved to the Danish island of Bornholm in 1955 while working on &quot;The Flea of Sodom&quot;. &quot;The Sorrows of Priapus&quot; was published in 1957, becoming his most successful book thus far. He later moved to Sóller, on Mallorca, while working on &quot;Because I Was Flesh&quot;, an autobiography which was published in 1964 and which was nominated for the National Book Award. During the 1960s and 1970s, he became quite prolific and further refined his unique style through the publication of poetry, autobiographical works, fiction and criticism. He also lived in Dublin and Wicklow, London, Madrid, Malaga, Mexico City and the Seychelles.

==Personal life==
In 1942 he married Winifred Donlea O&#x27;Carroll. Winifred had two children from her previous marriage to the writer and professor Harry Thornton Moore. Edward and Winifred had two children together. His second marriage was to R&#x27;lene LaFleur Howell in 1950 and his third, in 1967, to his longtime mistress, Julia Lawlor. Edward, R&#x27;lene, and Julia lived in Dublin from the early 1960s to the early 1970s where Edward was a member of an Irish literary group that met at McDaid&#x27;s Pub near Trinity College, Dublin. Members of this group included Frank O&#x27;Connor, Brendan Behan and Dominic Behan, Patrick Kavanagh, James Liddy, Garech Browne, Patrick Galvin and occasionally Frank McCourt and many others, with music often provided by The Dubliners. In 1968, he was elected to the National Institute of Arts and Letters. In 1976, he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship. Dahlberg died in Santa Barbara, California, on February 27, 1977.

==Legacy==
Dahlberg is the subject of the title essay of Jonathan Lethem&#x27;s &quot;The Disappointment Artist&quot;, a 2006 essay collection. In his 2005 memoir &quot;Teacher Man&quot;, Frank McCourt remembered Dahlberg as an exceptionally belittling personality who enjoyed bullying his party guests. McCourt recounted that on their first meeting, Dahlberg insulted McCourt unprovoked and then threw McCourt out of Dahlberg’s cocktail party.

<text>Parthenocissus quinquefolia, known as Virginia creeper, Victoria creeper, five-leaved ivy, or five-finger, is a species of flowering vine in the grape family, Vitaceae. It is native to eastern and central North America, from southeastern Canada and the eastern United States west to Manitoba and Utah, and south to eastern Mexico and Guatemala.

==Etymology==
&quot;Parthenocissus&quot; is derived from Greek and means &quot;virgin ivy&quot;. &quot;Quinquefolia&quot; means &quot;five-leaved&quot;. &quot;Quinque&quot; – &quot;five&quot; and &quot;folia&quot; – &quot;foliage&quot;, &quot;leaves&quot;.

==Names==
The name &quot;Virginia creeper&quot;, referring to one of its native locations, is also used for the whole genus &quot;Parthenocissus&quot;, and for other species within the genus. The name &quot;Parthenocissus&quot; is from the Greek literally meaning &quot;virgin ivy&quot;, and may derive from the common English name of this species. It is not closely related to the true ivy, &quot;Hedera&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;quinquefolia&quot; means &quot;five-leaved&quot;, referring to the leaflets on each compound (palmate) leaf.

This plant is also known in North America as woodbine, although woodbine can refer to other plant species.

==Description==

&quot;Parthenocissus quinquefolia&quot; is a prolific deciduous climber, reaching heights of in the wild. It climbs smooth surfaces using small forked tendrils tipped with small strongly adhesive pads in size.

===Leaves===
The leaves are palmately compound, composed of five leaflets (rarely three leaflets, particularly on younger vines, and sometimes seven) joined from a central point on the leafstalk, and range from (rarely to ) across. The leaflets have a toothed margin. Seedlings have heart-shaped cotyledon leaves. The species is often confused with &quot;P. vitacea&quot; or &quot;False Virginia creeper&quot;, which has the same leaves, but does not have the adhesive pads at the end of its tendrils.

It is sometimes mistaken for &quot;Toxicodendron radicans&quot; (poison ivy), despite having five leaflets (poison ivy has three). While the leaves of &quot;P. quinquefolia&quot; do not produce urushiol, the sap within the leaves and stem contains raphides (needle-shaped crystals of calcium oxalate) which can puncture the skin causing irritation and blisters in sensitive people.

The leaves sometimes turn a decorative bright red in the fall.

===Flowers and berries===
The flowers are small and greenish, produced in inconspicuous clusters in late spring, and mature in late summer or early fall into small hard purplish-black berries diameter. These berries contain toxic amounts of oxalic acid and have been known to cause kidney damage and death to humans. The berries are not toxic to birds and provide an important winter food source for many bird species.

==Cultivation and uses==

&quot;Parthenocissus quinquefolia&quot; is grown as an ornamental plant, because of its ability to rapidly cover walls and buildings, and its deep red to burgundy fall (autumn) foliage. It can easily be propagated by stem cuttings taken in spring. 

It is frequently seen covering telephone poles or trees. It may kill other plants it covers by shading its support and thus limiting the supporting plants&#x27; ability to photosynthesize. With its aggressive growth, it can overburden slower-growing understory trees with its weight, damaging them. Its ability to propagate via its extensive root system makes it difficult to eradicate.

In the UK, this plant is listed on Schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 as an invasive non-native species. While this does not prevent it from being sold in the UK, or from being grown in gardens, the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) encourages those that do grow it to take great care with managing it and with disposing of unwanted material. The RHS also encourages gardeners to find alternative plants to grow to those listed on Schedule 9.

&quot;Parthenocissus quinquefolia&quot; can be used as a shading vine for buildings on masonry walls. Because the vine, like its relative &quot;P. tricuspidata&quot; (Boston ivy), adheres to the surface by disks rather than penetrating roots, it does not harm the masonry but will keep a building cooler by shading the wall surface during the summer. As with ivy, ripping the plant from the wall will leave the adhesive disks behind. If the plant clings to fragile surfaces it can first be killed by severing the vine from the root. The adhesive pads will then eventually deteriorate and release their grip. 

The plant should be trimmed regularly to keep it from growing into areas where it is not wanted. If allowed to penetrate into the wall of a frame house, it will grow upward within the wall until it finds a place to emerge.

<doc id="1086535" wikidata="Q672993" url="?curid=1086535" title="Guan Xing">
<text>Guan Xing ( third century), courtesy name Anguo, was an official of the state of Shu Han in the Three Kingdoms period of China.

==History==
He was the second son of Guan Yu and a younger brother of Guan Ping.

Little information about Guan Xing is found in historical records. The biography of Guan Yu in the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; contains only a few lines on Guan Xing. In his youth, Guan Xing was knowledgeable, and Zhuge Liang saw him as an exceptional talent. When he reached adulthood (around 19 years old), he served as an official in Shu Han, but died some years later. Guan Xing held the peerage of the Marquis of Hanshou Village (漢壽亭侯), which he inherited from his father. His cause of death was not documented. He had two known sons – Guan Tong (關統) and Guan Yi (關彝).

Guan Xing appears as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, in which he plays a significant role after the death of his father.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
Guan Xing plays a significant role in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period of China.

In Chapter 81, Guan Xing competes with Zhang Bao, Zhang Fei&#x27;s son, for the position of leading the vanguard force just before the Battle of Yiling. However, Liu Bei stops them and orders them to become oath brothers in the same manner he did with their fathers many years ago. The two of them then join Wu Ban, who leads the vanguard force into battle.

In Chapter 83, Guan Xing slays Pan Zhang, the Wu general who captured his father during the Wu invasion of Jing Province, and retrieves his father&#x27;s weapon, the Green Dragon Crescent Blade. Later, he executes Mi Fang and Fu Shiren before an altar dedicated to Guan Yu.

In Chapter 91, Guan Xing serves as Commander of the Left Guard (帳前左護衛使) and Prancing Dragon General (龍驤將軍) in the Shu army. He follows Zhuge Liang on the Northern Expeditions against Shu&#x27;s rival state Wei. He dies of illness in Chapter 102.

==In popular culture==
Guan Xing is first introduced as a playable character in the eighth instalment of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series.

Guan Xing&#x27;s appointment and the Northern Expeditions are depicted in the 2008 film &quot;Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon&quot;.

<doc id="1086537" wikidata="Q7496" url="?curid=1086537" title="Emperor Ningzong">
<text>Emperor Ningzong of Song (19 November 1168 – 17 September 1224), personal name Zhao Kuo, was the 13th emperor of the Song dynasty of China and the fourth emperor of the Southern Song dynasty. He reigned from 1194 until his death in 1224.

He was the second son and the only surviving child of his predecessor Guangzong and like his father, Ningzong was weak-minded; easily dominated by women. During Ningzong&#x27;s reign, he had built 75 commemorative shrines and steles, the most in Song history. He was a great patron of art, promoting artists such as Liang Kai and Ma Yuan to painter-in-waiting and writing poems about their paintings. Upon Ningzong&#x27;s death, a minor official and a remote relative of Ningzong became Emperor Lizong.

== Reign ==
He was noted for the cultural and intellectual achievements made during his reign. In particular, Zhu Xi wrote some of his most famous Neo-Confucianist works during this period. However, Emperor Ningzong was known for his aversion towards the spread of Neo-Confucianism in his imperial court due to the influence of his chancellor Han Tuozhou and on the political side, however, Emperor Ningzong saw his government being plagued by rising inflation that threatened the economy and the military advances by the Jurchens from the north during the wars between the Song dynasty and Jurchen-led Jin dynasty.

In absence of a son, he adopted a relative named Zhao Xun in 1197 who was only 6 years old.

In 1198, Neo-Confucianism was banned for two years until the ban was repelled in 1202.

== Song Invasion of Jin ==
As the Jin were weakening because of natural disasters, Ningzong&#x27;s chancellor Han Tuozhou continually provoked the weak Jin by launching raids. War against the Jin was officially declared on June 14, 1206, by Han Tuozhou. The war was a disaster. Despite the Jin&#x27;s weakness due to the natural disasters, it repulsed the Song attacks and even counter-attacked. To make things worse, Ningzong was not interested in the war effort and morale was low. There was not enough supplies and many of the army deserted. Wu Xi (吳曦; d. 1207), the governor-general of Sichuan, defected to the Jin in December 1206. This was bad, as Wu was holding the western front, however, Song loyalists assassinated Wu on March 29, 1207, before Jin troops could take control of the surrendered territories. Fighting continued in 1207, but by the end of that year the war was at a stalemate. The Song was now on the defensive, while the Jin failed to make gains in Song territory. The failure of Han Tuozhou&#x27;s aggressive policies led to his demise. On December 15, 1207, Han was beaten to death by the Imperial Palace Guards.

== Peace ==
A peace treaty was signed on November 2, 1208, and the Song tribute to the Jin was reinstated. The Song annual indemnity increased by 50,000 taels of silver and 50,000 packs of fabric. The treaty also stipulated that the Song had to present to the Jin the head of Han Tuozhou, who the Jin held responsible for starting the war. The heads of Han and Su were severed from their exhumed corpses, exhibited to the public, then delivered to the Jin finally ending the war.

In 1210, the Mongols, formerly a Jin tributary, ended their vassalage and attacked the Jin in 1211. In light of this event, the Song court debated ending tributary payments to the weakened Jin, but they chose to avoid antagonizing the Jin. As the Mongols expanded, the Jin suffered territorial losses and attacked the Song in 1217 to compensate for their shrinking territory. The Jin continued attacking the Song until they agreed to a peace treaty and the Jin returned home. However, the Song would never regain their lost land.

In 1220, Emperor Ningzong&#x27;s adopted heir Zhao Xun died from dysentery. Zhao Xun was only 29 years old. Shi Miyuan decided when Ningzong died, another relative named Zhao Hong was to succeed him but Zhao Hong was never placed as heir-apparent due to conflicts with Shi Miyuan and when Ningzong died, he was replaced by Zhao Yun, the future Emperor Lizong.

Emperor Ningzong fell ill before dying a few days later in 1224. Ningzong may have been poisoned. It is also worth mentioning that Ningzong was physically weak: his official portrait showing him as nearly emaciated, suggesting physical ailments of some gravity. He was succeeded by another relative named Zhao Yun as all of Ningzong&#x27;s children died young.

== The Emperor&#x27;s woman ==
He was a good monarch but sickly at times and this allowed his wife the Empress Yang to exploit his inadequacies and become the de facto ruler of the Empire for nearly 30 years.

==Criticism on fiscal policy==
Ye Shi criticized the taxation system during the reign of Emperor Ningzong as a &quot;ruthless extortion&quot;. He stated:

Ye Shi pushed for fiscal conservatism, while many Confucian moralists supported fiscal expansion.

<text>Herbert Dixon Asquith (11 March 1881 – 5 August 1947) was an English poet, novelist, and lawyer. Nicknamed &quot;Beb&quot; by his family, he was the second son of H. H. Asquith, British Prime Minister and the younger brother of Raymond Asquith.

Asquith was greatly affected by his service with the Royal Artillery in World War I. His poems included &quot;The Volunteer&quot; and &quot;The Fallen Subaltern&quot;, the latter being a tribute to fallen soldiers. His poem &quot;Soldiers at Peace&quot; was set to music by Ina Boyle. His novels include the best-selling &quot;Young Orland&quot; (set during and after the First World War), &quot;Wind&#x27;s End&quot;, &quot;Mary Dallon&quot;, and &quot;Roon&quot;.

In 1910, he married Lady Cynthia Charteris, who was also a writer. She was the eldest daughter of Hugo Charteris, 11th Earl of Wemyss, and his wife, Mary Constance Wyndham. They had three sons.

<text>New Amsterdam () is the regional capital of East Berbice-Corentyne, Guyana and one of the country&#x27;s largest towns. It is from the capital, Georgetown and located on the eastern bank of the Berbice River, upriver from its mouth at the Atlantic Ocean, and immediately south of the Canje River. New Amsterdam&#x27;s population is 17,329 inhabitants as of 2012.

==History==

New Amsterdam has its origins in a village which grew up alongside Fort Nassau in the 1730s and 1740s. The first Nieuw Amsterdam, as it was called then, was situated about up the Berbice River on the right bank. Before the 1763 slave uprising it comprised a Court of Policy building, a warehouse, an inn, two smithies, a bakery, a Lutheran church and a number of houses, among other buildings. Built in 1740 by the Dutch, New Amsterdam was first named Fort Sint Andries. It was made seat of the Dutch colonial government in 1790. In 1803 it was taken over by the British.

The little township was a pioneer in several by-laws; it boasted the first sanitation regulations on record (no privies near the public path, drains to be dug and places kept weeded) and the first price controls in the only hostelry in town as well as alcoholic beverages, including madeira, jenever, kilthum (the forerunner of rum) and even a drink made by the Amerindians. Of course, alcohol was not considered an indulgence in those days, but rather a necessity, since it was erroneously believed that it warded off diseases like malaria, which it was claimed came from exposure to &#x27;miasmas&#x27;.

In March 1763, the rebel leader Cuffy made the Court of Policy building in the little town his headquarters, and on either side of its doorway he placed two cannon, which had been repaired for him by the blacksmith Prins. When the revolutionaries were forced to retreat upriver in 1764, New Amsterdam was torched under the supervision of Prins, and only the brick Lutheran church survived. After the uprising was crushed, he was charged with arson and executed.

While the village was rebuilt afterwards, by the 1770s it was already becoming apparent that it had ceased to be the centre of the colony. The planters had begun to move to the more fertile soils of the lower river, leaving the township somewhat isolated upstream. At first the Dutch authorities had some grandiose plans to construct imposing government buildings there - plans which can still be seen in the State Archives in The Hague. However, eventually they had to recognize that such development would be futile in a context where Berbice&#x27;s economic activity was centred on the lower river, and in 1785 they took a decision to relocate the town to the mouth of the Canje.

By June 1790, the authorities were ready for private residents, and in January of the following year they published an ordinance laying down the conditions for the granting of house lots in the present New Amsterdam. Each resident had to empolder his land and dig drainage ditches, and anyone who had not built a house within six months of the government being transferred from upstream, was to lose his lot.

Five years later, Berbice&#x27;s capital fell into British hands, although not all its early visitors from that quarter of Europe were impressed by its appearance. Gradually, however, it acquired a character of its own, and to its credit it still boasts (among many other advantages) what is arguably the best example of Cesar Castellani&#x27;s architecture extant, namely, the New Amsterdam Public Hospital (The Palms in Georgetown is another example of his work).

In 1831, New Amsterdam lost its status as a capital, when the two colonies of Berbice and Essequibo/Demerara were combined into one to become British Guiana.

The present town is fairly small, consisting of three main roads with about a dozen cross streets. It has a mayor, Kirt Wynter, and a thriving market. From New Amsterdam you can get to Crabwood Creek (about away) via the Courantyne River or to the East Canje area of Berbice. A road also leads up the Berbice River bank to the town of Mara about south.

==Points of interest==
New Amsterdam serves as a port and has a government-run hospital. The town has many old colonial buildings, some dating back to the time of Dutch colonisation. Mission Chapel has been designated a National Heritage Site.

The main schools in New Amsterdam are Berbice High School, Berbice Educational Institute, Vryman&#x27;s Erven Secondary, Tutorial Academy, and New Amsterdam Secondary formerly known as New Amsterdam Multilateral High School (opened in 1975).

The Esplanade is the name of an open public ground west of Esplanade Road and immediately opposite The Gardens. It was a picnic resort and rendezvous for the people of Berbice. The bandstand featured the British Guiana Militia Band.

==Travel==
There are several hotels in the town, including Church View Guest House, Astor Hotel, Little Rock Hotel, Leisure Inn Hotel, The Penguin International Hotel, and the Parkway Hotel. The newly built Little Rock Suites on Main Street (Not to be confused with Little Rock Hotel in Vryman&#x27;s Erven).

In December 2008, travel to New Amsterdam was made easier by the opening of the Berbice Bridge providing a direct connection to Georgetown.

==Utilities ==

New Amsterdam has three television stations: DTV-8, located in the heart of the town, Little Rock Television Station (LRTVS) Channel 10 located in Vryman&#x27;s Erven, TVG located in St. Ann Street. LRTVS was the first television station in Berbice. The first radio station broadcasting from New Amsterdam was also launched in 2014 by Little Rock and broadcasts on FM 88.5 MHz.

==Climate==
New Amsterdam has a tropical rainforest climate (Af) with heavy rainfall year-round.

<doc id="1086547" wikidata="Q1475717" url="?curid=1086547" title="Test automation">
<text>In software testing, test automation is the use of software separate from the software being tested to control the execution of tests and the comparison of actual outcomes with predicted outcomes. Test automation can automate some repetitive but necessary tasks in a formalized testing process already in place, or perform additional testing that would be difficult to do manually. Test automation is critical for continuous delivery and continuous testing.

==General approaches==
There are many approaches to test automation, however below are the general approaches used widely:

* Graphical user interface testing. A testing framework that generates user interface events such as keystrokes and mouse clicks, and observes the changes that result in the user interface, to validate that the observable behavior of the program is correct.
* API driven testing. A testing framework that uses a programming interface to the application to validate the behaviour under test. Typically API driven testing bypasses application user interface altogether. It can also be testing public (usually) interfaces to classes, modules or libraries are tested with a variety of input arguments to validate that the results that are returned are correct.

==Other approaches==
===Model-based testing===

One way to generate test cases automatically is model-based testing through use of a model of the system for test case generation, but research continues into a variety of alternative methodologies for doing so. In some cases, the model-based approach enables non-technical users to create automated business test cases in plain English so that no programming of any kind is needed in order to configure them for multiple operating systems, browsers, and smart devices.

===Regression testing===
Some software testing tasks (such as extensive low-level interface regression testing) can be laborious and time-consuming to do manually. In addition, a manual approach might not always be effective in finding certain classes of defects. Test automation offers a possibility to perform these types of testing effectively.

Once automated tests have been developed, they can be run quickly and repeatedly many times. This can be a cost-effective method for regression testing of software products that have a long maintenance life. Even minor patches over the lifetime of the application can cause existing features to break which were working at an earlier point in time.

===API testing===
API testing is also being widely used by software testers as it enables them to verify requirements independent of their GUI implementation, commonly to test them earlier in development, and to make sure the test itself adheres to clean code principles, especially the single responsibility principle. It involves directly testing APIs as part of integration testing, to determine if they meet expectations for functionality, reliability, performance, and security. Since APIs lack a GUI, API testing is performed at the message layer. API testing is considered critical when an API serves as the primary interface to application logic.

===Graphical user interface (GUI) testing ===
Many test automation tools provide record and playback features that allow users to interactively record user actions and replay them back any number of times, comparing actual results to those expected. The advantage of this approach is that it requires little or no software development. This approach can be applied to any application that has a graphical user interface. However, reliance on these features poses major reliability and maintainability problems. Relabelling a button or moving it to another part of the window may require the test to be re-recorded. Record and playback also often adds irrelevant activities or incorrectly records some activities.

A variation on this type of tool is for testing of web sites. Here, the &quot;interface&quot; is the web page. However, such a framework utilizes entirely different techniques because it is rendering HTML and listening to DOM Events instead of operating system events. Headless browsers or solutions based on Selenium Web Driver are normally used for this purpose.

Another variation of this type of test automation tool is for testing mobile applications. This is very useful given the number of different sizes, resolutions, and operating systems used on mobile phones. For this variation, a framework is used in order to instantiate actions on the mobile device and to gather results of the actions.

Another variation is script-less test automation that does not use record and playback, but instead builds a model of the application and then enables the tester to create test cases by simply inserting test parameters and conditions, which requires no scripting skills.

==Methodologies==
===Test-driven development===
Test automation, mostly using unit testing, is a key feature of extreme programming and agile software development, where it is known as test-driven development (TDD) or test-first development. Unit tests can be written to define the functionality &quot;before&quot; the code is written. However, these unit tests evolve and are extended as coding progresses, issues are discovered and the code is subjected to refactoring. Only when all the tests for all the demanded features pass is the code considered complete. Proponents argue that it produces software that is both more reliable and less costly than code that is tested by manual exploration. It is considered more reliable because the code coverage is better, and because it is run constantly during development rather than once at the end of a waterfall development cycle. The developer discovers defects immediately upon making a change, when it is least expensive to fix. Finally, code refactoring is safer when unit testing is used; transforming the code into a simpler form with less code duplication, but equivalent behavior, is much less likely to introduce new defects when the refactored code is covered by unit tests.

===Continuous testing===

Continuous testing is the process of executing automated tests as part of the software delivery pipeline to obtain immediate feedback on the business risks associated with a software release candidate. For Continuous Testing, the scope of testing extends from validating bottom-up requirements or user stories to assessing the system requirements associated with overarching business goals.

==Considerations==
===Factors to consider for the decision to implement test automation ===
What to automate, when to automate, or even whether one really needs automation are crucial decisions which the testing (or development) team must make. A multi-vocal literature review of 52 practitioner and 26 academic sources found that five main factors to consider in test automation decision are: 1) System Under Test (SUT), 2) the types and numbers of tests, 3) test-tool, 4) human and organizational topics, and 5) cross-cutting factors. The most frequent individual factors identified in the study were: need for regression testing, economic factors, and maturity of SUT.

===Plateau effect===
While the reusability of automated tests is valued by software development companies, this property can also be viewed as a disadvantage. It leads to the so-called &quot;Pesticide Paradox&quot;, where repeatedly executed scripts stop detecting errors that go beyond their frameworks. In such cases, manual testing may be a better investment. This ambiguity once again leads to the conclusion that the decision on test automation should be made individually, keeping in mind project requirements and peculiarities.

===What to test===
Testing tools can help automate tasks such as product installation, test data creation, GUI interaction, problem detection (consider parsing or polling agents equipped with test oracles), defect logging, etc., without necessarily automating tests in an end-to-end fashion.

One must keep satisfying popular requirements when thinking of test automation:
* Platform and OS independence
* Data driven capability (Input Data, Output Data, Metadata)
* Customization Reporting (DB Data Base Access, Crystal Reports)
* Easy debugging and logging
* Version control friendly – minimal binary files
* Extensible &amp; Customization (Open APIs to be able to integrate with other tools)
* Common Driver (For example, in the Java development ecosystem, that means Ant or Maven and the popular IDEs). This enables tests to integrate with the developers&#x27; workflows.
* Support unattended test runs for integration with build processes and batch runs. Continuous integration servers require this.
* Email Notifications like bounce messages
* Support distributed execution environment (distributed test bed)
* Distributed application support (distributed SUT)

==Roles==
===Test automation tools===
Test automation tools can be expensive and are usually employed in combination with manual testing. Test automation can be made cost-effective in the long term, especially when used repeatedly in regression testing. A good candidate for test automation is a test case for common flow of an application, as it is required to be executed (regression testing) every time an enhancement is made in the application. Test automation reduces the effort associated with manual testing. Manual effort is needed to develop and maintain automated checks, as well as reviewing test results.

===Test engineer===

In automated testing, the test engineer or software quality assurance person must have software coding ability since the test cases are written in the form of source code which when run produce output according to the assertions that are a part of it. Some test automation tools allow for test authoring to be done by keywords instead of coding, which do not require programming.

== Testing at different levels ==
A strategy to decide the amount of tests to automate is the test automation pyramid. This strategy suggests to write three types of tests with different granularity. The higher the level, less is the amount of tests to write.

=== Unit, service, and user interface levels ===

* As a solid foundation, unit testing provides robustness to the software products. Testing individual parts of the code makes it easy to write and run the tests. Developers write unit tests as a part of each story and integrate them with CI.
* The service layer refers to testing the services of an application separately from its user interface, these services are anything that the application does in response to some input or set of inputs.
* At the top level we have UI testing which has fewer tests due to the different attributes that make it more complex to run, for example the fragility of the tests, where a small change in the user interface can break a lot of tests and adds maintenance effort.

=== Unit, integration, and end-to-end levels ===

One conception of the testing pyramid contains unit, integration, and end-to-end unit tests. According to Google&#x27;s testing blog, unit tests should make up the majority of your testing strategy, with fewer integration tests and only a small amount of end-to-end tests.

* Unit tests: These are tests that test individual components or units of code in isolation. They are fast, reliable, and isolate failures to small units of code.
* Integration tests: These tests check how different units of code work together. Although individual units may function properly on their own, integration tests ensure that they operate together coherently.
* End-to-end tests: These test the system as a whole, simulating real-world usage scenarios. They are the slowest and most complex tests.

==Framework approach in automation==
A test automation framework is an integrated system that sets the rules of automation of a specific product. This system integrates the function libraries, test data sources, object details and various reusable modules. These components act as small building blocks which need to be assembled to represent a business process. The framework provides the basis of test automation and simplifies the automation effort.

The main advantage of a framework of assumptions, concepts and tools that provide support for automated software testing is the low cost for maintenance. If there is change to any test case then only the test case file needs to be updated and the driver Script and startup script will remain the same. Ideally, there is no need to update the scripts in case of changes to the application.

Choosing the right framework/scripting technique helps in maintaining lower costs. The costs associated with test scripting are due to development and maintenance efforts. The approach of scripting used during test automation has effect on costs.

Various framework/scripting techniques are generally used:

# Linear (procedural code, possibly generated by tools like those that use record and playback)
# Structured (uses control structures - typically ‘if-else’, ‘switch’, ‘for’, ‘while’ conditions/ statements)
#Data-driven (data is persisted outside of tests in a database, spreadsheet, or other mechanism)
#Keyword-driven
# Hybrid (two or more of the patterns above are used)
# Agile automation framework

The Testing framework is responsible for:

# defining the format in which to express expectations
# creating a mechanism to hook into or drive the application under test
# executing the tests
# reporting results

===Unit testing frameworks===
A growing trend in software development is the use of unit testing frameworks such as the xUnit frameworks (for example, JUnit and NUnit) that allow the execution of unit tests to determine whether various sections of the code are acting as expected under various circumstances. Test cases describe tests that need to be run on the program to verify that the program runs as expected.

===Test automation interface===
Test automation interfaces are platforms that provide a single workspace for incorporating multiple testing tools and frameworks for System/Integration testing of application under test. The goal of Test Automation Interface is to simplify the process of mapping tests to business criteria without coding coming in the way of the process. Test automation interface are expected to improve the efficiency and flexibility of maintaining test scripts.

Test Automation Interface consists of the following core modules:

* Interface Engine
* Interface Environment
* Object Repository

====Interface engine====
Interface engines are built on top of Interface Environment. Interface engine consists of a parser and a test runner. The parser is present to parse the object files coming from the object repository into the test specific scripting language. The test runner executes the test scripts using a test harness.

====Object repository====
Object repositories are a collection of UI/Application object data recorded by the testing tool while exploring the application under test.

==Defining boundaries between automation framework and a testing tool==
Tools are specifically designed to target some particular test environment, such as Windows and web automation tools, etc. Tools serve as a driving agent for an automation process. However, an automation framework is not a tool to perform a specific task, but rather infrastructure that provides the solution where different tools can do their job in a unified manner. This provides a common platform for the automation engineer.

There are various types of frameworks. They are categorized on the basis of the automation component they leverage. These are:

#Data-driven testing
#Modularity-driven testing
#Keyword-driven testing
#Hybrid testing
#Model-based testing
# Code-driven testing
#Behavior driven development

<doc id="1086550" wikidata="Q599095" url="?curid=1086550" title="Deep Blue Sea (1999 film)">
<text>Deep Blue Sea is a 1999 American science fiction horror film directed by Renny Harlin. It stars Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, Samuel L. Jackson, Michael Rapaport, and LL Cool J. It is the first film of the film series of the same name. Set in an isolated underwater facility, the film follows a team of scientists and their research on mako sharks to help fight Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. The situation plunges into chaos when multiple genetically engineered sharks go on a rampage and flood the facility.

&quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; had a production budget of $60 million and represented a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; in 1993. The film was primarily shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot;. Although &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; features some shots of real sharks, most of the sharks used in the film were either animatronic or computer generated. Trevor Rabin composed the film score; LL Cool J contributed two songs to the film: &quot;Deepest Bluest (Shark&#x27;s Fin)&quot; and &quot;Say What&quot;.

Released in theaters on July 28, 1999, &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; grossed $165 million worldwide. It received generally mixed reviews from critics, who praised its suspense, pacing, and action sequences, but criticized its unoriginality and B movie conventions. Retrospectively, &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; has been regarded as a successful shark film, especially within a limited genre that has been dominated by Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1975 thriller &quot;Jaws&quot;. Two direct-to-video sequels have been released: &quot;Deep Blue Sea 2&quot; in 2018 and &quot;Deep Blue Sea 3&quot; in 2020.

==Plot==

In a remote underwater facility, doctors Susan McCallister and Jim Whitlock are conducting research on mako sharks to help in the re-activation of dormant human brain cells like those found in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease patients. After one of the sharks escapes the facility and attempts to attack a boat full of young adults, financial backers send corporate executive Russell Franklin to investigate the facility.

Susan and Jim prove their research is working by testing a certain protein complex that was removed from the brain tissue of their largest shark, which bites off Jim&#x27;s right arm upon awakening in the laboratory. Brenda Kerns, the tower&#x27;s operator, calls a helicopter that braves heavy rain and strong winds to evacuate Jim. As Jim is being lifted the cable jams, dropping Jim and his stretcher into the shark pen. The largest shark grabs the stretcher and pulls the helicopter into the tower, killing Brenda and the pilots, as well as causing massive explosions that severely damage the facility.

In the laboratory, Susan, Franklin, wrangler Carter Blake, marine biologist Janice Higgins, and engineer Tom Scoggins witness the shark smash the stretcher against the laboratory&#x27;s main window, which then shatters, drowning Jim and flooding the facility. The group goes to the facility&#x27;s wet entry, where they plan to take a submersible to escape. Susan confesses to the others that she and Jim genetically engineered the sharks to increase their brain size, as they were not naturally large enough to harvest sufficient amounts of the protein complex; this broke protocol and made the sharks smarter and deadlier. In the facility&#x27;s kitchen, which has been partially flooded, cook Sherman &quot;Preacher&quot; Dudley, whose parrot is eaten by a shark, manages to kill the big fish by setting off an explosion with his lighter.

When the group reaches the wet entry, they discover that the submersible has been damaged, and is unsuitable for use. While delivering a monologue emphasizing the need for group unity, Franklin is dragged into the submersible pool by a shark and devoured. The remaining crew opt to climb up the elevator shaft at the risk of destabilizing the pool. As they climb, explosive tremors cause the ladder to break, and Janice loses her grip and falls into the water. Despite Carter&#x27;s attempt to save her, a shark drags Janice under and eats her. The rest of the group moves on, encountering Preacher. Carter and Scoggins go to the flooded laboratory to activate a control panel that drains a stairway to the surface, while Susan heads to her room to collect her research material. Carter and Scoggins reach the control panel, but the largest shark storms in, ripping Scoggins apart and wrecking the controls. In her room, Susan encounters another shark and electrocutes it with a power cable, destroying her research in the process.

After regrouping, Carter, Susan, and Preacher go to a decompression chamber and swim to the surface while using oxygen tanks to bait the last shark as it attacks. Upon reaching the surface, Preacher is grabbed by the shark, suffering injuries to his leg, but he is released when he stabs the shark in the eye with his crucifix. Carter realizes that the sharks have been using them to flood the facility so that they can ram their way through the fences at the surface. To keep the shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan deliberately cuts her hand and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark with her blood, she is unable to get out of the water and is devoured, despite Carter&#x27;s efforts to save her. While Carter is holding the shark&#x27;s dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a harpoon but also pierces Carter&#x27;s thigh. Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark. Carter manages to free himself just in time after the shark manages to breach through the fence right before it gets blown. He resurfaces and swims to shore, reuniting with Preacher. Moments later, they see a boat approaching the sinking facility.

==Production==

===Development===
The story of &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; was conceived by Australian screenwriter Duncan Kennedy after he witnessed the result of a &quot;horrific&quot; shark attack on a beach near his home. The tragedy contributed to a recurring nightmare of him &quot;being in a passageway with sharks that could read his mind&quot;. This motivated him to write a spec script, while acknowledging the challenge of approaching a shark film without repeating Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 1975 thriller &quot;Jaws&quot;. Although Warner Bros. bought the script in late 1994, actual development on the project did not start until two years later. When Renny Harlin was chosen to direct the film, Kennedy&#x27;s screenplay, which had already been re-written by several writers at Warner Bros., was presented to Donna Powers and Wayne Powers, who turned it into the film&#x27;s final script. According to Wayne, &quot;The movie became essentially what we wrote. The draft we were first presented by [Warner Bros.] was much more of a military espionage, high-tech action movie, grenade launchers, that kind of thing. We wanted our team to include more blue-collar types and not to have weapons to fight back, to play it more as a horror film.&quot;

In a wide-ranging August 2021 interview with leading horror site Bloody Disgusting on the development and production of the film based on his original screenplay, screenwriter Duncan Kennedy stated that when he initially researched the project, scientists &quot;agreed to talk because I presented DBS&#x27;s sharks as man-made, unlike &quot;Jaws&quot; which demonized natural sharks.&quot; He revealed his original title was &quot;Deep Red&quot; before he changed it to &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;. On development, he discussed in detail what changed and what stayed the same from original screenplay to final film, describing his own studio rewrites and those of many subsequent writers, emphasizing a &quot;DBS team effort&quot; and that &quot;all of these writers made contributions that are identifiable in the final film.&quot; In terms of the final product, he stated that despite major changes, &quot;development overall stuck within the basic story framework seen in my original drafts&quot; and that the final film is &quot;very different on multiple levels. But also in a more generalized sense... not that different.&quot; Kennedy confirmed that the development timeline of the project &quot;was in fact under three years - nothing in Hollywood development time&quot; with the original screenplay selling in late July 1995 and production commencing early August 1998 for a July 1999 release date. He revealed that as production approached, he &quot;helped to brainstorm ideas for sequences that weren&#x27;t working&quot; and that DBS producer and acclaimed writer Akiva Goldsman did the final rewrites on the film. On the final film he stated he felt &quot;the decision to steer just a little closer to &quot;Alien&quot; in multiple ways somewhat limited the film from breaking out even bigger at the box office. Smart sharks in &#x27;our world&#x27; made the movie fresh, but being a little too &quot;Alien&quot;-esque overall maybe held it back.&quot; However Kennedy concluded that the final film &quot;was very much the movie I&#x27;d envisioned in terms of the visuals, the world, the story journey and the audience experience.&quot;

&quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; had a budget of $82 million and represented a test for Harlin, who had not made a commercially successful film since &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; in 1993. Harlin&#x27;s main goal was to bring the horror genre back to the serious and high-budget production values of films like &quot;The Exorcist&quot;, &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot;, as opposed to the tongue-in-cheek style of subsequent films in the genre. Ridley Scott&#x27;s 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot; was an influence on the casting process, as Harlin wanted to cast the characters in a way as to make it impossible for the audience to know who was going to die or survive. To achieve this, he combined relatively unknown actors who could deliver solid performances and meet the physical demands of the diving and stunts with a star, Academy Award nominee Samuel L. Jackson, who &quot;anchors the whole piece&quot;. Harlin also forced the studio into hiring rapper LL Cool J because he wanted a character who could bring &quot;a lot of warmth and humor to the film without it being joke-type humor&quot;.

===Filming===
Principal photography for &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; began on August 3, 1998. Most of the film was shot at Fox Baja Studios in Rosarito, Mexico, where the production team constructed sets above the large water tanks that had been built for James Cameron&#x27;s 1997 film &quot;Titanic&quot;. Some of the sets were designed so that they could be submerged, while others were built on sound stages with fishtanks used as windows. At Fox Baja Studios, the cast worked with sharks that were either animatronic or computer generated. As the shark used in &quot;Jaws&quot; was 25 feet long, Harlin decided to increase their animatronic shark to 26 feet. Jackson recalled, &quot;When they first brought it into the lab we were all in awe of the size of this machine [...] It was a real monster. I would walk up to it slowly and touch it and they said it felt like a real shark. The gills moved and it had a mind of its own sometimes.&quot; As an added homage to &quot;Jaws&quot;, the license plate pulled from the shark&#x27;s teeth by Carter is the same plate found in the tiger shark carcass from Spielberg&#x27;s film.

After the shoot at Fox Baja Studios wrapped, Harlin insisted the team go to The Bahamas to shoot with real sharks. Recounting his experience there, actor Thomas Jane, who played shark wrangler Carter, said, &quot;The first day, I was in a cage, but the next day, they swam me 30 feet down... Then this guy yanks the breather off me and the water&#x27;s churning with blood and guts and stuff... It was so terrifying that I don&#x27;t want to remember it.&quot; The idea was to mix footage of real sharks with animatronic and computer generated sharks to ensure a seamless transition between them all. To distinguish &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; from &quot;Jaws&quot;, where the shark is frequently hidden, Harlin decided to show theirs more prominently because he felt that audience expectations had changed since then.

The scene where the cast is trying to get back to the elevator after hooking up actor Stellan Skarsgård to the helicopter is actually an accident that made it into the finished film. As Jackson explained, &quot;At one point three tons of water got thrown on us by accident and we got swept toward those cargo bays and everyone thought we were going into the drink and people were tumbling around this metal grating [...] We scrambled up and kept acting [...] That was not supposed to happen and we didn&#x27;t have safety harnesses on and we were flailing around on this deck.&quot; Jackson was initially offered the role played by LL Cool J, but his management team did not like the idea of him playing a chef, so Harlin created the role of Russell Franklin for him. Additionally, LL Cool J&#x27;s character was supposed to die early on, but the director ultimately decided to keep him. The production team could not afford to have a fully trained parrot for LL Cool J&#x27;s character, so they used two parrots: one that was good at flying, and another that could sit on his shoulder.

The film&#x27;s ending was changed shortly before its theatrical release. Originally, Burrows&#x27;s character would escape the shark infested water and live. However, the test audience, who saw the film less than a month before its release, were angered by the ending because she was responsible for the shark experiments and was seen as the film&#x27;s villain aside from the sharks themselves. As a result, the production team did a one-day reshoot in the Universal Studios tank and did some computer generated work on the sharks to change it. A fan petition was created in 2019 calling on Warner Bros. to release the original ending that received support from both Thomas Jane and Renny Harlin.

In 2009, on the film&#x27;s 10th anniversary, Harlin explained that &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; was the hardest film he had ever made because most of the shooting days involved the team standing in water or being under water for long periods. According to him, &quot;Just the practicality of putting a wet suit on in the morning, being in the water all day. Your script, all your paperwork has to be made of plastic paper. And things that you wouldn&#x27;t think would ever float, they float. [...] Or then things that you hope would float actually sink and you can&#x27;t find them anywhere.&quot;

===Music===
The film score for &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; was composed by Trevor Rabin. Rabin&#x27;s music ranges from orchestral and choral arrangements to electronic soundscapes, and was noted for its use of both dramatic and easily accessible themes. The soundtrack features two songs by LL Cool J&quot;Deepest Bluest (Shark&#x27;s Fin)&quot; and &quot;Say What&quot;which were used in the end credits. Two soundtrack albums were also released for the film. The first album, &quot;Deep Blue Sea: Music from the Motion Picture&quot;, was released on August 3, 1999 by Warner Bros. Records and features a set of hip hop and R&amp;B tracks by several artists, including Hi-C, Cormega, and Bass Odyssey. The second album, &quot;Deep Blue Sea: Original Motion Picture Score&quot;, was released on August 24, 1999 by Varèse Sarabande and contains musical tracks by Rabin.

==Release==
===Box office===
&quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; performed well when it opened on July 30, 1999 in 2,854 theaters, finishing third and grossing around $18.6 million at the US weekend box office. During its second weekend, the film grossed an estimated $11 million and finished in fifth place, behind &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot;, &quot;The Blair Witch Project&quot;, &quot;Runaway Bride&quot;, and &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot;. &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; grossed over $73.7 million the United States and Canada and $91.4 million internationally, grossing over $165 million worldwide. The film&#x27;s performance was compared to Stephen Sommers&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&quot; and Jan de Bont&#x27;s &quot;The Haunting&quot;, which had a similar budget and made a significant impact on the box office in the summer of 1999.

===Critical response===
Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 60% based on 114 reviews, with an average rating of 5.7/10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; is no &quot;Jaws&quot;, but action fans seeking some toothy action can certainly do - and almost certainly have done - far worse for B-movie thrills.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 54 out of 100, based on 22 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Writing for &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film three out of four stars and praised it as &quot;a skillful thriller&quot;, saying that &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; &quot;is essentially one well-done action sequence after another [...] It doesn&#x27;t linger on the special effects (some of the sharks look like cartoons), but it knows how to use timing, suspense, quick movement and [especially] surprise&quot;. He concluded that the film keeps spectators guessing in an otherwise predictable genre.

In a positive review, Kenneth Turan of &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; considered &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; a return to form for Harlin, especially after the &quot;dismal swamps&quot; of &quot;Cutthroat Island&quot; and &quot;The Long Kiss Goodnight&quot;. He described the film as &quot;an example of how expert action filmmaking and up-to-the-minute visual effects can transcend a workmanlike script and bring excitement to conventional genre material&quot;. Similarly, Desson Howe of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; remarked that, while the film&#x27;s premise feels familiar, it &quot;knows its audience and knows what&#x27;ll get them going – and even wondering&quot;. He said that &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; might not be Harlin&#x27;s finest two hours, but he managed to build &quot;something that, if nothing else, gives you a great big shock every few minutes&quot;. In a three-and-a-half out of four review, Robert Lasowski of &quot;The Florida Times-Union&quot; highly praised the film&#x27;s pacing, intense action, and chase scenes, stating that &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; is &quot;a great popcorn movie&quot; and &quot;what summer at the cineplex is all about&quot;.

Other reviews were less enthusiastic. Writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Stephen Holden described &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; as &quot;a cut-rate &quot;Titanic&quot; stripped of romance and historical resonance and fused with &quot;Jaws&quot;, shorn of mythic symbolism and without complex characters&quot;, while Barbara Shulgasser of &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; criticized it for being an inferior imitation of &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, but praised LL Cool J&#x27;s performance and the film&#x27;s realistic setting. Ian Nathan of the British magazine &quot;Empire&quot; gave the film three out of five stars and criticized its B movie conventions, stating that &quot;You&#x27;re never entirely sure whether you&#x27;re laughing at or with &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; reviewer Robert Koehler felt the computer generated sharks were inconsistently realized, but nevertheless highlighted the flooding of the facility very positively. The dialogue between action sequences was also praised, especially LL Cool J&#x27;s &quot;blend of Bible talk, smack and wit&quot;. Despite his few lines, Jane was seen as a charismatic character and &quot;a genuine new action star&quot;.

===Home media===
&quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; was first released on DVD on December 7, 1999, courtesy of Warner Home Video.

==Legacy==
In a 2016 retrospective, &quot;Wired&quot; editor Brian Raftery considered &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; &quot;the greatest non-&quot;Jaws&quot; shark movie of all time&quot; and superior to Jaume Collet-Serra&#x27;s &quot;The Shallows&quot;. He remarked that, within a genre that had been dominated by &quot;Jaws&quot;, &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; features &quot;genuinely inventive&quot; action sequences, &quot;nicely rounded-out, human&quot; characters, and memorable death scenes. Raftery also noted that the film was among the last of its kind, describing it as &quot;[a]n R-rated B-movie, full of gore and chaos and smart-stupidness, but with a big-budget, big-cast sheen&quot;, in a similar way to Paul Verhoeven&#x27;s &quot;Total Recall&quot; and &quot;Starship Troopers&quot;, Roland Emmerich&#x27;s &quot;Stargate&quot;, and Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;. Samuel L. Jackson&#x27;s surprising death scene in the film appears on some lists of best film deaths of all time.

&quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; has often been cited as one of the greatest shark films of all time. In 2012, &quot;PopMatters&quot; ranked the film third, behind &quot;Jaws&quot; and &quot;Open Water&quot;, and described it as &quot;[O]ne of the last great [films] from action ace Renny Harlin.&quot; In 2015, &quot;Den of Geek!&quot;, a publication of Dennis Publishing, ranked &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot; only behind &quot;Jaws&quot; and credited it for its action-packed scenes and intelligent sharks. In 2017, &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; ranked it seventh and highlighted Jackson&#x27;s death scene and LL Cool J&#x27;s performance, while &quot;Complex&quot; ranked it third, praising its talented actors and tight action sequences. In 2019, to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Deep Blue Sea&quot;, the Screamfest Horror Film Festival hosted a screening at the TCL Chinese theaters in Hollywood, California, as part of its &quot;Fears &amp; Beers&quot; program. Cast members including actor Thomas Jane attended for a post-screening Q&amp;A moderated by Brian Collins of Birth.Movies.Death.

<doc id="1086551" wikidata="Q255159" url="?curid=1086551" title="Martha Jefferson Randolph">
<text>Martha &quot;Patsy&quot; Randolph (&quot;née&quot; Jefferson; September 27, 1772 – October 10, 1836) was the eldest daughter of Thomas Jefferson, the third president of the United States, and his wife, Martha Wayles Skelton Jefferson. She was born at Monticello, near Charlottesville, Virginia.

Randolph&#x27;s mother died when she was nearly 10 years old, when only two out of her five siblings were alive. Her father saw that she had a good education. She spoke four languages and was greatly influenced by the education she received in a Paris convent school with daughters of the French elite. By 1804, she was the lone surviving child of Martha and Thomas Jefferson, the only one of the couple&#x27;s children to survive past the age of 25.

Martha Jefferson married Thomas Mann Randolph Jr., who was a politician at the federal and state levels and was elected as governor of Virginia (1819–1822), which made her the first lady of Virginia. They had twelve children together.

Randolph oversaw the operation of Varina and Edge Hill with her husband, and Monticello with her father. She was in regular correspondence with her father when they were not together. She provided emotional stability for Jefferson, which helped him weather his tumultuous political career. Besides overseeing Monticello, she lived with Jefferson at the White House, serving as an informal First Lady.

After the White House, Randolph and her children lived at Monticello and cared for her father. Due to debt, the Randolphs sold Varina and lost Edge Hill plantation to foreclosure in 1825. Randolph inheritied Monticello and Jefferson&#x27;s debts when her father died in 1826. Many of the enslaved people at Monticello were sold to cover some of the debt.

== Early life and education (1772–1790) ==
=== Virginia ===
Martha Jefferson was born on September 27, 1772, at Monticello, her father&#x27;s estate in Virginia (then in British America). Her parents were Thomas Jefferson and Martha Wayles Skelton. During her parents&#x27; ten-year marriage, they had six children. Randolph was their first born. She was followed by Jane Randolph (1774–1775); a son who lived for only a few weeks in 1777; Mary &quot;Polly&quot; (1778–1804); Lucy Elizabeth (1780–1781); and another Lucy Elizabeth (1782–1784). Only Randolph and Mary survived more than a few years. As a young child, Randolph saw her mother suffer during difficult pregnancies and both parents mourn the deaths of four infant children.

The family lived a genteel lifestyle and Randolph was initially schooled at home. Her studies included dance lessons. When she was seven years of age, her father became the governor of Virginia. He was elected on June 1, 1779, and the family first lived in Williamsburg. They relocated to Richmond when the government moved there in 1780. British troops advanced to Richmond in May 1781 and, due to advance warning, the Jeffersons escaped to their country home, Poplar Forest.

Randolph was almost 10 years of age when her mother died on September 6, 1782, four months after the birth of the Jeffersons&#x27; last child. Randolph later wrote about this period and her father&#x27;s grief, stating &quot;in those melancholy rambles I was his constant companion, a solitary witness to many a violent burst of grief.&quot;

=== Philadelphia ===
Randolph went to Philadelphia with her father in 1782 and again in the fall of 1783 when he represented Virginia at the Congress of the Confederation. The largest city in America at the time, Philadelphia was the center of American Enlightenment.

Randolph&#x27;s father did not believe in public education for girls, but arranged for his daughter to receive a private education. Between December 1782 and May 1784, she boarded with a family and studied French, dancing, drawing, and music with private tutors, who received prescribed, strict daily schedules and instructions regarding how her education should be conducted from Thomas Jefferson. His intention was to make her an esteemed, well-read lady. He was particularly focused on cleanliness and spelling, both of which were important to create the image of a proper lady with moral behavior and diction. In the meantime, her father worked in Philadelphia and awaited Congressional orders to go to France.

=== Paris ===
Her younger sisters, Mary and Lucy Elizabeth, remained in Virginia with family members as Randolph and her father traveled to Boston with James Hemings. They set sail for Paris on the ship &quot;Ceres&quot; on July 5, 1784, and arrived in France on August 6, 1784. Randolph lived in Paris from age 12 to 17 while her father served as U.S. Minister to France. In October 1784, her youngest sister, Lucy, died of whooping cough.

Jefferson enrolled her at the Pentemont Abbey, an exclusive convent school, after receiving assurances that Protestant students were exempt from religious instruction. At this boarding school Randolph learned arithmetic, geography, world history, and Latin, as well as music and drawing. She was deeply influenced by the four years at the convent school. Her peers were the French elite who provide a model of &quot;female intelligence, capacity, and energy&quot; and experienced the &quot;rich pageantry of Roman Catholic liturgies&quot;. It gave her the ability to conduct witty, intelligent conversation and thought about how she would manage the education of her future children.


When she socialized at the Abbey, she learned about women&#x27;s role in political affairs, the dissension leading to the French Revolution, and palace intrique. Her father had influenced the drafting of the Declaration of the Rights of Man in France. Randolph said of her time in France was &quot;the brightest part of a life much shaded &amp; saddened by care &amp; sorrows.&quot;

Mary traveled with Sally Hemings to Paris and joined her sister at the convent school in July 1787. Randolph and her sister Mary contracted typhus during the winter of 1788 and lived with their father until they regained their health. They returned to the convent in spring of 1789. After Randolph expressed a desire to convert to Catholicism and said she was considering religious orders, Jefferson quickly withdrew her and her younger sister Polly from the school. Over the course of her studies, Randolph learned to speak four languages.

Randolph socialized with &quot;free thinking&quot; European women and accomplished women of the French Enlightenment, like Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire and Germaine de Staël. She also met world leaders while in France. She enjoyed a social life that included balls and concerts during the summer. Wayson says that she was able &quot;to observe firsthand the collective power of French women as they marched to the king&#x27;s palace at Versailles and forced the royal couple&#x27;s return to Paris under the escort of the Marquis de Lafayette, a Jefferson family friend.&quot; In September 1789, after the beginning of the French Revolution, Thomas Jefferson, his daughters, and James and Sally Hemings sailed for America, arriving in 1790.

== Marriage and family (1790–1818) ==
On February 23, 1790, at the age of 17, she married Thomas Mann Randolph Jr., a planter, at Monticello. He was her third cousin, and a descendant of Pocahontas. Her husband, the son of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s friend Thomas Mann Randolph Sr., was in many ways a good candidate as her husband, but his family was subject to scandal. Some of the Randolphs were accused but later acquitted of killing a child believed to have been fathered by Richard Randolph. Randolph was a witness in the case of Commonwealth v. Richard Randolph on April 22, 1793. In addition, her father-in-law created a scandal when he married a teenager.

Soon after their marriage, her father, Thomas Jefferson, deeded eight slaves from Monticello as a wedding gift, including Molly Hemings, the eldest daughter of Mary Hemings. Critta Hemings, sister of Sally Hemings, helped Randolph care for the children for many years at Monticello and Edge Hill.

The couple first lived at Randolph&#x27;s estate, Varina, in Henrico County and Martha had twelve children. She had more children than any daughter of a President. In contrast to her parents and sister, each of whom had most of their children die in childhood, eleven of the Randolphs&#x27; children survived to adulthood:

*Ann Cary Randolph (1791–1826), who married Charles Lewis Bankhead (1788–1833).
*Thomas Jefferson Randolph (1792–1875), who married Jane Hollins Nicholas (1798–1871) daughter of Wilson Cary Nicholas.
*Ellen Wayles Randolph (1794–1795), died young during a trip that Randolph and her husband took July 1795 to October 1795 to improve his health.
*Ellen Wayles Randolph (1796–1876), who was named after deceased sister, and was married to Joseph Coolidge (1798–1879) and was then known as Ellen Randolph Coolidge.
*Cornelia Jefferson Randolph (1799–1871). In the 1830s, she established a school at Edge Hill, then her brother&#x27;s estate, where she taught painting, sculpture, and drawing. She translated and published, &quot;The Parlor Gardener: A Treatise on the House Culture of Ornamental Plants. Translated from the French and Adapted to American Use&quot;. Cornelia never married.
*Virginia Jefferson Randolph (1801–1881), who married Nicholas Trist (1800–1874).
*Mary Jefferson Randolph (1803–1876). She lived at Edge Hill and helped her sister-in-law, Jane, supervise the household of her brother Thomas Jefferson Randolph. She and her sister Cornelia also visited the houses of their siblings during times of sickness. She never married.
*James Madison Randolph (1806–1834) was born at the President&#x27;s House, now called the White House, on January 17, 1806.
*Benjamin Franklin Randolph (1808–1871), who married Sarah Champe &quot;Sally&quot; Carter (1808–1896) a member of the Carter family of Virginia.
*Meriwether Lewis Randolph (1810–1837), who married Elizabeth Anderson Martin (1815–1871). After his death, Martin married Andrew Jackson Donelson, a nephew of President Andrew Jackson.
*Septimia Anne Randolph (1814–1887), who married Dr. David Scott Meikleham (1804–1849), becoming Septimia Randolph Meikleham.
*George Wythe Randolph (1818–1867), who briefly in 1862 was Secretary of War of the Confederate States of America, and who married Mary Elizabeth Adams Pope (1830–1871).

==Life at Varina, Monticello, and Edge Hill (1790?–1800)==
Randolph managed the household affairs at Varina and her father&#x27;s estate at Monticello in the 1790s. She educated her children at home. Although she was married, she maintained her affection and allegiance to her father, before her husband. Randolph&#x27;s relationship with her husband Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. was strained by the close relationship that she maintained with her father, having taken up residence at Monticello, as well as the strained finances and feuds of her husband&#x27;s family, the Randolph family of Tuckahoe.

For ten years, she was the mistress of Monticello, building a social life that supported Jefferson&#x27;s political life. Described as a &quot;cosmopolitan salon in the rural Virginia Piedmont&quot;, father and daughter entertained visitors. She knew the most influential women in America, like Dolley Madison, and eight of the first nine presidents of country, excluding George Washington who she never met. She was an adept conversationalist, reading and writing in four languages. John Randolph of Roanoke said that she was &quot;the sweetest woman of Virginia&quot;. Randolph was a rare southern woman who had significant authority in managing plantation as well as domestic activities. It was at Monticello that Jefferson found &quot;that society where all is peace and harmony&quot;. Her role as hostess and mistress of the plantation helped to prepare Randolph for her role at the White House.

Thomas Jefferson sold the couple land for the Edge Hill plantation so that they could be nearer to him at Monticello in Albemarle County. The Randolphs built a house and resided there beginning in January 1800.

==White House (1801–1809) ==

Randolph made several visits to the President&#x27;s House (now known as the White House) while her father was president. During her visits in the winters of 1802-03 and 1805-06 she temporarily filled the role of hostess at the President’s House. Winter was known as the social season in Washington, D.C., as it was the time when the annual Congressional session brought legislators to the city. Randolph was accompanied on her first visit by two of her children (Ann and Jeff), her sister Mary (known in adulthood as Maria), and Maria&#x27;s son Francis. While in Washington the president’s hostess and her sister socialized with politicians and society figures during morning visits, balls, church services, races, and President&#x27;s House dinners and receptions. On her second visit Randolph was accompanied by her entire family and her activities were more focused on family life and managing &quot;gloomy&quot; politics of the time. Randolph&#x27;s eighth child, James Madison Randolph, was born at the President&#x27;s House on January 17, 1806.

From 1803 to 1807, her husband Thomas Mann Randolph Jr. served in the House of Representatives in Washington, D.C. He had campaigned against &quot;an ardent supporter&quot; of Jefferson. Jefferson would have like to have had Randolph stay in Washington, D.C., for longer periods of time. Randolph, however, had obligations to manage the plantation, care for her children, and care for herself throughout her pregnancies. In addition, at the time Washington, D.C., was surrounded by swamp land that bred illness, which limited their visits.

There are different viewpoints about Randolph&#x27;s role during her father&#x27;s presidency. The Monticello website states that she served as Jefferson&#x27;s hostess and informal first lady by organizing Jefferson&#x27;s social schedule and welcoming guests at receptions held by her father. Author Catherine Allgor notes that she was her father&#x27;s confidante and well respected in Washington. Known for her intelligence and role in the social ladder, &quot;whenever she was in the capital, Mrs. Randolph became the head of whatever occasion she attended. No matter what the social skirmish, no one disputed her right of precedence.&quot;

Biographer Billy L. Wayson states that she was not a hostess or a confidant, but was a close companion to her father and &quot;was the emotional foundation&quot; that supported Jefferson&#x27;s role as president. Whether physically with him or through ongoing correspondence, she helped her father maintain his equilibrium throughout his tumultuous political life. Wayson states that Randolph was a significant influence to the president. &quot;The &#x27;first daughter&#x27; was foremost and continuously present in her father&#x27;s heart, especially during his most difficult political trials.&quot;

A few years before becoming president, Jefferson said:
Randolph was devoted to her father. She had a calming presence and helped divert attention from the rumors of Jefferson&#x27;s relationship with Sally Hemings. A visitor said that she provided &quot;the best refutation of all the calumnies that have been heaped upon him.&quot;

In 1982, the Siena College Research Institute asked historians to assess American first ladies, Randolph and several other &quot;acting&quot; first ladies were included. The first ladies survey, which has been conducted periodically since, ranks first ladies according to a cumulative score on the independent criteria of their background, value to the country, intelligence, courage, accomplishments, integrity, leadership, being their own women, public image, and value to the president. In the 1982 survey, out of 42 first ladies and &quot;acting&quot; first ladies, Randolph was assessed as the 18th most highly regarded among historians. Acting first ladies such as Randolph have been excluded from subsequent iterations of this survey.

Randolph&#x27;s sister, Mary &quot;Polly&quot;, was also a hostess at times, until she died in 1804 during childbirth. Politically attuned Dolley Madison often performed hostess duties for Jefferson. Her husband, James Madison, was then the Secretary of State. Jefferson found that when women attended gatherings at the White House, the conversation would be less contentious and interjected women&#x27;s viewpoints on government affairs.

==After the White House (1809–1825)==

Randolph and her children lived primarily at Monticello after Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s retirement in 1809. While her husband was the governor of Virginia from 1819 to 1822, she continued to live at Monticello. This was done partly to save money. She managed the household activities at the plantation. She had her own room at Monticello where she was generally on her own. Her husband, growingly estranged from his family, visited Monticello occasionally. Concerned about the family&#x27;s finances and loss of income if her husband served in the military during the War of 1812, Randolph convinced President James Monroe to give him a more lucrative, temporary tax collectorship post.

With three of her children—Mary, Cornelia, and Thomas—she edited the first collection of Jefferson&#x27;s writings for publication. She worked at spreading untrue claims that denied his paternity of the Hemings children and that would put her father in the best light.

Randolph devoted much of her life to her father&#x27;s declining years. She had separated from her husband, who was said to suffer from alcoholism and mental instability. By the summer of 1825, Tom Randolph lived in a small house he owned in North Milton.

==Debt (1825–1826)==
Randolph dealt with the strain of financial concerns over the debts of her husband, her father-in-law Thomas Mann Randolph Sr., and her father upon their deaths. They became indebted due to declining land values, risky investments, failed crops and needy relatives. As a result, Randolph&#x27;s daughters were threatened to live a life of spinsterhood.

Thomas Mann Randolph sold the Varina plantation in 1825 to Pleasant Akin or Aiken of Petersburg. Edge Hill plantation, along with its crops, buildings, animals, and slaves, was foreclosed in 1825 and the sale proceeds failed to pay back all the family&#x27;s creditors. The purchaser at the foreclosure auction, who took possession in January 1826, was Randolph&#x27;s eldest son, Thomas Jefferson Randolph.

== Later years and death (1826–1836) ==

Jefferson describes Randolph as the &quot;cherished companion of his youth and the nurse of his old age&quot;. Shortly before his death, he said that the &quot;last pang of life was parting with her.&quot; Thomas Jefferson died of on July 4, 1826. He was 83 years old. After his death, she inherited Monticello from her father in 1826, as well as his many debts. Her eldest son Thomas Randolph acted as executor of the estate. Except for five slaves freed in her father&#x27;s will, and &quot;giving her time&quot; (informal emancipation) to Sally Hemings, they sold the remainder of the 130 slaves at Monticello to try to settle the debts.

Randolph put Monticello on the market two weeks following her father&#x27;s death in July 1826. She attempted to sell it through a lottery, but was unable to sell it until 1831 to a James S. or James T. Barclay in 1831. After having been on the market for five years, the plantation sold for $7,000, one-tenth of its $71,000 value.

She had a little income from her father&#x27;s estate and lived &quot;on the edge of poverty&quot;. Wanting to ensure successful careers for her family, which included her sons-in-law, she looked to Margaret Bayard Smith, who helped family members procure positions that led to successful careers in Washington. For instance, Nicholas Trist, her son-in-law, was secured the position with Henry Clay, the Secretary of State under President John Quincy Adams.

After Jefferson&#x27;s death, Randolph lived with Thomas, her eldest son, at Tufton. She stayed at the home of her daughter Ellen and son-in-law Joseph Coolidge in Boston from October 1826 to May 1828. She had her two youngest children with her. She then went to her husband in June 1828 and reconciled with him. She was at his bedside when he died on the 20th of that month.

After her husband&#x27;s death, she lived with her son at Edgehill estate until November 29 and then in Washington, D.C., and Boston with other married children. To generate income, she hired out her remaining slaves. She also had an income from bank stock donated in tribute of Jefferson by the states of Louisiana and South Carolina. The state legislatures each donated $10,000 to her for her support, totalling $20,000 ().

A school was established at Edge Hill by her unmarried daughters, Mary and Cornelia, and Patsy, who taught music there at times. Randolph also traveled to the homes of her married children in her later years.

While in Boston, Randolph wrote her final will on January 24, 1836, and returned to the Edge Hill estate in July 1836. She died there on October 10, 1836, at the age of 64 and was buried at the Monticello family graveyard.

== Slavery ==
Randolph&#x27;s maternal grandfather John Wayles had two families, one with his wife Martha Epps and another with an enslaved woman Betty Hemings, whose children were owned by and served the Wayles family. In 1773, when Randolph had been married one year, her grandfather died and she inherited 135 slaves, which included her half-aunts and uncles of the Hemings family, and . At Monticello, another of Randolph&#x27;s half-aunts, Sally Hemings (a daughter of John Wayles and Betty Hemings) had children with Thomas Jefferson.

When Randolph lived in Paris, she learned that there were countries where slavery was not legal and said to her father, &quot;I wish with all my soul that the poor Negroes were all freed&quot;. She also said, in keeping with the sentiments of her father, that she &quot;detested&quot; the unjust treatment of blacks, and the way that it fostered cruelty in whites. She attempted to keep slaves with their families when she could and did free some slaves, but she kept many that she later was forced to sell by creditors to settle outstanding debts. For instance, in 1827, after her father&#x27;s death, she sold 130 slaves, resulting in the separation of families. The remaining slaves were her most valuable assets, and she hired them out when she could for income. She sold two more slaves in 1833. She also punished enslaved people who did not do what she wanted, sometimes physically. In 1833 Randolph&#x27;s daughter Cornelia described an instance where she held a woman down while her mother whipped her, inflicting the flagellation &quot;pretty severely.&quot;

In 1831, her son Thomas unsuccessfully lobbied for a plan for Virginia to abolish slavery gradually and colonize slaves in Africa, a proposal that Randolph supported. She also considered moving to a free state. Although she freed several slaves in her wills, she relied on their efforts throughout her life.

== In popular culture ==
Martha Jefferson Randolph is the subject of the historical novel &quot;America&#x27;s First Daughter&quot; by Stephanie Dray and Laura Kamoie, published in March 2016. The novel draws heavily upon Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s letters.

In the 1995 film &quot;Jefferson in Paris&quot;, Martha Jefferson was portrayed by actress Gwyneth Paltrow.

In the 2000 four-hour CBS miniseries &quot;Sally Hemings An American Scandal&quot; written by Tina Andrews, Martha Jefferson was portrayed by actress Mare Winningham.

<text>In the United States, a &quot;&#x27;Department of Public Safety&quot; is a state or local government agency that often has a broad portfolio of responsibilities, which may include some or all of the following:

*Fire services: provides fire prevention and suppression.
* Rescue services: provides rescue services.
* Haz-mat services: provides hazardous materials response.
* Ambulance 
* Policing services: provides law enforcement, community policing and outreach.
* Emergency communications: operates the public interface emergency communications telephone system by providing the 9-1-1 and Enhanced 911 emergency telephone numbers.
* Office of Emergency Management (OEM): plans for and operates the emergency operations center during calamities, disasters, special events, and emergencies.
* Inspections and code enforcement: usually building safety, which includes construction, electrical et al., and vehicle inspections.
* Animal control: this category could also include wildlife officers, game wardens, and dog catchers.
* Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV): includes administration of driver&#x27;s licenses, license plates and identification cards.
* Department of Transportation (DOT): includes vehicle registration, tags, and license plates.

These responsibilities are usually organized into separate agencies under a DPS due to their diversity, though there is a critical exception in certain local jurisdictions (as further explained below).

In other countries, equivalent agencies may be known as the &quot;ministry of the interior&quot;. In U.S. state or local governments that do not have a DPS, equivalent agencies may be known as the &quot;department of emergency services&quot;.

==United States==
===Federal level===

The United States Department of Homeland Security is the federal-level department of public safety of the United States, which is responsible for federal supervision of emergency services for major disasters through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).

===State and territorial level===
In state governments in the United States, the DPS is often a law enforcement agency synonymous with the state police. At local and special district levels, they may be all-encompassing. Examples of states having these include Texas, Minnesota, Tennessee, Arizona, Alabama, Oklahoma, and South Carolina. In many states, the state police may be a subdivision of the DPS and not its independent department.

===Local level===
Many local jurisdictions (cities and counties), and special districts (schools and hospitals) have the umbrella configuration described above, in which the DPS is simply a joint administration of several distinct agencies. They may share administrative support staff and back-office functions, but sworn personnel remain specialized and have particular responsibilities (that is, the police continue to arrest people and the firefighters put out fires). The DPS of Cobb County, Georgia is one example.

However, a minority of jurisdictions have departments of public safety that have primary and direct responsibility for all emergencies. In these unusual organizations, all full-time sworn personnel are cross-trained as police officers, firefighters and EMTs, and can respond to emergencies in any capacity. Although it is more expensive to hire, train and retain such personnel, they have a clear advantage in terms of their flexibility. They can respond as first responders to many rapidly evolving situations rather than waiting for the arrival of other specialized personnel.

This configuration was more widely popular in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States but has since gone out of style because relatively few cities have been able to execute it successfully because of manpower limitations in handling major incidents.

In a few California cities (the San Gabriel Valley city of Duarte, for example), the Department of Public Safety usually is restricted to code enforcement officers or animal control service agents (especially when those cities contract out for law enforcement with the county sheriff&#x27;s office).

<text>A trifecta is a parimutuel bet placed on a horse race in which the bettor must predict which horses will finish first, second, and third, in the exact order. Known as a trifecta in the US and Australia, this is known as a tricast in the UK, a tierce in Hong Kong, a triactor in Canada and a tiercé in France. A trio, offered in Hong Kong and France, is a variation in which the order of the horses is not relevant.

==Variations==
===Boxed===
A &quot;boxed&quot; trifecta is where three horses are selected, and the player wins if these three horses finish first in any order. Boxed bets are effectively equivalent to placing standard trifecta bets on all six possible outcomes of the selected horses. For example, a boxed trifecta of horses numbered 6, 7 and 9, wins if horses finish in any of these combinations of outcomes: 
* 6, 7, 9
* 6, 9, 7
* 7, 6, 9
* 7, 9, 6
* 9, 6, 7
* 9, 7, 6.

===Banker===
One horse (the &quot;banker&quot;) is chosen to win the race, and two or more selections are boxed to come second and third. The &quot;banker&quot; must win in all possible combinations. For example, if horse number 2 is the banker, and the other three choices are numbered 6, 7 and 8, then there are a total six possible combinations for a winning bet: 
* 2, 6, 7
* 2, 6, 8
* 2, 7, 6
* 2, 7, 8
* 2, 8, 6
* 2, 8, 7.

===Roving banker or banker multiple===
One horse (the &quot;banker&quot;) is chosen to finish in the first three, and three or more selections are boxed for the other two places – the banker must finish either 1st, 2nd or 3rd in each possible combination. For example, if horse number 6 is the banker, and horses number 7, 8 and 9 are the selections, then there are total of eighteen combinations for a winning bet, each with horse number 6 in them, for example: 
* 6, 7, 8 
* 7, 6, 8 
* 7, 8, 6
* 6, 8, 9 
* 8, 9, 6, and so on. 

==History==
The term was first used in the 1970s, and was derived from &quot;perfecta&quot; (a bet on which horses will finish first and second) and &quot;tri-&quot; (three).

In the United States, the trifecta was introduced at Arlington Park in 1971. It was first used in Australia in April 1977 by TAB New South Wales, and was introduced in New Zealand in December 1983.

<doc id="1086559" wikidata="Q771245" url="?curid=1086559" title="Code reuse">
<text>Code reuse is the practice of using existing source code to develop software instead of writing new code. &quot;Software reuse&quot; is a broader term that implies using any existing software asset to develop software instead of developing it again. An asset that is relatively easy to reuse and offers significant value is considered to have high reusability.

Code reuse may be achieved different ways depending on a complexity of a programming language chosen and range from a lower-level approaches like code copy-pasting (e.g. via snippets), simple functions (procedures or subroutines) or a bunch of objects or functions organized into modules (e.g. libraries) or custom namespaces, and packages, frameworks or software suites in higher-levels.

Code reuse implies dependencies which can make code maintainability harder. 
At least one study found that code reuse at the class level reduces technical debt.

==Overview==

Ad hoc code reuse has been practiced from the earliest days of programming. Programmers have always reused sections of code, templates, functions, and procedures. Software reuse as a recognized area of study in software engineering, however, dates only from 1968 when Douglas McIlroy of Bell Laboratories proposed basing the software industry on reusable components.

Code reuse aims to save time and resources and reduce redundancy by taking advantage of assets that have already been created in some form within the software product development process. The key idea in reuse is that parts of a computer program written at one time can be or should be used in the construction of other programs written at a later time.

Code reuse may imply the creation of a separately maintained version of the reusable assets. While code is the most common resource selected for reuse, other assets generated during the development cycle may offer opportunities for reuse: software components, test suites, designs, documentation, and so on.

The software library is a good example of code reuse. Programmers may decide to create internal abstractions so that certain parts of their program can be reused, or may create custom libraries for their own use. Some characteristics that make software more easily reusable are modularity, loose coupling, high cohesion, information hiding and separation of concerns.

For newly written code to use a piece of existing code, some kind of interface, or means of communication, must be defined. These commonly include a &quot;call&quot; or use of a subroutine, object, class, or prototype. In organizations, such practices are formalized and standardized by domain engineering, also known as software product line engineering.

The general practice of using a prior version of an extant program as a starting point for the next version, is also a form of code reuse.

Some so-called code &quot;reuse&quot; involves simply copying some or all of the code from an existing program into a new one. While organizations can realize time to market benefits for a new product with this approach, they can subsequently be saddled with many of the same code duplication problems caused by cut and paste programming.

Many researchers have worked to make reuse faster, easier, more systematic, and an integral part of the normal process of programming. These are some of the main goals behind the invention of object-oriented programming, which became one of the most common forms of formalized reuse. A somewhat later invention is generic programming.

Another, newer means is to use software &quot;generators&quot;, programs which can create new programs of a certain type, based on a set of parameters that users choose. Fields of study about such systems are generative programming and metaprogramming.

==Types of reuse==
Concerning motivation and driving factors, reuse can be:
* Opportunistic – While getting ready to begin a project, the team realizes that there are existing components that they can reuse.
* Planned – A team strategically designs components so that they&#x27;ll be reusable in future projects.

Reuse can be categorized further:

* Internal reuse – A team reuses its own components. This may be a business decision, since the team may want to control a component critical to the project.
* External reuse – A team may choose to license a third-party component. Licensing a third-party component typically costs the team 1 to 20 percent of what it would cost to develop internally. The team must also consider the time it takes to find, learn and integrate the component.

Concerning form or structure of reuse, code can be:
* Referenced – The client code contains a reference to reused code, and thus they have distinct life cycles and can have distinct versions.
* Forked – The client code contains a local or private copy of the reused code, and thus they share a single life cycle and a single version.

Fork-reuse is often discouraged because it&#x27;s a form of code duplication, which requires that every bug is corrected in each copy, and enhancements made to reused code need to be manually merged in every copy or they become out-of-date. However, fork-reuse can have benefits such as isolation, flexibility to change the reused code, easier packaging, deployment and version management.

==Systematic==

Systematic software reuse is a strategy for increasing productivity and improving the quality of the software industry. Although it is simple in concept, successful software reuse implementation is difficult in practice. A reason put forward for this is the dependence of software reuse on the context in which it is implemented. Some problematic issues that need to be addressed related to systematic software reuse are: 
*a clear and well-defined product vision is an essential foundation to a software product line (SPL).
*an evolutionary implementation strategy would be a more pragmatic strategy for the company.
*there exist a need for continuous management support and leadership to ensure success.
*an appropriate organisational structure is needed to support SPL engineering.
*the change of mindset from a project-centric company to a product-oriented company is essential.

==Examples==

===Software libraries===

A very common example of code reuse is the technique of using a software library. Many common operations, such as converting information among different well-known formats, accessing external storage, interfacing with external programs, or manipulating information (numbers, words, names, locations, dates, etc.) in common ways, are needed by many different programs. Authors of new programs can use the code in a software library to perform these tasks, instead of &quot;re-inventing the wheel&quot;, by writing fully new code directly in a program to perform an operation. Library implementations often have the benefit of being well-tested and covering unusual or arcane cases. Disadvantages include the inability to tweak details which may affect performance or the desired output, and the time and cost of acquiring, learning, and configuring the library.

===Design patterns===

A design pattern is a general solution to a recurring problem. Design patterns are more conceptual than tangible and can be modified to fit the exact need. However, abstract classes and interfaces can be reused to implement certain patterns.

===Frameworks===

Developers generally reuse large pieces of software via third-party applications and frameworks, though frameworks are usually domain-specific and applicable only to families of applications.

===Higher-order function===

In functional programming higher-order functions can be used in many cases where design patterns or frameworks were formerly used.

===Retrocomputing===

Retrocomputing encompasses reuse of code, simply because retro programs are being run on older computers, or emulators for them.

===Computer security===
In computer security code-reuse is employed as a software exploit method.
When an attacker is not able to directly input code to modify the control flow of a program, for example in presence of code injection defenses such as W^X, he or she can redirect the control flow to code sequences existing in memory.

Examples of code-reuse attacks are return-to-libc attack, return-oriented programming, and jump-oriented programming.

===Components===

A component, in an object-oriented extent, represents a set of collaborative classes (or only one class) and its interfaces. The interfaces are responsible for enabling the replacement of components. Reusable components can also be isolated and synchronized between SCM repositories using component source code management technologies (CSCM).

===Outside computers===
The whole concept of &quot;code reuse&quot; can also encompass engineering applications outside software. For instance, parametric modeling in computer-aided design allows for creating reusable designs. Standardization results in creation of interoperable parts that can be then reused in many contexts.

== Criticism ==
Code reuse results in dependency on the component being reused. Rob Pike opined that &quot;A little copying is better than a little dependency&quot;. When he joined Google, the company was putting heavy emphasis on code reuse. He believes that Google&#x27;s codebase still suffers from results of that former policy in terms of compilation speed and maintainability.

Reusable code requires usually more effort to write and design. Fred Brooks discusses the significantly higher cost associated with that effort in his essays &quot;The Tar Pit&quot; and &quot;No Silver Bullet&quot; The fallacy is that effort is often spent without careful understanding of the mechanisms through which that cost will be redeemed. The justification often comes from incorrectly drawing parallels to reusable parts in a physical manufacturing process. Incorrect because writing code is analogous to design of a single product rather than production of multiple units.

<doc id="1086573" wikidata="Q74083" url="?curid=1086573" title="Ostracoderm">
<text>Ostracoderms () are the armored jawless fish of the Paleozoic Era. The term does not often appear in classifications today because it is paraphyletic (excluding jawed fishes and possibly the cyclostomes if anaspids are closer to them) and thus does not correspond to one evolutionary lineage. However, the term is still used as an informal way of loosely grouping together the armored jawless fishes.

An innovation of ostracoderms was the use of gills not for feeding, but exclusively for respiration. Earlier chordates with gill precursors used them for both respiration and feeding. Ostracoderms had separate pharyngeal gill pouches along the side of the head, which were permanently open with no protective operculum. Unlike invertebrates that use ciliated motion to move food, ostracoderms used their muscular pharynx to create a suction that pulled small and slow-moving prey into their mouths.

Swiss anatomist Louis Agassiz received some fossils of bony armored fish from Scotland in the 1830s. He had difficulty classifying them, as they did not resemble any living creature. He compared them at first with extant armored fish such as catfish and sturgeon, but later realized that they lacked movable jaws. Hence, he classified them in 1844 as a new group, named &quot;ostracoderms&quot; to mean &#x27;shell-skinned&#x27; (from Greek + ).

Ostracoderms have heads covered with a bony shield. They are among the earliest creatures with bony heads. The microscopic layers of that shield appear to evolutionary biologists, &quot;like they are composed of little tooth-like structures.&quot; Neil Shubin writes: &quot;Cut the bone of the [ostracoderm] skull open…pop it under a microscope and…you find virtually the same structure as in our teeth. There is a layer of enamel and even a layer of pulp. The whole shield is made up of thousands of small teeth fused together. This bony skull--one of the earliest in the fossil record--is made entirely of little teeth. Teeth originally arose to bite creatures (see Conodonts); later a version of teeth was used in a new way to protect them.&quot;

Ostracoderms existed in two major groups, the more primitive heterostracans and the cephalaspids. The cephalaspids were more advanced than the heterostracans in that they had lateral stabilizers for more control of their swimming.

It was long assumed that pteraspidomorphs and thelodonts were the only ostracoderms with paired nostrils, while the other groups have just a single median nostril. It has since been revealed that even if galeaspidans have just one external opening, it has two internal nasal organs.

After the appearance of jawed fish (placoderms, acanthodians, sharks, etc.) about 420 million years ago, most ostracoderm species underwent a decline, and the last ostracoderms became extinct at the end of the Devonian period. More recent research indicates that fish with jaws had far less to do with the extinction of the ostracoderms than previously assumed, as they coexisted without noticeable decline for about 30 million years.

The Subclass Ostracodermi has been placed in the division Agnatha along with the extant Subclass Cyclostomata, which includes lampreys and hagfishes.

<doc id="1086578" wikidata="Q742722" url="?curid=1086578" title="Erik Lindahl">
<text>Erik Lindahl (21 November 1891 – 6 January 1960) was a Swedish economist. He was professor of economics at Uppsala University 1942–58 and in 1956–59 he was the President of the International Economic Association. He was an also an advisor to the Swedish government and the central bank, and in 1943 was elected as a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. Lindahl posed the question of financing public goods in accordance with individual benefits. The quantity of the public good satisfies the requirement that the aggregate marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of providing the good.

Lindahl&#x27;s contributions to economic theory extend beyond his Wicksellian roots to embrace much of what is contained in modern Neo-Walrasian theory. Lindahl&#x27;s formulation of the concept of sequence economies and intertemporal equilibrium (1929, 1930) is by far the first rigorous attempt to do so. Lindahl&#x27;s couching of a theory of capital (1929, 1939) in intertemporal terms anticipates Malinvaud&#x27;s (1953) famous attempt. The transfer of Lindahl&#x27;s concepts to the anglophone world was accomplished by two of his most ardent supporters, John Hicks (1939, 1965) and Friedrich Hayek (1941). Since then, his work on &quot;sequence analysis&quot; has been given greater emphasis since the work of Frank Hahn (1973) and Roy Radner (1972). Lindahl&#x27;s 1919 solution to the pricing of public goods is another noticeable achievement, brought into modern economics by Duncan Foley (1970).

== Contributions to economic analysis ==
A Lindahl tax is a form of taxation in which individuals pay for public goods according to their marginal benefits. In other words, they pay according to the amount of satisfaction or utility they derive from the consumption of an additional unit of the public good.

It can be seen as an individual&#x27;s share of the collective tax burden of an economy. The optimal level of a public good is that quantity at which the willingness to pay for one more unit of the good, taken in totality for all the individuals is equal to the marginal cost of supplying that good. Lindahl tax is the optimal quantity times the willingness to pay for one more unit of that good at this quantity.

Erik Lindahl was deeply influenced in this by Knut Wicksell and proposed a method for financing public goods in order to show that consensus politics is possible. As people are different in nature, their preferences are different, and consensus requires each individual to pay a somewhat different tax for every service, or good that he consumes. If each person&#x27;s tax price is set equal to the marginal benefits received at the ideal service level, each person is made better off by provision of the public good and may accordingly agree to have that service level provided.

=== Lindahl equilibrium ===
Lindahl equilibrium is a state of economic equilibrium under a Lindahl tax as well as a method for finding the optimum level for the supply of public goods or services that happens when the total per-unit price paid by each individual equals the total per-unit cost of the public good. It can be shown that an equilibrium exists for different environments. Therefore, the Lindahl equilibrium describes how efficiency can be sustained in an economy with personalised prices. Leif Johansen gave the complete interpretation of the concept of &quot;Lindahl equilibrium&quot;, which assumes that household consumption decisions are based on the share of the cost they must provide for the supply of the particular public good.

The necessary and sufficient condition for such an equilibrium being:
*(i) the sum of the declared willingness be greater than the cost of provision and
*(ii) the minimum willingness to pay is positive and non-zero.

The importance of Lindahl equilibrium is that it fulfills the Samuelson condition and is therefore Pareto efficient, despite the good in question being a public one. It also demonstrates how efficiency can be reached in an economy with public goods by the use of personalised prices. The personalised prices equate the individual valuation for a public good to the cost of the public good.

<doc id="1086590" wikidata="Q1101209" url="?curid=1086590" title="Clifford Allen">
<text>Clifford Robertson Allen (January 6, 1912 – June 18, 1978) was an American attorney and Democratic politician who was a member of the Tennessee Senate from 1949 to 1951, and again from 1955 to 1959. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1975, where he served until his death.

==Early life and career==
Allen was born in Jacksonville, Florida, and graduated from Friends High School (now Sidwell Friends) in Washington, D.C. He graduated from the Cumberland School of Law in Lebanon, Tennessee in 1931 and was admitted to the Tennessee bar the same year. He was elected to a first term in the Tennessee State Senate in 1948. In 1950 he first ran for governor of Tennessee in the Democratic primary against incumbent governor Gordon Browning and was defeated in a very close election where Allen&#x27;s main issue was that the state should start providing free school textbooks to all school children. Running again in 1952 he was again defeated, running third (Frank G. Clement was the winner, with Browning finishing second). Allen was seen by some as the representative of the urban and progressive forces as opposed to those whose support was largely rural, such as Clement. He was also a staunch opponent of Boss Crump of Memphis, and was invariably opposed by the Crump political machine. The rivalry between Allen and Clement was such that on one occasion, health inspectors shut down a downtown Nashville restaurant owned by Allen, who got a court order allowing it to reopen. This was judged by Nashvillians to have been politically motivated, and the restaurant reopened to long lines.

Allen was elected to the State Senate again in 1954 where he was a strong advocate for teachers and the public schools. Allen urged enforcement of &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;. In 1958 he again entered the Democratic primary for governor, losing to Buford Ellington, a Clement colleague who had served Clement both as campaign manager and Cabinet member. During this period of what was essentially one-party rule in Tennessee (by the Democrats in the western two-thirds of the state and by the Republicans in East Tennessee), organized factions within the parties often served the role traditionally served by parties, nominating tickets of candidates who ran together, pooled their resources in advertising, and generally ran for office as a unit.

In January, 1957 the Tennessee State Senate refused to seat Richard Fulton, who had been elected to the seat formerly held by Allen. Fulton had run for the office in the place of his popular older brother Lyle, who had died of cancer shortly after entering the race to succeed Allen, but was several weeks short of having reached the constitutionally required age of 30 prior to the beginning of the legislative session, and Allen was appointed back to this seat again.

==Assessor of Property==
In 1960 Allen was elected Assessor of Property for Davidson County, Tennessee. This position was (and generally still is) widely regarded as an unglamorous administrative courthouse position, little-noticed by the public except when complaints are made about increasing property assessments. However, Allen was to make it his political base for the next 15 years. In 1962, Nashville voters agreed to merge many of the functions of the former City of Nashville municipal government and those of Davidson County into a metropolitan government. While the position of assessor of property (popularly referred to as &quot;tax assessor&quot;) was retained in the combined government, Allen decided to run for mayor of the consolidated city-county. Allen finished second behind long-time rival Beverly Briley, the last county judge (chief executive) of Davidson County. The new Metropolitan Charter required a runoff since no one received a majority, and Briley defeated Allen in the runoff.

Allen long had positioned himself as a populist, a defender of the rights of the elderly, impoverished, and &quot;average people&quot;. He worked to make a certain amount of property held by elderly homeowners with low incomes exempt from property tax. The issue with which he will be perennially identified in Tennessee political history is undoubtedly that of &quot;Question 3&quot;. The Tennessee State Constitution had stood unamended from 1870 to 1952, the longest any such document had ever stood such in the world. In part, this was due to the extremely difficult procedure set by the document for amendment. One of the methods permitted allowed the legislature to put on the ballot a call for a limited constitutional convention, one which would be limited to discussion and proposals on only those parts of the constitution named in the call. This procedure was limited to once in a six-year period; beginning in the 1950s conventions began to be held almost as often as allowable, and had made considerable changes in the state&#x27;s basic document, such as allowing city-county consolidation as alluded to above and also for other updatings such as the extension of gubernatorial and state senate terms from two to four years, allowing legislators to be paid over and above expense money, and other similar modernizations. Allen began to shape the 1971 convention to suit his principal issue. In Tennessee, the rate of assessment to appraisal on property taxes had long varied from county to county, with some counties applying the entire rate (expressed as dollars and cents per hundred of value such as &quot;$1.27&quot;) on the entire appraised value of a property; most others applied a percentage of it, which varied wildly (from as low as 25% to as high as 70%). This system was needlessly confusing and arcane, and made comparison of tax rates from one jurisdiction to another very difficult (which some stated was one of the prime reasons for its existence). Allen managed to explain this difficult and confusing issue in such a way as to win a large majority for the holding of a constitutional convention in which it would be discussed. It was known as &quot;Question 3&quot; because the legislature at the same time proposed four other constitutional sections for discussion at the same convention; however these other propositions were all voted down, limiting the scope of the convention solely to the property tax issue. Allen was aided by the existence of the six-year limit between such events; opponents of a state income tax were aware that if a convention were to be held and limited to the property tax issue, another one at which an income tax might be proposed could not be held for at least another six years.

Having helped pass the call for the convention, Allen then set out to shape it to his ideas, firstly by winning election to it as a delegate while continuing to serve as assessor of property. Allen soon became the leading figure of the convention, and its proposal, which called for an assessment of 25% of appraised value on residential and agricultural property and 40% on commercial property and even higher on utilities, was essentially Allen&#x27;s plan, and was subsequently approved by Tennessee voters and remains the law as of 2012 except that the U.S. Senate overrode the higher tax rate on utilities at the urging of Senator Howard Baker. This victory helped to assuage the defeat which Allen had suffered earlier in the year, when he lost another race for mayor. In this race Allen was shocked to have finished fourth, well short of participation in the runoff (which again was won by Briley over runner-up Casey Jenkins, a former motion picture projectionist who had gained notoriety largely as an opponent of forced busing for school desegregation). Progressives such as Allen in this election were hurt by the busing decision that was announced in the month before the election and fueled massive white turnout for the anti-integration candidates such as Jenkins.

==Congressman==

In 1975 when Richard Fulton was elected mayor to succeed Briley and resigned as Congressman, Allen entered the crowded Democratic primary field in the ensuing special election, and won, beating the incumbent district attorney Thomas Shriver, legislator Mike Murphy, and attorney (later federal Sixth Circuit judge) Gilbert Merritt, largely because of having far more name recognition than any other candidate and because of his populist attack on high rates being charged by local electric and gas utilities. As the Republicans had by this time given up on making serious bids for a district they hadn&#x27;t won since Reconstruction, his victory in the special general election was a foregone conclusion, and he took office on November 25, 1975.

Once in Congress, Allen tried immediately to establish a high profile for a freshman legislator, to the consternation of some and the disdain of others. His primary issue was the higher electricity rates being charged by the Tennessee Valley Authority, primarily in order to finance its ambitious nuclear energy program. Allen called for the adoption by the TVA of &quot;lifeline rates&quot;, a low, subsidized rate for low-income, low-volume electric users who would essentially be subsidized by the utility&#x27;s major customers. TVA management objected vehemently to Allen&#x27;s proposal, stating that it violated provisions of the TVA Self-Financing Act of 1959 which required all of the agency&#x27;s power operations to be self-financing and unsubsidized, and would further dissuade new large customers from moving into its service area as opposed to adjoining areas where they would not be subject to such a scheme. The idea apparently was well received by a majority of Nashville-area voters, however; Allen was elected to a full term in November 1976.

However, Allen was regarded by many as increasingly a relic of an earlier era; he tended to address all issues at discursive length in the tradition of Southern country lawyers. In some circles in Washington, he was given the derisive nickname &quot;The Tennessee Talking Horse&quot;, as an indication of his perceived verbosity (a title previously held by former Memphis Congressman Dan Kuykendall). Other politicians felt that Allen might be vulnerable in 1978; several filed to run against him in the 1978 Democratic primary. However, only days before the deadline for withdrawing from the primary race, Allen suffered a massive heart attack. All but one of his opponents then withdrew from the race as they were concerned about the possible repercussions of &quot;kicking a man when he is down&quot;. On June 11, the day after the withdrawal deadline passed, Allen died. The only candidate who didn&#x27;t withdraw from the race a few days earlier, State Senator Bill Boner, thus appeared alone on the Democratic primary ballot. While one of the erstwhile opponents, Elliot Ozment, then tried to conduct a write-in campaign, this proved totally futile, and Boner won the nomination, and in effect, election in November.

Allen died at St. Thomas Hospital in Nashville from complications of a heart attack on June 18, 1978, aged 66.

<doc id="1086599" wikidata="Q20724" url="?curid=1086599" title="Louis Couturat">
<text>Louis Couturat (; 17 January 1868 – 3 August 1914) was a French logician, mathematician, philosopher, and linguist. Couturat was a pioneer of the constructed language Ido.

== Life and education ==
Born in Paris. In 1887 he entered École Normale Supérieure to study philosophy and mathematics. In 1895 he lectured in philosophy at the University of Toulouse and 1897 lectured in philosophy of mathematics at the University of Caen Normandy, taking a stand in favor of transfinite numbers. After a time in Hanover studying the writings of Leibniz, he became an assistant to Henri-Louis Bergson at the Collège de France in 1905.

== Career ==
He was the French advocate of the symbolic logic that emerged in the years before World War I, thanks to the writings of Charles Sanders Peirce, Giuseppe Peano and his school, and especially to &quot;The Principles of Mathematics&quot; by Couturat&#x27;s friend and correspondent Bertrand Russell. Like Russell, Couturat saw symbolic logic as a tool to advance both mathematics and the philosophy of mathematics. In this, he was opposed by Henri Poincaré, who took considerable exception to Couturat&#x27;s efforts to interest the French in symbolic logic. With the benefit of hindsight, we can see that Couturat was in broad agreement with the logicism of Russell, while Poincaré anticipated Brouwer&#x27;s intuitionism.

His first major publication was &quot;De Platonicis mythis&quot; (1896). In 1901, he published &quot;La Logique de Leibniz&quot;, a detailed study of Leibniz the logician, based on his examination of the huge Leibniz &quot;Nachlass&quot; in Hanover. Even though Leibniz had died in 1716, his &quot;Nachlass&quot; was cataloged only in 1895. Only then was it possible to determine the extent of Leibniz&#x27;s unpublished work on logic. In 1903, Couturat published much of that work in another large volume, his &quot;Opuscules et Fragments Inedits de Leibniz&quot;, containing many of the documents he had examined while writing &quot;La Logique&quot;. Couturat was thus the first to appreciate that Leibniz was the greatest logician during the more than 2000 years that separate Aristotle from George Boole and Augustus De Morgan. A significant part of the 20th century Leibniz revival is grounded in Couturat&#x27;s editorial and exegetical efforts. This work on Leibniz attracted Russell, also the author of a 1900 book on Leibniz, and thus began their professional correspondence and friendship.

In 1905, Couturat published a work on logic and the foundations of mathematics (with an appendix on Kant&#x27;s philosophy of mathematics) that was originally conceived as a translation of Russell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Mathematics&quot;. In the same year, he published &quot;L&#x27;Algèbre de la logique&quot;, a classic introduction to Boolean algebra and the works of C.S. Peirce and Ernst Schröder.

In 1907, Couturat helped found the constructed language Ido, an offshoot of Esperanto, and was Ido&#x27;s principal advocate over the remainder of his life. By advocating a constructed international language, constructed along logical principles and with a vocabulary taken from existing European languages, Couturat was paralleling Peano&#x27;s advocacy of Interlingua. By pushing Ido, Couturat walked in Leibniz&#x27;s footsteps; Leibniz called for the creation a universal symbolic and conceptual language he named the characteristica universalis.

Couturat, a confirmed pacifist, was killed when his car was hit by a car carrying orders for the mobilization of the French Army, in the first stage of World War I.

He appears as a character in Joseph Skibell&#x27;s 2010 novel, &quot;A Curable Romantic&quot;.

<doc id="1086606" wikidata="Q8659" url="?curid=1086606" title="Khutughtu Khan Kusala">
<text>Khutughtu Khan (; Mongolian script: ; ), born Kuśala (Mongolian: Хүслэн ; ; , meaning &quot;virtuous&quot;/&quot;wholesome&quot;), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Mingzong of Yuan (; 22 December 1300 – 30 August 1329), was a son of Khayishan (Emperor Wuzong) who seized the throne of the Yuan dynasty of China in 1329, but died in suspicious circumstances six months later. Apart from the Emperor of China, he is considered as the 13th Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, although it was only nominal due to the division of the empire.

== Early life and exile ==
Kusala was the eldest son of Khayishan (Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong) and a Mongol-Ikhires woman. Due to the unstable balance present in the Khayishan administration with the tense rivalry between Khayishan, his younger brother Ayurbarwada and their mother Dagi of the Khongirad clan, Khayishan appointed Ayurbarwada as Crown Prince on the condition that he would pass the status to Kusala after succession.

However, after Khayishan&#x27;s death, Ayurbarwada succeeded to the throne in 1311. In 1320, Dagi, Temüder and other members of the Khongirad faction installed Ayurbarwada&#x27;s son Shidebala as the new ruler instead of Kusala, due to the knowledge of Kusala coming from an Ikhires background, rather than the more noble Khongirad lineage.

To ensure Shidebala&#x27;s succession, Kusala was rewarded with the title of king of Chou and relegated to Yunnan in 1316; but fled to Esen Bukha-ruled Chagatai Khanate in Central Asia, as a pro-Khayishan official advised, after a failed revolt in Shaanxi. When the Chagatayid Khan Esen Bukha heard that Kusala was living near his realm, he came to greet him. After that, Kusala was backed by the Chagatayid princes. While in exile in Central Asia, he married Mailaiti, a daughter of Temuder of the Qarluq.

== Brief accession and sudden death ==

Although the rival faction was purged by Yesün Temür Khan (Emperor Taiding) when Shidibala Khan (Emperor Yingzong) was assassinated, he remained in Central Asia. He extended his influence in his stronghold, which was located to the west of Altai Mountains.

In 1328, when Yesün Temür Khan died, a civil war known as the War of the Two Capitals erupted between Shangdu-based Ragibagh and Dadu-based Tugh Temür. The former was a son of Yesün Temür and was backed up the former Yesün Temür administration led by Dawlat Shah, and the latter was Kuśala&#x27;s younger brother who was supported by the former Khayishan faction led by the Qipchaq commander El Temür and the Merkit commander Bayan, a governor in Henan. This ended in the victory of Tugh Temür since he secured support from most of the princes, aristocrats and warlords in the south of the Gobi Desert. Tugh Temür summoned his brother to come to Dadu.

At the same time, Kuśala, with support from the Chaghadayid leaders Eljigidey and Duwa Temür, entered Mongolia from the Tarbagatai region (in the Khangai Mountains). He also got support from princes and generals of Mongolia, and with overwhelming military power in the background, put pressure on Tugh Temür, who had already ascended the throne. Kuśala enthroned himself on 27 February 1329, north of Karakorum.

Tugh Temür abdicated on 3 April 1329, and a month later El Temür brought the imperial seal to Kuśala in Mongolia, announcing Dadu&#x27;s intent to welcome him. Kuśala responded by making Tugh Temür his heir apparent on 15 May. Kuśala had proceeded to appoint his own loyal followers to important posts in the Secretariat, the Bureau of Military Affairs, and the Censorate.

Taking 1,800 men with him, Kuśala set out for Dadu. On 26 August, he met with Tugh Temür in Ongghuchad (Onggachatu), where Tugh Temur had built the city of Zhongdu. He suddenly died only 4 days after a banquet with Tugh Temür. The Yuan shi states that the luckless Kuśala Khan died of violence. It seems that Kuśala was poisoned by El Temür, who feared losing power to princes and officers of the Chagatai Khanate and Mongolia, who followed Kuśala. Tugh Temür was restored to the throne on 8 September.

== Family ==
Khutughtu Khan had two wives who were Mailaiti, a descendant of the famous Qarluq chief, Arslan, who submitted to Genghis Khan and Babusha of the Naiman. They gave birth to two Mongol emperors, including Toghon Temür, the last Mongolian emperor to rule China.

<doc id="1086615" wikidata="Q451894" url="?curid=1086615" title="Eric Balfour">
<text>Eric Salter Balfour (born April 24, 1977) is an American actor. He made his film debut in the Lifetime movie &quot;No One Would Tell&quot; in 1996, followed by the drama &quot;Shattered Image&quot; (1998), followed by roles in &quot;What Women Want&quot; (2000), Rise of the Gargoyles (2009) and &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; (2003). His roles on television include Milo Pressman on the action-thriller TV series &quot;24&quot;, a recurring role in the drama &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; as Gabriel Dimas, Duke Crocker in &quot;Haven&quot;, Eddie on &quot;The OC&quot;, and as Boone in Country Comfort.

==Early life==
Balfour was born to a Jewish family in Los Angeles, California, the son of David Balfour, a chiropractor, and Sharon (née Salter), who works as a marriage and family counselor. He has a younger sister.

He described his household growing up as &quot;creative&quot; and said that his family often made trips to the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, California.

==Career==
Balfour appeared on the kids TV show &quot;Kids Incorporated&quot; for one season in 1991. During the early 1990s, he had a variety of minor juvenile roles on television series such as &quot;Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman&quot;, &quot;Arresting Behavior&quot;, &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; and &quot;Step by Step&quot;. In 1997, he appeared in the first two episodes of &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot; as Jesse McNally, one of the show&#x27;s first victims. Eric was a regular on the HBO series &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; as Gabriel Dimas in 2001. He appeared as a regular cast member in three short-lived TV shows. &quot;&quot; was cancelled after four episodes in 2003, &quot;Hawaii&quot; was canceled after seven episodes in 2004, and &quot;Sex, Love &amp; Secrets&quot; was canceled after four episodes. Also in 2005, Balfour starred in the sexually explicit Canadian drama &quot;Lie with Me&quot; with Lauren Lee Smith. In March 2006, Balfour debuted as Brian Peluso on producer Dick Wolf&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Conviction&quot;, which lasted one season. Balfour was also a guest star on the hit show &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; in the ninth episode of the first season.
He starred in the 2003 remake of &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; with Jessica Biel. He played a minor character in several episodes of &quot;The O.C.&quot; as Eddie, Theresa&#x27;s fiancé.

Balfour appeared in seven episodes of the first season of &quot;24&quot; as computer technician Milo Pressman in 2001. Five years later, Balfour reprised the role for 19 episodes of &quot;24&quot;&#x27;s sixth season before leaving the show by his own request. Balfour appeared in &quot;Life on Mars&quot; as Eddie Carling, the brother of detective Ray Carling.

<text>Orley Farm School is one of the largest coeducational preparatory day schools in the London borough of Harrow, at the foot of Harrow Hill on South Hill Avenue. The school grounds cover . Orley Farm was founded in 1850 as the preparatory school for the nearby Harrow School, but is now a fully private school in its own right and leavers continue to a variety of other private schools.

==History==
Orley Farm has evolved since September 1850 from a boarding school for boys preparing for Harrow, to a co-educational day school.

In 1984, the Official Grant of Arms was awarded. The arms and crest have three historical sources: (1) the stag holding an oak leaf is the Trollope family crest (due to the 1862 renaming of the school after Anthony Trollope&#x27;s novel &quot;Orley Farm&quot;, which describes the buildings and grounds once owned by the Trollopes and later occupied by the school); (2) crossed arrows and a silver laurel wreath are included on the Harrow arms; and (3) the &quot;Hurst&quot; of oak trees on the shield and sprig of oak in the badge refer to the Gardner family. The motto, &quot;Haec cogitate&quot;, &quot;think on these things&quot;, comes from St Paul&#x27;s Epistle to the Philippians 4:8.

Orley Farm was originally a traditional boarding prep school similar to the likes of Ludgrove and Heatherdown Preparatory Schools. In 1984, boarding was phased out and the dormitories were converted to classrooms. In 1994, the school administration made the landmark decision of admitting girls for the first time. The Pre-Preparatory department was built and opened in 1995.

===Edge===
Orley Farm features the Edge Programme, which consists of five sections: Work Place Skills, Service, The World Around Us, Life Skills, and 13 Things to do before 13.

==Houses==
Each pupil and staff is randomly assigned to one of the four houses upon entry: Broadrick, Julians, Hastings, or Hopkins. The houses are named after former headmasters and activities are overseen by house teachers.

==New Buildings==

===Butler Hall===
In July 2015, the first of four major building projects came online after the school invested just under £10 million to upgrade the facilities. The new dining hall overlooking the pool was named after Lord Butler, a former pupil, who visited the school to open the building.

===Elliott Block===
In September 2015, the original music school was turned into a building called the Elliott Block. It consists of new facilities supporting Drama and Music and was named after Ian Elliott, a former Headmaster.

===Davies Library===
In September 2015, the Davies Library was reopened having moved it from the old Gardner building and tripling the size. It was opened by Justin Davies, a former Headmaster.

===Gardner Building===
In February 2016, the new Gardner Building opened with 12 refurbished classrooms joined to the Elliott Building via an enclosed bridge. The Mathematics, English, Science, and Computer Science departments are now all housed in this facility.

==Former Pupils==

*Hassan Damluji, author and international development expert
*Robin Butler, retired senior civil servant
*Alastair Fothergill, producer
*Keir Giles, academic
*Matthew Gould, former Ambassador to Israel, now Head of Cyber Security
*Anthony Horowitz, author and screenwriter

<text>A Riemannian submanifold formula_1 of a Riemannian manifold formula_2 is a submanifold formula_1 of formula_2 equipped with the Riemannian metric inherited from formula_2.

Specifically, if formula_6 is a Riemannian manifold (with or without boundary) and formula_7 is an immersed submanifold or an embedded submanifold (with or without boundary), the pullback formula_8 of formula_9 is a Riemannian metric on formula_1, and formula_11 is said to be a Riemannian submanifold of formula_6. On the other hand, if formula_1 already has a Riemannian metric formula_14, then the immersion (or embedding) formula_7 is called an [[isometric immersion]] (or [[isometric embedding]]) if formula_16. Hence isometric immersions and isometric embeddings are Riemannian submanifolds.

For example, the n-sphere formula_17 is an embedded Riemannian submanifold of formula_18 via the inclusion map formula_19 that takes a point in formula_20 to the corresponding point in the superset formula_18. The induced metric on formula_20 is called the round metric.

<text>The Municipality of Trent Lakes is a lower-tier township in the rural, mostly wooded northern section of Peterborough County, Ontario, Canada. The municipality has a primarily cottage and tourist industry based economy but has grown year round residency due to its commute distance to the Greater Toronto Area.

In 1998 the Township of Galway-Cavendish and the Township of Harvey were amalgamated by Minister&#x27;s Order to become Galway-Cavendish and Harvey. The Municipality of Trent Lakes adopted its new name by By-law B2013-017 on February 19, 2013. The name was in recognition of the Trent-Severn Waterway which plays a major role in the cottage history and tourism economy of the area. The Municipality is part of the Kawartha Lakes Tourism Area and contains numerous tributary lakes, rivers and creeks contributing water level support to the nationally historic Trent-Severn Waterway system. Lock 31 in Buckhorn is the only Trent-Severn Waterway boat lock located within the municipality.

==Geography==

Trent Lakes is home to Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park, which is set around Catchacoma Lake and Mississagua Lake. A Natural Environment Park permitting &quot;backcountry&quot; camping and primarily a water access only interior. Three violent summer wind storms have hit this area doing damage to property and forest, one in 1927, then 1995 and in 2006. The area is also a popular cottaging and recreational area.

Trent Lakes consists mostly of Precambrian Shield, dating from 600 to 1,200 million years. The granite is normally pink but interlaced with other colours of white and black as one heads north. These areas are primarily &quot;igneous&quot; granite which was subject to intense heat and pressure during the movement of the Earth&#x27;s crust. The changes took place as the rock mixed with other elements in the Earth&#x27;s crust. The mixture is mostly with black and white marble. The region also has sections of limestone flats. When the lakes that covered most of Lake Ontario dried up some 450 million years ago the lake sediments hardened and lifted to form a top layer of limestone over the area. With the ice age small glaciers left a thin layer of soil. The area around what is known as Flynn&#x27;s Turn (intersection of Peterborough County Road 36 and Country Road 507) is a prime example of a limestone flat.

On Highway 49 you can see the evidence of what is called a limestone ridge (&quot;Ordovician strata&quot;). This same ridge extends to Lower Buckhorn Lake and the erosion on the northern edge has created a scarp (or steep cliff) some high in areas.

Sandy Lake and the beach area has a unique soft turquoise colour. This is a white &quot;marl&quot; lake bottom and is spring fed. Surrounded by a limestone karst runoff enters into the lake with very little organic material and this contributes to the unique greenish-blue colouration. The marl bottom is extremely soft and rich with minerals.

The community is a scenic location where Paleozoic limestone formations yield to the underlying Precambrian bedrock of pink gneiss; as a result, it attracts a large number of summer residents and visitors.

===Communities===
Trent Lakes identifies three wards within the municipality; Harvey Ward, Galway Ward and Cavendish Ward. The three wards are based on traditional geographic boundaries and for election purposes there is still Municipal Council representatives for Harvey and Galway-Cavendish. This was a result of the 1998 amalgamation of the townships of Galway-Cavendish and Harvey.

The municipality has many community subdivisions concentrated around the many lakes. Several of the communities were originally intended for cottage use but today many of the subdivisions contain year round residents. There are two municipally-owned drinking water supply systems. One in the Buckhorn Lakes Estates subdivision and the other servicing the Pirates Glen and Alpine Village subdivisions. Other residences must rely on private wells.

The hamlet of Buckhorn is situated on the border of the Municipality of Trent Lakes and the Township of Selwyn. The main downtown core is situated on the Trent Lakes side. A span of two bridges connect the hamlet. One bridge spans Trent-Severn Waterway Lock 31 on the Trent Lakes side. The second span is over the Buckhorn dam on the Township of Selwyn side.

There is one public school in the municipality of Trent Lakes. It is the Buckhorn Public School. Being a rural municipality all other children are bused to local schools outside of the municipality, being serviced by the Kawartha Pine Ridge District (Public) School Board and the Peterborough Victoria Northumberland &amp; Clarington Catholic School Board.

There are three municipal Community Centres in Trent Lakes; the Galway Community Centre, the Cavendish Community Centre, and Lakehurst Hall. They offer a variety of programs and services. There is also the independently operated and volunteer based Buckhorn Community Centre.

The Trent Lakes Public Library has two locations. The Buckhorn Branch is located in the main core of Buckhorn. The Helen Bowen Branch is located in the Cavendish Community Centre and often referred to simply as the Cavendish Branch.

Trent Lakes currently has two medical health centres, the Buckhorn Regional Health Centre and the Kinmount and District Health Centre.

The border of the Municipality of Trent Lakes is Gannons Narrows in the southeast, Buckhorn on the east (shared with Selwyn Township) and almost to Burleigh Falls in the northeast (includes Perry&#x27;s Creek). The rapids and falls at Burleigh Falls are often thought to be in Trent Lakes but this is a mistake. The Burleigh Falls Inn and island are actually in the Township of North Kawartha and the dam, rapids and falls are in the Township of Selwyn.

Kinmount is in the far northwest tip of Trent Lakes. The village is apportioned by the three municipalities of City of Kawartha Lakes, Minden Hills and Trent Lakes. The Kinmount Fairgrounds is the site of the Kinmount Fair under the care and ownership of the Kinmount Agricultural Society. The fair is held the Labour Day weekend and heavily attended. The fair celebrated its 150th edition in 2020.

Trent Lakes is also connected to the Township of Selwyn by a causeway and span of bridge at Gannon Narrows. The bridge spans the actual narrows connecting (Upper) Buckhorn Lake with Pigeon Lake.

Current and some historic communities are Alpine Village, Buckhorn, Buckhorn Lake Estates, Catchacoma, Crystal Lake, Ewan, Flynns, Fortescue, Kawartha Hideaway, Lakehurst, Mississagua Landing, Mount Irwin, Nogies Creek, Oak Shores Estates, Pirates Glen, Point Pleasant, Rockcroft and Sugar Bush and the area has numerous cottager and ratepayer associations.

==History==
The lumber and agricultural industries are significant to the history of the township. Due to the topography of the region, agricultural production was limited to only certain areas where soil conditions were adequate and cattle and mixed farming (orchards, cattle, horses, sheep, grains, vegetables, chickens and turkeys) were the predominant formats. Lumber production in the area led to the construction of standing timber lumber camps, with the numerous waterways allowing the transport of that lumber to production and processing mills in the area. This led to the development of settlements of forestry workers, but non-resident lumber barons took most of the gains from the industry. With the decline of the lumber industry, the settlements in the region also grew less populous. The French Canadians, Irish immigrants and other lumber labourers moved to other thriving locations, leaving smaller groups in the region. Galway, Cavendish and Harvey wards all have ghost settlements and nearly-forgotten communities including Silver Lake, Rockcroft, Scotts Mills, Fortesque. Following World War II, the area became popular as a camping and cottaging area.

The area is rich in early First Nations sites, and many First Nations members live in the community year-round or seasonally on some of the islands in Lovesick Lake.

The old Harvey fire tower was located at the southern edge of Mississagua Lake (then known as Gull Lake). It was one of the 320 towers in the province used as an early warning in the detection of forest fires. Part of the Lindsay Forest District of towers this tower had its own phone line connection back to headquarters. The phone line still runs through the forest and up the hill to the old towers footings. In 1927 the Harvey tower was made of wood, but a hurricane came through and blew it over. Parts of the tower were found miles away. A newer wood tower was built in its place, that is, until 1938 when a light steel tower had been erected. The tower system was abandoned by 1970 when aerial detection became favoured and the tower dismantled.

Initially, the municipality of Trent Lakes was made up of two townships, the township of Galway-Cavendish and the township of Harvey. In 1998, the provincial government of Ontario planned for a reduction in the number of municipal governments throughout the province. The two townships, located in the same corner of Peterborough County, had much in common economically, topographically, and historically and agreed to amalgamate. They became the Township of Galway-Cavendish and Harvey, recognising the composite parts of the new municipality. However, on February 19, 2013, the township changed its name again, this time to its current name, recognising the role of the tourist and cottage industry of the Trent Severn Waterway system.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Trent Lakes had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


Mother tongue (2021):
* English as first language: 92.8%
* French as first language: 0.9%
* English and French as first language: 0.2%
* Other as first language: 5.4%

== Government ==
Trent Lakes is led by a mayor, deputy mayor and three councillors. The current council was elected in 2022 and will serve a four-year term to 2026. They are:
*Mayor: Terry Lambshead
*Deputy Mayor: Carol Armstrong
*Councillors: Joe Cadigan (Galway-Cavendish Ward), John Braybrook (Harvey Ward), Peter Franzen (Councillor at Large)

The Mayor and Deputy Mayor represent Trent Lakes at meetings of Peterborough County Council.

==Recreation==
Boaters use the Trent–Severn Waterway Lock 31, located in the hamlet of Buckhorn. The lock is situated between Lower Buckhorn Lake and Upper Buckhorn and is one of the busiest locks on the Waterway system.

Wolf Island Provincial Park is a water access only park established in 1985. The largest portion of the park is Wolf Island, an island located between Lower Buckhorn and Lovesick lakes. This is a &#x27;non-operating&#x27; park with no facilities. You must carry-in and carry-out all items.

The area is also known for the Kawartha Highlands Provincial Park established in 1989. The park has a number of canoe routes, backcountry camping and trails. The park is the second largest in southern Ontario. The park has limited facilities, including limited parking.

John Earle Chase Memorial Park is a park located in the vicinity of Gannons Narrows on the shore of Pigeon Lake and offers day use only trails. There are no facilities at this free park and you must carry-in and carry-out all items. The land for the park was donated in 1995 to Trent-Severn Waterway, Parks Canada, in 1995 by the Chase family, which had farmed the area for several generations.

<text>The Leopard&#x27;s Spots: A Romance of the White Man&#x27;s Burden—1865–1900 is the first novel of Thomas Dixon&#x27;s Reconstruction trilogy, and was followed by &quot;The Clansman: A Historical Romance of the Ku Klux Klan&quot; (1905), and &quot;The Traitor: A Story of the Fall of the Invisible Empire&quot; (1907). In the novel, published in 1902, Dixon offers an account of Reconstruction in which he portrays a Reconstruction leader (and former slave driver), Northern carpetbaggers, and emancipated slaves as the villains; Ku Klux Klan members are anti-heroes. While the playbills and program for &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; claimed &quot;The Leopard&#x27;s Spots&quot; as a source in addition to &quot;The Clansman&quot;, recent scholars do not accept this.

The first half of a passage from the Book of Jeremiah (13:23) is included on the title page: &quot;Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?&quot; While the full passage is about evildoers refusing to turn away from evil to good, the title conveys the idea that, as leopards could not change their spots, people of African origin could not change what Dixon, as a racist and white supremacist, viewed as inherently negative character traits.

==A reply to &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;==
Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s landmark novel of 1852, &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin; or, Life Among the Lowly&quot;, had a profound effect on attitudes toward African Americans and slavery in the U.S. and is said to have &quot;helped lay the groundwork for the Civil War&quot;. It was still widely read fifty years after its publication. According to Dixon, whose contact with the work was a dramatized version, Stowe &quot;grossly misrepresent[ed]&quot; the American South, and he felt her sympathetic portrayal of African Americans demanded revision. So as to make it clear he is answering Stowe, he presents his version of Stowe&#x27;s characters, using Stowe&#x27;s character names.

==Characters==
===Leading characters of the story (as listed in the book) ===
* Charles Gaston – A man who dreams of making it to the Governor&#x27;s Mansion 
* Sallie Worth – A daughter of the old-fashioned South 
* Gen. Daniel Worth – Her father 
* Mrs. Worth – Sallie&#x27;s mother 
* The Rev. John Durham – A preacher who threw his life away 
* Mrs. Durham – Of the Southern Army that never surrendered
* Tom Camp – A one-legged Confederate soldier 
* Flora – Tom&#x27;s little daughter 
* Simon Legree – Ex-slave driver and Reconstruction leader 
* Allan Mcleod – A scalawag
* Hon. Everett Lowell – Member of Congress from Boston 
* Helen Lowell – His daughter 
* Miss Susan Walker – A maiden of Boston 
* Major Stuart Dameron – Chief of the Ku Klux Klan 
* Hose Norman – A dare-devil poor white man 
* Nelse – A black hero of the old régime
* Aunt Eve – His wife – &quot;a respectable woman.&quot; 
* Hon. Tim Sheldby – Political boss of the new era 
* Hon. Pete Sawyer – Sold seven times, got the money once 
* George Harris Jr. – An Educated Negro, son of Eliza 
* Dick – An unsolved riddle

===Using names of characters in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;===
* Simon Legree – In &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;; a cruel master, hateful of religion, superstitious, and determined to “break” Tom 
* Tom Camp – In Stowe&#x27;s novel Tom (no last name) is a humble African-American slave and &quot;Mr. Shelby&#x27;s best hand&quot;. Dixon&#x27;s Tom is a former Confederate soldier, a poor white Christian whose family is victimized by black men.
* Hon. Tim Shelby – Political boss. In &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; Arthur Shelby was Tom&#x27;s owner, who &quot;sold him South&quot;. His son George Shelby is also a character.
* George Harris Jr. – An educated negro

==Dramatization==
A dramatization by Dixon, with the same title, was produced in New York in 1913.

<text>Avaris (Egyptian: ḥw.t wꜥr.t, sometimes &quot;hut-waret&quot;; ; ; ) was the Hyksos capital of Egypt located at the modern site of Tell el-Dab&#x27;a in the northeastern region of the Nile Delta. As the main course of the Nile migrated eastward, its position at the hub of Egypt&#x27;s delta emporia made it a major capital suitable for trade. It was occupied from about the 18th century BC until its capture by Ahmose I.

==Etymology==

The name in the Egyptian language of the 2nd millennium BC was probably pronounced *Ḥaʔət-Waʕrəʔ “House of the Region” and denotes the capital of an administrative division of the land (&quot;wʕr.t&quot;). Today, the name &quot;Hawara&quot; survives, referring to the site at the entrance to Faiyum. Alternatively, Clement of Alexandria referred to the name of this city as &quot;Athyria&quot;.

==Excavations==
In 1885, the Swiss Édouard Naville started the first excavations in the area around Tell-el-Daba. Between 1941 and 1942, Labib Habachi, an Egyptian Egyptologist first forwarded the idea that the site could be identified with Avaris. Between 1966 and 1969 and since 1975, the site has been excavated by the Austrian Archaeological Institute. Using radar imaging technology, its scientists could identify in 2010 the outline of the city including streets, houses, a port, and a side arm of the River Nile passing through the city.

The site at Tell el-Dab&#x27;a, covering an area of about 2 square kilometers, is in ruins today, but excavations have shown that, at one point, it was a well-developed center of trade with a busy harbour catering to over 300 ships during a trading season. Artifacts excavated at a temple erected in the Hyksos period have produced goods from all over the Aegean world. The temple even has Minoan-like wall paintings that are similar to those found on Crete at the Palace of Knossos. A large mudbrick tomb has also been excavated to the west of the temple, where grave goods, such as copper swords, have been found.

==History==

The site was originally founded by Amenemhat I on the eastern branch of the Nile in the Delta. Its close proximity to Asia made it a popular town for Asiatic immigrants, most of whom were culturally Egyptianized, using Egyptian pottery, but also retained many aspects of their own culture, as can be seen from the various Asiatic burials including weapons of Levantine origin. One palatial district appears to have been abandoned as a result of an epidemic during the 13th dynasty. 

In the 18th century BC, the Hyksos conquered Lower Egypt and set up Avaris as their capital. Kamose, the last pharaoh of the Seventeenth Dynasty, besieged Avaris but was unable to defeat the Hyksos there. A few decades later, Ahmose I captured Avaris and overran the Hyksos. Canaanite-style artifacts dated to the Tuthmosid or New Kingdom period suggest that a large part of the city&#x27;s Semitic population remained in residence following its reconquest by the Egyptians. 

The pharaohs of the Eighteenth Dynasty set up a capital in Thebes and the palatial complex at Avaris was briefly abandoned, but areas such as the Temple of Seth and G6 region remained continuously occupied. It appears as well, that the site of Avaris had gone through a hiatus, dated after the time of Amenhotep II and until the late 18th dynasty. 

After Ramesses II constructed the city of Pi-Ramesses roughly to the north, Avaris was superseded by Pi-Ramesses, and thus finally abandoned during the Ramesside period. Large portions of the former site of Avaris were used by the inhabitants of Pi-Ramesses as a cemetery and burial ground, and part of it was used as a major navy base, while the &quot;Harbor of Avaris&quot; toponym continued to be used for Avaris&#x27; harbor through the Ramesside period. 

The name &quot;Avaris&quot; is also referred to in Papyrus Sallier I in the late 13th century BC. In addition, the &#x27;Avaris&#x27; toponym is also known to Manetho in the 3rd century BC, quoted by Josephus in his &quot;Against Apion&quot; 1.14.

==Urban chronology==
*Stratiagraphic layers M-N 
Amenemhet I (12th dynasty) planned a settlement, called &quot;Hutwaret&quot; located in the 19th Nome, circa 1930 BC. It was a small Egyptian town until about 1830 BC when it began to grow by immigration of Canaanites (Levant Middle Bronze Age IIA) By 1800 BC it was a much larger trade colony under Egyptian control. Over the next 100 years immigration increased the size of the city. Scarabs with the name &quot;Retjenu&quot; have been found in Avaris, also dating to the 12th Dynasty (1991-1802 BCE). 
*Stratiagraphic layers G
At about 1780 a temple to Set was built. The Canaanites living at Avaris considered the Egyptian god Set to be the Canaanite god Hadad. Both were weather gods.
*Stratiagraphic layers F
Around 1700 BC a temple district to the Canaanite Asherah and the Egyptian Hathor was built in the eastern part of the city. From 1700 onward, social stratification begins and an elite arise.
*Stratiagraphic layers E
In 1650 the Hyksos arrive and the city grows to 250 ha. It is believed that Avaris was the largest city in the world from 1670 to 1557 BC. A large citadel was built around 1550.

==Minoan connection==

Avaris, along with Tel Kabri in Israel and Alalakh in Syria, also has a record of Minoan civilization, which is otherwise quite rare in the Levant. Manfred Bietak, an Austrian archaeologist and the excavator of Tell Dab&#x27;a, has speculated that there was close contact with the rulers of Avaris, and that the large building featuring the frescoes allowed the Minoans to have a ritual life in Egypt. French archaeologist Yves Duhoux proposed the existence of a Minoan &#x27;colony&#x27; on an island in the Nile Delta.

<text>Scaliger is a prominent lunar impact crater in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon. It is attached to the northwest rim of the walled plain Milne, and the shared perimeter has reshaped the outer wall of Scaliger slightly, producing a straightened section along the southeast. To the west of Scaliger is the Lacus Solitudinis.

The outer wall of Scaliger is somewhat polygonal in shape, especially in the southern half. The rim has not been heavily eroded by subsequent impacts, in contrast to the heavily worn Milne to the southeast. The inner wall of Scaliger&#x27;s rim displays s, and a notable outer rampart overlaying the floor of Milne. The interior floor of Scaliger is relatively flat, with a rough surface near the inner wall. Near the midpoint is a central peak, offset slightly to the east.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Scaliger.

<doc id="1086667" wikidata="Q7902878" url="?curid=1086667" title="Utkal Congress">
<text>Utkal Congress was a political party in the Indian state of Odisha. It was formed in 1969 when Biju Patnaik left Indian National Congress. After the 1971 Odisha elections UC took part in the Bishwanath Das ministry in the state. In 1974 Utkal Congress merged into Pragati Legislature Party which eventually merged into Bharatiya Lok Dal.

== Background ==

Odisha was a stronghold of Congress in immediate post independence era. However factionalism was rife. A group of Congress dissidents led by Harekrushna Mahatab split in 1967 to form Jana Congress. In 1967 general election Most of the leadership of Congress lost. In 1969 Congress split at national level forming Congress(O) and Congress(R). Biju Patnaik remained with Congress(R) which was led by Smt Indira Gandhi. However, in 1970 Rajya sabha elections the state unit proposed a different candidate to that of the central leadership. However, in the election both candidates lost. This caused Biju Patnaik led group to sever all the ties from the central leadership. Initially named as Utkal Pradesh Congress, the group ultimately chose Utkal Congress as their name with Biju Patnaik, Rabi Ray along with securing support from two former Chief Ministers of Odisha - Harekrushna Mahtab, R.N.Singh Deo (Swatantra Party) &amp; the Samyukta Socialist Party whose state unit merged into the Utkal Congress in 1972 following the SSP&#x27;s dissolution.

== Electoral history ==

Biju Patnaik resigned from Congress(R) on 6 April 1970. Following that he along with his colleagues Nilamani Routray formed the state based party in the model of DMK. This fledgling party Fought its first election soon after in 1971 General elections. It secured 24% votes and 32 seats. It formed a coalition with Swatantra Party and formed a government under leadership Bishwanath Das. This government did not last for long and few of the Utkal Congress members wanted to go back to Congress(I) (Congress(R) had named itself Congress (I) at this point). So a Congress(I) government under the leadership of Nandini Satpathy formed. However this government did not last long either. There was an election in 1974 to Odisha legislature. Utkal Congress formed a coalition with Swatatantra party and a group of Congress (I) members led by Harekrushna Mahtab called Pragati Legislature party. In the election Utkal Congress slightly increased it tally to 35 seats. However Congress won the majority. At the end of 1974 all the constituents of Pragati Legislature party merged with Charan Singh led Bharatiya Lok Dal.

<doc id="1086668" wikidata="Q94980" url="?curid=1086668" title="Treia">
<text>Treia is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Macerata in the central Marche (Italy). It is north of Pollenza, west of Macerata, and north-northeast of Tolentino.

==Geography==
The site of the abandoned Roman municipium of Trea is situated in the middle valley of the River Potenza, some 30 km from the Adriatic shore. The town was located on a dominant plateau, 1 km north-west of present-day Treia, and just 3 km east of Monte Pitino, in an agrarian area around the church and convent of SS. Crocifisso.

==Remains==
The only remaining visible ruins are two small sections of the former city walls, partly incorporated in a now abandoned farm house. Since the 16th century many isolated finds as well as epigraphic monuments concerning Trea have been discovered in the general area. The first major excavations by Fortunato Benigni in the late 18th century determined the town’s approximate location and revealed parts of its walls, a basilica and a sanctuary with possible thermal building, located under the convent of SS. Crocifisso.

==History==
Treia is said to have been founded by the Sabine people in 380 BCE. Although the precise origin of the site remains unknown, its location on an elevated plateau near the Picene hilltop site of Monte Pitino could indicate that it was already a pre-Roman center. It became a Roman municipium shortly after 49 BC and it is possible that its circuit wall was erected around that time.

The Roman town flourished between the reigns of Augustus and Antoninus Pius, as indicated by the large collection of funerary monuments, statuary and epigraphic evidence.

Large Egyptian religious statues of the Roman period have been found and are kept in the town&#x27;s museum: they are unique in the Marche.

The later phases of Trea are less well documented and the last epigraphic evidence dates from the 4th century AD. However, according to some archaeological finds from early excavations and surveys, later habitation in Trea, at least until the 7th century AD, can be assumed.

It is imaginable that during the Early Middle Ages the remaining habitation was restructured in connection with a modest early Christian sanctuary for the plebs, here to be located at the site of SS. Crocifisso. Although this sanctuary is only found in documents from the mid-12th century onwards, many early medieval spolia used in the later church of SS. Crocifisso indicate the presence of a much earlier phase. Around AD 1000 the population probably moved towards the more easily defensible hill-site of Montecchio (later called Treia) and the original town site remained practically deserted.

The town sided with the Pope in the temporal struggles of central Italy, and was besieged several times, and in particular in 1239 by Enzio, son and vicar of Frederick II and again in 1263 by Conrad of Antioch, who was captured at the nearby battle of Vallesacco, and held for several months in town in a small prison (now in use as a caffé).

Montecchio eventually became part of the Papal States, and in 1790 Pope Pius VI rewarded it for its faithfulness by raising it to the official rank of &quot;city&quot;, at the same time renaming it by its Roman name of Treia.

Treia&#x27;s most famous native was the archaeologist and art critic Luigi Lanzi.

==Archaeology==
From 2000 onwards the Potenza Valley Survey Project, a project of Ghent University directed by Frank Vermeulen, attempts to map all buried structures of the ancient town. The survey methodology involves a series of aerial photography operations, large-scale geophysical prospections and intensive artefact surveys and studies. Due to all this new information it is now possible to map most parts of the town’s infrastructure in detail.
Roman &quot;Trea &quot;was situated along an important byroad of the via Flaminia, which connected Rome directly to the harbour city Ancona, via most of the Potenza Valley. Around this road a street-side settlement developed gradually into a real town during the Late Republic. The town wall delimiting the main urban area has an irregular oval shape, which agrees well with the general topographic configuration of the hilly plateau. The total enclosed area is only about 11 ha but possibly extramural habitation areas existed, particularly on the eastern and western sides. The street grid, individuating insulae of different size, is organized parallel with and perpendicular to a central decumanus maximus. Centrally the main road is interrupted by the monumental forum complex. The open rectangular square, is bordered by porticoes, tabernae and a series of public buildings. Centrally on the eastern side stood a rectangular building identified as the main podium temple. On and near the short west side of the forum stood a basilica, and possibly a curia. The planned forum was probably constructed in late Republican and early Imperial times. The remnants of another temple, discovered under the bell tower of the sanctuary of SS. Crocifisso and partly excavated by the University of Macerata in the 1980s, can be considered as an Egyptian sanctuary for Isis and Serapis. The discovery of a marble head of Serapis and a number of smaller Egyptian statuettes, as well as the second century AD inscription that mentions the temple of the “Domina” (the goddess Isis), can lead to the interpretation that this foreign cult was practiced here.

<text>The United Nations Service Medal Korea (UNSMK) is an international military decoration established by the United Nations on December 12, 1950 as the United Nations Service Medal. The decoration was the first international award ever created by the United Nations and recognized the multi-national defense forces which participated in the Korean War.

==Criteria==
The United Nations Service Medal (Korea) is awarded to any military service member, of an Armed Force allied with South Korea, who participated in the defense of South Korea from North Korea between June 27th 1950 and July 27th 1954 for a minimum of 30 days. The military forces of the Netherlands are awarded the medal for service to January 1, 1955, while the armed forces of Thailand and Sweden grant the award to July 27, 1955.

International Red Cross personnel engaged for service during the war with any United Nations relief team in Korea were &quot;not&quot; eligible for the medal.

The ultimate award authority of the United Nations Service Medal is United Nations Commander-in-Chief of military forces in Korea. Most countries consider the United Nations Service Medal an automatic decoration, if some other Korean service award was bestowed, and generally award the medal without requesting permission through United Nations channels. For instance, in the United States Armed Forces, any service member awarded the Korean Service Medal is automatically granted the United Nations Service Medal.

==Medal name==
On November 22, 1961, the United Nations officially changed the name of the United Nations Service Medal to the United Nations Service Medal Korea. This was as a prelude to the creation of many subsequent United Nations medals which are awarded for various operations around the world.

The United States and some other countries continue to refer to the medal as the &quot;United Nations Service Medal&quot; in an effort to maintain consistency with past military files referring to the medal by its original name.

==Description==
The UN Korea Medal is a 36mm wide circular medal of bronze alloy. The obverse depicts the &#x27;World-in-a Wreath&#x27; emblem of the United Nations. The reverse has the inscription: . Each participating country has the text in the most appropriate language, and the inscription may be in any one of the following languages: 
*Amharic, awarded to personnel from the Ethiopian Empire, 5.650 medals issued
*Dutch, 5.800 medals issued
*English, awarded to personnel from Australia, Canada (english-speaking), Denmark, New Zealand, Norway, Philippines, Sweden, United Kingdom, Union of South Africa and United States of America, 2.760.000 medals issued
*French, awarded to personnel from Belgium, Canada (french-speaking), France and Luxembourg, 16.900 medals awarded
*Greek, 9.000 medals issued
*Italian, 135 medals issued
*Korean, 1.225.000 medals issued
*Spanish, awarded to personnel from Colombia, 1.300 medals issued 
*Thai, 10.650 medals issued
*Turkish, 33.700 medals issued
*An unknown number of an unofficial copy with inscriptions in Tagalog were produced in the Philippines for local veterans. 
The medal hangs from a claw attachment on a straight bar suspension. Each medal is worn with a medal bar bearing the inscription &quot;KOREA&quot; in the same language as the reverse inscription. The medal&#x27;s ribbon made up of 17 equal stripes of United Nations blue (Bluebird 67117) and white, 9 blue and 8 white, each wide, with the exception of the Turkish medals that were usually worn with a dark red, single colour ribbon, as the standard pale blue and white were too similar to the Flag of Greece, considered as a rival country.

<doc id="1086673" wikidata="Q6236920" url="?curid=1086673" title="John H. Kinzie">
<text>John Harris Kinzie (July 7, 1803 – June 19, 1865) was a prominent figure in Chicago politics during the 19th century. He served as the president of the Board of Trustees of Chicago when it was still a town and thrice unsuccessfully ran for Chicago&#x27;s mayoralty once it was incorporated as a city. He also served as Cook County sheriff. After the Chicago&#x27;s incorporation as a city, he served as a member of the Chicago Common Council (city council).

==Early life==
Kinzie was born in Sandwich, Ontario, the eldest son of John Kinzie, one of Chicago&#x27;s first permanent settlers. Kinzie arrived in Chicago with his parents when he was one year old.

The Kinzie family moved to Detroit, Michigan following the Battle of Fort Dearborn, living there for several years. However, the family returned to Chicago in 1816.

==Life and career==
From 1818 until 1823, Kinzie worked for the American Fur Company. He spent some time working for the governor of the Michigan Territory in the 1820s and became an Indian subagent at Fort Winnebago until he returned to Chicago in 1833.

In 1831, Kinzie was appointed by governor as the inaugural Cook County Sheriff.

In 1833, Kinzie signed the 1833 Treaty of Chicago as a witness. It became a controversy how much the Kinzie family financially benefited from the terms treaty, given their connection to George Bryan Porter, who had been one of the treaty&#x27;s government-appointed negotiators.

On August 11, 1834, Kinzie became the second president of the Board of Trustees of the Town of Chicago.

On May 2, 1837 Kinzie ran against William Butler Ogden for mayor when Chicago became a city and lost. He subsequently made two more unsuccessful runs for mayor in 1845 and 1847.

In partnership with George W. Dole, Kinzie built the city&#x27;s first steamboat.

In 1857 Kinzie was voted president of the Chicago Board of Underwriters.

Kinzie served as U.S. Army paymaster for Michigan, Wisconsin and Illinois troops in the Civil War

==Death and legacy==

Kinzie died suddenly while on a railroad train on June 21, 1865.

John H. Kinzie Elementary School in Chicago, Illinois is named after him.

The house he and his wife resided in for a short period at the end of his time as an Indian sub-agent, now known as the Old Indian Agency House, in Portage, Wisconsin, has been listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Family==
Kinzie&#x27;s father was John Kinzie and his mother was Eleanor Lytle McKillip Kinzie.

Kinzie himself was married to historian and author Juliette Augusta Magill Kinzie. Together they had seven children. Three of their children died in either their infancy or youth, these being Alexander Wolcott (1833–1839), Julian Magill (born 1843, died at age six weeks), and Francis William (1844–1850, died of cholera). Four of their children survived into adulthood, these being Eleanor Lytle (1835–1917), John Harris Jr. (1838–1862), Capt. Arthur Magill (1841–1902), and George Herbert (1846–1890)

Kinzie&#x27;s daughter Eleanor Lytle married William Washington Gordon II (the son of Savannah, Georgia mayor William Washington Gordon) with whom she had six children (including Juliette Gordon Low, founder of the Girl Scouts of the USA).

One of Kinzie&#x27;s sons died fighting for the Union in the Civil War, two others were taken prisoner by Confederate forces but survived. His son-in-law William Washington Gordon II was an officer in the Confederate Army, fighting first under J.E.B. Stuart&#x27;s cavalry before becoming a captain in Mercer&#x27;s Brigade and eventually falling wounded during the Battle of Lovejoy&#x27;s Station.

<text>KlingStubbins was an architectural, engineering, interior, and planning firm headquartered in Philadelphia, with offices in Cambridge, Massachusetts; Raleigh, North Carolina; San Francisco; Washington, D.C.; and Beijing. In 1982, the Franklin Institute awarded Vincent G. Kling the Frank P. Brown Medal.

==Firm history==
KlingStubbins was formed through the merger of two offices in 2007. The first, The Kling-Lindquist Partnership, Inc., was founded by Vincent Kling (1916–2013) in 1946, and grew to become the largest firm in Philadelphia. One of the most recognizable buildings designed by Kling is the Bell Atlantic Tower, which was completed in 1991 and remains among the tallest buildings in Philadelphia. Kling also collaborated with Philadelphia city planner Edmund Bacon.

The Stubbins Associates was founded by Hugh Stubbins, FAIA, in 1949 and based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Hugh Stubbins had designed several of the world&#x27;s most noted skyscrapers, including the Citicorp Center in New York City, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston headquarters in Boston, and the Yokohama Landmark Tower, the tallest building in Japan. Kling became affiliated with The Stubbins Associates in 2003, and the two officially merged on January 1, 2007. The company grew to include engineering, interior design, landscape architecture, and several branch offices in other cities.

Michael Paul Smith, later founder of the popular Elgin Park miniature imaginary village, worked for the company as model maker in the 1970s.

In 2011, KlingStubbins was acquired by Jacobs Engineering Group and operates as part of their Global Buildings sector.

==Publications==
Both The Stubbins Associates and Kling-Lindquist have published several architectural monographs. Their first combined volume, &quot;KlingStubbins: Palimpsest&quot;, was published in 2009 by Images Publishing. Drawing on several years of in-house research on laboratory design, KlingStubbins published a design reference book, &quot;Sustainable Design of Research Laboratories: Planning, Design, and Operation&quot;, through Wiley in 2010, which examines inter-disciplinary design strategies for sustainable design and energy efficiency in the design and operation of research laboratories.

==Project delivery innovation==
With their Autodesk Headquarters in Waltham, MA, KlingStubbins became the first architectural firm in New England to employ an Integrated Project Delivery (IPD) model. As opposed to traditional project delivery methods in which a project owner employs an architect/engineering team for design services and a contractor team for building services on separate contracts, IPD requires the owner, architect, and builder to sign a shared contract, expediting the design/building process and sharing both liability and profits among the three parties. The project garnered international recognition for the design but also for the novelty of its project structure, which resulted in a significantly faster project schedule, no legal disputes among the various parties, and no change orders on the construction site.

==Honors and awards==
* Autodesk AEC Headquarters, Waltham, MA, USA, 2008
* Kling elected into the National Academy of Design, 1964

<doc id="1086677" wikidata="Q3809832" url="?curid=1086677" title="Joliot (crater)">
<text>Joliot is a large lunar impact crater that lies on the far side of the Moon, just past the eastern limb. At this location it lies in a region of the surface that comes into sight during a favorable libration, although at such times it is viewed from the side. Thus viewing this crater in detail must be done from orbit.

The crater lies at the northern fringes of the lava-flooded region of the surface associated with Mare Marginis to the south. The crater Lomonosov is located just to the east-northeast, and Lyapunov is attached to the western rim. Also attached to the northwest rim, and thus adjacent to Lyapunov, is the crater Rayleigh. Southwest of Joliet is Hubble and farther to the south lies Al-Biruni.

The outer rim of Joliet is worn and somewhat disintegrated, particularly in the northern and southern sections where the outer wall consists of little more than irregular ridges and craterlets. The rim is somewhat more intact to the east, and particularly so in the west where it has been buttressed by adjacent crater formations.

Within the outer rim, the interior floor has been flooded in the past by basaltic lava, leaving a relatively flattened surface that has a lower albedo than the surrounding terrain and so appears darker. Parts of the floor have been coated in ray material from the fresh crater Giordano Bruno to the northeast.

The lava-covered floor contains several ghost-crater remnants, with the largest being an elongated formation to the west of the midpoint. At the midpoint of the floor is a central peak formation.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Joliot.

<doc id="1086681" wikidata="Q8655" url="?curid=1086681" title="Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür">
<text>Jayaatu Khan (Mongolian: Заяат хаан ; &quot;Jayaγatu qaγan&quot;; ), born Tugh Temür (Mongolian: Төвтөмөр ; ), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Wenzong of Yuan (; 16 February 1304 – 2 September 1332), was an emperor of the Yuan dynasty of China. Apart from Emperor of China, he is regarded as the 12th Khagan of the Mongol Empire, although it was only nominal due to the division of the empire.

He first ruled from 16 October 1328 to 26 February 1329 before abdicating in favour of his brother Kusala (Emperor Mingzong), and again ruled from 8 September 1329 to 2 September 1332 after Kusala&#x27;s death.

Thanks to his father&#x27;s loyal partisans, Tugh Temür did restore the line of Khayishan (Emperor Wuzong) to the throne but persecuted his eldest brother Kusala&#x27;s family, and later expressed remorse for what he had done to him. His name means &quot;Blessed/lucky Khan&quot;.

Tugh Temür sponsored many cultural activities, wrote poetry, painted, and read Chinese classical texts. Examples of his quite competent poetry and calligraphy have survived. He mandated and closely monitored the compilation called &quot;The Imperial Dynasty&#x27;s grand institutions for managing the world&quot;; through this textual production, he proclaimed his reign as new beginning, which took stock of the administrative practices and rules of the past and looked forward to a fresh chapter in Yuan dynastic governance. But his reign was brief, and his administration was in the hands of powerful ministers, such as El Temür of the Qipchaq and Bayan of the Merkid who had helped him to win the succession struggle in 1328.

==Early life==
He was the second son of Khayishan (Külüg Khan or Emperor Wuzong) and a Tangut woman, and a younger brother of Kuśala. When his father Khayishan suddenly died and his younger brother Ayurbarwada inherited the Yuan throne in 1311, he and his brother were removed from the central government by his grandmother Dagi and other Khunggirad faction members including Temüder since they were not mothered by Khunggirad khatuns. After Ayurbarwada&#x27;s son Shidibala ascended the throne in 1320, Tugh Temür was banished to Hainan. When Shidibala was assassinated and Yesün Temür took over as the new ruler, conditions improved for Tugh Temür. He was given the title of Prince of Huai () and relocated to Jiankang (modern-day Nanjing) and then to Jiangling. By this time he already showed a wide range of scholarly and artistic interests and had surrounded himself with many distinguished Chinese literati and artists. As the persecuted sons of Khayishan Külüg Khan, Tugh Temür and Kusala still enjoyed a measure of sympathy among the Borjigin princes and, more importantly, the lingering loyalty of some of their father&#x27;s followers who had survived various political purges.

==Civil war==

The death of Yesün Temür Khan in Shangdu in 1328 gave Khayishan&#x27;s line an opportunity to surface. But it was mainly due to El Temür&#x27;s political ingenuity, whose Qipchaq family reached its zenith under Khayishan. He activated a conspiracy in the capital Khanbaliq (Dadu, modern Beijing) to overthrow the court at Shangdu. He and his entourages enjoyed enormous geographical and economic advantages over the loyalists of Yesun Temur. Tugh Temür was recalled to Khanbaliq by El Temür since his more influential brother Kuśala stayed in far-away Central Asia. He was installed as the new ruler in Khanbaliq in September while Yesün Temür&#x27;s son Ragibagh succeeded to the throne in Shangdu with the support from Yesün Temür&#x27;s favourite retainer Dawlat Shah.

Ragibagh&#x27;s forces broke through the Great Wall at several points, and penetrated as far as the outskirts of Khanbaliq. El Temür, however, was able to turn the tide quickly in his favour. The restorationists from Manchuria (Liaodong) and eastern Mongolia launched a surprise attack on the loyalists. Their army under the command of Bukha Temur and Orlug Temur, descendants of Genghis Khan&#x27;s brothers, surrounded Shangdu on 14 November, at a time most of the loyalists were involved on the Great Wall front. The loyalists in Shangdu surrendered on the very next day, and Dawlat Shah and most of the leading loyalists were taken prisoner and later executed. Ragibagh was reported to be missing. With the surrender of Shangdu, the way to restoring Khayishan&#x27;s imperial line was cleared, although the loyalists elsewhere continued the fighting until 1332.

==Regicide and purge==
At the same time, however, his elder brother Khutughtu Khan Kusala gathered support from princes and generals in Mongolia and Chagatai Khanate and entered Karakorum with the overwhelming military presence. Realizing disadvantages, Tugh Temür declared abdication and summoned his brother. Accompanied by the Chagatai ruler Eljigidey, Kusala in response enthroned himself on 27 February 1329 north of Karakorum. El Temür brought the imperial seal to Kuśala in Mongolia and announced Dadu&#x27;s intent to welcome him, and Tugh Temür was made heir apparent. According to an oral tradition, Kuśala&#x27;s retainers treated him discourteously when he came to the camp of Kuśala, thus making him both fearful and angry. Kuśala thanked El Temür and appointed him grand councillor of the right wing of the Secretariat with the title &quot;darqan taishi&quot;. Kuśala had appointed his loyal followers to essential posts in the Secretariat, the Bureau of Military Affairs, and the Censorate.

On his way to Dadu, on 26 August, Kuśala met with Tugh Temür in Ongghuchad near Shangdu. Only four days after a banquet with Tugh Temür, he suddenly died or was killed with poison by El Temür, who feared losing power to princes and officers of the Chagatai Khanate and Mongolia who followed Kuśala. Tugh Temür was restored to the throne on 8 September 1329. His conspiracy and victory over the loyalists and the death of Kusala eliminated the power of the steppe candidates from Mongolia.

Tugh Temür&#x27;s administration carried out a bloody purge against its enemies. Not only were leading supporters of Yesün Temür&#x27;s successor Raghibagh executed and exiled, but their properties were confiscated. Tugh Temür denied the posthumous names of Yesün Temür and Raghibagh and destroyed the chamber in the imperial shrine that contained the tablet of Yesün Temür&#x27;s father Gammala. El Temür purged pro-Kuśala officers and brought power to warlords.

==Reign==

===Efforts to win recognition===

Because Tugh Temür&#x27;s accession was so transparently illegitimate, it was more important for his regime than for any previous reign to rely on liberal enfeoffments and generous awards to rally support from the nobility and officialdom. During his four-year reign, twenty-four princely titles were handed out, nine of which were of the first rank. Of these nine first-rank princes, seven were not even Kublai Khan&#x27;s descendants. Not only were the imperial grants restored in 1329, but all the properties confiscated from the Shangdu loyalists also were given to princes and officials who had made contributions to the restoration; in all, 125 individual properties are estimated to have changed hands.

Action was also taken to win recognition from the other Mongol khanates to be accepted as their nominal suzerain. Tugh Temür sent three princes with lavish gifts to the Golden Horde, the Chagatai Khanate and the Ilkhanate. And he also sent Muqali&#x27;s descendant Naimantai to Eljigidey, who strongly supported Kusala, to give the royal seal and gifts in order to mollify his anger. However, Tugh Temür made regarding success, and saw favourable responses. Thus Tugh Temür was able to re-establish suzerainty over the Mongol world for himself and to maintain a close relationship with the three western khanates.

=== Administration and court life ===

The four-year reign of Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür was dominated by El Temur and Bayan of the Merkid. As the persons who had been chiefly responsible for making the restoration possible, they acquired a measure of power and honour that had never before been attained by any official in the Yuan. They built their own power bases in the bureaucracy and the military, and their role overshadowed Tugh Temür. Tugh Temür honoured his father&#x27;s former ministers and gave them honorific titles, and restored the honours of Sanpo and Toghto who had been persecuted by Ayurbarwada. The participants in the restoration were given most of the positions of importance in his administration. A few of the Muslims held posts in provinces, however, they did not have any position in the central government.

In the latter part of 1330 the Emperor went in person to perform the great sacrifice to the sky, which was done by deputy. This was followed by a general amnesty, and by the proclamation of his young son Aratnadara as heir apparent in January 1331. Tugh Temür&#x27;s consort Budashiri, having a grudge against Babusha, the widow of Kusala, had her assassinated by a eunuch. Then she sent Kusala&#x27;s son Toghon Temür in exile to Korea to secure her son&#x27;s succession; but Aratnadara died one month after his designation as heir. This sudden death of his son completely upset Tugh Temür&#x27;s plan for succession. Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür caused his another son, Gunadara (Kulatana), to live with El Temur and recognize him as his father, and changed his name to El Tegus.

Because a budget deficit of the government drastically increased, and reached 2.3 million ding of paper currency in 1330 alone, Tugh Temür&#x27;s court attempted to curtail its spending on such items as imperial grants, Buddhist sacrifices, and palace expenses. With those measures, they could keep the budget deficit within manageable figure, and had sufficient grain reserves at its disposal.

=== Prince Tugel Rebellion ===
The added costs of the war against the loyalists and the suppression of the revolts by the ethnic minorities, and natural disasters heavily taxed resources of Tugh Temür&#x27;s government. The war in Yunnan continued with doubtful success, but the Imperial general Aratnashiri having collected an army of 100,000 men, defeated the Lolos and other mountaineers, and killed two of their chiefs. He seems to have quelled the rebellion and pacified Yunnan and Sichuan. Lo yu, one of the rebel chiefs in Yunnan, had escaped to the mountains; he collected a body of his people, and, dividing them into sixty small parties, overran the country of Chunyuen, where they committed frightful devastation. A force marched against them and Tugh Temür&#x27;s army stormed their chief stronghold. Three sons and two brothers of Prince Tugel were made prisoners, while a third brother drowned himself rather than fall into the hands of the imperial army. Tugel&#x27;s partisans gave up their cause in March 1332. This campaigns costed 630,000 ding of paper currency. Tugh Temür, who preferred luxury life, hardly deigned to show any interest in this distant campaign. The conduct of the Emperor caused much discontent, and Yelu Timur, son of Ananda who attempted to take the throne in 1307, in conjunction with the heads of the Lama religion in China, formed a plot to displace him; but this was discovered, and they were duly punished.

=== Academy, arts and learning ===

Tugh Temür had a good knowledge of the Chinese language and history and was also a creditable poet, calligrapher, and painter. With his actual power greatly circumscribed by El Temür, Tugh Temür is known for his cultural contribution. Posing as a cultivated sovereign of the Yuan, Tugh Temür adopted many measures honouring Confucianism and promoting Chinese cultural values. In 1330, he awarded laudatory titles to several past Confucian sages and masters, and himself performed the suburban offerings () to Heaven, and thus became the first Yuan emperor to perform in person this important traditional Chinese state observance. To promote Confucian morality, the court each year honoured many men and women who were known for their filial piety and chastity.

To prevent the Chinese from following Mongolian and hence un-Confucian customs, the government decreed in 1330 that men who took their widowed stepmothers or sister-in-law as wives, in violation of their own community&#x27;s customs, would be punished. In the meantime, to encourage the Mongols and the Muslims to follow the Chinese customs, the officials of these two ethnic groups were allowed in 1329 to observe the Chinese custom of three years of mourning for deceased parents. He supported Zhu Xi&#x27;s Neo-Confucianism and also devoted himself in Buddhism. He supervised the construction of the Stupa of Master Zhaozhou in the Buddhist Bailin Temple.

His most concrete effort to patronize Chinese learning was his founding of the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature (), first established in the spring of 1329, and was designed to undertake &quot;a number of tasks relating to the transmission of Confucian high culture to the Mongolian imperial establishment&quot;. These tasks included the elucidation of the Confucian classics and Chinese history to the emperor; the education of the scions of high-ranking notables and the younger members of the &quot;kesig&quot;; the collection, collation, and compilation of books; and the appraisal and classifications of the paintings and calligraphic works in the imperial collection. Of the 113 officials successively serving in the academy, there were many distinguished Chinese literati, and the best Mongolian and Muslim scholars of Chinese learning of the time. Concentrating so many talents in one governmental organ to perform various literary, artistic, and educational activities was unprecedented not only in the Yuan dynasty but also in Chinese history.

The academy was responsible for compiling and publishing a number of books. But its most important achievement was its compilation of a vast institutional compendium named &quot;Jingshi Dadian&quot; (, &quot;Grand canon for governing the world&quot;). The purpose of bringing together and systematizing all important Yuan official documents and laws in this work according to the pattern of &quot;Huiyao&quot; (, &quot;Comprehensive essentials of institutions&quot;) of the Tang and Song dynasties was apparently to demonstrate that Yuan rule was as perfect as that of earlier Chinese dynasties. Started in May 1330, this ambitious project was completed in thirteen months. It later provided the basis for the various treatises of the Yuanshi (History of Yuan), which was compiled at the beginning of the Ming dynasty.

===Later life===
Due to the fact that the bureaucracy was dominated by El Temür, whose despotic rule clearly marked the decline of the empire, the actual impact of the Academy of the Pavilion of the Star of Literature on the government as a whole was limited. El Temür eventually seized control of the academy in early 1332, just six months before the death of Tugh Temür. The academy had come to an end after Tugh Temür&#x27;s death. Although El Tegüs was still alive, on his deathbed Tugh Temür expressed remorse for what he had done to his elder brother, Kusala, and his intention to pass the throne to Toghon Temür. After Jayaatu Khan Tugh Temür died on 2 September 1332, Kuśala&#x27;s second son Rinchinbal was installed by El Temür only at the age of six because Toghon Temür was far away from the central government.

<text>Milne is a large lunar crater that is located in the southern hemisphere on the far side of the Moon, named after the British mathematician and astrophysicist Edward Arthur Milne. It lies to the northeast of the Mare Australe, and southeast of Lacus Solitudinis.

The formation has been heavily eroded and reshaped by a long history of impacts, leaving a low, irregular ridge line around most of the perimeter. The southern portion of the wall has been obliterated by impacts, and this area is now overlain by the craters Milne M and Milne N. Milne N has a ray system and is mapped as part of the Copernican System.

Although the interior floor is relatively flat, it has been marred by many impacts in the surface. The most prominent of these is the satellite crater Milne K, which is located just to the south of the midpoint. Overlapping the southern rim of K is the smaller Milne L. In the northeast part of the floor is an unusual tight formation of 10–12 small impacts that almost resembles a cluster of grapes.

The crater floor is somewhat irregular in the northwestern part, where the prominent crater Scaliger intrudes into the outer rim, leaving ejecta across the floor. Other nearby craters include Alden to the north, Parkhurst to the west, Schaeberle to the northeast, and Bjerknes to the south. Farther to the northeast is the walled plain Fermi and the impressive Tsiolkovskiy.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Milne.

Milne N is characterised by an extremely high rockfall density by lunar standards, and Milne L by a very high rockfall density.

He came into public prominence in 1993 when he published a book entitled &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot; containing an account of a military mission which he led with the Special Air Service (SAS) during the Gulf War, for which he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal. He had previously been awarded the Military Medal in 1979 for gallantry in action whilst serving with the Royal Green Jackets in Northern Ireland.

He has published a number of other novels and two autobiographies in addition to &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot;. He has also published a book on psychopathy entitled &quot;The Good Psychopath&#x27;s Guide to Success&quot;, claiming that he exhibits many psychopathic traits.

==Early life==
McNab was born on 28 December 1959. He did not do well in school, and eventually attended nine schools in seven years. After dropping out of school McNab worked at various odd jobs, usually for friends and relatives, and was involved in petty criminality, finally being arrested for burglary in 1976. Partly inspired by his brother&#x27;s time in the army, he wanted to join the British Army. He failed the entry test for training as an army pilot, but enlisted with the Royal Green Jackets at the age of sixteen after being released from juvenile detention.

When McNab joined the army he was found to have the reading age of an eleven-year-old. Shortly before his seventeenth birthday he read his first book, entitled &quot;Janet and John&quot;. Speaking in 2019, McNab recalled how &quot;I can vividly remember the sense of pride and achievement I felt. It was meant for primary school children but I didn’t care ... From then on I read anything and everything I could get my hands on.&quot;

==Military career==
He was posted to Kent for his basic training, and boxed for his regimental team. After basic training, he was posted to the Rifle Depot in Winchester. In 1977 he spent time in Gibraltar as part of his first operational posting, while with 2nd Battalion, Royal Green Jackets.

From December 1977 to June 1978, he was posted to South Armagh, Northern Ireland, as part of the British Army&#x27;s Operation Banner. In 1978 and 1979, he returned to Armagh as a newly promoted Lance Corporal, and claimed to have killed for the first time during a firefight with the Provisional Irish Republican Army. McNab wrote of the incident: &quot;I remember vividly the first time I had to kill someone to stay alive. I was a 19-year-old soldier in Keady, South Armagh, and my patrol stumbled across six IRA soldiers, preparing for an ambush. When the shooting started, they were just 20 metres away from my patrol. I was scared, very scared.&quot; He was awarded the Military Medal for this incident. However, security sources later reported that the person McNab shot was only wounded and died as a result of injuries from a separate shootout later that day.

In 1982, after six years&#x27; service with the Royal Green Jackets (RGJ), and having been promoted to the rank of sergeant, he applied for transfer into the Special Air Service Regiment, which was approved by the RGJ. After failing his first attempt at United Kingdom Special Forces Selection, he passed in 1984, and was attached to the SAS, with which he remained for the rest of his career in the British Army. During his 10 years with &quot;Air Troop&quot;, B Squadron, 22 SAS Regiment, he served with Al Slater, Frank Collins and Charles &quot;Nish&quot; Bruce. Writing in &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; in November 2008, McNab describes Bruce as &quot;one of my heroes.&quot;

McNab worked on both covert and overt operations including counter terrorism and drug operations in the Middle East and Far East, South and Central America and Northern Ireland. McNab trained as a specialist in counter terrorism, prime target elimination, demolitions, weapons, tactics, covert surveillance roles and information gathering in hostile environments, and VIP protection. He worked on cooperative operations with police forces, prison services, anti-drug forces and Western-backed guerrilla movements as well as on conventional special operations. In Northern Ireland, he spent two years working as an undercover operator with 14 Intelligence Company, going on to become an instructor.

During the Gulf War, McNab commanded an eight-man SAS patrol, designated &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot;, that was given the task of destroying underground communication links between Baghdad and north-west Iraq and with tracking Scud missile movements in the region. The patrol was dropped into Iraq on 22 January 1991, but was soon compromised, following which it attempted an escape on foot towards Syria, the closest coalition country.

Three of the eight were killed, and four captured (including McNab) after three days on the run; one member, Chris Ryan, escaped. The captured men were held for six weeks before being released on 5 March. By that time, McNab was suffering from nerve damage to both hands, a dislocated shoulder, kidney and liver damage, and hepatitis B. After six months of medical treatment he was back on active service.

Awarded both the Distinguished Conduct Medal and Military Medal during his military career, McNab claims to have been the British Army&#x27;s most highly decorated serving soldier when he left the SAS in February 1993.

==Post-military career==
McNab assumed his pseudonym while writing &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot;. When he appeared on television to promote his books or to act as a special services expert, his face was shadowed to prevent identification. According to the book &quot;The Big Breach&quot;, by Richard Tomlinson, a renegade MI6 spy, McNab was part of a special training team after the Iraq War, training MI6 recruits in sabotage and guerrilla warfare techniques.

Due to the extremely sensitive nature of his work while serving with the SAS, McNab is bound by contract to submit his writings to the Ministry of Defence for review.

After leaving the Army, McNab developed and maintained a specialist training course for news crews, journalists and members of non-governmental organisations working in hostile environments. He spent time in Hollywood as a technical weapons adviser and trainer on Michael Mann&#x27;s film &quot;Heat&quot;. He was also the technical adviser on the 2005 crime film &quot;Dirty&quot;.

In February 2007, McNab returned to Iraq for seven days as &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper&#x27;s security adviser with 2nd Battalion, The Rifles.

McNab has written about his experiences in the SAS in three best-selling books, &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot; (1993), &quot;Immediate Action&quot; (1995), and &quot;Seven Troop&quot; (2008). &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot; sold over 1.7 million copies, with &quot;Immediate Action&quot; selling 1.4 million in the UK. It has been published in 17 countries and translated into 16 languages. The CD spoken word version of &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot;, narrated by McNab, sold over 60,000 copies and earned a silver disc. A BBC film of &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot;, starring Sean Bean, was shown on prime time BBC One television in 1999 and released on DVD in 2000. &quot;Immediate Action&quot;, McNab&#x27;s autobiography, spent 18 weeks at the top of the best-seller lists following the lifting of an &quot;ex-parte&quot; injunction granted to the Ministry of Defence in September 1995.

The veracity of McNab&#x27;s first book, &quot;Bravo Two Zero&quot;, has been questioned by Michael Asher, an explorer, Arabist and former SAS reservist, who visited Iraq with a Channel 4 film crew, and interviewed many eyewitnesses. Asher concluded that much of what McNab wrote was a fabrication, and that there was no evidence that the Bravo Two Zero patrol accounted for a single enemy casualty. Moreover, McNab&#x27;s account and that of his comrade Chris Ryan are contradictory on many points. This has been corroborated by Peter Ratcliffe, who was regimental sergeant major of 22 SAS Regiment during the Gulf War, who stated that, in a debriefing to the entire Regiment, recorded on video, none of the patrol members mentioned contacts with large numbers of enemies or any of the other extraordinary incidents included in the books. Asher&#x27;s conclusion was that the book&#x27;s claim to be &quot;the true story of an SAS patrol in action&quot; was a fraud.

McNab now lives in New York City with his fifth wife. He is a director of military service recruitment, mentoring and Foundation organisation, ForceSelect.

In August 2014, McNab was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

In the 2017 Birthday Honours, McNab was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) for services to literacy and charity. The award recognised his charity work with The Reading Agency promoting literacy, particularly in young adults and prisoners. The award was gazetted under the name &quot;Andrew McNab&quot;.

==Fiction writing==
McNab is the author of a number of action thrillers written with the help of a ghostwriter.

The Nick Stone Missions are a successful series based on an ex-SAS soldier working on deniable operations for British intelligence. The series draws extensively on McNab&#x27;s experiences and knowledge of Special Forces soldiering. The Boy Soldier Series was written with the co-operation of Robert Rigby and follows a boy named Danny Watts and his grandfather Fergus, apparently a rogue ex-SAS soldier.

McNab has also written books for Quick Reads, a charity that supports World Book day. BBC raw words offers exclusive audio versions of the latest Quick Reads by Andy McNab, &quot;Last Night Another Soldier&quot; (2010), read by Rupert Degas. Other fiction books include Audio Stories, Men at War series, Battlefield 3, Tom Buckingham series, and two young adult series: Dropzone Stories and The New Recruit series.

McNab worked with DICE serving as the game&#x27;s consultant on military tactics for &quot;Battlefield 3&quot;. He penned a tie-in novel called &quot;Battlefield 3: The Russian&quot;, which follows the story of a Spetsnaz GRU commando Dmitri &quot;Dima&quot; Mayakovsky and his involvement against the PLR (People&#x27;s Liberation &amp; Resistance), an Iranian paramilitary insurgent group, as well as his connection to the antagonist. The novel was released on 25 October 2011.

===Film work===
After his work on the Miramax film &quot;Heat&quot;, Miramax acquired the film rights to the first four of McNab&#x27;s novels, and as of 2011 &quot;Echelon&quot; was in production, based on the book &quot;Firewall&quot; (2000). McNab is to co-produce and co-write the script and also act as technical adviser. In 2014, Luke Evans was cast as Tom Buckingham in &quot;Red Notice&quot; with Nick Love as director. McNab is to consult as technical adviser and have a role in production as well. This did not end up happening.

==Other work==
McNab took part in E4&#x27;s &quot;Big Brother: Celebrity Hijack&quot; on 13 January 2008.

The Mobcast e-book platform he co-founded with Tony Lynch was sold to Tesco for £4.5 million; McNab&#x27;s share was £1 million.

<text>Goddard is a lunar impact crater that is located along the eastern limb of the Moon, and so is visible from the edge from Earth. It is best viewed during favorable librations when the orientation of the Moon brings it further into sight. The crater is located in the Mare Marginis, to the northeast of the prominent crater Neper. Ibn Yunus, a crater remnant, is attached to the southeastern rim and is partly overlaid by Goddard. To the northeast is Al-Biruni.

The rim of Goddard has nearly been destroyed along the southern edge, and the interior floor is connected to the surrounding mare through gaps in this section of the wall. The remainder of the rim is significantly eroded and worn, leaving only a ring of rugged ground surrounding the inner floor.

The floor of the crater has been resurfaced in the past by lava floods, leaving the interior nearly flat and featureless. There is no central peak, and only a few tiny craterlets mark the surface. The most prominent of these is a matched pair of small craterlets in the south-southwest part of the floor.

This feature is named after the pioneering rocket scientist Robert H. Goddard.

==Satellite craters==
By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Goddard.

<text>Weimar is the oldest part of the municipality of Ahnatal. It is a village situated close to the Dörnberg some 15 km northwest of Kassel and has about 3500 inhabitants. Being close to the city of Kassel, most people who live in Weimar are commuters who work in the city of Kassel. There are no large-scale firms in Weimar and in Ahnatal in general. Its main sight is the &quot;Bühl&quot;, a former pit which was left open after a source leaked into it. It is now being used as a swimming pool, and in the nearby area, there are sports and recreational facilities. The education system consists of a primary school (Helfensteinschule) which pupils can attend until they reach the sixth grade after which they have to go to a secondary school. The &quot;Helfensteinschule&quot; is attended also by pupils from Kammerberg.

== History ==
Its history dates back to 1097 when it was first mentioned in a donation record of a monastery. In Weimar, the name of which is supposed to mean &quot;sacred water&quot;, there was a monastery which is at the place of the Lutheran church. Weimar&#x27;s population was mainly dominated by workers in factories in the nearby city of Kassel and also in the quarry which now forms the Bühl. Although there was an anti-aircraft base during World War II close to the village, it was not heavily damaged in the bomb raids. After World War II Weimar was occupied by American soldiers. In the 1970s, it was merged with Heckershausen to form the municipality of Ahnatal.

<text>Fred Fish (November 4, 1952 – April 20, 2007) was a computer programmer notable for work on the GNU Debugger and his series of freeware disks for the Amiga.

Fish worked for Cygnus Solutions in the 1990s before leaving for Be Inc. in 1998.

In 1978, he self-published &quot;User Survival Guide for TI-58/59 Master Library&quot;. It was advertised in enthusiast newsletters covering the TI-59 programmable calculator. Fish also initiated the &quot;GeekGadgets&quot; project, a GNU standard environment for AmigaOS and BeOS.

==Personal life==

Fred Fish was married to Michelle Fish (née Norman) at the time of his death. He died of a heart attack at his home in Idaho on Friday, April 20, 2007.

== The Amiga Library Disks ==
The &quot;Amiga Library Disks&quot; – colloquially referred to as &quot;Fish Disks&quot; (a term coined by Perry Kivolowitz at a Jersey Amiga User Group meeting) – had a reach that included most all Amiga users in the world. Fish would distribute his disks around the world in time for regional and local user group meetings, which in turn duplicated them for local distribution. Typically, only the cost of materials changed hands. The Fish Disk series ran from 1986 to 1994. In it, one can chart the growing sophistication of Amiga software and see the emergence of many software trends.

The Fish Disks were distributed at computer stores and Amiga enthusiast clubs. Contributors submitted applications and source code and the best of these each month were assembled and released as a diskette. Since the Internet was not yet in popular usage outside military and university circles, this was a primary way for enthusiasts to share work and ideas.

<doc id="1086711" wikidata="Q3009653" url="?curid=1086711" title="GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable">
<text>The GameCube Game Boy Advance cable (DOL-011) is a video game accessory manufactured by Nintendo which is used to connect the Game Boy Advance (GBA) handheld console to the GameCube (GCN) home console. Depending on the games it is used with, the cable may facilitate transferring data between related games, unlocking additional content, or turning the GBA into a controller or second screen.

==Development==
The concept of a cable that allowed for the transfer of data and second-screen gameplay was originally conceived for the Nintendo 64 as the &quot;64 GB Cable&quot;, a device designed by Marigul Management which would allow certain Nintendo 64DD games to connect to compatible Game Boy Color cartridges. However, the device was never released—interactivity between Nintendo 64 and Game Boy games was limited to those that supported the Transfer Pak, released in 1998.

==Compatibility==
===Systems===
The cable has one end that plugs into a GameCube controller slot and another end that plugs into the GBA&#x27;s extension port. The cable is compatible with the GameCube and the Wii on the console side; and the Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, Game Boy Player, and e-Reader on the portable side. When used with the Game Boy Player accessory, the Game Boy Advance system can be used to control any Game Boy game played through the GameCube.

Because the Game Boy Micro has a differently-shaped link port, the official cable does not work with it, but enthusiasts have been able to hack together homemade versions which does. It is also incompatible with the Nintendo DS family, as the original Nintendo DS and DS Lite&#x27;s backwards compatibility for the Game Boy Advance does not extend to its accessories, lacking the necessary extension port.

===Games===
The following is a list of compatible GameCube games, with the corresponding Game Boy Advance (GBA) game or &quot;N/A&quot; if no GBA game is required.

<doc id="1086718" wikidata="Q24786260" url="?curid=1086718" title="Helix-turn-helix">
<text>Helix-turn-helix is a DNA-binding domain (DBD). The helix-turn-helix (HTH) is a major structural motif capable of binding DNA. Each monomer incorporates two α helices, joined by a short strand of amino acids, that bind to the major groove of DNA. The HTH motif occurs in many proteins that regulate gene expression. It should not be confused with the helix–loop–helix motif.

==Discovery==
The discovery of the helix-turn-helix motif was based on similarities between several genes encoding transcription regulatory proteins from bacteriophage lambda and &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;: Cro, CAP, and λ repressor, which were found to share a common 20–25 amino acid sequence that facilitates DNA recognition.

==Function==
The helix-turn-helix motif is a DNA-binding motif. The recognition and binding to DNA by helix-turn-helix proteins is done by the two α helices, one occupying the N-terminal end of the motif, the other at the C-terminus. In most cases, such as in the Cro repressor, the second helix contributes most to DNA recognition, and hence it is often called the &quot;recognition helix&quot;. It binds to the major groove of DNA through a series of hydrogen bonds and various Van der Waals interactions with exposed bases. The other α helix stabilizes the interaction between protein and DNA, but does not play a particularly strong role in its recognition. The recognition helix and its preceding helix always have the same relative orientation.

==Classification of helix-turn-helix motifs==
Several attempts have been made to classify the helix-turn-helix motifs based on their structure and the spatial arrangement of their helices. Some of the main types are described below.

===Di-helical===
The di-helical helix-turn-helix motif is the simplest helix-turn-helix motif. A fragment of Engrailed homeodomain encompassing only the two helices and the turn was found to be an ultrafast independently folding protein domain.

===Tri-helical===
An example of this motif is found in the transcriptional activator Myb.

===Tetra-helical===
The tetra-helical helix-turn-helix motif has an additional C-terminal helix compared to the tri-helical motifs. These include the LuxR-type DNA-binding HTH domain found in bacterial transcription factors and the helix-turn-helix motif found in the TetR repressors. Multihelical versions with additional helices also occur.

===Winged helix-turn-helix===
The winged helix-turn-helix (wHTH) motif is formed by a 3-helical bundle and a 3- or 4-strand beta-sheet (wing). The topology of helices and strands in the wHTH motifs may vary. In the transcription factor ETS wHTH folds into a helix-turn-helix motif on a four-stranded anti-parallel beta-sheet scaffold arranged in the order α1-β1-β2-α2-α3-β3-β4 where the third helix is the DNA recognition helix.

===Other modified helix-turn-helix motifs===
Other derivatives of the helix-turn-helix motif include the DNA-binding domain found in MarR, a regulator of multiple antibiotic resistance, which forms a winged helix-turn-helix with an additional C-terminal alpha helix.
