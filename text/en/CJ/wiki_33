<text>The Nimbin Aquarius Festival was a counter-cultural arts and music festival organised by the Australian Union of Students. It was the fourth in a biannual series of festivals, first organised by the National Union of Australian University Students. The first Australian Universities Arts Festival was held in Sydney in 1967, and the second Australian Universities Arts Festival was held in Melbourne in 1969. The third added &quot;Aquarius&quot; to its name and was held in Canberra in 1971. The fourth and last was held in Nimbin, New South Wales in 1973.

The Aquarius Festival aimed to celebrate alternative thinking and sustainable lifestyles. The ten-day event was held from 12 to 23 May 1973 and co-directed by Johnny Allen and Graeme Dunstan. Vernon Treweeke also played a part in organising the event. It is often described as Australia&#x27;s equivalent to the Woodstock Festival and the birthplace for Australia&#x27;s hippie movement. It has also been credited with being the first event that sought the permission to use the land from traditional owners, and included a Welcome to Country ceremony. The estimated attendance at Nimbin was between 5,000 and 10,000 people.

==Performers==
Performers at the festival included the White Company - an experimental theatre troupe featuring a number of alternative culture artists including Peter Carolan - singer Paul Joseph, Donny McCormack (ex-Nutwood Rug Band), The Larrikins and Ian Farr. Also appearing were Indian street performers the Bauls of Bengal, the South African pianist Dollar Brand (later known as Abdullah Ibrahim), classical-ambient musician Lindsay Bourke, and tightrope walker and unicyclist Philippe Petit, who gained worldwide fame the following year by walking between the rooftops of the Twin Towers at the World Trade Center. The New Zealand-based musical and theatrical troupe Blerta also made an appearance, starring the likes of Bruno Lawrence and Geoff Murphy, both of whom later went on to produce a number of successful feature films together.

==Legacy==
The festival had a permanent effect on the economy of Nimbin, as many Festival participants decided to remain in the district. The area was previously a dairying and banana growing region in severe decline. Some of those that stayed might be defined as hippies, but in fact the larger percentage came from all sorts of backgrounds and life experience, ranging from 18 to 80 years old.

One group pooled resources after the Nimbin Aquarius Festival and bought a then property at Tuntable Falls in the next valley east, below Mount Nardi, and formed a community called the &quot;Co-Ordination Co-Operative&quot;. Other groups followed suit and formed communes that continue today. Examples include Paradise Valley Pastoral Company and Nmbngee.

Interviews were conducted in 1992 documenting the alternative lifestyle movement of northern NSW in the 1970s, focusing on the town of Nimbin and the 1973 Aquarius Festival. Interviewees discussed how they arrived in Nimbin, their efforts in organising the Aquarius Festival, and the lasting impact the Festival had on the township.

<text>Claire Burch (1925 in Brooklyn, New York – May 21, 2009) was an American author, filmmaker and poet.

==History==
After attending grade school in Brooklyn, Burch completed a commercial art course at Washington Irving High School in Manhattan and received her B.A. in English from NYU. In the suburbs of Great Neck, New York, she first began writing poetry and articles which were published in &quot;Life&quot; magazine, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, and numerous literary quarterlies and anthologies. Burch also developed a career as a psychiatric writer, publishing two books on the subject: &quot;Careers in Psychiatry&quot; and &quot;Stranger in the Family&quot;.

In the early 1970s Burch became a playwright and painter. Her play &quot;Ten Cents a Dance&quot; was optioned to be directed by José Quintero, the famous O&#x27;Neill interpreter. Burch wrote a total of seven plays and several folk operas, but eventually moved on to filmmaking and video anthropology—she was an early adapter of video as a medium.

In 1978, Burch moved to California with her longtime companion Mark Weiman, publisher and owner of Berkeley&#x27;s Regent Press. She had endured a series of illnesses and wanted to escape the harsh climate of Manhattan.

Burch gained insight and inspiration from insanity and the often unexpected behavior associated with it. She would often videotape homeless people in People&#x27;s Park and Telegraph Avenue in Berkeley, which were collected in her film &quot;People&#x27;s Park in Berkeley: Then and Now.&quot; The film documented the dispute between homeless activists and the University of California from the riots of 1969 through 1996 by interviewing park &quot;regulars,&quot; and profiling the events surrounding the deaths of park supporters James Rector and Rosebud Denovo.

She also produced documentaries on noted cultural figures such as James Baldwin (whom she knew as a teenager), Timothy Leary and Country Joe McDonald. Also of note was &quot;Oracle Rising&quot;, a film about the legendary psychedelic newspaper &quot;The SF Oracle&quot; published in the Haight-Ashbury district during the Summer of Love. Her last completed film was &quot;Elegy for the Naked Guy&quot;, about the life and death of Andrew Martinez, a well-known figure on the Berkeley campus in the mid-&#x27;90s who died in prison in 2007.

Late in life Burch suffered a stroke which took most of her vision, but she was able to retain enough sight to frame her subjects. She died before completing her final project, &quot;Gimme an &#x27;F&#x27;,&quot; a documentary on Country Joe McDonald and the song that helped end the Vietnam War, the &quot;Fuck Cheer&quot; from Woodstock, and the &quot;Fixin&#x27; to Die Rag.&quot; The film is estimated to be 70% complete.

==Family==
At 18, Burch married a soldier and the couple raised three children in Great Neck and Greenwich Village. When her husband Brad died in 1967, she and her kids moved full-time to the West Village. Burch&#x27;s interest in psychiatry bloomed after she adopted a child who was diagnosed with schizophrenia.

==Drug use==
Burch underwent a traditional four-times-weekly Freudian analysis before switching to marijuana and LSD in the early 1970s. She was a recreational marijuana user throughout her life.

==Death==
Burch died at the age of 84. She left behind a vast archive in almost every media--visual art (painting and drawing); writing (a dozen published books and thousands of pages of unpublished manuscripts); music (thousands of hours of reel-to-reel, cassette tapes of her original music and hundreds of songs); and a huge library of both edited and unedited film and video, representing her habit of recording about an hour of reality every day for the past 36 years. This last project creates an archival nightmare, as there is not enough time to view it all. Burch was fond of referring to the Collyer Brothers, a pair of New Yorkers who suffered from a fear of throwing anything away and filled their apartment from top to bottom. She would often mockingly refer to her own archival efforts in the same vein.

==Change of era==
* 1661 : The new era name of &quot;Kanbun&quot; (meaning &quot;Generous Art&quot;) was created to mark a number of disasters, including a great fire at the Imperial Palace. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in &quot;Manji&quot; 4.

==Events of the &quot;Kanbun&quot; era==
* March 20, 1662 (&quot;Kanbun 2, 1st day of the 2nd month&quot;): There was a violent earthquake in Heian-kyō which destroyed the tomb of Toyotomi Hideyoshi .
* 1662 (&quot;Kanbun 2&quot;): Emperor Gosai ordered Tosa Hiromichi (土佐広通, 1599–1670), a Tosa-school disciple, to adopt the name Sumiyoshi (probably in reference to a 13th-century painter, Sumiyoshi Keinin 住吉慶忍), upon assuming a position as official painter for the Sumiyoshi Taisha 住吉大社.
* March 5, 1663 (&quot;Kanbun 3, 26th day of the 1st month&quot;): Go-sai abdicated in favor of his younger brother, Satohito, aged 10; and then he lived in complete retirement until his death.

<text>The British Rail Class 104 diesel multiple units were built by Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon Company from 1957 to 1959.

A product of British Rail&#x27;s Modernisation Plan of 1954, the 104s were designed for general branch line and commuter routes. The first units ordered were for the London Midland Region, with the majority of the class for use in North West of England. The Class 110 was a re-engineered version of the 104 with more powerful engines, but did not last as long in service. The 104s had asbestos insulation removed during the 1970s.

==Operations==

===Greater Manchester===
The 104 was introduced on 17 June 1957. The type was seen regularly on services from Manchester to Buxton, Marple, New Mills and Blackpool. The 104 was ideal for these routes as the lightweight chassis were well suited to the hilly lines in the northwest of England. A regular sight in the Greater Manchester area for over 30 years, the 104s were replaced by Sprinters by 1990, with the last running on 4 May 1990.

===Scotland===
In early 1984 a few units reallocated to Scotland to replace Class 107s. A fire at Ayr depot had destroyed several trains and the 104s were called in to replace them. One unit was repainted in a unique maroon and white livery for services to Oban – it became known as the &quot;Mexican Bean&quot;. The 104s were withdrawn from Scotland in April 1989 and were replaced by &quot;Sprinter&quot; DMUs.

===London Region===
Other vehicles spent time in London and the last vehicles could be found on the Gospel Oak to Barking line. They were withdrawn in 1995.

==Orders==


==Accidents and incidents==
*On 18 January 1986, a Class 104 unit (vehicles 53433 &amp; 53482) suffered a brake failure, ran past three signals at danger and collided with Class 47 locomotive 47 111 near . Forty-four people were injured.

==Departmental Use==
A number of Class 104s were used following their withdrawal from passenger services.

The last two London Midland DTCL vehicles to survive, M54182 &amp; M54183, were converted in 1987/1988 into loco hauled Sandite cars and renumbered ADB977554/ADB977555 respectively. Used until 1994, M54183 was scrapped in February 1994 while M54182 was stored at Buxton until June 2000 and was saved for preservation.

Other Sandite cars included 53472, 53478 &amp; 53530 which were used in Scotland until April 1989.

Derby RTC, known for their railway testing, used 53475, 53506 &amp; 53422 (renumbered 977342, 977343 &amp; 977344 respectively) as carriage washing test coaches. They also used 53451 &amp; 53529 as part of DMU auto-gear experiments until February 1991.

M54182 was the only vehicle converted for non-passenger use to survive into preservation. In 2008 after several years in storage, the vehicle was restored externally, retaining its departmental condition and run in a demonstration capacity with Class 37 37075 for a gala weekend at the Churnet Valley Railway. It was believed by the organisers to be the first and only time that departmental DMU Sandite operations had been recreated in a heritage setting.

==Preservation==
13 Class 104 vehicles are preserved, all were owned privately by two individuals. 12 vehicles were preserved in 1992 in a bulk tender from British Rail who at the time were reluctant to sell individual vehicles or sets. The thirteenth was saved in 2000 after protracted storage after departmental use. In 2020 the first one was scrapped (50556) due to its extremely poor condition at the East Lancashire Railway.
===East Lancs Railway===
The East Lancs Railway is now the main location for Class 104 preservation, with a number of vehicles based there. The line is geographically appropriate to the Class, being close to Manchester, and lines that the Class 104&#x27;s served for most of their lives. During their time at the Churnet Valley Railway a small restoration team returned a 2-car set to service between 1997 &amp; 2004. Between 2005 &amp; 2010 attention turned to the rebuild of unique Trailer Composite Lavatory (TCL) M59137 to strengthen the 2-car set to 3 cars, however limited resources put the restoration on hold. Driving Trailer Composite Lavatory (DTCL) ADB977554 was also cosmetically restored into BR Blue livery in 2008 and performed demonstration sandite trains that year with Class 37 Diesel 37075.

===Llangollen Railway===
The Llangollen Railway received three vehicles in 1994 on a long-term loan basis. A 2-car set (M50454/M50528) was quickly returned to service in 1994 and has operated in service every season bar one since. The railway also have a &quot;spare&quot; power car (M50447) which was used as a mess-coach and workshop between 1994 &amp; 2011 before being selected itself for a restoration to operating condition, which is currently ongoing.

===North Norfolk Railway===
The North Norfolk Railway received DTCL 56182 in February 2015 from the Churnet Valley Railway for restoration back to original condition. It was then joined by 50479 in October 2020 from the Telford Steam Railway for restoration but is currently stored until 56182 is completed. 50479 will receive a rolling restoration, so it can be used to haul 56182 at special events, of body and interior to bring it up to a fully restored condition. Once restoration of both vehicles are complete they will run in a as delivered 2-car power trailer formation.

===Telford Steam Railway===
The Telford Steam Railway was home to the remaining four vehicles (also on long-term loan), which arrived between 1999 and 2001 from Oswestry, Crewe and Meadowhall. Between 1999 &amp; 2004 the railway operated a 2-car set formed of M50479/M50531 but it was later downgraded to coaching stock use only and by 2010 only M50479 was used. Then in 2018 M50479 was finally withdraw and stored. The other two vehicles, E59228 &amp; E53556, are in poor condition and have not run in preservation. E53556 left for the East Lanchshire Railway in November 2017 to be scrapped. M50479 left in October 2020 for the North Norfolk Railway after the loan was terminated. It will be restored after M56182. E59228 left in October 2020 for the East Lancashire Railway where it will be stored for the foreseeable future after the loan terminated in 2017.

<text>USS &quot;Tarbell&quot; (DD–142) was a in the United States Navy during World War I. She was the first ship named for Captain Joseph Tarbell.

&quot;Tarbell&quot; was laid down on 31 December 1917 at Philadelphia by William Cramp &amp; Sons Ship &amp; Engine Building Company. The ship was launched on 28 May 1918, sponsored by Miss Virgie Tarbell, and commissioned on 27 November 1918, Commander Halsey Powell in command.

==Service history==
&quot;Tarbell&quot; operated along the eastern seaboard until September 1919, when she was reassigned to the Pacific Fleet. Based at San Francisco, she served with Destroyer Division 15, of Destroyer Flotilla 5 and Destroyer Squadron 4, until late January 1920 when she joined Division 13 of the same flotilla and squadron. In February, her home yard was changed to Cavite in the Philippines, and in March, the destroyer joined the Asiatic Fleet. &quot;Tarbell&quot; served on the Asiatic Station until mid-1921, when she returned to the Pacific Fleet with her home yard at Puget Sound. She operated with the Pacific Fleet until she was decommissioned on 8 June 1922 and berthed at San Diego, California.

On 29 May 1930, &quot;Tarbell&quot; was recommissioned and assigned to Destroyer Division 11, Destroyer Squadron 10, Destroyer Squadrons, Battle Fleet. Her home port was San Diego until January 1931, when it was changed to Charleston, South Carolina. However, she remained assigned to the same administrative organization until March, when she was reassigned to Destroyer Division 3 of the Scouting Force. Sometime between July and October 1934, the destroyer changed home ports back to San Diego, but remained a part of the Scouting Force Destroyers. Late in 1936, &quot;Tarbell&quot; returned to the east coast to prepare for her second decommissioning, this time at Philadelphia.

She remained there until after war broke out in Europe in September 1939. To keep the war out of the Americas, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued two Neutrality Acts on 5 September and ordered the Navy to form a Neutrality Patrol. A month later, on 4 October 1939, &quot;Tarbell&quot; was placed back in commission at Philadelphia. She operated in the Atlantic with the Neutrality Patrol for over two years before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor jolted the United States into the war.

===World War II===
&quot;Tarbell&quot;″s duties remained much the same after the United States entered the conflict. The destroyer continued to escort convoys and perform antisubmarine work in the northern Atlantic. She shuttled merchant ships back and forth across the ocean and operated out of the east coast ports on rescue missions to pick up survivors of torpedoed ships.

One such rescue mission occurred on 26 March 1942. A Socony tanker, , was torpedoed off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, and &quot;Tarbell&quot;″s lookouts sighted her distress flares a little before 0900. The destroyer rang up full speed; and, one-half hour later, she arrived at the scene of the attack. She dropped a depth charge barrage to drive off any U-boats lurking in the vicinity and then picked up 22 survivors. After a futile search for the enemy submarine, she disembarked the survivors at Morehead City, North Carolina.

In May 1942, the destroyer began helping in the surveillance of Vichy French warships in the Caribbean Sea. To assure that those French ships were not turned over to the Germans and that, in accordance with the Panama Declaration, there be no transfer of European possessions in America to any non-American power, she was assigned a patrol area around Pointe-à-Pitre, Grand Terre Island, Guadeloupe, and her specific charge was the old training cruiser &quot;Jeanne D&#x27;Arc&quot;.

Her rescue missions continued along with observation missions. On 16 May, she rescued 24 members of the crew of , torpedoed four days out of New York. On the evening of 25 May, when word reached her at San Juan, Puerto Rico of a U-boat attack on the destroyer , &quot;Tarbell&quot; got underway so rapidly that two of her officers and 13 crewmen were left behind in Puerto Rico. The following day, she picked up eight wounded &quot;Blakeley&quot; crewmen at Martinique, then participated in the search for the U-boat until the afternoon of 27 May. On 2 June, &quot;Tarbell&quot; rescued 19 survivors of . Two days later, the destroyer sighted survivors of the sinking of and brought them aboard, running her tally up to 31 men rescued on that mission.

Following additional escort duty in the Caribbean and in the Gulf of Mexico, &quot;Tarbell&quot; began screening transatlantic convoys in mid-May 1943. Her first voyage was in the escort of convoy UGS-9 which was augmented by the latest development in antisubmarine warfare (ASW)—an escort carrier. The convoy reached Casablanca safely on 15 June. &quot;Tarbell&quot; returned to the United States at New York, underwent repairs, and conducted training before joining another Casablanca-bound convoy in August. Upon her return to New York, the destroyer resumed local escort work until 22 October, when she departed New York in company with , , and to cover the passage of another convoy. The unit steamed via Bermuda, where it was joined by , and arrived at Casablanca on 3 November. Following a short voyage to Gibraltar, &quot;Tarbell&quot; headed back across the Atlantic on 10 November. The return convoy entered New York harbor on 21 November.

The following month brought an availability, refresher training, and time spent in training prospective crews for destroyer-type warships. On 26 December, she departed Norfolk in company with and Destroyer Division 61 to cover convoy UGS-28 to North Africa, from there operating as a hunter/ killer group in the vicinity of the Azores. On 31 December, &quot;Lea&quot; was severely damaged in a collision, and &quot;Tarbell&quot; took her in tow for Bermuda. On 3 January 1944, the destroyer was relieved of her towing duties by and and caught up with the convoy at Horta in the Azores on the 7th.

After hunting submarines along the convoy routes, &quot;Tarbell&quot;″s group reached Norfolk, on 7 February, and the destroyer set out for a 10-day availability at Boston. Following that, she was assigned to the Air Force, Atlantic Fleet (AirLant) for air crew training operations off Provincetown, Massachusetts. Relieved of that duty in April, she operated for a time in the screen of and . From then until July 1945, she alternated between carrier escort duty and target ship duty with AirLant. On 20 July 1945, &quot;Tarbell&quot; was placed out of commission at Philadelphia. Her name was struck from the Navy List on 13 August 1945, and she was sold for scrapping on 30 November 1945 to the Boston Metal Salvage Company, Baltimore, Maryland.

As of 2012, no other ship in the United States Navy has borne this name.

<text>Mary Hallock Foote (1847–1938) was an American author and illustrator. She is best known for her illustrated short stories and novels portraying life in the mining communities of the turn-of-the-century American West.

==Biography==

===Overview===

Mary Hallock was born November 9, 1847, in Milton, New York, of English Quaker ancestry. A singular girl and youth, she attended the Female Collegiate Seminary in Poughkeepsie, New York, then studied art in New York City at the new Cooper Institute School of Design for Women. By her early twenties she had become established in New York City as an accomplished artist-illustrator for notable publishers there.

In 1876 Hallock married a young mining engineer, Arthur De Wint Foote,
then moved cross-continent to live with him at the New Almaden mine near San Jose, California. Subsequently, as Arthur pursued his engineering career, she followed him throughout the West: to Leadville, Colorado; to Deadwood, South Dakota; then to Boise, Idaho, where Arthur originated a major irrigation project on the Boise River; then to Morelia, Michoacán, Mexico; and finally to Grass Valley, California, where Arthur advanced to managing the North Star mine, and retired there.

Arthur and Mary Foote were married nearly sixty years. In the early years of their marriage she gave birth to three children: a son, Arthur Burling Foote, and two daughters, Betty and Agnes.

===Career===
As a student Mary Hallock Foote befriended American artist Helena de Kay Gilder. The two maintained a very close friendship throughout their lives, shared a lengthy correspondence via letter, and used each other for critiquing their work. Mary Hallock Foote also benefitted from Gilder&#x27;s husband Richard Watson Gilder, who commissioned her art while he was an editor for Scribner&#x27;s Monthly. It was through the Gilders that Mary Hallock Foote was also introduced to a circle of fellow artists including, Mary L. Stone, Mary Birney, Maria Oakey, and several popular writers.

After departing her beloved East with great reluctance, Mary Hallock Foote found herself inspired by the &quot;real West&quot; country and the varying peoples she encountered there. She soon was drawing it, and writing and telling about it.
Recording her travels, Foote wrote stories for &#x27;back-East&#x27; readers as a correspondent to &quot;The Century Magazine&quot; and other periodicals, illustrating them with wood engravings made from her drawings. She wrote several novels and is best known for her stories of place, in which she portrayed the rough, picturesque life she experienced and observed in the old West, especially that in the early mining towns. 

She was one of America&#x27;s best-known women illustrators in the 1870s and 1880s. She illustrated stories and novels by other authors including Nathaniel Hawthorne, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Louisa May Alcott, Bret Harte, and others. Foote exhibited her work at The Woman&#x27;s Building at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, Illinois.

Mary Foote gained renown as a welcoming and sophisticated hostess to dignitaries and celebrities traveling through the environs of her (successive) homesteads in the West. After 1905, when she and her husband built North Star House (also known as Foote Mansion) and made permanent settlement in Grass Valley, California, she presided for some 30 years over many historic social and civic events there.

After her death, Foote fell into obscurity. Thirty-four years after her death, historian Rodman Paul&#x27;s 1972 edition of Foote&#x27;s unpublished memoir, &quot;A Victorian Gentlewoman in the Far West&quot;, helped to spur renewed interest in her life and work. However, her letters—which provide what amounts to a biography of her husband as well as her own autobiography—have never been published except as brief excerpts in various areas of research.

===Death and legacy===

Mary Hallock Foote died June 25, 1938, at age 90. Her legacy in American history is as a stalwart of the American Old West and a teller of its stories. Her work—the numerous stories for books and periodicals, with her drawings and woodcut illustrations; the correspondence from western outposts; her novels and nonfiction—gained her notice as a skilled observer of the frontier and an accomplished writer. Her life expressed the civilizing influence of the educated eastern gentlewoman on life in the chaotic mining and &quot;ditch&quot; camps (irrigation-project construction camps) of the early American West and, conversely, the stimulating effect of those &quot;old West&quot; environs on the prepared mind, that is, one educated for illustrating and telling the story.

===Controversy===

Wallace Stegner&#x27;s novel &quot;Angle of Repose&quot; (Pulitzer Prize, 1972) is based directly upon Mary Hallock Foote&#x27;s extensive personal correspondence. Stegner used the outline of her life ostensibly with permission from members of Foote&#x27;s family—on proviso that he disguise the source, which, in his judgment, he did. After publication, however, some descendants objected to &quot;the great liberties&quot; taken by Stegner in using Foote&#x27;s story. On the opposite hand, Stegner used passages taken directly from Foote&#x27;s letters and her reminiscences without providing specific credit; this resulted in controversy that still today haunts his reputation within the literary community.

Andrew Imbrie wrote an opera based upon Stegner&#x27;s novel, which was performed in San Francisco in 1976. A collection of prints by Foote is on permanent exhibit at the Boise Public Library.

<text>In applied mathematics, a DFT matrix is an expression of a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as a transformation matrix, which can be applied to a signal through matrix multiplication.

==Definition==
An &quot;N&quot;-point DFT is expressed as the multiplication formula_1, where formula_2 is the original input signal, formula_3 is the &quot;N&quot;-by-&quot;N&quot; square DFT matrix, and formula_4 is the DFT of the signal.

The transformation matrix formula_3 can be defined as formula_6, or equivalently:

:formula_7,

where formula_8 is a primitive &quot;N&quot;th root of unity in which formula_9. We can avoid writing large exponents for formula_10 using the fact that for any exponent formula_2 we have the identity formula_12 This is the Vandermonde matrix for the roots of unity, up to the normalization factor. Note that the normalization factor in front of the sum ( formula_13 ) and the sign of the exponent in ω are merely conventions, and differ in some treatments. All of the following discussion applies regardless of the convention, with at most minor adjustments. The only important thing is that the forward and inverse transforms have opposite-sign exponents, and that the product of their normalization factors be 1/&quot;N&quot;. However, the formula_13 choice here makes the resulting DFT matrix unitary, which is convenient in many circumstances.

Fast Fourier transform algorithms utilize the symmetries of the matrix to reduce the time of multiplying a vector by this matrix, from the usual formula_15. Similar techniques can be applied for multiplications by matrices such as Hadamard matrix and the Walsh matrix.

==Examples==

===Two-point===
The two-point DFT is a simple case, in which the first entry is the DC (sum) and the second entry is the AC (difference).

:formula_16

The first row performs the sum, and the second row performs the difference.

The factor of formula_17 is to make the transform unitary (see below).

===Four-point===
The four-point clockwise DFT matrix is as follows:

:formula_18
where formula_19.

===Eight-point===
The first non-trivial integer power of two case is for eight points:

:formula_20

where

:formula_21

(Note that formula_22.)

Evaluating for the value of formula_10, gives:

formula_24
The following image depicts the DFT as a matrix multiplication, with elements of the matrix depicted by samples of complex exponentials:

The real part (cosine wave) is denoted by a solid line, and the imaginary part (sine wave) by a dashed line.

The top row is all ones (scaled by formula_25 for unitarity), so it &quot;measures&quot; the DC component in the input signal. The next row is eight samples of negative one cycle of a complex exponential, i.e., a signal with a fractional frequency of −1/8, so it &quot;measures&quot; how much &quot;strength&quot; there is at fractional frequency +1/8 in the signal. Recall that a matched filter compares the signal with a time reversed version of whatever we&#x27;re looking for, so when we&#x27;re looking for fracfreq. 1/8 we compare with fracfreq. −1/8 so that is why this row is a negative frequency. The next row is negative two cycles of a complex exponential, sampled in eight places, so it has a fractional frequency of −1/4, and thus &quot;measures&quot; the extent to which the signal has a fractional frequency of +1/4.

The following summarizes how the 8-point DFT works, row by row, in terms of fractional frequency:

* 0 measures how much DC is in the signal
* −1/8 measures how much of the signal has a fractional frequency of +1/8
* −1/4 measures how much of the signal has a fractional frequency of +1/4
* −3/8 measures how much of the signal has a fractional frequency of +3/8
* −1/2 measures how much of the signal has a fractional frequency of +1/2
* −5/8 measures how much of the signal has a fractional frequency of +5/8
* −3/4 measures how much of the signal has a fractional frequency of +3/4
* −7/8 measures how much of the signal has a fractional frequency of +7/8

Equivalently the last row can be said to have a fractional frequency of +1/8 and thus measure how much of the signal has a fractional frequency of −1/8. In this way, it could be said that the top rows of the matrix &quot;measure&quot; positive frequency content in the signal and the bottom rows measure negative frequency component in the signal.

==Unitary transform==
The DFT is (or can be, through appropriate selection of scaling) a unitary transform, i.e., one that preserves energy. The appropriate choice of scaling to achieve unitarity is formula_13, so that the energy in the physical domain will be the same as the energy in the Fourier domain, i.e., to satisfy Parseval&#x27;s theorem. (Other, non-unitary, scalings, are also commonly used for computational convenience; e.g., the convolution theorem takes on a slightly simpler form with the scaling shown in the discrete Fourier transform article.)

==Other properties==
For other properties of the DFT matrix, including its eigenvalues, connection to convolutions, applications, and so on, see the discrete Fourier transform article.

==A limiting case: The Fourier operator==
The notion of a Fourier transform is readily generalized. One such formal generalization of the &quot;N&quot;-point DFT can be imagined by taking &quot;N&quot; arbitrarily large. In the limit, the rigorous mathematical machinery treats such linear operators as so-called integral transforms. In this case, if we make a very large matrix with complex exponentials in the rows (i.e., cosine real parts and sine imaginary parts), and increase the resolution without bound, we approach the kernel of the Fredholm integral equation of the 2nd kind, namely the Fourier operator that defines the continuous Fourier transform. A rectangular portion of this continuous Fourier operator can be displayed as an image, analogous to the DFT matrix, as shown at right, where greyscale pixel value denotes numerical quantity.

<text>Villavicencio () is a city and municipality in Colombia. The capital of Meta Department, it was founded on April 6, 1840. The municipality had a population of 531,275 in 2018. The city is located at 4°08&#x27;N, 73°40&#x27;W, 75 km (about 45 mi) southeast of the Colombian capital city of Bogotá (DC) by the Guatiquía River. It is the most important commercial center in the Llanos Orientales (eastern plains) of Colombia. 

Villavicencio has a hot and very wet climate, with average daily temperatures ranging from and an annual rainfall of around . It is affectionately called &quot;Villavo&quot; la bella. Villavicencio lies on the great Colombian-Venezuelan plain called the Llanos, situated to the east of the Andes mountains. Villavicencio is also called &quot;La Puerta al Llano&quot;, or &quot;The Gateway to the Plains&quot;, due to its location on the historical path from the Colombian interior to the vast savannas that lie between the Andes range and the Amazon rainforest.

Villavicencio&#x27;s proximity to huge mountains and great plains make the city an example of Colombia&#x27;s geodiversity. Because it is located in the foothills of the Andes, the morning and evening breezes cool the city, which is very hot for most of the day.

==History==
The German Conquistador Nikolaus Federmann reached the altiplano of Bogotá in 1536 by approaching it from the plains of Venezuela, a large unsettled area that is formed by the Orinoco basin. However, the vast area of these plains remained unexplored and uncolonized for the next 300 years. Colombia was settled along the mountainous folds of the Magdalena and Cauca valleys, and its commerce with the outside world was oriented towards the Caribbean Sea, thus, because of its mountainous barriers, the extreme heat, and inhospitable climate, the Llanos remained forgotten and unsettled for many decades.

The Llaneros, the inhabitants of the plains, are fierce horsemen who first fought for the Spanish royalists and then for the Venezuelan and Colombian rebels during the War of Independence. During independence, they crossed the Cordillera Oriental with Simón Bolívar, and surprised the royalist army on the plains of Boyaca on the 6th of August, 1819, which cleared the way for the taking of an abandoned Santa Fe de Bogotá the next week.

In the 1840s, some farmers from Caqueza, a town on the eastern folds of Bogotá, started the modest settlement of Gramalote, which would officially become the parish of Villavicencio in 1855. The parish was named for Antonio Villavicencio, a patriot in the Colombian war of independence. Vaccines, a mule road, and the availability of vast areas of free land, drove new colonizers to continue the settlement of Villavicencio. As the roads improved the access to the Llanos, the farmers could send their produce and cattle to the markets of Bogotá.

In 1948, large landowners expelled many farmers out of their lands across the country, explained in part by the momentum of the assassination of Jorge Eliecer Gaitan, a popular Liberal politician. The Llaneros resisted by driving the army out of population centers. The guerrillas never took Villavicencio, but they brought the fighting to the military base of Apiay. As the fighting between the government and the Llanero guerrillas was out of control, a military coup in June 1953, took Gustavo Rojas Pinilla to power who immediately negotiated a cease fire and amnesty for the insurgents.

=== 1948–present ===
Villavicencio has grown from a small settlement of no more than 20 people in the 1850s to a settlement of over 500,000 inhabitants in 2018. A new road of bridges and tunnels has shortened the driving time to Bogotá from two or three hours, depending on the season of the year, to one and half hours to move the oil, cattle, and agricultural products faster.

==Geography==

The city is located in the Orinoquia region, where the Oriental Plains begin. Most of the city&#x27;s land is flat ground draining away from the Andes. The Guatiquia borders the city to the north and east. Caqueza and Chipaque are located northwest of Villavicencio. A true portal to the Llanos, the roads south of Villavicencio lead to Acacias and San Martin, the first historical town of the Llanos, which was an early Jesuit settlement. East of Villavo they point towards Apiay, Puerto Lopez and the fluvial port of Orocue on the Meta river, a strong affluent of the Orinoco.

== Hydrography ==
Villavicencio, capital of the Department of Meta, lies on the slopes of the Eastern Cordillera a few blocks from the mighty Guatiquía River, surrounded by streams and creeks such as the Parrado and Gramalote, the Ocoa to the east and the Negro and Guayuriba rivers to the south. Among the main tributaries that irrigate the jurisdiction of Villavicencio are the Guatiquía, Guayuriba, Negro and Ocoa rivers. 

==Climate==
Villavicencio has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen &quot;Af&quot;). The climate is hot and sometimes humid, though its proximity to the foothills of the Oriental Andes brings mild breezes to the city at nightfall. Average temperature is . Although January is almost dry enough for tropical monsoon (&quot;Am&quot;) classification, the other eleven months all receive over of rain, and for eight months from April to November monthly rainfall consistently exceeds .

==Economy==

In recent years the city has achieved an economic development strengthened by the trade sector, thanks to the dynamics generated by the roads that channel to the interior and the center of the country the agricultural and agro-industrial industry of the Llano, as well as the products entering the region from different parts of Colombia. Construction activity is very important. Gas and oil exploitation in the Apiay field are part of the region&#x27;s mining activity.
Cattle, agriculture, and the exportation of crude oil fuel the Villavicencio economy. Imports from the surrounding area include coffee, bananas, and rice.

La Vanguardia Airport serves Villavicencio with flights to the rest of Colombia on four airlines, including Colombian major airlines Avianca and Latam Colombia.

Villavicencio continues to be the main collection and supply center for the municipalities of Villavicencio and the municipalities of the Colombian Orinoco region, as well as the main oil and gas-producing municipality; however, most of the jobs are being generated in commercial and service activities, that is, in non-productive and non-tradable sectors. Large constructions, roads, financial resources, and tourism revolve around these commercial dynamics and services. This means that the department&#x27;s contribution to the National GDP is less than 2%, a figure that has been maintained over the last 49 years, that is, from 1960 to 2009.

==Education==
The city of Villavicencio has a network of public and private institutions that provide and guarantee the right to education at the primary, secondary, technical, and higher education levels. As the hub city of the Eastern Plains, Villavicencio is the main urban university center of the region to which young people from neighboring departments come.
* University of the Llanos is a public university located within Villavicencio. Other higher education institutions include Cooperative University of Colombia, Saint Thomas Aquinas University, Saint Martin University, Uniminuto, UAN.
* Universidad Santo Tomás Offers presential programs, and more than 22 programs in open and distance mode (VUAD), among which are: International Business, Agricultural Business Administration, Civil Engineering, Environmental Engineering, Psychology, Law and Public Accounting. It has High-Quality Institutional Accreditation Res. 01456/29/01/2016.
* Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia: The Universidad Cooperativa de Colombia is an institution of Higher Education founded in 1958, socially owned, which by its origin and organization belongs to the Solidarity Economy sector. It has branches in other cities of the country.

* Minuto de Dios University offers the following degree programs and free courses: Social Communication-Journalism, Business Administration, Computer Technology, Graphic Communication Technology, among free courses in Basic Computer Science and Basic Programming.

== Sports ==
The city has a football (soccer) team, the Llaneros fútbol club, which plays in Colombia&#x27;s second division.

The Colombian Football Federation announced that Villavicencio was to have been one of the venue cities to host the 2016 FIFA Futsal World Cup, however it was replaced by Medellín.

== Tourism ==
Villavicencio&#x27;s tourism activity has been the result of progress in commercial activity and services; in other words, its growth depends on commercial dynamics, the services provided, and the efforts of municipal and departmental administrations. Tourism is carried out in both urban and rural areas (corregimientos) and has grown in both sectors.
Due to the growing interest in tourism in the region, the highways have been modernized and improved, shortening the driving time and distance to the capital Bogotá. As a result, Villavicencio and other adjacent municipalities (Acacías, Cubarral, Cumaral, Restrepo, Puerto Lopéz, Puerto Gaitán, Cáqueza) are growing in popularity as tourist destinations. In preparation to meet this demand, tourism development plans and strategies are implemented by the departmental and municipal governments, as well as the Cotelco branch. In relation to physical infrastructure, the city has an acceptable hotel inventory, as well as agro-tourism properties.

=== Monuments ===
* Cristo Rey: This cultural heritage site is located on El Redentor hill, with a height of approximately 30 meters and with the figure of Christ the King, which with his arms outstretched to the sides and looking at the city, symbolizes protection, a cry for peace in times of violence that the territory lived in the 50s.

* Monument to the Founders: It was the last work of the renowned Colombian sculptor, Rodrigo Arenas Betancourt, is located in the park of the same name on the road that leads from Villavicencio to Acacías.
* Biodiversidad Monument: Represented by a yellow hand with a ring in each of its five fingers, pays homage to the natural heritage of the Eastern Plains Region. Meta department, rich in ecosystems, flora and fauna, proudly shows respect for its characteristic biodiversity.
* Waterfalls: Meta is considered one of the best departments in Colombia to enjoy tourism, given the variety of flora, fauna, culture, and gastronomy that characterizes it. In addition to the unique experience that can be lived by the natural waterfalls with which it counts.

* Los Ocarros Biopark: Located on the road leading to Restrepo and Cumaral, around the lake formed by the waters of the Vanguardia stream and as a gateway to the nature reserve of the same name. It is the only zoological institution in the country dedicated exclusively to the preservation of regional natural wealth, which brings together the biodiversity of fauna, flora, and ecosystems of the Colombian Orinoco region. Exclusively flora and fauna of the region, highlighting the serpentarium, the giant armadillos or ocarros, the Orinoco caiman, and the spectacled bear.

== Festival ==
Villavicencio is the capital of the Llanos Orientales and celebrates its anniversary every April 6 to pay tribute to its history and culture. This is an event where the city attracts much more tourism as artistic events such as concerts, parades, fairs, as well as sports competitions and fireworks are held. All activities are free and all are welcome to attend.

Concurso mundial de la Mujer Vaquera 
Occurring annually in Las Malocas Park, participants demonstrate their skills in llano work and rodeo, and where llanera music is also performed by top musicians of this Colombian-Venezuelan genre. This event is in March, Women&#x27;s Month and lasts three days, it is dedicated to exalting the skills of the llanera women and also summons other sportswomen from other countries. The llanera women compete in different events such as milking, agility and dexterity in horse riding, saddling, and rein handling.

International Joropo Tournament (Villavicencio):

The International Joropo Tournament is the most important cultural and artistic event in the region of Meta. It is held in the first week of July and lasts 5 days. As part of this event, the anniversary of the department is also celebrated. Highlights of the event include the international joropo beauty pageant, competitions such as voice passage, contrapunteo, best artist, best maraquero, best harpist, unpublished voice and unpublished song. The so-called Joropódromo is held in the streets of Villavicencio where more than 3,000 couples gather to dance the joropo dance, a traditional dance of the region.

== Parks ==

=== The periodistas Park ===
It was previously named Infantilpark. It is a landmark of the foundation of the city, which occurred around 1842. The park is surrounded by a group of colorful houses from the 19th century, by restaurant and cafes and by trees that lavish shadow and freshness.

=== The Hacha Park ===
The actual name of this central park is Jose Eustacio Rivera, but people in Villavicencio call it Hacha Park because of the monument that presides it. The place pays tribute to the author of The Vortex, while the ax refers to the early settlers that used this tool to open the trails in Meta and change the land.

=== Los Centauros Plaza ===
It is located in the center of Villavicencio and surrounded by leafy trees, is a pleasant walking area. It takes its name from the sculpture made by the artist Patricia Vilduvieso and Luis Enrique Ballen. The art piece pays a tribute to the plains cowboys who is totally assimilated with his horse.

== Culture ==
Villavicencio shares the condition of land of immigrants with the region of the Eastern Plains of Colombia; from its foundation to the present, people from the interior of the country and the coasts have sought and found in the city the conditions and the receptivity to establish themselves; At the same time, they have contributed to forge a mestizo culture in which, nevertheless, they struggle to impose a stronger relationship with the region, a bond of identity with the llanera culture. Mamona, coleo, cockfighting, joropo, dance, legends, myth, the renewed and popularized use of the poncho, among others are currently struggling not to disappear before the thrust of urban or modern life. Folklore is made up of the traditional customs of the people.

=== Gastronomy ===
In Villavicencio the typical dishes are in turn representative of the gastronomy of the Eastern Plains.

==== Carne a la Llanera (mamona or veal) ====

Veal roasted in wood and marinated only with salt and beer. It is served with cassava, potatoes, and plantains; optionally it is accompanied by a stew or sauce based on chili and a beer or lemonade based on panela. In the city, there is a wide variety of restaurants and grills that offer several typical dishes of the region. This dish is also known as Mamona or Ternera a la Llanera, due to the fact that it uses veal, which is slaughtered when the cow is still suckling.
This is the most representative dish of the Llanos region, in such a way that it can be found in other parts of the country. The citizen who is living in Villavicencio is used to cook of meat during festivals and parties. It is common for Villavicences to eat this kind of meat in Joropodromo, at birthday parties, meetings.

==== Arepas and breads ====

Rice arepas, rice bread, cassava bread, corn and corn wrapped, tungos, fish dish, three-phase sancocho, pâté broth, minced soup, pajarilla broth.

==== Rice bread ====

<text>The Anglia knight is a sterling silver trophy commissioned by William III of the Netherlands in 1850 for the Falcon Club, a society that met once a year to compete in horse races, falconry and other sports. The trophy weighs over 700 troy ounces (22 kg, 48 lbs) and is modelled on the statue of Richard I outside the Palace of Westminster, but was intended to represent the Black Prince.

Arguably its most famous use was as the symbol of Anglia Television, the ITV station for the East of England, from launch in 1959 until 1988. Shortly before the station&#x27;s launch, its chairman, Lord Townshend, had spotted the trophy at the Bond Street jewellers, Asprey, and purchased it almost on impulse; Asprey subsequently added the &quot;Anglia&quot; pennon to the lance.

The silver statue was Anglia&#x27;s original ident. At the end, the camera zoomed in on the pennon which showed the station&#x27;s name. An arrangement by Malcolm Sargent, of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Water Music&quot; was played over the film. The logo became so closely identified with the station that when Anglia produced a book to mark its fortieth anniversary in 1999, it was entitled &quot;A Knight On The Box&quot;. With the introduction of colour television on ITV in November 1969 (although not in the Anglia region until October 1970), the ident was remade with constant lighting, and the knight rotating on a turntable – a longer version of the ident was used at the start of the day&#x27;s transmission until the mid 1980s.

On 21 March 1988, the knight was replaced by a new identity. It made brief reappearances in 1999 and 2009 to celebrate Anglia&#x27;s 40th and 50th anniversaries.

The trophy is usually displayed at ITV Anglia reception at Anglia House in Norwich. It was on loan to the Museum of Norwich at the Bridewell until 5 October 2019 as part of an exhibition celebrating life in Norwich in 1959.

The logo for Anglian Home Improvements also depicts a knight on horseback.

<doc id="1090945" wikidata="Q134511" url="?curid=1090945" title="Squalicorax">
<text>Squalicorax, commonly known as the crow shark, is a genus of extinct lamniform shark known to have lived during the Cretaceous period. The genus had a global distribution in the Late Cretaceous epoch. Multiple species within this genus are considered to be wastebasket taxon due to morphological similarities in the teeth.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Squalicorax&quot; is derived from the Latin &quot;squalus&quot; for shark and the Greek κόραξ, &quot;korax&quot; for raven.

==Description==

&quot;Squalicorax&quot; was a medium-sized shark, typically measuring about long. The largest specimen of &quot;S. pristodontus&quot;, SDSM 47683, was signigicantly larger, measuring up to long.

Their bodies were similar to the modern gray reef sharks, but the shape of the teeth is strikingly similar to that of a tiger shark. The teeth are numerous, relatively small, with a curved crown and serrated, up to 2.5 – 3 cm in height. Large numbers of fossil teeth have been found in Europe, North Africa, and North America. Squalicorax is one of three Cretaceous lamniformes to garner serrations along with &quot;Pseudocorax&quot; and &quot;Galeocorax&quot;.

&quot;Squalicorax&quot; was a coastal predator, but also scavenged as evidenced by a &quot;Squalicorax&quot; tooth found embedded in the metatarsal (foot) bone of a terrestrial hadrosaurid dinosaur that most likely died on land and ended up in the water. Other food sources included turtles, mosasaurs, ichthyodectids, and other bony fishes and sea creatures. Tooth marks from this shark have also been found on the bones of &quot;Pteranodon&quot;, but whether the shark actively snatched such large pterosaurs out of the air, attacked them as they dove after prey, or was simply scavenging is not known.

==Description of selected species==

The following are the best studied American species for which relatively complete skeletons are described:
* &quot;Squalicorax falcatus&quot; (Agassiz, 1843) – is a medium-sized shark with a broad snout and relatively small teeth. Its length reached almost 3 m. It lived during the Cenomanian to early Santonian (Campanian). Complete skeletons are known from sediments of the Western Inland Sea of the Cretaceous in Kansas, South Dakota, and Wyoming, all in the USA. The teeth are also found in France, the Czech Republic, Canada, and Morocco. Given the small teeth, this species is considered a hunter of small prey. However, teeth marks on the bones of marine reptiles are evidence that these shark also fed on carrion. The body shape and structure of the trunk placoid scales indicate the ability to swim quickly. A fully articulated 1.9-m long fossil skeleton of &quot;Squalicorax falcatus&quot; has been found in Kansas, evidence of its presence in the Western Interior Seaway.
* &quot;Squalicorax kaupi&quot; (Agassiz, 1843) is from the late Santonian to the late Maastrichtian of North America, New Zealand, Japan, Africa, Europe, Kazakhstan, Jordan. and other places. It was slightly larger than the preceding species, of which it was probably an ancestor.
* &quot;Squalicorax pristodontus&quot; (Agassiz, 1843) is the largest species, exceeding in length. From the size of its largest known teeth, it can be estimated that &quot;S. pristodontus&quot; grew to in length. It lived during the late Campanian to early Maastrichtian of North America, France, the Netherlands, Egypt, Morocco, and Madagascar. The relatively complete remains (vertebrae and fragments of jaws) have been found in marine sediments in North America. It is the species with the largest teeth, these teeth being loosely spaced and relatively very large in comparison with other species. In this genus of sharks, studies have shown no precise correlation between the size of the teeth and the length of the body. They could eat relatively large prey and carrion.
* &quot;Squalicorax volgensis&quot; - the oldest species of the genus, from the Early Cretaceous of the Volga – has been described by L. Glickman &quot;et al.&quot; in 1971. The teeth of this species had virtually no serration. They are known from the Albian to the Turonian Age in Eastern and Western Europe, as well as Texas.

The world&#x27;s largest and most complete semiarticulated fossil of &quot;Squalicorax&quot; was found in 2014 in stores of the Canadian Fossil Discovery Centre in Morden, Manitoba, in Canada, where it is now displayed. It measures more than 3 m in length.

<text>Ngawang Namgyal (; alternate spellings include &quot;Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel;&quot; 1594–1651), known colloquially as &quot;The Bearded Lama&quot;, was a Tibetan Buddhist Drukpa Kagyu school Rinpoche, and the unifier of Bhutan as a nation-state. He was later granted the honorific title Zhabdrung Rinpoche, approximately &quot;at whose feet one submits&quot;. In addition to unifying the various warring fiefdoms for the first time in the 1630s, he also sought to create a distinct Bhutanese cultural identity separate from the Tibetan culture from which it was derived.

==Birth and enthronement at Ralung==
&quot;Zhabdrung&quot; Ngawang Namgyal was born at Ralung () Monastery, Tibet as the son of the Drukpa Kagyu lineage-holder Mipham Tenpa&#x27;i Nyima (, 1567–1619), and Sönam Pelgyi Butri (), daughter of the local king of Kyishö () in Tibet. On his father&#x27;s side, Ngawang Namgyal descended from the family line of Tsangpa Gyare (1161–1211), the founder of the Drukpa Lineage.

In his youth, Ngawang Namgyal was enthroned as the eighteenth Drukpa or throne-holder and &quot;hereditary prince&quot; of the traditional Drukpa seat and estate of Ralung, and recognized there as the immediate reincarnation of the fourth Drukchen, the &quot;Omniscient&quot; Kunkhyen Pema Karpo (, 1527–1592).

His recognition and enthronement at Ralung as the Drukpa incarnation was opposed by Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo, an influential student of Drukpa Pema Karpo who promoted the recognition of a rival candidate—Gyalwang Pagsam Wangpo, an illegitimate son of the Chongje king (Chongje Depa), Ngawang Sönam Dragpa—as the Gyalwang Drukpa incarnation. Lhatsewa and supporters of the Chongje king conducted an enthronement ceremony of Pagsam Wangpo as the incarnation of Künkhyen Pema Karpo and Gyalwang Drukpa at Tashi Thongmen monastery. The Chongje king then persuaded the king of Tsang (or Depa Tsangpa), one the most powerful local kings in Tibet and patron of the rival Karma Kagyu sect, to support the recognition of Pagsam Wangpo as Gyalwang Drukpa and incarnation of Künkhyen Pema Karpo. By 1612, the Tsang king, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal (), had gained control over the Tibetan regions of Ü and Tsang.

For a time, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal continued to live at the main Drukpa seat of Ralung, as—irrespective of who was entitled to be considered as the true incarnation of Kunkhyen Pema Karpo—Ngawang Namgyal was the main Drukpa hereditary lineage–holder and legitimate throne-holder at Ralung Monastery, the traditional seat of the Drukpa Lineage.

==From Tibet to Bhutan==

However, following a misunderstanding Zhabdrung Rinpoche and his party had with an important Karma Kagyu &quot;lama&quot;, Pawo Tsugla Gyatsho (1568–1630), the Tsang Desi demanded that compensation be paid, and that the sacred religious relics of Ralung—such as the Rangjung Kharsapani—should be surrendered to him so they could be given to the rival Gyalwang Drukpa incarnate, Gyalwa Pagsam Wangpo.

The Tsang Desi prepared to send covert armed guards to arrest Zhabdrung Rinpoche and enforce his demands. In 1616, facing arrest and following visions (in which it is said that the chief guardian deities of Bhutan offered him a home), Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal left Tibet to establish a new base in western Bhutan through Gasa Dzongkhag, founding Cheri Monastery at the head of Thimphu valley.

In 1629, he built Simtokha Dzong at the entrance to Thimphu valley; from this &quot;dzong&quot;, he could exert control over traffic between the powerful Paro valley to the west and Trongsa valley to the east.

==Unification of Bhutan==
Zhabdrung Rinpoche consolidated control over western Bhutan, subduing rivals belonging to the Lhapa, a branch of the Drikung Kagyu sect, which had built some of the original &quot;dzong&quot;s in Bhutan, including Punakha Dzong in 1637–1638. The Drukpa Kagyu, the Lhapa Kagyu, and the Nenyingpa had all controlled parts of western Bhutan since the twelfth century. Later, Zhabdrung Rinpoche would conquer and unify all of Bhutan, but would allow the ancient, Nyingma sect to continue in central and eastern Bhutan (today the Nyingmapa comprise approximately thirty percent of Bhutan&#x27;s monks, even though they are privately funded while the Southern Drukpa Kagyu is supported as the established state religion of Bhutan).

In 1627, the first European visitors to Bhutan—the Portuguese Jesuits Estêvão Cacella and João Cabral—found the Zhabdrung to be a compassionate and intelligent host, of high energy and fond of art and writing. In keeping with his position as a high &quot;lama&quot;, he was also meditative, and had just completed a three-year, silent retreat. The Zhabdrung was proud to have the Jesuits as guests of his court, and was reluctant to grant them permission to leave—offering to support their proselytizing efforts with manpower and church-building funds—but they pressed on to Tibet in search of the apostate church said to be isolated in the heart of central Asia (see Nestorian Stele).

==Dual system of government==

The Zhabdrung also established Bhutan&#x27;s distinctive dual system of government under the Tsa Yig legal code, by which control of the country was shared between a spiritual leader (the Je Khenpo) to preside over the religious institutions, and an administrative leader (the Druk Desi) as head of secular affairs, a policy which exists, in modified form, to this day.

==Relations with Ladakh==
Sengge Namgyal, who ruled Ladakh from 1616 to 1623 and 1624 to 1642, was a devotee of the Ralung lineage of the Drukpa school. Like Bhutan, Ladakh then had differences with the new Gaden Photrang government of Tibet established by the fifth Dalai Lama, which attempted to annex Ladakh.

An invitation was sent to Bhutan requesting that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal become the state priest; as the Zhabdrung was occupied confronting an invasion from Tibet and consolidating the new Bhutanese state, he sent Choje Mukzinpa as his representative to the court of Ladakh. Several religious estates were offered to the Bhutanese in present-day Ladakh, Zangskar, and western Tibet (Ngari Korsum [&quot;mga&#x27; ris bskor gsum&quot;]), which was then part of Ladakh. One of them, Stakna Monastery or &quot;Tiger&#x27;s Nose,&quot; established by Choje Mukzinpa, became the main seat of the Southern Drukpa Kagyu tradition in Ladakh; this monastery still preserves artifacts and documents related to Bhutan, some of them said to have been gifted by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.

==Death==
Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal died in 1651, and power effectively passed to the penlops (local governors), instead of to a successor Zhabdrung. In order to forestall a dynastic struggle and a return to warlordism, the governors conspired to keep the death of the Zhabdrung secret for fifty-four years; during this time, they issued orders in his name, explaining that he was on an extended, silent retreat.

The anniversary of the death of the Zhabdrung is nowadays celebrated as a Bhutanese national holiday, falling on the tenth day of the third month of the Bhutanese calendar.

==Change of era==
* 1648 : The new era name was created in response to criticism that &quot;Shōhō&quot; was too closely related to &quot;Shōbō&quot; (焼亡, meaning &quot;death by burning&quot;). The previous era ended and a new one commenced in &quot;Shōhō&quot; 5, on the 5th day of the 2nd month.

The new era name was drawn from the Chinese classic, The I Ching: &quot;At the end happiness, joy of quiet righteousness, answer the world unlimited&quot; (乃終有慶、安貞之吉、応地無疆):

* 1651 (&quot;Keian 4&quot;): Keian Uprising. Plans by well-organized &quot;rōnin&quot; to attack several Tokugawa strongholds simultaneously were timely discovered. The attempt plan to overthrow the Edo Bakufu by Marubashi Chūya and Yui Shōsetsu was thwarted.
* 1652 (&quot;Keian 5, 5th month&quot;): &quot;Nihon Ōdai Ichiran&quot; is first published in Kyoto under the patronage of the &quot;tairō&quot; Sakai Tadakatsu, &quot;daimyō&quot; of the Obama Domain of Wakasa Province.

<text>The Division of Aston is an Australian Federal Electoral Division in the state of Victoria. The division is located in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, coextensive with the City of Knox local government area. The suburbs in the division include Bayswater, Boronia, Ferntree Gully, Knoxfield, Rowville, Scoresby, The Basin, Wantirna and Wantirna South; and parts of Lysterfield, Sassafras and Upper Ferntree Gully. 
==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

The division was created in 1984 and is named after Tilly Aston, a blind writer and teacher who helped found the Library of the Victorian Association of Braille Writers in 1894.

The current for Aston is Mary Doyle of the Australian Labor Party, elected on 1 April 2023 in the 2023 Aston by-election.

A typical &quot;mortgage belt&quot; seat, it was held by the Labor Party until 1990, but was from then until 2023 it was held by the Liberal Party. At the 2022 Australian federal election it was the Liberal Party’s safest seat in metropolitan Melbourne. However, the seat became marginal at that election, with the Liberals experiencing a 11.64% drop in their primary vote and a 7.32% drop in their two-party vote. The very next year, the Australian Labor Party regained the seat from the Liberal Party following the 2023 by-election.

Aston has one of the biggest Chinese-Australian communities in Victoria, with more than 22,500 Chinese residents, or about 14 per cent of the electorate&#x27;s population.

<doc id="1090966" wikidata="Q430726" url="?curid=1090966" title="Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)">
<text>The Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604) was an intermittent conflict between the Habsburg Kingdom of Spain and the Kingdom of England that was never formally declared. It began with England&#x27;s military expedition in 1585 to what was then the Spanish Netherlands under the command of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, in support of the Dutch rebellion against Spanish Habsburg rule.

In large-scale campaigns, the English repelled the Spanish Armada in 1588, while Spain repelled the English Armada. The 2nd Spanish Armada in 1596 and the 3rd Spanish Armada in 1597 likewise ended in failure. The war included much English privateering against Spanish ships, and several widely separated battles. The war dragged on towards the end of the sixteenth century; England and Spain intervened in France in the 1590s and in Ireland from 1601. The campaign in the Netherlands saw a Spanish veteran force defeated by the Anglo-Dutch at the Battle of Nieuwpoort in 1600. This was followed a year later by the costly three-year Siege of Ostend, which Spain eventually seized.

The war was brought to an end when the 4th Spanish Armada was defeated, following which negotiations began, and ended with Treaty of London (1604) between the new kings; Philip III of Spain and king of England, James I. In the treaty, England and Spain restored the status quo ante bellum, agreed to cease their military interventions in the Netherlands and Ireland respectively, and resumed trade; the English ended their high seas privateering and the Spanish recognized James as king.

== Causes ==
In the 1560s, Philip II of Spain was faced with increasing religious disturbances as Protestantism gained adherents in his domains in the Low Countries. As a defender of the Catholic Church, he sought to suppress the rising Protestant movement in his territories, which eventually exploded into open rebellion in 1566. Meanwhile, relations with the regime of Elizabeth I of England continued to deteriorate, following her restoration of royal supremacy over the Church of England through the Act of Supremacy in 1559; this had been first instituted by her father Henry VIII and rescinded by her sister Mary I, Philip&#x27;s wife. The Act was considered by Catholics as a usurpation of papal authority. Calls by leading English Protestants to support the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip increased tensions further as did the Catholic-Protestant disturbances in France, which saw both sides supporting the opposing French factions.

Complicating matters were commercial disputes. The activities of English sailors, begun by Sir John Hawkins in 1562, gained the tacit support of Elizabeth, even though the Spanish government complained that Hawkins&#x27;s trade with their colonies in the West Indies constituted smuggling. A slaving expedition led by Hawkins and Sir Francis Drake was surprised by the Spanish in September 1568, and several ships were captured or sunk at the Battle of San Juan de Ulúa near Veracruz in New Spain. This engagement soured Anglo-Spanish relations, and in the following year the English detained several treasure ships sent by the Spanish to supply their army in the Netherlands. Drake and Hawkins intensified their privateering as a way to break the Spanish monopoly on Atlantic trade. Francis Drake went on a privateering voyage during which he eventually circumnavigated the globe between 1577 and 1580; Spanish colonial ports were plundered and a number of ships were captured, including the treasure galleon . When news of his exploits reached Europe, Elizabeth&#x27;s relations with Philip continued to deteriorate.

Soon after the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580, English support was provided to António, Prior of Crato, who then fought in his struggle with Philip II for the Portuguese throne. Philip in return began to support the Catholic rebellion in Ireland against Elizabeth&#x27;s religious reforms. Both Philip&#x27;s and Elizabeth&#x27;s attempts to support opposing factions were defeated.

In 1584, Philip signed the Treaty of Joinville with the Catholic League of France to defeat the Huguenot forces in the French Wars of Religion. In the Spanish Netherlands, England had secretly supported the side of the Dutch Protestant United Provinces, who were fighting for independence from Spain. In 1584, the Prince of Orange had been assassinated, leaving a sense of alarm as well as a political vacuum. The following year was a further blow to the Dutch with the capture of Antwerp by Spanish forces led by Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma. The Dutch rebels sought help from England, which Elizabeth agreed to as she feared that a Spanish reconquest there would threaten England. The Treaty of Nonsuch was signed as a result: Elizabeth agreed to provide the Dutch with men, horses, and subsidies, but she declined overall sovereignty. In return the Dutch handed over three Cautionary Towns, which were garrisoned by English troops. Philip took this to be an open declaration of war against his rule in the Netherlands.

== War ==
The Anglo-Spanish War broke out in 1585, following the seizure of English merchant ships in Spanish harbors. In response the English privy council immediately authorised a campaign against the Spanish fishing industry in Newfoundland and off the Grand Banks. The campaign was a huge success, and subsequently led to England&#x27;s first sustained activity in the Americas. In August, England joined the Eighty Years&#x27; War on the side of the Dutch Protestant United Provinces, which had declared their independence from Spain. In that same year, the English established their first New World settlement, the short lived Roanoke Colony established by Ralph Lane.

The Queen through Francis Walsingham ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish New World in a kind of preemptive strike. Drake sailed in October to the West Indies. In January 1586 he captured and sacked Santo Domingo, and in the following month did the same at Cartagena de Indias. In May Drake sailed north to raid St. Augustine in Florida, and when he arrived in England in July he became a national hero. In Spain, however, the news was a disaster, and further buoyed the idea of a Spanish invasion of England by King Philip. Thomas Cavendish meanwhile set out with three ships on 21 July 1586 to raid Spanish settlements in South America. Cavendish raided three Spanish settlements and captured or burned thirteen ships. Among these was a rich 600-ton treasure galleon, &quot;Santa Ana&quot;, the biggest treasure haul that ever fell into English hands. Cavendish circumnavigated the globe returning to England on 9 September 1588.

=== Dutch Revolt (1585–1587) ===

Robert Dudley, The Earl of Leicester was sent to the United Provinces in 1585 with a dignitary party and took the offered governorship of the United Provinces. This, however, was met with fury from Elizabeth, who had expressed no desire for any sovereignty over the Dutch. An English mercenary army had been present since the beginning of the war and was then under the command of veteran Sir John Norreys. They combined forces but were undermanned and under-financed, and faced one of the most powerful armies in Europe led by the famed Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma.

During the siege of Grave the following year, Dudley attempted its relief, but the Dutch garrison commander Hadewij van Hemert surrendered the town to the Spanish. Dudley was furious on hearing of Grave&#x27;s sudden loss and had van Hemert executed, which shocked the Dutch. The English force then had some successes, taking Axel in July and Doesburg the following month. Dudley&#x27;s poor diplomacy with the Dutch, however, made matters worse. His political base weakened and so too did the military situation. Outside Zutphen an English force was defeated and notable poet Philip Sidney mortally wounded, which was a huge blow to English morale. Zutphen itself and Deventer were betrayed by Catholic turncoats William Stanley and Rowland York, which further damaged Leicester&#x27;s reputation. Finally Sluis with a largely English garrison was besieged and taken by the Duke of Parma in June 1587, after the Dutch refused to help in the relief. This resulted in mutual recriminations between Leicester and the States.

Leicester soon realised how dire his situation was and asked to be recalled. He resigned his post as governorhis tenure had been a military and political failure, and as a result, he was financially ruined. After Leicester&#x27;s departure, the Dutch elected the Prince of Orange&#x27;s son Count Maurice of Nassau as the stadtholder and governor. At the same time Peregrine Bertie took over English forces in the Netherlands.

=== Spanish Armada ===

On 8 February 1587, the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots outraged Catholics in Europe. In retaliation for the execution of Mary, Philip vowed to invade England to place a Catholic monarch on its throne. In April 1587 Philip&#x27;s preparations suffered a setback when Francis Drake burned 37 Spanish ships in the harbour of Cádiz, and as a result the invasion of England had to be postponed for over a year.

On 29 July, Philip obtained Papal authority to overthrow Elizabeth, who had been excommunicated by Pope Pius V, and place whomever he chose on the throne of England. He assembled a fleet of about 130 ships, containing 8,050 sailors, 18,973 soldiers, and 2,088 rowers. To finance this endeavour, Pope Sixtus V had permitted Philip to collect crusade taxes. Sixtus had promised a further subsidy to the Spanish should they reach English soil.

On 28 May 1588, the Armada, under the command of the Duke of Medina Sidonia, set sail for the Netherlands, where it was to pick up additional troops for the invasion of England. As the armada sailed through the English Channel, the English navy, led by Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, and Francis Drake, fought a battle of attrition with the Spanish from Plymouth to Portland and then to the Solent, preventing them from securing any English harbours. The Spanish were forced to withdraw to Calais. While the Spanish were at anchor there in a crescent-shaped defensive formation, the English used fireships to break the formation and scatter the Spanish ships. In the subsequent Battle of Gravelines the English navy attacked the Armada and forced it to sail northward in more dangerous stormy waters on the long way home. As they sailed around Scotland, the Armada suffered severe damage and loss of life from stormy weather. As they approached the West coast of Ireland more damaging stormy conditions forced ships ashore while others were wrecked. Disease took a heavy toll as the fleet finally limped back to port.

Philip&#x27;s invasion plans had miscarried partly because of unfortunate weather and his own mismanagement, and partly because the opportunistic defensive naval efforts of the English and their Dutch allies prevailed. The failure of the Armada provided valuable seafaring experience for English oceanic mariners. While the English were able to persist in their privateering against the Spanish and continue sending troops to assist Philip II&#x27;s enemies in the Netherlands and France, these efforts brought few tangible rewards. One of the most important effects of the event was that the Armada&#x27;s failure was seen as a sign that God supported the Protestant Reformation in England. One of the medals struck to celebrate the English victory bore the Latin/Hebrew inscription (literally: &quot;Yahweh blew and they were scattered&quot;; traditionally translated more freely as: &quot;He blew with His winds, and they were scattered&quot;).

=== English Armada ===
An English counter armada under the command of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norris was prepared in 1589 with three tasks:
* Destroy the battered Spanish Atlantic fleet, which was being repaired in Santander, A Coruña, and San Sebastián in northern Spain.
* Make a landing at Lisbon, Portugal and raise a revolt there against King Philip II (Philip I of Portugal) installing the pretender Dom António, Prior of Crato to the Portuguese throne.
* Take the Azores if possible so as to establish a permanent base and capture the incoming Spanish treasure fleet.
Because this mission was floated as a joint stock company, Drake had investors to satisfy, so, rather than adhere to the Queen&#x27;s orders, he bypassed Santander in favor of seeking plunder, booty and financial rewards. He started by making a surprise landing at Coruña on 4 May where the lower town was captured and plundered, and a number of merchant ships were seized. Norris then won a modest victory over a Spanish relief militia force at Puente del Burgo. When the English pressed the attack on the citadel, however, they were repulsed with heavy casualties. In addition, a number of English ships were captured by Spanish naval forces.

Two-weeks later, having failed to capture Coruña, the English departed and sailed towards Lisbon, landing on 26 May, but owing to poor organisation (they had very few siege guns), lack of co-ordination and starvation, the invading force also failed to take Lisbon. The expected uprising by the Portuguese loyal to Crato never materialized. With Portuguese and Spanish reinforcements arriving, the English were forced to retreat; they sailed north – tossing the dead overboard by the hundred along the way – where Drake sacked and burned Vigo. Young William Fenner, who had come from England with 17 supply ships commanded by Captain Cross, was separated from the fleet after a storm and found himself heading toward the archipelago of Madeira, ultimately anchoring in Porto Santo where, the next day, seven more English vessels joined him. They took the island and resupplied themselves over the next two days. Unable to find the rest of the fleet, they set sail for England. Drake attempted to sail towards the Azores, but could not tack against the prevailing wind. In the face of increasing sickness and deaths, he abandoned the venture and limped back to Plymouth with Captain Diego de Aramburu&#x27;s flotilla of zabras harassing him nearly the entire way.

None of the objectives were achieved and the opportunity to strike a decisive blow against the weakened Spanish navy was lost. The expedition depleted the financial resources of England&#x27;s treasury, which had been carefully restored during the long reign of Elizabeth I, and its failure was so embarrassing that, even today, England barely acknowledges it ever happened. Through this lost opportunity, Philip was able to revive his navy the very next year, sending 37 ships with 6,420 men to Brittany where they established a base of operations on the Blavet river. The English and Dutch ultimately failed to disrupt the various fleets of the Indies despite the great number of military personnel mobilized every year. Thus, Spain remained the predominant power in Europe for several decades.

=== Dutch Revolt (1588–1598) ===
Soon after the defeat of the Armada, the Duke of Parma&#x27;s force stood down from the invasion. In the autumn Parma moved his force North towards Bergen op Zoom and then attempted to besiege the English-held town with a substantial force. The English in a ruse however managed to repel the Spanish and forced Parma&#x27;s retreat with heavy losses which boosted both Dutch and English morale. The following year Bertie, under orders from Elizabeth I, left for France with a force to help the Protestants in their fight against the Catholic League. Sir Francis Vere assumed command of English forces thereaftera position he retained during fifteen campaigns, with almost unbroken success.

In 1590 an Anglo-Dutch force under Maurice and Vere respectively launched a campaign with the aim of taking Breda. In a remarkable feat, a small assault force hid in a peat barge before a successful surprise assault that captured the city. With Spanish forces in France supporting the Catholic League as well as in the Low Countries, Maurice was able to take advantage, and thus started a gradual reconquest of the Netherlands, which became known by the Dutch as the &quot;Ten Glorious Years&quot;. Soon after Breda the Anglo-Dutch retook Zutphen and Deventer which restored English prestige after their earlier betrayals. After defeating the Spanish under the Duke of Parma at Knodsenberg in 1591 a new confidence in the army took shape. English troops by this time composed nearly half of the Dutch army. The reconquest continued with Hulst, Nijmegen, Geertruidenberg, Steenwijk, and Coevorden all being taken within the next two years. In 1593 a Spanish attempt led by Francisco Verdugo to recapture Coevorden ended in failure when the Anglo-Dutch under Maurice and Vere relieved the place during the spring of 1594. Finally, the capture of Groningen in the summer of 1594 resulted in the Spanish army being forced out of the northern provinces which led to the complete restoration of the seven provinces.

After these successes, Elizabeth could view the high confidence in the army and renewed the treaty with the States in 1595. English troops having been given high praise by the Dutch were kept at around 4,000 men. They were to be paid for by the States and the Queen would also be repaid on the Crown&#x27;s expenses in instalments until a conclusion of peace was made.

In 1595, Maurice&#x27;s campaign was resumed to retake the cities of the Twente region from the Spanish. This was delayed after Huy was besieged in March but Maurice was unable to prevent its fall. When Maurice did go on the offensive an attempt to take Grol in July ended in failure when a Spanish force under 90-year-old veteran Cristóbal de Mondragón relieved the city. Maurice then tried to make an attempt on the city of Rheinberg in September but Mondragon defeated this move at the Battle of the Lippe. Maurice was then forced to cancel further planned offensives as the bulk of his English and Scots troops were withdrawn to take part in the attack on Cadiz. Under their new commander, the Archduke of Austria, the Spanish took advantage of this lull and recaptured Hulst the following year which led to a prolonged stalemate in the campaign and delayed the reconquest.

By 1597, Spanish bankruptcy and the war in France gave the Anglo-Dutch an advantage. At the Battle of Turnhout a Spanish force was surprised and routed; Vere and the Earl of Leicester particularly distinguished themselves. With the Spanish distracted by the siege of Amiens in France, Maurice launched an offensive in the summer. This time both Rhienberg and Greonlo were taken by the Dutch. This was followed by the capture of Bredevoort, Enschede, Ootsmarsum, Oldenzaal, and finally Lingen by the end of the year. The offensive&#x27;s success meant that most of the seven northern provinces of the Netherlands had been recaptured by the Dutch Republic and a significant barrier had been created along the Rhine river.

===Naval war and privateering===
In November, 1588, Philip II ordered the construction of 21 new galleons, all of them large. 12 of them were built in Cantabrian ports and stood out due to their number and the names they received; they were known as &quot;the twelve apostles&quot;. In addition, 6 were made in Portugal, 2 in Gibraltar and 1 in Vinaroz; all of them entered service in a very short space of time. Philip then established a naval base in Brittany which threatened England and allowed for a sophisticated convoy system and improved intelligence network which frustrated English naval attempts on the Spanish treasure fleet during the 1590s. This was best demonstrated by the repulse of the squadron that was led by Effingham in 1591 near the Azores, who had intended to ambush the treasure fleet. It was in this battle that the Spanish captured the English flagship, , after a stubborn resistance by its captain, Sir Richard Grenville. Throughout the 1590s, enormous convoy escorts enabled the Spanish to ship three times as much silver as in the previous decade.

English merchant privateers or corsairs known as Elizabeth&#x27;s &quot;Sea Dogs&quot; enjoyed more qualified success, however. In the three years after the Spanish Armada was defeated, more than 300 prizes were taken from the Spanish with a declared total value of well over £400,000. English courtiers provided money for their own expeditions as well as others, and even Elizabeth herself would make investments. The Earl of Cumberland made a number of expeditions and a few did yield profithis first being the Azores Voyage in 1589. Others failed however due to bad weather and his 1591 voyage ended in defeat with Spanish galleys off Berlengas. Cumberland with Sir Walter Raleigh and Martin Frobisher combined financial strength and force that led to the most successful English naval expedition of the war. Off Flores island in 1592, the English fleet captured a large Portuguese carrack, the , and outwitted a Spanish fleet led by Alonso de Bazán. The expedition&#x27;s reward equalled nearly half the size of the Kingdom of England&#x27;s royal annual revenue and yielded Elizabeth a 20-fold return on her investment. These riches gave the English an excited enthusiasm to engage in this opulent commerce. Raleigh himself in 1595 went on an expedition to explore the Orinoco river in an attempt to find the mythical city of El Dorado; in the process the English plundered the Spanish settlement of Trinidad. Raleigh would, however, exaggerate the wealth found there upon his return to England. Supporting Raleigh with his expedition was another led by Amyas Preston and George Somers known as the Preston Somers expedition to South America, notable for a daring overland assault that saw the capture of Caracas.

Many of the expeditions were financed by famed London merchants, the most notable of these being John Watts. An expedition Watts financed to Portuguese Brazil led by James Lancaster saw the capture and plunder of Recife and Olindawhich was highly profitable for both. In response to English privateering against their merchantmen, the Spanish monarchy struck back with the &quot;Dunkirkers&quot; devastating English shipping and fishing in the largely undefended seas around England.

By far the most successful English privateer was Christopher Newport, who was backed financially by Watts. Newport set out in 1590 to raid the Spanish West Indies and in the ensuing fight saw the defeat of an armed Spanish convoy but Newport lost his right arm in the process. Despite this Newport continued the venturesthe blockade of Western Cuba in 1591 was the most successful English privateering venture made during the war, and then followed that with another successful expedition to Hispaniola and the Bay of Honduras the following year. Both Drake and Hawkins died of disease on the later 1595–96 expedition against Puerto Rico, Panama, and other targets in the Spanish Main, a severe setback in which the English suffered heavy losses in soldiers and ships despite a number of minor military victories.
In August 1595, a Spanish naval force from Brittany led by Carlos de Amésquita landed in Cornwall, raiding and burning Penzance and several nearby villages.

During the summer of 1596, an Anglo-Dutch expedition under Elizabeth&#x27;s young favourite, the Earl of Essex, sacked Cádiz, causing significant loss to the Spanish fleet, leaving the city in ruins and delaying a projected descent on England. The allies were unable to capture the treasure, as the Spanish commander had time in order to torch the treasure ships in port, sending the treasure to the bottom of the harbour, from where it was later recovered. Despite its failure to capture the treasure fleet, the sack of Cádiz was celebrated as a national triumph comparable to the victory over the Spanish Armada, and for a time Essex&#x27;s prestige rivalled Elizabeth&#x27;s own.

Instead of controlling and taxing its subjects, the English crown competed with them for private profit; it failed to succeed at this, as the great naval expeditions were on the whole unprofitable. The last of the great English naval expeditions took place in 1597, led by the Earl of Essex, known as the Islands Voyage. The objective was to destroy the Spanish fleet and intercept a treasure fleet in the Azores. Neither was achieved and the expedition ended in costly failure, and Essex on his return was scolded by the Queen for not protecting the English coast.

While the war became a great drain on the English treasury, it proved to be profitable for a number of English privateers. In its final years, English privateering continued despite the strengthening of Spanish navy convoys – Cumberland&#x27;s last expedition in 1598 to the Caribbean led to the capture of San Juan, and had succeeded where Drake had failed. Newport struck at Tobasco in 1599 while William Parker successfully raided Portobello in 1601. In 1603 Christopher Cleeve struck at Santiago de Cuba and in the last raid of the war Newport plundered Puerto Caballos. Finally, just days before the signing of the peace treaty in August 1604, future admiral Antonio de Oquendo defeated and captured an English privateer in the Gulf of Cádiz.

By the end of the war, English privateering had devastated the Spanish private merchant marine. The most famous pirates lauded by English literature and propaganda tended to attack fishing vessels or boats of small value to the Spanish crown. Spanish prizes though were taken at an attritional rate; nearly 1,000 were captured by the war&#x27;s end, and there was on average a declared value of approximately £100,000–£200,000 for every year of the war.&lt;ref name =&quot;Hornsby/Hermann17&quot;&gt;Hornsby &amp; Hermann p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, for every Spanish prize brought back, another was either burned or scuttled, and the presence of so many English corsairs deterred some Spanish merchantmen from putting to sea. This resulted in much Spanish and Portuguese commerce being carried on Dutch and English ships, which in itself created competition. Nevertheless, throughout the war Spain&#x27;s important treasure fleets were kept safe by their convoy system.

===Dutch Revolt (1598–1604)===
In 1598, the Spanish under Francisco Mendoza retook Rheinberg and Meurs in a campaign known as the &quot;Spanish winter of 1598–99&quot;. Mendoza then attempted to take Bommelerwaard island but the Dutch and English under Maurice thwarted the attempt and defeated him at Zaltbommel. Mendoza retreated from the area and the defeat resulted in chaos in the Spanish armymutinies took place and many deserted. The following year the Dutch senate led by Johan van Oldenbarneveldt saw the chaos in the Spanish army and decided the time was ripe for a focal point of the war to be concentrated in Catholic Flanders. Despite a bitter dispute between Maurice and van Oldenbarneveldt, the Dutch and a sizeable contingent of the English Army under Francis Vere reluctantly agreed. They used Ostend (still in Dutch hands) as a base to invade Flanders. Their aim was to conquer the privateer stronghold city of Dunkirk. In 1600 they advanced toward Dunkirk and the Anglo-Dutch inflicted a rare defeat in a pitched battle on the tercio-led Spanish army at the Battle of Nieuwpoort in which the English played a major part. Dunkirk was never attempted however as disputes in the Dutch command meant that taking Spanish-occupied cities in the rest of the Republic took priority. Maurice&#x27;s force thus withdrew leaving Vere to command Ostend in the face of an imminent Spanish siege.

With the siege of Ostend underway, Maurice then went on the offensive on the Rhine frontier in the summer of 1600. Rheinberg and Meurs were thus retaken from the Spanish yet again, although an attempt on s&#x27;Hertogenbosch failed during the winter months. At Ostend in January 1602 after being reinforced, Vere faced a huge Spanish frontal assault organised by the Archduke Albert and in bitter fighting this was repelled with heavy losses. Vere left the city soon after and joined Maurice in the field, while Albert, who drew much criticism from army commanders for his tactics, was replaced by the talented Ambrogio Spinola. The siege dragged on for another two years as the Spanish attempted to take Ostend&#x27;s strongpoints in a costly war of attrition. Around the same time Maurice continued his campaign, Grave was retaken but Vere was severely wounded during the siege. An attempt by the Dutch and English to relieve Ostend took place in mid-1604 but the inland of port of Sluis was besieged and captured instead. Soon afterwards the Ostend garrison finally surrendered, after a siege of nearly four years and costing thousands of lives; for the Spanish, it was a pyrrhic victory.

===France===

Normandy added a new front in the war and the threat of another invasion attempt across the channel. In 1590, the Spanish landed a considerable force in Brittany to assist the French Catholic League, expelling the English and Huguenot forces from much of the area. Henry IV&#x27;s conversion to Catholicism in 1593 won him widespread French support for his claim to the throne, particularly in Paris (where he was crowned the following year), a city that he had unsuccessfully besieged in 1590. In 1594 Anglo-French forces were able to end Spanish hopes of using the large port of Brest as a launching point for an invasion of England by capturing Fort Crozon.

The French Wars of Religion turned increasingly against the hardliners of the French Catholic League. With the signing of the Triple Alliance in 1596 between France, England, and the Dutch, Elizabeth sent a further 2,000 troops to France after the Spanish took Calais. In September 1597 Anglo-French forces under Henry retook Amiens, just six months after the Spanish took the city, bringing to a halt a string of Spanish victories. In fact, the first tentative talks on peace between the French and Spanish crowns had already begun before the battle and the League hardliners were already losing popular support throughout France to a resurgent Henry after his conversion to Roman Catholicism which was bolstered by his military successes. In addition, Spanish finances were at breaking point because of fighting wars in France, the Netherlands, and against England. Therefore, a deeply ill Philip decided to end his support for the League and to finally recognize the legitimacy of Henry&#x27;s accession to the French throne. Without Spanish support, the last League hardliners were quickly defeated. In May 1598, the two kings signed the Peace of Vervins ending the last of the religious civil wars and the Spanish intervention with it.

===Ireland===

In 1594, the Nine Years&#x27; War in Ireland had begun, when Ulster lords Hugh O&#x27;Neill and Red Hugh O&#x27;Donnell rose up against English rule with fitful Spanish support, mirroring the English support of the Dutch rebellion. While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering, and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but with less enthusiasm.

At the end of 1601, the Spanish sent a final armada, this time an expedition intended to land troops in Ireland to assist the rebels. Only half the fleet arrived because of a storm that scattered it and that which did arrive landed far from Irish rebel forces. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. The besieged Spanish accepted the proposed terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died.

===End of the war and treaty===

Philip II died in 1598 - the new King of Spain Philip III carried on the war but in a less determined manner. The Spanish court was now dominated by the Duke of Lerma whose general policy was one of disengagement. England and the Dutch Republic too were war-weary and both sides felt the need for peace. In peace negotiations at Boulogne in 1600, Spanish demands were ultimately rejected by the English and Dutch. Nevertheless, diplomatic routes remained open between the Archduke of Austria and his wife Infanta Isabella (Philip&#x27;s sister) who differed in their policies to Philip&#x27;s. Philip wanted to preserve the hegemony of the Spanish empire, whilst the Archduke and Isabella sought peace and friendly relations. Following the defeat in Ireland, the Duke of Lerma put pressure on Philip III to try extricate Spain from the war, and so a cut back in foreign expenditure was necessary.

In 1602, the English navy under Richard Leveson conducted a blockade of Spain, the first of its kind. Off Portugal, they sailed into Sesimbra bay where a fleet of eight Spanish galleys under Federico Spinola (brother of Ambrogio) and Álvaro de Bazán were present. Spinola had already established his base at Sluis in Flanders and was gathering more with an intent on a potential strike against England. In June 1602 Leveson defeated the Spanish which resulted in two galleys sunk and the capture of a rich Portuguese carrack. Months later in the English channel Spinola&#x27;s fleet gathered more galleys and sailed through the English channel once more but was defeated again by an Anglo-Dutch naval squadron off the Dover straits. Spinola&#x27;s remaining galleys eventually reached Sluis. The result of this action forced the Spanish to cease further naval operations against England for the remainder of the war. Spain&#x27;s priority was no longer an invasion of England, but the fall of Ostend.

After the death of Elizabeth in 1603, James I, became the new king of England. He was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom. James sought an end to the long and draining conflict, which Philip III also wanted. James ordered an end to further privateering, and in return Philip sent a Spanish-Flemish Commission headed by Juan de Tassis to London to explore the possibilities of ending the war.

After nearly a year of negotiations, peace was signed between the nations on 28 August 1604, place at Somerset House in Westminster. The sieges of Ostend and Sluis were allowed to continue until the end of those respective campaigns.

== Aftermath ==
The treaty restored the status quo ante bellum; the terms were favourable both to Spain and England. For Spain the treaty secured her position as a leading power in the world. Spain&#x27;s upgrading of the convoy system had allowed it to defend its treasure fleets and retain its New World colonies. English support for the Dutch rebellion against the Spanish king, the original cause of the war, ceased. The Spanish could then concentrate their efforts on the Dutch, in the hopes of bringing them to their knees. A complete abandonment of the Dutch cause, however, was not promised in the treaty. The English-held cautionary towns in Holland on the other hand were not surrendered despite Spanish demands. The sieges of Ostend and Sluis were allowed to continue until the end of those respective campaigns. The Dutch by 1607 had in fact prevailed; the Spanish did not deliver the knockout blow that they had sought, and the Twelve Years&#x27; Truce effectively recognized the independence of the Republic.

For England the treaty was a diplomatic triumph as well as an economic necessity. At the same time, the treaty was highly unpopular with the English public, many of whom considered it a humiliating peace. Many felt that James had abandoned England&#x27;s ally, the Netherlands, in order to appease the Spanish crown and this damaged James&#x27;s popularity. The treaty, however, made sure the Protestant reformation there had been protected, and James and his ministers refused the Spanish demand for Catholic toleration in England. After the defeat at Kinsale in 1602, the Treaty of Mellifont was concluded the following year between James I and the Irish rebels. In the subsequent London treaty Spain pledged not to support the rebels.

The treaty was well received in Spain. Large public celebrations were held at Valladolid, the Spanish capital, where the treaty was ratified in June 1605, in the presence of a large English ambassadorial delegation led by Lord Admiral Charles Howard. Nevertheless, some members of the Catholic clergy criticized Philip III&#x27;s willingness to sign a treaty with a &quot;heretical power&quot;.

The provisions of the treaty authorised merchants and warships of both nations to operate from each other&#x27;s respective ports. English trade with the Spanish Netherlands (notably the city of Antwerp) and the Iberian peninsula was resumed. Spanish warships and privateers were able to use English ports as naval bases to attack Dutch shipping or to ferry troops to Flanders.

The war had diverted Tudor colonial efforts, but the English who had invested in privateering expeditions during the war garnered enormous windfall profits, leaving them well placed to finance new ventures. As a result, the London Company was able to establish a settlement in Virginia in 1607. The establishment of the East India Company in 1600 was significant for the growth of England (and later Great Britain) as a colonial power. A factory was established at Banten, Java, in 1603 while the Company had successfully and profitably breached the Spanish and Portuguese monopoly. While the incipient illegal trade with the Spanish colonies was brought to an end, there was deadlock over English demands for the right to trade in the East and West Indies, which Spain adamantly opposed. Eventually the complications resulted in the treaty avoiding any mention of the matter.

For Spain there was hope that England would eventually secure tolerance for Catholics but the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 destroyed any possibility of this. The resulting anti-Catholic backlash following the discovery of the plot put to rest Protestant fears that a peace with Spain would ultimately mean an invasion by Jesuits and Catholic sympathisers, as the Elizabethan recusancy laws were rigidly enforced by Parliament.

England and Spain remained at peace until 1625.

<text>Matilda Ann Aston (11 December 1873 – 1 November 1947), better known as Tilly Aston, was a blind Australian writer and teacher, who founded the Victorian Association of Braille Writers, and later went on to establish the Association for the Advancement of the Blind, with herself as secretary. She is remembered for her achievements in promoting the rights of vision-impaired people.

==Life==
Tilly was born in the town of Carisbrook, Victoria in 1873, the youngest of eight children born to Edward Aston, a bootmaker, and his wife, Ann. Vision-impaired from birth, she was totally blind by the age of 7. Her father died in 1881. Six months later, through a chance meeting, she met Thomas James, a miner who had lost his sight in an industrial accident and who had become an itinerant blind missionary. He taught her to read braille and, soon after, the Rev. W. Moss, who visited Carisbrook with the choir of the Victorian Asylum and School for the Blind, persuaded her to attend the school in St Kilda, Melbourne, to further her education. She enrolled as a boarder on 29 June 1882. After successfully matriculating at the age of 16, Tilly became the first blind Australian to go to a university, enrolling for an arts degree from University of Melbourne. However, due to the lack of braille text books and &quot;nervous prostration&quot;, she was forced to discontinue her studies in the middle of her second year. While convalescent, she tried to earn her living as a music teacher, and realised the plight of blind people.

After leaving school, she lived with her mother and a brother in Melbourne until about 1913, when her mother died and her brother married. She then moved to a house of her own in Windsor, where she had a house-keeper-companion. She died there of cancer on 1 November 1947, and was buried at St Kilda Cemetery.

The Federal electorate Division of Aston in Melbourne&#x27;s eastern suburbs and a street in the Canberra suburb Cook are named in her honour. A cairn was erected in her honour, a year after her death, by Carisbrook Primary School and the Midlands Historical Society, and there is a sculpture in her honour in Kings Domain, Melbourne.

==Career==

With the assistance of friends and the Australian Natives&#x27; Association, Aston established the &quot;Victorian Association of Braille Writers&quot; in 1894. This organisation would eventually become the &quot;Victorian Braille Library&quot;. In 1895 a meeting called by Tilly Aston founded the &quot;Association for the Advancement of the Blind&quot; (now Vision Australia) to fight for greater independence, social change and new laws for blind people. They quickly won voting rights for blind people; free postage for Braille material in 1899 (a world first for Australia); and transport concessions for the blind.

In 1913 Tilly Aston did teaching training and become head of the Victorian Education Department&#x27;s &quot;School for the Blind&quot;, the first blind woman to do so. Her appointment was not without criticism from staff and officials of the Royal Victorian Institute for the Blind because of her disability and she was required to &quot;sever her connexion with the blind societies she had helped to found&quot;. She proved a competent educator and administrator, but her school years were not happy ones. She retired in 1925, following a minor stroke, and received a small allowance in lieu of superannuation.

==Writing career==

Aston was also a prolific writer, particularly of poetry and prose sketches, though her writing was often interrupted by her teaching and other activities. In 1904, she won the Prahran City Council&#x27;s competition for an original story. &quot;The Woolinappers, or Some Tales from the By-ways of Methodism&quot; was published in 1905, and several books followed after that. Her writings were also serialised in Victorian newspapers and, for 12 years, she edited and contributed to a braille magazine for Chinese mission schools, &quot;A Book of Opals&quot;.

She had 8 volumes of verse published in Melbourne between 1901 and 1940, corresponded around the world using the Esperanto language, and wrote her memoirs which were published in 1946. She believed her book of verse, &quot;The Inner Garden&quot;, contained her best work.

<doc id="1090969" wikidata="Q7444638" url="?curid=1090969" title="Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia">
<text>Section 51 of the Constitution of Australia enumerates the legislative powers granted to the Parliament of Australia by the Australian States at Federation. Each subsection, or &#x27;head of power&#x27;, provides a topic under which the parliament is empowered to make laws. There are other sections in the constitution that enable the parliament to enact laws, although the scope of those other sections are generally limited in comparison with section 51.

==The powers==
The powers enumerated within section 51 are reflective in their topics of being those that Australia&#x27;s colonies perceived as being best within the purview of a national government. The full list of powers is available on the Australian Parliament&#x27;s website. 

In modern times, the most prominent heads of power for Commonwealth legislative purposes are arguably: (i) the interstate trade and commerce power, (ii) the taxation power, (xx) the corporations power, and (xxix) the external affairs power. This is because these sections have been interpreted by the High Court as wide in scope, and so are extensively relied upon by the Commonwealth when attempting legislative enactment. The wide scope of these sections have at times been legally controversial in Australia; most notably in the &quot;Workchoices&quot; and &quot;Tasmanian dams&quot; cases, which expanded the understood applicable scope of the corporations power, and external affairs power, respectively. 

Other particularly notable powers in history have been the (vi) defence power, (see: &quot;Australian Communist Party v Commonwealth),&quot; the (xix) naturalisation and aliens power, the (xxxi) &#x27;just terms&#x27; property acquisition power, the (xxvi) power to make special laws in relation to peoples of a particular race, and the s51(xxiii) &amp; (xxiiiA) power to provide social services (notable in part for having been implemented in 1946 via referendum) 

With some exceptions, the remainder of the powers in s51 pertain to the standardization of commerce across Australia, empowering the federal government to enact laws in relation to metrics, statistics, finance, interstate commercial disputes, and other related issues. 

Additionally, two subsections provide for the referral of matters to the Australian Parliament by Australia&#x27;s State Governments. Specifically, (xxxvii) allows State Parliaments to refer matters within their competence to the commonwealth, and (xxxviii) allows state parliaments to refer any matter that the UK Parliament or Federal Council of Australasia could legislate on their behalf at the establishment of the Commonwealth. 

The incidental power (xxxix) allows the Commonwealth to act on matters &#x27;incidental&#x27; any power of the constitution. Most notably this includes section 61 of the constitution, which vests the Australian Government with Executive Power. As a result, it is one of the most important sections in practice.

==Interpretive history==

The High Court&#x27;s approach to section 51 has changed over time. Initially, the court adopted the &#x27;Reserved Powers&#x27; doctrine, an interpretive view that the Australian States had implicitly retained competence in core areas, which were unable to be displaced by the Commonwealth even through reliance upon the powers enumerated in s51.

This doctrine was famously, and emphatically, rejected by the Isaacs court in the &quot;Engineers&#x27; Case.&quot; Following this case, the reserved powers doctrine was abandoned; although it has notably reappeared a number of times in argument by State governments when arguing against Commonwealth legislation.

Since federation the enumerated powers in section 51 have tended overall to have expanded in scope. In particular, the Corporations and external affairs powers are notable for having a significantly larger breadth in modern times than at federation.

When interpreting whether a particular act of parliament is within the scope, or is incidental to an enumerated power; the dominant legal test applied by the court has been whether the law in question is a reasonable and appropriate means of furthering an object or purpose in the power.

==Tied grants==

In practice, section 51 is not a strong limit on federal involvement in Australia&#x27;s political life. Section 96 of the Australian Constitution grants the power to grant money to any State, &quot;on such terms and conditions as the Parliament thinks fit.&quot; In effect, the Commonwealth can make grants subject to States implementing particular policies in their fields of legislative responsibility. Such grants, known as tied grants (since they are tied to a particular purpose), have been used to give the federal parliament influence over state policy matters such as public hospitals and schools.

Section 96 does not compel a state to accept a grant, so constitutionally a state may refuse a grant and not implement any policy conditions. However, since a uniform federal system of income tax was introduced in 1942 (under s51(ii)) a vertical fiscal imbalance has arisen and the Commonwealth Parliament has had a vastly larger budget. It also has control over state borrowings (under subsection iv). This has meant that the Parliament&#x27;s powers have effectively been extended beyond the constraints of section 51 and other explicit grants of legislative power (e.g. section 52 and section 90).

<text>Isaiah Rider Jr., nicknamed J.R. (born March 12, 1971), is an American former professional basketball player who played nine seasons in the NBA.

Rider was born in Oakland, California, and was raised in nearby Alameda. He starred in both baseball and basketball at Encinal High School before going on to a college career with the University of Nevada, Las Vegas (UNLV), and a professional career in the National Basketball Association.

==Early life and college career==
The 6&#x27;5&quot; (1.96 m) Rider was a prep star at Encinal High School in Alameda, California (just outside Oakland) and was one of the top rated players in the state. Rider attended two junior colleges, Allen County Community College in Iola, Kansas, where he averaged just over 30 points per game; and Antelope Valley College in Lancaster, California (33 points per game), before finding a home at UNLV.

During the 1991–1992 season, Rider led the Runnin&#x27; Rebels to a 26–2 record (18–0 in conference) and a number 7 ranking in the final Associated Press regular season poll while averaging over 21 points per game, but wasn&#x27;t seen on national television because UNLV was serving an NCAA-imposed punishment that stemmed from previous infractions. (In a &quot;plea bargain&quot; of sorts, UNLV was allowed to defend its NCAA title the previous year – they lost to Duke in the Final Four. In exchange, the Rebels were barred from postseason play and national television for the 1991–92 season.) He finally got the nation&#x27;s eyes to watch him in his senior year, where he averaged 29.1 points per game (2nd in the country behind University of Texas-Pan American&#x27;s Greg Guy), was named the Big West Conference Player of the Year and garnered 2nd-Team All-American honors. UNLV finished 21-8 (13–5 in Big West Conference), lost the regular season conference title to New Mexico State and failed to make the NCAA&#x27;s 64-team Tournament field. The Rebels did earn a spot in the National Invitation Tournament, but Rider was suspended for the NIT due to academic issues surrounding allegations that he had someone cheating for him on some of his college classwork. Without their star player on the court, the Runnin&#x27; Rebels were knocked out of the NIT in the 1st round 90–73 to Southern California.

==Professional career==

=== Minnesota Timberwolves (1993–1996) ===
Rider was chosen with the 5th overall pick of the 1993 NBA draft by the Minnesota Timberwolves. Rider started his NBA career strong, finishing the 1993–94 season as a member of the NBA&#x27;s All-Rookie First Team. He won the 1994 NBA Slam Dunk Contest (he brashly predicted that he would win on draft day) with a dunk that he called &quot;The East Bay Funk Dunk.&quot;

Rider also became famous for a miraculous shot made in a game on December 22, 1994, against the Sacramento Kings. Losing control of the ball with it nearly going out of bounds, Rider reached out and threw the ball blindly over his shoulder to keep it in play, and the ball went through the hoop as a three-point basket, a play that one announcer exclaimed as the &quot;Play of the decade.&quot;

While Rider averaged 19 points per game in his three years with the Timberwolves, his play slipped after his rookie season. He also began a pattern of off-court misbehavior. He was found to be insubordinate towards Timberwolves management, and was involved in an incident in which he kicked the female manager of a sports bar for which he ultimately was convicted of fifth-degree assault. By 1996, Minnesota finally lost patience with Rider and dealt him to Portland in return for Bill Curley, James Robinson and a conditional first round draft pick in 1997 or 1998. Just before the trade Rider was arrested for marijuana possession. At the time of his arrest he also had an illegal cell phone; it had been altered to charge calls to someone else&#x27;s bill. He was later convicted of misdemeanor marijuana possession, and pleaded no contest to possessing the illegal cell phone. Three weeks later, he was arrested for gambling in public back in Oakland.

=== Portland Trail Blazers (1996–1999) ===
In the 1997–98 season, Rider led the Blazers in scoring (19.7 points per game, 15th in the NBA) and in three-pointers made (135, 8th) and attempted (420). Rider tallied a season-high 38 points (15-25 FG), along with 5 rebounds and 4 assists, against the Toronto Raptors on February 1, 1998.

In the 1998–99 season, Rider averaged 13.9 points per game and led the team in scoring 13 times.

=== Atlanta Hawks (1999–2000) ===
Following the 1998–99 season, Rider was traded to the Atlanta Hawks in a trade that sent Steve Smith to the Blazers. The Hawks had finished fourth in the Eastern Conference in the lockout-shortened season, and thought Rider was the final piece in the puzzle. So they sent Smith to the Blazers for Rider and Jim Jackson, another talent who had not quite reached his potential. The trade didn&#x27;t sit well with Hawks fans, since Smith had been one of the most popular players on the team. Coach Lenny Wilkens didn&#x27;t want the trade either, but tried to fit Rider into the system.

Rider played well enough on the court, pacing the Hawks in scoring. However, his off-court incidents exploded in Atlanta. After reports that he had smoked marijuana in an Orlando hotel room, the league demanded that he attend drug counseling. He refused and was fined a total of $200,000 until he agreed to attend. He was suspended numerous times by the Hawks as well, and fined a total of $200,000 by the team. Even after Wilkens benched him in March with the Hawks long out of contention, Rider still continued to be tardy for games and practices, prompting the Hawks to threaten a three-game suspension for another incident. He showed up late for a March game in Detroit, and rather than serve a three-game suspension, he demanded his outright release. The Hawks complied.

=== Los Angeles Lakers (2000–2001) ===
Rider played in 67 games with the Lakers during the 2000–01 season, leading their bench in scoring with a 7.6 average. He was suspended for five games in March 2001 for failing to comply with the NBA&#x27;s anti-drug policy. Though left off the playoff roster in favor of Tyronn Lue, Rider was awarded a championship ring by the franchise. After the season, Rider stated that he wanted to return to the Lakers.

=== Denver Nuggets (2001) ===
Prior to the 2001–02 season, the Denver Nuggets signed Rider to help resuscitate their moribund offense, but Rider&#x27;s stint in Denver was limited to just 10 games before he was waived on November 20, 2001. Rider refused to term it &quot;retirement&quot; at the time, however, insisting that he could still play if given the chance.

In 563 NBA games, (424 starts), Rider averaged 16.7 points, 3.8 rebounds, 2.7 assists, and 31:42 of floor time per game. Rider totaled 9,405 points in his 9-year NBA career.

==Off the court==
During his NBA career and in subsequent years, Rider was dogged by a variety of personal problems, including accusations of drug use and assault. In 2007, he was sentenced to seven months in jail after pleading guilty to cocaine possession, evading the police, and battery, though he only served about half of that time. &quot;It was the ultimate low point of my life [...] There were no visitors. No one down for me. No letters. I had fake friends. They left me for dead&quot;, Rider told Yahoo! Sports. At the time of his sentencing, Rider&#x27;s mother was in a coma, which weighed heavily on his mind.

In 2012, Rider announced he was planning to release a documentary about his life, called &quot;My Testimony: Raw and Uncut&quot;. Rider has also established a charitable organization for children called the Sky Rider Foundation. &quot;I just want to help kids. With today&#x27;s economy some parents cannot afford to send their kids to the extracurricular activities. It&#x27;s very costly, there&#x27;s registration fees, equipment, uniforms and shoe costs. If a kid has dreams to be somebody, I want to help&quot;, he said in an interview.

===Rap career===
On a 1994 album titled &quot;B-Ball&#x27;s Best Kept Secret&quot; which featured songs performed by NBA players ranging from Gary Payton and Jason Kidd to Brian Shaw and Chris Mills, Rider (credited as J.R. on the album) provided the track &quot;Funk in the Trunk&quot;.

==Change of era==
* 1596 : The era name was changed to &quot;Keichō&quot; to mark the passing of various natural disasters. The preceding era ended and a new one commenced on October 27 of the 5th &quot;Bunroku&quot;.

==Events of the &quot;Keichō&quot; era==

* October 21, 1600 (&quot;Keichō 5, 15th day of the 9th month&quot;): Battle of Sekigahara. The Tokugawa clan and its allies decisively vanquish all opposition.
* January 15, 1602 (&quot;Keichō 7, 24th day of the 11th month&quot;): A fire at the Hōkō-ji temple complex in Kyoto was caused by careless workmen; and the great image of the buddha and the structure housing the statue (the Daibutsu-den) were consumed by the flames.
* 1603 (&quot;Keichō 8&quot;): Tokugawa Ieyasu became &quot;shōgun&quot;, which effectively becomes the beginning of what will become the Edo &quot;bakufu&quot;. Toyotomi Hideyori was elevated to Naidaijin in Miyako Daijō-kan.
* 1604-1606 (&quot;Keichō 9-11&quot;): Tokugawa Ieyasu undertook the rebuilding of Asama Shrine at the base of Mount Fuji in Suruga Province in fulfillment of a vow and in gratitude for the help of the &quot;kami&quot; during the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600.
* 1605 (&quot;Keichō 10&quot;): Tokugawa Hidetada was named successor &quot;shōgun&quot; after his father &quot;retires&quot; from the position of &quot;shōgun&quot;.
* 1605 (&quot;Keichō 10&quot;): The first official map of Japan was ordered in this year and completed in 1639 at a scale of 1:280,000.
* January 23, 1605 (&quot;Keichō 10, 15th day of the 12th month&quot;): A new volcanic island, Hachijōko-jima, arose from the sea at the side of in the which stretch south and east from the Izu Peninsula.
* 1606 (&quot;Keichō 11&quot;): Construction began on Edo Castle.
* 1607 (&quot;Keichō 12&quot;): Construction began on Sunpu Castle in Suruga; and an ambassador from China arrived with greetings for the emperor of Japan.
* 1609 (&quot;Keichō 14&quot;): Invasion of Ryukyu by Shimazu &quot;daimyō&quot; of Satsuma.
* August 24, 1609 (&quot;Keichō 14, 25th day of the 6th month&quot;): Trading pass (&quot;handelpas&quot;) issued to Dutch East Indies Company in the name of Ieyasu Tokugawa.
* November 15, 1610 (&quot;Keichō 15, 30th day of the 9th month&quot;): Toyotomi Hideyori sponsors work which is begun to rebuild the Hōkō-ji in line with the plans which his father had supported; and this will include recreating the Daibutsu of Kyoto in bronze to replace the wooden image which had been burned. At this time, Hideyori also decides to order a great bell cast in bronze.
* May 20, 1610 (&quot;Keichō 15, 27th day of the 3rd month&quot;): Hideyori came to Kyoto to visit the former-&quot;shōgun&quot; Tokugawa Ieyasu; and the same day, the emperor resigns in favor of his son Masahito. Emperor Go-Yōzei abdicates; and his son receives the succession (&quot;senso&quot;).
* 1611 (&quot;Keichō 16&quot;): Emperor Go-Mizunoo formally accedes to the throne (&quot;sokui&quot;).
* 1613 (&quot;Keichō 18&quot;): In the years 1613 through 1620, Hasekura Tsunenaga headed a diplomatic mission to the Vatican in Rome, traveling through New Spain (arriving in Acapulco and departing from Veracruz) and visiting various ports-of-call in Europe. This historic mission is called the &quot;Keichō&quot; Embassy, (). On the return trip, Hasekura and his companions re-traced their route across Mexico in 1619, sailing from Acapulco for Manilla, and then sailing north to Japan in 1620. This is conventionally considered the first Japanese ambassador in the Americas and in Europe.
* 1614 (&quot;Keichō 19&quot;): Siege of Osaka. The &quot;shōgun&quot; vanquished Hideyori and set fire to Osaka Castle, and then he returned for the winter to Edo.
* August 24, 1614 (&quot;Keichō 19, 19th day of the 7th month&quot;): A new bronze bell for the Hōkō-ji was cast successfully – see 19th century photo of Hōkō-ji belland see old photo of bell; but despite dedication ceremony planning, Ieyasu forbade any further actions concerning the great bell:
::&quot;[T]he tablet over the Daibatsu-den and the bell bore the inscription &quot;Kokka ankō&quot; (meaning &quot;the country and the house, peace and tranquility&quot;), and at this Tokugawa Ieyasu affected to take umbrage, alleging that it was intended as a curse on him for the character 安 (&quot;an&quot;, &quot;peace&quot;) was placed between the two characters composing his own name 家康 (&quot;ka-kō&quot;, &quot;house tranquility&quot;) [suggesting subtly perhaps that peace could only be attained by Ieyasu&#x27;s dismemberment?] ... This incident of the inscription was, of course, a mere pretext, but Ieyasu realized that he could not enjoy the power he had usurped as long as Hideyori lived, and consequently, although the latter more than once dispatched his &quot;kerei&quot; Katagiri Kastumoto to Sunpu Castle with profuse apologies, Ieyasu refused to be placated.&quot;
* October 18, 1614 (&quot;Keichō 19, 25th day of the 10th month&quot;): A strong earthquake shook Kyoto.
* 1615 (&quot;Keichō 20&quot;): Osaka Summer Battle begins.

<doc id="1090988" wikidata="Q2973434" url="?curid=1090988" title="Division of Ballarat">
<text>The Division of Ballarat (spelt Ballaarat from 1901 until the 1977 election) is an Australian electoral division in the state of Victoria. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It was named for the provincial city of the same name by Scottish squatter Archibald Yuille, who established the first settlement − his sheep run called Ballaarat − in 1837, with the name derived from a local Wathawurrung word for the area, &quot;balla arat&quot;, thought to mean &quot;resting place&quot;.

The division currently takes in the regional City of Ballarat and the smaller towns of Gordon, Meredith, Buninyong, Clunes, Creswick, Daylesford, and Trentham and part of Burrumbeet.

The towns of Ballan, Bacchus Marsh, Blackwood and Myrniong were previously in the division before the division of Hawke was formed for the 2022 Federal Election.

The current Member for Ballarat, since the 2001 federal election, is Catherine King, a member of the Australian Labor Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

At various times in its existence the division has included other towns such as Ararat, Maryborough, and Stawell.

Ballarat used to be a marginal seat, changing hands at intervals between the Labor Party and the non-Labor parties. Unlike most marginal seats, it was not a barometer for winning government; since 1955, all but one of its members has spent at least one term in opposition.

Its most prominent member has been Alfred Deakin, who was Prime Minister of Australia three times. Liberal senator Michael Ronaldson was the grandson of Archibald Fisken, a former Member for Ballarat.

Ballarat also holds the distinction of seeing the closest seat result in Australian history. Nationalist Edwin Kerby unseated Labor incumbent Charles McGrath by a single vote in 1919. However, McGrath alleged irregularities, and the result was thrown out in 1920, forcing a by-election that was won by McGrath.

Since 2001, the seat has been held by Catherine King, a member of the Australian Labor Party. It has been a safe Labor seat since 2007 except for a 6.8 percent swing towards the Liberal Party at the 2013 election turning it marginal for one term.

<doc id="1090990" wikidata="Q31727537" url="?curid=1090990" title="The Silverpeaks">
<text>The Silverpeaks (sometimes spelt Silver Peaks) is an area of rough forest and tussock and scrub covered hill country inland and to the northwest of Dunedin, New Zealand. The area is largely uninhabited; the main indication of human activity is the Taieri Gorge Railway, which preserves the route of the former Otago Central Railway that runs along the steep-sided valley of the Taieri River. Much of the area lies within the Silverpeaks Scenic Reserve.

==Background==
A network of walking tracks crisscross the area. From Pulpit Rock, trampers descend the Devil&#x27;s Staircase into a lush valley just a short distance from Jubilee Hut. Access to these tracks is mainly via Double Hill Road, a rural road that leaves SH1 close to Waitati, and from several rural roads that leave SH87 between Outram and Middlemarch.

Several of the peaks rise to above 600 metres. The highest points in the Silverpeaks include Silver Peak (753 m), known in Māori as Huatea, Pulpit Rock (750 m), Mount Allen (705 m), Mount Misery (702 m). Several tributaries of the Taieri River have their sources on the slopes of the Silverpeaks to the west, as do several tributaries of the Waikouaiti River in the east.

Antimony was once mined near Hindon, the largest settlement in the area.

== Jubilee hut ==
The Jubilee Hut is a popular hut for hikers in the Silverpeaks. The hut contains 10 bunks and is four hours walk in from Mountain road. The first Jubilee hut was opened in 1948 with the current Jubilee hut opening in 2007.

Between November 2020 and October 2021, 600 bunk nights were booked at the hut.

== Tramping fatalities ==
As the name suggests, the region is often snow-coated in winter, and the weather in the Silverpeaks is notoriously unpredictable. The Department of Conservation considers the hiking in the area to be challenging and the country rugged. Eight international students were rescued in May 2009. They spent several hours in freezing winds and snow flurries before being rescued. They told police they had not tramped in the Silver Peaks before. Five were suffering from hypothermia. Three Logan Park High School students died in the Silver Peaks in 1983. They were walking to the Jubilee hut when they lost their way in fog and were then caught in a blizzard. Another fatality occurred in 1945 during a snow storm in the Silverpeaks.

<doc id="1090991" wikidata="Q5491454" url="?curid=1090991" title="Resuscitation">
<text>Resuscitation is the process of correcting physiological disorders (such as lack of breathing or heartbeat) in an acutely ill patient. It is an important part of intensive care medicine, anesthesiology, trauma surgery and emergency medicine. Well-known examples are cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.

== Documentation ==
For subsequent treatment, resuscitations have to be properly recorded. One example is trauma care. Even though there is a strong expansion of electronic health records, within the healthcare industry, rresuscitation documentation is still often handwritten, increasing the risk of incomplete documentation. Novel options like tablet-based solutions help to digitalize this process. For improved documentation quality, future solutions have to be accepted by clinicians and well-integrated into their workflows.

<doc id="1090996" wikidata="Q657495" url="?curid=1090996" title="Dislocation (syntax)">
<text>In syntax, dislocation is a sentence structure in which a constituent, which could otherwise be either an argument or an adjunct of the clause, occurs outside the clause boundaries either to its left or to its right. In this English example &quot;They went to the store, Mary and Peter&quot; the dislocation occurs to the right.

The dislocated element is often separated by a pause (comma in writing) from the rest of the sentence. Its place within the clause is often occupied by a pronoun (e.g. &quot;they&quot;).

There are two types of dislocation: right dislocation, in which the constituent is postponed (as in the above example), or a left dislocation, in which it is advanced. Right dislocation often occurs with a clarifying afterthought: &quot;They went to the store&quot; is a coherent sentence, but &quot;Mary and Peter&quot; is added afterward to clarify exactly who &quot;they&quot; are. By contrast, left dislocation is like clefting: it can be used to emphasize or define a topic. For example, the sentence &quot;This little girl, the dog bit her&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;The dog bit this little girl&quot; but it emphasizes that the little girl (and not the dog) is the topic of interest. One might expect the next sentence to be &quot;The little girl needs to see a doctor&quot;, rather than &quot;The dog needs to be leashed&quot;. This type of dislocation is a feature of topic-prominent languages.

==In French==
Informal spoken French uses right dislocation very naturally and extensively, to detach semantic information from the grammatical information. Whereas a French news article would likely translate &quot;The dog bit the little girl&quot; as &quot;Le chien a mordu la petite fille&quot; (lit. &quot;The dog has bitten the little girl&quot;), in everyday speech one might hear &quot;Il l&#x27;a mordue, le chien, la petite fille&quot; (lit. &quot;It has bitten her, the dog, the little girl&quot;), in which both &quot;le chien&quot; (&quot;the dog&quot;) and &quot;la petite fille&quot; (&quot;the little girl&quot;) have been dislocated to the right and replaced by pronouns within the clause. This phenomenon was first studied in French by linguist Joseph Vendryes.

It has been proposed that informal spoken French can be analyzed as having polypersonal agreement; that is, the various (mostly clitic) pronouns surrounding the verb can be viewed as inflections on the verb that agree in person, number, and sometimes gender with its various arguments.

Author Raymond Queneau, whose favourite example of dislocation in French was &quot;L&#x27;a-t-il jamais attrapé, le gendarme, son voleur ?&quot; (&quot;Has he ever caught him, the policeman, his thief?&quot;), has been inspired to write many articles such as &quot;Connaissez-vous le Chinook ?&quot; (&quot;Do you know Chinookan?&quot;). According to Queneau, right dislocation in Chinookan is commonplace.

==In Cantonese==
Colloquial Cantonese often uses right dislocation when afterthoughts occur after completing a sentence. Because it is a pro-drop language, no pronoun is used when a subject is dislocated, leading to an appearance of changed word order. For instance, the normal word order is subject–verb–object (SVO):
Dislocation can result in the appearance of verb–object–subject (VOS) word order because no pronoun is used:
At a deep level though, the sentence is still SVO but only appears to be VOS due to dislocation and pronoun dropping. Often a sentence-final particle (SFP) is required after the main clause, otherwise the sentence would sound strange or unacceptable. Right dislocation in Cantonese can occur with auxiliary verbs, adverbs, and sometimes subordinate clauses in addition to subjects.

Being a Chinese language, Cantonese is also a topic-prominent language and thus features left dislocation. For instance:
Topicalization can make this sentence appear to be object–subject–verb (OSV):
Both left and right dislocation can even be featured in the same sentence:

<text>was a after &quot;Genki&quot; and before &quot;Bunroku&quot;. This period spanned the years from July 1573 through December 1592 during the Senguoku era. The reigning emperors were and .

==Change of era==
* 1573 : The new era name was created to mark a number of regional wars. The era name was inspired by a passage from the Chinese classic &quot;Tao Te Ching by&quot; Laozi: :&quot;Those who are at peace with nature bring all under Heaven into its correct pattern&quot; (清静者為天下正).
The era name &quot;Tenshō&quot; was suggested by Oda Nobunaga. The previous era ended, and a new one commenced in &quot;Genki&quot; 4, the 28th day of the 7th month.

==Events of the &quot;Tenshō&quot; era==
European dates up to October 4, 1582 are given in the Julian calendar. Dates since October 15, 1582 are given in the Gregorian calendar.

* 1573 (&quot;Tenshō 1, 7th month&quot;): Ashikaga Yoshiaki lost his position as shōgun. He shaved his head, becoming a Buddhist priest. Initially, he took the priestly name Sho-san, but he eventually came to be known as Rei-o In.
* 1574 (&quot;Tenshō 2, 1st month&quot;): Sectarian rebellion in Echizen Province.
* 1574 (&quot;Tenshō 2, 9th month&quot;): Suppression of sectarian rebellion in Nagashima.
* 1575 (&quot;Tenshō 3, 5th month&quot;): Takeda Katsuyori led an army into Tōtōmi Province where he lay siege to Nagashino Castle. The Tokugawa defended the castle; and Tokugawa Ieayasu sought assistance from his ally Oda Nobunaga. In response, Nobunaga and his son Nobutada arrived at Nagashino with a large force. In the ensuing Battle of Nagashino, the Takeda attackers were forced to retreat.
* 1576 (&quot;Tenshō 4&quot;): Takeda Katsuyori ordered the rebuilding of the Asama Shrine at the base of Mount Fuji in Suruga Province. Construction of Azuchi Castle begins. 
* 1579 (&quot;Tenshō 7, 5th month&quot;): Azuchi Sect Debates at Azuchi Castle.
* 1579 (&quot;Tenshō 7, 6th month&quot;): Akechi Mitsuhide makes himself master of Tanba Province.
* 1579 (&quot;Tenshō 7, 10th month&quot;): Oda Nobukatsu launches first Tenshō Iga War, ending with his defeat.
* 1580 (&quot;Tenshō 8, 11th month&quot;): Kaga sectarian rebellion suppressed.
* 1581 (&quot;Tenshō 9, 9th month&quot;): Oda Nobunaga relaunches the second Tenshō Iga War, ending with victory and Iga left under Nobukatsu&#x27;s control.
* 1582 (&quot;Tenshō 10&quot;): Takeda Katsuyori utter defeat by the forces of Oda Nobunaga led to the destruction of Takeda-built structures at the Asama Shrine.
* 1582 (&quot;Tenshō 10, 3rd month&quot;): Battle of Tenmokuzan.
* 1582 (&quot;Tenshō 10, 6th month&quot;): Incident at Honnō-ji, Battle of Yamazaki, Council of Kiyosu.
* February 20, 1582 (&quot;Tenshō 10, 28th day of the 1st month&quot;): A Japanese mission or embassy to Europe (&quot;Tenshō Ken&#x27;ō Shisetsu&quot;) sailed from Nagasaki, and its members would not return until 1590. It headed by Mancio Itō and organized on the initiative of Alessandro Valignano. Although less well-known and less well-documented than Hasekura Tsunenaga&#x27;s diplomatic mission to the Vatican (known as the &quot;&quot;Keichō&quot; Embassy&quot;) in 1613–1620, this historic diplomatic initiative remains a noteworthy accomplishment. The mission is sometimes referred to as the &quot;&quot;Tenshō&quot; Embassy&quot; because it was initiated in the &quot;Tenshō&quot; era. This venture was organized by three &quot;daimyōs&quot; of Western Japan – Ōmura Sumitada, Ōtomo Sōrin and Arima Harunobu. 
* 1583 (&quot;Tenshō 11, 4th month&quot;): Battle of Shizugatake.
* 1584 (&quot;Tenshō 12, 4th month&quot;): Battle of Komaki and Nagakute.
* August 10, 1584 (&quot;Tenshō 12, 15th day of the 7th month&quot;): The Japanese mission to the West (&quot;Tenshō Ken&#x27;ō Shisetsu&quot;) arrived in Lisbon.
* 1585 (&quot;Tenshō 13, 7th month&quot;): Toyotomi Hideyoshi is given the position of &quot;kampaku&quot; by Emperor Ōgimachi.
* December 17, 1586 (&quot;Tenshō 14, 7th day of the 11th month&quot;): Ogimachi gave over the reins of civil government to his grandson, who would become Emperor Go-Yozei. There had been no such Imperial since Emperor Go-Hanazono abdicated in &quot;Kanshō&quot; 5. The dearth of abdications is attributable to the disturbed state of the country and to the fact that there was neither any dwelling in which an ex-emperor could live nor any excess funds in the treasury to support him.
* 1586 (&quot;Tenshō 14, 12th month&quot;): A political marriage is arranged between the youngest sister of Hideyoshi and Tokugawa Ieyasu.
* 1586 (&quot;Tenshō 14, 12th month&quot;): The &quot;kampaku&quot;, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was nominated to be &quot;Daijō-daijin&quot;.
* 1586 (&quot;Tenshō 14, 12th month&quot;): An earthquake strikes the Chubu region, killing 8,000 people.
* 1587 (&quot;Tenshō 15&quot;): Gold or silver coins called &quot;Tenshō-tsūhō&quot; were minted. The gold coins (&quot;Tenshō-ōban&quot;) weighed 165 grams; and these oval shaped coins were worth 10 &quot;ryō&quot;.
* 1588 (&quot;Tenshō 16, 7th month&quot;): Emperor Go-Yōzei visits Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s mansion, sword hunt decree
* 1590 (&quot;Tenshō 18, 7th month&quot;): Hideyoshi led an army to the Kantō where he lay siege to Odawara Castle in Sagami province. When the fortress fell, Hōjō Ujimasa died and his brother, Hōjō Ujinao submitted to Hideyoshi&#x27;s power, thus effectively ending a period of serial internal warfare , which had continued uninterrupted since the Ōnin era (1467).
* 1592 (&quot;Tenshō 20, 4th month&quot;): The Imjin War begins with the Siege of Busanjin.
In 1589–1590 (in the 23rd year of the reign of King Seonjo of Joseon), a diplomatic mission led by Hwang Yun-gil was sent to Japan. The Joseon ambassador was received by Hideyoshi.

==In popular culture==
The fictional plot of the classic Akira Kurosawa film &quot;Seven Samurai&quot; takes place in the 15th year of &quot;Tenshō&quot;.

<text>Chillagoe is a rural town and locality in the Shire of Mareeba, Queensland, Australia. In the , the locality of Chillagoe had a population of 214 people.

It was once a thriving mining town for a range of minerals, but is now reduced to a small zinc mine and some marble quarries.

Just out of town is the Chillagoe-Mungana Caves National Park containing limestone caves. There are between 600 and 1,000 caves in the Chillagoe-Mungana area. The caves, the spectacular karst landscape and the mining and smelting history are the main tourist attractions to the region.

It has been stated by leading geologist Professor Ian Plimer that the Chillagoe region has the most diverse geology in the world.

Chillagoe was named by William Atherton in 1888. The name is taken from the refrain of a sea shanty: &quot;Hikey, Tikey, Psyche, Crikey, Chillagoe, Walabadorie&quot;. James Mulligan had explored the area in 1873 and Atherton backed up his reports of rich copper outcrops in the area. Mining pioneer John Moffat sent prospectors to the field in 1888 and quickly monopolised the field. A receiving office opened in 1891 (with W. Atherton as Receiving Office Keeper) but closed in 1893. A post office opened in 1900 with F. Donner as the storekeeper and postmaster. The Chillagoe Railway and Mining Company&#x27;s line opened from Mareeba in 1901 and a Town Reserve was proclaimed 27 October 1910.

Chillagoe is sometimes remembered for its involvement in the Mungana affair, a mining scandal which brought down the government. In 1919, after fluctuating fortunes and closures, ownership of the smelter was transferred to the Queensland Government. This acquisition by the Labor Government brought allegations of political corruption which persisted for many years. Closures plagued the smelter again in the late 1920s. When the Labor Party lost power in 1929, the new government ordered a Royal Commission into the incident. The political careers of two former Queensland Premiers, &#x27;Red&#x27; Ted Theodore and William McCormack, were ruined by the commission&#x27;s report.

The Chillagoe Public Library opened in 2002.

Although Chillagoe is currently and historically within the local government area of Shire of Mareeba, between 2008 and 2013 the Shire (and hence Chillagoe) was amalgamated into the Tablelands Region.

<doc id="1091012" wikidata="Q2973440" url="?curid=1091012" title="Division of Batman">
<text>The Division of Batman was an Australian Electoral Division in the state of Victoria. It took its name from John Batman, one of the founders of the city of Melbourne. The division was created in 1906, replacing the Division of Northern Melbourne, and was abolished in 2019 and replaced by the Division of Cooper.

The division was located in Melbourne&#x27;s northern suburbs. It covered an area of approximately from / in the north to in the south, with Merri Creek providing the vast majority of the western boundary and Darebin Creek, parts of Macleod and Plenty Road in Bundoora providing the eastern boundary. The suburbs of , Clifton Hill, , , , , , and ; and parts of Bundoora, , , and Thomastown were in this division.

Held by Labor for all but 10 years of its history, Batman traditionally had been a safe Labor seat. However, the Greens made the seat a contest beginning with the 2010 election, where they reduced Labor from a 26.0% margin to a 7.9% margin. Though Labor increased their margin against the Greens to 10.6% in 2013, the Greens reduced Labor&#x27;s margin to just 1.0% in 2016. At the 2018 Batman by-election however, Labor increased their margin to 4.4% against the Greens.

In June 2018, the Australian Electoral Commission announced that, at the 2019 Australian federal election, the division would be re-named Cooper, after Aboriginal community leader and activist William Cooper.

==History==

When it was created it covered the inner suburbs of Carlton and Fitzroy, but successive boundary changes moved it steadily northwards, ending with it including Northcote, Preston, Reservoir and Thornbury.

Located in Labor&#x27;s traditional heartland of north Melbourne, Batman had been in Labor hands for all but two terms since 1910, and without interruption since 1969. It was held by Brian Howe from 1977 to 1996, a senior minister in the Hawke and Keating governments, and also Deputy Prime Minister 1991–95. Howe was succeeded at the 1996 election by Martin Ferguson, moving to Parliament after six years as President of the ACTU. Ferguson served as a senior Labor frontbencher, and a minister in the Rudd and Gillard governments, before resigning from the ministry in March 2013 after the failed challenge to Gillard&#x27;s leadership. He was succeeded at the 2013 election by former Senator David Feeney, who had been a parliamentary secretary in the Rudd and Gillard governments.

In 2018, as a result of the 2017–18 Australian parliamentary eligibility crisis, Feeney resigned and decided not to seek pre-selection to run at the ensuing by-election. The 2018 Batman by-election held on 17 March saw the election of Labor&#x27;s Ged Kearney.

<doc id="1091018" wikidata="Q4131720" url="?curid=1091018" title="Gas electron diffraction">
<text>Gas electron diffraction (GED) is one of the applications of electron diffraction techniques. The target of this method is the determination of the structure of gaseous molecules, i.e., the geometrical arrangement of the atoms from which a molecule is built up. GED is one of two experimental methods (besides microwave spectroscopy) to determine the structure of free molecules, undistorted by intermolecular forces, which are omnipresent in the solid and liquid state. The determination of accurate molecular structures by GED studies is fundamental for an understanding of structural chemistry.

== Introduction ==

Diffraction occurs because the wavelength of electrons accelerated by a potential of a few thousand volts is of the same order of magnitude as internuclear distances in molecules. The principle is the same as that of other electron diffraction methods such as LEED and RHEED, but the obtainable diffraction pattern is considerably weaker than those of LEED and RHEED because the density of the target is about one thousand times smaller. Since the orientation of the target molecules relative to the electron beams is random, the internuclear distance information obtained is one-dimensional. Thus only relatively simple molecules can be completely structurally characterized by electron diffraction in the gas phase. It is possible to combine information obtained from other sources, such as rotational spectra, NMR spectroscopy or high-quality quantum-mechanical calculations with electron diffraction data, if the latter are not sufficient to determine the molecule&#x27;s structure completely.

The total scattering intensity in GED is given as a function of the momentum transfer, which is defined as the difference between the wave vector of the incident electron beam and that of the scattered electron beam and has the reciprocal dimension of length. The total scattering intensity is composed of two parts: the atomic scattering intensity and the molecular scattering intensity. The former decreases monotonically and contains no information about the molecular structure. The latter has sinusoidal modulations as a result of the interference of the scattering spherical waves generated by the scattering from the atoms included in the target molecule. The interferences reflect the distributions of the atoms composing the molecules, so the molecular structure is determined from this part.
== Experiment ==
Figure 1 shows a drawing and a photograph of an electron diffraction apparatus. Scheme 1 shows the schematic procedure of an electron diffraction experiment. A fast electron beam is generated in an electron gun, enters a diffraction chamber typically at a vacuum of 10−7 mbar. The electron beam hits a perpendicular stream of a gaseous sample effusing from a nozzle of a small diameter (typically 0.2 mm). At this point, the electrons are scattered. Most of the sample is immediately condensed and frozen onto the surface of a cold trap held at -196 °C (liquid nitrogen). The scattered electrons are detected on the surface of a suitable detector in a well-defined distance to the point of scattering. 
The scattering pattern consists of diffuse concentric rings (see Figure 2). The steep decent of intensity can be compensated for by passing the electrons through a fast rotation sector (Figure 3). This is cut in a way, that electrons with small scattering angles are more shadowed than those at wider scattering angles. The detector can be a photographic plate, an electron imaging plate (usual technique today) or other position sensitive devices such as hybrid pixel detectors (future technique).

The intensities generated from reading out the plates or processing intensity data from other detectors are then corrected for the sector effect. They are initially a function of distance between primary beam position and intensity, and then converted into a function of scattering angle. The so-called atomic intensity and the experimental background are subtracted to give the final experimental molecular scattering intensities as a function of &quot;s&quot; (the change of momentum).

These data are then processed by suitable fitting software like UNEX for refining a suitable model for the compound and to yield precise structural information in terms of bond lengths, angles and torsional angles.

== Theory ==
GED can be described by scattering theory. The outcome if applied to gases with randomly oriented molecules is provided here in short:

Scattering occurs at each individual atom (formula_1), but also at pairs (also called molecular scattering) (formula_2), or triples (formula_3), of atoms.

formula_4 is the scattering variable or change of electron momentum, and its absolute value is defined as
: formula_5
with formula_6 being the electron wavelength defined above, and formula_7 being the scattering angle.

The above-mentioned contributions of scattering add up to the total scattering
: formula_8
where formula_9 is the experimental background intensity, which is needed to describe the experiment completely.

The contribution of individual atom scattering is called atomic scattering and easy to calculate:
: formula_10
with formula_11, formula_12 being the distance between the point of scattering and the detector, formula_13 being the intensity of the primary electron beam, and formula_14 being the scattering amplitude of the &quot;i&quot;-th atom. In essence, this is a summation over the scattering contributions of all atoms independent of the molecular structure. formula_1 is the main contribution and easily obtained if the atomic composition of the gas (sum formula) is known.

The most interesting contribution is the molecular scattering, because it contains information about the distance between all pairs of atoms in a molecule (bonded or non-bonded):
: formula_16
with formula_17 being the parameter of main interest: the atomic distance between two atoms, formula_18 being the mean square amplitude of vibration between the two atoms, formula_19 the anharmonicity constant (correcting the vibration description for deviations from a purely harmonic model), and formula_20 is a phase factor, which becomes important if a pair of atoms with very different nuclear charge is involved.

The first part is similar to the atomic scattering, but contains two scattering factors of the involved atoms. Summation is performed over all atom pairs.

formula_3 is negligible in most cases and not described here in more detail. formula_9 is mostly determined by fitting and subtracting smooth functions to account for the background contribution.

So it is the molecular scattering intensity that is of interest, and this is obtained by calculation all other contributions and subtracting them from the experimentally measured total scattering function.

== Results ==

Figure 5 shows two typical examples of results. The molecular scattering intensity curves are used to refine a structural model by means of a least squares fitting program. This yield precise structural information. The Fourier transformation of the molecular scattering intensity curves gives the radial distribution curves (RDC). These represent the probability to find a certain distance between two nuclei of a molecule. The curves below the RDC represent the diffrerence between the experiment and the model, i.e. the quality of fit.

The very simple example in Figure 5 shows the results for evaporated white phosphorus, P4. It is a perfectly tetrahedral molecule and has thus only one P-P distance. This makes the molecular scattering intensity curve a very simple one; a sine curve which is damped due to molecular vibration. The radial distribution curve (RDC) shows a maximum at 2.1994 Å with a least-squares error of 0.0003 Å, represented as 2.1994(3) Å. The width of the peak represents the molecular vibration and is the result of Fourier transformation of the damping part. This peak width means that the P-P distance varies by this vibration within a certain range given as a vibrational amplitude &quot;u&quot;, in this example &quot;u&quot;T(P‒P) = 0.0560(5) Å.

The slightly more complicated molecule P3As has two different distances P-P and P-As. Because their contributions overlap in the RDC, the peak is broader (also seen in a more rapid damping in the molecular scattering). The determination of these two independent parameters is more difficult and results in less precise parameter values than for P4.

Some selected other examples of important contributions to the structural chemistry of molecules are provided here:

* Structure of diborane B2H6
* Structure of the planar trisilylamine
* Determinations of the structures of gaseous elemental phosphorus P4 and of the binary P3As
* Determination of the structure of C60 and C70
* Structure of tetranitromethane
* Absence of local C3 symmetry in the simplest phosphonium ylide H2C=PMe3 and in amino-phosphanes like P(NMe2)3 and ylides H2C=P(NMe2)3
* Determination of intramolecular London dispersion interaction effects on gas-phase and solid-state structures of diamondoid dimers

<text>was a after &quot;Eiroku&quot; and before &quot;Tenshō&quot;. This period spanned from April 1570 through July 1573. The reigning emperor was .

==Change of era==
* ; 1570: The era name was changed because of various wars. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in &quot;Eiroku&quot; 13, on the 23rd day of the 4th month.

==Events of the &quot;Genki&quot; era==
* 1570 (&quot;Genki 1, 6th month&quot;): The combined forces of the Azai clan, led by Azai Nagamasa, and the Asakura clan, led by Asakura Yoshikage, met the forces of Oda Nobunaga in a shallow riverbed. The confrontation has come to be known as the Battle of Anegawa. Tokugawa Ieyasu led forces which came to the aid of Oda&#x27;s army; and Oda claimed the victory.
* 1571 (&quot;Genki 2, 9th month&quot;): Nobunaga marched into Ōmi Province at the head of his army which surrounded Mt. Hiei. He massacred the priests and everyone else associated with the mountain temples; and then he gave orders that every structure on the mountain should be burned.
* 1572 (&quot;Genki 3, 12th month&quot;): Takeda Shingen, the &quot;daimyō&quot; of Kai Province, led his army into Tōtōmi Province where he engaged the forces of Tokugawa Ieyasu at the Battle of Mikatagahara.
* 1573 (&quot;Genki 4, 2nd month&quot;): Ashikaga Yoshiaki began to fortify Nijō Castle; and he sent messages to Azai Nagamasa, Asakura Yoshikage, and Takeda Shingen, announcing his intention to start a Revolt against Nobunaga. Six months later, the confrontation would end with Yoshiaki driven out of Kyoto and the Ashikaga shogunate &quot;de facto&quot; dismantled.

<text>Alonzo Eratus Horton (October 24, 1813 – January 7, 1909) was an American real estate developer in the nineteenth century.

==Early life==
Horton was born 1813 in Union, Connecticut, the scion of an old New England family, and grew up in Onondaga County, New York. By his 20s he had developed a keen entrepreneurial spirit, and in 1834, when he was 21, he began transporting grain by boat from the Lake Ontario port of Oswego, New York, to Canada. He also taught school there, and in 1834 ran for constable on the Whig ticket. But having developed a cough, and with his family and friends fearing tuberculosis, he was advised to move to the West. At that time, the Western frontier was Wisconsin, and in 1836 he moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

A story was told that when Alonzo was eight years old and still living in New York he sold a pig for $1. By mistake, the man gave him $2. The next day Horton returned the $1. By coincidence, the two met again years later in Wisconsin, and the purchaser remembered the incident. He told a large group of citizens in Wisconsin. &quot;I would trust Horton with everything I have in the world.&quot;

In 1847, after the American success in the Mexican–American War, Horton traveled to St. Louis, Missouri, then the gateway to the Western frontier, and by purchasing land warrants from veterans of that war, gained 1,500 acres (6 km2) of land in the rural wilderness of northern Wisconsin. In 1848 he filed the first warrant for what would become the village of Hortonville, Wisconsin, in Outagamie County near Appleton, Wisconsin. Today, Hortonville is a village with a 2010 population of over 2,700.

In 1848 Horton filed his first Warrant in Green Bay, the County seat for Brown County which the area was a part of at that time, for 160 acres of land which is now &quot;Downtown Hortonville&quot;. The price per acre at that time was only $.70. But before he could file he had to take an oath that he had seen and inspected the land and that no other settler resided on the land. To do so meant travelling by foot to inspect the land which was almost all dense woods with no trails. Then he had to go back to Green Bay by foot to file and return again. No easy task as the trip was around 40 miles and the area has many streams and rivers that he needed to cross along the way. After this he became a success at trading land, establishing businesses and cattle.

In 1851, with his town a success, Horton decided to join many in seeking his fortune in the gold fields of California. He sold his interests for $7,000, and traveled to El Dorado County, California, the heart of the Mother Lode. However, he became a success yet again not so much through gold, but through trading ice in the mining towns. In 1857, he returned to Wisconsin via Panama. During an Indian attack, he lost a bag of gold dust worth $10,000, but kept the money he had made trading ice.

During the late 1850s and early 1860s, Horton spent some time in the East, even marrying his second wife, a prominent New Jersey woman. Horton&#x27;s first wife, whom he met in Wisconsin, had died of consumption. Horton is known to have married at least thrice, but relatives claimed he married about five times.

In 1862 Horton returned to California, this time to San Francisco, where he opened a furniture and household goods store at 6th and Market streets. While there he heard about growing settlement and interest in a small town called San Diego, located in far southern California, just north of the Mexico–United States border. It had become heavily acclaimed for its dry, warm, healthy climate, very welcome to many cold-weary Easterners. After a lecture about the ports of California, he later recalled his excitement, &quot;I could not sleep at night for thinking about San Diego, and at 2 in the morning, I got up and looked on a map to see where San Diego was, and then went back to bed satisfied. In the morning, I said to my wife, I am going to sell my goods and go to San Diego and build a city.&quot; Upon visiting there, he noticed that while the small town was built around the old Spanish presidio (fortress) well inland near the mouth of the San Diego River, no large settlements had been made along the large San Diego Bay just a few miles south, even though all ships sailing to the town docked in the bay.

==The New San Diego==
In 1867, Horton sold off his merchandise in San Francisco and journeyed to San Diego. There he bought 960 acres (3.9 km2) of land on San Diego Bay for just 27½ cents an acre ($67.95/km2), which became known as &quot;Horton&#x27;s Addition.&quot; Earlier pioneer William Heath Davis was the original founder of San Diego&#x27;s &quot;New Town&quot;, about 12 years before Horton appeared on the scene. &quot;New Town&quot; did not flourish because of lack of freshwater. &quot;Horton&#x27;s Addition&quot; adjoined the already existing Davis &quot;New Town&quot; subdivision. New businesses began to flood into the &quot;Horton&#x27;s Addition&quot; due to the promise of a rail connection from the harbor to the east. Eventually, the new addition began to eclipse Old Town in importance as the heart of the growing city. Local land exploded in price throughout the 1880s, making Horton a success yet again. Horton helped to establish San Diego&#x27;s Chamber of Commerce in an effort to further expand the developing city. In 1867, Horton was the first person to ask for a public city park to be developed, which later became Balboa Park. When the U.S. Congress withdrew its proposed aid to bring the Texas Pacific Railroad into San Diego, the progress of the city froze. Many of the workers in the city had paid Horton a large down payment on their property of 1/3rd the value, and offered to surrender the sum along with the property if Horton would only release them from the contract. Instead, Horton is said to have canceled the contract of anyone who asked, and returned all the money paid, at a great personal loss. Eventually, the California Southern Railroad (now a part of BNSF Railway) became the first line to connect the city with the rest of America&#x27;s rail network in 1885. But land values crashed in the late 1880s, devastating much of Horton&#x27;s fortune. By the time he died in 1909, he had lost much of his former wealth.

==Personal life==
Horton went down in history as a tireless, enthusiastic supporter of the interests of whatever locality he happened to be living in. Saying after moving to Wisconsin and founding the village of &quot;Hortonville&quot; as one of its first settlers in 1848, &quot;My principle is to be as happy as I can every day, to try and make everyone else as happy as I can, and to try to make no one unhappy.&quot; Today, the village of Hortonville, Wisconsin honors its founder with &quot;Alonzo Park&quot;, one of three parks in the small town.

He also had an effect on San Diego&#x27;s political scene; when he moved there in late 1860s, most locals, many of whom had migrated from the South or the border states, had supported the South during the Civil War and were Copperheads, or Democratic sympathizers of the Confederacy in an officially Union state. Upon being told that San Diego was a &quot;Copperhead hole&quot;, Horton remarked, &quot;Then I shall make it a Republican hole,&quot; and encouraged strong Republican sentiment in the city&#x27;s newspapers.

Horton was one of San Diego&#x27;s first Unitarians. He helped found the first Unitarian church in San Diego.

Horton died at age 96 in Agnew Sanitarium, San Diego. He is buried at Mount Hope Cemetery.

Horton Plaza Park in downtown San Diego was named for him.

<text>Jerome Richard Krause (April 6, 1939 – March 21, 2017) was an American sports scout and executive who was the general manager of the Chicago Bulls in the National Basketball Association (NBA) from 1985 to 2003.

His tenure with the Bulls included their six NBA championships between 1991 and 1998, led by superstar players Michael Jordan and Scottie Pippen. Krause received the NBA Executive of the Year Award in 1988 and 1996. He was posthumously inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in 2017. His career in sports included positions as a scout or general manager for the Baltimore Bullets, Chicago White Sox, and the Chicago Bulls.

==Early career==
Krause was born in 1939 to a Jewish family and grew up in Chicago. He played high school baseball as a catcher at Taft High School in Chicago and attended Bradley University.

After college, he went to work as a scout with the Baltimore Bullets. Early on, Krause gained a reputation of being able to spot talent. Some credit him with discovering future Hall-of-Famer Earl Monroe.

While with the Bullets, Krause urged the team to pick North Dakota forward Phil Jackson in the 1967 NBA draft. The Bullets did not draft him, but Krause continued to keep in touch during Jackson&#x27;s playing career and into his first years as a coach. Their relationship flourished during the 1970s and 1980s. While Jackson was coaching the Albany Patroons in the Continental Basketball Association, Krause once called him to ask for an analysis of the league&#x27;s players, which Jackson provided in detail.

After a few years with Baltimore, Krause worked as a scout with the Phoenix Suns, Philadelphia 76ers, Los Angeles Lakers, and Chicago Bulls in the 1970s.

Krause also worked as a baseball scout. He worked in the 1970s for the Cleveland Indians, Oakland Athletics, Seattle Mariners, and Chicago White Sox. While working for the Mariners, Krause continued to scout part-time for the Lakers. As a White Sox scout, he played a role in the signing of Ozzie Guillén and Kenny Williams, who would lead the White Sox to a World Series championship in as manager and general manager, respectively. He scouted for the White Sox until 1984.

==Chicago Bulls GM==
Krause replaced Rod Thorn as Chicago Bulls General Manager ahead of the 1985–86 NBA season.

===Coaching staff===
Krause&#x27;s first hire with the Bulls was longtime personal friend Tex Winter. Krause hired Winter as an assistant bench coach. Krause urged Winter to teach all of the Bulls players, especially Michael Jordan, the Triangle Offense. Winter had learned the triangle offense as a college player at USC under then head coach Sam Barry, and later used it to successfully guide Kansas State to a number one ranking. Krause fired then-head coach Doug Collins and replaced him with assistant coach Phil Jackson because Collins would not let Winter do as Krause had instructed.

===Building the 1991–93 roster===
At the time Krause became the Bulls&#x27; general manager, Michael Jordan and John Paxson – two of the five players who would become key parts of the team that would win three consecutive championships from 1991 to 1993 – were already on the team. Krause began building the foundation for future success by turning over the Bulls roster and building up a collection of draft picks. In the 1987 NBA draft, Krause chose power forward Horace Grant. He also traded draft pick Olden Polynice, a center, for Seattle&#x27;s first-round draft pick, small forward and future Bulls star Scottie Pippen. Grant and Pippen were, along with Jordan, cornerstones of the Bulls&#x27; 1991–1993 championship teams.

In 1988, Krause traded power forward Charles Oakley to the New York Knicks for center Bill Cartwright. Oakley was Jordan&#x27;s best friend on the team, and Jordan despised the trade. He and Oakley learned of the trade while they were on their way to Las Vegas to see a Mike Tyson fight. Cartwright turned out to be everything the Bulls needed, however, providing a presence in the middle for all three Bulls championships from 1991 to 1993. Perhaps most importantly, Cartwright proved to be the league&#x27;s best center at defending Patrick Ewing, the New York Knicks&#x27; star who was the key player on the Bulls&#x27; most important early-1990s conference rival. Jordan later acknowledged that Krause had made the correct move in trading Oakley for Cartwright.

By 1988, the Bulls had assembled their starting five players (guards Jordan and Paxson, forwards Pippen and Grant, and center Cartwright) for the team that would reach five consecutive Eastern Conference finals from 1989 to 1993 and win three consecutive NBA championships from 1991 to 1993. Krause was named NBA Executive of the Year in 1988. In 1989 and 1990, Krause added depth to the roster. The Bulls picked Stacey King and B. J. Armstrong in the 1989 NBA draft and later signed undrafted big man Scott Williams.

===Building the 1996–98 roster===
The first retirement of Jordan, following the 1993 NBA season, brought massive change to the Chicago Bulls roster. The 1993–94 Bulls were composed entirely of Krause&#x27;s acquisitions, including several minimum salary players. Just before Jordan announced his retirement, Krause persuaded 1990 draft pick Toni Kukoč to buy himself out of his European contract and join the Bulls. Despite losing Jordan, the Bulls won 55 games during the season, just two less than the season before. In the playoffs, the Bulls lost to the heavily favored New York Knicks in seven games in the second round.

During the 1993–94 NBA season, Stacey King was traded to the Minnesota Timberwolves in exchange for 7&#x27;2&quot; center Luc Longley. Longley&#x27;s emergence for the Bulls during the 1994–95 season made Will Perdue expendable. Just before the start of the 1995–96 season, Perdue was traded to the San Antonio Spurs for Dennis Rodman.

After Jordan returned to the NBA, the Bulls won a then-NBA record 72 games in the 1995–1996 season, and Krause was named Executive of the Year for the second time. The next year, they tied the then second best-ever NBA record with 69 wins and repeated as champions.

===1997–98 season===

Krause and head coach Phil Jackson had been friends for years, but their relationship was, in Jackson&#x27;s opinion, shattered early in the 1990s after &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter Sam Smith (whom Krause despised) published a book on the 1991 title team, &quot;The Jordan Rules&quot;. The book detailed the tension that already existed between Krause and the players, and ultimately drove a wedge between Krause and Jackson.

After contentious negotiations between Jackson and the Bulls in that same period, Jackson was signed for the 1997–98 season only. Krause announced the signing in what Chicago media widely considered to be a mean-spirited manner, emphasizing that Jackson would not be rehired even if the Bulls won the 1997–98 title. That triggered an argument between Jackson and Krause in which Jackson essentially told Krause that he seemed to be rooting for the other side and not the Bulls. At that point, Krause told Jackson, &quot;I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s 82-and-0 this year, you&#x27;re fucking gone.&quot; Krause was widely quoted as saying, &quot;Players and coaches don&#x27;t win championships; organizations win championships.&quot; The statement particularly offended Michael Jordan. However, Krause said that his original phrasing was &quot;Players and coaches &quot;alone&quot; don&#x27;t win championships; organizations win championships.&quot;

Although most of the narrative suggested that Jackson was forced out as head coach, Jackson had actually declined a long-term offer from owner Jerry Reinsdorf. After the Bulls&#x27; final title of the Jordan era in 1998, Reinsdorf offered Jackson the opportunity to come back the following year as head coach, but made it clear that the team would have to go into a rebuild. Jackson declined. Longtime friend, Krause and Bulls assistant coach Tex Winter, who was the architect of the triangle offense, stayed with the Bulls for another full season; he left the organization in the summer of 1999, when Jackson was hired to coach the Lakers.

===Rebuilding===
After the 1998 title, deciding that the Bulls were aging and facing an uncertain future, Krause chose to unload the veterans and rebuild. The draft brought prolific collegiate players such as Elton Brand, Ron Artest, Marcus Fizer, Jamal Crawford, and Jay Williams to the Bulls. After the Bulls finished 15–67 during the 2000–2001 season, Krause decided to trade away his best player (Brand) for high schooler Tyson Chandler, who was hyped as &quot;the next Kevin Garnett&quot;. He also drafted another high schooler, Eddy Curry, who was hyped as a slightly smaller version of Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, with the fourth overall pick in the draft. Krause believed that Chandler and Curry would develop into elite players and provide the foundation for another dynasty. A mid-season trade the following year brought scorer Jalen Rose to the Bulls in exchange for Brad Miller and Artest, clearing playing time for Chandler and Curry. After drafting Jay Williams during the offseason, the Bulls had a roster with Rose, Crawford, Curry, Chandler, Williams, and Fizer that fulfilled Krause&#x27;s dream of a talented young athletic team. The Bulls showed some improvement the following year.

==Later years and death==
In 2003, Krause resigned from his post as general manager. He explained, &quot;The rigors and stress of the job have caused me some minor physical problems in the past few years.&quot; The Bulls fell to 23–59 in the next season, and Krause&#x27;s dream of a talented young athletic team imploded; all of his acquisitions were traded or out of the league within three years.

Krause went back to his roots and worked briefly for the New York Yankees as a scout before joining the New York Mets in 2005. In 2010, he rejoined the Chicago White Sox as a scout, a position he had held in the 1970s and 80s. He was appointed by the Arizona Diamondbacks as a special assistant in its scouting department on April 1, 2011.

On March 21, 2017, Krause died at the age of 77. He had been struggling with health issues such as osteomyelitis. He was inducted into the 2017 Basketball Hall of Fame class posthumously.

On January 12, 2024, in the Chicago Bulls home game against the Golden State Warriors, Krause&#x27;s widow, Thelma, attended his Ring of Honor induction on his behalf for his contributions to the franchise&#x27;s success. During the ceremony, some fans loudly booed Krause, bringing Thelma to tears. The fans’ reaction received heavy criticism from Warriors coach and former Bulls player Steve Kerr, Bulls announcer and former player Stacey King, ESPN&#x27;s Brian Windhorst, NBA on TNT Analyst Charles Barkley, and former NBA player Kendrick Perkins.

<doc id="1091054" wikidata="Q5532636" url="?curid=1091054" title="Generative topographic map">
<text>Generative topographic map (GTM) is a machine learning method that is a probabilistic counterpart of the self-organizing map (SOM), is probably convergent and does not require a shrinking neighborhood or a decreasing step size. It is a generative model: the data is assumed to arise by first probabilistically picking a point in a low-dimensional space, mapping the point to the observed high-dimensional input space (via a smooth function), then adding noise in that space. The parameters of the low-dimensional probability distribution, the smooth map and the noise are all learned from the training data using the expectation–maximization (EM) algorithm. GTM was introduced in 1996 in a paper by Christopher Bishop, Markus Svensen, and Christopher K. I. Williams.

== Details of the algorithm ==
The approach is strongly related to density networks which use importance sampling and a multi-layer perceptron to form a non-linear latent variable model. In the GTM the latent space is a discrete grid of points which is assumed to be non-linearly projected into data space. A Gaussian noise assumption is then made in data space so that the model becomes a constrained mixture of Gaussians. Then the model&#x27;s likelihood can be maximized by EM.

In theory, an arbitrary nonlinear parametric deformation could be used. The optimal parameters could be found by gradient descent, etc.

The suggested approach to the nonlinear mapping is to use a radial basis function network (RBF) to create a nonlinear mapping between the latent space and the data space. The nodes of the 
RBF network then form a feature space and the nonlinear mapping can then be taken as a linear transform of this feature space. This approach has the advantage over the suggested density network approach that it can be optimised analytically.

== Uses ==
In data analysis, GTMs are like a nonlinear version of principal components analysis, which allows high-dimensional data to be modelled as resulting from Gaussian noise added to sources in lower-dimensional latent space. For example, to locate stocks in plottable 2D space based on their hi-D time-series shapes. Other applications may want to have fewer sources than data points, for example mixture models.

In generative deformational modelling, the latent and data spaces have the same dimensions, for example, 2D images or 1 audio sound waves. Extra &#x27;empty&#x27; dimensions are added to the source (known as the &#x27;template&#x27; in this form of modelling), for example locating the 1D sound wave in 2D space. Further nonlinear dimensions are then added, produced by combining the original dimensions. The enlarged latent space is then projected back into the 1D data space. The probability of a given projection is, as before, given by the product of the likelihood of the data under the Gaussian noise model with the prior on the deformation parameter. Unlike conventional spring-based deformation modelling, this has the advantage of being analytically optimizable. The disadvantage is that it is a &#x27;data-mining&#x27; approach, i.e. the shape of the deformation prior is unlikely to be meaningful as an explanation of the possible deformations, as it is based on a very high, artificial- and arbitrarily constructed nonlinear latent space. For this reason the prior is learned from data rather than created by a human expert, as is possible for spring-based models.

== Comparison with Kohonen&#x27;s self-organizing maps ==
While nodes in the self-organizing map (SOM) can wander around at will, GTM nodes are constrained by the allowable transformations and their probabilities. If the deformations are well-behaved the topology of the latent space is preserved.
The SOM was created as a biological model of neurons and is a heuristic algorithm. By contrast, the GTM has nothing to do with neuroscience or cognition and is a probabilistically principled model. Thus, it has a number of advantages over SOM, namely:
* it explicitly formulates a density model over the data.
* it uses a cost function that quantifies how well the map is trained.
* it uses a sound optimization procedure (EM algorithm).

GTM was introduced by Bishop, Svensen and Williams in their Technical Report in 1997 (Technical Report NCRG/96/015, Aston University, UK) published later in Neural Computation. It was also described in the PhD thesis of Markus Svensen (Aston, 1998).

<doc id="1091055" wikidata="Q740099" url="?curid=1091055" title="Ray Barretto">
<text>Raymundo &quot;Ray&quot; Barretto Pagán (April 29, 1929 – February 17, 2006) was an American percussionist and bandleader of Puerto Rican descent. Throughout his career as a percussionist, he played a wide variety of Latin music styles, as well as Latin jazz. His first hit, &quot;El Watusi&quot;, was recorded by his Charanga Moderna in 1962, becoming the most successful pachanga song in the United States. In the late 1960s, Barretto became one of the leading exponents of boogaloo and what would later be known as salsa. Nonetheless, many of Barretto&#x27;s recordings would remain rooted in more traditional genres such as son cubano. A master of the descarga (improvised jam session), Barretto was a long-time member of the Fania All-Stars. His success continued into the 1970s with songs such as &quot;Cocinando&quot; and &quot;Indestructible&quot;. His last album for Fania Records, &quot;Soy dichoso&quot;, was released in 1990. He then formed the New World Spirit jazz ensemble and continued to tour and record until his death in 2006. He is the father of American vocalist and saxophonist Chris Barretto, best known for his work with Periphery and Monuments.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Barretto was born on April 29, 1929, in Brooklyn, New York. His parents moved to New York from Puerto Rico in the early 1920s, looking for a better life. His father left their family when Barretto was four, and his mother Delores moved the family to first Spanish Harlem (El Barrio) on NYC&#x27;s East Side then at the age of 7 to the Bronx.From a young age he was influenced by his mother&#x27;s love of music and by the jazz of Duke Ellington and Count Basie.

In 1946, when Barretto was 17 years old, he joined the Army. While stationed in Germany, he met Belgian vibraphonist Fats Sadi. However, it was when he heard Dizzy Gillespie&#x27;s &quot;Manteca&quot; with Gil Fuller and Chano Pozo that he realized his calling. Barretto was not able to escape racial discrimination while stationed in Germany, which led him to a nightclub that was welcoming to black servicemen. He was able to start his music career at this club by playing the back head of a banjo.

===Beginnings as a sideman===
In 1949, when Barretto returned home from military service, he started to visit clubs and participated in jam sessions, where he perfected his conga playing. He is credited as being the first U.S. born percussionist to incorporate the conga drum into jazz. On one occasion Charlie Parker heard Barretto play and invited him to play in his band. Later, he was asked to play for José Curbelo and Tito Puente, for whom he played for four years. It was in 1958, while playing for Puente, that Barretto received his first recording credit. Barretto developed a unique style of playing the conga and soon he was sought by other jazz band leaders. Latin percussionists started to appear in jazz groups with frequency as a consequence of Barretto&#x27;s musical influence.

In 1963 Barreto played conga on Kenny Burrell&#x27;s album &quot;Midnight Blue&quot;, noted by several critics as one of the greatest jazz albums.

===Charanga Moderna and rise to fame===
In 1960, Barretto was a house musician for the Prestige, Blue Note, and Riverside labels. He also recorded on Columbia Records with Jazz flautist Herbie Mann. New York had become the center of Latin music in the United States and a musical genre called pachanga was the Latin music craze of the early 1960s. In 1962, Barretto formed his first group, Charanga La Moderna, and recorded his first hit, &quot;El Watusi&quot; for Tico Records. He was quite successful with the song and the genre, to the point of being typecast (something that he disliked).

===Boogaloo and early salsa===
In 1965, Barretto signed with the Latin division of United Artists, UA Latino, and began recording a series of albums in the boogaloo genre, which merges rhythm and blues with Latin music. On his album &quot;El Ray Criollo&quot;, Barretto explored the modern Latin sounds of New York, combining features of charanga and conjunto to birth a new style which would later be known as salsa. After recording four albums for the United Artists label, Barretto joined the Fania record label in 1967, and his first recording for the new label was the 1968 album &quot;Acid&quot;, which is often cited as one of the most enduring boogaloo albums, with songs such as &quot;A Deeper Shade of Soul&quot; and the title track was included in the soundtrack of the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories on the fictitious Latin music radio station &quot;Radio Espantoso&quot;. During this period, Adalberto Santiago was the band&#x27;s lead vocalist.

===Success with Fania===
In 1972 Barretto&#x27;s &quot;Que viva la música&quot; was released. &quot;Cocinando,&quot; a track from the album, opened the soundtrack of the Fania All Stars film &quot;Our Latin Thing&quot; in which Barretto had a role. After a number of successful albums, and just as his Afro-Cuban band had attained a remarkable following, most of its members left it to form Típica 73, a multinational salsa conglomerate. In 1973, Barretto recorded the album &quot;Indestructible&quot;, in which he played &quot;La familia&quot;, a song written by José Curbelo in 1953 and recorded by the sonero Carlos Argentino with the Cuban band Sonora Matancera; Tito Allen joined as new vocalist. Allen left the band after &quot;Indestructible&quot;. The series of departures left Barretto depressed and disappointed with salsa; he then redirected his efforts to jazz, while remaining as musical director of the Fania All Stars. In 1975 he released &quot;Barretto&quot;, also referred to as the &quot;Guararé&quot; album, with new vocalists Ruben Blades and Tito Gomez.

Barretto played the conga in recording sessions for the Rolling Stones and the Bee Gees. He performanced on Herbie Mann&#x27;s &quot;Discotheque&quot; album also. In 1975, he was nominated for a Grammy Award for the album &quot;Barretto&quot;. From 1976 to 1978, Barretto recorded three albums for Atlantic Records, and was nominated for a Grammy for &quot;Barretto Live...Tomorrow&quot;. In 1979, he recorded &quot;La Cuna&quot; for CTI Records and produced a salsa record for Fania, titled &quot;Rican/Struction&quot;, which was named 1980 &quot;Best Album&quot; by Latin N.Y. Magazine, with Barretto crowned as &#x27;Conga Player of the Year&#x27;.

===New World Spirit===
In 1990, Barretto won his only Grammy, in the Tropical Music category, for the album &quot;Ritmo en el corazón&quot; (&quot;Rhythm in the Heart&quot;), a collaboration featuring the vocals of Celia Cruz and Adalberto Santiago. His 1968 song &quot;A Deeper Shade Of Soul&quot; was sampled for the 1991 &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 #21 hit &quot;Deeper Shade of Soul&quot; by Dutch band Urban Dance Squad.

Also in the 1990s, a Latin agent, Chino Rodríguez, approached Barretto with a concept he also pitched to Larry Harlow. The idea was &quot;The Latin Legends of Fania&quot;, and Barretto, Harlow, Yomo Toro, Pete &quot;el Conde&quot; Rodríguez, Junior González, Ismael Miranda, and Adalberto Santiago came together and formed &quot;The Latin Legends of Fania&quot;, booked by Chino Rodríguez of Latin Music Booking.com. However, in 1992 Barretto left the Legends to focus on his new jazz ensemble, New World Spirits, with which he recorded several albums for the Concord Jazz label.

In 1999, Barretto was inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame.

In 2006, the National Endowment for the Arts awarded Barretto its Jazz Masters Award.

Barretto lived in Northern New Jersey and was an active musical producer, as well as the leader of a touring band which embarked on tours of the United States, Africa, Europe, Israel and Latin America.

===Death===
A resident of Norwood, New Jersey, Barretto died of heart failure and complications of multiple health issues on February 17, 2006, at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey. His body was flown to Puerto Rico, where Barretto was given formal honors by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture; his remains were cremated.

<doc id="1091064" wikidata="Q2973455" url="?curid=1091064" title="Division of Bendigo">
<text>The Division of Bendigo is an Australian electoral division in the state of Victoria. The division was proclaimed in 1900, and was one of the original 65 divisions to be contested at the first federal election. It is named for the city of Bendigo.

The division is situated on the northern foothills of the Great Dividing Range in North Central Victoria. It covers an area of approximately and provides the southern gateway to the Murray–Darling basin. In addition to the city of Bendigo, other large population centres in the division include , , Kyneton and .

The current Member for the Division of Bendigo, since the 2013 federal election, is Lisa Chesters, a member of the Australian Labor Party.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

==History==

In the early years of federation the seat consisted of little more than Bendigo itself, but on later boundaries the seat has included towns such as Echuca, Castlemaine, Maryborough and Seymour.

Bendigo has been a marginal seat, changing hands regularly between the Labor Party and the conservative parties; typically mirroring voting patterns in state elections. However, it has remained a Labor seat since the 1998 federal election.

Unlike most marginal seats, Bendigo is not a barometer for winning government. Since 1949, all but one of its members has spent at least one term in opposition. Indeed, during two elections that saw a change of government, it elected an opposition MP.

Its most notable members include its first representative, Sir John Quick, who was a leading federalist, and Prime Minister Billy Hughes who, although from Sydney, represented Bendigo for two terms at a time when the federal Parliament met in Melbourne, and who moved to the seat after leaving the Labor Party over conscription, holding the seat as the leader of the Nationalist Party.

John Brumby, who held the seat from 1983 to 1990, would subsequently be elected to the Victorian Legislative Council in 1993. He then transferred to the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Broadmeadows a few months later, after being elected Victorian Opposition Leader, a position he would hold until 1999. After serving as a senior state minister under Steve Bracks, Brumby went on to become Premier of Victoria from 2007 to 2010. 

Brumby was defeated in Bendigo at the 1990 election by a former state Legislative Councillor, Bruce Reid, who retained the seat narrowly in 1993 and 1996, before retiring at the 1998 election, when a 4.3% swing delivered the seat to Labor&#x27;s Steve Gibbons. Reid has a minor claim to fame through being the third candidate in the contest for Liberal leadership between John Hewson and John Howard after the party&#x27;s 1993 election defeat. Reid attracted one vote, presumably his own.

<doc id="1091066" wikidata="Q356624" url="?curid=1091066" title="Muhammad I of Córdoba">
<text>Muhammad I of Cordoba (; 823–886) was a Muslim ruler of al-Andalus. He ruled during a time of thriving art, architecture and culture in Islamic Iberia in the 9th century, turning Cordoba into a cultural and political center.

== Reign ==

Muhammad I engaged in diplomacy with Charles the Bald, the Carolingian king of the West Franks, sending him camels in 865.

== Martyrs of Cordoba ==

Under the reign of Muhammad I, what became later known as the Cordoban Martyr Movement took place. While a majority of Cordoban Christians conformed to Islamic society and lived comfortably as a result, there were still some who fervently defended their faith. During the mid 9th century there was a group of outspoken Cordoban Christians who publicly denounced the Muhammad. As a result of their protests, 50 Christians were executed by the Umayyad government. The source of this event comes from a rediscovered 16th century manuscript.

== Architecture ==

Muhammad I is credited with some of the work done on the Great Mosque of Cordoba in the 9th century. He may have completed the first major expansion of the mosque begun by his father, Abd ar-Rahman II. He also added a &quot;maqsura&quot;. In 855 he restored the entrance called (&quot;Gate of the Viziers&quot;), known today as the , which is an important early example of the prototypical Moorish gateway.

One of Muhammad I&#x27;s wives, Umm Salama, also founded a cemetery and a mosque named after her in the northern suburbs of Cordoba. Over time, this cemetery turned into the city&#x27;s largest.

<doc id="1091071" wikidata="Q1763900" url="?curid=1091071" title="Panorama (The Cars album)">
<text>Panorama is the third studio album by American new wave band the Cars, released on August 15, 1980, by Elektra Records. Like its predecessors, it was produced by Roy Thomas Baker and released on Elektra Records.

==Background==
The record marked a change from the upbeat pop rock and hard rock of the group&#x27;s previous albums, representing a more aggressive and experimental sound. &quot;Billboard&quot; said that while &quot;Panorama&quot; retained the Cars&#x27; minimalist approach from their debut album, it sounded sufficiently different to avoid having the group sound like a caricature of itself.

&quot;Panorama&quot; peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has been certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;Touch and Go&quot;, reached number 37 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; critic Ken Tucker said that &quot;&quot;Panorama&quot; isn&#x27;t merely a joyless joyride, it&#x27;s an out-and-out drag.&quot; Robert Christgau claimed that the album&#x27;s problem is &quot;boredom with formula&quot; and said that &quot;This is longer, slower and denser [than previous Cars&#x27; albums], with lyrics that skirt social commentary and music that essays textural pretension. &quot;Spin Alternative Record Guide&quot; deemed the album &quot;a dry, monotonous Wire imitation.&quot; Critic Keith Roysdon said that &quot;The entire album is a plea from a man&#x27;s point of view for love and/or sex from a woman. The fact that &#x27;he&#x27;, the narrator, is getting neither accounts for the depressing tone of the LP.&quot; Roysdon also found the album repetitious, saying that &quot;Songwriter Ric Ocasek has written some fairly good numbers, but they sound alike, with just a few exceptions.&quot; &quot;Daily Herald-Tribune&quot; critic Ethlie Ann Vare said that it lacked the &quot;hard rocking edge&quot; from the Cars&#x27; first two albums and that it &quot;slops over into muddy techno-pop.&quot; &quot;Quad-City Times&quot; critic Greg Kot said that the album &quot;overdoses on Ric Ocasek&#x27;s too chic, too nebulous lyrics and Roy Thomas Baker&#x27;s intrusive production&quot; and that &quot;Ocasek and the band build tension but the climaxes never arrive&quot; resulting in an album that &quot;fails as rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll.&quot; &quot;Pittsburgh Press&quot; critic Pete Bishop felt it had &quot;an undue amount of menace and too little melody and snap in the music.&quot; &quot;Saginaw News&quot; critic Nancy Kuharevicz called it a &quot;stark, almost anti-musical album&quot; and said that &quot;When Ocasek isn&#x27;t moaning like a whiny, jilted adolescent, he&#x27;s repetitiously droning pat phrases which range from trite to abtruse.&quot; Critic Stuart Margulies called it &quot;shockingly boring, unmelodic and senseless.&quot;

&quot;Boston Globe&quot; critic Steve Morse called it &quot;a tour de force of high-tech strategy&quot; that &quot;ushers in a potpourri of new sound textures.&quot; &quot;The State Journal&quot; critic Archer Prewitt said that &quot;every song is good&quot; and that &quot;No one song is similar to another and each has an irrestible characteristic that leave you humming.&quot; &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Steve Pond criticized the album&#x27;s lack of hooks compared to previous Cars&#x27; albums but felt that the new approach also yielded some benefits, concluding that &quot;lapses notwithstanding, it&#x27;s still one of the best rides in town.&quot;

<doc id="1091076" wikidata="Q4912668" url="?curid=1091076" title="Billy Hardy">
<text>Billy Hardy (born 5 September 1964 in Sunderland) is a former bantamweight and featherweight boxer champion. He held the British championship at bantamweight and featherweight, as well as the European and Commonwealth featherweight titles.

The Billy Hardy Sports Centre, in Castletown, Sunderland bears his name.

He started boxing when he was six or seven, at the Hylton Castle Boys Club. He was an aggressive boxer who liked to come forward and take the fight to his opponent.

Being a dedicated fan of Sunderland Football Club, Hardy normally fought wearing red and white striped shorts, the club colours.

==Professional career==
He had his first professional fight in November 1983, beating Kevin Downer on points over six rounds at Eltham, Kent.

===British bantamweight title===
He built up a record of thirteen wins and three defeats before fighting for the British bantamweight title against the holder Ray Gilbody. The title fight was in February 1987 in St Helens and Hardy took the title when the fight was stopped in the fourth, Gilbody having been down four times.

In March 1988, he defended his British title against John Hyland in his hometown of Sunderland, knocking the challenger out in the second round.

In November 1988, he fought the Italian, Vincenzo Belcastro for the European bantamweight title. The fight was in Paola, Italy and Hardy lost a narrow points decision after twelve rounds.

In February 1989, he successfully defended his British title against Ronnie Carroll in Sunderland, winning on points.

In June 1989, he had a re-match with Belcastro for the European title. The fight was in Pavia, Italy, and this time the decision was even closer, being declared as a draw.

In October 1989, he defended his British title against Brian Holmes, in Sunderland. Hardy made short work of the challenger, knocking him out in the first round.

===IBF bantamweight attempts===
Hardy&#x27;s impressive record at bantamweight had put him in line for a shot at the IBF world bantamweight title, held by the American, Orlando Canizales. The challenge was in January 1990 at the Crowtree Leisure Centre, Sunderland, and it went the full twelve rounds with Canizales retaining his title on a split decision.

In November 1990, Hardy defended his British title for the third time, again against Ronnie Carroll. This time the fight was stopped in the eighth with Hardy retaining his title.

In May 1991, Hardy had a re-match with Orlando Conizares, who so narrowly defeated him the previous year. This time the fight was in Canizares’ hometown of Laredo, Texas, and the champion won on a technical knockout in the eighth round. Hardy had also been knocked down in round three.

===Featherweight titles===
Hardy relinquished his British bantamweight title in 1991. In October 1992, he moved up a weight, when he fought Australian, Ricky Rayner for the vacant Commonwealth featherweight title. The fight was in Sunderland, and Hardy won the title when the fight was stopped in the tenth.

In May 1993, he defended his Commonwealth title in Sunderland, against Canadian Barrington Francis, winning on points.

In May 1994, he fought Alan McKay, a southpaw from Watford. The fight, in Sunderland, was for Hardy&#x27;s Commonwealth title and the vacant British featherweight title. The fight was stopped in the eighth with Hardy now the holder of both titles. Later in the year, Hardy relinquished the British title.

In October 1994, he defended his Commonwealth title in Sun City, South Africa, against local challenger Stanford Ngcebeshe. Hardy won on points over twelve rounds.

In February 1995, he made a further defence, in Sunderland, against Percy Commey, of Ghana. Hardy won by a technical knockout in the eleventh round.

===European title===
In October 1995, Hardy challenged for the European featherweight title. He fought in Fontenay-sous-Bois, near Paris, against the Algerian holder, Mehdi Labdouni. Hardy won on points over twelve rounds to take the title.

In February 1996, he defended his Commonwealth title against English boxer, Michael Alldis, winning on points.

In June 1996, he defended his European title in Sanremo, Italy against Stefanno Zoff, winning on points.

In February 1997, Hardy defended his European title against Welsh boxer, Steve Robinson, who had held the WBO world featherweight title before losing it to Naseem Hamed. The fight, in Sunderland, was dominated by Hardy, and he claimed a points decision.

===WBO and IBF featherweight attempt===
In May 1997, Hardy had his biggest fight, when he challenged for the WBO and IBF world featherweight titles held by fellow Englishman, Naseem Hamed. The fight was held in Manchester and many of Hardy&#x27;s fans travelled from Sunderland to support him. He tried to take the fight to Hamed but paid the price, when he was caught by a right-hand that broke his nose and his cheekbone. Hardy was knocked down twice, and the fight was stopped after only 93 seconds.

===Remaining career===
In January 1998, he defended his European title against Algerian, Mehdi Labdouni at York Hall, Bethnal Green, winning on points to retain the title.

In September 1998, Hardy had his last fight, when he defended his European and Commonwealth titles against Yorkshireman, Paul Ingle, former holder of the IBF world featherweight title. The fight was in York, and Hardy started well, but was caught in the eighth round, and the fight was stopped.

Following this defeat, Hardy retired aged thirty-four.

<text>Al-Mundhir (; c. 842 – 888) was Emir of Córdoba from 886 to 888. He was a member of the Umayyad dynasty of Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia), the son of Muhamad bin Abd al-Rahman.

==Biography==

Born in Córdoba, during the reign of his father he commanded the military operations against the neighbouring Christian kingdoms and the Muwallad rebellions.

In 865 he led the partially failed campaign against King Ordoño I of Asturias, in the Duero valley. On his way back to Córdoba, he defeated Rodrigo, count of Castile, at Burgos, pushing the Cordoban frontier northwards. He also tried to conquer León, but he was defeated in 878 at Valdemora, by king Alfonso III of Asturias.

Al-Mundhir launched an expedition against the Banu Qasi Muwallad family, who had allied with Alfonso III, but was again defeated in 883. The following year he was, however, able to expel the rebel emir Ibn Marwan from Badajoz.

In 886, upon his father&#x27;s death, he inherited the throne of Córdoba. During the two years of his reign al-Mundhir continued the fight against the rebel Umar ibn Hafsun. He died in 888 at Bobastro, possibly murdered by his brother Abdullah ibn Muhammad al-Umawi, who succeeded him.

<text>João Pereira dos Santos (27 December 1917 – 9 December 2011), known as Mestre João Pequeno was capoeira Angola mestre and one of the principal students of mestre Pastinha.

He began his carrier in Capoeira as a student of Mestre Gilvenson and later became a disciple of Mestre Pastinha - the father of contemporary Capoeira Angola. Together with Mestre João Grande he is later to share the honour of being one of the late Mestre Pastinha&#x27;s two most learned students - the ones to whom he entrusted his legacy. Mestre João Pequeno died on 9 December 2011 at the age of 93.

In 1970, Mestre Pastinha said the following about João Pequeno, &quot;He will be the greatest Capoeira players of the future and I have worked hard with him, and for him, to achieve this. He will be a true master. Not just impromptu teacher, as can be found anywhere, who only destroy our tradition which is so beautiful. I&#x27;ve taught everything I know to this young man. Even the Cat&#x27;s Leap (lit. Pulo do gato, the one move that is kept to oneself to use in dire circumstances. It is usually never taught to anyone, to keep its element of surprise). That&#x27;s why I have the greatest hopes regarding their future.&quot;

==The recession of 1973==
During the recession of the late 70s (&quot;See Oil Crisis of 1973&quot;), Capoeira Mestres and dedicated practitioners amongst the populace faced great hardships to continue the practice of their beloved art. Many of them died poor and hungry. Those who were able to, chose to migrate to other countries in search of greener pastures. Many Capoeira schools couldn&#x27;t survive. However the most significant loss of the time, was to be the closing down of Pastinha&#x27;s Capoeira academy (&quot;Centro Esportivo de Capoeira Angola&quot;) and his death in 1981.

The impact of Pastinha&#x27;s death was far reaching and even João Grande chose to stop playing Capoeira for a time (&quot;See Mestre João Grande&quot;). Despite these events, João Pequeno persevered these difficult years, biding his time to revive Pastinha&#x27;s school.

==Revival of Pastinha&#x27;s academy==
On 2 May 1982, with the world barely starting to recover from the recession, João Pequeno founded the &quot;Academia de João Pequeno de Pastinha&quot; with the purpose of continuing the lineage teaching of Capoeira Angola in the manner it was taught in Mestre Pastinha&#x27;s academy. This lineage was very nearly destroyed when Pastinha&#x27;s academy was closed down by the government to &quot;renovate&quot; the buildings. The subsequent death almost a decade later of the great Angoleiro only made things more difficult. (&quot;See Mestre Pastinha&quot;).

The authenticity of João Pequeno&#x27;s academy in following Pastinha&#x27;s academy was not limited exclusively to the technique and teaching methods, but also in the manner of spiritual and cultural development. In a way, João Pequeno revived and succeeded in achieving the original purpose for which Pastinha&#x27;s &quot;Centro Esportivo de Capoeira Angola&quot; was established - that is, to preserve and promote the traditions of Capoeira Angola, the fundamental tenets of the Angoleiro and to provide a community based support for Capoeiristas.

His old friend and Capoeira brother, João Grande later did the same by establishing his academy in New York City the United States in 1990.

Lineage

Pastinha → João Pequeno

==Later life and death==
Mestre João Pequeno dedicated his life to teaching Pastinha&#x27;s style of Capoeira Angola ever since and has graduated students who today are well-known Mestres in their own right. Into his 90s, Joao Pequeno continued to teach and practise capoeira at his academy in &quot;Forte de Santo Antônio Além do Carmo&quot; which has, through the work of Mestre João and GCAP, come to be called the &quot;Forte da Capoeira&quot; which is off to the north side of the historical center of Salvador, Bahia which is also called Pelourinho. Mestre João Pequeno died on 9 December 2011, at the age of 93.

<doc id="1091088" wikidata="Q307680" url="?curid=1091088" title="Abdullah of Córdoba">
<text>Abd Allah ibn Muhammad ibn Abd al-Rahman (; 844 – 912) was the seventh emir of Córdoba, reigning from 888 to 912 in Al-Andalus (Islamic Iberia).

==Biography==
Contemporary historians accused Abdullah of orchestrating the death of his half-brother, al-Mundhir, whereby he ascended to power. 

The most formidable threat for the emir was Umar Ibn Hafsun, who had conquered the provinces of Reyyo (including Bobastro), Elvira (including Granada) and Jaén, and had allied with the populations of Archidona, Baeza, Úbeda and Priego. In 891 Ibn Hafsun was defeated near the castle of Polei and lost several cities. However, by the following year Ibn Hafsun had already recovered, and reconquered all the lost territories.

In 911, the emir signed a peace agreement with Ibn Hafsun. However, the war broke out again the following year, only to be halted by the death of Abdullah at Córdoba, who was improving his positions. He was succeeded by his grandson, Abd al-Rahman III.

==Family==
Abdullah was the son of Muhammad I and the younger brother of al-Mundhir.

Around 863, Abdullah married Onneca Fortúnez, daughter of Fortún Garcés, King of Pamplona and his wife Aurea (Orea). She was repudiated sometime before 880 and returned to the Kingdom of Pamplona, most probably with her father who returned that year, and took her cousin Aznar Sánchez of Larraun as her second husband with whom she had at least three children, including Queen Toda of Navarre who was, therefore, the aunt of Abd al-Rahman III.

Abdullah had several children:
* Muhammed ibn Abd Allah (864 – 28 Jan 891). Recorded to be a son of Onneca. He was murdered by his brother al-Mutarrif (with the approval of their father). He married a Basque or Frankish woman named Muzna. They were the parents of Abd al-Rahman III who was born three weeks after his father&#x27;s death.

<text>Shake It Up is the fourth studio album by American new wave band the Cars, released on November 6, 1981, by Elektra Records. It was the last Cars record to be produced by Roy Thomas Baker. A much more pop-oriented album than its predecessor, its title track became the band&#x27;s first &quot;Billboard&quot; top-10 single. &quot;Spin&quot; magazine included it on their &quot;50 Best Albums of 1981&quot; list. 

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that &quot;Ric Ocasek and the boys have produced an understated and decidedly underwhelming package that makes no attempt to deviate from their patented, semi-robotic pop.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; deemed the album &quot;a conservative, cautious work that breaks no new ground.&quot;

<doc id="1091093" wikidata="Q2119408" url="?curid=1091093" title="Lath and plaster">
<text>Lath and plaster is a building process used to finish mainly interior dividing walls and ceilings. It consists of narrow strips of wood (laths) which are nailed horizontally across the wall studs or ceiling joists and then coated in plaster. The technique derives from an earlier, more primitive process called wattle and daub.

Lath and plaster largely fell out of favour in the U.K. after the introduction of plasterboard in the 1930s. In Canada and the United States, wood lath and plaster remained in use until the process was replaced by transitional methods followed by drywall (the North American term for plasterboard) in the mid-twentieth century.

==Description==
The wall or ceiling finishing process begins with wood or metal laths. These are narrow strips of wood, extruded metal, or split boards, nailed horizontally across the wall studs or ceiling joists. Each wall frame is covered in lath, tacked at the studs. Wood lath is typically about wide by long by thick. Each horizontal course of lath is spaced about away from its neighboring courses. Metal lath is available in by sheets.

In Canada and the United States the laths were generally sawn, but in the United Kingdom and its colonies, riven or split hardwood laths of random lengths and sizes were often used. Early American examples featured split beam construction, as did examples put up in rural areas of the U.S. and Canada well into the second half of the 19th century. Splitting the timber along its grain greatly improved the laths&#x27; strength and durability. As Americans and Canadians expanded west, saw mills were not always available to create neatly planed boards and the first crop of buildings in any new western or northern settlement would be put up with split beam lath. In some areas of the U.K. reed mat was also used as a lath.

Temporary lath guides are then placed vertically to the wall, usually at the studs. Lime or gypsum plaster is then applied, typically using a wooden board as the application tool. The applier drags the board upward over the wall, forcing the plaster into the gaps between the lath and leaving a layer on the front the depth of the temporary guides, typically about . A helper feeds new plaster onto the board, as the plaster is applied in quantity. When the wall is fully covered, the vertical lath &quot;guides&quot; are removed, and their &quot;slots&quot; are filled in, leaving a fairly uniform undercoat.

In three coat plastering it is standard to apply a second layer in the same fashion, leaving about of rough, sandy plaster (called a &quot;brown coat&quot; or &quot;browning&quot; (UK)). A smooth, white finish coat goes on last. After the plaster is completely dry, the walls are ready to be painted. In this article&#x27;s photo (&quot;lath seen from the back...&quot;) the curls of plaster are called &quot;keys&quot; and are necessary to keep the plaster on the lath. Traditional lime based mortar/plaster often incorporates horsehair which reinforces the plasterwork, thereby helping to prevent the keys from breaking away.

==Historical transition==
In addition to wood lath, various types of metal lath began to be used toward the end of the 19th century. Metal lath is categorized according to weight, type of ribbing, and whether the lath is galvanized or not. Metal lathing was spaced across a center, attached by tie wires using lathers&#x27; nippers. Sometimes, the mesh was dimpled to be self-furring.

In use as early as 1900, rock lath (also known as &quot;button board,&quot; &quot;plaster board&quot; or &quot;gypsum-board lath&quot;), is a type of gypsum wall board (essentially an early form of drywall) with holes spaced regularly to provide a &#x27;key&#x27; for wet plaster. Rock lath was typically produced in sheets sized . The purpose of the four-foot length is so that the sheet of lath exactly spans three interstud voids (overlapping half a stud at each end of a four-stud sequence in standard construction), the studs themselves being spaced apart on center (United States building code standard measurements). By the late 1930s, rock lath was the primary method used in residential plastering.

Lath and plaster methods have mostly been replaced with modern drywall or plasterboard, which is faster and less expensive to install. Drywall possesses poor sound dampening qualities and can be easily damaged by moisture. Traditional lime based plasters are resistant to moisture and provide excellent sound isolation.

==Advantages==
One continued advantage of using traditional lath is for ornamental or unusual shapes. For instance, building a rounded wall would be difficult if drywall were used exclusively, as drywall is not flexible enough to allow tight radii. Wire mesh, often used for exterior stucco, is also found in combination or replacement of lath and plaster which serves similar purpose.

Traditional lath and plaster (including rock and metal lath varieties) has superior sound-proofing qualities when used with lime or gypsum plaster, which is denser than modern drywall.

In many historic buildings lath and plaster ceilings play a major role for the prevention of fire spread. They are critical to the protection of horizontal elements such as timber joisted floors, including the flooring on top, which in terms of fire performance is often in a poor condition due to the presence of gaps.

<doc id="1091094" wikidata="Q2945491" url="?curid=1091094" title="Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre">
<text>The Woomera Immigration Reception and Processing Centre (IRPC) was an Australian immigration detention facility near the village of Woomera in South Australia. It was opened in November 1999 in response to an increase in unauthorised arrivals, which had exceeded the capacity of other detention facilities. It was originally intended to hold 400 people, however at its peak in April 2000 it had nearly 1,500 detainees. After ongoing public pressure in response to several well publicised riots from 2000, accusations of human rights abuses, and capacity issues, the centre closed in April 2003.

The site was rebuilt during 2003, and then handed back to the Australian Department of Defence. The facility was renamed &quot;Camp Rapier&quot; in 2004 and has only supported Defence activities on the Woomera Test Range since that time.

For much of its time in operation, the facility was an immigration detention centre, it was run by Australasian Correctional Management (ACM), a subsidiary of Wackenhut Security Corporation, under a contract with the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. ACM was criticised over various practices, including failing to staff the Centre adequately, and concealing evidence of child abuse.

==Background to the creation of the facility==

During the early 1990s the Keating government enforced a policy of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals. All non-citizens arriving by boat without a valid visa were detained until they were either granted a visa, or deported.

Towards the end of the 1990s, a large increase in the number of unauthorised arrivals exceeded the capacity of the existing Immigration Reception and Processing Centres at Port Hedland and Curtin. The former, and at that time unused, &#x27;Woomera West Construction Camp&#x27; was converted into an immigration detention facility in 1999, and the Woomera IRPC was opened to accommodate this increase.

==Operation of the Woomera facility==
The centre was opened in November 1999, with a capacity of 400. This capacity was very quickly exceeded, as the boat arrivals continued. Nursing and administrative staff working there at the time complained that facilities were totally inadequate, and that it was impossible to provide proper medical care. Management of the centre has been criticised for not providing adequate training to staff for confrontations. This resulted in psychological problems for staff including post-traumatic stress, marriage breakdowns, and in some cases, suicide attempts.

Most detainees applied for refugee status, and had no possibility for release until their claim had been finalised. Men, women, and children were detained at the centre. The highest number of children detained at any one time was 456, out of a total population of 1442, on 1 September 2001. As at 26 December 2003, the average length of detention for children was one year, 8 months, and 11 days. An unaccompanied child refugee had this to say:

:&quot;I believe you [Australians] are nice people, peace seekers, you support unity. If you come to see us behind the fence, think about how you would feel. Are you aware of what happens here? Come and see our life. I wonder whether if the Government of Iran created camp like Woomera and Australians had seen pictures of it, if they would have given people a visa to come to Australia then.&quot;

In June 2000, there were two days of protests. Approximately 480 detainees broke out and walked into the township. In August 2000 there were three days of riots and fires; 60–80 detainees were involved, and tear gas and water cannons were used. 32 staff were injured during this riot. In November 2000, there was a hunger strike involving more than 30 detainees, some of whom were force fed in hospital. Throughout 2001, there were repeated riots and confrontations between ACM guards and detainees, with water cannons and tear gas often used as deterrents.

During 2002 there were a number of riots, hunger strikes, and lip-sewing, which included children. In January 2002, over 200 detainees started a hunger strike, while some threatened suicide in violent ways, some consuming poisons such as shampoos. Refugee advocates (such as the Woomera Lawyers Group and RASSA) argued that this showed the desperation of detainees. The refugees complained that conditions were harsh, that it took up to three years for their claims to be processed, and that processing their claims had been suspended.

There had been similar protests before, but the 2002 protests were taken up by the national and international media and by national and international organisations. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees felt Australia should reconsider its policy. Mary Robinson the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights was first denied access to the Woomera IRPC but later the Australian Government yielded to pressure.

==Breakout==
Over the Easter holiday of 2002, about 1000 protesters gathered at the gates of Woomera to voice their opposition to the mandatory detention of refugees. About 40 refugees escaped from the centre during this protest. Most were captured over the coming hours and subsequently deported, but some made it out of the desert, though some were reported to the police and later deported, and at least one was granted a temporary protection visa.

==Approved for visas==
80% of those detained over the years have been found to be genuine refugees, the majority being issued with a temporary protection visa.

==Closure==
The centre was closed in April 2003, and all remaining detainees were transferred to Baxter Immigration Reception and Processing Centre. With the hand back of the Woomera facilities to Defence as part of the wider upgrade of the Woomera Test Range, Woomera will not be used again as any form of IRPC as the facility is now part of the Test Range itself.

==Further controversy==
The detention centre was a source of much controversy during its time of operation. There were a number of riots and escapes, as well as accusations of human rights abuses from groups as diverse as refugee advocates, Amnesty International, the Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, ChilOut, Human Rights Watch, and the United Nations, although no charges have ever been laid against any person against such public accusations.

In March 2002, the Secretary General of Amnesty International, Irene Khan, said:

:&quot;It is obvious that the prolonged periods of detention, characterised by frustration and insecurity, are doing further damage to individuals who have fled grave human rights abuses. The detention policy has failed as a deterrent and succeeded only as punishment. How much longer will children and their families be punished for seeking safety from persecution?&quot;

Throughout the controversy, then-Prime Minister John Howard and successive immigration ministers maintained that their actions at Woomera were justified in the interests of protecting Australia&#x27;s borders and ensuring that immigration law was enforced. A 2004 Liberal Party election policy document stated:

:&quot;The Coalition Government&#x27;s tough stance on people smuggling stems from the core belief that Australia has the right to decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come. Deterrence has been achieved through excision, boat returns, offshore processing and mandatory detention.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The centre is the subject of a video game, &quot;Escape From Woomera&quot;, an unfinished point-and-click adventure video game, intended to criticise the treatment of mandatorily detained asylum seekers in Australia, as well as the Australian government&#x27;s attempt to impose a media blackout on the detention centres.

It is also the subject of a play, &quot;Woomera&quot;, which tells the story of Justin, a young prison guard recently arrived at the detention centre.

<text>Heartbeat City is the fifth studio album by American new wave band the Cars, released on March 13, 1984, by Elektra Records. This marks the band&#x27;s first album not produced by long-time producer Roy Thomas Baker, instead opting to produce with Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. Considered a &quot;comeback&quot; album for the Cars, &quot;Heartbeat City&quot; represented a return to the success of the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album.

Music critic Robert Christgau noted that &quot;the glossy approach the Cars invented has made this the best year for pure pop in damn near twenty years, and it&#x27;s only fair that they should return so confidently to form.&quot; Numerous tracks from the album received airplay on modern rock and AOR stations, with the singles &quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;You Might Think&quot; reaching the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, while the album peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

==Background and release==
&quot;Heartbeat City&quot; was recorded at Battery Studios in London with producer Mutt Lange. The band followed a method where the keyboards, guitars and vocals were recorded first to a LinnDrum click track, then the bass and drums were added. According to drummer David Robinson, all the drums and keyboards were sampled into and played or programmed via the Fairlight CMI, which he felt gave &quot;a much better, cleaner, more controllable sound&quot; for the album.
&quot;Heartbeat City&quot; spawned six singles. &quot;Drive&quot; and &quot;You Might Think&quot; reached the top 10 of the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at numbers three and seven, respectively. A number of songs from the album gained significant radio and television exposure, notably &quot;Drive&quot;, &quot;You Might Think&quot; and &quot;Magic&quot;, which all received heavy rotation on MTV. The title track served as the album&#x27;s sixth and final single outside North America.

The lead vocals on &quot;Drive&quot; were performed by bassist Benjamin Orr. The song&#x27;s video was directed by actor Timothy Hutton and features Ric Ocasek arguing with a troubled young woman played by model Paulina Porizkova (whom Ocasek would later marry). &quot;Hello Again&quot; had a video directed by Andy Warhol, who also appeared onscreen.

Despite not being released as a single, &quot;It&#x27;s Not the Night&quot; reached number 31 on the Top Rock Tracks chart. The song &quot;Stranger Eyes&quot; was used in the theatrical trailer of the 1986 film &quot;Top Gun&quot;, but never made it onto the soundtrack. &quot;Looking for Love&quot; was covered by Austrian singer Falco as &quot;Munich Girls&quot; on his 1985 album &quot;Falco 3&quot;.

When the Cars performed at Live Aid, they played three songs from the album (&quot;You Might Think&quot;, &quot;Drive&quot;, and the album&#x27;s title track), alongside the fan favorite &quot;Just What I Needed&quot;.

The album was produced by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange. His commitment to the Cars&#x27; album meant that he told Def Leppard he could not work on their album &quot;Hysteria&quot;. However, due to delays in that album&#x27;s recording, Lange was eventually able to produce it.

==Artwork==
The cover art (including an image of a 1971 Plymouth Duster 340 and an Alberto Vargas pin-up model) is from a 1972 piece by Peter Phillips called &quot;Art-O-Matic Loop di Loop&quot;.

===Notes===
* &quot;Stranger Eyes&quot; is titled &quot;Stranger&quot; on the label of early US vinyl pressings, though the title is listed as &quot;Stranger Eyes&quot; on the inner sleeve.
* &quot;Heartbeat City&quot; is titled &quot;Jacki&quot; on the inner sleeve of early US vinyl pressings, though the title is listed (correctly) as &quot;Heartbeat City&quot; on the label. On early cassette versions, the track is titled &quot;Jacki&quot; on the cassette insert, but as &quot;Heartbeat City&quot; on the actual tape.

<doc id="1091100" wikidata="Q254515" url="?curid=1091100" title="Similitude">
<text>Similitude is a concept applicable to the testing of engineering models. A model is said to have &quot;similitude&quot; with the real application if the two share geometric similarity, kinematic similarity and dynamic similarity. &quot;Similarity&quot; and &quot;similitude&quot; are interchangeable in this context.
The term dynamic similitude is often used as a catch-all because it implies that geometric and kinematic similitude have already been met.

Similitude&#x27;s main application is in hydraulic and aerospace engineering to test fluid flow conditions with scaled models. It is also the primary theory behind many textbook formulas in fluid mechanics.

The concept of similitude is strongly tied to dimensional analysis.

== Overview ==
Engineering models are used to study complex fluid dynamics problems where calculations and computer simulations aren&#x27;t reliable. Models are usually smaller than the final design, but not always. Scale models allow testing of a design prior to building, and in many cases are a critical step in the development process.

Construction of a scale model, however, must be accompanied by an analysis to determine what conditions it is tested under. While the geometry may be simply scaled, other parameters, such as pressure, temperature or the velocity and type of fluid may need to be altered. Similitude is achieved when testing conditions are created such that the test results are applicable to the real design.

The following criteria are required to achieve similitude;
*Geometric similarity – the model is the same shape as the application, usually scaled.
*Kinematic similarity – fluid flow of both the model and real application must undergo similar time rates of change motions. (fluid streamlines are similar)
*Dynamic similarity – ratios of all forces acting on corresponding fluid particles and boundary surfaces in the two systems are constant.

To satisfy the above conditions the application is analyzed; 
# All parameters required to describe the system are identified using principles from continuum mechanics.
# Dimensional analysis is used to express the system with as few independent variables and as many dimensionless parameters as possible.
# The values of the dimensionless parameters are held to be the same for both the scale model and application. This can be done because they are &quot;dimensionless&quot; and will ensure dynamic similitude between the model and the application. The resulting equations are used to derive &quot;scaling laws&quot; which dictate model testing conditions.

It is often impossible to achieve strict similitude during a model test. The greater the departure from the application&#x27;s operating conditions, the more difficult achieving similitude is. In these cases some aspects of similitude may be neglected, focusing on only the most important parameters.

The design of marine vessels remains more of an art than a science in
large part because dynamic similitude is especially difficult to attain
for a vessel that is partially submerged: a ship is affected by wind
forces in the air above it, by hydrodynamic forces within the water
under it, and especially by wave motions at the interface between the
water and the air. The scaling requirements for each of these
phenomena differ, so models cannot replicate what happens to a full
sized vessel nearly so well as can be done for an aircraft or
submarine—each of which operates entirely within one medium.

Similitude is a term used widely in fracture mechanics relating to the strain life approach. Under given loading conditions the fatigue damage in an un-notched specimen is comparable to that of a notched specimen. Similitude suggests that the component fatigue life of the two objects will also be similar.

== An example ==
Consider a submarine modeled at 1/40th scale. The application operates in sea water at 0.5 °C, moving at 5 m/s. The model will be tested in fresh water at 20 °C. Find the power required for the submarine to operate at the stated speed.

A free body diagram is constructed and the relevant relationships of force and velocity are formulated using techniques from continuum mechanics. The variables which describe the system are:

This example has five independent variables and three fundamental units. The fundamental units are: meter, kilogram, second.

Invoking the Buckingham π theorem shows that the system can be described with two dimensionless numbers and one independent variable.

Dimensional analysis is used to rearrange the units to form the Reynolds number (formula_1) and pressure coefficient (formula_2). These dimensionless numbers account for all the variables listed above except &quot;F&quot;, which will be the test measurement. Since the dimensionless parameters will stay constant for both the test and the real application, they will be used to formulate scaling laws for the test.

Scaling laws:

:formula_3

The pressure (formula_4) is not one of the five variables, but the force (formula_5) is. The pressure difference (Δformula_4) has thus been replaced with (formula_7) in the pressure coefficient. This gives a required test velocity of:

:formula_8 .

A model test is then conducted at that velocity and the force that is measured in the model (formula_9) is then scaled to find the force that can be expected for the real application (formula_10):

:formula_11

The power formula_12 in watts required by the submarine is then:

:formula_13

Note that even though the model is scaled smaller, the water velocity needs to be increased for testing. This remarkable result shows how similitude in nature is often counterintuitive.

== Typical applications ==
===Fluid mechanics===
Similitude has been well documented for a large number of engineering problems and is the basis of many textbook formulas and dimensionless quantities. These formulas and quantities are easy to use without having to repeat the laborious task of dimensional analysis and formula derivation. Simplification of the formulas (by neglecting some aspects of similitude) is common, and needs to be reviewed by the engineer for each application.

Similitude can be used to predict the performance of a new design based on data from an existing, similar design. In this case, the model is the existing design. Another use of similitude and models is in validation of computer simulations with the ultimate goal of eliminating the need for physical models altogether.

Another application of similitude is to replace the operating fluid with a different test fluid. Wind tunnels, for example, have trouble with air liquefying in certain conditions so helium is sometimes used. Other applications may operate in dangerous or expensive fluids so the testing is carried out in a more convenient substitute.

Some common applications of similitude and associated dimensionless numbers;
===Solid mechanics: structural similitude===
Similitude analysis is a powerful engineering tool to design the scaled-down structures. Although both dimensional analysis and direct use of the governing equations may be used to derive the scaling laws, the latter results in more specific scaling laws. The design of the scaled-down composite structures can be successfully carried out using the complete and partial similarities. In the design of the scaled structures under complete similarity condition, all the derived scaling laws must be satisfied between the model and prototype which yields the perfect similarity between the two scales. However, the design of a scaled-down structure which is perfectly similar to its prototype has the practical limitation, especially for laminated structures. Relaxing some of the scaling laws may eliminate the limitation of the design under complete similarity condition and yields the scaled models that are partially similar to their prototype. However, the design of the scaled structures under the partial similarity condition must follow a deliberate methodology to ensure the accuracy of the scaled structure in predicting the structural response of the prototype. Scaled models can be designed to replicate the dynamic characteristic (e.g. frequencies, mode shapes and damping ratios) of their full-scale counterparts. However, appropriate response scaling laws need to be derived to predict the dynamic response of the full-scale prototype from the experimental data of the scaled model.

<text>Hisham II or Abu&#x27;l-Walid Hisham II al-Mu&#x27;ayyad bi-llah (, Abū&#x27;l-Walīd Hishām al-Muʾayyad bi-ʾllāh) (son of Al-Hakam II and Subh of Córdoba) was the third Umayyad Caliph of Spain, in Al-Andalus from 976 to 1009, and from 1010 to 1013.

==Reign== 

In 976, at the age of 10, Hisham II succeeded his father Al-Hakam II as Caliph of Cordoba. Hisham II was a minor at the time of his accession and therefore was unfit to rule. In order to benefit the Caliphate, his mother Subh was aided by first minister Jafar al-Mushafi to act as regents with al-Mansur ibn Abi Aamir (better known as &quot;Almanzor&quot;) as her steward. In 978 Almanzor manipulated his way into the position of royal chamberlain. In an attempt to position himself as a prospective ruler of the Caliphate, Almanzor and General Ghalib al-Siklabi sabotaged the brother of Al-Hakam II who was set to succeed his brother and become the next Caliph of Cordoba. Still too young to rule, Hisham II handed the reins of power over to Almanzor in 981, who became the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Caliphate until his death in 1002. Al-Mansur ibn Abi Amir perpetuated his position as the omnipotent ruler in charge of the empire while he exiled Hisham II and essentially kept him prisoner for most of his reign as the third Caliph of Cordoba. With his countless successful campaigns against Christian powers in the Spanish North such as Barcelona in 985, León in 988, as well as a major strike on the church of St. James in the Galician city of Santiago de Compostela in 998, Almanzor is known for bringing the Caliphate of Córdoba to its apex of power in Islamic Iberian history.

In 1002, after the death of his father (Almanzor), Abd al-Malik (1002–1008) became the ruler of the Caliphate and led successful campaigns against Navarre and Barcelona. In 1008 Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo (1008–1009) is said to have poisoned his brother (Abd al-Malik al-Muzaffar) which led to his death in October 1008. In 1009, while Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo was waging war against Alfonso V in León, Muhammad II al-Mahdi usurped the throne from Hisham II then held him hostage in Cordoba. In November of the same year, just months after initiating his control as the ruler of the Caliphate, Muhammad II al-Mahdi was overthrown by a primarily Berber army (that he had previously commanded, but by which he was later abandoned) which was led by Sulayman ibn al-Hakam in the battle of Alcolea. After the battle, Abd al-Rahman Sanchuelo was exiled to Toledo at which point Sulayman laid siege to Cordoba freeing Hisham II from the imprisonment that took place under the rule of Muhammad II al-Mahdi. Sulayman ibn al-Hakam was appointed to Caliph by his Berber army and maintained that position until Muhammad II al-Mahdi re-conquered the territory in May, 1010. Finally the Slavic troops of the Caliphate under al-Wahdid restored Hisham II as Caliph (1010–1013).

Hisham II was now under the influence of al-Wahdid, who was nevertheless unable to gain control of the Berber troops – these still supported Sulayman, and the civil war continued. In 1013 the Berbers took Cordoba with much plundering and destruction. What happened to Hisham after that is uncertain – supposedly he was killed on 19 April 1013 by the Berbers. In any case, Sulayman al-Mustaʿin (1013–1016) became Caliph.

==Revival under the taifa kings==
Due to his disappearance, and hence his possible survival, Hisham II was revived as a symbol of legitimacy by the taifa kings who appeared following the definitive collapse of the caliphate: in 1035, the ruler of the Taifa of Seville, Abu al-Qasim Muhammad ibn Abbad, announced that Hisham had reappeared, and declared his allegiance to him. Other taifas falling under Seville&#x27;s sway during the following years followed suit. It was not until 1060 that the Sevillan ruler Abbad II al-Mu&#x27;tadid acknowledged that this supposed Hisham had died in 1044 without a successor, but the &quot;convenient fiction&quot; of his survival lasted until at least 1082–83, when his name still appears in the coins of the Taifa of Zaragoza.

<doc id="1091104" wikidata="Q26998028" url="?curid=1091104" title="Cytochalasin B">
<text>Cytochalasin B, the name of which comes from the Greek &quot;cytos&quot; (cell) and &quot;chalasis&quot; (relaxation), is a cell-permeable mycotoxin. It was found that substoichiometric concentrations of cytochalasin B (CB) strongly inhibit network formation by actin filaments. Due to this, it is often used in cytological research. It inhibits cytoplasmic division by blocking the formation of contractile microfilaments. It inhibits cell movement and induces nuclear extrusion. Cytochalasin B shortens actin filaments by blocking monomer addition at the fast-growing end of polymers. Cytochalasin B inhibits glucose transport and platelet aggregation. It blocks adenosine-induced apoptotic body formation without affecting activation of endogenous ADP-ribosylation in leukemia HL-60 cells.
It is also used in cloning through nuclear transfer. Here enucleated recipient cells are treated with cytochalasin B. Cytochalasin B makes the cytoplasm of the oocytes more fluid and makes it possible to aspirate the nuclear genome of the oocyte within a small vesicle of plasma membrane into a micro-needle. Thereby, the oocyte genome is removed from the oocyte, while preventing rupture of the plasma membrane.

This alkaloid is isolated from a fungus, &quot;Helminthosporium dematioideum&quot;.

==History==

===1960s===
Cytochalasin B was first described in 1967, when it had been isolated from moulds by Dr W.B. Turner. Smith et al. found that CB causes multinucleation in cells and significantly affects cell motility. The multinucleated cells probably arise from failure of mitotic control, leading to variations in size and shape of interphase nuclei.

=== 1970s ===
In the 1970s, research on the mitosis of polynucleated cells was done. It appeared that these cells were created through progressive nuclear addition instead of nuclear division. The process by which this occurs is called pseudomitosis, which is the synchronous mitosis resulting in the division of just one nucleus. The separate nuclei are bound by a nuclear bridge and in binucleated cells the centrioles are doubled.
Furthermore, it was found that CB causes the disorganization of the 50Å microfilaments of mouse epithelial cells which causes the cells to lose their shape. It also affects the appearance of young glands in cells and new gland formation in other cells.
Another group found that CB inhibits the ability of HeLa cells to undergo cytokinesis by decomposition of the contractile ring.
Research from 1971 showed that CB interferes with the release of iodine derived from thyroglobulin and blocks colloid endocytosis. Moreover, it was found that CB has an inhibitory effect on the uptake of sucrose-3H by chang-strain human liver cells and in CB-treated cells alterations in the appearance and location of microfilaments were observed. Furthermore, it was found that CB reversibly inhibits melanin granule movement in melanocytes.
One year later, research on the influence of cytochalasin B on chloroplasts was done. It was found that the light-oriented movement of chloroplasts is reversibly inhibited by cytochalasin B.
In 1973 researches found that cytochalasin B is a powerful non-competitive inhibitor of glucose transport. One of the major electrophoretic identifiable erythrocyte membrane proteins may be the cytochalasin B binding site of erythrocytes.

=== From 1980 ===
In the following years, the knowledge concerning cytochalasin B was broadened. As the more general knowledge had been elucidated, more detailed analysis of e.g. the mechanism of action took place.

== Production ==
Cytochalasins can be isolated from the fungi in which they naturally occur. Originally, they were isolated from &quot;Helminthosporium dematioideum&quot;. Other producers include &quot;Phoma&quot; spp., &quot;Hormiscium&quot; spp. and &quot;Curvularia lunata&quot;.
Additionally, it can be synthesized in the laboratory. There are several approaches to do so. Firstly, it is possible to form the six-membered ring of the isoindolone core and the larger macrocyclic ring simultaneously in a late-stage intramolecular Diels-Alder cyclization. Secondly, it is possible to first form the isoindolone core in an intermolecular Diels-Alder reaction and in a second step append the macrocycle in a stepwise fashion.

== Properties ==
Cytochalasin B contains several highly polar keto- and hydroxyl groups and one peripheric lipophilic benzyl unit.

== Mechanism ==
It is suggested that the predominant mechanism of cytochalasin B is the inhibition of actin filament polymerization through binding to the fast-growing (barbed) end of F-actin filaments. An alternative could involve capping proteins. By doing so, CB not only inhibits actin polymerization but also consecutive processes such as filament network build-up.
This inhibition can affect all three major steps of actin polymerization
# Nucleation: A core of minimal 3 actin monomers is formed.
# Elongation: The core is used for elongation by addition of actin monomers.
# Steady state/Annealing: A balance between polymerisation and depolymerisation is reached (steady-state). The F-actin filament stops growing and two barbed ends fuse to create one filament.

Nucleation is essential for filament build-up. The oligomerization is the rate-determining step, considering actin filament formation as a whole. The so-called lag phase of actin polymerization originates from this step. It takes quite a while until polymerization starts, but once it has, the process is autocatalytic until the physiological maximum of the polymerization rate is reached.

Elongation is favored at the barbed end of the growing filament. Here, the influence of cytochalasin B strongly depends on the overall conditions for elongation. If ideal physiological conditions are present, the inhibitory influence of cytochalasin B is minuscule. If the conditions are less optimal, elongation can be inhibited by up to 90 percent.

Annealing is the last step in polymerization. Cells treated with cytochalasin B and control group cells could not be distinguished. This indicated, that CB has no significant effect at this stage.

CB contains a beta-unsaturated ester which can undergo a Michael-type conjugation with nucleophiles. If this is the case, DNA-adduction might be a plausible reaction afterwards. A more suitable reaction seems to be the one with thiol-groups of several biomolecules. The thiol-groups would then no longer be available for disulfide bonds for further actin polymerization and thus a crucial step in actin polymerization is inhibited as the barbed ends of the filaments are blocked. An analogue principle is used by the well-studied capping proteins which are responsible for a natural limiting factor of actin polymerization.
The first step in actin polymerization, after polymerization is initiated, is the deprotonation of the thiol group of G-actin. This renders the sulfur atom charged and makes it available for actin polymerization. If cytochalasin B is present in the cell, the deprotonation of thiol is competed. The reactive beta-unsaturated ester group of cytochalasin B reacts with the thiol group of actin via a nucleophilic attack of the charged sulfur onto the beta-carbon atom. This forces the π-bond to get dislocated on the left site of the beta-carbon. Consequently, mesomerism occurs, dislocating the negative charge between the alpha-carbon and the oxygen atom. This step is followed by a protonation step to counteract the negative charge. The hydronium ion needed to do so was produced during the activation of the sulfur atom in an earlier step.

== Metabolism ==
There are ten possible sites for the &quot;in vitro&quot; degradation of cytochalasin B. There is not yet any evidence that the same sites are used for degradation &quot;in vivo&quot;, but evidence has confirmed the &quot;in vitro&quot; sites.
Degradation is initialized by a periodate cleavage of the compound, taking place at carbon 14 and 21. As a result, carbonic acid (A), formaldehyde (B), 5-methylhexane-1,1,6-triol (C) and a large remaining molecule (D) are released. Molecules C and D are then oxidized via Kuhn Roth reaction, leading to the formation of 7-hydroxyheptanal (F), acetic acid (G) and benzoic acid (I). Again, a larger molecule remains (J). F, G and I can undergo Schmidt reaction, if not degraded via acidic degradation by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) to methylamine and carbon dioxide (H). 7-hydroxyheptane is oxidized to 3-methylheptanedioic acid (K). Further metabolism leads to the formation of several smaller organic molecules such as amines (M), carbon dioxide (N) and acetic acid (O). The latter is again metabolized by ADH to methylamine and carbon dioxide (Q). Molecule J is cleaved into a number of small compounds such as acetic acid (L), methylamine and carbon dioxide (P), and a series of small methylated compounds.

== Efficacy and adverse effects ==

=== Interactions ===
When adding cytochalasin B and the beta-andrenergic agonist (-)-isoproterenol, prostaglandin E1 or cholera toxin to wild type S49 lymphoma cells, cAMP accumulates. Cytochalasin B is unable to transform 3T3-like tumor cells, but it did increase the frequency of cell transformation by the polyoma virus 8-40 fold. Furthermore, CB can intensify pinocytosis, which is induced by concanavalin A in amoeba proteus. Cytochalasin B can also interact with the auxin indole-3-acetic acid which occurs in wheat coleoptile segments and maize roots. This interaction leads to the inhibition of vesicle transport and secretion of cell wall components and thereby blocks elongation and growth.

=== Efficacy ===
&quot;In vitro&quot; studies showed that a concentration of 30 μM of cytochalasin B significantly reduces the relative viscosity of a 20 μM normal actin filament solution as well as it has decreased in a 20 μMm glutathionyl-actin filament solution.
&quot;In vivo&quot; the effective concentration is even lower. It seemed that a 2 μM concentration is sufficient in living cells to accomplish a measurable influence on the actin polymerization. The nucleation phase took 2-4 times as long as in the control groups. On elongation, the effects were minimal; on annealing negligible. This might be due to an actual difference in molecular interactions of cytochalasin B during those three steps or simply due to the fact that the lag phase is the rate-determining step in the overall polymerization.

== Applications ==

=== Actin polymerization studies ===
As cytochalasin B inhibits actin filament polymerization, many cellular processes depending on actin filament functions are affected. Cytokinesis is inhibited, however, mitosis is unaffected. Due to the effects on several cellular functions but lack of general toxicity, cytochalasin B is applied in actin polymerization studies, cell imaging methods, cell cycle studies and can possibly be used as anticancer drug.

=== Inhibits cell division ===
Cytochalasin B is used for testing of the genotoxicity of substances. In order to do so, cytokinesis-block micronucleus assay (CBMN assay) with human lymphocytes is applied. This works &quot;in vitro&quot;.
During anaphase of mitosis of meiosis, micronuclei can be detected. These are small nuclei containing one chromosome or part of a chromosome which did not get to one of the cell poles during cell division. The CBMN test is based on the fact that only dividing cells can express micronuclei, which means that only in those cells, chromosome damage can be detected. Because genotoxicity causes abnormalities in cell division, micronuclei can be detected in binucleated cells. Cytokinesis, which is the next stage, is inhibited by cytochalasin B. A key advantage of this method is that it allows simultaneous detection of multiple molecular events leading to chromosome damage and chromosomal instability.
The CBMN assay has successfully been applied to normal human lymphocytes, mouse spleen lymphocytes, mouse fibroblasts and Chinese hamster fibroblasts.

=== Inhibits cell movement ===
Cytochalasin B can decrease the number of motile cells when it is added to Yoshida Sarcoma Cells. It can also decrease the motility of the cells and dose-dependently inhibits their growth.
Since cytochalasin B unevenly penetrates cells it promotes focal contractions of the broken cortical actin filament network by myosin. This causes superprecipitation which requires active contractions and thus an active energy metabolism. The disorganized cortical contractions disrupt the assembly of pseudopodia which are involved in cell movement.

=== Induces nuclear extrusion ===
Nuclear extrusion induced by cytochalasin B begins with the movement of the nucleus to the plasma membrane, followed by bulge formation in the membrane. The nucleus then moves to the outside of the membrane, but stays connected to the cell by a thread-like cytoplasmic bridge. If the cells are kept in cytochalasin B containing medium for several hours, the process becomes irreversible. Extrusion could be assisted by the CB-induced weakening of the plasma membrane.

=== Inhibits glucose transport ===
It has been shown that cytochalasin B binds covalently to mammalian glucose transporter proteins when irradiated with UV light. It bound tighter to AraE and GalP than their usual substrates. Cytochalasin B has been shown to inhibit GLUT1, 2, 3 and 4. Binding to GLUT1 occurs at the inside as cytochalasin B acts as it acts as a competitive inhibitor of glucose exit. Additional evidence comes from photolabeling studies in which the Trp388 and Trp412 in TM10 and TM11 of the purified protein are labeled upon exposure to labeled cytochalasin B. Since mutating Trp388 and Trp412 does not completely reduce inhibition of GLUT1, it is assumed that other sites are involved in CB binding as well.

=== Therapeutic uses ===
For therapeutic purposes, research on cytochalasin B is done.
In order to do so, the effects of cytochalasin B on tumor cells by BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin)-activated macrophages were examined. It showed that cytochalasin B enhances tumor cell lysis and stasis due to activated macrophages at a concentration of 10−7 M. Cytochalasin B does not act on the macrophage itself, but does exert its effect predominantly on the tumor cell. A reason for this could be, that the actin filament formation, which could be important for the destruction of tumor cells by activated macrophages, is inhibited by cytochalasin B.

===Further effects===
Cytochalasin B has an effect on thyroid hormone and growth hormone secretion.
Phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis is inhibited by cytochalasin B, as shown by George et al. It does so by inhibiting the conversion of phosphoethanolamine to cytidinediphosphate-ethanolamine. It was proposed that the mechanism is associated with alterations of intracellular calcium ions. Cytochalasin B also has effects on bacteria. For example, the growth and differentiation of E. histolytica is inhibited.[56] Furthermore, cytochalasin B has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on tumor cell growth without causing prolonged and/or profound immunosuppressive effects.

===Natural context===
In nature, cytochalasin B is involved in fungal virulence, food spoilage and the maintenance of the symbiosis between host and symbiont.

<text>The thorny devil (Moloch horridus), also known commonly as the mountain devil, thorny lizard, thorny dragon, and moloch, is a species of lizard in the family Agamidae. The species is endemic to Australia. It is the sole species in the genus Moloch. It grows up to in total length (including tail), with females generally larger than males.

==Taxonomy==
The thorny devil was first described by the biologist John Edward Gray in 1841. While it is the only species contained in the genus &quot;Moloch&quot;, many taxonomists suspect another species might remain to be found in the wild. The thorny devil is only distantly related to the morphologically similar North American horned lizards of the genus &quot;Phrynosoma&quot;. This similarity is usually thought of as an example of convergent evolution.

The names given to this lizard reflect its appearance: the two large horned scales on its head complete the illusion of a dragon or devil. The name Moloch was used for a deity of the ancient Near East, usually depicted as a hideous beast. The thorny devil also has other nicknames people have given it such as the &quot;devil lizard&quot;, &quot;horned lizard&quot;, and the &quot;thorny toad&quot;.

==Description==
The thorny devil grows up to in total length (including tail), and can live for 15 to 20 years. The females are larger than the males. Most specimens are coloured in camouflaging shades of desert browns and tans. These colours change from pale colours during warm weather to darker colours during cold weather. The thorny devil is covered entirely with conical spines that are mostly uncalcified.
An intimidating array of spikes covers the entire upper side of the body of the thorny devil. These thorny scales also help to defend it from predators. Camouflage and deception may also be used to evade predation. This lizard&#x27;s unusual gait involves freezing and rocking as it moves about slowly in search of food, water, and mates.

The thorny devil also features a spiny &quot;false head&quot; on the back of its neck, and the lizard presents this to potential predators by dipping its real head. The &quot;false head&quot; is made of soft tissue.

The thorny devil&#x27;s scales are ridged, enabling the animal to collect water by simply touching it with any part of the body, usually the limbs; capillary action transports the water to the mouth through channels in its skin. The thorny devil is also equipped to harvest moisture in the dry desert following nighttime&#x27;s extremely low temperatures and the subsequent condensation of dew. The process involves moisture contact, their hydrophilic skin surface structures with capillaries, and an internal transport mechanism. 
*The lizard rubs its body against the moist substrate and shovels damp sand onto its back, the outer epidermis layer equipped to draw in cutaneous moisture. 
*The keratinous fibered epidermis is hydrophilic with hexagonal microstructures on the scale surfaces. When trace amounts of water contact its skin (pre-wetting) these microstructures fill with water, the skin surface becoming superhydrophilic. This allows moisture to spread across wider surface areas, yielding faster uptake, as water is collected via capillary action in small channels located between its scales. 
*Captured water is transported passively via capillary action in semi-tubular channels located beneath the partially overlapping scales, in an asymmetric and interconnected system that extends over the lizard&#x27;s entire body surface. The channels terminate at the mouth where active ingestion (drinking) is observable by jaw movements when moisture is plentiful, e.g. water puddles.

The same hydrophilic moisture-harvesting physiology is characteristic in the Texas horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma cornutum&quot;), roundtail horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma modestum&quot;), desert horned lizard (&quot;Phrynosoma platyrhinos&quot;), Arabian toad-headed agama (&quot;Phrynocephalus arabicus&quot;), sunwatcher toadhead agama (&quot;Phrynocephalus helioscopus&quot;), &quot;Phrynocephalus horvathi&quot;, yellow-spotted agama (&quot;Trapelus flavimaculatus&quot;), &quot;Trapelus pallidus&quot; and desert agama (&quot;Trapelus mutabilis&quot;).

==Distribution and habitat==
The thorny devil usually lives in the arid scrubland and desert that covers most of central Australia, sandplain and sandridge desert in the deep interior and the mallee belt.

The habitat of the thorny devil coincides more with the regions of sandy loam soils than with a particular climate in Western Australia.

==Self-defense==
The thorny devil is covered in hard, rather sharp spines that dissuade attacks by predators by making it difficult to swallow. It also has a false head on its back. When it feels threatened by other animals, it lowers its head between its front legs, and then presents its false head. Predators that consume the thorny devil include wild birds and goannas.

==Diet==
The thorny devil mainly subsists on ants, especially &quot;Ochetellus flavipes&quot; and other species in the &quot;Camponotus&quot;, &quot;Ectatomma&quot;, &quot;Iridomyrmex&quot; (especially &quot;Iridomyrmex rufoniger&quot;), &quot;Monomorium&quot;, &quot;Ochetellus&quot;, &quot;Pheidole&quot;, or &quot;Polyrhachis&quot; genera. Thorny devils often eat thousands of ants in one day.

The thorny devil collects moisture in the dry desert by the condensation of dew. This dew forms on its skin in the early morning as it begins to warm outside. Then the dew is channeled to its mouth by gravity and capillary action via the channels between its spines. During rainfalls, capillary action allows the thorny devil to absorb water from all over its body. Capillary action also allows the thorny devil to absorb water from damp sand. Absorption through sand is the thorny devil&#x27;s main source of water intake.

==Reproduction==
The female thorny devil lays a clutch of three to ten eggs between September and December. She puts these in a nesting burrow about 30 cm underground. The eggs hatch after about three to four months.

==Popular reference==
The popular appeal of the thorny devil is the basis of an anecdotal petty scam. American servicemen stationed in Southwest Australia decades ago (such as during World War II) were supposedly sold the thorny fruits of a species of weeds, the so-called &quot;double gee&quot; (&quot;Emex australis&quot;), but those were called &quot;thorny devil eggs&quot; as a part of the scam. Thorny devils have been kept in captivity.

<text>Muhammad II al-Mahdi () was the fourth Caliph of Córdoba of the Umayyad dynasty in Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia). After disbanding his army of 7,000 troops, he became the source of opposition to many of his subjects. Al-Mahdi sought to defend his title as Caliph after the rise of Suleiman II as a political opponent. After a turbulent rule, in which many warring factions rose to power in an attempt to supplant al-Mahdi, he was eventually deposed. After his death, many Muslim historians accused him of destroying the sanctity of the Amirid Harem.

<doc id="1091113" wikidata="Q199743" url="?curid=1091113" title="Shaded-pole motor">
<text>The shaded-pole motor is the original type of AC single-phase electric motor, dating back to at least as early as 1890. A shaded-pole motor is a motor, in which the auxiliary winding is composed of a copper ring or bar surrounding a portion of each pole to produce a weakly rotating magnetic field. When single phase AC supply is applied to the stator winding, due to shading provided to the poles, a rotating magnetic field is generated. This auxiliary single-turn winding is called a shading coil. Currents induced in this coil by the magnetic field create a second electrical phase by delaying the phase of magnetic flux change for that pole (a &quot;shaded pole&quot;) enough to provide a 2-phase rotating magnetic field. The direction of rotation is from the unshaded side to the shaded (ring) side of the pole. Since the phase angle between the shaded and unshaded sections is small, shaded-pole motors produce only a small starting torque relative to torque at full speed. Shaded-pole motors of the asymmetrical type shown are only reversible by disassembly and flipping over the stator, though some similar looking motors have small, switch-shortable auxiliary windings of thin wire instead of thick copper bars and can reverse electrically. Another method of electrical reversing involves four coils (two pairs of identical coils).

The common, asymmetrical form of these motors (pictured) has only one winding, with no capacitor or starting windings/starting switch, making them economical and reliable. Larger and more modern types may have multiple physical windings, though electrically only one, and a capacitor may be used. Because their starting torque is low, they are best suited to driving fans or other loads that are easily started. They may have multiple taps near one electrical end of the winding, which provides variable speed and power by selection of one tap at a time, as in ceiling fans. Moreover, they are compatible with TRIAC-based variable-speed controls, which often are used with fans. They are built in power sizes up to about output. Above , they are not common, and for larger motors, other designs offer better characteristics. A main disadvantage is their low efficiency of around 26%. A major advantage is that the motor&#x27;s stall current is only slightly higher than the running current, so there is low risk of severe over-heating or tripping the circuit protection if the motor is stalled for some reason.

==Types==
* Squirrel-cage asynchronous: The most common type of shaded-pole motor in fractional horsepower use has a squirrel-cage rotor that consists of a laminated steel cylinder with conductive copper or aluminum bars embedded lengthwise in its surface, connected at the ends.
* Synchronous permamagnetized uses a magnetized rotor, e.g. a permanent magnet. This rotor rotates synchronously with the rotating magnetic field: if the rotor begins to lag behind the rotating field, driving torque increases and the rotor speeds up slightly until the rotor&#x27;s position within the rotating field is a point where torque = drag; similarly, if the rotation of the field slows down, the rotor will advance relative to the field, torque will decline, or even become negative, slowing the speed of the rotor until it again reaches a position relative to the field where torque = drag.&lt;br&gt;Because of this, these motors are often used to drive electric clocks and, occasionally, phonograph turntables. In these applications, the speed of the motor is as accurate as the frequency of the mains power applied to the motor. These motors are also used in electric shavers. Frequently, the rotor and its associated reduction geartrain are encased in an aluminium, copper, or plastic enclosure; the enclosed rotor is driven magnetically through the enclosure. Such geared motors are commonly available with the final output shaft or gear rotating from 600 RPM down to as low as 1/168 revolution per hour (1 revolution per week).
* Synchronous squirrel-cage combines the two, in that the magnetized rotor is provided with a squirrel cage, so that the motor starts like an induction motor, once the rotor is pulled into synchronism with its magnet, the squirrel cage has no current induced in it and so plays no further part in the operation.

==Starting issues and torque limitations==

Even by the standards of shaded pole motors, the power output of these motors is usually very low. Because there is often no explicit starting mechanism, the rotor of a motor operating from a constant frequency mains supply must be very light so that it is capable of reaching running speed within one cycle of the mains frequency.
A further development dispenses with the shading rings altogether. The application of power gives the magnetised rotor enough of a &#x27;flick&#x27; to move it fast enough to establish synchronism. A mechanical means prevents the rotor from starting in the wrong direction. This design will only work satisfactorily if the standstill load is near to zero and has very little inertia. This is similar to the motor used in quartz-timed mechanical clocks.
In more recent times, the use of variable frequency controls permits synchronous motors to start slowly and deliver more torque.

<text>Muhammad bin &#x27;Abd ar-Rahman bin &#x27;Obayd Allah (), known as Muhammad III () was an Umayyad Caliph of Cordoba in Al-Andalus (Moorish Iberia). 

Muhammad III ruled after the death of Abd ar-Rahman V from 1024 to 1025 but the people of Córdoba revolted against him and fearing the march of Yahya ibn Ali ibn Hammud al-Mu&#x27;tali, he was forced to flee the city. It is believed that he died after being poisoned when he was 50 years old. He was also the father of the famous poet Wallada bint al-Mustakfi, whom he had with an Iberian Christian slave.

<text>Tomas Gösta Tranströmer (; 15 April 1931 – 26 March 2015) was a Swedish poet, psychologist and translator. His poems captured the long winters in Sweden, the rhythm of the seasons and the palpable, atmospheric beauty of nature. Tranströmer&#x27;s work is also characterized by a sense of mystery and wonder underlying the routine of everyday life, a quality which often gives his poems a religious dimension. He has been described as a Christian poet.

Tranströmer is acclaimed as one of the most important Scandinavian writers since the Second World War. Critics praised his poetry for its accessibility, even in translation. His poetry has been translated into over 60 languages. He was the recipient of the 1990 Neustadt International Prize for Literature, the 2004 International Nonino Prize, and the 2011 Nobel Prize in Literature.

==Life and work==

===Early life===
Tranströmer was born in Stockholm in 1931 and raised by his mother Helmy, a schoolteacher, following her divorce from his father, Gösta Tranströmer, an editor. He received his secondary education at the Södra Latin Gymnasium in Stockholm, where he began writing poetry. In addition to selected journal publications, his first collection of poems, &quot;17 Poems&quot;, was published in 1954. He continued his education at Stockholm University, graduating as a psychologist in 1956 with additional studies in history, religion and literature. Between 1960 and 1966, Tranströmer split his time between working as a psychologist at the Roxtuna centre for juvenile delinquents (sv) and writing poetry. He also worked as a psychologist at the Labor Market Institute in Västerås from 1965 to 1990.

===Poetry===
Tranströmer is considered to be one of the &quot;most influential Scandinavian poet[s] of recent decades&quot;. Tranströmer published 15 collected works over his extensive career, which have been translated into over 60 languages. An English translation by Robin Fulton of his entire body of work, &quot;New Collected Poems&quot;, was published in the UK in 1987 and expanded in 1997. Following the publication of &quot;The Great Enigma&quot;, Fulton&#x27;s edition was further expanded into &quot;The Great Enigma: New Collected Poems,&quot; published in the US in 2006 and as an updated edition of &quot;New Collected Poems&quot; in the UK in 2011. He published a short autobiography, &quot;Minnena ser mig&quot; &quot;(The Memories see me)&quot;, in 1993.

By the mid-1960s, Tranströmer became close friends with poet Robert Bly. The two corresponded frequently, and Bly would translate Tranströmer&#x27;s poems into English. In 2001 Bonniers, Tranströmer&#x27;s publisher, released &quot;Air Mail&quot;, a work consisting of Tranströmer&#x27;s and Bly&#x27;s day-to-day correspondence on personal, contemporary and literary matters c. 1965–1991 – in a style that vividly conveyed how close friends the two had soon become. Bly also helped arrange readings for his fellow poet in America. The Syrian poet Adunis helped spread Tranströmer&#x27;s fame in the Arab world, accompanying him on reading tours.

In the 1970s, other poets accused Tranströmer of being detached from his own age, since he did not deal overtly with social and political issues in his poems and novels. His work, though, lies within and further develops the Modernist and Expressionist/Surrealist language of 20th-century poetry; his clear, seemingly simple pictures from everyday life and nature, in particular, reveals a mystic insight to the universal aspects of the human mind. A poem of his was read at Anna Lindh&#x27;s memorial service in 2003.

Tranströmer went to Bhopal immediately after the gas tragedy in 1984, and alongside Indian poets such as K. Satchidanandan, took part in a poetry reading session outside the plant.

Tranströmer suffered a stroke in 1990 that left him partially paralyzed and unable to speak; however, he continued to write and publish poetry through the early 2000s. One of his final original volumes of poetry, &quot;Den stora gåtan&quot;, was published in 2004, and translated into English in 2006 as &quot;The Great Enigma&quot;.

===Music===
Tranströmer played the piano throughout his life; after his stroke, which paralyzed the right side of his body, he taught himself to play only with his left hand. He often said that the playing was a way for him to continue living after the stroke.

Tranströmer&#x27;s daughter Emma is a concert singer. In 2011 she released the album &quot;Dagsmeja&quot;, containing songs based on Tranströmer&#x27;s poems.

Many composers and musicians have worked with his poems. Among these are Jan Garbarek, Ulf Grahn, Madeleine Isaksson, Margareta Hallin, Lars Edlund, Sven-David Sandström, Jan Sandström and Anders Eliasson.

===Death===
Tranströmer died in Stockholm on 26 March 2015 at 83.

<doc id="1091136" wikidata="Q1319519" url="?curid=1091136" title="Von Mises yield criterion">
<text>In continuum mechanics, the maximum distortion energy criterion (also von Mises yield criterion) states that yielding of a ductile material begins when the second invariant of deviatoric stress formula_1 reaches a critical value. It is a part of plasticity theory that mostly applies to ductile materials, such as some metals. Prior to yield, material response can be assumed to be of a linear elastic, nonlinear elastic, or viscoelastic behavior.

In materials science and engineering, the von Mises yield criterion is also formulated in terms of the von Mises stress or equivalent tensile stress, formula_2. This is a scalar value of stress that can be computed from the Cauchy stress tensor. In this case, a material is said to start yielding when the von Mises stress reaches a value known as yield strength, formula_3. The von Mises stress is used to predict yielding of materials under complex loading from the results of uniaxial tensile tests. The von Mises stress satisfies the property where two stress states with equal distortion energy have an equal von Mises stress.

Because the von Mises yield criterion is independent of the first stress invariant, formula_4, it is applicable for the analysis of plastic deformation for ductile materials such as metals, as onset of yield for these materials does not depend on the hydrostatic component of the stress tensor.

Although it has been believed it was formulated by James Clerk Maxwell in 1865, Maxwell only described the general conditions in a letter to William Thomson (Lord Kelvin). Richard Edler von Mises rigorously formulated it in 1913. Tytus Maksymilian Huber (1904), in a paper written in Polish, anticipated to some extent this criterion by properly relying on the distortion strain energy, not on the total strain energy as his predecessors. Heinrich Hencky formulated the same criterion as von Mises independently in 1924. For the above reasons this criterion is also referred to as the &quot;Maxwell–Huber–Hencky–von Mises theory&quot;.

==Mathematical formulation==

Mathematically the von Mises yield criterion is expressed as:
:formula_5

Here formula_6 is yield stress of the material in pure shear. As shown later in this article, at the onset of yielding, the magnitude of the shear yield stress in pure shear is √3 times lower than the tensile yield stress in the case of simple tension. Thus, we have:
:formula_7

where formula_8 is tensile yield strength of the material. If we set the von Mises stress equal to the yield strength and combine the above equations, the von Mises yield criterion is written as:
:formula_9

or
:formula_10

Substituting formula_1 with the Cauchy stress tensor components, we get
:formula_12,

where formula_13 is called deviatoric stress. This equation defines the yield surface as a circular cylinder (See Figure) whose yield curve, or intersection with the deviatoric plane, is a circle with radius formula_14, or formula_15. This implies that the yield condition is independent of hydrostatic stresses.

==Reduced von Mises equation for different stress conditions==
===Uniaxial (1D) stress===
In the case of uniaxial stress or simple tension, formula_16, the von Mises criterion simply reduces to
:formula_17,

which means the material starts to yield when formula_18 reaches the &quot;yield strength&quot; of the material formula_3, in agreement with the definition of tensile (or compressive) yield strength.

===Multi-axial (2D or 3D) stress===
An equivalent tensile stress or equivalent von-Mises stress, formula_2 is used to predict yielding of materials under multiaxial loading conditions using results from simple uniaxial tensile tests. Thus, we define

:formula_21

where formula_22 are components of stress deviator tensor formula_23:

:formula_24.

In this case, yielding occurs when the equivalent stress, formula_2, reaches the yield strength of the material in simple tension, formula_3. As an example, the stress state of a steel beam in compression differs from the stress state of a steel axle under torsion, even if both specimens are of the same material. In view of the stress tensor, which fully describes the stress state, this difference manifests in six degrees of freedom, because the stress tensor has six independent components. Therefore, it is difficult to tell which of the two specimens is closer to the yield point or has even reached it. However, by means of the von Mises yield criterion, which depends solely on the value of the scalar von Mises stress, i.e., one degree of freedom, this comparison is straightforward: A larger von Mises value implies that the material is closer to the yield point.

In the case of pure shear stress, formula_27, while all other formula_28, von Mises criterion becomes:

:formula_29.

This means that, at the onset of yielding, the magnitude of the shear stress in pure shear is formula_30 times lower than the yield stress in the case of simple tension. The von Mises yield criterion for pure shear stress, expressed in principal stresses, is

:formula_31

In the case of principal plane stress, formula_32 and formula_33, the von Mises criterion becomes:

:formula_34

This equation represents an ellipse in the plane formula_35.

===Summary===
==Physical interpretation of the von Mises yield criterion==
Hencky (1924) offered a physical interpretation of von Mises criterion suggesting that yielding begins when the elastic energy of distortion reaches a critical value. For this reason, the von Mises criterion is also known as the maximum distortion strain energy criterion. This comes from the relation between formula_1 and the elastic strain energy of distortion formula_37:

:formula_38 with the elastic shear modulus formula_39.

In 1937 Arpad L. Nadai suggested that yielding begins when the octahedral shear stress reaches a critical value, i.e. the octahedral shear stress of the material at yield in simple tension. In this case, the von Mises yield criterion is also known as the maximum octahedral shear stress criterion in view of the direct proportionality that exists between formula_1 and the octahedral shear stress, formula_41, which by definition is

: formula_42

thus we have

: formula_43
: Strain energy density consists of two components - volumetric or dialational and distortional. Volumetric component is responsible for change in volume without any change in shape. Distortional component is responsible for shear deformation or change in shape.

==Practical engineering usage of the von Mises yield criterion==
As shown in the equations above, the use of the von Mises criterion as a yield criterion is only exactly applicable when the following material properties are isotropic, and the ratio of the shear yield strength to the tensile yield strength has the following value:

:formula_44

Since no material will have this ratio precisely, in practice it is necessary to use engineering judgement to decide what failure theory is appropriate for a given material. Alternately, for use of the Tresca theory, the same ratio is defined as 1/2.

The yield margin of safety is written as

:formula_45

<doc id="1091143" wikidata="Q7385070" url="?curid=1091143" title="Ryhope">
<text>Ryhope ( ) is a coastal village along the southern boundary of the City of Sunderland, in Tyne and Wear, England. With a population of approximately 14,000, measured at 10.484 in the 2011 census, Ryhope is 2.9 miles to the centre of Sunderland, 2.8 miles to the centre of Seaham, and 1.2 miles from the main A19.

The older village section is centred on a triangular &#x27;green&#x27;, which contains a war monument. The newer &#x27;Colliery&#x27; area of Ryhope flanks the Ryhope Street/Tunstall Bank Road, which lead toward the Tunstall and Silksworth areas of Sunderland.

==Geography and administration==
The A1018 &#x27;Southern Radial Route&#x27;, which opened in 2008, bypasses Ryhope along the clifftops and takes traffic toward the Port of Sunderland in Hendon and other routes to the centre and north of Sunderland.

The B1287 Sea View Road links Ryhope with the town of Seaham to the south.

Ryhope is surrounded by farmland meaning it is a relatively isolated suburb of Sunderland. A number of cycle routes run through the village, including the National Cycle Network Route number 1 which is looked after by a local team of Sustrans Rangers.

Located to the south-west of the village is Cherry Knowle Hospital which is part of the South of Tyne and Wearside Mental Health NHS Trust. It has long been the main mental health services complex for the Wearside area. The Ryhope Engines Museum is also located in this area.

Ryhope was part of the Houghton and Washington East constituency until its abolition at the 2010 general election. Since then, it has formed part of the Sunderland Central constituency.

Ryhope was formerly a township and chapelry in the parish of Bishop-Wearmouth, in 1866 Ryhope became a separate civil parish, on 1 April 1967 the parish was abolished and merged with Sunderland and Seaham. In 1961 the parish had a population of 9796.

==History==
Ryhope (from the Old English &quot;reof hoppas&quot;, meaning &quot;rough valley&quot;) is first mentioned in 930 AD when king Athelstan granted the land of Bishopwearmouth (including the township of Ryhope) to the Bishop of Chester-le-Street. The land had been reclaimed from the Vikings who had captured it in 918 AD.

Ryhope has a strong history of farming; in 1183 there were 22 recorded villeins who provided the landowner with cattle and crops. In 1380 the population had swelled to approximately 150. In 1860 common grazing land was split into plots, which radiated out in strips from the village green. Ryhope&#x27;s proximity to the sea has allowed it to serve as a seaside destination for centuries. The beach is said to have been a favourite sea-bathing spot for the Bishop of Durham.

Located on the Durham coalfield, Ryhope followed the path of many other villages in the area, and abandoned agriculture as the main employer in favour of coal. In 1859 a colliery was opened, causing huge changes in the geography of the village. The settlement of Ryhope extended west toward the area of Tunstall, creating two distinct areas of Ryhope; the &#x27;Village&#x27; and the &#x27;Colliery&#x27; (the post-World War II, council-built estate of &#x27;Hollycarrside&#x27; forms a third section.) Railway lines were introduced to the area, linking Ryhope to Sunderland, Seaham and other Durham Coalfield mining villages. Now only a single railway line runs through the village, and there is no longer a station. The colliery was closed in 1966.

A bronze statue of a pit pony was erected on a plinth on the Stockton Road entrance to Ryhope in 2009 by the Ryhope Development Trust. The statue was stolen for a second time in October 2021; its subsequently replacement with toys, teddy bears and rocking horses gained viral popularity online in 2023. In August 2024, a second, separate metal statue of a pit pony was also stolen.

=== World War II ===
In March 1944 Ryhope was the scene of the conclusion of the epic last flight of the Handley Page Halifax bomber LK797 from RAF Bomber Command&#x27;s raid on Nuremberg, which crash-landed in Ryhope, resulting in Pilot Officer Cyril Barton being posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross.

== Sport ==
There are two football clubs in the town, Ryhope Colliery Welfare and Sunderland Ryhope Community Association, both members of the Northern League.

==Notable people==
* Mick Buxton, former Sunderland AFC manager
* Ronald Radd, actor
* Nicola Sturgeon, First Minister of Scotland from 2014 into the 2020s, has family connections to the area, her paternal grandmother having been born in Ryhope.
* Simon Fenton, actor and columnist

==Tourism==
Ryhope Engines Museum, which is based on the Ryhope Pumping Station, was built in 1868 to supply water to the Sunderland area.

Among natural features, Ryhope adjoins Tunstall Hills which have views of the city of Sunderland and beyond (on a clear day, down the coast almost to Whitby). The Tunstall Hills are located on the southern outskirts of Sunderland between (New) Silksworth and Ryhope. The disused quarries and cuttings at Tunstall Hills provide exposure through part of the Magnesian Limestone succession of Permian age. The slopes on the &quot;Maiden Paps&quot; section support species such as blue moor-grass, common rock-rose, perennial flax and locally uncommon plants such as Frog Orchid, Autumn Gentian and Purple Milk-Vetch. These areas have been designated a &quot;site of special scientific interest&quot; (SSSI).

Ryhope is also home to the world&#x27;s first (and so far only) listed Pigeon Cree.

<text>Vicente Ferreira Pastinha (April 5, 1889, Salvador, Bahia, Brazil – November 13, 1981), known as Mestre Pastinha, was a &quot;mestre&quot; of the Afro-Brazilian martial art capoeira and a codifier of the traditional capoeira Angola style.

Mestre Pastinha was a brilliant capoeirista whose game was characterized by agility, quickness and intelligence. He demonstrated that even in his seventies, he could engage in acrobatics and outperform much younger capoeiristas.

He chose not to introduce new kicks in order to preserve the original art. He wanted his students to improve the principal techniques (&quot;cabeçada&quot;, &quot;rasteira&quot;, &quot;rabo de arraia&quot;, &quot;chapa de frente&quot;, &quot;chapa de costas&quot;, &quot;meia lua&quot; and &quot;cutilada de mão&quot;), which allows a proper &quot;jogo de dentro&quot; (inner game) to develop.

Pastinha was known as the &quot;philosopher of capoeira&quot; because of his use of many aphorisms. He made it his mission to clearly separate capoeira Angola from the violence.

Two principal Pastinha&#x27;s disciples were mestres João Pequeno and João Grande.

== Life ==

Pastinha was born on April 5, 1889, in Salvador. Little is documented about his family background, except that his mother, Maria Eugenia Ferreira, was a black woman from Bahia, and his father, José Pastiña, was a Spanish pedlar.

Pastinha&#x27;s introduction to capoeira arouse from a need for self-defense. As a somewhat frail ten-year-old, he faced bullying from a larger boy in his Rua da Laranjeira neighborhood. Witnessing his predicament, an elderly African neighbor named Benedito, native of Angola, offered to teach him capoeira. After several months of training with him, Pastinha successfully beat the bully.

He continued his training with Benedito for two more years. Pastinha&#x27;s teacher apparently did not use a berimbau, but only a drum, which seems to be common in Bahian capoeira at that time.

=== Navy School ===

At the age of 12, Pastinha began his apprenticeship at the Navy School in Salvador.

During his time in the Navy, Pastinha received instruction in fencing, jack-knife techniques, and Swedish gymnastics. His musical talents also flourished under the guidance of the renowned musician Anacleto Vidal da Cunha. It is likely that he played, perhaps the horn, in the Navy orchestra. Pastinha&#x27;s own accounts suggest that he even shared his knowledge of capoeira with some of his fellow sailors.

At the age of 20, in 1910, he left the Navy.

=== Capoeira instructor ===

Pastinha made a living through various jobs, including shoe cleaning, newspaper sales, carpentry, and working as a casino bouncer. According to his interview, Pastinha wanted to live through the sale of his oil paintings, though this endeavor did not entirely materialize.

He established his first capoeira school in a bicycle workshop located on the Campo da Pólvora. After 1910, he began teaching capoeira to artisans and students residing in shared accommodations (&quot;repúblicas&quot;) in the surrounding neighborhood, although scant details are available about his early students.

In street rodas, Pastinha was always ready for any unforeseen circumstances. He frequently recalled that he carried a small sickle that could be affixed to the berimbau, effectively turning the instrument into a formidable weapon should a street fight arise. However, despite his initial acclaim, Pastinha completely withdrew from the practice of capoeira in the following years. According to his own writings, he withdrew from 1912 until 1941.

=== Capoeira Angola center ===


During the 1930s, traditional Bahian capoeira became known as &quot;capoeira de Angola&quot;, opposing Bimba&#x27;s &quot;capoeira Regional&quot;. A group of old mestres held regular rodas in Gengibirra area, in black neighbourhood Liberdade, to preserve traditional style. Rodas was led by Mestre Amorzinho, a civil guard who offered protection from police harassment. According to Mestre Noronha, it was the first center for Capoeira Angola, founded by 22 mestres.

Accourding to Pastinha&#x27;s account, one of his top students, Aberrê, visited Gengibirra and impressed the mestres there with skills, so they ask him for teacher. Pastinha eventually visited them on 23 February 1941:

In his memoirs, Noronha offered a slightly different version of the episode, suggesting that it was only after Amorzinho&#x27;s death that the other mestres decided to pass the leadership to Pastinha. However, in 1941 Pastinha founded the &quot;Centro Esportivo de Capoeira Angola&quot;, located at the Pelourinho.

Like Bimba, Pastinha formalized capoeira practice by establishing structured classes within a dedicated &quot;academy&quot;. Students were required to wear uniforms during both training sessions and exhibitions. The uniform designs evolved over time, drawing clear inspiration from sports jerseys. From about 1950, Pastinha adopted the colors of his favorite soccer club, Ypiranga, yellow and black, which became the hallmarks of the Angola style he taught. His goal of imparting knowledge to the &#x27;next generation&#x27; of mestres also led to the establishment of hierarchical structures within capoeira.

Pastinha participated with the Brazilian delegation of the &quot;First International Festival de Artes Negras&quot; in Dakar, Senegal (1966), bringing with him João Grande, Gato Preto, Gildo Alfinete, Roberto Satanás and Camafeu de Oxossi.

=== Twilight years ===
Pastinha worked as shoeshiner, tailor, gold prospector, security guard at a gambling house and construction worker at the &quot;Porto de Salvador&quot; to support himself financially so that he could do what he loved the most, to be an &quot;Angoleiro&quot;.

Eventually Pastinha&#x27;s academy fell on hard times. Pastinha, old, sick and almost totally blind, was asked by the government to vacate his academy for renovations, but the space was never returned to him. Instead it became a restaurant and entertainment outlet. Pastinha was left abandoned in a city shelter (abrigo D. Pedro II - Salvador).

Pastinha played his last game of capoeira on April 12, 1981. He died at the age of 92 on November 13, 1981.

Two of his most learned students, João Grande and João Pequeno continued to share capoeira Angola with the world.

== On capoeira ==

According to Pastinha, good mestre should watch the game not to become violent and not to lose rhythm: 
For him, capoeira Angola is not a fight for victory over an &quot;opponent&quot;. Pastinha appealed to participants &quot;not to aspire to fight our &quot;comrades&quot; (companions)&quot;. Capoeiristas should play:

Pastinha stressed that a good capoeirista should always remain calm and decent:

He emphasized, in particular, the role of capoeira music and singing:

For Pastinha, capoeira Angola is more than a simple sport but a philosophy and a sacred legacy he ardently aimed to protect. His insistence on loving capoeira Angola mirrored a deep devotion akin to religious faith. As his friend, sculptor Mário Cravo, noted, &quot;Pastinha was a mystic because he lived capoeira with intensity and made his own interpretation of the mystic universe.&quot;

== Lineage ==

In Capoeira Angola, lineage represents the chain of teachers (&quot;mestres&quot;) and students that define one&#x27;s role in the community and shape a school&#x27;s teachings. Styles evolve uniquely through various teachers who pass them on to their students. Pastinha&#x27;s school in Pelourinho was influential in shaping Capoeira Angola. Many mestres in this tradition trace their lineage back to him.

<text>Joseph Vendryes or Vendryès (; 13 January 1875 – 30 January 1960) was a French Celtic linguist. After studying with Antoine Meillet, he was chairman of Celtic languages and literature at the École Pratique des Hautes Études. He founded the journal &quot;Études Celtiques&quot;. He was a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres and a consultant with the International Auxiliary Language Association, which standardized and presented Interlingua.

He studied the phenomenon of syntactic dislocation.

<text>Quentin Roosevelt (November 19, 1897 – July 14, 1918) was the youngest son of President Theodore Roosevelt and Edith Roosevelt. Inspired by his father and siblings, he joined the United States Army Air Service where he became a pursuit pilot during World War I and shot down one German aircraft. He was killed in aerial combat over France on Bastille Day (July 14), 1918. He is the only child of a U.S. president to have died in combat.

==Early life==
===Childhood===


Quentin was born in Washington, D.C., the youngest child of Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s household, which included half-sister Alice, sister Ethel, and brothers Ted (Theodore III), Kermit, and Archie.

Quentin was three years old when his father became president, and he grew up in the White House. By far the favorite of all of President Roosevelt&#x27;s children, Quentin was also the most rambunctious.

Quentin&#x27;s behavior prompted his mother, Edith, to label him a &quot;fine bad little boy&quot;. Amongst Quentin&#x27;s many adventures with the &quot;White House Gang&quot; (a name assigned by T.R. to Quentin and his friends), Quentin carved a baseball diamond on the White House lawn without permission, defaced official presidential portraits in the White House with spitballs, threw snowballs from the White House&#x27;s roof at unsuspecting Secret Service guards, and occasionally rode on top of the family elevator with his friend, Charlie Taft, the son of Secretary of War and future President William Howard Taft. The Secret Service were alarmed to see a fire and smoke behind the White House, only to see Quentin with a makeshift brick chimney baking some potatoes.

He quickly became known for his humorous and sometimes philosophical remarks. To a reporter trying to trap the boy into giving information about his father, Quentin admitted, &quot;I see him occasionally, but I know nothing of his family life.&quot; The family soon learned to keep him quiet during dinner when important guests were present.

Once, when his brother Archie was terribly ill, it was Quentin (with the help of Charles Lee, a White House coachman) who brought the pony Algonquin to his room by elevator, sure that this would make his brother smile.

===Education===
Quentin started his education at Force Elementary School and then attended the Episcopal High School in Alexandria, Virginia. Later he was a student at the Evans School for Boys and Groton School.

Quentin consistently scored high marks and displayed the intellectual prowess of his father. He was admitted to Harvard College in 1915. By the time Quentin was a sophomore at Harvard, also like his father, he was showing promise as a writer. Quentin was posthumously awarded an A.B. (War Degree) by Harvard, Class of 1919.

==Personal life==
Quentin was engaged to Flora Payne Whitney, the elder daughter of Harry Payne Whitney and Gertrude Vanderbilt. Gertrude was a great-granddaughter of the shipping and railroad millionaire, &quot;Commodore&quot; Cornelius Vanderbilt. Harry objected to Flora&#x27;s relationship with Quentin because Harry disapproved of the Roosevelt family in general and the liberal Republican Theodore Roosevelt in particular.

Quentin&#x27;s letters to Flora and his father charted the course of America&#x27;s entry into the war. While Theodore and Quentin were initially neutral, Theodore was incensed over the sinking of the British passenger ship RMS &quot;Lusitania&quot; in May 1915, in which 128 Americans drowned. Theodore campaigned vigorously on behalf of the 1916 Republican presidential nominee, Charles Evans Hughes, during which he severely criticized Woodrow Wilson. Wilson was reelected on a neutrality platform, but took the country to war during his second term.

Quentin came to agree with his father, writing to Flora in early 1917 from Harvard University, where he was studying: &quot;We are a pretty sordid lot, aren&#x27;t we, to want to sit looking on while England and France fight our battles and pan gold into our pockets.&quot;

==Military service==
All the Roosevelt sons had military training prior to World War I. With the outbreak of war in Europe in August 1914, there was a heightened concern about the nation&#x27;s readiness for military engagement. Only the month before, Congress had belatedly recognized the significance of military aviation by authorizing the creation of an Aviation Section in the Signal Corps. In 1915, Major General Leonard Wood, a friend of Theodore Roosevelt since the Rough Rider days, organized a summer camp at Plattsburgh, New York, to provide military training for business and professional men at their own expense. It would be this summer training program that would provide the basis of a greatly expanded junior officers corps when the country entered World War I. During August 1915, many well-heeled young men from some of the finest East Coast schools, including Quentin Roosevelt and two of his brothers, attended the camp. When the United States entered the war, commissions were offered to the graduates of these schools based on their performance. The National Defense Act of 1916 continued the student military training and the businessmen&#x27;s summer camps and placed them on a firmer legal basis by authorizing an Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps and a Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps (ROTC). Quentin, just out of the rigors of Groton and Harvard, did not really enjoy the training, but stuck it out anyway.

After the declaration of war, when the American Expeditionary Force was organizing, Theodore wired Major General John J. Pershing and volunteered to form a division and have his sons accompany him to Europe as privates. Pershing, who was a friend of Roosevelt dating back to the Cuban campaign, and had served under him when T.R. was president, accepted the proposal, but the War Department and President Woodrow Wilson overrode the decision. Roosevelt took the issue to Congress, but Wilson prevailed. In the end, all four of Theodore&#x27;s sons served in World War I as officers, but Theodore spent the war making speeches for the Red Cross.

With American entry into World War I, Quentin thought his mechanical skills would be useful to the Army. Just engaged to Flora, he dropped out of college in May 1917 to join the newly formed 1st Reserve Aero Squadron, the first air reserve unit in the nation. He trained on Long Island at an airfield later renamed Roosevelt Field in his honor. Today, a shopping mall sits on the site that is also named Roosevelt Field.

===Air service in France===

Finally sent to France, Lieutenant Roosevelt first helped in setting up the large Air Service training base at Issoudun. He was a supply officer and then, in time, ran one of the training airfields. Eventually, he became a pilot in the 95th Aero Squadron, part of the 1st Pursuit Group. The unit was posted to Touquin, France and, on July 9, 1918, Saints, France. During the time that he was flying from Saints, he was billeted just half a mile away at Melina Thibault&#x27;s home in Mauperthuis, France where he roomed with supply officer Ed Thomas. Roosevelt had one confirmed kill of a German aircraft during the German spring offensive, which he shot down on July 10, 1918. Four days later, in a massive aerial engagement at the commencement of the Second Battle of the Marne, he was himself shot down behind German lines.

Captain Eddie Rickenbacker, commander of the 94th Aero Squadron (also known as the &quot;Hat-in-the-Ring&quot; Squadron), in his memoirs described Roosevelt&#x27;s character as a soldier and pilot in the following words:

Quentin&#x27;s plane (a Nieuport 28) was shot down in aerial combat over Chamery, a hamlet of Coulonges-en-Tardenois (now Coulonges-Cohan). He was killed by two machine gun bullets which struck him in the head. The German military buried him with full battlefield honors. Since the plane had crashed so near the front lines, they used two pieces of basswood saplings, bound together with wire from his Nieuport, to fashion a cross for his grave. For propaganda purposes, they made a postcard of the dead pilot and his plane. However, this was met with shock in Germany, which still held Theodore Roosevelt in high respect and was impressed that a former president&#x27;s son died on active duty. According to his service record, the site was at Marne Grave #1 Isolated Commune #102, Coulongue Aisne. The French government posthumously awarded him the Croix de Guerre with Palm.

===Final combat flight and death===

Three German pilots have been credited with Quentin&#x27;s shootdown and death at various times, and all three of them may have been his killer. Leutnant Karl Thom of Jasta 21, one of the greatest German flying aces of the war, was in the vicinity and had confirmed kills nearby; he was often credited with Quentin&#x27;s downing, but never claimed the kill. Leutnant Christian Donhauser of Jasta 17 claimed credit and publicized himself as Quentin&#x27;s killer after the war. Sergeant Carl Graeper of Jasta 50 also claimed credit, but if he did fire the fatal shots, it was his only kill during the war. All three of them may have been in the dogfight which claimed Quentin&#x27;s life.

In 1921, Quentin&#x27;s brother Kermit edited and published &quot;Quentin Roosevelt: A Sketch with Letters&quot;, consisting of Quentin&#x27;s letters from France as well as tributes to Quentin written after his death. Pages 169–171 describe the circumstances of Quentin&#x27;s last flight and death. On one page is a letter home from another American pilot, Lieutenant Edward Buford, detailing Quentin&#x27;s final mission. Buford, like Quentin, was also reported as missing in action, but he managed to land safely at a French aerodrome. He had witnessed Quentin&#x27;s last fight from the air, and described it to his family several months later:

Kermit continued:
Not long afterward, a German official bulletin was found on a prisoner:

At the time of a struggle between a German Pursuit squadron of seven aircraft and twelve American pursuit aviators above the Marne, a fight took place between the German pursuit pilot, a non-commissioned officer named Greper, and an American pilot. After a long fight, the German flyer succeeded in bringing down his gallant antagonist.

The hostile airman had been killed by two bullets in the head. He was identified by his papers as Lieutenant Roosevelt, of the U.S.A. Flying Corps.

A clipping from the Kölnische Zeitung obtained through the Spanish Embassy gave this account of the fight:

The aviator of the American Squadron, Quentin Roosevelt, in trying to break through the airzone over the Marne, met the death of a hero. A formation of seven German airplanes, while crossing the Marne, saw in the neighborhood of Dormans a group of twelve American fighting airplanes and attacked them. A lively air battle began, in which one American (Quentin) in particular persisted in attacking. The principal feature of the battle consisted in an air duel between the American and a German fighting pilot named Sergeant Greper. After a short struggle, Greper succeeded in bringing the brave American just before his gun-sights. After a few shots the plane apparently got out of his control; the American began to fall and struck the ground near the village of Chamery, about ten kilometers north of the Marne. The American flier was killed by two shots through the head. Papers in his pocket showed him to be Quentin Roosevelt, of the United States army. His effects are being taken care of in order to be sent to his relatives. He was buried by German aviators with military honors. The German pilot who shot down Quentin Roosevelt told me of counting twenty bullet holes in his machine when he landed after the fight. He survived the war but was killed in an accident while engaged in delivering German airplanes to the American Forces under the terms of the Armistice.

Funeral services held by the Germans were witnessed on July fifteenth by Captain James E. Gee of the 110th Infantry, who had been captured and was being evacuated to the rear. Gee passed through Chamery, the little village near which the plane crashed to earth. He thus describes the scene:

In a hollow square about the open grave were assembled approximately one thousand German soldiers, standing stiffly in regular lines. They were dressed in field gray uniforms, wore steel helmets, and carried rifles. Near the grave was a smashed plane, and beside it was a small group of officers, one of whom was speaking to the men. &quot;I did not pass close enough to hear what he was saying; we were prisoners and did not have the privilege of lingering, even for such an occasion as this. At the time I did not know who was being buried, but the guards informed me later. The funeral certainly was elaborate. I was told afterward by Germans that they paid Lieut. Roosevelt such honor not only because he was a gallant aviator, who died fighting bravely against odds, but because he was the son of Colonel Roosevelt whom they esteemed as one of the greatest Americans.

On July 18, in a great allied counter-attack, the village where Quentin fell was retaken from the Germans, and his grave was found by some American soldiers. At its head was a wooden cross, on which was printed:

: Leutnant Q. Roosevelt
: Honored and Buried by the Imperial German Army.

Following the custom that sprang up in the chivalrous environment of the air services, the broken propeller blades and bent and scarred wheels of the plane were marking his resting-place.

Nearby lay the shattered remains of the airplane, with the seventy-six &quot;wound stripes&quot; which Quentin had painted on it, still to be seen.
The engineer regiment of the division that had retaken Chamery marked the spot where the airplane fell, and raised a cross at the grave with the inscription

The French placed an oaken enclosure with a head-born reading:

English:

After his grave came under Allied control, thousands of American soldiers visited it to pay their respects. Roosevelt&#x27;s resting place became a shrine and an inspiration to his comrades in arms. His death was a great personal loss to his father, who understood quite well that he had encouraged his son&#x27;s entry into the War. It is said that he never fully recovered from his son&#x27;s death. Within six months, Theodore himself would be dead.

In 1955, eleven years after the World War II American Cemetery was established in France at Colleville-sur-Mer, Quentin&#x27;s body was exhumed and moved there. Quentin&#x27;s remains were moved in order to be buried next to his eldest brother Ted, who had died of a heart attack in France in 1944, shortly after leading his troops in landings on Utah Beach on D-Day as Assistant 4th Infantry Division Commander (an act which would earn him the Medal of Honor). Quentin&#x27;s original gravestone was moved to Sagamore Hill to serve as a cenotaph for the former president&#x27;s son. The German-made basswood cross that marked Quentin&#x27;s original gravesite is on display at the National Museum of the United States Air Force, at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, in Dayton, Ohio.

==Commemorations==
In June 2007, several Roosevelt family members as well as members of the Theodore Roosevelt Association (TRA) visited the small monument in France at the French village over which Quentin was shot down in 1918. Their purpose was to restore the monument and prepare a report to the TRA on the work accomplished by this trip.

Quentin Roosevelt II (1919–1948), the third and youngest son of Ted, was named after Quentin, and also died in a plane crash.

On July 14, 2008, on the 90th anniversary of Quentin&#x27;s death, the villages of Saints, Mauperthuis and Touquin held a commemoration of Quentin Roosevelt. Roosevelt was billeted in the village of Mauperthuis and based in Saints at the time of his death.

On Sainte-Marie-à-Py the Aux Morts des Armées de Champagne monument was made in 1923 by sculptor Maxime Real del Sarte.

On June 28, 2009, on the 90th anniversary of the departure of the USAS from Issoudun, Issoudun held a ceremony in honor of the American aviators and also included Quentin Roosevelt&#x27;s name on the new plaque.

The community of Quentin, Pennsylvania, in Lebanon County, was named for Quentin Roosevelt.

There is a street in Château-Thierry, France named rue Quentin Roosevelt in his honor. Château-Thierry held a series of events and exhibitions in honor of the memory of Quentin Roosevelt in 2010.

Quentin Road in Brooklyn, New York, originally called Avenue Q, was renamed in 1922, possibly in honor of Quentin Roosevelt.

Garden City, New York has a Quentin Roosevelt Boulevard. Its Roosevelt Field – formerly an airfield and now site of Roosevelt Field Mall – was named for Quentin Roosevelt.

The French village Sancy-les-Cheminots in Aisne remembers Quentin Roosevelt in its &quot;Jardin de souvenir&quot; (&quot;Garden of remembrance&quot;). Formerly Sancy, this village was completely destroyed and has been rebuilt by donations of the railway workers (fr:&quot;cheminots&quot;) and of American donors, among them Mme Theodore Roosevelt and Mme Emily Carow, godmother of Quentin Roosevelt.

Quentin Roosevelt Blvd. on Naval Air Station (NAS) North Island, San Diego, CA is named in his honor.
A young Quentin Roosevelt and his father, Theodore Roosevelt, are mentioned in the 1953 children&#x27;s story book &quot;Brighty of the Grand Canyon&quot; on the occasion of Quentin&#x27;s first mountain lion hunt.

<text>Elwood is an inner suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, 8 km south-east of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the City of Port Phillip local government area. Elwood recorded a population of 15,153 at the 2021 census.

Elwood Beach is a popular bayside beach destination during summer, where the beaches are used recreationally for windsurfing, cycling, cricket and walking.

The suburb is known for its mix of Edwardian and Interwar architecture character, its beaches and its leafy streets, many of which are lined by London Plane trees.

==History==
The earliest inhabitants and traditional owners of the area now covered by the City of Port Phillip were the Yalukit Wilum, one of the five clans of the Boon Wurrung, known as the coastal tribe, and who were members of the Kulin nation. They inhabited the swampy areas below Emerald Hill and the sandy-ridged ti-tree covered coastline, which extended from St Kilda to Fishermans Bend (Port Melbourne). The Aboriginal inhabitants knew the St Kilda area as Euro-Yroke a name they used to describe the red-brown sandstone found along the beach. Yalukit Willam: The river people of Port Phillip, provides an Aboriginal history of the area.

On 17 April 1840, the ship &quot;Glen Huntly&quot; carrying 157 settlers, arrived in Port Phillip flying the yellow fever flag, indicating disease on board. At least 50 of its passengers were sick with typhus fever. A quarantine station, comprising two tent camps, was quickly set up at Point Ormond (then known as Little Red Bluff) for the arrivals, one camp for the sick ones and one for the others. The arrivals were release from quarantine in June. At least three arrivals died at the camp and were buried on the bluff. They were moved to St Kilda Cemetery in 1898.

Point Ormond had for centuries been the home of the Yalukit Willam clan. &quot;The nearby Elwood swamp provided vegetables, wildfowl and eels. The reef which extends from the base of the Point into the sea provided shellfish, fish and crustaceans. Point Ormond was a very important source of seafood as Aboriginal women were visiting there three times per week in the autumn of 1840 to collect shellfish&quot;. The quarantine station was set up right alongside these wetlands. However, Aboriginal people, not aware of the establishment of the dangerous camp, made a routine visit to these wetlands to harvest shellfish. This visit was cited by then Superintendent of the Port Phillip District Charles La Trobe as a reason to expel all Aboriginal camps from Melbourne on 19 April 1840.

Originally, Elwood was swampland, with Elster Creek draining into the swamp near the beach. For most of the 19th century the wetland was viewed as a barrier to European development. Elwood Canal was constructed to connect the lower reaches of Elster Creek with Port Phillip Bay, three hundred metres north of Point Ormond. European settlement used waterways like Elster Creek for waste disposal. In 1869, because of the foul conditions of the Elwood swamp, local residents called on the St Kilda Council to remove the nearby abattoir and night soil depot.

Installation of the Elwood Canal turned Elwood into an area suitable for residential development. Elwood was initially planned around the two central geographic features of Elster Creek (now Elwood Canal) and the promontory at Point Ormond, then known as Little Red Bluff. Originally a working middle class suburb in the early part of the 20th century, Elwood has seen waves of gentrification and is now one of Melbourne&#x27;s most sought after bayside suburb. Large period houses, many from the 1920s and 30s with art deco touches, along with proximity to beach and foreshore, have made the area very attractive.

In the late 1970s, like nearby St Kilda, Elwood was known for its nightlife and developed a reputation as a cabaret area. Many of these venues operated out of some of the suburb&#x27;s quirkier old buildings. As the scene saw a demise in the early 1980s, many buildings, including Maison de Luxe and Moulin Rouge (which operated out of the 1880s mansion &quot;Pladda&quot; built for Captain A. Currie), were subsequently demolished.

Despite its history of adversity, a modern suburb now thrives by the bay in one of Melbourne&#x27;s most prized locations. Café life in the Elwood village seems a long way from the flood, fire and fever of earlier days. Coloured lorikeets flock to the green corridors of shady trees, a native forest has been planted on the foreshore and the once despised canal area is undergoing rejuvenation as a haven for walkers and cyclists.

==Population==

In the 2016 Census, there were 15,543 people in Elwood. 65.0% of people were born in Australia. The next most common countries of birth were England 4.9%, New Zealand 2.8%, Ireland 1.1%, United States of America 1.1% and India 1.1%. 76.6% of people spoke only English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Greek 1.5%, Italian 1.4%, Russian 1.1%, Spanish 1.1% and French 1.1%. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 48.4% and Catholic 17.0%.

==Local landmarks==

Elwood Village consist mainly of the group of shops starting on New Street, through Ormond road to Glen Huntly Road. With many iconic restaurants and cafes, famous beauty shops and pet groomers/shop, and traditional boutique barbershops.

===Parks and open space===
For such an established leafy suburb, Elwood is highly built up and lacking in open space. The most popular and largest reserves are bayside, including Elwood Beach, Elwood Canal, and Point Ormond Reserve. The beach and canal are known to suffer from litter pollution and the canal has a distinctive smell resulting from the backflow of seaweed. However, the local council has strategies in place to manage these issues.

===Residential architecture===
Elwood is known for its mix of Victorian mansions, Edwardian cottages and interwar apartment buildings. Infill development in recent decades has changed the character of the suburb, however, some examples still remain.

* Sherwood Hall, formerly named &quot;Rotherfield&quot;, is a large Victorian (45 room) mansion at 14 Hennessy Avenue. It was built between 1890 and 1891 by David C. Askew of Twentyman &amp; Askew (architects), for Joseph Cowen Syme, who was a co-owner of &quot;The Age&quot; newspaper, for some 12 years. Upon the death of Laura Syme (J.C. Symes&#x27; widow) in the 1920s, the mansion was turned into flats. Sherwood Hall is listed in the Port Phillip Heritage Review, 1998.
* Woy Woy is the earliest of a small group of multi-storied modernist flats in Elwood, it is also the earliest of its kind in Melbourne. Built in 1925–1936 the flats were designed by Mewton &amp; Grounds. Woy Woy is located at 77 Marine Parade, Elwood, Victoria, Australia. The design of the apartment block is extremely minimal. The interlocking cubic forms in the design reveal an interest in architect Willem Dudok.
* Architect and resident Esmond Dorney, who is best known for his post war Modernist residential work in Tasmania, designed several flats in Elwood in the 1930s including St Kiernan&#x27;s Flats (51 Ormond Esplanade), Antigone Flats (34 Docker Street) and Winderemere (49 Broadway).
* La Tourelle flats, 47A Brighton Road, corner of Dickens Street, is one of the many large blocks of interwar flats in the area, around Brighton Road.
* Belmac flats on the corner of Goldsmith Street and Mitford Street &#x27;Belmac&#x27;, designed by James Wardrop, built in 1943

===Places of worship===

* St. Columba&#x27;s Catholic Church and school, 26 Glen Huntly Road, opened in 1927.
* Elwood Presbyterian, 31A Scott Street.
* Elwood Shule, congregation established in 1938, first stage of present building at 39 Dickens Street. Opened 1957.

==Education==

Elwood houses a number of schools, considering its limited area. There are 2 primary schools, one offers a catholic education. Saint Columba&#x27;s Primary is located adjacent to the church and has access to a large number of facilities. There is also a large public school, Elwood Primary School. Elwood is also serviced by a local secondary school, Elwood College, previously named Elwood High School.

==Sport==

Elwood Sailing Club was founded in 1924 as Elwood Sea Canoe Club and has since hosted many national and international championships, including 12m2 Sharpie sailing in the 1956 Melbourne Olympics and the 2005 World Formula Windsurfing Titles. ESC now boasts extensive sailing, training and social facilities and the clubrooms are available to the general public for function hire. 
Elwood has a full-time lifesaving club.

An active Triathlon club operates in Elwood and the main beach hosts several triathlons each year.

Elwood Park is home to a touch football club, tennis club and croquet club. Between 1881 and 1980 there was Elwood Football Club (soccer), later reforming as Elwood City Soccer Club.

Elwood Bowls club located at Elsternwick Park, in front of the Elsternwick Hotel. The demographic of the members are from all ages and the clubhouse is a good venue for your functions.

==Transport==

The main form of transport is the private automobile and bus. The major roads are on its periphery and include multi-lane Brighton Road, Marine Parade, Barkly Street and Glen Huntly Road.

Elwood was once serviced by two tram routes, the St Kilda to Brighton &quot;electric street railway&quot; which was operated by the Victorian Railways, and the route 11 tram between East Malvern and Point Ormond which was operated by MMTB. The St Kilda to Brighton route ran north-south through Elwood, via Mitford St, Broadway, Ormond Rd, and St Kilda Rd. The route 11 tram ran east-west, along Glen Huntly Rd, crossing paths with the St Kilda to Brighton route at Elwood Junction.

Elwood is serviced by the Bayside Trail bicycle path. This path is used by commuters and also recreationally and it includes a roller-skating path, used by rollerbladers.

Tram route 67 (Carnegie) runs along the northern boundary of the suburb, along Brighton Road/Nepean Highway to the city or via Elsternwick (past Elsternwick railway station) to Carnegie.

The nearest railway stations are about beyond the northern boundary of the suburb, at either Ripponlea or Elsternwick (both across Brighton Road/Nepean Highway).

Elwood is also served by a number of bus routes:

* Number 630 runs from Ormond Road Elwood to Gardenvale Station, Ormond Station, Huntingdale to Monash University in Clayton.

<doc id="1091175" wikidata="Q1197236" url="?curid=1091175" title="The Guru (2002 film)">
<text>The Guru is a 2002 sex comedy film written by Tracey Jackson and directed by Daisy von Scherler Mayer. The film centers on a dance teacher who comes to the United States from India to pursue a normal career but incidentally stumbles into a brief but high-profile career as a sex guru, a career based on a philosophy he learns from a pornographic actress.

The film stars Jimi Mistry as the eponymous character, Heather Graham as the actress he learns from, and Marisa Tomei, who helps him reach his guru status among her socialite New York City friends.

==Plot==
Ramu Gupta (Jimi Mistry), a dance teacher, leaves his native city Delhi, India, to seek his fortune in the United States. He is lured by the exaggerations of his cousin, Vijay, who has already moved to NYC.

Seeking work as an actor, the naïve Ramu unknowingly lands a role in a pornographic film. That evening he accompanies Vijay and his roommates on a catering job at a society birthday party. When the Indian swami hired to address the party falls into drunken oblivion, Ramu takes his place. Lacking a real philosophy, he improvises by repeating advice he had been given by Sharonna (Heather Graham), an adult film actress he met earlier. Lexi (Marisa Tomei), the birthday girl, is so impressed that she promotes him as a New Age sex guru to her friends.

Ramu hires Sharonna, ostensibly for advice on how to be an actor in adult films, though what he really wants is more ideas he could use in his new role as the guru of sex. A personal relationship develops between them, though Sharonna is engaged to a firefighter who thinks she&#x27;s a substitute school teacher.

Ramu becomes an overnight celebrity, widely known as a spiritual leader - the Guru of Sex. The fame comes at a price, however, and he must choose between his newfound fame and his feelings for Sharonna.

Ramu has a national television appearance where he admits to being a fraud, but passes the torch to Lexi, then hurries across town to stop Sharonna&#x27;s wedding. At the door to the church Ramu coincides with her fiancé&#x27;s secret gay lover Randy (Bobby Cannavale). They both object to the wedding, being in love with the bride and groom. The film ends with a Bollywood dance number, followed by Ramu and Sharonna getting into a car and driving off into the sky, in a parody of the ending scene of &quot;Grease&quot;.

==Cast==
==Production==
&quot;The Guru&quot; was filmed in 2001, mostly on location in New York City, though a few scenes were filmed in Delhi.

Locations in New York City included Times Square, Manhattan&#x27;s Chinatown, Central Park, Hunts Point, Queens, Brooklyn, the George Washington Bridge, and close to the World Trade Center (the shot was not removed after the September 11 attacks). Ramu&#x27;s Broadway debut was filmed at Reverend Ike&#x27;s United Palace Theater, while the setting for the finale was Bethlehem Lutheran Church in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.

==Music==
The film features several Bollywood-style song-and-dance numbers, including one where Ramu and Sharonna sing a version of &quot;Kya Mil Gaya&quot; from &quot;Sasural&quot; that morphs into a version of &quot;You&#x27;re the One That I Want&quot; from &quot;Grease&quot;. The song &quot;Every Kinda People&quot; by Jo O&#x27;Meara of S Club 7 fame is used in the film&#x27;s end credits, and also included is &quot;One Way Or Another&quot; by Sophie Ellis-Bextor, &quot;Don&#x27;t Say Goodbye&quot; from Paulina Rubio&#x27;s Border Girl album. &quot;Round Round&quot; by Sugababes also features.

==Release==
&quot;The Guru&quot; opened in wide release in United Kingdom, and it eventually grossed $10 million - a solid box office success in United Kingdom. In the United States, the film grossed a respectful $3 million in limited theatrical release. Overall, the film grossed $24 million in worldwide box office against its budget of $11 million.

===Critical reception===
On the movie review aggregator site Rotten Tomatoes, &quot;The Guru&quot; has a 57% rating, with 50 of 88 reviewers giving the film a &quot;fresh&quot; rating. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;A sweetly silly but wafer-thin romantic comedy.&quot; Based on 30 reviews, the film&#x27;s Metacritic score is 47 (&quot;mixed&quot;).

After viewing it at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, Derek Elley, reviewing it for &quot;Variety&quot;, called it a &quot;generally entertaining but rather old-fashioned sex comedy&quot; whose &quot;basic plot of a naive Indian stumbling through white U.S. society...shows little advance in attitudes and humor on Blake Edwards&#x27; 1968 comedy &quot;The Party&quot;.&quot; A BBC review said it &quot;stirs together Bollywood and Hollywood, satire and romance, to create an appealing masala dish of a movie.&quot;

After its U.S. premiere, Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called it a &quot;nervy conceptual hybrid&quot; that &quot;lurch[es] between a loudmouthed sitcom and a crude social satire&quot; and noted that &quot;behind its Hollywood-meets-Bollywood banner, &quot;The Guru&quot;... is a grindingly conventional comedy that insists on tying up its subplots in pretty ribbons and bows.&quot;

<doc id="1091190" wikidata="Q2746536" url="?curid=1091190" title="Killing of Muhammad al-Durrah">
<text>On 30 September 2000, the second day of the Second Intifada, 12-year-old Muhammad al-Durrah () was killed at the Netzarim Junction in the Gaza Strip during widespread protests and riots across the Palestinian territories against Israeli military occupation. Jamal al-Durrah and his son Muhammad were filmed by Talal Abu Rahma, a Palestinian television cameraman freelancing for France 2, as they were caught in crossfire between the Israeli military and Palestinian security forces. Footage shows them crouching behind a concrete cylinder, the boy crying and the father waving, then a burst of gunfire and dust. Muhammad is shown slumping as he is mortally wounded by gunfire, dying soon after.

Fifty-nine seconds of the footage were broadcast on television in France with a voiceover from Charles Enderlin, the station&#x27;s bureau chief in Israel. Based on information from the cameraman, Enderlin told viewers that the al-Durrahs had been the target of fire from the Israeli positions and that the boy had died. After an emotional public funeral, Muhammad was hailed throughout the Muslim world as a martyr.

Initially, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) accepted responsibility for the shooting, but claimed that Palestinians used children as human shields; the IDF retracted its admission of responsibility in 2005. In 2000, the IDF commissioned Nahum Shahaf to investigate, producing a report which provoked widespread criticism. One of the Israeli investigators even claimed the incident had been staged by Palestinian gunmen, cameraman and Muhammad&#x27;s own father. The report eventually concluded that Muhammad was possibly killed by Palestinian fire. However, a Palestinian investigation that same year concluded Muhammad was killed by bullets that came from the Israeli post.

In 2012, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu commissioned another investigation. In 2013, that report concluded that not only was Muhammad not hit by IDF fire, Muhammad was perhaps never shot nor killed. Jamal al-Durrah rejected the idea that his son was somehow not dead and offered to exhume Muhammad&#x27;s grave. The report was criticized by Charles Enderlin and France 2, Reporters Without Borders and Barak Ravid. In France, Philippe Karsenty, a media commentator, also alleged that the scene had been staged by France 2; France 2 sued him for libel in 2006 leading to Karsenty&#x27;s eventual conviction in 2013 for the allegation. 

The footage of the father and son acquired what one writer called the power of a battle flag. Postage stamps in the Middle East carried the images. Abu Rahma&#x27;s coverage of the al-Durrah shooting brought him several journalism awards, including the Rory Peck Award in 2001.

==Background==
On 28 September 2000, two days before the shooting, the Israeli opposition leader Ariel Sharon visited the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, a holy site in both Judaism and Islam with contested rules of access. The violence that followed had its roots in several events, but the visit was provocative and triggered protests that escalated into rioting across the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The uprising became known as the Second Intifada; it lasted over four years and cost around 4,000 lives, over 3,000 of them Palestinian.

The Netzarim junction, where the shooting took place, is known locally as the &quot;al-Shohada&quot; (martyrs&#x27;) junction. It lies on Saladin Road, a few kilometres south of Gaza City. The source of conflict at the junction was the nearby Netzarim settlement, where 60 Israeli families lived until Israel&#x27;s withdrawal from Gaza in 2005. A military escort accompanied the settlers whenever they left or arrived at the settlement, and an Israeli military outpost, Magen-3, guarded the approach. The area had been the scene of violent incidents in the days before the shooting.

==People==

===Jamal and Muhammad al-Durrah===

Jamal al-Durrah (; born c. 1963) was a carpenter and house painter before the shooting. Since then, because of his injuries, he has worked as a truck driver. He and his wife, Amal, live in the UNRWA-run Bureij refugee camp in the Gaza Strip. As of 2013 they had four daughters and six sons, including a boy, Muhammad, born two years after the shooting.

Until the shooting, Jamal had worked for Moshe Tamam, an Israeli contractor, for 20 years, since he was 14. Writer Helen Schary Motro came to know Jamal when she employed him to help build her house in Tel Aviv. She described his years of rising at 3:30 am to catch the bus to the border crossing at four, then a second bus out of Gaza so he could be at work by six. Tamam called him a &quot;terrific man,&quot; someone he trusted to work alone in his customers&#x27; homes.

During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, both of Jamal Al-Durrah’s brothers were killed by Israeli airstrikes, and he was seen mourning next to their body bags.

Muhammad Jamal Al-Durrah (born 1988) was in fifth grade, but his school was closed on 30 September 2000; the Palestinian Authority had called for a general strike and day of mourning following violence in Jerusalem the day before. His mother said he had been watching the rioting on television and asked if he could join in. Father and son decided instead to go to a car auction. Jamal had just sold his 1974 Fiat, Motro wrote, and Muhammad loved cars, so they went to the auction together.

===Charles Enderlin===
Charles Enderlin was born in 1945 in Paris; his grandparents were Austrian Jews who had left the country in 1938 when Germany invaded. After briefly studying medicine, he moved to Jerusalem in 1968 where he became an Israeli national. He began working for France 2 in 1981, serving as their bureau chief in Israel from 1990 until his retirement in 2015. Enderlin is the author of several books about the Middle East, including one about Muhammad al-Durrah, &quot;Un Enfant est Mort: Netzarim, 30 Septembre 2000&quot; (2010). Highly regarded among his peers and within the French establishment, he submitted a letter from Jacques Chirac, during the Philippe Karsenty libel action, who wrote in flattering terms of Enderlin&#x27;s integrity. In 2009, he was awarded France&#x27;s highest decoration, the Légion d&#x27;honneur.

According to French journalist Anne-Elisabeth Moutet, Enderlin&#x27;s coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was respected by other journalists but was regularly criticized by pro-Israel groups. As a result of the al-Durrah case, he received death threats, his wife was assaulted in the street, his children were threatened, the family had to move home, and at one point they considered emigrating to the United States.

===Talal Abu Rahma===
Talal Hassan Abu Rahma studied business administration in the United States, and began working as a freelance cameraman for France 2 in Gaza in 1988. At the time of the shooting, he ran his own press office, the National News Center, contributed to CNN through the Al-Wataneya Press Office, and was a board member of the Palestinian Journalists&#x27; Association. His coverage of the al-Durrah shooting brought him several journalism awards, including the Rory Peck Award in 2001. According to France 2 correspondent Gérard Grizbec, Abu Rahma had never been a member of a Palestinian political group, had twice been arrested by Palestinian police for filming images that did not meet the approval of Yasser Arafat, and had never been accused of security breaches by Israel.

==Events of the shooting==

===Before shooting===

On the day of the shooting—Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year—the two-story Israel Defense Forces (IDF) outpost at the Netzarim junction was manned by Israeli soldiers from the Givati Brigade Engineering Platoon and the Herev Battalion. According to Enderlin, the soldiers were Druze.

The two-story IDF outpost sat northwest of the junction. Two six-story Palestinian blocks (known as the twins or twin towers and described variously as offices or apartments) lay directly behind it. South of the junction, diagonally across from the IDF, there was a Palestinian National Security Forces outpost under the command of Brigadier-General Osama al-Ali, a member of the Palestine National Council. The concrete wall that Jamal and Muhammad crouched against was in front of this building; the spot was less than 120 metres from the most northerly point of the Israeli outpost.

In addition to France 2, the Associated Press and Reuters also had camera crews at the junction. They captured brief footage of the al-Durrahs and Abu Rahma. Abu Rahma was the only journalist to film the moment the al-Durrahs were shot.

===Arrival at the junction===
Jamal and Muhammad arrived at the junction in a cab around midday, on their way back from the car auction. There had been a protest, demonstrators had thrown stones, and the IDF had responded with tear gas. Abu Rahma was filming events and interviewing protesters, including Abdel Hakim Awad, head of the Fatah youth movement in Gaza. Because of the protest, a police officer stopped Jamal and Muhammad&#x27;s cab from going any further, so father and son proceeded on foot across the junction. It was at that point, according to Jamal, that the live fire started. Enderlin said the first shots were fired from the Palestinian positions and returned by the Israeli soldiers.

Jamal, Muhammad, the Associated Press cameraman, and Shams Oudeh, the Reuters cameraman, took cover against the concrete wall in the south-east quadrant of the crossroads, diagonally across from the Israeli outpost. Jamal, Muhammad and Shams Oudeh crouched behind a three-foot-tall (0.91 m) concrete drum, apparently part of a culvert, that was sitting against the wall. A thick paving stone sat on top of the drum, which offered further protection. Abu Rahma hid behind a white minibus parked across the road about 15 metres away from the wall. The Reuters and Associated Press cameramen briefly filmed over Jamal and Muhammad&#x27;s shoulders—the cameras pointing toward the Israeli outpost—before the men moved away. Jamal and Muhammad did not move away, but stayed behind the drum for 45 minutes. In Enderlin&#x27;s view, they were frozen in fear.
===France 2 report===

In an affidavit three days after the shooting, Abu Rahma said shots had been fired for about 45 minutes and that he had filmed around 27 minutes of it. (How much film was shot became a bone of contention in 2007 when France 2 told a court that only 18 minutes of film existed.) He began filming Jamal and Muhammad when he heard Muhammad cry and saw that the boy had been shot in the right leg. He said he filmed the scene containing the father and son for about six minutes. He sent those six minutes to Enderlin in Jerusalem via satellite. Enderlin edited the footage down to 59 seconds and added a voiceover:

The footage shows Jamal and Muhammad crouching behind the cylinder, the child screaming and the father shielding him. Jamal appears to shout something in the direction of the cameraman, then waves and shouts in the direction of the Israeli outpost. There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.

The raw footage stops suddenly at this point and begins again with unidentified people being loaded into an ambulance. (At that point in his report, Enderlin said: &quot;A Palestinian policeman and an ambulance driver have also lost their lives in the course of this battle.&quot;) Bassam al-Bilbeisi, an ambulance driver on his way to the scene, was reported to have been shot and killed, leaving a widow and eleven children. Abu Rahma said Muhammad lay bleeding for at least 17 minutes before an ambulance picked up father and son together. He said he did not film them being picked up because he was worried about having only one battery. Abu Rahma remained at the junction for 30–40 minutes until he felt it was safe to leave, then drove to his studio in Gaza City to send the footage to Enderlin. The 59 seconds of footage were first broadcast on France 2&#x27;s nightly news at 8:00 pm local time (GMT+2), after which France 2 distributed several minutes of raw footage around the world without charge.

===Funeral===

Jamal and Muhammad were taken by ambulance to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City. Abu Rahma telephoned the hospital and was told that three bodies had arrived there: that of a jeep driver, an ambulance driver, and a boy, initially mistakenly identified as Rami Al-Durrah.

According to Abed El-Razeq El Masry, the pathologist who examined Muhammed, the boy had received a fatal injury to the abdomen. In 2002, he showed Esther Schapira, a German journalist, post-mortem images of Muhammad next to identity cards identifying him by name. Schapira also obtained, from a Palestinian journalist, footage of Muhammad arriving at Al-Shifa Hospital on a stretcher. 

During an emotional public funeral in Bureij, Muhammad was wrapped in a Palestinian flag and buried before sundown on the day of his death, in accordance with Muslim tradition.

Jamal was taken at first to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza. One of the surgeons who operated on him, Ahmed Ghadeel, said Jamal had received multiple wounds from high-velocity bullets striking his right elbow, right thigh and the lower part of both legs; his femoral artery was also cut. Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there on camera the day after the shooting; Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal&#x27;s right elbow and right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal&#x27;s Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred instead to the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by King Abdullah. Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had been hit by nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in a hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.

===Abu Rahma&#x27;s account===
Talal Abu Rahma, the Palestinian cameraman for Enderlin, alleged that the IDF had shot Muhammad and his father. Abu Rahma was clear in interviews that the Israelis had fired the shots. For example, he told &quot;The Guardian&quot;: &quot;They were cleaning the area. Of course they saw the father. They were aiming at the boy, and that is what surprised me, yes, because they were shooting at him, not only one time, but many times.&quot; He said shooting was also coming from the Palestinian National Security Forces outpost, but that they were not shooting when Muhammad was hit. The Israeli fire was being directed at this Palestinian outpost, he said. He told National Public Radio:

Abu Rahma said in an affidavit that &quot;the child was intentionally and in cold blood shot dead and his father injured by the Israeli army.&quot; The affidavit was given to the Palestinian Centre for Human Rights in Gaza and signed by Abu Rahma in the presence of Raji Sourani, a human rights lawyer. 

Abu Rahma said there was intense exchange of fire between Israelis and Palestinians, but the Durrahs had not been shot during that period. Instead, after that exchange of fire, there was sustained fire from the Israeli outpost for around 30 minutes and it is during that time that both the father and son had been shot.

===Israel&#x27;s response===

The position of the IDF changed over time, from accepting responsibility in 2000 to retracting the admission in 2005. The IDF&#x27;s first response, when Enderlin contacted them before his broadcast, was that the Palestinians &quot;make cynical use of women and children,&quot; which he decided not to air.

On 3 October 2000, the IDF&#x27;s chief of operations, Major-General Giora Eiland, said an internal investigation indicated the shots had apparently been fired by Israeli soldiers. The soldiers, under fire, had been shooting from small slits in the wall of their outpost; General Yom-Tov Samia, then head of the IDF&#x27;s Southern Command said they may not have had a clear field of vision, and had fired in the direction from which they believed the fire was coming. Eiland issued an apology: &quot;This was a grave incident, an event we are all sorry about.&quot;

The Israelis had been trying for hours to speak to Palestinian commanders, according to Israel&#x27;s Cabinet Secretary, Isaac Herzog; he added that Palestinian security forces could have intervened to stop the fire.

After the shooting, the Israeli army proceeded to destroy much of the physical evidence, including razing the wall behind Muhammad al-Durrah. The IDF justified this by arguing it needed to remove hiding places for Palestinian gunmen.

==Controversy==
Three mainstream narratives emerged after the shooting. The early view that Israeli gunfire had killed the boy developed into the position that, because of the trajectory of the shots, Palestinian gunfire was more likely to have been responsible. This view was expressed in 2005 by Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;, and , a former France 2 correspondent, who viewed the raw footage. A third perspective, held by Arlette Chabot, France 2&#x27;s news editor, is that no one can know who fired the shots.

A fourth, minority, position held that the scene was staged by Palestinian protesters to produce a child martyr or at least the appearance of one. This is known by those who follow the case as the &quot;maximalist&quot; view, as opposed to the &quot;minimalist&quot; view that the shots were probably not fired by the IDF. The maximalist view takes the form either that the al-Durrahs were not shot and Muhammad did not die, or that he was killed intentionally by Palestinians.

The view that the scene was a media hoax of some kind emerged from an Israeli government enquiry in November 2000. It was most persistently pursued by Stéphane Juffa, editor-in-chief of the (Mena), a French-Israeli company; Luc Rosenzweig, former editor-in-chief of &quot;Le Monde&quot; and a Mena contributor; Richard Landes, an American historian who became involved after Enderlin showed him the raw footage during a visit to Jerusalem in 2003; and Philippe Karsenty, founder of a French media-watchdog site, &quot;Media-Ratings&quot;. It was also supported by , a French psychoanalyst, and Pierre-André Taguieff, a French philosopher who specializes in antisemitism, both of whom wrote books about the affair. The hoax view gained further support in 2013 from a second Israeli government report, the Kuperwasser report. Several commentators regard it as a right-wing conspiracy theory and smear campaign.

===Key issues===
Several commentators questioned what time the shooting occurred; what time Muhammad arrived at the hospital; why there seemed to be little blood on the ground where they were shot; and whether any bullets were collected. Several alleged that, in other scenes in the raw footage, it is clear that protesters are play acting. One physician maintained that Jamal&#x27;s scars were not from bullet wounds, but dated back to an injury he sustained in the early 1990s.

There was no criminal inquiry. Palestinian police allowed journalists to photograph the scene the following day, but they gathered no forensic evidence. According to a Palestinian general, there was no Palestinian investigation because there was no doubt that the Israelis had killed the boy. General Yom Tov Samia of the IDF said the presence of protesters meant the Israelis were unable to examine and take photographs of the scene. The increase in violence at the junction cut off the Nezarim settlers, so the IDF evacuated them and, a week after the shooting, blew up everything within 500 metres of the IDF outpost, thereby destroying the crime scene.

A pathologist examined the boy&#x27;s body, but there was no full autopsy. It is unclear whether bullets were recovered from the scene or from Jamal and Muhammad. In 2002 Abu Rahma implied to Esther Schapira that he had collected bullets at the scene, adding: &quot;We have some secrets for ourselves. We cannot give anything ... everything.&quot; According to Jamal al-Durrah, five bullets were recovered from his body by physicians in Gaza and four in Amman. In 2013 he said, without elaborating: &quot;The bullets the Israelis fired are in the possession of the Palestinian Authority.&quot;

===Footage===

====Length and content====
Questions arose about how much footage existed and whether it showed the boy had died. Abu Rahma said in an affidavit that the gunfight had lasted 45 minutes and that he had filmed about 27 minutes of it. Doreen Carvajal of the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot; said in 2005 that France 2 had shown the newspaper &quot;the original 27-minute tape of the incident.&quot; When the Court of Appeal of Paris asked, in 2007, to see all the footage, during France 2&#x27;s libel case against Philippe Karsenty, France 2 presented the court with 18 minutes of film, saying the rest had been destroyed because it had not been about the shooting. Enderlin then said only 18 minutes of footage had been shot.

According to Abu Rahma, six minutes of his footage focused on the al-Durrahs. France 2 broadcast 59 seconds of that scene and released another few seconds of it. No part of the footage shows the boy dead. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the end, during which Muhammad appears to lift his hand away from his face. Enderlin said he had cut this scene in accordance with the France 2 ethical charter, because it showed the boy in his death throes (&quot;agonie&quot;), the final struggle before death, which he said was &quot;unbearable&quot; (&quot;&quot;J&#x27;ai coupé l&#x27;agonie de l&#x27;enfant. C&#x27;était insupportable ... Cela n&#x27;aurait rien apporté de plus&quot;).

====Footage cut off====
Another issue is why France 2, the Associated Press and Reuters did not film the scene directly after the shooting, including the shooting death of the ambulance driver who arrived to pick up Jamal and Muhammad. Abu Rahma&#x27;s footage stops suddenly after the shooting of the father and son, then begins again—from the same position, with the white minibus behind which Abu Rahma was standing visible in the shot—with other people being loaded into an ambulance.

Abu Rahma said Muhammad lay bleeding for at least 17 minutes before an ambulance picked up Jamal and Muhammad together, but he did not film any of it. When Esther Schapira asked why not, he replied: &quot;Because when the ambulance came it closed on them, you know?&quot; When asked why he had not filmed the ambulance arriving and leaving, he replied that he had only one battery. Enderlin reportedly told the Paris Court of Appeal that Abu Rahma changed batteries at that point. Enderlin wrote in 2008 that &quot;footage filmed by a cameraman under fire is not the equivalent of a surveillance camera in a supermarket.&quot; Abu Rahma &quot;filmed what circumstances permitted.&quot;

====French reaction to the footage====

In October 2004 France 2 allowed three French journalists to view the raw footage—Denis Jeambar, editor-in-chief of &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;; Daniel Leconte, former France 2 correspondent and head of news documentaries at Arte, a state-run television network; and Luc Rosenzweig, former editor-in-chief of &quot;Le Monde&quot;. They also asked to speak to the cameraman, Abu Rahma, who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 apparently told them he did not speak French and that his English was not good enough.

Jeambar and Leconte wrote a report about the viewing for &quot;Le Figaro&quot; in January 2005. None of the scenes showed that the boy had died, they wrote. They rejected the position that the scene had been staged, but when Enderlin&#x27;s voiceover said Muhammad was dead, Enderlin &quot;had no possibility of determining that he was in fact dead, and even less so, that he had been shot by IDF soldiers.&quot; They said the footage did not show the boy&#x27;s death throes: &quot;This famous &#x27;agonie&#x27; that Enderlin insisted was cut from the montage does not exist.&quot;

Several minutes of the film showed Palestinians playing at war for the cameras, they wrote, falling down as if wounded, then getting up and walking away. Jeambar and Leconte concluded that the shots had come from the Palestinian positions, given the trajectory of the bullets.

The idea of writing about the raw footage had been Luc Rosenzweig&#x27;s; he had initially offered a story about it to &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;, which is how Jeambar (editor of &quot;L&#x27;Express&quot;) had become involved. But Jeambar and Leconte ended up distancing themselves from Rosenzweig. He was involved with the Israeli-French Metula News Agency (known as Mena), which was pushing the view that the scene was a fake. Rosenzweig later called it &quot;an almost perfect media crime.&quot; When Jeambar and Leconte wrote up their report about the raw footage, they initially offered it to &quot;Le Monde&quot;, not &quot;Le Figaro&quot;, but &quot;Le Monde&quot; refused to publish it because Mena had been involved at an earlier stage. Jeambar and Leconte made clear in &quot;Le Figaro&quot; that they gave no credence to the staging hypothesis:

====Enderlin&#x27;s response====
Enderlin responded to Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in &quot;Le Figaro&quot;. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had reported that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted the cameraman, who had worked for France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2&#x27;s offers to cooperate with their investigation.

Another reason he had attributed the shooting to Israel, he wrote, was that &quot;the image corresponded to the reality of the situation not only in Gaza but also in the West Bank.&quot; Citing Ben Kaspi in the Israeli newspaper &quot;Maariv&quot;, he wrote that, during the first months of the Second Intifada, the IDF had fired one million rounds of ammunition—700,000 in the West Bank and 300,000 in Gaza; from 29 September to late October 2000, 118 Palestinians had been killed, including 33 under the age of 18, compared to 11 adult Israelis killed during the same period.

===Confusion about timeline===
Confusion arose about the timeline. Abu Rahma said the shooting began at noon and continued for 45 minutes. Jamal&#x27;s account matched his: he and Muhammad arrived at the junction around noon, and were under fire for 45 minutes.

Enderlin&#x27;s France 2 report placed the shooting later in the day. His voiceover said that Jamal and Muhammad were shot around 3:00 pm local time (GMT+3). James Fallows agreed that Jamal and Muhammad first made an appearance in the footage around 3:00 pm, judging by comments from Jamal and some journalists on the scene. Abu Rahma said he remained at the junction for 30–40 minutes after the shooting. According to Schapira, he left for his studio in Gaza at around 4 pm, where he sent the footage to Enderlin in Jerusalem at around 6 pm. The news first arrived in London from the Associated Press at 6:00 pm BST (GMT+1), followed minutes later by a similar report from Reuters.

Contradicting the noon and 3 pm timelines, Mohammed Tawil, the doctor who admitted Muhammad to the Al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City, told Esther Schapira that the boy had been admitted around 10:00 am local time, along with the ambulance driver, who had been shot through the heart. Tawil later said that he could not recall what he had told reporters about this. Records from the Al-Shifa Hospital reportedly show that a young boy was examined in the pathology department at midday. The pathologist, Dr. Abed El-Razeq El Masry, examined him for half an hour. He told Schapira that the boy&#x27;s abdominal organs were lying outside his body, and he showed Schapira images of the body, with a card identifying the boy as Muhammad. A watch on a pathologist&#x27;s wrist in one of the images appeared to say 3:50.

===Interview with soldiers===
In 2002 Schapira interviewed three anonymous Israeli soldiers, &quot;Ariel, Alexej and Idan,&quot; who said they had been on duty at the IDF post that day. They knew something was about to happen, one said, because of the camera crews that had gathered. One soldier said the live fire started from the high-rise Palestinian blocks known as &quot;the twins&quot;; the shooter was firing at the IDF post, he said. The soldier added that he had not seen the al-Durrahs. The Israelis returned fire on a Palestinian station 30 metres to the left of the al-Durrahs. Their weapons were equipped with optics that allowed them to fire accurately, according to the soldier, and none of them had switched to automatic fire. In the view of the soldier, the shooting of Jamal and Muhammad was no accident. The shots did not come from the Israeli position, he said.

===Father&#x27;s injuries===
In 2007 Yehuda David, a hand surgeon at Tel Hashomer Hospital, told Israel&#x27;s Channel 10 that he had treated Jamal Al-Durrah in 1994 for knife and axe wounds to his arms and legs, injuries sustained during a gang attack. David maintained that the scars Jamal had presented as bullet wounds were in fact scars from a tendon-repair operation David had performed in the early 90s. When David repeated his allegations in an interview with a &quot;Daniel Vavinsky,&quot; published in 2008 in &quot;Actualité Juive&quot; in Paris, Jamal filed a complaint with the Tribunal de grande instance de Paris for defamation and breach of doctor-patient confidentiality.

The court established that &quot;Daniel Vavinsky&quot; was a pseudonym for , a deputy editor at France 3. In 2011 it ruled that David and &quot;Actualité Juive&quot; had defamed Jamal. David, Weill-Raynal and Serge Benattar, the managing editor of &quot;Actualité Juive&quot;, were fined €5,000 each, and &quot;Actualité Juive&quot; was ordered to print a retraction. The Israeli government said it would fund David&#x27;s appeal. The appeal was upheld in 2012; David was acquitted of defamation and breach of confidentiality. Benjamin Netanyahu, Israeli&#x27;s prime minister, telephoned David to congratulate him. Jamal Al-Durrah said he would appeal the court&#x27;s decision.

In 2012 Rafi Walden, deputy director of the Tel Hashomer hospital and board member of Physicians for Human Rights, wrote in &quot;Haaretz&quot; that he had received Jamal&#x27;s 50-page medical file from Amman&#x27;s King Hussein Hospital and examined it. The file shows the injuries from the 2000 shooting were &quot;completely different wounds&quot; from the 1994 injuries. The medical files showed &quot;a gunshot wound in the right wrist, a shattered forearm bone, multiple fragment wounds in a palm, gunshot wounds in the right thigh, a fractured pelvis, an exit wound in the buttocks, a tear in the main nerve of the right thigh, tears in the main groin arteries and veins, and two gunshot wounds in the left lower leg.&quot; The medical reports corroborated this diagnosis with photographs, x-rays, surgery reports, and expert consultation reports.

==Israel&#x27;s inquiries==

===2000: Shahaf report===

Major General Yom Tov Samia, the IDF&#x27;s southern commander, set up an inquiry soon after the shooting. According to James Fallows, Israeli commentators questioned its legitimacy as soon as it started; &quot;Haaretz&quot; called it &quot;almost a pirate endeavour.&quot; The team was led by Nahum Shahaf, a physicist, and Joseph Doriel, an engineer, both of whom had been involved in the Yitzhak Rabin assassination conspiracy theories. Other investigators included Meir Danino, chief scientist at Elisra Systems; Bernie Schechter, a ballistics expert, formerly with the Israeli police&#x27;s criminal identification laboratory; and Chief Superintendent Elliot Springer, also from the criminal identification lab. A full list of names was never released.

Shahaf and Doriel built models of the wall, concrete drum and IDF post, and tried to reenact the shooting. A mark on the drum from the Israeli Bureau of Standards allowed them to determine its size and composition. They concluded that the shots may have come from a position behind Abu Rahma, where Palestinian police were alleged to have been standing.

On 23 October 2000, Shahaf and Doriel invited CBS &quot;60 Minutes&quot; to film the reenactment. Doriel told the correspondent, Bob Simon, that he believed the boy&#x27;s death was real, but that it had been staged to damage Israel. Doriel said the actors in this staged incident included the Palestinian gunmen, the cameraman Abu Rahma and even the boy&#x27;s own father &quot;who apparently didn&#x27;t understand that the act would end in the murder of his son&quot;. When General Samia heard about the interview, he removed Doriel from the investigation. 

The investigators&#x27; report was shown to the head of Israeli military intelligence and the key points were published in November 2000. The investigation concluded that while it is possible that Muhammad had been killed by the IDF, it was also &quot;quite plausible&quot; that he had been hit by Palestinian bullets aimed at the IDF post. The report did not include Doriel&#x27;s allegation that the Palestinians had staged the entire incident. The inquiry provoked widespread criticism. A &quot;Haaretz&quot; editorial said, &quot;it is hard to describe in mild terms the stupidity of this bizarre investigation.&quot;

==== Palestinian criticism ====
The reports conclusions were criticized by the Palestinians. Palestinians pointed out that the Israeli army had destroyed most of the physical evidence, including the wall behind the Durrahs that contained the bullet holes, saying it needed to remove hiding places for Palestinian gunmen. Cameraman Talal Abu Rahma said that there had been a period of intense gunfire exchange between the IDF and Palestinian militants, followed by a period in which only the IDF was firing, and that Muhammad was killed during this latter period. Palestinians also criticized the report for concluding that Muhammad had been shot in the back; doctors in Al-Shifa Hospital had concluded that Muhammad had been shot in the abdomen and the back wound was an exit injury.

An investigation by the Palestinian Authority ruled out the possibility that Muhammad was killed by Palestinian fire. Major General Abdel-Razek al-Majaydeh said Muhammad was not shot from behind and the Palestinian investigation concluded the bullets came from the Israeli post.

===2005: Retraction of earlier position===
In 2005 Major-General Giora Eiland publicly retracted the IDF&#x27;s admission of responsibility, and a statement to that effect was approved by the prime minister&#x27;s office in September 2007. The following year an IDF spokesman, Col. Shlomi Am-Shalom, said that the Shahaf report had shown the IDF could not have shot Muhammad. He asked France 2 to send the IDF the unedited 27 minutes of raw footage, as well as footage Abu Rahma shot the following day.

===2013: Kuperwasser report===

In September 2012 the Israeli government set up another inquiry at the request of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, led by Yossi Kuperwasser, director-general of the Strategic Affairs Ministry. In May 2013 it published a 44-page report concluding that the al-Durrahs had not been hit by IDF fire and may not have been shot at all. Muhammad al-Durrah&#x27;s father strongly challenged Israel&#x27;s claim that his son was somehow still alive and offered to have his son&#x27;s grave exhumed for DNA analysis. 

While Netanyahu called the report&#x27;s conclusions &quot;the truth&quot;, the report was criticized by Reporters Without Borders and Israeli journalist Barak Ravid.

==== Report&#x27;s conclusions ====
The Kuperwasser report said that France 2&#x27;s central claims were not substantiated by the material the station had in its possession at the time; that the boy was alive at the end of the video; that there was no evidence that Jamal or Muhammad were injured in the manner reported by France 2 or that Jamal was seriously injured; and that they may not have been shot at all. The report claimed that the body at Muhammad&#x27;s funeral was different from the boy behind the barrel in France 2&#x27;s footage.

The Kuperwasser did not contact Muhammad al-Durrah&#x27;s father during the course of the investigation. Nor did it contact cameraman Abu Rahma or Enderlin – both witnesses to the shooting. It included a medical opinion from Yehuda David, the doctor who treated Jamal in 1994. The report said it is &quot;highly doubtful that bullet holes in the vicinity of the two could have had their source in fire from the Israeli position,&quot; and that the France 2 report was &quot;edited and narrated in such a way as to create the misleading impression that it substantiated the claims made therein.&quot; The France 2 narrative relied entirely on Abu Rahma&#x27;s testimony, the report said. Yuval Steinitz, Minister of International Affairs, Strategy and Intelligence, called the affair a &quot;modern-day blood libel against the State of Israel.&quot;

==== Criticism of the report ====
France 2, Charles Enderlin and Jamal al-Durrah rejected the report&#x27;s conclusions and said they would cooperate with an independent international investigation. France 2 and Enderlin asked the Israeli government to supply the commission&#x27;s letter of appointment, membership and evidence, including photographs and the names of witnesses. Enderlin said the commission had failed to speak to him, France 2, al-Durrah or other eyewitnesses, and had consulted no independent experts. According to Enderlin, France 2 stood ready to help al-Durrah have his son&#x27;s body exhumed; he and al-Durrah said they were willing to take polygraph tests.

American-Israeli journalist Larry Derfner questioned the report&#x27;s conclusions of a coverup:[If] it was all a hoax, how many people would have to be covering it up all this time? Start with the al-Dura family, then the people near the scene of the shooting, at least some of the people at the funeral, plus doctors and nurses at the Gaza hospital and the Amman hospital, plus the Jordanian ambassador to Israel who brought Jamal al-Dura to Amman for treatment...Each and every one of them would have had to keep this incredible secret for 13 years. Yet with all the legions of Palestinian collaborators Israel has managed to conscript over the years despite the danger to their lives, not one Palestinian has ever been found to corroborate the al-Dura conspiracy theory.Israeli journalist Barak Ravid called it &quot;probably one of the least convincing documents produced by the Israeli government in recent years&quot;.

==Philippe Karsenty litigation==

===2006: &quot;Enderlin-France 2 v. Karsenty&quot;===

In response to claims that it had broadcast a staged scene, Enderlin and France 2 filed three defamation suits in 2004 and 2005, seeking symbolic damages of €1. The most notable lawsuit was against Philippe Karsenty, who ran a media watchdog, Media-Ratings. France 2 and Enderlin issued a writ two days later.

The case began in September 2006. Enderlin submitted as evidence a February 2004 letter from Jacques Chirac, then president of France, which spoke of Enderlin&#x27;s integrity. The court upheld the complaint on 19 October 2006, fining Karsenty €1,000 and ordering him to pay €3,000 in costs. He lodged an appeal that day.

===2007: &quot;Karsenty v. Enderlin-France 2&quot;===
The first appeal opened in September 2007 in the Court of Appeal of Paris, before a three-judge panel led by Judge Laurence Trébucq. The court asked France 2 to turn over the 27 minutes of raw footage Abu Rahma said he had shot, to be shown during a public hearing. France 2 produced 18 minutes; Enderlin said that only 18 minutes had been shot.
During the screening, the court heard that Muhammad had raised his hand to his forehead and moved his leg after Abu Rahma had said he was dead, and that there was no blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that Abu Rahma had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.

France 2&#x27;s lawyer, Francis Szpiner, counsel to former President of France Jacques Chirac, called Karsenty &quot;the Jew who pays a second Jew to pay a third Jew to fight to the last drop of Israeli blood,&quot; comparing him to 9/11 conspiracy theorist Thierry Meyssan and Holocaust denier Robert Faurisson. Karsenty had it in for Enderlin, Szpiner argued, because of Enderlin&#x27;s even-handed coverage of the Middle East.

The judges overturned the ruling against Karsenty in May 2008 in a 13-page decision. They ruled that he had exercised in good faith his right to criticize and had shown the court a &quot;coherent body of evidence.&quot; The court noted inconsistencies in Enderlin&#x27;s statements and said that Abu Rahma&#x27;s statements were not &quot;perfectly credible either in form or content.&quot; There were calls for a public inquiry from historian Élie Barnavi, a former Israeli ambassador to France, and Richard Prasquier, president of the &quot;Conseil Représentatif des Institutions juives de France&quot;. The left-leaning &quot;Le Nouvel Observateur&quot; began a petition in support of Enderlin that was signed by 300 French writers, accusing Karsenty of a seven-year smear campaign.

===2013: Defamation ruling===
France 2 appealed to the Court of Cassation (supreme court). In February 2012 it quashed the decision of the appeal court to overturn the conviction, ruling that the court should not have asked France 2 to provide the raw footage. The case was sent back to the appeal court, which convicted Karsenty of defamation in 2013 and fined him €7,000.

==Impact of the footage==

The footage of Muhammad was compared to other iconic images of children under attack: the boy in the Warsaw ghetto (1943), the Vietnamese girl doused with napalm (1972), and the firefighter carrying the dying baby in Oklahoma (1995). Catherine Nay, a French journalist, argued that Muhammad&#x27;s death &quot;cancels, erases that of the Jewish child, his hands in the air before the SS in the Warsaw Ghetto.&quot;

Palestinian children were distressed by the repeated broadcasting of the footage, according to a therapist in Gaza, and were re-enacting the scene in playgrounds. Arab countries issued postage stamps bearing the images. Parks and streets were named in Muhammad&#x27;s honour, and Osama bin Laden mentioned him in a &quot;warning&quot; to President George Bush after 9/11. The images were blamed for the 2000 Ramallah lynching and a rise in antisemitism in France. One image could be seen in the background when journalist Daniel Pearl, an American Jew, was beheaded by al-Qaeda in February 2002.

Sections of the Jewish and Israeli communities, including the Israeli government in 2013, described the statements that IDF soldiers had killed the boy as a &quot;blood libel&quot;, a reference to the centuries-old allegation that Jews sacrifice Christian children for their blood. Comparisons were made with the Dreyfus affair of 1894, when a French-Jewish army captain was found guilty of treason based on a forgery. In the view of Charles Enderlin, the controversy is a smear campaign intended to undermine footage coming out of the occupied Palestinian territories. Doreen Carvjal wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that the footage is &quot;a cultural prism, with viewers seeing what they want to see.&quot; The footage of al-Durrah&#x27;s death re-emerged in political discourse during the Israel–Hamas war after his siblings were killed by Israeli soldiers in Gaza.

<doc id="1091195" wikidata="Q7302108" url="?curid=1091195" title="Rebels (song)">
<text>&quot;Rebels&quot; is a song by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. It appeared on the 1985 album &quot;Southern Accents&quot; and was released as a single in the same year. Although it only reached #74 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 pop chart, it fared much better on the Billboard Album Rock Tracks chart, where it peaked at #5.

==&quot;Rebels&quot; and Petty&#x27;s broken hand==
The track was recorded in 1984. It was during the recording of this track that Petty broke his hand. Petty remembers being so high on drugs that he could not get an arrangement he liked. Petty went into the control room, and put the original demo tape on, which featured just him and a Rickenbacker 12-string guitar. He believed that they had yet to record an arrangement better than this demo, which made him so furious that he stormed up the stairs into his house, and punched the wall, causing severe damage to his left hand. After taking time off for his hand to heal, Petty called Jimmy Iovine in to help him finish &quot;Rebels&quot; along with some other tracks on &quot;Southern Accents&quot;. Alan &quot;Bugs&quot; Weidel, Tom&#x27;s roadie, considers &quot;Rebels&quot; a least favorite of his due to Petty&#x27;s broken hand.

==Reception==
&quot;Cash Box&quot; said that it&#x27;s &quot;another strong outing from Petty And The Heartbreakers&quot; and highlighted &quot;Petty’s urgent vocal and lyrics of alienation.&quot;

<text>Abu Ja&#x27;far Muḥammad ibn [[Al-Mutawakkil|Ja&#x27;far]] ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] ibn [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn]] al-Muntasir biʾLlāh (; November 837 – 7 June 862), better known by his regnal title al-Muntasir biʾLlāh (, &quot;He who triumphs in God&quot;) was the caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate from 861 to 862, during the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;. The power struggle between al-Muntasir and his brother, al-Mu&#x27;tazz, backed by different factions, climaxed with the Turkic leaders plotting the murder of his father al-Mutawakkil. Following the assassination in 861, al-Muntasir assumed the caliphate with Turkic support.

His reign, lasting only six months, saw a shift in policies, including a more favorable stance towards the House of ʻAlī and the lifting of the ban on pilgrimage to the tombs of Hassan and Hussayn. Al-Muntasir engaged in military actions against the Byzantines, led by his general Wasif al-Turki, but his sudden death in June 862 resulted in a change of leadership, and al-Musta&#x27;in succeeded him as caliph. The military campaign continued briefly, with Wasif achieving success before returning to Samarra due to the change in government.

==Early life==
Al-Muntasir was the eldest son of Abu al-Fadl Ja&#x27;far (future Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil). At the time of his birth, his father was fourteen years old. His given name was Muhammad. Al-Muntasir&#x27;s mother was Hubshiya, a Greek slave.

In 849, al-Mutawakkil arranged for his succession, by appointing three of his sons as heirs and assigning them the governance and proceeds of the Empire&#x27;s provinces: the eldest, al-Muntasir, was named first heir, and received the governorship of Egypt, the Jazira, and the proceeds of the rents in the capital, Samarra; al-Mu&#x27;tazz was charged with supervising the domains of the governor in the Khorasan; and al-Mu&#x27;ayyad was placed in charge of Syria.

Muhammad ibn Jarir al-Tabari records that in 236 AH (850–851) al-Muntasir led a pilgrimage. The previous year al-Mutawakkil had named his three sons as heirs and seemed to favor al-Muntasir. However, afterward, this seemed to change and al-Muntasir feared his father was going to move against him. So, he decided to strike first. Al-Mutawakkil was killed by a Turkish soldier on Wednesday 10 December 861.

===Involvement in the assassination of al-Mutawakkil===
Al-Mutawakkil had appointed his oldest son, al-Muntasir, as his heir in 849/50, but slowly had shifted his favor to his second son, al-Mu&#x27;tazz, encouraged by al-Fath ibn Khaqan and the vizier Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan. This rivalry extended into the political sphere, as al-Mu&#x27;tazz&#x27;s succession appears to have been backed by the traditional Abbasid elites as well, while al-Muntasir was backed by the Turkic and &quot;Maghariba&quot; guard troops. In late autumn 861, matters came to a head: in October, al-Mutawakkil ordered the estates of the Turkic general Wasif to be confiscated and handed over to al-Fath. Feeling backed into a corner, the Turkic leadership began a plot to assassinate the Caliph. They were soon joined, or at least had the tacit approval, of al-Muntasir, who smarted from a succession of humiliations: on 5 December, on the recommendation of al-Fath and Ubayd Allah, he was bypassed in favor of al-Mu&#x27;tazz for leading the Friday prayer at the end of Ramadan, while three days later, when al-Mutawakkil was feeling ill and chose al-Muntasir to represent him on the prayer, once again Ubayd Allah intervened and persuaded the Caliph to go in person. Even worse, according to the historian al-Tabari, on the next day, al-Mutawakkil alternately vilified and threatened to kill his eldest son, and even had al-Fath slap him on the face. With rumors circulating that Wasif and the other Turkish leaders would be rounded up and executed on 12 December, the conspirators decided to act.

According to al-Tabari, a story later circulated that al-Fath and Ubayd Allah were forewarned of the plot by a Turkic woman, but had disregarded it, confident that no one would dare carry it out. On the night of 10/11 December, about one hour after midnight, the Turks burst in the chamber where the caliph and al-Fath were having supper. Al-Fath was killed trying to protect the Caliph, who was killed next. Al-Muntasir, who now assumed the caliphate, initially claimed that al-Fath had murdered his father and that he had been killed after; within a short time, however, the official story changed to al-Mutawakkil choking on his drink.

==Reign==
On the same day as the assassination, al-Muntasir succeeded smoothly to the throne of the Caliphate with the support of the Turkic faction. The Turkic party then prevailed on al-Muntasir to remove his brothers from the succession, fearing they would seek revenge for his involvement in the murder of their father. In their place, he was to appoint his son as heir apparent. On 27 April 862, both brothers wrote statements of abdication, although al-Mu&#x27;tazz did so after some hesitation.

Al-Muntasir became caliph on December 11, 861, after his father al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by members of his Turkic guard. Although he was suspected of being involved in the plot to kill al-Mutawakkil, he was able to quickly take control of affairs in the capital city of Samarra and receive the oath of allegiance from the leading men of the state. Al-Muntasir&#x27;s sudden elevation to the Caliphate served to benefit several of his close associates, who gained senior positions in the government after his ascension. Included among these were his secretary, Ahmad ibn al-Khasib, who became vizier, and Wasif, a senior Turkic general who had likely been heavily involved in al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s murder.

Al-Muntasir was lauded because, unlike his father, he loved the house of ʻAlī (Shīʻa) and removed the ban on pilgrimage to the tombs of Hassan and Hussayn. He sent Wasif to raid the Byzantines.

===War with Byzantines===
Shortly after securing his position as caliph, al-Muntasir decided to send an Abbasid army against the Byzantines. According to al-Tabari, this decision was prompted by Ahmad ibn al-Khasib; the vizier had recently had a falling out with Wasif, and he sought to find an excuse to get him out of the capital. Ahmad ultimately decided that the best way to accomplish this was to put him at the head of a military campaign. He was eventually able to convince the caliph to go along with the plan, and al-Muntasir ordered Wasif to head to the Byzantine frontier.

Having completed their preparations for the campaign, Wasif and the army departed for the Byzantine frontier in early 862. Upon arriving at the Syrian side of the frontier zone, They set up camp there in preparation for their incursions into Byzantine territory.

Before Wasif had a chance to make any serious progress against the Byzantines, however, the campaign was overshadowed by events back at the capital. After a reign of only six months, al-Muntasir died around the beginning of June, of either illness or poison. Following his death, the vizier Ahmad ibn al-Khasib and a small group of senior Turkish commanders met and decided to appoint al-Musta&#x27;in as caliph in his stead. They presented their decision to the Samarran military regiments and were eventually able to force the soldiers to swear allegiance to their candidate.

The death of al-Muntasir did not immediately result in the termination of the military campaign. Wasif, upon learning of the passing of the caliph, decided that he should still persist with the operation, and led his forces into Byzantine territory. The army advanced against a Byzantine fortress called Faruriyyah in the region of Tarsus. The defenders of the fortress were defeated and the stronghold was conquered by the Muslims.

Ultimately, however, the change of government in Samarra brought the expedition to a premature conclusion. The ascension of al-Musta&#x27;in could not be ignored indefinitely by Wasif; having already missed the opportunity to play a role in the selection of the new caliph, he needed to make sure his interests back in the capital were protected. As a result, he decided to abandon the Byzantine front, and by 863 he was back in Samarra.

==Death==

Al-Muntasir&#x27;s reign lasted less than half a year; it ended with his death from unknown causes on Sunday, 7 June 862, at the age of 24 years (solar). There are various accounts of the illness that led to his death, including that he was bled with a poisoned lancet. Al-Tabari (p. 222-3) states that al-Muntasir is the first Abbasid whose tomb is known, that it was made public by his mother, a Greek slave girl, and that earlier caliphs desired their tombs to be kept secret for fear of desecration. Joel L. Kraemer in his translation of al-Tabari notes on page 223:

&quot;&#x27;Ayni comments, citing al-Sibt (b. al-Jawzi), that Tabari&#x27;s statement here is surprising since the tombs of the Abbasid caliphs are in fact known, e.g., the tomb of al-Saffah is in Anbar beneath the minbar; and those of al-Mahdi in Masabadhan, Harun in Tus, al-Ma&#x27;mun in Tarsis, and al-Mu&#x27;tasim, al-Wathiq and al-Mu&#x27;tawakkil in Samarra.&quot;

==Succession==
His father, caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861) had created a plan of succession that would allow his sons to inherit the caliphate after his death; he would be succeeded first by his eldest son, al-Muntasir, then by al-Mu&#x27;tazz and third by al-Mu&#x27;ayyad. During al-Muntasir&#x27;s short reign (r. 861–862), the Turks convinced him into removing al-Mu&#x27;tazz and al-Mu&#x27;ayyad from the succession. When al-Muntasir died, the Turkic officers gathered together and decided to install the dead caliph&#x27;s cousin Ahmad al-Musta&#x27;in on the throne.

<text>Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad ibn [[Muhammad ibn al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] al-Mustaʿīn bi-ʾllāh (; 836 – 17 October 866), better known by his regnal title al-Mustaʿīn (836 – 17 October 866) was the Abbasid caliph from 862 to 866, during the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;. After the death of previous Caliph, al-Muntasir (who had not appointed any successors), the Turkic military leaders held a council to select his successor. They were not willing to have al-Mu&#x27;tazz or his brothers; so they elected &quot;Ahmad ibn Muhammad&quot; (), a nephew of al-Mutawakkil, who took the regnal name al-Mustaʿīn bi-ʾllāh ( &quot;he who looks for help to God&quot;).

Arab and other troops based in Baghdad, displeased at the choice, attacked the assembly, broke open the prison, and plundered the armory. They were attacked by the Turkic and Berber soldiers, and after some fighting in which many died, succumbed.

==Birth and background==
Ahmad ibn Muhammad (future al-Musta&#x27;in) was the son of Abbasid prince Muhammad ibn al-Mu&#x27;tasim and his mother was a concubine from province of Sicily called Makhariq. Al-Musta&#x27;in was the grandson of caliph al-Mu&#x27;tasim (r. 833–842). He was the nephew of caliph al-Wathiq (r. 842–847) and caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861).

His uncle, caliph al-Mutawakkil (r. 847–861) had created a plan of succession that would allow his sons to inherit the caliphate after his death; he would be succeeded first by his eldest son, al-Muntasir, then by al-Mu&#x27;tazz and third by al-Mu&#x27;ayyad. In December 861 al-Mutawakkil was assassinated by a group of Turkic military officers, likely with the support of al-Muntasir. During al-Muntasir&#x27;s short reign (r. 861–862), the Turks pressured him into removing al-Mu&#x27;tazz and al-Mu&#x27;ayyad from the succession. When al-Muntasir died, the Turkic officers gathered together and decided to install the dead caliph&#x27;s cousin al-Musta&#x27;in on the throne.

==Reign==

The new caliph was almost immediately faced with a large riot in Samarra in support of the disenfranchised al-Mu&#x27;tazz; the rioters were put down by the military but casualties on both sides were heavy. Al-Musta&#x27;in, worried that al-Mu&#x27;tazz or al-Mua&#x27;yyad could press their claims to the caliphate, first attempted to buy them off and then threw them in prison.

The governor of Baghdad persuaded the city to submit, and the succession was thereafter acknowledged throughout the land. Al-Mu&#x27;tazz and his brother, threatened by the Turkic and Berber troops, resigned their titles to succeed, and were then, by way of protection, kept in confinement. After a second attempt to overturn the decision made by the Turks, al-Mu&#x27;tazz and his brother would have been put to death, but the vizier intervened and saved their lives, for which act of mercy, his property was seized by the Turkic soldiers, and himself banished to Crete. The Empire, in fact, both at home and abroad, had passed into the hands of Turks.

In 863, the Muslim campaign against the Christians was going badly. Two whole corps in Armenia and Asia Minor, some 8,000 strong, with their leaders, were killed during the Battle of Lalakaon. The tidings created anger and riots in Baghdad. The ancient cry for a Holy War rang through the streets. People blamed the Turks that had brought disaster on the faith, murdered their Caliphs, and set up others at their pleasure.

With such cries the city rose in uproar; the prisons were broken into and bridges burned. But Baghdad could no longer dictate to its rulers; it could only riot. The fighting spirit was, however, strong enough to draw men from the surrounding provinces, who flocked as free lances to fight against the infidel. But the Turks cared for none of these things, nor did the Caliph.

In 864, his forces put down a rebellion by the Alid Yahya ibn Umar and a revolt in Hims.

In 865, the end for al-Musta&#x27;in himself was now at hand. After some disagreements between the Turkish leaders that placed al-Musta&#x27;in in much danger, he, along with two other Turkic leaders, Bugha al-Sharabi (known as Bugha al-Saghir) and Wasif al-Turki, left Samarra on a boat to East Baghdad. The Turks sent after him a party of their captains, requesting him to return to Samarra. But the Caliph refused, and hard words followed between the two sides, in the heat of which one of the Turkic speakers received a blow.

The insult rankled the Turkic officers, and on returning to Samarra, the Turkic troops rose together, and bringing forth al-Mu&#x27;tazz from his confinement, saluted him as Caliph. Within a few weeks, his brother Abu Ahmad al-Muwaffaq, with 50,000 Turks and 2,000 Berbers, besieged Baghdad, a siege that would last throughout the year 865.

==Abdication in favor of al-Mu&#x27;tazz==
As the siege of Baghdad wore on, it began to have its intended effect. Food and money slowly became scarce, and discontent among the populace began to emerge. As early as August, a group of members of the Abbasid family complained to Muhammad ibn &#x27;Abdallah that their stipends were not being paid. As conditions in the city deteriorated, Muhammad gradually became convinced that victory through force of arms was impossible. By November at the latest, and without the knowledge or permission of al-Musta&#x27;in, he had opened negotiations with al-Mu&#x27;tazz regarding al-Musta&#x27;in&#x27;s surrender.

Muhammad and al-Mu&#x27;tazz had already started negotiating with each other when the former launched his failed sally. After the battle, al-Mu&#x27;tazz criticized Muhammad for acting in bad faith, and the Samarran army intensified the siege. Soon the city was running low on resources. Crowds began appearing before Muhammad&#x27;s palace, crying &quot;hunger!&quot; and demanding a resolution to their problems. Muhammad held off the crowds with promises, and at the same time sent an offer of peace to al-Mu&#x27;tazz. This was responded to favorably, and beginning on December 8 a representative from Abu Ahmad&#x27;s camp began meeting Muhammad in private to discuss how to end the conflict.

As the siege progressed into December, the population of Baghdad became more agitated. On December 16, some of the regular infantry and commoners gathered together, with the former demanding their pay and the latter complaining about how food prices had skyrocketed. Muhammad was able to convince them to temporarily disperse, but riots broke out in the city two days later and it was only with difficulty that they were quelled. Meanwhile, negotiations between Muhammad and Abu Ahmad continued; emissaries were sent by Muhammad to Abu Ahmad&#x27;s camp, and Samarran prisoners of war were released. Toward the end of December, a provisional agreement between the two sides to depose al-Musta&#x27;in was reached, and Abu Ahmad sent five ships loaded with foodstuffs and fodder to relieve the shortages in the city.

When the citizens of Baghdad learned that Muhammad had agreed to depose al-Musta&#x27;in, they angrily assembled outside his palace. Out of loyalty to al-Musta&#x27;in and fears that Muhammad&#x27;s surrender could result in the Samarrans plundering the city, they attacked the palace gates and fought against the guards. In order to calm the protestors, al-Musta&#x27;in appeared above the palace gate with Muhammad at his side, and he gave assurances to the crowd that he was still caliph and that he would lead the Friday prayers the next morning. The following day, December 28, he failed to appear; in response, the houses of Muhammad&#x27;s subordinates were looted and a large crowd again approached Muhammad&#x27;s palace, forcing al-Musta&#x27;in to make another public appearance. Shortly after this he moved out of Muhammad&#x27;s palace to another residence in the city, and on January 2, 866, he led the prayer for the Feast of Sacrifice.

Muhammad, for his part, strove to convince the people that he was still acting in al-Musta&#x27;in&#x27;s best interests, while at the same time continuing to negotiate with Abu Ahmad regarding the terms of surrender. On January 7, Muhammad and Abu Ahmad met in person under a canopy outside the Shammasiyah gate, and the two men agreed that the state revenues would be split among the parties, with two thirds going to the Turks and one third going to Muhammad and the Baghdadi army, and al-Musta&#x27;in should be held liable for part of the soldiers&#x27; pay. On the following day, Muhammad went to al-Musta&#x27;in and attempted to convince him to abdicate. At first al-Musta&#x27;in adamantly refused, but when the Turkish officers Wasif and Bugha stated that they had sided with Muhammad, he agreed to step down.

As part of the terms of al-Musta&#x27;in&#x27;s abdication, he was to be given an estate in the Hijaz, and allowed to travel between the cities of Mecca and Medina. On January 12, Muhammad brought a group of judges and jurists to witness that al-Musta&#x27;in had entrusted his affairs to him. Delegates carrying the terms of abdication were sent to Samarra, where al-Mu&#x27;tazz personally signed the document and agreed to the conditions. The delegates returned to Baghdad with the signed document on January 24, accompanied by a group of emissaries sent to secure al-Musta&#x27;in&#x27;s allegiance to al-Mu&#x27;tazz. On Friday, January 25, al-Mu&#x27;tazz was acknowledged as caliph in the mosques throughout Baghdad.

==Death==
By the beginning of 866, with plots and treachery all around, al-Musta&#x27;in was persuaded by alternating threats and promises to abdicate in favor of al-Mu&#x27;tazz. He was to live at Medina with a sufficient income. The conditions signed, the Governor of Baghdad received the ministers and courtiers of al-Musta&#x27;in, and, having assured them he had done what he had for the best and to stop further bloodshed, sent them to Samarra to pay homage to the new Caliph. Al-Mu&#x27;tazz ratified the terms and took possession of Baghdad in the early days of 252 AH (866 CE). He also sent to al-Musta&#x27;in his mother and family from Samarra, but not until they had been stripped of everything they possessed.

Instead of finding a refuge at Medina, al-Musta&#x27;in found himself kept in Baghdad. There he was put to death on 17 October 866 by the order of al-Mu&#x27;tazz. Carrying al-Musta&#x27;in&#x27;s head to the Caliph, &quot;Here,&quot; cried the executioner, &quot;behold thy cousin&#x27;s head!&quot; &quot;Lay it aside,&quot; answered al-Mu&#x27;tazz who was playing chess,—&quot;till I have finished the game.&quot; And then, having satisfied himself that it was really al-Musta&#x27;in&#x27;s head, he commanded 500 pieces to be given to the assassin as his reward.

<text>Abū ʿAbd Allāh Muḥammad ibn [[Al-Mutawakkil| Jaʿfar]] ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] ibn [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn]] al-Muʿtazz bi-ʾLlāh (; 847 – 16 July 869), better known by his regnal title al-Muʿtazz bi-ʾLlāh (, &quot;He who is strengthened by God&quot;) was the Abbasid caliph from 866 to 869, during a period of extreme internal instability within the Abbasid Caliphate, known as the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;.

Originally named as the second in line of three heirs of his father al-Mutawakkil, al-Mu&#x27;tazz was forced to renounce his rights after the accession of his brother al-Muntasir, and was thrown in prison as a dangerous rival during the reign of his cousin al-Musta&#x27;in. He was released and raised to the caliphate in January 866, during the civil war between al-Musta&#x27;in and the Turkish military of Samarra. Al-Mu&#x27;tazz was determined to reassert the authority of the caliph over the Turkish army but had only limited success. Aided by the vizier Ahmad ibn Isra&#x27;il, he managed to remove and kill the leading Turkish generals, Wasif al-Turki and Bugha al-Saghir, but the decline of the Tahirids in Baghdad deprived him of their role as a counterweight to the Turks. Faced with the assertive Turkish commander Salih ibn Wasif, and unable to find money to satisfy the demands of his troops, he was deposed and died of ill-treatment a few days later, on 16 July 869.

His reign marks the apogee of the decline of the Caliphate&#x27;s central authority, and the climax of centrifugal tendencies, expressed through the emergence of the autonomous dynasties of the Tulunids in Egypt and the Saffarids in the East, Alid uprisings in Hejaz and Tabaristan, and the first stirrings of the great Zanj Rebellion in lower Iraq.

==Early life==

The future al-Mu&#x27;tazz was born to the Caliph al-Mutawakkil () from his favourite slave concubine, Qabiha. In 849, al-Mutawakkil arranged for his succession, by appointing three of his sons as heirs and assigning them the governance and proceeds of the empire&#x27;s provinces: the eldest, al-Muntasir, was named first heir, and received Egypt, the Jazira, and the proceeds of the rents in the capital, Samarra; al-Mu&#x27;tazz was charged with supervising the domains of the Tahirid governor in the East; and al-Mu&#x27;ayyad was placed in charge of Syria. However, over time the favour of al-Mutawakkil shifted towards al-Mu&#x27;tazz. Encouraged by his favorite advisor, al-Fath ibn Khaqan, and the vizier Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan, the Caliph began contemplating naming al-Mu&#x27;tazz as his first heir, and excluding al-Muntasir from the succession. The rivalry between the two princes reflected tensions in the political sphere, as al-Mu&#x27;tazz&#x27;s succession appears to have been backed by the traditional Abbasid elites as well, while al-Muntasir was backed by the Turkish and &quot;Maghariba&quot; guard troops.

In October 861, the Turkish commanders began a plot to assassinate the Caliph. They were soon joined, or at least tacitly supported, by al-Muntasir, whose relations with his father deteriorated rapidly. On 5 December, al-Muntasir was bypassed in favor of al-Mu&#x27;tazz for leading the Friday prayer at the end of Ramadan, at the end of which his father&#x27;s advisor al-Fath and the vizier Ubayd Allah demonstratively kissed his hands and feet, before accompanying him on the return to the palace; and on 9 December al-Mutawakkil, among other humiliations inflicted on him, threatened to kill his eldest son. As a result, on the night of 10/11 December, the Turks killed al-Mutawakkil and al-Fath, and al-Muntasir became caliph. Almost immediately, al-Muntasir sent for his brothers to come and give the oath of allegiance (&quot;bay&#x27;ah&quot;) to him. Thus, when the vizier Ubayd Allah, upon being informed of al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s death, went to the house of al-Mu&#x27;tazz, he did not find him there; and when his supporters, including the &quot;abna al-dawla&quot; and others and numbering several thousand, gathered in the morning and urged him to storm the palace, he refused, with the words &quot;our man is in their hands&quot;. The murder of al-Mutawakkil began the tumultuous period known as &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;, which lasted until 870 and brought the Abbasid Caliphate to the brink of collapse.

Pressured by the Turkish commanders Wasif al-Turki and Bugha al-Saghir, both al-Mu&#x27;tazz and al-Mu&#x27;ayyad renounced their places in the succession on 27 April 862. However, al-Muntasir died in June 862, without having named any new heir. The Turks now strengthened their hold over the government and selected a cousin of al-Muntasir, al-Musta&#x27;in (), as the new caliph. The new caliph was almost immediately faced with a large riot in Samarra in support of al-Mu&#x27;tazz; the rioters included not only the &quot;market rabble&quot; but also mercenaries from the &quot;Shakiriyya&quot; troops. The riot was down by the &quot;Maghariba&quot; and &quot;Ushrusaniyya&quot; regiments, but casualties on both sides were heavy. Al-Musta&#x27;in, worried that al-Mu&#x27;tazz or al-Mua&#x27;yyad could press their claims to the caliphate, first attempted to buy them off by offering them an annual subsidy of 80,000 gold dinars. Shortly after, however, their properties were confiscated—according to al-Tabari, that of al-Mu&#x27;tazz was valued at ten million &quot;dirhams&quot;—and imprisoned under the auspices of Bugha al-Saghir in one of the rooms of the Jawsaq Palace.

==Caliphate==

Rivalries between the Turkish leaders led to a split in 865, when al-Musta&#x27;in, Wasif, and Bugha left Samarra for Baghdad, where they arrived on 5/6 February 865. There they were joined by many of their followers, and allied with the city&#x27;s Tahirid governor, Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir, who began fortifying the city. The bulk of the Turks, however, remained in Samarra. Their position was threatened by this coalition, so they released al-Mu&#x27;tazz and proclaimed him caliph. On 24 February, al-Mu&#x27;tazz placed his brother Abu Ahmad (the future al-Muwaffaq) in charge of the army, and sent him to lay siege to Baghdad. Abu Ahmad played a leading role in the siege, which created a close and lasting relationship with the Turkish military, that would later allow him to emerge as the virtual regent of the caliphate alongside his brother al-Mu&#x27;tamid ().

The siege dragged on until December 865, when a combination of privations, lack of money to pay its supporters, and the price hikes caused by the siege eroded support for al-Musta&#x27;in&#x27;s regime. As a result, Muhammad ibn Tahir opened negotiations with the besiegers, and a settlement was reached, which amounted to a mutual compromise over the sharing of the empire&#x27;s proceeds: the Turks and other troops of Samarra received two-thirds of annual state revenue, while the remainder would go to Ibn Tahir and his Baghdad forces. As part of the agreement, al-Musta&#x27;in would abdicate, in exchange for an annual pension of 30,000 dinars. Thus on 25 January 866, after the surrender of Baghdad, al-Mu&#x27;tazz became officially the sole, legitimate caliph.

Although he was placed on the throne by the Turks, al-Mu&#x27;tazz proved a capable ruler and was determined to restore the authority and independence of his office. He appointed as his vizier Ahmad ibn Isra&#x27;il, who had formerly served as his secretary during al-Mutawakkil&#x27;s reign. Al-Mu&#x27;tazz moved quickly to sideline any potential rivals. Thus, despite his pledge of safety to al-Musta&#x27;in, in October/November 866 al-Mu&#x27;tazz had his predecessor assassinated at al-Katul in Samarra. In the same way he had his younger brother al-Mu&#x27;ayyad executed, even after forcing him to again renounce his rights to succession. Finally, Abu Ahmad, although initially welcomed with much honor by the Caliph for his role in winning the civil war, was also imprisoned along with al-Mu&#x27;ayyad. However, his support from the military saved his life. He was eventually released and sent to Basra before being allowed to settle in Baghdad. The Caliph then targeted the powerful Turkish commanders Wasif al-Turki and Bugha al-Saghir. The first move against them in late 866 failed due to the opposition of the army, and the two men were restored to their posts. In the next year, however, Wasif was killed by Turkish troops that had mutinied demanding the payment of their arrears, while Bugha was imprisoned and executed on the Caliph&#x27;s orders in 868. Another powerful Turkish commander, Musa ibn Bugha al-Kabir, was effectively exiled to Hamadan at the same time.

Despite these successes, the Caliph could not overcome the main problem of the period: a shortage of revenue with which to pay the troops. The financial straits of the Caliphate had become evident already at his accession—the customary accession donative of ten months&#x27; pay for the troops had to be reduced to two for lack of funds—and had helped bring down the regime of al-Musta&#x27;in in Baghdad. The civil war and the ensuing general anarchy only worsened the situation, as revenue stopped coming in even from the environs of Baghdad, let alone more remote provinces. As a result, al-Mu&#x27;tazz refused to honor his agreement with Ibn Tahir in Baghdad, leaving him to provide for his own supporters; this led to unrest in the city and the rapid decline of Tahirid authority. The turmoil in Baghdad was worsened by al-Mu&#x27;tazz, who in 869 dismissed Ibn Tahir&#x27;s brother and successor Ubaydallah, and replaced him with his far less capable brother Sulayman. In the event, this only served to deprive the Caliph of a useful counterweight against the Samarra soldiery and allowed the Turks to regain their former power.

As a result, by 869 the Turkish leaders Salih ibn Wasif (the son of Wasif al-Turki) and Ba&#x27;ikbak were again in the ascendant and secured the removal of Ahmad ibn Isra&#x27;il. Finally, unable to meet the financial demands of the Turkish troops, in mid-July a palace coup deposed al-Mu&#x27;tazz. He was imprisoned and maltreated to such an extent that he died after three days, on 16 July 869. He was succeeded by his cousin al-Muhtadi.

==Legacy==
Despite his efforts to strengthen his position and restore control over the military, al-Mutazz&#x27;s reign is marked by instability and insecurity, and by his ultimate failure to subdue the military. This weakness in the center fed the centrifugal tendencies already evident in the Caliphate&#x27;s provinces. In Egypt, the talented Turkish commander Ahmad ibn Tulun was appointed governor in 868 and proceeded to establish the autonomous Tulunid dynasty. Although it fell to the Abbasids in 905, the Tulunid regime had established Egypt as a distinct political entity for the first time since the Pharaohs. Restored Abbasid rule proved volatile; another local dynasty, the Ikhshidids, took power in 935, followed by the country&#x27;s conquest by the Abbasids&#x27; rivals, the Fatimid Caliphate, in 969. In the east, Alid uprisings weakened Tahirid rule, and led to the establishment of a Zaydi state in Tabaristan, under Hasan ibn Zayd. At the same time, Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth al-Saffar began his assault on the waning Tahirids, which would lead him to control over the eastern provinces of the Caliphate, and even an unsuccessful attempt to seize the caliphal throne itself in 876. Closer to home, Kharijite revolts shook the Jazira to the north, and in the south, around Basra, the first stirrings of the great Zanj Rebellion began.

<text>Daniel Amos is the self-titled debut album by Christian rock band Daniel Amos. The album was issued in 1976 by Maranatha! Music and was produced by Al Perkins. It is typical of the country rock sound the band performed in the mid-1970s before their switch to alternative rock in the early 1980s.

== Background ==

Heavily influenced by the Band, Steely Dan and the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Sweetheart of the Rodeo&quot;, Daniel Amos&#x27; debut full-length album temporarily leaves behind the rock roots of the band members earlier bands although many of the songs came from those days. Baxter&#x27;s &quot;The Bible&quot; and &quot;Love in a Yielded Heart&quot; (then known as &quot;Freedom&quot;) were both performed in the early days of Jubal&#x27;s Last Band, the band that was formed in late 1972 and eventually evolved into Daniel Amos. Taylor&#x27;s &quot;William&quot;, &quot;Dusty Road,&quot; and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Fight It&quot; date back to 1971 and his early band Good Shephard, and &quot;Skeptic&#x27;s Song&quot; (then known as &quot;Resurrection&quot;) dates back at least to 1972 and his band, Judge Rainbow and the Prophetic Trumpets.

The band&#x27;s recording contract with Maranatha! resulted from Jubal&#x27;s Last Band&#x27;s audition for the label sometime in mid-1975. Another band at the meeting, led by Darrell Mansfield, had a similar name - Jubal. The two bands decided to change their names to avoid confusion. Mansfield renamed his band Gentle Faith, and Jubal&#x27;s Last Band became Daniel Amos. Not long after, D.A. recorded its first song for Maranatha!, Taylor&#x27;s &quot;&#x27;Aint Gonna Fight It.&quot; That track was released on the Various Artists album, &quot;Maranatha! 5&quot; towards the end of that same year. That December, D.A. entered Mama Jo&#x27;s Studio and began work on their first album. The album was released in early 1976.

== Reissue ==
In 2004, work began on a special 30th Anniversary Deluxe two-disc version of the album. The collection, released on June 26, 2006, includes the full newly remastered album, never before seen photos, bonus material, interviews and more. The second disc traced the band&#x27;s evolution from various bands in the early 1970s to the formation of Daniel Amos in 1975. Also included for those who pre-ordered the collection was third disc of bonus material similar to the second. This edition was repackaged and re-released in 2011 on Born Twice Records with expanded artwork and a larger booklet.

<text>Abū Isḥāq Muḥammad ibn [[al-Wathiq|Hārūn]] ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] ibn [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn]] al-Muhtadī bi-ʾLlāh (‎; – 21 June 870), better known by his regnal name al-Muhtadī bi-ʾLlāh (Arabic: , &quot;Guided by God&quot;), was the Caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate from July 869 to June 870, during the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;.

==Early life==

Al-Muhtadi was the son of Abbasid caliph al-Wathiq. He was born in 833. Al-Muhtadi&#x27;s mother was Qurb, a Roman slave. After the death of his father, Caliph al-Wathiq () in August 847, there were some officials who wanted to elect the young al-Muhtadi as caliph, but in the end, their choice fell on his uncle, al-Mutawakkil ().

===Background===
Despite the successes of caliph al-Mu&#x27;tazz, He could not overcome the main problem of the period: a shortage of revenue with which to pay the troops. The financial straits of the Caliphate had become evident already at his accession—the customary accession donative of ten months&#x27; pay for the troops had to be reduced to two for lack of funds—and had helped bring down the regime of al-Musta&#x27;in in Baghdad. The civil war and the ensuing general anarchy only worsened the situation, as revenue stopped coming in even from the environs of Baghdad, let alone more remote provinces. As a result, al-Mu&#x27;tazz refused to honour his agreement with Ibn Tahir in Baghdad, leaving him to provide for his own supporters; this led to unrest in the city and the rapid decline of Tahirid family. The turmoil in Baghdad was worsened by al-Mu&#x27;tazz, who in 869 dismissed Ibn Tahir&#x27;s brother and successor Ubaydallah, and replaced him with his far less capable brother Sulayman. In the event, this only served to deprive the Caliph of a useful counterweight against the Samarra soldiery, and allowed the Turks to regain their former power.

===Accession===
By 869 the Turkic leaders Salih ibn Wasif and Ba&#x27;ikbak were again in the ascendant, and secured the removal of Ahmad ibn Isra&#x27;il. Finally, unable to meet the financial demands of the Turkic troops, in mid-July a palace coup deposed al-Mu&#x27;tazz. He was imprisoned and maltreated to such an extent that he died after three days, on 16 July 869. He was succeeded by his cousin al-Muhtadi.

==Caliphate==
After the deposition and murder of his cousin al-Mu&#x27;tazz () on 15 July 869, the leaders of the Turkic guard chose al-Muhtadi as the new Caliph on 21/22 July. As a ruler, al-Muhtadi sought to emulate the Umayyad caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, widely considered a model Islamic ruler. He therefore lived an austere and pious life—notably removing all musical instruments from the court—and made a point of presiding in person over the courts of grievances (&quot;mazalim&quot;), thus gaining the support of the common people. Combining &quot;strength and ability&quot;, he was determined to restore the Caliph&#x27;s authority and power, that had been eroded during the ongoing &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot; by the squabbles of the Turkish generals.

Al-Muhtadi faced Alid risings in the provinces, but the main threat to his power were the Turkish commanders. The dominant figure of the first months of his rule was Salih ibn Wasif, but he too failed to provide enough revenue to pay the troops. Although he executed the previous vizier, Ahmad ibn Isra&#x27;il, and his extortion of the secretaries (&quot;kuttab&quot;), his power continued to wane. His main rival, Musa ibn Bugha, used the opportunity to return from his semi-exile in Hamadhan, arriving in Samarra in December 869. There he constrained al-Muhtadi to take an oath to punish Salih for having robbed the treasures of Kabiha, the mother of al-Mu&#x27;tazz. Salih went into hiding, whereupon the Turks mutinied and almost deposed al-Muhtadi. They relented only when he promised them to pardon Salih, but when Salih did not appear, his soldiers began to pillage Samarra, until Musa and his troops scattered them. Soon after, Salih was discovered and executed by Musa&#x27;s men. Musa thus established himself as the leading official of the government, with Sulayman ibn Wahb as his chief secretary. Historian Khatib states that he adopted perpetual fasting from the day of his leadership until his murder.

==Downfall and death==
When Musa left to campaign against the Kharijites, al-Muhtadi took the opportunity to incite the people against him and his brother, Muhammad. Muhammad was brought to trial on accusations of embezzlement and was condemned. Although al-Muhtadi had promised a pardon, Muhammad was executed. This cemented the rift with Musa: the latter marched on the capital with his army, and defeated the troops loyal to the Caliph. He refused to abdicate, but tried to preserve his life and office by recourse to the religious status of the caliph, and the support of the people. He was nevertheless murdered on 21 June 870, and replaced by his cousin, al-Mu&#x27;tamid ().

Ja&#x27;far ibn Abd al-Wahid ibn Ja&#x27;far led the prayers at the funeral of the caliph al-Muhtadi.

<text>Abu’l-ʿAbbās Aḥmad ibn [[Al-Mutawakkil|Jaʿfar]] ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] ibn [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn]] al-Muʿtamid ʿalā’Llāh (; – 14 October 892), better known by his regnal name al-Muʿtamid ʿalā &#x27;llāh (, &#x27;Dependent on God&#x27;), was the caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate from 870 to 892. His reign marks the end of the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot; and the start of the Abbasid restoration, but he was largely a ruler in name only. Power was held by his brother al-Muwaffaq, who held the loyalty of the military. Al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s authority was circumscribed further after a failed attempt to flee to the domains controlled by Ahmad ibn Tulun in late 882, and he was placed under house arrest by his brother. In 891, when al-Muwaffaq died, loyalists attempted to restore power to the Caliph, but were quickly overcome by al-Muwaffaq&#x27;s son al-Mu&#x27;tadid, who assumed his father&#x27;s powers. When al-Mu&#x27;tamid died in 892, al-Mu&#x27;tadid succeeded him as caliph.

==Life==

The future al-Mu&#x27;tamid was a son of Caliph al-Mutawakkil () and a Kufan slave girl called Fityan. His full name was Ahmad ibn Abi Jaʿfar, and was also known by the patronymic Abu&#x27;l-Abbas and from his mother as Ibn Fityan. After al-Muhtadi was deposed by the Turkish commanders Bayakbak and Yarjukh, he was selected by the military as his successor and proclaimed Caliph with the regnal name &quot;al-Muʿtamid ʿAlā &#x27;llāh&quot; on 16 or 19 June 870. On 21 June, al-Muhtadi was executed.

===Reign and relationship with al-Muwaffaq===

The accession of al-Mu&#x27;tamid brought an end to the turmoils of the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;, which had begun with the murder of al-Mutawakkil in 861. Caliphal authority in the provinces collapsed during that period, with the result that the central government lost effective control over most of the Caliphate outside the metropolitan region of Iraq. In the west, Egypt had fallen under the control of the ambitious Turkish soldier Ahmad ibn Tulun, who also had designs on Syria, while Khurasan and most of the Islamic East had been taken over by the Saffarids under Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth, who replaced the Abbasid&#x27;s loyal governor, Muhammad ibn Tahir. Most of the Arabian peninsula was likewise lost to local potentates, while in Tabaristan a radical Zaydi Shi&#x27;a dynasty took power. Even in Iraq, a rebellion of the Zanj slaves had begun and soon threatened Baghdad itself, while further south the Qarmatians were a nascent threat. In addition, al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s position was undermined from within, as during the coups of the previous years real power had come to lie with the elite Turkish troops, and with al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s brother Abu Ahmad Talha, who, as the Caliphate&#x27;s main military commander, served as the chief intermediary between the caliphal government and the Turks. When Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tazz died in 869, there was even popular agitation in Baghdad in favour of his elevation to Caliph.

In contrast to his brother, al-Mu&#x27;tamid appears to have lacked any experience of, and involvement in, politics, as well as a power base he could rely on. At the time al-Muhtadi was killed by the Turks, Abu Ahmad was at Mecca. Immediately he hastened north to Samarra, where he and Musa ibn Bugha effectively sidelined al-Mu&#x27;tamid, and assumed control of the government. Al-Mu&#x27;tamid was thus quickly reduced to a figurehead ruler, which remained the case for the remainder of his reign. Within a short time, Abu Ahmad was conferred an extensive governorate covering most of the lands still under caliphal authority: western Arabia, southern Iraq with Baghdad, and Fars. To denote his authority, he assumed an honorific name in the style of the caliphs, &quot;al-Muwaffaq bi-Allah&quot;. As one of the few vestiges of actual power, al-Mu&#x27;tamid retained the right to appoint his own viziers, originally choosing the experienced Ubayd Allah ibn Yahya ibn Khaqan, who had already served al-Mutawakkil. During his caliphate, the Caliph retained some freedom of action, but after his death in 877, he was replaced by al-Muwaffaq&#x27;s secretary, Sulayman ibn Wahb. Ibn Wahb was soon disgraced and replaced as vizier by Isma&#x27;il ibn Bulbul. Real power however lay again with al-Muwaffaq&#x27;s new secretary, Sa&#x27;id ibn Makhlad, until his own disgrace and downfall in 885, after which Ibn Bulbul became the sole vizier to both al-Mu&#x27;tamid and al-Muwaffaq.

On 20 July 875, al-Mu&#x27;tamid formally arranged for the governance of the state and his succession: his underage son Ja&#x27;far was given the honorific name &quot;al-Mufawwad ila-llah&quot;, was named heir-apparent and assigned the western half of the Caliphate—Ifriqiya, Egypt, Syria, the Jazira and Mosul, Armenia, Mihrajanqadhaq and Hulwan— while al-Muwaffaq received the eastern provinces and was named second heir, except for the event that the Caliph died while al-Mufawwad was still a minor. In practice, al-Mufawwad never exercised any real authority, and al-Muwaffaq continued to exercise control over the western provinces as well through his trusted lieutenant Musa ibn Bugha, who was named al-Mufawwad&#x27;s deputy. Al-Muwaffaq&#x27;s power was strengthened by the military threats the Caliphate faced on all fronts, since he commanded the loyalty of the army. In April 876, al-Muwaffaq and Musa ibn Bugha defeated Ya&#x27;qub ibn al-Layth&#x27;s attempt to capture Baghdad at the Battle of Dayr al-&#x27;Aqul and saved the Caliphate from collapse. The repulse of the Saffarids then allowed the Abbasids to concentrate their resources in suppressing the Zanj Revolt in the south. The Zanj rebels had managed to capture much of lower Iraq, and inflicted several defeats on the Abbasid troops. In 879, al-Muwaffaq&#x27;s son Abu&#x27;l-Abbas, the future Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tadid (), was given the command against the Zanj, and in the next year, al-Muwaffaq himself joined the campaign. In a succession of engagements in the marshes of southern Iraq, the Abbasid forces drove back the Zanj towards their capital, Mukhtara, which fell in August 883.

===Ibn Tulun and al-Mu&#x27;tamid&#x27;s attempted flight to Egypt===

At the same time, al-Muwaffaq also had to contend with the ambitions of Ahmad ibn Tulun in the western provinces. Ibn Tulun and the Abbasid regent fell out in 875/6, on the occasion of a large remittance of revenue from Egypt to the central government. Counting on the rivalry between the Caliph and his over-mighty brother to maintain his own position, Ibn Tulun forwarded a larger share of the taxes to al-Mu&#x27;tamid instead of al-Muwaffaq: 2.2 million gold dinars went to the Caliph and only 1.2 million dinars to his brother. Al-Muwaffaq, who in his fight against the Zanj considered himself entitled to the major share of the provincial revenues, was angered by this, and by the implied machinations between Ibn Tulun and his brother. Al-Muwaffaq nominated Musa ibn Bugha as governor of Egypt and sent him with troops to Syria, but a lack of funds led to the expedition&#x27;s failure before even reaching Egypt. In a public gesture of support for al-Mu&#x27;tamid and opposition to al-Muwaffaq, Ibn Tulun assumed the title of &quot;Servant of the Commander of the Faithful&quot; (&quot;mawlā amīr al-muʾminīn&quot;) in 878. With the support of al-Mu&#x27;tamid, in 877/8 Ibn Tulun managed to be assigned responsibility for the entirety of Syria and the Cilician frontier zone (Thughur) with the Byzantine Empire.

In 881, Ibn Tulun added his own name to coins issued by the mints under his control, along with those of the Caliph and heir apparent, al-Mufawwad. In the autumn of 882, the Tulunid general Lu&#x27;lu&#x27; defected to the Abbasids, and the cities of the Thughur rejected Tulunid rule, forcing Ibn Tulun to go once again in person to Syria. Al-Mu&#x27;tamid used the moment to escape from his confinement in Samarra, and with a small entourage made for Tulunid domains. Messengers from the Caliph reached Ibn Tulun at Damascus, and the ruler of Egypt halted and awaited the Caliph&#x27;s arrival with great anticipation: not only would the sole source of political legitimacy in the Muslim world reside under his control, but he would also be able to pose as the &quot;rescuer&quot; of the Caliph from his overreaching brother. In the event, however, Sa&#x27;id ibn Makhlad managed to alert the governor of Mosul, Ishaq ibn Kundaj, who overtook and defeated al-Mu&#x27;tamid and his escort at al-Haditha on the Euphrates. Al-Mu&#x27;tamid was brought back to Samarra (February 883), where he was placed under virtual house arrest in the Jawsak Palace. In May/June, he was even moved south to Wasit, where al-Muwaffaq could keep an eye on him in person. Only in March 884 was the powerless Caliph allowed to return to Samarra. In the meantime, he was obliged to denounce Ibn Tulun, and appoint—nominally at least—Ishaq ibn Kundaj as governor of Syria and Egypt.

In 886/7, the Caliph conferred the title of &quot;king&quot; on the long-time ruler of Armenia, Ashot I (). Although the Armenian king continued to pay tribute to the Abbasid court and recognize its suzerainty, both he and the various minor Armenian princes were &quot;de facto&quot; independent monarchs.

===Rise of al-Mu&#x27;tadid and death===

In 889, al-Muwaffaq fell out with his son, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas, for reasons that are unclear, and had him imprisoned. Al-Muwaffaq spent the next two years on campaign in the Jibal in what is now western Iran. By the time he returned to Baghdad in May 891, al-Muwaffaq was already nearing death. The garrison commander of Baghdad, and the vizier Isma&#x27;il ibn Bulbul, hatched a plot to keep Abu&#x27;l-Abbas imprisoned and allow power to pass to al-Mu&#x27;tamid. Therefore, they invited the Caliph and his son to come to the city, which they did. In the event, however, the attempt to sideline Abu&#x27;l-Abbas failed, due to his popularity with the soldiers and the common people: the soldiers set him free, and when al-Muwaffaq died on 2 June, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas immediately assumed his father&#x27;s position. Abu&#x27;l-Abbas assumed the title of &quot;al-Mu&#x27;tadid bi-llah&quot; and took his father&#x27;s position in the line of succession after the Caliph and al-Mufawwad. The powerless al-Mufawwad was pushed aside on 30 April 892, and when al-Mu&#x27;tamid died on 14 October 892, &quot;apparently as a result of a surfeit of drink and food&quot; (Hugh N. Kennedy), al-Mu&#x27;tadid took power as caliph.

Also, Hassan al-Askari, the eleventh Imam of Twelver shiites was killed on orders of al-Mu&#x27;tamid.

<text>Abū al-ʿAbbās Aḥmad ibn [[Al-Muwaffaq|Ṭalḥa]] ibn [[Al-Mutawakkil|Jaʿfar]] ibn [[al-Mu&#x27;tasim|Muḥammad]] ibn [[Harun al-Rashid|Hārūn]] (), 853/4 or 860/1 – 5 April 902, better known by his regnal name al-Muʿtaḍid bi-llāh (), was the caliph of the Abbasid Caliphate from 892 until his death in 902.

Al-Mu&#x27;tadid was the son of al-Muwaffaq, who was the regent and effective ruler of the Abbasid state during the reign of his brother, Caliph al-Mu&#x27;tamid. As a prince, the future al-Mu&#x27;tadid served under his father during various military campaigns, most notably in the suppression of the Zanj Rebellion, in which he played a major role. When al-Muwaffaq died in June 891 al-Mu&#x27;tadid succeeded him as regent. He quickly sidelined his cousin and heir-apparent al-Mufawwid; when al-Mu&#x27;tamid died in October 892, he succeeded to the throne. Like his father, al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s power depended on his close relations with the army. These were first forged during the campaigns against the Zanj and were reinforced in later expeditions which the Caliph led in person: al-Mu&#x27;tadid would prove to be the most militarily active of all Abbasid caliphs. Through his energy and ability, he succeeded in restoring to the Abbasid state some of the power and provinces it had lost during the turmoil of the previous decades.

In a series of campaigns he recovered the provinces of Jazira, Thughur, and Jibal, and effected a rapprochement with the Saffarids in the east and the Tulunids in the west that secured their—albeit largely nominal—recognition of caliphal suzerainty. These successes came at the cost of gearing the economy almost exclusively towards the maintenance of the army, which resulted in the expansion and rise to power of the central fiscal bureaucracy and contributed to the Caliph&#x27;s lasting reputation for avarice. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid was renowned for his cruelty when punishing criminals, and subsequent chroniclers recorded his extensive and ingenious use of torture. His reign saw the permanent move of the capital back to Baghdad, where he engaged in major building activities. A firm supporter of Sunni traditionalist orthodoxy, he nevertheless maintained good relations with the Alids, and was interested in natural sciences, renewing caliphal sponsorship of scholars and scientists.

Despite his successes, al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s reign was ultimately too short to effect a lasting reversal of the Caliphate&#x27;s fortunes, and the revival that he spearheaded was too dependent on the presence of capable personalities at the helm of the state. The brief reign of his less able son and heir, al-Muktafi, still saw some major gains, notably the annexation of the Tulunid domains, but his later successors lacked his energy, and new enemies appeared in the form of the Qarmatians. In addition, factionalism within the bureaucracy, which had become apparent during the later years of al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s reign, would debilitate the Abbasid government for decades to come, eventually leading to the subjugation of the Caliphate by a series of military strongmen, culminating in the conquest of Baghdad by the Buyids in 946.

== Early life ==

Al-Mu&#x27;tadid was born Ahmad, the son of Talha, one of the sons of the Abbasid caliph al-Mutawakkil (), and a Greek slave named Dirar (died September 891, buried in al-Rusafa) The exact date of his birth is unknown; as he is variously recorded as being thirty-eight or thirty-one years old at the time of his accession, he was born around either 854 or 861. In 861, al-Mutawakkil was murdered by his Turkish guards in collusion with his oldest son al-Muntasir (). This began a period of internal turmoil, known as the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot; from the site of the Caliphate&#x27;s capital, which ended in 870 with the rise to the throne of Ahmad&#x27;s uncle, al-Mu&#x27;tamid (). Real power however, had come to lie with the elite Turkish slave-soldiers () and with Ahmad&#x27;s own father, Talha, who, as the Caliphate&#x27;s main military commander, served as the chief intermediary between the caliphal government and the Turks. Assuming the honorific name al-Muwaffaq in the style of the caliphs, Talha soon became the effective ruler of the Caliphate, a position consolidated in 882 after a failed attempt by al-Mu&#x27;tamid to flee to Egypt led to his confinement in house arrest.

Caliphal authority in the provinces collapsed during the &quot;Anarchy at Samarra&quot;, with the result that by the 870s the central government had lost effective control over most of the Caliphate outside the metropolitan region of Iraq. In the west, Egypt had fallen under the control of the Turkish slave-soldier Ahmad ibn Tulun, who also disputed control of Syria with al-Muwaffaq, while Khurasan and most of the Islamic East had been taken over by the Saffarids, a Persianate dynasty who replaced the Abbasids&#x27; loyal clients, the Tahirids. Most of the Arabian peninsula was likewise lost to local potentates, while in Tabaristan a radical Zaydi Shi&#x27;a dynasty took power. Even in Iraq, the rebellion of the Zanj, African slaves brought to work in the plantations of Lower Iraq, threatened Baghdad itself, and further south the Qarmatians were a nascent threat. Al-Muwaffaq&#x27;s regency was thus a continuous struggle to save the tottering Caliphate from collapse. His attempts to recover control of Egypt and Syria from Ibn Tulun failed, with the latter even able to expand his territory and obtain recognition as a hereditary ruler, but he succeeded in preserving the core of the Caliphate in Iraq by repelling a Saffarid invasion aimed at capturing Baghdad, and by subduing the Zanj after a long struggle.

=== Campaigns against the Zanj and the Tulunids ===

It was against the Zanj that the future al-Mu&#x27;tadid—at this time usually referred to by his of Abu&#x27;l-Abbas—would acquire his first military experience and establish the close army ties that would characterize his reign. Al-Muwaffaq gave his son a military upbringing from an early age, and the young prince became an excellent rider and a solicitous commander, who showed personal attention to the state of his men and their horses.

Within a decade of the outbreak of the revolt in 869, the Zanj had seized most of lower Iraq, including the cities of Basra and Wasit, and expanded into Khuzistan. In 879 the death of the founder of the Saffarid state, Ya&#x27;qub al-Saffar, allowed the Abbasid government to fully concentrate its attention against the Zanj rebellion, and Abu&#x27;l-Abbas&#x27; appointment to command in December 879 at the head of 10,000 troops marks the turning point of the war. In the long and hard struggle that followed, which involved amphibious operations in the Mesopotamian Marshes, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas and his own —of which the long-serving Zirak al-Turki was the most eminent—played the major role. Although the Abbasid armies eventually swelled with reinforcements, volunteers, and Zanj defectors, it was the few but elite who formed the army&#x27;s backbone, filling its leadership positions and bearing the brunt of the battle, often under the personal command of Abu&#x27;l-Abbas. After years of gradually tightening the noose around the Zanj, in August 883 the Abbasid troops stormed their capital of al-Mukhtara, putting an end to the rebellion. A detailed account of the war by a former Zanj rebel, preserved in the history written by al-Tabari, stresses the role of al-Muwaffaq and Abu&#x27;l-Abbas as the heroes who, in defence of the embattled Muslim state, suppressed the rebellion; the successful campaign would become a major tool in their propaganda effort to legitimize their &quot;de facto&quot; usurpation of the caliph&#x27;s power.

Following the death of Ibn Tulun in May 884, the two caliphal generals Ishaq ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abu&#x27;l-Saj sought to take advantage of the situation and attacked the Tulunid domains in Syria, but their initial gains were rapidly reversed. In the spring of 885, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas was sent to take charge of the invasion. He soon succeeded in defeating the Tulunids and forcing them to retreat to Palestine, but after a quarrel with Ibn Kundaj and Ibn Abu&#x27;l-Saj, the latter two abandoned the campaign and withdrew their forces. In the Battle of Tawahin on 6 April, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas confronted Ibn Tulun&#x27;s son and heir, Khumarawayh, in person. The Abbasid prince was initially victorious, forcing Khumarawayh to flee, but was in turn defeated and fled the battlefield, while much of his army was taken prisoner. After this victory the Tulunids expanded their control over the Jazira and the borderlands (the Thughur) with the Byzantine Empire. A peace agreement followed in 886, whereby al-Muwaffaq was forced to recognize Khumarawayh as hereditary governor over Egypt and Syria for 30 years, in exchange for an annual tribute. Over the next couple of years, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas was involved in his father&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful attempts to wrest Fars from Saffarid control.

=== Imprisonment and rise to the throne ===
During this period, relations between Abu&#x27;l-Abbas and his father deteriorated, although the reason is unclear. Already in 884, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas&#x27; rioted in Baghdad against al-Muwaffaq&#x27;s vizier, Sa&#x27;id ibn Makhlad, possibly over unpaid wages. Eventually, in 889, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas was arrested and put in prison on his father&#x27;s orders, where he remained despite the demonstrations of the loyal to him. He apparently remained under arrest until May 891, when al-Muwaffaq returned to Baghdad after two years spent in Jibal.

Al-Muwaffaq, suffering from gout, was clearly close to death; the vizier Isma&#x27;il ibn Bulbul and the city commander of Baghdad, Abu&#x27;l-Saqr, called al-Mu&#x27;tamid and his sons, including the heir-apparent al-Mufawwad, into the city, hoping to exploit the situation for their own purposes. This attempt to sideline Abu&#x27;l-Abbas failed due to his popularity with the soldiers and the common people. He was set free to visit his father&#x27;s deathbed, and was able to immediately assume power when al-Muwaffaq died on 2 June. The Baghdad mob ransacked his opponents&#x27; houses, and Ibn Bulbul was dismissed and thrown in prison, where he died from maltreatment after a few months. Similar fates awaited any of Ibn Bulbul&#x27;s supporters who were caught by Abu&#x27;l-Abbas&#x27;s agents.

Now &quot;all-powerful&quot;, Abu&#x27;l-Abbas succeeded his father in all his offices, with the title of and a position in the line of succession after the Caliph and al-Mufawwad. Within a few months, on 30 April 892, al-Mu&#x27;tadid had his cousin removed from the succession altogether. Thus, when al-Mu&#x27;tamid died on 14 October 892, al-Mu&#x27;tadid took power as caliph.

== Reign ==

The Orientalist Harold Bowen described al-Mu&#x27;tadid at his accession as follows: Like his father&#x27;s, al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s power rested on his close relations with the military. As the historian Hugh N. Kennedy writes, he &quot;came to the throne, essentially, as a usurper [...] not by any legal right, but because of the support of his , who ensured not only that he became caliph, but also that their rivals in the military were humiliated and disbanded&quot;. Thus, not surprisingly, military activities consumed his interest, especially as he usually led his army in person on campaign. This secured his reputation as a warrior-caliph and champion of the Islamic faith ); as the historian Michael Bonner comments, &quot;[t]he role of &#x27;ghazī caliph&#x27;, invented by Harun al-Rashid and enhanced by al-Mu&#x27;tasim, now had its greatest performance, in al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s tireless campaigning&quot;.

From the start of his reign, the new Caliph set out to reverse the fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate, a goal towards which he worked with a mixture of force and diplomacy. Although an active and enthusiastic campaigner, al-Mu&#x27;tadid was also &quot;a skilful diplomat, always prepared to make compromises with those who were too powerful to defeat&quot;, according to Kennedy.

=== Relations with the Tulunids ===
This policy became immediately evident in the conciliatory attitude the new Caliph adopted towards his most powerful vassal, the Tulunid regime. In spring 893, al-Mu&#x27;tadid recognized and reconfirmed Khumarawayh in his office as autonomous emir over Egypt and Syria, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 dinars and a further 200,000 dinars in arrears, as well as the return to caliphal control of the two Jaziran provinces of Diyar Rabi&#x27;a and Diyar Mudar. To seal the pact, Khumarawayh offered his daughter, Qatr al-Nada (&quot;Dew Drop&quot;) as bride to one of the Caliph&#x27;s sons, but al-Mu&#x27;tadid chose to marry her himself. The Tulunid princess brought with her a million dinars as her dowry, a &quot;wedding gift that was considered the most sumptuous in medieval Arab history&quot; (Thierry Bianquis). Her arrival in Baghdad was marked by the luxury and extravagance of her retinue, which contrasted starkly with the impoverished caliphal court. According to a story, after a thorough search, al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s chief eunuch could find only five ornate silver-and-gold candlesticks to decorate the palace, while the princess was accompanied by 150 servants each carrying such a candlestick. Thereupon al-Mu&#x27;tadid is said to have remarked &quot;come let us go and hide ourselves, lest we be seen in our poverty&quot;.

On the other hand, the whole affair may have been deliberately plotted by al-Mu&#x27;tadid as a &quot;financial trap&quot;, as the enormous dowry almost bankrupted the Tulunid treasury. Apart from the honour of being linked to the caliphal dynasty, the Tulunids received little in return: Qatr al-Nada died soon after the wedding, and the murder of Khumarawayh in 896 left the Tulunid state in the unsteady hands of Khumarawayh&#x27;s under-age sons. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid swiftly took advantage of this and in 897 extended his control over the border emirates of the Thughur, where, in the words of Michael Bonner, &quot;[he] assumed, after a long hiatus, the old caliphal prerogative of commanding the annual summer expedition and arranging the defence against the Byzantine Empire&quot;. In addition, to secure caliphal recognition of his position, the new Tulunid ruler Harun ibn Khumarawayh () was forced into further concessions, handing back all of Syria north of Homs, and increasing the annual tribute to 450,000 dinars. Over the next few years, increasing domestic turmoil in the remaining Tulunid domains, and the escalation of Qarmatian attacks, encouraged many Tulunid followers to defect to the resurgent Caliphate.

=== Jazira, Transcaucasia, and the Byzantine front ===

In the Jazira the new Caliph struggled against a variety of opponents: alongside an almost thirty-year-old Kharijite rebellion, there were various autonomous local magnates, chiefly the Shaybani ruler of Amid and Diyar Bakr, Ahmad ibn Isa al-Shaybani, and the Taghlibi chief Hamdan ibn Hamdun. In 893, while the Kharijites were distracted by internal quarrels, al-Mu&#x27;tadid captured Mosul from the Shayban. In 895 Hamdan ibn Hamdun was evicted from his strongholds, hunted down and captured. Finally, the Kharijite leader Harun ibn Abdallah himself was defeated and captured by Hamdan&#x27;s son Husayn in 896, before being sent to Baghdad, where he was crucified. This exploit marked the beginning of an illustrious career for Husayn ibn Hamdan in the caliphal armies, and the gradual rise of the Hamdanid family to power in the Jazira. Ahmad al-Shaybani retained Amid until his death in 898, being succeeded by his son Muhammad. In the next year, al-Mu&#x27;tadid returned to the Jazira, ousted Muhammad from Amid, and reunified the entire province under central government control by installing his oldest son and heir, Ali al-Muktafi, as governor.

Al-Mu&#x27;tadid was unable, however, to restore effective caliphal control north of the Jazira in Transcaucasia, where Armenia and Adharbayjan remained in the hands of virtually independent local dynasties. Ibn Abu&#x27;l-Saj, who was now the caliphal governor of Adharbayjan, proclaimed himself independent around 898, although he soon re-recognized the Caliph&#x27;s suzerainty during his conflicts with the Christian Armenian princes. When he died in 901, he was succeeded by his son Devdad, marking the consolidation of the semi-independent Sajid dynasty in the region. In 900, Ibn Abu&#x27;l-Saj was even suspected of plotting to seize Diyar Mudar province with the co-operation of the notables of Tarsus, after which the vengeful Caliph ordered the latter arrested and the city&#x27;s fleet burned. This decision was a self-inflicted handicap in the centuries-long war against Byzantium; in recent decades the Tarsians and their fleet had played a major role in the raids against the Byzantine frontier provinces. While a Syrian fleet under the Byzantine convert to Islam Damian of Tarsus sacked the port of Demetrias around 900, and Arab fleets would go on to wreak havoc in the Aegean Sea over the next two decades, the Byzantines were strengthened on land by an influx of Armenian refugees, such as Melias. The Byzantines began to expand their control over the border regions, scoring victories and founding new provinces (themes) in the former no-man&#x27;s land between the two empires.

=== The East and the Saffarids ===
In the Islamic East, the Caliph was forced to acknowledge the reality of the Saffarids&#x27; domination and established a &quot;modus vivendi&quot; with them, perhaps hoping, according to Kennedy, to harness them in a partnership analogous to that which the Tahirids had enjoyed in previous decades. Consequently, the Saffarid ruler Amr ibn al-Layth was recognized in his possession of Khurasan and eastern Persia as well as Fars, while the Abbasids were to exercise direct control over western Persia, namely Jibal, Rayy and Isfahan. This policy gave the Caliph a free hand to recover the territories of the Dulafids, another semi-independent local dynasty, that were centred on Isfahan and Nihavand. When the Dulafid Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz ibn Abi Dulaf died in 893, al-Mu&#x27;tadid moved swiftly to install his son al-Muktafi as governor in Rayy, Qazvin, Qum and Hamadan. The Dulafids were confined to their core region around Karaj and Isfahan, before being deposed outright in 896. Nevertheless, the Abbasid hold over these territories remained precarious, especially due to the proximity of the Zaydi emirate in Tabaristan, and in 897 Rayy was handed over to Saffarid control.

The Abbasid–Saffarid partnership in Iran was most clearly expressed in their joint effort against the general Rafi ibn Harthama, who had made his base in Rayy and posed a threat to both caliphal and Saffarid interests in the region. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid sent Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz to seize Rayy from Rafi, who fled and made common cause with the Zaydis of Tabaristan in an effort to seize Khurasan from the Saffarids. However, with Amr mobilizing the anti-Alid sentiments of the populace against him and the expected assistance from the Zaydis failing to materialize, Rafi was defeated and killed in Khwarazm in 896. Amr, now at the pinnacle of his power, sent the defeated rebel&#x27;s head to Baghdad, and in 897 the Caliph transferred control of Rayy to him. The partnership finally collapsed after al-Mu&#x27;tadid appointed Amr as governor of Transoxiana in 898, which was ruled by his rivals, the Samanids. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid deliberately encouraged Amr to confront the Samanids, only for Amr to be crushingly defeated and taken prisoner by them in 900. The Samanid ruler, Isma&#x27;il ibn Ahmad, sent him in chains to Baghdad, where he was executed in 902, after al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s death. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid in turn conferred Amr&#x27;s titles and governorships on Isma&#x27;il ibn Ahmad. The Caliph also moved to regain Fars and Kirman, but the Saffarid remnant under Amr&#x27;s grandson Tahir proved sufficiently resilient to thwart the Abbasid attempts to capture these provinces for several years. It was not until 910 that the Abbasids managed to regain the coveted Fars province.

=== Rise of sectarianism and fragmentation in the periphery ===
In the course of the 9th century, a range of new movements emerged, based on Shi&#x27;ite doctrines, which replaced Kharijism as the main focus for opposition to the established regimes. They gained their first successes in the periphery of the Abbasid empire: the Zaydi takeover in Tabaristan was repeated in 897 in Yemen. Under al-Mu&#x27;tadid, a new danger appeared closer to the Caliphate&#x27;s metropolitan areas: the Qarmatians. A radical Isma&#x27;ili sect founded in Kufa around 874, the Qarmatians were originally a sporadic and minor nuisance in the Sawad (Lower Iraq), but their power grew swiftly to alarming proportions after 897. Under the leadership of Abu Sa&#x27;id al-Jannabi, they seized Bahrayn in 899 and in the next year defeated a caliphal army under al-Abbas ibn Amr al-Ghanawi. In the years following al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s death, the Qarmatians &quot;were to prove the most dangerous enemies the Abbasids had faced since the time of the Zanj&quot; (Kennedy). At the same time, a Kufan Isma&#x27;ili missionary, Abu Abdallah al-Shi&#x27;i, made contact with the Kutama Berbers during a pilgrimage to Mecca. His proselytization efforts made rapid headway among them, and in 902, he began attacks on the Aghlabid emirate of Ifriqiya, clients of the Abbasids. Its conquest was completed in 909, laying the foundations of the Fatimid Caliphate.

=== Domestic government ===
==== Fiscal policies ====

The Abbasid army, following the reforms of al-Mu&#x27;tasim, was a smaller and more professional fighting force than the caliphal armies of the past. Although it proved effective militarily, it also posed a potential danger to the stability of the Abbasid regime: drawn from Turks and other peoples from the Caliphate&#x27;s periphery and the lands beyond, it was alienated from the society of the Caliphate&#x27;s heartlands, with the result that the soldiers were &quot;entirely reliant on the state not just for cash but for their very survival&quot; (Kennedy). As a result, any failure by the central government to provide their pay resulted in a military uprising and a political crisis; this had been repeatedly demonstrated during the Anarchy at Samarra. Consequently, ensuring the regular payment of the army became the prime task of the state. According to Kennedy, based on a treasury document from the time of al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s accession: 

At the same time, the Caliphate&#x27;s fiscal basis had shrunk dramatically after so many tax-paying provinces were lost from the central government&#x27;s control. The caliphal government was now increasingly reliant on the revenue of the Sawad and the other areas of lower Iraq, which were witnessing a rapid decline in agricultural productivity due to the disruption of the civil wars and neglect of the irrigation network. In the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809) the Sawad had provided an annual revenue of 102,500,000 dirhams, more than double the revenue of Egypt and three times that of Syria; by the early 10th century it was providing less than a third of that figure. The situation was further exacerbated by the fact that in the remaining provinces, semi-autonomous governors, grandees and members of the dynasty were able to establish virtual latifundia, aided by the system of , a form of tax farming in exchange for a fixed tribute, which they often failed to pay. To maximize their revenue from the territory remaining to them, the Abbasids increased the breadth and complexity of the central bureaucracy, dividing the provinces into smaller tax districts as well as increasing the number of the fiscal departments (s), which allowed for close oversight of both revenue collection and the activities of the officials themselves.

To combat this fiscal crisis, the Caliph would often personally devote himself to the supervision of revenue, acquiring a reputation, according to F. Malti-Douglas, for &quot;a spirit of economy, verging on avarice&quot;; he was said to &quot;examine petty accounts that a commoner would scorn to consider&quot; (Harold Bowen). Fines and confiscations multiplied under his rule, with the resulting revenue, along with the income from the crown domain and even a portion of the provincial taxation, flowing to the caliphal privy purse (). The latter now acquired a leading role among the fiscal departments, and it frequently held more money than the public treasury (). By the end of al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s reign, the once empty privy purse would contain ten million dinars. On the other hand, in a measure aimed to ease the tax burden of the farmers, in 895 the Caliph changed the start of the tax year from the Persian New Year in March to 11 June—which became known as , &#x27;al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s New Year&#x27;—so the land tax () was now collected after the harvest and reflected the actual yields, instead of the usually unreliable estimates before.

==== Rise of the bureaucracy ====
During the 9th century, the Abbasid administrative system became increasingly professionalized. The provincial administration became a subject of careful study, with geographical works such as those of Ibn Khordadbeh providing details on the Caliphate&#x27;s provinces and their road networks, while men like Ibn Qutayba developed the art of chancery writing into a highly elaborate system. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s fiscal policies further strengthened the position of the civil bureaucracy, which now reached the apogee of its influence, and especially that of the vizier, whom even the army came to respect as the spokesman of the caliph. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid also introduced Tuesday and Friday as days of rest for government employees.

In terms of personnel, al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s reign was marked by continuity among the senior leadership of the state. Ubayd Allah ibn Sulayman ibn Wahb remained vizier from the start of the reign until his death in 901, and was succeeded by his son, al-Qasim, who had from the start been deputizing for his father during the latter&#x27;s absences from the capital. The freedman Badr, a veteran who had served under al-Muwaffaq and whose daughter married the Caliph&#x27;s son, remained commander of the army. The fiscal departments, especially of the Sawad, were managed first by the Banu&#x27;l-Furat brothers Ahmad and Ali, and after 899 by the Banu&#x27;l-Jarrah under Muhammad ibn Dawud and his nephew, Ali ibn Isa. The original administrative team was so effective and harmonious, according to the 11th-century historian Hilal as-Sabi, that it was said by subsequent generations that &quot;there had never been such a quartet, Caliph, Vizier, Commander, and chief of the s, as al-Mu&#x27;tadid, Ubayd Allah, Badr and Ahmad ibn al-Furat&quot;.

On the other hand, as Michel Bonner points out, the later reign of al-Mu&#x27;tadid &quot;saw a growth of factionalism within this bureaucracy, observable also in the army and in urban civilian life&quot;. The intense rivalry between the two bureaucratic dynasties of the Banu&#x27;l-Furat and the Banu&#x27;l-Jarrah, with their extensive networks of clients, began at this time. Although a strong caliph and vizier could restrain this antagonism, it would come to dominate the Abbasid government during the following decades, with the factions alternating in office and often fining and torturing their predecessors to extract money according to the well-established practice known as . In addition, al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah was of an altogether different character than his father: soon after his appointment to the vizierate, al-Qasim plotted to have al-Mu&#x27;tadid assassinated, and tried to involve Badr in his scheming. The general rejected his proposals with indignation, but al-Qasim was saved from discovery and execution by the Caliph&#x27;s sudden death. The Vizier then tried to dominate al-Muktafi, moved swiftly to have Badr denounced and executed, and was involved in yet more intrigues against the Banu&#x27;l-Furat.

==== Return of the capital to Baghdad ====
Al-Mu&#x27;tadid also completed the return of the capital from Samarra to Baghdad, which had already served as his father&#x27;s main base of operations. The city&#x27;s centre, however, was relocated on the eastern bank of the Tigris and further downstream from the original Round City founded by al-Mansur () a century earlier; it has remained there up to modern times. As the 10th-century historian al-Mas&#x27;udi wrote, the Caliph&#x27;s two main passions were &quot;women and building&quot; (&quot;&quot;), and accordingly he engaged in major building activities in the capital: he restored and expanded the Great Mosque of al-Mansur which had fallen into disuse; enlarged the Hasani Palace; built the new palaces of Thurayya (&#x27;Pleiades&#x27;) and Firdus (&#x27;Paradise&#x27;); and began work on the Taj (&#x27;Crown&#x27;) Palace, which was completed under al-Muktafi. This marked the creation of a sprawling new caliphal palace complex, the Dar al-Khilafa, which would remain the residence of the Abbasid caliphs until the Mongol sack of the city in 1258. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid also took care to restore the city&#x27;s irrigation network by clearing the silted-up Dujayl Canal, paying for this with money from those landowners who stood to profit from it.

==== Theological doctrines and promotion of science ====
In terms of doctrine, al-Mu&#x27;tadid sided firmly with Sunni traditionalist orthodoxy from the outset of his reign, forbidding theological works and abolishing the fiscal department responsible for property in escheat, which Hanbali legal opinion regarded as illegal. At the same time he also tried to maintain good relations with the Alids, to the point of seriously considering ordering the official cursing of Mu&#x27;awiya, the founder of the Umayyad Caliphate and main opponent of Ali; he was dissuaded only at the last moment by his advisers, who feared any unforeseen consequences such an act might have. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid also maintained good relations with the breakaway Zaydi imams of Tabaristan, but his pro-Alid stance failed to prevent the establishment of a second Zaydi state in Yemen in 901.

Al-Mu&#x27;tadid also actively promoted the traditions of learning and science that had flourished under his early 9th-century predecessors al-Ma&#x27;mun (), al-Mu&#x27;tasim, and al-Wathiq (). Court patronage for scientific endeavours had declined under al-Mutawakkil, whose reign had marked a return to Sunni orthodoxy and an aversion to scientific inquiry, while his successors had lacked the luxury to engage in intellectual pursuits. Himself &quot;keenly interested in natural sciences&quot; and able to speak Greek, al-Mu&#x27;tadid promoted the career of one of the great translators of Greek texts and mathematicians of the era, Thabit ibn Qurra, and of the grammarians Ibn Durayd and al-Zajjaj, the latter of whom became tutor of the Caliph&#x27;s children. Other notable figures associated with, and supported by, the Abbasid court at the time were the religious scholar Ibn Abi al-Dunya, who served as the Caliph&#x27;s advisor and was appointed as tutor for al-Muktafi; the translator Ishaq ibn Hunayn; the physician Abu Bakr al-Razi (Rhazes), who was named director of the newly established al-Mu&#x27;tadidi hospital in Baghdad; and the mathematician and astronomer al-Battani.

One of the leading intellectual figures of the period was al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s own tutor, Ahmad ibn al-Tayyib al-Sarakhsi, a pupil of the great philosopher al-Kindi. Al-Sarakhsi became a close companion of the Caliph, who appointed him to the lucrative post of market supervisor of Baghdad, but was executed in 896, after angering the Caliph. According to one account, al-Qasim ibn Ubayd Allah—who is frequently featured as the villain in anecdotes of al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s court—inserted al-Sarakhsi&#x27;s name in a list of rebels to be executed; the Caliph signed the list, and learned of his mistake only after his old master had been executed.

==== Justice and punishment under al-Mu&#x27;tadid ====
In the dispensation of justice, al-Mu&#x27;tadid was characterized by what Malti-Douglas describes as &quot;severity bordering on sadism&quot;. While tolerant of error and not above displays of sentimentality and tenderness, when his wrath was aroused he resorted to torture in the most ingenious ways, and had special torture chambers constructed underneath his palace. Chroniclers such as al-Mas&#x27;udi and the Mamluk-era historian al-Safadi describe in great detail the tortures inflicted by the Caliph on prisoners, as well as his practice of making an example of them by having them publicly displayed in Baghdad. Thus the Caliph is reported to have used bellows to inflate his prisoners, or buried them upside down in pits. At the same time, chroniclers justify his severity as legitimate, being in the interests of the state. Malti-Douglas remarks that when al-Safadi compared al-Mu&#x27;tadid with the founder of the Abbasid state, calling him &quot;al-Saffah the Second&quot;, this was not only to emphasize his restoration of the Caliphate&#x27;s fortunes, but also a direct allusion to the meaning of al-Saffah&#x27;s name, &quot;the Blood-Shedder&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Al-Mu&#x27;tadid died at the Hasani Palace on 5 April 902, at the age of either 40 or 47. There were rumours he had been poisoned, but it is more likely that the rigours of his campaigns, coupled with his dissolute life, severely weakened his health. During his final illness, he refused to follow the advice of his physicians, and even kicked one of them to death. He left behind him four sons and several daughters. Of his sons, three—al-Muktafi, al-Muqtadir, and al-Qahir—would rule as caliphs in turn and only one, Harun, did not become caliph. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid was the first Abbasid caliph to be buried within the city of Baghdad. Like his sons after him, he was buried in the former Tahirid Palace in the western part of the city, which was now used by the caliphs as a secondary residence.
According to the Orientalist Karl Vilhelm Zetterstéen, al-Mu&#x27;tadid &quot;had inherited his father&#x27;s gifts as a ruler and was distinguished alike for his economy and his military ability&quot;, becoming &quot;one of the greatest of the Abbasids in spite of his strictness and cruelty&quot;. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s capable reign is credited with having arrested the Abbasid Caliphate&#x27;s decline for a while, but his successes were too dependent on the presence of an energetic ruler at the helm, and ultimately his reign &quot;was too short to reverse long-term trends and re-establish Abbasid power on a long-term basis&quot; (Kennedy).

Al-Mu&#x27;tadid had taken care to prepare his son and successor, al-Muktafi, for his role by appointing him as governor in Rayy and the Jazira. Although al-Muktafi tried to follow his father&#x27;s policies, he lacked his energy. The heavily militarized system of al-Muwaffaq and al-Mu&#x27;tadid required the Caliph to actively participate in campaigns, setting a personal example and forming ties of loyalty, reinforced by patronage, between the ruler and the soldiers. Al-Muktafi, on the other hand, did not &quot;in his character and comportment [...], being a sedentary figure, instil much loyalty, let alone inspiration, in the soldiers&quot; (Michael Bonner). The Caliphate was still able to secure major successes over the next few years, including the reincorporation of the Tulunid domains in 904 and victories over the Qarmatians, but with al-Muktafi&#x27;s death in 908, the so-called &quot;Abbasid restoration&quot; passed its high-water mark, and a new period of crisis began.

Power was now wielded by the senior bureaucrats, who installed the weak and pliable al-Muqtadir on the throne. Over the next decades, the expenditure of both the court and the army increased, while maladministration increased and strife between military and bureaucratic factions intensified. By 932, when al-Muqtadir was assassinated, the Caliphate was effectively bankrupt, and authority soon devolved on a series of military strongmen who competed for control of the caliph and the title of . This process culminated in the capture of Baghdad in 946 by the Buyids, who put an end to caliphal independence even in name. Thereafter the caliphs remained as symbolic figureheads, but were divested of any military or political authority or independent financial resources.

==Family==
Al-Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s only wife was Qatr al-Nada. His sons were the offspring of concubines, such as Jijak, a Turkish-born slave who was the mother of al-Muktafi, the Greek-born Shaghab—who had previously belonged to a daughter of Muhammad ibn Abdallah ibn Tahir, the Tahirid governor of Baghdad in 851–867—and was the mother of Caliph al-Muqtadir, Fitna, mother of Caliph al-Qahir, and Dastanbuwayh, who was probably the mother of Mu&#x27;tadid&#x27;s son, Harun, who died in 967. Al-Mu&#x27;tadid also had a daughter named Maymuna, who died in 921.

<text>CSL Limited is an Australian multinational specialty biotechnology company that researches, develops, manufactures, and markets products to treat and prevent serious human medical conditions. CSL&#x27;s product areas include blood plasma derivatives, vaccines, antivenom, and cell culture reagents used in various medical and genetic research and manufacturing applications. The company was established in 1916 as Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and was wholly owned by the Australian federal government until its privatisation in 1994.

== History ==
=== Origin and Penfold directorship ===
CSL was founded in 1916 as Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, an Australian government body focused on vaccine manufacture. Under the first director, William Penfold, CSL commenced operation in the vacant Walter and Eliza Hall Institute building at the Royal Melbourne Hospital in 1918 before moving to its purpose-built Parkville premises in the following year.

=== Morgan directorship ===
After ongoing disputes with the Department of Health and its director-general John Cumpston, Penfold resigned in 1927 and was replaced by Frederic Morgan. Soon after Morgan&#x27;s appointment, CSL was drawn into a serious public health disaster when a batch of its diphtheria toxin-antitoxin was implicated in the deaths of twelve children in what became known as the Bundaberg tragedy of 1928. Although CSL&#x27;s manufacturing processes were absolved, its labelling procedures were seen to be in error, leading to an enduring focus on the highest standards across the facility&#x27;s production.

=== Antivenene research and production ===
In 1928, CSL also became involved in (antivenom) manufacture in conjunction with the snake venom research undertaken by Charles Kellaway at the Hall Institute. This led to the successful clinical testing of antivenene against tiger snake &quot;Notechis scutatus&quot; bite in 1930 and its commercial release in 1931.

In 1934, the research on snake venoms was transferred from the Hall Institute to CSL under the direction of former snake showman and herpetologist Tom &quot;Pambo&quot; Eades. This represented the initiation of research at the laboratories – an outcome its directors had been seeking for over a decade. The relationship with the Hall Institute continued until World War II, particularly via joint projects on viral diseases including polio and influenza coordinated by Frank Macfarlane Burnet and Esmond &quot;Bill&quot; Keogh. Keogh played an important role in the establishment of penicillin production at CSL in 1944 – a critical wartime achievement.

=== Plasma fractionation and Wiener directorship ===
In 1952, operation commenced plasma fractionation. Thereafter the range of antivenoms increased, including those against other snake species such as death adder (&quot;Acanthophis antarcticus&quot;) and the taipan (&quot;Oxyuranus scutellatus&quot;), plus spiders including the redback (&quot;Latrodectus hasselti&quot;) and – after much difficulty – the Sydney funnel-web (&quot;Atrax robustus&quot;). Much of this work, including the introduction in 1962 of a polyvalent antivenom against all of the major terrestrial Australian snakes, occurred under the direction of Saul Wiener, while from 1966 until the mid-1990s, venom research was coordinated by the eccentric but dedicated Struan Sutherland, who in 1979 released new guidelines for snakebite first aid, and a new test for snakebites that would identify which snake had envenomated the victim.

Other major achievements of CSL include:
* early production of insulin for treatment of Australian diabetics (1923)
* development of a tetanus vaccine (1938)
* development of a combined vaccine for diphtheria, tetanus and whooping cough (1953)
* rapid adoption and production of a polio vaccine (1956)
* development of a multi-purpose animal vaccine covering pulpy kidney (enterotoxemia), tetanus, black disease, malignant oedema and blackleg (1961)
* production of Rhesus (D) immunoglobulin to prevent haemolytic disease in newborns due to Rh factor incompatibility (1966–67)
* pioneering heat treatment to protect blood and plasma products from infection with HIV (1983)
* collaboration on development of the world&#x27;s first human papillomavirus vaccine, Gardasil, building on the pioneering work by Professor Ian Frazer (1994–2005).

=== Privatisation ===
In 1994, the Commonwealth facility was privatised by the Keating government as CSL Ltd. and was publicly listed and traded on the Australian Securities Exchange. The company completed an initial public offering in June 1994 at A$2.30 per share (76.7c adjusted for split). CSL stock is part of the S&amp;P/ASX 20 Index.

=== Acquisition of ZLB Bioplasma AG and Aventis Behring ===
In 2000, CSL doubled its size through the purchase of a Swiss plasma company, the Bern-based ZLB Bioplasma AG. In 2004, during a period of plasma oversupply, the company expanded again with the purchase of the German medical company Aventis Behring. The company was the second Australian public company to have reached a share price of over $100 per share.

=== Acquisition and merging of Novartis ===
In October 2014, Novartis announced its intention to sell its influenza vaccine business, including its development pipeline, to CSL for $275 million. CSL merged it into its BioCSL operation.

In November 2015, BioCSL rebranded the combined business with Novartis Influenza Vaccines as &quot;Seqirus&quot; [Sek-eer-us], creating the world&#x27;s second-largest influenza vaccine company.

In August 2017, the business announced it would acquire Calimmune and its stem cell therapy platform.

Completed in 2018, Seqirus&#x27;s Holly Spring, NC, the plant was funded with $59 million from the U.S. government.

in June 2020, CSL announced it would exercise its right to acquire Vitaeris.

In December 2021, the business announced it would acquire Swiss drugmaker, Vifor Pharma AG, for $11.7 billion.

In August 2022, CSL rebranded all of its divisions to start with the CSL name. Therefore, the divisions became CSL Behring, CSL Plasma, CSL Seqirus, and CSL Vifor.

== Vaccines ==
=== A/H1N1 2009 pandemic ===

CSL&#x27;s vaccine for swine flu, the world&#x27;s first, was approved in September 2009 for use by people over age 10. The federal government ordered 21million doses of vaccine for Australians. CSL also provided vaccines for customers in Singapore and the US.

On 28 September 2010, the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) conducted an analysis of febrile convulsions following immunisation in children following monovalent pandemic H1N1 vaccine (Panvax/Panvax Junior, CSL).

A paper published in the Medical Journal of Australia provides a possible reason for CSL&#x27;s 2010 flu vaccine causing febrile convulsions in children. The authors hypothesise that suboptimal use of the detergent called deoxycholate – used in the manufacturing process by CSL (one of the few vaccine manufacturers that use it) – to split the flu virus from its membrane may be at fault.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===

On 7 September 2020, CSL signed agreements with the Australian government to supply the University of Queensland vaccine (V451) and to manufacture (with AstraZeneca) the Oxford University vaccine (AZD1222), which would yield nearly 85 million doses for Australians. The agreement was contingent on the future success of clinical trials of these vaccines. Most of the manufacture would occur in Melbourne, Australia.

On 11 December 2020, after a high percentage of the University of Queensland vaccine trial participants returned &quot;false positive&quot; results for HIV, it was decided that vaccine development will not proceed to Phase 2/3 trials.

On 23 March 2021, the Therapeutic Goods Administration provisionally approved the first batches, numbering 832,000 doses, of the Oxford–AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine manufactured by CSL in its plant in Broadmeadows, Victoria. The Australian Government has contracted CSL to produce 50 million doses of the vaccine.

<text>Ephraim W. Morse (October 16, 1823 – January 17, 1906) was an early settler of the city of San Diego, and was partially responsible for many of its expansions as a city, such as attracting the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway and proposing Balboa Park.

==Early life==
Morse was born in 1823 in West Amesbury, Massachusetts (incorporated in 1876 as Merrimac, Massachusetts). He lived there as a farmer and teacher until 1848, when news of the California gold rush took the United States by storm.

==Ship charter to San Francisco==
He decided to form a company to charter a ship and gather materials for a voyage to the gold fields. He later stated that &quot;this company was intended to be, and was, a select company. No one could join without presenting satisfactory recommendations from the selectmen of the town, the mayor of their city, or some prominent preacher.&quot; It was indeed a stringent organization, in which each member had to give their time and interests to the company rather than themselves, nor could they assume pecuniary liabilities without company approval, or drink or gamble, all under penalty of a fine. Labor on the Sabbath was also prohibited unless of urgent necessity. However, members would be cared for in sickness, and in case of death buried at the company&#x27;s expense. The members mainly consisted of Morse&#x27;s friends, relatives, and associates. By early 1849 they managed to charter a ship, the &quot;Leonora&quot;, and on February 4, 1849, they set sail for San Francisco, arriving on July 5. The members then dispersed to the mines on the Yuba River north of Sacramento. However, Morse and his partner, Levi Slack, could not cope with the California summer heat. Then they heard about the small town of San Diego, far to the south near the U.S.-Mexico border.

==Move to San Diego==
The two had both read &quot;Two Years Before the Mast&quot; by fellow Massachusetts native Richard Henry Dana Jr., about his voyage by sea to California, spending much time in San Diego, then a small Mexican pueblo. They decided to resettle there for the time being. In April 1850 the two arrived, and opened a store in the settlement of Davistown on San Diego Bay. When Davistown faltered, they relocated to the main center of town, further north on the San Diego River near the old Spanish presidio (fortress).

After a year, Morse found himself recuperated, and decided to return to Massachusetts. Despite a rough voyage via Nicaragua, he returned safely to his hometown of West Amesbury, where he met and married a local woman, Lydia A. Gray. The two lived there until he heard of the sudden death of Levi Slack back in San Diego. He then returned alone to attend his friend&#x27;s funeral, then came back again in May 1852.

However, the couple had become drawn to the young city&#x27;s dry, warm climate, and the following year made the journey West again, this time permanently. They were joined by Thomas Whaley and his wife, from New York City. Morse and Whaley jointly operated a store in the town center until 1856, when they split up. In 1859, Morse left San Diego for the open farmland of Palomar Mountain, where he became a farmer and rancher. Morse was also established in beekeeping. He was one of the first commercial beekeepers in the San Diego area and had several hundred hives in various operations.

In 1861, Morse returned to San Diego and started a new business as a merchant, as well as a Wells Fargo express agent, making a name for himself as a prominent local man. In June 1869, he moved to the new development of Horton&#x27;s Addition, also known as New Town, organized and promoted by the successful land merchant Alonzo Horton. Although many residents of the former town center (known to this day as Old Town) were angered, the new site became the focus of the growing town because it was located on the bay, providing easier access for shipping. He was subsequently joined by Philip Crosthwaite, another early Anglo resident of San Diego. Morse, in conjunction with Horton, did much to promote the new downtown on the water.

==Development of San Diego==
From the beginning of his time in San Diego, Morse took an active role in local political affairs. In 1852 he was elected associate judge of the court of sessions, and also that year to the secretary of the board of trade, as which he served for 12 years. From 1858–1859 he served as San Diego County treasurer, and again from 1861–1863. From 1866–1867 he served as city trustee, in which capacity he sold many lands to Horton. He also served as public administrator from 1876 to 1877. However, he did not wish to become a politician, and only served in public office if he felt it would be necessary. Thus he did not seek any higher office.

However, his varied efforts did much to promote San Diego&#x27;s name throughout the nation and help it mature into a thriving metropolis. In 1870, he organized the city&#x27;s first bank, the Bank of San Diego, and in 1871 he went to Washington, DC to present information about San Diego&#x27;s pueblo land interests. Like many local businessmen, he gained much wealth during the city&#x27;s land boom in the early and mid-1880s, only to lose much of it when the boom collapsed at the end of the decade.

He also became a tireless promoter of attracting a railroad to the steadily growing city, starting by organizing the San Diego &amp; Gila Railroad Company. In October 1879, while he was serving on the Citizens&#x27; Committee, representatives of the Santa Fe Railroad visited San Diego, and Morse enthusiastically promoted the city&#x27;s virtues. The railroad company was soon convinced, and in 1881, the California Southern Railroad, a subsidiary of the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway, began building a line northward from San Diego to connect with the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad in present-day Barstow in 1885. The rail connections to Los Angeles were completed by 1887.

Morse was also admitted to the bar in 1856, and from 1880 to 1886 he capitalized on San Diego&#x27;s growing land interests as a member of the real estate firm Morse, Whaley &amp; Dalton. He also invested much and heavily promoted the San Diego Flume Company, which helped provide much-needed water for the arid city.

One of his most lasting achievements was the promotion of local open space for public enjoyment, resulting in the current Balboa Park, one of the city&#x27;s most beloved attractions. He joined with Alonzo Horton in 1868 to propose the establishment of a park reserve of 1400 acres; the San Diego Board of Trustees adopted the proposal and the land became the nucleus of City Park, later renamed Balboa Park.

==Personal life==

Morse&#x27;s first wife, Lydia, died in Old Town in 1856. In 1865, Morse brought New Hampshire schoolteacher Mary Chase Walker to serve in the local school, Mason Street School in San Diego, California. The two married on December 20, 1866. By his first wife he had one son, Edward, who eventually resettled in newly incorporated Merrimac, Massachusetts, formerly West Amesbury. Morse died on January 17, 1906.

<text>A field trip or [[excursion]] is a journey by a group of associated peers, such as coworkers or school students, to a place away from their normal environment for the purpose of education or leisure, either within their country or abroad.

When arranged by a school administration for students, it is also known as school trip in the United Kingdom, Australia, Kenya, New Zealand and Bangladesh, and school tour in Ireland.

A 2022 study, which used randomized controlled trial data, found that culturally enriching field trips led students to show a greater interest in arts, greater tolerance for people with different views, and boosted their educational outcomes.

==Overview==
The purpose of the field trip is usually &quot;observation&quot; for education, non-experimental research or to provide students with experiences outside their everyday activities, such as going camping with teachers and their classmates. The aim of this research is to observe the subject in its natural state and possibly collect samples. It is seen that more-advantaged children may have already experienced cultural institutions outside of school, and field trips provide common ground between more-advantaged and less-advantaged children to share the same cultural experiences.

Field trips often involve three steps: preparation, activities and follow-up activity. Preparation applies to both the students and the teachers. Teachers often take the time to learn about the destination and the subject before the trip. Activities on the field trips often include: lectures, tours, worksheets, videos and demonstrations. Follow-up activities are generally discussions in the classroom once the field trip is completed.

In Western culture people first come across this method during school years when classes are taken on school trips to visit a geological or geographical feature of the landscape, for example. Much of the early research into the natural sciences was of this form. Charles Darwin is an important example of someone who has contributed to science through the use of field trips.

Popular field trip sites include zoos, nature centers, community agencies such as fire stations and hospitals, government agencies, local businesses, amusement parks, science museums and factories. Field trips provide alternative educational opportunities for children and can benefit the community if they include some type of community service. Field trips also let students take a break from their normal routine and experience more hands-on learning. Places like zoos and nature centers often have an interactive display that allows children to touch plants or animals.

Today, culturally enriching field trips are in decline. Museums across the United States report a steep drop in school tours. For example, the Field Museum in Chicago at one time welcomed more than 300,000 students every year. Recently, the number is below 200,000. Between 2002 and 2007, Cincinnati arts organizations saw a 30 percent decrease in student attendance. A survey by the American Association of School Administrators found that more than half of schools eliminated planned field trips in 2010–11.

== Site school ==
A variation on the field trip is the &quot;site-based program&quot; or &quot;site-school&quot; model, where a class temporarily relocates to a non-school location for an entire week to take advantage of the resources on the site. As with a multi-day field trip, appropriate overnight camping or lodging arrangements are often made to accommodate the experience. The approach was first developed at the Calgary Zoo in Alberta, Canada in 1993, and &quot;Zoo School&quot; was inaugurated in 1994. The Calgary Board of Education then approached the Glenbow Museum and Archives to create a &quot;Museum School&quot; in 1995 followed by the Calgary Science Centre (1996), the University of Calgary (1996), Canada Olympic Park (1997), the Inglewood Bird Sanctuary (1998), Calgary City Hall (2000), Cross Conservation Area (2000), the Calgary Stampede (2002), the Calgary Aero-Space Museum (2005), and the Fire Training Academy (2008). One of the newer schools in Calgary is Tinker School and Social Enterprise School as STEM Learning Lab (2018) The model spread across Alberta (with 15 sites in Edmonton alone), throughout Canada and in the United States. Global coordination of the model is through the &quot;Beyond the Classroom Network&quot;.

==Europe==
In Europe, &quot;School Trip&quot;, a 2002 German-Polish film, describes the German students&#x27; trip to Poland during the summer.

==School trips in east Asia==

In Japan, in addition to the one-day field trip, the school trip, called &quot;shūgaku ryokō&quot; (, literally &quot;learning journey&quot;), has a history since 1886, and is now part of the middle school and high school curriculum, with all students participating in such a program. The trip is usually longer than several days, such as a week or several weeks long. The typical locations visited within Japan are regions of national or historical significance, such as ancient capitals of Kyoto and Nara, Nagasaki, for its experience with nuclear weapons and historical significance as the sole international port during the country&#x27;s 17th–19th century isolationist foreign policy (さこく) and Nikkō 日光, popular &quot;onsen&quot; spa town renowned for its beauty. Travelling abroad is occasionally chosen as an option by some schools.

In other Asian regions/countries such as South Korea, Taiwan and Singapore, the school trip, when arranged, tends to become a voluntary part of the school curriculum. When Japan was selected, the Japanese government waived the entry visa.
