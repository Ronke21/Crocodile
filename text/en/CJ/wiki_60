<text>Michael Marra (17 February 1952 – 23 October 2012) was a Scottish singer-songwriter and musician from Dundee, Scotland. Known as the Bard of Dundee, Marra was a solo performer who toured the UK and performed in arts centres, theatres, folk clubs and village halls. While mainly known as a songwriter, he also worked extensively in theatre, radio and television. His songwriting was rooted in Scottish life and he found an audience within and beyond the folk music scene, which led to him working as a support musician for performers including Van Morrison, The Proclaimers, Barbara Dickson and Deacon Blue. His song &quot;Hermless&quot; was somewhat humorously suggested as a potential Scottish national anthem.

==Origins==
Marra was brought up in the Lochee district of Dundee, the son of a printer and a schoolteacher. His first public performance, in the 1950s, was at a Christmas party given by NCR, formerly a major employer in the city, with a large factory there.

==Musical career==
Marra attended Lawside Academy, leaving school at 15 and trying a variety of trades – electrician, baker and builder – before heading for the folk clubs of London. There he played in the band Hen&#x27;s Teeth with fellow Scottish songwriter Dougie MacLean, before forming the band Skeets Boliver with his brother Chris. Marra played with Skeets Boliver in the mid-1970s, alongside drummer Brian McDermott, saxman Peter McGlone, Gus Foy, Stewart Ivins, and Chris Marra. Signed to Thunderbird Records at an inopportune time, when punk was gaining popularity, the band released two singles, &quot;Streethouse Door&quot; and &quot;Moonlight in Jeopardy&quot;, to critical success. They also featured in an edition of the BBC &quot;Everyman&quot; religious programme, &quot;I Can&#x27;t See the Light.&quot; 

In September 2007 Marra released the CD &quot;Quintet&quot;, featuring five songs about five musicians – Peerie Willie Johnson, Peter McGlone, Thomas Fraser, Martin Carthy and Dr. John. In November 2007, he appeared in a new production of &quot;The Demon Barber&quot; at Perth Theatre in Scotland where he performed all his music live on stage. Marra also created the opera Nan Garland, which was performed at Dundee Rep in 2004. Three years later, in September 2010, the album &quot;Michael Marra&quot;, recorded live on tour in 2010 with Mr McFall&#x27;s Chamber, was released on Delphian Records.

Marra performed original songs with the Scottish Symphony Orchestra, the Scottish National Orchestra, Concerto Caledonia, Mr McFall&#x27;s Chamber, and his own quintet. He sang duets with Patti Smith, Eddi Reader, Karen Matheson and Karine Polwart.

In 2003 Marra collaborated with Martyn Bennett for his final album Grit (Martyn Bennett album), contributing a spoken passage for the song &quot;Liberation&quot;. In an interview Marra stated, &quot;When I first heard it, I thought I sounded like a minister, and that came as a surprise to me. But I think that&#x27;s what he was after to tell the truth&quot;, later joking: &quot;I might become a minister&quot;.

His songs have been covered by a wide range of artists, including Sylvia Rae Tracey, Coope Boyes and Simpson, Alan Cumming, Leo Sayer and Rab Noakes.
Marra&#x27;s live CD, &quot;Recorded Live on Tour with Mr McFall&#x27;s Chamber&quot; was released on Delphian Records in 2007. In 2012 he released &quot;Houseroom&quot;, a six-track collaboration CD with The Hazey Janes, on Tob Records.

An exhibition of his portraiture prints was shown at Dundee&#x27;s Bank Street Gallery.

==Musical theatre==
Marra wrote original music and worked both as an actor and musical director in theatre.

His first production with Wildcat Stage Productions was &quot;Fancy Rappin&quot;&#x27; and he frequently worked with its Director, Alan Lyddiard at Dundee Rep. He played several roles in the Wildcat and Freeway production of John McGrath&#x27;s &quot;Border Warfare&quot; at the Tramway Theatre in February/March 1990.
He wrote and performed in the show &quot;In Flagrant Delicht&quot; which was written in collaboration with Scottish Makar and playwright Liz Lochhead. The show was performed in Washington DC and Melbourne, Australia.

Marra&#x27;s operetta &quot;If The Moon Can Be Believed&quot; was performed at the Dundee Rep to sell out audiences. He collaborated with Graham McLaren of Theatre Babel on a new production of &quot;The Demon Barber&quot; for Perth Theatre having previously worked with him on Liz Lochhead&#x27;s &quot;Beauty and The Beast&quot;.

His play &quot;St Catherine&#x27;s Day&quot; played to full houses at the Òran Mór Glasgow and the Dundee Repertory Theatre. He also collaborated with award winning choreographer Frank McConnell and his dance company Plan B on &quot;Love and Pocket Money&quot;, &quot;parallel|parallels&quot; and &quot;A Wee Home From Home&quot;.

==Songwriting==
In April 2006, having his fingerprints routinely taken by Customs in Washington D.C. – where he was performing as part of Tartan Week – Marra was inspired to write a protest song about Scottish police detective Shirley McKie, who had been wrongly accused of leaving her thumbprint at a murder scene in 1997. When she denied the print was hers, she was arrested and charged with perjury but acquitted in 1999. In February 2006, McKie received an out-of-court settlement of £750,000 from the Scottish Executive, which first minister Jack McConnell described as a result of an honest mistake. In the song, Marra wrote:
Marra&#x27;s work, though often humorous, tackled a range of social and political issues. His song &quot;Lieblings in The Absence of Love&quot;, was written in response to the tension he had witnessed during riots in Bonn, and the treatment of the refugees thereafter. His song &quot;Chain Up The Swings&quot; discusses the practice of some Scottish Christian communities who would chain up the swings on a Sunday, so the children would be prevented from playing on the sabbath. Tackling literary adaption, &quot;Happed in Mist&quot; revolves around the executed deserter from the famous Scottish novel &quot;Sunset Song&quot;. He proposed his work &quot;Hermless&quot; as an alternative national anthem. The song is intended as a contrast to typical militaristic and imperialist national anthems, and describes the day-to-day life of an innocent meek character who claims,

concluding,
==Personal life==
Marra was married to Peggy, and their children, Alice and Matthew, are also musicians and members of the Dundee-based group, The Hazey Janes. Former Labour MSP Jenny Marra and current Labour MSP Michael Marra are his niece and nephew.

Marra was a supporter of Dundee F.C.

==Death==
Michael Marra died in Ninewells Hospital on 23 October 2012, aged 60, of throat cancer.

== Legacy ==
A mural of Marra was painted in Lochee which was completed on 28 May 2021 by Michael Corr.

==Awards==
In 2007 Marra was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Dundee University in recognition of his contribution to the cultural profile of his home town, and in 2011 he was made an Honorary Doctor of Letters by Glasgow Caledonian University. He also won the Herald Angel Award in 2010 for his performance at The Acoustic Music Centre during the Edinburgh Fringe Festival.

<text>Eduard Vogel (7 March 1829February 1856) was a German explorer in Central Africa.

== Early career ==
Vogel was born in Krefeld. He studied mathematics, botany and astronomy at Leipzig and Berlin, studying with Encke at the latter institution. In 1851, he was engaged as assistant astronomer to director John Russel Hind at George Bishop&#x27;s private observatory in London. That year August Heinrich Petermann introduced Vogel to the Royal Geographical Society.

== Africa commission ==
In 1853 Petermann arranged for Vogel to be chosen by the British government to join the Richardson, Overweg and Barth expedition with supplies. That expedition had been sent to Africa in 1849 to find a trade route that bypassed the Arabs. Vogel was to be a replacement for Richardson who had died two years earlier and was tasked to make geographical and meteorological observations and to collect botanical specimens. In 1853, the expedition was in the western Sudan.

Vogel sailed from England on 20 February 1853. The day Vogel left London, news had arrived that Overweg had also died, leaving Barth on his own.

== Meeting Barth ==
On 25 July, Vogel left Tripoli with a caravan to catch up with Barth. Vogel arrived at the end of the Trans-Saharan trade route, Kuka, the capital of Bornu on 13 January 1854. Vogel&#x27;s specimens, and the fact that both expedition engineers were soldiers, made the king there suspicious of his intentions, and Vogel&#x27;s movements were severely restricted.

Instead of waiting for Barth to return, on 19 July, Vogel joined a steamboat expedition heading up the Niger and Benue Rivers to the Mandara Mountains where he was imprisoned by the king of Mora who had received a message about the suspicious stranger from Bornu. Vogel eventually escaped to Marghi in Nigeria where he waited for news of Barth.
Upon hearing of a change of king in Bornu, Vogel returned to wait for Barth, whom he met December 1854.

By some accounts Vogel was disliked by the other members of the expedition due to his poor attitude, difficult personality and unwillingness to learn Arabic, the lingua franca of north Africa. The arrival of Barth helped defuse some of the conflict, although one of the two engineers refused to travel any further while Vogel was part of the expedition. Barth himself contemplated getting rid of Vogel and stealing his equipment.

== Further exploration ==
Vogel left Barth, and taking one engineer and four servants headed for Bauchi where he ingratiated himself with the Emir by killing a man the Emir disliked. He then became the first European to cross the Muri Mountains angering the Tangale people in the process as he desecrated their shrines by sleeping in them during the journey. He penetrated south to the upper course of the Benue, returning to Kuka 1 December 1855. From this date, the notes of his expedition cease.

== Death ==
Vogel left Kuka for the Nile Valley, leaving his engineer, MacGuire, with his notes and specimen collections. Vogel got as far as Wadai (also spelled Ouaddai) in southern Sudan. MacGuire may have known of Vogel&#x27;s fate but was killed by brigands while returning to Tripoli. Several search expeditions were organized to ascertain Vogel&#x27;s fate and to recover his papers, but it was not until 1873 that Gustav Nachtigal, on reaching Wadai, learnt of the circumstances of Vogel&#x27;s February 1856 death in Wara, the capital of Wadai.

Nachtigal&#x27;s account was that Vogel&#x27;s odd habit of existing almost solely on eggs and writing with a pencil rather than the expected ink was of concern to the Sultan&#x27;s advisors who had advised the Sultan to kill him &quot;just in case&quot;. The sultan was hesitant but Vogel then climbed Mount Treya which was sacred and off limits to all but the highest officials. Vogel was beaten to death by &quot;Kubartu&quot; with iron tipped cudgels. According to Nachtigal, &quot;Kubartu&quot; were a Wadai clan consisting of musicians and executioners.

==Family==
His sister Elise Vogel Polko was a popular German novelist. She published his notes in her &quot;Erinnerungen an einen Verschollenen&quot; (1863). Another resource is Adolf Pahde&#x27;s &quot;Der Afrikaforscher Eduard Vogel&quot;. Hamburg, 1889 (first published Krefeld, 1886).

In 1997, with the AA Trenton Thunder, he was 16–5 with a 2.63 ERA in 26 starts and was selected as a Triple-A All-Star.

===Montreal Expos===
In November , the Red Sox sent Pavano to Montreal, along with pitcher Tony Armas Jr., in a trade that brought Pedro Martínez to Boston. Pavano made his Major League debut on May 23, 1998 by starting and pitching seven strong innings against the Philadelphia Phillies. He allowed one run and struck out six while allowing no walks. He recorded his first win on June 2, 1998 when he pitched 7.1 innings, also against the Phillies. Pavano is well known for giving up Mark McGwire&#x27;s 70th home run in the 1998 season. He pitched four and one-half seasons for the Expos, making 78 starts and had a record of 24–35 and an ERA of 4.83.

===Florida Marlins===
The Expos traded Pavano to the Florida Marlins in the middle of the season (with Graeme Lloyd, Mike Mordecai and Justin Wayne) for Cliff Floyd, Wilton Guerrero, and Claudio Vargas.

Despite being plagued by injuries, Pavano became an important part of Florida&#x27;s starting rotation and had a highly successful postseason in for the World Series champion Marlins. He started Game 4 of the Series against the Yankees, holding New York to one run over eight innings in a game the Marlins would go on to win, 4–3, in extra innings.

Pavano followed up his playoff exploits with his best season to date in , posting an 18–8 record and a 3.00 ERA.

===New York Yankees===
Pavano became a free agent following the season and, despite receiving bigger offers from Boston, Detroit, and Cincinnati, chose to accept a four-year contract worth $39.95 million with the New York Yankees on December 20, 2004.
Pavano began the 2005 season with quality starts in seven of his first 10 appearances, compiling a 4–2 record and a 3.69 ERA. However, in June of that year, he injured his right shoulder and went on the disabled list. Pavano made 17 starts and finished 4–6 with a 4.77 ERA. The Yankees expected him to be healthy for the 2006 season, but Pavano began the season on the disabled list after bruising his buttocks in a spring training game. He did not pitch at all in the Majors in 2006, making only minor league rehab starts. On August 15, 2006, Pavano broke two ribs in an automobile accident after he hit another vehicle with his Porsche in West Palm Beach, Florida. His girlfriend at the time, Gia Allemand, was with him in the car. However, he did not tell the Yankees about the incident until August 28, the day they informed him that they planned for him to come off the disabled list to play that Thursday.

During spring training in 2007, Yankees pitcher Mike Mussina said that Pavano needed to prove that he wanted to pitch for the team, and that he did not believe he was the only Yankee who felt this way. &quot;It didn&#x27;t look good from a player&#x27;s and teammate&#x27;s standpoint,&quot; Mussina said of Pavano&#x27;s injuries. &quot;Was everything just coincidence? Over and over again? I don&#x27;t know.&quot; Manager Joe Torre explained that the amount of work Pavano needed to do in repairing his clubhouse image was &quot;sizable.&quot;
 Later that season, after ace Chien-Ming Wang injured his right hamstring late in spring training, the Yankees chose Pavano to start on Opening Day against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays at Yankee Stadium. On April 15, 2007, Pavano was placed on the 15-day DL with what was described as an &quot;elbow strain&quot;. On May 23, 2007, it was reported that Pavano would opt for Tommy John surgery on his elbow.

In December 2007, the Yankees asked Pavano to accept a minor-league contract to clear space on their 40-man roster. Pavano&#x27;s agent, Tom O&#x27;Connell, stated that Pavano would consider the request, but he later turned it down. O&#x27;Connell also stated that Pavano&#x27;s rehabilitation was going faster than expected and he might be available to pitch at the Major League level by mid-summer 2008.

On July 29, 2008, Pavano made his first rehab start since his Tommy John surgery for the Charleston RiverDogs, allowing one hit and one walk in two scoreless innings.

Pavano made his first start of the season during the Yankees’ series against the Baltimore Orioles on August 23, 2008, pitching five innings, giving up three earned runs on seven hits, one walk and five strikeouts in the 5–3 Yankees win. He made his second start of the season against the Toronto Blue Jays on August 29 and was victorious, pitching six strong innings in the Yankees&#x27; 2–1 win.

Since his first stint on the disabled list, Pavano did not endear himself to his Yankee teammates, and he stated that he would not visit the team when they played in Tampa Bay, near where he was rehabilitating. Meanwhile, Pavano&#x27;s agent Tom O&#x27;Connell believed that Pavano would still be a desired commodity on the free-agent market that winter, even with his injury history. &quot;Carl&#x27;s a 1–2 starter. Those guys don&#x27;t grow on trees. Those guys are very rare, 200-inning guys are very rare in this game, and they&#x27;re the ones that make the money. And he did it two years in a row, before he got hurt, and I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;s going to do it again,&quot; O&#x27;Connell said.

During a game Pavano started on September 14, he allowed three earned runs and five hits before leaving the mound in the sixth inning following a visit by the trainer and manager Joe Girardi. Pavano was pitching to Eric Hinske with one out and a runner on first when he got the mound visit. After a short discussion, Pavano walked off the field as the sellout crowd showered him with boos. It was reported as a &quot;left hip injury.&quot;

Due to his repeated injuries with the Yankees, the New York media began derisively referring to Pavano as &quot;American Idle.&quot; During his time with the Yankees, he pitched a combined 26 MLB games over four seasons, compared to 31 with the Marlins in 2004.

===Cleveland Indians===
On January 6, 2009, Pavano signed a one-year deal with the Cleveland Indians worth $1.5 million with a possible $5.3 million in incentives.

===Minnesota Twins===
On August 7, 2009, Pavano was traded to the Minnesota Twins, for whom he lost the clinching third game against the Yankees in the 2009 American League Division Series (ALDS).

Following the season, Pavano filed for free agency, but later accepted the Twins&#x27; offer through salary arbitration. He ended up having his best season since 2004. During the stretch from May 29 to August 13, Pavano compiled a record of 11–2 with an ERA of 2.79, including twice throwing back-to-back complete games in which one was also a shutout. He went 17–11 with an ERA of 3.75 over the course of the season (in which he also threw 221 innings) and helped the Twins run away with the Central Division title. However, in the playoffs Pavano lost Game 2 of the 2010 ALDS to the Yankees at Target Field 5–2, and the Twins were swept in three games to end the season.

For 2010, Pavano was named the Twins&#x27; Pitcher of the Year, receiving the Joseph W. Haynes Award.

On January 19, 2011, Pavano agreed to a two-year, $16.5 million contract with the Twins. He was paid $8 million in 2011 and $8.5 million in 2012, along with up to $500,000 in incentives.

Pavano was the Opening Day starter for the Twins on April 1, 2011, giving up seven earned runs over 4+ innings in a 13–3 loss to the Toronto Blue Jays.

On May 1, 2011, after performing poorly against the Kansas City Royals, Pavano took a bat to a trashcan in the Minnesota Twins dugout after being removed in the sixth inning of a 10–3 loss. Pavano responded by saying &quot;That&#x27;s as frustrated as I can get. It actually felt pretty good. I just kept whaling away with it. The (bat) wouldn&#x27;t break. I couldn&#x27;t break a bat in the dugout and I couldn&#x27;t break any out there (on the mound). It was embarrassing.&quot; Pavano&#x27;s stats as of his May 8 start were 2–4 and an ERA of 6.64, the highest of any Twins pitcher at this point in the season. However, on May 13, 2011, Pavano threw scoreless innings against the Blue Jays but got the no decision in the Twins 2–0 loss. His pitching continued to improve through late May and early June. Pavano recorded his 100th win in a complete game two-run performance on June 3 against Kansas City, and he pitched another complete game win 12 days later against the White Sox. Pavano continued the season with mixed success. He finished with a 9–13 record and a 4.30 ERA, closing out the Twins&#x27; season with a shutout of Kansas City Royals. Of the five starting pitchers for the Twins in 2011, Pavano was the only one who remained in the rotation for the entire season. Francisco Liriano, Brian Duensing, Nick Blackburn, and Scott Baker all missed starts due to injuries.

Pavano was again the opening day starter for the Twins in 2012. He took the loss after allowing four runs on five hits in seven innings pitched against the Baltimore Orioles.

He announced his retirement from baseball on February 26, 2014.

==Analyst==
Pavano served as an analyst for Fox Sports Florida for Miami Marlins pre- and postgame shows starting with the 2014 season. He was dropped in 2017.

==Pitching style==
Pavano was a sinkerballer. He threw his sinker and less-used four-seam fastball in the mid-to-upper 80s. He also had a slider and changeup, the former primarily used against right-handed hitters and the latter primarily against lefties.

<text>Beacon Hill, near Loughborough, in Leicestershire, England, is a popular country park. It is one of several beacon hills in the United Kingdom. It is part of Beacon Hill, Hangingstone and Outwoods Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==Description==
The park consists of over of grassland and woodland and offers recreational walking, and some short climbs. With a maximum height of , it is the second highest point in Leicestershire after Bardon Hill, although the OS map shows Birch Hill, which is near Copt Oak to be 254m.

An extinct volcano, in Whitwick, to the west, was responsible for the fine-grained igneous rocks that the hill consists of. Beacon Hill was the site of a Bronze Age hill fort. Today a toposcope indicates landmarks which can be seen from the summit. These include Lincoln Cathedral and the hills of the Peak District.

Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station is aligned so that, seen from the summit, only two of its eight cooling towers are visible.

On a clear day Belvoir Castle can be seen as well as the hills in the Peak District. Derby, Nottingham, and the tower of Lincoln Cathedral can be seen with a pair of binoculars. Loughborough is seen below the hill as is Beaumanor Hall. You can also hear and see steam trains on the Great Central Railway which has stations at Loughborough, Quorn and Woodhouse.

It was featured on the 2005 TV programme Seven Natural Wonders as one of the wonders of the Midlands. There are some very interesting rocks on the summit.

Nearby are two small woods both accessible to the public. Jubilee Wood is north-west of the lower Beacon hill car park on the Woodhouse Eaves to Nanpantan road and the Outwoods which is adjacent to Jubilee Wood.

The park has been awarded the Green Flag Award.

== Native tree collection ==
The park contains a collection of native trees, first planted in 1996. Many of the trees are labelled, and there are several boxes that provide audio commentary on the biology and historical interest of selected tree species at the push of a button.

== Access ==
There are car parks top and bottom, accessible from Beacon Road or Breakback Road, with a pay on exit barrier system, accepting cash and card. For access by public transport, buses between Leicester and Loughborough via Anstey serve Woodhouse Eaves. Service 154 operated by Centrebus runs Monday to Friday and Kinchbus service 123 on Saturdays.

== Features and activities ==
Beacon Hill Country Park has picnic areas, walking routes, a barbecue site (seasonal), horse tracks and permanent orienteering markers. Each August the park opens for a country fair.

<text>Kangra district is the most populous district of the Indian state of Himachal Pradesh. Dharamshala is the administrative headquarters of the district.

==History==

Kangra is known for having one of the oldest serving Royal Dynasty in the world, the Katoch of the Kangra State. In 1758, Raja Ghamand Chand was appointed &quot;nazim&quot; or governor of Jullundur Doab under the Afghans. Ghamand Chand was a brave and strong ruler who restored the prestige of Kangra. As he was unable to capture Kangra Fort, he built another fort at Tira Sujanpur on the left bank of the Beas, almost opposite to Alampur on a hill overlooking the town. He died in 1774 and was succeeded by his son, Tegh Chand, who died too soon in 1775. Ghamand Chand&#x27;s grandson, Raja Sansar Chand (r. 1775–1823) established the supremacy of Kangra over all the surrounding hill states. During his reign, Kangra became a major centre for the arts and several palaces were built.

In 1805, the neighbouring hill states rebelled, with the aid of the Gurkha army. Raja Sansar Chand was forced to seek the help of Maharaja Ranjit Singh of the Sikh Empire . The Gurkha army was expelled but Ranjit Singh also annexed the most fertile part of the Kangra valley, reducing the Katochs of Kangra as well as the neighbouring rajas to the status of vassals. Kangra was annexed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s Sikh Empire in 1810.

Kangra became a district of British India in 1846, when it was ceded to British India at the conclusion of the First Anglo-Sikh War. The British district included the present-day districts of Kangra, Hamirpur, Kullu, and Lahul and Spiti. Kangra District was part of the British province of Punjab. The administrative headquarters of the district were initially at Kangra, but were moved to Dharamshala in 1855.

<text>Baseline Road ([[List of numbered routes in Ottawa|Ottawa Road #16]]) is a road in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada.

Baseline runs from Richmond Road (almost directly over Highway 416) east in a straight line until it ends at the Heron Road Bridge over the Rideau River and Rideau Canal when it becomes Heron Road. Before the 2001 City of Ottawa amalgamation, Baseline formed the border of the city of Ottawa and Nepean. The street is named for its location as the baseline for Nepean Township. When Nepean Township was surveyed, Baseline formed the northern boundary of Nepean&#x27;s six north–south concessions. Currently, Baseline is a major east–west street, and in the late 1990s it became so busy that Hunt Club Road had to be extended west of the Rideau River to alleviate pressure.

Points of interest on Baseline include the Queensway Carleton Hospital, the Boy Scouts Museum, Algonquin College and the Central Experimental Farm.

Baseline Road is a four-lane principal arterial road for its entire length, except between Centrepointe Drive and Navaho Drive, where it is a five-lane/six-lane arterial (three eastbound lanes and three westbound lanes – a bus lane is present from Constellation west to Centrepointe in lieu of the third westbound lane). The speed limit is for most of its length except a short section west of Greenbank Road, where it is .

Ramsayville Road in southeast Ottawa used to be called Base Line Road before 2003. The name had to be changed when the former city of Gloucester amalgamated with the city of Ottawa, to avoid confusion.

In the future, Baseline Road will have bus lanes between Navaho Drive and Prince of Wales Drive to speed up transit service in this stretch (OC Transpo bus route 88) due to consistent heavy traffic.

<doc id="1101421" wikidata="Q6843447" url="?curid=1101421" title="Midwest Unrest">
<text>Midwest Unrest was a small collective in Chicago formed by anarchists and anti-capitalists in a planning meeting for that city&#x27;s mobilization to the protests against the Free Trade Area of the Americas summit in Miami in November 2003. Midwest Unrest organized a pre-mobilization consulta, and took part in the week of protests that was met with a style of repression now often referred to as the Miami model. It then organized a protest locally against the Central American Free Trade Agreement that December, and became something of a fixture of citywide and anti-fascist protests in Chicago. Additionally, as a result of connections made via the anti-FTAA consulta, it attempted to formalize networking with similar groups regionally.

The collective experienced internal conflict the next August over allegations of rape that were leveled against one of its members, who was then expelled from the group.

More recently, the Midwest Unrest collective participated in a citywide campaign to prevent threatened service cuts and fare increases by the Chicago Transit Authority. Through aggressive agitation in public hearings, meetings and flyering, the group pushed the Fare Strike tactic set for December 15 of 2004. The CTA postponed its decision for six months in what many community groups in the city heralded as a victory. 

As of 2006, the Midwest Unrest collective has disbanded.

<doc id="1101425" wikidata="Q434578" url="?curid=1101425" title="Dickey Chapelle">
<text>Georgette Louise Meyer (March 14, 1919 – November 4, 1965) known as Dickey Chapelle was an American photojournalist known for her work as a war correspondent from World War II through to her death in the Vietnam War.

==Early life==
Chapelle was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and attended Shorewood High School. By the age of sixteen, she was attending aeronautical design classes at Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She soon returned home, where she worked at a local airfield, hoping to learn to pilot airplanes instead of designing them. However, when her mother learned that she was also having an affair with one of the pilots, Chapelle was forced to live with her grandparents in Coral Gables, Florida. There, she wrote press releases for an air show, which led to an assignment in Havana, Cuba.

A story on a Cuban air show disaster that Chapelle submitted to &quot;The New York Times&quot; got her noticed by an editor at Transcontinental and Western Air (TWA), which prompted her to move to New York City. Working at the TWA publicity bureau, she began to take weekly photography classes with Tony Chapelle, who became her husband in October 1940. She eventually quit her job at TWA to compile a portfolio, which she sold to &quot;Look&quot; magazine in 1941. In April 1941, she was hired by Lear Avia to handle press liaison work for the New York office, according to a press release from the company. Later, after fifteen years of marriage, she divorced Tony, and changed her first name to Dickey. She changed her name because she looked up to polar explorer Admiral Richard Byrd. Richard&#x27;s nickname was Dickey.

==Breakthrough==
Despite limited photographic credentials Chapelle managed to become a war correspondent photojournalist during World War II for National Geographic, and with one of her first assignments, was posted with the Marines during the battle of Iwo Jima. She covered the battle of Okinawa as well. By the end of the war, she had written many war-related articles in addition to nine books, mostly about women in aviation. 

After the war, she traveled extensively and worked in many active war zones. During the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, Chapelle was captured and jailed for over seven weeks. She later learned to jump by parachute, and when in war zones preferred to travel directly with the troops. After being told, on jumping out of a helicopter, that there was no reason to close her eyes, she adopted the motto &quot;Only you can frighten you&quot;. Chapelle won many awards for photojournalism, and earned the respect of both the military and journalistic community. Chapelle &quot;was a tiny woman known for her refusal to kowtow to authority and her signature uniform: fatigues, an Australian bush hat, dramatic Harlequin glasses, and pearl earrings.&quot;

==Later life==

Despite early support for Fidel Castro, Chapelle was an outspoken anti-Communist, and loudly expressed these views at the beginning of the Vietnam War. Her stories in the early 1960s extolled the American military advisors who were already fighting and dying in South Vietnam, and the Sea Swallows, the anticommunist militia led by Father Nguyễn Lạc Hoá. 

Dickey never got any special treatment because of her sex. Chapelle was killed on November 4, 1965, while on patrol with a Marine platoon during Operation Black Ferret, a search and destroy operation 16 km south of Chu Lai, Quảng Ngãi province, South Vietnam. The lieutenant in front of her kicked a tripwire boobytrap, consisting of a mortar shell with a hand grenade attached to the top of it. Chapelle was hit in the neck by a piece of shrapnel metal which severed her carotid artery and she died soon afterwards. Her last moments were captured in a photograph by Henri Huet. Her body was repatriated with an honor guard consisting of six Marines, and she was given a full Marine burial. There is now a monument near the site of her death. The group of Marines dedicated the memorial marker. It says &quot;&quot;She was one of us and we will miss her&quot;.&quot; 

She became the first female war correspondent to be killed in Vietnam, as well as the first American female reporter to be killed in action.

==Awards==
*Overseas Press Club&#x27;s George Polk Award for best reporting in any medium, requiring exceptional courage and enterprise abroad.
*National Press Photographers Association 1963 &quot;Best Use of Photographs by a Newspaper&quot; award for her photograph of a combat-ready Marine in Vietnam which appeared in the Milwaukee Journal newspaper.
*Distinguished Service Award, presented by the U.S. Marine Corps Combat Correspondents Association.
*Milwaukee Press Club inducted her into the hall of fame on the 50th anniversary of her death. 

==Legacy==
*The Marine Corps League, in conjunction with the United States Marine Corps, honors her memory by presenting the Dickey Chapelle Award annually to recognize the woman who has contributed most to the morale, welfare and well being of the men and women of the United States Marine Corps.
*In 1966, a memorial was put near the site of her death, with a plaque with the message: &quot;She was one of us and we will miss her.&quot;
*Chapelle is one of the women featured in the documentary film &quot;No Job for a Woman: The Women Who Fought to Report WWII&quot; (2011).
*The Milwaukee Press Club inducted Chapelle into their Hall of Fame in October 2014.
*In 2015, Milwaukee PBS produced a documentary about her titled &quot;Behind the Pearl Earrings: The Story of Dickey Chapelle, Combat Photojournalist.&quot;
*The Marine Corps Combat Correspondents Association posthumously awarded her The Brigadier General Robert L. Denig Sr. Memorial Distinguished Service Award (DSA) in August 2015.

<doc id="1101431" wikidata="Q1414395" url="?curid=1101431" title="Republic of South Maluku">
<text>South Maluku, also South Moluccas and officially the Republic of South Maluku, was an unrecognised secessionist state that claimed the islands of Ambon, Buru, and Seram, which currently make up most of the Indonesian province of Maluku.

Dutch conquest exerted colonial control across the archipelago in the 19th century, establishing a unitary administration. The borders of present-day Indonesia were formed through colonial expansion finalised in the 20th century. After the occupation by the Japanese Empire during World War II ended in 1945, nationalist leaders on Java unilaterally declared Indonesian independence. Early organised indigenous resistance came from the South Moluccas with support and aid from the Dutch government and military. The South Moluccan rebels initially clung on to an early post-colonial treaty prescribing a federal form of statehood. When that treaty, agreed between the Dutch government and the Indonesian government in December 1949, was broken, they unilaterally declared a fully independent &quot;Republic of South Maluku&quot; (RMS) in April 1950. The South Moluccan leaders based their decision on the treaty, which stipulated autonomy for each of the states of the federation.

After the defeat of the RMS on Ambon by Indonesian forces in November 1950, the self-declared government withdrew to Seram, where an armed struggle continued on until 2 December 1963. The government-in-exile moved to the Netherlands in 1966, following resistance leader and president Chris Soumokil&#x27;s capture and execution by Indonesian authorities. The exiled government claimed their continued existence, with John Wattilete as its incumbent president since April 2010. However, unlike the Free Papua Movement, the group has never carried acts of violence against the Indonesian government in the present day. The Republic of South Maluku has been a member state of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization (UNPO) since 1991.

==History==
===Original settlers===
The original settlers of the Moluccan Islands were similar to neighbouring islands like West Papua, East Nusa Tengarra and East Timor. They were ancestors of the Aboriginal Australians, then the ancestors of the Papuans, and lastly the Austronesian settlers from the Philippines by way of Taiwan. Like the rest of what is now Indonesia, the first settlers were Australoid.
Today many Maluku tribes still are ethnically Melanesian and closely represent the original settlers, most of these are what can be considered highlander communities that live in the mountain areas. In contrast, much of the coastal areas have seen a change in the make-up of the population since the original inhabitants have often mixed with the later influx of Austronesian migrations – ultimately causing modern day Moluccans to have a varying degree of Melanesian paternal and Austronesian maternal ancestry. It is widely considered that this area was the place of origin for the Polynesian expansion, and the genetic makeup of the people, cultural and linguistic background, alongside their outrigger canoe (catamaran and trimaran) technology, only further support this.

===European conquest of the South Moluccas===
The Maluku Islands were the only place in the world that grew the prized spices of clove and nutmeg, making it a prime destination for European traders during the Age of Exploration. At one point, cloves were worth their weight in gold, and Portuguese, Spanish, British and Dutch traders all fought to control the incredibly profitable spice trade monopoly. Eventually, the traders of the Dutch East Indies Company (VOC) emerged as the dominant merchant power in Maluku. Through an effective combination of force and diplomacy, the VOC achieved a structure of indirect rule in northern Maluku and direct rule in southern Maluku.

Throughout much of the VOC era (17th and 18th centuries), the south Moluccans resisted Dutch dominance. The Banda Islands were only subdued after the indigenous power structure and organisation of trade and politics was destroyed with the extermination and eviction of the Bandanese population in 1621. To repress the autonomous traders of East Seram, the VOC organised &#x27;Hongi&#x27; raiding expeditions with warrior bands from other south Maluku islands. During &#x27;Hongi&#x27; raids, houses and vessels were burnt, cash crops were uprooted and most wealth was looted by the &#x27;Hongi&#x27; warriors. Survivors who escaped had to start from scratch and, during two centuries of resistance, the East Seramese increasingly suffered impoverishment. However, their independent trading network was never completely destroyed.

From 1780 to 1802, the people of Seram joined an alliance of North Moluccan, Papuan and British forces in a combined revolt. Resistance leader prince Nuku (the exiled Sultan of Tidore) established himself on Seram and aimed at uniting the North and South Moluccas under his leadership. His raiders targeted South Moluccan islands under the Dutch sphere of influence. When the British left the arena in 1802 his plans were foiled and the Dutch restored their dominance.

Maluku islanders staged various rebellions during the Dutch colonisation of the Indonesian archipelago in the 19th century following the collapse of the VOC. In a famous revolt on the south Maluku island Saparua, the Dutch fort was taken by the rebel leader Pattimura, a former sergeant in the army of Britain, who had ruled the islands for a short time before returning them to the Dutch in 1816. After reinforcements were sent from the colonial capital Batavia, the insurgents were captured and Pattimura was executed in 1817.

During the independence movement of Indonesia, Indonesian republicans included South Maluku as part of the independent Indonesia they declared in 1945. Indonesia&#x27;s struggle to secure its independence lasted from 1945 until 1949. After international pressure, the Dutch acknowledged a federal Indonesian republic on 27 December 1949. In the first instance, the Netherlands only acknowledged the independence of Indonesia as a federation of autonomous states, of which one was South Maluku.

On 25 April 1950, demobilised ex-Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL) soldiers and other South Moluccan men who remained loyal to the Dutch crown, staged a revolt and proclaimed an independent &quot;Republic of South Maluku&quot; (Indonesian: &quot;Republik Maluku Selatan&quot;). On 17 August 1950, the Indonesian president, Sukarno, proclaimed the restoration of the unitary state of the Republic of Indonesia. Indonesia&#x27;s liberal democratic system of government, whereby the cabinet would be accountable to the House of Representatives, was retained. This was a source of political instability in the young republic, with frequent changes in government until the rise of the New Order.

===South Moluccan career soldiers of the colonial army===

A relatively large number of the professional soldiers serving in the Royal Dutch East Indies Army (KNIL) were recruited among the population of Ambon and the surrounding South Moluccan islands. The South Moluccan islands were among the first to come under European influence in the 16th century. The Protestant mission had been more successful there than elsewhere in the East Indies; half the Ambonese population adhered to the Calvinist branch of Protestantism.

As early as 1605 armed Dutch merchantmen of the VOC captured the Portuguese fort at the location of Ambon city in the South Moluccas. It was an area already strongly influenced by the Portuguese (Portuguese family names, religion and language were common) and the Dutch developed it into the first secure base of the Dutch East India Company (VOC).
During the era of the VOC, the Moluccans were not only forced to trade with the VOC only, but also to focus solely on the production of cloves. After the downfall of the VOC and the collapse of the trade in cloves, they were fully dependent on the colonial structure and found occupation in the colonial army. The Ambonese were regarded as fierce fighters, reliable soldiers and absolutely loyal to the Dutch Crown. It was precisely this reputation that made them unpopular with other Indonesian nationalities. All of this put them in a difficult position during both the Japanese occupation and the Indonesian national revolution. During the Japanese occupation in the Second World War, most of the Moluccan soldiers were only briefly interned as prisoners of war (POWs). Initially, the Japanese occupation force decided to release them from military duty and send them home. However, the Japanese quickly discovered their miscalculation when the Moluccans became among the most active in the resistance movement against them. Throughout the occupied Dutch East Indies, Moluccan soldiers created underground resistance cells aiding the Allied forces. Some of these cells were active in gathering intelligence; other sleeper cells hid weapons in strategic locations waiting to take up arms during an Allied invasion. The Japanese secret police (Kempeitai) responded by torturing and beheading any suspect, which usually did not deter the Moluccans. 

After the capitulation of the Imperial Japanese Army to the Allied forces, the Moluccan soldiers acted equally defiantly towards the Indonesian revolutionaries trying to fill the power vacuum left by the Japanese. Smaller scale conflicts in the Bersiap period between regrouped Moluccan fighting units and Permuda groups usually left the well-trained Moluccan fighters victorious. In their efforts to subdue the counter revolutionary RMS movement on Ambon, the newly established Tentara Nasional Indonesia (Republican Indonesian army, TNI) encountered the military prowess of the Moluccan special troops. The heavy fighting triggered them to create their own special troops. At that time the Moluccan special troops&#x27; only contemporaries were the Gurkha units of the British Indian Army.

===Disbanding the colonial army===

During the Indonesian National Revolution, the Dutch had to disband the reinstated KNIL, and the native soldiers had the choice of either being demobilised or joining the army of the Republic of Indonesia. Due to a deep distrust of the Republican leadership, which was predominantly Javanese Muslim, this was an extremely difficult choice for the Protestant Ambonese, and only a minority chose to serve with the Indonesian Army. Disbanding proved a complicated process and, in 1951, two years after the transfer of sovereignty, not all soldiers had been demobilised. The Dutch were under severe international pressure to disband the colonial army and temporarily made these men part of the regular Dutch army, while trying to demobilise them in Java. Herein lay the source of the discontent among the Moluccan soldiers as, according to the KNIL policy, soldiers had the right to choose the place where they were to be discharged at the end of their contract. The political situation in the new Republic of Indonesia was initially unstable and, in particular, controversy over a federal or centralised form of the state resulted in armed conflicts in which Ambonese ex-KNIL men were involved. In 1950 an independent Republic of the South Moluccas (Indonesian: RMS, Republik Maluku Selatan) was proclaimed at Ambon. The RMS had strong support among the Ambonese and former Moluccan KNIL soldiers. As a consequence the Moluccan soldiers located outside the South Moluccas demanded to be discharged at Ambon. But Indonesia refused to let the Dutch transport these soldiers to Ambon as long as the RMS was not repressed, fearing prolonged military struggle. When after heavy fighting the RMS was repressed at Ambon, the soldiers refused to be discharged there. They now demanded to be demobilised at Seram, where pockets of resistance against Indonesia still existed. This was again blocked by Indonesia.

===Invasion of Ambon===

At the time of the proclamation, 1,739 KNIL troops, including 1,080 Ambonese, were stationed at Ambon. These soldiers became the backbone of the Armed Forces of RMS (APRMS). After a naval blockade by the Indonesian navy, Federal Indonesia Armed Forces (APRIS) invaded Ambon on 28 September 1950. The APRMS fled from the town of Ambon before the invading Indonesian troops had taken up positions in old Dutch fortifications in the hills overlooking the town. From here they waged guerrilla warfare. The TNI took control of northern half of the island, but were halted by fierce Ambonese resistance at the one-kilometre wide isthmus, which links the southern half. On 5 November, the city of Ambon fell to APRIS. The RMS government went to Ceram in December to continue the RMS battle in the form of a guerrilla war.

===Demobilisation of the Moluccan soldiers to the Netherlands===

The Dutch government finally decided to transport the remaining men and their families to the Netherlands. They were discharged on arrival and &#x27;temporarily&#x27; housed in camps until it was possible for them to return to the Moluccan islands. In this way around 12,500 persons were settled in the Netherlands, more or less against their will and certainly also against the original plans of the Dutch government. The reaction of the Dutch government to the settlement of the Moluccan soldiers was exactly the opposite of the reaction to the Indo repatriates. Whereas the latter were defined as fellow-citizens who had to be integrated as quickly and as fully as possible, the Moluccans were considered to be temporary residents who had to be repatriated to Indonesia. They were &#x27;temporarily&#x27; housed in camps, mostly in rural areas and near small towns. A special agency was set up to manage all matters concerning these temporary residents, the &#x27;Commissariaat Ambonezenzorg&#x27; (CAZ). the camps included the former Nazi transit camp Westerbork.

To deal with all kinds of daily matters the CAZ created &#x27;representatives&#x27; in the camps who regulated the lives of the inhabitants in accordance with the rules. These representatives were (mostly) recruited from among the non-commissioned officers, who were in this way able, to a certain extent, to re-establish their status in the new circumstances. The housing situation in the camps resembled in many ways the barracks of the colonial army, where the soldiers were housed, together with their families, under the direct supervision of non-commissioned officers. This specific housing situation contributed greatly to the isolation of the Moluccan population from Dutch society. The camps, and later the neighbourhoods, became enclaves where the schools, though officially Dutch in programme and language, became exclusively Moluccan and where access to the labour market was geographically often restricted. Even when it became more and more obvious that there was no possibility to repatriate the ex-servicemen to Indonesia, the Dutch government did not formulate a radically different policy.

There was little integration from these camps into the wider Dutch population. The purported government-in-exile was not recognised by the government, but due to Dutch antipathy to Indonesian authorities, did not face serious opposition in its activities. Following the settlement of the West New Guinea dispute in 1963, after which the Netherlands ceded Netherlands New Guinea to Indonesia, Dutch relations with Indonesia improved, and the South Moluccan movement lost support. A small number returned to Indonesia as part of a voluntary repatriation, but some of these returned due to the difficulty of adjusting.
This situation dragged on until 1970 when the CAZ was finally dissolved and normal ministerial and other agencies became responsible. The Dutch government had at last admitted that the Moluccans were not temporary residents and that their future lay in the Netherlands. Still, in 1968 more than 80 per cent of the Moluccans were still without official citizenship, i.e. stateless. The ex-soldiers were deeply frustrated by the demise of the colonial army. The KNIL had offered not only an income, but also a whole way of life in which their status was secure. They had always been loyal to the Dutch Crown and had felt betrayed when their services were no longer rewarded. In response they had pinned their hopes on an independent RMS and had expected that the Dutch would help them to realise it.

These feelings continued and were even strengthened in the years of isolated settlement in the Netherlands. There seemed to be only one worthwhile ideal and that was the creation of the RMS. But whatever the merits of this ideal, the Moluccans in the Netherlands could do nothing to bring its realisation any nearer. Moreover, the isolated situation in the camps and neighbourhoods had given rise to a type of expressive leadership that could only manifest itself in opposing and confronting the CAZ and the Dutch in general.

====South Moluccan terrorist action in the Netherlands====
This situation led to growing tension and to splits within the RMS movement. The older generation of leaders of the RMS movement saw their authority challenged. Finally the crisis in the Ambonese communities exploded in a decade of violence against internal rivals and Dutch society. A series of terrorist attacks started in 1970 with a raid on the residence of the Indonesian ambassador in Wassenaar. The Dutch reaction to this attack was restrained. The attackers received mild sentences and were still seen as misguided idealists. Within the Moluccan community the &#x27;boys of action&#x27; gained great prestige. This fuelled further terrorist actions in 1975 and 1977. As with the attack in Wassenaar, the aims of these actions were not very clear; apart from restoring unity within the RMS movement, it is difficult to see any concrete objectives in the vague rhetoric and impossible political demands made by the attackers. Attacks on a train and on a village school in 1977 led to a final escalation of the violence. The Dutch government saw no other way out than to use military force to end the action. Meanwhile, support for this kind of action within the Moluccan community was ebbing. Instead of reuniting the Moluccans in the Netherlands, this radicalism threatened to lead to more division. When, in 1978, a group of youngsters raided the seat of the provincial government in Assen, they received not the slightest support.

===Second and third generation Moluccans in the Netherlands===

Towards the end of this period of terrorist violence, the Dutch government had already dropped the idea that the Moluccans were temporary residents, but had not been able to create a channel of communication through which to discuss and implement policy measures that opened a way to the future. The social situation left much to be desired; school attainment was low and unemployment high. Earlier attempts to set up a communal platform for the government and Moluccan representatives had not been successful, because of antagonism within the Moluccan communities and impossible political demands made at the outset by the Moluccans. In 1976 a platform was formed where government policy measures could be discussed with representatives of the Moluccan community, the IWM (Dutch abbreviation for: Inspraakorgaan Welzijn Molukkers). In 1978 a substantial White Paper (&quot;De Problematiek van de Molukkers in Nederland&quot;) was sent by the government to parliament. It offered measures to enhance Moluccan participation in Dutch society, in particular in the fields of education and the labour market.

The IWM has proved a valuable communication channel for communal projects. A case in point was the plan to create thousands of jobs for Moluccans in government service. The primary goal was to combat high unemployment, but a secondary goal was to open up a particular section of the labour market where Moluccans were significantly underrepresented. The recognition that employment, education and social welfare in general were important fields where the situation of the Moluccan population, and especially of the new generation, had to be improved, was a positive development. Partly because the second generation was already much more oriented to Dutch society, partly as a result of the policy of affirmative action, participation in the labour market and in the school system developed positively after 1980. Levels of educational attainment rose, unemployment levels were lower and the jobs fulfilled were also somewhat higher in scale. In general the second-generation Moluccans made a great leap forward in this period, compared to the first &#x27;soldier generation&#x27;.

The situation of the Moluccans in the Netherlands is at present remarkably different from that in 1970. Practically all Moluccans are now Dutch citizens. This makes it more difficult to give the precise number of Moluccans in the Netherlands, though research shows that there are to date about 40,000 persons who can be classified as Moluccan. A majority of this population identifies itself to a certain extent with the Moluccan islands where their families once came from, but this identification seems less and less an impediment to integration in Dutch society. In this sense the Moluccans have at last become &#x27;normal immigrants&#x27;.

Notwithstanding Moluccan integration into modern Dutch society has halted terrorist radicalisation, up to the 1990s the Netherlands were reminded yearly of the traumatic side of their colonial past, when celebrations of the RMS independence declaration frequently resulted in angry sentiments or even serious rioting in the streets of the capital.
In the 1950s and 1960s Moluccan musicians made their mark together with artists from the Indo community. In the 1980s, bands like Massada were popular. Massada&#x27;s hit song &quot;Sajang e&quot; is the only song in the Malay language to reach number one in the Netherlands. Also from the South Moluccan community in the Netherlands is the singer songwriter Daniel Sahuleka. In Indonesia, many famous musicians are ethnic Moluccans, like pop star Glenn Fredly, who toured the Netherlands in 2008 and acknowledged Daniel Sahuleka as one of his main inspirations. In the 21st century, new generations of South Moluccans in the Netherlands have chosen ways to manifest their heritage and express themselves, by performing traditional Tifa music and Cakalele dances, but also by expressing themselves with contemporary music like hip-hop. In addition, in Dutch football many South Moluccans in the Netherlands have made names for themselves, including Simon Tahamata and Bobby Petta, as well as Denny Landzaat and Giovanni van Bronckhorst, whose mothers are Moluccan.

==21st century==
===Events in the Netherlands===
The Indonesian ambassador to the Netherlands, Yunus Effendi Habibie, told Radio Netherlands Worldwide in 2009 that Indonesia was pleased that the exiled Moluccan government is no longer striving for an independent state. According to the ambassador, Moluccans already have autonomy, so the present situation need not be changed. He rejects full Moluccan independence. Habibie&#x27;s comments come in response to a decision by the designated new president of the Moluccan government-in-exile, John Wattilete&#x27;s words that an independent Moluccan state is no longer its absolute priority. Although independence is still the ultimate goal, he says he would be satisfied with a form of autonomy similar to that introduced in Aceh. &quot;The most important thing is that Moluccans themselves are in charge.&quot;

John Wattilete became RMS president in April 2010. He is the first to come from the second generation of Moluccans in the Netherlands and is regarded as more pragmatic than previous leaders. However one day before Indonesian President Yudhoyono&#x27;s planned state visit to the Netherlands, the first such visit since 1970, Wattilete issued legal proceedings to have him arrested upon entering the country. Although legal experts called this action senseless and without much chance of success, Yudhoyono cancelled his visit the next day.

===Events in Indonesia===
The South Moluccan people are predominantly Christian, unlike most regions in Indonesia which are overwhelmingly Muslim. The South Moluccan Republic, however, was also supported by some Moluccan Muslims in the region at that time. Today the memory of the RMS and its separatist objectives still resonates in Indonesia. Moluccan Christians, during the sectarian violence of 1999–2002 in the Moluccas, were accused by Muslim groups of having independence as their goal. This accusation has been useful in galvanising Muslims to fight (Laskar Jihad), and the situation has not been aided by the fact that some diaspora Moluccan Christian groups have taken up the RMS banner.

In the Moluccas, the Malino II Accord was signed to end conflict and create peace in the Moluccas, asking Moluccans &quot;to reject and oppose all kinds of separatist movements, among others the Republic of South Moluccas (RMS), that threaten the unity and sovereignty of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia&quot;. However, during the visit to Ambon of the Indonesian president in the summer of 2007, RMS sympathisers disturbed ceremonies by performing the Moluccan war dance and hoisting the RMS flag.

Since 1999, a new organisation known as the Maluku Sovereignty Front (FKM) has operated in Ambon, stockpiling weapons and flying the RMS flag in public places. The leader of the FKM organisation, Alex Manuputty, has fled to the United States, but continues to support independence.

On 26 October 2020, three activists were jailed for three years after being charged with treason for flying the RMS flag.

On 9 May 2024, a teenager named Khoider Ali Ringirfuryaan alias &quot;Dede&quot; who was 15 years old was detained by Maluku Regional Police for carrying the &quot;Benang Raja&quot; flag of the Republic of South Maluku during the watch together () play-off match 2024 Paris Olympics between Indonesia U23 against Guinea U23 at Merdeka Field, Ambon. This sparked controversy in Indonesia, especially in Maluku Province and the Moluccans community in the Netherlands. The Government of the Republic of South Maluku through its official Instagram account expressed its concern over the arrest of a 15 year old teenager and condemned the Government of Indonesia.

==Exile==
The main stronghold of the rebellious RMS group on Ambon was defeated by Indonesian forces in November 1950, while a smaller scale guerrilla struggle continued on Ceram until 1962. The defeat on Ambon however resulted in the flight of the self-declared RMS government from the islands, and the formation of a government in exile in the Netherlands. The following year some 12,000 Moluccan soldiers accompanied by their families went to the Netherlands, where they established a &quot;Republic of the South Moluccas&quot; government-in-exile.

During their exile parts of the RMS movement have committed terror attacks in the Netherlands. Most research argues that the attacks were caused by frustration over the lack of support from the Dutch government.

The first attack took place in 1970 at the Indonesian Ambassador&#x27;s house at Wassenaar, during which a Dutch policeman was shot and killed. This attack was followed up in 1975 with the hijacking of a train at Wijster which was spontaneously supported by another, improvised, attack on the Indonesian consulate in Amsterdam. Three hostages were executed in the train and one Indonesian man was mortally wounded while trying to escape the consulate. In 1977 another train was hijacked, this time at De Punt, supported by a primary school hijack at Bovensmilde. These actions were ended with force by marines of the Bijzondere Bijstands Eenheid (BBE) in which six hijackers and two hostages died. The last action took place in 1978 when the provincial building in Assen was occupied. This action too was ended by BBE marines.

From the 1980s no such actions re-occurred.

Junus Effendi Habibie, the previous Indonesian ambassador to the Netherlands and brother to the third president of Indonesia, has said that he would do all he can to facilitate the repatriation of first generation Moluccans to their homeland, if they would stop aiming at an independent state.

==Presidents==
Chris Soumokil was the RMS president in 1954 who went into hiding and led the armed guerrilla struggle on Seram island. He was only captured by the Indonesian Army in Ceram on 2 December 1962. Brought to trial before a military tribunal in Jakarta, he was sentenced to death and executed under President Suharto&#x27;s rule on 12 April 1966.

The first president in exile was Johan Manusama (1966–1993).

The government-in-exile continues to exist, with Frans Tutuhatunewa as head of state (1993–2010). However it no longer advocates violent action towards either the Netherlands or Indonesia. The president in exile has said that the young generations should focus on their education and development opportunities in the Netherlands if they want to potentially support and develop the South Moluccas.

John Wattilete became RMS president in April 2010. He is the first to come from the second generation of Moluccans in the Netherlands and is regarded as more pragmatic than previous leaders.

==State symbols==
===Flag===
The RMS flag is vertical blue, white, green, red (1:1:1:6) and has proportions 2:3. It was first hoisted 2 May 1950 at 10.00 AM. Two days later the government gave the explanation of the flag. Blue symbolises the sea and loyalty, white stands for purity, peace and the white beaches, green the vegetation, and red the ancestors and blood of the people.
===Coat of arms===
The RMS coat of arms depicts the white Moluccan dove called &#x27;Pombo&#x27;. The white dove is seen as a symbol of positivity and a good omen. The &#x27;Pombo&#x27; is shown, about to start flying, the wings half opened and in its beak a peace branch, the chest tattooed with a crossed &#x27;parang&#x27;, &#x27;salawaku&#x27; and spear.

The blazon of the RMS coat of arms state the words &#x27;Mena – Moeria&#x27;. This slogan is derived from the original Melanesian Moluccan language. Since ancient times it is yelled by the steerer and paddlers of the traditional Moluccan rowing boats called &#x27;Kora Kora&#x27;, to synchronise their strokes during off shore expeditions. It literally means &#x27;Front – Back&#x27;, but is also translated as &#x27;I go – We follow&#x27; or &#x27;One for all – All for One&#x27;.

===Anthem===
The RMS anthem is called &quot;Maluku, Tanah Airku,&quot; which translates to English as &quot;Maluku, My Homeland.&quot; The anthem was written by Chris Soumokil and O. Sahalessy in the Malay language, with Melanesian Moluccan words mixed in.
Original text
&lt;poem&gt;Oh Maluku, tanah airku,
Tanah tumpah darahku.
Ku berbakti kepadamu
Slama hari hidupku.
Engkaulah pusaka raya
Yang leluhur dan teguh.
Aku junjung selamanya
Hingga sampai ajalku.
Aku ingat terlebih
Sejarahmu yang pedih.

Oh Maluku, tanah airku,
Tanah datuk-datukku.
Atas via dolorosa
Engkau hidup merdeka.
Putra-putri yang sejati
Tumpah darah bagimu.
Ku bersumpah trus berbakti
Serta tanggung nasibmu.
Aku lindung terlebih
Sejarahmu yang pedih.

Mena-Muria, printah leluhur
Segenap jiwaku seru.
Bersegralah membelamu
Seperti laskar yang jujur.
Dengan prisai dan imanku
Behkan harap yang teguh.
Ku berkurban dan berasa
Karena dikaa ibuku
Ku doakan terlebih
Mena-Muria, hiduplah!&lt;/poem&gt;
English translation
&lt;poem&gt;Maluku, my homeland,
My land of origin.
I devote my strength to thee
As long as I may live.
Thou art my great heritage
Uplifted above all.
I will always honour thee
Until my dying day.
I will recall in memory
Above all thy harrowing history.

Maluku, my homeland,
Land of my ancestors.
Through this road of suffering
Will we reach liberty.
Thy true sons and daughters
Have shed their blood for thee.
I am sworn to dedication
To keep thy future safe.
Above all I will protect thee
And thy harrowing history.

Onwards without fear, the higher call
I yell wholeheartedly.
I hasten to defend thee
As an army just and true.
With shield and faith
And above all in great resilience
I will sacrifice and struggle.
For thou art my cradle
And above all I will pray
That our sacred call may forever live.&lt;/poem&gt;

<text>Chicago Coalition Against War &amp; Racism (CCAWR) was formed in September 2001 to protest the imminent United States invasion of Afghanistan. As of 2018, they had changed their name to Chicago Committee Against War and Racism. CCAWR gained a foothold in Chicago street politics and rose to prominence when it organized a rally at Federal Plaza the day after the U.S. invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003. 

==Activism and protests==
During the March 20 protest, about 10,000 Chicagoans marched and took over Lake Shore Drive in a direct action that led to national news. The Chicago Police Department reported that 543 people were arrested in the protest and that 353 of them were charged, mainly with reckless behavior. In April 2003, as a result of those arrests, the Chicago chapter of the National Lawyers Guild filed a class action lawsuit against the city and the police department for what it claimed was the &quot;unlawful arrest and imprisonment of hundreds of people&quot;. The lawsuit alleged that the police used illegal tactics like &quot;herding, sweeping and pinning&quot; of the bystanders and protesters. The city agreed to pay $6.2 million to the arrested protesters to settle the lawsuit.

In 2002, they were part of a protest at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, against &quot;Israel&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians&quot; and the local police department who had questioned at least three Arabs. On the 8th anniversary of the U.S. war and occupation of Iraq, the CCAWR was part of 1500 protesters who were demonstrating against the U.S. military getting involved in Libya. The group was one of the main organizers that arranged protests during the 2012 Chicago summit, a meeting that included heads of state and heads of government of NATO. Thousands of protesters showed up to express their opposition to NATO. 

In 2018, on the 50th anniversary of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago, the CCAWR organized a protest on a wide range of issues, like the wars in the Middle East to the &quot;funding of the military at the expense of public services&quot;. In 2021, members of the organization demonstrated at Federal Plaza, &quot;demanding the Biden administration move forward with policies that will end the war in Yemen during his first 100 days in office&quot;.

<text>Wilrijk (; former, original spelling: &quot;Wilrijck&quot;) is a district of the municipality and city of Antwerp in the Belgian province of Antwerp. Wilrijk had been a separate municipality before January 1, 1983; the enlarged municipality of Antwerp was decentralized in 2000 and Wilrijk became one of the city&#x27;s nine districts.

This suburb is also known as the Goat village, because of its Goat parade. Every five years, this parade attracts many tourists. The next one will be held in 2025.

==Overview==
Although it is now part of the city of Antwerp, Wilrijk has kept its own distinct atmosphere. A mixture of modern and older neighbourhoods, this suburb has a good balance between residential, commercial and industrial activities. Its facilities for sport and recreation in a green environment make it a desirable area in which to live.

This area was already inhabited in 600 BC. This has been shown by the excavation of a Celtic burial site in Wilrijk, which is the oldest sign of civilization yet discovered in the region around Antwerp.

==Demography==
The total area of Wilrijk is 13.61 km2 and it has 38,220 inhabitants (2004).

==Evolution of the population size==

===19th century===
===20th century until fusion with Antwerp===
==History==

===From a Celtic settlement to a modern suburb===
Probably the first time people lived in this area was around 600 BC. In 1003 the first document appeared in which the name uuilrika was mentioned. This document tells about the existence in 743 AD of a community living around the central square in Wilrijk which is called &quot;Bist&quot;. The triangular shape of the &quot;Bist&quot; shows the Frankish past of Wilrijk.
One of the current theories is that the name &quot;Wilrijk&quot; is actually derived from the Gallo-Roman word Villariacum (meaning: &quot;Part of the domain of a Roman villa&quot;). Evidence for the existence of a Roman villa was found in a nearby village Kontich.

After the closing of the Zwyn and the decay of Bruges, the city of Antwerp became of more importance. At the end of the 15th century the foreign trading guilds moved from the city of Bruges to Antwerp. These &quot;foreigners&quot; were well received by the families of Antwerp. Some of the richer people from Antwerp escaped their busy lives in the center of the city and, attracted by the rural character of Wilrijk (and other towns surrounding Antwerp), started building large houses (little castles) there. These houses are called &quot;Hoven van plaisantie&quot;, some of these still exist even today: Klaverblad, Schoonselhof, Ieperman, Steytelinck, Middelheim, De Brandt, Hof Ter Beke. Others didn&#x27;t survive: Jezuietenhof, Ooievaarsnest (Oversnes), Hoonsnest (Hondsnest of Hof van Van Dael), Groenenborgerhof, Elsdonkhof, Standonk, Korenbloem. But their names still remain in the consciousness of the people living in Wilrijk through names of streets and neighbourhoods.

On November 30, 1589 the village was completely burned by some Geuzen coming from Bergen op Zoom. It took Wilrijk 20 years to start rebuilding the houses, and in that time the population had to live in poor wooden huts.

In the middle of the 18th century an important road was built between Antwerp and Boom. Because of the expansion of Antwerp some suburbs (Kiel and Beerschot) that were a large source of food products for Antwerp, started to get too crowded. Their function was taken over by the farmers in Wilrijk and they started delivering milk, vegetables and flowers to Antwerp.

On October 6, 1819 Wilrijk received its own coat of arms from King William I of the Netherlands and the Hoge Raad van Adel. It consists of a picture of Saint Bavo as a knight on a blue background, with a falcon in his left hand and a sword in his right; the right corner contains an image of the Saint Bavo church in Wilrijk.

In the second half of the 19th century the town started to change because of the construction of two forts in the neighbourhood of Wilrijk (Fort 6 and 7) (1859–1865). These were part of a whole array of 8 forts protecting the city of Antwerp. At the same time some important connections were built between these fortifications, leading to new roads and railroads in Wilrijk and even a railway station.

Mayor M. Willems(1863–1870) started the planning of a new town hall. The architect of the province of Antwerp Eugeen Gife was given the task to design this new building, but it was the next mayor Jules Moretus (1870–1874) who would see the actual start of the construction. The town hall was finished in 1873, some changes were made to it in 1920, 1936, 1952, 1963, 1970 and 1977. Since 1994 it is officially protected as a monument.

Until the 19th century Wilrijk had stayed a rural, quite poor community independent of Antwerp. From then on many of the inhabitants started to search for work in the center of Antwerp, and Wilrijk flourished. In 1810 Wilrijk had 1660 inhabitants, this increased in 1840 to 2275, and in 1875 it were already 3553, to become 6243 in 1900. It was a slow evolution, and Wilrijk evolved from a rural village into a small suburb.

In the 20th century some of the &quot;Hoven van plaisantie&quot; were demolished, and their large surrounding parks were used to construct new housing projects. The primary goal was to create new urban areas after the First World War. The first new immigrants were mostly people moving from the city to the fresh air in the suburbs. Some of Wilrijk&#x27;s districts that were created in this way are Eenheid, Elsdonk, and Valaar.

===Wilrijk as a suburban town===
When the population exceeded 20,000 inhabitants in 1928, the town acquired the &quot;Hof van plaisantie&quot; Steytelinck. From then on, Wilrijk had its own public park, close to the center.

During the Second World War, Wilrijk suffered a lot because of bombardments by the Germans with the V1 and V2. 71 civilians were killed by as much as 65 bombs.

After the war Wilrijk again started to grow rapidly. The agricultural character disappeared and was replaced by industry. Again many people migrated from the center of Antwerp to the suburbs. This time also the first high buildings appeared in Wilrijk. The population peaked. In 1950, 27,213 inhabitants, in 1956 30,000 and in 1964, 40,000. On January 1, 1975 the number of inhabitants was officially 44,219, from this day, the population decreased steadily.

In 1960 the town council decided to renew the town center. This urbanistic project included some high buildings, a shopping center and a cultural center. It was agreed to create a large industrial area of 1.5 km2 next to the important economical axes Antwerp-Boom (Boomsesteenweg (A12)). More than 6000 people are employed in this area right now.

Because of the increase in traffic the Boomsesteenweg (A12) was modernised in 1958 (also because of the Expo &#x27;58 in Brussels). In 1978 the highway Antwerp-Brussels (E10, now called E19) and the R11 were constructed, further dividing Wilrijk into different parts. The communal road network was more than 200 km.

Until then Wilrijk had been an independent town with its own town council and mayor, but this was about to change.

===Wilrijk as part of Antwerp===
On January 1, 1983 Wilrijk became, together with seven other communities – Antwerp, Berchem, Borgerhout, Ekeren, Hoboken, Merksem and Deurne – part of one big city of Antwerp, now a city with more than 500,000 inhabitants. All the former towns became &quot;districten (in Dutch)&quot; of Antwerp. Many city services were centralised and the town (district) council lost almost all of its powers. Every district kept its own &quot;districtshuis&quot; (former town hall) with services like: information, social affaires, registry of births, deaths and marriages, etc.

However, this move to a centralised administration created some resistance among the inhabitants. In a gesture &quot;to bring the government back to the civilians&quot; a decentralisation was started on January 1, 2001. Some of the powers reverted to the districts, including: the &quot;look&quot; of the town, youth policy, festivities, sports and communication.

==Lange Wapper==
Lange Wapper is a mythical being appearing in many folk tales in Flanders. According to belief (especially from people living in Wilrijk) Lange Wapper was born in Wilrijk, near the Hoven van plaisantie De Brandt and Middelheim on the fields of farmer Peer-January. One day he found a huge red cabbage between his vegetables. He touched it, and found out that it was actually a newborn. Because he was too poor to raise the child, it was adopted by a family from Antwerp. The boy grew up, and he became known as someone who always protected the helpless. One day he saved an old lady from drowning and she gave him the gift to make himself very tall or very small whenever he liked it. This is how he got his name Lange (Long) Wapper. Since he always protected people he got some respect, but he also made some strange noises, sounding like a goat, and that&#x27;s why he also became known as a water devil.

Since people in Wilrijk wanted to make sure the entire world would believe that Lange Wapper really was theirs, they organised a great party in 1964 to baptise an 8 meter long giant, Lange Wapper, with beer in the presence of a monk from Deerlijk. After that the giant was officially made an inhabitant (&quot;honoris causa&quot;) of Wilrijk by mayor Kiebooms. This, of course, created only more discussion between the center of Antwerp and Wilrijk about who actually &quot;owned&quot; Lange Wapper.

He is one of the main figures of the Goat parade in Wilrijk.

==Cultural activities==

===Goat parade (Geitestoet)===

In the period that Wilrijk was still a poor town, many people kept a little goat at home, to provide meat and milk if needed. Because of this, the richer people were laughing with the silly people from Wilrijk with their goats. When in 1895 there was an election for the town council, there was a big election fight between the Catholic and the liberal parties. The liberals accused the Catholics of fraud, and because the people of Wilrijk didn&#x27;t want to listen to them, they called them &#x27;Goat heads&#x27;(Geitekoppen(Dutch language)). From this time on, Wilrijk was known as the &#x27;Goat town&#x27;. As with many of these names, after a while it become a title of honor for people living in Wilrijk. So, when in 1965 Wilrijk celebrated its 1200-year existence, the people organised a &#x27;Goat parade&#x27;, consisting of decorated carts, people wearing costumes and of course...goats. There was also a cart showing Lange Wapper.

After the fusion with Antwerp in 1983, people became nostalgic and examined their common past. Plans were made to organize a new Goat parade, which, after 25 years, resumed on September 16, 1990. Since then, a Goat parade is organised every five years (1995, 2000, 2005). The last one featured: 1500 participants in special costumes, 10 groups of dancers, 12 decorated carts, 16 groups of musicians, giants, coaches, horses, ... and a record breaking number of goats.

===Annual fair (Jaarmarkt)===
In many towns there is an ancient custom to have an Annual Fair to create an opportunity for farmers to show and trade their livestock. All the farmers in the region come to the town with the livestock or other goods they want to sell. Over time this has evolved in a larger cultural event. This annual fair is still held every year in Wilrijk in August. It consists of a weekend during which a large number of activities are organised: a painters competition, an old-timer rally, a funfair and art exhibitions. In the streets surrounding the town hall you can find farmers showing their animals (goats, horses, cows and other livestock) and there are also competitions to decide which farmers have the best animals.

<text>Clann na Talmhan (, &quot;Family/Children of the land&quot;; formally known as the &quot;National Agricultural Party&quot;) was an Irish agrarian political party active between 1939 and 1965.

==Formation and growth==

Clann na Talmhan was founded on 29 June 1939 in Athenry, County Galway, in the wake of the breakdown of unification talks between the Irish Farmers Federation (IFF) and representatives of farmers in Connacht on the rate-paying issue. While the IFF supported full derating, the western view was that the largest farmers should not be relieved of all their rate-paying obligations. Were this to happen, the western opinion was that indirect taxation would inevitably increase, and small farmers and workers would find themselves appreciably worse-off.

The party was led initially by Galway farmer Michael Donnellan. Its foundation represented a revival of agrarian politics in Ireland; from 1922 to 1933 a series of parties had represented farming interests, namely the Farmers&#x27; Party and the National Centre Party. However, these groups mostly attracted large farmers in the east. In contrast, Clann na Talmhan appealed explicitly to the more numerous small farmers of the west of Ireland. The party&#x27;s objectives included the promotion of the interests of small farmers, government support for land reclamation, lowering of taxes on farmland, a more progressive system of land rates that would help small farmers, and more intensive afforestation. During the 1940s it began to adopt social democratic policies. It supported free secondary education and subsidised university education, as well as state investment in a public healthcare system. The party also had a distinct populist streak, pushing back against establishment politicians, bankers and the wealthy in Irish society. In 1942 at a rally in Dunmore, County Galway Michael Donnellan declared &quot;You could take all the TDs, all the senators, all the ministers and members of the judiciary and all the other nice fellows and dump them off Clare Island into the broad Atlantic. Still, Ireland would succeed. But without the workers and producers, the country would starve in twenty-four hours&quot;.

In contrast to the earlier Farmers&#x27; Party, Clann na Talmhan emphasised grass-roots campaigning and political agitation. It also developed an efficient electoral machine, largely owing to the advice and skills it gained from former members of Fianna Fáil. Although the party was hindered to a degree by wartime restrictions on public meetings and the press, it did have five years to prepare for its first election.

In 1943, Clann na Talmhan merged with the National Agricultural Party a rival political party setup in Leinster to represent the large farmers there, with the belief that the merger was needed in order to contest the upcoming 1943 general election. The unified party won ten seats in that election and nine at the 1944 general election. However, the merger of the two groups brought a great deal of instability as infighting between the small farmers from Connacht and the large farmers from Leinsters divided the party members. In light of this Donnellan resigned as leader following the election and was replaced by Joseph Blowick, a large farmer holder from County Mayo.

==In government and decline==
The party was one of five parties in the first inter-party government (1948–1951), with Blowick serving as Minister for Lands and Donnellan becoming a Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance. Clann na Talmhan was one of three parties in the second inter-party government (1954–1957), with Blowick and Donnellan reprising their ministerial roles. However, this period saw a retrenchment rather than expansion of the party, which did not expand its support beyond western and southern small farmers. Like its spiritual predecessors, Clann na Talmhan could not unite small and large farmers in one party, and this restricted its electoral appeal.

The party began to lose its position after its spells in government. A lack of improvement in the economy during this period led to disillusionment with Clann na Talmhan, and people again began to vote for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael rather than small parties. During the 1950s many activists had departed, and the party became little more than a collection of personal electoral machines. By 1961, Donnellan and Blowick were the only party TDs remaining, and the party ceased to exist as an organisation independent of those men. When Donnellan died in 1964 his son John Donnellan was elected in his place, but for Fine Gael rather than his father&#x27;s party. Blowick decided not to contest the 1965 general election, and Clann na Talmhan was formally wound up.

<doc id="1101442" wikidata="Q3480369" url="?curid=1101442" title="Alan Aldridge">
<text>Alan Aldridge (8 July 1938 – 17 February 2017) was a British artist, graphic designer and illustrator. He is best known for his psychedelic artwork made for books and record covers by The Beatles and The Who. His bold, surreal, and colorful style was unique and different compared to the more restrained &#x27;Swiss style&#x27; during his time.

==Personal life==

Aldridge was born in North London but moved and lived in Los Angeles, California in the 1980s, searching for opportunities in film and design. On 17 February 2017, his death was announced via Instagram.

When he died, he left behind 8 children: fashion photographer Miles Aldridge, model and social activist Saffron Aldridge and Marc from his first marriage to Rita Farthing; two sons, Pim and Toby, from a relationship with Andrea Gayler; and two daughters, models Lily Aldridge and Ruby Aldridge, and a son, James, from his second marriage to Laura Lyons, which also ended in divorce. He was given 11 grandchildren. 

One of his important but unfinished projects was &quot;The Gnole&quot;, a fantasy novel he wrote which was later picked up for a potential film adaptation. Although the movie was never produced, it remains as one of his notable creative works.

==Career==

Aldridge first worked as an illustrator at &quot;The Sunday Times Magazine&quot;. After doing some freelance book covers for Penguin Books, he was hired in March 1965 by Penguin&#x27;s chief editor Tony Godwin to become the art director of Penguin. Over the next two years as art director, he especially focused on science fiction book covers and introduced his style which resonated with the mood of the time. In 1968 he moved to his own graphic-design firm, INK, which became closely involved with graphic images for the Beatles and Apple Corps.

During the 1960s and 1970s, he was responsible for a great many album covers, and helped create the graphic style of that era. He designed a series of science fiction book covers for Penguin Books. He made a big impression with his illustrations for the book &quot;The Beatles Illustrated Lyrics&quot;. He also provided illustrations for &quot;The Penguin Book of Comics&quot;, a history of British and American comic art. His work was characterised by a flowing, cartoony style and soft airbrushing – very much in step with the psychedelic styles of the times. His work includes the 1971 anti-war poster entitled &quot;A great place for hamburgers but who&#x27;d want to live there!&quot;

In February 1969, Aldridge designed the graphics for the controversial Jane Arden play &quot;Vagina Rex and the Gas Oven&quot; at the London Arts Laboratory, Drury Lane.

Aldridge is possibly best known for the picture book &quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper Feast&quot; (1973), a series of illustrations of anthropomorphic insects and other creatures, which he created in collaboration with Harry Willock. William Plomer wrote the accompanying verses. This was based on William Roscoe&#x27;s poem of the same name, but was inspired when Aldridge read that John Tenniel had told Lewis Carroll it was impossible to draw a wasp in a wig.

Aldridge created the artwork for Elton John&#x27;s 1975 album &quot;Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy&quot;. In 1977, he created an advertisement illustration for the Dutch beer brand Heineken. He was the creator of the &quot;Hard Rock Café&quot; logo.

==Honours and awards==

A retrospective &quot;Alan Aldridge – the Man with the Kaleidoscope Eyes&quot; featured at the Design Museum in London from 10 October 2008 to 25 January 2009, and was reviewed as &quot;The trip of a lifetime&quot;.

Over the years Aldridge won many awards for his work, among them Whitbread Children&#x27;s Book Award (1973).

<doc id="1101446" wikidata="Q1209979" url="?curid=1101446" title="Curdling">
<text>Curdling is the breaking of an emulsion or colloid into large parts of different composition through the physio-chemical processes of flocculation, creaming, and coalescence. Curdling is purposeful in the production of cheese curd and tofu; undesirable in the production of a sauce, cheese fondue or a custard.

== Method ==
In curdling, the pH of the milk decreases and becomes more acidic. Independently floating casein molecules attract one another, forming &quot;curdles&quot; that float in a translucent whey. At warmer temperatures, the clumping reaction occurs more quickly than at colder temperature. Curdling occurs naturally if cows&#x27; milk is left open in a warm environment to air for a few days.

== Cheese and tofu ==


Milk and soy milk are curdled intentionally to make cheese and tofu by the addition of enzymes (typically rennet), acids (including lemon juice), or various salts (magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, or gypsum); the resulting curds are then pressed.

== Egg sauces ==

In hot preparations emulsified with eggs like hollandaise and custard, curdling is the undesirable result of overheating the sauce. Sauces which contain starch curdle with more difficulty.

In cold sauces like mayonnaise as well as in hot sauces, too large a ratio of fat to egg may also cause curdling.

== Milk sauces ==
In sauces which include milk or yogurt, overheating often causes curdling. The higher the fat content, the less likely curdling is. Strained yogurt used in sauces also curdles only with difficulty.

==Coffee==

When a plant based milk such as soya milk is added to coffee, curdling can sometimes occur. To help prevent this manufacturers sometimes add acidity regulators.

== Cheesecake ==
When making cheesecake, if water is added to the cream cheese during the combining period, it will curdle.

<doc id="1101450" wikidata="Q846660" url="?curid=1101450" title="Treo 650">
<text>The Palm Treo 650 is a Palm OS-based smartphone, the successor to Palm&#x27;s Treo 600. It began shipping in November 2004, and was discontinued in 2008.

==Specifications==
=== Carriers ===

The following GSM and CDMA2000 mobile phone operators currently or previously offered a custom-branded (OEM) version of the Treo 650:

In release order
*Sprint PCS (USA)
*Cellular South
*Cingular Wireless (including AT&amp;T Wireless customers) (USA)
*Unlocked GSM
*Rogers Wireless (Canada)
*Verizon Wireless (USA)
*Earthlink Wireless (USA)
*Bell Mobility (Canada)
*Telus Mobility (Canada)
*Alltel (USA)
*Centennial Wireless (USA)

As seen on Palm&#x27;s support page, these carriers are the sole providers of support for the OEM phones.

=== Other carriers ===

Nextel (USA) and other iDEN providers are not compatible with the Treo 650, as this technology has not been integrated into the Treo platform. T-Mobile (USA) and other GSM carriers not listed above are compatible with the unlocked version of the GSM Treo 650.

== NVFS controversy ==

At the time of its release, a significant number of users experienced problems with Palm&#x27;s new Non-Volatile File System, or NVFS, based on the FAT filesystem. Compared to the Treo 600, the previous version of the Treo, the Treo 650 used more memory per file as the FAT filesystem rounded file sizes to the next highest 512-byte multiple. Because of the larger file sizes, some users upgrading to the Treo 650 from the Treo 600 were unable to fit the contents of their old device into the same amount of memory on the new device.

To remedy the initial complaints, Palm offered a free 128 MB SD flash card to Treo 650 users. Later ROM updates have resolved many of the performance, instability and storage inefficiency issues.

Other main concerns surrounding the Treo 650 (during its initial release period) were as follows:

* Some users experienced random resets at one time or another. Although the cause was unknown, a complete reset via the Reset button on the back of the phone under the battery door could keep the phone stable and running most of the day.
* Some users also reported problems with the unit&#x27;s microphone. They claimed that voice clarity on the recipient&#x27;s end of the connection was poor, akin to talking &quot;inside a cardboard box.&quot; (koreth, Slashdot). Users have found that bluetooth-enabled wireless headsets or fixed headsets seemed to be an effective work-around.
* Another problem people reported is that the handset&#x27;s earpiece made it difficult to hear in loud environments. Using a bluetooth-enabled wireless headset would also take care of this problem.
* Further issues include static or buzzing in the background of a conversation, the recipient&#x27;s voice sounding buzzy as if they were speaking through a kazoo, and the phone failing to notify the user that a text message was received until the user activated the phone&#x27;s screen at which point the phone would place a false timestamp on the message and act as if it had just been received.

=== Firmware solutions ===

On March 22, 2005, palmOne released the first ROM/Firmware Update (v1.12) for Sprint-branded phones which alleviated the NVFS inefficiency, random resets and the microphone problems. This was followed by a second firmware update on June 16, 2005. The Unlocked GSM Firmware Upgrade (v1.13) was also released on the day of the second Sprint Treo 650 firmware update which also addresses the problems first fixed with the first Sprint Treo 650 firmware update. The Rogers Wireless Treo 650 Firmware Update was quietly posted at the Rogers Wireless Treo 650 support site, and like the Unlocked GSM Firmware Update, fixes the main concerns during the initial release period. The initial release of the Verizon Wireless Treo 650 and the Earthlink Wireless Treo 650 already has the main concerns assessed, including the NVFS Memory System fix. On July 19, 2005, the Verizon Wireless firmware update was released. On July 25, 2005, Cingular released firmware version 1.15, and updated to 1.17 on November 21. 
Unlocked GSM 1.20 was released Mar 2006.

The latest (and last) GSM firmware revision is 01.71 (released 2006), with 01.31 released late 2005.

Treo 650 users are encouraged to deploy the latest version of the Treo 650 firmware available for their radio type (GSM or CDMA2000) and carrier branding.

==Special Editions==

Two special editions existed of the Treo 650, the first a &quot;special colour edition&quot; released in 2006 with spare battery and PalmOne 256MB Card included, this apparently targeted the Japanese market with extra Language functionality available in the preferences menu.

The second was named the &quot;Black tie&quot; limited edition targeting the Asia/Pacific region, released in 2006 and limited to 2000 units, an all black Silicone coated device celebrating 10 years of Palm, these also carried the &quot;Palm&quot; as opposed to the &quot;PalmOne&quot; logo. The &quot;Black Tie&quot; came with a &quot;multi-function&quot; stylus and a Hard case..

Both however had identical hardware functionality with the original.

==Treo Ace==

The Treo Ace was the rumored code name for PalmOne&#x27;s Treo 650 smartphone introduced at the October 2004 CTIA Conference in San Francisco. The rumors for this product began on June 27, 2004, when TreoCentral posted detailed specifications and mockup drawings for the product. That article started the flow of hyped demand and interest for the Treo&#x27;s launch that fall 

The current firmware updates for the device contain a directory by the name of Ace_Update, confirming the original internal code name. A string inside the Bluetooth driver file indicates that another internal code name may have been &quot;Ace Ventura&quot;, a reference to the movie of the same name.

==Linux==

The Treo 650 can boot Linux using a SD card and the cocoboot application.

==Successor Palm OS products==

The Treo 650 was superseded by the Treo 755p (CDMA2000), and the Treo 680 (GSM).

<doc id="1101461" wikidata="Q506198" url="?curid=1101461" title="Henry Thomas">
<text>Henry Jackson Thomas (born September 9, 1971) is an American actor. He began his career as a child actor and had the lead role of Elliott Taylor in the film &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982), for which he won a Young Artist Award and received Golden Globe Award, BAFTA Award, and Saturn Award nominations. Thomas also had roles in other films, including &quot;Cloak &amp; Dagger&quot; (1984), &quot;Valmont&quot; (1989), &quot;Fire in the Sky&quot; (1993), &quot;Legends of the Fall&quot; (1994), &quot;Suicide Kings&quot; (1997), &quot;All the Pretty Horses&quot; (2000), &quot;Gangs of New York&quot; (2002), &quot;11:14&quot; (2003), and &quot;Dear John&quot; (2010). Thomas was nominated for the Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor – Series, Miniseries or Television Film for his role in the television film &quot;&quot; (1997).

More recently, Thomas collaborated with filmmaker Mike Flanagan, appearing in the films &quot;&quot; (2016), &quot;Gerald&#x27;s Game&quot; (2017) and &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot; (2019) as well as the television series &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot; (2018) (which earned him a Saturn Award) and its follow-up series &quot;The Haunting of Bly Manor&quot; (2020). In 2021, he had a main role in Flanagan&#x27;s horror series &quot;Midnight Mass&quot;, and, in 2023, he starred as one of the Usher siblings in &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot; (2023), also by Flanagan.

== Early life ==
Thomas was born in San Antonio, Texas. He attended East Central High School and Blinn College.

During a 2018 interview with Lorraine Kelly, he commented on his strong connections to Wales, confirming that &quot;Both my mother and father&#x27;s family come from Wales - north and south&quot;. In the same interview, he also stated that he was a fan of Swansea City A.F.C.. 

== Career ==
=== Acting ===
Thomas struggled with the popularity he gained in the months following the 1982 release of &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot;. In November 2019, Thomas reprised his role as Elliott for an Xfinity &amp; Sky UK commercial, in which E.T. returns to visit a now-adult Elliott and his family for the holidays.

Since 2016, Thomas has worked frequently with filmmaker Mike Flanagan, appearing in his films &quot;&quot;, &quot;Gerald&#x27;s Game&quot; and &quot;Doctor Sleep&quot;, as well as in the Netflix horror series &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;, which Flanagan created and directed. Thomas also has a role in Flanagan&#x27;s follow up to &quot;The Haunting of Hill House&quot;, &quot;The Haunting of Bly Manor&quot;, and Flanagan&#x27;s mini-series &quot;Midnight Mass&quot;.

Thomas worked in &quot;Stargirl&quot; portraying Doctor Mid-Nite and voicing his A.I. counterpart &quot;Chuck&quot; until the latter role was recast with Alex Collins in season two.

=== Music ===
Thomas wrote songs and played guitar for a San Antonio band, The Blue Heelers (named for the breed of dog), in the 1990s. Although the band was not signed to a record label, it self-produced an album, &quot;Twister&quot;. Thomas continued to write and record songs. In 1998, his song &quot;Truckstop Coffee&quot; (recorded with the Blue Heelers) appeared on V2&#x27;s soundtrack for &quot;Niagara, Niagara&quot;. In 2003, Thomas and Nikki Sudden collaborated on the music for Mika Kaurismäki&#x27;s film &quot;Honey Baby&quot;, which featured four original songs written and performed by Thomas as the fictional musician Tom Brackett. An album was in the works, but Sudden died unexpectedly in 2006.

== Personal life ==
Thomas married actress Marie Zielcke on May 10, 2004. They had a daughter. The couple were divorced in 2007. Thomas also has two children with his third wife Annalee Fery, and in 2014 moved to Wilsonville, Oregon. Thomas and Fery separated during an unspecified point in time. He is currently dating actress India Eisley.

<doc id="1101473" wikidata="Q7720794" url="?curid=1101473" title="The Butterfly's Ball, and the Grasshopper's Feast">
<text>The Butterfly&#x27;s Ball, and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast is a poem by William Roscoe, written in 1802, and telling the story of a party for insects and other small animals.

==Background==
Two anonymous sequels were &quot;The Peacock &#x27;At Home&#x27; &quot;and &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Masquerade and the Elephant&#x27;s Champetre&quot;, both initially credited to &quot;A Lady&quot;, and describing similar parties for birds and large mammals. &quot;The Peacock &#x27;At Home&quot;&#x27; was very popular and the 1809 edition revealed the author to be Catherine Ann Dorset.

&quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot; is also the title of a 1973 picture book by Alan Aldridge and William Plomer, loosely based on the poem. This greatly expanded and altered the original work, focusing more on the animals&#x27; preparations for the Ball. Aldridge went on to create two more books based on the sequels; &quot;The Peacock Party&quot; and &quot;The Lion&#x27;s Cavalcade&quot;.

An animated short based on Aldridge&#x27;s illustrations, but once more focusing on the Ball itself, was made in 1974, with Roger Glover writing the accompanying song &#x27;Love Is All&quot;, based on the song &quot;Love&#x27;s All You Need&quot; mentioned in the book. This was supposed to lead to a full length animated film, which did not get made. However, Glover had written a full soundtrack, which was performed and released as a rock opera, &quot;The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper&#x27;s Feast&quot;.

<doc id="1101488" wikidata="Q2305438" url="?curid=1101488" title="Telkom Indonesia">
<text>PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia (Persero) Tbk () officially shortened into PT Telkom Indonesia (Persero) Tbk, also simply known as Telkom, is an Indonesian multinational telecommunications conglomerate with its corporate headquarters in Bandung and its operational headquarters in the Telkom Landmark Complex in Jakarta. Telkom is listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange and has a secondary listing on the New York Stock Exchange—the only Indonesian company, currently listed there (but not the first—the first was Indosat, which delisted from the exchange in 2013). The government of Indonesia owns over half of the Telkom&#x27;s outstanding shares.

Telkom has major business lines in fixed line telephony, internet, and data communications. It is operated as the parent company of the Telkom Group, which is engaged in a broad range of businesses which consist of telecommunication, multimedia, property, and financial services. Since 2008, Telkom Indonesia began changing its business, focusing on infrastructure, systems, organization and human resources, and the corporate culture, in order to face the rising competition.

After privatization in 1995, Telkom Indonesia&#x27;s total consumer base grew by 7.8% in 2010 to 129.8 million customers at the end of December 2011, making the company the nation&#x27;s largest telecommunication service provider in terms of subscriber count.

==History==
Telkom is one of the world&#x27;s oldest telecommunication companies. The company can be traced back to the establishment of the first electromagnetic telegraph service in Indonesia on 23 October 1856, by the Dutch colonial government to connect Batavia (Jakarta) and Buitenzorg (Bogor).

In 1884, the Dutch colonial government founded a private company with its headquarters in Bandung to provide postal and domestic telegraph services and, later on, international telegraph and telephony services.

===Early years===
Telephony services had been introduced to Indonesia in 1882 by privately owned companies under a 25-year government license.

In 1906, all postal and telegraph services in Indonesia were taken over by the government as a single, unified government agency named Post, Telegraph and Telephone Service (, PTT).

The outbreak of World War II greatly weakened Dutch defense forces, especially when telephone services were was nationalized by Nazi Germany on 14 May 1940. Then, telephone services were was nationalized by Japan from 1942 to 1945

In September 1945, roughly a month after the Indonesian proclamation of independence, the agency headquarters in Bandung was taken over by Indonesian nationalists.

In December 1949, after years of national revolution war, the PTT was nationalized by the Indonesian Government as part of an Indonesian effort to oust the remaining Dutch and nationalize Dutch corporate assets.

===State-owned company===
In 1961, PTT was converted from an official government agency into a newly established statutory corporation, the Postal and Telecommunications Services company.

Four years later, on 6 July 1965, Indonesian Government separated this company into two statutory corporations; &quot;PN Pos Giro,&quot; responsible for providing mail services and &quot;PN Telekomunikasi&quot; for telecommunications services. The mail services &quot;PN Pos Giro&quot; developed over the year became the Pos Indonesia in 1995, which is still state-owned today and the official postal carrier for Indonesia&#x27;s population of 230 million.

In 1974, &quot;PN Telekomunikasi&quot; was further divided into two state-owned companies. Perusahaan Umum Telekomunikasi (Perumtel) provided domestic and international telecommunications services, while PT Industri Telekomunikasi Indonesia (PT INTI) manufactured telecommunications equipment. A further division in 1980 saw the international telecommunications business taken over by the newly nationalized PT Indonesian Satellite Corporation (Indosat).

In 1991, Perumtel became a state-owned &quot;perseroan terbatas&quot; and renamed to what is now &quot;Perusahaan Perseroan (Persero)&quot; PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia or Telkom. Until 1995, Telkom&#x27;s operations were organized along twelve regional operating units known as &quot;Wilayah Telekomunikasi&quot; or Witel. Each Witel had full responsibility for all aspects of business and operations in their respective regions, such as telephone services, property management, and security.

In 1995, Telkom reorganized the twelve Witels into seven regional divisions and one network division. Under a series of Cooperation (KSO) Agreements, Telkom transferred the right to operate five of its seven regional divisions (I, III, IV, VI, and VII) to private sector consortia. Under these agreements, the KSO partners manage and operate the regional division concerned for a fixed term, build a specified number of fixed lines which at the end of the term, transfer the telecommunications facilities to Telkom for an agreed amount in compensation. Revenues from the KSO operations were shared between Telkom and the KSO partners.

===Privatization===
On 14 November 1995, Telkom became a privatized company when their shares went on sale through an Initial public offering on the Jakarta Stock Exchange and the Surabaya Stock Exchange (which merged in December 2007 to become the Indonesia Stock Exchange). Telkom&#x27;s shares are also listed on the NYSE and the LSE, the former in the form of American depositary shares (ADSs), and were publicly offered without listing on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Telkom is now the largest company by market capitalization in Indonesia, with a market capitalization of approximately IDR 190,512 trillion as of 31 December 2009. The Government retains an aggregate interest of 51.19% of the issued and outstanding shares of Telkom. The Government also holds one &quot;Dwiwarna&quot;, or golden share.

In mid-1997, Indonesia was badly affected by the Asian economic crisis. Among those impacted were certain KSO partners, who experienced difficulties in fulfilling their obligations to Telkom. Telkom eventually acquired control of its KSO partners in Regions I, III, and VI, and amended the terms of the KSO agreements with its KSO partners in Regions IV and VII to obtain legal rights to control the financial and operating decisions of those regions.

Since 5 June 2014, Telkom shares are no longer traded on the London Stock Exchange (&quot;LSE&quot;), and since 16 May 2014, they have ceased to be registered on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (&quot;TSE&quot;) in Japan.

===Telecommunication deregulation===
In 1999, Indonesia passed a deregulating telecommunication law that set in motion a sweeping array of reforms and enlivened competition policy, private investment, and long term industry direction. Among the proposed reforms were the progressive elimination of the joint ownership, by Telkom and Indosat, of most of the telecommunications companies in Indonesia. This was intended to promote a more competitive market. As a result, in 2001, Telkom acquired Indosat&#x27;s 35.0% stake in Telkomsel, resulting in Telkom owning 77.7% of the shares of Telkomsel, while Indosat acquired Telkom&#x27;s 22.5% interest in Satelindo and its 37.7% stake in Lintasarta. In 2002, Telkom sold 12.7% of Telkomsel to Singapore Telecom Mobile Pte Ltd (SingTel Mobile), reducing Telkom&#x27;s ownership of Telkomsel to 65.0%.

On 1 August 2001, the Government terminated Telkom&#x27;s exclusive right to provide fixed line services in Indonesia and Indosat&#x27;s right to provide international direct dial services. Subsequently, Telkom&#x27;s exclusive rights to provide domestic and long-distance services were terminated in August 2002 and August 2003, respectively.

On 7 June 2004, Telkom began to provide their own international direct dial fixed line services. On 16 November 2005, the Telkom-2 satellite was launched to replace all satellite transmission services that have been served by previous satellite, Palapa B-4.

===Transformations===
In 2009, Telkom started transforming its business, being the only company in the field of telecommunications to transform to a broader range of business. The company expanded to telecommunications, information technology services, media and edutainment. Telkom&#x27;s decision to transform its business was prompted by the shift in customer lifestyles and supported by advances in technology and regulatory changes that enabled service providers to deliver enhanced service to customers. With this new business transformation, Telkom also plans to conduct the acquisition of several companies that are in line with Telkom&#x27;s transformation of the new business.

In August 2012, the Telkom-3 satellite was lost in a launch failure, being placed into an unusably low orbit following the failure of the Briz-M upper stage of the Proton-M rocket that had launched it. Its replacement Telkom-3S successfully launched aboard an Ariane 5 rocket on 14 February 2017, 21:39 UTC.

In March 2019, Telkom Indonesia was one of the first Asian telco&#x27;s to launch a cloud gaming service in cooperation with Gamestream.

==Operations==
Telkom Indonesia is a dominant and largest provider of fixed line services due to owning most of Indonesia&#x27;s copper network. Telkom also runs telephone exchanges, trunk network and local loop connections for its fixed-line telephones. Currently, Telkom is responsible for approximately 8.3 million telephone lines in Indonesia. And like most of the other state-ownership telecommunication companies in the world, Telkom is obliged to provide public services such as public call boxes.

Telkom Indonesia businesses are operated under government regulation by the Indonesian Ministry of Communication and Information. Telkom, as a government-owned company, is required to comply with additional obligations such as provide telecommunication services and not being discriminatory. As well as providing service in those regulated areas, Telkom has expanded into more profitable products and services where there is less government-owned-related regulation.

Telkom Indonesia is the parent company of the Telkom Group, which is engaged in a wide range of businesses that consist of telecommunication, information, multimedia, property, and financial services. Telkom mainly operates in fixed line telephony, internet and data communications business, while other businesses are run by subsidiaries.

===Business divisions===
Telkom now categorizes its portfolio into 3 Digital Business Domains:
# Digital Connectivity: Fiber to the x (FTTx), 5G, Software Defined Networking (SDN)/ Network Function Virtualization (NFV)/ Satellite
# Digital Platform: Data Center, Cloud, Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data/ Artificial Intelligence (AI), Cybersecurity

<doc id="1101492" wikidata="Q503130" url="?curid=1101492" title="Hunayn ibn Ishaq">
<text>Hunayn ibn Ishaq al-Ibadi (also Hunain or Hunein) (; (808–873), known in Latin as Johannitius, was an influential Arab Nestorian Christian translator, scholar, physician, and scientist. During the apex of the Islamic Abbasid era, he worked with a group of translators, among whom were Abū &#x27;Uthmān al-Dimashqi, Ibn Mūsā al-Nawbakhti, and Thābit ibn Qurra, to translate books of philosophy and classical Greek and Persian texts into Arabic and Syriac.

Ḥunayn ibn Isḥaq was the most productive translator of Greek medical and scientific treatises in his day. He studied Greek and became known as the &quot;Sheikh of the Translators&quot;. He mastered four languages: Arabic, Syriac, Greek and Persian. Hunayn&#x27;s method was widely followed by later translators. He was originally from al-Hirah, previously capital of the Lakhmid kingdom, but he spent his working life in Baghdad, the center of the Translation movement. His fame went far beyond his own community.

==Overview==
In the Abbasid era, a new interest in extending the study of Greek science had arisen. At that time, there was a vast amount of untranslated ancient Greek literature pertaining to philosophy, mathematics, natural science, and medicine. This valuable information was only accessible to a very small minority of Middle Eastern scholars who knew the Greek language; the need for an organized translation movement was urgent.

In time, Hunayn ibn Ishaq became arguably the chief translator of the era, and laid the foundations of Islamic medicine. In his lifetime, ibn Ishaq translated 116 works, including Plato&#x27;s Timaeus, Aristotle&#x27;s Metaphysics, and the Old Testament, into Syriac and Arabic. Ibn Ishaq also produced 36 of his own books, 21 of which covered the field of medicine. His son Ishaq, and his nephew Hubaysh, worked together with him at times to help translate. Hunayn ibn Ishaq is known for his translations, his method of translation, and his contributions to medicine. He has also been suggested by François Viré to be the true identity of the Arabic falconer Moamyn, author of &quot;De Scientia Venandi per Aves&quot;. Hunayn Ibn Ishaq was a translator at the House of Wisdom, Bayt al-Hikma, where he received his education. In the West, another name he is known by his Latin name, Joannitius. It was the translations that came from administrative and legal materials gathered that lead to understanding of how to build up Arabic as the new official language.

==Early life==
Hunayn ibn Ishaq was an Arab Nestorian Christian, born in 808, during the Abbasid period, in al-Hirah, to an ethnic Arab family. Hunayn in classical sources is said to have belonged to the ʿIbad, thus his nisba &quot;al-Ibadi. The ʿIbad was an Arab community composed of different Arab tribes that had once converted to Nestorian Christianity and lived in al-Hira. They were known for their literacy and multilingualism, being fluent in Syriac, their liturgical and cultural language, in addition to their native Arabic.

As a child, he learned the Syriac and Arabic languages. Although al-Hira was known for commerce and banking, and his father was a pharmacist, Hunayn went to Baghdad in order to study medicine. In Baghdad, Hunayn had the privilege to study under renowned physician Yuhanna ibn Masawayh; however, Hunayn&#x27;s countless questions irritated Yuhanna, causing him to scold Hunayn and forcing him to leave. Hunayn promised himself to return to Baghdad when he became a physician. He went abroad to master the Greek language. On his return to Baghdad, Hunayn displayed his newly acquired skills by reciting the works of Homer and Galen. In awe, ibn Masawayh reconciled with Hunayn, and the two started to work cooperatively.

Hunayn was extremely motivated in his work to master Greek studies, which enabled him to translate Greek texts into Syriac and Arabic. The Abbasid Caliph al-Mamun noticed Hunayn&#x27;s talents and placed him in charge of the House of Wisdom, the Bayt al Hikmah. The House of Wisdom was an institution where Greek works were translated and made available to scholars. (At least one scholar has argued that there is no evidence of Hunayn being placed in charge of the Bayt al Hikmah.) The caliph also gave Hunayn the opportunity to travel to Byzantium in search of additional manuscripts, such as those of Aristotle and other prominent authors.

==Accomplishments==
In Hunayn ibn Ishaq&#x27;s lifetime, he devoted himself to working on a multitude of writings; both translations and original works.

===As a writer of original work===
Hunayn wrote on a variety of subjects that included philosophy, religion and medicine. In &quot;How to Grasp Religion&quot;, Hunayn explains the truths of religion that include miracles not possibly made by humans and humans&#x27; incapacity to explain facts about some phenomena, and false notions of religion that include depression and an inclination for glory. He also worked on Arabic grammar and lexicography, writing a unique grammar of the Arabic language titled &quot;The Rules of Inflexion According to the System of the Greeks.&quot;

====Ophthalmology====

Hunayn ibn Ishaq enriched the field of ophthalmology. His developments in the study of the human eye can be traced through his innovative book, &quot;Book of the Ten Treatises of the Eye&quot;. This textbook is the first known systematic treatment of this field and was most likely used in medical schools at the time. Throughout the book, Hunayn explains the eye and its anatomy in minute detail; its diseases, their symptoms, and their treatments. Hunayn repeatedly emphasizes that he believes the crystalline lens to be in the center of the eye, and may have been the originator of this idea, which was widely believed from his lifetime through the late 1500s.
He discusses the nature of cysts and tumors, and the swelling they cause. He discusses how to treat various corneal ulcers through surgery, and the therapy involved in repairing cataracts. The book is evidence of the skills Hunayn ibn Ishaq had not just as a translator and a physician, but also as a surgeon.

===As a physician===
Hunayn ibn Ishaq&#x27;s reputation as a scholar and translator, and his close relationship with Caliph al-Mutawakkil, led the caliph to name Hunayn as his personal physician, ending the exclusive use of physicians from the Bukhtishu family. Despite their relationship, the caliph became distrustful; at the time, there were fears of death from poisoning, and physicians were well aware of its synthesis procedure. The caliph tested Hunayn&#x27;s ethics as a physician by asking him to formulate a poison, to be used against a foe, in exchange for a large sum. Hunayn ibn Ishaq repeatedly rejected the Caliph&#x27;s generous offers, saying he would need time to develop a poison. Disappointed, the caliph imprisoned his physician for a year. When asked why he would rather be killed than make the drug, Hunayn explained the physician&#x27;s oath required him to help, and not harm, his patients. He completed many different medical works that pushed the idea of treating medicine with the practice and art of physic treatments. Some of his medical works were pulled from Greek sources such as, Fi Awja al-Ma&#x27;idah (On Stomach Ailments) and al-Masail fi&#x27;l-Tibb li&#x27;l-Muta&#x27;allimin (Questions on Medicine for Students) and having these sources to drawn on keeps the original text clear.

===As a translator===
With the construction of the House of Wisdom, the Abbasid Caliph al-Ma&#x27;mun wanted to have a place to gather world knowledge from Muslim and non-Muslim educators. Hunayn ibn Ishaq was one of the most well-known translators at the institution and was called the sheikh of the translators, as he mastered the four principal languages of the time: Greek, Persian, Arabic, and Syriac. He was able to translate compositions on philosophy, astronomy, mathematics, medicine, and even in subjects such as magic and oneiromancy. Nonetheless, none of his extant translations credit the House of Wisdom, which questions the legitimacy of whether this place actually was the origin of the Translation Movement. He laid down the basis of accurate translating techniques, which was extremely important for the accurate transmission of knowledge.

Some of Hunayn&#x27;s most notable translations were his rendering of &quot;De Materia Medica&quot;, a pharmaceutical handbook, and his most popular selection, &quot;Questions on Medicine&quot;, a guide for novice physicians. Information was presented in the form of questions taken from Galen&#x27;s &quot;Art of Physic&quot; and answers, which are based on &quot;Summaria Alexandrinorum&quot;. For instance, Hunayn explains what the four elements and the four humors are and that medicine divides into therapy and practice and also defines health, disease, neutrality, and as well as the natural and the contranatural, and the six necessary conditions of living healthily.

Hunayn translated writings on agriculture, stones, and religion and also some of Plato&#x27;s and Aristotle&#x27;s works, in addition to commentaries. He also translated many medicinal texts and summaries, mainly those of Galen, such as Galen&#x27;s &quot;On Sects&quot; and &quot;On the Anatomy of the Veins and Arteries&quot;. His translations are some of the only remaining documents of Greek manuscripts, and he helped influence the art of medicine, and through his book al-&#x27;Ashar Maqalat fi&#x27;l-Ayn (The Ten Treatises on the Eye) he helped to expand the science of ophthalmology through theory and practice.

Many R. Duval&#x27;s published works on chemistry represent translations of Hunayn&#x27;s work. Also in Chemistry a book titled [&#x27;An Al-Asma&#x27;] meaning &quot;About the Names&quot;, did not reach researchers but was used in &quot;Dictionary of Ibn Bahlool&quot; of the 10th century.

====Translation techniques====
In his efforts to translate Greek material, Hunayn ibn Ishaq was accompanied by his son Ishaq ibn Hunayn and his nephew Hubaysh. Hunayn would translate Greek into Syriac, and then he would have his nephew finish by translating the text from Syriac to Arabic, after which he then would seek to correct any of his partners&#x27; mistakes or inaccuracies he might find.

Unlike many translators in the Abbasid period, he largely did not try to follow the text&#x27;s exact lexicon. Instead, he would try to summarize the topics of the original texts and then in a new manuscript paraphrase it in Syriac or Arabic. He also edited and redacted the available texts of technical works by comparing the information included therein with other works on similar subjects. Thus, his renditions may be seen as interpretations of medical, astronomical, and philosophical texts after researching the topics over which they range. Some scholars argue Hunayn&#x27;s approach differed from previous translators through his commentaries on the subject and was influenced by Galen&#x27;s ideas along the way.

Hunayn says:
====Selected translations====

<doc id="1101493" wikidata="Q2923412" url="?curid=1101493" title="Brad Lidge">
<text>Bradley Thomas Lidge (born December 23, 1976), nicknamed &quot;Lights Out&quot;, is an American former professional baseball pitcher. Lidge played 11 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), from 2002–2012. He played for the Houston Astros, Philadelphia Phillies, and Washington Nationals. As a relief pitcher Lidge saved 225 games during his career. He was a two-time All-Star, and in 2008 won the Delivery Man of the Year Award and the National League (NL) Rolaids Relief Man Award. Lidge was a host on SiriusXM&#x27;s MLB Network Radio.

Lidge threw a four-seam fastball that consistently reached 95–97 miles per hour, as well as a hard, sharp breaking slider that ranged from 85 to 87 mph. He also had a cutter of the variation. He sealed the Phillies&#x27; 2008 World Series championship with the final out, a strikeout of Eric Hinske in Game 5.

==Early life==
Lidge was born in Sacramento, California on December 23, 1976. His family moved to Englewood, Colorado when Lidge was very young. Growing up, Lidge played football, basketball and baseball among other sports. He attended Cherry Creek High School. Lidge initially played outfield but became a pitcher because Cherry Creek&#x27;s outfield was populated by such draft prospects as Donzell McDonald. He was drafted by the San Francisco Giants in the 42nd round of the 1995 draft but did not sign.

==College career==
Lidge attended the University of Notre Dame, where he played college baseball for the Notre Dame Fighting Irish baseball team. He won the Big East Conference player of the year award during his junior season under coach Paul Mainieri, leading the conference with an 8–2 record and 93 strikeouts in innings.

==Professional career==

===Houston Astros (2002–2007)===

====Early career====
Lidge was a first round draft pick by the Houston Astros in the 1998 MLB draft, chosen 17th overall as a compensatory pick from the Colorado Rockies, who had signed Darryl Kile in the offseason. Lidge missed parts of his first four professional seasons (at Quad Cities, Kissimmee, Round Rock, and New Orleans) with injuries, including a torn rotator cuff and a broken forearm that threatened his career. He would overcome these injuries, making his MLB debut on April 26, 2002, against the Atlanta Braves, serving as a middle relief pitcher in the Astros&#x27; bullpen. He started the only game of his career in September of that year against the Milwaukee Brewers. Lidge went 2-for-2 with a double and 2 RBIs at the plate, but was pulled when he strained an intercostal muscle in his ribcage after pitching three scoreless innings with four strikeouts, two walks and a hit batsman.

====2003–04====
In 2003, Lidge was the winning pitcher in the Astros&#x27; historic six-pitcher tandem which no-hit the New York Yankees on June 11. That year, Lidge was voted Astros Rookie of the Year by the Houston Chapter of the BBWAA.

Following the trades of Billy Wagner in the 2003 off-season and Octavio Dotel in the summer of 2004, the Astros moved Lidge from setup man to closer. He set a new National League record for strikeouts by a reliever with 157, passing Goose Gossage&#x27;s total of 151 set in 1977. The mark is third all-time for relievers, behind Dick Radatz&#x27;s 181 in , and Mark Eichhorn&#x27;s 166 in . In the 2004 season, hitters swung and missed at Lidge&#x27;s strikes almost 42% of the time; for balls out of the strike zone, batters missed more than 70% of the time. Baseball writer Joe Posnanski noted, &quot;I have no doubt that Brad Lidge, that one year, was one of the most unhittable pitchers in the history of baseball.&quot;

====2005====

In his first All-Star Game appearance in 2005, Lidge pitched the bottom of the seventh, striking out all three batters he faced. He threw 11 pitches (two balls) to Melvin Mora, Mike Sweeney, and Garret Anderson, who did not make contact with any of Lidge&#x27;s pitches. Lidge became the first pitcher to strike out the side in his first All-Star appearance since Bill Caudill and Dwight Gooden in 1984.

Later in 2005, Lidge finished the season with a 2.29 ERA and a career-high 42 saves. That year, Lidge ranked third in the National League in saves and became the second Houston Astros pitcher ever to record at least 40 saves in one season alongside Billy Wagner.

During the 2005 NLCS, Lidge gave up a three-run home run to Albert Pujols in Game 5 in Houston which forced a Game 6 back in St. Louis, which the Astros would win to clinch their first World Series berth in franchise history. In his very next appearance, Lidge gave up a walk off home run to Scott Podsednik in Game 2 of the 2005 World Series and the series winning run and hit in Game 4 to go 0–2 in the series and complete the White Sox sweep of the Astros.

====2006====
Lidge pitched for the United States national baseball team in the 2006 World Baseball Classic, throwing two scoreless innings. Later that year, Lidge became the third pitcher in Astros history to record 100 saves with the club, after Wagner and Dave Smith, and this led the Astros to sign Lidge to a one-year, $5.35 million contract that would keep him in Houston through the 2007 season.

==== 2007 ====
The Astros avoided contract arbitration with Lidge on January 17, 2007, by signing him to a one-year contract worth $5.35 million. After seeing Lidge struggle in spring training and blow his first save of the season, manager Phil Garner chose to make Dan Wheeler the new Astros closer, while offering Lidge opportunities to relieve in the sixth or seventh innings of games. He regained the closer role at the start of June, but was placed on the disabled list that same month after suffering a strained left oblique muscle. Although Lidge described to reporters that the injury bothered him less towards the end of the day, Garner chose to shut his closer down in order to keep the muscle strain from becoming a larger issue.

After returning to the active roster on July 13, Lidge picked up his first save of the season on July 18, against the Washington Nationals. With the July 31 trading deadline approaching, there was speculation that the Astros, who had the third-lowest record in the National League (NL) would trade Lidge, but owner Drayton McLane told reporters, &quot;I see no reason we should even consider it. He&#x27;s been one of the best closers in baseball.&quot; Instead, the club traded Wheeler to the Tampa Bay Devil Rays in exchange for infielder Ty Wigginton. Despite his early-season struggles and injuries, Lidge finished the 2007 season 5–3 with 19 saves in 27 opportunities. He also held his opponents to a .218 batting average and record and average of 11.8 strikeouts per nine innings pitched (K/9). After the season, Lidge underwent surgery to repair a cartilage tear in his right knee, with the anticipation that he would be healthy for the beginning of spring training. On November 7, 2007, Lidge was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies along with Eric Bruntlett for Geoff Geary, Michael Bourn, and Mike Costanzo.

===Philadelphia Phillies (2008–2011)===

====2008====
In February 2008, Lidge tore the meniscus in his right knee while pitching off the mound during Spring training. To exacerbate matters, this was the same knee that he had had surgery on during the off-season. Later in the month, he had successful arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to repair the torn meniscus. As a result, Lidge sat out until April 5 to start the season.

During the early 2008 season, Lidge showed signs that he regained the dominant form he displayed in his earlier career. In the opening two months of the season, he converted 12 save opportunities and allowed just two earned runs. In May, Lidge returned to Minute Maid Park, where he was greeted by a mixed reaction from Astros fans, but he recorded his 12th save of the season against his former team. He opened the month of June, usually the start of the summer&#x27;s heavy-hitting season, with three saves earned in three straight games versus the Florida Marlins and the Cincinnati Reds.

In July 2008, Lidge signed a 3-year contract extension with the Phillies. Lidge also set new Phillies records by converting his first 19 save opportunities and 35 straight saves.

Lidge was named to the roster of the 2008 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. He was announced before the game as the closer. After warming up six separate times, he ended up the final pitcher available in the game, and pitched in the 15th inning. He allowed a game-winning sacrifice fly in the bottom half of the inning, as the American League won the game, 4–3. 
On September 27, 2008, Lidge became the first closer in Phillies history to be perfect in regular season saves, converting 41 in as many opportunities, as he secured the National League East division title for the Phillies. He is the first closer since Éric Gagné in 2003 to have a perfect conversion rate and 30+ saves. Lidge finished the 2008 season with 41 out of 41 save opportunities, a 1.95 ERA, and 92 strikeouts in 62 games.

He saved the decisive Game 5 of the 2008 World Series in Philadelphia on October 29, 2008 over the Tampa Bay Rays with a strikeout, to make him seven-for-seven in postseason saves, thus completing his perfect season (a record he shares with John Wetteland, Troy Percival, Koji Uehara, Zach Britton and Greg Holland; Robb Nen was also 7 for 7 in 2002 before he blew one on the 8th opportunity).

Lidge was eighth in the voting for the 2008 NL MVP award, behind Albert Pujols, Ryan Howard, Ryan Braun, Manny Ramirez, Lance Berkman, CC Sabathia, and David Wright, and was the only player other than Pujols or Howard to receive first place votes.

He received the MLB Comeback Player of the Year Award and Delivery Man of the Year Award. Baseball fans nationwide voted him the MLB &quot;This Year in Baseball Awards&quot; Closer of the Year. Lidge was voted the Philadelphia Sports Writers Association&#x27;s Outstanding Pro Athlete of the Year award and honored at their annual dinner on January 26, 2009. He was named the inaugural recipient of the &quot;Daily News&quot; Sportsperson of the Year award.

Lidge gave twelve customized Rolex Submariners to the members of the Phillies bullpen to commemorate his perfect season.

====2009====
Lidge&#x27;s 2009 season was a complete reversal of fortune from the prior year, in which he was perfect in save opportunities. Through the month of June, Lidge had an ERA of 7.57 in innings pitched, while he converted only 14 of 20 save opportunities. Lidge missed most of June due to injury, as he was placed on the disabled list due to a sprained right knee.

After returning to the Phillies, Lidge&#x27;s performance did not improve and he continued to blow leads and save opportunities, but Phillies manager Charlie Manuel continued to support Lidge and reiterate that he was the team&#x27;s closer. By September, though, Lidge had struggled long enough that Manuel began using other relievers to close games. Lidge was used in different situations out of the bullpen, but did not find a role where he pitched consistently well. Lidge finished the season with a win–loss record of 0–8, an ERA of 7.21, and 31 saves in 42 opportunities, and he allowed an average of 1.81 walks plus hits per inning pitched. For closers with at least 20 saves in a season, Lidge&#x27;s 2009 ERA is the worst in MLB history. Lidge&#x27;s best month of the season was July, when his ERA was 5.91, and his best save streak stretched only 8 consecutive saves.

In the National League Division Series against the Colorado Rockies, Lidge appeared in Games 3 and 4 in save situations, earning the save in both games. In Game 1 of the 2009 National League Championship Series, Lidge secured his 3rd save helping the Phillies win 8–6. In Game 4 of the series, Lidge pitched in relief of Scott Eyre to retire the last two batters with the Phillies trailing 4–3 in the ninth inning. He eventually got his first win of 2009 after Jimmy Rollins hit a game-winning double to give the Phillies a 5–4 victory. Entering the 2009 World Series, Lidge and the New York Yankees&#x27; Mariano Rivera were the only closers who had not blown a save during the 2009 postseason. In Game 4 which would be Lidge&#x27;s only appearance in that World Series, he gave up three runs in the ninth inning, giving the Yankees a 7–4 win and a 3–1 lead in the series. The Yankees went on to win the series in six games.

====2010====
Lidge underwent elbow surgery in January 2010, and he pitched in rehabilitation games with the Phillies&#x27; minor league teams (Clearwater, Reading, &amp; Lehigh Valley) during the beginning of the 2010 season. He made his first major league appearance of the season on April 30 against the New York Mets, surrendering a home run to the first batter he faced and recording one out before being removed from the game. On June 22, 2010, Lidge recorded his 200th save against the Cleveland Indians.

After spending most of the first half on the disabled list, Lidge rebounded from the previous season. He converted 17 of his last 18 save opportunities during the regular season and recorded two saves during a 2010 postseason in which he did not allow a run. Lidge finished 2010 with a 2.96 ERA and 27 saves in 32 opportunities.

==== 2011 ====
After entering spring training fully healthy, Lidge was shut down on March 25 with pain in the back of his right shoulder, which he said was a new occurrence. An MRI revealed a posterior rotator cuff strain that did not require surgery, but would take three to six weeks to heal, and he began the 2011 MLB season on the disabled list. He underwent an eight-game rehab assignment with Lakewood and Reading, going 0–0 with a 3.52 ERA and 10 strikeouts in 7.2 innings before returning to the Phillies roster on July 22. Although his pitch velocity remained constant during Lidge&#x27;s rehab appearances, with his fastball hovering around , Lidge and sports journalists alike voiced concerns over the pitcher&#x27;s control: in one appearance for Reading, he threw only 15 strikes in 28 pitches.

Lidge did not return to the closer role even after coming off of the disabled list; instead, his setup man Ryan Madson filled the ninth inning, while Lidge found himself in competition with Antonio Bastardo over who would pitch the eighth. Despite seeing a decreased velocity on his fastball, Lidge found success in later innings with his slider, working up to an 11.29 K/9 by the end of September. Lidge&#x27;s strong relationship with Madson helped both players adjust to their new positions. Lidge told reporters during the 2011 NLCS that, while Madson was closing, he would find himself &quot;shaking pitches off with [Madson]. I feel that I am there with him.&quot; Lidge played in 25 games during the 2011 season, during which he posted a 0–2 record with a 1.40 ERA and struck out 23 batters in innings.

=== Washington Nationals (2012) ===

On January 26, 2012, the Washington Nationals signed Lidge to a one-year, $1 million contract, plus additional incentives. He had not been signed as a closer for Washington, but after Drew Storen suffered from elbow inflammation during spring training, the team prepared to use Lidge and Henry Rodríguez in the ninth inning. The pair officially took over for Storen when the latter underwent surgery for a bone chip in his elbow. After allowing four earned runs in seven innings and blowing two saves, Lidge was placed on the disabled list with an abdominal wall strain. He was diagnosed with a sports hernia and underwent surgery on May 1, with an estimated recovery time of three weeks before he could begin throwing again. After pitching a perfect inning in a rehab assignment for the Class A-Advanced Potomac Nationals, Lidge was able to rejoin the Washington active roster on June 7, a week earlier than expected; he effectively replaced Rodríguez, who was placed on the disabled list with a strained finger. He was unable to perform with the Nationals, going 0–1 with two saves and a 9.64 ERA in 11 bullpen appearances, with opposing hitters batting .308 against him. The Nationals designated Lidge for assignment on June 17 after two poor outings against the New York Yankees, and Ryan Mattheus was activated in his place. He was released from his contract shortly after, and returned home to Colorado in order to spend time with his family and consider whether or not he would pursue another contract.

=== Retirement ===
After being released from the Nationals, Lidge took the remainder of the summer to decide whether he wanted to continue his pitching career. On December 2, 2012, he announced his intentions to retire from baseball. At the time of his retirement, Lidge had 225 regular-season career saves, as well as 18 postseason saves. He also struck out 799 batters in regular-season innings for a career 11.919 K/9, the second-best ratio of any pitcher with more than 500 innings. Lidge signed a ceremonial one-day contract with the Phillies on August 1, 2013, enabling him to officially retire as a member of the organization.

==Personal life==
Lidge currently resides in Englewood, Colorado, with his wife, Lindsay, and their two children, a daughter and a son. He has an interest in archaeology and religious studies and takes online courses at Regis University. Lidge&#x27;s cousin, Ryan Lidge, is currently a catcher in the New York Yankees organization.

<doc id="1101499" wikidata="Q1136648" url="?curid=1101499" title="Emery (rock)">
<text>Emery, or corundite, is a dark granular rock used to make an abrasive powder. The rock largely consists of corundum (aluminium oxide), mixed with other minerals. Industrial emery may contain a variety of other minerals and synthetic compounds. Crushed or naturally eroded emery (known as black sand) is used as an abrasive. Turkey and Greece are the main suppliers of the world&#x27;s emery.

== Description ==
Emery is a granular rock used to make an abrasive powder. It largely consists of corundum (aluminium oxide), mixed with other minerals such as the iron-bearing spinels, hercynite, and magnetite, and also rutile (titania). Industrial emery may contain a variety of other minerals and synthetic compounds such as magnesia, mullite, and silica.

Emery is black or dark grey in colour, less dense than translucent-brown corundum with a specific gravity of between 3.5 and 3.8. Because it can be a mixture of minerals, no definite Mohs hardness can be assigned: the hardness of corundum is 9 and that of some spinel-group minerals is near 8, but the hardness of others such as magnetite is near 6.

== Use ==
Crushed or naturally eroded emery (known as &quot;black sand&quot;) is used as an abrasive—for example, on emery boards and emery cloth. It is also used as a traction enhancer in asphalt and tarmac mixtures.

A small quantity of emery is used in coated abrasive products, but its main use in the United States is wear-resistant floors and pavements. Many tons are shipped to Asia to be used in grinding rice.

Solomon&#x27;s shamir, a substance used to cut stone during construction of the First Temple, was likely emery.

== Harvest ==
Turkey and Greece are the main suppliers of the world&#x27;s emery. These two countries produced about 17,500 tons of the mineral in 1987.

The Greek island of Naxos used to be the main source of this industrially important rock type. It has been mined on the eastern side of Naxos for well over two thousand years as mentioned by Pliny the Elder&#x27;s &quot;The Natural History&quot;, book XXXVII, chp. 32. However, demand for emery has decreased with the development of sintered carbide and oxide materials as abrasives.

== Safety ==
In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration has set permissible exposure limits for emery in the workplace: TWA 15 mg/m3 total exposure and TWA 5 mg/m3 respiratory exposure.

<doc id="1101500" wikidata="Q828524" url="?curid=1101500" title="Mentalism">
<text>Mentalism is a performing art in which its practitioners, known as mentalists, appear to demonstrate highly developed mental or intuitive abilities. Mentalists perform a theatrical act that includes special effects that may appear to employ psychic or supernatural forces but that is actually achieved by &quot;ordinary conjuring means&quot;, natural human abilities (i.e. reading body language, refined intuition, subliminal communication, emotional intelligence), and an in-depth understanding of key principles from human psychology or other behavioral sciences. Performances may appear to include hypnosis, telepathy, clairvoyance, divination, precognition, psychokinesis, mediumship, mind control, memory feats, deduction, and rapid mathematics. 

Mentalism is commonly classified as a subcategory of magic and, when performed by a stage magician, may also be referred to as &quot;mental magic&quot;. However, many professional mentalists today may generally distinguish themselves from magicians, insisting that their art form leverages a distinct skillset. Instead of doing &quot;magic tricks&quot;, mentalists argue that they produce psychological experiences for the mind and imagination, and expand reality with explorations of psychology, suggestion, and influence. Mentalists are also often considered psychic entertainers, although that category also contains non-mentalist performers such as psychic readers and bizarrists.

Some well-known magicians, such as Penn &amp; Teller, and James Randi, argue that a key differentiation between a mentalist and someone who purports to be an actual psychic is that the former is open about being a skilled artist or entertainer who accomplishes their feats through practice, study, and natural means, while the latter may claim to actually possess genuine supernatural, psychic, or extrasensory powers and, thus, operates unethically.

Renowned mentalist Joseph Dunninger, who also worked to debunk fraudulent mediums, captured this key sentiment when he explained his impressive abilities in the following way: &quot;Any child of ten could do this – with forty years of experience.&quot; Like any performing art, mentalism requires years of dedication, extensive study, practice, and skill to perform well.

==Background==
Much of what modern mentalists perform in their acts can be traced back directly to &quot;tests&quot; of supernatural power that were carried out by mediums, spiritualists, and psychics in the 19th century. However, the history of mentalism goes back even further. Accounts of seers and oracles can be found in the Old Testament of the Bible and in works about ancient Greece. Paracelsus reiterated the theme, so reminiscent of the ancient Greeks, that three principias were incorporated into humanity: the spiritual, the physical, and mentalistic phenomena. The mentalist act generally cited as one of the earliest on record in the modern era was performed by diplomat and pioneering sleight-of-hand magician Girolamo Scotto in 1572. The performance of mentalism may utilize conjuring principles including sleights, feints, misdirection, and other skills of street or stage magic. Nonetheless, modern mentalists also now increasingly incorporate insights from human psychology and behavioral sciences to produce unexplainable experiences and effects for their audiences. Changing with the times, some mentalists incorporate a smartphone into their routine.

Mentalists typically seek to explain their effects as manifestations of psychology, hypnosis, an ability to influence by subtle verbal cues, an acute sensitivity to body language, etc. These are all genuine phenomena, but they are not sufficiently reliable or impressive to form the basis of a mentalism performance. These are in fact fake explanations - part of the mentalist&#x27;s misdirection - and the true method being employed is classic magicians&#x27; trickery. 

===Written &quot;billet&quot;===
A characteristic feature of &quot;mind-reading&quot; by a mentalist is that the spectator must write the thought down. Various justifications are given for this - in order to enable the spectator to focus on the thought, or in order to show it to other audience members etc. - but the real reason is to enable the mentalist then secretly to access the written-down information. There are various techniques which the mentalist can use. A classic method is the &quot;centre tear&quot;. The spectator is asked to commit her thought to writing on a small piece of paper (referred to by mentalists as a &quot;billet&quot;). She is told to write the thought in the centre of the billet, and sometimes a circle or a line will be added by the mentalist onto the billet to make sure she writes in the middle. She is then instructed to fold the billet up so that the writing cannot be seen by the mentalist. The mentalist then takes the billet and tears it into small pieces, which he may then burn or throw away or return to the spectator&#x27;s hand &quot;for safe-keeping&quot;. Secretly, during the tearing process, the mentalist tears out and secretes the centre part of the billet which bears the written thought, and later finds an opportunity to read it covertly. Alternatively the mentalist may covertly peek at the written thought. There are a large number of detailed choreographies used by mentalists to achieve a peek. One popular version - known as the &quot;acidus novus&quot; peek - requires the spectator to write her thought on the bottom right-hand corner of the billet. Typically the mentalist will fill up the other 3 quadrants of the billet with writing so that only the bottom right-hand quadrant is left clear. Once the thought is written and the billet folded, the mentalist will hold the billet up to the light to demonstrate that no writing can be seen through the paper. In the course of this action he is able, unobserved by the audience, to slip his thumb between the folds of the billet and expose a view of the bottom right-hand quadrant. He then gestures with the billet, bringing it at eye-level across his field of vision, and in so-doing is able secretly to peek at the spectator&#x27;s written thought. This is only one of a number of such peek choreographies. Some involve placing the billet in a gimmicked wallet, which allows the mentalist covertly to see the writing. Others employ sleights of hand derived from card or coin magic. 

===Modern gimmicks===
In addition to these traditional magicians&#x27; techniques, there is today a huge range of electronic, computer and other gimmicks available to the mentalist. These include dice which secretly transmit the numbers thrown, decks of cards which secretly transmit the cards chosen, notepads which secretly transmit what has been written etc. Smartphones have added an additional range of possibilities. For example, the mentalist can use concealed NFC tags to covertly download onto a spectator’s phone a fake version of a popular website such as Google Images, which allows him to know an image which the spectator believes has been chosen secretly.

===Nail writing and its technological equivalents===
Where a mind-reading performance does not involve the spectator writing the secret thought down, generally the method employed is that the mentalist purports to predict the secret thought by (apparently) writing an unseen prediction, often behind a clipboard or other hard surface, then he asks the spectator to reveal the thought, and the mentalist at that point quickly and covertly writes or completes his prediction using a nail writer or swami gimmick. These are small devices which allow the mentalist to write unseen with his thumb under cover of a clipboard or in his pocket. 

Again, these traditional magicians’ devices have now been supplemented by technology. The mentalist can now buy blackboards and whiteboards which are capable of writing (apparently) handwritten messages fed to them remotely, small printers which can print a spectator’s chosen number and feed the printed paper into an (apparently) sealed jar, and a host of other technological gadgets which make it appear that the mentalist predicted the spectator’s thought, when in fact he simply waited for it to be disclosed by the spectator and then created the evidence of his “prediction”.

===Pre-show work===

Many mentalism effects rely on pre-show work. This involves the mentalist or his assistant interacting with certain members of the audience before the performance begins. This can be in a pre-show reception, or in the auditorium itself as the audience take their seats, or even in the queue outside the performance venue before the performance. Pre-show work can take a number of forms. One type involves the mentalist talking to a spectator whom he will later, during his performance, involve in one of his effects. In this case the mentalist sets up the trick by covertly obtaining information from the spectator which he will later reveal during the performance. The interaction with the spectator may be made to seem like a casual “meet the audience” conversation, with no warning that the spectator is later to be involved in the performance. Alternatively, the mentalist may tell the spectator that he intends to involve her in his show. In that case the pre-show interaction is usually characterised as preparation “to save time during the show” or similar. Either way, the mentalist will use the occasion to obtain information from the spectator covertly for later revelation, either by traditional sleight of hand methods such as a billet peek, or by using electronic gimmickry such as a Parapad. Alternatively, the mentalist may ask the spectator to make a choice (eg a number, a playing card, a selection from a list of items) and to recall that choice when later asked to participate during the performance. Typically the spectator will believe she has a free choice, but in fact it will be a choice forced by the mentalist, This can be done in a number of ways. One popular method is a proprietary device called a Svenpad. This is a notepad in which every second page is imperceptibly shorter. The long pages each have written on them an item from a list of choices (eg film stars, holiday destinations etc), but the short pages each have the same item - the force choice - written on them. When riffled from front to back only the long pages are visible, showing the full range of different choices. But when riffled from back to front only the short pages are visible, each bearing the force selection. Other forcing methods include trick decks of cards, where all the cards are the same. During the performance itself, when the mentalist involves the spectator in his effect, he will usually aim by careful use of language to avoid any mention of the pre-show interaction to the wider audience, either by himself or the chosen spectator. His aim is to suggest that he and the spectator have not previously met. When the spectator’s covertly obtained information or forced choice is revealed, this greatly enhances the effect from the point of view of the wider audience. It will usually seem that the mentalist has elicited a wholly uncommunicated thought from a random audience member. The chosen spectator herself, having participated in the pre-show encounter, perceives a different and less spectacular effect. This is an example of dual reality (discussed below) in mentalism.

===Suggestion===
This technique involves implanting an idea, thought, or impression in the mind of the spectator or participant. The mentalist does this by using subtle verbal cues, gestures, body language, and sometimes visual aids to influence their thoughts. For instance, asking someone to &quot;think of any card in a normal deck&quot; automatically plants the general idea of a playing card in their mind. Similarly, asking them to &quot;visualize the card clearly in your mind&quot; can put the image of a particular card in their imagination. 

===Misdirection===
Also known as diversion, this technique aims to divert the audience&#x27;s attention away from the secret method or process behind a mentalism effect. Magicians and mentalists frequently use grand gestures, animated movement, music, and chatter to distract attention from a sneaky maneuver that sets up the trick. For example, a mentalist may engage in lively conversation while secretly writing something on his palm. Or he may dramatically throw his jacket on a chair to cover up a hidden assistant in the audience.

===Cold reading===
This technique involves making calculated guesses and drawing logical conclusions about a person by carefully observing their appearance, responses, mannerisms, vocal tones, and other unconscious reactions. Mentalists leverage these cues along with high probability assumptions about human nature to come up with surprisingly accurate character insights and details about someone. They can then present this as if they magically knew the information through psychic powers. 

===Hot reading===
Hot reading refers to the practice of gathering background information about the audience or participants before doing a mentalism act or seance. Mentalists can then astonish spectators by revealing something they could not possibly have known otherwise. However, doing hot readings without informing the audience is considered unethical. Ethical mentalists only do hot readings if they explicitly disclose it, or do it for entertainment with the participant&#x27;s consent.

===Psychological manipulation===
Master mentalists have an in-depth understanding of human psychology which allows them to subtly manipulate thoughts, emotions, and behaviors. They use verbal suggestion, social pressure, visual cues and mental framing to influence perceptions and reactions. This lets them guide participants towards the responses, outcomes or choices they want. For instance, a mentalist may hint that choosing a certain number will lead to something positive.

===Dual reality===
This principle involves structuring a routine to present different experiences to the observer versus the participant. For example, a mentalist may have an audience member pick a &quot;random&quot; card that is actually forced by the mentalist&#x27;s assistant. The participant believes they freely chose any card, while the audience knows it&#x27;s manipulated.

===Subtle artistry===
The most skilled mentalists ensure their performances seem completely natural, organic and unrehearsed even though they are carefully planned. They structure their acts, patter and effects to come across as pure luck, coincidence or chance rather than as clever illusions or tricks. This &#x27;invisible&#x27; artistry maintains the mystique around mentalist performances.

==Performance approaches==
Styles of mentalist presentation can vary greatly. In this vein, Penn &amp; Teller
explain that &quot;[m]entalism is a genre of magic that exists across a spectrum of morality.&quot; In the past, at times, some performers such as Alexander and Uri Geller have promoted themselves as genuine psychics. 

Some contemporary performers, such as Derren Brown, explain that their results and effects are from using natural skills, including the ability to master magic techniques and showmanship, read body language, and influence audiences with psychological principles, such as suggestion. In this vein, Brown explains that he presents and stages &quot;psychological experiments&quot; through his performances. Mentalist and psychic entertainer Banachek also rejects that he possesses any supernatural or actual psychic powers, having worked with the James Randi Educational Foundation for many years to investigate and debunk fake psychics. He is clear with the public that the effects and experiences he creates through his stage performance are the result of his highly developed performance skills and magic techniques, combined with psychological principles and tactics.

Max Maven often presented his performances as creating interactive mysteries and explorations of the mysterious dimensions of the human mind. He is described as a &quot;mentalist and master magician&quot; as well as a &quot;mystery theorist.&quot; Other mentalists and allied performers also promote themselves as &quot;mystery entertainers&quot;.

There are mentalists, including Maurice Fogel, Kreskin, Chan Canasta, and David Berglas, who make no specific claims about how effects are achieved and may leave it up to the audience to decide, creating what has been described as &quot;a wonderful sense of ambiguity about whether they possess true psychic ability or not.&quot;

Contemporary mentalists often take their shows onto the streets and perform tricks to a live, unsuspecting audience. They do this by approaching random members of the public and ask to demonstrate so-called supernatural powers. However, some performers such as Derren Brown who often adopt this method of performance tell their audience before the trick starts that everything they see is an illusion and that they are not really &quot;having their mind read.&quot; This has been the cause of a lot of controversy in the sphere of magic as some mentalists want their audience to believe that this type of magic is &quot;real&quot; while others think that it is morally wrong to lie to a spectator.

==Distinction from magicians==

Professional mentalists generally do not mix &quot;standard&quot; magic tricks with their mental feats. Doing so associates mentalism too closely with the theatrical trickery employed by stage magicians. Many mentalists claim not to be magicians at all, arguing that it is a different art form altogether. The argument is that mentalism invokes belief and imagination that, when presented properly, may allow the audience to interpret a given effect as &quot;real&quot; or may at least provide enough ambiguity that it is unclear whether it is actually possible to somehow achieve. This lack of certainty about the limits of what is real may lead individuals in an audience to reach different conclusions and beliefs about mentalist performers&#x27; claims – be they about their various so-called psychic abilities, photographic memory, being a &quot;human calculator&quot;, power of suggestion, NLP, or other skills. In this way, mentalism may play on the senses and a spectator&#x27;s perception or understanding of reality in a different way than conjuring techniques utilized in stage magic.

Magicians often ask the audience to suspend their disbelief, ignore natural laws, and allow their imagination to play with the various tricks they present. They admit that they are tricksters from the outset, and they know that the audience understands that everything is an illusion. Everyone knows that the magician cannot really achieve the impossible feats shown, such as sawing a person in half and putting them back together, but that level of certainty does not generally exist among the mentalist&#x27;s audience. Still, other mentalists believe it is unethical to portray their powers as real, adopting the same presentation philosophy as most magicians. These mentalists are honest about their deceptions, with some referring to this as &quot;theatrical mentalism&quot;.

However, some magicians do still mix mentally-themed performance with magic illusions. For example, a mind-reading stunt might also involve the magical transposition of two different objects. Such hybrid feats of magic are often called &quot;mental magic&quot; by performers. Magicians who routinely mix magic with mental magic include David Copperfield, David Blaine, The Amazing Kreskin, and Dynamo.

== Historical figures ==
Mentalism techniques have, on occasion, been allegedly used outside the entertainment industry to influence the actions of prominent people for personal and/or political gain. Famous examples of accused practitioners include:
* Erik Jan Hanussen, alleged to have influenced Adolf Hitler
* Grigori Rasputin, alleged to have influenced Tsaritsa Alexandra
* Wolf Messing, alleged to have influenced Joseph Stalin
* Count Alessandro di Cagliostro, accused of influencing members of the French aristocracy in the Affair of the Diamond Necklace
In Albert Einstein&#x27;s preface to Upton Sinclair&#x27;s 1930 book on telepathy, &quot;Mental Radio&quot;, he supported his friend&#x27;s endeavor to test the abilities of purported psychics and skeptically suggested: &quot;So if somehow the facts here set forth rest not upon telepathy, but upon some unconscious hypnotic influence from person to person, this also would be of high psychological interest.&quot; As such, Einstein here alluded to techniques of modern mentalism.

==In popular culture==

<text>was a Japanese visual kei folk rock band. They were originally signed to the now defunct Key Party Records under the name &quot;Crow&quot;. The group changed its name when they signed to PS Company in 2000.

==History== 
The band&#x27;s major debut was in 2004 with the single &quot;Urei&quot;. Kagrra,&#x27;s concept is &quot;Neo Japanesque&quot;. Their lyrics were in the style of Heian era poetry, their costumes frequently incorporated traditional Japanese clothing styles, and traditional Japanese instruments and drum rhythms were used in some of their songs. On November 10, 2010, it was announced that Kagrra, would be disbanding after ten years together. As a final request, the members asked that fans refer to it as a &quot;demise&quot; rather than a disbandment. The band released one last CD and held a final tour. The CD, entitled &quot;Hyakki Kenran&quot;, was released on February 2, 2011. Their final tour began on February 13, 2011 and ended on March 3, 2011 at the Shibuya C.C. Lemon Hall in Tokyo.

On July 25, 2011, it was announced that vocalist Isshi died in his home on July 18, 2011. He was 32 years old.

<text>The Tudor rose (sometimes called the Union rose) is the traditional floral heraldic emblem of England and takes its name and origins from the House of Tudor, which united the House of Lancaster and the House of York. The Tudor rose consists of five white inner petals, representing the House of York, and five red outer petals to represent the House of Lancaster.

==Origins==

In the Battle of Bosworth Field (1485), Henry VII, of the House of Lancaster, took the crown of England from Richard III, of the House of York. He thus brought to an end the retrospectively dubbed &quot;Wars of the Roses&quot;. Kings of the House of Lancaster had sometimes used a red or gold rose as a badge; and the House of York had used a white rose as a badge. Henry&#x27;s father was Edmund Tudor, and his mother was Margaret Beaufort from the House of Lancaster; in January 1486 he married Elizabeth of York to bring the two factions together. (In battle, Richard III fought under the banner of the boar, and Henry under the banner of the dragon of his native Wales.) The white rose versus red rose juxtaposition was mostly Henry&#x27;s invention, created to exploit his appeal as a &#x27;peacemaker king&#x27;. The historian Thomas Penn writes:

On his marriage, Henry VII adopted the Tudor rose badge conjoining the White Rose of York and the Red Rose of Lancaster. The Tudor rose is occasionally seen divided in quarters (heraldically as &quot;quartered&quot;) and vertically (in heraldic terms &quot;per pale&quot;) red and white. More often, the Tudor rose is depicted as a double rose, white on red and is always described, heraldically, as &quot;proper&quot; (that is, naturally-coloured, despite not actually existing in nature).

===Historical uses===

Henry VII was reserved in his usage of the Tudor rose. He regularly used the Lancastrian rose by itself, being the house to which he descended. His successor Henry VIII, descended from the House of York as well through his mother, would use the rose more often.

When Arthur, Prince of Wales, died in 1502, his tomb in Worcester Cathedral used both roses; thereby asserting his royal descent from both the houses of Lancaster and York.

During his reign, Henry VIII had the legendary &quot;Round Table&quot; at Winchester Castle – then believed to be genuine – repainted. The new paint scheme included a Tudor rose in the centre. Previous to this, his father Henry VII had built the Henry VII Chapel at Westminster Abbey (it was later used for the site of his tomb) and it was decorated principally with the Tudor rose and the Beaufort portcullis – as a form of propaganda to define his claim to the throne.

The Tudor rose badge may appear &quot;slipped and crowned&quot;: shown as a cutting with a stem and leaves beneath a crown; this badge appears in Nicholas Hilliard&#x27;s &quot;Pelican Portrait&quot; of Elizabeth I and since an Order in Council (dated 5 November 1800), has served as the royal floral emblem of England.

The Tudor rose may also appear &quot;dimidiated&quot; (cut in half and combined with half another emblem) to form a compound badge. The Westminster Tournament Roll includes a badge of Henry and his first wife Catherine of Aragon with a slipped Tudor rose conjoined with Catherine&#x27;s personal badge, the Spanish pomegranate; their daughter Mary I bore the same badge. Following his ascent to the English throne, James VI of Scotland and I of England used a badge consisting of a Tudor rose dimidiated with a Scottish thistle and surmounted by a royal crown.

===Contemporary uses===

The crowned and slipped Tudor rose is used as the plant badge of England, as Scotland uses the thistle, Wales uses the leek, and Ireland uses the shamrock (Northern Ireland sometimes using flax instead). As such, it is seen on the dress uniforms of the Yeomen Warders at the Tower of London, and of the Yeomen of the Guard. It features in the design of the 20-pence coin minted between 1982 and 2008, and in the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. It also features on the coat of arms of Canada.

As part of the badge of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, the Tudor rose represents England alongside the floral badges of the other constituent parts of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.

The heraldic badge of the Royal Navy&#x27;s current flagship aircraft carrier HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; uses a Tudor rose with colours divided vertically (&quot;per pale&quot;), inheriting the heraldry of the early twentieth century super-dreadnought oil-fired fast battleship HMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;. The Tudor rose makes up part of the cap badge of the Intelligence Corps of the British Army. The Tudor rose is used as the emblem of The Nautical Training Corps, a uniformed youth organisation founded in Brighton in 1944 with 20 units in South East England. The corps badge has the Tudor Rose on the shank of an anchor with the motto &quot;For God, Queen and Country&quot;. It is also used as part of the Corps&#x27; cap badge.

The Tudor rose is also prominent in a number of towns and cities. The Royal Town of Sutton Coldfield, uses the emblem frequently, due to the town being given Royal Town status by Henry VIII. The Tudor rose appears on the coat of arms of Oxford. It is also notably used (albeit in a monochromatic form) as the symbol of VisitEngland, England&#x27;s tourist board. A half-and-half design was used as the &quot;Border Rose&quot; in some parts of Todmorden, a conurbation that was historically bisected by the Yorkshire-Lancashire border.

The borough and county of Queens in New York City uses a Tudor rose on its flag and seal. The flag and seal of Annapolis, Maryland, features a Tudor rose and a thistle surmounted with a crown. The city of York, South Carolina is nicknamed &quot;The White Rose City&quot;, and the nearby city of Lancaster, South Carolina is nicknamed &quot;The Red Rose City&quot;. York, Pennsylvania and Lancaster, Pennsylvania are similarly nicknamed, using stylized white and red roses in their emblems, respectively.

There are ten tudor roses present on the crest of the England national football team.

<doc id="1101509" wikidata="Q16037688" url="?curid=1101509" title="James Cullen (PTAA)">
<text>James Aloysius Cullen (23 October 1841 New Ross County Wexford – 6 December 1921 Dublin) was an Irish Catholic priest who founded the Irish &quot;Messenger of the Sacred Heart&quot; and the Pioneer Total Abstinence Association (PTAA)

==Life==
James Aloysius Cullen was born the 23 October 1841 New Ross County Wexford and received his early schooling at the school of the Christian School Brothers in his native village before entering the Jesuit High School of Clongowes Woods in 1856. Believing that Jesuits were involved only in educational work, in 1861 he chose to enter the seminary (St. Patrick&#x27;s, Carlow College) for the diocese of Ferns for which he was ordained priest on 28 October 1864, in Carlow. He was appointed curate in Wexford, where he introduced the Christmascrib. From there, he was assigned in 1866 to Enniscorthy. It was there, Cullen first became concerned with men spending their money on drink. He worked with local businessmen to improve housing for boatmen carrying goods between Enniscorthy and Wexford.

He entered the Society of Jesus in 1881 and took his first vows at Milltown Park in 1883. After studies in Louvain, Belgium, he returned to Dublin, where, he served as vice-rector at Belvedere College. In 1884, he was appointed spiritual father at Belvedere, a position he retained for twenty years while also engaged in other ministry.
===James Joyce===
Cullen was founder and director of the Sodality of Our Lady at the college, which duties included counseling students. In 1896, James Joyce was elected Student Prefect of the Society. Although not officially an instructor, he impressed on them that &quot;the Old Testament Hebrews were the spiritual fathers of Christianity&quot;. According to Neil R. Davison, the sermons in Chapter III of &quot;A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man&quot; are modeled on those given by Cullen during a retreat held in 1897.

===Apostleship of Prayer===
In November 1887, Cullen was appointed director for Ireland of the Apostleship of Prayer, to spread devotion to the Sacred Heart. To that end, in 1888, he founded the Irish &quot;Messenger of the Sacred Heart&quot;, which he saw as a means to promote temperance, by presenting temperance as an expression of one&#x27;s devotion to the Sacred Heart. Though primarily a vehicle for the promotion of devotion to the Sacred Heart, Cullen also utilized &quot;The Messenger&quot; for the propagation of devotion to Mary.
In February 1892, Cullen travelled to the Cape Colony of South Africa and kept a lengthy diary with a view to future articles in &quot;The Messenger&quot;. While there, he preached missions and gave retreats.

===PTAA===
In 1898 he founded the PTAA. An extremely devout, if rather gloomy, man, he was a good organiser, who worked with great energy over many years to perfect the institution he had created. In 1899 he returned to the Cape Colony, and gave a retreat, to a British regiment. In 1904, Cullen was transferred to Gardiner Street and removed from the editorship of &quot;The Messenger&quot;. He focused his efforts on the Pioneer League and built St Francis Xavier&#x27;s Hall, where he organised drama societies, Irish language classes, debates and other activities to enrich the lives of the people. He was a supporter of the Gaelic League.

Cullen died in Dublin 6 December 1921.

<text>Infoseek (also known as the &quot;big yellow&quot;) was an American internet search engine founded in 1994 by Steve Kirsch.

Infoseek was originally operated by the Infoseek Corporation, headquartered in Sunnyvale, California. Infoseek was bought by The Walt Disney Company in 1999, and the technology was merged with that of the Disney-acquired Starwave to form the Go.com network.

==History==

Infoseek launched in January 1994 as a pay-for-use service. The service was dropped in August 1994 and Infoseek was relaunched as Infoseek search in February 1995.

In 1995, Infoseek struck a deal with Netscape to become the default search engine on Netscape Navigator.

On June 11, 1996, Infoseek&#x27;s initial public offering started trading on Nasdaq (under the name SEEK) at $12 per share.

By September 1997, Infoseek had 7.3 million visitors per month. It was the 7th most visited website that year (5th in 1996) and 10th in 1998. Infoseek acquired the WebChat Broadcasting System in April 1998.

In 1998, Disney purchased a 43% stake of Infoseek, and incorporated the site into its various media businesses. Around the same time, Disney acquired the Starwave Corporation, which included ESPN.com and ABCNews.com. In 1999, Disney acquired the remaining Infoseek stock it didn&#x27;t own. Disney bundled its Starwave properties and Infoseek and formed the GO.com portal.

Infoseek was among the first search engines to sell advertising on a CPM, Cost Per Thousand Impressions, basis. In 1997, the first Cost Per Click programs, as well as the precursor to pop-ups called daughter windows, was sold to Grey Advertising for a Procter &amp; Gamble Pampers campaign.

In 1998, Infoseek was the first internet company to develop and launch behavioral targeting via its UltraMatch targeting algorithms. In 1999, Infoseek engineer Li Yanhong moved to Beijing, China and co-founded the search engine Baidu. In February 2001, Disney decided to cancel the service and lay off all staff. Also in 2001, Bernt Wahl, Andy Bensky and 15 software engineers, all Infoseek employees, led a management buyout attempt from Disney but were ultimately rebuffed.

===Post-demise===
Infoseek&#x27;s Ultraseek Server software technology, an enterprise search engine product, was sold in 2000 to Inktomi. Under Inktomi, Ultraseek Server was renamed &quot;Inktomi Enterprise Search&quot;. In December 2002 (prior to the Yahoo! acquisition of Inktomi), the Ultraseek product suite was sold to a competitor Verity Inc, who re-established the Ultraseek brand name and continued development of the product.

Rakuten agreed in November 2000 to acquire Infoseek Japan for $81 million.

In December 2005, Verity was acquired by Autonomy PLC. Under Autonomy, Ultraseek ceased to be a stand-alone product and became a modular component under the IDOL platform. It continued to be developed and marketed as Autonomy&#x27;s entry-level keyword-based site search offering until after Autonomy was acquired by Hewlett-Packard (HP) in October 2011.

==Domain name==
The &quot;infoseek.com&quot; domain name redirects to &quot;go.com&quot; and the Infoseek brand name is no longer used in North America. However, the Australian domain and the Japanese domain still operate with the Infoseek name. The Japanese domain name now operates as a web portal known as &quot;Rakuten Infoseek&quot;.

<text>Hercynite is a spinel mineral with the formula FeAl2O4.

It occurs in high-grade metamorphosed iron-rich argillaceous (clay-containing) sediments as well as in mafic and ultramafic igneous rocks. Due to its hardness it also is found in placers.

It was first described in 1847 and its name originates from the Latin name for the Harz, Silva Hercynia, where the species was first found.

Hercynite is a spinel of regular symmetry and normal cation distribution, but some disorder occurs in its structure. It consists of ferrous (Fe2+) ions and aluminium ions (Al3+); however some ferric ions (Fe3+) may be located in the structure of hercynite.

Melting point of this mineral is inbetween .

<doc id="1101524" wikidata="Q1568400" url="?curid=1101524" title="Ralph Hotere">
<text>Hone Papita Raukura &quot;Ralph&quot; Hotere (11 August 1931 – 24 February 2013) was a New Zealand artist. He was born in Mitimiti, Northland and is widely regarded as one of New Zealand&#x27;s most important artists. In 1994 he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Otago and in 2003 received an Icon Award from the Arts Foundation of New Zealand.

In the 2012 New Year Honours, Hotere was appointed to the Order of New Zealand for services to New Zealand.

==Early history==
Hotere was born in Mitimiti, close to the Hokianga Harbour in the Northland Region, one of 15 children. When Hotere was 9, his older brother Jack enlisted in the army. Jack was killed in action in Italy in 1943.

Hotere received his secondary education at Hato Petera College, Auckland, where he studied from 1946 to 1949. After early art training at the Auckland Teachers&#x27; Training College under the tutelage of J. D. Charlton Edgar, he moved to Dunedin in 1952, where he studied at Dunedin School of Art, part of King Edward Technical College. During the later 1950s, he worked as a schools art advisor for the Education Department in the Bay of Islands.

In 1961 Hotere gained a New Zealand Art Societies Fellowship and travelled to England where he studied at the Central School of Art and Design in London. During 1962–1964 he studied in France and travelled around Europe, during which time he witnessed the development of the Pop Art and Op Art movements. His travels took him, among other places, to the war cemetery in Italy where his brother was buried. This event, and the politics of Europe during the 1960s, had a profound effect on Hotere&#x27;s work, notably in the &quot;Sangro&quot; series of paintings.

==Return to New Zealand==
Hotere returned to New Zealand and exhibited in Dunedin in 1965, and returned to the city in 1969 when he became the University of Otago&#x27;s Frances Hodgkins Fellow. At about that time he began to introduce literary elements to his work. He worked with poets such as Hone Tuwhare and Bill Manhire to produce several strong paintings, and produced other works specifically for the New Zealand literary journal &quot;Landfall&quot;. Hotere also worked in collaboration with other prominent artists, notably Bill Culbert. Hotere moved to Carey&#x27;s Bay in Port Chalmers in 1969, spending most of his life in the town.

From the 1970s onward, Hotere was noted for his use of unusual tools and materials in creating his work, notably the use of power tools on corrugated iron and steel within the context of two-dimensional art.
==Black paintings==

From 1968, Hotere began the series of works with which he is perhaps best known, the &quot;Black Paintings&quot;. In these works, black is used almost exclusively. In some works, strips of colour are placed against stark black backgrounds in a style reminiscent of Barnett Newman. In other black paintings, stark simple crosses appear in the gloom, black on black. Though minimalist, the works, as with those of most good abstractionists, have a redolent poetry of their own. The simple markings speak of transcendence, of religion, or peace.

===&quot;Black Phoenix&quot;===
The themes of the black paintings extended to later works, notably the colossal &quot;Black Phoenix&quot; (1984–88), constructed out of the burnt remains of a fishing boat. This major installation incorporates the prow of the boat flanked by burnt planks of wood. Other planks form a pathway leading the prow. Each plank has had a strip laid bare to reveal the natural wood underneath beneath. Several of the boards are inscribed with a traditional Maori proverb, &quot;Ka hinga atu he tete-kura haramai he tete-kura&quot; (&quot;As one fern frond (person) dies - one is born to take its place&quot;). A slight change has been made in the wording of the proverb, replacing &quot;haramai&quot; (transfer, pass over) to &quot;ara mai&quot; (the path forward), possibly indicating the cleared pathway of bare wood in front of the boat&#x27;s burnt prow. The work measures 5m by 13m by 5.5m.

==Political art==
Politics were entwined in the subject matter of Hotere&#x27;s art from an early stage. Hotere&#x27;s &quot;Polaris&quot; series was a response to the 1984 threat of nuclear warheads due to the &quot;Polaris&quot; programme. When Aramoana, a wetland near his Port Chalmers home, was proposed as the site for an aluminium smelter, Hotere was vocal in his opposition, and produced the &quot;Aramoana&quot; series of paintings. Similarly, he produced series protesting against a controversial rugby tour by New Zealand of apartheid-era South Africa (&quot;Black Union Jack&quot;) in 1981, and the sinking of the Greenpeace flagship &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; (&quot;Black rainbow&quot;) in 1985. Later, his reactions to Middle East politics resulted in works such as &quot;Jerusalem, Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;This might be a double cross jack&quot;.

== Later life ==

In 1992, Hotere transformed the RKS Gallery in Wellington with an exhibition utilising kilometres of number 8 wire.

Hotere&#x27;s work was slowed by a stroke in 2001, but he continued to create and exhibit regularly until his death in February 2013.

A documentary film of the artist&#x27;s life and work, &quot;Hotere&quot;, was released by Paradise Films in 2001, in association with Creative New Zealand and the New Zealand Film Commission. Written and directed by Merata Mita, the documentary made its overseas debut at the 2002 Sundance Film Festival.

==Personal life==
Hotere was of Māori descent (Te Aupōuri and Te Rarawa).

He married three times, with two of his wives also being artists. His second wife was artist and poet Cilla McQueen, whom he married in 1973, and with whom he moved to Careys Bay near Port Chalmers in 1974. The two separated amicably during the 1990s. Hotere later married Mary McFarlane, another notable artist, in February 2002.

Hotere died on 24 February 2013, aged 81 and was survived by his daughter Andrea, three mokopuna (grandchildren) and also his third wife Mary. He was buried at Mitimiti.

==Hotere Garden Oputae==
Hotere&#x27;s former studio was on land at the tip of Observation Point, the large bluff overlooking the Port Chalmers container terminal. When the port&#x27;s facilities were expanded, part of the bluff was removed, including the area of Hotere&#x27;s studio (after strenuous objection from many of the town&#x27;s residents). Part of the bluff close to the removed portion is now an award-winning sculpture garden, the &quot;Hotere Garden Oputae&quot;, organised in 2005 by Hotere and featuring works by both him and by other noted New Zealand modern sculptors. Other sculptors with work in the garden include Russell Moses, Shona Rapira Davies, and Chris Booth.

<doc id="1101529" wikidata="Q16932934" url="?curid=1101529" title="Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States">
<text>The &quot;Plan for Establishing Uniformity in the Coinage, Weights, and Measures of the United States&quot; was a report submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives on July 13, 1790, by Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson.

At the First United States Congress, which met in 1789 when the decimal metric system had not yet been developed in France, the system of units to be used in the U.S. was one point of discussion. Under the Constitution (article I, section 8), the Congress has the constitutional right to decide on a standard of weights and measures. On January 8, 1790, George Washington urged Congress to address the need for the uniform system of weights and measures, and on January 15, 1790, the House of Representatives requested Thomas Jefferson to draw up a plan.

The decimal dollar had already been agreed upon in principle in 1785, but would not be implemented until after the enactment of the Coinage Act of 1792. After correspondence with William Waring and others, Jefferson proposed two systems of units in mid-1790. The first was evolutionary, and was based on refinement of the definitions of the units of the existing English system, as well as simplification of their relationship to each other. The second system was revolutionary, and was based on units linked by powers of ten, very similar to the decimal metric system which would be proposed in France. The base units for length, mass, and volume in Jefferson&#x27;s revolutionary system (named the foot, the ounce, and the bushel, respectively) were relatively close in size to their pre-existing counterparts and bore identical names, although the manner in which they were defined was very different.

Jefferson&#x27;s proposal was the world&#x27;s first scientifically based, fully integrated, decimal system of weights and measures.

==The seconds pendulum basis==
In coordination with scientists in France, Jefferson selected the seconds pendulum at 45° latitude as the basic reference. For technical reasons, he proposed using a uniform rod as the pendulum rather than a traditional pendulum. The pendulum was estimated to be 39.14912 English inches long (which at that time was not yet defined to be exactly 25.4 mm, of course), or 1.5 times that for a vibrating rod (58.72368 inches).

==More traditional proposal==
In the evolutionary approach, the foot was to be derived from these lengths by a simple integer factor, which would be either three (pendulum) or five (rod), i.e. lengthening it from the traditional value of about 304 mm by slightly over 1 inch to ca. 331 mm or shortening it by about a quarter of an inch to ca. 298 mm. For practical purposes he wanted the rod to be (new) inches long, an increase of less than 0.045%.

For the mass units, the ounce as a base would equal the weight of one thousandth of a cubic foot of rain water at standard temperature.

Although the rundlet is mentioned as an existing measure for liquids equivalent to a kilderkin, it was omitted from the list of redefinitions.

==Decimal system based on the foot==
Jefferson&#x27;s proposed decimal system preceded the adoption in France of the decimal metric system, although both developed simultaneously. In France, the metre was to be defined as the ten-millionth part of an arc between the North Pole and the equator. Jefferson&#x27;s system was based on the length of a rod oscillating seconds at 45 degrees latitude, with the foot defined as one fifth of the length of such a rod. Similar to the French system, Jefferson proposed a system of units linked directly by powers of ten. However, Jefferson&#x27;s system did not make use of the concept of prefixes, which were of great importance in the French system. Instead, the names of old units were carried over into the new system for decimal multiples of the base units, giving them new values.

Asserting the value of such thorough reform to the existing system of weights and measures, the report stated:
The following table lists the units of the Jeffersonian decimal system, and their relationship with one another. The values of these units are based on Jefferson&#x27;s proposal of a foot that was equal in length to one-fifth of a second rod, one fourth of an inch shorter than the foot in use at the time, and approximately equal to 0.298461684 m.
For the mass units, the ounce as a base would equal the weight of a cubic inch of pure water at standard temperature.

The transcript of the original document gives the value of a kental as 16 stones at one point and 10 stones in another point. 10 was presumably the intended value, given the otherwise consistent decimalization.

==Subsequent developments==
Under the United States Constitution, Article 1 Section 8, Congress shall have power &quot;To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and of foreign Coin, and fix the Standard of Weights and Measures&quot;. In his first annual message to Congress (what later came to be called &quot;State of the Union Addresses&quot;) on January 8, 1790 (a few months before Jefferson&#x27;s report to the House of Representatives), George Washington stated, &quot;Uniformity in the currency, weights, and measures of the United States is an object of great importance, and will, I am persuaded, be duly attended to.&quot;

Washington repeated similar calls for action in his second and third annual messages (after Jefferson&#x27;s report). Jefferson&#x27;s decimal proposal had the support of Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, James Monroe, and George Washington. Robert Morris was a powerful opponent of the proposal. In late 1791 the Senate appointed a committee to report on the subject and make recommendations. The committee reported in April 1792, unanimously endorsing Jefferson&#x27;s decimal system. The Senate was slow to act on the matter and while they delayed events in France complicated the issue. Although French scientists working on a decimal system had originally supported using the seconds pendulum as a scientific basis, and Jefferson had deliberately matched his seconds pendulum proposal to the French one, based on a measurement at the latitude of Paris, the French decided to use the length of a meridian of the Earth instead of a seconds pendulum. This and other developments changed what had promised to be an internationally developed system into a strictly French project. Jefferson wrote, &quot;The element of measure adopted by the National Assembly excludes, &quot;ipso facto&quot;, every nation on earth from a communion of measurement with them.&quot;

The Senate continued to consider Jefferson&#x27;s two proposals, along with a number of new proposals, for several years. In 1795, a bill titled &quot;An Act directing certain experiments to be made to ascertain uniform standards of weights and measures for the United States&quot; was passed by the House and was approved by committee in the Senate, but on the last day of the session the Senate said it would consider the bill during the next session. The bill was never taken up again. In 1795, the Northwest Indian War, which for years had prevented the surveying and sale of land in the Northwest Territory came to an end. A land rush of settlers, surveyors, squatters, and others rapidly pushed into the region and the federal government had a sudden and intense need to establish a method for surveying and selling land. On May 18, 1796, Congress passed &quot;an Act for the sale of land of the United States in the territory northwest of the River Ohio, and above the mouth of the Kentucky River&quot;. This law defined a survey grid system of 6–mile–square townships divided into 1–mile–square sections, with the defining unit being the chain, specifically Gunter&#x27;s chain. This was the first unit of measurement designated into law by Congress. This law and the way it defined the survey grid ended debate over Jefferson&#x27;s decimal system.

== Origins ==

The proposal by William Waring from 30 January 1790 was similarly decimalized as Jefferson&#x27;s more radical proposal, but introduces many new names for units and its base is the equatorial seconds pendulum, i.e. determined at 0° not 45°, called &quot;pend&quot; or &quot;federal ell&quot;. A &quot;federal gallon&quot; of 0.004 cubic pends, i.e. slightly less than 4 liters and thus similar in size to the English wine gallon, is suggested as a more traditional base for liquid measures; and 9 such gallons, since almost equal to a Winchester bushel, or, more systematically, 10 gallons would form the base for dry measures. Inspired by the Avoirdupois system defining 1 cubic foot of water to weigh 1000 ounces of which there are 16 to the pound, Waring suggests a &quot;federal pound&quot; of half a cubic hand of water, which would be just short of 0.5 kg.

<doc id="1101531" wikidata="Q234280" url="?curid=1101531" title="Meccan surah">
<text>A Meccan surah is, according to the timing and contextual background of their revelation (&quot;asbāb al-nuzūl&quot;) within Islamic tradition, a chronologically earlier chapter (&quot;suwar&quot;, singular &quot;sūrah&quot;) of the Qur&#x27;an. The traditional chronological order attributed to Ibn Abbas became widely accepted following its adoption by the 1924 Egyptian standard edition. The Meccan chapters are believed to have been revealed anytime before the migration of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and his followers from Mecca to Medina (&quot;Hijra&quot;). The Medinan surahs are those revelations which occurred after the move. There are 86 makkan surahs.

Meccan surahs are typically shorter than Medinan surahs, with relatively short verses (&quot;āyāt&quot;), and mostly come near the end of the Qur&#x27;an. (As a general rule, the chapters of the Qur&#x27;an are ordered from longest to shortest.) Most of the chapters containing Muqatta&#x27;at are Meccan, Except 2, 3 and 13.

The chapters are divided into &quot;Meccan&quot; and &quot;Medinan&quot; sections mostly due to stylistic and thematic factors. Classification of the chapters into these periods is based upon factors such as the length of the verse and the presence or absence of certain key concepts or words (e.g., &quot;al-Rahman&quot; as the name of God).

==Characteristics of Meccan surahs==
Following are some characteristics of Meccan verses, No 7 and 8 are stylistic characteristics, and the last 4 are content and subject characteristics:
* Any chapter that has a verse that commands to prostrate to Allah (آيات السجدة) is Meccan, except chapters 13 and 22.
* Any chapter that contains the word kalla كلا (never) is Meccan, and are found only in the second half of the Qur&#x27;an.
* Any chapter that has the phrase يأيها الناس &quot;O individual&quot;, but does not have the phrase يأيها اللذين آمنوا O you who believe is Meccan except chapter 22.
* Any chapter that start with initial letters muqattaat are Meccan, except chapters 2,3 and 13.
* Any chapter that relates the story of Adam and Iblis (i.e., Satan) is Meccan, except chapter 2.
* Any chapter that relates the stories of previous prophets and their people is Meccan, except chapter 2.
* Short verses, and strong rhetorical style and rhythmic sound.
* Repeated use of emphasis, exhortation, analogies and oath.
* Emphasis on the belief in Allah, the Day of Judgement and description of Hell and Heaven (paradise), except Chapter 2.
* Call for adherence to good moral and universal characters like truthfulness, kindness to relatives, old and neighbour, etc.
* Argument with the polytheists and refutation of their associating partners with Allah.
* Warning the polytheists through stories of previous messengers when punishment came to their people when they rejected their message.

==Chronological order of Meccan surahs==
One chronological order proposed by Abu al-Qasim `Umar ibn Muhammad ibn `Abd al-Kafi and considered the &quot;traditional order&quot; consists of 86 chapters, as follows:
:96, 68, 73, 74, 1, 111, 81, 87, 92, 89,
:93, 94, 103, 100, 108, 102, 107, 109, 105, 113,
:114, 112, 53, 80, 97, 91, 85, 95, 106, 101,
:75, 104, 77, 50, 90, 86, 54, 38, 7, 72,
:36, 25, 35, 19, 20, 56, 26, 27, 28, 17,
:10, 11, 12, 15, 6, 37, 31, 34, 39, 40,
:41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 51, 88, 18, 16,
:71, 14, 21, 23, 32, 52, 67, 69, 70, 78,
:79, 82, 84, 30, 29, 83.

Theodor Nöldeke proposed a different chronological order, later known as the Nöldeke-Schwally chronology, consisting of 90 chapters, as follows:
*from the first to the fifth year of Mohammed&#x27;s mission
:96, 74, 111, 106, 108, 104, 107, 102, 105, 92,
:90, 94, 93, 97, 86, 91, 80, 68, 87, 95,
:103, 85, 73, 101, 99, 82, 81, 53, 84, 100,
:79, 77, 78, 88, 89, 75, 83, 69, 51, 52,
:56, 70, 112, 109, 113, 114, 1
*the fifth and sixth year of his mission:
:54, 37, 71, 76, 44, 50, 20, 26, 15, 19,
:38, 36, 43, 72, 67, 23, 21, 25, 17, 27, 18
*from the seventh year to Hijra:
:32, 41, 45, 16, 30, 11, 14, 12, 40, 28,
:39, 29, 31, 42, 10, 34, 35, 7, 46, 6.

== First Meccan surahs ==
The First Meccan period refers to the first period in which Muhammad started receiving revelations. The First Meccan surahs are chapters that have been revealed throughout that period. They reflect the public setting in which they seem to have been shared and due to their structure and length, they seem to be presented in a manner that would be very easy to memorize and pass along orally, not to mention that many of the surahs seem to be used during early liturgies. They are relatively shorter than other chapters in the Quran but are more diverse in terms of structure. Compared to other later surahs, the surahs of the First Meccan Period employ more rhymes despite their shorter length. They rank from being very short, a paragraph of less than five verses (for example surah 97, 103, 105, 108 and 111) to being organized in clusters of two (surahs 81, 91), three (surahs 82, 84, 86, 90, 92) or four verses (surahs 85, 89). Some of these surahs also take on a balanced tripartite structure that begin and conclude with. The major theme of these surahs revolves around presenting to humanity how obvious the existence of God is through the use of oath formulas involving the power of nature in an emphatic tone. We especially see the surahs reference destroyed civilizations, declaring their destruction to be the will of God. A stress is put on God being the creator of Earth and Heaven and everything that lies in between and also His unreachable generosity. In addition, certain surahs generally talk about ethics and values human beings should have, especially the fact that human beings should be humbled by God&#x27;s power, they should not pursue an extravagant life, be loving and sharing, most particularly with the poorer. Last but not least these surahs contain eschatological prophecies. Although not elaborated as in later surahs, these prophecies appear with a threatening tone to make people generally know about the existence of the Day of Judgement and all that it encompasses (surah 103, 68, etc.), but also, they contain some of the more visual explanations of Heaven.

== Second Meccan surahs ==
There are 21 surahs in the second Meccan period. These surahs have, on average, ayah between twelve and twenty syllables in length. Some surahs have fewer than fifty ayah, while others, such as surah 20, &quot;Ta-Ha&quot;, have well over 100 verses. These surahs do not necessarily have distinct features, as the surahs of the first and third Meccan periods do, but instead display a blend of features from both earlier and later Meccan surahs. These middle surahs keep and expand upon the tripartite structure of the verse. According to Ernst, surahs that adhere to this structure (common in pre-Islamic Arab poetry) will have shorter first and third sections that parallel each other in scope and audience. The third section will &quot;normally conclude with a flourish.&quot; These parts bookend a somewhat larger middle section, which is &quot;typically a narrative of prophecy and struggle&quot;. These surahs also tend to use fewer oaths than earlier Meccan surahs, but take a much more confrontational approach in regards to the disbelievers. Some surahs in this period adopt a form resembling a monotheistic service, as is often seen in later Meccan surahs. For example, surah 20 begins with a section proclaiming the greatness of God, and then transitions immediately into a story about Moses. After the lengthy story concludes, several verses are devoted to explaining the meaning of the story, especially as it relates to the disbelievers. Due to the presence of elements from earlier and later Meccan surahs, surahs of the middle Meccan period exemplify the gradual development of the Qur&#x27;anic revelations over time, as Muhammad&#x27;s community slowly grew and changed. This is manifest in the fact that surahs of the second Meccan period tend toward self-referentiality, wherein the Qur&#x27;an uses &quot;qur&#x27;an&quot; (recitation or the Qu&#x27;ran) and &quot;kitaab&quot; (book) to make mention to its own existence (surahs 54, 37, 15, et al.), noting that indeed there is a holy message coming from God. Controversy from these verses have sprung up, wherein the question of the Word&#x27;s existence is debated. Some believe that the Qur&#x27;an existed/exists for all time with God, while others believe that the Qur&#x27;an was simply the Word for the Arab peoples of Muhammad from his prophecy onward.

==Third Meccan surahs==

This period is marked from the beginning of Muhammad&#x27;s public ministry to the Hijra, or the Abyssinian emigration. According to the Yusuf Ali translation, the Third Meccan period refers to the time period from the seventh year to the Hijra, approximately 619-622 A.D. This period is characterized by the persecution of Muhammad and the Muslims by the Quraysh as it expanded to his clan, the Hashem. To persuade the clan to relent their protection of Muhammad, the Quraysh boycotted the Hashem. Revelations from this period are characterized by descriptions of the resurrection, paradise, and Judgment Day. In this period, the tripartite structure is abandoned for longer and less complex structure, showing a form of collection that still remains a mystery to scholars. They contain mostly long addresses to the community of the believers (much larger by this time). Also Muhammad begins to be addressed directly by God instead of being used as merely the medium by which God&#x27;s message is transmitted.

Surahs of this period show the ways in which believers should act even when they face opposition and difficulties.

By the third Meccan period, sensuous imagery of full-bosomed, wide-eyed and virginal maidens have been replaced by references to spouses.
N78/E6o of the Third Meccan Period:
&#x27;whoever of their fathers, their spouses and offspring have acted honourably&#x27; 
By the Third Meccan period, Muhammad and the Muslims had gained sufficient support. In the early Meccan periods, these sensuous descriptions and temptations of voluptuous virgins were used to attract the attention of the Meccan pagans however by the Third Meccan period goals had been realigned not to attract pagans but to encourage and foster a law-abiding community centered around worshipping the Word of God.

In a complete reconstruction of the verses&#x27; chronology has been discussed.

<text>The Pioneer Total Abstinence Association of the Sacred Heart (PTAA) is an international organisation for Catholic teetotalers that is based in Ireland. Its members are commonly called Pioneers. While the PTAA does not advocate prohibition, it does require of its members complete abstinence from alcoholic drink. It also encourages devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus as an aid to resisting the temptation of alcohol. Pioneers wear a lapel pin called a &quot;Pioneer pin&quot; with an image of the Sacred Heart, both to advertise the organisation and to alert others not to offer them alcohol. The association publishes a monthly magazine, &quot;The Pioneer&quot;.

==History==
The PTAA was founded in 1898 by James Cullen, in response to widespread alcoholism among Irish Catholics as the earlier temperance movement of Father Mathew was fading from memory. In the 20th Century, the term &quot;Pioneer&quot; became synonymous with teetotalism among Irish Catholics, and the PTAA influenced public policy. In 1923, Eoin O&#x27;Duffy as Commissioner of the Garda Síochána (Civic Guard) encouraged members to join the PTAA, and allowed Gardaí to wear the Pioneer pin on their uniforms, in exemption to a general ban on symbols and adornments. The Irish Defence Forces also allow its personnel to wear the Pioneer pin on their uniforms, one of only two civilian symbols allowed to be worn in uniform, the other being the Fáinne. By 1948, the PTAA claimed 360,000 members. In 1956, a Commission of Enquiry into the licensing laws in the Republic of Ireland was appointed by the Minister for Justice, James Everett; the PTAA nominated one of the 22 members, John K. Clear. Clear assented to the majority report of the Commission, which favoured easing the (widely disregarded) restrictions on opening hours of public houses introduced in 1925, although the Catholic hierarchy subsequently opposed the resulting Act.

==Activity==
Roman Catholic children in Ireland who make their Confirmation (typically at the age of 11–12) are encouraged to promise, or &quot;take the pledge&quot;, not to drink alcohol until they are at least 18 (the legal drinking age in Ireland). The PTAA is active in this drive, and encourages teenagers, particularly in religious-run secondary schools, to join the PTAA and &quot;keep the pledge&quot;. In train with the growing secularisation of Irish society, members of the association are increasingly older people. Younger Catholics who choose not to drink alcohol are unlikely to belong to the PTAA.

The PTAA does not strive to simply stop people from drinking. It also aims to create opportunities for fun and social activities without the need for the presence of alcohol. It organises many competitions, such as table quizzes, &quot;Réadóirí&quot; (a talent competition; &quot;Réadóirí&quot; is the Irish word for Pioneers), and sports. Local centres (parishes or schools) compete in these competitions at regional (against local parishes), diocesan, provincial and all-Ireland level. The Pioneers also run two annual seminars, one for young pioneers (13-18), and one for older Pioneers (18+).

The Association issued an appeal for funds from its website in April 2011 in an effort to prevent closure because of the organisation&#x27;s indebtedness.

<text>Flag signals can mean any of various methods of using flags or pennants to send signals. Flags may have individual significance as signals, or two or more flags may be manipulated so that their relative positions convey symbols. Flag signals allowed communication at a distance before the invention of radio and are still used especially in connection with ships.

==Flaghoist signalling==

Flaghoist signalling is one or more flags (or pennants) simultaneously flying from a fixed halyard, and generally any method of signaling by such means. Each of the flags has a distinct shape and color combination. Each flag or combination of flags has a preassigned meaning or &quot;code&quot;. The International Code of Signals defines a standard set of flags and associated alphabet suitable for international use, as well as a set of standard codes. Flaghoist is also used in boat racing, to warn of impending severe weather, and other specialized applications.

Maritime flag signalling has a long history, especially prior to the advent of radio, and remains the preferred means of signaling in many situations. In naval flag signalling, additional flags and an expanded list of signals are used for identification and commands, as well as the mercantile uses. Many navies have their own proprietary or secret codes, and use additional flags. A designator flag is used to indicate if a flaghoist signal is meant to be interpreted as an ICS signal or as a naval signal. The U.S. Navy uses a set of 68 flags, including flags for each letter of the alphabet and each numeral to convey messages of tactical or administrative nature.

==Semaphore==
Flag semaphore signalling uses two flags, held in specific positions to signify letters. This method requires simple equipment but can be obscured by bad weather. A permanently installed chain of semaphore stations is a semaphore line and before the invention of the electric telegraph, was the fastest means of communication over moderately long distances. 

==Wig-wag flags==

In the 1850s, U.S. Army Major Albert J. Myer, a surgeon by training, developed a system using left or right movements of a flag (or torch or lantern at night). Myer&#x27;s system used a single flag, waved back and forth in a binary code conceptually similar to the Morse code of dots and dashes. This is sometimes called the &quot;wig-wag&quot; method of signaling, or &quot;wig-wagging&quot;. More mobile than previous means of optical telegraphy, as it only required one flag, this code was used extensively by Signal Corps troops on both sides in the American Civil War. (Its first use in battle was by Confederate Lieutenant Edward Porter Alexander at the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861.) In this code, alphabet letters were equated with three positions of a single flag, disk, or light. The flags measured two, four, or six feet (60, 120 or 180 cm) square and were generally either red or black banners with white square centers or white banners with red square centers. The disks were 12 to 18 inches (30 to 46 cm) in diameter and were made of metal or wood frames with canvas surfaces. Somewhat easier to handle than the flags, they provided a different method for daylight communications. The lights were kerosene lanterns attached to a staff. A second &quot;foot torch&quot; was placed on the ground before the signalman as a fixed point of reference, making it easier for the recipient to follow the lantern&#x27;s movements.

Myer&#x27;s code was ternary (three symbols). However, only two of these symbols were used for letters, making it largely binary. The third symbol only appeared in control characters. Each character consisted of a combination of three basic motions (elements). The neutral position was the flagman holding his device vertically and motionless above his head. The first motion was initiated by bringing the device downward on the signalman&#x27;s right side and then quickly returning it to its upright position. The second motion brought the device down on the left side and then returned it to the starting position. The third motion lowered the device in front of the signalman, then restored it to its vertical position. Like Morse code, but unlike Myer&#x27;s original code, this binary code did not have a fixed length for each character. For instance, &quot;i&quot; was coded as &quot;2&quot;, but &quot;d&quot; was coded as &quot;222&quot;. Myer&#x27;s 1866 manual also includes a 3-element fixed length code using four elements, and the 1872 manual has a 3-element fixed length code using three elements. There is little sign that these codes were widely used. The 1872 manual includes a variable length code using four elements which Myer says was used by the Army, but is superseded.

<doc id="1101552" wikidata="Q6805999" url="?curid=1101552" title="Media strategy">
<text>Media strategy, as used in the advertising or content delivery (online broadcasting) industries, is concerned with how messages will be delivered to consumers or niche markets. It involves identifying the characteristics of the target audience or market as well as who should receive messages and defining the characteristics of the media that will be used for the delivery of the messages, with the intent being to influence the behavior of the target audience or market pertinent to the initial brief. Examples of such strategies today have revolved around an Integrated Marketing Communications approach whereby multiple channels of media are used i.e. advertising, public relations, events, direct response media, etc.

This concept has been used among proponents of entertainment-education programming where pro-social messages are embedded into dramatic episodic programs to change the audiences attitudes and behaviors in such areas as family planning, literacy, nutrition, smoking, etc.
== Overview ==

Media is a means or tool that is used to express and communicate messages to targeted audiences. There are various types of media, including but not limited to visual media, audio media, and traditional folk art media. These can also overlap with each other, for example, television is a typical example of visual-audio media. Strategy, on the other hand, is a plan created to help an individual or organization to achieve certain goals. Media strategy, specifically, is commonly applied in the public relations, marketing and advertising industries. By leveraging different forms of medium, media strategy could efficiently play a role in establishing customer relationships, building a brand image, and improving flattened sales revenue. 

== Stages ==
In the way of generating a media strategy, there are three stages of building a strategic framework- initiation, diffusion, and maturity, and each stage will have its own focus. The initiation stage is the most common one that a majority of companies will go through when developing media strategies. It guides people to identify the target demographics and the corresponding best-fit channel by primary research and secondary research. Research findings will help understand the target audience in a deeper layer and thus avoid some potential risks as well as costly losses before implementation. Carrying out research is a key step to help decision-makers uncover the hidden side of the market and better understand the consumer behaviors accordingly. Once the target audience and media channel are determined, companies are geared to their goal when it comes to the diffusion stage. During this stage, people are motivated to think about what specific outcome they aim to achieve through the media strategy, which could be very diverse among different parties. For instance, non-profit organizations tend to raise public awareness by well-designed media strategy while public companies care about how many profits will be driven out of a media strategy. Finally in the maturity stage, the main focus is no longer the goal but monitoring. Monitoring what’s happening in social media platforms is likely to generate significant insights that will not be found in any previous stages. 

== Case studies ==
Old Spice, an American old male grooming product brand, hits a huge marketing success by orchestrating social media campaigns for a correct targeted social group. Even though men are the direct consumers of Old Spice body wash product, they rarely purchase it by themselves whereas women are the actual buyers of men’s body wash. In terms of such quantitative research findings, Old Spice tailored a series of social media campaigns to attract female consumers and finally led to a steep increase in sales. Therefore, media strategy could be especially beneficial and profit-driven when implemented to the right target audiences, and doing research is an efficient approach to verify the target group. Looking back to the Old Spice’s case, social media strategy is not just to create networking effects and viral influence. The terminal goal is to pinpoint the most appropriate medium to reach out to the target audience and thus convey messages efficiently.

<doc id="1101558" wikidata="Q3039753" url="?curid=1101558" title="Refugee law">
<text>Refugee law is the branch of international law which deals with the rights and duties states have &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; refugees. There are differences of opinion among international law scholars as to the relationship between refugee law and international human rights law or humanitarian law.

The discussion forms part of a larger debate on the fragmentation of international law. While some scholars conceive each branch as a self-contained regime distinct from other branches, others regard the three branches as forming a larger normative system that seeks to protect the rights of all human beings at all time. The proponents of the latter conception view this holistic regime as including norms only applicable to certain situations such as armed conflict and military occupation (IHL) or to certain groups of people including refugees (refugee law), children (the Convention on the Rights of the Child), and prisoners of war (the Geneva Convention (III) relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War).

== Definition of &#x27;refugee&#x27; ==
There is a variety of definitions as to who is regarded as a refugee, usually defined for the purpose of a particular instrument. The variation of definitions regarding refugees has made it difficult to create a concrete and single vision of what constitutes a refugee following the original refugee convention. Article 1 of the 1951 Refugee Convention, as amended by the 1967 Protocol, defines a &quot;refugee&quot; as:

A person who owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.

The 1967 Protocol removed the temporal restrictions that restricted refugee status to those whose circumstances had come about &quot;as a result of events occurring before 1 January 1951,&quot; and the geographic restrictions that gave participating states of the Convention the option of interpreting this as &quot;events occurring in Europe&quot; or &quot;events occurring in Europe or elsewhere&quot;. However, it also gave those states that had previously ratified the 1951 Convention and chose to use the geographically-restricted definition the option to retain that restriction.

The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Convention Governing the Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa adopted a regional treaty based on the Convention, adding to the definition of &quot;refugee&quot; as:

Any person compelled to leave his/her country owing to external aggression, occupation, foreign domination or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of origin or nationality.

In 1984, a group of Latin-American governments adopted the Cartagena Declaration on Refugees, which, like the OAU Convention, added more objectivity based on significant consideration to the 1951 Convention. The Cartagena Declaration determine that a &quot;refugee&quot; includes:

Persons who flee their countries because their lives, safety or freedom have been threatened by generalized violence, foreign aggression, internal conflicts, massive violation of human rights or other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order.

=== Difference from &#x27;asylee&#x27; and &#x27;displaced person&#x27; ===
Additionally, U.S. Law draws an important distinction between &quot;refugees&quot; and &quot;asylees&quot;. A &quot;refugee&quot; must meet the definition of a refugee, as outlined in the 1951 Convention and be of &quot;special humanitarian concern to the United States.&quot; Refugee status can only be obtained from outside the United States. If an individual who meets the definition of a refugee, and is seeking admission in a port of entry is already in the United States, they are eligible to apply for asylum status.

The term &quot;displaced person&quot; has come to be synonymous with refugees due to a substantial amount of overlap in their legal definitions. However, they are legally distinct, and convey subtle differences. In general, a &quot;displaced person&quot; refers to &quot;one who has not crossed a national border and thus does not qualify for formal refugee status.&quot;

=== Refugee children ===
According to the original 1951 Refugee Convention and 1967 Protocol, refugee children were legally indistinguishable from adult refugees. In 1988, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Guidelines on Refugee Children were published, specifically designed to address the needs of refugee children, officially granting them internationally recognized human rights.

In 1989, however, the UN signed an additional treaty, the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), which defined the rights of children and bound its signatories to upholding those rights by international law. Although the CRC was not specific to the rights of refugee minors, it was used as the legal blueprint for handling refugee minor cases, where a minor was defined as any person under the age of 18. In particular, it extends the protection of refugee children by allowing participating nations the capacity to recognize children who do not fall under the strict guidelines of the Convention definition but still should not be sent back to their countries of origin. It also extends the principle of non-refoulement to prohibit the return of a child to their country &quot;where there are grounds for believing that there is a real risk of irreparable harm to the child.&quot;

==International sources==
Refugee law encompasses both customary law, peremptory norms, and international legal instruments. The only international instruments directly applying to refugees are the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees. Both the Convention and the Protocol are open to states, but each may be signed separately. 145 states have ratified the Convention, and 146 have ratified the Protocol. These instruments only apply in the countries that have ratified an instrument, and some countries have ratified these instruments subject to various reservations.
==U.S. refugee law==

Various regions and countries have different variations of refugee law. They all stem from the 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol which relates to refugee status. The United States became a party to this protocol in 1968.

Despite playing an active role in the drafting of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the United States has yet to ratify the treaty, making it the only nation in the United Nations that is not party to it.

Refugee status first emerged as a legal category in the United States in the 1940s, responding to an influx of Eastern Europeans fleeing Communism. In response to this influx, Congress established refugee migration as &quot;distinct and separate from general immigration admissions&quot; upon the recommendation from the House Committee on Postwar Immigration. The Committee argued that the right to seek asylum be made &quot;an explicit part of United States immigration policy.&quot;

Although the aftermath of World War II brought forth a refugee crisis, the large influx and resettlement of Indochinese refugees led to the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980. This law incorporated the International Convention&#x27;s definitions of a refugee into U.S. law. In doing so, it codified into U.S. law that a refugee was an individual with a &quot;well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion.&quot; Furthermore, ratifying this Convention meant the elimination of previous &quot;ideological and geographical discriminations&quot; against refugee and asylum seekers. These discriminations were a result of previous U.S. refugee law, which had served mainly as a tool for foreign policy agendas. The law also created the legal basis for the admission of refugees into the U.S. The Refugee Act of 1980 was the first time the United States created an objective decision-making process for asylum and refugee status. This included a joint system between Congress and the Presidency, in which both branches would collaborate to establish annual quotas and determine which national groups would receive prioritized consideration for refugee status. In doing so, the U.S. shifted away from a relatively reactionary system, in which refugee laws were only passed in response to political changes in the international community, primarily the spread of Communism. Instead, under the Refugee Act of 1980, the U.S. established a comprehensive framework for addressing refugee crises preemptively. This framework was built on emerging ideals of &quot;humanitarianism&quot;. An important aspect of this law is how an individual goes about applying for status. A person may meet the definition of refugee but may not be granted refugee status. If the individual is inside of the U.S. with a different status or no status, they are granted the status of asylee but not refugee.

In order to be considered a refugee in the United States, an individual must:

* be located outside of the U.S.
* be of specific humanitarian apprehension for the U.S.
* be able to validate previous persecution or feared approaching persecution based on the individual&#x27;s race, religion, nationality, social class, or political outlook
* not be currently settled in another country
* be admissible to the United States

The first step of being granted this status is to receive a referral to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program (USRAP). The person is allowed to include their spouse, child, or other family members (only in specific circumstances) when applying for refugee status. After the person is referred, a U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services officer located abroad will conduct an interview to determine refugee resettlement eligibility inside the United States. If the person is approved as a refugee, they will then be provided with many forms of assistance. These include a loan for travel, advice for travel, a medical exam, and a culture orientation. After the refugee is resettled, they are eligible for medical and cash assistance. The Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) has a program called the Cash and Medical Assistance Program which completely reimburses the assistance in which states provide refugees. The refugee is eligible for this cash and medical assistance up to eight months after their arrival date.

In the United States, refugees are subject to annual quotas, which are determined by a joint collaboration between the incumbent Presidential administration and Congress. In addition to establishing the annual quota, Congress and the President determine which national groups are of special humanitarian concern to the United States. Since ratifying the 1980 Refugee Act, the United States has admitted over 3.1 million refugees from around the world, many of who were permanently resettled in the United States. Prior to the Trump Administration, the United States was the global leader in admitting refugees and offered refugee status to more individuals than the rest of the world altogether. Under the Trump administration, refugee immigration laws faced many challenges and setbacks, as administration officials sought to rollback immigration laws and decrease the annual number of refugees admitted. Challenges to refugee law included contesting practices of non-refoulement, which has been a long-standing principle of the U.S. immigration system. Attempts to reverse Trump-era policies have been a focus of the subsequent Biden presidential administration. In 2021, it was announced that Biden administration would raise the refugee cap from 15,000 individuals to 62,500 individuals.

== Refugee status determination ==

The burden of refugee status determination (RSD) falls primarily on the state. However, in cases where states are either unwilling or unable, the UNHCR assumes responsibility. In 2013, the UNHCR managed RSD in over 50 countries and worked in parallel with national governments in 20 countries. In the period from 1997 to 2001, the number of RSD applications submitted to the UNHCR nearly doubled.

RSD provides protection for refugees through promoting non-refoulement, resettlement assistance, and direct assistance.

==Human rights and refugee law==

Human rights are the rights that a person is guaranteed by way of birth. The following are universal human rights that are most relevant to refugees:

*The right to freedom from torture or degrading treatment
*The right to freedom of opinion and expression
*The right to freedom of thought, conscience, and religion
*The right to life, liberty, and security
*Freedom from discrimination
*The right to asylum

Refugee law and international human rights law are closely connected in content but differ in their function. The main difference of their function is the way in which international refugee law considers state sovereignty while international human rights law do not. One of the core principles of international refugee law is the prohibition on refoulement (or the expulsion or return of a refugee), which is the basic idea that a country cannot send back a person to their country of origin if they will face endangerment upon return. In this case, a certain level of sovereignty is taken away from a country. This basic right of non-refoulement conflicts with the basic right of sovereign state to expel any undocumented aliens.

<doc id="1101567" wikidata="Q16515017" url="?curid=1101567" title="Courtesy">
<text>Courtesy (from the word , from the 12th century) is gentle politeness and courtly manners. In the Middle Ages in Europe, the behaviour expected of the nobility was compiled in courtesy books.

==History==
The apex of European courtly culture was reached in the Late Middle Ages and the Baroque period (i.e. roughly the four centuries spanning 1300–1700). 
The oldest courtesy books date to the 13th century, but they become an influential genre in the 16th, with the most influential of them being &quot;Il Cortegiano&quot; (1508), which not only covered basic etiquette and decorum but also provided models of sophisticated conversation and intellectual skill.

The royal courts of Europe persisted well into the 18th century (and to some limited extent to the present day), but in the 18th century, the notion of &quot;courtesy&quot; was replaced by that of &quot;gallantry&quot;, referring to an ideal emphasizing the display of affected sensitivity in direct contrast with the ideals of self-denial and dignified seriousness that were the Baroque norm. During the late medieval and early modern period, the bourgeois class tended to emulate the courtly etiquette of their betters. This changed in the 19th century, after the end of the Napoleonic Wars, with the emergence of a middle class with its own set of bourgeois etiquette, which in turn was mocked in the classist theory of Marxism as &quot;petite bourgeoisie&quot;.

The analogue concept in the court culture of medieval India was known by the Sanskrit term , literally meaning &quot;right-handedness&quot;, but as in English &quot;dexterity&quot; having a figurative meaning of &quot;apt, clever, appropriate&quot;, glossed as &quot;kindness and consideration expressed in a sophisticated and elegant way&quot;.

<text>Hein ter Poorten (21 November 1887 – 15 January 1968) was a Dutch military officer. He was the commander of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army in World War II. Ter Poorten was also Allied land forces commander in the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command on Java during early 1942.

==Early life==
Hein ter Poorten was born on 21 November 1887 in Buitenzorg (now Bogor) on Java, which was at the time part of the Dutch East Indies. He was the son of Franciscus Hendricus ter Poorten, a chief mate in the Government Navy, and of Clasina Ambrosina Kater.

After having been sworn in as an artillery officer in 1911, he helped to found the army air force, and in 1919 began a course at the Hogere Krijgsschool staff college in the Netherlands. He was invested as a Knight of the Order of Orange-Nassau with swords for his part in the development of military aviation in 1911.

== World War II ==
He steadily rose up the ranks upon his return to the East Indies, and by July 1939, was the Royal Netherlands Indies Army (KNIL) chief of the general staff. Lieutenant General Gerardus Johannes Berenschot&#x27;s death in a flying accident in October 1941 saw Ter Poorten, by now also a lieutenant general, promoted to commander in chief of the KNIL.

Ter Poorten was regarded by his contemporaries in the army as a skilled commander with a firm understanding of military affairs in the East Indies, and thus was able to get on well with his subordinates and fellow officers; his relations with the civilian administration were less successful.

In January 1942, following the outbreak of war with Japan, Ter Poorten was appointed commander of land forces in the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command, a short-lived unified command of all Allied forces in South East Asia. By March, Ter Poorten became the de facto head of all Allied forces on Java, following rapid Japanese advances and the break-up of ABDACOM. It was left to him to unconditionally surrender the island to the Japanese on 8 March 1942. Ter Poorten had no authority to sign the surrender and did not initially do so. After threats and under pressure of reprisals, Ter Poorten was forced to read a statement on the radio about an unconditional capitulation. Van Mook had already been appointed Lieutenant Governor General on 1 January 1942 by the government in exile in London. In this position he was the deputy of Governor General Tjarda van Starkenborgh Stachouwer. on 8 March 1942, the Dutch East Indies government in exile was already in Brisbane. Australia gave Van Mook authority on those areas still unoccupied by the Japanese.

Ter Poorten spent the rest of the war in various prisoner of war camps.

== After the war ==
After his liberation in August 1945, Ter Poorten moved to the Netherlands. He requested his resignation as commander of the Royal Netherlands East Indies Army and head of the Department of War in November 1945. His request was not granted right away, but he was eventually honorably discharged on 28 February 1946. Despite these honors, Ter Poorten believed that he was being scapegoated for the defeat in the Dutch East Indies.

Ter Poorten died on 15 January 1968 in The Hague, at the age of 80.

==Military decorations==
* Knight of the Order of the Netherlands Lion
* Officer of the Order of Orange-Nassau
* Medal for Long, Honest and Faithful Service
* Officer of the Legion of Honour
* Commander 1st Class of the Order of the Sword

<doc id="1101576" wikidata="Q683630" url="?curid=1101576" title="Pinball Dreams">
<text>Pinball Dreams is a pinball simulation video game developed by Digital Illusions and originally released for the Amiga in 1992. It spawned several sequels, including &quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot; and &quot;Pinball Illusions&quot;. The MS-DOS port was digitally released by Rebellion Developments along with its sequel and &quot;Pinball Mania&quot; on February 22, 2011 on GOG.com with support for Microsoft Windows. It received an OS X build on April 23, 2013; and a Linux build on August 19, 2014.

==Gameplay==
The game&#x27;s four tables each had a theme, as do most real-life pinball &amp; Panchinko machines. The version of Pinball Dreams bundled with the Amiga 1200 had a bug which rendered most of Beat Box&#x27;s advanced features non-functional.

*&quot;Ignition&quot;, themed around a rocket launch, planets, and space exploration. The Expert Software&#x27;s Pinball 2000 port of the game renamed this table &quot;Rocket&quot;.
*&quot;Steel Wheel&quot;, themed around steam trains and the Old West.
*&quot;Beat Box&quot;, themed around the music industry, charts, bands and tours.
*&quot;Nightmare&quot;, themed around a graveyard, ghosts, demons, nightmares and generally evil things. Unlike the other tables in the game, the name of the table in the menu did not reflect the name displayed on the table itself—&quot;Graveyard&quot;. Some ports of the game (notably the GameTek port to the Game Boy) name this table &quot;Graveyard&quot; in the menu as well.

==Development==
The ball moves according to reasonably realistic physics, and the game was restricted to using table elements which would also be possible to build in reality. Sound and music were realized with module files. With this technology, several music tracks could be included on the limited space of floppy disks.

Ports:
*Atari Falcon
*Commodore 64: A preview was released at the Breakpoint demo party in April 2006.
*Game Boy
*Game Gear
*Game Boy Advance: Under the title Pinball Challenge Deluxe, with tables added from &quot;Pinball Fantasies&quot;.
*GP32: Released in October 2002.
*Super Nintendo Entertainment System: A mostly accurate conversion, including all four tables and near-perfect sound. However, the red &quot;blood&quot; under the top bumper in the &quot;Nightmare&quot; table has been changed to blue and the crosses were removed.
*PC: A conversion for DOS based systems by Spidersoft.
*iPhone/iPod Touch: Released in January 2009 by Cowboy Rodeo as Pinball Dreaming: Pinball Dreams.
*PlayStation Network: Released in November 2009 by Cowboy Rodeo.
*iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad: Released in July 2011 by Cowboy Rodeo as Pinball Dreams HD.
*OS X: Released in August 2011 by Cowboy Rodeo as &quot;Pinball Dreams HD&quot;.
*Amstrad CPC: Released in October 2019 by BG GAMES.

==Reception==

&quot;Pinball Dreams&quot; was a commercial success, selling more than 650,000 copies in its debut year.

&quot;Pinball Dreams&quot; was overall received positive by press reviews. &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; gave the Game Gear version a 5.8 out of 10, commenting that &quot;Pinball never really worked well on portable systems and &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot; is no exception. The boards are huge, but the game is a little slow.&quot; Power Unlimited gave the Game Boy version a score of 85% summarizing: &quot;Sharp graphics, excellent sound and simple controls all contribute to a game that will hardly get boring. And with the three different cabinets there is also variety.

In 1993 &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; criticized the PC version of &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot; as having &quot;the worst physical model&quot; of four reviewed games, and disliked the &quot;jerk[y]&quot; scrolling. The magazine said in June 1994 that &quot;Pinball 2000&quot; &quot;is an average title at a better than average price&quot;. In 1996 the magazine ranked &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot; as the 119th best game of all time, stating, &quot;Smooth scrolling and great ball physics made this Amiga game a wizard&#x27;s choice.&quot; In 2011, Wirtualna Polska ranked it as the fourth best Amiga game.

==Sequels and spin-offs==
===&quot;Pinball Dreams 2&quot;===
An alternate PC-only sequel, &quot;Pinball Dreams 2&quot;, was released in 1995 by 21st Century Entertainment (like &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot;) but was developed by Spidersoft.

It includes four tables:
*&quot;Neptune&quot;, themed to underwater exploration.
*&quot;Safari&quot;, themed to an African safari.
*&quot;Revenge of the Robot Warriors&quot;, themed to a battle against robots.
*&quot;Stall Turn&quot;, themed to aerobatics.

Composer Andrew Barnabas did not have access to the game while writing its music, and was instead given only a list of song titles and a copy of the original &quot;Pinball Dreams&quot;. He complained that &quot;I couldn&#x27;t even see what the game looked like. It was like composing in the dark.&quot;

===&quot;Pinball Mania&quot;===
&quot;Pinball Mania&quot; is a 1995 DOS game based on Pinball Dreams. While &quot;Digital Illusions was not involved in the fourth title in 21st Century&#x27;s pinball series&quot; it was instead developed by Spidersoft. The game featured 4 tables: Kick Off, Jail Break, Tarantula, and Jackpot. PC Games (Germany) gave the game a 69 out of 100, while High Score gave it 3 out of 5. A Game Boy port was published by GameTek UK Ltd. Consoles Plus gave it 80 out of 100, while Total! (Germany) gave it 3 out of 6.

===&quot;Absolute Pinball&quot;===
&quot;Absolute Pinball&quot; is a 1996 DOS game based on Pinball Dreams. It was developed by Unique Development Studios AB and published by 21st Century Entertainment Ltd. on Sep 01, 1996. Joystick (French) gave it 80 out of 100, Coming Soon Magazine gave it 76 out of 100, PC Games (Germany) gave it 75 out of 100, PC Player (Denmark) gave it 70 out of 100, PC Player (Germany) gave it 3 Stars, High Score gave it 3 out of 5, PC Joker gave it 55 out of 100, and Power Play gave it 54 out of 100.

===&quot;Pinball Builder&quot;===
===&quot;Total Pinball 3D&quot;===
&quot;Total Pinball 3D&quot; is a DOS game released in 1996 by 21st Century Entertainment and developed by Spidersoft.

A &quot;Next Generation&quot; reviewer criticized that the view of the table in 2D mode is too small due to it being restricted to one side of the screen, and concluded, &quot;There is a lot of variety in play style, difficulty, and theme, and the graphics are sharp, but compared to the high level of detail and originality in recent titles, the tables here look bland. ... much better games like &quot;Hyper 3-D Pinball&quot; and &quot;Pro Pinball: The Web&quot; now come to mind.&quot; He scored it two out of five stars. Coming Soon Magazine gave it 81 out of 100, PC Games (Germany) gave it 68 out of 100, GameSpot gave it 5.8 out of 10, Power Play gave it 42 out of 100, and PC Player (Germany) gave it 1 Stars.

<doc id="1101579" wikidata="Q3855635" url="?curid=1101579" title="Dynamic Monte Carlo method">
<text>In chemistry, dynamic Monte Carlo (DMC) is a Monte Carlo method for modeling the dynamic behaviors of molecules by comparing the rates of individual steps with random numbers. It is essentially the same as Kinetic Monte Carlo. Unlike the Metropolis Monte Carlo method, which has been employed to study systems at equilibrium, the DMC method is used to investigate non-equilibrium systems such as a reaction, diffusion, and so-forth (Meng and Weinberg 1994). This method is mainly applied to analyze adsorbates&#x27; behavior on surfaces.

There are several well-known methods for performing DMC simulations, including the First Reaction Method (FRM) and Random Selection Method (RSM). Although the FRM and RSM give the same results from a given model, the computer resources are different depending on the applied system.

In the FRM, the reaction whose time is minimum on the event list is advanced. In the event list, the tentative times for all possible reactions are stored. After the selection of one event, the system time is advanced to the reaction time, and the event list is recalculated. This method is efficient in computation time because the reaction always occurs in one event. On the other hand, it consumes a lot of computer memory because of the event list. Therefore, it is difficult to apply to large-scale systems.

The RSM decides whether the reaction of the selected molecule proceeds or not by comparing the transition probability with a random number. In this method, the reaction does not necessarily proceed in one event, so it needs significantly more computation time than FRM. However, this method saves computer memory because it does not use an event list. Large-scale systems are able to be calculated by this method.

<text>Kakheti (; ) is a region of Georgia. Telavi is its administrative center. The region comprises eight administrative districts: Telavi, Gurjaani, Qvareli, Sagarejo, Dedoplistsqaro, Signagi, Lagodekhi and Akhmeta. 

Kakhetians speak the Kakhetian dialect of Georgian. Kakheti is one of the most significant wine producing regions of Georgia, home to a number of Georgian wines. The region is bordered to the west by the Georgian regions of Mtskheta-Mtianeti and Kvemo Kartli, to the north and east by the Russian Federation, and to the southeast by Azerbaijan. Popular tourist attractions in Kakheti include Tusheti, Gremi, Signagi, Kvetera, Bodbe, Lagodekhi Protected Areas and Alaverdi Monastery. 

The Georgian David Gareja monastery complex is partially located in this province and is subject to a border dispute between Georgian and Azerbaijani authorities. 

== Geography ==
Beyond the modern-day administrative subdivision into the districts, Kakheti has traditionally been subdivided into four parts: Inner Kakheti (შიდა კახეთი, &quot;Shida Kakheti&quot;) to the east of Tsiv-Gombori mountain range, along the right bank of the Alazani River; Outer Kakheti (გარე კახეთი, &quot;Gare Kakheti&quot;) along the middle Iori River basin; Kiziq&#x27;i (ქიზიყი) between the Alazani and the Iori; Thither Area (გაღმა მხარი, &quot;Gaghma Mkhari&quot;) on the left bank of the Alazani. It also includes the medieval region of Hereti whose name has fallen into gradual oblivion since the 15th century.

== Administrative divisions ==
The Kakheti region is divided into eight municipalities:

==History==
Kakheti was an independent principality from the end of the eighth century. It was incorporated into the united Georgian Kingdom at the beginning of the eleventh century, but for less than a decade. Only in the beginning of the twelfth century did Georgian King David the Builder (1089–1125) incorporate Kakheti into his Kingdom successfully.

=== Fifteenth–Sixteenth centuries: peace and prosperity, geopolitical situation ===
After the disintegration of the Georgian Kingdom, Kakheti became an independent Kingdom in the 1460s. In contrast with other Georgian political entities, long reign of Kakhetian Kings – Alexander I (1476-1511), Levan (1518-1574) and Alexander II (1574-1605), was marked by peace and prosperity, population grew steadily and at the turn of the seventeenth century reached 250,000–300,000. Gremi, capital city of the Kingdom and Zagemi became one of the most important urban centers of the Caucasus, attracting merchants and artisans from the neighbouring countries. New churches, castles and palaces were built and agriculture developed.

During the last years of the sixteenth century Kakhetian feudal army consisted of 10,000 cavalrymen, 3,000 infantry and 500 musketeers. Horsemen and foot soldiers were armed with bows, arrows, sabres, shields and spears, while musketeers had hand-guns. Furthermore, Alexander II made some futile efforts to introduce artillery from Muscovy.

During the sixteenth century international situation of the Georgian Kingdoms worsened dramatically, Transcaucasus became battleground of the powerful Muslim – Ottoman and Safavid – Empires, while Georgia was completely isolated from the Christian world. Additionally, greatly accelerated process of the Islamization of the North Caucasian peoples, including Dagestani mountaineers – direct neighbours of Kakheti. From 1555 the Kingdom was a vassal of the successive dynasties of Persia and to a much shorter period Ottoman Empire but enjoyed intermittent periods of greater independence, especially after 1747.

Formally under the vassalage of the Safavid dynasty, Levan of Kakheti was desirous to diminish foreign influence over Georgia, stealthily sending Kakhetian detachments to his son-in-law Simon I of Kartli against the Qizilbashes in the 1560s. Alexander II, the astute son of the previous King, continued Levan&#x27;s policy, switching sides during the Ottoman–Safavid war several times, simultaneously strengthening his realm. In addition, Alexander&#x27;s army had to confront north-eastern neighbour of the Kingdom – Shamkhalate, whose rulers tried to wreak havoc to the borderlands of Kakheti, kidnapping peasants and looting countryside. During the last quarter of the sixteenth century Kakhetian feudal army defeated Shamkhals’ undisciplined bands several times, killing hundreds of marauders.

Throughout the fifteenth–eighteenth centuries Georgian Kings and Princes, including those of Kakheti, constantly tried to establish diplomatic relations with the Popes and Christian Monarchs of the West – Holy Roman Empire, Spain, France, Prussia, Naples etc. calling them for aid against the Ottoman and Safavid incursions. However, nothing came from these attempts, geographic distance and ongoing wars made it impossible for the Europeans to support fellow Christian nation. As a result Georgian political entities had to fight against Muslim invaders virtually alone, while geographical isolation greatly limited opportunity for the Georgian elites to come into contact with the epochal changes taking place in Europe during the early modern period.

If the political and military assistance from the Western Europe proved to be unrealistic, in the north Grand Duchy of Muscovy, freed from the Mongol-Tatar yoke in 1480, seemed as a steadfastly growing Orthodox superpower. Alexander I of Kakheti became the first Georgian King to establish formal diplomatic contact with the Russians, dispatching two embassies to Grand Duke Ivan III of Muscovy in 1483 and 1491. In 1556, Astrakhan was conquered by Ivan the Terrible. After eleven years Terek-Town fort was built, Russians became nearly direct neighbours of Kakheti. In 1563, King Levan, grandson of Alexander I, appealed to the Muscovites to take his realm under their protection against the Ottomans, and Safavids. Tsar Ivan IV responded by sending a Russian detachment to Georgia, but Levan, pressured by Iran, had to turn these troops back after several years. King Alexander II also appealed for Russian support against foreign encroachments. In 1587, he negotiated &quot;The Book of Pledge&quot;, forming an alliance between Kakheti and the Russian Tsardom. David I of Kakheti (1601–1602), the rebellious son of Alexander II, during his short reign reaffirmed loyalty to the foreign policy of his predecessors. However, as the Times of Troubles began in Russia, Georgian political entities could not count on Muscovite assistance in their struggle for independence.

=== Seventeenth century: Abbas I&#x27;s invasions, Teimuraz I, struggle for survival ===

In 1605, Constantine, younger son of Alexander II, who was raised at the Safavid court and converted to Islam, according to Shah&#x27;s secret instruction assassinated his father and brother. The assassination of the royal family and usurpation of the crown by Constantine I infuriated the Georgians, who rose in a rebellion under the direction of Queen Ketevan later that year. On October 22, 1605, the Kakhetian army routed the Qizilbash forces of Constantine, who was killed on the battlefield. Caught by surprise, Abbas I grudgingly accepted the result of the 1605 Uprising and was forced to confirm sixteen years old Teimuraz I (1605–1648) – nemesis of the Safavids in the future – as a new King of Kakheti.

In 1612, the treaty of Nasuh Pasha was concluded, war with the Ottomans was temporarily over. From now on Shah Abbas I could attack eastern Georgia without hindrance – dethrone Christian Kings, establish Qizilbash khanates and deport or exterminate insubmissive Georgians from their homeland. In October 1613, Abbas I moved his army to Ganja. Next spring, he turned on Kakheti, demanding Teimuraz&#x27;s sons as hostages. After taking counsel, Teimuraz I sent his mother Ketevan and his younger son, Alexander, to Iran. The Shah insisted; reluctantly, the Kakhetians sent the heir, Levan. Shah Abbas I then demanded Teimuraz&#x27;s attendance. At this point war broke out. In 1614–1617, Abbas I led several campaigns against Kakheti and Kartli, massacred and deported hundreds of thousands ethnic Georgians to Iran, also despite stiff resistance and heavy defeat at Tsitsamuri forced Teimuraz I to Imereti. Shah Abbas I castrated both sons of the obdurate King and savagely tortured and burned to death his mother Queen Ketevan on September 13, 1624. Ketevan was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church and remains a symbolic figure in Georgian history. The story of her martyrdom was publicized in Europe, and several literary works were produced, including Andreas Gryphius’ &quot;Katharina von Georgien&quot; (1657). Moreover, Shah sought to populate Kakheti with the Turkoman tribes.

In 1624, Shah Abbas I turned his attention to Georgia again. Fearing a potential revolt, he dispatched some 35,000 men under Qarachaqay Khan and George Saakadze to subdue eastern Georgia. Although Saakadze had already served the Shah for twelve years, Abbas I didn&#x27;t trust Georgian general completely and kept George&#x27;s son, Paata, as a hostage. The Shah&#x27;s anxiety was justified, since the Grand Mouravi had maintained covert communications with the Georgian forces and devise a plan to destroy the enemy army. Saakadze surreptitiously united Kartli and Kakheti behind him. He deviously ‘advised’ Qarachaqay Khan to split his forces into small groups and send them into Kakheti, while the major army camped near Martqopi.

On March 25, 1625, Saakadze summoned the war council where he personally slew Qarachaqay Khan and Yusuf Khan of Shirvan, while his son, Avtandil, and his Georgian escorts killed other Qizilbash commanders, including Imam Verdi Khan, Qarachaqay&#x27;s son. Receiving a signal, Zurab Eristavi – another Georgian noble in Abbas&#x27;s service – charged with his main forces, virtually annihilating leaderless Iranian troops. Annunciation Day (25 March) brought an extraordinary victory – Saakadze&#x27;s and Duke Zurab&#x27;s army massacred 27,000 out of 30,000 strong Turkoman-Persian army, took their arsenal and besieged Tbilisi&#x27;s citadel before the puppet-king Simon II (1619–1630) could arrive. Within days, all Kartli and Kakheti was in Georgian hands.
After that, Saakadze&#x27;s army invaded neighbouring provinces of the Safavid Empire – plundering Ganja and razing to the ground countryside to the Araxes river, thus avenging Shah Abbas’ invasions. Since the Georgian Uprising was sudden, Qizilbash tribes living in Karabakh were caught by surprise and had to flee further south hastily. Even though Georgians managed to capture thousands of Qizilbashes. As Saint Luarsab II of Kartli had already been martyred on the orders of the Shah in 1622, Teimuraz I was invited from Gonio to take the crowns of Kartli and Kakheti, thereby uniting both Kingdoms.

Abbas I, like Iran&#x27;s and Turkey&#x27;s chroniclers, was aghast at this debacle. His counterattack came in June 1625, when another Qizilbash army numbering 40,000, led by Isa Khan and Kaikhosro-Mirza, entered in Kartli and bivouacked on the Marabda Field, while the Georgians were higher up in the Kojori gorge. At the council of war, George Saakadze urged King Teimuraz I and other lords to remain in position, since descending into the valley would allow the Iranians to take advantage of their numerical superiority as well as firepower. However, powerful lords were concerned about the enemy ravaging their estates and threatened to defect unless the battle was given at once, thus the Grand Mouravi was overruled.

On July 1, 1625, Teimuraz I ordered the attack. The Iranians, armed with the latest weaponry, were well prepared for the assault, having dug trenches and deployed their troops in four lines, with the first kneeling, the second standing, the third on horseback, and the fourth on camels. Georgians, lacking firearms, suffered heavy casualties, but the impetus of their attack pierced the Qizilbash lines and spread confusion among the enemy. As the Iranians began to flee, a small group of Georgian troops pursued them while others began to plunder the Qizilbash camp. At this moment, the Iranian reinforcement numbering 20,000, led by Shahbandeh Khan of Azerbaijan, arrived charging the befuddled Georgians; in the resultant confusion, Prince Teimuraz Mukhranbatoni was killed but the rumor spread that King Teimuraz I had been killed, further demoralizing the Georgian host. The Georgians were defeated, losing about 10,000 killed and wounded, including 900 mountaineers from the Duchy of Aragvi. Among the dead were the nine brothers Kherkheulidze who defended the royal banner to the last, as well as the prominent nobles – Baadur Tsitsishvili and David Jandieri, nine Machabelis, seven Cholokashvilis, bishops of Rustavi and Kharchisho. Furthermore, Zurab Eristavi, the mighty Duke of Aragvi, was severely wounded. The Iranians suffered heavy losses as well, losing some 14,000 men, including Amir Guneh Khan of Erivan – deadly wounded by Manuchar III Jaqeli.

Following the battle, Saakadze again led the Georgian resistance and turned to guerrilla war, eliminating some 12,000 Qizilbashes in the Ksani Valley alone. Among the dead was Shahbandeh Khan of Azerbaijan, while Qazaq Khan Cherkes was captured. The Georgian Uprising of 1625 debunked Shah Abbas’ plans of destroying the Georgian states and setting up Qizilbash khanates in Kartli and Kakheti. Losing half of his army forced Shah Abbas I to let vassals rule eastern Georgia. He abandoned plans to cleanse it of Christians. &quot;George Saakadze&quot; (1942) is a Soviet Georgian historical drama film directed by Mikheil Chiaureli, depicting the heroic struggle of the Georgian nation against the Ottoman and Safavid hordes during the first quarter of the seventeenth century. The film is based on the six-volume novel, &quot;The Grand Mouravi&quot; (1937–1958), of Anna Antonovskaya.

Demographic, material, economic and cultural losses inflicted to the Kingdom of Kakheti by the hordes of the Qizilbashes, during the first quarter of the seventeenth century, were irreparable. Population of the Kingdom dwindled to 50,000–60,000, while Gremi and Zagemi were almost completely devastated and never fully recovered from the blow dealt by the invaders. Hundreds of villages, castles and churches were razed to the ground or badly damaged. Yet still, fierce resistance resulted in Georgians preserving statehood, most of their ethnic territories, as well as religion of the ancestors.
Dagestani peoples, encouraged by the Safavid officials, constantly attacked poorly defended countryside of Kakheti, and massively migrated to the easternmost region of the Kingdom – Eliseni, on the left bank of the Alazani river. Such a development led to a prolonged conflict between the Georgians and marauding Dagestani bands, greatly hampering revival of the Kakhetian Kingdom. Teimuraz I took an energetic measures against the Dagestanis’, suddenly attacked and decapitated the Sultan of Elisu, avenging for his participation in the Abbas I&#x27;s Georgian campaigns. Besides that Teimuraz I tried to reestablish Christianity in the westernmost part of Dagestan, between the mountainous Dido people, traditionally closely related with Kakheti. Despite some initial successes, efforts made by the King proved to be futile.

During the next five years Teimuraz I got rid of his major rivals one by one – defeating Saakadze in the decisive battle of Bazaleti (1626) and assassinating Simon II and Zurab Eristavi, both in 1630. In 1632, he sheltered Daud Khan Undiladze, the Safavid governor of Ganja and Karabakh. After Abbas&#x27;s death in 1629, once mighty clan of the Undiladze fell into disfavor and was destroyed on the order of the Shah Safi. In response, Daud Khan colluded with Teimuraz I, deceitfully leading detachment of the Qajars to the Iori river to be massacred by Kakhetians. Additionally, Teimuraz&#x27;s army immediately invaded Arran and Karabakh several times, pillaging Ganja twice.

In 1633, Safavid counterattack came, the Qizilbash army led by Rostom Khan, uncle of the late Simon II, forced Teimuraz I to Imereti. Rostom (1633–1658) became the new King of Kartli. However, in the following year, to the disappointment of the Shah, Teimuraz I managed to reestablish himself in the Duchies of Aragvi and Ksani. Moreover, by 1638, Kakheti was under full control of the unruly King. During the 1630s Teimuraz I renewed his attempts to establish close ties with Russia. In 1639, he petitioned the Tsar of Russia for help and signed an oath of loyalty. However, no military aid had arrived.

In 1642, Teimuraz I conspired with Catholicos-Patriarch of eastern Georgia – Eudemus I and Kartlian nobles, to assassinate Rostom of Kartli, when the Muslim King was relaxing unguarded in the country. After that, Teimuraz I had to capture Tbilisi, expel Qizilbashes and unite eastern Georgian Kingdoms. However, a conspirator betrayed the plot. Rostom had the Catholicos-Patriarch arrested and imprisoned at the citadel of Tbilisi, where he was strangled. Eudemus I was canonized by the Georgian Orthodox Church as a holy hieromartyr. Six years later stubborn King of Kakheti was finally ousted from the power, losing the heir – Prince David, in the fateful battle of Magharo. Rostom, loyal vassal of the Shah, became the new ruler of Kakheti.

Taking shelter in Imereti, deposed Kakhetian King had his grandson Heraclius sent to the Russian court. In 1658, Teimuraz I travelled to Moscow, thus becoming the first Georgian King to visit Russia. In 1661, seventy-two years old King was captured during the Imeretian campaign of the King of Kartli, Vakhtang V (1658–1675). Teimuraz I was escorted as an honoured prisoner through Kartli to Shah Abbas II&#x27;s court – the Shah urged him to accept Islam, offered him meat on a fast day and, when Teimuraz I declined, threw wine in his face and imprisoned him in Astrabad by the Caspian. Here, the most valiant Georgian King of the seventeenth century died in 1663. Teimuraz I was buried in the Alaverdi Monastery.
In 1656, Shah Abbas II made another attempt to settle Turkoman tribes in Kakheti. As a result, in 1659, Georgians revolted again, tens of thousands Turkomans were massacred, or forced to leave Kakheti. The location, Gatsqvetila (‘Exterminated’), where the most Qizilbashes were slaughtered, became infamous. By 1660, Shah acknowledged his failure in Kakheti. However, Safavids also threatened retaliation if rebel leaders did not surrender. Bidzina Cholokashvili, Shalva and Elizbar Eristavis of Ksani chose to sacrifice their lives to avoid further bloodshed and traveled to Isfahan, where they were executed. The events of the 1659 Uprising produced numerous oral traditions, especially in mountainous regions of eastern Georgia – Tusheti, Pshavi and Khevsureti, where poems dedicated to local heroes became popular. In the nineteenth century, Vazha-Pshavela used these traditions to create one of his finest poems, &quot;Bakhtrioni&quot; (1892), while his fellow writer Akaki Tsereteli produced another classic of Georgian literature, &quot;Bashi-Achuki&quot; (1896). &quot;Bashi-Achuki&quot; (1956) is also a Soviet Georgian historical drama film directed by Leo Esakia.

In 1664, Archil II (1664–1675), the eldest son of the Kartlian King Vakhtang V, was confirmed as a new King of Kakheti, nominally converting to Islam. Eleven years of the Archil&#x27;s reign proved to be the most successful period of the calamitous seventeenth century. Archil II managed to start a long process of the revival of Kakheti. During his reign tens of deserted villages were repopulated, churches and monasteries repaired, castles rebuilt. In addition, Telavi – insignificant town during the fifteenth–seventeenth centuries – emerged as a new political and urban center of the Kingdom. Effectively exploiting military resources of his father&#x27;s realm, Archil II organized several victorious expeditions in Dagestan, forcing mountaineers to submission. As a result, during the reign of Archil II inroads of the Dagestani bands decreased significantly. However, in 1675, he had to leave Kakheti, while Heraclius I was forced to stay in Isfahan for years, before his nominal conversion to Islam.

From 1676 to 1703 Kakheti was put under direct control of the Safavid appointed khans, whose authority being merely nominal. Iranian khans, unable to deal with the Georgian nobility backed by restive vassal of the Safavids George XI of Kartli (1676–1688; 1703–1709), tried to weaken aristocratic resistance by encouraging further incursions and migration of the Dagestanis’ into Kakhetian lands.

=== Eighteenth century: Heraclius II, political and cultural revival, twilight of the Kartli-Kakhetian Kingdom ===

In 1703, Kakhetian branch of the house of Bagrationi was restored, ruling as the vassals of the degenerating Safavid dynasty. During the next twenty years Heraclius I (1675–1676; 1703–1709) and David II (1709–1722) had to deal with the incessant Dagestani inroads. Despite some initial successes, Eliseni, the easternmost region of the Kingdom, was irrevocably lost in the 1710s, and free communities of the mountaineers, known as Djaro-Belokani, were established, while Georgian peasants living there had to leave or to Islamize gradually. They who chose the latter, became known as Ingiloys.
In 1722, Constantine II (1722–1732), the illegitimate son of Heraclius I, became the new King of Kakheti. In the next year, Shah Tahmasp II ordered him to remove from power Vakhtang VI of Kartli, who adopted an anti-Safavid policy and made an alliance with Russia, which proved to be unsuccessful. Constantine II of Kakheti, reinforced by the Transcaucasian Tatars and Dagestanis, invaded Kartli and captured Tbilisi on May 4, 1723. Defeated King of Kartli and his supporters fled to Shida Kartli. The same year, the Ottoman army marched against the Constantine II, who was unable to stop it and offered to negotiate. The Ottomans entered Tbilisi on June 12, 1723, deceiving and imprisoning King of Kakheti during the negotiations. Fortunately for him, Constantine II managed to escape to his realm. After Vakhtang VI of Kartli immigrated to Russia in 1724, King of Kakheti became the sole leader of the anti-Ottoman resistance in eastern Georgia. Since Safavid Iran was on the verge of collapse, nominally Muslim Constantine II decided to return to the centuries-old pro-Russian foreign policy of his forefathers and offered to place Kartli and Kakheti under the Russian protection. However, Peter the Great, as well as his successors had no intention to start a new war against the Ottomans.

Meanwhile, Ottoman Empire skillfully used coreligionist Sunni Dagestanis against recalcitrant Georgian King, encouraging them to put constant pressure on Kakheti. On September 26, 1724, the Ottomans defeated Constantine&#x27;s army in the fierce battle of Zedavela, while Dagestani bands devastated countryside. As a result, Constantine II had to find shelter in Pshavi. Yet still, in 1725, Georgians managed to drive marauding bands of the mountaineers out of Kakheti. By 1730, Kakhetian King was forced to recognize Ottoman supremacy and agreed to pay tribute. Additionally, Constantine II, indifferent to religion, converted from Shia to Sunni Islam. Seven years long resistance of Georgians resulted in invaders abandoning initial plan of annexation of Kakheti, as the Ottoman Porte had done in Samtskhe-Saatabago at the turn of the seventeenth century. On December 28, 1732, the Ottomans, never fully confident in Constantine&#x27;s loyalty, murdered Kakhetian King in a treacherous way, inviting him to negotiate.

Constantine II was succeeded by Teimuraz II (1732–1744), the only Christian son of Heraclius I. With the accession of Teimuraz II to the throne forty years of Muslim Kings ruling period (1664–1675; 1703–1732) was over. In 1733, Teimuraz II reluctantly recognized suzerainty of the Sultan, only to attack his forces in the next year. The Turks, caught by unawares, were defeated in the bloody battle of Magharo.
A shrewd statesman, Teimuraz II tried to use Qizilbashes to his advantage and supported Tahmasp Qoli Khan in his campaigns to restore Iranian dominance in eastern Transcaucasus, in the 1730s. Initially, Tahmasp Qoli Khan already as Nader Shah, distrusted the stubborn King, who refused to convert to Islam even after detainment. However, the Shah, preoccupied by war on India, conceded that a Christian King would best keep Kartli and Kakheti peaceful and spare him from fighting on two fronts. First, he took with him to Iran Teimuraz II, his son Heraclius and his daughter Ketevan as hostages: Nader Shah married Ketevan to a relative, and enlisted Heraclius, who had military genius, for the Indian front. Meanwhile, in 1738, Teimuraz II, supported by the Qizilbashes, came back in his realm. He managed to suppress the anti-Iranian rebellion led by the influential Kartlian noble, Givi Amilakhvari, and consolidate his power in Kartli, thus de facto uniting eastern Georgian Kingdoms.

In 1744, Nader Shah confirmed Teimuraz II and his son Heraclius II (1744–1762) as the kings of Kartli and Kakheti and allowed them to perform Christian coronations. Father and son were crowned at the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral on October 1, 1745 – the first Christian coronation of the eastern Georgian kings in over a century.

In 1762, the Kakhetian Kingdom was united with the neighboring Georgian Kingdom of Kartli into the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti under King Heraclius II. Following the Treaty of Georgievsk and the sack of Tbilisi by Agha Mohammad Khan, in 1801 the Kingdom of Kartli-Kakheti was annexed to the Russian Empire. Russian suzerainty over Kakheti and the rest of Georgia was recognized by Qajar Iran in the 1813 Treaty of Gulistan.

=== 1801–1917: Kakheti within the Russian Empire, uprisings, modernization, Georgian national awakening ===
Loss of independence and establishment of the Imperial administration led to an imminent uprisings. In 1802, Kakhetian nobles revolted, insurgents planned to restore kartli-Kakhetian Kingdom. However, Russians quickly responded and crushed the rebellion. In 1810–1811, Kakheti suffered from poor harvests and plague, which led to food shortages and high prices. Despite the hardship, Russian officials forced the peasantry to sell their remaining produce to the state at a low price. As the Russian troops began requisitioning supplies, a peasant uprising flared up in the village of Akhmeta on January 31, 1812. The insurgents defeated Russians in the hard-fought battle of Bodbiskhevi, killing 2 officers and 212 soldiers, captured and slaughtered the entire Russian garrison of Signagi and later seized Telavi, Anaga, Dusheti, and Pasanauri. After some hesitations the rebels were supported by the local nobility and clergy. They proclaimed a prince Grigol Bagrationi, great-grandson of Heraclius II and grandson of George XII as the King of Kartli-Kakheti. The revolt soon spread to Kartli, and the Russian forces lost more than 1,000 men in clashes with the insurgents. The rebellion continued throughout 1812 until the superior Imperial army, led by governors of Caucasus – Italian-born Marquis de Paulucci and Nikolay Rtishchev finally defeated it and pacified the region by early 1813.

In 1918–1921 Kakheti was part of the independent Democratic Republic of Georgia, in 1922–1936 part of the Transcaucasian SFSR and in 1936–1991 part of the Georgian SSR. Since the Georgian independence in 1991, Kakheti has been a region of the republic of Georgia.

== Winemaking in Kakheti ==
The Kakheti Wine Region is located in the eastern part of Georgia and comprises two river basins, Iori and Alazani. These rivers have a significant influence on the character of Kakhetian wines. Kakheti is bordered on the west by another very important wine region of Georgia - Kartli. Together with the location, the climatic conditions of the region play an essential role in the formation of Kakheti wines. Kakheti vineyards are cultivated at an altitude of 250–800 meters above sea level. We can find both humid subtropicals as well as continental climates in the region. Kakheti terroir provides ideal conditions for both local varieties and international wine varieties as well. When talking about the Kakheti wine region, the first thing that comes to mind is Rkatsiteli and Saperavi grapes. These two wine varieties have become the face of the region and Georgia. With the increase in the awareness of Georgian wine, the interest in these varieties is growing, so do not be surprised if you encounter these Kakhetian wine varieties in different wine regions in the world.

== Travel information ==
The travel infrastructure in Kakheti is fast developing, since it is the most visited region of Georgia. One can choose to stay in a guest house, in a small and comfortable hotel, or a beautiful boutique-style hotel while traveling in this region. Telavi and Signagi are the most visited towns. Signagi was renovated three years ago. Until recently there were only some family hotels (simple rooms in a family-owned house with a shared bathroom), but now Signagi features several hotels.

<text>Rana Donald Waitai (26 November 1942 – 8 May 2021) was a New Zealand politician and lawyer. He was a member of the New Zealand House of Representatives representing Te Puku o Te Whenua, for the New Zealand First Party and Mauri Pacific Party from 1996 to 1999. He later served as a member of the Wanganui District Council.

==Early years==
His father was Te Rangi Koroingo Te Oreore Waitai (August 1912 – 1989) born and died in Lower Hutt. His mother was Mavis Lillian Waitai (née Winduss) (May 1912 – 1997) born in Nelson and died in Lower Hutt.

Rana Waitai was the partner of Te Aroha Ann Ruru Stanton from 1966 to 1995 and they had four daughters.

== Career ==
Following his secondary schooling at Wanganui Technical College, (now Whanganui City College), Waitai was a freezing worker at Wanganui in 1961, a bushman in 1961 at Karioi and also a factory worker. He later became a trainee probation officer at Wellington and in 1965 joined the New Zealand Police. In 1979 Waitai was the Duty Inspector at Police National Headquarters when Air New Zealand Flight 901 crashed on Erebus. He rang Chief Superintendent Brian Davies who was at home in the evening: &quot;We seem to have a small problem... We have lost a DC-10 sir.&quot; He retired from the Police at the rank of Superintendent after 31 years when he was elected to Parliament.

After leaving Parliament Waitai trained as a lawyer and worked as a barrister and solicitor in Whanganui.

==Political career==
Waitai was involved in the New Zealand National Party between 1973 and 1992, quitting after a dispute with then Prime Minister, Jim Bolger. He rejoined the National Party in 2000.

In 1992 he stood for Mayor of Wellington, despite living in Gisborne. He campaigned on improving public safety, scaling back sewage infrastructure to save on costs, promoting inner city living and giving jobs to unemployed people to convert unused office space into accommodation. He finished seventh out of eleven candidates.

=== Member of Parliament ===


Waitai was first elected to Parliament in the 1996 election as New Zealand First MP for the Māori electorate of Te Puku O Te Whenua as one of the &quot;Tight Five&quot;, having previously stood for the Gisborne seat. In 1998, when New Zealand First splintered, Waitai was one of the eight MPs who left the party. He eventually joined with four other MPs to form the Mauri Pacific party. In the 1999 election, he stood in the electorate and was ranked fourth on Mauri Pacific&#x27;s list, but the party failed to win any seats.

===Local government===
In 2005, Waitai attempted to re-enter politics as a by-election candidate for the Wanganui District Council. Although soundly defeated at that attempt, he subsequently was successful in the 2007 New Zealand local elections and was elected to both the district council and the Whanganui district health board. He was deputy chairman of the council&#x27;s Harbour and Maori committees. He was not successful in gaining re-election to the council in 2010, 2013 or 2014.

==Death==
Waitai died in Whanganui on 8 May 2021.

<text>Lieutenant General Gerardus Johannes Berenschot (24 July 1887 – 13 October 1941) was Commander-in-Chief of the &quot;Koninklijk Nederlands Indisch Leger&quot; (Royal Netherlands East Indies Army; KNIL). An Indo – as Eurasians of Indonesian and Dutch descent – Berenschot was the son of a Dutch officer in the KNIL. 

G. J. Berenschot was the son of Gerrit Hendrik Berenschot and Florence Mildred Rappa. At the age of 15, he was sent to the Netherlands, where he attended cadet school at Alkmaar. He later entered the Royal Military College, from which he graduated first in his class. He was the only commander of Indonesian descent (Indo) in the Dutch East Indies.

Upon graduation, he returned to his native East Indies where he distinguished himself as a young subaltern serving in the KNIL during the bloody campaigns in Aceh. 

In 1934 he became the KNIL&#x27;s Chief of the General Staff and, in July 1939, was promoted to Commander-in-Chief. 

Berenschot was regarded as a gifted officer with organisational skills and possibly the best Commander-in-Chief the KNIL ever had. Not only was he a skilled soldier, Berenschot also displayed an impressive understanding of politics and diplomacy. Following the fall of the Netherlands in 1940, Berenschot participated in conferences involving Allied leaders at Singapore, where he was well liked and well regarded by his British and US counterparts.

On 13 October 1941, the plane carrying Bereschot back from a conference with British Air Chief Marshal Robert Brooke-Popham crashed in the suburbs of Batavia. There were no survivors. By order of the colonial authorities, all flags on public buildings were hung at half-mast. Berenschot&#x27;s remains were buried in the Dutch War Cemetery Pandu in Bandung.

Bereschot&#x27;s post of Commander-in-Chief of the KNIL was given to Lieutenant General Hein ter Poorten, who had the difficult task of preparing the East Indies for the looming war with Japan.

Berenschot was married and with three children. His brother was Berend Willem Berenschot.

==Awards and decorations==

* Commander of the Order of Orange-Nassau
* Expedition Cross with clasps &quot;Atjeh 1906–1910&quot; and &quot;Atjeh 1911–1914&quot; and &quot;Honourable Mention&quot;

<text>Songs from a Room is the second studio album by Canadian musician Leonard Cohen, released in 1969. It reached No. 63 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs and No. 2 on the UK charts.

==Background==
The recording sessions for &quot;Songs From a Room&quot; began in Hollywood in May 1968 with David Crosby as producer. That didn&#x27;t work out, and the album was eventually produced at Columbia Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, with producer Bob Johnston (two of the tracks from the Crosby sessions are included as bonus tracks on the 2007 remastered version). Johnston and Cohen had wanted to work together on Cohen&#x27;s first album, but the studio had assigned Johnston elsewhere. After his experiences with Crosby, Cohen was not keen to continue the project, but after speaking with Johnston, he agreed to carry on as Johnston was prepared to work on achieving the spartan sound Cohen considered appropriate for his songs after the disputes he had with John Simon during the mixing sessions of &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot;. At the time, Johnston was best known for producing Bob Dylan, Johnny Cash and Simon and Garfunkel. As Anthony Reynolds observes in his book &quot;Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life&quot;, &quot;Since at this point in time Cohen was something of a hybrid of all of these acts, Cohen moved from the Chelsea in New York City to Franklin, Tennessee, where he lived on a farm 30 miles from Nashville itself. Cohen recorded some demos on the actual farm and otherwise immersed himself in a version of the country life.&quot;

==Recording==
Unlike his augmented debut, Cohen&#x27;s sophomore effort is austere by comparison, with considerably less drums, and featuring a stripped-down approach that emphasize the words rather than the musical arrangements. In 2001, Cohen admitted to Sylvie Simmons of &quot;Mojo&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s very stark. A lot of my friends who were musical purists had castigated me for the lushness and over-production of my first record and I was determined to do a very simple album.&quot; The sessions in Nashville began in the fall of 1968 at Columbia&#x27;s Studio A on 16th Avenue in Nashville. Johnston enlisted a smaller coterie of musicians than had backed Cohen on his debut album, including Ron Cornelius playing acoustic and electric guitar, Charlie Daniels playing bass, fiddle and acoustic guitar, Elkin &quot;Bubba&quot; Fowler contributing banjo, bass and acoustic guitar, while Johnston himself played keyboards. The album also features some prominent (if strictly ornamental) Jew&#x27;s harp. As biographer Ira Nadel notes in the 1996 Cohen biography &quot;Various Positions&quot;, although Cohen still showed signs of insecurity in the recording studio, producer Johnston created a hospitable atmosphere: &quot;In the studio, Daniels and the other musicians were told to listen to Cohen in order to get into the songs. It was like mixing colors; you had to be one of the colors for it to work. Johnston later referred to the album as a painting, not a record, and described his role as &#x27;a musical bodyguard,&#x27; protecting Cohen and his music from artificial intrusions and falsification of sound.&quot; According to Nadel, Johnston felt that French voices would enhance &quot;The Partisan&quot; so he and Cohen flew to France and overdubbed three female French singers.

==Composition==
The album contains &quot;Bird on the Wire&quot;, one of Cohen&#x27;s most famous songs. In a 1973 interview with Alastair Pirrie of the &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, Cohen stated, &quot;The song is so important to me. It&#x27;s that one verse where I say that I swear by this song, and by all that I have done wrong, I&#x27;ll make it all up to thee. In that verse it&#x27;s a vow that I&#x27;ll try and redeem everything that&#x27;s gone wrong. I think I&#x27;ve made it too many times now, but l like to keep renewing it.&quot; In the liner notes to the 1975 compilation &quot;The Best of Leonard Cohen&quot;, Cohen wrote about the song: &quot;I always begin my concert with this song. It seems to return me to my duties. It was begun in Greece and finished in a motel in Hollywood around 1969 along with everything else. Some lines were changed in Oregon. I can&#x27;t seem to get it perfect. Kris Kristofferson informed me that I had stolen part of the melody from another Nashville writer. He also said that he&#x27;s putting the first couple of lines on his tombstone, and I&#x27;ll be hurt if he doesn&#x27;t.&quot; In the 1960s, Cohen lived on the Greek island Hydra with his girlfriend Marianne. She has related how she helped him out of a depression by handing him his guitar, whereupon he began composing &quot;Bird on the Wire&quot; – inspired by a bird sitting on one of Hydra&#x27;s recently installed phone wires, followed by memories of wet island nights. Cohen has described &quot;Bird on the Wire&quot; as a simple country song, and the first recording, by Judy Collins, was indeed done in a country setting. In the book &quot;Songwriters on Songwriting&quot;, Cohen speaks at length to Paul Zollo about the song:
It was begun in Greece because there were no wires on the island where I was living to a certain moment. There were no telephone wires. There were no telephones. There was no electricity. So at a certain point they put in these telephone poles, and you wouldn&#x27;t notice them now, but when they first went up, it was about all I did - stare out the window at these telephone wires and think how civilization had caught up with me and I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to escape after all. I wasn&#x27;t going to be able to live this 11th-century life that I thought I had found for myself. So that was the beginning. Then, of course, I noticed that birds came to the wires and that was how that song began. &#x27;Like a drunk in a midnight choir,&#x27; that&#x27;s also set on the island. Where drinkers, me included, would come up the stairs. There was great tolerance among the people for that because it could be in the middle of the night. You&#x27;d see three guys with their arms around each other, stumbling up the stairs and singing these impeccable thirds. So that image came from the island: &#x27;Like a drunk in a midnight choir.&#x27;

In 1988, Cohen explained to John McKenna of RTÉ in Ireland that &quot;Story of Isaac&quot; was an anti-war protest song but added, &quot;I was careful in that song to try and put it beyond the pure, beyond the simple, anti-war protest, that it also is. Because it says at the end there the man of war the man of peace, the peacock spreads his deadly fan. In other words it isn&#x27;t necessarily for war that we&#x27;re willing to sacrifice each other. We&#x27;ll get some idea – some magnificent idea – that we&#x27;re willing to sacrifice each other for; it doesn&#x27;t necessarily have to involve an opponent or an ideology, but human beings being what they are we&#x27;re always going to set up people to die for some absurd situation that we define as important.&quot; In the same interview, Cohen confirmed that &quot;Seems So Long Ago, Nancy&quot; was inspired by a woman he had grown up with in Montreal:
I think that the world throws up certain kinds of figures. Sometime in abundance, sometimes very rarely, and that some of these figures act as archetypes or prototypes for another generation which will manifest these characteristics a lot more easily, maybe a lot more gracefully, but not a lot more heroically. Another twenty years later she would have been just like you know, the hippest girl on the block. But twenty years before she was - there was no reference to her, so in a certain way she was doomed.

In sheet music for the album, a song titled &quot;Priests&quot; was included, and although reportedly recorded, it didn&#x27;t appear on the LP or on any subsequent Cohen record. The song was recorded by Judy Collins on her 1967 album &quot;Wildflowers&quot;, and by Richie Havens on his 1969 album &quot;Richard P. Havens, 1983&quot;.

The album cover is a simple black-and-white photo heavily matted as to almost wash out Cohen&#x27;s face. The back cover features a black-and-white photo of his Norwegian girlfriend Marianne Ihlen sitting at a desk with a typewriter, books and some papers. The picture was taken on the Greek island of Hydra. Cohen used their seven-year relationship as the basis for several of some his earliest songs, including &quot;So Long, Marianne&quot;, &quot;Hey, That&#x27;s No Way To Say Goodbye&quot;, and &quot;Bird on the Wire&quot;.

==Reception==
&quot;Songs From a Room&quot; was released in April 1969 and hit #63 on the U.S. charts and #2 in the UK. A single, &quot;The Old Revolution&quot;, was released but did not chart. Like his debut LP, it received mixed reviews from critics, who were put off by his unusual singing voice but intrigued by the songs. In the original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, Alec Dubro wrote, &quot;Well, it looks like Leonard Cohen&#x27;s second try won&#x27;t have them dancing in the streets either. It doesn&#x27;t take a great deal of listening to realize that Cohen can&#x27;t sing, period. And yet, the record grows on you...&quot; Mark Deming of AllMusic calls it &quot;something of a letdown&quot; and &quot;neither as striking or self-assured as &quot;Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot;&quot; but concedes, &quot;Despite the album&#x27;s flaws, &quot;Songs from a Room&quot;&#x27;s strongest moments convey a naked intimacy and fearless emotional honesty that&#x27;s every bit as powerful as the debut, and it left no doubt that Cohen was a major creative force in contemporary songwriting.&quot; Writing in 2011, Cohen biographer Anthony Reynolds declared, &quot;Compared to the relative &#x27;party&#x27; of the previous album, &quot;Songs From a Room&quot; is the hangover of the morning after... Yet there was a voluptuousness in the album&#x27;s austerity, a richness of the &#x27;less is more&#x27; variety.&quot; Amazon.com raves that &quot;Songs From a Room&quot; is &quot;fully loaded with poetic classics.&quot; In a 2014 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; readers poll ranking the top ten Leonard Cohen songs, &quot;Bird on a Wire&quot; came in at #5.

Many of the songs from Cohen&#x27;s second album would appear on 1973&#x27;s &quot;Live Songs&quot;, a collection of performances from 1970 and 1972. &quot;Songs from a Room&quot; was released on CD in 1990. A digitally remastered version, including two bonus tracks produced by David Crosby, was released in February 2007.

==Original songs and their covers==
&quot;Bird on the Wire&quot;, described by Cohen as a simple country song, has been covered by many musicians including Jennifer Warnes (his one-time backup singer), The Neville Brothers, Joe Cocker, Willie Nelson, The Lilac Time, Esther Ofarim, Johnny Cash, Fairport Convention and subsequently their guitarist Richard Thompson.

&quot;Story of Isaac&quot;, based on the Old Testament story of God&#x27;s demand that Isaac be sacrificed by his father Abraham, has also been covered by a number of musicians including Judy Collins, Suzanne Vega, Linda Thompson, The Johnstons, Pain Teens, and Roy Buchanan.

&quot;Seems So Long Ago, Nancy&quot; has been translated in Italian by Fabrizio De André and included in his album &quot;Volume 8&quot; (1975).

&quot;You Know Who I Am&quot; was covered by Mama Cass in her 1968 album &quot;Dream a Little Dream&quot; and by Esther Ofarim on the 1968 album &quot;Esther Ofarim&quot;.

==The Partisan==

&quot;The Partisan&quot; is Cohen&#x27;s cover of the French song &quot;La Complainte du partisan&quot; by Emmanuel d&#x27;Astier and Anna Marly, which is about the French resistance during World War II.
The English translation was written by Hy Zaret. The rock journalist Alex Young notes, &quot;[Cohen] is often incorrectly credited as the composer of the song – although he is certainly responsible for its survival.&quot; Young also notes that the English translation that Cohen recorded differs from the French in that it excludes the direct references that d&#x27;Astier and Marly made in the original lyrics to the occupation of France by Nazi Germany.

<text>was a Japanese general who served in the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II, and was subsequently convicted of war crimes. Finding his punishment to be too light, Imamura built a replica of his prison in his garden and confined himself there until his death.

==Early career==
A native of Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Imamura&#x27;s father was a judge. Imamura graduated from the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1907 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the infantry on 26 December 1907. He was promoted to lieutenant in November 1910 and attended the Army War College in 1915. He was promoted to captain in 1917 and was sent to England as a military attaché the following year. He was promoted to major in August 1922 and to lieutenant-colonel in August 1926. In April 1927, he was appointed as a military attaché to British India. Promoted to colonel on 1 August 1930, he held staff positions in the operations section of the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff from 1931 to 1932.

His younger brother was Imamura Hosaku, an officer in the Kwantung Army who fought in the Chinese Civil War as a mercenary for the Kuomintang.

==Wars in China==
With the January 28 incident of 1932, he was sent to take command of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) 57th Infantry Regiment. On his return to Japan, he became commandant of the Narashino Army School from 1932 to 1935.

In March 1935, Imamura was promoted from regimental commander to brigade commander of the IJA 40th Infantry Brigade with the rank of major general. He was assigned as deputy chief of staff of the Kwantung Army in Manchukuo in March 1936. He was recalled to Japan to assume the post of commandant of the Toyama Army Infantry School from 1937 to 1938.

Promoted to the rank of lieutenant general in March 1938, Imamura was given command of the IJA 5th Division based in China, which he continued to command in the early stages of the Second Sino-Japanese War to 1940. From 1940 to 1941, he was Deputy Inspector-General of Military Training, deputy to one of the most powerful officials in the Japanese Army. He was subsequently appointed commander in chief of the Twenty Third Army.

==Pacific War==
Imamura became the commander of the Sixteenth Army in November 1941 and was directed to lead that army in the invasion of the Dutch East Indies. As his fleet approached Java, his transport, the &quot;Shinshu (Ryujo) Maru&quot;, was sunk by torpedoes, probably by friendly fire, in the Battle of Sunda Strait and he was forced to swim to shore.

Imamura adopted an unusually lenient policy towards the local population of the former Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia), which was often in conflict with general opinions and plans of the senior staff of the Southern Army and Imperial General Headquarters. However, his policies won much support from the population (particularly in Java, where he was based) and helped to mildly reduce the difficulties of the Japanese military occupation. In late 1942, he assumed command of the new Eighth Area Army, responsible for the Seventeenth Army in the Solomon Islands campaign and the Eighteenth Army in the New Guinea campaign. Imamura was then based at Rabaul in New Britain. Imamura was promoted to general in 1943. 

==Trial for war crimes and punishment==
Along with the naval commander at Rabaul, Vice Admiral Jinichi Kusaka, Imamura surrendered the Japanese forces in New Guinea and the southern Pacific Islands to Australian forces, representing the Allies, in September 1945. Imamura was detained at Rabaul by the Australian Army, as he and troops under his command were accused of war crimes, including the execution of Allied prisoners of war. One infamous example, called the &quot;pig-basket atrocity&quot;, occurred when prisoners captured in eastern Java were transported in bamboo baskets used for pigs. In April 1946, Imamura wrote to the Australian commander at Rabaul, requesting that his own trial for war crimes be expedited in order to speed the prosecution of war criminals under his command. Imamura was charged with &quot;unlawfully [disregarding and failing] to discharge his duty... to control the members of his command, whereby they committed brutal atrocities and other high crimes&quot;. He was tried by an Australian military court at Rabaul on 1–16 May 1947; he was convicted and sentenced to imprisonment for ten years. Imamura served his imprisonment at Sugamo Prison in Tokyo until he was released in 1954. He considered his imprisonment too light with respect to his responsibility for the crimes of his subordinates, so he had a replica of the prison built in his garden, and he stayed there until his death in 1968.

<doc id="1101616" wikidata="Q5122617" url="?curid=1101616" title="Citizens' Assembly on Electoral Reform (British Columbia)">
<text>The Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform was created by the government of British Columbia, Canada to investigate changes to the provincial electoral system. On October 25, 2004, the citizens&#x27; assembly proposed replacing the province&#x27;s existing first past the post (FPTP) system with BC-STV, a single transferable vote (STV) system. This recommendation was put to the electorate in a referendum in 2005 held during that year&#x27;s provincial election. The provincial government required the referendum to achieve a super-majority of 60 percent of voters and simple majorities in 60 percent of the 79 districts in order to pass. The second of these thresholds was easily met, with a majority supporting the reform in 77 out of 79 electoral districts, but the overall vote fell short of the 60 percent requirement, with 57.69 percent of the votes in favour. A second referendum in 2009 on adopting the STV system also failed to pass carrying 8 electoral districts and 39.09 percent of the overall vote.

The assembly has been credited with inspiring experiments in Canada (including Ontario), Ireland and Australia among others.

==History==
During the 2001 provincial election, the Liberal Party promised to create a citizens&#x27; assembly to consider changes to the provincial electoral system (as opposed to forming a Royal Commission, as New Zealand did). The recommendation of the assembly would then be put as a referendum. In December 2002, Gordon Gibson submitted his report, recommending an assembly composed of randomly selected citizens, two from each of the province&#x27;s 79 electoral districts. In May 2003, the Legislature unanimously adopted the concept and most of the details.

==Selection process==

Counting the chair, the BC Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform was composed of 161 members: one man and one woman randomly selected from each of BC&#x27;s 79 electoral districts, two Aboriginal members and a chair. Assembly members were selected by a civic lottery that aimed for balance by gender, age group and geographical distribution of the population.

Selection of members for the assembly involved a three-stage process:
* Stage one began in August 2003 when 15,800 invitations were mailed to randomly identified British Columbians. To ensure even geographical representation, 200 invitations were extended in each constituency. Invitees were asked if they were willing to put their names into a draw for future candidacy.
* In stage two, the names of respondents expressing interest went into a pool for their constituency. Positive respondents were organized into 79 groups of 20, with some structuring to ensure an even split between men and women and reflect the age distribution of individuals in the constituency. These candidates were then invited to information meetings where they heard presentations about the assembly and were asked to publicly confirm their eligibility and interest in participating.
* In stage three, the names of those who responded positively were sealed into envelopes and entered into a final draw. Two people from each district pool, one man and one woman, were selected by random draw for membership in the Citizens&#x27; Assembly. Selection into the assembly continued until December 2003. Two additional members, representing First Nations communities, were added after the selection of the original 158.

==Assembly proceedings==

From January to May 2004, the assembly conducted a twelve-week &quot;learning phase&quot; involving expert presentations, group discussions and access to source materials. Work included a review of electoral systems in use around the world and their various effects on the political process. This was followed by a public consultation phase lasting from May to June. Assembly members held over 50 public hearings and received a total of 1603 written submissions.

Between September and October 2004, the members deliberated over which electoral system to recommend, emphasizing three values deemed most important: fairness of representation, local representation and voter choice. Among the alternatives considered were a mixed member proportional system (MMP) and a single transferable vote (STV) system.

On October 23 and 24, 2004, the assembly voted on different options in three separate votes. A first vote asked members to express their preference for MMP or STV. This vote yielded a strong but not unanimous preference for STV: 123 votes for STV versus 31 for MMP. Members then voted between retaining FPTP or moving to STV. There was a strong preference for STV: 142 votes for STV versus 11 for retaining FPTP. Finally, the assembly voted on whether to submit a recommendation in favour of STV to the public in a referendum on May 17, 2005, which passed with 146 in favour and 7 against.

On December 10, the assembly&#x27;s final report, titled &quot;Making Every Vote Count: The Case for Electoral Reform in British Columbia&quot;, was presented to the BC legislature by the assembly. It recommended changing the electoral system to a localized version of STV called BC-STV. A separate final report on the work of the assembly was submitted to the legislature by the Special Committee on the Citizens&#x27; Assembly on Electoral Reform in February 2005.

== Outcomes ==
In May 2005, the recommendations from the assembly were approved by 57.7 percent of voters in a referendum and were supported by a majority of voters in 77 of the province&#x27;s 79 electoral districts. However, the provincial government at the time required the referendum to attain a super-majority to pass, including:

# 60 percent popular support across the province
# 50 percent approval in 60 percent of the province&#x27;s 79 electoral districts or 48 electoral districts

With the first condition unmet, no change ensued. Similar recommendations received support from 39.1 percent of voters in a follow-up referendum in 2009.

The assembly has been credited with inspiring and popularizing the concept of Citizens&#x27; Assemblies around the world, including in Canada (including Ontario), Ireland and Australia among others.

== Analysis ==
Michael Pal noted that had the decision been made to set a threshold below 60 percent, that the measure likely would have passed.

James Fishkin argued that because the process was not public, and was not widely understood, that the recommendations did not carry as much weight as they otherwise would.

The resulting assembly had representation biases due to its geographical selection, with the impact of self-selection on the process resulting in fewer non-voters and disproportionately middle-aged and educated participants.

According to André Blais, Kenneth Carty and Patrick Fournier, members of the assembly appeared dissatisfied with BC&#x27;s current electoral system, while surveys of the public indicated it to be relatively satisfied.

Lang noted two similarities across the assembly: an interest in learning, especially about the political process, and a commitment to process once it started. She wrote, &quot;this is likely to have contributed to the excellent working dynamic within the Assembly&quot;.

<doc id="1101618" wikidata="Q1476479" url="?curid=1101618" title="Witchetty grub">
<text>The witchetty grub (also spelled witchety grub or witjuti grub) is a term used in Australia for the large, white, wood-eating larvae of several moths. In particular, it applies to the larvae of the cossid moth &quot;Endoxyla leucomochla&quot;, which feeds on the roots of the witchetty bush (after which the grubs are named) that is widespread throughout the Northern Territory and also typically found in parts of Western Australia and South Australia, although it is also found elsewhere throughout Australia.
The term can also apply to larvae of other cossid moths, ghost moths (Hepialidae), and longhorn beetles (Cerambycidae). The term is used mainly when the larvae are being considered as food. The grub is the most important insect food of the desert and has historically been a staple in the diets of Aboriginal Australians.

==Terminology==
The Arabana term for the grub is (with emphasis on initial syllables); means grub, and refers to the shrub, not the grub itself. Similarly, Ngalea peoples called the insect &quot;mako wardaruka&quot;, meaning grubs of the wardaruka (&quot;Acacia ligulata&quot;) shrub. The Pitjantjatjara name is &quot;maku&quot;. It has been suggested that the word &quot;witchetty&quot; comes from the Adynyamathanha word , meaning &quot;hooked stick&quot;, and , meaning &quot;grub&quot;.

==Description==
The different larvae are said to taste similar. Edible either raw or lightly cooked in hot ashes, they are sought as a high-protein food by Aboriginal Australians. The raw witchetty grub tastes similar to almonds; however, when cooked, the skin becomes crisp like roast chicken, while the inside becomes light yellow, like a fried egg, and the taste has been anecdotally described variously as like scrambled egg, chicken, or a &quot;prawn with peanut sauce&quot;.

These grubs live in trees. They can also be found in black wattle trees, and are considered to be the reason why wattles die within 10 to 15 years. The roots of the &quot;Acacia kempeana&quot; shrub are another source of the grubs.

When held, as a defence mechanism, the grubs will secrete a brown liquid.

==Cultural significance==

Witchetty grubs feature as Dreamings in many Aboriginal paintings.

<text>Human waste (or human excreta) refers to the waste products of the human digestive system, menses, and human metabolism including urine and feces. As part of a sanitation system that is in place, human waste is collected, transported, treated and disposed of or reused by one method or another, depending on the type of toilet being used, ability by the users to pay for services and other factors. Fecal sludge management is used to deal with fecal matter collected in on-site sanitation systems such as pit latrines and septic tanks. 

The sanitation systems in place differ vastly around the world, with many people in developing countries having to resort to open defecation where human waste is deposited in the environment, for lack of other options. Improvements in &quot;water, sanitation and hygiene&quot; (WASH) around the world is a key public health issue within international development and is the focus of Sustainable Development Goal 6. 

People in developed countries tend to use flush toilets where the human waste is mixed with water and transported to sewage treatment plants. 

Children&#x27;s excreta can be disposed of in diapers and mixed with municipal solid waste. Diapers are also sometimes dumped directly into the environment, leading to public health risks.

==Terminology==
The term &quot;human waste&quot; is used in the general media to mean several things, such as sewage, sewage sludge, blackwater - in fact anything that may contain some human feces. In the stricter sense of the term, human waste is in fact human excreta, i.e. urine and feces, with or without water being mixed in. For example, dry toilets collect human waste without the addition of water.

==Health aspects==
Human waste is considered a biowaste, as it is a vector for both viral and bacterial diseases. It can be a serious health hazard if it gets into sources of drinking water. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that nearly 2.2 million people die annually from diseases caused by contaminated water, such as cholera or dysentery. A major accomplishment of human civilization has been the reduction of disease transmission via human waste through the practice of hygiene and sanitation, which can employ a variety of different technologies.

== Environmental aspects ==
Even high-mountains are not free from human waste. Each year, millions of mountaineers visit high-mountain areas. They generate tonnes of feces and urine annually which cause environmental pollution. Human faeces pose a greater threat to the mountain environment than uncontrolled deposit of urine, due to the higher pathogen content of feces.

==Methods of processing==

Methods of processing depend on the type of human waste: 
* Sewage is treated via sewage treatment 
* Sewage sludge is treated by sewage sludge treatment 
* Fecal matter from dry toilets may undergo composting
* Fecal sludge from pit latrines is treated and managed with an approach called fecal sludge management
The amount of water mixed with human waste can be reduced by the use of waterless urinals and composting toilets and by recycling greywater. The most common method of human waste treatment in rural areas where municipal sewage systems are unavailable is the use of septic tank systems. In remote rural places without sewage or septic systems, small populations allow for the continued use of honey buckets and sewage lagoons (see anaerobic lagoon) without the threat of disease presented by places with denser populations. Bucket toilets are used by rural villages in Alaska where, due to permafrost, conventional waste treatment systems cannot be utilized.

==Uses==

Human waste in the form of wastewater (sewage) is used to irrigate and fertilize fields in many parts of the developing world where fresh water is unavailable. There is great potential for wastewater agriculture to produce more food for consumers in urban areas, as long as there is sufficient education about the dangers of eating such food uncooked.

<text>Robert John Ayling (born 3 August 1946), also known as Bob Ayling, is a British retired lawyer and businessman who has worked with a variety of high-profile companies and organisations. From 1996 to 2000, he was the CEO of British Airways. He also served as chairman of Her Majesty&#x27;s Courts and Tribunals Service, Dŵr Cymru (Welsh Water), and Dyson. Ayling was appointed a CBE in the Queen&#x27;s 2018 Birthday Honors List.

==Early life==
Ayling was born in Battersea the son of a grocer, George and civil servant Hilda. He was educated at King&#x27;s College School, Wimbledon but left school at 16 after his father&#x27;s business failed, and took articles with a solicitor. He passed his professional examinations by 19 and in 1968 was admitted a solicitor at 21.

==Career==
Ayling, a lawyer, began his career as a solicitor in private practice before joining the Department of Trade and Industry in 1974.

In 1985, he joined British Airways (BA), initially as legal director, where he was responsible for the legal aspects of BA&#x27;s privatisation and the acquisition of British Caledonian. He went on to hold a series of senior management positions including director of human resources and director of marketing and operations.

Ayling was appointed group managing director of BA in 1993 and chief executive in 1996.

A key policy of Ayling&#x27;s time was reduction in operating costs to enable the airline to survive in the more competitive markets following de-regulation of the aviation industry. His policies, including setting up in 1998 of the low cost airline &#x27;Go&#x27; with Barbara Cassani as CEO, drew intense hostility from the trade unions. He also pursued a merger and establishment of a strategic alliance with American Airlines and BA&#x27;s investment in Iberia. Ayling re-introduced beds on long haul flights and was the main protagonist and promoter of BA&#x27;s London Eye project for the Millennium. In 2000, he was replaced at BA, following continued trade union opposition, by Rod Eddington.

Ayling joined the board of Dyson Ltd in 2001 serving until 2012, including a stint as chairman from 2010 to 2012. He was also appointed a non-executive Director of Holidaybreak Plc, the specialist holiday and activity group, in February 2003, before becoming chairman in June 2003. He retired in April 2009.

He was appointed a non-executive director of Dŵr Cymru (Welsh Water) in 2008, becoming chairman in 2009. He retired in 2017.

He was appointed first independent chairman of HM Courts and Tribunals Service on its creation in April 2011. He led the major Reform of the Service serving under six Lord Chancellors and three Lord Chief Justices. He retired in April 2018.

<doc id="1101632" wikidata="Q6755122" url="?curid=1101632" title="Marayong, New South Wales">
<text>Marayong is a suburb of Sydney, in the state of New South Wales, Australia. Marayong is located approximately 32 kilometres north west of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of the City of Blacktown and is part of the Greater Western Sydney region.

==History==
The name &#x27;Marayong&#x27; is derived from the Dharug language word &#x27;Mariyung&#x27;, which means &quot;emu&quot; or &quot;place of cranes&quot;. The name was first given by the New South Wales Railways to the railway station when it opened in October 1922.

Around 1900–1905, large areas were subdivided and market gardens and poultry farms were established. The area was part of Quakers Hill but in 1926 the Marayong Progress Association applied to have Marayong made a suburb, in its own right.

The area was mostly rural until the 1960s. Housing Commission (public housing) estates, opened in the 1960s, marked the urbanization of the suburb predominantly south of the railway line. In addition, an industrial area was also released north of the railway line.

==Population==
The population of Marayong was 7,834 at the 2021 census. The median household income of $1,593 per week was a bit less than the national average. There were a substantial number of people born in India (14.1%) and the number of Catholics in Marayong (30.6%) was well above the national average.

==Transport==

Marayong railway station is on the Richmond Line. It provides services out to Richmond and in to the city via Blacktown and Parramatta.

Years ago, Motor Rail No. 1 would run between Blacktown stopping at Marayong Station en route.

Richmond Road marks the southern boundary of the suburb and provides links to Blacktown and Richmond while the Westlink M7 curls around the suburb and can be accessed via the Sunnyholt Road intersection at Kings Park or the Richmond Road intersection at Dean Park.

==Schools==
There are two government-run primary schools in the suburb, Marayong Public and Marayong Heights Public. There is also a Catholic primary school, St Andrews Primary and a high school St Andrews College which is divided into two campuses, the Holy Family campus on Quakers Road catering to years 7–10 and the John Paul II senior campus on Breakfast Road. The nearest government-run high schools are Quakers Hill High School, Blacktown Boys High School, Blacktown Girls High School and Doonside Technology High School.

<text>Saints Crispin and Crispinian are the Christian patron saints of cobblers, curriers, tanners, and leather workers. They were beheaded during the reign of Diocletian; the date of their execution is given as 25 October 285 or 286.
==Legend==
Born to a noble Roman family in the 3rd century AD, Crispin and Crispinian fled persecution for their faith, ending up at Soissons, where they preached Christianity to the Gauls while making shoes by night. It is stated that they were twin brothers.

They earned enough by their trade to support themselves and aid people experiencing poverty. Their success attracted the ire of Rictus Varus, governor of Belgic Gaul, who had them tortured and thrown into the river with millstones around their necks. Though they survived, they were beheaded by the emperor 286.

==Veneration==
The feast day of Saints Crispin and Crispinian is 25 October. Although this feast was removed from the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s universal liturgical calendar following the Second Vatican Council, the two saints are still commemorated on that day in the most recent edition of the Roman Church&#x27;s martyrology.

In the sixth century, a stately basilica was erected over these saints&#x27; graves at Soissons, and St. Eligius, a famous goldsmith, made a costly shrine for the head of St. Crispinian. Their remains were afterwards removed, partly by Charlemagne to Osnabrück, and partly to the church of San Lorenzo in Panisperna in Rome.

They are the patron saints of cobblers, glove makers, lace makers, lace workers, leather workers, saddle makers, saddlers, shoemakers, tanners, and weavers. Especially in France, but also in England and other parts of Europe, the festival of St Crispin was for centuries the occasion of solemn processions and merry-making, in which guilds of shoemakers took the chief part.
Crispin and Crispinian are remembered in the Church of England with a commemoration on 25 October.

==Cultural references==
The Battle of Agincourt was fought on Saint Crispin&#x27;s feastday. (The English tradition placed the twins at Canterbury rather than Gaul.) Shakespeare&#x27;s St. Crispin&#x27;s Day Speech (sometimes called the &quot;Band Of Brothers&quot; Speech) from his play &quot;Henry V&quot; has immortalized the day. Also, for the Midsummer&#x27;s Day Festival in the third act of &quot;Die Meistersinger&quot;, Wagner has the shoemakers&#x27; guild enter singing a song of praise to St. Crispin.

A 16th-century legend links them to the town of Faversham, Kent, England. A plaque at Faversham commemorates their association with the town. They are also celebrated in the name of the old pub &quot;Crispin and Crispianus&quot; at Strood in Kent.

<text>Recent Songs is the sixth studio album by Leonard Cohen, released in 1979. Produced by Cohen alongside Henry Lewy, it was a return to his normal acoustic folk music sound after the Phil Spector-driven experimentation of &quot;Death of a Ladies&#x27; Man&quot;, but now with many jazz and Oriental influences.

==Recording and composition==
After recording &quot;Death of a Ladies&#x27; Man&quot; with Phil Spector, a chaotically recorded album that would garner Cohen the worst reviews of his career, the singer decided to produce his next album himself with assistance from Henry Lewy, who had previously worked regularly with Joni Mitchell. The album included Gypsy violin player Raffi Hakopian, English string arranger Jeremy Lubbock, Armenian oud player (located in Los Angeles) John Bilezikjian and even a Mexican Mariachi band. Long-time Cohen collaborator Jennifer Warnes appeared prominently in vocal tracks. Members of the band Passenger, whom Cohen also met through Mitchell, played on four of the songs. Garth Hudson of the Band also appeared on the album.

Unlike the psychodrama evident on the Spector-dominated &quot;Death of a Ladies&#x27; Man&quot;, &quot;Recent Songs&quot;, which was recorded at A&amp;M Studios in Hollywood in the spring of 1979, sounds lucid by comparison. In the book &quot;Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life&quot;, oud player John Bilezikjian recalls to author Anthony Reynolds: &quot;Sessions started in the afternoon and we&#x27;d go into the evenings. No drinking, that I saw, no visitors. Finished at a reasonable time, no early hours stuff...He let me do whatever it was I wanted to do. He trusted my sense of musicality. He would be with a microphone and headphones and we&#x27;d all be wired up in our separate booths and we&#x27;d listen and add our part.&quot; The album had a largely acoustic, Eastern-tinged flavor and was augmented by the singing of Jennifer Warnes and newcomer Sharon Robinson, who would go on to become one of Cohen&#x27;s favorite musical collaborators.

&quot;Came So Far For Beauty&quot; originated from Cohen&#x27;s collaboration with &quot;New Skin for the Old Ceremony&quot; producer John Lissauer for a project called &quot;Songs For Rebecca&quot;, which was scrapped (Lissauer received co-writing credit). In the liner notes to the album, Cohen thanks his Zen Master Roshi for inspiring one of the songs: &quot;I owe my thanks to Joshu Sasaki upon whose exposition of an early Chinese text I based &#x27;Ballad of the Absent Mare.&#x27;&quot; The metaphoric lyrics are based on the twelfth-century &quot;Ten Bulls&quot; (or &quot;Ten Ox-herding Pictures&quot;). According to Anthony Reynolds 2010 Cohen memoir, &quot;The Guests&quot; was based on a 13th-century Persian poem and was chosen to open the album because of the enthusiastic response it had evoked when Cohen played it to friends. The album also features Cohen&#x27;s interpretation of &quot;Un Canadien errant&quot;, a song written in 1842 by Antoine Gérin-Lajoie after the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837–38. Curiously, Cohen and Lewy opted to use a Mexican Mariachi band on the song, which is arguably the only cheerful sonic outburst on what is otherwise a languid album (the Mariachi band is also employed more subtly on &quot;The Guests&quot; and &quot;The Ballad of the Absent Mare&quot;). Cohen&#x27;s 2004 song &quot;The Faith&quot; is based on the same folk tune as &quot;Un Canadien errant&quot;, with Cohen&#x27;s collaborator Anjani Thomas acknowledging in a 2005 interview (Old Ideas: Notes on &quot;Dear Heather&quot;) that he used an alternate 1979 track for &quot;Un Canadien errant&quot;, adding a new vocal line with completely new lyrics, for his 2004 album &quot;Dear Heather&quot;. Cohen also recorded a studio version of the disco-infused &quot;Do I Have to Dance All Night&quot;, which had been previously released as a live single in France in 1976, but it was not included on the album.

The musicians who recorded &quot;Recent Songs&quot; with Cohen served as his tour band later that year, highlights of which can be heard on the 2001 release &quot;Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979&quot;. Cohen performed several songs from the LP in concert, such as &quot;The Guests&quot;, &quot;The Window&quot;, and the Sinatraesque &quot;The Smokey Life&quot;. Speaking with &quot;Mojo&quot;&#x27;s Sylvie Simmons in 2001, Cohen was effusive in his praise for the album:
:I think I like &quot;Recent Songs&quot; the best. The producer was Henry Levy - I was studying with Roshi at the time in Los Angeles and it was appropriate that I worked with a Los Angeles producer. Joni Mitchell introduced me to him. He had produced several of her early records. He had that great quality that Bob Johnston had: he had a lot of faith in the singer and he just let it happen. He introduced me to the group Passenger...Things had changed - these were my own songs and the musical ideas were specifically mine. I&#x27;d always wanted to combine those Middle Eastern or Eastern European sounds with the rhythmic possibilities of a jazz or rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll rhythm section.

The painting of Cohen on the album cover is by the artist Dianne Lawrence. It is inspired by the album cover portrait taken by photographer, Hazel Field for Leonard Cohen&#x27;s 2001 release, &quot;Field Commander Cohen: Tour of 1979&quot;. &quot;The Guests&quot; would be the opening song of Cohen&#x27;s 1983 made-for-TV short musical &quot;I Am a Hotel&quot;, which would also feature &quot;The Gypsy&#x27;s Wife&quot; as part of the narration.

==Reception==

&quot;Recent Songs&quot; received warm reviews and was viewed as a return to form by many critics after the shocking &quot;Death of a Ladies&#x27; Man&quot;. At the time of the album&#x27;s release, &quot;The New York Times&quot; said it provided &quot;an ideal musical idiom for his idiosyncrasies&quot; and listed it among its top ten records of 1979. In the original 1980 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, Debra Rae Cohen said: &quot;There&#x27;s not a cut on &quot;Recent Songs&quot; without something to offer...and at least four or five tunes are full-fledged masterpieces. I wish I had a tape loop of; &#x27;The Guests&#x27; which features a hold-your-breath, haunting melody.&quot; The &quot;Tucson Citizen&quot; panned the &quot;heavy touches of a Dylanesque vocal inflection on his more country numbers.&quot;

William Ruhlmann of AllMusic observes, &quot;His writing had become increasingly bitter and angry during the 1970s in the books &quot;The Energy of Slaves&quot; and &quot;Death of a Lady&#x27;s Man&quot; as well as in his lyrics, but there was a new equanimity in these &quot;Recent Songs&quot; that began with the welcoming introduction of &#x27;The Guests&#x27;...The album was full of references to absence and dislocation, but Cohen deliberately countered them with humor.&quot; Cohen biographer Anthony Reynolds took a dim view of the collection in 2010: &quot;For all its artistry, &quot;Recent Songs&quot; sounded bland and MOR...the album as a whole ploughed a self-indulgent, middling trough.&quot; The LP peaked at # 24 in Austria (where it went gold) and hit #56 in Germany.

==Cover versions==
&quot;Ballad of the Absent Mare&quot; has been covered by several artists, notably Emmylou Harris on the album &quot;Cowgirl&#x27;s Prayer&quot; (as &quot;Ballad of a Runaway Horse&quot;) and Perla Batalla feat. David Hidalgo on the album &quot;Bird on the Wire: the Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot;. Martha Wainwright performs a cover version of the song &quot;The Traitor&quot; in the tribute film &quot;Leonard Cohen: I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;. Nana Mouskouri has covered the song on several albums (&quot;Song for Liberty&quot;, &quot;Vivre Avec Toi&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ll Remember You&quot;, &quot;The Rose&quot;) and also sung the song in translation, for instance as &quot;Das Fest&quot; on her German language album &quot;Ich hab gelacht, ich hab geweint&quot;. The Canadian singer Patricia O&#x27;Callaghan performs covers of &quot;The Window&quot;, &quot;The Gypsy&#x27;s Wife&quot; and &quot;The Smokey Life&quot; on her fifth solo album released in 2012.

<text>Shanawdithit (ca. 1801 – June 6, 1829), also noted as Shawnadithit, Shawnawdithit, Nancy April and Nancy Shanawdithit, was the last known living member of the Beothuk people, who inhabited Newfoundland, Canada. Remembered for her contributions to the historical understanding of Beothuk culture, including drawings depicting interactions with European settlers, Shanawdithit died of tuberculosis in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland on June 6, 1829.

==Early life with the Beothuk==
Shanawdithit was born near a large lake on the island of Newfoundland in about 1801. At the time the Beothuk population was dwindling, their traditional way of life becoming increasingly unsustainable in the face of encroachment from both European colonial settlements and other Indigenous peoples, as well as infectious diseases from Europe such as smallpox against which they had little or no immunity. The Beothuks were also slowly being cut off from the sea, one of their food sources.

During this period, most Indigenous nations in the Americas tolerated some level of contact with European settlers. The resulting trade generally afforded them the opportunity to maintain at least a minimal standard of living. In contrast, Beothuks had long avoided this sort of interaction with outsiders. Trappers and furriers regarded the Beothuks as thieves and would sometimes attack them. As a child, Shanawdithit was shot by a white trapper while washing venison in a river. She suffered from the injury for some time, but recovered.

In 1819, Shanawdithit&#x27;s aunt Demasduit was captured by a party of settlers led by John Peyton Jr. and the few remaining Beothuks fled. In the spring of 1823, Shanawdithit lost her father, who died after falling through ice. Most of her extended family had already died from a combination of starvation, illness, exposure and attacks from European settlers. In April 1823, Shanawdithit, along with her mother, Doodebewshet, and her sister, whose Beothuk name is unknown, encountered trappers while searching for food in the Badger Bay area. William Cull and the three women were taken to St. John&#x27;s, where Shanawdithit&#x27;s mother and sister died of tuberculosis.

==Later life in the Newfoundland Colony==

The settlers in the Newfoundland Colony renamed Shanawdithit &quot;Nancy April&quot; after the month in which she was captured, taking her to Exploits Island where she worked as a servant in the Peyton household and learned some English. The colonial government hoped she would become a bridge to her people, but she refused to leave with any expedition, saying the Beothuks would kill anyone who had been with the Europeans, as a kind of religious sacrifice and redemption for those who had been killed.

In September 1828, Shanawdithit was relocated to St. John&#x27;s to live in the household of William Eppes Cormack, the founder of the Beothuk Institution. A Scottish emigrant, Newfoundland entrepreneur and philanthropist, he recorded much of what Shanawdithit told him about her people and added notes to her drawings. Shanawdithit stayed in Cormack&#x27;s care until early 1829 when he left Newfoundland. Cormack returned to Great Britain where he stayed for some time in Liverpool with John McGregor, a Scotsman whom he had known in Canada, sharing many of his materials on the Beothuks.

Following Cormack&#x27;s departure, Shanawdithit was cared for by the attorney general, James Simms. She spent the last nine months of her life at his home, having been in frail health for a number of years. William Carson tended her, but in 1829, Shanawdithit died in a St. John&#x27;s hospital after her long fight with tuberculosis. In addition to an obituary announcement in a local St. John&#x27;s newspaper on June 12, 1829, the death of Shanawdithit was reported in the London Times on September 14, 1829. The announcement noted that Shanawdithit &quot;exhibited extraordinary strong natural talents&quot; and identified the Beothuk as &quot;an anomaly in the history of man&quot; for not establishing or maintaining relationships with European settlers or other Indigenous peoples.

==After her death==
After Shanawdithit&#x27;s death Carson performed a postmortem and noted peculiarities with the parietal bone of the skull, eventually sending it to the Royal College of Physicians in London for study. Shanawdithit&#x27;s remains were buried in the graveyard of St. Mary the Virgin Church on the south side of St. John&#x27;s. In 1938, the Royal College of Physicians gave her skull to the Royal College of Surgeons. It was lost in the German Blitz bombing of London in World War II.

Meanwhile, in 1903, the church graveyard had been lost to railway construction. The church was torn down in 1963. A monument on the site reads: &quot;This monument marks the site of the Parish Church of St. Mary the Virgin during the period 1859–1963. Fishermen and sailors from many ports found a spiritual haven within its hallowed walls. Near this spot is the burying place of Nancy Shanawdithit, very probably the last of the Beothuks, who died on June 6, 1829&quot;.

==Legacy==
Shanawdithit played a vital role in documenting what little is known about the Beothuk people. Researcher Ingeborg Marshall has argued that a valid understanding of Beothuk history and culture is affected directly by how and by whom historical records were created, pointing to the ethnocentric nature of European accounts which positioned native populations as inherently inferior. She notes that without Shanawdithit&#x27;s accounts of her nation&#x27;s later life, the Beothuk voice is nearly absent from historical accounts.

Shanawdithit was recognized as a National Historic Person in 2000. The announcement coincided with the installation of a statue depicting Shanawdithit by Gerald Squires, titled &quot;The Spirit of the Beothuk,&quot; at the Beothuk Interpretation Centre near Boyd&#x27;s Cove. In 2007 a plaque commemorating her life was unveiled at St. John&#x27;s Bannerman Park acknowledging her contributions to the historical accounts of encounters between the Beothuk and European settlers, and the apprehension of her aunt, Demasduit, by John Peyton Jr.

Shanawdithit is widely known among Newfoundlanders. In 1851, a local paper, the &quot;Newfoundlander&quot;, called her &quot;a princess of Terra Nova&quot;. In 1999, &quot;The Telegram&quot; readers voted her the most notable Aboriginal person of the past 1,000 years. She had 57% of the votes.

Her story was the basis for the 2023 College of the North Atlantic Digital Filmmaking program&#x27;s intersession film project.

<text>The 1984 World Series was the championship series of Major League Baseball&#x27;s (MLB) 1984 season. The 81st edition of the World Series, it was a best-of-seven playoff played between the American League (AL) champion Detroit Tigers and the National League (NL) champion San Diego Padres. The Tigers won the series, four games to one. This was the city of Detroit&#x27;s first sports championship since the Tigers won the 1968 World Series.

This was the first World Series that Peter Ueberroth presided over as commissioner. Ueberroth began his tenure on October 1, succeeding Bowie Kuhn. Ueberroth had been elected as Kuhn&#x27;s successor prior to the 1984 season but did not assume the job until the postseason, as he was serving as the chairman of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, which ran from July 28 through August 12.

This was the last World Series in which the designated hitter was used for games played in an NL team&#x27;s ballpark in the World Series (as in even-numbered years, the DH would be used in all games, which was first instituted in 1976) until MLB&#x27;s adoption of the universal DH in 2022 and played the last outdoor day game in World Series history. The next World Series did not use the DH (as odd-numbered years saw the DH rule not in effect for the World Series). From 1986 until 2021, the DH would only be used in games played at the AL representative&#x27;s park.

==Background==

The San Diego Padres won the National League West division by 12 games over both the Atlanta Braves and the Houston Astros, then defeated the Chicago Cubs, three games to two, in the National League Championship Series. The Detroit Tigers won the American League East division by 15 games over the Toronto Blue Jays, then swept the Kansas City Royals, three games to none, in the American League Championship Series.

The World Series was scheduled to start and,
if it went beyond five games, end in the National League host park, being an even numbered year. But since Wrigley Field still did not have permanent lighting in 1984, MLB decided that, if the Cubs were to advance to the World Series, the American League host park would instead have the home field advantage for the series while the Cubs would host the middle three games. Those games were scheduled to be played over the weekend of October 12-14, if necessary, such that only one night game, scheduled for the 12th, would be lost.

The 1984 World Series was a rematch between managers Sparky Anderson (Detroit) and Dick Williams (San Diego). The two had previously faced off in the 1972 World Series, with Anderson managing the Cincinnati Reds and Williams helming the victorious Oakland Athletics. The 1984 Series was Anderson&#x27;s fifth overall as a manager—in addition to the 1972 Fall Classic, he had also managed the Reds during the 1970 World Series (which they lost to the Baltimore Orioles) and served as skipper during Cincinnati&#x27;s back-to-back world championships in 1975 and 1976. Anderson&#x27;s counterpart, Williams, was managing in his fourth World Series; he had headed the Boston Red Sox during the 1967 &quot;Impossible Dream&quot; season, when they won their first pennant in 21 years in a tight race over the Tigers, Minnesota Twins, and Chicago White Sox. After his Athletics won the 1972 World Series, Williams again led them to victory in the 1973 Series over the New York Mets.

Prior to 1984, only three managers (Joe McCarthy, Al Dark and Yogi Berra) had won pennants in both leagues. Nobody had ever won World Series as a manager in both leagues, thus ensuring that the winning manager of the 1984 Series would be the first to do so.

The 1984 World Series was also a battle of sorts between the multimillion-dollar American fast food chains. Domino&#x27;s Pizza founder Tom Monaghan owned the Tigers while McDonald&#x27;s founder Ray Kroc, who died several months before the 1984 World Series, owned the Padres. The series was informally known as the &quot;Fast Food Fall Classic&quot;. It would feature the first World Series game at Jack Murphy Stadium (Game 1) and the final World Series game at Tiger Stadium (Game 5).

===Detroit Tigers===
By May 24, 1984, the Detroit Tigers had just won their ninth straight game with Jack Morris on the mound winning his ninth game of the season. The Tigers record stood at 35–5, a major league record. In the next three games they would get swept by the Seattle Mariners and settle down to play .500 ball over the next 40 games. But in the end, they would wind up with a franchise record 104 wins and become only the third team in MLB history to lead the league wire-to-wire.

These Tigers were strong up the middle featuring all-stars at each middle position with catcher Lance Parrish setting a career high in home runs with 33, the record-setting duo of Lou Whitaker at second base and Alan Trammell at shortstop (they played together from 1977–95) and solid center-fielder Chet Lemon. In addition to Morris, the pitching staff was anchored by starters Dan Petry and Milt Wilcox, with eventual Cy Young Award and Most Valuable Player winner, Willie Hernández (9–3, 1.92 ERA, 32 saves), closing.

The Detroit Tigers signed ageless wonder free-agent Darrell Evans (their first free-agent signing since Tito Fuentes in 1977) prior to the season, and acquired first baseman Dave Bergman in a trade with the Philadelphia Phillies that also brought them the aforementioned Hernández. Bergman would settle in as the Tigers&#x27; everyday first baseman providing steady glove-work. And of course there was &quot;Mr. Clutch&quot;, right-fielder Kirk Gibson, who had a break-out year with 27 home runs, 29 stolen bases, 91 RBIs, and a .282 batting average.

After winning two World Championships with the 1975–76 Cincinnati Reds, manager Sparky Anderson was primed to win his first in the American League in his fifth full season with the Detroit Tigers. Anderson proved to be somewhat prophetic. He made a bold prediction (in mid-1979, when he joined the Tigers) that his team would be a pennant-winner within five years.

===San Diego Padres===
Williams was in his third season with the San Diego Padres after leading them to identical 81–81 (.500) records in 1982 and 1983. 1984 would mark only the second time in Padre history that the team would finish over .500, the other being an 84–78 record in 1978. With the Padres&#x27; NL pennant in 1984, Williams became the second manager to take three teams to the World Series (he had previously taken the 1967 Red Sox and the 1972 and 1973 Athletics to the Fall Classic).

The Padres set a franchise record for victories with 92 in 1984, being led by two veterans, first baseman Steve Garvey and third baseman Graig Nettles. Statistically, this team was not overwhelming, with Nettles and Kevin McReynolds leading the team with just 20 home runs. (The team eventually would lose McReynolds in Game 4 of the NLCS due to a broken wrist.) No player came close to 100 RBIs (Garvey, 86) or had over 30 doubles in the regular season, although Tony Gwynn won the first of his eight National League batting titles by hitting for a .351 average with 213 hits.

The pitching staff was average—a staff of twentysomethings and a 33-year-old closer, Goose Gossage (10–6, 25 SVs), who was signed as a free agent from the New York Yankees. Eric Show led the staff with 15 wins with Ed Whitson and lefty Mark Thurmond having identical 14–8 records. But the sterling bullpen, headed by Gossage and Craig &quot;Lefty&quot; Lefferts, held the staff together enough to take this team to the &quot;Big Show&quot; although they would falter and get ripped by the Tiger bats losing the Series in five games.

To get to the Series, the Padres had to overcome a two-games-to-none deficit against the Chicago Cubs in the NLCS, rallying to win the final three games. The 1984 Padres adopted Ray Parker Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; as their theme song (à la the 1979 Pittsburgh Pirates using Sister Sledge&#x27;s &quot;We Are Family&quot; as their theme song). During their playoff series against the Chicago Cubs, the Padre fans turned &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; into &quot;Cubbusters&quot;.

==Summary==
==Matchups==

===Game 1===

The Tigers struck first in Game 1 when Lou Whitaker doubled to lead off the top of the first and scored on Alan Trammell&#x27;s single but their starter Jack Morris (a 19-game winner during the season) struggled in the bottom half, as he surrendered two-out singles to Steve Garvey and Graig Nettles, followed by a two-run double to Terry Kennedy. Padre starter Mark Thurmond took a 2–1 lead into the fifth, but then surrendered a crucial two-out, two-run homer to Larry Herndon. Nettles and Kennedy both singled to open the San Diego sixth, but Morris snuffed out their momentum by striking out the rest of the side. Kurt Bevacqua started what looked to be a comeback with a leadoff double in the seventh, but was thrown out at third while attempting to stretch the hit into a triple. Despite the close call, Morris remained focused and set down the last nine remaining Padre batters for a complete game, 3–2 victory.

===Game 2===
In Game 2, Lou Whitaker, Alan Trammell and Kirk Gibson hit consecutive singles to lead off the top of the first and put the Tigers up 1–0. After Gibson stole second, Trammell scored on Lance Parrish&#x27;s sacrifice fly, then Darrell Evans&#x27;s RBI single made it 3–0 Tigers. Padre starter Ed Whitson was pulled after just innings. In the bottom of the inning, the Padres cut the lead to 3–1 on Graig Nettles&#x27;s sacrifice fly, then in the fourth, Bobby Brown&#x27;s RBI groundout made it 3–2 Tigers. Kurt Bevacqua then evened the series at 1–1 with a three-run home run in the fifth-inning off Dan Petry. To date, this remains the only World Series victory in Padres history. Andy Hawkins earned the win with shutout innings while Craig Lefferts pitched a three-inning save.

Game 2 at Jack Murphy Stadium marked the last MLB playoff game until the introduction of the universal DH in 2022 where the DH was used in a National League ballpark. Before this, any World Series game in an American League park used the DH (previously, the DH was used in alternating World Series), while pitchers batted in the NL parks. The next time the DH rule was used in a National League park was during a regular season series between the Toronto Blue Jays and Philadelphia Phillies during the 2010 season.

===Game 3===
By the time the 1984 World Series rolled around, Tiger Stadium (built in 1912) became the oldest ballpark to ever host a World Series game. That record was eclipsed by Boston&#x27;s Fenway Park (opened April 20, 1912, the same day as Tiger Stadium), which hosted in , , and , and then by Chicago&#x27;s Wrigley Field (opened in 1914), which hosted the Fall Classic in until being reclaimed by Fenway Park in .

Tim Lollar failed to make it out of the second inning as Detroit erupted for four runs. Chet Lemon singled with one out, then with two outs, Marty Castillo&#x27;s home run made it 2–0 Tigers. Lou Whitaker then walked and scored on Alan Trammell&#x27;s double. A walk and single loaded the bases before Greg Booker relieved Lollar and walked Larry Herndon to force in another run. The Padres got on the board in the third when back-to-back leadoff singles off Milt Wilcox was followed by an RBI groundout by Steve Garvey, but in the bottom of the inning, Booker walked three to load the bases with two outs. Greg Harris in relief hit Kirk Gibson with a pitch to force in the Tigers&#x27; last run. The Padres scored their last run in the seventh on Graig Nettles&#x27;s sacrifice fly with runners on second and third off Bill Scherrer. Willie Hernández pitched innings of one-hit relief for the save. The 5–2 victory gave the Tigers a two games-to-one series lead.

===Game 4===
Alan Trammell drilled a pair of two-run homers in the first and third innings to account for all of Detroit&#x27;s offense as the Tigers beat Eric Show to take a three games-to-one lead in the Series. Jack Morris got his second Series victory in another complete-game effort, allowing two runs on Terry Kennedy&#x27;s home run in the second and a wild pitch in the ninth to Kennedy that scored Steve Garvey, and five hits.

===Game 5===
For the fourth consecutive game, the Padres&#x27; starting pitcher did not make it past the third inning, as the Tigers jumped on Mark Thurmond for three runs in the first inning. Lou Whitaker singled to lead off, then Kirk Gibson homered an out later, followed by consecutive singles by Lance Parrish, Larry Herndon and Chet Lemon. The Padres got on the board in the third when Bobby Brown hit a leadoff single off Dan Petry, moved to third on two groundouts and scored on Steve Garvey&#x27;s single. The Padres rallied to tie the score in the fourth when with runners on second and third Brown&#x27;s sacrifice fly and Alan Wiggins&#x27;s RBI single scored a run each to knock Petry out of the game, but the Tigers loaded the bases in the fifth off Andy Hawkins when Rusty Kuntz&#x27;s sacrifice fly put them up 4–3. Parrish&#x27;s home run in the seventh off Rich Gossage made it 5–3 Tigers, but the Padres cut the lead back to one on Kurt Bevacqua&#x27;s home run off closer Willie Hernández. Kirk Gibson came to the plate in the bottom of the eighth for the Tigers with runners on second and third and one out. Gibson had homered earlier in the game, and Padres manager Dick Williams strolled to the mound to talk to Goose Gossage, seemingly with the purpose of ordering him to walk Gibson intentionally. Just before the at-bat, Gibson made a US$10 bet (flashing ten fingers) with his manager Sparky Anderson that Gossage (who had dominated Gibson in the past) would pitch to him. Gossage talked Williams into letting him pitch to Gibson, and Gibson responded with a three-run blast into the upper deck to clinch the Series for the Tigers. Gibson wound up driving in five runs and scoring three, including the run that gave Detroit the lead for good when he raced home on a pop-up sacrifice fly by little-used reserve Rusty Kuntz.

In the ninth, Willie Hernández closed out the series for the Tigers by getting Tony Gwynn to fly to Larry Herndon in left field for the final out.

While Alan Trammell won the &quot;Sport Magazine&quot; variation of the World Series Most Valuable Player Award (the official one), Jack Morris won the Babe Ruth Award from the New York City chapter of the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America. Kirk Gibson had a stellar World Series as well, batting .333 with 6 hits and 7 RBIs, including two homeruns and scored 4 runs.

After being fired by the Cincinnati Reds in 1978, Sparky Anderson was hired by the Tigers in June 1979. Anderson, who had led the Reds to Series victories in and , became the first manager to win a World Championship in both the American and National Leagues.

<text>Lithops is a genus of succulent plants in the ice plant family, Aizoaceae. Members of the genus are native to southern Africa. They avoid being eaten by herbivores with their camouflage as small stones, and are often known as pebble plants or living stones.

&quot;Lithops&quot; is both the genus name and the common name, and is singular as well as plural. The name is derived from the Ancient Greek words () &#x27;stone&#x27; and () &#x27;face&#x27;, referring to the stone-like appearance of the plants.

== Description ==

Individual &quot;Lithops&quot; consist of one or more pairs of bulbous, almost fused leaves opposite each other and hardly any stem. The slit between the leaves contains the meristem and produces flowers and new leaves. The leaves of &quot;Lithops&quot; are mostly buried below the surface of the soil, with a partially or completely translucent top surface known as a leaf window which allows light to enter the interior of the leaves for photosynthesis.

During winter a new leaf pair, or occasionally more than one, grows inside the existing fused leaf pair. In spring the old leaf pair parts to reveal the new leaves and the old leaves will then dry up. &quot;Lithops&quot; leaves may shrink and disappear below ground level during drought. Yellow or white flowers emerge from the fissure between the leaves after the new leaf pair fully matures, one per leaf pair. This is usually in autumn, but can be before the summer solstice in &quot;L. pseudotruncatella&quot; and after the winter solstice in &quot;L. optica&quot;. The flowers are often sweetly scented.

The most startling adaptation of &quot;Lithops&quot; is the colouring of the leaves. The leaves are fenestrated, and the epidermal windows are patterned in various shades of cream, grey, and brown, with darker windowed areas, dots, and red lines, according to species and local conditions. The markings function as remarkable camouflage for the plant in its typically stony environment. As is typical of a window plant, the green tissue lines the inside of the leaves and is covered with translucent tissue beneath the epidermal windows.

&quot;Lithops&quot; are obligate outcrossers and require pollination from a separate plant. Like most mesembs, Lithops fruit is a dry capsule that opens when it becomes wet; some seeds may be ejected by falling raindrops, and the capsule re-closes when it dries out. Capsules may also sometimes detach and be distributed intact, or may disintegrate after several years.

== Distribution ==

&quot;Lithops&quot; occur naturally across wide areas of Namibia and South Africa, as well as small bordering areas in Botswana and possibly Angola, from sea level to high mountains. Nearly a thousand individual populations are documented, each covering just a small area of dry grassland, veld, or bare rocky ground. Different &quot;Lithops&quot; species are preferentially found in particular environments, usually restricted to a particular type of rock. &quot;Lithops&quot; have not naturalised outside this region.

Rainfall in &quot;Lithops&quot; habitats ranges from approximately 700 mm/year to near zero. Rainfall patterns range from exclusively summer rain to exclusively winter rain, with a few species relying almost entirely on dew formation for moisture. Temperatures are usually hot in summer and cool to cold in winter, but one species is found right at the coast with very moderate temperatures year round.

== Cultivation ==

&quot;Lithops&quot; are popular house plants and many specialist succulent growers maintain collections. Seeds and plants are widely available in shops and over the Internet. They are relatively easy to grow and care for if given sufficient sun and kept in well-draining soil.

Normal treatment in mild temperate climates is to keep them completely dry during winter, watering only when the old leaves have dried up and are replaced by a new leaf pair. Watering continues through autumn, when the plants flower, and then stops for winter. The best results are obtained in an environment with additional heat such as a greenhouse. In hotter climates, &quot;Lithops&quot; will have a summer dormancy when they should be kept mostly dry, and they may require some water in winter. In tropical climates, &quot;Lithops&quot; can be grown primarily in winter with a long summer dormancy. In all conditions, &quot;Lithops&quot; will be most active and need most water during autumn and most species will flower at approximately the same time.

&quot;Lithops&quot; thrive best in a coarse, well-drained substrate. Any soil that retains too much water will cause the plants to burst their skins as they over-expand. Plants grown in strong light will develop hard strongly coloured skins which are resistant to damage and rot, although persistent overwatering will still be fatal. Excessive heat will kill potted plants as they cannot cool themselves by transpiration and rely on staying buried in cool soil below the surface. Commercial growers mix a mild fungicide or weak strength horticultural sulfur into the plant&#x27;s water to prevent rotting. Lithops are sensitive to watering during hot weather, which can cause the plants to rot; in habitat the plants are often dormant when the temperatures are high, doing most of their growing during the cool months of the year. Low light levels will make the plants highly susceptible to rotting and fungal infection.

In the United Kingdom the following species have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:

*&quot;Lithops karasmontana&quot; 
*&quot;Lithops olivacea&quot; 
*&quot;Lithops pseudotruncatella&quot;
*&quot;Lithops salicola&quot; 
*&quot;Lithops schwantesii&quot;
==Cultivars==
Mr Keith Green was appointed International Cultivar Registration Authority for &quot;Lithops&quot; in 2013, and recognises over 100 registered cultivars.

Since &quot;Lithops&quot; are mostly propagated by seed, cultivars require to be stabilised as seed strains. Most cultivars are either abnormally green or abnormally red plants, lacking most of the normal leaf pigments. Some were initially found as isolated unusual plants in habitat, but increasingly have arisen from cultivation, sometimes by deliberately selecting mildly-coloured plants to achieve intense colours for a cultivar. The term &quot;aberrant colour form&quot; (acf.) has been used for these unusually-coloured &quot;Lithops&quot;.

There are also so-called &quot;pattern cultivars&quot; of &quot;Lithops&quot;, seed strains which have been selectively-bred or stabilised from isolated unusual plants to have intensified or unusual leaf patterns, and sometimes unusual flowers. In some cases, these are hybrids.

===Propagation===

Propagation of &quot;Lithops&quot; is by seed or cuttings. Cuttings can only be used to produce new plants after a plant has naturally divided to form multiple heads, so most propagation is by seed. &quot;Lithops&quot; can readily be pollinated by hand if two separate clones of a species flower at the same time, and seed will be ripe about 9 months later. Seed is easy to germinate, but the seedlings are small and vulnerable for the first year or two, and will not flower until at least two or three years old.

== Conservation status ==
At least half of the species listed in the Red List of South African Plants are classified as endangered or threatened for various reasons, including poaching for the succulent horticultural trade, habitat degradation, and decreased or restricted range due to urban and agriculture expansion.
== History ==

The first scientific description of &quot;Lithops&quot; was made by botanist and artist William John Burchell, explorer of South Africa, although he called it &quot;Mesembryanthemum turbiniforme&quot;. In 1811, Burchell discovered a specimen when picking up a &quot;curiously shaped pebble&quot; from the ground. Unfortunately the documented physical description was not detailed enough to be sure which &quot;Lithops&quot; he had discovered and the name &quot;Lithops turbiniformis&quot; is no longer used, although for many years it was applied to what is now known as &quot;Lithops hookeri&quot;.

Several more &quot;Lithops&quot; were published as &quot;Mesembryanthemum&quot; species until in 1922 N E Brown started to split up the overly large genus on the basis of the capsules. The genus &quot;Lithops&quot; was created and dozens more species were published in the following decades. Brown, Gustav Schwantes, Kurt Dinter, Gert Nel, and Louisa Bolus continued to document &quot;Lithops&quot; from across southern Africa, but there was little consensus on the relationships between them, or even which populations should be grouped as species. As recently as the 1950s, the genus remained rather unknown in cultivation and was not well understood taxonomically.

In the 1950s, Desmond and Naureen Cole began to study &quot;Lithops&quot;. Together, the couple visited nearly all natural habitats of the different lithops populations and collected samples from approximately 400. They document and identify them, assigning a number, which is now known as the Cole number still used today all around the world. They studied and revised the genus, in 1988 publishing a definitive book &quot;(Lithops: Flowering Stones&quot;) describing the species, subspecies, and varieties which have been accepted ever since.

Because their camouflage is so effective, new species continue to be discovered. Recent discoveries include &quot;L. coleorum&quot; in 1994, &quot;L. hermetica&quot; in 2000, and &quot;L. amicorum&quot; in 2006.
== Taxonomy ==

Many of the species listed have named subspecies or varieties and some have many regional forms identified by old names or habitat locations. Identification of species is primarily by flower colour and leaf patterns. The species list here follows Cole &amp; Cole (2006).

Although the species, subspecies, and varieties published by Cole &amp; Cole largely remain accepted and in widespread use, some variations have been published by other authors. Some published changes since 2006 include:
* reducing &quot;L. amicorum&quot; to a subspecies of &quot;L. karasmontana&quot;; combining &quot;L. karasmontana&quot; ssp. &quot;bella&quot; and ssp. &quot;eberlanzii&quot; into one subspecies; and combining &quot;L. herrei&quot; with &quot;L. optica&quot;.
* raising &quot;L. dendritica&quot; and &quot;L. eberlanzii&quot; to species level and dropping all the separate varieties of &quot;L. karasmontana&quot;.
* raising &quot;L. bella&quot;, &quot;L. burchellii&quot;, &quot;L. euniceae&quot;, and &quot;L. glaudinae&quot; to species level; combining &quot;L. dorotheae&quot; and &quot;L schwantesii&quot; var. &quot;marthae&quot; under &quot;L. dinteri&quot;; combining &quot;L. francisci&quot;, &quot;L. gesinae&quot;, and &quot;L. hermetica&quot;; combining &quot;L. geyeri&quot; under &quot;L. herrei&quot;; dropping separate subspecies of &quot;L. julii&quot; and &quot;L. gracilidelineata&quot;; splitting ssp. &quot;archerae&quot;, &quot;dendritica&quot; and &quot;groendrayensis&quot; from &quot;L. pseudotruncatella&quot; as &quot;L. dendritica&quot;; and dropping separate varieties under &quot;L. villetii&quot;.

One study of non-coding chloroplast DNA (trnS-trnG intergenic spacer), nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (nrITS) sequences and AFLP data found that Lithops was not monophyletic since &quot;Dinteranthus&quot;, &quot;Schwantesia&quot;, and &quot;Lapidaria&quot; were involved. It identified 9 clades which did not closely frame the accepted 37 species.

<doc id="1101661" wikidata="Q836571" url="?curid=1101661" title="Fantasia (musical form)">
<text>A fantasia (; also English: &quot;fantasy&quot;, &quot;fancy&quot;, &quot;fantazy&quot;, &quot;phantasy&quot;, , &quot;Phantasie&quot;, ) is a musical composition with roots in improvisation. The fantasia, like the impromptu, seldom follows the textbook rules of any strict musical form.

== History ==
The term was first applied to music during the 16th century, at first to refer to the imaginative musical &quot;idea&quot; rather than to a particular compositional genre. Its earliest use as a title was in German keyboard manuscripts from before 1520, and by 1536 is found in printed tablatures from Spain, Italy, Germany, and France. From the outset, the fantasia had the sense of &quot;the play of imaginative invention&quot;, particularly in lute or vihuela composers such as Francesco Canova da Milano and Luis de Milán. Its form and style consequently ranges from the freely improvisatory to the strictly contrapuntal, and also encompasses more or less standard sectional forms. One of the most important composers in the development of the fantasia was Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck. His greatest work in this style is the &quot;fantasia cromatica&quot; (a specific form called &quot;chromatic fantasia&quot;), which in many ways forms a link between the Renaissance and the Baroque.

== Renaissance and Baroque ==

According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Music&quot;, in the 16th century the instrumental fantasia was a strict imitation of the vocal motet. Polyphonic solo fantasias were widely composed for the Lute &amp; early keyboards. Composers such as William Byrd &amp; Orlando Gibbons wrote many surviving keyboard fantasias, while also expanding the genre with outstanding examples for recorders &amp; viols. In addition to Byrd &amp; Gibbons, composers John Coprario, Alfonso Ferrabosco, Thomas Lupo, John Ward, and William White continued to expand the genre for viol consort while examples by William Lawes, John Jenkins, William Cranford, Matthew Locke, and Henry Purcell are regarded as highly exceptional from the late 17th-century.

The form expanded in scope during the Baroque period with works ranging from J. S. Bach&#x27;s &quot;Chromatic Fantasia and Fugue&quot;, BWV 903, for harpsichord; Great Fantasia and Fugue in G minor, BWV 542, for organ; and Fantasia and Fugue in C minor, BWV 537, for organ are examples. Georg Philipp Telemann published Twelve Fantasias for Solo Flute in 1733, and Twelve Fantasias for Solo Violin and Twelve Fantasias for Viola da Gamba solo in 1735.

== Classical and Romantic ==
Examples from the Classical period are Mozart&#x27;s Fantasia in D minor, K. 397 for fortepiano and his Fantasia in C minor, K. 475. Ludwig van Beethoven&#x27;s 13th and 14th (the famous &quot;Moonlight&quot;) Piano Sonatas are both headed with &quot;Sonata quasi una fantasia&quot;. Franz Schubert composed the Fantasie in C major nicknamed the &quot;Wanderer Fantasy&quot; for solo piano and the Fantasia in F minor for piano four hands. Three works by Chopin belong in the genre: The Fantaisie in F minor, Op. 49, the Polonaise-Fantaisie in A major, Op. 61, and the &quot;Fantaisie-Impromptu&quot; in C minor, Op. posth. 66. The fantasia occupies a central place in Schumann&#x27;s oeuvre: The great Fantasie in C, Op. 17, and the fantasy pieces Op. 12, 73 and 111. Later examples of fantasias include Anton Bruckner&#x27;s Fantasia in G major WAB 118 and the Four Fantasias WAB 215, Busoni&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia contrappuntistica&quot;, Vaughan Williams&#x27; &quot;Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis&quot; and &quot;Fantasia on Greensleves&quot;, and Corigliano&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia on an ostinato&quot;.

== 20th century ==
Walter Willson Cobbett, in the opening decades of the 20th century, attempted to revive the fantasia style via a competition, to which works like the Phantasie trios and quartets by William Hurlstone, Armstrong Gibbs, John Ireland, Herbert Howells and Frank Bridge owe their existence, as does Benjamin Britten&#x27;s Phantasy in F minor for string quintet written in 1932, the year in which he also composed a Phantasy Quartet for oboe and strings.

According to the musicologist Donald Francis Tovey, &quot;the term &#x27;fantasia&#x27; would adequately cover all post-classical forms of concerto&quot;.

<text>Niemisel () is a village with a population of 100 people in the north of Sweden, within Luleå Municipality. It is situated along the Råne river 60 km (35 mi) north of Luleå and 100 km (60 mi) south of the Arctic Circle.

== History ==
The remains of cooking pits and settlements to the north of Niemisel show that the village and its immediate area have been inhabited for over 2,000 years, during a period when the Bothnian Bay had a much higher water level than at present. The first farms in the village were built in the 16th century, and the population of the town grew steadily until the 1950s. Niemisel was connected to the Swedish railway system in 1905, with its station being inaugurated by King Gustaf V of Sweden.

== Transport ==
The Länsväg (county road) 356 passes near Niemisel. Niemisel railway system was inaugurated in 1905, and is used exclusively for freight. The railway station lies on the Boden-Haparanda line, and carries freight to both Tornio and Karlstad. The track is electrified and uses automatic block signalling.

<text>Ten New Songs is Leonard Cohen&#x27;s tenth studio album, released in 2001. His first album in 9 years, &quot;Ten New Songs&quot; was co-written and produced by Sharon Robinson in Cohen&#x27;s and Robinson&#x27;s home studios in Los Angeles. The album peaked at No. 143 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, No. 4 in Canada (where it went platinum), No. 1 in Poland (where it went platinum) and No. 1 in Norway.

==Background==
After successfully touring behind the award-winning album &quot;The Future&quot;, Cohen was awarded a Governor General&#x27;s Performance Arts Award for his contribution to Canadian music in 1993 and was the subject of an hour-long CBC Radio retrospective called &quot;The Gospel According to Leonard Cohen&quot;. Cohen also published a collection of poems and songs called &quot;Stranger Music&quot; and released his second live album &quot;Cohen Live&quot; in 1994.

That same year, Cohen unexpectedly retreated to the Mt. Baldy Zen Center near Los Angeles to spend time with his Zen Master Joshu Sasaki, or Roshi, a sabbatical that would last five years. In 2001 the singer explained to &quot;Mojo&quot;″s Sylvie Simmons, &quot;Well, I was always going off the deep end, so it was no radical departure. When I finished my tour in &#x27;93 I was approaching the age of 60 and my old friend and teacher Roshi was approaching the age of 90, and I thought it would be the right moment to spend some more time with him...I wasn&#x27;t looking for a new religion or another list of dogma.&quot;

Cohen has stated in numerous interviews that throughout the success of the &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; and &quot;The Future&quot; tours, he remained desperately unhappy; in the book &quot;Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life&quot;, biographer Anthony Reynolds quotes the singer: &quot;I&#x27;d been drinking three bottles of wine a night on the tour and one of the things I was looking for was a rest...I didn&#x27;t know what else to do.&quot;

Interest in Cohen only grew, however, with a tribute album called &quot;Tower of Song&quot; being released in 1995. According to Ira Nadel&#x27;s 1996 Cohen memoir &quot;Various Positions: A Life of Leonard Cohen&quot;, Cohen flirted with the idea of recording an album of 14 short songs during this period, but eventually scrapped the project. (One song, &quot;Never Any Good,&quot; would turn up on the 1997 release &quot;More Best of Leonard Cohen&quot;.) In June 1999, Cohen returned to his L.A. duplex to live with his daughter and began collaborating with Sharon Robinson (co-writer of &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; and &quot;Waiting for the Miracle&quot;) on what would become &quot;Ten New Songs&quot;.

==Recording and composition==
Robinson produced, co-arranged, co-wrote and sang on &quot;Ten New Songs&quot;, making it a true collaboration. Cohen gave Robinson some lyrics he had written and she built the music around them. Cohen was so impressed with Robinson&#x27;s demos that she ended up singing all the songs with him, including several leads. &quot;At his insistence&quot;, Robinson clarified to &quot;Mojo&quot;″s Sylvie Simmons. &quot;It&#x27;s ironic, isn&#x27;t it, that the man who&#x27;s got this voice that women swoon over just wants to hide it away?&quot; The album was recorded by Robinson and Cohen in near isolation, with Leanne Ungar engineering and Bob Metzger adding guitar to the LP&#x27;s first single, &quot;In My Secret Life&quot;. In 2010, Robinson spoke about the recording with Cohen biographer Anthony Reynolds:
:The way the album came about is linked to the actual sound of it. The album had a unique path and it wasn&#x27;t done in the way an album is normally done. It was also recorded pretty much in the order it plays in...The recording was some kind of extension of his time at Mount Baldy. He was still very reclusive during this time...I would initially sing and play everything, at the time not knowing if we were bringing in other musicians or singers. Of course as it turned out, we didn&#x27;t so my voice stayed because Leonard liked what he was hearing.

Robinson also divulged to Reynolds that most of the album was recorded in her three-car garage that was adjoined to her house (which she had converted to a studio) and that she would take the raw audio on a portable hard drive to Cohen&#x27;s converted studio above his garage.

The album was Cohen&#x27;s first to be recorded completely digitally. &quot;There&#x27;s a sense of relaxation in the tunes that comes through&quot;, Cohen told Nick Patton Walsh of &quot;The Observer&quot; in 2001. &quot;There&#x27;s a kind of pulse, an invitation to get into it - a groove.&quot;

Several of the tracks on &quot;Ten New Songs&quot; existed in some form or another long before they appeared on the album; Cohen first revealed he was working on a new song called &quot;My Secret Life&quot; in 1988, and, in 1995, Melinda Newman of &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that two tracks, &quot;My Secret Life&quot; and &quot;A Thousand Kisses Deep&quot;, were &quot;close to completion... I’d like to have a very intimate kind of record, of a very different nature than actual songs.&quot;

&quot;In My Secret Life&quot;, a song that wound up being an ode to unrequited love, became the album&#x27;s first single with an accompanying music video that was filmed in Montreal at Habitat 67. Other songs, such as &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; (based on &quot;The God Abandons Antony&quot;, also translated as &quot;The God Forsakes Antony&quot;, a poem by Constantine P. Cavafy, published in 1911) and &quot;You Have Loved Enough&quot;, imply departures of some sort or another.

&quot;Ten New Songs&quot; was remastered and reissued on vinyl by the Netherlands label Music On Vinyl in 2009.

==Reception==
In the October 2001 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of the album, Steven Chean stated, &quot;&quot;Ten New Songs&quot; manages to sustain loss&#x27;s fragile beauty like never before and might just be the Cohen&#x27;s most exquisite ode yet to the midnight hour.&quot; &quot;Uncut&quot; deemed it &quot;worth the wait.&quot; &quot;Playboy&quot; opined: &quot;Although the tones of these odes and meditations is mournful, at the age of 67 Cohen&#x27;s pessimism about the human condition is tempered with reconciliation. He&#x27;ll never be cheerful, but a Zen-like serenity pervades every song.&quot;

==Cover recordings==
Eric Burdon, Katie Melua, Till Brönner and Edo Zanki have recorded cover version&#x27;s of &quot;In My Secret Life&quot;. Luciana Souza recorded a version of &quot;Here It Is&quot; on her album &quot;The New Bossa Nova&quot;. Jonathan Richman recorded a version of &quot;Here It Is&quot; for his 2008 album &quot;Because Her Beauty Is Raw &amp; Wild&quot;.

&quot;A Thousand Kisses Deep&quot; was used in the movie &quot;The Good Thief&quot;, the 2010 French movie &quot;Le bruit des glaçons&quot;, and in Season 3 of the TV Series &quot;Veronica Mars&quot;. It was also covered by Chris Botti in his album of the same name in 2003, and by Till Brönner and Dieter Ilg on their album &quot;Nightfall&quot; in 2018.

&quot;That Don&#x27;t Make It Junk&quot; was covered live by Widespread Panic three times in 2011. &quot;Alexandra Leaving&quot; was covered by Canadian singer Patricia O&#x27;Callaghan on her fifth solo album, &quot;Matador: The Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot;, in late 2011. It has also been covered by Anne Hills and Allan Olsen. &quot;The Land of Plenty&quot; was used in the 2004 movie &quot;Land of Plenty&quot; directed by Wim Wenders. German punk singer Nina Hagen covered &quot;By the Rivers Dark&quot; with German lyrics by Ton Steine Scherben-member Misha B. Schoeneberg as &quot;Am dunklen Fluss&quot; for the 2014 cover collection &quot;Poem - Leonard Cohen in deutscher Sprache&quot;. Molly Johnson covered &quot;Boogie Street&quot; on her 2018 album &quot;Meaning to Tell Ya&quot;.

<doc id="1101671" wikidata="Q413798" url="?curid=1101671" title="Phosphorine">
<text>Phosphorine (IUPAC name: phosphinine) is a heavier element analog of pyridine, containing a phosphorus atom instead of an aza- moiety. It is also called phosphabenzene and belongs to the phosphaalkene class. It is a colorless liquid that is mainly of interest in research.

Phosphorine is an air-sensitive oil but is otherwise stable when handled using air-free techniques (however, substituted derivatives can often be handled under air without risk of decomposition). In contrast, silabenzene, a related heavy-element analogue of benzene, is not only air- and moisture-sensitive but also thermally unstable without extensive steric protection.

==History==
The first phosphorine to be isolated is 2,4,6-triphenylphosphorine. It was synthesized by Gottfried Märkl in 1966 by condensation of the corresponding pyrylium salt and phosphine or its equivalent ( P(CH2OH)3 and P(SiMe3)3).

The (unsubstituted) parent phosphorine was reported by Arthur J. Ashe III in 1971. Ring-opening approaches have been developed from phospholes.

==Structure, bonding, and properties==
Structural studies by electron diffraction reveal that phosphorine is a planar aromatic compound with 88% of aromaticity of that of benzene. Potentially relevant to its high aromaticity are the well matched electronegativities of phosphorus (2.1) and carbon (2.5). The P–C bond length is 173 pm and the C–C bond lengths center around 140 pm and show little variation.
Although phosphorine and pyridine are structurally similar, phosphorines are far less basic. The p&quot;K&quot;a of C5H5PH+ and C5H5NH+ are respectively −16.1 and +5.2. The P-oxides are extremely unstable, rapidly adding nucleophiles to a species tetracoordinate at phosphorus. Strongly backbonding Lewis acids (e.g. tungsten pentacarbonyl) can stabilize a dative bond from phosphorus. 

Both electrophiles and strong, hard nucleophiles preferentially attack at phosphorus, but the ring aromaticity is sufficiently weak that the result is an addition reaction, and not aromatic substitution. Thus for example methyllithium adds to phosphorus in phosphorine whereas it adds to the 2-position of pyridine. Halophosphorines do undergo noble-metal- or zirconocene-catalyzed substitution, and λ5-phosphorines exhibit a much more traditional substitution chemistry. 

Unlike arsabenzene, phosphorine rarely participates in Diels-Alder-type cycloadditions; when it does, the coupling partner must be an extremely electron-poor alkyne. Phosphorine &quot;complexes&quot; are tolerable Diels-Alder reactants. 

===Coordination chemistry===
Coordination complexes bearing phosphorine as a ligand are known. Phosphorines can bind to metals through phosphorus center. Complexes of the diphospha analogue of 2,2′-bipyridine are known. Phosphorines also form pi-complexes, illustrated by V(&quot;η&quot;6-C5H5P)2.

<doc id="1101672" wikidata="Q1450851" url="?curid=1101672" title="Holden Kingswood">
<text>The Holden Kingswood is a full-size car that was developed and manufactured in Australia by Holden, from the beginning of the HK series in 1968 through to the conclusion of the WB series in 1985. Prior to 1968, the full-size Holden range of family cars comprised the Holden Standard, the Holden Special, and Holden Premier models. Initially, the HK range of models included the basic Holden Belmont (replacing the Standard), the Kingswood (replacing the Special), and the luxury-oriented Holden Premier, all of which were manufactured in a choice of sedan and station wagon bodies. Commercial variants were offered in three types: coupé utility, panel van, and later from 1971, a heavy-duty Holden One Tonner cab chassis. The utility (ute) version was originally marketed in both Belmont and Kingswood configurations. However, after the Belmont name was deleted from commercials at the end of HQ in late 1974, the base model commercials were sold only with the &quot;Holden&quot; badge (the Belmont name continued on sedan and wagon variants until the end of the HX series).

A two-door Holden Monaro coupé and extended-length luxury Holden Brougham were also introduced in mid 1968. For HK, HT, HG and HQ the Holden Monaro carried the ID plate luxury level coding for a Kingswood but never wore Kingswood badges as a production car. HQ-HJ Monaro LS and HQ Monaro LS V8 shared luxury level coding with their respective Premier but also never wore Premier badges. HK-HJ Monaro GTS coupe, HJ Monaro GTS sedan, HT-HQ Monaro GTS V8 coupe and Monaro GTS327/350 coupe (HK-HQ) carried unique luxury level coding. 

HQ Monaro GTS sedan and HQ Monaro GTS350 sedan shared Kingswood luxury level coding with later examples actually displaying the GTS coupe&#x27;s Q code on the VIN plate but still retaining the HQ V8 Kingswood&#x27;s 80469 model coding on the body plate. The Brougham was replaced in 1971 by the Statesman brand, based upon the station wagon chassis of the then new HQ series. For a complete listing of the HK–WB series Holden cars, see: list of Holden vehicles by series.

A new Kingswood model was introduced at the start of the HX Holden series in mid 1976, the Kingswood panel van.

Outside of Australia, the Holden range (including Kingswoods in various body styles) and its derivatives have been sold in New Zealand, parts of Asia, and parts of the South Pacific branded as Holden or Chevrolet. 

Following the late-1960s import cessation of the Canadian-sourced Chevrolet Impala and Chevelle in South Africa, the Holden Kingswood / Premier and Holden Brougham models were badge engineered as Chevrolet Kommando and Chevrolet Constantia, respectively. Holden-based style-side utilities in South Africa were known as the Chevrolet El Camino. Between 1974 and 1978, the one-tonne cab-chassis utility was sold as the Chevrolet El Toro.

The Kingswood passenger car and Kingswood panel van ceased production with the demise of the HZ series in 1980, the passenger range succeeded by the smaller Commodore released two years earlier. However, the Kingswood name survived via the utility that comprised part of the WB series range manufactured between 1980 and 1985, sold alongside the WB Statesman and the WB Holden utility, panel van and cab-chassis.

== First generation (1968–1971) ==
=== HK ===
The Kingswood sedan and wagon were released as part of the new HK series of Holdens in January 1968 (commercials: March 1968). This was an all-new body design, larger and heavier than the previous HR series. The HK series carried over the same local six-cylinder engines, but introduced the first V8 into the Holden range, the fully imported Chevrolet small-block engine.

The Monaro and the Brougham were introduced mid-year of 1968, thereby broadening GM&#x27;s range of locally built full-size cars in Australia.

=== HT ===

The HT series launched in May 1969 and with it the introduction of a new locally manufactured Holden and V8 engines. The 253 was available on all HT models except Brougham, and the 308 was available only in Brougham. The Chevrolet V8 engine had remained an option for all HT series models except Brougham until stocks were depleted and it was replaced with the 308. The advertising campaign for this model was &#x27;Never Late, in a Three-Oh-Eight&#x27;.

The range of three six-cylinder engines carried over to the HT series, however the transmission options for the V8 engines were many and varied. Initially, the 253 V8 only came with either three-speed column- or four-speed floor-mounted manual transmissions. The 307 V8 was only available with two-speed &quot;Powerglide&quot; automatic. This arrangement continued until the 307 stocks were exhausted, following which the 253 and 308 locally built V8 engines could then be ordered with any manual or automatic transmission across the range, excepting the Holden Brougham which was always specified as a 308 automatic. A new locally manufactured three-speed automatic transmission, the &quot;Tri-Matic&quot;, was introduced late in the life of the HT range, except on HT Brougham which retained the two-speed automatic &quot;Powerglide&quot; transmission.

=== HG ===
The HG series of July 1970 was a minor refinement of the existing formula, adopted as the marketing platform for the new three-speed automatic transmission option called &quot;Tri-Matic&quot;. The first of these locally made transmissions actually found their way into the last of the HT series cars. These transmissions were later criticised for unreliability and became colloquially known by dispondants, as the &quot;Traumatic&quot;. Only the HG Monaro GTS350 retained the &quot;Powerglide&quot; transmission if an automatic preference was optioned.
HG commercial variants continued to be built and sold alongside the HQ series passenger vehicles until very late in 1971 when the HQ commercials were released. These HG commercials were upgraded to the newer specification HQ 173ci and 202ci 6cyl engines but retained the HG specification transmissions (cable kickdown 6cyl and V8 Trimatics and V8 M21 Saginaw) and V8 engines which are believed to have been stockpiled in sufficient quantity to cover expected requirements. These HG commercials can easily be identified by the A prefix on the chassis number appearing on the firewall and for vehicles built for sale inside Australia on the Safety Compliance Plate.

== Second generation (1971–1985) ==
=== HQ ===
The HQ series of 1971 was a completely new design, introducing larger capacity 173-cubic-inch (2.85 L) and 202-cubic-inch (3.3 L) six-cylinder engines, with the continued availability of 253-cubic-inch (4.2 L), 308-cubic-inch (5.0 L) Holden 
and 350-cubic-inch (5.7 L) Chevrolet V8 engines. HQ was the most radically engineered Holden since the introduction of the original 48-215 model of 23 years prior. It featured a perimeter frame and semi-monocoque (unibody) construction, and was the first full-size Holden to have coil spring rear suspension. As a cost-saving measure, HQ was only engineered for right-hand drive, hence it was not feasible to sell the car in left-hand drive markets. Thus Holden exports declined from 41,181 in 1973 to just 7,440 in 1975. Over the following years this led to a large decline in export vehicle revenue needed to fund the HQ-HZ series replacement. Despite this, HQ became Holden&#x27;s most popular car, selling 485,650 units, a total yet to be surpassed in a Holden. It was however, sold over a longer timeframe than previous models.

At the time, Holden&#x27;s then Chief Engineer, an American named George Roberts, insisted that the HQ Holdens should &quot;ride like a Cadillac&quot; and that the front suspension be engineered to make the car prone to understeer for &quot;safety reasons&quot;. Advertising of the car promoted its &quot;jet-smooth ride&quot; over rough roads. Notwithstanding persistent criticism from many motoring journalists, this policy persisted with the subsequent HJ and HX facelift models. It was arguable whether Australian buyers favoured this engineering philosophy and it was not until the 1977 HZ facelift that radical changes were made to the suspension to improve handling.

In Mid 1972, Holden released a limited edition version of the HQ Belmont sedan, named &#x27;SS&#x27; Adopted from Chevrolet Super Sport Models in the United States and other markets, Option code &#x27;XV2&#x27; Included the choice of three very 70&#x27;s Colours: Infra Red (Dark Orange), Lettuce Alone (Light Green) or Ultraviolet (Purplish - Grey Metallic), Vinyl Stripe and &#x27;SS&#x27; Decal kit supplied by 3M Australia, a choice between 253 (4.2L) or 308 (5.0L) Holden V8 engine mated to a 4 Speed Manual Gearbox backed by a 10-Bolt Salisbury Differential with a 3.36:1 Ratio (and painted.. unusually, White, Along with the driveshaft), along with Pontiac-style Rallye weels. On the inside: Standard Black Belmont Door trims, Optional armrests, However, unusual to the Belmont, A full Sport Gauge Cluster, Steering Wheel, Carpet, Floor Shift, Center Console and Bucket Seats in Black Vinyl with Houndstooth or Flax inserts, The SS was initially limited to 1800 units, but extended by 1300 due to unprecedented sales demand.

In late 1972, Holden released a special edition version of the HQ Kingswood sedan and wagon, named Kingswood Vacationer. This value package of options proved popular and made return appearances on various Holden models during the next twenty years or so. Holden, in 1974 introduced the Sandman, a version of the utility or panel van designed to incorporate many of the features of the Monaro, such as sports instrumentation, sports steering wheel and bucket seats, and &quot;rally&quot; road wheels with a choice of two six-cylinder and two V8 engines. Other available options included automatic transmission, power steering, and air-conditioning. Sandmans were visually identified by stick-on vinyl decals on the exterior. It gained notoriety during the latter half of the 1970s as a mobile venue for sexual intercourse. Vans earned nicknames as &quot;shaggin&#x27; wagons&quot; and &quot;sinbins&quot;.

In 1971 CKD HQ production started in Thailand. HQ&#x27;s were also CKD manufactured in Indonesia and the Philippines for many years. There was also a program for Mazda in Japan to produce the HQ from CKD kits, which is believed not to have gone beyond the pilot stage.

=== HJ ===


Released in 1974, the HJ series received some major frontal appearance styling changes, taking away some of the &quot;softness&quot; of the HQ cars. HJ saw the Belmont name disappear off utilities and panel vans to be replaced with an &quot;unbadged&quot; specification. HJ also saw the demise of separate models for V8 powered variants, for example in HQ a V8 Kingswood sedan had model code 0469 and its six-cylinder version was 0369. In HJ all Kingswoods were a single model—WN69—regardless of engine. Engine displacement was now expressed in metric terms, and the six-cylinder engine became the standard power unit for all Kingswood variants and higher luxury levels. The six remained the standard engine for the entry-level Belmont and &quot;unbadged&quot; commercials. As with the engine, the Belmont also saw the omission of front disc brakes, now a standard fitment on all Kingswood models.

A couple of special-build variants emerged later in production, initially with the Kingswood Deluxe sedan in July 1975 and later the Kingswood Vacationer II sedan and wagon in November 1975. Added features for these cars included automatic transmission, radial tyres, floor carpeting, radio, and a range of two-tone body colours.

Some HJ series Premier based vehicles were assembled by Mazda in Japan, which fitted with the company&#x27;s rotary engine. The car, manufactured between 1975 and 1977 sold as the Mazda Roadpacer was quite heavy and the rotary engine of the time was severely underpowered. To compensate for the lack of performance, Mazda endowed the car with a myriad of electrical gadgets, thus making the performance even worse.

=== HX ===


The HX series release of 1976 saw only minor updates to the exterior, notably the grille and badgework, although base specification utilities and panel vans retained the HJ grill (except Sandman which got HX Kingswood frontal treatment). When the HX was released, government emissions controls had been tightened and Holden needed to make significant changes to their engines. This resulted in a loss of performance across the range and the deletion of the 2.84-litre straight-six. In addition, a Kingswood panel van was introduced to the range of commercial vehicle offerings. The HX Sandman introduced a large &#x27;Sandman&#x27; logo on the tailgate and stripes down the sides. During the course of the HX series, front bucket seats were adopted as standard equipment for Kingswood-badged vehicles. As with the previous series, a couple of special-build HX Kingswood variants emerged later in production, initially with the Kingswood 50th Anniversary sedan in November 1976 and also a repeat appearance of the Kingswood Deluxe sedan.

=== HZ ===


The 1977 HZ series received minor updates to the exterior, and saw the introduction of what Holden termed &quot;Radial Tuned Suspension&quot; (RTS) on all models. RTS made significant changes to the suspension of the car, greatly improving the handling finesse, while at the same time not compromising ride quality. &quot;Modern Motor&quot; magazine described the HZ as &quot;a great handler spoiled by the car&quot; in a comparison against the BMW 528i, contrasted as &quot;a great car spoiled by the handling&quot;. To illustrate, photos were taken of the Holden cornering hard but smoothly, while the BMW spun out of control. However BMW forced the magazine to admit that it had instructed its test driver to throw the BMW into the corner at much higher speed and in a deliberately unstable attitude. In this series, the lower-end Belmont was deleted and the Kingswood became the base model for sedans and wagons, with a new model the slightly more upmarket Kingswood SL introduced. Commercial vehicles—the ute, panel van and cab chassis—were not affected by the rationalisation, with the practice of &quot;unbadged&quot; commercial vehicles continuing. During the course of the HZ series, equipment levels were upgraded in 1978 effectively to match improvements in the opposition Ford Falcon range, but the life of the Kingswood looked set to end following Holden&#x27;s release of the VB Commodore range of sedans and wagons in November 1978. After 1980, Kingswood passenger cars were cancelled—replaced by the downsized Commodore.

The final HZ Sandman, featured a choice of V8 engines only, along with a four-headlight grille and under bumper front spoiler. According to a GMH Price List dated 25 January 1979, a basic HZ Holden panel van was priced at A$6,076, with the Sandman option package an additional A$1,700. The further optional components also included 5.0-litre V8 engine and a limited slip differential. If a buyer selected every Sandman extra, the price would be more than 150 percent of the cost of the basic HZ model. By the end of 1979, the Sandman had largely lost its place in the contemporary Australian youth culture—order figures were down and many of the vehicles were now being sold with the stripes and tailgate logos deleted. The Sandman ute was phased out of production prior to the van, the last of which was manufactured around October 1979.
=== WB ===

The last Holden to wear the Kingswood badge was one of the variants of the WB series utility released in 1980. Although the WA and WB projects at Holden were meant to have resulted in all-new full-size cars, the 1973 fuel crisis and cost-cutting meant the scope of changes became more limited each time. Eventually, the WB project was condensed into a major upgrade of the luxury Statesman models and a facelift of the HZ-series commercial models with new headlights, tail lights, grilles and the updated Holden &quot;Blue&quot; six-cylinder engine (4.2-litre V8 optional). The Kingswood was now available on utility only with the panel van joining the One Tonner, but the 5.0-litre V8 engine was no longer officially offered as an available performance option although some were built. There were no passenger car versions of the Kingswood, their place in the Holden range having been absorbed by the Commodore. Production of the entire WB-series finished in 1985 when Holden announced they were vacating local production of large luxury and commercial vehicles—due to economics—to concentrate on their medium car range, i.e. Camira and Commodore, and imported Isuzu commercial product.

== Third generation (proposed) ==

=== WA ===
After the development of the HQ series and the delays to the facelifted HJ which saw the revised HQ released in 1973, Holden intended to replace the second generations cars with a heavily revised WA series. Several design sketches in various forms have surfaced since the early-1990s, including a liftback body style. The 1973 fuel crisis along with a worsening financial situation, partly caused by the decision to build the HQ in right-hand drive only, thus limiting the previously highly profitable left-hand drive exports, meant that the project was eventually abandoned. GM instead utilised the then forthcoming 1977 Opel Rekord, which was significantly re-engineered and released as the Commodore in 1978 with Holden&#x27;s own powertrains.

== Exports ==
Early Holdens were manufactured in New Zealand at the General Motors New Zealand plant in Petone until 1967, and Kingswoods plus other Holden luxury levels were later assembled from complete knock down (CKD) kits at the new car plant at Trentham Upper Hutt further up the Hutt Valley from Wellington. Other Holden models like Monaro were imported completely built up (CBU) from Australia. From the 1960s Australian-made models were exported to Southeast Asia, and also to the Caribbean—the Kingswood was assembled in Trinidad and Tobago.

Some of these HQ-series models—assembled in Australia—were sold in New Zealand as the &quot;Chevrolet 350&quot; from 1971 to 1974. They differed little from the locally assembled V8 Statesman apart from the larger US made engine, a new grille with the Chevrolet logo, badges and hub caps, and effectively replaced the Canadian-sourced Chevrolet Impalas last sold in 1969.

=== South Africa ===
Until the late 1960s, the Special, Kingswood (from HK), Premier, and Monaro were sold in South Africa as Holdens, before the demise of Canadian-sourced Chevrolet Impala and Chevelle, which led to the introduction of the Chevrolet Kommando and Chevrolet Constantia, which were based on the HT, HG, and later HQ Kingswood and Premier respectively, using either Holden&#x27;s straight-six, V8, or later the Chevrolet sixes. There was a short period when HT and HG variants were sold with both Holden and Chevrolet badging, the Holden versions shared nose styling with Australian cars. Some surviving examples of both brands, especially Monaro coupes (HT badged Holden Monaro; HG Chevrolet SS) have been &#x27;reimported&#x27; to Australia by classic car enthusiasts. Some were exported to a few Southeast Asian markets (Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore) and marketed in their respective markets. The Constantia name was in reference to the grand Groot Constantia wine estate, with its world-famous gabled Cape-Dutch homestead featuring as the model&#x27;s emblem, while Kommando referred to the Boer Commando squads during the Anglo-Boer War. The South African version of the HQ was coded AQ, and was very similar to the Chevrolet 350 sold by Chevrolet/Vauxhall dealers in New Zealand.

In 1971, following the dropping of the Holden brand in South Africa, the Holden utility became known as the Chevrolet El Camino. Between 1974 and 1978, the one-tonne utility sold as the Chevrolet El Torro. Also in 1971, the Holden Monaro was made available locally as the Chevrolet SS. In late 1975, for the 1976 model year, updated models were introduced, again as a Kommando with the straight-six, Constantia with the 250 and V8, and the Caprice Classic, also with the 308. The inline-six was modified for better economy, but sales never climbed to their previous levels after the 1973 oil crisis. There was also a better equipped Kommando LS, with standard automatic transmission. The Constantia station wagon was a new model for 1976.

In 1979 the Holden-sourced models were replaced by Chevrolet-badged versions of the Opel Rekord, Commodore (similar to Holden&#x27;s own VB Commodore) and Senator. It would not be until 2001 that a Holden-sourced Chevrolet, the Lumina, was sold in South Africa.

==In popular culture==

A first generation 1971 Holden Kingswood sedan is featured in the New Zealand television series, &quot;The Brokenwood Mysteries&quot;, as the vehicle driven by the series star, Neill Rea, in his role as Detective Senior Sergeant Mike Shepherd. Apparently, the car is intended to represent the least glamorous transportation that D.S.S. Shepherd could possibly obtain. Passengers in Shepherd&#x27;s car are subjected to his favourite country songs (both well-known and obscure), always played on the car&#x27;s cassette player. The same array of country songs make up the soundtrack for the series.

The Australian sitcom &quot;Kingswood Country&quot; derived its name from the car the lead character, Ted Bullpit, drove (though it was replaced with a Holden Commodore later in its run).

<doc id="1101673" wikidata="Q1092816" url="?curid=1101673" title="Street football (association football)">
<text>Street football or street soccer is an informal variation on the game of association football, typically played in outdoor urban settings such as streets, playgrounds and car parks. The term encompasses a variety of different formats, which do not necessarily follow the requirements of a formal game of football, such as a large field, field markings, goal apparatus and corner flags, eleven players per team, or match officials (referee and assistant referees). Often street football is played as a pick-up game, without fixed timing and with players joining and leaving at any point. Many renowned footballers stated that they learned to play football on the street, including the likes of Diego Maradona, Johan Cruyff, Pelé, Giuseppe Meazza, Éamon Dunphy, Eusebio, Dejan Savićević, and Cristiano Ronaldo, among others.

== Background ==

Street football is more similar to beach football and futsal than to association football. Often the most basic of set-ups will involve just a ball with a wall or fence used as a goal, or items such as clothing being used for goalposts (hence the phrase &quot;jumpers for goalposts&quot;). The phrase was used by Ed Sheeran in his 2015 documentary &quot;Jumpers for Goalposts: Live at Wembley Stadium&quot; as a nod to playing the concerts at Wembley Stadium, the &quot;home of football.&quot;
In some cases, a standard ball is not available and street football depends on a ball made out of garbage, such as discarded plastic. Handwalla Bwana, describing street football in the Kakuma refugee camp said &quot;We used to make a garbage ball. We used to go through the garbage cans and make as much soccer ball as we could&quot; and attributed use of the garbage ball to being better with his feet. Johan Cruyff has said &quot;Footballers from the street are more important than trained coaches.&quot;

The ease of playing these informal games on the streets and open spaces make football the most popular sport in the world.

== Video games ==

In 2005, video game publisher Electronic Arts introduced &quot;FIFA Street&quot;, a franchise based on street football and freestyle football. &quot;FIFA Street&quot; series focuses on flair, style and trickery, reflecting the cultures of street football and freestyle football played in streets and backlots across the world.

In 2019, Electronic Arts added a Volta gameplay mode to FIFA 20. It shares similarities to the FIFA Street series and has a storyline of a street football player playing through the ranks, both making new friends and losing old ones along the way.

<doc id="1101674" wikidata="Q946629" url="?curid=1101674" title="I'm Your Man (Leonard Cohen album)">
<text>I&#x27;m Your Man is the eighth studio album by Canadian singer-songwriter Leonard Cohen, released on February 2, 1988, by Columbia Records. The album marked Cohen&#x27;s further move to a more modern sound, with many songs having a synthesizer-oriented production. It soon became the most successful studio album which Cohen had released in the US, and it reached number one in several European countries, transforming Cohen into a best-selling artist.

==Recording==
&quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; was recorded in Los Angeles, Montreal and Paris, and while it was the first studio album where Cohen took sole credit for the production, three contributing producers participated: Roscoe Beck, Jean-Michel Reusser and Michel Robidoux. The LP would give Cohen an updated, contemporary 80s sound, featuring songs composed primarily on keyboards and delivered in Cohen&#x27;s increasingly gravelly rasp. Cohen&#x27;s sound had started to evolve on his last studio album &quot;Various Positions&quot; (1984) but it is more fully realized on this album. Fellow Montrealer, Jeff Fisher, contributed his driving keyboard arrangements, playing all the music on &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot; and &quot;Jazz Police&quot;, and arranging and playing on &quot;There Ain&#x27;t No Cure for Love&quot;. Cohen&#x27;s collaboration with Fisher, who delivered a &quot;cinematic&quot; feel reminiscent of Ennio Morricone, &quot;convinced Cohen the album was possible&quot;. In his book &quot;Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life&quot; (2010), biographer Anthony Reynolds observes, &quot;...in almost every respect &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; marked not so much a progression but an evolutionary leap forward...Cohen&#x27;s new musical canvas was rich and wide, with its bold and bald use of sequencers, drum machines, synclavier and synths all mixed exotically with the lingering eastern European textures of the bouzouki, the oud, and the heart rending (old Russian school) violin.&quot; Cohen felt his singing had improved as well, telling Adrian Deevoy of &quot;Q&quot; magazine in 1991, &quot;Sometimes I can’t stand the sound of my voice. It went through periods. The first and second records it sounded right. Then I stopped being able to find the right voice for the songs. The songs were good and the intention was good but the voice wasn’t really up to it. I lost it for a while. When I did &quot;Various Positions&quot; it was coming back and when I got to &quot;I’m Your Man&quot; I was in full stride.&quot; In 1997, he reiterated to Nigel Williamson of &quot;Uncut&quot;, &quot;On &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;, my voice had settled and I didn&#x27;t feel ambiguous about it. I could at last deliver the songs with the authority and intensity required.&quot;

==Composition==
The album includes some of Cohen&#x27;s most popular songs and concert staples, including the single &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Cure for Love&quot;, &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot;, &quot;Tower of Song&quot;, and &quot;Everybody Knows&quot;, which was a collaboration with Cohen&#x27;s backing vocalist Sharon Robinson. &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; is known for its somber tone and repetition of the title at the beginning of most verses. Featuring phrases such as &quot;&quot;Everybody knows that the dice are loaded&quot; and &quot;Everybody knows that the good guys lost&quot;&quot;, the song has been variously described by critics as &quot;bitterly pessimistic&quot; yet funny, or, more strongly, a &quot;bleak prophecy about the end of the world as we know it.&quot; The lyrics include references to AIDS, social problems, and relationship and religion issues. The album&#x27;s opening track, &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot; (originally called &quot;In Old Berlin&quot;), deals with geopolitical ideas, specifically extremism, as he explained himself in a backstage interview:
:I think it means exactly what it says. It is a terrorist song. I think it&#x27;s a response to terrorism. There&#x27;s something about terrorism that I&#x27;ve always admired. The fact that there are no alibis or no compromises. That position is always very attractive. I don&#x27;t like it when it&#x27;s manifested on the physical plane – I don&#x27;t really enjoy the terrorist activities – but Psychic Terrorism. I remember there was a great poem by Irving Layton that I once read – I&#x27;ll give you a paraphrase of it – it was &quot;Well, you guys blow up an occasional airline and kill a few children here and there,&quot; he says. But our terrorists, Jesus, Freud, Marx, Einstein. The whole world is still quaking...

&quot;Take This Waltz&quot; was originally released as part the 1986 Federico García Lorca tribute album &quot;Poets in New York (Poetas en Nueva York)&quot; and as a single. It reached number one in Spain in 1986. The song appears on &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; in slightly re-arranged version (with addition of violin and Jennifer Warnes&#x27;s duet vocals, both absent from the 1986 version). The song&#x27;s lyrics are a loose translation of the poem &quot;Pequeño vals vienés&quot; by the Spanish poet Federico García Lorca (one of Cohen&#x27;s favorite poets). The poem was first published in Lorca&#x27;s seminal book &quot;Poet in New York/Poeta en Nueva York&quot;. In his 2010 Cohen biography, Anthony Reynolds claims that the unorthodox &quot;Jazz Police&quot; was Cohen&#x27;s response to his band&#x27;s effort to introduce augmented fifths and sevenths to their playing. He &quot;policed&quot; such jazz intrusions, although he &quot;wasn&#x27;t sure of the lyric&#x27;s meaning and grew to dislike the conceit.&quot; The genesis of &quot;Tower of Song&quot; is described in Ira Nadel&#x27;s 1996 Cohen memoir &quot;Various Positions&quot;:
:&quot;Tower of Song&quot; is the keynote work of &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;. With it Cohen wanted to &quot;make a definitive statement about the heroic enterprise of the craft&quot; of songwriting. In the early eighties he called the work &quot;Raise My Voice in Song&quot;. His concern was with the aging songwriter, and the &quot;necessity to transcend one&#x27;s own failure by manifesting as the singer, as the songwriter.&quot; He had abandoned the song, but one night in Montreal he finished the lyrics and called an engineer and recorded it in one take with a toy synthesizer.

Cohen revised the song, which contains the rumination, &quot;I was born like this, I had no choice/I was born with the gift of a golden voice.&quot; Ever mindful of his reputation as a &quot;flat singer&quot; among critics, audiences always erupted when Cohen sang these lines live. Cohen also cites Hank Williams, a songwriter he has professed great admiration for, in the song (&quot;...&quot;a hundred floors above me&quot;...&quot;). Cohen recited the lyrics in full when he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

Although Cohen had earned a reputation among critics and some listeners for excessive gloominess, several tracks on the album displayed his wry sense of humor and playfulness, such as the lascivious title track and &quot;I Can&#x27;t Forget&quot;, which he cited in a BBC interview with John Archer after the album&#x27;s release as an example of his simpler approach: &quot;I had to go back to the beginning and determine where I was in regard to my own song and I realized that I&#x27;d have to find another kind of language that was much flatter, which I think this record has...I began that lyric just trying to locate myself...That was really close to the bone, and that&#x27;s where I like to keep my lyrics now.&quot; In the Paul Zollo book &quot;Songwriters on Songwriting&quot; (1991), Cohen said of the song &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;: &quot;I sweated over that one. I really sweated over it. I can show you the notebook for that. It started off as a song called &quot;I Cried Enough for You&quot;. It was related to a version of &quot;Waiting for a Miracle&quot; that I recorded. The rhyme scheme was developed by toeing the line with that musical version that I put down. But it didn&#x27;t work.&quot; &quot;Ain&#x27;t No Cure for Love&quot;, with its slick AOR sound, was chosen as the first single. Although &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; did not do as well in the United States as it did in other countries, CBS Records awarded Cohen with the Crystal Globe award, reserved for artists who have sold more than five million albums overseas, to which Cohen famously quipped, &quot;I have always been touched by the modesty of their interest in my work.&quot;

==Album cover==
The album cover may be Cohen&#x27;s most memorable, featuring the dapper singer eating a banana. As recounted in Ira Nadel&#x27;s &quot;Various Positions&quot;, Cohen was at a Los Angeles warehouse to watch the filming of Jennifer Warnes&#x27;s music video &quot;First We Take Manhattan&quot; and was photographed by publicist Sharon Weisz in his dark glasses, charcoal gray pin-striped suit, and white T-shirt chomping on a banana: &quot;Sharon showed it to me later and it seemed to sum me up perfectly. &#x27;Here&#x27;s this guy looking cool,&#x27; I thought, &#x27;in shades and a nice suit. He seems to have a grip on things, an idea of himself.&#x27; And it suddenly occurred to me that&#x27;s everyone&#x27;s dilemma: at the times we think we&#x27;re the coolest, what everyone else sees is a guy with his mouth full of banana.&quot; Cohen liked the image so much that he not only used it for the album cover but as the poster images of his 1988 world tour.

==Critical reception==

&quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; was hailed by music critics as a return to form. It was No. 1 in Norway for 16 weeks. The album is silver in the UK and gold in Canada. In the original &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, David Browne called it &quot;the first Cohen album that can be listened to during the daylight hours.&quot; Jason Ankeny of AllMusic writes that &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot; &quot;re-establishes Leonard Cohen&#x27;s mastery. Against a backdrop of keyboards and propulsive rhythms, Cohen surveys the global landscape with a precise, unflinching eye: the opening &#x27;First We Take Manhattan&#x27; is an ominous fantasy of commercial success bundled in crypto-fascist imagery, while the remarkable &#x27;Everybody Knows&#x27; is a cynical catalog of the land mines littering the surface of love in the age of AIDS.&quot; It was ranked 51 on &quot;Pitchfork&quot;″s list of the 100 best albums of the 1980s. Tom Waits has named it one of his favourite albums. &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; listed the album at number 29 on its list of &quot;Best Albums of the 1980s&quot;. In a &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; top ten readers poll, three songs from the album – &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;, &quot;Tower of Song&quot;, and &quot;Everybody Knows&quot; – were voted the best Leonard Cohen songs of all time, ranking #10, #8 and #4, respectively. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. It was voted number 495 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot; (2000).

<text>Habonim Dror (, &quot;the builders–freedom&quot;) is the evolution of two Jewish Labour Zionist youth movements that merged in 1982.

Habonim (, &quot;the builders&quot;) was founded in 1929 in the United Kingdom and over a period of years, spread to all English-speaking countries. Each country developed its own independent version of the original movement whilst sharing the core ideology of being a Jewish Zionist-socialist cultural youth movement.

Dror (, &quot;freedom&quot;) was founded in Poland in 1915 out of a wing of the &quot;Tze&#x27;irei Zion&quot; (Zion Youth) study circle. The majority of &quot;Tze&#x27;irei Zion&quot; had merged with a group called &quot;Hashomer&quot; in 1913 to form &quot;Hashomer Hatzair&quot;, and those who remained outside of the new group formed Dror. The group was influenced by the teachings of the Russian Narodniks.

Members of Dror participated in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising. Mordechaj Tenenbaum and other Dror members organised two underground factions in the Bialystok Ghetto.

Dror was aligned with the HaKibbutz Hameuhad network, while Habonim was aligned with the Ichud kibbutzim. When the two kibbutz movements merged in 1980 to form the United Kibbutz Movement (&quot;TaKa&quot;M&quot;), so did their respective youth movements.

==Ideology==

Habonim Dror is a Jewish cultural youth movement, which exists to connect young Jews via Jewish culture, both within Israel and in the Jewish Diaspora. One of the central ideas is that of tikkun olam, a Hebrew phrase that means &quot;mending the world&quot; which originated in the early rabbinic period of Judaism. The Movement ideology falls into different categories. They are Judaism and Chalutziut (Pioneering), specifically Aliyah (moving to Israel, and more specifically to Kibbutz), collective action and mutual support that falls under the rubric of socialist ideology, and AliHagshama Atzmit (Self-realisation). These categories are not independent ideologies, each element integrates with others. Every &quot;chaver(a)&quot; (member) tends to embody the spirit of Habonim Dror and the underlying idea of mutual acceptance and support for one another through good works, based on their shared experiences and values gained in the movement. Habonim Dror&#x27;s ideology is an attempt to represent this forward direction.

The expression of these ideals involves gatherings and activities that include scouting, camping, hiking, as well as the education of the geography and history of Eretz Yisrael (the land of Israel). Jewish history is given attention, as are songs and dances taken from the pioneer days of the present State. Socialist ideals are expressed through interest in kibbutz and &quot;irbutz&quot; (urban communal living spaces movements) living.

== The Five Pillars ==
Habonim-Dror’s North American branch is based on five so-called &quot;pillars&quot;: Judaism, Labor Zionism, socialism, social justice, and Hagshama—commonly translated as actualization—by embodying and fulfilling the movements values through action. Judaism is mentioned first because this is a &quot;Jewish&quot; movement interested in the upbuilding of Israel through collective/collaborative work.

=== Judaism ===

While not an overtly religious organization, Habonim Dror aligns itself and upholds the importance of cultural judaism. Largely the organization does observe the Sabbath and welcomes in the new week with Havdalah. 

When the movement began in London there were only two &quot;pillars&quot;, namely Judaism and Scouting. As the ideology developed, Zionism was added along with Socialism. The latter two were connected through the desire to experiment with kibbutz life. The history of the movement was written and published in 1999 in a book &quot;Habonim in Britain 1928-1955&quot;.

=== Zionism ===
Habonim Dror is a Labor Zionist youth movement. Many of the educational programs offered by Habonim Dror relate to the history of the Jews and their desire for a homeland, and how collaborative work can set the stage for community and the ability to create a homeland supported by tikun olam and creating a vibrant and rich living experience. The movement encourages members to commit Aliyah. Generally, Habonim Dror opposes West Bank settlements and the ongoing occupation of the Palestinian Territories, whilst supporting Palestinian statehood and a committed path to peace and normalisation. Habonim Dror expresses the desire that Israelis and Arabs can live with trust of each other, learning to collaborate in order to create a peaceful existence for all that live in Israel, Palestine, and the surrounding countries.

===Socialism===
Habonim has always had at its core, the idea that socialist ideals can be beneficial to Jews and Arabs alike. The main principles of equality and sharing are very prominent in the movement. Everyone is treated as equal to each other (of course there is a divide between &quot;chanichim&quot; and &quot;madrichim&quot;). Facilities are generally shared, resulting in realization of a collaborative ideal. The unity and equality in Habonim can also be seen in the &quot;mifkad&quot; (מפקד) or the roll call held every morning (excluding the sabbath). At the &quot;mifkad&quot; the program of the day is presented and two songs are sung. The two songs are:

# &quot;Od Lo Gamarnu&quot; (עוד לא גמרנו) 
# &quot;hatikva&quot; (התקווה)

During the singing of these songs the flags of Habonim and the Israeli flag are raised.

==Origins in the United Kingdom==
Quoting the official history of Habonim Great Britain, &quot;a certain mystique surrounded the question of who founded the Habonim Movement but there is little doubt that the major personality behind the idea was Wellesley Aron&quot;. Aron acknowledges that he could not have succeeded without Chaim Lipshitz, who organized the first model Gedud (group), and Norman Lourie, whose enthusiasm helped generate other volunteer leaders. Lourie went on to found Habonim South Africa. Encouraged by them, Aron wrote the outline for the first Handbook and by April 1929 their organization was given the name Habonim. This was followed the next month, May 1929, by the first group, &quot;Gedud Trumpeldor&quot; led by Lipschitz. This date is acknowledged as the official founding date of Habonim.

According to Aron, he modeled Habonim after Baden-Powell&#x27;s Boy Scouts. The idea soon spread to other English-speaking countries and ex-colonies where Jews resided. In 1930, Norman Lourie founded Habonim Southern Africa, with the first camp taking place at Parys in 1931. Initially the idea was a &quot;Jewish Youth Cultural Movement&quot; for children aged between 12 and 18. Unlike other organizations in other countries, the movement was initially intended to be of a non-Zionist (non-political) kind.

== Early history ==

Lipschitz was the natural person to lead the first group since he had already organized meetings of boys at his father&#x27;s Cheder (school room) and they were well established by December 1928. (Incidentally this Cheder was one of the few more-progressive of these establishments, many were unattractive places that taught only traditional Hebrew and Torah (Biblical law).) The new group was where Chaim taught Modern Hebrew along with songs and dances of the Jewish settlers in Palestine, Jewish history and various games. Chaim was assisted by Norman Lourie, a visitor from South Africa who had previously visited Palestine. The aim of these group meetings was to attract and better educate the Jewish children of immigrants from Poland and Russia (mostly pre 1905, when immigration to the U.K. was severely limited), about their Jewish history and about the progress of the Jews presently living in Palestine. These children had somewhat dismal lives in the slums of the East-End, (Stepney and Whitechapel) which were not lightened by the mostly poor Cheder education system then available.

=== Official founding ===

The first meeting of leaders of the Jewish youth community as reported by Wellesley Aron, was in a letter to Dr. S. Brodetsky (of the Zionist Foundation) on 11 January 1929. Wellesley mentioned that only five people attended, but that Norman Lourie (the third founder) called a larger meeting for the following week (10 January) where representatives from at least seven Jewish youth organizations were present. This meeting was in London at 77 Great Russel Street EC1. England at this time was the center of political Zionism, after the Balfour Declaration in 1917 had stated that &quot;His Majesty&#x27;s Government favourably viewed the establishment of a Jewish National Home in Palestine&quot; (then under British mandate).

The new youth movement Habonim (The Builders) was deliberately non-Zionist in ideology. The first Gedud Trumpeldor was built on Lipschitz&#x27;s existing youth group in Stepney with Lipshitz as Rosh (leader) assisted by Norman Lourie. In May 1929 the first 27-page hand-booklet detailing how Habonim was to function was published by Aron with help in the mimeographing from Norman Lourie and his friend Nadia, who he later married.

They both returned to Norman&#x27;s home country South Africa in 1930, to establish Habonim branches in various towns and countries in that continent and in India.

=== Habonim UK &amp; Ireland 1929–1955 ===

The Movement grew very rapidly. In London alone there were 21 groups by 1932. The Movement had at least 2,500 members by the time of their ten-year &quot;Jamboree Camp&quot; in 1939. The various gedudim or groups were initially single sex (like the Scouting Movement) but were soon changed for boys and girls together. Associated but not part of the Movement were training farms, called Hachshara farms, for the older members to learn about agriculture and life on kibbutz, to which their aliyah (or &quot;going-up&quot; to Eretz Yisrael) would eventually lead.

During the Second World War the senior members of Habonim helped to organize and take care of the many refugee children who escaped from the Nazis through special Kindertransports. Their parents had agreed to this tragic life-time separation, which was arranged through some of the more future-minded Jewish organizations remaining in Europe. Other members whose aliyah was delayed due to the war, helped the war-time food shortage to be met by working as groups of laborers on various farming communities.

Graduates of British Habonim contributed significant manpower to the establishment of many kibbutzim in Israel, among others, Kfar Blum, Kfar Hanasi, Gesher Haziv, Beit HaEmek, Mevo Hama, Tuval and Amiad of these the most British is Kfar Hanassi.

==Today==
Today, Habonim Dror exists in seventeen countries worldwide. Habonim Dror&#x27;s sister movement in Israel is HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed.

Habonim Dror has also adopted gender-inclusive programming for its campers as per the Jewish principle of ‘shivyon erech ha’adam’ (equality of human value). Above providing gender-neutral washrooms, the movement&#x27;s summer camps have reconfigured portions of the highly gendered Hebrew language used on its campgrounds to affirm transgender and non-binary members. Rather than refer to campers as &quot;chanich&quot; (singular masculine) or &quot;chanicha&quot; (singular feminine), the word &quot;chanichol&quot; has been constructed to speak provide a gender-neutral option for a single camper, and &quot;chanichimot&quot; for a gender-neutral group of campers instead of &quot;chanichim&quot;, the plural masculine version. These changes have also been carried out for camp counsellors, originally called &quot;madrich&quot; (singular masculine), &quot;madricha&quot; (singular feminine), &quot;madrichim&quot; (plural masculine) or &quot;madrichot&quot; (plural feminine) now replaced with &quot;madrichol&quot; (singular gender-neutral) and &quot;madrichimot&quot; (plural gender-neutral).

==Countries in which Habonim Dror operates==
Habonim Dror operates in Aotearoa New Zealand, Argentina, Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Hungary, Mexico, the Netherlands, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Uruguay.

===New Zealand===
Habonim Dror Aotearoa New Zealand (HDANZ) has three main centres; Auckland being the largest, then Wellington and Christchurch. Each Ken runs weekly meetings. The movement come together for various seminars during the year as well as winter and summer camps. The summer camps run for ten days and are always in tents and on a farm. Habonim Dror Aotearoa New Zealand is possibly the last Jewish youth movement in the world to run their summer camps entirely under canvas, including digging own toilets. Winter camps are shorter and are held in cabins due to Aotearoa New Zealand&#x27;s climate. Habo ANZ celebrated its 70th anniversary in 2018. Habonim Dror Aotearoa New Zealand is a member of the Australasian Zionist Youth Council (AZYC).

=== Australia (HDOZ) ===
Habonim Dror, a.k.a. &quot;Habo&quot;, has four &quot;kenim&quot; (branches) around Australia. They are in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth and Ken Ha&#x27;Shemesh Ha&#x27;Olah, which runs online and branches out to smaller communities around the country. Habonim Dror Australia runs weekly meetings for students from years three to twelve as well as biannual camps. Each state runs independent winter camps and a summer camp for junior students (years three to eight), while annually in January all state movements come together for a federal camp (FEDCAMP) for years nine to twelve, which runs for ten days. Habonim Dror Australia is a member of the Australasian Zionist Youth Council (AZYC).

Every year chanichim (members) who have just finished high school travel to Israel for a year on Shnat Hachshara Ve&#x27;Hadracha le&#x27;Aliyah (Hebrew: שנת הכשרה והדרכה לעלייה, lit. &quot;year of preparation and guidance for Aliya&quot;), commonly shortened to &quot;Shnat&quot; (&quot;year of&quot;), where they go on an extensive experiential and educational process and actively carry out movement aims and engage with Israeli society.

==== History ====
Habonim was first brought to Australia in 1940, when seven new Australians decided to create a Zionist youth movement along similar lines to those that already existed in Europe. In March of that year the first meeting was held in Melbourne&#x27;s Herzl Hall, and later in December, Habonim&#x27;s first summer camp.

After a brief union with Betar in 1942, Habonim grew into an Australia-wide movement in May 1944. The following year, Habonim Australia&#x27;s first &quot;hachshara&quot; (preparation, in Hebrew: הכשרה) farm was established in Springvale, about 25 km out of Melbourne&#x27;s centre. The next year five Habonim graduates made aliyah settling on Kibbutz Kfar Blum.

In 1957, the first organised group of Habonim graduates made aliyah in a garin to Kibbutz Yizre&#x27;el. Six garinim would ultimately be formed with the intention of making aliyah. It is unclear how many succeeded.

In recent years, there has been a new drive of garin aliyah from HDOZ, with Garinim settling in Haifa, Tiberias and Tel Aviv. Garinim such as Ayalah (Shnat 2012), Mafteach (Shnat 2013) and Emesh (2014) have all renewed chalutzik aliyah from HDOZ.

==== Movement structure ====
At an Australia-wide level (federal), there is an executive secretariat (&quot;mazkirut&quot;, in Hebrew: מזכירות) which includes a Secretary-General (&quot;mazkir&quot;, in Hebrew: מזכיר), Treasurer (&quot;gizbar&quot;, in Hebrew: גיזבר), a Head of Education (&quot;rosh chinuch&quot;, in Hebrew: ראש חינוך), Rakaz Kehilah (&quot;רכז קהילה&quot;) and a Shnat co-ordinator (&quot;rakaz shnat&quot;, in Hebrew: רכז שנת). Each individual branch has a mazkir, gizbar and rosh chinuch executive position, along with an external community liaison (Rakaz Kehilah, in Hebrew: רכז קהילה) and an additional position for a representative from the year level returning from shnat.

Each shichvah (year level) has a tzevet (team) of madrichim (leaders) responsible for their educational process and general wellbeing. These madrichim will prepare and run peulot (activities) on a weekly basis for their chanichim, as well as biannual camps and other extra events such as shabbatonim (sleepover on shabbat). Tzvatim are made up of bogrim (madrichim who have returned from shnat) and madatzim (year 11 chanichim). Senior tzvatim are made up solely of bogrim, while junior tzvatim are primarily madatzim leading alongside bogrim who help guide them through their first year of leading. There is also a tzevet that is responsible for running peulot for bogrim themselves, ensuring that there is a continued educational process among the educators.

Additionally, there are other tafkidim (roles) that allow for madrichim to take responsibility for various aspects of the movement such as Judaism, Zionism, gardening, equipment and politics and social action.

===Belgium===
The Belgian ken is one of the biggest in Europe. Every Saturday afternoon, 130 haverim and madrichim get together in Brussels.

The structure of the movement changes a little each year with every new &quot;tsevet&quot; (team of madrihim between 16 and 18 years old). The roots of this structure are the election of two to four &quot;mazkirim&quot; (literally &quot;secretaries&quot; in Hebrew, who are the leaders of the madrihim), &quot;vaadot&quot; (literally &quot;committee&quot; in Hebrew, which are small groups of madrihim who are focused on one part of the movement (ex: promotion, events, the koladror (the youth movement&#x27;s monthly magazine edited, written and published by the madrihim))) and the &quot;shlihim&quot;(literally &quot;messengers&quot; in Hebrew, who are the adults in charge of the movement) 
The mazkirim, elected by the tsevet, are in charge of making sure that everything runs smoothly. They do not have more say or power in the making of decisions or organization of events but they are elected to supervise the ideas, events, and responsibilities of the madrihim, and to keep order during the &quot;yeshivot&quot; (meetings), during the Saturday afternoons, and during the four mahanot (camps) of the year.

Every year, Habonim Dror Belgium organizes 4 mahanot for the haverim. A small one of five days at the end of October/ beginning of November where one of the traditions is to celebrate Halloween together and another one is to commemorate Yitzhak Rabin&#x27;s assassination. One at the end of December/ beginning of January where the haverim, madrihim and shlihim ski together during 8/9 days. Another small mahane, during Pessah, in April, where the haverim love the &quot;droriades&quot; a day inspired by the lag ba&#x27;Omer (where the whole day is dedicated to sports games) and other fun activities during 6 days. And one big mahane kaïtz in July which lasts between 14 and 18 days which used to be (until 2019) with the French kenim of Paris and Marseille.

===Brazil===
The movement arrived in Brazil by influences of the Argentine activists, and began in Porto Alegre, in 1945 and then moved to São Paulo also in 1945. Within a few years, Habonim reached Curitiba and Rio de Janeiro. Some time later, it arrived in Recife, Salvador and Belo Horizonte. And, more recently, it reached Manaus and Fortaleza.

At these nine branches across the country, Habonim runs weekly activities for children, teenagers and young adults from 7 to 22 years old, as well as weekly-long &quot;Machanot&quot; (camps) in Summer and Winter. Also twice a year is held the National Machaneh.

Once in a two-year cycle, a &quot;Veidah Artzit&quot; (National Convention) is held, consisting of a meeting of all the senior members of the National Movement. The Veidah has powers to modify HD Brazil&#x27;s ideological platform, as long as it does not oppose the World Movement&#x27;s principles.

===Mexico===
The Mexico City ken is one of the most international connected keniano in the world working with North American and Latin America at the same time. Every Saturday afternoon, 10p chaverim and madrichim get together in Mexico City.

===The Netherlands===

In the 1920s the &quot;Joodse jeugdfederatie&quot; (Jewish Youth Federation) was founded by Zionist Jewish youngsters. The federation was open to all Jews in the Netherlands and it brought together a large number of young Jews seeking unity and comfort. The Federation supported the creation of a national Jewish home in former Palestine. During the World War II, many members were murdered in The Holocaust. After the war, those who survived and former members came into contact with the in 1928 formed Habonim in the United Kingdom. For 22 years the two movements worked together and this eventually led to the creation of Haboniem beHolland in 1950 (It would not receive official international recognition until 1951). During the following decades Haboniem gathered many followers, many of them Jewish teenagers seeking a way out of their lives with their parent. The purpose of Haboniem beHolland was to help in the building of Israel by supporting the aliyah, the movement of Jews to the Promised Land. The purpose has since changed to educating members about Israel, the Israeli–Palestinian conflict and the history of the Jewish People. In 1958 Haboniem merged with the Kibbutz movement &quot;Meyuchad&quot;. This led to the merging with the in 1915 formed &quot;dror&quot;. In the present day, Haboniem-Dror counts around 300 members of which around 150 are active and pay a contribution. The supporting of aliyah is mostly put aside for educating the Jewish youth on Israel, although it still remains something that some members undertake.

====Activities====
Haboniem-Dror organizes a number of activities for its members, the most prominent are The five camps and weekends or &quot;machanot; &quot;afdelingen&quot;, The general members assembly, &quot;Habo Goes&quot; and the &quot;Israelreis&quot;.&quot;

Twice a year, a general members assembly is held. Any member of Haboniem can attend. During the assembly, the progress of the movement is discussed and the financial plans are revealed. During the assembly, any member above 12 years old and who pays contribution can vote and put a motion on the floor. At the summer assembly, a new board is chosen. During some assemblies, the articles of association are changed. The last account of this was the change in 2014.

&quot;Habo goes&quot; are activities that take place outside the clubhouse (not including the &quot;machanot&quot;). These activities are often in the open air such as a barbecue or a sports day.
====Structure====
Haboniem has a group-based structure of members. The members who are under 17 years old ( JK7 or lower) are called &quot;chanichiem&quot; and the group above 17 years old is called &quot;madrichiem. Madrichiem&quot; are the leaders of the camp and are responsible for the organization, leading of the JKs, cooking, general entertainment, and the logistics. The main structure of groups is as follows: there are 6 official groups of &quot;chanichiem&quot; called JKs and from JK6 onwards the naming of groups stops since the members are all &quot;madrichiem&quot; by then ( unofficially there is a continuation of count).

===North America===
Habonim in North America (HDNA) was founded in April 1935 by Young Poale Zion, the youth arm of the Poale Zion Party, at a convention in Buffalo, NY. At its height, the movement had over 2,000 campers attending eleven summer camps throughout the US and Canada. Today, Habonim Dror North America (HDNA) runs many programs during the year, including a biannual &quot;veida&quot; (a mass meeting with representatives from around the movement), local events in central cities, kibbutzim in Israel, a year-long program in Israel (called Workshop), and many other ideology-focused gatherings. The Movement membership currently exceeds 1,700 youth and has been growing steadily over the past decade.

HDNA also runs six summer camps (called Machanot) across the continent. These have become a large part of the movement and in most cases are more important to members than local meetings (called ken meetings) since they play a key role in involving and recruiting new members to the movement.
The six camps are as follows:
* Camp Galil (Ottsville, Pennsylvania, USA)
* Camp Gesher (Cloyne, Ontario, Canada)
* Camp Gilboa (San Bernardino County, California, USA)
* Camp Miriam (Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada)
* Camp Moshava (Maryland) (Street, Maryland, USA)
* Camp Tavor (Three Rivers, Michigan, USA)

Some now defunct camps and Habonim hachshara farms are:
* Camp Amal (Vermont 1948–49, Na&#x27;aleh 1950, Cream Ridge 1951, Moshava 1952, Galil 1953)
* Camp Bonim (Dallas, Texas)
* Camp Ein Harod (Ellenville, NY; Originally: Liberty, NY)
* Camp Kinneret (Chelsea, Michigan); later merged with Camp Yad Ari to form Camp Tavor
* Camp Kvutzah Gimli (Gimli, Manitoba)
* Camp Kvutzah Montreal (St. Faustin, Quebec)
* Camp Tel Ari (Hunter, New York)
* Camp Tel Hai (New Buffalo, Michigan)
* Camp Tel Natan (Troy, Missouri)
* Camp Yad Ari (Waupaca, Wisconsin) later merged with Camp Kinneret to form Camp Tavor
* Cream Ridge Farm (Upper Freehold, New Jersey)
* Smithville Farm (Smithville, Ontario)
* Camp Na&#x27;aleh (Red Hook, New York; Elizaville, New York; Sidney, New York; Windsor, New York; and other locations)

Additionally, a five-week trip, named Machaneh Bonim in Israel (MBI) is a summer tour of Israel for 16-year-olds (summer after 10th grade). Students from the six camps spend time together and learn about Israel and the movement.

HDNA publishes &quot;B&#x27;tnua&quot;, the regular movement magazine.

Habonim Dror collaborated with Ameinu, Hashomer Hatzair, and Meretz USA to form the Union of Progressive Zionists campus network, which has now become J Street U, to which Habonim Dror North America only has an affiliation.

===Southern Africa===

History:

Habonim Dror Southern Africa (HDSA) was founded in 1930 by Norman Lourie. HDSA draws its membership from the Southern African region. However, the vast majority of its membership comes from South Africa.
When Norman Lourie initiated the founding of Habonim in 1930, it was essentially as
a Jewish equivalent of Baden-Powell’s Boy Scouts. Lourie himself had adopted the
idea in London where he had joined Wellesley Aron in the founding of Habonim on
the same model one year earlier. Its purpose was to foster a healthy, dual South
African and Jewish identity. However, from the outset, the focus of the Jewish part of
the identity was less Jewish religious observances (although these were never
overlooked) than identification with the Jewish national renaissance epitomised by
Zionism. As Norman Lourie explained in a talk to Women Zionists in November
1931: he was aiming “principally to stimulate Jewish boys and girls to a deeper
understanding and appreciation of the heritage of the Jewish past, leading to a vision
of the new Palestine as the spiritual pivot of our hopes.” Yet aliyah remained
unmentioned; Habonim’s official aims spoke only of stimulating Jewish boys and
girls ‘to a realisation of their heritage as Jews and their responsibilities, in particular
those relating to the upbuilding of Eretz Israel, which that heritage involves.’
It was particularly in its educational methodology that Habonim modelled itself on the
Boy Scouts, each unit called gedud, being divided into kevutzot (patrols, and the
senior bonim, aged about sixteen, being given responsibility as rashei kevutzot
(patrol leaders) over the younger bonim. Moreover, great emphasis was placed on
scouting and on a graded system of proficiency tests in scouting and Jewish
knowledge applied individually to each boneh. However, notwithstanding the
Scouts’ influence, the name Habonim (builders), and the educational-ideological
symbolism – such as ‘Call us not thy children (banayich), rather thy builders
(bonayich)’ – were firmly rooted in the Jewish heritage and in Zionism.

Published by Habonim Dror Southern Africa

Habonim emerged at a time when ripples of anti-Semitism were beginning to reach
South African shores from an increasingly Nazi Europe. In 1930 the South African
Quota Act all but put a stop to East European immigration to South Africa; in 1933
Local National Socialist, anti-Semitic Greyshirt organisations emerged; and generally
Jews experienced a sense of increasing exclusion from the mainstreams of white
South African experience. Given these circumstances, over and above the already
marked religio-ethnic consciousness of the mostly, Litvak-stock Jews of South Africa,
the new Habonim movement made phenomenal strides. Starting in March 1931 at
Doornfontein, Johannesburg, with a gedud of twelve boys whose madrich was
Norman Lourie himself, by the end of 1933 there were 56 gedudim comprising about
1100 members. Meanwhile, when the various Young Israel senior youth societies
formed a united Zionist Youth Council as a department of the Zionist Federation in
1932, this Council sought the affiliation also of Habonim which was still autonomous
and independent even of the Zionist Federation.

Structure:

HDSA&#x27;s two primary centres are based in Cape Town and Johannesburg, although the movement is active across the country. The movement is run by Movement workers known as the &#x27;Mazkirut.&#x27; These national workers run the movement throughout the year, overseeing the various projects that HDSA puts on. The Mazkirut also works with the Hanhaggah which include national and regional ken positions. The Hanhaggah is composed of two ken Va&#x27;ad Poels. On each ken VP, Cape Town and Johannesburg, is a rosh ken, two rosh bogrim and two rosh channichim. Additionally, the national positions include two rosh techni, Two rosh shorashim, and two rosh social media. 

Rosh techni: One in charge of the I.T. aspects of the Movement and the other manages the upgrades and maintenance of the campsite. 
Shorashim: This is the 3 week grade 10 culture and educational tour to Israel. 
Social Media: Running the social media accounts for the movement and doing the general publication of our activities.

The movement is structured as follows: 

Garinim (Gr 3 &amp; 4)
Shtilim (Gr 5 &amp; 6)
Bonim (Gr 7)
Amelim (Gr 8)
Sollelim (Gr 9)
Sayarim (Gr 10)
Shomrim (Gr 11)
Bogrim (Matric, university and above)

Ideology: 

HDSA defines itself as a Jewish Zionist Youth movement (See HDSA Constitution 2009). HDSA classifies itself as a left-wing movement. Unlike other Habonim Dror movements, HDSA does not classify itself as socialist but rather supports economic and social equality.

As a left-wing Zionist movement, HDSA promotes a two-state solution in Israel. It also encourages its members to live in Israel in a manner which positively contributes to Israeli society.

HDSA also places immense value on active citizenship and thus strives to educate its members on South Africa and encourages them to be active in creating a just and equal post apartheid South Africa.
Hagshama (Fulfilment)

Habonim Dror Southern Africa sees hagshama as the personal fulfilment process which leads to
achieving all the ideals of the movement and through which the chaver materialises the underpinning
values and principles of the HDSA movement. The movement believes in a dual hagshama. Therefore, Chalutzic Aliyah and social activism within
Southern Africa are each the full embodiment of HDSA’s ideological process.

● Chalutzic Aliyah is Aliyah with the intent of affecting social change and working to maintain a
significant Jewish identity. This should be achieved through addressing the issues highlighted
within the Zionism and Equality and Service to Humanity pillars within Israel.

● Social activism and cultural and civil engagement within Southern Africa in the realms of
socio-economic and political change. This should be achieved through addressing the issues
highlighted within the Equality and Service to Humanity pillar within Southern Africa, as well as
upholding the viable commitments encompassed in the Zionism and Judaism pillars.
HDSA encourages each chaver to face life inspired by the ideals upheld by the movement. Hagshama is
not a final goal but an ongoing process. Therefore, those who lead their lives consciously in pursuit of
their values and values of the movement and work to change the world according to their beliefs are
pursuing the hagshama process.

Whilst the above is the ultimate fulfilment of the movement, it must be stressed that service to the
movement is a crucial part of fulfilling the hachshara (preparation) of hagshama.
HDSA recognises and honours members throughout the movement’s history who have chosen to shape
their lives through this hagshama. Their contributions to Israel and Southern Africa are an inspiration and
dugma to us all.

Activities: 

HDSA has changed over the last decades as the South African Jewish community has shrunk. However, remains active running weekly meetings for Bogrim and shomrim members as well as other cultural events such as third seders, and outreach programes. 

HDSA annually hosts one of the largest summer camps in the Southern Hemisphere at their campsite in Onrus outside Cape Town. During the year, consistent activities are run for its members who range from the ages of 9–23. 
The ideological tenets of the movement such as Zionism, Socialism and Service to Humanity inform many of these activities. 

Additionally, HDSA runs an annual tour to Israel for 16-year-olds and sends many of its members on a ten-month post school program to Israel.
Furthermore, HDSA runs an April seminar for Bogrim 1s and Shomrim (the oldest shicvah of channies) focusing on HDSA history, Hadracha and ideological spects of HDSA. Whatsmore, HDSA runs a year long gap year programme which includes 3 monthsliving on a kibbutz, 3 months living in an urban commune and 4 months participating in the Machon programme. The gap year includes a trip to poland and various seminars. This includes a History of Habonim and Hagshamah seminar, Rabin seminar and Conflict seminar. Here shnatties grapple with relevant ideological and practical issues facing the Movement today.

=== United Kingdom ===
Habonim Dror United Kingdom (HDUK) has six kenim (branches) around the United Kingdom. They are in London, Leeds, Glasgow, Manchester, Liverpool and Nottingham. Habonim Dror United Kingdom runs meetings throughout the year as well as a Machaneh and Israel Tour in the Summer.

Habonim Dror has five Machanot, one on a residential site in Wales, where chanichim (participants) will spend time hiking, in education activities, celebrating shabbat and many other activities. Additionally, there is Sayarim Machane which is run in Holland. This Machane is focused on Holocaust education, and is well known for the quality of education and the experience on this Machane.

When chanichim are 16 they go on the Israel Tour, a month trip around Israel, where they are immersed in the culture and history of Israel. In this time, chanichim will travel around Israel, learning about and visiting a variety of sites, they will also be volunteering and spending an entire day with other Habonim Dror tour participants from all over the world. After returning from Israel Tour, participants become Madrichim (leaders) and will spend the year doing Hadracha (leadership) training in preparation for them to take on roles in the summer across a variety of Machanot.

Every year chanichim who have just finished high school travel to Israel for a year on Shnat Hachshara, commonly referred to as Shnat, where they go on an extensive experiential and educational process and actively carry out movement aims and engage with Israeli society.

<doc id="1101694" wikidata="Q2211166" url="?curid=1101694" title="Isometry group">
<text>In mathematics, the isometry group of a metric space is the set of all bijective isometries (that is, bijective, distance-preserving maps) from the metric space onto itself, with the function composition as group operation. Its identity element is the identity function. The elements of the isometry group are sometimes called motions of the space.

Every isometry group of a metric space is a subgroup of isometries. It represents in most cases a possible set of symmetries of objects/figures in the space, or functions defined on the space. See symmetry group.

A discrete isometry group is an isometry group such that for every point of the space the set of images of the point under the isometries is a discrete set.

In pseudo-Euclidean space the metric is replaced with an isotropic quadratic form; transformations preserving this form are sometimes called &quot;isometries&quot;, and the collection of them is then said to form an isometry group of the pseudo-Euclidean space.

==Examples==

* The isometry group of the subspace of a metric space consisting of the points of a scalene triangle is the trivial group. A similar space for an isosceles triangle is the cyclic group of order two, C2. A similar space for an equilateral triangle is D3, the dihedral group of order 6. 
* The isometry group of a two-dimensional sphere is the orthogonal group O(3).

* The isometry group of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space is the Euclidean group E(&quot;n&quot;).
* The isometry group of the Poincaré disc model of the hyperbolic plane is the projective special unitary group PSU(1,1).
* The isometry group of the Poincaré half-plane model of the hyperbolic plane is PSL(2,R).
* The isometry group of Minkowski space is the Poincaré group.

* Riemannian symmetric spaces are important cases where the isometry group is a Lie group.

<doc id="1101705" wikidata="Q256907" url="?curid=1101705" title="Argonaut Games">
<text>Argonaut Games is a British video game developer founded in 1982. It was known for the Super NES video game &quot;Star Fox&quot; and its supporting Super FX chip, and for &quot;&quot; and the &quot;Starglider&quot; series. The company was liquidated in late 2004, and ceased to exist in early 2007. It was relaunched in 2024.

==History==

Founded as Argonaut Software by teenager Jez San in 1982, the company name is a play on his name (J. San) and the mythological story of &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot;.

Its head offices were in Colindale, London, and later in the Argonaut House in Edgware, London. Its U.S. head office was in Woodside, California in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In 1990, Argonaut collaborated with Nintendo during the early years of the NES and SNES, a notable incident being when Argonaut submitted a proof-of-concept method of defeating the Game Boy&#x27;s copyright protection mechanism to Nintendo. The combined efforts from Argonaut and Nintendo yielded a prototype of the game &quot;Star Fox&quot;, initially codenamed &quot;SnesGlider&quot; and inspired by their earlier Atari ST and Amiga game &quot;Starglider&quot;, that they had running on the NES and then some weeks later on a prototype SNES. Jez San told Nintendo that his team could only improve performance or functionality of the demonstration if Nintendo allowed Argonaut to design custom hardware to extend the SNES to have true 3D capability. Nintendo agreed, so San hired chip designers and made the Super FX chip. They originally codenamed it the Mathematical Argonaut Rotation I/O, or &quot;MARIO&quot;, as is printed on the chip&#x27;s surface. So powerful was the Super FX chip used to create the graphics and gameplay, that they joked that the Super NES was just a box to hold the chip.

After building the Super FX, Argonaut designed several different chips for other companies&#x27; video game machines, which were never released. These include machines codenamed &quot;GreenPiece&quot; and &quot;CD-I 2&quot; for Philips, the platform codenamed &quot;VeggieMagic&quot; for Apple and Toshiba, and Hasbro&#x27;s &quot;virtual reality&quot; game system codenamed &quot;MatriArc&quot;.

In 1995, Argonaut Software was split into Argonaut Technologies Limited (ATL) and Argonaut Software Limited (ASL). With space being a premium at the office on Colindale Avenue, ATL was relocated to an office in the top floor of a separate building. The building was called Capitol House on Capitol Way, just around the corner. There, they continued the design of CPU and GPU products and maintained &quot;BRender&quot;, Argonaut&#x27;s proprietary software 3D engine. They won a chip design project with LSI Logic for a potential PlayStation 2 design. LSI Logic became a minor investor in Argonaut.

In 1996, John Edelson was hired as the company General Manager. John Edelson ran the group for two years. Capital was raised in 1996–1998 from Tom Teichman and Apax Partners. According to Jez San, Argonaut remained an independent developer by choice, and had turned down several buyout offers.

In 1997, the two arms of the company once again shared an office as the entire company was moved to a new building in Edgware. In September 1997, &quot;&quot; was released by Fox Interactive for the PlayStation and Sega Saturn. A PC version of the game was also later released in 1998.

In 1998, ATL was rebranded &quot;ARC&quot; after the name of their main product, the Argonaut RISC Core, and became an independent company spun off to the same shareholders. ARC was an embedded IP provider. Bob Terwilliger was engaged as the President.

Argonaut Software Limited became Argonaut Games and was floated in 1999.

In early October 2004, Argonaut Games called in receivers David Rubin &amp; Partners, laid off 100 employees, and was put up for sale. Many former employees would join newly established developer Rocksteady Studios. A lack of a consistent stream of publishing deals had led to cash-flow issues and a profit warning earlier that year. In 2005, the company entered liquidation and was dissolved in early 2007.

===Reopening (2024–present)===
On 28 August 2024, Jez San reopened Argonaut Games as a boutique publisher that would focus on re-releasing and remastering Argonaut&#x27;s existing franchises alongside the publication of third-party independent titles. Its first release is a remaster of &quot;Croc: Legend of the Gobbos&quot;, which had previously been teased by San the previous year.

On 25 September 2024, Argonaut announced they had made a strategic investment in Ancient Machine, the developer of the forthcoming PC narco-thriller &quot;VICE Undercover&quot;.

==BRender==
BRender (abbreviation of &quot;Blazing Renderer&quot;) is a development toolkit and a realtime 3D graphics engine for computer games, simulators, and graphic tools. It was developed and licensed by Argonaut Software. The engine supports Intel&#x27;s MMX instruction set and Windows, MS-DOS, and PlayStation platforms. Support for 3D hardware graphics accelerator cards was added. Software made with BRender includes &quot;Carmageddon&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;FX Fighter&quot;, &quot;I-War&quot;, and &quot;3D Movie Maker&quot;. It was released as free and open-source software under the MIT License on 3 May 2022.

<doc id="1101711" wikidata="Q331903" url="?curid=1101711" title="Various Positions">
<text>Various Positions is the seventh studio album by Leonard Cohen, released in December 1984 (and February 1985). It marked not only his turn to a modern sound and use of synthesizers (particularly on the opening track), but also, after the harmonies and backing vocals from Jennifer Warnes on the previous &quot;Recent Songs&quot; (1979), an even greater contribution from Warnes, who is credited with Cohen as vocalist on all of the tracks.

==Background==
After recording &quot;Recent Songs&quot;, Cohen did not record again for five years and published no new writing until &quot;Book of Mercy&quot; in 1984. Asked in 2001 by &quot;Mojo&quot;″s Sylvie Simmons about this period of inactivity, the singer replied, &quot;My children were living in the South of France and I spent a lot of time visiting them. The pieces in &quot;Book of Mercy&quot; were coming and I was, slowly, writing the album that ended up as &quot;Various Positions&quot;.&quot; Cohen did write and star in the 1983 made-for-TV musical &quot;I Am a Hotel&quot;, which featured several of his songs in the narration. &quot;Various Positions&quot; was produced by John Lissauer, who had been at the helm of Cohen&#x27;s 1974 album &quot;New Skin for the Old Ceremony&quot;. The pair had not worked together or even spoken since a project called &quot;Songs For Rebecca&quot; had been scuttled by Cohen&#x27;s manager Marty Machat to clear the way for the singer to work with Phil Spector on 1977&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Ladies&#x27; Man&quot;. In the interim, Lissauer had worked with Barbra Streisand, Manhattan Transfer, and had scored films. According to Anthony Reynolds 2010 memoir &quot;Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life&quot;, the pair met at the Royalton on 44th Street in New York City so Cohen could play Lissauer his songs, and the producer was surprised: Another alteration that Lissauer noticed was the remarkable change in Cohen&#x27;s singing, with his voice having dropped about a minor third. Cohen later remarked to author Paul Zollo in the book &quot;Songwriters on Songwriting&quot;: The use of synthesisers and Cohen&#x27;s &quot;new voice&quot; would mark the beginning of a new era in Cohen&#x27;s composing style and sound.

==Recording==
The album was recorded at Quadrasonic Sound in New York in the summer of 1983 with Leanne Ungar engineering. A small core of musicians from a group called Slow Train backed Cohen on the album. Speaking with Judith Fitzgerald of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; in 2000, Cohen cited &quot;Various Positions&quot; as a breakthrough of sorts:
It was the first time I could really see and intuitively feel what it was I was doing, making or creating in that enterprise. After a long period of barrenness, it all just seemed to click. Suddenly, I knew these weren&#x27;t discrete songs I was writing ... I could see – I could sense a unity. &quot;Various Positions&quot; had its own life, its own narrative. It was all laid out and all of a sudden it all made sense. It was almost painfully joyful, if that makes some sense. The pulling and the putting of the pieces together coherently, the being inside of that process and knowing, once I&#x27;d done that, it would be finished and I would have to leave it and go back to the world.
The album contains two songs that would become live standards for Cohen: &quot;Dance Me to the End of Love&quot; and &quot;Hallelujah&quot;. In 2010, producer John Lissauer revealed to Cohen biographer Anthony Reynolds that the drum track on the former is actually from the Casio keyboard the song had been composed on: &quot;It didn&#x27;t even have audio output so we had to mike it up. We tried to do that song with real drums and percussion but he liked the simplicity of the Casio and had become accustomed to it.&quot; This explains the slight strain in Cohen&#x27;s singing on the track; changing the key on the Casio would have meant altering the drum pattern that Cohen wanted to use (The song, which would become Cohen&#x27;s perennial show opener, is performed in a lower key live). Although structured as a love song, &quot;Dance Me to the End of Love&quot; was in fact inspired by the Holocaust. In an interview, Cohen said of the song:
Along with &quot;Suzanne&quot;, &quot;Hallelujah&quot; is arguably Cohen&#x27;s most famous song. The original version is in 6/8 time, which evokes both waltz and gospel music. Written in the key of C major, the chord progression matches lyrics from the song: &quot;goes like this, the fourth, the fifth, the minor fall, and the major lift&quot;: C, F, G, A minor, F. Cohen wrote around 80 draft verses for the tune, with one writing session at the Royalton Hotel in New York where he was reduced to sitting on the floor in his underwear, banging his head on the floor. The song contains several biblical references, most notably evoking the stories of Samson and traitorous Delilah from the Book of Judges (&quot;she cut your hair&quot;) as well as the adulterous King David and Bathsheba (&quot;you saw her bathing on the roof, her beauty in the moonlight overthrew you&quot;). Asked about the phenomenal success of the song in 2009, Cohen told the CBC Radio show &quot;Q&quot;:
I was happy that the song was being used. Of course, there was certain ironic and amusing sidebars because the record that it came from, which was called &quot;Various Positions&quot;, that record Sony wouldn&#x27;t put out. They didn&#x27;t think it was good enough ... So there was a mild sense of revenge that arose in my heart. I was happy about it but it&#x27;s ... I was just reading a review of a movie called &quot;Watchmen&quot; that uses it, and the reviewer said, &quot;Can we please have a moratorium on &#x27;Hallelujah&#x27; in movies and television shows?&quot; And I kind of feel the same way ... I think the song came out in &#x27;83 or &#x27;84, and the only person who seemed to recognize the song was Dylan. He was doing it in concert. Nobody else recognized the song till quite a long time later, I think.

Although it featured a more contemporary sound for its time compared with the singer&#x27;s previous LPs, Columbia did not think it was commercially viable and decided not to release &quot;Various Positions&quot; in the US. Cohen has said that Walter Yetnikoff, president of the company, called him to his office in New York City and said, &quot;Look, Leonard; we know you&#x27;re great, but we don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re any good.&quot; Cohen has also stated that Columbia felt it wasn&#x27;t contemporary and that Yetnikoff didn&#x27;t like the mix.

&quot;Various Positions&quot; was eventually picked up by the independent label Passport Records, and the album was finally included in the catalogue in 1990 when Columbia released the Cohen discography on compact disc. A remastered CD was issued in 1995.

==Reception==

&quot;Various Positions&quot; made the top ten in Spain, Portugal, and Scandinavia, and fared modestly well in the United Kingdom. In the original 1985 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review, Don Shewey complimented Lissauer&#x27;s &quot;lucid and beautiful production&quot; and observed, &quot;Many of the new songs have a surprising country &amp; western flavor, which comes partly from the use of pedal steel guitars and partly from the simple song structures. &#x27;Heart with No Companion&#x27; wouldn&#x27;t sound out of place on a Johnny Cash record.&quot; Jason Ankeny of AllMusic calls it &quot;a stunning return to form – Cohen&#x27;s strongest work since &quot;New Skin for the Old Ceremony&quot;. Cryptic and spartan, the set continues in the eclectic vein of recent efforts, but with greater clarity and focus, resulting in an intriguingly diffuse collection ranging from the Serge Gainsbourg-esque pop of &#x27;Dance Me to the End of Love&#x27; to the boozy, country-inflected &#x27;The Captain.&#x27;&quot; Writing about Cohen&#x27;s approach to the album, Robert Christgau commented that &quot;If you&#x27;re sick of hearing him whisper in your ear that to be a roue is a religious calling, so be it--me, I think this is a better advertisement for middle-aged sex than &quot;Dynasty.&quot;&quot;

==Covers==
The unusually straightforward love song &quot;Coming Back to You&quot; was covered by both Trisha Yearwood and Martin L. Gore on the Cohen tribute album &quot;Tower of Song&quot;. &quot;If It Be Your Will&quot; also appears on &quot;Tower of Song&quot;, performed by Jann Arden. The song was further covered by Anohni and the Johnsons frontwoman Anohni Hegarty for a 2005 documentary, &quot;Leonard Cohen: I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;. Ron Sexsmith performed &quot;Heart With No Companion&quot; on his eponymous 1995 release. In 2004, jazz singer Madeleine Peyroux covered &quot;Dance Me to the End of Love&quot; on her album &quot;Careless Love&quot;; the version even became a hit in Brazil. The best-known, and most-covered song on the album, however, is &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, having been recorded by John Cale, Jeff Buckley (in one of the song&#x27;s most acclaimed versions), and many others. &quot;Hallelujah&quot;, &quot;Dance Me to the End of Love&quot; and &quot;If It Be Your Will&quot; all appear on the Canadian singer Patricia O&#x27;Callaghan&#x27;s fifth solo album &quot;Matador: The Songs of Leonard Cohen&quot; released in 2011.

<doc id="1101715" wikidata="Q648789" url="?curid=1101715" title="Paul Brady">
<text>Paul Joseph Brady (born 19 May 1947) is an Irish singer-songwriter and musician from Strabane, Northern Ireland. His work straddles folk and pop. He was interested in a wide variety of music from an early age. 

Initially popular for playing Irish traditional music in a duo with Andy Irvine and later with Tommy Peoples and Matt Molloy, he later turned to a more rock-inspired electric style with poignant political lyrics. Some of his most popular songs are: &quot;Crazy Dreams&quot;, &quot;Nothing but the Same Old Story&quot;, &quot;The Island&quot;, &quot;Night Hunting Time&quot;, &quot;Steel Claw&quot; and &quot;Paradise Is Here&quot;.

==Early life==
Paul Joseph Brady was born in Belfast and raised in the small town of Strabane in County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, on the border with County Donegal, Republic of Ireland. His father Seán Brady and mother Mollie Brady née McElholm were school teachers. Brady was educated at Sion Mills Primary School, St. Columb&#x27;s College, Derry and University College Dublin. He is featured in the documentary film &quot;The Boys of St. Columb&#x27;s&quot;.

He began learning piano around age six and by the age of eleven he had begun to play guitar, spending hours of his school holidays learning every song that the Shadows had recorded. He was also influenced by Chuck Berry.

In 1963, Brady began performing as a piano player in a hotel in Bundoran, Donegal. In October 1964, he attended University College Dublin and performed with a number of RnB groups, covering songs by the likes of Ray Charles and James Brown. The first of these was the Inmates (late 1964–about April 1965), which evolved into the Kult (about April–December 1965), featuring Brady, Jackie McAuley (ex-Them, and future Belfast Gypsies and Trader Horne), Brendan Bonass, and Dave Pennefather. Brady can be seen in the documentary film &quot;Charlie Is My Darling&quot; waiting outside Dublin&#x27;s Adelphi Theatre for the Rolling Stones&#x27; concert of 3 September 1965. He next joined Rootzgroup (late 1965–May 1966) and Rockhouse (about May–December 1966).

==Musical career==
===1960s and 1970s===
During his time at college in Dublin, the country saw a huge rise in interest in traditional Irish music. Brady joined the popular Irish band The Johnstons when Michael Johnston left in May 1967. They moved to London, England, in 1969 and subsequently to New York City in 1972 to expand their audience. Despite some success, Brady returned to Ireland in 1974 to join the Irish group Planxty, the band that would subsequently launch the solo careers of Andy Irvine, Liam O&#x27;Flynn, Dónal Lunny, and Christy Moore.

When Planxty disbanded in late 1975, Brady formed a duo with Irvine from 1976 to 1978, a partnership that produced the successful album, &quot;Andy Irvine/Paul Brady&quot;. The next few years saw him establish his popularity and reputation as one of Ireland&#x27;s best interpreters of traditional songs. His versions of ballads like &quot;Arthur McBride&quot; and &quot;The Lakes of Pontchartrain&quot; were considered definitive and are still popular at concerts today. In 1975 in New York he recorded two albums for Shanachie Records as guitar accompanist to resident Irish fiddlers Andy McGann and Paddy Reynolds. He also recorded a 1976 album, &quot;The High Part of the Road&quot;, for the same label with Irish fiddler Tommy Peoples. And a 1977 Shanachie album with another Irish fiddler named John Vesey.

===Solo career===
In 1978, Brady released his first solo album, &quot;Welcome Here Kind Stranger&quot;, which won him critical acclaim and was awarded the Melody Maker Folk Album of the Year. However, it would prove to be Brady&#x27;s last album covering traditional material. He decided to delve into pop and rock music, and released his first album of this genre in 1981, &quot;Hard Station&quot;.

Brady released a number of successful solo albums throughout the 1980s: &quot;True for You&quot; (1983), &quot;Back to the Centre&quot; (1986), and &quot;Primitive Dance&quot; (1987). By the end of the decade, Brady was recognised and accepted as a respected performer and songwriter. His songs were being covered by a number of other artists, including Santana and Dave Edmunds. 

When Tina Turner heard a demo of his song &quot;Paradise Is Here&quot;, she recorded it for her &quot;Break Every Rule&quot; album of 1986. By now, he was a favourite songwriter among such artists as Bob Dylan and Bonnie Raitt, who would do a duet with Brady on his 1991 album, &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;. A couple of Brady songs soon appeared on Raitt&#x27;s album &quot;Luck of the Draw&quot;, including the title track.

Dylan was sufficiently impressed by Brady&#x27;s work to name-check him in the booklet of his 1985 box set, &quot;Biograph&quot;. The actual quote was &quot;(...) people get too famous too fast these days and it destroys them. Some guys got it down-Leonard Cohen, Paul Brady, Lou Reed, secret heroes, John Prine, David Allen Coe, Tom Waits. I listen more to that kind of stuff than whatever is popular at the moment. They&#x27;re not just witchdoctoring up the planet, they don&#x27;t set up barriers (...)&quot;.

In 1991, Brady reached number 5 in the Irish Singles Chart with &quot;Nobody Knows&quot;.

Since his &quot;Hard Station&quot; album (1981), Brady was on various major labels until he created his own label, PeeBee Music, in the late 1990s. He released three albums in the 1990s: &quot;Trick or Treat&quot;, &quot;Songs &amp; Crazy Dreams&quot; (a remixed compilation of earlier songs) and &quot;Spirits Colliding&quot;, which were met with critical acclaim. &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; was on Fontana/Mercury Records and received a lot of promotion. As a result, some critics considered it his debut album and noted that the record benefited from the expertise of experienced studio musicians, as well as producer Gary Katz, who worked with the rock group Steely Dan. Rolling Stone, after praising Brady&#x27;s earlier but less-known solo records, called &quot;Trick or Treat&quot; Brady&#x27;s &quot;most compelling collection.&quot;

Brady went on to record several other albums (15 in total since he went solo in 1978) and collaborated with a number of other established musicians including Bonnie Raitt and Richard Thompson. In 2006, he collaborated with Cara Dillon on the track &quot;The Streets of Derry&quot; from her album &quot;After the Morning&quot;. He has also worked with Fiachra Trench.

He performed Irish language songs as a character in the 2002 Matthew Barney film &quot;Cremaster 3&quot;. He also played tin whistle on the single &quot;One&quot; by Greg Pearle in 2008, from the album &quot;Beautiful You&quot;, a collaboration between Greg Pearle and John Illsley; this song featured in the 2008 film &quot;Anton&quot;, directed by Graham Cantwell.

Brady&#x27;s fifteenth studio album, &quot;Hooba Dooba&quot;, was released in March 2010.

As of 2017, a friendship was struck with Theo Katzman (vulfpeck) and Brady toured Ireland in 2019 as half of this duo with Joe Dart, also of vulfpeck, Louis Cato and Lee Pardini.

Brady had continued to tour, record and collaborate with other artists. In 2019, Jimmy Buffett began performing a cover of Brady&#x27;s hit, &quot;The World is What you Make It&quot;. In September 2019, Brady joined Jimmy Buffett on his tour stops in both Dublin and London.

He released the album &quot;Unfinished Business&quot; on his own label PeeBee Music, licensed to Proper Music UK, in 2017.

While Brady and Andy Irvine&#x27;s planned tour of their 1976 album &quot;Andy Irvine, Paul Brady&quot; was impacted by the Covid pandemic, they finished the tour in 2022. Musicians to join them on the tour included fiddle player Kevin Burke and multi-instrumentalist Dónal Lunny, both of whom had played on the original album.

==Awards==
In 2009, Brady received an honorary degree of Doctor of Letters from the University of Ulster, in recognition of his services to traditional Irish music and songwriting.

<text>Craig Gannon (born 30 July 1966) is an English guitarist, best known as the second guitarist in the Smiths (1986). He is now a composer for film and television.

==Career==
Born in Manchester, Gannon had played in bands with friends since he was 12 years old, and in 1983 joined Aztec Camera after replying to an ad in &quot;Melody Maker&quot;. In 1984, he briefly joined The Colourfield, and went on to join The Bluebells. After another brief stint in The Colourfield, when bass player Andy Rourke was fired from the Smiths in early 1986, Gannon was hired to replace him. Within a fortnight, however, Rourke was reinstated and Gannon moved to rhythm guitar, becoming the official fifth member, playing on the &quot;Panic&quot; and &quot;Ask&quot; singles and touring the UK, Canada, and the US with the band. Gannon also played on the scrapped single &quot;You Just Haven&#x27;t Earned It Yet, Baby&quot;, which was included on &quot;The World Won&#x27;t Listen&quot; compilation album. After the tour ended in October 1986, Gannon was no longer part of the line-up. He played on a total of six Smiths tracks, all recorded in 1986, as well as all tracks on the live &quot;Rank&quot; album. Gannon has been affectionately known thereafter as &#x27;The Fifth Smith&#x27;. 

After leaving the Smiths, Gannon joined Brix Smith in The Adult Net and Blue Orchids. He reunited with Morrissey at his debut solo gig and 1989 singles &quot;The Last of the Famous International Playboys&quot; and &quot;Interesting Drug&quot;, but that same year saw him sue Morrissey and Johnny Marr for nonpayment of wages and over the degree of his involvement in songwriting (notably for &quot;Ask&quot;). The matter was settled out of court for the sum of £44,000. This amount included £30,000 for unpaid wages and £14,000 in legal costs. Gannon composed the music used on the &quot;Inside The Smiths&quot; DVD, released by former Smiths Mike Joyce and Andy Rourke. In addition to this, Gannon also appeared in and composed the music for a classic albums DVD of &quot;The Queen Is Dead&quot; – released in May 2008.

In the mid-1990s, he was in the initial line-up of Black Grape. He has played guitar with many other artists, including Terry Hall, Roddy Frame, Alison Moyet, Denise Van Outen, Edwyn Collins, and Paul Quinn. He was also asked to join Orange Juice&#x27;s James Kirk and Steven Daly&#x27;s band Memphis), Buzzcocks/FOC, Robert Lloyd, Deadly Avenger, Red Venom, Vinny Peculiar, and The Family Foundation. In 2014, Gannon was asked to play with The Specials but declined.

<doc id="1101722" wikidata="Q399541" url="?curid=1101722" title="Board of education">
<text>A board of education, school committee or school board is the board of directors or board of trustees of a school, local school district or an equivalent institution.

The elected council determines the educational policy in a small regional area, such as a city, county, state, or province. Frequently, a board of directors power with a larger institution, such as a higher government&#x27;s department of education. The name of such board is also often used to refer to the school system under such board&#x27;s control.

The government department that administered education in the United Kingdom before the foundation of the Ministry of Education was formerly called the Board of Education.

Boards of education serve as crucial pillars in the architecture of educational systems worldwide, shaping policies, guiding institutions, and influencing the future of generations. This essay embarks on a journey through the history of boards of education, exploring their evolution, functions, and the nuanced ways they operate across diverse school systems and nations.

== History ==
The roots of school boards can be traced back to the 19th century when the expansion of formal education systems necessitated organized oversight. The establishment of local and regional boards emerged as a response to the growing complexities of educational administration. In the United States, for instance, the concept gained prominence in the mid-1800s, reflecting a commitment to providing accessible and quality education. These early boards were often community-driven, reflecting the values and priorities of the local populace.

As educational systems evolved, so did the roles and structures of boards of education. The 20th century witnessed the refinement of their functions, with an increasing emphasis on standardized curricula, teacher accreditation, and equitable resource distribution. In other parts of the world, such as Europe and Asia, variations in the historical development of boards of education reflect unique cultural, social, and political contexts.

== Function ==
School boards are multifaceted in the way that they function, encompassing policy formulation, resource allocation, oversight of educational institutions, and representation of community interests. One primary function is the establishment and review of educational policies that guide curriculum development, assessment strategies, and teaching methodologies. These policies serve as the framework within which schools operate, shaping the educational experiences of students.

Resource allocation is another critical aspect of a Board&#x27;s role. Boards of education are responsible for approving budgets, determining funding priorities, and ensuring that financial resources are distributed equitably among schools. This function is central to addressing issues of educational equity, ensuring that all students have access to essential resources regardless of their socio-economic background.

Oversight of educational institutions involves the hiring and evaluation of school administrators, addressing concerns related to teacher performance, and monitoring the overall effectiveness of the educational system. Boards act as a bridge between the community and the schools, representing the interests and values of the constituents they serve.

== Structure ==
The structure and functionality of boards of education vary significantly across nations and even within different regions of a country. In the United States, for example, each state operates its own educational system, and the governance structure of school boards can differ widely. Some states have elected school boards, while others may have appointed boards or a combination of both. Additionally, there are variations in the powers bestowed upon these boards, ranging from significant decision-making authority to advisory roles.

In contrast, countries like Finland have a more centralized educational system with less emphasis on local school boards. The national education agency plays a more direct role in setting policies, developing curricula, and ensuring consistency across the country. The Finnish approach reflects a different cultural and administrative philosophy, where trust in educators and a focus on professional development are central tenets.

In Asian countries like Japan and South Korea, school boards may exist at the local level, but their functions and powers are often influenced by national policies. The emphasis on a strong central government role in education reflects the cultural values and historical contexts of these nations.

== Challenges ==
Boards of education face numerous challenges in their efforts to navigate the ever-evolving landscape of education. One common challenge is the balancing act between local autonomy and the need for standardized practices. Striking the right balance ensures that educational policies align with the unique needs of communities while maintaining a level of consistency in educational standards.

Globalization and technological advancements bring forth new challenges and opportunities. School boards must grapple with issues related to digital literacy, the integration of technology in the classroom, and preparing students for a rapidly changing global landscape. The role of boards is expanding beyond traditional functions as they navigate the complexities of the digital age.

Innovations in educational governance also emerge as boards adapt to contemporary challenges. Some educational systems experiment with participatory models, involving parents, teachers, and community members in decision-making processes. This collaborative approach aims to create a sense of shared responsibility and foster a deeper connection between the community and the educational system.

<doc id="1101723" wikidata="Q1640209" url="?curid=1101723" title="Battle of Aizkraukle">
<text>The Battle of Aizkraukle or Ascheraden was fought on 5 March 1279 between the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led by Traidenis, and the Livonian branch of the Teutonic Order near Aizkraukle () in present-day Latvia. The order suffered a great defeat: 71 knights, including the grand master, Ernst von Rassburg, and Eilart Hoberg, leader of the knights from Danish Estonia, were killed. It was the second-largest defeat of the order in the 13th century. After the battle Duke Nameisis of the Semigallians recognized Traidenis as his suzerain.

==Background==
In 1273 the order built Dinaburga Castle on lands nominally controlled by Traidenis. The castle was of great strategic importance: it was used as a base for raids into central Lithuania in hopes that a weakened Traidenis would discontinue his support of Semigalians who rebelled against the order. Traidenis besieged the castle for a month but failed to capture it. Historiography often claims that the order started the campaign into Lithuania in retaliation for the siege. However, newer research by Edvardas Gudavičius and Artūras Dudonis deny a direct cause and effect relationship between the siege and the campaign, as the siege is dated 1274. They claim that the campaign was a result of a broken peace treaty between Lithuania and Livonia. The peace was concluded so that Traidenis could concentrate on his war with Galicia–Volhynia. Livonia and Lithuania also competed for trade along the Daugava River and for influence in the Principality of Polotsk.

==Campaign and battle==
The Livonian campaign, which opened in February 1279, involved a &quot;chevauchée&quot; into Lithuanian territory.
The Livonian army included men from the Livonian Order, Archbishopric of Riga, Danish Estonia, and local Curonian and Semigallian tribes. At the time of the campaign, Lithuania suffered a famine and Traidenis&#x27; brother Sirputis raided Polish lands around Lublin. The Livonian army reached as far as Kernavė, the center of the Grand Duke&#x27;s lands. They did not meet any open resistance and plundered many villages. On their way home the knights were followed by a small force of Traidenis&#x27; troops. When the enemies approached Aizkraukle, the Grand Master sent most of the local warriors home with their share of loot. At that point the Lithuanians attacked. The Semigallians were one of the first to retreat from the battlefield and the Lithuanians achieved a decisive victory.

==Aftermath==
The order lost its achievements over six preceding years: the Semigallians rebelled once again and submitted to Traidenis for protection. However, Traidenis died ca. 1282 and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania was unable to reap all the benefits. The order decided to elect one grand master with the Teutonic Knights so that any future attacks would be carried out simultaneously from the west and north.

<doc id="1101726" wikidata="Q3132823" url="?curid=1101726" title="Polonaise-Fantaisie (Chopin)">
<text>The Polonaise-Fantaisie in A-flat major, Op. 61, is a composition for piano by Frédéric Chopin. It was dedicated to Mme A. Veyret, written and published in 1846.

This work was slow to gain favour with musicians, due to its harmonic complexity and intricate form. Arthur Hedley was one of the first critics to speak positively of the work, writing in 1947 that it &quot;works on the hearer&#x27;s imagination with a power of suggestion equaled only by the F minor Fantasy or the fourth Ballade&quot;, although Sviatoslav Richter, Arthur Rubinstein, Leff Pouishnoff, Claudio Arrau and Vladimir Horowitz included it in their programs decades earlier.

It is intimately indebted to the polonaise for its metre, much of its rhythm, and some of its melodic character, but the fantaisie is the operative formal paradigm, and Chopin is said to have referred initially to the piece only as a Fantasy. Parallels with the Fantaisie in F minor include the work&#x27;s overall tonality, A-flat, the key of its slower middle section, B major, and the motive of the descending fourth.
Jeffrey Kallberg has suggested that the Polonaise-Fantaisie represents a change in Chopin&#x27;s style from &#x27;late&#x27; to &#x27;last&#x27;. It is suggested that the formal ambiguities of the piece (particularly the unconventional and musically misleading transitions into and out of the lyrical inner section) are the most significant defining qualities of this &#x27;last style&#x27;, which only includes this and one other piece—the F minor Mazurka (Op. 68, No. 4), Chopin&#x27;s last composition.

The piece plays a central role in Sandor Marai&#x27;s novel &quot;Embers&quot;.

<text>Appuldurcombe House (also spelt Appledorecombe or Appledore Combe) is the shell of a large 18th-century English Baroque country house of the Worsley family. The house is situated near to Wroxall on the Isle of Wight, England. It is now managed by English Heritage and is open to the public. A small part of the estate that once surrounded it is still intact, but other features of the estate are still visible in the surrounding farmland and nearby village of Wroxall, including the entrance to the park, the Freemantle Gate, now used only by farm animals and pedestrians.

==History==

Appuldurcombe began as a priory in 1100. It became a convent, then the Elizabethan home of the Leigh family. The large Tudor mansion was bequeathed in 1690 to Sir Robert Worsley, 4th Baronet, who began planning a suitable replacement. Of the existing property, he wrote:
===1702: Baroque mansion===
The present house was begun in 1702. The architect was John James. Sir Robert never saw the house fully completed. He died on 29 July 1747; in his memory a monument was erected overlooking the house on Stenbury Down.

The house was greatly extended in the 1770s by his great-nephew Sir Richard Worsley, 7th Baronet Worsley of Appuldurcombe. The newly extended mansion was where Sir Richard brought his new wife, the 17-year-old Seymour Fleming, whom he married &quot;for love and £80,000&quot;. Capability Brown was commissioned in 1779 to design the ornamental grounds at the same time as the extensions. A romantic ruined folly known as &quot;Cooke’s Castle&quot; was built on the hill opposite to improve the view. During Sir Richard&#x27;s time, the house held a magnificent art collection and was the setting for Sir Richard&#x27;s entertaining of some of the most eminent figures of the age.

Sir Richard&#x27;s marriage quickly fell apart, and the couple&#x27;s only child, a son, died in infancy. After he sued one of his wife&#x27;s rumoured 27 lovers, the couple informally separated. Seymour could not remarry until Richard&#x27;s death, and she became a professional mistress or demimondaine, living off the donations of rich men in order to survive, joining other upper-class women in a similar position in the New Female Coterie. Sir Richard died of apoplexy on 8 August 1805 at Appledurcombe, and was buried at the parish church at Godshill. His title passed to his fourth cousin, Henry Worsley-Holmes, whilst his wife&#x27;s £70,000 jointure () reverted to her, and just over a month later she remarried.

Worsley had left the estate saddled with heavy debts, but Appuldurcombe passed to his niece, Henrietta Anna Maria Charlotte (daughter of John Bridgeman Simpson). She married the Hon. Charles Anderson-Pelham, later first Earl of Yarborough, in 1806. The founder of the Royal Yacht Squadron at Cowes, he made few changes to the house and was quite happy to retain the property as a convenient base for his sailing activities.
In 1855 the estate was sold. An unsuccessful business venture ran Appuldurcombe as a hotel, but with its failure, the house was then leased as Dr Pound&#x27;s Academy for young gentlemen. 
The house was inhabited in 1901–1907 by a hundred Benedictine monks who had been exiled from Solesmes Abbey in France and were shortly to settle at Quarr Abbey on the Isle of Wight.

===Second World War: damage===
Troops were billeted in the house during both world wars, and at the onset of the Second World War the house was taken over by the military. On 7 February 1943, a German Luftwaffe Dornier Do 217 that was engaged in a mine-laying mission turned inland and dropped its final mine very close to the house, before crashing into St Martin&#x27;s Down. The mine exploded, blowing in windows and causing the collapse of part of the roof. The resulting hole in the roof was left unrepaired, and after the war much of the remainder of the roof and the interiors were removed and sold off.

==Present==
Although the house is now mainly a shell, its front section has been re-roofed and glazed, and a small part of the interior recreated. The house has become well known as one of the supposedly most haunted places on the island. There are frequent tales and claimed sightings of ghosts, phantoms and other supernatural phenomena. During the summer holidays, weekly ghost walks are held at Appuldurcombe every Thursday evening.

As of January 2016, Appuldurcombe House and surrounding estate are for sale for £4.75 million.

<text>New Skin for the Old Ceremony, released in 1974, is the fourth studio album by Leonard Cohen. On this album, he begins to evolve away from the rawer sound of his earlier albums, with violas, mandolins, banjos, guitars, percussion and other instruments giving the album a more orchestrated (but nevertheless spare) sound. The album is silver in the UK, but never entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top 200 in the US.

A remastered CD was released in 1995, and in 2009 it was included in &quot;Hallelujah – The Essential Leonard Cohen Album Collection&quot;, an 8-CD box set issued by Sony Music in the Netherlands.

== Cover ==
The original cover art for &quot;New Skin for the Old Ceremony&quot; was an image from the alchemical text &quot;Rosarium philosophorum&quot;. The two winged and crowned beings in sexual embrace caused his U.S. record label, Columbia Records, to print one early edition of the album minus the image substituting instead a photo of Cohen. Another early manifestation of the cover art saw an additional angel wing collage added to cover the depicted figures, presumably to render the image more &quot;decent&quot;.

The image originally came to public attention in C. G. Jung&#x27;s essay &quot;The Psychology of the Transference&quot;, where it is held by Jung to depict the union of psychic opposites in the consciousness of the enlightened saint. The sexual embrace as a symbol for this condition of psychic unity is also found frequently in Tibetan thangkas (sacred paintings).

== Songs ==
&quot;Chelsea Hotel #2&quot; refers to a sexual encounter in the Chelsea Hotel. For some years, when performing this song live, Cohen would tell a story that made it clear that the person about whom he was singing was Janis Joplin. Cohen would eventually come to regret his choice to make people aware that the song was about Joplin, and the graphic detail in which the song describes their brief relationship. In a 1994 broadcast on the BBC, Cohen said it was &quot;an indiscretion for which I&#x27;m very sorry, and if there is some way of apologising to the ghost, I want to apologise now, for having committed that indiscretion.&quot;

In concert, a prolonged &quot;I Tried to Leave You&quot; was sometimes used to introduce the band. The 14-minute rendition from the 1985 Montreux Jazz Festival even featured extra lines given to the backup singers.

&quot;Who by Fire&quot; explicitly relates to Cohen&#x27;s Jewish roots, echoing the words of the Unetanneh Tokef prayer and sung as a duet with Janis Ian (also Jewish; her birth name is Janis Eddy Fink). The song was written after Cohen&#x27;s improvised concerts for Israeli soldiers in Sinai during the Yom Kippur War.

&quot;Leaving Green Sleeves&quot; is a reworking of the 16th-century folk song &quot;Greensleeves&quot;. Cohen retains the chord progression and the words of the first two verses, but changes the melody and takes the latter verses in a different direction than the original. The song, and in turn the album, ends with Cohen violently screaming the chorus as the track fades out.

On December 16, 2010, the Hammer Museum in Los Angeles showcased a series of eleven commissioned art videos inspired by songs from &quot;New Skin for the Old Ceremony.&quot; The project was curated by Lorca Cohen and Darin Klein. The artists participating in the project were Brent Green, Alex da Corte, Wenston Currie, Theo Angell, Christian Holstad, Sylvan and Lily Lanken, &quot;Lucky Dragons,&quot; Kelly Sears, Brett Milspaw, Peter Coffin, and Tina Tyrell. On April 14, 2011, the program screened at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

<doc id="1101742" wikidata="Q191975" url="?curid=1101742" title="Zero page">
<text>The zero page or base page is the block of memory at the very beginning of a computer&#x27;s address space; that is, the page whose starting address is zero. The size of a page depends on the context, and the significance of zero page memory versus higher addressed memory is highly dependent on machine architecture. For example, the Motorola 6800 and MOS Technology 6502 processor families treat the first 256 bytes of memory specially, whereas many other processors do not.

Unlike more modern hardware, in the 1970s computer RAM speed was similar to that of CPUs. Thus it made sense to have few registers and use the main memory as an extended pool of extra registers. In machines with a relatively wide 16-bit address bus and comparatively narrow 8-bit data bus, calculating an address in memory could take several cycles. The zero page&#x27;s one-byte address was smaller and therefore faster to read and calculate than other locations, making the zero page useful for high-performance code.

Zero page addressing now has mostly historical significance, since the developments in integrated circuit technology have made adding more registers to a CPU less expensive and CPU operations much faster than RAM accesses.

== Size ==
The actual size of the zero page in bytes is determined by the microprocessor design and in older designs, is often equal to the largest value that can be referenced by the processor&#x27;s indexing registers. For example, the aforementioned 8-bit processors have 8-bit index registers and a page size of 256 bytes. Therefore, their zero page extends from address 0 to address 255.

== Computers with few CPU registers ==
In early computers, such as the PDP-8, the zero page had a special fast addressing mode, which facilitated its use for temporary storage of data and compensated for the paucity of CPU registers. The PDP-8 had only one register, so zero page addressing was essential. In the original PDP-10 KA-10 models, the available registers are simply the first 16 words, 36-bits long, of main memory. Those locations can be accessed as both registers and memory locations.

Unlike more modern hardware, 1970s-era computer RAM was as fast as the CPU. Thus, it made sense to have few registers and use the main memory as an extended pool of extra registers. In machines with a 16-bit address bus and 8-bit data bus, accessing zero page locations could be faster than accessing other locations. Since zero page locations could be addressed by a single byte, the instructions accessing them could be shorter and hence faster-loading.

For example, the MOS Technology 6502 family has only one general purpose register: the accumulator. To offset this limitation and gain a performance advantage, the 6502 is designed to make special use of the zero page, providing instructions whose operands are eight bits, instead of 16, thus requiring fewer memory fetch cycles. Many instructions are coded differently for zero page and non-zero page addresses; this is called &quot;zero-page addressing&quot; in 6502 terminology (it is called &quot;direct addressing&quot; in Motorola 6800 terminology; the Western Design Center 65C816 also refers to zero page addressing as &quot;direct page addressing&quot;):

 LDA $12 ; zero page addressing
 LDA $0012 ; absolute addressing
In 6502 assembly language, the above two instructions both accomplish the same thing: they load the value of memory location codice_1 into the codice_2 (accumulator) register (codice_3 is Motorola/MOS Technology assembly language notation for a hexadecimal number). However, the first instruction is only two bytes long and requires three clock cycles to complete. The second instruction is three bytes in length and requires four clock cycles to execute.  This difference in execution time could become significant in repetitive code.

Some processors, such as the Motorola 6809 and the aforementioned WDC 65C816, implement a “direct page register” (codice_4) that tells the processor the starting address in RAM of what is considered to be zero page.  In this context, zero page addressing is notional; the actual access would not be to the physical zero page if codice_4 is loaded with some address other than codice_6 (or codice_7 in the case of the 65C816).

== Interrupt vectors ==
Some computer architectures still reserve the beginning of address space for other purposes, though; for instance, Intel x86 systems reserve the first 256 double-words of address space for the interrupt vector table (IVT) if they run in real mode.

A similar technique of using the zero page for hardware related vectors was employed in the ARM architecture. In badly written programs this could lead to &quot;ofla&quot; behaviour, where a program tries to read information from an unintended memory area, and treats executable code as data or vice versa. This is especially problematic if the zero page area is used to store system jump vectors and the firmware is tricked into overwriting them.

== CP/M ==
In 8-bit CP/M, the zero page is used for communication between the running program and the operating system.

== Page addressing ==

In some processor architectures, like that of the Intel 4004 4-bit processor, memory was divided into (256 byte) pages and special precautions had to be taken when the control flow crossed page boundaries, as some machine instructions exhibited different behaviour if located in the last few instructions of a page, so that only few instructions were recommended to jump between pages.

== Null pointers ==
Contrary to the zero page&#x27;s original preferential use, some modern operating systems such as FreeBSD, Linux, Solaris, macOS, and Microsoft Windows actually make the zero page inaccessible to trap uses of null pointers. Such pointer values may legitimately indicate uninitialized values or sentinel nodes, but they do not point to valid objects. Buggy code may try to access an object via a null pointer, and this can be trapped at the operating system level as a memory access violation.
