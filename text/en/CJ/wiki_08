<text>The Ravens were an American R&amp;B vocal group, formed in 1946 by Jimmy Ricks and Warren Suttles. They were one of the most successful and most influential vocal quartets of the period, and had several hits on the R&amp;B chart in the late 1940s and early 1950s.

==Career==
Jimmy &quot;Ricky&quot; Ricks was born in Adrian, Georgia. His mother was 14 when he was born. She went to Florida to find a better job. Jimmy lived with his aunt and uncle, Marnie and Luther Ricks until he was 13 and moved to Jacksonville, Florida to be with his mother. During World War II, Jimmy moved to New York City, where he worked as a waiter in Harlem and met Warren &quot;Birdland&quot; Suttles from Fairfield, Alabama which is southwest of Birmingham, Alabama. In early 1946, they decided to form a vocal group and recruited Leonard &quot;Zeke&quot; Puzey, who had recently won a talent contest at the Apollo Theater, and Ollie Jones. They found a manager, Ben Bart, and an accompanist, Howard Biggs and made their first recordings for Bart&#x27;s small Hub record label. They called themselves the Ravens thus initiating a trend for vocal groups to name themselves after birds—groups who later followed included the Orioles, the Crows, the Larks, the Robins and the Penguins. 

Although the group was strongly influenced by the Ink Spots, the Delta Rhythm Boys, and the Mills Brothers, they used Jimmy Ricks&#x27; bass voice, rather than a more conventional tenor, as the lead on many of their recordings. It became their trademark style. Their material was also more varied, including elements of pop, jazz, R&amp;B, and gospel styles.

After their initial single, &quot;Honey&quot;, Jones left the group and was replaced by Maithe Marshall. The contrast between Ricks&#x27; bass voice and Marshall&#x27;s tenor became integral to their success. In 1947 the Ravens left the Hub label to join National Records, and had immediate hits on what was called at the time the &quot;race records&quot; chart with a version of &quot;Ol&#x27; Man River&quot; (from the musical &quot;Show Boat&quot;) and &quot;Write Me A Letter&quot;, which rose to no. 5 on the &quot;race&quot; chart and crossed over to the pop chart. Their run of successes on what came to be known as the R&amp;B chart continued through to early 1950, with the basic line-up of Ricks, Suttles, Puzey, and Marshall essentially remaining together for several years. Their version of &quot;Count Every Star&quot; (1950) was later used in the film &quot;Revolutionary Road&quot;.

The Ravens primarily existed to showcase bass singer Ricks; they were very successful and Ricks&#x27; voice became the standard against which every rhythm and blues bass was measured for the next generation. Although the group had relatively few chart hits, they were popular in concert, commanding a fee of $2,000 a night. The group recorded for Columbia Records and its subsidiary OKeh in 1950, before moving to the Mercury label. In 1951 Marshall and Puzey both left; Joe Van Loan became a long-term replacement for Marshall as lead tenor, and there were various other shorter-term group members. The group had its final hit on the R&amp;B chart in late 1952, when &quot;Rock Me All Night Long&quot; rose to no. 4, the highest position the group reached in their career.

In 1953 they moved to the Jubilee label, but with the rise of rock and roll their style became increasingly unfashionable. After several earlier breaks from the group, Suttles left for the final time in 1954. Ricks left for a solo career in 1956. After his departure, the group was led by Joe Van Loan, who at one point brought his brothers Paul and James into the group; however, the group finally disbanded in 1958.

Ricks recorded as a solo singer without notable success for a number of labels, including Atlantic where he also recorded with LaVern Baker and Little Esther. In 1971, he and Suttles temporarily revived the Ravens, with additional members Gregory Carroll and Jimmy Breedlove. At the time of his death, at the age of 49 in 1974, he was the vocalist for the Count Basie orchestra. Suttles, Puzey and Marshall also appeared together, with Evans, as the Ravens in 1974. Another reunion was held by the United in Group Harmony Association (UGHA) in 1987. The reunion again featured Suttles, Puzey, and Marshall as well as Jones. As both Ricks and Evans had passed away (in 1974 and 1984 respectively), lead on &quot;Without A Song&quot; was sung by Suttles.
The Ravens were inducted into The Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 1998. In 2006, Suttles accepted the Harlem Jazz &amp; Music Festival 2006 Rhythm &amp; Blues award on the group&#x27;s behalf.

<doc id="1081341" wikidata="Q7314518" url="?curid=1081341" title="Good Humor">
<text>Good Humor is a Good Humor-Breyers brand of ice cream started by Harry Burt in Youngstown, Ohio, United States, in the early 1920s with the Good Humor bar, a chocolate-coated ice cream bar on a stick sold from ice cream trucks and retail outlets. It was a fixture in American popular culture in the 1950s when the company operated up to 2,000 &quot;sales cars&quot;.

==History==

The original Good Humor company started in Youngstown, Ohio, during the early 1920s and covered most of the country by the mid-1930s. In 1961, Good Humor was acquired by Thomas J. Lipton, the U.S. subsidiary of the international Unilever conglomerate. Profits declined when the baby boomers aged and costs increased because of labor issues, gasoline, and insurance. The company sold its fleet in 1978 but continued to distribute its products through grocery stores and independent street vendors. By 1984, Good Humor returned to profitability. Starting in 1989, Unilever expanded Good Humor through its acquisition of Gold Bond Ice Cream, which included the Popsicle brand. Four years later, Unilever bought Isaly Klondike and the Breyers Ice Cream Company. As a result, Good Humor-Breyers is now a large producer of branded ice cream and frozen novelties, as part of the international Unilever Heartbrand.

===1920s: Burt Family and Midland Food ===

In 1919, Christian Nelson, an Iowa store owner, discovered how to coat an ice cream bar with chocolate, inventing the Eskimo Pie. When he heard of the discovery, Harry Burt (1875–1926), owner of a Youngstown, Ohio, ice cream parlor, replicated Nelson&#x27;s product. The story is that Burt&#x27;s 23-year-old daughter Ruth thought that the new novelty was too messy. Burt&#x27;s son, Harry Jr. (1900–1972), suggested using a wooden stick as a convenient handle. They tried out the idea in the store&#x27;s hardening room, where they discovered that the stick formed a strong bond when the ice cream crystallized. Burt outfitted twelve street vending trucks in Youngstown with rudimentary freezers and bells to sell his &quot;Good Humor Ice Cream Suckers&quot; in 1920. The first set of bells was from his son&#x27;s old bobsled. By 1925, Harry Burt Jr. opened a franchise in Miami, Florida.

In January 1922, Burt applied for patents, which were not granted until October 1923 because the patent office thought Good Humors were too similar to Eskimo Pies. The patents were granted only when Burt Jr. traveled to Washington, D.C., with samples to demonstrate the difference. When granted, Good Humor&#x27;s patents were for the equipment and process to manufacture frozen novelties on a stick, but not for the product itself.

During this period, Frank Epperson started marketing frozen ice on a stick and formed the Popsicle Corporation. Six months after Popsicle received its patent in August 1924, Good Humor sued Popsicle Corporation, and by October 1925 the parties settled out of court. Popsicle agreed to pay Good Humor a licence fee to manufacture what was called frozen suckers from ice and sherbet products. Good Humor reserved the right to manufacture these products from ice cream, frozen custard, and the like.

Harry Burt died in 1926, and two years later his widow sold her interest to the Midland Food Products Company, owned by a group of Cleveland businessmen. Midland Food changed the company&#x27;s name to the Good Humor Corporation of America and started selling franchises with a $100 down payment. Cora Burt retained the license agreement with Popsicle. Thomas J. Brimer (1900–1978) purchased the Good Humor franchise for the Detroit territory and by 1929 opened his second plant in Chicago. The mob demanded $5,000 protection money and destroyed part of the Chicago fleet when Brimer refused. The resulting publicity helped put Good Humor on the map.

=== 1930–1961: Meehan Family ===
Brimer&#x27;s father-in-law was a friend of Michael J. Meehan (1891–1948), a controversial New York stock speculator who made a small investment in Brimer&#x27;s operation. When Brimer paid a 25% dividend in 1929, Meehan financed the acquisition of 75% of Good Humor of America for $500,000. Meehan&#x27;s wife, Elizabeth Higgins Meehan, was the registered owner of the stock along with Mrs. John J. Raskob, the wife of another New York stock speculator.

The Meehan family&#x27;s Good Humor Corporation of America operated in New York, Connecticut, New Jersey, Detroit, and Chicago. There were also three major franchises: Good Humor of Baltimore/Washington (operated by the Brimer family), Burt&#x27;s Good Humor (operated by Harry Burt Jr. in Tulsa, Oklahoma), and Good Humor of California. In addition, distributors served Cleveland, Philadelphia, Albany, Dallas and Miami. In 1931, Good Humor reported a net profit of $452,105, almost as much as Meehan paid for the company.

Good Humor was successful because it provided customers an inexpensive diversion during the Depression. In addition to trucks, the company used push carts, bicycles, shoulder boxes, and even a boat. At most branches, the season was six months, April through September. Jobs were scarce and Good Humor found all the employees it could use, despite an 80-hour work week and near-military discipline. Women were not hired as vendors until 1967. A vendor could be fired for not smartly saluting a customer or saying &quot;Good Humor Ice Cream&quot; instead of the proper &quot;Ice Cream Good Humor&quot; as the company regarded the &quot;Good Humor&quot; itself as a noun with &quot;ice cream&quot; being descriptive.
 Vendors attended classes for two days at the beginning of the season and the rules were spelled out in a handbook titled &quot;Making Good at Good Humor&quot;. While vendors were paid commissions only, it was not unusual for a driver to clear the princely sum of over $100 per week.

To promote the product, customers won a free Good Humor if they found &quot;lucky stick&quot; stamped on the stick of their ice cream. One in twelve was a winner. However, in 1939 the Federal Trade Commission outlawed the promotion as an illegal lottery. The company was more successful in attracting favorable publicity by parking trucks outside of motion picture studios. Over the years, Good Humor appeared in over 200 movies. In 1950, Jack Carson starred in the feature motion picture &quot;The Good Humor Man&quot;.

In 1937, Michael Meehan became the first broker banned by the Securities and Exchange Commission for stock manipulation and transferred his enterprises to his sons. Two years later, 21-year-old Joseph A. Meehan (1917–1972) became the youngest broker with a seat on the New York Stock Exchange and chairman of Good Humor Corporation, a position he held until 1961.

After World War II, the company moved into the expanding suburbs to serve the baby boomers. Fifty-five percent of Good Humor&#x27;s customers were age twelve or younger, and trucks now accounted for 90% of the company&#x27;s sales. By 1956, the company&#x27;s fleet grew to 2,000 trucks, all purchased since the war. That year, Meehan hired 32-year-old David J. Mahoney (1923–2000) as president of Good Humor. Mahoney was the head of the advertising firm serving Good Humor and later became the president of the large Norton Simon conglomerate. In his five years at Good Humor, his sales increased by 36%.

By 1960 Good Humor expanded and included 85 different treats: sundaes in chocolate, butterscotch, and strawberry; single-serve cups in apricot and honeydew; and more.

=== 1961–present: Unilever ===
The Meehan family faced estate planning issues because Mrs. Elizabeth H. Meehan was advancing in years. In 1961, they agreed to sell Good Humor of America to Thomas J. Lipton, a subsidiary of Unilever. Lipton also purchased Good Humor of Baltimore/Washington from the Brimer family. In a separate transaction, the other franchises agreed to stop using the Good Humor name. Of the distributors, only Philadelphia survived as a company branch. Lipton created a grocery division to sell Good Humor products in supermarkets.

Mahoney left the company after the acquisition, and Lipton executives soon characterized Good Humor as a &quot;problem&quot;. Much of the fleet purchased after the war was nearing the end of its useful life. As baby boomers matured, sales on many suburban routes declined. While almost from the beginning Good Humor faced competition from companies such as Jack and Jill Ice Cream, Bungalow Bar, etc., it was not until the advent of soft ice cream trucks operated by companies such as Mister Softee that competition impacted sales. Insurance costs increased because courts found ice cream vendors responsible for pedestrian accidents while crossing streets to and from the truck.
Good Humor replaced some of its older conventional trucks with large vans designed to compete with Mister Softee. Many of these &quot;inside sales cars&quot; are still operating. The size of the fleet gradually declined, and by the early 1970s the number of trucks was 1,200. Good Humor also worked with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to equip vending trucks with school bus &quot;stop&quot; swing arms to reduce pedestrian accidents.

Good Humor was unable to solve its labor problems. The company was unionized early in its history and was struck on several occasions. For example, in 1950 the Teamsters shut down Good Humor&#x27;s New York operations for three weeks during the critical month of June. Beginning in the 1950s, the labor pool dried up and Good Humor operated over half of its fleet with seasonal employees, mostly college students. On average, new employees lasted two to three weeks because of the long hours. The entire industry, except Good Humor, stopped using commissioned employees and became distributors who leased trucks to the drivers and sold them their products wholesale. Good Humor adopted this system wherever possible but was prevented from converting most branches because of union contracts.

Good Humor became unprofitable beginning in 1968. An increase in gasoline prices during the early 1970s worsened the situation. After absorbing losses for ten years, in 1978 Good Humor closed its street vending operations and became a distributor. The trucks were sold for $1,000 to $3,000 per vehicle, and many of the former Good Humor vendors became independent business owners. As one reported, &quot;I make sure I shut off the engine when I stop now that I&#x27;m paying for the gas.&quot; Many former competitors also became distributors of Good Humor products.

With the trucks sold, Good Humor focused on the grocery division, and the company returned to profitability by 1984. Unilever, the world&#x27;s largest marketer of ice cream products, decided to achieve a similar market position in the US through acquisitions. In 1989, Unilever purchased Gold Bond Ice Cream of Green Bay, Wisconsin, which owned Popsicle. In 1993, Unilever bought Isaly Klondike, maker of another chocolate-coated ice cream bar invented in Youngstown in the early 1920s. Also in 1993, Unilever acquired the Breyers Ice Cream Company and combined these operations into the renamed Good Humor-Breyers. Since 2000, Good Humor has been one of numerous Unilever ice cream subsidiaries to use the international Heartbrand for its logo. It removed the Heartbrand in 2009 but brought it back as part of its logo from 2014 onwards.

In June 2020, Good Humor collaborated with music producer RZA to create a new jingle for ice cream trucks to play, to replace &quot;Turkey in the Straw&quot;, since that song had been paired in the past with racist lyrics. (Good Humor does not directly operate any trucks, but the company wanted to discourage drivers from playing the song.) The resulting composition was released in August 2020.

== Products ==

In the parlance of the original company, a &quot;Good Humor&quot; was a three-ounce chocolate-coated vanilla ice cream bar on a stick. By 1960, the product line had grown to 85 flavors or combinations. Other &quot;Good Humors&quot; included chocolate-coated chocolate (also called &quot;chocolate malt&quot;) and chocolate-coated strawberry plus bars coated in toasted almond, coconut, chocolate cake, strawberry shortcake, and chocolate éclair. Weekly specials came in a wide assortment of flavors, including a red, white, and blue Good Humor for the Fourth of July. Among the specials that did not become popular were Oregon prune and California fig Good Humors. The company even experimented with tomato sherbet.

==Folklore==
The company&#x27;s history also includes many stories, such as one about a Good Humor vendor rushing a baby to a hospital for treatment and one about the company&#x27;s helping to break up a counterfeit money operation on Long Island. During World War II, a Good Humor truck was assigned to follow one of the armies during maneuvers. The commander could not understand how the opposing artillery was quickly locating his position until he realized that the spotters were using the white Good Humor truck as a guide. Rather than deny his troops ice cream, that night he ordered the truck to be painted army green. After the war, a Good Humor vendor took pity on a youngster who was a nickel short and accepted a new magazine in place of the missing five cents. When he returned the next day, the street was lined with stacks of magazines piled by children eager to exchange periodicals for Good Humors.

<text>Watership Down is a hill or a down at Ecchinswell in the civil parish of Ecchinswell, Sydmonton and Bishops Green in the English county of Hampshire, as part of the Hampshire Downs. It rises fairly steeply on its northern flank (the scarp side), but to the south the slope is much gentler (the dip side). The summit is above sea level, one of the highest points in Hampshire.

The Down is best known as the setting for Richard Adams&#x27; 1972 novel about rabbits, also called &quot;Watership Down&quot;. Atop Watership Down, which is exposed and windswept, lies a Beech tree planted in memory of Richard Adams.

The area is popular with cyclists and walkers. A bridleway, the Wayfarer&#x27;s Walk cross-county footpath, runs along the ridge of the Down which lies at the south-eastern edge of the North Wessex Downs Area of Natural Beauty. Other nearby features include Ladle Hill, on Great Litchfield Down, immediately to the west. Part of the hill is a biological Site of Special Scientific Interest, first notified in 1978. The hill has a partially completed Iron Age hill fort on its summit, and the surrounding area is rich in Iron Age tumuli, enclosures, lynchets and field systems. Further to the west lies Beacon Hill. Watership Down is accessible via the large village of Kingsclere.

Watership Down Stud is a horse-breeding establishment owned by Andrew Lloyd Webber and his wife Madeleine Gurdon, a former eventer, who live nearby at Sydmonton Court.

<doc id="1081343" wikidata="Q7457141" url="?curid=1081343" title="Seven-digit dialing">
<text>Seven-digit dialing is a telephone dialing procedure customary in some territories of the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) for dialing telephone numbers in the same numbering plan area (NPA). NANP telephone numbers consist of ten digits, of which the leading three are the area code. In seven-digit dialing it is not necessary to dial the area code. The procedure is also sometimes known as &quot;local format&quot; or &quot;network format&quot;.

==History==
Originally, telephone exchanges consisted of manual switchboards operated by switchboard operators. Telephone numbers had typically two to four digits, depending on the size of the community. As the number of subscribers grew, multiple exchanges served individual neighborhoods of large cities. Multiple exchanges were identified by a central office name and typically four digits, such as &quot;Pennsylvania 5000&quot;. A rural telephone number, often party line, had often up to four digits and a letter or letter and digits to indicate which of the multiple parties on the line was desired.

Various methods were used to convert these to dialable numbers as dial systems replaced manual switchboards; many moderately-large cities used a 2L-4N format where &quot;ADelaide 1234&quot; would be dialled as AD-1234 (23-1234, a six-digit local call). The four largest cities (New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston) used seven digits. In New York, for example, &quot;PENnsylvania 5000&quot; became PEN-5000 and later PEnnsylvania 6-5000, dialled PE6-5000 or 736–5000). New York used the 3L-4N format from 1920, when dial telephones were first introduced there, until 1930, when it switched to 2L-5N.

The original North American area codes were assigned in 1947 as routing codes for operator calls, but by 1951, the first cross-country Bell System direct distance dial was placed directly from a subscriber station. The system was based on fixed-length numbers; a direct-dial long-distance call consisted of a three-digit area code and a seven-digit local number. Numbers in 2L-4N cities (such as Montréal and Toronto) were systematically lengthened to seven digits in the 1950s, a few exchanges at a time, so that all local numbers were seven digits when direct distance dialling finally came to town.

Exchange prefixes were added to small-town numbers to extend four or five-digit local numbers to the standardised seven-digit length, matching in length the then-longest local numbers in the largest major US markets.

==Structure==
Within the multinational calling area administered by the North American Numbering Plan, telephone numbers are composed of three fixed-length fields: a three-digit numbering plan area (NPA) code (area code), a three-digit (NXX) central office code, and a four-digit (XXXX) station number.

In seven-digit dialing, only the central office code and the station number is dialed, indicating that the call destination is within the local area code. This was the standard in most of North America from the 1950s onward. In some small villages with only one local exchange, it may have been permissible to dial only the four-digit station number. Even after exchange names were introduced, it was possible in many small cities to call local numbers by dialing only the five digits which followed.

A long-distance call within the same area code could often be dialed as 1+7D, without using an area code. The scheme relied on the second digit of an area code being 0–1 and the second digit of a local exchange being 2–9. This dialing plan was incompatible with the introduction of area code 334 and area code 360, and was therefore eliminated by January 1, 1995, in the United States, and by September 1994 in Canada. It was also eliminated as early as 1981 in some numbering plan areas in the United States that had introduced interchangeable central office codes.

Interchangeable central office codes are central office codes (NXXs) which, with a zero or one as the middle digit, resemble and duplicate area codes in the pre-1995 format. They were introduced to postpone area code splits in major cities such as New York City and Los Angeles, but in 1988, AT&amp;T/Bellcore made them mandatory for area codes nearing exhaust of non-interchangeable codes. The Massachusetts 617/508 split was the last one before the policy changed—617 did not yet have interchangeable NXXs at the time. Area codes with interchangeable NXXs had mandatory 10-digit long-distance dialing in order to allow exchanges to distinguish between intra- and inter-area code calls. From 1988 to 1994, few area codes splits were possible due to the dwindling supply of area codes, so conservation measures became necessary.

As of 1995, with the introduction of interchangeable NPA codes, nearly all code combinations are useful as NPAs or as NXXes.

==Office code protection==
Traditionally, identical central office codes in adjacent Numbering Plan Areas (NPAs) would be assigned as far apart from each other as possible, so that callers living near an NPA boundary would not confuse numbers in the adjacent NPAs. Central office code protection made it possible in some low-density areas to use seven digits to reach areas in another area code.

Examples:
* Washington, D.C. (area code 202) to adjacent areas of Maryland (area code 301) and Virginia (area code 703), discontinued on October 1, 1990, to allow assignment of a code in all three area codes.
* Hull from Ottawa (before 2006, as every Ottawa-Hull local number originally was reserved in both area code 613 and 819). This was terminated on 21 October 2006 to allow assignment of a code in both 613 and 819, although five central office codes associated with the federal government were protected in 819 to allow dialing without potentially reaching non-government lines.

==Limitations==
Area code overlay complexes introduced the requirement that calls must include the area code, resulting in a ten-digit dialing. Seven-digit dialing remains possible in some areas of North America with a single area code.

Traditionally, calling from one area code to another, specifically for long-distance calls, requires the caller to dial the trunk digit &quot;1&quot; before the code and number. More recently, with the increasing number and decreasing geographic size of area codes, it is increasingly possible to dial a number in another area code that is not long-distance where such a call does require the area code, but not the trunk digit (initial &quot;1&quot;).

Many modern cellular phones automatically prepend the telephone&#x27;s own area code if the user enters only seven digits, sending a total of ten digits. This is the same case with many landline providers that allow this. And also with many voice-over-IP services, users can configure default handling of seven-digit dialing in a dial plan.

==Timeline==
===Before 1947===
Local telephone numbers were governed by varying local numbering plans based on historical growth of services. Places without dial service often used special party line syntax (e.g., 2-R-48). The largest cities already used seven-digit telephone numbers and had dial service.

===1947 to 1951===
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company (AT&amp;T) announced a nationwide numbering plan in 1947, which divided the United States and Canada into 86 numbering plan areas and assigned a unique area code to each. All area codes had a zero or one as the middle digit. A zero indicated that the state or province was served by a single area code, and a one indicated multiple divisions of a state or province.

Area codes were used as a universal destination routing code to the numbering plan area, and replaced the trunk routing codes that operators previously had to look up at the toll switching centers under the General Toll Switching Plan that was in use since 1929. In Operator Toll Dialing, automated equipment translated area codes to routing information. Systematic conversion of city dial systems commenced to the seven-digit (two-letter-five-number) numbering plan. Central office codes were restricted to the digits &quot;2&quot; to &quot;9&quot; in the middle position, to facilitate machine recognition when an area code was dialed. The same rule already applied to the first digit for technical and historical reasons.

===1951 to 1960===
Direct Distance Dialing (DDD) trials were conducted by the end of 1951, in which subscribers in Englewood, New Jersey, could dial long-distance calls to a select group of remote destinations, as far away as San Francisco, by using an area code.

DDD technology expanded to other major cities, By 1960, it was available in a few places in Canada, as well as most large American cities. This decade is notable for implementation of some thirty more area codes, including in Alaska, Hawaii, and the Caribbean.

===1960 to 1981===
Major progress may be noted in provisioning DDD service. Long-distance billing was computerized in the 1960s to the early 1980s. Few area codes were introduced during this time. Toll-free 800-service was introduced. Service demands in the largest American cities of New York and greater Los Angeles area resulted in the first use of interchangeable central office codes (NXX). All-number calling was implemented, replacing 2L-5N telephone numbers. A very small number of places still did not use a seven-digit numbering plan by 1981.

===1981 to 1994===
New area code assignments were increasing in the 1980s. From 1990 to 1994, all remaining assignable codes entered service. The exhaustion of NXX codes necessitated interchangeable codes in several more area codes. Ten-digit dialing, or 1+10D, was implemented in area codes with interchangeable NXX codes. Protected dialing plans as in national capital areas were discontinued to help meet demand without area code relief. As 1994 neared its end, ten-digit dialing became required throughout the numbering plan in preparation for interchangeable NPA codes.

All local numbers now had seven-digit, as the last technological hold-outs had given way to modern switching technology. The concept of a ten-digit local number was conceived, as New York had an overlay code (917, implemented in 1992), but seven-digit dialing was still the norm.

===1995 to 2019===
Interchangeable NPA codes were introduced in Washington state and Alabama, and some forty new area codes were introduced in 1999 as relief was implemented for pent-up demand. This included two additional toll-free prefixes as the 888 code was quickly exhausted. Since 1999, a more steady rate of area code introductions has taken place, the rate being slower due to one or more factors:
*economic recession
*consumer resistance
*conservation measures or regulatory measures
*pent-up demand being satisfied
*new market entrants leaving the business.

With overlays in several areas (the relief method of choice in Canada since 2000), ten-digit local numbers were supplanting seven-digit dialing; by 2019, only four Canadian area codes (506, 709, 807 and 867) were still single-code areas (no overlay) and allowed seven-digit local dialing. Although fewer American area codes were overlaid, seven-digit dialing was also disappearing in the United States.

===2020 to present===
On July 16, 2020, the FCC adopted rules to establish 988 as the three-digit phone number for the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. This required 82 area codes to switch to mandatory ten-digit dialing by October 24, 2021, because they had already used 988 as a central office code.

Similar transitions are scheduled in most parts of the remaining single-code areas in Canada by May 31, 2023, due in part to the rollout of 9-8-8 service in that country.

<text>Oscar Chisini (14 March 1889 – 10 April 1967) was an Italian mathematician. He introduced the Chisini mean in 1929.

==Biography==
Chisini was born in Bergamo.

In 1929, he founded the &quot;Institute of Mathematics&quot; (&quot;Istituto di Matematica&quot;) at the University of Milan, along with Gian Antonio Maggi and Giulio Vivanti. He then held the position of chairman of the institute from the early 1930s until 1959.

He graduated from the University of Bologna in 1912, having studied under Federigo Enriques. In 1952 he had the appellation &quot;Federigo Enriques&quot; attached to the institute, to commemorate his memory. This name has been maintained by the institute, and by the Department of Mathematics (which it became) since 1982.

He was a major contributor to the Enciclopedia Italiana, and from 1946 to 1967 editor of the journal &quot;Il periodico di matematiche&quot;.

The Chisini conjecture in algebraic geometry is a uniqueness question for morphisms of generic smooth projective surfaces, branched on a cuspidal curve. A special case is the question of the uniqueness of the covering of the projective plane, branched over a generic curve of degree at least five.

Chisini died in Milan in 1967.

<doc id="1081348" wikidata="Q2168119" url="?curid=1081348" title="Combe, Berkshire">
<text>Combe is a village and civil parish in the English county of Berkshire. The parish is situated on the top of the North Hampshire Downs near Walbury Hill and Combe Gibbet, overlooking the village of Inkpen and the valley of the River Kennet. In Walbury Hill, it includes the highest natural point in South East England.

Administratively, the civil parish lies within the unitary authority area of West Berkshire, and within the ceremonial county of Berkshire. Historically part of Hampshire, Combe was transferred to Berkshire in 1895.

==History==
Bronze Age people in this part of Europe constructed communal long barrows to bury their important dead and one is a scheduled monument in the civil parish beneath Gibbet Hill&#x27;s peak. Both male and female bodies of the dead may have been left in the open to be reduced to skeletons by carrion before being collected and buried. In many cases the corpses were carefully assembled with the head to the south, men facing east, women facing west. It is unknown whether this was the case in the so-called Inkpen long barrow (named after the village to the north but within Combe), though it is on an east–west alignment.

==St Swithun&#x27;s Church==

The Church of England parish church of Saint Swithun is Norman, with the nave dating from the second half of the 12th century. The interior has additions from the 17th century, such as the chancel roof. The bell tower is made of wood on flint, and the bell chamber above holds three bells; one pre-reformation, one dated 1616 and one dated 1831. The church is a Grade I listed building.

==Geography==
Combe Hill forms part of the same escarpment as the larger Walbury Hill which is mostly in Combe, in the North Wessex Downs, the highest point in southeast England. Combe has a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) just to the south west of the village, called Combe Wood and Linkenholt Hanging. The civil parish includes the summits of Walbury Hill and Combe Hill, and parts of Inkpen Hill and Pilot Hill. Combe Gibbet stands on Gallows Down, in the civil parish between Inkpen and Walbury Hills.

<doc id="1081351" wikidata="Q1139550" url="?curid=1081351" title="Encyclopædia Iranica">
<text>Encyclopædia Iranica is a project whose goal is to create a comprehensive and authoritative English-language encyclopedia about the history, culture, and civilization of Iranian peoples from prehistory to modern times.

== Scope ==
The &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; is dedicated to the study of Iranian civilization in the wider Middle East, the Caucasus, Southeastern Europe, Central Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. The academic reference work will eventually cover all aspects of Iranian history and culture as well as all Iranian languages and literatures, facilitating the whole range of Iranian studies research from archeology to political sciences. It is a project founded by Ehsan Yarshater in 1973 and currently carried out at Columbia University&#x27;s Center for Iranian Studies. It is considered the standard encyclopedia of the academic discipline of Iranistics.

The scope of the encyclopedia goes beyond modern Iran (also known as &quot;Persia&quot;) and encompasses the entire Iranian cultural sphere, and far beyond. Relations of the Iranian world with other cultures (China, European countries, etc.) are also covered. The project is planning on publishing a total of up to 45 volumes.

== Organization ==
=== Staff ===
Ehsan Yarshater was the founding editor of &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; from 1973 through 2017. The current editor-in-chief is Elton Daniel. The editorial board includes Mohsen Ashtiany, Mahnaz Moazami, and over 40 consulting editors from major international institutions doing research in Iranian studies. Former long tenured editors include Ahmad Ashraf, Christopher Brunner, Habib Borjian, Kioumars Ghereghlou, Manuchehr Kasheff, Dagmar Riedel and Houra Yavari. A growing number (over 1,300 in 2016) of scholars worldwide have contributed articles to &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;.

=== Encyclopædia Iranica Foundation ===
In 1990, Ehsan Yarshater established the Encyclopædia Iranica Foundation (EIF), which serves to promote the cause of the &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; and to ensure its continuation. Over the years, Columbia University&#x27;s Center for Iranian Studies (also founded by Yarshater) continued to coordinate and edit the &quot;Encyclopædia&quot;, while the EIF substantially sponsored the work.

The foundation provides the full text of many entries (up to fascicle XVI/3) for free on the iranicaonline.org website.

=== Legal dispute ===
Following Yarshater&#x27;s retirement as director of the Center for Iranian Studies in 2016, a dispute began to emerge between Columbia University and the EIF as Columbia unilaterally decided to enter into a contract with Brill, an academic publisher, which subsequently published fascicles 4 and 5 of volume XVI in 2018 and 2019; the EIF protested the move. In 2019, Columbia University sued the EIF, seeking, among other things, a finding that the EIF owns neither a copyright nor an exclusive trademark right in the encyclopedia. EIF countersued alleging that Columbia, as well as Brill and Elton Daniel, breached EIF&#x27;s copyright in the encyclopedia, infringed, diluted, and counterfeited its trademarks, converted EIF property, and committed various acts of unjust enrichment and unfair competition. On July 31, 2020, the U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York granted a temporary restraining order against Columbia, Brill and Daniel, enjoining them through October 8, 2020 from publishing additional fascicles. EIF also sought a preliminary injunction against the defendants, but such relief was not entered by the court. Columbia and Brill subsequently published fascicle XVI/6 on October 19, 2020.

As part of the dispute, there are now conflicting accounts as to the current state of the Encyclopædia Iranica. While Columbia has published fascicle XVI/4 through XVI/6, covering topics between &quot;Kešaʾi Dialect&quot; and &quot;Khorasan XIV&quot;, by EIF&#x27;s count volume XVI only covers topics falling alphabetically between KA and KE. EIF considers fascicles XVI/4 through XVI/6 &quot;counterfeit fascicles&quot;.

On June 1st 2023 the Encyclopædia Iranica Foundation and Columbia University settled their lawsuit with undisclosed terms.

== Reception ==
In a review of Volume III, Richard W. Bulliet calls &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; &quot;not just a necessity for Iranists [but] of inestimable value for everyone concerned with the history and culture of the Middle East&quot;. Ali Banuazizi, though, notes that its focus is on Iran &quot;as perceived, analyzed, and described by its most distinguished, mainly Western, students&quot;. In 1998, the journal &quot;Iranian Studies&quot; devoted a double issue (vol. 31, no. 3/4) to reviews of the encyclopædia, coming to 700 pages by 29 authors on as many subjects. Professor A. Banuazizi, praised that the encyclopaedia &quot;will be judged as the most significant contribution of our century to the advancement of Iranian studies as a scholarly enterprise&quot;.

Many foundations, organizations, and individuals have supported &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;. The encyclopaedia has been sponsored since 1979 by the National Endowment for the Humanities, as well as the American Council of Learned Societies, Union Académique Internationale, Iran Heritage Foundation, and many other charitable foundations, philanthropic families and individuals.

On March 25, 2007, the Associated Press released a news report about &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot;, claiming that it is &quot;U.S.-backed&quot;. &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; published an official response, saying the report was &quot;inaccurate and libelous&quot;, that while the National Endowment for the Humanities supports the encyclopedia, the Endowment is &quot;an independent federal agency whose many projects are reviewed and decided upon by independent panels of scholars&quot;, not the U.S. Government, and that only a third of the encyclopedia&#x27;s budget is supplied by the Endowment, not half, as the Associated Press had claimed.

== Volumes ==
As of July 2015, the online version of the &quot;Encyclopædia Iranica&quot; has almost 7,300 entries, of which about 1,100 entries are only available on the Internet. The following is a list of printed volumes, current .

In addition, the following fascicles of volume XVI have been published:
* Fascicle 1 (KASHAN – KAŠŠI, ABU ʿAMR MOḤAMMAD), 2012
* Fascicle 2 (KAŠŠI, ABU ʿAMR MOḤAMMAD – KÉGL, SÁNDOR), 2013
* Fascicle 3 (KÉGL, SÁNDOR – KEŠAʾI Dialect), 2013
* Fascicle 4 (Kešaʾi Dialect – Khavaran-Nama), 2018
* Fascicle 5 (Khavaran-Nama – Khomeini), 2019
* Fascicle 6 (Khomeini – Khorasan XIV), 2020

<doc id="1081355" wikidata="Q595356" url="?curid=1081355" title="Morane-Saulnier N">
<text>The Morane-Saulnier N, also known as the Morane-Saulnier Type N, was a French monoplane fighter aircraft of the First World War. Designed and manufactured by Morane-Saulnier, the Type N entered service in April 1915 with the &quot;Aéronautique Militaire&quot; designated as the MoS-5 C1. It also equipped four squadrons of the Royal Flying Corps, in which it was nicknamed the Bullet, and was operated in limited numbers by the 19th Squadron of the Imperial Russian Air Force.

==Description==

While the Type N was a clean, streamlined aircraft, it was not easy to fly due to a combination of stiff lateral control caused by using wing warping instead of ailerons, sensitive pitch and yaw controls caused by using an all flying tail, and very high landing speed for the period. The Type N mounted a single unsynchronized forward-firing 7.9 mm Hotchkiss machine gun which used the deflector wedges first used on the Morane-Saulnier Type L, in order to fire through the propeller arc. The later I and V types used a .303-in Vickers machine gun.

A large metal &quot;casserolle&quot; spinner, appearing much like those used on the Deperdussin Monocoque pre-war racer of 1912, was designed to streamline the aircraft; but caused the engines to overheat. In 1915, the spinners were removed and the overheating problems disappeared with little loss in performance.

Morane-Saulnier manufactured 49 aircraft but the model was quickly rendered obsolete by the pace of aircraft development at that time.

<text>Am I Blood, formerly named St. Mucus, is a thrash metal band from Kerava, Finland. The band was formed in 1992 with later to be Amorphis frontman Pasi Koskinen, who was originally the singer of the band. They parted ways with Koskinen in 1995, just one month before the recording of debut album &quot;Natural Mutation&quot; under the name St. Mucus. The band is well known (particularly on the internet) for being mistaken for the popular heavy metal band Metallica, who are arguably a strong influence on the band&#x27;s music.

The band began recording their fifth album (and latest to date), &quot;Existence of Trauma&quot;, with a new guitarist and drummer in mid-2008. It was revealed on the band&#x27;s official MySpace blog that lead songwriter and vocalist Janne Kerminen began writing material for the album in early 2007. &quot;The Truth Inside the Dying Sun&quot;, the band&#x27;s fourth album, was made available to download freely at ReverbNation in anticipation of the new album&#x27;s release.

<doc id="1081358" wikidata="Q361239" url="?curid=1081358" title="Carl Eugene Watts">
<text>Carl Eugene Watts (November 7, 1953 – September 21, 2007), also known by his nickname Coral, was an American serial killer dubbed the Sunday Morning Slasher who murdered numerous women and girls over an eight-year period. He is suspected of being the most prolific serial killer in United States history. He died of prostate cancer while serving two sentences of life imprisonment without parole in a Michigan prison for the murders of Helen Dutcher and Gloria Steele.

Watts officially confessed to the murders of 13 women but later claimed he had killed 40 women and also implied that there were more than 80 victims in total. He would not confess outright to having committed these murders, however, because he did not want to be seen as a &quot;mass murderer.&quot; Police consider Watts a suspect in 90 unsolved murders, and he is now suspected to have killed more than 100.

== Early life and criminal history ==
Carl Eugene Watts was born in Killeen, Texas to Richard Eugene Watts and Dorothy Mae Young on November 7, 1953. His father was a private first class in the Army, and his mother was a kindergarten art teacher. They had married in Coalwood, West Virginia. Before Carl was born, in 1942, Richard was transferred to Killeen and assigned to Fort Hood Army Base because it was chosen as the site for the American Army&#x27;s Tank Destroyer Tactical and Firing centre. Three days after his birth, they returned to West Virginia, where they had grown up, and a year later, Sharon, their second child, was born.

Watts&#x27; parents divorced when he was less than 2-years-old due to an unsatisfactory marriage, and his mother raised him. In 1962, Dorothy Mae married Norman Caesar, a mechanic, with whom she had two daughters. The two moved to Inkster, Michigan where she found employment as a high school art teacher. Watts disliked his new stepfather, which made it difficult for him to adapt to his new familial environment. Watts claimed that he was referred to as a &quot;mama&#x27;s boy&quot; and that he often worried about losing his mother&#x27;s attention.

Dorothy Mae, Carl, and Sharon frequently visited Dorothy&#x27;s mother and family in Coalwood, where Dorothy was born and raised. In the rural region near his grandmother&#x27;s home, Carl learnt to hunt and skin rabbits with his grandfather at this time, an activity he really enjoyed. Watts later adopted the nickname &quot;Coral,&quot; which was the southern pronunciation of his name, as a result of Watts&#x27; passion for the southern town and his native cousins. Watts reportedly had academic difficulties in Inkster but yet managed to get decent grades. Watts and his sister contracted meningitis when he was 8-years-old, which nearly killed him and caused him to be held back a year in school. 

Watts was brought to the Herman Kiefer Hospital, where he had to be kept apart from other patients and undergo spinal taps. Journalists claim that Watts&#x27; body temperature was so high that physicians worried it might have caused brain damage. After his illness, his family members also noticed a change in his personality, describing him as bashful, quiet, and introverted. His attention span dropped and he began to suffer from a poor memory. Watts struggled to keep up with other pupils when he returned to school since he had been held back one grade and had experienced chronic sleeplessness as a result of his sickness. Watts started having violent dreams about battling off and killing the wicked spirits of women, which interrupted his sleep cycle. When detectives questioned him about his crimes and asked him why he killed women, he responded that he wanted to &quot;free their spirits&quot; because they had &quot;evil eyes.&quot;

By the time he was 12, according to Watts, he began to relish his sleep-induced fantasies of torturing and killing girls and young women. Teenage Watts started stalking girls at this time, and it is thought that he killed his first victim before the age of 15. He frequently received failing grades in school, and by the age of 16, he could read only at a fourth-grade level. He was severely bullied at school as well. Police were able to identify a 15-year-old Watts as a culprit in the assault on 26-year-old Joan Gave on June 29, 1969. While delivering newspapers on his route, Watts knocked on Gave&#x27;s apartment door. Watts beat Gave when she opened the door and abused her violently. He then continued on his delivery route as if nothing happened. Gave immediately contacted the authorities who apprehended Watts at his home. He was ordered to undergo psychiatric treatment at the Lafayette Clinic in Detroit, a mental hospital.

During a psychiatric evaluation, Watts was asked if his dreams and nightmarish visions disturbed him, he replied, &quot;No, I feel better after I have one,&quot; and claimed that they were not nightmares because &quot;he enjoyed them.&quot; He further elaborated that his motivation for assaulting Gave was because he &quot;just felt like beating someone up.&quot; According to a psychiatric assessment, Watts was revealed to have a mild intellectual disability with an intelligence quotient of 75, and to have a delusional thought process and no evidence of psychosis. However, a police officer interrogating Watts after his arrest later stated that he appeared to be &quot;very, very intelligent&quot; with an &quot;excellent memory.&quot; Also, Watts&#x27; psychiatrist later reported that Watts was an &quot;impulsive individual who has a passive-aggressive orientation to life&quot; and who is &quot;struggling for control of strong homicidal impulses.&quot; He thought Watts posed a threat to society and hoped that the adolescent would benefit from outpatient therapy. He was discharged from the Lafayette Clinic on his 16th birthday and visited the facility nine more times for outpatient care throughout the ensuing years. During his time in various mental institutions, Watts was diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder.

Watts graduated from high school in 1973 at the age of 19, and was given a football scholarship to Lane College in Jackson, Tennessee, despite his subpar grades and sporadic drug use after his release. Watts said that exercising allowed him to let out his suppressed rage. He was able to achieve stardom as a football player and even greater success in boxing, becoming a Golden Gloves fighter. After just three months, he was dismissed from Lane College after being charged with stalking and assaulting women and receiving minor leg injuries. The fact that many people at Lane College thought Watts was a suspect in the violent killing of a female student—even though there was insufficient evidence to hold him accountable for the crime—was another factor in his expulsion. He briefly resided in Houston, Texas following his expulsion, and then spent a year working as a mechanic for a Detroit wheel manufacturer. In 1974, when Watts enrolled in Western Michigan University in Kalamazoo, a string of heinous assaults and attacks on women started to occur.

==Murders==
Watts&#x27; first confirmed murders took place when he was 20 in 1974, by kidnapping his victims from their homes, torturing them, and then murdering them. He attacked in several different jurisdictions and even different states. Most of his victims were 
thin, attractive, white women, and he used methods such as strangulation, stabbing, bludgeoning, and drowning. His victims ranged between the ages of 14 and 44. Watts murdered dozens of women between 1974 and 1982, and despite the many women he murdered, he was not discovered as a serial killer for almost eight years. Even with the advent of DNA testing, it was still nearly impossible to connect them because he rarely performed sexual acts on his victims; his crimes were not thought to be sexually motivated.

On September 6, 1972, Zenaida Tomes, 20, was discovered in a field in Taylor, Michigan, adjacent to North Line Road and Lange Close. She had 45 stab wounds. Over the years, rumors have circulated that Tomes&#x27; death may have been caused by Watts, who was present in the area at the time. However, she was taken from Detroit and murdered somewhere else, which is contradictory with Watts&#x27; known &quot;modus operandi&quot;. Watts may also have been involved in the disappearance of Nadine Jean O&#x27;Dell, who was 16 when she disappeared on August 16, 1974. She was last seen walking down John Daly Street in Inkster, Michigan on her way to babysit at her boyfriend&#x27;s house. Her body has never been found and no one witnessed her presumed abduction.

At 10:45 a.m. on October 25, 1974, Watts knocked on 23-year-old Lenore Knizacky&#x27;s apartment door. Watts called for &quot;Charles,&quot; which was the name of one of his siblings, when she unlocked the door while the door was still chained. When she responded in the negative, she asked if he would like to leave a note, and she undid the chain lock and went to get paper. Watts then attacked Knizacky and choked her into unconsciousness. Police were later alerted by Lenore, but they were unable to find her attacker.

Gloria Steele, 20, was tortured and killed by Watts on October 30, 1974. She attended Western Michigan University and was discovered with a crushed windpipe and 33 chest stab wounds. There were no witnesses other than Diane Williams, an apartment resident manager, who saw a black man &quot;searching for Charles&quot; strolling throughout the complex of apartments. When Watts saw her, he grabbed her, pushed her door open, and dragged Williams inside her apartment. Her phone started to ring as the two were fighting, so she knocked it off the hook and yelled for help. Williams spotted the man getting into a tan Pontiac Grand Prix as she stood up and peered out the window after her attacker fled. The police assembled a line-up, and Williams and Knizacky recognised Watts, who had just been apprehended stealing plywood from the campus of Western Michigan University. For both the Knizacky and Williams cases, he was taken into custody and charged with assault and battery. 

After being diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder and attempting suicide with a length of cord at the Kalamazoo Mental Hospital, Watts was moved to the Center for Forensic Psychiatry in Michigan. When Watts was questioned about the death of Steele in 1975, he acknowledged that he had been nearby the day before Gloria died, but he insisted that he had not killed her despite having admitted to attacking around fifteen other young women. When Detroit police executed a search order at Watts&#x27; residence, they discovered wooden carving tools but no evidence connecting him to Gloria&#x27;s death. He entered a &quot;no contest&quot; plea at his trial for the assault and battery of Knizacky and Williams and was sentenced to a year in the county jail. His psychologists classified him as being extremely hazardous, lacking in remorse for his crimes, impetuous, careless, and emotionally distant, with a high likelihood of recidivism.

Watts returned to Inkster after being released from prison in 1976 and moved in with his mother and stepfather. Watts impregnated Deloris Howard, a childhood friend, in 1979, and the two gave birth to Nakisha Watts. Shortly after, Watts and Deloris split up, and he soon after wed Valeria Goodwill. Goodwill claimed that shortly after their marriage, he started acting oddly. He kept moving the furniture around, using knives to chop up houseplants, broke candles and melted them into the table, and dumped trash all over the floors without picking it up. He would also get up and depart after they had sex or had an &quot;intimate encounter&quot; and would disappear for several hours at a time. Their union only lasted for six months.

Five women were attacked and killed in the Detroit region over the course of a year by a perpetrator who was dubbed by Ann Arbor newspapers as the &quot;Sunday Morning Slasher&quot; since all of the attacks took place on Sunday mornings at around 4 a.m. On October 31, 1979, Jeanne Clyne, a 44-year-old reporter for &quot;Detroit News&quot;, walked home after a doctor&#x27;s appointment, and was attacked. She was approached in broad daylight next to her Grosse Point Farms home on a major suburban road. Eleven stab wounds resulted in her death. Insufficient evidence was discovered by the police to identify a suspect. Detectives initially suspected Jeanne&#x27;s husband, but once Watts admitted to her murder, they ruled him out.

Shirley Small, a 17-year-old high school student from Ann Arbor, Michigan, was fatally stabbed twice in the heart outside her home on April 20, 1980. Glenda Richmond, 26, was the victim of a comparable assault on July 13, 1980, in front of her summer residence in the Ann Arbor region. A diner manager, she sustained 28 knife wounds to her chest. At both crime scenes, there was insufficient evidence to convict anyone. However, both of the murders displayed characteristics of Watts&#x27; crimes. Graduate student Rebecca Huff, 20, of the University of Michigan, was found dead on September 14, 1980, in front of her house. She had suffered about 50 stab wounds. Her case was the first homicide that could be directly attributed to Watts.

On July 31, 1980, 28-year-old Lilli Marlene Dunn was last seen at around 3 a.m. on Agnes Street in Southgate, Michigan. She had left her house at 6:30 p.m. to go bowling, after which she proceeded to a bar on Ford Road in Dearborn, Michigan. She got home at around 2:30 in the morning. An assailant attacked her after she had parked her car in her garage. She was thrown into a light-coloured vehicle while kicking and screaming. Authorities believe Dunn could have been a victim of Watts. It is also believed that Watts killed Malak “Mimi” Haddad, 34, on September 21, 1979. She was found headless in Allen Park, Michigan. Her case is still open, and her head was never found.

A 20-year-old woman named &quot;Dalpe&quot; was attacked and stabbed on October 6 but managed to survive. She ended up with partially paralysed muscles, weak muscles, could hardly eat or move her head, and her arms barely moved over her head due to the deep slashes she sustained to her face, one of which ruptured her jugular vein. On November 1, &quot;Angus,&quot; a 30-year-old woman, spotted a black man wearing a hooded sweatshirt as she was making her way home from a Halloween party. She kept an eye on him. He bent down to tie his shoe as soon as she pulled out her keys and then immediately followed her. She ran to her front door while screaming at the top of her lungs. He was startled by her response, so he turned and fled the other way. She identified Watts from a line-up of photos, but she was not sure because the outside area was dimly lighted at the time of her attack.

Canadian authorities also believe Watts crossed the border into Windsor, Ontario that October, assaulting 20-year-old Sandra Dalpe outside her apartment, leaving her near death with multiple wounds to the face and throat but she survived. By that time, Watts had fallen under scrutiny from local homicide investigators. A task force was organized in July 1980 to probe the Sunday slashings, and Watts was placed under sporadic surveillance; a November court order permitted officers to plant a homing device in his car.

On November 15, in the early morning, two police officers on patrol in the vicinity of Main Street in Ann Arbor saw a suspicious man in a car following a woman who was walking home. She attempted to hide in a doorway after realising she was being followed in the hopes that her stalker would lose her. Watts was detained by the police after they pulled over his automobile for having outdated licence plates and a suspended licence. Additionally, they examined his car and discovered a package containing wood-filing equipment and a few screwdrivers. Their most important discovery, however, was a dictionary that belonged to Huff and had the carved phrase &quot;Rebecca is a lover&quot; on it. It was insufficient proof, though, to hold him responsible for her murder. Watts relocated to Columbus, Texas, in the spring of 1981, where he worked for an oil firm. He spent his weekend nights travelling more than 70 miles to his next hunting ground in the Houston region.

==Arrest and discovery==
Houston General Post Office:
Several women at the G.P.O. were assaulted by Carl Eugene Watts. June Reynolds was bumped in the back of her car by him. She was pregnant at the time. Two other women; Lucia DeStefano, and Karen Koslicky also had some man bothering them on the freeways when they drove home from work. Cheryl Sibolo was assaulted by Carl Eugene Watts on the night of April 14, 1982. When she spotted him in the rear-view mirror while exiting the Federal parking lot. She pulled over immediately in front of the G.P.O. to confront him, exiting her car, yelling very loud and flailing her arms at him with threats to leave her alone or else. He tried to exit his vehicle but Cheryl kept threatening him. He was very scared and got back in his car and so did Cheryl. He drove around her vehicle with a scared look on his face, but it appeared to be a mock look and drove down Franklin Street.Carrie Mae Jefferson was assaulted on April 16, 1982 when Watts accosted outside her home as she was returning from work at the downtown post office.
Watts choked Jefferson into semiconsciousness, threw her into the trunk of her car and drove her to White Oak Bayou as she frantically tried to escape from the vehicle. There he killed her and buried her body, then returned her car to the street where she lived.=\]][

Michele Maday, 20, was assaulted, beaten, and choked in her Houston apartment on May 23, 1982. Her assailant entered her bathroom, filled the tub with water, and drowned her while she was still lying on the floor before departing. Later that day, Melinda Aguilar, 18, and Lori Lister, 21, had their Houston apartment broken into by Watts. He choked Lister down the steps below the apartment while she was returning from work. Then he went inside the apartment and choked Aguilar too. She pretended to be unconscious while Watts wire-tied her hands behind her back.

In order to drown Lister, he hauled her body upstairs and into the bathroom, where he filled the bathtub with water. Aguilar was able to escape while Watts was focused on Lister and leapt out of a window to get assistance. Lister was saved, and Watts was apprehended after evading capture. While Watts was being held, investigators started to connect him to several recent killings of women. However, prosecutors in Texas did not believe they had enough evidence to find Watts guilty of murder.

In May 1982, after the attacks on Aguilar and Lister, Harris County Assistant District Attorney Ira Jones brokered a plea bargain. Watts would only be charged with burglary with intent to murder if he confessed fully to his crimes and received immunity from prosecution on the murder accusations. A 60-year sentence was imposed for this offence. The deal was accepted, and he later led the detectives to the graves of three of his victims. Watts finally acknowledged attacking 19 women, murdering 13 of them. Watts admitted to killing 44-year-old Jeanne Clyne in Detroit in 1979, but he refrained from confessing to the deaths of Richard, Small, or Huff. However, Michigan authorities refused to go in on the deal so the cases in that state remained open.

Linda Tilley, 22, a student at the University of Texas, was drowned in the swimming pool of her apartment complex in September 1981, according to his confession. One week later, he also killed Elizabeth Montgomery, 25, by stabbing her. Susan Wolf, 21, was several steps from her apartment when she was fatally stabbed in the arm and chest while going home after purchasing ice cream from a grocery store. Watts acknowledged another murder from January 1982—that of 27-year-old Phyllis Tamm, who was attacked while jogging. Watts alleged that after choking her with his hands, he tied an elastic strap to a tree branch and hung her there.

Margret Fossi, 25, was murdered by Watts almost two days later. At Rice University, her body was discovered in the trunk of her vehicle. Additionally, Watts said to authorities that on January 16 he later saw Julia Sanchez, a young woman, attempting to fix a flat tire on a motorway. Sanchez was left for dead after Watts sliced her throat. Despite this, she lived. Watts claimed to have assaulted two additional women in the Houston region that same month. Patty Johnson, then 19, was attacked on January 30, 1982, as she exited her car on her way home. Watts slashed her throat in an attempt to kill her. Johnson survived, and up until Watts admitted guilt, another man had received a life sentence for the assault. The second victim Watts cited was &quot;Martell,&quot; a 19-year-old who had been attacked outside of her residence and stabbed three times with a screwdriver but had managed to survive.

Watts also admitted to killing Elena Semander, 20, Emily LaQua, 14, Anna Ledet, 34, Yolanda Garcia, 21, Carrie Jefferson, 32, Suzanne Searles, 25, and Michele Maday, 20, between February and May 1982. Watts was never put on trial for the majority of the murders despite his confessions due to the agreement he made.

==Michigan trial and death==
Watts was sentenced to the agreed 60 years in 1982. However, shortly after he began serving time, the Texas Court of Appeals ruled that he had not been informed that the bathtub and water he attempted to drown Lori Lister in was considered a deadly weapon. The ruling reclassified him as a non-violent felon, making him eligible for early release. At the time, Texas law allowed nonviolent felons to have three days deducted from their sentences for every one day served as long as they were well behaved. Watts was a model prisoner, and had enough time deducted from his sentence that he could have been released as early as May 9, 2006. The law allowing early release was abolished after public outcry but could not be applied retroactively according to the Texas Constitution.

In 2004, Michigan Attorney General Mike Cox went on national television asking for anyone to come forward with information in order to try to convict Watts of murder to ensure he was not released. Joseph Foy of Westland, Michigan, came forward to say that he had seen a man fitting Watts&#x27; description murder Helen Dutcher, a 36-year-old woman who died after being stabbed 12 times on December 1, 1979. Foy identified Watts by his eyes, which he described as being &quot;evil&quot; and devoid of emotion. Although Watts had immunity from prosecution for the 13 killings he had admitted to in Texas, he had no immunity agreement in Michigan. Before his 2004 trial, law enforcement officials asked the trial judge to allow the Texas confessions into evidence, to which he agreed.

Watts was promptly charged with the murder of Helen Dutcher. A Michigan jury convicted him on November 17, 2004, after hearing eyewitness testimony from Joseph Foy. On December 7, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Two days later, authorities in Michigan started making moves to try him for the murder of Western Michigan University student Gloria Steele, who was stabbed to death in 1974. Watts&#x27; trial for the Steele murder began in Kalamazoo, Michigan on July 25, 2007; closing arguments concluded July 26. The following day the jury returned a guilty verdict. Watts was sentenced to life imprisonment without parole on September 13. He was incarcerated at a maximum security prison in Ionia, Michigan. He died of prostate cancer on September 21, 2007, in a Jackson, Michigan hospital.

<doc id="1081366" wikidata="Q4970927" url="?curid=1081366" title="British Rail Derby Lightweight">
<text>The British Rail Derby Lightweight diesel multiple units, were the first such trains to be built en-masse for British Railways. The units were built at BR&#x27;s Derby Works from 1954 to 1955. The units were built in various formations, including 12 power-twin 2-car units, 84 power-trailer 2-car units, four 4-car units, and two single car units.

Body framing was extruded and riveted together. Panelling was welded into continuous sheets and riveted to the frame. Luggage racks were light alloy. The floors had 2 layers of flameproof hardboard, covered with linoleum. To reduce noise and condensation, the inside structure and undersides were sprayed with asbestos. Lighting was by 60-watt, 24-volt lamps charged by belt driven dynamos. Heating was oil fired. Standard mild steel bogies ran on Timken roller bearings.

Contemporaneous with these units was the unique Battery Electric Multiple Unit.

==Operations==
The first units were introduced on services around the West Riding of Yorkshire, namely Leeds to Bradford and Harrogate services from 14 June 1954. Subsequent units were introduced onto services in West Cumbria, Lincolnshire, Norfolk, Newcastle to Middlesbrough, Edinburgh to Glasgow and, later, Birmingham to Sutton Coldfield, Bletchley to Buckingham and Banbury, and East London lines services. They were also the last units to run on the Anglesey Central Railway which closed to public traffic in 1964.

These units were extremely successful, helping to reduce the operating costs of branchlines and also attracting many more passengers when new. They carried 800,000 more passengers on the London Midland Region between February and October 1956 than steam did in the same period of 1955. The largest increase was 434% (4,772 passengers) on the Buckingham-Banbury line (from 13 August), followed by Birmingham-Lichfield 178% (from 5 March), Bury-Bacup 152% (from 6 February), Llandudno-Blaenau Ffestiniog 39% (from 5 March) and Manchester-Buxton 38% (from 8 October). 

Due to their success, British Railways ordered many more DMU vehicles from various builders over the next decade, thus helping to eliminate steam locomotives. However, as these units were non-standard compared to other later DMU vehicles, they were subject to early retirement. The last units were withdrawn from normal traffic in 1969.

==Formations==
Four different sorts of formation were created from the 217 cars built of this type, as follows:

===Power Twins===
===Power Trailers===
===Four Car Units===
===Single Car Units===
79683 was left over as a spare DTCL, and took the place of 79649 in 1957, when this was converted into a special saloon on diagram 565. It was later renumbered 999510 in the departmental saloon series and was eventually scrapped in 1981.

In 1962 three of the power twin units were converted to power trailer units, when 79191–79193 were rebuilt as DTCL vehicles and renumbered 79633–79635.

==Powertrain==

===Power Twins 79000+79500 to 79007+79507===
* Engine: Two BUT (Leyland) 125 bhp
* Transmission: Hydraulic, Lysholm-Smith (Leyland) torque converter
* Coupling code: Red triangle

===Remainder of the fleet===
* Engine: Two BUT (AEC) 150 bhp
* Transmission: Mechanical
* Coupling code: Yellow diamond

==Departmental Use==
A number of cars from these units were subsequently transferred to departmental (non-revenue earning) use after withdrawal from normal service:
* 79018 + 79612 were rebuilt as an ultrasonic test train based at Reading, numbered 975007 + 975008. Replaced by unit 901001.
* 79900 was rebuilt as test coach &quot;Iris&quot;, based at Bletchley, numbered 975010. Later transferred to the BR Research Division at the Railway Technical Centre at Derby, for its last few years in traffic, it was repainted into original BR Green livery. Replaced by unit 901002.
* 79185 was taken into departmental use for brake trials, numbered 975012. It was scrapped in 1970.
* 79250 and 79252 were taken into departmental use as staff messrooms, numbered 975013 and 975014. They were scrapped in 1978 and 1982 respectively.
* 79649, the inspection saloon mentioned above, took its place in the departmental series as 999510.

==Preservation==
Thanks to their extended life in departmental service, one 2-car unit and a single car unit survive in preservation on the Ecclesbourne Valley Railway, the former following a high-profile campaign.

<doc id="1081368" wikidata="Q7620895" url="?curid=1081368" title="Stradbroke Island">
<text>Stradbroke Island, also known as Minjerribah, was a large sand island that formed much of the eastern side of Moreton Bay near Brisbane, Queensland until the late 19th century. Today the island is split into two islands: North Stradbroke Island and South Stradbroke Island, separated by the Jumpinpin Channel.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the Stradbroke Island was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as a &quot;Natural attraction&quot;.

==Indigenous history==
Archaeological evidence suggests the Quandamooka, an Aboriginal Australian people, lived on the island for at least 21,000 years prior to European settlement. It was also a traditional meeting place of Quandamooka peoples such as the Nunukul and Goenpul. A 1964 survey found 121 pre-European dwelling sites with evidence of substantial wooden huts.

Jandai (also known as Janday, Jandewal, Djendewal, Jundai, Goenpul and Jandawal) is one of the Aboriginal languages spoken on Stradbroke Island.

==European settlement==

There are persistent stories of a 17th-century Spanish shipwreck known locally as the &quot;Stradbroke Island Galleon&quot;. There exists a body of Aboriginal oral history that may bear on some such incident, and several artefacts have been found in the sand dunes, including an English silver coin from 1597 and the blade of a 17th-century Spanish rapier. The evidence however is not conclusive.

Captain James Cook made the first documented European sighting of the island in 1770 and named Point Lookout, but did not land. The first historically documented contact between Europeans and the local Aborigines was 1803 when Matthew Flinders landed in search of fresh water. The next documented contact was between shipwreck survivors Thomas Pamphlett, Richard Parsons and John Finnegan landed on Moreton Island in April 1823, before being taken to Stradbroke Island by the natives where they were helped and provided with food, shelter and a canoe by the local Aborigines.

Initial white settlement of Stradbroke Island was at Amity Point where a pilot station was established in 1825. More fertile soil, good sources of fresh water and a better harbour was found at the present location of Dunwich so settlement soon concentrated there. Dunwich became a staging point where larger ships were unloaded of cargo which was placed into smaller vessels to be carried over the sand bars of Brisbane River and up to the penal settlement of Brisbane. The Dunwich settlement was in close proximity to a major Aboriginal camp at Myora Spring. Whites and Europeans generally lived in reasonable harmony though there were moments of conflict as would be expected within the context of two very different cultures meeting for the first time.

Early efforts to establish agriculture on the island, especially plans to grow cotton north of Dunwich, resulted in conflicts with the local Aboriginal people, the Ngugi tribe of the Quandamooka people. In March 1830, the 57th regiment seeking reprisals for the murder of a guard, attacked a group of Ngugi people near a lagoon on Moreton Island. This was likely the first significant massacre of indigenous people in the region.

In 1843 the first Catholic mission for Aboriginal people was established on Stradbroke Island by Archbishop Polding, a Passionist priest, who visited and chose the site. It was unsuccessful because of poor relations with the local tribes and lack of resources, and the missionaries withdrew in 1847.

A quarantine station was established at the northern end of the island in July 1850. This was due to its proximity to the shipping route, its isolation and to there being a supply of fresh water available.

On 2 February 1887 the barque &quot;Scottish Prince&quot; ran aground on the southern end of Stradbroke Island. Three tug boats were dispatched to try to pull the vessel free, but this did not succeed. All of the passengers and crew were rescued but the cargo was remained onboard until the ship broke apart and its goods were washed ashore. Parts of the wreck can still be found in shallow water approximately offshore south of the Southport Spit and it is a popular diving site. Since 2013, sand movement has resulted in increasing amounts of the wreck becoming visible.

Myora Mission, initially run by the Queensland Aboriginal Protection Association from 1892 and from 1896 by the Queensland Government as an Aboriginal reserve and &quot;industrial and reform school&quot;, was used as a source of cheap labour, and eventually closed in 1943.

==Island division==
In September 1894, heavy seas drove aground the barque &quot;Cambus Wallace&quot; at a narrow isthmus roughly halfway down the island&#x27;s length. Salvage activity (including the detonation of a cargo of explosives) weakened the sand dunes along the spit such that by the spring of 1896, storms and tides had washed a permanent breach from Moreton Bay to the Coral Sea.

The island is now two islands separated by the Jumpinpin Channel:

*North Stradbroke Island is the larger of the two, about 38 km long and up to 11 km wide.
*South Stradbroke Island is about 22 km long and at most 2 km wide.

North Stradbroke is the more developed of the two islands, with the three small townships of Dunwich, Amity Point and Point Lookout offering vacation rentals, shops and a range of eateries. It also has a sealed, bitumen road network.

South Stradbroke, while less developed, has a number of anchorages, campsites, and two major tourist resorts, Couran Cove and South Stradbroke Island Resort, or Tipplers. There are almost no sealed roads on the island.

== In popular culture ==
The 2015 novel &quot;Ghost Galleon&quot; by Errol Bishop is based on the legend of the &quot;Stradbroke Island Galleon.&quot; Bishop became aware of the legend while the principal of Macleay Island State School in Moreton Bay.

<text>Turnham Green () is a London Underground station in Chiswick of the London Borough of Hounslow, west London. The station is served by the District and Piccadilly lines in a manner of cross-platform interchange although Piccadilly line trains normally stop at the station only at the beginning and end of the day, running through non-stop at other times. To the east, District line trains stop at and Piccadilly line trains stop at . To the west, District line trains run to either or and Piccadilly line trains stop at . The station is in both Travelcard Zone 2 and Zone 3.

The station is located on Turnham Green Terrace (B491) on the eastern edge of Chiswick Common. It is about north of Chiswick High Road (A315), and as well as Central Chiswick the station serves the Bedford Park area. The actual Turnham Green park is much closer to Chiswick Park station.

==History==
The station is located close to the site of the Battle of Turnham Green (1642), during the First English Civil War.

===District line===

Turnham Green station was opened on 1 January 1869 by the London and South Western Railway (L&amp;SWR) on a new branch line to built from the West London Joint Railway starting north of Addison Road station (now ). The line ran through Shepherd&#x27;s Bush and Hammersmith via a now unused curve and initially the next station towards central London was Grove Road station in Hammersmith (also now closed).

Between 1 June 1870 and 31 October 1870 the Great Western Railway (GWR) briefly ran services from to Richmond via the Hammersmith &amp; City Railway (now the Hammersmith &amp; City line) tracks to Grove Road then on the L&amp;SWR tracks through Turnham Green.

On 1 June 1877, the District Railway (DR, now the District line) opened a short extension from its terminus at Hammersmith to connect to the L&amp;SWR tracks east of station (which had opened in 1873). The DR then began running trains over the L&amp;SWR tracks to Richmond. On 1 October 1877, the Metropolitan Railway (MR, now the Metropolitan line) restarted the GWR&#x27;s former service to Richmond via Grove Road station.

On 5 May 1878 the Midland Railway began running a circuitous service known as the Super Outer Circle from to via and . It operated over a now disused connection between the North London Railway and the L&amp;SWR Richmond branch. The service was not a success and was ended on 30 September 1880.

The DR&#x27;s service between Richmond, Hammersmith and central London was more direct than either the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s or the MR&#x27;s routes via Grove Road station or the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s other route from Richmond via . The success of the DR&#x27;s operations led it, on 1 July 1879, to open a branch from Turnham Green to .

From 1 January 1894, the GWR began sharing the MR&#x27;s Richmond service and served Turnham Green once again, meaning that passengers from Turnham Green could travel on the services of four operators.

Following the electrification of the DR&#x27;s own tracks north of Acton Town in 1903, the DR funded the electrification of the tracks through Turnham Green. The tracks between Acton Town and central London were electrified on 1 July 1905 and those on the Richmond branch on 1 August 1905. Whilst DR services were operated with electric trains, the L&amp;SWR, GWR and MR services continued to be steam hauled.

MR services were withdrawn on 31 December 1906 and GWR services were withdrawn on 31 December 1910 leaving operations at Turnham Green to the DR (by then known as the District Railway) and L&amp;SWR. The L&amp;SWR constructed an additional pair of non-electrified tracks between Turnham Green and its junction with the District at Hammersmith and opened these on 3 December 1911 although their use was short-lived as the District&#x27;s trains out-competed the L&amp;SWR&#x27;s to the extent that the L&amp;SWR withdrew its service between Richmond and Addison Road on 3 June 1916, leaving the District as the sole operator.

In 1913, the Central London Railway (now the Central line) obtained parliamentary approval for an extension to Richmond. This would have had a deep-level station at Turnham Green. The stations each side would have been at Heathfield Terrace and Emlyn Road. The plan was delayed by the First World War and an alternative route was adopted in 1920, which was not progressed.

===Piccadilly line===
In the early 1930s, the London Electric Railway, precursor of the London Underground and owner of the District and Piccadilly lines, began the reconstruction of the tracks between and to enable the Piccadilly line to be extended from Hammersmith to and (then the terminus of what is now the Heathrow branch). Express non-stop tracks were provided for the Piccadilly line between the stopping lines of the District line. Services on the Piccadilly line began running through Turnham Green on 4 July 1932.

To provide a better interchange with the Richmond branch of the District line, Piccadilly line trains began stopping at Turnham Green station in the early mornings (from the first train until 06:50 Monday to Saturday, 07:45 on Sunday) and late evenings (from 22:30 until the last train) only from 23 June 1963. During the rest of the day they run non-stop through the station as before. Local residents have been campaigning for more Piccadilly line trains to stop at Turnham Green with trains only stopping in the event of delays to the District line whereby large numbers of passengers are left waiting on the platform or occasionally while scheduled maintenance work is carried out.

However, in December 2013, it was announced that Turnham Green will be made a permanent stop on the Piccadilly line once the line has been upgraded, with work scheduled to commence in 2019 and introduction of the first new train in 2022. A consultation published in January 2014, concluded that the business case would currently have an overall negative impact on business across London from introducing increased stopping at Turnham Green, but did outline the future plans to do so when upgrades had taken place, with passengers benefiting from improvements to the District line and the Night Tube (on Friday and Saturday nights, beginning with the Jubilee, Victoria, Central, Northern and most of the Piccadilly line, then expanding across other lines in subsequent years) from Autumn 2015 in the interim, giving the following conclusion:

&quot;However, we recognise the continued frustration among those who wish for the Piccadilly line to stop for more of the day at Turnham Green station. The signalling constraints and the size of the train fleet mean that we are unlikely to be able to implement changes in the short term. TfL therefore plans to stop Piccadilly line trains at Turnham Green station all day once the line is modernised and we have a new and larger fleet of trains and a new signalling system. This upgrade is set to commence in 2019 with introduction of the first new train in 2022.&quot;

&quot;In the interim, passengers using Turnham Green station will benefit from the upgrade of the District line. The introduction of a fleet of new larger and walk-through, air-conditioned trains will start this year and be complete by 2016. This will be followed by a new signalling system enabling a faster, more frequent and more reliable service from 2018.&quot;

&quot;Additionally, the Piccadilly line will stop throughout the night at Turnham Green when the Night Tube network starts in 2015.&quot;
However this upgrade was suspended indefinitely due to a lack of funding because of the Covid-19 pandemic.

==The station today==

There is a newsagent near the ticket hall. There are four ticket barriers and a gate that control access to all platforms. Refurbishment work in the station was completed in 2006.

<doc id="1081382" wikidata="Q450396" url="?curid=1081382" title="Reginald Warneford">
<text>Reginald Alexander John Warneford, VC (15 October 1891 – 17 June 1915), also known as Rex Warneford, was a British aviator and Royal Naval Air Service officer who received the Victoria Cross for air-bombing a Zeppelin during the First World War. It was the first victory of a heavier-than-air aircraft over a lighter-than-air dirigible.

==Early life==
Warneford was born in Darjeeling, India, the son of an engineer on the Indian Railways. He was brought to England as a small boy and educated at King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon but after his family returned to India he continued his education at the English College, Simla. Following apprenticeship in the Merchant Marine, Warneford joined the British-India Steam Navigation Company. 

At the outbreak of the First World War, he was in Canada awaiting return to India. Instead, he sailed to Britain and joined the 24th (Service) Battalion (2nd Sportsman&#x27;s), Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment), but soon transferred to the Royal Naval Air Service for pilot training.

==Service==
Warneford&#x27;s initial training took place at Hendon, passing then to Upavon in Wiltshire where he completed his pilot training on 25 February 1915. During the course of training, the Commander of Naval Air Stations, R. M. Groves was quoted as saying: &quot;This youngster will either do big things or kill himself.&quot; Warneford&#x27;s flying instructor at the time, Warren Merriam, noted his skills as a pilot but had to make special arrangements to ensure that Warneford&#x27;s perceived over-confidence did not bar him from attaining a commission. Merriam took an opportunity whilst Commander Groves was visiting Hendon to ask Warneford to demonstrate his flying skills. Groves&#x27; favourable impression overcame the views of the Squadron Commander at the time who believed that Warneford would never make an officer because of his lack of discipline.

Warneford was initially posted to 2 Wing on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent but was quickly (7 May 1915) posted to an operational unit with 1 Wing at Veurne on the Belgian coast. Over the next few weeks, Warneford was involved in attacks on German troops and guns, as well as actions against enemy aircraft. His aggressiveness and effectiveness led to his being given his own aircraft and a roving commission. On 17 May 1915, Warneford encountered a &quot;Deutsches Heer&quot;-flown Zeppelin airship, LZ 39, setting out on a raid over the UK. He attacked LZ 39 with machine gun fire but the airship was able to ascend out of range by jettisoning ballast.
On 7 June 1915 at Ghent, Belgium, Warneford, flying a Morane-Saulnier Type L, attacked another German Army airship, LZ 37. He chased the airship from the coast near Ostend and, despite its defensive machine-gun fire, succeeded in dropping his six Hale bombs on it, the last of which set the airship on fire. LZ 37 subsequently crashed into a convent school in Sint-Amandsberg (), Ghent, killing two nuns, the commander of LZ 37, Oberleutnant , and seven members of the crew. 

The explosion overturned Warneford&#x27;s aircraft and stopped its engine, forcing Warneford to land behind enemy lines. After 35 minutes spent on repairs he managed to restart the engine just as the Germans realised what was going on, and after yelling &quot;Give my regards to the Kaiser!&quot;, he was able to take off and returned to base.

On 17 June 1915, Warneford received the award of Légion d&#x27;honneur from the French Army Commander in Chief, General Joffre. Following a celebratory lunch, Warneford travelled to the aerodrome at Buc in order to ferry an aircraft for delivery to the RNAS at Veurne. Having made one short test flight, he then flew a second flight, carrying an American journalist, Henry Beach Needham, as passenger. During a climb to 200 feet, the right-hand wings collapsed, leading to a catastrophic failure of the airframe. Accounts suggest that neither occupant was harnessed, and both were thrown out of the aircraft, suffering fatal injuries. For Needham, death was instantaneous. Warneford died of his injuries on the way to hospital. He was buried at Brompton Cemetery, London on 21 June 1915 in a ceremony attended by thousands of mourners. The grave lies in front of the eastern colonnade.

His Victoria Cross is displayed at the Fleet Air Arm Museum in Yeovil, Somerset, England. A street in Ghent was named &quot;Reginald Warnefordstreet&quot; on the spot where the airship crashed. In 2016 a road was named in his memory, Warneford Crescent in Longhedge, Salisbury. 

Wareneford was commemorated in music by Howard Ellis Carr in the final movement of his &quot;Three Heroes&quot; suite, which includes a musical depiction of a Zeppelin air raid. The suite became popular after the war, and was performed quite regularly, including at Hastings in 1921 and at The Proms in 1918, 1920 and 1924.

== Legacy ==
In 1921, a house at his school, King Edward VI School, Stratford-upon-Avon, was named after him. However, just 3 years later the houses were changed to commemorate the 2 benefactors of the school, guild and king&#x27;s . In 2000 the houses were changed once again and Warneford was represented by the colour green once again.

<doc id="1081383" wikidata="Q4354400" url="?curid=1081383" title="Yealmpton">
<text>Yealmpton () is a village and civil parish in the English county of Devon. It is located in the South Hams on the A379 Plymouth to Kingsbridge road and is about from Plymouth. Its name derives from the River Yealm that flows through the village. At the 2001 census, it had a population of 1,923, falling to 1,677 at the 2011 census. There is an electoral ward of the same name. The population of this ward in 2011 was 2,049.

Yealmpton is home to a 400-year-old stone cottage, where it is said a version of the famous rhyme Old Mother Hubbard was written. It is also the site of Kitley Caves, including the now closed Kitley Show Cave, where green marble was quarried; there is an arch of it in the British Museum. John Pollexfen Bastard (1756–1816) a British Tory politician, landowner and colonel of the East Devonshire Militia, lived at Kitley House, Yealmpton.

==Parish church==
The parish church is dedicated to St Bartholomew and was designed by William Butterfield. It dates from 1850, apart from the tower which was only built in 1915. It is in a version of the Gothic of the late 13th and early 14th century. The font is Norman and the monuments (moved here from the old church) include a brass to Sir John Crocker (1508), one to Mary Coppelston (died 1630) (an arched recess with kneeling figures against the tomb-chest), and several to members of the Bastard family.

==Historic estates==
The parish contains several historic estates including:

===Lyneham===

Lyneham was, After &quot;Hele&quot; the second earliest known home of the Crocker family, one of the most ancient in Devon according to &quot;that old saw often used among us in discourse&quot;, the traditional rhyme related by Prince (d.1723):

&quot;Crocker, Cruwys, and Coplestone&quot;,
 &quot;When the Conqueror came were at home&quot; 

:The last male of the Crocker family of Lyneham was Courtenay Crocker (d.1740), several times MP for Plympton. The Cruwys family in 2014 still resides in its ancient manor house at Cruwys Morchard where, despite the traditional rhyme, it is first recorded in the reign of King John (1199-1216), or possibly a little earlier. The senior branch of the Copleston family died out in the male line in 1632, but the Coplestons of Bowden survived a further century until the death without progeny of Thomas Copleston (1688-1748), MP, whose heirs in 1753 sold Bowden to William Pollexfen Bastard of Kitley.

===Kitley===

Kitley house is the former home of the Pollexfen family, who also had a residence at Mothecombe in Holbeton.

===Bowden===
Bowden, seat of a junior branch of the Coplestone family of Copleston in the parish of Colebrooke. It was first the home of Walter Copleston, 3rd son of John II Copleston (d.1457) of Copleston, thrice MP for Devon, by his wife Elizabeth Hawley (d.1447). Thomas Coplestone (1688-1748) of Bowden was MP for Callington in Cornwall.

== Railway service ==
From 1898 to 1960, Yealmpton was the terminus of the Yealmpton to Plymouth branch railway line. The line was built by the Great Western Railway. In its early days the line carried passengers and freight. The growth in the number of motor cars and buses led to reducing passenger traffic in the 1920s and passenger services ceased on the line in 1930. From then until 1941, only freight traffic ran on the line.
Passenger services were restored in 1941, as villages such as Yealmpton were then being used as dormitory areas by the people of Plymouth following the severe air raids on the city. The passenger services ceased again in October 1947 and freight services only ran until 1960, when the line closed completely. The station at Yealmpton was demolished and housing in Riverside Walk now stands on the site.

== Agricultural Show ==
Known as one of the best one day shows in the region, 2008 marked the 121st Agricultural Show. Despite the weather, thousands turned up to enjoy the best of what the Devon countryside had to offer. Highlights included the Royal Horse Artillery parading and firing their guns as well as the M.A.D mountain bike display team.

<doc id="1081402" wikidata="Q3087306" url="?curid=1081402" title="Freebox">
<text>The Freebox is an ADSL-VDSL-FTTH modem and a set-top box that the French Internet service provider named Free (part of the Iliad group) provides to its DSL-FTTH subscribers.

Its main use is as a high-end fixed and wireless modem (802.11g MIMO), but it also allows Free to offer additional services over ADSL, such as IPTV including high definition (1080p), Video recording with timeshifting capabilities, digital radio and VoIP telephone service via one RJ-11 connector (the first version came with 2 such jacks but only one was ever activated)

The Freebox is provided free to the subscribers, its value being 190 Euros, according to the operator. It is delivered with a remote control, a multimedia box equipped with a 250 GB hard drive, and accessories (cables and filters). At the end of Q2 2005, more than 1.1 million subscribers were equipped with the Freebox. According to company official&#x27;s results publication, the 2 million level of Freeboxes were reached in September 2006.

==V6 generation, Freebox Révolution==
The sixth generation device is called the Freebox Révolution or V6 (Version 6). It was launched in early 2011. It is composed of a pair of devices: the ADSL modem/router and the IPTV set top box/media player. The boxes were designed by Philippe Starck.

===The Freebox Server device===
The Freebox server is a DSL modem, a router, a Wi-Fi hot spot, a NAS (250 GB hard drive), a DECT base with up to 8 connected DECT phone sets, and a digital video recorder for TNT also known as DVB-T and IPTV. As the firmware is updated, its functionalities increase. Most notably:
* An external hard drive can be connected to its USB and/or eSATA port. However, some TV channels cannot be recorded to an external hard drive due to copyright policy limitations. Such limitations do not apply to channels recorded from TNT.
* The video formats supported are quite wide in range including mp4, H264, mp2, mkv, avi and others. Some formats are not supported though firmware updates may increase the number of readable file formats.
* The server automatically detects local network file shares through UPnP and can read videos from any computer on the local network.
* The server&#x27;s hard drive is available from the local network to Macintosh, Linux, and Windows computers. It can be made available from the WAN. 
* IPTV is available in real-time to any computer on the local network, if the bandwidth is sufficient and the number of simultaneous channels does not exceed 2. However, some channels are not available (most of those that cannot be recorded on an external hard drive).
* The DSL modem router can be configured either as an Ethernet router or a simple DSL modem (bridge mode).
* The server handles 3 Wi-Fi networks: a private Wi-Fi network (possibly hidden) and a so-called &quot;FreeWifi&quot; network which creates a hotspot and allows any other Freebox customer in proximity to connect to the Internet, after entering their Free user name and password, and a hidden network dedicated to IPTV for the Freebox HD (v5) video box if you choose to link this via Wi-Fi.
* The server can be managed through its built-in Web server. Also, TV recordings can be managed from the WAN.
* Because of the changes in the hardware and capabilities, the monthly fee (initially €29.99 including the XDSL line) is now only for the services, a separate cost of €6 is added for XDSL line access, free if you have ADSL over an active POTS (monthly fee €16), but this increase includes modifications in the services fee (see below). It now includes:
** Free calls to any mobile phone in France.
** Calls to landline phones in France and 104 countries, as was already included before.
** Free calls to any phone in France from any Internet connection worldwide.
** Renting the Freebox Revolution Server and its TV box.
** IPTV is now an option (€1.99) so people who are not eligible for such services (i.e. their home is too far away from the DSLAM) do not pay for it, but, as a legal twist, after an increase in VAT in order to reduce the basis of taxes for artistic creation.
* The server can act as a DECT base station for up to 8 DECT handsets.
* The server supports SIP for VoIP phone calls. It allows subscribers to use their smartphone or a dedicated VoIP phone to make calls at Freebox rates instead of using the cellular network.
* The server can use an optical fiber network where available.
* The server is now compatible with Apple&#x27;s AirPlay and Time Machine technologies (firmware 1.1.0, August 2011).
* A catch-up TV service which covers 33 channels over the past 7 days. This service is proposed in high quality compared to its internet-based counterpart.

===The Freebox Player===
The Freebox Player is the set-top box part of the &quot;Freebox Revolution&quot; offer. It is connected to the Freebox Server via PLC or by a direct Ethernet cable if both devices are close enough. It is possible to rent another Freebox Player if one wants to connect another TV set in another room.

The Freebox Player device has:
* One Blu-ray/DVD player (Blu-ray playback requires HDMI connection) and an optical sound output.
* One USB (on the front) and one eSata plug to connect hard drives (or a joystick or keyboard for the USB part).
* One DVB-T plug. By contrast with TV over DSL, DNV programs can be recorded to the Freebox Server or to a local hard drive with no restriction about accessing it from a computer.
* One remote control. By contrast with most concurrent devices, the remote control uses Zigbee (standardized power saving low rate low power radio wave) instead of infrared.
* The Freebox player can be controlled from a smartphone or a computer, or an iPad app.
* Every external device connected to the Freebox player is available to that device only but the devices connected to the Freebox Server are available to every Freebox player connected.
* The player can access Internet and e-mail with no computer connected, using either the remote control (which includes gyroscopic control) or from a USB keyboard (not included).
* Games are available from the Free-Store. A USB gamepad is included.
* You can plug in a USB memory stick with photos or music files and watch/play them.

=== Serving Files to the Freebox Player ===
The Freebox Player can access audio/video files on any local computer through UPnP AV. External subtitle files (.srt) should be first be merged with the video file in Matroska format, e.g. with mkvmerge.

==V5 generation==
The Freebox version 5 was released in April 2006 and expanded the possibilities of the modem. It is now divided into two boxes connected together via high-speed Wifi MIMO or PLC: the first device provides Internet access, Wifi connection and a phone line; the second device is an IPTV set-top box, with advanced TV features like timeshifting, or video on demand. It also supports video games, either specifically designed for the Freebox or using emulation of discontinued video game systems (Master System, Game Gear, Game Boy).

The multimedia element is able to read HDTV IPTV streams and includes a Terrestrial Numerical Television demodulator, can serve as a home A/V broadcasting station, includes a 40 Gb hard drive for recording and time-shifting, and a load of A/V ports.

The Network element is an Ethernet hub and a wifi hotspot.

The two elements can be linked via Ethernet, wifi or High-Speed Networking Over the Mains.

The telephony offer via the Freebox offers various services such as free calls between Freebox subscribers and towards the fixed numbers in Metropolitan France, and also free over 100 foreign countries (USA, Canada, UK, Spain, China, India, South America, etc.).

According to Alexandre Archambault from Free, the Freebox is &quot;nothing other than the return to the fundamentals of the DSL&quot;, whose initial objective was &quot;to connect via a single support several types of terminals, therefore several types of services: telephone (telephony), microcomputer (Internet access), television set (television transmission, video on demand, pay per view...), hi-fi system (radios, etc.)&quot;.

Therefore, it is much more than a simple ADSL modem, which can only make the interface between a computer and the Internet. Free general conditions describe it as &quot;an electronic instrument being used as interface between the data-processing and or audio-visual equipment of the user and the network of Free Telecom&quot;.

==Technical features==

The box is managed by an operating system using a derivative of the Linux kernel. It has many interfaces:
* An Ethernet port 10/100 Mbit/s full/half duplex;
* A USB 2.0 port;
* An HDMI port;
* An RJ11 jack for the ADSL connection;
* An RJ11 jack for phone equipment (two jacks on versions 1 &amp; 2 but only one active);
* A SCART socket
* A digital audio output RCA, or optical S/PDIF starting from version 3;
* An extension port of the serial ATA standard on versions 3 and 4 and parallel ATA standard on versions 1 and 2;
* A host USB port on version 4;

Since version 3, the Freebox can be configured to act as a router. The Freebox version 4 appeared mid-2004 and includes a chipset compatible with the ADSL 2+ standard, as well as a USB port, which will allow, in the long term, the addition of functions such as videoconferencing.

The Freebox OS uses BusyBox.

Now with the v3 (and next), it also provides a VideoLAN client in order to get the movies (in any format VLC understands) stored on the computer and watchable on TV through a playlist selector. This functionality is named Freeplayer.

In the same way, the Freebox (v3 and upper) is able to broadcast TV channels to one or more computers.

<text>Combe Moor, also known as Coombes Moor, is a linear hamlet in the civil parish of Byton in Herefordshire, England, to the south-east of the Welsh town of Presteigne, near the border with Wales, and north-west from the county town of Hereford.

==Geography==

The village is on the B4362 road on the B4362 road between Shobdon and Presteigne near the confluence of the Hindwell Brook and the River Lugg. During the Devensian period, &quot;the eastward advance of the Wye Glacier blocked the preglacial Lugg at Combe Moor and the river cut a new course to the north-east before turning south-east through the east-to-west ridge via the Covenhope Gap.&quot; &quot;Cross and Hodgson&quot; described the sediments of the Combe Moor basin in 1975 as &quot;finely laminated and stoneless.&quot;

Combe Moor lies to the south-east of Combe, just to the south-west of the village of Byton. Brandhill Wood lies to the south and Park Hill to the north-east. The moor to the north of the village is called Byton Moor and there is also a moor of the same name as the village just to the west of that. The Herefordshire Trail long distance footpath passes through the village.

==Landmarks==
The Herefordshire Trail leads to Wapley Hillfort. There is an old schoolhouse to the north-east along the road to Byton. Mistletoe House in the village is a tea room and gallery. Other cottages in the vicinity include Rue Cottage in the village itself and Wapley cottage along the lane to the south-east.

<doc id="1081416" wikidata="Q668236" url="?curid=1081416" title="Der Blutharsch">
<text>Der Blutharsch was an Austrian martial industrial, neofolk and psychedelic rock project created in 1996 by Albin Julius. 

Group leader Albin Julius died on 4 May 2022.

==History==
Originally a side project to The Moon lay hidden beneath a Cloud, Julius&#x27; first release as Der Blutharsch was a self-titled picture disc (1996), limited to 250 copies. Early Der Blutharsch recorded material was very dark ambient in sound, heavy on historic samples and post-industrial melodic drones. As the discography progressed, the material became more lively, with the more bombastic approach and a focus on a form of martial industrial with emphasis on neoclassical instrumentation combined with experimentalism. Subject matter and imagery largely derived from historical topics relating to the history of Germanic Europe.

With the release of &quot;Time Is Thee Enemy!&quot; in 2003, Julius took Der Blutharsch into the direction of a psychedelic rock band. Gone were the martial aspects of Der Blutharsch, only apparent to some extent in promotional imagery. Instead of a one-man project, promotional material showcased the project as a fleshed out group. Live shows continued in this direction with a focus on placing the group further into the area of psychedelic rock. Subsequently, any traces of the previous focus on historical themes disappeared with new promotional imagery showcasing references to psychedelic pop art.

Julius released all Der Blutharsch material on his own record label, WKN (Wir Kapitulieren Niemals). This translates from German to English as &quot;We will never surrender&quot;.

==Live==
Live, Der Blutharsch started as a one-man electronic music show. Later, Albin Julius performed as a two or three man show, with martial drumming and spoken (or shouted) lyrics. This can be seen in the &quot;Gold Gab Ich Für Eisen&quot; (1999) and &quot;God Blast America!&quot; (filmed 2002, released 2011) videos. Later, Der Blutharsch became a full band, with acoustic instruments and female vocal accompaniment. Julius has since enlisted several musicians as &quot;full time&quot; members of the group with the setup of a traditional rock band. In September 2009 they played at the Incubate (festival) in Tilburg, Netherlands.

==Symbolism and aesthetics==
Originally, Der Blutharsch used a logo that was a single Sig Rune within a triangular shield, reading &#x27;Der Blutharsch&#x27; in the upper portion of the triangle in a Fraktur font. This appeared on most early Der Blutharsch vinyl releases and on the original Der Blutharsch website, but was replaced on later pressings by the new logo. On later Der Blutharsch releases, the original Sig Rune logo was replaced with an iron cross embellished with oak leaves. Reissues of old material also excluded the previous logo in favor of the &#x27;new&#x27; logo.

==Controversy==
Julius&#x27; output is often described as neo-fascist owing to his frequent use of military-related themes and fascist aesthetics, including Third Reich-era material, in the composition of his works. Der Blutharsch released 7&quot; split singles with the Italian neo-fascist bands Zetazeroalfa and Sotto Fascia Semplice and Austrian doom metal band Our Survival Depends On Us, but has also worked with the anarchist industrial band Terroritmo, now called Wakinyan. In 2004, Der Blutharsch was forced to cancel a performance in Israel after protests from members of the Israeli cabinet and Knesset, the mayor of Tel Aviv, and the Anti-Defamation League.

<text>Youth Parliament of Manitoba Inc. (YPM) is a non-partisan, non-denominational, and incorporated registered charity based in Manitoba, Canada.

Its mission is &quot;to foster amongst the youth of Manitoba an understanding of, interest in, and engagement with the Canadian democratic parliamentary process that would enable their active participation in society as responsible citizens. In so doing, YPM strives to encourage the growth of the individual and their abilities through their exposure to a diversity of ideas and perspectives and the fellowship of their peers.&quot;

== Activities ==
YPM&#x27;s flagship event is Session, an annual model parliament that takes place from December 26 to 31 each year at the Manitoba Legislature open to all Manitoban youth aged 16 to 20. During Session, participants (&quot;members&quot;) debate mock legislation according to parliamentary procedure as per YPM&#x27;s Standing Orders. Throughout the week, members also have the opportunity to meet current and former politicians from the Manitoba Legislature and the House of Commons, partake in workshops, and socialize with fellow youth from across the province.

Every summer, YPM hosts Speaker&#x27;s Night, its premier fundraising gala. Proceeds go towards supporting YPM&#x27;s programming, financial aid capabilities, and operating costs. Recent keynote speakers have included Dr. Annette Trimbee, Susan Thompson, Senator Marilou McPhedran, Dr. Aimée Craft, and Wab Kinew.

YPM is a founding member of the Western Canada Youth Parliament and current Member Parliament of its successor, Canada Youth Parliament. In this capacity, it assists in the organization of, and nominates delegates to, the biennial Canada Youth Parliament.

==History==
In 1922, George Stewart, Lieutenant Governor of the Older Boys’ TUXIS Parliament of Manitoba, opened the first of a long line of annual sessions devoted to the development of leadership and awareness of the parliamentary system among the young men (and later, women) of Manitoba. It has since become one of the oldest Youth Parliaments in a network of similar organizations stretching across the country and the world. Although each of these Parliaments has a unique style and emphasis, all are based on the same basic principle of fostering knowledge of the parliamentary system amongst Canadian youth.

The Older Boys’ Parliament program began in Ontario as part of the TUXIS (“Training Under Christ In Service”) movement. Its original sponsors included various Protestant churches, such as the United Church of Canada, the Anglican, Baptist, Presbyterian, and Lutheran churches, the Salvation Army, and a variety of service groups such as the YMCA, De Molay and Kiwanis organizations. The movement&#x27;s goal was to foster the development of the physical, mental, spiritual and social well-being of the person as inspired by the biblical passage Luke 2:52, which reads: “And Jesus increased in wisdom and in years, and in divine and human favour.” YPs, only one of many TUXIS activities, were designed for religious as well as parliamentary training. Though most YPs were at one time part of the TUXIS movement, only the TUXIS Youth Parliament of Alberta retains the name to this day.

In 1960, “TUXIS” was dropped from the name, leaving “Older Boys’ Parliament.” In 1968, it was decided that YPM would expand its focus by becoming open to youth from non-Protestant backgrounds, thereby becoming non-denominational. This meant that the Oath of Allegiance and the legislation placed before the house was no longer written for specific religious groups and with specifically religious purposes in mind.

On December 28, 1972, a special meeting of the organization was held to officially admit women as full members and to change the organization’s name to Youth Parliament of Manitoba and Northwestern Ontario (YPMNO). Previously, female members had for some years been allowed to attend session but only as associate members who did not hold the right to vote on the matters debated in the house. Seven years later, Ann Thompson became the first female Premier of YPMNO.

In celebration of its 60th anniversary in 1981, YPMNO hosted a first-of-its-kind invitational session for all YPs in Western Canada. Two years later, the Western Canada Youth Parliament (WCYP) was officially formed, with its second session being hosted again in Winnipeg in the chambers of City Council. Our organization has since hosted WCYP on three other occasions, in 1993, 2002 and most recently in 2010.

The organization successfully incorporated in 1984 and gained full charitable status. In 2003, the organization voted to shorten its name to Youth Parliament of Manitoba (YPM).

In 2007, YPM hosted its first annual Spring Session in Manitoba. In 2008, YPM hosted its first annual Speaker’s Night fundraising dinner. In 2019, it elected its first all-female Executive. In 2021, it celebrated its 100th annual Session.

== Past Premiers ==
==Organizational structure==
YPM bases its organizational structure and nomenclature on the Westminster parliamentary system. The membership structure of YPM is made up of three main components: the Executive, the Cabinet, and Backbenchers. All members of YPM are between the ages of 16 and 25.

===Executive===

Youth Parliament of Manitoba Inc. is governed by a five-person Executive, who legally function as the corporation&#x27;s board of directors. Each person is elected for a one-year term by and from the membership on the last day of Session. All directors are volunteers between the ages of 18 and 25. The positions on the board are:

*the Past-Chairperson (Speaker),
*the Chairperson (Premier),
*the Director of Finance (Deputy Speaker),
*the Vice-Chairperson (Deputy Premier), and
*the Director of Procedures (House Leader).

===Cabinet===

The Cabinet is YPM&#x27;s volunteer organizing committee, appointed by the Executive from the members (attendees) of the previous Session. The Cabinet assists the Executive in organizing and holding Session. Current Cabinet portfolios include:

*Ministry of Alumni Affairs
*Ministry of Communications
*Ministry of Defence
*Ministry of External Affairs
*Ministry of Government Services
*Ministry of Human Resources
*Ministry of Internal Affairs
*Ministry of Labour
*Ministry of Publications
*Ministry of Public Relations
*Ministry of Revenue
*Ministry of Supply and Service
*Registrar General
*Whips (Armstrong and Thompson)

===Backbenchers===

All non-Executive and non-Cabinet members of YPM sit as Backbenchers during Session.

== Dignitaries ==

===Lieutenant governor===

Each year, the board of directors invites a distinguished member of the community (in recent years, often a former member) to act as the lieutenant governor (LG). The LG officially opens and prorogues the session, reads the Speech from the Throne, and makes a brief presentation to the membership.

===Honorary president===

The honorary president (HP) is a prominent citizen of Manitoba who serves as an advisor for the organization. At Session, they attend the opening and closing ceremonies.

=== Traditional Knowledge Keeper ===
The Traditional Knowledge Keeper advises the organization on reconciliation with Indigenous peoples in Manitoba. At Session, they conduct a traditional Indigenous teaching on the first and last days.

==Notable alumni==
Many of YPM&#x27;s past members have gone on to successful careers in a variety of fields. Some of the organization&#x27;s prominent past members include:
*Lloyd Axworthy (former Canadian Minister of Foreign Affairs, former president and vice-chancellor of the University of Winnipeg)
*Bill Norrie (former Mayor of Winnipeg)
*Tom Axworthy (principal secretary to Pierre Trudeau from 1981 to 1984)
*Robert Steen (former Mayor of Winnipeg)
*Wally Fox-Decent (former chair of the Workers Compensation Board of Manitoba)
By decision of the Board, former members of YPM who have made outstanding contributions to the organization are eligible to be appointed to the organization&#x27;s Senate.

<text>Combe is a village and civil parish about northeast of Witney in Oxfordshire. It is bounded to the south and southwest by the River Evenlode, to the northwest partly by the course of the Akeman Street Roman road and partly by a road parallel with it, and to the east by the boundary of Blenheim Great Park. The 2011 Census recorded the parish&#x27;s population as 768.

==Church and chapel==

===Church of England===

The Church of England parish church of St Laurence dates from the 12th century but was rebuilt in the late 14th century for Eynsham Abbey. Its interior has several 15th-century wall paintings, which were rediscovered during restoration work in 1892. St Laurence&#x27;s is a Grade I listed building. St Laurence&#x27;s bell tower has a ring of six bells, cast by John Taylor &amp; Co of Loughborough in 1924, and a clock built by John Smith and Sons of Derby in 1948.

===Methodist===
Combe has had a Methodist congregation since about the 1770s, when it used to meet in a house called Wedgehook in Bolton&#x27;s Lane. Three meeting houses were registered in Combe: one in East End in 1823, and two elsewhere in the village in 1827 and 1829. Combe&#x27;s first Methodist chapel was a Wesleyan one built in 1835 at the eastern edge of the village. Methodism in Britain suffered a schism that led to the founding of the Wesleyan Reform Union in 1859, and as a result the congregation at Combe split. 

A United Methodist Free chapel in front of a row of cottages southwest of the village green was built in 1861–63 and enlarged in 1882. In 1893 the original Wesleyan chapel at the east end of the village was rebuilt, with the 9th Duke of Marlborough laying the foundation stone. In 1932 Britain&#x27;s three largest Methodist denominations merged to form what is now the Methodist Church of Great Britain. Combe&#x27;s congregation united to use the Wesleyan chapel at the east end of the village. The United Free Methodist chapel near the village green was closed and is now a private house.

==Economic and social history==

Combe House was built in the 16th or early 17th century and extended in about 1800 or 1812. It used to be the vicarage. Combe Bridge is a stone bridge on the minor road linking the village with Long Hanborough. It spans the Evenlode where the river forms the boundary with Hanborough parish. The bridge was rebuilt in the 18th century with two arches for the river and flood arches either side.

The Duke of Marlborough&#x27;s Blenheim estate adjoins the village. The estate&#x27;s former sawmill, Combe Mill, is now a working museum. It was originally powered by a leat from the Evenlode that turned a breastshot water wheel. It also has a steam-powered rotative beam engine driven by a Cornish boiler, both of which were added in 1852. In 1926 the old water wheel was replaced with a more efficient Poncelet wheel. The mill is now a Grade II* listed building.

The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway was built along the Evenlode valley through the southern part of the parish and opened in 1852. It was operated by the Great Western Railway, which took it over in 1863. In 1935 the GWR opened Combe Halt, where the line crosses the road to Long Hanborough near the sawmill. It is now Combe railway station and the railway is the Cotswold Line. The 75th anniversary of Combe Halt&#x27;s creation was celebrated with the children of Combe C of E Primary school using the line to travel to Worcester.

==Amenities==

Combe has a public house, the Cock Inn, that was built late in the 17th or early in the 18th century. It is beside the village green, which is the setting for four of Combe&#x27;s seasonal festivals: a children&#x27;s Maypole dance, a Summer Ball, a travelling funfair in the autumn and a firework display on Guy Fawkes Night. Combe has a Church of England primary school. Combe has a Women&#x27;s Institute.

==Public Transport==
On weekdays, one train service a day calls at Combe railway station in each direction. There is an hourly bus service to Oxford and in the other direction Charlbury - which stops in Stonesfield Road.

<doc id="1081431" wikidata="Q494842" url="?curid=1081431" title="Darkeden">
<text>DarkEden is a free-to-play massively multiplayer online role-playing computer game in isometric projection or 3/4 perspective developed and published by SOFTON (formerly Metrotech). The game has a horror theme based on a war between humans (Slayers), vampires and Ousters in a region called Helea located in a fictional country of Eastern Europe known as Eslania. The original version of the game, and the most advanced one, is the Korean one from which several other versions have been derived from such as the Japanese, Chinese, Thai and International versions. The Thai and international versions were closed.

==Story==
Vlad Tepes, Elizabeth Bathory, and Gilles de Rais, three of the twelve master vampires, form an alliance and enter the mountainous area of Helea, killing every person they find. They then attempt to awaken Lilith, the mother of all vampires, so that they can have her power. Opening her tomb does not awaken her, but it does create a cloud over Helea that blocks the sun, making Helea a dark eden for vampires.

The human world responded by isolating the region and sending in their militaries to try to rid the area of vampires.

The master vampires soon discover that the only way to gain the power they seek is to search for the pieces of Lilith&#x27;s soul, which were scattered about the area of Helea. Unwilling to share this power, they break their alliance and begin a civil war.

Later, an ancient race of people known as the Ousters awakens from their long sleep and are shocked to see what the vampires and humans have done to Helea. They begin to attempt to wipe them from the area.

==Gameplay==
&quot;DarkEden&quot; is an MMORPG, which requires the players to kill hordes of monsters, fight bosses and complete quests in order to make their character progress. This character progression varies according to the different races. Slayers only have to attack a monster or player to gain experience points. Vampires need to kill a monster or player and drink its blood to gain the maximum experience points available, whereas ousters just have to kill to gain these points. For the same monster, ousters gain more experience points out of them than vampires do even when drinking their blood. Each of the races have a special advantage: the slayers sell the heads and skulls of monsters at the highest prices to npc, the vampires drop the best items out of the three races, and the ousters get experience points the quickest.

&quot;DarkEden&quot; is oriented toward player versus player. Except for few safe zones, players can be attacked without any restriction at any moment by other players. Players may change the race of their character during their progression. If a human is bitten by a vampire, they will turn into a vampire unless they cure themselves in time. Vampire characters can choose to turn humans by talking to an NPC who will do the work for them. There are three different time periods that regulate the battles in Helea, with different circumstances and power dynamics between the races.

==Business model==
&quot;DarkEden&quot; allows players to either play for free or to buy some points and get special advantages. According to the different versions of the game, the restriction for free players varied. The International server, as the beta version, is completely free to play. In the Thai version free-play is restricted to outdoor maps; double option items and bike spawn locations are restricted; and less experience points are earned compared to premium players. The Japanese free-play version has no gameplay restrictions, but premium players earn double experience points and may purchase special items. The free-play in Korean and Global versions has limited experience point progression and has restricted map access (including the central location Perona.)

==Different versions==
The Korean version (The Bloody Chronicles), being the original one, is by far the most advanced, with active GMs and regular events held. One has to be Korean to register. The game has four servers, one of which a non-PK server, that are accessible with the same character.

The North American server operated by Ignited Games has been open as of the end of 2011 and was closed by the end of 2013.. The game was relaunched on Steam on November 28, 2016.

On September 30, 2013, the Japanese server was shut down by Softon after 7 years of existence.

The first closed beta (Korea) of Darkeden 2 started in December 2014 and ended in June 2015.

<doc id="1081439" wikidata="Q923376" url="?curid=1081439" title="Broch of Mousa">
<text>Broch of Mousa (or Mousa Broch) is a preserved Iron Age broch or round tower. It is on the island of Mousa in Shetland, Scotland. It is the tallest broch still standing and amongst the best-preserved prehistoric buildings in Europe. It is thought to have been constructed , and is one of more than 500 brochs built in Scotland. The site is managed by Historic Environment Scotland as a scheduled monument.

==Location==
The broch is located on the western shore of the island of Mousa (, [59.99523,-1.18191]). It is accessible by boat from Sandwick, Shetland, south of Lerwick. It stands on the flat rock surface of a low promontory near the shore overlooking Mousa Sound.

It is the tallest broch still standing and amongst the best-preserved prehistoric buildings in Europe.

==Description==
Mousa Broch has one of the smallest overall diameters of any broch, as well as one of the thickest wall bases and smallest interiors; this massive construction (as well as its remote location) is likely to be the main explanation for its excellent state of preservation. It stands high and is accessible via a single entrance at ground level. Once inside, a visitor may ascend an internal staircase to the top. It is the only broch which is complete nearly to the top, including the original intramural stair. It is built of dry stone with no mortar. The entrance is on the west side but has been altered at various times from its original appearance. The entrance passage is long and still has an original bar-hole.
Inside a hearth and floor tank can be seen in the central space. There is a low stone bench around the base of the inside wall, which was part of an early alteration to the interior. The broch went through at least two phases of occupation. In its original condition it may or may not have contained a wooden roundhouse resting on the scarcement ledges and presumably on a ring of posts set into the primary floor. (It has recently been argued that the scarcements may have supported scaffolding in a roofless building.) At a later date, if the wooden building existed, it was demolished to make way for a small wheelhouse (with three projecting stone piers) in the interior. Scarcement ledges at heights of might have supported the putative timber building. The other main feature of the ground floor is the three large cells within the walls. They are entered via thresholds which are above the floor level. Above the lintel of each cell door are further openings which seem designed to let light and air into the chamber behind. The cells all have recesses, or large cupboards, set into the thickness of the wall.

Above the solid base of the broch are six galleries. They are formed by the space between the two concentric walls of the upper part of the broch, and are partly lit by voids. It is possible to walk along most of the galleries. They were probably used by the builders as an aid to constructing the building, rather than for accommodation or storage.

The stair, which begins at the second level, is reached by a doorway in the inner wall face, which has an adjacent cell. There is also an upper cell above the entrance passage.

==Later history==

Mousa Broch continued to be used over the centuries and is mentioned in two Norse Sagas. Egil&#x27;s Saga tells of a couple eloping from Norway to Iceland who were shipwrecked and used the broch as a temporary refuge. The Orkneyinga Saga gives an account of a siege of the broch by Earl Harald Maddadsson in 1153 following the abduction of his mother, who was held inside the broch.

The site was visited by the antiquarian George Low during his tour of 1774, and he provided the first drawings of the broch. It was visited by Sir Walter Scott in 1814, who described it as &quot;a Pictish fortress, the most entire probably in the world.&quot; The geologist and antiquarian Samuel Hibbert visited it in 1818 and provided a detailed account of the site. The first accurate survey was conducted by Sir Henry Dryden in 1852 and 1866.

==Excavations==
Mousa was cleared of debris and repaired in 1861 and great quantities of animal bones, especially of otters (which probably inhabited the deserted ruin) were found. Also found were pieces of a clay pot, stone pot lids, a slaty stone about 12 inches long &quot;like a three-cornered file&quot; and a &quot;carved model of a Norway boat in fir&quot; about long. The interior was cleared again by the Office of Works in 1919, and few additional finds emerged. In the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh are some pottery sherds, including a large black-burnished rim sherd, probably found during the 19th century clearance. There was major rebuilding of the broch from 1967 until the 1980s.

In January 2005 it was announced that archaeologists had used 3D laser scanning to investigate the structure in detail for further possible repairs.

==Storm petrels==
Mousa Broch is well known among birders for its breeding European storm petrels, which are best seen after dark on partly or on completely overcast summer nights. The island holds around 6,800 breeding pairs in total, representing about 8% of the British population and about 2.6% of the world population. Some of these birds nest in burrows within the broch itself.

<text>Family Channel (commonly or simply known as Family) is a Canadian English-language specialty channel owned by WildBrain Television Inc., a subsidiary of WildBrain. The network primarily airs children&#x27;s television series, teen dramas, as well as other programming targeting a family audience. Despite having its own headquarters in the Brookfield Place office in Financial District, the channel is transmitted from Corus Quay.

Launched on September 1, 1988, it was originally a joint venture between the owners of the premium television services First Choice and Superchannel; due to the breakup of Western International Communications, the network became a joint venture between Astral Media and Corus Entertainment. By 2001, Astral had acquired full ownership of the network; after the 2013 acquisition of Astral by Bell Media, the network and its sister channels were divested to DHX Media (now WildBrain) in 2014.

From its launch in 1988 until 2015, Family&#x27;s programming heavily mirrored that of the American cable network Disney Channel, with which Family held a licensing agreement. Family Channel&#x27;s programming lineup consisted mainly of domestic and foreign-imported live-action and animated series from Disney Channel, feature films from the Disney film library, classic films from other Canadian and American film studios, and specials. Astral also used this relationship to launch Canadian versions of Disney Junior and Disney XD. After the DHX acquisition, the license agreement ended in 2015; Disney then entered into a new licensing agreement with Corus and launched new Canadian versions of Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior. Since then, Family Channel has acquired programming from other sources.

Family was originally licensed as a premium specialty service, which necessitated that it operate under a commercial-free format, but allowed it to operate multiplex feeds (particularly the aforementioned Disney Junior, now Family Jr.). Nevertheless, television providers typically distributed Family as a conventional specialty channel. In 2016, Family was relieved of this mandate after the CRTC transitioned premium specialty services to the standardized &quot;discretionary service&quot; license.

As of March 2013, Family Channel is available to approximately six million pay television households in Canada. It broadcasts Eastern Time Zone feeds in both standard definition and high definition, and a Pacific Time Zone feed solely in standard definition.

== History ==

=== Early history ===

Family Channel was licensed as a premium television service by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) on December 1, 1987; it was originally operated as a joint venture between Allarcom Pay Television Limited and First Choice Canadian Communications Corporation (owners of both Superchannel and First Choice), with both companies owning a 50% stake in the service.
In October 1999, as part of the break-up of Western International Communications (which had bought Allarcom), its stake in Family Channel was sold to Corus Entertainment. In March 2001, in response to concerns from the CRTC over Corus&#x27;s near-monopoly position in children&#x27;s specialty channels (accounting for its stakes in YTV, Treehouse, and Teletoon), Corus traded its stake in Family Channel to Astral Media in exchange for its stake in The Comedy Network for $126.9 million, giving them full ownership.

On July 1, 2007, Family became the last English language children&#x27;s network in Canada to switch to a 24-hour broadcast schedule. On January 11, 2011, Family launched a high-definition feed, and concurrently introduced an updated logo and on-air presentation.

=== Sale to DHX Media ===
In March 2013, following the Competition Bureau&#x27;s approval of Bell Media&#x27;s acquisition of Astral Media, Bell announced that it would divest Family and its sister networks, among other assets, in order to reduce the market share it would hold in the English-language television market following the completion of the sale. The CRTC approved the sale on June 27, 2013, with Family Channel and its related networks concurrently placed in a blind trust held by businessman and former Montreal Canadiens president Pierre Boivin, pending their sale to a third-party.

On November 28, 2013, DHX Media announced that it would acquire Family and its sister networks for $170 million. While the company already distributed and produced a large library of children&#x27;s television series (particularly through its 2012 purchase of the Cookie Jar Entertainment, which gave it ownership of the program libraries of Cinar and DIC Entertainment), the purchase marked DHX&#x27;s first foray into broadcasting. DHX has indicated that it would leverage its resources and library to add more original, Canadian-produced programming to Family under its ownership.

The acquisition of Family Channel and its sister networks by DHX was approved by the CRTC on July 24, 2014. As a condition of the sale, the CRTC imposed licensing conditions requiring that at least 60% of the Canadian programming broadcast by the network on an annual basis be produced by companies other than DHX. The acquisition was finalized on July 31, 2014, with Family and its sister networks becoming part of a newly formed division of the company known as DHX Television.

=== Loss of Disney Channel programming rights and other changes ===
On April 16, 2015, it was announced that Corus Entertainment had acquired Canadian rights to Disney Channel&#x27;s programming library, and that it would launch a Canadian version of Disney Channel in September 2015. DHX&#x27;s programming agreement with Disney would end in January 2016. As a result of these changes, Disney programming was phased out of Family Channel&#x27;s lineup throughout the remainder of 2015, and its sister Disney Junior and Disney XD-branded networks were rebranded as Family Jr., Télémagino, and Family Chrgd. Corus would also launch new Disney Junior and Disney XD channels on December 1, 2015.

Alongside new and original productions, DHX reached new output deals with AwesomenessTV, DreamWorks Animation, and Mattel in 2015 for programming based on their properties across its networks.

On June 9, 2015, it was announced that a new incarnation of the &quot;Degrassi&quot; franchise, &quot;&quot;, would premiere on Family in 2016. The show is produced by Epitome Pictures, a studio DHX acquired in 2014. &quot;Next Class&quot; premiered on January 4, 2016 as part of a new primetime block known as &quot;F2N&quot;. The F2N block was positioned towards an older teenage audience than the &quot;tween&quot; audience that Family has typically targeted; DHX Television senior vice-president Joe Tedesco explained that the company had original series in development for Family in case it ever did lose its output deal with Disney, and that these decisions were based on a goal to build a &quot;strong lineup&quot; of programs, and was not financially motivated. Tedesco went on to explain that the F2N block was meant to create a &quot;meaningful destination&quot; for teens and, in the case of &quot;Degrassi&quot;—a series that has historically dealt with teen issues, encourage family viewing.

As part of the CRTC&#x27;s &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk TV&quot; initiative, DHX Media expressed concern that the elimination of genre protection for Category A specialty channels would put services licensed as premium services at an unfair disadvantage, especially due to their inability to air advertising. On November 2, 2016, the CRTC approved the implementation of new categories for licensed television services, replacing the separate specialty and pay television categories with a single &quot;Discretionary service&quot; category using standardized conditions of license, and ruled that current premium services may operate under these deregulated policies effective immediately. This decision allowed Family Channel to begin operating under an advertising-supported format. Tedesco commended the CRTC for the decision, stating that it &quot;represents the next logical step in the implementation of the Let&#x27;s Talk TV decision, when genre protection was eliminated, and it ensures that pay and specialty channels will now be on a level field.&quot;

On December 18, 2024, WildBrain announced that it would sell a two-thirds majority stake of its television operations—including Family—to IoM Media Ventures, a Halifax-based company founded by former WildBrain CEO Dana Landry.

== Programming ==

Family&#x27;s current programming is aimed towards children, teenagers and young adults aged 6–25 and encompasses original and acquired children&#x27;s television series, teen dramas, sitcoms, and both theatrically released and made-for-television movies. Its daytime lineup is aimed at children, youth, and teenagers, while its primetime programs are aimed at an older teenage and family audience. The channel airs films on Friday and Saturday evenings and on weekend afternoons.

Historically, Family and its spin-offs had been the main Canadian outlets for programming from the American Disney Channel and its sibling brands; Disney Junior and Disney XD. The channel also co-produced the 2010 film &quot;16 Wishes&quot;, in association with Disney Channel and MarVista Entertainment. Family would begin to phase out Disney programming in late 2015, after Corus Entertainment acquired exclusive rights to Disney Channel and its associated brands in Canada. Since then, Family acquired the bulk of its programming from AwesomenessTV and DreamWorks Animation, as well as other syndicated and off-network programming targeting a family audience. In the past, the channel had also aired selected live-action Nickelodeon programs not picked up by YTV (which has typically been the main Canadian carrier of Nickelodeon programming).

Family has also co-commissioned programming with the American network Universal Kids, owned by DreamWorks&#x27; parent company NBCUniversal, which had previously acquired the rights to the Family original series &quot;The Next Step&quot; and provided additional funding for its sixth season due to reduced financial commitments by DHX. Family also co-commissioned the children&#x27;s horror anthology &quot;Creeped Out&quot; with British children&#x27;s channel CBBC.

As previously mandated for premium services (and consistently with Disney Channel itself), Family did not initially air traditional commercial advertising, besides promotions in between (or sometimes during) programs for its own programming and sponsored contests. It also carried interstitial segments, such as teen pop music videos under the banner &quot;Fam Jam&quot;, features on upcoming family films that were produced by The Movie Network, and interstitial series from Disney Channel. After changes in CRTC policies and the network&#x27;s licensing in November 2016, Family switched to a conventional, commercial-supported format for its non-preschool programs.

=== Notable programming blocks ===
==== Former ====
* Disney Junior on Family – &quot;Disney Junior on Family&quot; was Family Channel&#x27;s version of the United States programming block and cable channel of the same name featuring shows targeted at children aged 2–7, that aired Monday through Fridays from 4:30 a.m. to 7:00 a.m. and 8:45 a.m. to 11:00 a.m., and weekend mornings from 4:30 a.m. to 8:00 a.m. EST. The block, which began in November 4, 2002 as &quot;Family Playhouse Fun&quot;, then in July 15, 2008 as &quot;Family Jr.&quot;, and later &quot;Playhouse Disney&quot; on September 12, 2009 before being renamed &quot;Disney Junior&quot; on May 6, 2011 as part of a rebranding of Playhouse Disney&#x27;s program blocks and standalone channels around the world to the Disney Junior brand, primarily targeted preschoolers as Family&#x27;s usual target audience of older children and teenagers are in school at that time.
*Jetix – A Canadian version of the U.S programming block seen on ABC Family and Toon Disney. Jetix launched on September 10, 2006, replacing &quot;Power Box&quot;.
* F2N – Launched January 4, 2016, this primetime block was aimed at an older teenage audience, anchored by &quot;&quot; and eight series acquisitions from AwesomenessTV. This teen block aired every night starting at 9:00 p.m. EST. It was discontinued in September 2017.
== Related services ==
=== Vrak.TV ===

Along with Family, Vrak launched on September 1, 1988 as Le Canal Famillie, which began as a French version of Family Channel and its competitor network, YTV. In 2001, the channel was renamed to Vrak.TV. On July 5, 2013, due to the acquisition of Astral by Bell Media, Vrak.TV was separated from Family. In 2014, it rebranded as Vrak, while launching a new block called &quot;Vrak2&quot;. In 2016, the channel changed its demographic to the 13-35 age group due to the success of its &quot;Vrak2&quot; block.

On August 16, 2023, Vrak and Z were removed from Vidéotron, the company that created the original channel it was based on 41 years earlier, whilst Bell removed Yoopa from all of their TV services a day later. Yoopa shut down on January 11, 2024, and was replaced with a TV broadcast version of its parent company&#x27;s QUB Radio channel.

Two days later on August 18, 2023, Bell Media announced that the channel would be closing on October 1, 2023, owing to &quot;challenges&quot; in the broadcasting sector, lack of viewers and regulatory affairs deemed &quot;outdated&quot; by Bell Media. On September 25, the CRTC confirmed it had revoked Vrak&#x27;s licence at the request of Bell Media, with the channel shut down on October 1, 2023.

=== Family Jr. and Télémagino ===

On November 30, 2007, Family launched Playhouse Disney Channel, a separate channel featuring programming aimed at a preschool audience, based on Disney&#x27;s Playhouse Disney brand. Subject to carriage, the multiplex channel was made available at no additional charge to television providers and subscribers who receive its parent network. It was rebranded as Disney Junior on May 6, 2011, following the launch of the brand in the United States earlier that year. On September 18, 2015, due to Corus Entertainment&#x27;s acquisition of rights to Disney&#x27;s children&#x27;s programming and brands, the channel was re-branded as Family Jr.

As Family was licensed as a premium service, it is allowed to operate multiplex channels that carry additional programming consistent with its licensing and nature of service.

A French-language version of the channel, now known as Télémagino, was launched on July 5, 2010 as Playhouse Disney Télé. Unlike Family Jr., Télémagino operates under a separate Category B license.

=== WildBrainTV ===

On June 1, 2011, Family launched a Canadian version of Disney XD under a separate license. It re-branded as Family Chrgd on October 9, 2015. It was renamed once more to WildBrainTV on March 1, 2022.

=== Other services ===
* Radio Disney – From October 2011, Family Channel offered a live audio stream of U.S. children&#x27;s music network Radio Disney through Family.ca.

<text>Robert Edward Stevenson (31 March 1905 – 30 April 1986) was a British-American screenwriter and film director.

After directing a number of British films, including &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1937), he was contracted by David O. Selznick and moved to Hollywood, but was loaned to other studios, directing &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1943). He directed 19 live-action films for The Walt Disney Company in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s. 

A prolific filmmaker with a long, distinguished career, Stevenson is probably best remembered for directing the Julie Andrews musical fantasy &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), for which Andrews won the Best Actress Oscar and Stevenson was nominated for Best Director. His other Disney films include the first two Herbie films, &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1968) and &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot; (1974), as well as &quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971). Three of his films featured English actor David Tomlinson.

==Education==
Having attended Shrewsbury School, Stevenson won a scholarship to study at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. There he won the John Bernard Seely Prize for Aeronautics, and in 1927 graduated with a first-class MA (Cantab) degree in the Mechanical Sciences Tripos (engineering). He was also president of the university&#x27;s Liberal Club, editor of the student &quot;Granta&quot; magazine, and while conducting postgraduate research in psychology he was elected president of the prestigious Cambridge Union Society. On leaving Cambridge, his parents gave him six weeks to find a job, and he gained employment as the assistant of Michael Balcon.

==Career==
===British films===
Stevenson started to write scripts, providing the story of &quot;Balaclava&quot; (1928). He also worked on the scripts for &quot;Greek Street&quot; (1930), &quot;The Ringer&quot; (1931), &quot;Night in Montmartre&quot; (1931), &quot;The Calendar&quot; (1931), &quot;Michael and Mary&quot; (1931) with Edna Best and Herbert Marshall and &quot;Sunshine Susie&quot; (1931) with Jack Hulbert, &quot;Lord Babs&quot; (1932), &quot;The Faithful Heart&quot; (1932) with Best and Marshall, and &quot;Love on Wheels&quot; (1932) with Hulbert.

Stevenson&#x27;s debut feature film as director was a Jack Hulbert–Cicely Courtneidge musical, &quot;Happy Ever After&quot; (1932), a co-production shot in Germany and produced by Eric Pommer. He also wrote the British-German co productions &quot;F.P.1&quot; (1933) and &quot;Early to Bed&quot; (1933).

Stevenson went on to write and direct &quot;Falling for You&quot; (1933) with Hulbert and Courtneidge, and did some uncredited direction on &quot;The Camels Are Coming&quot; (1934) with Hulbert. On that film he met Anna Lee, who became his wife in 1935. He was a producer on &quot;Little Friend&quot; (1934).

Stevenson worked as writer on &quot;Thunder in the East&quot; (1934) and &quot;The Only Girl&quot; (1933) with Charles Boyer.

Stevenson received acclaim for &quot;Tudor Rose&quot; (1936), a film of the Lady Jane Grey story which Stevenson wrote and directed. He directed &quot;The Man Who Changed His Mind&quot; (1936) with Boris Karloff and Anna Lee, then another with Hulbert, &quot;Jack of All Trades&quot; (1936).

Stevenson wrote &quot;Windbag the Sailor&quot; (1936) for Will Hay and &quot;Paradise for Two&quot; (1937) for Hulbert.

Stevenson directed the action adventure movie &quot;King Solomon&#x27;s Mines&quot; (1937) with Lee, Cedric Hardwicke and Paul Robeson. He did a science fiction film with Lee, &quot;Non-Stop New York&quot; (1937).

Stevenson went to Gainbsorough to do &quot;Owd Bob&quot; (1938) with Will Fyffe, &quot;The Ware Case&quot; (1938) with Clive Brook, &quot;Young Man&#x27;s Fancy&quot; (1939) with Lee, and &quot;Return to Yesterday&quot; (1940) with Brook and Lee. He worked on the script for most of the latter films.

===Hollywood films===
Stevenson received an offer to go to Hollywood to work for David O. Selznick along with Alfred Hitchcock. Selznick only made films intermittently, but he regularly signed talent to long-term contracts and loaned them out to other studios. He loaned Stevenson to RKO he directed &quot;Tom Brown&#x27;s School Days&quot; (1940). He went to Universal to direct a new version of &quot;Back Street&quot; (1941) with Charles Boyer then went back to RKO for &quot;Joan of Paris&quot; (1942) with Michèle Morgan, a big hit.

Stevenson wrote and directed an adaptation of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1943) for Selznick starring Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine. He was also one of several directors on &quot;Forever and a Day&quot; (1943). 

Stevenson directed Hedy Lamarr in &quot;Dishonored Lady&quot; (1947) and Dick Powell in &quot;To the Ends of the Earth&quot; (1948).

He returned to RKO, now under the control of Howard Hughes, to make &quot;The Woman on Pier 13&quot; (originally, &quot;I Married a Communist&quot;, 1949). He followed it with &quot;Walk Softly, Stranger&quot; (1950) with Joseph Cotten, &quot;My Forbidden Past&quot; (1951) with Robert Mitchum and Ava Gardner, and &quot;The Las Vegas Story&quot; (1952) with Jane Russell and Victor Mature. He also did some uncredited directing on &quot;Macao&quot; (1952).

===Television===
Stevenson went into directing television and directed six episodes of the first season of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; during which it first went to the top of the TV ratings. He directed over 100 TV episodes in five years including: &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;, &quot;Your Jeweler&#x27;s Showcase&quot;, &quot;Footlights Theater&quot;, &quot;Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre&quot;, &quot;Cavalcade of America&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, &quot;The Star and the Story&quot;, &quot;Star Stage&quot;, &quot;The 20th Century-Fox Hour&quot;, &quot;The Joseph Cotten Show&quot;, &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; and &quot;The Christophers&quot;.

===Walt Disney===
Stevenson worked for the Disney Company in 1956 for six weeks and ending up making 19 films in 20 years. His early credits were &quot;Johnny Tremain&quot; (1957), a story set in the American Revolution, and &quot;Old Yeller&quot; (1957), a boy and his dog tale. In 2019, &quot;Old Yeller&quot; was selected by the Library of Congress for preservation in the National Film Registry for being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

Stevenson did episodes of Disney&#x27;s &quot;Zorro&quot;, then directed a film about Ireland, &quot;Darby O&#x27;Gill and the Little People&quot; (1959), and an adaptation of &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1960). He had a commercial success with the comedy &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot; (1961) and the adventure film &quot;In Search of the Castaways&quot; (1962). &quot;Son of Flubber&quot; (1963) was a popular sequel to &quot;The Absent-Minded Professor&quot;, and &quot;The Misadventures of Merlin Jones&quot; (1964), a teen comedy, was an unexpected hit, leading to a sequel, &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Uncle&quot; (1965).

None did as well at the box office as &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; (1964), which gained domestic rentals of $45,000,000 and won five Oscars.

Also among Stevenson&#x27;s Disney films was the Hayley Mills comedy &quot;That Darn Cat!&quot; (1965). Stevenson and Disney focused on comedies: &quot;The Gnome-Mobile&quot; (1967) with Walter Brennan, &quot;Blackbeard&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1968) with Peter Ustinov and Dean Jones, and &quot;The Love Bug&quot; (1968) with Jones, which was another hit.

&quot;Bedknobs and Broomsticks&quot; (1971) was an attempt to repeat the success of &quot;Mary Poppins&quot;. Stevenson directed &quot;Herbie Rides Again&quot; (1974) with Ken Berry and Helen Hayes, and the adventure story &quot;The Island at the Top of the World&quot; (1974). &quot;One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing&quot; (1975), with Hayes and Ustinov, was a comedy. Stevenson&#x27;s last feature was &quot;The Shaggy D.A.&quot; (1976) with Dean Jones.

In July 1977, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that his track record at Disney made him &quot;the most commercially successful director in the history of films.&quot; At the end of 1976, he had 16 films on &quot;Variety&quot;″s list of all-time domestic rental films, more than any other director at the time, with the second most successful having only 12. &quot;The Shaggy D.A.&quot; was to become his 17th, all being Disney films. The total US and Canadian rentals for these 17 pictures was $188,000,000, which &quot;Variety&quot; said translated into roughly $250 million in world rentals or an estimated world box office gross of $750 million.

==Personal life==
Stevenson was married four times. He married his first wife Cecilie L Leslie in 1929 and divorced her in 1934, then married English actress Anna Lee in that same year. They lived on London&#x27;s Bankside for five years, moving to Hollywood in 1939, where he remained for many years. They had two daughters, Venetia and Caroline, before divorcing in March 1944.

During World War II, he became an American citizen and served with Frank Capra in the U.S. Army Signal Corps.

He married Frances Holyoke Howard on October 8, 1944, they later divorced. They had one son, Hugh Howard Stevenson. In 1963 he married Ursula Henderson, and they remained married until Stevenson&#x27;s death in 1986. Robert Stevenson&#x27;s widow, Ursula Henderson, appeared as herself in the documentary &quot;Locked in the Tower: The Men behind Jane Eyre&quot; in 2007.

<text>Advanced Brake Warning Systems are a technology developed in Israel in 1989 which display additional signalling information, such as by actuating the brake lights when a driver suddenly and abruptly releases the accelerator pedal in preparation for a panic stop.

Other proposed systems advocate a different signal (brake lights brighter or blinking) during a hard panic stop or when a vehicle is no longer moving at all.

While these concepts were advocated to various regulatory bodies in the U.S. and Europe during the 1990s, the idea has met with limited enthusiasm and much opposition. Many of the objections assert that drivers do not have time to assimilate extra information sent by non-standard signalling apparatus and that even the advanced warning of a brake light being actuated by the driver&#x27;s foot suddenly leaving the accelerator could generate enough false alerts to render the impact of such a system meaningless.

The systems are therefore not approved even as aftermarket devices in many western markets and there is little prospect of them being required to be installed on new cars by automobile manufacturers anytime in the near future.

<doc id="1081444" wikidata="Q3497150" url="?curid=1081444" title="EMD F40PH">
<text>The EMD F40PH is a four-axle B-B diesel-electric locomotive built by General Motors Electro-Motive Division in several variants from 1975 to 1992. Intended for use on Amtrak&#x27;s short-haul passenger routes, it became the backbone of Amtrak&#x27;s diesel fleet after the failure of the EMD SDP40F. The F40PH also found widespread use on commuter railroads in the United States and with VIA Rail in Canada. Additional F40PH variants were manufactured by Morrison-Knudsen and MotivePower between 1988 and 1998, mostly rebuilt from older locomotives.

Amtrak retired its fleet of F40PHs in the early-2000s in favor of the GE Genesis, but the locomotive remains the mainstay of VIA Rail&#x27;s long-distance trains; a depiction of the locomotive hauling &quot;The Canadian&quot; is featured on the reverse of the Frontier series Canadian $10 bill. The F40PHs are still a common sight on many other commuter railroads throughout the United States. In addition, Amtrak has kept 22 of its F40PHs in use as non-powered control units.

==Background==
Amtrak inherited an aging and mechanically incompatible fleet of diesel locomotives from various private railroads on its startup in 1971. The most modern locomotives remained in private hands for freight service, or to operate the various commuter services which, by law, did not pass to Amtrak. To replace these Amtrak ordered 150 EMD SDP40F locomotives, which began entering service in 1973. These were supplemented by 25 GE P30CHs which entered service in 1975. The SDP40F was a troubled design; problems with weight distribution led to a series of derailments in the mid-1970s. Meanwhile, the poor truck design of the P30CH (and the electric GE E60CP) curtailed further orders of that unit when Amtrak found itself needing more short- and medium-distance power in the spring of 1975.

==Design==

The design of the F40PH was based on the EMD GP40-2 freight road switcher locomotive and shared that locomotive&#x27;s turbocharged EMD 645E3 V16 cylinder, two-stroke, water-cooled diesel engine (prime mover). The prime mover developed at 893 RPM. The main (traction) generator converts mechanical energy from the prime mover into electricity distributed through a high voltage cabinet to the traction motors. Each of the four traction motors is geared to a pair of driving wheels; the gear ratio determines the maximum speed of the locomotive. A standard F40PH has a gear ratio of 57:20, permitting a maximum speed of . Some Amtrak F40PHs were delivered with a 56:21 gearing for . The first 30 locomotives were built with a fuel tank. Subsequent units were built with a tank. Beginning with the EMD F40PH-2, introduced in 1985, the prime mover developed . Many of the original F40PHs were updated to match that output. The locomotives were long. A standard F40PH weighs .

For passenger service the F40PH has another electrical alternator, the head-end generator. The HEP unit generates three-phase AC power at 480 V (500 kW on the first order, 800 kW on later units) for lighting, heating and air-conditioning the train. Originally, F40PHs powered the HEP alternator from the prime mover. As a result of that, the train had to be at a constant 60 Hz frequency, and the prime mover had to turn at a constant 893 RPM while supplying head end power (even standing still, with the throttle in idle). Power to the traction motors was controlled by varying the field excitation of the main (traction) generator. On some later versions of the F40PH (and on many rebuilt F40s), a second small auxiliary diesel engine at the rear of the locomotive powers the HEP alternator. In these engines, the prime-mover speed varies in the usual way. They can be identified by the diesel exhaust at the rear of the locomotive and by their quiet idle. Remaining F40s, with the constant-RPM prime movers, are noticeably louder.

In the initial design the battery box and air reservoirs were located forward of the fuel tank. In locomotives manufactured after 1977 these were relocated behind the tank. The battery box returned to its original location in the F40PH-2. The F40PH-2s delivered to Caltrain incorporated Southern Pacific Railroad-style headlights.

The designation &quot;F40PH&quot; stood for the following: &quot;F&quot; for the full-width cowl carbody, &quot;40&quot; as the locomotive is part of EMD&#x27;s 40-series (based on the GP40-2 freight locomotive), &quot;P&quot; for passenger service, and &quot;H&quot; for head-end power.

==History==

Amtrak ordered its first 30 EMD F40PHs on May 8, 1975. The first of the new locomotives entered service on April 9, 1976. Amtrak intended the locomotives for short routes such as the &quot;San Diegan&quot; in California and Northeast Corridor services in the then non-electrified route portion between New Haven, Connecticut and Boston, Massachusetts. 

The long-distance routes were protected by the then-new EMD SDP40F, described by J. David Ingles in late 1975 as the &quot;stars of Amtrak&#x27;s long-distance trains&quot;. However, two events led to a major change in thinking within Amtrak regarding the EMD SDP40F. The first event was a sharp decline in the mechanical reliability of the EMD SDP40F, including several derailments. The second event was the unusually harsh winter of 1976–1977, which sidelined many of Amtrak&#x27;s aging steam-heated coaches. Amtrak suspended numerous routes and pressed the new HEP-equipped Amfleet I coaches, designed for short runs, into service. The F40PH, with its built-in HEP generator, was the natural choice to haul these coaches. As problems with the EMD SDP40F mounted, Amtrak adopted the F40PH as its long-term solution nationwide for diesel engine service. 

In the spring of 1977 Amtrak traded 40 EMD SDP40Fs back to EMD. Components including the prime mover were installed into an EMD F40PH frame. The 40 rebuilt locomotives, designated F40PHR, were identical to new-build EMD F40PHs, incorporating the larger fuel tank and more powerful HEP generator which had become standard. 

Amtrak ultimately acquired 132 F40PHRs in this manner — which combined with new orders between 1975 and 1988 and with the purchase of six GMD F40PHs from GO Transit in 1990 — led to a fleet of 216 locomotives, the country&#x27;s largest fleet.

The first commuter rail operator to order F40PHs was Chicago&#x27;s Regional Transportation Authority (RTA), a forerunner to Metra, who ordered 74 between 1977 and 1983. Metra ordered 41 more between 1988 and 1992. Other agencies who bought the F40PH included the Massachusetts Bay Transit Authority (MBTA) (18), Caltrain (20), GO Transit (6), New Jersey Transit (17), and VIA Rail (59). Finally, the rail construction firm Speno ordered four. In total EMD built 449 locomotives, including the F40PHR trade-ins.

The F40PH performed well for Amtrak: at the start of the 1990s only four had been retired due to wrecks. The locomotive was at the center of Amtrak&#x27;s advertising. &quot;Trains&quot; magazine estimated that on average, each F40PH traveled as many as a year. 

Amtrak began replacing the F40PH with the GE Dash 8-32BWH in 1991, the GE P40DC in 1993, and the GE P42DC in 1996. All were retired by 2001 with the arrival of the last P42DC, and their last regular assignment was on the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; in December 2001. The Panama Canal Railway acquired several ex-Amtrak F40PHs for both freight and passenger service; the 480V head-end power matched the voltage used by the refrigeration in Maersk Sealand containers.

The EMD F40PH has continued to serve VIA Rail into the 21st century: between 2007 and 2012 VIA refurbished its entire fleet for CAD$100 million. The rebuild program included separate HEP generators, overhauled engines, a third headlight addition, cab reconditioning, additional safety horns at the front, and repainting into the newer VIA scheme. Rebuilt locomotive No. 6403, pulling the &quot;Canadian&quot; through the Rocky Mountains, was included on the back of the redesigned Canadian ten-dollar note in 2013 (The actual 6403 was later renumbered to 6459.) As of 2018, VIA has 53 such EMD F40PH locomotives in service. VIA started another round of rebuilding for 39 F40PH-2D locomotives in 2024, with the goal of extending their lifespan to 2035. These F40PH locomotives are now supplemented by GE P42DC locomotives delivered in 2001 and by Siemens SCV-42 locomotives delivered in 2023.
== Variants ==

The longevity of the F40PH has led to numerous conversions, rebuildings, and remanufacturings. In some instances new locomotives were assembled using EMD components. Several transit agencies lengthened their locomotives to include a separate HEP generator. These were designated F40PH-2C and F40PH-CAT where Cummins and Caterpillar generators were used, respectively. The F40PH-2C was considerably heavier than the standard design, weighing . The F40PH-2D, employed by Via Rail, had special customizations for operating in Canada, including ditch lights. Metra&#x27;s last 30 locomotives, designated F40PHM-2 (now rebuilt as F40PHM-3), were built with a sloped cab similar to the experimental EMD F69PHAC. The streamlined appearance acquired the nickname &quot;Winnebago.&quot; Speno&#x27;s four locomotives, designated F40PH-2M, were delivered without turbochargers, limiting power output to . The five EMD GP40 locomotives Morrison-Knudsen rebuilt for Tri-Rail in 1988 were designated F40PHL-2. Progress Rail rebuilt 41 Metra units with remanufactured engines, rebuilt traction motors and microprocessor traction control. These have been designated the F40PH-3. The MBTA&#x27;s dozen F40PHM-2C locomotives were built new using EMD components, as were the six F40PH-3C locomotives of the Altamont Commuter Express built by MotivePower. The MBTA&#x27;s F40PH-2C and F40PHM-2 locomotives were later rebuilt by MotivePower into F40PH-3C locomotives starting in 2019.

As Amtrak&#x27;s F40PH fleet was replaced by newer GE Genesis-series locomotives, Amtrak converted a number of the retired units into baggage/cab cars. Colloquially known as &quot;cabbages&quot; (a portmanteau of &quot;cab&quot; and &quot;baggage&quot;), and officially known as Non-Powered Control Units (NPCUs), these units had their diesel engines, traction motors, and main alternators removed, as well as a large roll-up door installed in the side (allowing the former engine compartment to be used for baggage). Amtrak converted 22 locomotives into cabbage cars between 1996 and 2007. Each converted unit was renumbered by prefixing &quot;90&quot; to its original number. In 2011, Amtrak converted F40PH No. 406 (later renumbered 90406) to an NPCU to enable push-pull operation of Amtrak&#x27;s 40th-anniversary exhibit train; in addition, a HEP generator was installed to supply auxiliary power. However, unlike other NPCUs, it resembles an operational F40PH externally.

Some F40PHs found their way into freight service, after suitable modifications. The F40M-2F, which runs on the San Luis and Rio Grande Railroad and formerly the Canadian American Railroad, was regeared for a maximum speed of and given an enlarged fuel tank. It was also fitted with a door, platform, and steps at the front. One unit, 450, was acquired by Western Maryland Scenic Railroad in 2018.

In 2023-2024, Rolling Stock Solutions, an American locomotive leasing company, rebuilt several F40PH locomotives for leasing to commuter rail operators and dubbed them the F40PH-4C. These feature a remanufactured Tier 0+ prime mover and a separate Tier 4 HEP generator, as well as microprocessor controls. The first of these locomotives, numbered &quot;1001&quot;, was unveiled in Boston in mid-October 2024.

== Original owners ==

Electro-Motive Division manufactured 475 F40PHs of all types between 1975 and 1992. The orders for GO Transit and VIA Rail Canada were built by General Motors Diesel (GMD), the company&#x27;s Canadian subsidiary. Morrison-Knudsen (M-K) and its successor MotivePower (MPI) remanufactured another 31 locomotives between 1988 and 1998.


== Preservation ==

Three ex-Amtrak F40PHs have been preserved:
* Ex-Amtrak 231 at the Nevada Southern Railway. It is owned by Dynamic Rail Preservation.
* Ex-Amtrak 281 at the California State Railroad Museum
* Ex-Amtrak 307 at the North Carolina Transportation Museum

Two Coaster F40PHM-2C locomotives have been preserved: 2103 at the Pacific Southwest Railway Museum and 2105 at the Southern California Railway Museum. In October 2024, the Southern California Railway Museum began fundraising in hopes of preserving a non-rebuilt Caltrain F40PH-2 locomotive.

<doc id="1081446" wikidata="Q6176479" url="?curid=1081446" title="Jehoash Inscription">
<text>The Jehoash Inscription is the name of a controversial artifact claimed to have been discovered in a construction site or Muslim cemetery near the Temple Mount of Jerusalem in 2001. 

The inscription describes repairs made to the temple in Jerusalem by Jehoash, son of King Ahaziah of Judah, and corresponds to the account in 2 Kings chapter 12. While some scholars support the antiquity of the patina, which in turn, strengthens the assertion that the inscription is authentic, the Israel Antiquities Authority has asserted that the inscription is a modern-day forgery.

==Text of the inscription==

===The tablet===


===Police investigation===
Israeli magazine correspondent Boaz Gaon reported that the Israel Antiquities Authority Theft Unit had focused their attention on the &quot;Jehoash Inscription&quot; as expensive bait to defraud a prominent collector in London. Israeli investigators linked a phony business card and a phone number to a Tel Aviv private eye who admitted that his employer was Oded Golan, the collector who owned the James Ossuary (another artifact of uncertain authenticity). Golan denied that he was the owner of the stone and claimed that the real owner was a Palestinian antiquities dealer who lived in an area under Palestinian Authority and could not be identified.

A March 19, 2003, article in reported that a court had issued a search warrant for Golan&#x27;s apartment, office and rented warehouse. The search brought forth allegedly incriminating documents and photographs of Golan beside the Jehoash Inscription. Under interrogation, Golan promised to reveal the location of the stone in exchange for immunity from prosecution.

Police then conducted a new search in a storage space that Golan had rented in Ramat Gan but had not originally disclosed to them. There the police found scores of artifacts, ancient seals and other inscriptions in various stages of production along with the tools to create the imitations. Under harsh questioning, Golan admitted that he knew about the Jehoash Inscription and promised to hand it over.

On March 14, 2012 Jerusalem Judge Aharon Farkash stated &quot;that there is no evidence that any of the major artifacts were forged, and that the prosecution failed to prove their accusations beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot; However, the court also ruled that it was unable to conclude that the Jehoash Inscription was authentic and noted that an associate of the accused forgers had confessed to aiding in its fabrication.

===Israel Antiquities Authority commission===
Limor Livnat, Israeli Minister of Culture, appointed a scientific commission to study the Jehoash tablet, as well as the James Ossuary.

The commission concluded that various mistakes in the spelling and the mixture of different alphabets indicated that this was a modern forgery. The stone was typical of western Cyprus and areas further west. Patina over the chiseled letters was different from that of the back of the stone and could easily be wiped off the stone by hand. In a press conference in Jerusalem on June 18, 2003 the Israel Antiquities Authority commission declared the inscription a modern forgery.

==External expert report==
A report, dated September 2005, was prepared by Wolfgang E. Krumbein of the Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg, Germany:

Krumbein concludes that &quot;Our preliminary investigations cannot prove the authenticity of the three objects beyond any doubt. Doubtlessly the patina is continuous in many places throughout surface and lettering grooves in the case of ossuary and tablet. On the other hand a proof of forgery is not given by the experts nominated by the Israel Antiquities Authority.&quot;

==Scholarly opinion==
Israeli historian Nadav Na&#x27;aman, who had theorized that the books of the Kings could be based on public inscriptions, opined that a forger could have used his (Na&#x27;aman&#x27;s) theory as a basis for a forgery. Frank Cross of Harvard University noted various errors in spelling and terminology. Yuval Goren of Tel-Aviv University demonstrated how the convincing fake could be produced by abrasive airbrushing. The stone itself remained hidden.

In an article published in 2007, Professor Chaim Cohen of Ben Gurion University wrote, &quot;both the nature of these contributions and the fact that they are completely new do support my long-standing position concerning the authenticity of the YI [Jehoash Inscription] as follows: &quot;In order to remove any possible doubt concerning my position as regards the authenticity of the YI, I wish to emphasize at the outset that I do not know whether or not this inscription is genuine. I do contend, however, that it can not be proven philologically to be a modern-day forgery. I would also add that if nevertheless the YI does turn out to be a forgery, then it is a most brilliant forgery in my opinion.&quot;&quot;

Victor Sasson responds that &quot;the sandstone inscription need not be the first and original record. If the stone itself cannot scientifically be dated to late ninth century B.C.E., then the could be a later copy of an original inscription... We do indeed have a reference to a possible renovation or restoration of an inscription. The author of the Tell Fakhriyah Assyrian-Aramaic bilingual inscription, dated to the mid-ninth century B.C.E., speaks of a possible future renovation of his inscription.&quot;

Prof. Ronny Reich who played a key role in the widely publicized case of the antiquities collector accused of fraud, and was one of the founders of the Israel Antiquities Authority stated &quot;Finally, allow me to play devil&#x27;s advocate and say that the inscription appears to me to be authentic, because it&#x27;s hard for me to believe that a forger (or group of forgers) could be so knowledgeable in all aspects of the inscription − that is, the physical, paleographic, linguistic and biblical ones − that they could produce such an object.&quot;

In a review article published in 2012, Rosenfeld, Feldman, Kronfeld and Krumbein summarized their earlier published studies and reviewed the expert testimony given at the trial of Oded Golan. They supported the judge&#x27;s conclusion that the forgery of the artifact could not be proved, and stated that the trial evidence confirmed their own earlier conclusion that it is most probably genuine.

In mid-2013, after judge Aaron Farkash of the Jerusalem District Court ruled that the state had failed to prove the artefact was a forgery, the state applied to the Supreme Court to obtain an official requiring the owner of the artefact, Golan, to consign it to the State without payment. The Supreme Court ruled against the Israel Antiquities Authority, returning the tablet and ossuary to Golan, who intends to publicly display both.

In February 2016, Professor Ed Greenstein, Bar-Ilan University, Israel, published an update review article, &quot;The So-Called Jehoash Inscription: A Post Mortem&quot;, commenting on the various scholarly analyses of the tablet and its inscription. Greenstein, a Semitic philologist, contends that the inscription contains &quot;anomalies—spellings and linguistic usages that did not jibe with what we know of ancient Hebrew writing and language.&quot; He also quotes paleographer Christopher Rollston for the assertion that the relative height of some letters is incorrect. Greenstein concludes:

<doc id="1081450" wikidata="Q5159145" url="?curid=1081450" title="Conde McCullough Memorial Bridge">
<text>The Conde B. McCullough Memorial Bridge, is a cantilever bridge that spans the Coos Bay on U.S. Route 101 near North Bend, Oregon. When completed in 1936 it was named the North Bend Bridge. In 1947, it was renamed in honor of Conde B. McCullough who died on May 5, 1946. This and ten other major bridges on the Oregon Coast Highway were designed under his supervision.

The Conde B. McCullough Memorial Bridge replaced ferries that had formerly crossed the bay. The bridge is outstanding for its attention to form and detail, and has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places in recognition of its design and cultural and economic importance.

==History==
Work started on what was then called the North Bend Bridge on July 10, 1934. Glenn S. Paxson, Acting State Bridge Engineer while McCullough took a leave of absence to work on projects in Central America, was the supervising engineer during construction. The resident engineer was Raymond Archibald until 1935, when he joined McCullough, then Dexter R. Smith. The Northwest Roads Company of Portland, Oregon, built the piers and the concrete structure. The steel sections of the bridge were built by the Virginia Bridge and Iron Company. The main piers are supported on piles driven into the bay&#x27;s bed. The main towers of the cantilever section were fabricated off-site and moved to the bridge site in four sections. Work on the cantilever arms moved out in both directions from the tower, with the shoreward arm keeping slightly ahead of the center arm so that it would rest on a temporary support structure to stabilize the bridge. The concrete arch sections were erected using timber falsework. The bridge opened in June 1936.

When the bridge was completed in 1936, it was the longest bridge in Oregon. It was the costliest of the Oregon Coast bridges at $2.14 million (equivalent to approximately $35 million in 2012). Because the five largest bridges on the coastal route were so expensive, their construction was largely funded by the Public Works Administration. The North Bend Bridge was dedicated to its designer, Conde McCullough, in 1947.

The McCullough Bridge was damaged on December 4, 1986, when a Swedish ship, the &quot;Elgaren&quot;, struck the bottom of the center span. The ship was entering the harbor on a day when the tide was above normal, and was unable to lower a vertically stowed ramp in time after the ramp&#x27;s mechanism malfunctioned. The bridge was closed for repairs.

==Description==
Because of the long spans and heavily trafficked shipping channel, a cantilever construction was deemed most suitable; a draw span was rejected because it would have to be opened too often. Consequently, the main span has of vertical clearance and is part of a steel cantilever span. The overall length, including the concrete approach spans, is . The approach spans are concrete arches more typical of McCullough&#x27;s designs. The main roadway is wide with sidewalks on either side. The main towers rise above the water surface, with curved sway bracing in a Gothic arch style. The open-spandrel concrete approach arches vary in span from to . The ends of the bridge are marked by pedestrian plazas meant to provide a viewing point for the bridge and to provide access to the shoreline. These plazas are detailed with Art Moderne motifs and are provided with built-in benches. The stairs descend in sweeping curves to the park below.

==Designation==
The city of North Bend, Oregon, uses images of the bridge extensively in public relations material. The bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on August 5, 2005.

<text>British Rail produced a variety of railbuses, both as a means of acquiring new rolling stock cheaply, and to provide economical services on lightly used lines.

==Terminology==

Railbuses are a very lightweight type of railcar designed specifically for passenger transport on little-used railway lines. As the name suggests, they share many aspects of their construction with a bus, usually having a bus body, or a modified bus body, and having four wheels on a fixed wheelbase, rather than bogies. Some units were equipped for operation as diesel multiple units.

==First generation==

In the late 1950s, British Rail tested a series of small railbuses, produced by a variety of manufacturers, for about £12,500 each (£261,000 at 2014 prices). These proved to be very economical (on test the Wickham bus was about ), but were somewhat unreliable. Most of the lines they worked on were closed following the Beeching Cuts and, being non-standard, they were all withdrawn in the mid-1960s, so they were never classified under the TOPS system.

In addition to those railbuses, BR ordered three for departmental (non-revenue earning) service. The full list of passenger and departmental units is set out below.

Engines:
* 79958/59, Gardner 6HLW of at 1,700 rpm
* 79960–62/64, Büssing, at 1,900 rpm
* 79963, AEC A220X
* 79965–69, Meadows 6HDT500 of at 1,800 rpm
* 79970–74, AEC, 
* 79975–79, AEC, 

==Leyland Experimental Vehicles==
British Rail returned to the idea of railbuses from the mid-1970s, and prototype four-wheel vehicles were developed jointly by British Leyland and the British Rail Research Division. These were named Leyland Experimental Vehicles (LEVs) and consisted of double-ended Leyland National bodyshells (chosen for their strength and cost-effective manufacturing) mounted on top of simple 2-axled railway chassis, which were a derivative of those used on the HSFV.

The LEVs spent a substantial amount of time abroad in the hope of attracting export orders, however none were ever made. Domestically, the LEVs were the predecessors of the Pacer DMUs, of which the Class 140 is its closest relative.

In total, five LEVs were built, which are listed below:

== Routes ==

== Preservation ==
A number of the BR railbuses, both first and second generation examples have survived into preservation, as follows:
Additionally, AC Cars railbus 79979 was preserved. It was the first of the railbuses to be delivered and spent all its working life in Scotland. In 1968, it was moved to Craigentinny where the chassis was scrapped, and it was used as a battery store. It was moved to make way for the TMD in 1977 and the grounded body sold to the Strathspey Railway in 1977. It was scrapped by MC Metals, Glasgow, in 1990.

<text>Silvio Passerini (1469 – 20 April 1529) was an Italian cardinal.

==Biography==
Born in Cortona, Passerini was taken under the wing of the powerful Florentine Medici family, after his father, Rosado, was imprisoned for too openly supporting the Medici cause during one of the reversals of power in 15th‑century Florence. Silvio was raised and educated at the court of Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici and became very close to Lorenzo&#x27;s son Giovanni whom he followed even to the battlefront where they fought side by side in France and were both made prisoners. As papal commissioner and envoy for Perugia and Umbria, Passerini amassed a considerable fortune.

When Giovanni became Pope Leo X in 1513, Silvio Passerini became cardinal-bishop of Cortona, with a diocese enlarged at the expense of the archdiocese of Florence and the diocese of Arezzo. He was made regent of Alessandro de&#x27; Medici, probably Giovanni&#x27;s son, as lord of Florence in Giovanni&#x27;s stead. A great period of wealth and power ensued: the papal historian Pastor noted 55 benefices for Cardinal Passerini recorded in Leo&#x27;s official register. In Cortona, Cardinal Passerini directed his diocese from the &quot;Palazzone&quot; on the height above Cortona. Originally the 12th-century &quot;Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo&quot;, who represented the &quot;tribune della plebe&quot; (the &quot;tribunes of the people&quot;), in 1514 the palace gave way to Cardinal Passerini, who rebuilt it in Renaissance taste c. 1521‑27, and left it, as the &quot;Palazzone Passerini&quot;, to his heirs (the last of whom donated it, in 1968, to the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, which now uses it to host prominent international meetings of mathematical researchers). It is richly frescoed with events of classical Roman history. While frescoing its chapel, the painter Luca Signorelli fell from the scaffolding and died. Many of the other frescoes are the work of Il Papacello and his assistants.

The Cardinal was a great Renaissance patron. He built three more personal villas: one in the commune of Bettolle, one in Petrignano and the third in Piazzano, the closest to his official residence. He recognized the talent of the sixteen-year-old Giorgio Vasari of Arezzo and supported him to study in Florence. At Florence he commissioned a tapestry from cartoons by Andrea del Sarto and Raffaellino del Garbo, which is conserved in the diocesan museum at Cortona. With the young Alessandro and Ippolito de&#x27; Medici in tow, he attended the first performance of Niccolò Machiavelli&#x27;s comedy &quot;La Mandragola&quot;, Vasari related.

When the Medici fell in 1527, Silvio Passerini&#x27;s loyalty toward them also forced him to flee from Florence and Cortona. He died at Città di Castello. His body was later transferred to Rome and buried at his titular parish, San Lorenzo in Lucina.

<doc id="1081471" wikidata="Q873568" url="?curid=1081471" title="Luis María Argaña">
<text>Luis María del Corazón de Jesús Dionisio Argaña Ferraro (October 3, 1932 – March 23, 1999) was a Paraguayan politician and jurist. A prominent and influential member of the Colorado Party, he was a Supreme Court judge, unsuccessfully ran for the Colorado Party&#x27;s nomination for president in the 1993 election and eventually was elected Vice-President in the 1998 election, but was assassinated seven months after assuming office in March 1999 at a time when it appeared likely that he would inherit the presidency from Raúl Cubas, who was on the verge of being impeached. The incident and its aftermath is known in Paraguay as &quot;Marzo paraguayo&quot; (&quot;the Paraguayan March&quot;). An airport in Paraguay, Dr. Luis María Argaña International Airport, is named for him.

==Career==
Argaña graduated in law and social sciences from the Universidad Nacional de Asunción in 1958. He became a Professor at the University, and entered politics, becoming a member of the Chamber of Deputies of Paraguay. He also became a judge, and was President of the Supreme Court of Paraguay (1983 - 1988).

During 1989-1990 he served as Foreign Minister.

Argaña was a judge during Paraguay&#x27;s long-lasting military dictatorship under Alfredo Stroessner. He has been accused of turning a blind eye to cases of torture and political killings. Stroessner dissident Joel Filártiga accused Argaña of blocking the screening in Paraguay of the 1991 TV movie &quot;One Man&#x27;s War&quot;, depicting Filártiga&#x27;s search for justice for the 1976 death of his son at the hands of Stroessner&#x27;s secret police.


Despite his long identification with Stroessner, Argaña was a member of the &quot;traditionalist&quot; faction of the Colorados, which had come to favor a more humane way of ruling the country. Soon after stepping down from the Supreme Court, he accused Stroessner of running a police state, and claimed that &quot;imposters&quot; had taken over the party. He went on to say that those who persecuted defenseless women or attacked priests were not really Paraguayans, let alone Colorados. He soon emerged as the de facto leader of the traditionalist faction. Nonetheless, during the democratic era, Argaña was criticised for bringing Stroessner&#x27;s era officials back to political life through his faction Colorado Reconciliation Movement, and uring his bid to become the Colorado candidate for president in the 1993 elections, he publicly vowed that if elected, he would allow Stroessner to return from exile.

==1993 election==
Argaña ran a bid for the Colorado Party&#x27;s nominee for president in the 1993 election. Although leading opinion polling at one point, he lost the Colorado Party primary to Juan Carlos Wasmosy who went on to win the 1993 general election. In January 2008, however, Paraguayan congressman Juan Carlos &quot;Calé&quot; Galaverna admitted to committing electoral fraud in the December 1992 Colorado primary elections to prevent Argaña from winning.

==1998 election as Vice-President==
He tried again to obtain the party&#x27;s presidential nomination for the 1998 election, losing in a bitterly contested primary election against General Lino Oviedo. Due to Oviedo&#x27;s involvement in a failed coup attempt in 1996, Oviedo was imprisoned before the 1998 general election. Oviedo&#x27;s running mate, Raúl Cubas, replaced Oviedo on the Colorado ticket, but lacked the widespread support that Oviedo commanded. Argaña was selected as Cubas&#x27; running mate, the pair subsequently being elected to office by a wide margin.

==Death==

On March 23, 1999, Argaña was shot and killed by an armed group traveling in a car that intercepted the vehicle in which Argaña, his bodyguard and his driver were traveling. The assassins blocked the street, stopping Argaña&#x27;s vehicle. They got out in an organized manner and shot repeatedly at the bodyguard, the driver and Argaña, who would die from multiple shots, in addition to his bodyguard. The driver survived the attack. The over-the-air television channel SNT showed the images exclusively.

=== Trial ===
On October 23, 1999, Pablo Vera Esteche was arrested in Paraguay. He said the murder, for which he and two other gunmen were paid a total of $300,000, was authorised by Cubas and Oviedo. Vera Esteche was sentenced to 20 years on October 24 (reduced to 18 years four years later). His accomplices were also jailed for lengthy sentences.

<text>Combe Down is a village on the outskirts of Bath, England, in the Bath and North East Somerset unitary authority area, within the ceremonial county of Somerset.

Combe Down village consists predominantly of 18th- and 19th-century Bath stone-built villas, terraces and workers&#x27; cottages; the post World War II Foxhill estate of former and present council housing; a range of Georgian, Victorian and 20th-century properties along both sides of North Road and Bradford Road; and the 21st-century Mulberry Park development on the site of former Ministry of Defence offices.

== Location ==
Combe Down sits on a ridge above Bath, approximately to the south of the city centre. The village is adjoined to the north by large areas of natural woodland (Fairy Wood, Long Wood, Klondyke Copse and Rainbow Wood) with public footpaths offering views overlooking the city. Parts of these woods are owned and managed by Bath &amp; Northeast Somerset Council, but the majority are owned and managed by the National Trust; the Bath Skyline trail runs north of the woods. To the south of the village are views of the Midford Valley.

&quot;Combe&quot; or &quot;coombe&quot; is a word meaning a steep-sided valley derived from Old English &quot;cumb&quot; and possibly from the same Brythonic source as the Welsh cwm. &quot;Down&quot; comes from the Old English &quot;dūn&quot; or &quot;dūne&quot;, shortened from adūne ‘downward’, from the phrase of dūne ‘off the hill’.

== Governance ==

== Amenities ==

Combe Down has many local amenities including schools, churches, shops, local societies and pubs. It has two allotment sites: 64 plots on a privately owned site at Church Road, established in 1895, and ten plots at Foxhill owned by the parish council.

The local state primary school is Combe Down CEVC (Church of England Voluntary Controlled) Primary School, housed partly in a log cabin imported from Finland. The nearest state secondary school (with sixth form) is Ralph Allen School. The independent Monkton Combe School is in the nearby village of Monkton Combe while its prep school, pre-prep and nursery are all in Combe Down village. Prior Park College, an independent Catholic secondary school, is adjacent to the village.

The centre of the village has a range of shops and small businesses. The post office closed in 2006 despite public opposition and the nearest post office branch is now inside a grocery store in a row of shops on the Bradford Road.

There is an Anglican church (Holy Trinity) and a non-conformist chapel (Union Chapel). A Roman Catholic church (Saint Peter and Saint Paul) is on the edge of the village, adjacent to the Foxhill estate.

Combe Down has two rugby union clubs and a cricket club, a children&#x27;s nursery, a doctors&#x27; surgery and a dentist as well as an active Cub and Scout Group (10th Bath) with its own Scouts&#x27; Hut. There are several societies, including an active local history group (the Combe Down Heritage Society), a branch of the Women&#x27;s Institute and two art groups.

There is a private hospital, Bath Clinic (owned by Circle Health Group) on Claverton Down Road, based at Longwood House, the former home of the Mallet family of Mallet Antiques. Margaret Mary Mallett (1882–1959), who lived at Longwood House, and her daughters Margaret Elizabeth Mallett (1905–1991) and Barbara Penelope Mallett Lock (1896–1978) donated of land on Combe Down and Claverton Down including Rainbow Wood farm, Klondyke Copse, Fairy Wood and Bushey Norwood to the National Trust. Opposite the hospital is a 4-star hotel and health club, Combe Grove Manor, with of gardens and woodland.

A public open space (Firs Field) incorporates the village war memorial and a play area with children&#x27;s play equipment. Three parcels of land make up the Firs Field open space, two of which are under the control of the local Council. The deeds state that the Firs Field is intended for the recreation of the residents of Combe Down in perpetuity. Firs Field was restored to meadowland status following the successful completion of the stone mine stabilisation works in 2010. A residents&#x27; group (The Friends of Firs Field) exists to ensure the appropriate representation of local residents&#x27; interests with regard to the management of the field. In 2015 Firs Field was granted &quot;commemorative&quot; status and designated an official Fields in Trust &quot;Centenary Field&quot;.

In July 2014, the Ralph Allen CornerStone was opened. It is run by a charity, the Combe Down Stone Legacy Trust, as a sustainable building and educational centre. The Combe Down Heritage Society has museum-standard secure archiving space in the basement where it catalogues and stores unique local heritage material, and which can be accessed by researchers.

There are daily bus services to the village from Bath city centre. The privately owned Bath &#x27;circular tour&#x27; bus passes the outskirts of the village and down Ralph Allen Drive on its route to the city centre. The Bath Circular bus passes through Combe Down and caters for students travelling to the University of Bath and Bath Spa University.

== History ==
It is believed that a Roman villa was situated on the southern slopes of the village somewhere below Belmont Road, the site of which was discovered in the 1850s. An inscription on a stone recovered from the area reads &quot;PRO SALVTE IMP CES M AVR ANTONINI PII FELICIS INVICTI AVG NAEVIVS AVG LIB ADIVT PROC PRINCIPIA RVINA OPRESS A SOLO RESTITVIT&quot;. This can be translated as: &quot;For the health of Imperator Caesar Marcus Aurelius Antoninus Pius Felix Invictus Augustus, Naevius the imperial freedman, helped to restore from its foundations the procurator&#x27;s headquarters which had broken down in ruins.&quot; It is thought to date from AD 212–222. Many finds from the site were taken to the Somerset County Museum at Taunton.

John Leland, the 16th century antiquarian and traveller, noted some stone mining activity in Combe Down as he passed by.

By 1700, small open stone quarries were operating on Combe Down. Most of the land and the quarries were purchased by Ralph Allen in 1726 but there was as yet little habitation.

In 1791, John Collinson describes Combe Down as still undeveloped:
From their 1924 history of Combe Down, D. Lee Pitcairn and Rev. Alfred Richardson state that:
The population increased from 1,600 in 1841, to 2,372 in 1901, and was 5,419 in 2011.

== Stone mines and quarries ==
Combe Down village sits above an area of redundant 18th and 19th century stone quarries, many of which were owned and developed by Ralph Allen in the 1720s. These quarries were fully infilled and stabilised during a central government-funded project which took place between 2005 and 2010. Over 40 quarry sites have been identified on Combe Down. Only one working quarry (Upper Lawn Quarry) remains on the edge of the village, located off Shaft Road. This supplies high quality Bath stone to the city and across the UK.

John Leland, the 16th century antiquarian and traveller, wrote in the 1500s that he approached Bath from Midford &quot;...And about a Mile farther I can to a Village and passd over a Ston Bridge where ranne a litle broke there &amp; they caullid Midford-Water..2 good Miles al by Mountayne and Quarre and litle wood in syte...&quot; which could be a reference to quarrying around Horsecombe Vale, between Midford and Combe Down.

The mines at Combe Down were Oolitic (oolite) limestone mines. Stone was extracted by the &quot;room and pillar&quot; method, by which chambers were mined out, leaving pillars of stone to support the roof. The Bath stone used for many of the buildings in Bath – as well as for other important buildings around the United Kingdom including Buckingham Palace – was mined from beneath and around Combe Down. Many of these workings were once owned by the eighteenth century entrepreneur Ralph Allen (1694–1764).
 The mines were closed in the 19th century but building work continued above ground, with some roads and houses eventually resting on only a thin crust – in places between only one and two metres deep – above large underground cavities with inadequate support.

A five-year central government-funded project began in late 2005 to stabilise and fill the abandoned mine workings. Bath and North East Somerset Council approved the planning application in June 2003 and approximately 760 village properties were included within its boundary. All mine workings inside the boundary of the planning application were stabilised using foam concrete to satisfy a 100-year design life while ensuring archaeologically important areas and bat habitats were protected. In some hydrologically sensitive areas, &quot;stowing&quot; – an infill with limestone aggregate – was undertaken. Archaeologically important areas were filled with sand and new bat caves and tunnels were created.

The £154.6million grant for the works came from the Land Stabilisation Programme which was set up by the government in 1999 to deal with &quot;abandoned non-coal mine workings which are likely to collapse and threaten life and property&quot; and managed by English Partnerships, the national regeneration agency. The total amount included £22.7m which had already been used for emergency stabilisation work before the approval of the main project. Several public art projects celebrated the completion of the stabilisation works.

== Foxhill Estate and Mulberry Park ==
From 1935 to 2011, the Admiralty (later part of the Ministry of Defence) owned a site called Foxhill (previously a farm) on the Bradford Road. In 2013, the Curo housing organisation purchased the site where it is developing 700 new homes (151 of those to be social homes) with open spaces and community facilities, to be called Mulberry Park. Foxhill already had nearly 900 homes, and in 2014 Curo wanted to redevelop Queens Drive, Kewstoke Road, local shops and Sedgemoor Road. In 2018, Curo decided not to demolish the Foxhill Estate and instead will improve the existing rented properties on the estate. The development of Mulberry Park continued and is set to complete in 2024, although many properties are already occupied and a school and community centre are in full operation.

== Combe Down railway tunnel ==
Combe Down Tunnel was opened in 1874 and emerges below the southern slopes of the village. It was once the UK&#x27;s longest railway tunnel () without intermediate ventilation. The tunnel now forms part of the £1.8 million Two Tunnels Greenway walking and cycling path which opened on 6 April 2013. At over a mile long, the Combe Down tunnel is the longest cycling tunnel in Britain and features an interactive light and sound installation as well as mobile phone coverage. Its custodian is Wessex Water.

== Jewish burial ground ==
The Jewish burial ground is a site of historic value on Bradford Road and is one of only fifteen in the country to survive from the Georgian period. While the burial ground suffered a period of neglect since it ceased to be used in the early 20th century, much remains intact to serve as an important reminder of Bath&#x27;s historic Jewish community. It dates from 1812, and the last recorded burial was in 1942. The site contains a small building, once thought to be a prayer house (Ohel), but more recent research by the Friends of Bath Jewish Burial Ground. who manage the site, have shown that it was a cottage used by the caretakers of the burial ground, and not used for religious purposes. English Heritage gave the Burial Ground a Grade II listing in 2006. The site contains two chest tombs and some fifty gravestones, dating from between 1842 and 1921, with both Hebrew and English inscriptions. Funds to restore the cottage, conserve the grave stones, repair the boundary wall, replace the gates and develop interpretation of the site have been obtained from a number of charitable sources and a series of restoration works have been undertaken in the period 2015-2022. The site is opened for public visiting several times a year and private access can be arranged by appointment through the Friends.

== De Montalt Mill ==
The De Montalt paper mill stood on the southern slopes of the village during the 19th century; it gradually fell into picturesque ruin until it was converted into housing during 2007. The mill was built on land owned by Thomas Ralph Maude, Viscount Hawarden (1767–1807) in the early 19th century and was owned by John Bally (1773 – 1854), (a bookseller in Milsom Street in Bath), William Allan or Ellan (1781 – 1832) and George Steart (d.1837), all trading as paper-makers under the name of John Bally &amp; Co.

A print dating from the 1850s shows the mill which then possessed the largest water wheel in England, measuring in diameter. It has subsequently been discovered that most of the coloured papers used by J. M. W. Turner (1775–1851) for a good number of his approximately twenty thousand drawings and watercolours were made at De Montalt Mill. The collection is now housed in The Turner Bequest at the Tate Gallery, London. The paper was of a very high standard and the watercolour boards were made without being pasted together which ensured they remained free from mildew; however, despite the early success of the business, it failed in 1834
. The premises were then sold to wholesale stationer William Jennings Allen (1807 – 1839). After his death it was sold to Charles Middleton Kernot (1807 – 1876) to be used as a ‘manufactory of patent interlocked and dovetailed felted cloths’. By 1859 it was used for a laundry run by the Bath Washing Company Ltd. and later used for a variety of purposes including market gardening (1871); and cabinet making from (1875) until the lease expired in 1905 and it closed. In the 20th century cows and pigs were being reared on the site.

Various parts of the mill have Grade II listed building status, including the southern range which consisted of the apprentice shops and stores, the main east block which was the printing works where notes were printed for the Bank of England – later converted to cabinet manufacturing and the chimney. De Montalt, an Italianate villa set in the grounds is also grade II listed.

The mill and its associated buildings were converted to residential use during 2007, with the main mill building being converted into four apartments. Elements of the conversion featured in the Channel 4 television programme &quot;Grand Designs&quot;.

== Local flora ==
A local woodland wild flower is the Bath Asparagus, also known as the Spiked Star of Bethlehem (Ornithogalum pyrenaicum). The flowers appear in June after the leaves die; the leaves resemble bluebell leaves but are a softer green and not as glossy. The flowering spike is up to one metre high. At the unopened stage the flowers used to be gathered in small quantities as a fresh vegetable by local people; it was also occasionally sold in local markets, but picking the flowers today is not encouraged as wild asparagus is becoming rare. According to research carried out by Avon Wildlife Trust the plant is found throughout Europe but has only a limited UK distribution. It is possible that the flower was first brought to the Bath area as seeds carried on the wheels and hooves of Roman vehicles and animals.

&quot;Allium ursinum&quot;, also known as Ramsons or wild garlic, is abundant in the National Trust woodlands adjacent to Combe Down during the spring.2015.

== Grade I and II listed buildings on Combe Down ==
There are 79 Grade I and Grade II listed buildings – a building officially designated as being of special architectural, historical, or cultural significance – on Combe Down, the earliest dating from 1729 and the latest from 1909. They are from three main phases of building activity.

The first phase was c. 1700–1742. These are the buildings at Combe Grove, and the buildings commissioned by Ralph Allen at Prior Park and at De Montalt Place on Church Road.

The second phase was c. 1800 – c. 1820. These are mainly buildings along Combe Road, Summer Lane, and Church Road at Isabella Place and from Claremont House to Hopecote Lodge, which were built soon after the death of Cornwallis Maude, 1st Viscount Hawarden (1729–1803) who died with substantial debts which led to the break-up of the De Montalt estate in Bath, as speculators in property and mining took the opportunity.

The third phase was Victorian, from c. 1830 to 1860. Combe Down had become known as a place for convalescence and &quot;good air&quot; (away from polluted cities) and, being only about from Bath, was perfect for this as well as for middle class professionals. These are mainly buildings along North Road, The Avenue, Belmont Road and Church Road east of Hopecote Lodge.

== Notable residents ==
Henry John Patch (better known as Harry Patch, the &quot;Last Fighting Tommy&quot;) was born in Combe Down in 1898; both his father and grandfather were Combe Down stonemasons. His family home is still in existence in Gladstone Road. Patch was briefly the third oldest man in the world and the last trench veteran of World War I, a status which earned him international fame during the early 21st century. He died in July 2009, aged 111, by which time he was the last soldier to have fought in the trenches during World War One as well as the second last surviving British war veteran and one of four surviving soldiers from the conflict worldwide. His memoir &quot;The Last Fighting Tommy&quot; (published in 2007) records his Combe Down childhood in some detail. His funeral cortège passed through Combe Down village on its way to his burial in Monkton Combe churchyard.

Herbert Lambert (1881–1936), society portrait photographer and harpsichord and clavichord maker.

Frederic Weatherly (1848–1929), the composer of the song Danny Boy, lived at Grosvenor Lodge (now renamed St Christopher ) in Belmont Road during the second decade of the 20th century.

<text>Compute! (), often stylized as COMPUTE!, is an American home computer magazine that was published from 1979 to 1994. Its origins can be traced to 1978 in Len Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;PET Gazette&quot;, one of the first magazines for the Commodore PET computer. In its 1980s heyday, &quot;Compute!&quot; covered all major platforms, and several single-platform spinoffs of the magazine were launched. The most successful of these was &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, which catered to VIC-20, Commodore 64, and later the Commodore 128 computer users.

Compute provided programs for users to type in, usually in Basic. These included programs such as games and utilities. Sometimes they would provide programs written in assembly to be typed out in a utility called MLX. They also provided technical advice in some of their articles.

==History==
&quot;Compute!&quot; original goal was to write about and publish programs for all of the computers that used some version of the MOS Technology 6502 CPU. It started out in 1979.

ABC Publishing acquired Compute! Publications in May 1983 for $18 million in stock, and raised circulation of the magazine from 200,000 to 420,000 by the end of the year. &quot;Compute!&#x27;s Gazette&quot;, for Commodore computers, began publishing that year. &quot;Compute!&quot; claimed in 1983 that it published more type-in programs &quot;in each issue than any magazine in the industry&quot;. A typical issue would feature a large-scale program for one of the covered platforms, with smaller programs for one or more platforms filling the remainder of the issue&#x27;s type-ins.

Editors of the magazine included Robert Lock, Richard Mansfield, Charles Brannon, and Tom R. Halfhill. Noted columnists included Jim Butterfield, educator Fred D&#x27;Ignazio and science fiction author Orson Scott Card.

With the May 1988 issue, the magazine was redesigned and the type-in program listings were dropped.

In 1990, &quot;Compute!&quot; was out of publication for several months when it was sold to General Media, publishers at the time of &quot;Omni&quot; and &quot;Penthouse&quot; magazines, in May of that year. General Media changed the title of the magazine to &quot;COMPUTE&quot;, without the exclamation point, and the cover design was changed to resemble that of &quot;OMNI&quot; magazine. Ziff Davis bought &quot;Compute!&quot;″s assets, including its subscriber list, in 1994. General Media had ceased its publication before the sale.

==Former employees==
After &quot;Compute! Publications&quot;, Robert Lock started another company, Signal Research, which was among the first to publish magazines and books about computer games. Among the biggest magazine published by Signal Research was &quot;Game Players&quot;, a magazine devoted to Nintendo, PC, and Sega gaming. He also wrote the book &quot;The Traditional Potters of Seagrove, N.C.&quot; in 1994, and started &quot;Southern Arts Journal&quot; a quarterly magazine featuring essays, fiction and poetry about all things Southern, in 2005, but ceased publication after only four issues the next year.

Tom R. Halfhill went on to become a senior editor at &quot;Byte&quot;. He is currently a technology analyst at The Linley Group and a senior editor of &quot;Microprocessor Report&quot;.

David D. Thornburg continued to work in the field of educational technology and was involved in projects both in the US and Brazil.

Charles G. Brannon moved to the San Francisco Bay Area to work as a Project Manager for Epyx, before moving back to Greensboro and working for his father&#x27;s insurance wholesaler company Group US as an Information Technology Manager. He has retired as of 2016.

<doc id="1081476" wikidata="Q7096801" url="?curid=1081476" title="Operation Bertram">
<text>Operation Bertram was a Second World War deception operation practised by the Allied forces in Egypt led by Bernard Montgomery, in the months before the Second Battle of El Alamein in 1942. Bertram was devised by Dudley Clarke to deceive Erwin Rommel about the timing and location of the Allied attack. The operation consisted of physical deceptions using dummies and camouflage, designed and made by the British Middle East Command Camouflage Directorate led by Geoffrey Barkas. These were accompanied by electromagnetic deceptions codenamed Operation Canwell, using false radio traffic. All of these were planned to make the Axis believe that the attack would take place to the south, far from the coast road and railway, about two days later than the real attack.

Bertram consisted of the creation of the appearance of army units where none existed and in concealing armour, artillery and &quot;matériel&quot;. Dummy tanks and guns were made mainly of local materials including calico and palm-frond hurdles. Real tanks were disguised as trucks, using light &quot;Sunshield&quot; canopies. Field guns and their limbers were also disguised as trucks, their real wheels visible, under a simple box-shaped &quot;Cannibal&quot; canopy to give the shape of a truck. Petrol cans were stacked along the sides of existing revetted trenches, hidden in the shadows. Food was stacked in piles of boxes and draped with camouflage nets to resemble trucks.

Trucks were parked openly in the tank assembly area for some weeks. Real tanks were similarly parked openly, far behind the front. Two nights before the attack, the tanks replaced the trucks, being covered with &quot;Sunshields&quot; before dawn. The tanks were replaced that same night with dummies in their original positions, so the armour remained seemingly two or more days&#x27; journey behind the front line. To reinforce the impression that the attack was not ready, a dummy water pipeline was constructed, at an apparent rate of per day. Some days&#x27; worth remained to be built at the time of the attack; dummy tanks, guns and supplies were constructed to the south.

After the battle, the captured German &quot;Panzerarmee&quot; general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery that he had believed the Allies had at least one more armoured division than they did and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel&#x27;s stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. Bertram had succeeded; when announcing the victory at El Alamein in the House of Commons, Winston Churchill praised the camouflage operation.

== Planning ==

Bertram was devised by Dudley Clarke to deceive Erwin Rommel about the timing and location of the expected allied attack by the Eighth Army. It consisted of physical deceptions using dummies and camouflage, concealing real movements, in particular of Montgomery&#x27;s armour. Bertram was accompanied by electromagnetic deceptions codenamed &quot;Operation Canwell&quot; using false radio traffic. The front line was relatively short: it stretched from the Mediterranean Sea in the north, near El Alamein railway station, to the effectively impassable Qattara Depression in the south, a distance of only about 30 miles. It was therefore clear to the enemy that the attack must come in this space, and since the only road was in the north, surprise and full-scale attack in any other location might have been thought unlikely. The deceptions were planned to make the enemy believe that the attack would take place to the south, far from the coast road and railway, and about two days later than the real attack.

Soon after his arrival on 8 August 1942, the new Middle East commander, Harold Alexander, visited Geoffrey Barkas&#x27;s camouflage unit at Helwan to assess its ability to implement Bertram. He looked at everything intently, but seemed most interested in the woodworking shop.

On 16 September 1942, Freddie de Guingand, Montgomery&#x27;s chief of staff, summoned Barkas and Tony Ayrton to Eighth Army headquarters near Borg-el-Arab. He told them this was to be top secret, that Alexander had been impressed by his visit to Helwan, and that he wanted Camouflage&#x27;s advice. He introduced Charles Richardson, who worked for Dudley Clarke&#x27;s secretive &#x27;A&#x27; Force and was to implement the deception Montgomery needed. Richardson had not been trained in deception planning, given the accelerated training of staff officers in 1940, nor had he ever prepared a deception plan before. He was determined it should succeed, since, as he wrote, &quot;if it failed it would do far more damage than having no plan at all&quot;. De Guingand outlined the basic plan: an attack in the north, along the line of the coast road, with a feint some 20 miles to the south. The tanks would take two days to move into battle position from their forming-up positions. Engineering work was already under way. He then astonished them by asking them to hide the hundreds of tanks and field guns, and the thousands of tons of &quot;matériel&quot;, that were to be used for the decisive attack at El Alamein. Barkas had been hoping for such an opportunity, and now he was being offered the chance to camouflage perhaps the largest desert battle ever attempted.

Barkas and Ayrton went out onto the beach dunes to sit and think. Barkas recalled the sacked Jasper Maskelyne, a stage magician who had briefly worked for him, saying he needed his vanishing tricks now. Ayrton agreed, suggesting they use Sunshields to make the tanks seem to be trucks, and &quot;vice versa&quot;. By the end of that afternoon they had typed up a plan and presented it to de Guingand and Richardson. They proposed to create two dummy armoured brigades to deploy in the south. They would give the appearance of not being ready by making it seem the tanks had not moved from their forming-up areas (Murrayfield and Melting Pot). Dummy tanks would replace them there; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area.

Richardson asked if they could use something like Steven Sykes&#x27;s dummy railhead which had worked so well at Misheifa. Barkas answered that he intended to build a dummy water pipeline to go down south, and to be obviously not ready.

Within two weeks Barkas&#x27;s plan was accepted, but with one change requested by Montgomery: the dummy armour was doubled to represent a whole armoured corps of over 600 vehicles. Richardson integrated the camouflage plan with the main plans: in Barkas&#x27;s words, Richardson &quot;amplified it a great deal to fit in with all the other major considerations, which he knew and I didn&#x27;t.&quot;

Barkas, a former film director, was set to work &quot;on the task of providing props for the biggest &#x27;film production&#x27; on which I ever expect to be engaged&quot;. Work began on 27 September, giving four weeks before the day of the attack.

== Execution ==

The operation had two aims: creating the appearance of army units where none existed and concealing the real armour, artillery and &quot;matériel&quot; at the front. Barkas observed that &quot;the concealment of the huge assembly of the Armoured Corps was essentially a piece of military planning by Army Headquarters, with Camouflage carrying out certain specific tasks&quot;. Since it would be impossible to hide the existence of such a large number of vehicles, especially of tanks in the Martello area, Barkas planned instead to make the vehicles there quite obvious, as trucks, well before battle. The tanks, too, would be openly displayed, far behind the battle front. When the enemy saw that nothing seemed to be happening, the trucks would be replaced by tanks, masquerading as trucks. That meant that the tanks, too, would have to be seen not to move so they would all be replaced with dummies. An unprecedented and &quot;formidable&quot; number of dummies were required: more than 400 tanks, 100 guns, and nearly 2000 soft-skinned vehicles.

Different techniques were used for each task. The British Army had intentionally recruited designers, architects and artists for camouflage work. Tony Ayrton was a painter, son of the architect Maxwell Ayrton. Brian Robb had arrived more informally: he joined the army as a private, but Barkas noticed him and made use of his skills as an artist, teacher and illustrator by having him speedily promoted to Staff Lieutenant. Ayrton and Robb became Barkas&#x27;s &quot;GSO2&quot;s, his senior staff officers, and they supervised the camouflage schemes used in Operation Bertram.

Three companies of Pioneers were assigned to Barkas&#x27;s command to carry out the physical work of making the thousands of dummies. They came respectively from East Africa, Mauritius and the Seychelles. One company worked the standard bed frame palm hurdles into the required shapes and fixed them together to make tank bodies, turrets and other dummy vehicle elements. The second company prepared hessian covers for the vehicle elements. The third company painted and prepared the dummies to the required degree of realism. Since the different Pioneer companies did not like one another, Barkas moved their camps as far apart as possible. To help maintain security, a NAAFI canteen was set up exclusively for the camouflage workers, to help keep everyone in camp.

=== &quot;Sunshields&quot; for tanks ===

Real tanks were disguised as trucks, using light &quot;Sunshield&quot; canopies. They were made in two halves, which hinged on the sides of the tank. A half could be lifted by two men and fitted or removed in a few minutes. Different models of Sunshield existed to fit the various types of Allied tank which included Crusaders, Valentines, Grants and Shermans, mimicking different kinds of truck.

A total of 722 Sunshields were deployed in Bertram. According to Peter Forbes, &quot;Sunshields were the most successful and the most exhilaratingly mimetic of the deceptions practised in the desert.&quot;

The idea for the Sunshield came from Commander-in-Chief Middle East, General Wavell himself. He sketched a tank mimicking a truck in a handwritten note:

The note was passed to Barkas, in his words &quot;not long after my arrival in Middle East... The whole idea was there. It was only a matter of design, development, and arrangements for manufacture.&quot; The first heavy wooden prototype was made in 1941 by Jasper Maskelyne, who gave it the name Sunshield. 12 men were needed to lift it, and it disintegrated on its first trial run on a Crusader tank. However, Barkas had enough confidence in the Sunshield to ask for a lighter version. The Mark 2 Sunshield was made of canvas stretched over a light steel tube frame. It was strong, light, and cheap to manufacture. And crucially, from as low as 500 feet, RAF pilots found that the Mark 2 convincingly resembled a truck.

The 722 Sunshields were carefully pre-positioned in the Martello tank-holding area near El Imayid railway station. Each was numbered. The crew of each tank was brought to Martello, told their number, shown where they would be parked and taught how to put up and take down the Sunshield, which they would have to do at night.

=== &quot;Cannibals&quot; for field guns ===

Field guns and their limbers were disguised as British &quot;3-tonner&quot; trucks, under the direction of Tony Ayrton and Brian Robb. They arranged for the long towing pole of the limber to overlap the trail of the gun and then put up a dummy truck canopy over both. The real wheels of both the gun and the limber added to the realism of the dummy truck, as they remained visible under the canopy, exactly where the truck&#x27;s wheels ought to be. The technique was named &quot;Cannibal&quot; because the gun and limber were &quot;eaten up&quot; by the canopy.

The extremely distinctive Morris C8 four wheel drive tractors, known as &quot;Quads&quot; that pulled the 25 pounder guns and their limbers also had to be disguised, as their presence directly advertised the presence of artillery. They were more simply camouflaged, again as trucks with real wheels, by draping a net over four poles tied to the sides of the vehicle and braced with guy ropes.

A total of 360 Cannibals were deployed in Bertram. The rear artillery concentration area and the forward artillery barrage area near El Alamein station were named Cannibal I and Cannibal II, respectively, after the camouflage technique. In Barkas&#x27;s own words

=== Real and dummy &quot;matériel&quot; ===

Petrol cans were stacked along the sides of existing revetted trenches near El Alamein railway station. It was found by experiment that when they were hidden in the shadows in that way, they were invisible from the air and so 2,000 tons of petrol were thus stored. Over 100,000 four-gallon petrol tins were stacked in the 100 stone-faced slit trenches.

Food was stacked in piles of boxes, and draped with camouflage nets to resemble trucks: a large box-shaped pile for the truck&#x27;s body, and smaller piles for the truck&#x27;s cab and engine. That meant that attractive materials including sugar and cigarettes were dispersed around the desert instead of being in readily-guarded camps. The most desirable items were therefore put in the &quot;trucks&quot; in the middle of the areas and hidden in the middle of each stack, and army command accepted the risk of theft.

While the real supplies in the north were carefully hidden, matching dummy supplies had to be created in the south. In the area named Brian after camouflage officer Brian Robb, over 700 dummy stacks, representing food, petrol, ammunition and other supplies, were constructed.

Static dummy tanks and guns were made mainly of local materials including calico and palm-frond hurdles. Some dummy tanks were mobile, consisting of light frames placed over jeeps. A total of 500 dummy tanks and 150 dummy guns were constructed.

One night shortly before the battle, a powerful dust storm destroyed many of the dummy vehicles. Ayrton worked throughout that night and all the following day to restore the &quot;film set&quot; to an appearance of reality. The Axis command did not notice the breakdown of the illusion. The Royal Air Force had established air superiority by 18 October and completely excluded German reconnaissance aircraft from the Bertram area from then until battle commenced.

=== Double bluff ===

On the edge of the Munassib Depression, Bertram risked a double bluff. From 15 October 1942, a week before the attack, Camouflage constructed three and a half dummy field regiments of artillery. They were carefully made to appear seriously camouflaged, but day by day, they were maintained less and less well, to allow the enemy to decide it was facing dummy guns at Munassib. When the real battle had begun, the dummies were replaced at night with real artillery, which then kept utterly still for a day. An Axis tank attack on Munassib was shocked to find itself being fired on by the massed &quot;dummy&quot; guns.

=== Final stages ===

To achieve the deception, trucks were parked openly in the tank assembly area for some weeks. Real tanks were similarly parked openly, far behind the front. Two nights before the attack, the tanks replaced the trucks and were covered with &quot;Sunshields&quot; before dawn. The tanks were replaced that same night with dummies in their original positions so that the armour remained seemingly two or more days&#x27; journey behind the front line. To reinforce the impression that the attack was not ready, a dummy water pipeline was constructed in &quot;Operation Diamond&quot;, at an apparent rate of 5 miles per day. Two of Barkas&#x27;s camouflage officers, Phillip Cornish and Sidney Robinson, supervised the work. Some days&#x27; worth remained to be built at the time of the actual attack. The pipeline was supported by dummy pump-houses, overhead tanks and filling stations, complete with straw men. Real traffic was made to drive nearby to create tracks.

== Results ==

After the battle, the captured German &quot;panzerarmee&quot; general Wilhelm Ritter von Thoma told Montgomery that he had believed the allies had at least one more armoured division than they did, and that the attack would be in the south. Rommel&#x27;s stand-in, general Georg Stumme, thought the attack would not begin for several weeks. German documents and prisoners of war confirmed that the German commanders had believed in the existence of the decoy unit, and had not anticipated the true avenue of attack. Bertram had succeeded in all its objectives.

On 11 November 1942, Winston Churchill described the battle at El Alamein to the House of Commons, London and praised the success of Operation Bertram:

<doc id="1081482" wikidata="Q3091025" url="?curid=1081482" title="High Performance Fortran">
<text>High Performance Fortran (HPF) is an extension of Fortran 90 with constructs that support parallel computing, published by the &quot;High Performance Fortran Forum&quot; (HPFF). The HPFF was convened and chaired by Ken Kennedy of Rice University. The first version of the HPF Report was published in 1993.

Building on the array syntax introduced in Fortran 90, HPF uses a data parallel model of computation to support spreading the work of a single array computation over multiple processors. This allows efficient implementation on both SIMD and MIMD style architectures. HPF features included:

* New Fortran statements, such as codice_1, and the ability to create codice_2 (side effect free) procedures
* Compiler directives for recommended alignment and distribution of array data (influenced by the earlier Fortran D and Vienna Fortran research efforts)
* Compiler directive for specifying processor arrangements (e.g., rank, extent, etc.)
* Compiler directive for asserting loop iteration independence
* &quot;Extrinsic procedure&quot; interface for interfacing to non-HPF parallel procedures such as those using message passing
* Additional library routines - including environmental inquiry, parallel prefix/suffix (e.g., &#x27;scan&#x27;, segmented scan), data scattering, and sorting operations

Fortran 95 incorporated several HPF capabilities. In response, the HPFF again convened and published the HPF 2.0 Report. The updated report removed material which was already covered by Fortran 95. The report was also reorganized and revised based on experience with HPF 1.0.

While some vendors did incorporate HPF into their compilers in the 1990s, some aspects proved difficult to implement and of questionable use. Since then, most vendors and users have moved to OpenMP-based parallel processing. However HPF continues to have influence. For example, the codice_3 data type proposal for the Fortran-2008 standard contained a number of new intrinsic functions taken directly from HPF.

<doc id="1081487" wikidata="Q2330739" url="?curid=1081487" title="Combe Florey">
<text>Combe Florey is a village and civil parish in Somerset, England, situated northwest of Taunton, on the West Somerset Railway. The village has a population of 261. The parish includes the hamlet of Eastcombe which is a linear settlement along the A358 Taunton-Wiliton Road.

The village public house is &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Arms&quot;.

==History==

The first part of the name Combe Florey comes from &quot;cwm&quot; meaning valley, and the second part from Hugh de Fleuri who was lord of the manor around 1166.

At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 the village was part of the Bishop of Winchester&#x27;s estate of Taunton Deane.
The parish of Combe Florey was part of the Taunton Deane Hundred.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council&#x27;s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council.

For local government purposes, since 1 April 2023, the village comes under the unitary authority of Somerset Council. Prior to this, it was part of the non-metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton (formed on 1 April 2019) and, before this, the district of Taunton Deane (established under the Local Government Act 1972). From 1894-1974, for local government purposes, Combe Florey was part of Taunton Rural District. 

It is also part of the Tiverton and Minehead county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election, and was part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

==Religious sites==

The Church of St Peter and St Paul has some remains from the 13th century but is mostly from the 15th century and is designated as a Grade I listed building.

==Notable residents==
Sydney Smith was rector of the parish of Combe Florey from 1829 until his death in 1845.
Combe Florey House was the home of the novelist Evelyn Waugh, and later of his son, Auberon. Auberon Waugh is buried in St Peter and Paul&#x27;s churchyard. Evelyn Waugh is buried in a private plot of land next to the churchyard. The writers Daisy Waugh and Alexander Waugh both grew up at Combe Florey House, but their mother, Auberon Waugh&#x27;s widow, sold the house in 2008.

<text>Combe Hay is a village and civil parish in the English county of Somerset. It falls within the Cotswolds Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The parish has a population of 147.

==History==

Combe Hay was known in the Domesday Book as Cumb. The parish of Combe Hay was part of the Wellow Hundred.

The village includes a church with a 15th-century tower, the Georgian Combe Hay Manor and Georgian rectory.

Combe Hay was the site of a series of locks, dating from 1805 on the Somerset Coal Canal on which research and restoration is proposed. It is the site of one of the only caisson locks ever built which was near the current Caisson House. Many of the locks and associated workings are listed buildings. It was also served by the Camerton and Limpley Stoke Railway.

From the 1880s until 1980 mines extracting fuller&#x27;s earth were to be found in Combe Hay. During World War II production expanded to supply foundries and in paint production. Work was scheduled under the Essential Works Order 1941 and new equipment installed. The site was bombed on the night of 25–26 April 1942 during the Baedeker Blitz raids on Bath, causing damage to some of the machines. The next night local residents sheltered in the mine. By the end of the war production was up to 250 tins a week. By 1949 the site had been electrified, therefore the Garrett steam engine was sold and the chimney demolished. The Fuller&#x27;s Earth Union was taken over by Laporte plc. In 1978 a new extension was built making granules for cat litter, but in 1979 a major customer making cars in the West Midlands closed and production was wound down until closure in 1980. 

The site of the former Fuller&#x27;s earth works on the A367 was taken over by Bath Recycling Skips (see above image), in the distance is the Bath Odd Down Park &amp; Ride at the end of Combe Hay Lane. Further development is planned just below this site with up to 171 new houses being developed, although with a great deal of opposition from the inhabitants of Southstoke and Combe Hay.

The village appears in the Ealing comedy &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot;.

==Governance==

The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council&#x27;s role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, such as the village hall or community centre, playing fields and playgrounds, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also of interest to the council.

The parish falls within the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset which was created in 1996, as established by the Local Government Act 1992. It provides a single tier of local government with responsibility for almost all local government functions within their area including local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection, recycling, cemeteries, crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. They are also responsible for education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning, although fire, police and ambulance services are provided jointly with other authorities through the Avon Fire and Rescue Service, Avon and Somerset Constabulary and the Great Western Ambulance Service.

Bath and North East Somerset&#x27;s area covers part of the ceremonial county of Somerset but it is administered independently of the non-metropolitan county. Its administrative headquarters are in Bath. Between 1 April 1974 and 1 April 1996, it was the Wansdyke district and the City of Bath of the county of Avon. Before 1974 that the parish was part of the Bathavon Rural District.

The parish is represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom as part of the Frome and East Somerset constituency. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. It was also part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament prior to Britain leaving the European Union in January 2020, which elected seven MEPs using the d&#x27;Hondt method of party-list proportional representation.

==Religious sites==

The Anglican parish church has a 15th-century tower but the body of the church was altered in the late 18th century and restored with the addition of a south aisle and porch in 1874, possibly by the Lord of the manor, George Smart.

<doc id="1081494" wikidata="Q1225823" url="?curid=1081494" title="Combe Martin">
<text>Combe Martin is a village, civil parish and former manor on the North Devon coast about east of Ilfracombe. It is a small seaside resort with a sheltered cove on the northwest edge of the Exmoor National Park.

Due to the narrowness of the valley, the village consists principally of one single long street which runs between the valley head and the sea. An electoral ward with the village name exists. The ward population at the 2011 census was 3,941.

==History==
Evidence of Iron Age occupation includes the nearby Newberry Castle fort.
The toponym &quot;Combe&quot; is derived from Old English &quot;cumb&quot; meaning &quot;wooded valley&quot;. It derives ultimately from the same Brythonic source as the Welsh cwm,Cornish &quot;kom&quot; also of the same meaning. The name was recorded as &quot;Comer&quot; in 1128.

The &#x27;Martin&#x27; suffix on the place name is from the name of the FitzMartin family, feudal barons of Barnstaple, from which large barony the manor of Combe was held. The FitzMartins held the barony following the marriage of Nicholas FitzMartin (d.1260) to Maud de Tracy, heiress of the barony of Barnstaple, until the death of his grandson William II FitzMartin in 1326 who left his two sisters co-heiresses.

There are several disused silver mines on the eastern ridge and evidence of tunnels can still be seen, as well as the remains of a wheelhouse used to lift ore from the mine. There are items in the Crown Jewels made from Combe Martin silver and a large part of the war expenses of Edward III and Henry V were paid for by the sale of silver mined here.

The unusual dedication of the parish church St Peter ad Vincula to St Peter ad Vincula (&quot;St. Peter in Chains&quot;) is derived from the ancient Basilica of San Pietro in Vincoli in Rome.

One of the village&#x27;s unusual features is the Pack o&#x27; Cards public house built around 1700 by George Ley. Reputed to have been funded by his gambling successes, it originally had 52 windows, 13 rooms and four floors (matching the numbers from a pack of cards).

In the 19th century, the village name was spelt as Combmartin.

==Village street==

It is believed that the street is the longest village street in England, but this is actually a myth. It was recently measured at around a mile and a half long. The actual longest street is Stewkley, Buckinghamshire. The myth has several possible origins:
* Combe Martin has the Guinness world record for the world&#x27;s longest street party; this can easily be confused as longest village street (or, indeed, the longest high street).
* Many people measure Combe Martin from one &quot;you are entering Combe Martin&quot; sign to the other. One of the signs is placed an unusually long way from the village (approx 1 mile and one half) which can lead to confusion.
* Combe Martin has several very active pubs. There is a saying in Combe Martin that &quot;At the George and Dragon they talk about my sprained thumb, at the Dolphin they talk about my broken leg.&quot;

==Annual events==

At one time there were nine pubs: The Castle, The Dolphin, the Fo&#x27;c&#x27;stle, the George and Dragon, the Lion Inn, The London Inn, The Marine, the Pack o&#x27; Cards and the Top George. As part of the annual Carnival celebrations, there was a wheelbarrow race over the length of the village, competitors having to stop at each pub and consume a glass of beer before continuing. In 2008 the wheelbarrow race was replaced by a Fun Run and alcohol free wheelbarrow parade. The wheelbarrow race was reinstated in 2009. The carnival, run in the first week of August, also includes a popular parade where Floats travel down the long high street for many onlookers. One float named the Uncle Tom Cobley has been entered into the parade since 1911.

The annual procession &quot;The Hunting of the Earl of Rone&quot; features the rare hobby horse of England and a character called the Earl of Rone. The Hunting of the Earl of Rone takes place over a weekend, finishing with a two-mile procession along the main street, featuring, as well as the &#x27;obby &#x27;oss and Earl of Rone, a Fool, &quot;Grenadiers&quot;, drummers and music, a donkey, and hundreds of dancers in festive dress.

The custom was banned in 1837 (due to &#x27;licentiousness and drunken behaviour&#x27;) as well as the death of a drunken parishioner falling off a wall during the celebrations. The Rone custom was reconstructed in 1970. Legend has it that the Earl of Tyrone fled Ireland in 1607 and was shipwrecked at Rapparee Beach, in Ilfracombe harbour, to the west of the village. However, he actually made it to Continental Europe. It is an interesting and noisy event which takes place over the Spring Bank Holiday weekend each year.

In early June, a traditional strawberry fayre is held, where stalls are set up to sell local farm produce. Combe Martin was a big producer of strawberries in the past, being sold all over Devon and further afield. Whilst they may not produce many strawberries in the present, the tradition of holding a strawberry fayre remains to celebrate their history. However, other stalls such as charities, crafts and children&#x27;s entertainment are also usually present. A Farmers Market is also held every 3rd Saturday of the month, which only sells food and is smaller, fitting into the village hall.

==Local attractions==

Just to the east of Combe Martin Bay are the Hangman hills, the Hangman cliffs are made up of Little Hangman and the Great Hangman. The Great Hangman is a hog-backed hill of 1043 ft with a cliff-face of 820 ft, making it the highest cliff in southern Britain, and can be reached by following the South West Coast Path which runs through the village. Combe Martin lies within the North Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The Wildlife and Dinosaur Park is similar to a normal wildlife park, containing animals such as wallabies, free-roaming macaws, wolves and lions, but there are also models and animatronic dinosaurs. The models are in their own area, Domain of the Dinosaurs, whilst the animatronics (&quot;T. rex&quot;, &quot;Dilophosaurus&quot;, &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; and &quot;Velociraptor&quot;) have an enclosure in the main area of the park. There is also a Dinosaur Museum with a fossilised skeleton and egg nest of some dinosaurs. Other attractions include a train ride with a massive flood of water, shows with sealions and wolves, a light show and a mock Egyptian tomb with hieroglyphics and mummies.

== Notable residents ==
* Clara Larter (1847–1936), botanist
*Damien Hirst, English artist, entrepreneur and art collector lives in a farmhouse near the village.

<doc id="1081500" wikidata="Q7720230" url="?curid=1081500" title="The Broadways">
<text>The Broadways was a short-lived American punk band from Chicago, Illinois, United States, formed in 1996 after the dissolution of the ska-punk band Slapstick. The latter&#x27;s vocalist Brendan Kelly and trumpet player Dan Hanaway assumed the roles of bassist and guitarist, joined by Rob DePaola on drums and Chris McCaughan (formerly of Tricky Dick) on guitar. All but DePaola also assumed vocal duties.

==History==
The Broadways acknowledged musical influence from and drew comparisons to Crimpshrine, Fifteen and Jawbreaker. Their songs are typically characterised by socio-political lyrics and a lack, both lyrically and musically, of adherence to traditional verse-chorus structures.

The band released one full album, &quot;Broken Star&quot;, in 1998 on Asian Man Records. They broke up later that year, with Kelly stating a reason of “all of us growing out of where we were in our lives when we started the band”. Subsequently, Kelly and McCaughan formed The Lawrence Arms, and Hanaway and DePaola formed The Honor System.

A compilation entitled &quot;Broken Van&quot; was released in 2000, comprising 6 songs recorded after &quot;Broken Star&quot; (thought to have been planned for release on a split with Baxter) and all the songs from their pre-album EPs (except “Ben”, which had already been re-released on &quot;Broken Star&quot; as “Ben Moves to California”).

In 2007 and 2008, Asian Man Records announced plans to reissue both of the band&#x27;s albums on vinyl and CD. &quot;Broken Star&quot; had long since sold out on vinyl, whereas &quot;Broken Van&quot; had been CD-only; both had for some time been out of stock on CD. In late 2007, Mike Park posted a thread on his label’s forum stating that he could not find a copy of &quot;Broken Van&quot; and would need a fan to provide one in order for the reissue to go ahead. His request was successful. The new vinyl edition of &quot;Broken Van&quot; went on sale in July 2008, and that of &quot;Broken Star&quot; was released shortly after.

It was announced in May 2013, that the Broadways will playing a reunion show at Riot Fest 2013 in Chicago.

==Members==
* Brendan Kelly: bass, vocals
* Dan Hanaway: guitar, vocals
* Chris McCaughan: guitar, vocals
* Rob DePaola: drums

==Discography==
===Albums===
* &quot;Broken Star&quot; (Asian Man Records, 1998)
* &quot;Broken Van&quot; (Asian Man Records, 2000)

===EPs, etc.===
* &quot;We All Know That You Can Do It&quot; 7&quot; (Bicycle Records, 1997)
* &quot;Big City Life&quot; EP, CD/7&quot; (Asian Man Records, 1998)
:: The tracks from these two EPs were re-released on the post-breakup compilation &quot;Broken Van&quot;, with the exception of the former’s song &quot;Ben&quot;, which was re-recorded and re-titled as &quot;Ben Moves To California&quot; on the earlier album &quot;Broken Star&quot;.
* &quot;Where&#x27;s the Beef?&quot; (Drive Thru Records, 1997): this compilation contains the exclusive song &quot;Fuck the Church&quot;

==Legacy==
===Cover versions by The Lawrence Arms and Sundowner===
Despite having claimed that they never would, The Lawrence Arms performed songs by The Broadways, during their late 2007 tour: &quot;15 Minutes&quot; and &quot;The Kitchen Floor&quot;. Brendan sang &quot;15 Minutes&quot;, which was originally sung by Dan; its inclusion instead of one of his own songs is probably due to its relative popularity among The Broadways&#x27; catalogue, being their only track offered as a free download on the official Asian Man Records website. Chris performed his song &quot;The Kitchen Floor&quot;; he has also gone on to do so under his solo project, Sundowner. Also performed during the tour was Slapstick&#x27;s &quot;Broken Down&quot;, lending support to the theory that the likely reason for the inclusion of these songs is because the tour was something of a showcase for Brendan and Chris&#x27;s various projects, leading to some of their older songs being added for the sake of completion and to please die-hard fans. It is unclear whether any future performances by The Lawrence Arms will feature old songs.

===Reunion concert===
As part of the Asian Man Records 15th Anniversary Festival in 2011, for which founder Mike Park set himself the lofty goal of recruiting – including reuniting, if necessary – every band who had ever released on his label, all four members of The Broadways reunited to play an afternoon matinee show on the 17th of June. The festival had already seen Dan and Brendan perform in their earlier band Slapstick the day before, and would later see both participate in performances by their current bands (respectively) Ratasucia and The Lawrence Arms. The Broadways played on the third day of Riot Fest Chicago in 2013.

<doc id="1081503" wikidata="Q19491" url="?curid=1081503" title="Nha Trang">
<text>Nha Trang ( or ; ) is a coastal city and capital of Khánh Hòa Province, on the South Central Coast of Vietnam. It is bounded on the north by Ninh Hoà town, on the south by Cam Ranh city and on the west by Diên Khánh District. The city had a population of about 535,000 people in 2023. An area of of the western communes of Diên An and Diên Toàn is planned to be merged into Nha Trang which will make its new area based on the approval of the Prime Minister of Vietnam in September 2012.

Historically, the city was known as Kauthara under rule of the Kingdom of Champa. The city is still home to the famous Po Nagar Towers built by the Champa. Being a coastal city, Nha Trang is a center for marine science based at the Nha Trang Oceanography Institute. The Hon Mun marine protected area is one of four first marine protected areas in the world admitted by the IUCN.

Nha Trang is well known for its beaches and scuba diving and has developed into a popular destination for international tourists, attracting large numbers of backpackers, as well as more affluent travelers on the south-east Asia circuit; it is already very popular with Vietnamese tourists, with Nha Trang Bay widely considered as among the world&#x27;s most beautiful bays. Tourists are welcomed to participate in the Sea Festival, held biennially.

==Etymology==

According to some researchers, the name &quot;Nha Trang&quot; derives from a Vietnamese spelling of the Cham language name of the site &quot;Ea Dran&quot; (literally &quot;Reed River&quot;), the name of the Cai River as referred to by the Cham people. From the name of this river, the name was adopted to call what is now Nha Trang, which was officially made Vietnam&#x27;s territory in 1698. Ea Dran is a common Cham and Montagnard place name, same as Ia Drang Valley.

As far as the recorded naming of &quot;Nha Trang&quot; is concerned, in &quot;Toàn tập Thiên Nam Tứ Chí Lộ Đồ Thư&quot;, a geographical book written by a Vietnamese scholar with the family of Đỗ Bá in the second half of the 18th century, the name &quot;Nha Trang Môn&quot; (&quot;Nha Trang gate&quot;) was mentioned. In another map dating to the 17th century, known as &quot;Giáp Ngọ Niên Bình Nam Đồ&quot; by a noble called Đoan Quận công Bùi Thế Đạt, the name &quot;Nha Trang Hải môn&quot; (Nha Trang Sea Gate) was also cited. In Vietnamese recorded historic bibliographies, these books are perhaps the earliest ones that mentioned this place name.

In a work by Lê Quý Đôn called &quot;Phủ biên tạp lục&quot; (1776), many Nha Trang-related names were mentioned, such as &quot;đầm Nha Trang, dinh Nha Trang, nguồn Nha Trang, and đèo Nha Trang&quot;.

==History==
Kauthara, also translated as an ancient clam, is a constituent state of the empire-leading kingdom and its ruling area is located in the area from today&#x27;s Fu A province to Cam Ranh. Yanpunagara, the capital of Yangpu, occupies the faith of a man and is deeply influenced by religions such as Hinduism and Buddhism. However, in addition to that, the gods who formerly occupied ruled the indigenous faith in the motherland, such as Çri Maladakuthara (釋利摩落陀古笪羅) in the ancient Gur&#x27;an region in the south, are one of those who can preserve the old God Most of the old gods who dominated the motherland were replaced by brahmanist gods such as the goddess Yan Pu Nagara (楊浦那竭羅) and the Bhagavati (妻婆伽婆底), Replaced, located in Nha Trang near today. Bhagavati is mixed with Yan Pu Nagara, a goddess in the local faith, which is quite revered by the people and has dedicated ancestral temples to enshrine it.

From 1653 to the 19th century, Nha Trang was a deserted area rich in wildlife (animals like tigers) and was a part of Hà Bạc, Vĩnh Xương County, Diên Khánh Province. After just two decades in the early 20th century, Nha Trang underwent a rapid change. On August 30, 1924, the Governor-General of French Indochina decreed Nha Trang as a townlet (urban centre). Nha Trang Townlet was established from the ancient villages of Xương Huân, Phương Câu, Vạn Thạnh, Phương Sài, and Phước Hải.

During French Indochina, Nha Trang was seen as de facto capital of Khánh Hòa Province. The colonial administration offices (like Envoy Office, Commanding Office, Trade Office, Post Office) were situated in Nha Trang. Local royal offices like Province Chief, Provincial Judge, Military Commander are in Diên Khánh city (a walled military city 10  km south-west of Nha Trang).

On 7 May 1937, the Governor-General of French Indochina by another decree upgraded Nha Trang Townlet to town. At this time, Nha Trang Town had five wards based on the ancient villages merged to make the town: Xương Huân, Phương Câu, Vạn Thạnh, Phương Sài, and Phước Hải.

On 27 January 1958, the president of the Republic of Vietnam, Ngô Đình Diệm by Decree 18-BNV abrogated the town status of Nha Trang and divided Nha Trang into two rural communes: Nha Trang Đông (Eastern Nha Trang) and Nha Trang Tây (Western Nha Trang), under the administration of Vĩnh Xương County.

During the late 1960s, the U.S. Army&#x27;s First Field Force, Vietnam (1FFV) was headquartered in Nha Trang. 1FFV was a corps-level major subordinate command of the U.S. Army Military Assistance Command, Vietnam (MACV).

On 22 October 1970, the government of the Republic of Vietnam by Decree 132-SL/NV reestablished Nha Trang Town on the ground of Nha Trang Đông and Nha Trang Tây and other rural communes. Following that establishment, the government by Decree 357-ĐUHC/NC/NĐ dated 5 June 1971 divided Nha Trang into 11 urban zones.

On 2 April 1975, communist (Viet Cong/PRG/VPA) forces captured the city. On 4 April 1975, Khánh Hòa Military Commission (&quot;Ủy ban Quân quản Khánh Hòa&quot;) divided Nha Trang into three administrative districts: District 1, District 2 and Vĩnh Xương District. In September 1975, the districts were merged to become one entity, the town of Nha Trang.

On 30 March 1977, the Council of the Government (now the cabinet) of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam by Decision 391-CP/QĐ upgraded Nha Trang to city status, a county-level city under the administration of Phú Khánh Province (a province created by merger of now Phú Yên Province and Khánh Hòa Province). Seven communes of former Vĩnh Xương County, namely Vĩnh Thái, Vĩnh Ngọc, Vĩnh Hiệp, Vĩnh Lương, Vĩnh Trung, Vĩnh Thạnh, Vĩnh Phương was split from Khánh Xương County to become Nha Trang City territory.

On 27 March 1978, the provincial government by Decision 54-BT founded Phước Đồng Commune under Nha Trang City.

On 1 July 1989, Khanh Hoa was split from Phu Khanh Province to become Khánh Hòa Province as it was before, Nha Trang was made the capital of Khánh Hòa Province. On April 22, 1999, Phan Văn Khải by Decision 106/1999 recognized Nha Trang City as a second-class municipal city. On April 22, 2009, former Prime Minister Nguyễn Tấn Dũng recognized Nha Trang City as a first-class municipal city.

==Geography==
Nha Trang city has a metropolitan area of and population of about 500,000. It borders Ninh Hòa town in the north, Cam Ranh city in the south, Diên Khánh town in the west and the East Sea to the east. The city is on the beautiful Nha Trang Bay, which was chosen by &quot;Travel + Leisure&quot; in two succeeding years as one of 29 most beautiful bays in the world. Nha Trang is surrounded on all three sides by mountains and a large island and four smaller ones on the fourth side (in the ocean directly in front of the city&#x27;s main area), blocking major storms from potentially damaging the city.
===Climate===
Nha Trang has a tropical savanna climate (Köppen climate classification: &quot;As&quot;), with a lengthy dry season from January to August and a shorter wet season from September to December, when of the city&#x27;s total annual rainfall of about is received from the north-east monsoon. During the wet season extremely heavy rainfall from typhoons is not uncommon, though the city is shielded from the worst winds.
==Administrative divisions==

Nha Trang is subdivided into 22 wards and communes, of which 14 are urban wards: Vĩnh Hải, Vĩnh Phước, Vĩnh Thọ, Vạn Thạnh, Phương Sơn, Ngọc Hiệp, Phước Hòa, Tân Tiến (founded in November 2024), Phước Hải, Lộc Thọ, Vĩnh Nguyên, Vĩnh Trường, Phước Long, Vĩnh Hòa; and 8 suburban communes: Vĩnh Phương, Vĩnh Trung, Vĩnh Thạnh, Vĩnh Thái, Vĩnh Hiệp, Vĩnh Ngọc, Vĩnh Lương, and Phước Đồng. 

Since 1998, due to the high pace of urbanization, many urban planned zones have been built: Hòn Rớ, Bắc Việt, Thánh Gia, Đường Đệ, and Nam Hòn Khô.

==Education==
Nha Trang is home to the multidisciplinary Nha Trang University (formerly Nha Trang Fishery University); the Naval and Aviation Academy; a teachers&#x27; training college; Khanh Hoa University, as well as the Nha Trang Oceanography Institute a unique institute of oceanography in Vietnam and the Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang, one of the many famous Pasteur Institutes.

===Nha Trang Pasteur Institute===
The French-Swiss bacteriologist Alexandre Yersin, discoverer of the &quot;Yersinia pestis&quot; bacterium lived in Nha Trang for 50 years and was affectionately known as &quot;Ông Năm&quot;. He established the Indochinese Pasteur Institute (now known as the Pasteur Institute of Nha Trang), devoted to researching the bubonic plague. Yersin died in Nha Trang on 1 March 1943. A street in the city is named after him, and a shrine has been built over his tomb. There is a Yersin Museum dedicated to his achievements.

==Economy==
Nha Trang&#x27;s economy relies largely on tourism. In the suburban areas around the city, the shipbuilding industry has developed and contributed significantly to the local economy. Fishery and services are also important to the city. Khanh Hoa Province in general and Nha Trang is particular are among the largest contributors to Vietnam&#x27;s annual budget revenues. Lobster farming on the sea is an important industry for the people living in suburban areas.

To the south of the city, by Cam Ranh Bay, several industrial parks are under construction and have been partly available for investors. Once the construction of the deep-water port on Vân Phong Bay has been completed, this area will become the third important economic zone in the province (besides Nha Trang and Cam Ranh).
===Tourism===


Nha Trang is one of the most important tourist hubs of Vietnam, thanks to its beaches with fine and clean sand and the clear ocean water with mild temperatures all year round. There are several resorts — such as Vinpearl, Diamond Bay and Ana Mandara — and amusement and water parks, in the city and on islands off the coast. The possibly most beautiful street of Nha Trang is Tran Phu Street along the seaside, sometimes referred to as the North-South Expressway East of Vietnam.

Lying off Nha Trang is the Hon Tre Island (Bamboo Island), with a major resort operated by the Vinpearl Group. The Vinpearl Cable Car, a gondola lift system, links the mainland to the five-star resort and theme park on Hon Tre Island.

Nha Trang is a stopover for annual yacht races starting in Hong Kong. In recent years, the city has welcomed many five-star sea cruises. In addition to sailboat racing, Nha Trang provides a rich variety of tourist activities for visitors. Island hopping, scuba diving, water sports and other sporting activities can be enjoyed. The Nha Trang Tourist Information Center (a non-governmental organisation), located near the Cho Dam Market has been set up to provide information for visitors.

The local cuisine is most famous for fresh seafood and barbecued pork rolled in rice paper. The area&#x27;s bird&#x27;s nest soup is deemed one of the best in Vietnam. Bird&#x27;s nests are collected in the wild, on bird farms on the islands off the coast and even in some houses in the inner city.

==Transportation==

When Cam Ranh Bay used to be an important naval base, Nha Trang Airport was the main airport of the city. This airport was used by the United States Air Force and Republic of Vietnam Air Force during the Vietnam War. When part of Cam Ranh Bay was made an economic development zone by the Vietnamese government, Cam Ranh International Airport (also a military airport built by the United States during Vietnam War) was made the new civilian airport of the city. This airport is located by Cam Ranh Bay, south of the city and was (as of 2007) the fourth busiest airport in passenger traffic in Vietnam serving more than 683,000 passengers in 2008. As of 2016, the airport has domestic connections to Hanoi, Hồ Chí Minh City, Hải Phòng, Đà Nẵng, Vinh.

The city is next to the National Route 1, the backbone north–south road of the country. The Reunification Railway crosses the city and stops at Nha Trang Railway Station. The construction work of Vân Phong Port, north of the city, a deep-water project capable of handling ships up to 100,000 tonnes, and with a capacity of 100 million tonnes of cargo per annum, is under progress by a consortium of Japanese corporations. The estimated investment capital for this port-city complex project is expected to reach US$15 billion.

<doc id="1081515" wikidata="Q814482" url="?curid=1081515" title="Beherit">
<text>Beherit is a Finnish black metal band from Rovaniemi. The band was formed in 1989 by Nuclear Holocausto Vengeance (Marko Laiho), Demonic Fornication (Jari Vaarala) and Sodomatic Slaughter (Jari Pirinen), with the purpose of performing &quot;the most primitive, savage, hell-obsessed black metal imaginable&quot;. &quot;Beherit&quot; is claimed to be the Syriac word for Satan, but this word does not exist in the language and the claim is falsehood. Through the uncommercial nature of their music, visuals, and live performances, the band quickly attracted a cult following. Besides the &quot;raw&quot; sound, the band&#x27;s music is noted for its avant-garde side and emphasis on atmosphere. Beherit are now regarded as a pioneer in their genre.

As a full band, Beherit released one full-length album and many demos and compilations of raw and minimalistic black metal. They disbanded soon after the release of the experimental 1993 album &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot;, which is now considered a classic of the genre. Laiho, the group&#x27;s frontman, continued as a solo project and released two more albums under the band&#x27;s name, &quot;H418ov21.C&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Electric Doom Synthesis&quot; in 1995. These albums are usually categorized as dark ambient. Although they were completely electronic, the albums carried the atmosphere of the band&#x27;s black metal recordings. Original members Nuclear Holocausto and Sodomatic Slaughter reformed the band in 2008, now a four-piece featuring new members Ancient Corpse Desekrator and Abyss.

==History==

===Early days (1989–1990)===
Beherit was formed in 1989 by three young musicians from Rovaniemi, Lapland; vocalist and guitarist Nuclear Holocausto Vengeance (Marko Laiho), bassist Daemon Fornication and drummer Sodomatic Slaughter (Jari Pirinen). The band released three demos the following year—&quot;Seventh Blasphemy&quot;, &quot;Morbid Rehearsals&quot;, and &quot;Demonomancy&quot;—and also gathered reputation for their live shows, which included pig heads and goats on stage.

===&quot;The Oath of Black Blood&quot; (1991–1992)===
Beherit&#x27;s compilation album, &quot;The Oath of Black Blood&quot;, includes material recorded from June to September 1990. The album was released in 1991. The album is traditional, fast, and brutal old school black metal, heavily influenced by death metal, thrash metal, and grindcore. However, it is not a separately recorded studio album. The band got some funding for recording an album from their record label at the time, Turbo Music, but supposedly spent the money on alcohol. The label then released their demo &quot;Demonomancy&quot; and 7-inch EP &quot;Dawn of Satan&#x27;s Millennium&quot; as a compilation, without the band&#x27;s permission, and named it &quot;The Oath of Black Blood&quot;, which was originally supposed to be the name of the new album. Laiho commented on the album in an early 1992 interview for &quot;Metal Hammer&quot; magazine:
&quot;I hate the album! It&#x27;s so bad, we never wanted to release it. The songs are from our &#x27;Demonomancy&#x27; demo and our label Turbo Music just used a regular cassette for the album pressing. Honestly, I never sent them the master tape... We&#x27;re planning to release a proper LP soon, this time on my own label. The result should be much better.&quot;
The album is now generally regarded as a full-length release. Spinefarm Records re-issued it in 2005, and Season of Mist in 2006. In 1991, the band members briefly performed under the name, The Lord Diabolus, from which a single demo tape was made and released independently before the band returned to working under the name Beherit. The songs &quot;Intro (Tireheb)&quot; and &quot;Nocturnal Evil&quot; were later re-released as Beherit songs.

===&quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; (1993)===
Beherit&#x27;s best-known and most influential album, &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot;, was recorded between April and August in 1992. It was released in 1993 as the band&#x27;s first official LP. The album was named after a Wiccan ritual, &quot;drawing down the Moon&quot;. The album was highly experimental within the black metal scene, as the band used whispers and space-like electronic and synth sounds to strengthen its hypnotic atmosphere. &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; was reissued by Candlelight Records in 2006.

===Ambient era (1994–1996)===
Despite the album&#x27;s success, &quot;Drawing Down the Moon&quot; was to remain the band&#x27;s last black metal release, as they split up the next year. Laiho still recorded two albums of dark ambient music, &quot;H418ov21.C&quot; and &quot;Electric Doom Synthesis&quot;, and released them under the band&#x27;s name. As the band did not reform and Laiho had eventually lost interest in black metal, he went on to continue his musical career in dark ambient as Suuri Shamaani and in hardcore techno as DJ Gamma-G.

===Return to black metal, &quot;Engram&quot; (2009)===

Beherit was reformed in 2008, with original members Nuclear Holocausto (having returned to Finland from Thailand) and Sodomatic Slaughter, and newcomers Ancient Corpse Desekrator and Abyss. The new album is a return to the black metal genre, and also marks Beherit&#x27;s return to a full band configuration after existing as a solo project from 1994 until its disbandment in 1996. The album, entitled &quot;Engram&quot;, is the band&#x27;s third black metal album (fifth overall) and first in 14 years.

A sixth album, &quot;Bardo Exist&quot;, was released in 2020. This album marked a return to the black ambient style.

==Conflicts==
Beherit were one of the first second-wave black metal bands. In the early 1990s, due to Beherit and groups such as Impaled Nazarene and Barathrum, the Finnish scene was becoming more and more recognized. This eventually resulted in a Norwegian-Finnish conflict often named the &quot;Dark War&quot;. According to &quot;Isten&quot; fanzine&#x27;s obviously satirical article, the conflict originated from several misunderstandings and practical jokes, involving Laiho, but Mika Luttinen of Impaled Nazarene believed he received death threats in Norwegian. His band&#x27;s first album had a statement saying &quot;no orders from Norway accepted&quot;, which Luttinen later admitted being stupid and childish. Laiho commented on the conflict in an interview for January 1994 issue of &quot;Masters of Brutality&quot; magazine:

&quot;When we started the band about 4 years ago we knew this and so that&#x27;s okay. Now there are more people against us ‘cause of these new rules and all these stupid rumours spread by our Norwegian enemies... but I don’t care so much. But that’s a bit sad that the black metal underground scene is totally split.&quot;

<text>Elizabeth Jane Weir (born February 20, 1948) is a Canadian lawyer and politician in New Brunswick. She was elected leader of the New Democratic Party of New Brunswick in June 1988 and became an opposition voice to the Liberal government, which held all 58 seats in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick.

Born in Belfast, Northern Ireland, Weir was educated at the University of Waterloo and the University of Western Ontario. She has taught at York University and the University of New Brunswick. Weir was first elected to the legislature in 1991 in the riding of Saint John South where she defeated Liberal John Mooney by only 78 votes. In 1995, the riding became Saint John Harbour and she was re-elected in 1995, 1999 and 2003. During that time, she was the sole New Democrat in the legislature.

In 2000, Weir released documents accessed under the &quot;Right to Information Act&quot; surrounding a $1 billion upgrade project for the Irving Oil Refinery being put in motion without being completely assessed for its environmental impact, suggesting that the government &quot;ignored the public interest and pandered to big business.&quot;

At the 2003 federal NDP convention at which Jack Layton would be elected party leader, Weir sought the presidency of the federal party against re-offering incumbent Adam Giambrone. Midway through the convention, Giambrone and Weir decided to seek a co-presidency. Many delegates balked, especially at the assumption that they could push through a sudden constitutional change in a party often dearly concerned with internal process. The joint ticket was withdrawn, and Weir placed second after Giambrone and ahead of a candidate from the NDP Socialist Caucus.

On October 8, 2004, Weir announced that she would be stepping down from the leadership of the New Brunswick NDP but would stay on until a successor was chosen. She also pledged to run for re-election to the legislature in the next general election; however, she eventually reversed this pledge. Allison Brewer was chosen as her successor at a September 2005 leadership convention and Weir resigned her seat from the legislature on October 13, 2005 to accept the appointment to be the first president and CEO of the new New Brunswick crown corporation the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Agency.

Weir was made a Member of the Order of New Brunswick in 2021.

<doc id="1081521" wikidata="Q5574853" url="?curid=1081521" title="Go Jimmy Go">
<text>Go Jimmy Go was an American ska, rocksteady, reggae and soul influenced band from Honolulu, Hawaii. Although chronologically, the band belongs to the third-wave, their mellow, slower tempo sound is reminiscent of the classic style of the original 1960s Jamaican first wave of ska.

==History==
Go Jimmy Go was formed in 1996 during the height of the third-wave ska craze by Larry Gordon and Cameron Wright during the weekly Ska Night at a club then known as The Vibe at the renowned Puck&#x27;s Alley near the University of Hawaii. Several of the regulars of Ska Night had discussed forming a band which would be Hawaii&#x27;s answer to the thriving &quot;traditional ska&quot; scene. After several false starts and frequent jam sessions featuring a rotating cast of trial members, a small core emerged consisting of Wright on bass guitar, Gordon on alto saxophone and vocals, Eric White on tenor saxophone, Ian Ashley on guitar and Tyson Balmores on drums, with several musicians rotating in and out of the lineup to fill in at various positions. &quot;We had so many members come and go that first year. We were picky from the start,&quot; remembered White. &quot;By the second year, we must have had about 20 total members pass through.&quot; These included a trio of female back-up singers, an organist and a trumpeter.

From the beginning it was decided by the band that Go Jimmy Go&#x27;s sound would be more influenced by early ska and rocksteady pioneers such as The Maytals, The Wailers, The Skatalites, Alton Ellis, Ken Boothe and more recently L.A.&#x27;s Hepcat. Eventually soul music, rocksteady, reggae, funk and even Hawaiian began to blend seamlessly with the band&#x27;s sound, reflecting the many musical influences of the core members. The band decided that a focus on original music as opposed to covers would set them apart from many of the traditional ska groups currently performing on the scene. &quot;Egyptian Ska&quot;, &quot;Mafioso&quot;, and &quot;Jericho&quot; were early favorites that were staple tunes in GJG&#x27;s early set.

In 1997, a turning point came when Go Jimmy Go was introduced to Santa Barbara roots reggae favorites Dynamic Pressure, who had recently relocated to the islands. However, the stress of maintaining the band, playing shows and living in a new state were too much and Dynamic Pressure unfortunately disbanded. The premature demise of the group led to former lead singer Jason &quot;Bison&quot; Friedmann being offered a spot in Go Jimmy Go.

During a show at the Karaoke Ninja House in Honolulu, guitarist Tino Olsen was invited to join the Go Jimmy Go. Olsen&#x27;s strong song writing and vocal skills were a valuable asset to the group and led to many great GJG songs featuring a solid three part harmony that further strengthened the band&#x27;s sound.

1998 was an important year for Go Jimmy Go as several high-profile gigs, including the Spring Skalabration, which featured Go Jimmy Go along with ska superstars Hepcat, Save Ferris, and Dance Hall Crashers helped cement the band as Hawaii&#x27;s premier ska act. Several compilation CDs were released nationally on Stubborn Records and Steadybeat featuring Go Jimmy Go, which helped expose the band to a much wider audience. 1998 also saw the departure of Gordon from the group, as well early studio sessions which helped expose the band to a studio setting, helping pave the way for the group&#x27;s debut CD &quot;Slow Time&quot;.

Much of 1999 was spent in studio working on &quot;Slow Time&quot; as trombonist Fernando Pacheco joined the group.

<text>In computing, single program, multiple data (SPMD) is a term that has been used to refer to computational models for exploiting parallelism whereby multiple processors cooperate in the execution of a program in order to obtain results faster.

The term SPMD was introduced in 1983 and was used to denote two different computational models:

# by Michel Auguin (University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis) and François Larbey (Thomson/Sintra), as a “&quot;fork-and-join&quot;” and data-parallel approach where the &quot;parallel tasks (“single program”)&quot; are split-up and run simultaneously &quot;in lockstep&quot; on multiple &quot;SIMD processors&quot; with different inputs, and
# by Frederica Darema (IBM), where “&quot;all (processors) processes  begin executing the same program... but through synchronization directives ... self-schedule themselves  to execute different instructions and act on different data&quot;” and enabling MIMD parallelization of a given program, and is a more general approach than data-parallel and more efficient than the fork-and-join for parallel execution on general purpose multiprocessors.

The (IBM) SPMD is the most common style of parallel programming and can be considered a subcategory of MIMD in that it refers to MIMD execution of a given (“single”) program. It is also a prerequisite for research concepts such as active messages and distributed shared memory.

==SPMD vs SIMD==

In SPMD parallel execution, multiple autonomous processors simultaneously execute the same program at independent points, rather than in the lockstep that SIMD or SIMT imposes on different data. With SPMD, tasks can be executed on general purpose CPUs. In SIMD the same operation (instruction) is applied on multiple data to manipulate data streams (a version of SIMD is vector processing where the data are organized as vectors). Another class of processors, GPUs encompass multiple SIMD streams processing.  Note that SPMD and SIMD are not mutually exclusive; SPMD parallel execution can include SIMD, or vector, or GPU sub-processing. SPMD has been used for parallel programming of both message passing and shared-memory machine architectures.

==Distributed memory==
On distributed memory computer architectures, SPMD implementations usually employ message passing programming. A distributed memory computer consists of a collection of interconnected, independent computers, called nodes. For parallel execution, each node starts its own program and communicates with other nodes by sending and receiving messages, calling send/receive routines for that purpose. Other &quot;parallelization directives&quot; such as Barrier synchronization may also be implemented by messages. The messages can be sent by a number of communication mechanisms, such as TCP/IP over Ethernet, or specialized high-speed interconnects such as Myrinet and Supercomputer Interconnect. For distributed memory environments, serial sections of the program can be implemented by identical computation of the serial section on all nodes rather than computing the result on one node and sending it to the others, if that improves performance by reducing communication overhead.

Nowadays, the programmer is isolated from the details of the message passing by standard interfaces, such as PVM and MPI.

Distributed memory is the programming style used on parallel supercomputers from homegrown Beowulf clusters to the largest clusters on the Teragrid, as well as present GPU-based supercomputers.

==Shared memory==
On a shared memory machine (a computer with several interconnected CPUs that access the same memory space), the sharing can be implemented in the context of either physically shared memory or logically shared (but physically distributed) memory; in addition to the shared memory, the CPUs in the computer system can also include local (or private) memory. For either of these contexts, synchronization can be enabled with hardware enabled primitives (such as compare-and-swap, or fetch-and-add. For machines that do not have such hardware support, locks can be used and data can be “exchanged” across processors (or, more generally, &quot;processes&quot; or threads) by depositing the sharable data in a shared memory area. When the hardware does not support shared memory, packing the data as a “message” is often the most efficient way to program (logically) shared memory computers with large number of processors, where the physical memory is local to processors and accessing memory of another processor takes longer. SPMD on a shared memory machine can be implemented by standard processes (heavyweight) or threads (lightweight).

Shared memory multiprocessing (both symmetric multiprocessing, SMP, and non-uniform memory access, NUMA) presents the programmer with a common memory space and the possibility to parallelize execution. With the (IBM) SPMD model the cooperating processors (or processes) take different paths through the program, using parallel directives (&quot;parallelization and synchronization directives&quot;, which can utilize compare-and-swap and fetch-and-add operations on shared memory synchronization variables), and perform operations on data in the shared memory (“shared data”); the processors (or processes) can also have access and perform operations on data in their local memory (“private data”). In distinction, with fork-and-join approaches, the program starts executing on one processor and the execution splits in a parallel region, which is started when parallel directives are encountered; in a parallel region, the processors execute a parallel task on different data. A typical example is the parallel DO loop, where different processors work on separate parts of the arrays involved in the loop. At the end of the loop, execution is synchronized (with soft- or hard-barriers), and processors (processes) continue to the next available section of the program to execute. The (IBM) SPMD has been implemented in the current standard interface for shared memory multiprocessing, OpenMP, which uses multithreading , usually implemented by lightweight processes, called threads.

==Combination of levels of parallelism==
Current computers allow exploiting many parallel modes at the same time for maximum combined effect. A distributed memory program using MPI may run on a collection of nodes. Each node may be a shared memory computer and execute in parallel on multiple CPUs using OpenMP. Within each CPU, SIMD vector instructions (usually generated automatically by the compiler) and superscalar instruction execution (usually handled transparently by the CPU itself), such as pipelining and the use of multiple parallel functional units, are used for maximum single CPU speed.

==History==
The acronym SPMD for “Single-Program Multiple-Data” has been used to describe two different computational models for exploiting parallel computing, and this is due to both terms being natural extensions of Flynn’s taxonomy. The two respective groups of researchers were unaware of each other’s use of the term SPMD to independently describe different models of parallel programming.

The term SPMD was proposed first in 1983 by Michel Auguin (University of Nice Sophia-Antipolis) and François Larbey (Thomson/Sintra) in the context of the OPSILA parallel computer and in the context of a fork-and-join and data parallel computational model approach. This computer consisted of a master (controller processor) and SIMD processors (or vector processor mode as proposed by Flynn). In Auguin’s SPMD model, the same (parallel) task (“&quot;same program&quot;”) is executed on different (SIMD) processors (“&quot;operating in lock-step mode&quot;” acting on a part (“slice”) of the data-vector. Specifically, in their 1985 paper (and similarly in) is stated: “&quot;we consider the SPMD (Single Program, Multiple Data) operating mode. This mode allows simultaneous execution of the same task (one per processor) but prevents data exchange between processors.  Data exchanges are only performed under SIMD mode by means of vector assignments.  We assume synchronizations are summed-up to switchings&quot; (sic) &quot;between SIMD and SPMD operatings&quot; (sic) &quot;modes using global fork-join primitives&quot;”).

Starting around the same timeframe (in late 1983 – early 1984), the SPMD term was proposed by Frederica Darema (at IBM at that time, and part of the RP3 group) to define a different SPMD computational model that she proposed, as a programming model which in the intervening years has been applied to a wide range of general-purpose high-performance computers (including RP3 - the 512-processor IBM Research Parallel Processor Prototype) and has led to the current parallel computing standards. The (IBM) SPMD programming model assumes a multiplicity of processors which operate cooperatively, all executing the same program but can take different paths through the program based on parallelization directives embedded in the program; and specifically as stated in “&quot;all processes&quot; &quot;participating in the parallel computation are created at the beginning of the execution and remain in existence until the end&quot;”, &quot;(the processors/processes)&quot; “&quot;execute different instructions and act on different data&quot;”, “&quot;the job&quot;(work) &quot;to be done by each process is allocated dynamically&quot;”, that is the processes “&quot;self-schedule themselves to execute different instructions and act on different data&quot;”, thus self-assign themselves to cooperate in execution of serial and parallel tasks (as well as replicate tasks) in the program.  The notion &quot;process&quot; was used as a generalization of the term &quot;processor&quot; in the sense that multiple processes can execute on a processor (to for example exploit larger degrees of parallelism for more efficiency and load-balancing). The (IBM) SPMD model was proposed by Darema as an approach different and more efficient than the fork-and-join that was pursued by all others in the community at that time; it is also more general than just “data-parallel” computational model and can encompass fork&amp;join (as a subcategory implementation). The original context of the (IBM) SPMD was the RP3 computer (the 512-prosessor IBM Research Parallel Processor Prototype), which supported general purpose computing, with both distributed and (logically) shared memory. The (IBM) SPMD model was implemented by Darema and IBM colleagues into the EPEX (Environment for Parallel Execution), one of the first prototype programming environments. The effectiveness of the (IBM) SPMD was demonstrated for a wide class of applications, and in 1988 was implemented in the IBM FORTRAN, the first vendor-product in parallel programming; and in MPI (1991 and on),  OpenMP (1997 and on), and other environments which have adopted and cite the (IBM) SPMD Computational Model.

By the late 1980s, there were many distributed computers with proprietary message passing libraries. The first SPMD standard was PVM. The current de facto standard is MPI.

The Cray parallel directives were a direct predecessor of OpenMP.

<text>Peter Cowie (born 24 December 1939) is a British film historian and author of more than thirty books on film. In 1963 he was the founder/publisher and general editor of the annual &quot;International Film Guide&quot;, a survey of worldwide film production, which he continued to edit for forty years.

==Life and career==

Educated at Charterhouse School, and an exhibitioner in history at Magdalene College, Cambridge, he began writing about film in 1960. He has contributed to many of the world&#x27;s leading newspapers and periodicals, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; (London), the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Le Monde&quot;, &quot;Expressen&quot;, &quot;Neue Zürcher Zeitung&quot;, &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot; and &quot;Film Comment&quot;.

His books include definitive surveys of the Scandinavian cinema, in particular the work of Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman. In fact, Cowie himself has said that he belongs to a generation whose life was changed by seeing &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot;.

In 1963 he published the first edition of &quot;International Film Guide&quot; which he continued to publish annually for 40 years. During the period 1963–1988, he published almost 100 books on film by various authors at The Tantivy Press in London, including classics like Robin Wood&#x27;s &quot;Hitchcock&#x27;s Films&quot;. He also launched annual publications on sport (&quot;International Cycling Guide&quot;, &quot;International Running Guide&quot;), classical music (&quot;International Music Guide&quot;), television (&quot;International TV and Video Guide&quot;) and the Nordic area (&quot;The Scandinavian Guide&quot;).

Other aspects of his work in the area of Scandinavian cinema include his service on the &quot;Quality Awards&quot; Jury of the Swedish Film Institute for 11 years from the 1970s where he was its only non-Nordic member. In 1989 he was decorated by King Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden with the Royal Order of the Polar Star for his services to Swedish culture. During the 1980s he spent several years in Finland, and since 1983 was the director of the Nordic Film Festival in Hanasaari, Helsinki. Cowie has been on various juries, at the Cannes, Venice, Berlin, and Tampere festivals.

In 1989 he joined &quot;Variety&quot; and served as the international publishing director until 2000. After he joined, &quot;International Film Guide&quot; was published as &quot;Variety International Film Guide&quot; until 2006. In 1999, he edited &quot;The Variety Insider&quot; with detailed information on the year in entertainment as well as historical information.

He is also interested in the work of American film directors as different as Francis Ford Coppola, Orson Welles, and John Ford. &quot;The Godfather Book&quot; (Faber, London, 1997) examined Coppola&#x27;s trilogy of films, and after a visit to Monument Valley in Utah, he wrote an analysis of Ford&#x27;s films which were shot there, &quot;John Ford and the American West&quot; (Abrams, New York, 2004), examining the importance of the location and the influences of 19th Century American painting.

He has provided more than a dozen voice-over audio commentaries for DVD versions of classic films which form part of The Criterion Collection. Many of these commentaries are for the films of Bergman. In 2018 he served as Consultant on Criterion&#x27;s 39-film box-set entitled Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s Cinema.

He is a sometime visiting professor in film studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara. Between 2003 and 2020 he was a special consultant to the Berlin International Film Festival, working with Berlinale Talents. He has moderated panels and symposia at the Venice International Film Festival, and also on behalf of the European Film Academy. In 2016, he moderated on-stage conversations with Sir Alan Parker, Jaco van Dermal, and Michael Roskam for the MEDIA Program&#x27;s 25th anniversary celebrations in Brussels.

From 2004 to 2006, he was a member of the executive board at The European Film College in Ebeltoft, Denmark. In November 2006, to coincide with the centenary of the actress Louise Brooks, Cowie&#x27;s &quot;Louise Brooks: Lulu Forever&quot; was published in Germany and the United States. In 2008, Cowie co-edited &quot;Projections: The European Film Academy&quot; (Faber, London), and was a contributing editor to the Taschen volume, &quot;The Ingmar Bergman Archives&quot;. His most recent work includes &quot;Joan Crawford, the Enduring Star&quot; (Rizzoli, New York 2009), and &quot;Akira Kurosawa, Master of Cinema&quot; (Rizzoli, New York, 2010). Also in 2010, he wrote a concise history of the Berlin International Film Festival (published by Bertz und Fischer, Berlin).

In 2017, Cowie was a producer of the Criterion Collection&#x27;s largest-ever boxed set of DVDs/Blu-rays -- &quot;100 Years of Olympic Films 1912-2012&quot;, and contributed a book-length study of the more than fifty documentaries on the Olympics.

<text>Natalie MacMaster (born June 13, 1972) is a Canadian fiddler from Troy, Inverness County, Nova Scotia, who plays Cape Breton fiddle music. She has toured with the Chieftains, Faith Hill, Carlos Santana and Alison Krauss, and has recorded with Yo-Yo Ma. She has appeared at the Celtic Colours festival in Cape Breton, Celtic Connections in Scotland and MerleFest in the United States.

==Background==

MacMaster is the daughter of Alex and Minnie (&quot;née&quot; Beaton) MacMaster and the sister of Kevin and David MacMaster. She is the niece of the late renowned Cape Breton fiddler Buddy MacMaster and the cousin of two other fiddlers, Ashley MacIsaac and Andrea Beaton. She is also distantly related to Jack White.

In 2002, she married the fiddler Donnell Leahy of the Leahy family band, and moved to Lakefield, Ontario. They have seven children, and have performed and recorded together as a duo, and occasionally include their children, who also play fiddle, in their performances.

==Musical career==
MacMaster began playing the fiddle at the age of nine, and made her performing debut the same year at a square dance in Glencoe Mills, Nova Scotia. When she was 16, she released her first album, &quot;Four on the Floor&quot;, and a second album, &quot;Road to the Isle&quot;, followed in 1991. Her first album was self-produced, while her second was co-produced by John Morris Rankin (The Rankin Family) and Tom O&#x27;Keefe. Both albums were initially released only on cassette, but Rounder Records omitted a few tracks and re-released them as &quot;A Compilation&quot; in 1998. In 1999, she performed at the Juno Awards show in Hamilton.

In recent years she has expanded her musical repertoire, mixing her Cape Breton roots with music from Scotland and Ireland, as well as American bluegrass.

In 2004, MacMaster appeared on Sharon, Lois &amp; Bram&#x27;s 25th Anniversary Concert special titled &quot;25 Years of Skinnamarink&quot; that was broadcast on CBC on January 1, 2004, at 7:00pm. She performed two songs with the trio, &quot;C-H-I-C-K-E-N&quot; and &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s Farm&quot;.

==Awards==
MacMaster has received a number of Canadian music awards, including several &quot;Artist of the Year&quot; awards from the East Coast Music Association, two Juno Awards for best instrumental album, and &quot;Fiddler of the Year&quot; from the Canadian Country Music Association. She was also awarded an honorary doctorate from Niagara University in New York in 2006. In 2006, she was made a member of the Order of Canada and, in 2020, she was made a member of the Order of Nova Scotia. In 2023, she was inducted into the Canadian Fiddle Hall of Honour at the 2023 Canadian Grand Masters event in Truro, Nova Scotia.

<doc id="1081536" wikidata="Q219574" url="?curid=1081536" title="Naucalpan">
<text>Naucalpan, officially Naucalpan de Juárez, is one of 125 municipalities located just northwest of Mexico City in the adjoining State of Mexico. The municipal seat is the city of Naucalpan de Juárez, which extends into the neighboring municipality of Huixquilucan.

The name Naucalpan comes from Nahuatl and means &quot;place of the four neighborhoods&quot; or &quot;four houses.&quot; Juárez was added to the official name in 1874 in honor of Benito Juárez. The history of the area begins with the Tlatilica who settled on the edges of the Hondo River between 1700 and 600 B.C.E., but it was the Mexica who gave it its current name when they dominated it from the 15th century until the Spanish conquest of the Mexica Empire. Naucalpan claims to be the area where Hernán Cortés rested on the &quot;Noche Triste&quot; as they fled Tenochtitlan in 1520, but this is disputed. It is the home of the Virgin of Los Remedios, a small image of the Virgin Mary which is strongly associated with the Conquest and is said to have been left here.

Today, the city of Naucalpan is actually larger than the municipality itself, with part of it extending into neighboring Huixquilucan Municipality, although there are other towns in within the municipality of Naucalpan which are outside the city of Naucalpan. It is a major center of industry in Mexico. It is, however, best known as the location of Ciudad Satélite, a development from the 1960s and the site of the Toreo de Cuatro Caminos bullring, which was demolished in the 2010s to build the Toreo Parque Central mixed-use development. The only unurbanized areas of the municipality are the Los Remedios National Park and a number of &quot;ejidos&quot;, but the lack of housing has put serious pressure on these areas.

==History==
The Valley of Mexico, of which Naucalpan is a part, has been inhabited by humans for over 20,000 years. The history of Naucalpan begins with a group called the Tlatilca who settled on the edges of the Hondo River between 1700 and 600 BCE, in what is now modern Nacaulpan, Totolinga and Los Cuartos. During the Preclassic period (1400 to 1300 BCE) a group of Olmecs arrived and had significant influence on the dominion of Tlatilca. Later, Tlatilca was also heavily influenced by the Teotihuacan civilization. Between 1000 and 1200 CE the Chichimecas conquered the Tlatlica and deposed their monarchy. The Pyramid del Conde was built during this time, located in what is now the El Conde neighborhood. Later in the pre-Hispanic period, the area was governed by Tlacopan (Tacuba) and became ethnically dominated by the Otomi. Starting from 1428, the area was under the dominion of Tepanece de Atzcapotzalco, which was later conquered by the Aztec Triple Alliance, who gave it the name of Naucalpan.
On 30 June 1520, Hernán Cortés fled Tenochtitlan toward what is now Naucalpan. According to legend, he wept under a Montezuma Cypress tree, which is believed by some to be located at the foot of the Otocampulco Mountain here. This is called the &quot;Noche Triste&quot; or &quot;Night of Sorrows&quot;. There is dispute as to whether this tree is located here or in Popotla. Another legend states that during the flight of the Spanish, an image of the Virgin Mary was left under a maguey plant, where the Sanctuary of Los Remedios is today.

In 1521, the fall of Tenochtitlan brought the area under Spanish control. Hernán Cortés conceded governorship of this area to Isabel Moctezuma and Alonso de Grado, naming it San Bartholome Naucalpan. Evangelization of the native peoples was carried out by the Franciscans who built the monastery of San Gabriel de Tacuba and a number of historic churches such as the Church of San Francisco de Assisi, Church of the Inmaculada Concepcion and the Church of Los Remedios. In 1574, the Temple of San Bartolome Naucalpan was built, with the towers constructed later in 1629. The area was important in colonial times for the mining of building stone, sand and gravel which was used for many constructions in Mexico City including the Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral and the National Palace.

In 1810, the Virgin of the Remedios was brought here from the Mexico City Cathedral, dressed as a general. She was proclaimed as a patroness of Spain and the &quot;guardian of the Spanish Army.&quot; Locally, she was called a &quot;gachupina&quot; (slang word for Spaniard). She eventually became the patroness of Naucalpan, with 450th anniversary of her finding celebrated in 1990. Her sanctuary was built in 1875.

In 1821, brothers Joaquin and Bernardo Miramín founded the newspaper &quot;Diario Militar.&quot; One of the writers for this paper was José Joaquín Fernández de Lizardi, popularly known as &quot;El Pensador Mexicano&quot; (The Mexican Thinker) .
The town remained a dependency of Tlalnepantla for much of the 19th century even though it had become an independent municipality in 1826. Industrialization began here with the founding of the Hilados and Tejidos de Rio Hondo factory, inaugurated by Benito Juarez in 1869. In 1899, the territory of Santa Cruz del Monte was added to the municipality. During the Mexican Revolution, Zapatista leaders Rafael Carrillo and Roman Diaz operated in the nearby Chimalpa mountains against federal forces.

The Toreo de Cuatro Caminos was inaugurated in 1947. It was the icon of the city for many years, as well as the symbol of Naucalpan&#x27;s Metro station, Cuatro Caminos. The building was torn down in 2009 to make way for a commercial complex.

Naucalpan was officially declared a city in 1957, and the founding of Ciudad Satélite occurred in the same year. The project was completed in 1963. Its five signature towers were designed by Luis Barragán and Matias Goeritz. By 1975, Naucalpan had become one of the most industrialized cities in Mexico.

==The city==

The city of Naucalpan extends into neighboring Huixquilucan Municipality. At the 2010 census its total population was 913,681 inhabitants, with 792,211 of these in Naucalpan Municipality and 121,470 in Huixquilucan Municipality. Since cities, or localities, have no separate government, the two parts are governed from their respective municipalities. Within Naucalpan Municipality only the Los Remedios National Park and several ejidos remaining mostly unurbanized. Over 95% of the municipality&#x27;s population lives in the city proper. The municipality consists of 119 neighborhoods in the city proper, 18 small villages, 71 residential developments and two rural housing developments. Because of the growth of its industry, Naucalpan is one of the most important municipalities in the country. Products manufactured here include foodstuffs, drinks, tobacco, clothing and textiles, wood products and paper, metals and chemicals. Industrial parks include Alce Blanco, Atoto, Industrial Naucalpan, La Perla and Tlatilco.

The municipality is part of Greater Mexico City and in the Valley of Mexico, sharing the air quality and other environmental problems that are prevalent in this region. Naucalpan already participates in the &quot;Hoy No Circula&quot; program, which restricts the use of private automobiles in Mexico City and some adjoining areas during the week and is considering extending restrictions to Saturdays as well. Its subsoil is considered to be gravely polluted, mostly due to the Bordo Poniento landfill and the sinking of the subsoil due to the over pumping of groundwater and the dumping of untreated wastewater. In addition, many small businesses such as brick making operations, public restrooms and restaurants flagrantly violate sanitation and environmental laws. However, automobiles account for 70% of the air pollution. Stronger environmental regulations have been enacted and enforced, but this has led to the abandonment of the municipality by larger industries who have relocated to the north and west. Over 200 companies have relocated from here and neighboring municipalities Tlalnepantla and Ecatepec. Industries which have left Naucalpan include metals, cement, glass-works and others that use a large quantity of energy. About twenty percent of manufacturing facilities have closed their doors and six industrial parks are empty. In addition to environmental regulation, other actors behind this rising land and rental prices, economic slowdown and competition from Asia. 

Several major roadways pass through the city and municipality, which connect the Mexico City area to parts north and west, as well as other parts of the metropolitan area. The northern section of the Anillo Periférico passes through Ciudad Satélite. There have been plans to add a second level to this roadway, but local residents have been working against it. One of the concerns is that the new roadway will damage the nearby Torres de Satélite. The recently built Viaducto Bicentenario highway, linking Mexico City with western Mexico State passes through Naucalpan and was the first section to begin operations. This section connects the Lomas Verdes section with Cuatro Caminos at the border of Mexico City. The construction of these roadways is projected to make changes in the urban landscape of the city, attracting projects such as office buildings and commercial centers. A number of projects are already in the works. The goal is to build areas here similar to Santa Fe and Interlomas. Naucalpan is strongly dependent on cars and other motorized transportation. Efforts have been made to promote bicycle use such as bike paths and free bicycle loans, but they have not been successful.

One of the best-known areas of Naucalpan is Ciudad Satélite with its signature Torres de Satélite sculpture. Ciudad Satélite was one of a number of large scale projects undertaken by the federal government in the Mexico City area in the 1950s and 1960s, along with the Conjunto Habitacional de Tlaltelolco and the Ciudad Universitaria. From the late 1940s to early 1950s, Mexico City began to grow towards the northern limits of the Federal District, and compelling urbanization into adjoining Mexico State. One of the projects conceived for the suburban zone of Naucalpan was a development called Ciudad Satélite. The project was headed by architect Luis Barragán in 1958 and financially backed the Banco Internacional Hipotecario. The city&#x27;s design and coordination was supervised by architect Mario Pani. It was designed to be a suburban community with a &quot;green corridor&quot; (highway lined by parks) connecting it to Mexico City proper. Attractive land prices created a boom market soon after the first units were sold in the mid 1960s, and over the next ten years, the green corridor disappeared. In addition to being a major bedroom community, it has been a major shopping district since the opening of the Centro Comercial Satélite in 1962.

The Torres de Satélite were constructed by architects Luis Barragan and Matias Goeritz with the collaboration of painter Jesús Reyes Ferreira in the mid 20th century. The five sculptures form prisms that range in height from . They are located in the traffic circle of one of the busiest roads in the State of Mexico. They were constructed to be symbols of the vanguard of world class design in Mexico and as a &quot;welcome&quot; of the expansion of Greater Mexico City to Naucalpan. The Torres de Satélite have been catalogued by UNESCO as architectural heritage.

The second best-known landmark in Naucalpan was recently demolished. The Toreo de Cuatro Caminos (lit. the Bullring of the Four Roads) was built in the 1940s in what was a hacienda. Over the years, the city built up and the area around the bullring became a major local transportation hub. The northwest end of the Mexico City Metro Line 2 ends here, at a large bus station which is only a couple of blocks from the Toreo. At the Toreo itself, fifteen local bus routes as well as buses to Toluca and other points west converge here. These buses clog the surrounding streets of Ingenieros Militares, Rodolfo Gaona and San Mateo. The domed roof of this bullring was a symbol of the city for many years, but in 2009, the demolition of this building began to make way for a commercial complex. Most of the bus routes have been relocated for the demolition and reconstruction, and a bus terminal is being considered for the area. Despite the loss of the building, the symbol of Metro Cuatro Caminos will remain a depiction of the dome.

In addition to Ciudad Satélite and the Toreo, other attractions here include the Cerro Moctezuma, the Villa Alpina, the Conde y Tlatilco Pyramid, a Mexica shrine in the city center and the Museum of Naucalpan. Historic structures from the colonial period include the Caracoles, the Aqueduct, the Bridge of Santa Cruz, the arches of the Sanctuary of Los Remedos, the Parish of San Luis Tlatilco. In the city center is the Museum of the Tlatilca Culture. Arena Naucalpan is a major arena in Naucalpan, Estado de México. It&#x27;s long been a home for lucha libre, and is currently the central arena of IWRG. The arena hosts a lucha libre show each Thursday and Sunday. The Naucalli Park occupies an area of forty three hectares and is a major natural area filled with trees and other vegetation. It also contains recreational and sporting facilities such as skating rinks, bike paths, playgrounds (&quot;naucalli&quot;) and the Casa de Cultura Naucalli. The Symphony Band of Naucalpan regularly plays here at its own concert hall.

The city hosts the campuses of a number of institutions of higher education. The Colegio de Ciencias y Humanidades Plantel Naucalpan is a technical college associated with UNAM. It was opened in 1971 as part of the decentralization of UNAM&#x27;s activities. Most of the majors are related to science and technology. Other educational institutions which have facilities in Naucalpan include the Universidad Nuevo Mundo; Universidad de Norteamérica, the Colegio en Alta Dirreción Empresarial, and the Universidad del Valle de Mexico. The Universidad Autónoma del Estado de México has plans to build a campus here in 2010 as part of its expansion efforts.

On Pafununcio Padilla there are two five-story buildings which are locally called &quot;Los Esqueletos&quot; or The Skeletons. These are two buildings which have been abandoned for thirty five years when their owner died intestate during construction. Since then they have had problems with indigents and vandalism, causing fear in neighbors. By law, the buildings pass on to the owner&#x27;s sons, but they have never done the paperwork to claim them.

==The Virgin of Los Remedios==
The patroness of the city and municipality of Naucalpan is the Virgin of Los Remedios. She is a small image of the Virgin Mary, measuring in height. This image is strongly linked with the Spanish Conquest, especially the episode known as the &quot;Noche Triste&quot; or Night of Sorrows. It is said he led his men to an indigenous religious sanctuary to escape the Aztecs, stopping here on their way to Otumba. According to legend, one of Cortés’ soldiers, Gonzalo Rodríguez de Villafuerte, was carrying a small image of the Virgin Mary and hid her under one of the maguey plants in order to retrieve and pay homage to her later if he survived. During a later battle in this area, the Spanish reported seeing a young girl throwing dirt into the eyes of the Aztecs to help the Spanish. Another legend states that this image appeared at the Cerro de los Pajaros, where a chapel was built in 1574, which later was expanded in 1628 with a vaulted roof and cupola. Being connected with the Conquest, this image of the Virgin is considered to be &quot;Spanish&quot; and a patroness to them and to the indigenous who adopt Spanish ways. She is considered one of the Virgins who correlate with the four cardinal directions (in her case, the west), along with the Virgins of Tepeyac, of Piedad and de la Bala. 

Despite her importance to the area, this image was kept at the Mexico City Cathedral until 1810. In that year, she was moved to her sanctuary in Naucalpan, dressed as a general. She was proclaimed as a patroness of Spain and the &quot;guardian of the Spanish Army.&quot; The purpose of this was to counter Miguel Hidalgo&#x27;s use of the Virgin of Guadalupe as a symbol of his independence movement.

This image was center of one of the first annual processions to be held in Mexico, which went from the Church of Santa Veracruz in Mexico City to her home sanctuary in Naucalpan. Her feast day is still celebrated on September 1, On this day, the sanctuary is profusely decorated with white flowers, which includes a carpet of flower petals in the San Miguel Arcangel esplanade. This sanctuary is not located in the city proper, but in the mountainous western part of the municipality where the Los Remedios National Park stands. Her feast day is celebrated with dances knowns as &quot;Los Apaches,&quot; &quot;Los Moros,&quot; &quot;Chichimecas&quot; and &quot;Pastorcitas&quot;. The 450th anniversary was celebrated in 1990.

==The municipality==

The part of the city that lies within Naucalpan Municipality is nearly co-extensive with the municipality, with only the Los Remedios National Park and several ejidos remaining mostly unurbanized. The municipality consists of 233 neighborhoods in the city proper, 18 small villages, 71 residential developments and two rural housing developments. Together, these localities cover an extension of 149.86km2. The municipality is located in the Valley of Mexico, just northeast of Mexico City and northwest of Mexico State capital of Toluca. The municipality borders the municipalities of Atizapan de Zaragoza, Tlalnepantla de Baz, Jilotzingo, Huixquilucan de Degollado, Xonacatlán and Lerma with the Mexico City Federal District to the east and southeast.

The highest peaks are the Organo and La Malinche mountains at above sea level. Other notable elevations include la Cantera, El Cedral, San Joselito, La Plantación and Peña del Rayo. The main rivers through the area include the Totolina, San Lorenzo and Los Remedios. Water supply for the municipality is supplemented by 28 deep wells, and an aqueduct that brings water from the Lerma River. It has a temperate climate with a rainy season in the summer and early fall. Freezing temperatures occur between November and February, but the last significant snowfall occurred in 1967. Vegetation outside the city proper consists of conifers and oaks, with orchards of fruit trees such as plums, apples and pears. Most wildlife consists of small mammals such as squirrels and opossums along with small reptiles and birds. However, deforestation is a major problem.
There are eight ejidos, five of which are dedicated to agriculture and the rest to other activities. Agricultural production includes animal feed, barley, beans, corn, wheat, avocados, peaches and cactus fruit. Livestock includes cattle, pigs, sheep and domestic fowl. There is also some trout farming. Building stone, sand and gravel are still mined here. However, the overwhelming majority of the municipality&#x27;s economic activity is the industry and commerce in the city proper.

The major un-urbanized area of the municipality is the Los Remedios National Park, located in the far west. This park was established by decrees in 1938 by the federal government with an area of 400 hectares. Within its borders is the Sanctuary of the Virgin of Los Remedios, a colonial era aqueduct and a pre-Hispanic archeological zone with a Chichimeca temple. All of these are located in and around the mountain called Cerro Moctezuma. The site was an Aztec observatory and is also believed to be where Cortés and his men rested after fleeing Tenochtitlan.

The aqueduct is long and consists of fifty arches which measure high and extend into the ground. The first stage was built in 1616 under viceroy Diego Fernandez de Cordoba with the objective of bringing water to the Sanctuary of Los Remedios from a spring at the village of San Francisco Chimalpa. This water was also used to irrigate fields in the villages of San Bartolomé, Santa Maria Nativitas and Santa Cruz. The aqueduct is mostly of clay pipes with two large spiral towers to release air. These towers flank the Sanctuary of the Virgin of Los Remedios and are nicknamed &quot;caracoles&quot; (snails) By 1764, the amount of water this system delivered was no longer enough and viceroy Joaquín de Monserrat had the arched system built, which was finished in 1765. Eventually, this system could not deliver water and became simply an architectural monument.

Seventy five percent of the original surface of the park now has illegal settlements, including settlements which have been authorized by local authorities. While these settlements can be confiscated and destroyed under federal law, this has not happened. The federal environmental agency Profepa has received complaints about the most recent invasions into the park area, which as felled dozens of trees. The agency has responded with inspections of plans by a developer to build two subdivisions near the colonial era aqueduct to verify if the land is private or public. One reason for this is that the park lacks conservation plans, fences and other means to fend off development efforts. The illegal settlements and development have also affected adjoining ejido land that adjoin the park. This and the fact that housing is now starting to encroach the archeological zone has prompted the involvement of INAH and the organization of neighboring communities to protest.

===Towns and villages===
The largest localities (cities, towns, and villages) are:
== Economy ==
Naucalpan is one of the most powerful municipalities in the country; in the area next to Mexico City there&#x27;s many little and medium-sized businesses; such as pharmaceutical labs, spare parts businesses and chemical products and textile manufacturing factories.

The commercial and services sector is important, in the last 40 years it&#x27;s grown. Its thrive begun with the opening of the Plaza Satélite mall in 1971. In 2007 another mall was built: La Cúspide Sky Mall.

According to the Reyes-Barreto-Rodríguez (2007) study of the wealth distribution in the State of Mexico, Naucalpan de Juárez in the year 2000 generated enough wealth to cover the necessities of their citizens twice, in contrast to other municipalities that only create one third of the needs of their citizens in a year. Naucalpan and its neighbor Ecatepec host the 19% of the population of the State of Mexico and both produce a bit more than 22% of the income of the state.

==Twin towns – sister cities==

==Geography==
===Climate===
Subtropical highland variety of the oceanic climate exists in elevated portions of the world that are within either the tropics or subtropics, though it is typically found in mountainous locations in some tropical countries. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cwb&quot; (oceanic subtropical highland climate).

<doc id="1081538" wikidata="Q5156594" url="?curid=1081538" title="Complex polygon">
<text>The term complex polygon can mean two different things:

* In geometry, a polygon in the unitary plane, which has two complex dimensions.
* In computer graphics, a polygon whose boundary is not simple.

==Geometry==

In geometry, a complex polygon is a polygon in the complex Hilbert plane, which has two complex dimensions.

A complex number may be represented in the form formula_1, where formula_2 and formula_3 are real numbers, and formula_4 is the square root of formula_5. Multiples of formula_4 such as formula_7 are called &quot;imaginary numbers&quot;. A complex number lies in a complex plane having one real and one imaginary dimension, which may be represented as an Argand diagram. So a single complex dimension comprises two spatial dimensions, but of different kinds - one real and the other imaginary.

The unitary plane comprises two such complex planes, which are orthogonal to each other. Thus it has two real dimensions and two imaginary dimensions.

A complex polygon is a (complex) two-dimensional (i.e. four spatial dimensions) analogue of a real polygon. As such it is an example of the more general complex polytope in any number of complex dimensions.

In a &quot;real&quot; plane, a visible figure can be constructed as the &quot;real conjugate&quot; of some complex polygon.

== Computer graphics ==


In computer graphics, a complex polygon is a polygon which has a boundary comprising discrete circuits, such as a polygon with a hole in it.

Self-intersecting polygons are also sometimes included among the complex polygons. Vertices are only counted at the ends of edges, not where edges intersect in space.

A formula relating an integral over a bounded region to a closed line integral may still apply when the &quot;inside-out&quot; parts of the region are counted negatively.

<text>The small-eared skink (Oligosoma stenotis) is found only on Stewart Island/Rakiura, New Zealand. It was first described in 1994 by Geoff Patterson and Charles Daugherty. It is a moderately small (80 mm snout to vent) skink, that lives in one of the most inhospitable (to lizards) environments on earth.

<text>The enzyme urate oxidase (UO), uricase or factor-independent urate hydroxylase, absent in humans, catalyzes the oxidation of uric acid to 5-hydroxyisourate:

:Uric acid + O2 + H2O → 5-hydroxyisourate + H2O2
:5-hydroxyisourate + H2O → 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline 
:2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline → allantoin + CO2

== Structure ==

Urate oxidase is mainly localised in the liver, where it forms a large electron-dense paracrystalline core in many peroxisomes. The enzyme exists as a tetramer of identical subunits, each containing a possible type 2 copper-binding site.

Urate oxidase is a homotetrameric enzyme containing four identical active sites situated at the interfaces between its four subunits. UO from &quot;A. flavus&quot; is made up of 301 residues and has a molecular weight of 33438 daltons. It is unique among the oxidases in that it does not require a metal atom or an organic co-factor for catalysis. Sequence analysis of several organisms has determined that there are 24 amino acids which are conserved, and of these, 15 are involved with the active site.

== Reaction mechanism ==
Urate oxidase is the first enzyme in a pathway of three enzymes to convert uric acid to S-(+)-allantoin. After uric acid is converted to 5-hydroxyisourate by urate oxidase, 5-hydroxyisourate (HIU) is converted to 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline (OHCU) by HIU hydrolase, and then to S-(+)-allantoin by 2-oxo-4-hydroxy-4-carboxy-5-ureidoimidazoline decarboxylase (OHCU decarboxylase). Without HIU hydrolase and OHCU decarboxylase, HIU will spontaneously decompose into racemic allantoin.

The active site binds uric acid (and its analogues), allowing it to interact with O2. According to X-ray crystallography, it is the conjugate base of uric acid that binds and is then deprotonated to a dianion. The dianion is stabilized by extensive hydrogen-bonding, e.g., to Arg 176 and Gln 228 . Oxygen accepts two electrons from the urate dianion, via a sequence of one-electron transfers, ultimately yielding hydrogen peroxide and the dehydrogenated substrate. The dehydrourate adds water (hydrates) to produce 5-hydroxyisourate.

Urate oxidase is known to be inhibited by both cyanide and chloride ions. Inhibition involves anion-π interactions between the inhibitor and the uric acid substrate.

==Significance of absence in humans==
Urate oxidase is found in nearly all organisms, from bacteria to mammals, but is inactive in humans and all apes (great and lesser apes), having been lost in hominoid ancestors during primate evolution. This means that instead of producing allantoin as the end product of purine oxidation, the pathway ends with uric acid. This leads to humans having much higher and more highly variable levels of urate in the blood than most other mammals.

Genetically, the loss of urate oxidase function in humans was caused by two nonsense mutations at codons 33 and 187 and an aberrant splice site.

It has been proposed that the loss of urate oxidase gene expression has been advantageous to hominoids, since uric acid is a powerful antioxidant and scavenger of singlet oxygen and radicals. Its presence provides the body with protection from oxidative damage, thus prolonging life and decreasing age-specific cancer rates.

However, uric acid plays a complex physiological role in several processes, including inflammation and danger signalling, and modern purine-rich diets can lead to hyperuricaemia, which is linked to many diseases including an increased risk of developing gout.

== Medical uses ==
Urate oxidase is formulated as a protein drug (rasburicase) for the treatment of acute hyperuricemia in patients receiving chemotherapy. A PEGylated form of urate oxidase, pegloticase, was FDA approved in 2010 for the treatment of chronic gout in adult patients refractory to &quot;conventional therapy&quot;.

== Disease relevance ==

Children with non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma (NHL), specifically with Burkitt&#x27;s lymphoma and B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), often experience tumor lysis syndrome (TLS), which occurs when breakdown of tumor cells by chemotherapy releases uric acid and cause the formation of uric acid crystals in the renal tubules and collecting ducts. This can lead to kidney failure and even death. Studies suggest that patients at a high risk of developing TLS may benefit from the administration of urate oxidase. However, humans lack the subsequent enzyme HIU hydroxylase in the pathway to degrade uric acid to allantoin, so long-term urate oxidase therapy could potentially have harmful effects because of toxic effects of HIU.

Higher uric acid levels have also been associated with epilepsy. However, it was found in mouse models that disrupting urate oxidase actually decreases brain excitability and susceptibility to seizures.

Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is often a side effect of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), driven by donor T cells destroying host tissue. Uric acid has been shown to increase T cell response, so clinical trials have shown that urate oxidase can be administered to decrease uric acid levels in the patient and subsequently decrease the likelihood of GVHD.

==In legumes==
UO is also an essential enzyme in the ureide pathway, where nitrogen fixation occurs in the root nodules of legumes. The fixed nitrogen is converted to metabolites that are transported from the roots throughout the plant to provide the needed nitrogen for amino acid biosynthesis.

In legumes, 2 forms of uricase are found: in the roots, the tetrameric form; and, in the uninfected cells of root nodules, a monomeric form, which plays an important role in nitrogen-fixation.

== Convergent evolution ==
Urate oxidase is a notable example of the existence of non-homologous isofunctional enzymes, proteins with independent evolutionary origin catalyzing the same chemical reaction. 

Besides the cofactorless urate oxidase (UOX), which is found in all three domains of life, other bacterial proteins are known that catalyze the same reaction without being evolutionarily related to UOX. These are two different oxidases (named HpxO and HpyO) that use FAD and NAD+ as cofactors, and one integral membrane protein (named PuuD) that additionally contains a cytochrome c protein domain.

<doc id="1081556" wikidata="Q1390974" url="?curid=1081556" title="Face to Face (punk band)">
<text>Face to Face is a punk rock band from Victorville, California, formed in 1991 by frontman Trever Keith, bassist Matt Riddle and drummer Rob Kurth. The band rose to fame with their 1995 album &quot;Big Choice&quot;, featuring the radio hit &quot;Disconnected&quot; which received heavy rotation on KROQ radio in Los Angeles and appeared in the movies &quot;Tank Girl&quot; and &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Senior Trip&quot;.

Face to Face officially split up in September 2004, allowing the band members time to focus on other projects. During that time all the band members played in a number of post-Face to Face projects including Legion of Doom, Me First and the Gimme Gimmes, The Offspring and Saves the Day. In April 2008, after a four-year hiatus, Face to Face performed together for the first time at The Glasshouse in Pomona, California. Since then, the band has continued to perform and has released five more studio albums to date.

==History==

===Beginnings (1987–1992)===
Face to Face can trace its beginnings to 1987 when Trever Keith (vocals, synthesizers) and Matt Riddle (bass, background vocals), who had both been friends since high school, and formed a heavy metal band named Victoria Manor that also featured Todd &quot;Rick&quot; Atmire (guitars) and Matt Atmire (drums). Other than one demo tape they released in 1989, Victor Manor never released any albums and after they disbanded, Keith and Riddle formed a band named Zero Tolerance with drummer Rob Kurth and guitarist Mark Haake who were both Air Force members stationed at George Air Force Base outside of Victorville. Like Victor Manor, Zero Tolerance never released a full-length album, but they recorded one demo tape in 1990 with the aforementioned line-up. By the following year, the band decided to take a new musical direction and changed their name to Face to Face. Shortly afterwards, guitarist Mark Haake left the band and the remaining members continued on as a three-piece.

The band continued to play frequently throughout the Inland Empire and Orange County and quickly became a local favorite alongside bands like The Offspring, Guttermouth, Voodoo Glow Skulls, and others. At a show in Montclair, CA in May 1991, the band met Bill Plaster of Dr. Strange Records and was offered a record deal. After accepting Plaster&#x27;s offer, Face to Face entered Westbeach Recorders studio located in Hollywood, CA in October 1991 to record songs for their first album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Away&quot; (1992). Once the recording was finished, Dr. Strange Records had difficulty raising the financial resources to have the recordings pressed; in the interim, the band met Jim Goodwin. Goodwin offered to record the band&#x27;s newest songs for free so they entered the studio in August 1992 and recorded &quot;Nothing New,&quot; &quot;Pastel,&quot; and &quot;Disconnected&quot;. These three songs ended up being included on &quot;Don&#x27;t Turn Away&quot; along with the songs recorded at Westbeach Recorders.

===Success (1993–1997)===
In 1993, following a three-week tour in Germany supporting Lagwagon, Face to Face added Chad Yaro as an additional guitarist and new manager Desi Benjamin and began writing material for a new record. Before the band began recording the new material, they decided to sign a recording contract with a new major label and publishing deal which Desi Benjamin secured for them with JVC/Victory/A&amp;M Records and E.M.I. Music Publishing. On the heels of the new recording contract, Face to Face entered the studio with producer Thom Wilson (of The Offspring fame) and began recording the album that became known as &quot;Big Choice&quot;.

After finishing the recording, Victory Music decided they wanted to test their distribution system with a new release. To do so they assembled an EP of songs featured on several of the band&#x27;s 7&quot; records along with other unreleased recordings. This EP was titled &quot;Over It&quot; and was released several weeks before &quot;Big Choice&quot;. The EP contained a remixed version of the song &quot;Disconnected&quot;. This version began to receive significant airplay from KROQ in Los Angeles, California. This drove the label to push the band to re-record &quot;Disconnected&quot; for &quot;Big Choice&quot;. It was featured as a bonus track alongside a cover of the Descendents song &quot;Bikeage&quot;.

After touring with bands such as Sublime, NOFX, The Mighty Mighty Bosstones, and The Offspring in 1995 supporting Big Choice, bassist Matt Riddle chose to leave the band. Riddle went on to play in 22 Jacks, Pulley, No Use for a Name, Implants, and most recently Fire Sale. The band replaced him with a then-unknown bassist, Scott Shiflett. Scott&#x27;s first show with the band was on December 2, 1995, at the Victorville Fairgrounds.

In 1996, Face to Face began writing and recording what was to become their third album self-titled. This was the first record without Matt Riddle, who had been Keith&#x27;s songwriting partner. Due to this, Keith wrote the majority of the songs on the album with some help from Shiflett and Yaro. In the studio, the band once again recruited Jim Goodwin to record and produce the record. Following the release of the album, they headlined the 1997 SnoCore Tour and joined the Warped Tour. Their song &quot;I Won&#x27;t Lie Down&quot; was featured on the 1997 movie Mortal Kombat Annihilation soundtrack.

===Later years (1998–2004)===
In 1998, it was announced that drummer Rob Kurth was leaving the band. To finish out the tour for their self-titled record, the band hired drummer Jose Medeles. After the tour ended, Pete Parada joined the band as Kurth&#x27;s permanent replacement. With Parada behind the drums, the band recorded and released two more albums (with producer Chad Blinman), &quot;Ignorance Is Bliss&quot; (1999) and &quot;Reactionary&quot; (2000). Following the release of Reactionary, long-time guitarist Chad Yaro left the band to focus on his family.

Following Yaro&#x27;s departure, Face to Face decided to remain a three-piece and began writing material for their sixth studio album, &quot;How to Ruin Everything&quot;, which was released on Vagrant Records in 2002. Following the release of How to Ruin Everything, the band headlined The Warped Tour.

In the fall of 2003, the band began a temporary hiatus; however, the following year, they announced that their hiatus would be permanent. They gave their fans a proper farewell with &quot;The Only Goodbye Tour&quot; of 2004 with supporting acts My Chemical Romance and Seconds to Go, which followed with a raucous Warped Tour finale in Boston.

===Reunion and beyond (2008–present)===
On January 29, 2008, Face to Face announced that the band would be reuniting for select shows in the US and internationally, with the lineup including Trever Keith on vocals and guitar, Scott Shiflett on bass and Chad Yaro returning on guitar. Later that same year the band launched a short U.S. tour with former Uprising drummer Danny Thompson replacing Pete Parada, who had recently joined The Offspring. This lineup recorded Face to Face&#x27;s first studio album in nine years, &quot;Laugh Now, Laugh Later&quot; (2011), followed by &quot;Three Chords and a Half Truth&quot; (2013); both albums were released on Keith&#x27;s label Antagonist Records. After the release of &quot;Three Chords and a Half Truth&quot;, Yaro once again left Face to Face and was replaced by Dennis Hill.

In September 2015, it was announced that the band had signed with Fat Wreck Chords and was headed to the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, Colorado to begin recording their ninth album. This album was released on March 4, 2016, and is titled &quot;Protection&quot;. In August 2018 the band released an acoustic record titled, &quot;Hold Fast&quot;.

In December 2017, the band released a visual history coffee table book, &quot;Face to Face: 25 Years of SoCal Punk&quot;, with author Aaron Tanner.

As of April 2020, according to an interview with Trever Keith, a new Face to Face album is in the works. The album &quot;No Way out but through&quot; was released on September 10, 2021.

<doc id="1081560" wikidata="Q277682" url="?curid=1081560" title="Ultrasaurus">
<text>Ultrasaurus (meaning &quot; lizard&quot;) is a genus of sauropod dinosaur discovered by Haang Mook Kim in South Korea. However, the name was first used unofficially (as a &quot;nomen nudum&quot;) in 1979 by Jim Jensen to describe a set of giant dinosaur bones he discovered in the United States. Because Kim published the name for his specimen before Jensen could do so officially, Jensen renamed his specimen &quot;Ultrasauros&quot;. Jensen&#x27;s giant sauropod was later found to be a chimera, and the type remains are now assigned to &quot;Supersaurus&quot;.

==Mistaken assessments==
A collection of bones discovered by Jim Jensen, of Brigham Young University, at the Dry Mesa Quarry, Colorado were originally believed to belong to the largest dinosaur ever. Jensen informally called this supposedly new dinosaur &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot;, and this name was widely used by the press and in scientific literature as a &quot;nomen nudum&quot; (informal name lacking an actual scientific description).

In 1983, Kim Hang-mook published a paper describing a different specimen representing a new dinosaur species, which he named Ultrasaurus tabriensis, because he believed it was bigger than &quot;Supersaurus&quot;. However, Kim&#x27;s assessment was incorrect. His dinosaur was much smaller than he believed, because he mistook a partial humerus for an ulna. However, since Kim was the first to publish the name &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot;, the name officially applied to the small South Korean sauropod, and could no longer be used as an official name for Jensen&#x27;s giant specimen.

Jensen published a paper describing his original discovery in 1985, but since the name &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot; was already in use (or &quot;preoccupied&quot;), his discovery was renamed in 1991 to &quot;Ultrasauros&quot;. However, Jensen also made a mistake. His discovery was a chimera; the collection of fossils came from two different dinosaur species, both of which already had names. So his new name, &quot;Ultrasauros&quot;, is now just an alternate name (&quot;junior synonym&quot;) for the dinosaur officially known as &quot;Supersaurus&quot;, because the holotype of the &quot;Ultrasauros&quot; b

==Description==
&quot;Ultrasaurus&quot; lived 100 to 110 million years ago, during the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous. It is known from the holotype DGBU-1973, which consists of part of an upper forearm (humerus), and DGBU-1978-A, a single tailbone (vertebrae) from the Gugyedong Formation, belonging to the Hayang Group.

==Classification==
Kim&#x27;s &quot;Ultrasaurus&quot; is currently a &quot;nomen dubium&quot;. Not enough is known about the specimen to formally assign it to a specific family of sauropods.

<doc id="1081561" wikidata="Q214940" url="?curid=1081561" title="Estudiantes de La Plata">
<text> ( lit. &quot;La Plata Students&quot;), simply referred to as Estudiantes de La Plata, is an Argentine professional sports club based in La Plata. The club&#x27;s football team currently competes in the Primera División, where it has spent most of its history.

The club is a successful team in Argentina. In 1967, Estudiantes was the first team outside the traditional &quot;big five&quot; to win a professional league title. It has won four additional league titles and has had greater international success, having won six international titles. Estudiantes&#x27; international title championships are four Copa Libertadores (including three straight from 1968 to 1970), an Intercontinental Cup, and an Interamerican Cup.

The club was founded in 1905 when a group of players and fans decided to break away from Gimnasia de La Plata, which favored indoor sport rather than football. Matches between the two clubs are known as the &quot;Clásico Platense&quot;.

Other sports where Estudiantes competes are basketball, team handball, field hockey, golf, swimming, judo, and volleyball.

==History==
===First years===
In 1905, a group of football players and fans in the city of La Plata decided to break away from Gimnasia y Esgrima, the major club in the city, since Gimnasia&#x27;s management neglected football after the closure of their field on 13th and 71st streets.
Thus, on 4 August 1905, in the shoestore &quot;New York&quot; on 7th Street, between 57 and 58 of the city of La Plata, the club was founded under the name &quot;Club Atlético Estudiantes&quot;. Its first president, Miguel Gutiérrez, was elected on the very same night, when the club charter was drafted by card-carrying member #1, Alfredo Lartigue. Since its inception, the organization primarily was dedicated to football, but over the years the club expanded and incorporated basketball, handball, field hockey, tennis, swimming and golf, among others.

In those days, teams like Lomas A.C., Quilmes, Belgrano A.C., Estudiantil Porteño, San Isidro and Argentino de Quilmes, among others, faced each other in successive tournaments organized by the Argentine Football Association with Alumni (graduates of the Buenos Aires English High School) being one of the most successful.

On 28 February 1906 Estudiantes adopted a jersey design of striped red and white, in honor of Alumni, that had won ten championships between 1900 and 1911. However, during the early years, Estudiantes had to use a red shirt with a white stripe in the chest, because league authorities decided the uniform was too similar to Alumni&#x27;s.

===First title===
The first pitch of the club was located at the intersection of 19th and 53rd streets in La Plata (now Plaza Islas Malvinas), with the first match being played on 7 November 1905, when Estudiantes faced Nacional Juniors from Buenos Aires. A year later, Estudiantes enrolled in the Associación Amateurs de Football (AAF). The stadium on 1st Avenue opened on 25 December 1907.

Estudiantes&#x27; first achievement was the 1911 Primera B title which allowed the team to play at the top tier of Argentine football, Primera División. Just two years later Estudiantes won its first title in Primera, playing at the dissident Federación Argentina de Football (FAF). That season the team disputed 18 matches, winning 14 with only 1 lost and scoring 64 goals (with an average of 3,55 goals per match).

In 1914 Estudiantes made another great campaign but the team finished second to Porteño. 1919 saw Estudiantes finishing second to champion Boca Juniors although the Association put an end to the tournament with 14 fixtures still to be played. The Association alleged that &quot;the championship took longer than expected&quot; so it was suddenly finished.

In subsequent years, Estudiantes made irregular campaigns, in some cases finishing at the bottom of the table. Nevertheless, the team made a great performance in 1928 when finishing third to champion Huracán and Boca Juniors. The last year of amateur era saw Estudiantes being runner-up to Boca Juniors. The team totalized 56 points in 35 matches, with 27 won and 7 losses.

===&quot;The Professors&quot;===

When professionalism was adopted in Argentine football in 1931, Estudiantes had a famous offensive lineup: Miguel Ángel Lauri, Alejandro Scopelli, Alberto Zozaya, Manuel Ferreira and Enrique Guaita, known as &quot;Los Profesores&quot; (&quot;The Professors&quot;), and still regarded as one of Argentina&#x27;s all-time finest. Alberto Zozaya scored the first goal of professional football in Argentina and was the top goalscorer of the first professional tournament. Ferreira played for the national team in the 1928 Olympic Games and the 1930 World Cup; Guaita and Scopelli played for Italian national team that won the 1934 FIFA World Cup. Saúl Calandra, the Sbarra brothers (Raúl and Roberto) and Armando Nery were feared defensive players.

In 1937, a pioneering lighting system was installed in the stadium, allowing night games to be played.

The 1940s saw the emergence of goalkeeper Gabriel Ogando, and players such as Walter Garcerón, Alberto Bouché, Juan Urriolabeitía, Ricardo Infante, Héctor Antonio, as well as the final seasons of striker Manuel Pelegrina, who remains Estudiantes&#x27; all-time top scorer with 221 goals. Following a confrontation with the Peronist government of Buenos Aires Province, the club&#x27;s management was removed by authorities (allegedly for refusing to distribute copies of Eva Perón&#x27;s book to club members) The government-appointed management disbanded the team: top scorers Infante and Pelegrina signed with Huracán. The decimated team was relegated in 1953, but after the return of Pelegrina (who tricked Huracán by becoming a free agent without the club&#x27;s consent), Estudiantes was promoted the following year. The club was allowed to govern itself soon thereafter.

In the 1960s, Miguel Ignomiriello coached the Estudiantes under-19 team known as &quot;La Tercera que Mata&quot; (&quot;The Killer Juveniles&quot;), which would evolve, with a few acquisitions, into the team coached by Osvaldo Zubeldía that won the 1967 &quot;Metropolitano&quot; championship. With this title, Estudiantes became the first club outside the &quot;big five&quot; (Boca Juniors, River Plate, Racing Club, Independiente and San Lorenzo) to obtain a professional title. This opened the floodgates, and soon other &quot;small&quot; clubs would do likewise (Vélez Sársfield in 1968, Chacarita Juniors one year later, and soon other teams joined as well).

===International success===

Estudiantes went on to win the Copa Libertadores three years in a row (1968, 1969 and 1970), and the 1968 Intercontinental Cup against Manchester United. The latter game is still remembered for the violent behaviour of Estudiantes&#x27; players. They lost the Intercontinental title against A.C. Milan (1969) and Feyenoord (1970). Estudiantes won the maiden edition of the Copa Interamericana in a three-legged final against the reigning CONCACAF title-holders, Mexican club Toluca (the games were played in 1969, but official references call it the 1968 edition).

The last part of the Zubeldía era was marred by the antics of some players. Following a violent Intercontinental match against Milan, the entire team was arrested on orders from Argentine President Juan Carlos Onganía. In an unprecedented step, goalkeeper Alberto Poletti was suspended for life (he was later pardoned) and did time in jail, together with teammates Ramón Aguirre Suárez and Eduardo Luján Manera. Because of these events, it became a cliché to refer to Zubeldía&#x27;s football as &quot;el antifútbol&quot; (&quot;the anti-football&quot;), because of its physical violence, and its frequent resort to timewasting tactics. &quot;The Times&quot; commented that Estudiantes is &quot;one of the most despicable teams ever to emerge from South America.&quot;

Zubeldía hired former referees to lecture the team on regulations, so that his players would be able to exploit every loophole in the book. Also, he incorporated tactics that were unheard of at the time, such as playbook drills for free-kicks and corner kicks, the offside trap, and double-marking opponents.

The Zubeldía team counted two physicians among its stars: Carlos Bilardo and Raúl Horacio Madero graduated from the University of Buenos Aires Faculty of Medicine during their playing days. Juan Ramón Verón was a gifted player who could play left wing, but would also join the midfielders or attack from the right. He profited from the no-nonsense playing of Marcos Conigliaro, Juan Miguel Echecopar and Madero, and the tactical guidance provided by Bilardo. Right-back Eduardo Luján Manera was a very talented player, but suffered from repeated injuries and did not reach his full potential. Fullback Aguirre Suárez was noted for his often violent play, and so was Luis Medina.

After the 1970 season, Carlos Bilardo retired from play and got involved in his family&#x27;s furniture business. As the team&#x27;s fortunes were declining and relegation seemed a possibility, he was called by management in mid-1971 to coach the team. Under his guidance, Estudiantes lost the 1975 Nacional title in the last day of play and made it to the 1976 Copa Libertadores.

===Carlos Bilardo era===
In the ensuing years, Bilardo alternated between coaching Estudiantes and Colombian teams. He was briefly the coach of the Colombia national team, but was called again by Estudiantes in 1982. Soon after, the team won the 1982 &quot;Metropolitano&quot; championship. Under his successor Eduardo Luján Manera, also a member of the Zubeldía&#x27;s team, Estudiantes won the 1983 &quot;Nacional&quot; tournament as well. Both wins were at the expense of a star-studded Independiente.

Those championship teams were anchored by a solid defense (Julián Camino on the right and Abel Ernesto Herrera on the left were also fearsome attackers, and José Luis Brown provided security as a sweeper), and also had three creative midfielders (José Daniel Ponce, Alejandro Sabella and Marcelo Trobbiani, with Miguel Ángel Russo to guard their backs) and two top-notch strikers (Hugo Gottardi and Guillermo Trama).

Bilardo went on to coach the Argentina national football team, that won the 1986 FIFA World Cup. The captain of Estudiantes&#x27; 1982 champions, José Luis Brown, scored the opening goal in the final match against West Germany. Four years later, Bilardo&#x27;s Argentina reached the final of the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Madero was team physician for both events, and Ricardo Echevarría, also from Estudiantes, was fitness coach.

===Decline and return to success===
Estudiantes was relegated for the second time after the 1993–94 season, and again returned to the first division the very next season, which was the breakout year for Juan Sebastián Verón (son of former player Juan Ramón). In the ensuing years, the club had irregular results, and became known mostly as the breeding ground for strikers such as Martín Palermo, Luciano Galletti, Bernardo Romeo, Ernesto Farías and Mariano Pavone, as well as other quality players such as José Ernesto Sosa and Pablo Piatti.

Bilardo returned as coach in 2003, with new management bent on rebuilding the club in his winning ways. Some young players were promoted, such as Marcos Angeleri and José Ernesto Sosa. When Bilardo departed, the team remained a contender under coaches Reinaldo Merlo and Jorge Burruchaga. The team made history when it came from behind (0–3 at half-time) to win 4–3 against Peruvian Sporting Cristal in a Libertadores match played on 21 February 2006.
On 18 May 2006, Burruchaga was replaced by another former Argentine international, Diego Simeone, who built the team around Juan Sebastián Verón, who returned to Estudiantes after 11 years. Simeone&#x27;s team was eliminated by São Paulo in a penalty shoot-out in the quarter-finals of the 2006 Copa Libertadores, but went on to an impressive campaign in the local league during the 2006 Apertura. It amassed ten consecutive wins (tying the club record), including an unprecedented 7–0 win against Gimnasia in the La Plata derby, played 15 October 2006. Estudiantes finished the regular season tied for first place with Boca Juniors (per Argentine league rules, goal difference is not used to determine the champion). A winner-take-all final match was played on 13 December 2006. Estudiantes came from behind to defeat Boca Juniors 2–1, thus securing its first division title in 23 years. During this campaign, Estudiantes defeated all the &quot;big five&quot;, allowed the fewest goals, and three of their players (Pavone, Verón and Braña) were ranked as the league&#x27;s top three by sports diary &quot;Olé&quot;.

Simeone left the team after the 2007 Apertura, and was replaced by former S.S. Lazio teammate Roberto Sensini. After a weak finish in the 2008 Clausura, Sensini was replaced with Leonardo Astrada. Under his guidance, Estudiantes reached the final of the 2008 Copa Sudamericana, which it lost to Brazilian side SC Internacional. Shortly thereafter, a string of bad results caused Astrada&#x27;s departure.
In March 2009, former player Alejandro Sabella became head coach, his first such engagement (his coaching experience was limited to being an assistant to Daniel Passarella). The team improved their standing in the local league and advanced to the final of the 2009 Copa Libertadores, winning 2–1 on aggregate over Cruzeiro after a goal-less draw in La Plata and an away win on 15 July 2009. Verón was chosen as the competition&#x27;s most valuable player, and Mauro Boselli was its top goalscorer, with a decisive header in the final match. Thus, Estudiantes earned the right to play the 2009 FIFA Club World Cup in Abu Dhabi.

In that event, Estudiantes won their semifinal match against Pohang Steelers 2–1, and lost the final against FC Barcelona 2–1 in extra time, after a 1–1 tie in regulation time.
After the Club World Cup participation, Estudiantes finished second in the 2010 Clausura (with local favorite José Sosa playing on loan), and won the 2010 Apertura after a protracted battle against Vélez Sarsfield. The team was in transition following the departure of Sosa and the sales of Boselli, right back Marcos Angeleri, and other key players.

==Facilities==

Jorge Luis Hirschi Stadium is located on 1st Avenue, between 55th and 57th Streets, in La Plata. It has a capacity for 32,530 people after the last addition of a new corner stand that was added in March 2022.

In its previous incarnation (1907 to 2005) the stadium had room for 23,000. The wooden stands behind the goal-lines were standing-room only. The stands next to the avenue were sitting-room, and were separated from the avenue by a row of tile trees. The opposite side was roofed and had the best seating arrangements. The noisiest fans used to occupy the 55th Street &quot;popular&quot;, while visiting fans were often directed to the 57th St. &quot;popular&quot;, opposite a technical high school (whose inconvenient location was responsible for the relatively small size of the pitch, at 105 x 68 m).

For some international games in the Zubeldía era, Estudiantes played in Boca Juniors&#x27; La Bombonera, noted for its intimidating acoustics.

With the erection of Estadio Ciudad de La Plata in the 1990s, both Estudiantes and Gimnasia decided initially against relocating their home games. However, Estudiantes&#x27;s field was closed down in September 2005 because of new safety regulations which forbid standing-only wooden stands. This began a sequence of political infighting between the club and City Hall. Estudiantes played some home games in the nearby Gimnasia stadium, and later used Quilmes Atlético Club&#x27;s Centenario field. There, Estudiantes made history with a come-from-behind 4–3 Libertadores win against Sporting Cristal.

In April 2006 a court decree allowed the re-opening of &quot;1 y 57&quot;, but mayor Julio Alak intervened again to prevent this from happening. Renovation work on the stadium started in 2007, and met with opposition from several groups, notably the &quot;Hoja de Tilo&quot; NGO, who claims that the works would damage the environmental balance of the park behind the stadium.

While using the city stadium, Estudiantes earned five consecutive derby wins, and had a streak of 37 games undefeated in the local league (2007–2009). When roofing work began in August 2009 to install a new roof in the city stadium, Estudiantes moved once again to Quilmes, and alternated both locations until the stadium was re-opened in November 2019. The new stadium has LED lighting, playmaster surface, and features amenities such as shopping and restaurants underneath the stands.

Estudiantes&#x27; training grounds are located in the Country Club premises in City Bell, north of La Plata.

==Supporters==
Within the La Plata area, Estudiantes was traditionally regarded as the club of the middle class, while rival side Gimnasia y Esgrima was identified with the working class. This characterization is not necessarily anchored in reality. While the two clubs have roughly the same pull in La Plata, Estudiantes has more of a nationwide following, especially after its international successes in the 1960s. There used to be much discussion about which club has the larger following, but Estudiantes seems to have pulled forward.

For several periods in the club&#x27;s history, a group of supporters from Buenos Aires (&quot;los porteños&quot;) were a powerful element within the fan base. One of the fans from 1960s to the 1990s was Raúl Bernechea, known as &quot;el pelapapas&quot; (the &quot;potato peeler&quot;) after his job as a kitchen hand; he was noted for lighting bonfires during games, juggling and performing other stunts .

Author Ernesto Sabato was an Estudiantes sympathizer, and was honored with a ceremony where he was awarded a No. 10 jersey. Political essayist Arturo Jauretche mentioned Estudiantes in one of his books .

Other noted fans include tennis player Juan Mónaco, actors Jorge and Federico D&#x27;Elía, philosopher Darío Sztajnszrajber, journalist Mauro Szeta, human rights activist Estela de Carlotto, filmmaker and politician Fernando Solanas, and sports journalist Osvaldo Príncipi.

In the 1983 presidential election, Estudiantes fans were, together with their peers from Vélez Sársfield, the first to voice their support for eventual winner Raúl Alfonsín in his bid against the Peronistas. The friendship with Vélez supporters has since vanished, especially after an Estudiantes win denied Vélez the 2003 championship.

Estudiantes is on friendly terms with several clubs from the South side of Greater Buenos Aires; especially Quilmes and Témperley. Platense, from the North side of Greater Buenos Aires, held a special place in the hearts of Estudiantes fans for some time, as it cemented Gimnasia&#x27;s relegation in 1979.

Estudiantes is also friendly with the Uruguayan fan base of Peñarol, once their classic Libertadores rivals.

== Colors and badge ==

The Estudiantes&#x27; colors (red and white) were originally taken from the shirt of legendary Alumni, the team which they admired. Apart from Estudiantes, other clubs (such as Unión de Santa Fe, Barracas Central, Talleres (RE), or Instituto (C)) would also adopt the red and white colors as a tribute to the Brown Brothers&#x27; team, the most winning club in Argentina until its dissolution in 1911.

Estudiantes also shares colors with Spanish side Athletic Bilbao, and during a period in the 1950s, both institutions shared a reputation for confronting the government (Bilbao as a Basque nationalist side against the Franco regime, and Estudiantes against Peronism). During these times, Bilbao donated a set of jerseys to Estudiantes. The relationship has been rekindled in the 2000s through Argentine expatriates and partisan blogs.

The traditional badge has undergone minor modifications in its history since its inception in 1920, sometimes alternating with a design that resembled a pennant (introduced in 1934) with an &quot;E&quot; at the center and oak leaves at background.

==Nicknames==
The nickname &quot;pincharratas&quot; (rat stabbers), often shortened to &quot;pinchas&quot;, comes from the nickname of Felipe Montedónica, who spent much time chasing after rats in the La Plata market in the 1910s and 1920s, and hence was known as &quot;el pincharratas&quot;. Pictures exist of Montedónica with some of the players, where his nickname is mentioned. Traditionally, the nickname is also associated with the laboratory work done by the many medicine students among the club&#x27;s early members.

This nickname extends to the fans. It is common to hear fans say &quot;soy del pincha&quot; (&quot;I am &quot;pincha&quot;&quot;).

Fans also call the team &quot;el león&quot; (the lion), &quot;el orgullo de la ciudad&quot; (the pride of the city), &quot;los capos de La Plata&quot; (the bosses of La Plata), and &quot;el único campeón de la ciudad&quot; (the only one champion of the city), because they are the only team in the city that has won an official tournament.

For several years, many chants incorporated the word &quot;Tricampeón&quot; (three-time champion) because of the Libertadores three-peat. After the 2009 Libertadores final, some of the newer lyrics use the word &quot;Tetracampeón&quot; (four-time champion).

<text>The 1995 New Brunswick general election was held on September 11, 1995, to elect the 55 members of the 53rd New Brunswick Legislative Assembly.

The Liberals won their third consecutive majority government, with Premier McKenna&#x27;s personal popularity aiding the Liberals in retaining a large majority. The PCs managed only 6 seats, while the CoR lost all theirs. The combined PC-CoR vote exceeded that of the Liberals in an additional 10 ridings (Albert, Fundy Isles, Kings East, Mactaquac, Petitcodiac, Saint John-Fundy, Southwest Miramichi, Victoria-Tobique, Western Charlotte and Woodstock).

==Background==
The election marked the debut of Bernard Valcourt as a provincial politician, and as leader of a reinvigorated Progressive Conservative Party. A popular politician from Edmundston, Valcourt had served as an MP from 1984 to 1993, serving in the cabinets of Prime Ministers Brian Mulroney and Kim Campbell. The New Brunswick PCs had been in the political wilderness for the better part of a decade; they were shut out of the legislature in 1987, and only managed a third-place showing with 3 seats in 1991. The internal disarray of the CoR party had vacated room on the right for the PCs, and polls suggested a more competitive race than in the previous few elections.

Frank McKenna&#x27;s Liberal Party sought a third term in government, as the Confederation of Regions (CoR) party struggled to survive after considerable internal strife. Elizabeth Weir tried to expand her New Democratic Party&#x27;s foothold in the legislature.

This election was the first since 1974 to feature a boundary redistribution, with an overall reduction in the size of the legislature from 58 to 55 seats.

==Opinion polls==
==Results==
* Natural Law did not contest the 1991 election.

<text>Humorous Phases of Funny Faces is a 1906 short silent animated cartoon directed by James Stuart Blackton and generally regarded by film historians as the first animated film recorded on standard picture film.

== Content ==
In the cartoon, animated hand-drawn scenes appear on a chalkboard, including a clown playing with a hat and a dog jumping through a hoop. In the beginning, though, the cartoonist&#x27;s hands are included, too, as he draws the first several lines on the chalkboard in standard live action. From there, the stop-motion technique is used to show what appears to be drawings completing—and then moving—by themselves with no artist on screen.

== Techniques ==

Stop-motion as well as cutout animation are used, just as Edwin Porter moved his letters in &quot;How Jones Lost His Roll&quot;, and &quot;The Whole Dam Family and the Dam Dog&quot;. However, there is a very short section of the film where things are made to appear to move by altering the drawings themselves from frame to frame.

The film moves at 20 frames per second.

<text>The Haifa Oil Refinery massacre took place on 30 December 1947 in Mandatory Palestine, when 39–41 Jewish refinery workers were killed by their Arab coworkers in a mass lynching.

The massacre was a response to an Irgun terrorist attack, where grenades were thrown into a crowd of about 100 day-labourers waiting at a bus stop outside the main gate of the then British-owned Haifa Oil Refinery. Six Arabs were killed and 42 were wounded. Minutes after the Irgun attack, Arab refinery workers and others began attacking the Jewish refinery workers, resulting in 39–41 deaths and 49 injuries, before the British Army and Palestine Police units arrived to put an end to the violence. This came to be known as the &quot;Haifa Oil Refinery massacre&quot;. Haganah later retaliated by attacking two nearby Arab villages in what became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre, where between 60 and 70 Arabs were killed.

==Background==
Relations between Jews and Arabs at the refinery had been known to be good. However, tensions rose in 1947–48 in the wake of the 1947 UN Partition Plan. On 30 December 1947, Irgun militants hurled two bombs from a passing car into a crowd of Arab workers, 6 workers were killed and 42 wounded. Irgun, who planned and carried out the attack on the day-laborers, said it was in retaliation for recent attacks elsewhere on Jews in Palestine.

==Attack==
Arab workers stormed the refinery armed with tools and metal rods, beating 39–41 Jewish workers to death and wounding 49. British forces arrived only an hour after the riot started. According to the Jewish Agency, some Arab workers helped their Jewish co-workers hide or escape.

==Aftermath==
===Balad al-Shaykh massacre===

The Jewish Agency condemned the Irgun for the &quot;act of madness&quot; that preceded the killing of Jewish workers at the Haifa oil refinery, but at the same time authorized retaliation. The Haganah mounted a retaliatory raid which became known as the Balad al-Shaykh massacre on the villages of Balad al-Shaykh and nearby Hawassa, where some of the Arab refinery workers lived. They fired into and blew up houses. Between 60 and 70 villagers were killed, including women and children. Zachary Lockman wrote that &quot;the Jewish attackers killed some sixty men, women, and children and destroyed several dozen houses.&quot;

<doc id="1081576" wikidata="Q1163718" url="?curid=1081576" title="Hepcat (band)">
<text>Hepcat is a ska and reggae band formed in southern California in 1989. Their soulful harmonies and mellow rhythms were unlike those of contemporaries and more akin to musicians from the heyday of 1960s Jamaican ska (also referred to as the first wave) with elements of soul, jazz and R&amp;B.

==Career==
Hepcat&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Out of Nowhere&quot; was released in 1993 on the New York-based ska label Moon Records. Two years later, they followed it up with &quot;Scientific&quot; on BYO Records. In 1998, after signing with Epitaph Records subsidiary HellCat Records, they released &quot;Right on Time&quot;, scoring a modest hit with the swinging &quot;No Worries&quot; and scored a spot on the Vans Warped Tour. 2000 saw the release of &quot;Push n&#x27; Shove&quot;, their first album without founding members Raul Talavera and Alex Désert, although the latter appears as a guest vocalist on two tracks. He rejoined the band in 2003. 

By the early 2000s, the ska scene became oversaturated and commercially less interesting, so the band was dropped by their label. Hepcat went on a hiatus, then reunited in 2003 and continued touring. In 2007, the long-time bassist David Fuentes died, which resulted in the band being less active again. In 2015, the guitarist Aaron Owens died as well. Hepcat continues performing at concerts and festivals, but infrequently.

A few members of Hepcat have also participated in other endeavors. Trumpeter Kincaid Smith formed Soul Traffic, a five-piece funk band. Vocalist Alex Désert has had a successful career in film and television, appearing in the movies &quot;PCU&quot;, &quot;Swingers&quot;, and &quot;High Fidelity&quot;; and the television shows &quot;Boy Meets World&quot; and &quot;Becker&quot;.

The term &quot;Hepcat&quot; originates from an early slang term (1930–35) pertaining to an admirer or devotee of jazz, esp. swing, or one that was &quot;hep&quot;, or a hipster. The band is actually named after a cat once owned by vocalist Alex Desért, named &quot;Hep.&quot;

Singer Greg Lee suffered a massive brain aneurysm and cardiac arrest at his home on March 17, 2024, and died in the hospital two days later on March 19, 2024, at the age of 53.

<doc id="1081580" wikidata="Q607943" url="?curid=1081580" title="Big Boss (Metal Gear)">
<text>is a fictional character from the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series created by Hideo Kojima and developed and published by Konami. He was first introduced in the 1987 &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game as the commanding officer and father of Solid Snake, featuring in a twist as the game&#x27;s main antagonist. He is later featured in the prequel games (starting with &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;) as , an American Special Forces Operator and decorated war hero. Political manipulations cause him to be disillusioned when facing his own mentor, and he gradually develops his own private mercenary company while growing into the original Big Boss persona and being referred to as simply . In the 2015 game &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;, the Big Boss from &quot;Metal Gear&quot; is retconned as a different character from the Naked Snake Big Boss from the prequel games, being his body double and successor known as / .

The concept of Naked Snake was an attempt to distance him from Solid Snake, despite both being physically similar through their characterizations. He has been voiced by Akio Ōtsuka and Chikao Ōtsuka in the Japanese version, and by David Hayter, Kiefer Sutherland and Richard Doyle in the English translation. Critical reception to Big Boss has been positive, due to his role as a villain and his enmity with Solid Snake. His younger persona has been praised as likeable, with critics generally enjoying the execution of his character development in the series designed to shape him into a villainous icon.

==Creation and design==
In &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;, Big Boss&#x27;s visual appearance was inspired by actor Sean Connery, but for the ports of the game&#x27;s re-released version, the original design was replaced by Yoji Shinkawa&#x27;s design. During the making of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;, Hideo Kojima asked Shinkawa to make Naked Snake similar to Solid Snake, but with the differences that unlike Solid Snake, Naked Snake was a rookie and thus acted more naive. Shinkawa stated having no difficulties in designing Naked Snake as basically a revised version of Solid Snake. As a result, Naked Snake is virtually identical to Solid Snake from the previous &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; games in terms of appearance. The love scene between Naked Snake and EVA was inspired by the first &quot;Pink Panther&quot;. Kojima and Shinkawa watched the movie but the former stated it might have come different from the original version. Since the game&#x27;s trailers did not state that Naked Snake was Big Boss, Kojima often gave vague answers to the character&#x27;s true identity. Although the ending of &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; reveals Naked Snake was given the Big Boss title, Kojima stated &quot;he&#x27;s not really the Big Boss yet&quot;. With &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;, he wanted to explain how Naked Snake turned into the man who appeared in the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games as Solid Snake&#x27;s enemy.

Naked Snake as portrayed in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; is voiced by Akio Otsuka in the Japanese version and David Hayter in the English version. Hayter, despite voicing protagonist Solid Snake in previous entries, was forced to re-audition in order to secure the part of Naked Snake. Hayter told &quot;Game Informer&quot; that Kojima had hoped to hire Kurt Russell to voice Naked Snake, but that Russell declined the role. Both actors would return to provide the character&#x27;s voice in &quot;Portable Ops&quot; and &quot;Peace Walker&quot;. The elderly version of Big Boss who appears in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; was voiced by Chikao Otsuka (Akio Otsuka&#x27;s real-life father) in Japanese and by Richard Doyle in English. 

On June 6, 2013, during Konami&#x27;s third annual pre-E3 show, it was announced that Kiefer Sutherland would be replacing Hayter as the character in &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.&quot; Sutherland was assigned the role after a suggestion to Kojima from Hollywood producer and director Avi Arad; Kojima&#x27;s reason was to &quot;have a more subdued performance expressed through subtle facial movements and tone of voice rather than words&quot;, and that he &quot;needed someone who could genuinely convey both the facial and vocal qualities of a man in his late 40s&quot;. Sutherland plays the original Big Boss (who serves as the playable character in the stand-alone prologue &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes&quot;), as well as Venom Snake (a new version of the character who serves as the protagonist in the main game &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot;). In addition to the voice, Sutherland also provided facial capture for the character. Akio Otsuka reprised his role, voicing the character again in both &quot;Ground Zeroes&quot; and &quot;The Phantom Pain,&quot; additionally portraying Venom Snake in the latter.

==Appearances==
=== Main video games ===
Big Boss is introduced in the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game as the Special Forces Unit FOXHOUND&#x27;s leader and Solid Snake&#x27;s commanding officer. He initially acts as a radio contact who provides Snake with information about mission objectives involving Outer Heaven, a mercenary nation in South Africa. After Snake destroys the TX-55 Metal Gear, the villain confronts Snake, acting as a twist villain. The leader is defeated and Outer Heaven is destroyed, but Big Boss vows revenge. He reappears in the game&#x27;s sequel &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;, where Big Boss has taken control of Zanzibar Land, a fortified nation in Central Asia. Snake confronts Big Boss once again while escaping from Zanzibar Land&#x27;s detention camp, with Snake incinerating Big Boss.

Despite his apparent death, Big Boss features prominently in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; where his DNA was revealed to have been used to create genetically-altered clones as part of the secret &quot;Les Enfants Terribles&quot; government project, with Solid Snake, Liquid Snake, and Solidus Snake

The prequel &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;, set in 1964, depicts a younger incarnation of the character, under the codename of Naked Snake, as a member of the CIA special forces unit FOX headed by Major Zero. Snake is sent on assignment in the Soviet Union to thwart the uprising of GRU colonel Volgin, rescue weapons researcher Nikolai Sokolov, destroy the Shagohod prototype, and kill The Boss to avert a nuclear war while having a rivalry with Ocelot and receiving assistance from fellow spy EVA. Snake completes his mission and kills The Boss, but learns that the defection was orchestrated by the US government and who had ordered his mentor&#x27;s death to prevent war. The political motives behind the operation do not sit well with him, especially after he is awarded the &quot;Big Boss&quot; title for his actions which he initially rejects, and prompts him to retire from active service.

In &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops&quot;, he is still under his former codename, believing that he has yet to surpass The Boss as a warrior. Having spent six years wandering the globe, Snake finds himself involved in an armed uprising caused by Gene&#x27;s rogue FOX unit in the San Hieronymo peninsula in Colombia and learns that he has been convicted for instigating the revolt. Hoping to clear his name, Snake forms his own team of specialists, FOXHOUND, by recruiting both old allies and defecting enemy soldiers to his cause. He faces not only the members of the FOX unit, but also Metal Gear&#x27;s first prototype. After he learns that The Boss&#x27;s death had been planned all along, Snake eventually defeats Gene and obtains the funds for Army&#x27;s Heaven.

&quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;, set years after &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, reveals that Big Boss and Zero were divided over how to realize The Boss&#x27;s final will: a world where soldiers are free to choose and fight their own battles on their own terms, and not at the whim of a government. Big Boss initially sided with Zero before being discouraged Zero interpreting the will as imposing order and control over the world. Big Boss further despises his role as a figurehead since Zero&#x27;s vision places no value on loyalty to ideals and people, which The Boss treasured above all else. Big Boss ultimately leaves when he learns that his own DNA was used for the &quot;Les Enfants Terribles&quot; project. He later stages the coup d&#x27;état with Outer Heaven and Zanzibar Land against Zero&#x27;s organization. Big Boss survived Zanzibar Land and was placed in an artificially induced coma with his genetic code used for an ID recognition system, the use of which allows access to the AIs that make up the Patriots. His body is recovered and reconstructed using parts from the bodies of both Liquid and Solidus, and he awakens from his coma after the fall of the Patriots&#x27; AIs. Big Boss appears before Old Snake with the elderly catatonic Zero to reveal the truth about the Patriots, before shutting off Zero&#x27;s life support system, killing the latter. He comes to terms with his feelings regarding The Boss, and reconciles with his son before dying from exposure to the new strain of FOXDIE virus.In &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot;, set after &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; and &quot;Portable Ops&quot;, Naked Snake establishes the mercenary force Militaires Sans Frontières with Kazuhira &quot;Kaz&quot; Miller. He intends to use MSF to live out The Boss&#x27;s final will. Student Paz Ortega Andrade and Professor Vladimir Zadornov seek to hire MSF to remove Coldman&#x27;s CIA Peace Sentinel unit that has established bases in Costa Rica. Snake reluctantly accepts the mission, to which the MSF takes over an offshore research platform in the Caribbean as a &quot;Mother Base&quot; in a bid to expand the group&#x27;s capabilities. Snake comes to learn about the true purpose of Coldman&#x27;s Peace Walker prototypes and accepts his Big Boss identity. Big Boss has Huey Emmerich create Metal Gear ZEKE as a weapon to defend his interests before Zadornov makes several escape attempts and is killed in self-defense while Paz takes control of ZEKE which Big Boss defeats and continues his operations with MSF. &quot;Ground Zeroes&quot;, set in 1975, sees Big Boss sent to rescue Paz and ally Chico from a U.S. Naval prison facility in Cuba, believing that Paz can be converted to MSF&#x27;s cause to reveal more about Cipher (a precursor to the Patriots). Snake rescues Paz and Chico but the XOF paramilitary force led by Skull Face attacks Mother Base. A bomb secretly planted in Paz results in injuries which puts Big Boss in a coma. &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot;, set in 1984, shows Big Boss awaken in Cyprus. Venom Snake acts as his doppelgänger/phantom for his operations while Big Boss works elsewhere on the true Outer Heaven&#x27;s development.

Venom Snake, also known as Punished Snake, is a body double of Big Boss seen in &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot;. During the events of &quot;Ground Zeroes&quot; while acting as a medic, he loses his left arm while his body has fragments of bones, teeth and a large piece of shrapnel lodged within his cerebral cortex. While in a coma for nine years, he is subjected to subconscious brainwashing and facial reconstruction as a mental doppelgänger who awakens in 1984 to draw attention away from Big Boss. Seeking revenge for his fallen comrades, Snake takes command of the mercenary unit Diamond Dogs with a new &quot;Mother Base&quot; near Seychelles. He engages in missions in Soviet-controlled Afghanistan and the Angola-Zaire border of Central Africa while recruiting several companions against Cipher&#x27;s remnants, before facing off against the game&#x27;s antagonist, Skull Face. Following the events of the game, he takes the place of Big Boss during the original encounter with Snake in Outer Heaven. Venom Snake dies in place of Big Boss, retconning him as the Big Boss featured in the first game in the series.

=== Other video games and media ===
Big Boss appears in &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot; as the leader of the enemy organization. Having survived the injuries he sustained in the original game as a cyborg, he fights Solid Snake as a boss. Naked Snake also appears as a playable character in &quot;Super Bomberman R&quot;. Big Boss was stated to be an inspiration for characters in the 2020 film &quot;Monster Hunter&quot;.

==Reception==
Big Boss has been well-received. Game publications described Big Boss as one of the best video game villains. Jesse Schedeen of &quot;IGN&quot; found the character one of the most important characters from the franchise to the point his &quot;influence is felt in every &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game, even if he isn&#x27;t always present in the flesh&quot;. Ken Gagne of &quot;Computerworld&quot; named Big Boss as one of the most creative villains in video games, citing the complexity and importance of his betrayal of Solid Snake in the original game. Naked Snake&#x27;s transition to Big Boss was praised, especially in conjunction with his character development throughout the series. Various gaming sites such as &quot;1UP.com&quot;, &quot;Game Informer&quot; and &quot;Kotaku&quot; placed his character as one of the worst fathers in video games due to his poor relationship with Solid Snake and the attempts to murder his own son. &quot;VG247&quot; wrote that while Big Boss appeared identical to Solid Snake, the former was more vulnerable and fallible, and driven by personal ideals. They also compared Big Boss&#x27; villainous turn and relationship with Solid Snake to the character of Darth Vader.

The inclusion of Naked Snake&#x27;s role in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; has also received praise from critics. Prior to the game&#x27;s release, Naked Snake was often called &#x27;Solid Snake&#x27; or simply &#x27;Snake&#x27; by critics due to his resemblance with Solid Snake, although some still were not sure about his true identity. Benjamin Turner of &quot;GameSpy&quot; further noted that various fans started making theories about Naked Snake&#x27;s identity before the game&#x27;s release, as while they thought it was Solid Snake, the setting from the game made it impossible for Solid Snake to be the game&#x27;s main protagonist due to their difference of years. Finding the revelation of Naked Snake&#x27;s identity was considered by Benjamin Turner of &quot;GameSpy&quot; as &quot;the single coolest thing Kojima could have done in &quot;MGS3&quot;&quot; because of [Naked Snake&#x27;s] differences from [Solid Snake] in regards to their personality as well as because it made fans wonder how Naked Snake would become the series antagonist Big Boss. Despite the similarities between Naked Snake and Solid Snake, Rich Stanton of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; praised how different they are from each other in terms of experience, particularly highlighting how Naked Snake looks after The Boss despite the game placing them as enemies. Dave Meikleham of &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; placed his relationship with EVA in his top list of disastrous game romances due to how it was ruined by the two&#x27;s different roles in the story. &quot;Play&quot; editor Nick Jones described Naked Snake&#x27;s final fight against The Boss as the second best moment from the franchise, citing the emotional focus on their characters, while the portrayal of the character in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; has been highlighted for making him a likeable and enjoyable character that made subsequent game appearances as a leader believable within the context of the world as a result.

Joe Dodson, writing for &quot;Game Revolution&quot;, disliked Big Boss&#x27;s character in &quot;Portable Ops&quot; due to his process of kidnapping and indoctrinating enemy soldiers through &quot;confusing rants&quot; about the idea of loyalty. Rob Fahey of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; found that Snake remained likeable due to carrying over traits shown in &quot;Snake Eater,&quot; and praised Hayter&#x27;s performance. Charles Herold of &quot;The New York Times&quot; described him as a tragic character based on the events shown in &quot;Snake Eater&quot;, and with &quot;Portable Ops&quot; had been forced to face a new conflict despite retirement. Greg Kasavin of &quot;GameSpot&quot; praised the handling of the character in &quot;Portable Ops&quot; due to his interactions with his former partners from the FOX unit. Jeff Haynes of &quot;IGN&quot; noted how the game presented major plot twists and exposition that would affect his characterization and lay the groundwork for important items shown later in the series.

Oli Welsh of &quot;Eurogamer&quot; criticized Big Boss&#x27;s characterization in &quot;Peace Walker&quot; as confusing in the wider context of the series, with mixed comments being given to Hayter&#x27;s performance. Jonathan Holmes of &quot;Destructoid&quot; enjoyed how &quot;Peace Walker&quot; further developed Big Boss&#x27;s character from &quot;Portable Ops&quot; by completing his journey from lone soldier to leader and cementing him as the series icon he would become. Greg Miller of &quot;IGN&quot; also found the game&#x27;s story was one of the most enjoyable and least-convoluted by focusing purely on Big Boss&#x27;s emotions and his quest to discover more about his fallen mentor, The Boss, similar sentiments of which were shared by Randy Nelson of &quot;Engadget&quot;.

Jason Schreier of &quot;Kotaku&quot; disliked the plot twist in &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot; which revealed that the player character Venom Snake was not Big Boss, feeling it cheapened the emotional crux of the story and failed to explain Big Boss&#x27;s motivations for becoming a villain. &quot;GamesRadar+&quot; writer David Roberts similarly cited that the reveal was a &quot;strange&quot; ending and &quot;a bizarre bit of fridge logic that makes less and less sense the more I think about it,&quot; believing it to make the ending of the game feel hollow. However, he felt that the customization aspect of Venom Snake was &quot;purely and distinctly &quot;Metal Gear&quot;&quot;. Conversely, &quot;Destructoid&quot; praised the reveal for its logic in the grander scheme of the series&#x27; timeline. Samuel Roberts of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; stated the twist left the player with &quot;no backstory other than the one [they]&#x27;ve just created&quot; which removed the character&#x27;s identity of Big Boss, reflecting the player&#x27;s own unique experience and being &quot;a perfect thematic match for [the] game&quot;. The repetitive nature of the quest system in &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot; was highlighted by &quot;VICE&quot; writer Cameron Kunzelman as helping to show Big Boss&#x27;s role as someone who simply does work rather than acting as a hero. Sutherland was praised for his performance, though the character of Venom Snake was criticized for his lack of dialogue.

<text>London Central Secondary School is a public secondary school located at the corner of Dufferin Avenue and Waterloo Street in downtown London, Ontario. It is a member of the Thames Valley District School Board. It has approximately 1000 students in full attendance, ranging from grades nine to twelve.

== History ==
Being the oldest school in the city, Central has a history that can be traced back to a Grammar School of 1826–1926 near the forks of the Thames River. When this Grammar School became too small, a Union School was erected. The Union School was renamed Central School in 1865; however, the school was razed in 1890 when other schools were able to accommodate Central students.

London Collegiate Institute was constructed on its present site in 1877; the school was destroyed by a fire in 1930.

In 1922, the new London Central Collegiate Institute was officially opened. It was enlarged in 1962 and again in 1968. Central celebrated its centennial in 1977. Construction of an addition including a new weight room, elevator and conference room was completed in August 1993. Further extensive renovations took place during 1995–1996 which fully modernized Central&#x27;s building, made it mostly wheelchair accessible, and incorporated a school-wide computer network for students.

From 1979 until 1999, London Central was the host to the Module scolaire de langue française (MSLF) – the first public French first language high school in London, Ont. Before the 1998–1999 school year, the MSLF became École secondaire Gabriel-Dumont and it moved into a new Le Centre Desloges (CDL) for the start of the 1999–2000 school year. Until the move the students in the MSLF had been fully integrated in life at Central, participating as Golden Ghosts in music, drama and sports. Students from the MSLF were often elected to Central students’ council, including student council president.

Central&#x27;s Reach for the Top team won nationally in two years, 2007 and 2009. The music program is nationally recognizable, with both wind, string, and jazz ensembles placing in the top three in provincial competitions. Additionally, the Senior Jazz Ensemble has earned Gold Standings at the National MusicFest on numerous occasions. The London Central Secondary school chess team was the highest performing in Ontario, winning every tournament they attended including the Ontario Provincials. London Central can also be noted for being the first secondary school in Ontario to run an official Paranormal Club.

== Programs ==

=== Music ===
About half of the student population is in the music program at Central. Opportunities for students include the Junior Band, Intermediate Band, Senior Band, Wind Ensemble, Junior Stage Band, Senior Jazz Band, Junior String Orchestra, Intermediate String Orchestra, Senior String Orchestra, Intermediate Symphony Orchestra, Senior Symphony Orchestra, Junior Chamber Orchestra, Senior Chamber Orchestra, Senior String Quartet, Chamber Choir, Concert Choir, Senior Brass Quartet, Intermediate Percussion Ensemble, and Alumni Band. The program has during the past five years won every single competition at the Kiwanis Music Festival at least once, placed in the top three in dozens of provincial competitions, and received Gold and silver medals at national festivals.

=== Athletics ===
London Central Secondary School has also had a rich athletic history, starting with football during the early years of the school. It was written in the &quot;London Free Press&quot; that during the city championship football game the Central players seemed to move through the defense like ghosts. This is where the term &quot;Central Golden Ghosts&quot; originated.

Since then there have been successes in basketball, soccer, football, and wrestling. In 1998, the Central senior boys&#x27; basketball team went undefeated, going on to win the city championship. London Central brought home the junior football AAA championship in 2004, 2006, 2010 and 2014. Central&#x27;s wrestling team has had great success since it was founded in 2009. The Ghosts won their first team title in 2012 when the girls won the WOSSAA Championship. The girls team repeated as WOSSAA Champions again in 2018 and 2019 when Central also won the Overall Team Championship. Central won the TVRA Geris Division Girls Championship and Overall Championships in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Nita Rrafshi won the Bill Salter Award for the Most Outstanding Wrestler at TVRA in 2017 and Jonelle Clarke was named the Most Outstanding Wrestler in 2019. Central&#x27;s track and field team placed first for the male team scores and second for the female team scores in the senior division at the track and field championship in 2018.

<doc id="1081592" wikidata="Q3586352" url="?curid=1081592" title="1991 New Brunswick general election">
<text>The 1991 New Brunswick general election was held on September 23, 1991, to elect 58 members to the 52nd New Brunswick Legislative Assembly, the governing house of the province of New Brunswick, Canada.

As expected, the Liberal Party won a large majority. Many were surprised that the Confederation of Regions Party formed the official opposition. Though they ran even with the PCs in popular vote, their concentration of support in rural anglophone ridings gave them considerably more seats. Weir&#x27;s personal popularity and name recognition was not enough to give her party more seats as she, and the Tories, had votes relatively evenly spread around the province.

==Background==
Though Frank McKenna&#x27;s Liberals were expected to win a second term after sweeping all 58 seats in 1987, any of the other three parties were considered contenders for official opposition.

The New Democratic Party was led by Elizabeth Weir, who had been the strongest and most consistent voice of opposition to the Liberals since her election as party leader in 1988. In the ensuing three years, thanks to the lack of opposition members in the legislature (MLAs), her firebrand style had made her a well-known name in New Brunswick politics.

The fledgling Confederation of Regions Party had been created out of the ashes of the Hatfield Tories when the latter went from majority government to zero seats in 1987. CoR was running numerous former Tory MLAs and candidates, and even some former Tory cabinet ministers. Its base of support was in English-speaking regions of New Brunswick, where many conservatives had become alienated by Hatfield&#x27;s close relationship with Acadians.

The Progressive Conservatives had been in power for the majority of years since confederation, and 17 straight years before 1987. Even so, the scandals of the final Hatfield years and the growing unpopularity of the federal Progressive Conservatives hindered their success. Additionally they had perceived internal problems having gone through four leaders since the last election: Hatfield, then two-year interim leader Malcolm MacLeod then Barbara Baird, and then Dennis Cochrane.

==Opinion polls==
==Close results==
A number of races were close 2 or 3 way contests with only a small fraction of votes separating the winner from the losers. The tables below highlight the seats that the three major parties missed by less than 10 percentage points (pp) and the margins between them and the winner.

<text>The 1947 Jerusalem Riots occurred following the vote in the UN General Assembly in favour of the 1947 UN Partition Plan on 29 November 1947. 8 Jews were reported killed. 

The Arab Higher Committee declared a three-day strike and public protest to begin on 2 December 1947, in protest at the vote. Arabs marching to Zion Square on December 2 were stopped by the British, and the Arabs instead turned towards the commercial center of the City at Mamilla and Jaffa Road, burning many buildings and shops. Violence continued for two more days, with a number of Jewish neighborhoods being attacked.

The New York Times, December 3, 1947, has a three column headline on the front page: &quot;JERUSALEM TORN BY RIOTING; ARABS USE KNIVES, SET FIRES; JEWS REPLY, HAGANAH IN OPEN&quot; with subheads that include: &quot;14 Are Slain In Day&quot; &quot;8 Jews Reported Killed in Palestine Clashes – Mob Loots Shops&quot; etc.

A consequence of the violence was the decision by the Haganah Jewish paramilitary organization to use force to &quot;stop future attacks on Jews&quot;. The Irgun had conducted armed attacks aimed against population of nearby Arab villages and a bombing campaign against Arab civilians. On December 12, Irgun militants placed a bomb at the Damascus Gate that killed 20 people.

<text>Campbelltown railway station is a heritage-listed railway station located on the Main Southern line, serving the Sydney suburb of Campbelltown. It is served by Sydney Trains&#x27; T8 Airport &amp; South line services and NSW TrainLink services to Moss Vale, Goulburn, Canberra, Griffith and Melbourne.

==History==

Campbelltown Railway Station was briefly the southernmost extent of Great Southern Railway of New South Wales being situated at the end of the Liverpool to Campbelltown railway extension completed in 1858.

The station opened on 4 May 1858 with services commencing 17 May 1858. Preparations for the opening of the railway station commenced after a 3pm meeting at the Court House on 12 March 1858. In the meantime, the railway was progressing towards completion with the Chief Commissioner, Chief Engineer, and railway officials having inspected the progress of station construction on 29 April 1858.

The opening included an afternoon banquet, &quot;with every delicacy upon the table which the colony can produce will be held in the goods station (which has been placed at the disposal of the committee by the Commission).&quot;, an evening ball, &quot;upon a scale which would do credit to a much larger town than we can boast of&quot;, a band placed on an elevated platform, and separate male and female areas with each area to be waited upon by a man-servant and female respectively.

The revised Great Southern Railway timetable for the opening of the railway listed seven down, and seven up, services; five passenger services, and two mixed services. The journey time from Sydney was 1 hour 45 minutes with 8 stops for a 34-mile journey length. Services from Campbelltown commenced at 6am and finished at 5:30pm. However, soon after opening, the travel time had become 2 hours with services commencing at 6:50am and finishing at 5:45pm and the loss of a goods/mixed service.

Between 1882 and 1963, it was the junction station for the Campbelltown-Camden line.

On 5 May 1968, the Main South line was electrified from Liverpool. It was the extremity of the Sydney suburban network until extended to Macarthur opened in July 1985. However many services still terminate at Campbelltown.

In June 1999, an upgrade to the station including lifts was complete.

In January 2013, the Southern Sydney Freight Line opened on the western side of the station. The station is surrounded by an extensive network of sidings to stable terminating Sydney Trains rolling stock.

Since the second half of 2017, Campbelltown railway station has been served exclusively by the Airport and East Hills line, meaning commuters have to change at Glenfield to travel to either the city via Granville or to Blacktown via the Cumberland Line.

==Platforms and services==

To the west of the station is Campbelltown Yard, a large rail yard where trains are parked overnight and during the off-peak. The Southern Sydney Freight Line (leased to Australian Rail Track Corporation) also runs through Campbelltown Station. It has no platforms (as it is a freight line) and passes to the west of Campbelltown Yard. There are also a number of sidings and refuges around Campbelltown. Some of these sidings, such as the perway siding and the goods siding (the two dead ends north of the station), are unelectrified, and rarely used. There are no signals permitting a movement into the perway siding (the northern one), so the catch points must be manually closed after receiving permission from the signaller. The other siding is connected to platform 4, a dock platform used by terminating Southern Highlands line trains. All platforms at Campbelltown are long enough for 8 car suburban trains, with the exception of platform 4, which is around 100m long, enough to fit 4 Endeavour cars.

<doc id="1081600" wikidata="Q540509" url="?curid=1081600" title="Siren Song of the Counter Culture">
<text>Siren Song of the Counter Culture is the third studio album by American punk rock band Rise Against. Released on August 10, 2004, it was Rise Against&#x27;s first album on a major record label, after the band signed with DreamWorks Records in September 2003. The recording sessions for the album with producer Garth Richardson were mostly split between two studios in British Columbia. These sessions were marred by numerous distractions and inconveniences, such as the absorption of DreamWorks into Geffen Records, the arrival of a new guitarist, accusations of the band selling out, and the birth of lead vocalist Tim McIlrath&#x27;s child.

Musically, &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; is rooted in hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. It comprises twelve songs, with lyrical themes ranging from social commentary to personal reflection. To promote the album, Rise Against toured throughout North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan. &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; sold poorly for the first six months, but the band&#x27;s incessant touring schedule eventually led to a gradual increase in sales. It became their first album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, where it peaked at number 136, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.

The album received generally positive reviews, with praise for the lyrics, but drew some criticism for a lack of individually memorable songs and perceived overproduction. Three songs from &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; were released as singles: &quot;Give It All&quot;, &quot;Swing Life Away&quot;, and &quot;Life Less Frightening&quot;. All three songs charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart. &quot;Give It All&quot; and &quot;Swing Life Away&quot; in particular are credited with helping Rise Against achieve mainstream appeal.

==Background and recording==
After the release of &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; in 2003, a number of major record labels became interested in Rise Against, including DreamWorks Records. At the time, Rise Against was under contract with the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords. The general consensus among Fat Wreck Chords musicians was that major record labels sacrifice musical integrity in exchange for commercial profit. Rise Against held the same belief, but eventually came to the conclusion that, unlike other labels, DreamWorks supported the band&#x27;s social and political charged lyrics. According to lead vocalist Tim McIlrath: &quot;Their faith in what we do and the fact that they cared about stuff we cared about was an eye-opener.&quot; The band signed with DreamWorks in September 2003, and was given complete creative control to record &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot;.

The band members went into the album with the assumption that DreamWorks was going to drop them at any moment, so they wanted to take advantage of the opportunity by working with their &quot;dream producer&quot;. They chose Garth Richardson, known for his work with heavier sounding bands like Rage Against the Machine and Sick of It All, to produce the album. The recording sessions for &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; were split between Plumper Mountain Sound in Gibsons, British Columbia, and The Warehouse Studio in Vancouver, British Columbia. Richardson insisted on recording the guitar and bass one measure at a time, to ensure perfect timing; as a result, each song took nearly twelve hours to record. Canadian politician Nicholas Simons contributed the cello to four songs. Simons met the band while in Gibsons, and recalled not knowing who they were.

The writing and recording sessions for &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; were marred by numerous distractions and inconveniences. In November 2003, DreamWorks was acquired by Universal Music Group for US$100 million, and eventually folded into Geffen Records. The transition period between labels left Rise Against without an A&amp;R representative, and little acknowledgement from Geffen executives. Guitarist Todd Mohney left the band during the writing sessions, was replaced by Chris Chasse of Reach the Sky. McIlrath noted that the band members was nervous about teaching Chasse completely new songs in a short period. Meanwhile, McIlrath was experiencing more personal distractions. Some Rise Against fans accused the band of selling out after signing with DreamWorks. Although McIlrath felt that most of the fans would realize that the band had not changed upon hearing the album, it still bothered him knowing that some longtime fans now hated the band for switching labels. Additionally, McIlrath&#x27;s wife, who was seven months pregnant, went into labor while he was in the vocal booth. The band temporarily moved recording sessions from Vancouver to Chicago so that McIlrath could be with his wife.

==Composition==

&quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; is primarily rooted in hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. According to Ultimate Guitar Archive, the album contains archetypal elements of punk rock, including &quot;fast-paced drum beats, powerful guitar chords and thrashing bass lines&quot;. Each song has multiple guitar layers combined with rhythmic arrangements, which add &quot;melodic flavor&quot;. Critics have compared the album to works by other punk rock bands, like AFI, Bad Religion, Blink-182, Poison the Well, Refused, and Sick of It All. AllMusic&#x27;s Johnny Loftus commented that the band diversified their lyrics for &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot;, mixing social and political commentary with personal reflection. McIlrath believes that the album is about standing up for oneself, and not being afraid to have a dissenting opinion.

The first track on &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; is &quot;State of the Union&quot;, a short and aggressive song that contains the most screaming on the album. Its lyrics criticize bureaucratic injustice, as well as those who do not speak out against injustice. Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic believes &quot;The First Drop&quot; is more toned down, and acts as a bridge to the third track &quot;Life Less Frightening&quot;. &quot;Life Less Frightening&quot; is a conventionally structured song, that Boy notes almost has an alternative rock sound, but keeps underlying punk rock traits. The fourth track, &quot;Paper Wings&quot;, tells a sad story about growing apart, backed by a guitar lick that lasts the entire song. &quot;Blood to Bleed&quot; features reflective lyrics about broken hearts, presented from a first-person perspective.

The sixth and seventh tracks, &quot;To Them These Streets Belong&quot; and &quot;Tip the Scales&quot;, have AFI-like vocals according to &quot;Blistering&quot; Justin Donnelly. &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; features a backing drum beat that both Donnelly and Ultimate Guitar Archive highlighted as the best part of the song, with Ultimate Guitar Archive describing it as &quot;contagious&quot;. &quot;Give It All&quot; is a short hardcore track, that Boy believes is reminiscent of songs by The Offspring. McIlrath commented that the song is &quot;kind of a punk rock anthem about being a punk rocker in today&#x27;s world; like what being a human being in today&#x27;s world is like&quot;. &quot;Dancing for Rain&quot; opens with acoustic strumming, before transitioning into a frenetic pace, combining pop elements with punk rock. The penultimate track, &quot;Swing Life Away&quot;, is an acoustic ballad, with simple lyrics discussing daily life and the working class. The final track, &quot;Rumors of My Demise Have Been Greatly Exaggerated&quot; features one of the few guitar solos on the album, and &quot;end[s] things in huge style&quot;, according to Donnelly.

==Release and commercial performance==
To promote &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot;, Rise Against toured extensively throughout North America, Europe, Australia, and Japan. They participated in the 2004 Warped Tour, and supported Bad Religion in a late 2004 tour. In 2005, Rise Against participated in the Taste of Chaos tour (with Funeral for a Friend, Killswitch Engage, Story of the Year, and The Used), Give it a Name festival (with Alexisonfire, Coheed and Cambria, Fightstar, and MewithoutYou), and the Reading and Leeds Festivals in the UK. McIlrath commented that the band was &quot;touring like maniacs at the time&quot;, accepting every show they could get into.

&quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; was released on August 10, 2004; the first 30,000 copies contained a &quot;question authority&quot; sticker. For the first six months, the album sold poorly, and attracted little fanfare. Geffen did not promote the band, as they were virtually unaware of their existence. This led Aubin Paul of Punknews.org to jokingly comment that Fat Wreck Chords was doing more to promote the band. Rise Against&#x27;s incessant touring schedule resulted in greater exposure, which contributed to a gradual increase in sales. Eventually, Geffen noticed the increase in sales, and began promoting the band.

&quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; became Rise Against&#x27;s first album to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 136 on August 28, 2004. It also reached number one on the Top Heatseekers chart. According to &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, the album sold over 400,000 copies by 2006. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in 2009, denoting shipments of 500,000 copies in the United States. Elsewhere, the album was certified platinum by Music Canada, denoting shipments of 100,000 copies in Canada; and gold by the Australian Recording Industry Association, denoting shipments of 35,000 copies in Australia.

Three songs from &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; were released as singles: &quot;Give It All&quot;, &quot;Swing Life Away&quot;, and &quot;Life Less Frightening&quot;. All three songs charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, peaking at number thirty-seven, twelve, and thirty-three respectively. Accompanying music videos were shot for &quot;Give It All&quot; and &quot;Swing Life Away&quot;. In the &quot;Give It All&quot; video, Rise Against performs in a crowded subway car, while other people travel throughout Chicago vandalizing and defacing billboards and posters. The &quot;Swing Life Away&quot; video is more relaxed, and follows the band members as they hangout with friends. The video for &quot;Swing Life Away&quot; was shot over a year after the release of &quot;Siren Song Of The Counter Culture&quot;, a rarity in the music industry, as most videos are shot only a few months after the song&#x27;s parent album is released. Music journalists have credited &quot;Give It All&quot; and &quot;Swing Life Away&quot; as helping Rise Against achieve mainstream appeal. John J. Moser of &quot;The Morning Call&quot; considers &quot;Give It All&quot; to be the band&#x27;s breakthrough single, while &quot;Alternative Addiction&quot; wrote: &quot;&#x27;Swing Life Away&#x27; catapulted Rise Against past Anti-Flag to the point where they&#x27;ve been with the past three albums as one of most established bands going in rock.&quot;

==Critical reception==
&quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; received mostly positive reviews from critics. Ultimate Guitar Archive lauded almost every aspect of the album, with particular praise for the use of multiple guitar layers, its &quot;poetically angry lyrics&quot;, and McIlrath&#x27;s vocals. However, the review also mentioned that Rise Against fans may be disappointed with the band&#x27;s move towards a more accessible sound. Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic described &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; as an &quot;impressively energetic and surprisingly accessible package of punk, hardcore and rock all rolled into one&quot;, and praised the simple yet effective lyrics. Writing for &quot;The Herald-News&quot;, Chris Brooks highlighted Brandon Barnes&#x27; drumming, and recommend the album to drum fans. Alex Parker of Contactmusic.com complimented the lyrics for their relevancy, and noted their subtlety when compared to Green Day&#x27;s 2004 album &quot;American Idiot&quot;.

Boy found the paucity of individually memorable songs to be &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; biggest issue, and noted the album&#x27;s lack of immediacy. Donnelly and Loftus felt that some of the album&#x27;s songs suffered from overproduction, which lessened their lyrical potency and musical aggression. Loftus ultimately summarized his review by saying &quot;&quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; is simply the band&#x27;s latest statement ... to recruit more kids for the raging&quot;. Marc Hogan&#x27;s review for &quot;Pitchfork&quot; is written as if it were a letter addressed to American political activist Ralph Nader. In his review, Hogan heavily chastises the band for their &quot;empty political sloganeering and crybaby bullshit&quot;, and compares the album&#x27;s &quot;over-the-top bloviating&quot; to Nader&#x27;s 2004 presidential campaign.

<text>The Colt Mk 12 is a 20 mm autocannon that was widely used by the United States Navy after World War II.

==Development==
The Mk 12 was an advanced derivative of the wartime Hispano HS 404 that was used on French, British and some American fighter aircraft during World War II. It used a lighter projectile with a bigger charge for better muzzle velocity and higher rate of fire at the cost of hitting power. It entered U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps service in the mid-1950s, replacing the earlier M3 cannon.

In service, the Mk 12 proved less than satisfactory. Although its muzzle velocity and rate of fire were acceptable, it was inaccurate and frequently unreliable. Pilots of the F-8 Crusader over North Vietnam, in particular, appreciated the presence of the cannon, but jams and stoppages were common, especially following hard dogfighting maneuvers in high-g environments.

Nevertheless, the Mk 12 was standard cannon armament on gun-armed American naval fighters and attack aircraft from the early 1950s to the early 1970s, including the F4D Skyray, F3H Demon, A-4 Skyhawk, F-8 Crusader, F-11 Tiger and early navy versions of the LTV A-7 Corsair II.

International customers of the A-4 Skyhawk, F-8 Crusader, and the A-7 Corsair II also used the Mk 12 cannon: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, France, Kuwait, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines and Portugal. The only exceptions were Israel and Singapore. The Israeli Air Force replaced the Mk 12 cannon with the French 30 mm DEFA cannon (a revolver design) in its Skyhawks, while the Republic of Singapore Air Force fitted the British 30 mm ADEN cannon (another revolver). Indonesia later bought some used A-4s from Israel.

As of 2013, the Mk 12 cannon is still in use in Skyhawks of the Argentine Air Force and the Brazilian Navy.

<text>A traction motor is an electric motor used for propulsion of a vehicle, such as locomotives, electric or hydrogen vehicles, or electric multiple unit trains.

Traction motors are used in electrically powered railway vehicles (electric multiple units) and other electric vehicles including electric milk floats, trolleybuses, elevators, roller coasters, and conveyor systems, as well as vehicles with electrical transmission systems (diesel–electric locomotives, electric hybrid vehicles), and battery electric vehicles.
== Traction motor companies ==
The word &quot;traction&quot; from Latin, being the agent noun of &quot;trahere&quot; &quot;to pull&quot; in the sense of &quot;drawn&quot;
was used for the naming of traction engines developed circa 1870. 

The first experimental electric traction motor tramway of 1875 was rapidly developed internationally for city use. 
In the 19th century traction motor passenger car companies began to compete with the dominant citywide horse-drawn railway transportation system.

==Motor types and control==
Direct-current motors with series field windings are the oldest type of traction motors. These provide a speed-torque characteristic useful for propulsion, providing high torque at lower speeds for the acceleration of the vehicle, and declining torque as speed increases. By arranging the field winding with multiple taps, the speed characteristic can be varied, allowing relatively smooth operator control of acceleration. A further measure of control is provided by using pairs of motors on a vehicle in series-parallel control; for slow operation or heavy loads, two motors can be run in a series of the direct-current supply. Where higher speed is desired, these motors can be operated in parallel, making a higher voltage available at each motor and so allowing higher speeds. Parts of a rail system might use different voltages, with higher voltages in long runs between stations and lower voltages near stations where only slower operation is needed.

A variant of the DC system is the AC series motor, also known as the universal motor, which is essentially the same device but operates on alternating current. Since both the armature and field current reverse at the same time, the behavior of the motor is similar to that when energized with direct current. To achieve better operating conditions, AC railways are often supplied with current at a lower frequency than the commercial supply used for general lighting and power; special traction current power stations are used, or rotary converters used to convert 50 or 60 Hz commercial power to the 25 Hz or  Hz frequency used for AC traction motors. Because it permits the simple use of transformers, the AC system allows efficient distribution of power down the length of a rail line, and also permits speed control with switchgear on the vehicle.

AC induction motors and synchronous motors are simple and low maintenance, but up until the advent of power semiconductors, were awkward to apply for traction motors because of their fixed speed characteristic. An AC induction motor generates useful amounts of power only over a narrow speed range determined by its construction and the frequency of the AC power supply. The advent of power semiconductors has made it possible to fit a variable frequency drive on a locomotive; this allows a wide range of speeds, AC power transmission, and the use of rugged induction motors that do not have wearing parts like brushes and commutators.

==Transportation applications==

===Road vehicles===

Traditionally road vehicles (cars, buses, and trucks) have used diesel and petrol engines with a mechanical or hydraulic transmission system. In the latter part of the 20th century, vehicles with electrical transmission systems (powered by internal combustion engines, batteries, or fuel cells) began to be developed—one advantage of using electric machines is that specific types can regenerate energy (i.e. act as a regenerative brake)—providing deceleration as well as increasing overall efficiency by charging the battery pack.

===Railways===

Traditionally, these were series-wound brushed DC motors, usually running on approximately 600 volts. The availability of high-powered semiconductors (thyristors and the IGBT) has now made practical the use of much simpler, higher-reliability AC induction motors known as asynchronous traction motors. Synchronous AC motors are also occasionally used, as in the French TGV.

====Mounting of motors====
Before the mid-20th century, a single large motor was often used to drive multiple driving wheels through connecting rods that were very similar to those used on steam locomotives. Examples are the Pennsylvania Railroad DD1, FF1 and L5 and the various Swiss Crocodiles. It is now standard practice to provide one traction motor driving each axle through a gear drive.
Usually, the traction motor is three-point suspended between the bogie frame and the driven axle; this is referred to as a &quot;nose-suspended traction motor&quot;. The problem with such an arrangement is that a portion of the motor&#x27;s weight is unsprung, increasing unwanted forces on the track. In the case of the famous Pennsylvania Railroad GG1, two frame-mounted motors drove each axle through a quill drive. The &quot;Bi-Polar&quot; electric locomotives built by General Electric for the Milwaukee Road had direct drive motors. The rotating shaft of the motor was also the axle for the wheels. In the case of French TGV power cars, a motor mounted to the power car&#x27;s frame drives each axle; a &quot;tripod&quot; drive allows a small amount of flexibility in the drive train allowing the trucks bogies to pivot. By mounting the relatively heavy traction motor directly to the power car&#x27;s frame, rather than to the bogie, better dynamics are obtained, allowing better high-speed operation.

====Windings====

The DC motor was the mainstay of electric traction drives on electric and diesel-electric locomotives, street-cars/trams and diesel electric drilling rigs for many years. It consists of two parts, a rotating armature and fixed field windings surrounding the rotating armature mounted around a shaft. The fixed field windings consist of tightly wound coils of wire fitted inside the motor case. The armature is another set of coils wound round a central shaft and is connected to the field windings through &quot;brushes&quot; which are spring-loaded contacts pressing against an extension of the armature called the commutator. The commutator collects all the terminations of the armature coils and distributes them in a circular pattern to allow the correct sequence of current flow. When the armature and the field windings are connected in series, the whole motor is referred to as &quot;series-wound&quot;. A series-wound DC motor has a low resistance field and armature circuit. For this reason, when voltage is applied to it, the current is high due to Ohm&#x27;s law. The advantage of high current is that the magnetic fields inside the motor are strong, producing high torque (turning force), so it is ideal for starting a train. The disadvantage is that the current flowing into the motor has to be limited, otherwise the supply could be overloaded or the motor and its cabling could be damaged. At best, the torque would exceed the adhesion and the driving wheels would slip. Traditionally, resistors were used to limit the initial current.

====Power control====
As the DC motor starts to turn, interaction of the magnetic fields inside causes it to generate a voltage internally. This counter-electromotive force (CEMF) opposes the applied voltage and the current that flows is governed by the difference between the two. As the motor speeds up, the internally generated voltage rises, the resultant EMF falls, less current passes through the motor and the torque drops. The motor naturally stops accelerating when the drag of the train matches the torque produced by the motors. To continue accelerating the train, series resistors are switched out step by step, each step increasing the effective voltage and thus the current and torque for a little bit longer until the motor catches up. This can be heard and felt in older DC trains as a series of clunks under the floor, each accompanied by a jerk of acceleration as the torque suddenly increases in response to the new surge of current. When no resistors are left in the circuit, full line voltage is being applied directly to the motor. The train&#x27;s speed remains constant at the point where the torque of the motor, governed by the effective voltage, equals the drag - sometimes referred to as balancing speed. If the train starts to climb an incline, the speed decreases because drag is greater than torque and the reduction in speed causes the CEMF to fall and thus the effective voltage to rise - until the current through the motor produces enough torque to match the new drag. The use of series resistance was wasteful because a lot of energy was lost as heat. To reduce these losses, electric locomotives and trains (before the advent of power electronics) were normally equipped for series-parallel control as well.

Locomotives that operated from AC power sources (using universal motors as traction motors) could also take advantage of tap changers on their transformers to vary the voltage applied to the traction motors without the losses inherent in resistors. The Pennsylvania Railroad class GG1 was an example of such a locomotive.

====Dynamic braking====
If the train starts to descend a grade, the speed increases because the (reduced) drag is less than the torque. With increased speed, the internally generated back-EMF voltage rises, reducing the torque until the torque again balances the drag. Because the field current is reduced by the back-EMF in a series wound motor, there is no speed at which the back-EMF will exceed the supply voltage, and therefore a single series wound DC traction motor alone cannot provide dynamic or regenerative braking.

There are, however various schemes applied to provide a retarding force using the traction motors. The energy generated may be returned to the supply (regenerative braking), or dissipated by on board resistors (dynamic braking). Such a system can bring the load to a low speed, requiring relatively little friction braking to bring the load to a full stop.

====Automatic acceleration====
On an electric train, the train driver or motorman originally had to control the cutting out of resistance manually, but by 1914, automatic acceleration was being used. This was achieved by an accelerating relay (often called a &quot;notching relay&quot;) in the motor circuit which monitored the fall of current as each step of resistance was cut out. All the driver had to do was select low, medium or full speed (called &quot;series&quot;, &quot;parallel&quot; and &quot;shunt&quot; from the way the motors were connected in the resistance circuit) and the automatic equipment would do the rest.
==Rating==
Electric locomotives usually have a &quot;continuous&quot; and &quot;one-hour&quot; rating. The one-hour rating is the maximum power that the motors can continuously develop over one hour without overheating. Such a test starts with the motors at +25 °C (and the outside air used for ventilation also at +25 °C). In the USSR, per GOST 2582-72 with class N insulation, the maximum temperatures allowed for DC motors were 160 °C for the armature, 180 °C for the stator, and 105 °C for the collector. The one-hour rating is typically about 10% higher than the continuous rating and is limited by the temperature rise in the motor.

As traction motors use a reduction gear setup to transfer torque from the motor armature to the driven axle, the actual load placed on the motor varies with the gear ratio. Otherwise &quot;identical&quot; traction motors can have significantly different load rating. A traction motor geared for freight use with a low gear ratio will safely produce higher torque at the wheels for a longer period at the same current level because the lower gears give the motor more mechanical advantage.

In diesel-electric and gas turbine-electric locomotives, the horsepower rating of the traction motors is usually around 81% that of the prime mover. This assumes that the electrical generator converts 90% of the engine&#x27;s output into electrical energy and the traction motors convert 90% of this electrical energy back into mechanical energy. Calculation: 0.9 × 0.9 = 0.81

Individual traction motor ratings usually range up .

Another important factor when traction motors are designed or specified is operational speed. The motor armature has a maximum safe rotating speed at or below which the windings will stay safely in place.

Above this maximum speed centrifugal force on the armature will cause the windings to be thrown outward. In severe cases, this can lead to &quot;birdnesting&quot; as the windings contact the motor housing and eventually break loose from the armature entirely and uncoil.

Bird-nesting (the centrifugal ejection of the armature&#x27;s windings) due to overspeed can occur either in operating traction motors of powered locomotives or in traction motors of dead-in-consist locomotives being transported within a train traveling too fast. Another cause is replacement of worn or damaged traction motors with units incorrectly geared for the application.

Damage from overloading and overheating can also cause bird-nesting below rated speeds when the armature assembly and winding supports and retainers have been damaged by the previous abuse.

==Cooling==
Because of the high power levels involved, traction motors are almost always cooled using forced air, water or a special dielectric liquid.

Typical cooling systems on U.S. diesel-electric locomotives consist of an electrically powered fan blowing air into a passage integrated into the locomotive frame. Rubber cooling ducts connect the passage to the individual traction motors and cooling air travels down and across the armatures before being exhausted to the atmosphere.

<doc id="1081620" wikidata="Q5537623" url="?curid=1081620" title="George Callaghan">
<text>Admiral of the Fleet Sir George Astley Callaghan (21 December 1852 – 23 November 1920) was an officer in the Royal Navy. During the Boxer Rebellion he served as commander of a naval brigade sent ashore to form an element of a larger expedition under Lieutenant-General Sir Alfred Gaselee: the expedition entered Peking and rescued the legations which had been held hostage there. He came to prominence again when, as Second-in-Command of the Mediterranean Fleet, he assisted with the provision of aid to survivors of the Messina earthquake, which had caused the loss of circa 123,000 lives.

Callaghan became Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet in November 1911 and was advised in December 1913 that his tenure would be extended for another twelve months. With increasing international tension he started preparing his fleet for war. At the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914, Callaghan set sail in his flagship for his war station at Scapa Flow. There he met his successor-designate Sir John Jellicoe who had received orders from First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill to relieve the ageing Callaghan of command of his fleet. Callaghan was bitterly disappointed not to command his fleet in the war he had completely readied it for. He went on to be Commander-in-Chief, The Nore.

==Naval career==
===Early career===
Born the grandson of Daniel Callaghan MP, and the son of Captain Frederic Marcus Callaghan (an Irish landowner) and Georgina Frances Callaghan (née Hodgson), Callaghan joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in the training ship in January 1866. Promoted to midshipman on 15 October 1867, he joined the screw frigate at Liverpool later that month. He then transferred to the corvette on the East Indies Station in October 1870. Promoted to sub-lieutenant on 15 April 1872 and to lieutenant on 15 April 1875, he joined the corvette on the East Indies Station in June 1877. In this post he was awarded a commendation by the Admiralty for saving the lives of sailors after a boat capsized in the Irrawaddy River.

He attended the gunnery school in 1880 and then joined the staff there in 1882. He returned to HMS &quot;Ruby&quot; on the South East Coast of America Station in 1885 and, having been promoted to commander on 31 December 1887, he became executive officer in the battleship , flagship of the North America and West Indies Station in 1888. He went on to be commanding officer of the despatch vessel , yacht of the Commander-in-Chief, China Station in 1892. Promoted to captain on 1 January 1894, he became naval advisor to the Inspector-General of Fortifications at the War Office later that year. He went on to be commanding officer of the cruiser in the Channel Fleet in 1897 and commanding officer of the cruiser on the China Station in 1899.

===Boxer rebellion===
In April 1900, Callaghan became commander of a naval brigade sent ashore to form an element of a larger expedition under Lieutenant-General Sir Alfred Gaselee as part of the British response to the Boxer Rebellion. The expedition entered Peking and successfully rescued the legations which had been held hostage there. Callaghan was mentioned in dispatches and appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath on 9 November 1900.

===Higher rank===

Callaghan became commanding officer of the cruiser and commanded her in manoeuvres in Summer 1901 before becoming commanding officer of the battleship on the Mediterranean Station in December 1901. He went on to be Captain of Portsmouth Dockyard early in 1904 and commanding officer of the battleship on the Mediterranean Station shortly thereafter. He was appointed naval aide-de-camp to the King on 25 April 1904. Promoted to rear-admiral on 1 July 1905, he became Second-in-Command, Channel Fleet, with his flag in the battleship , in 1906 and commander of the 5th Cruiser Squadron, with his flag in the armoured cruiser , in 1907. Appointed a Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 3 August 1907, he went on to be Second-in-Command of the Mediterranean Fleet with his flag in the battleship in 1908. In the latter role he assisted with the provision of aid to survivors of the Messina earthquake, which had caused the loss of circa 123,000 lives, in December 1908 for which he was advanced to Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order on 30 April 1909 and appointed a Grand Officer of the Order of the Crown of Italy on 15 April 1912. Promoted to vice-admiral on 27 April 1910, he became Second-in-Command of the Home Fleet, with his flag in the battleship later that month. He was advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 24 June 1910.

Callaghan became Commander-in-Chief of the Home Fleet, with his flag in the battleship and with the acting rank of admiral in November 1911. Following an inspection of his fleet by King George V he was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order on 11 May 1912 and, after a separate visit by the President Raymond Poincaré of France in 1913, he was also awarded the Grand Cordon of the French Legion of Honour. He was promoted to the substantive rank of full admiral on 17 May 1913 and was advised in December 1913 that his tenure would be extended for another twelve months. With increasing international tension he started preparing his fleet for war.

===The First World War===

At the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914, Callaghan set sail in his flagship, the battleship , for his war station at Scapa Flow. There he met his successor-designate Sir John Jellicoe, who had received orders from First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill to relieve the ageing Callaghan of command of his fleet. Jellicoe had resisted the order, believing it would cause tension in the fleet, but the order was confirmed by the Admiralty and Jellicoe was instructed to carry it out. Callaghan was bitterly disappointed not to command his fleet in the war he had completely readied it for.

In Autumn 1914 Callaghan took part in a Court of Inquiry into the conduct of Rear Admiral Ernest Troubridge for his failure to pursue the battlecruiser and the light cruiser . He referred the matter to a court-martial which ultimately found the case against Troubridge not proven.

Callaghan was appointed First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp to the King on 11 September 1914 and became Commander-in-Chief, The Nore in January 1915. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath on 3 June 1916 and was promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 2 April 1917.

Callahan retired in March 1918 and became King of Arms of the Order of the Bath in May 1919. He died at 11 Cadogan Court, Chelsea, London on 23 November 1920 and was given a funeral at Westminster Abbey, following which he was buried in the churchyard of St Mary the Virgin at Bathwick, Somerset.

==Family==
In 1876, Callaghan married Edith Saumarez; they had one son and three daughters.

<text>Rise Against is an American punk rock band from Chicago, formed in 1999. The group&#x27;s current line-up comprises vocalist/rhythm guitarist Tim McIlrath, lead guitarist Zach Blair, bassist Joe Principe and drummer Brandon Barnes. Rooted in hardcore punk and melodic hardcore, Rise Against&#x27;s music emphasizes melody, catchy hooks, an aggressive sound and playstyle, and rapid tempos. Lyrically, the band is known for their outspoken social commentary, covering a wide range of topics such as political injustice, animal rights, humanitarianism, and environmentalism.

The band spent its first four years signed to the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords, on which they released two studio albums, &quot;The Unraveling&quot; (2001) and &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; (2003). Both the albums were met with underground success, and in 2003 the band signed with the major label Dreamworks, which was absorbed by Geffen. Rise Against&#x27;s major label debut &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; (2004) brought the band mainstream success, largely in part to the popularity of the singles &quot;Give It All&quot; and &quot;Swing Life Away&quot;. The band&#x27;s next album, &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot; (2006), peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the United States, and was Rise Against&#x27;s first album to chart in countries outside of North America.

With the release of &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; (2008), Rise Against&#x27;s music shifted toward a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. The album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Savior&quot;, broke the record for the most consecutive weeks spent on both the Hot Rock Songs and Alternative Songs charts. Rise Against&#x27;s popularity grew with the release of &quot;Endgame&quot; (2011), which peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and charted highly worldwide. The band&#x27;s seventh and eighth albums, &quot;The Black Market&quot; (2014) and &quot;Wolves&quot; (2017) continued the trend of commercial success, and both peaked with the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Their ninth and most recent album, &quot;Nowhere Generation&quot;, was released in 2021.

Rise Against is also known for their advocacy of progressivism, supporting organizations such as Amnesty International and the It Gets Better Project. The band actively promotes animal rights and most of the members are straight edge, PETA supporters and vegetarians.

==History==

===Early years (1999-2003)===

Rise Against was formed in 1999, by bassist Joe Principe and guitarist Dan Wleklinski. Before Rise Against, Principe and Wleklinski were members of the Chicago punk rock band 88 Fingers Louie. This band toured and recorded to moderate success, but disbanded on two separate occasions in the late 1990s. Following the second breakup, Principe and Wleklinski decided to form a new band called Transistor Revolt, and recruited drummer Tony Tintari, guitarist Kevin White, and lead vocalist Tim McIlrath. Principe met McIlrath in Indianapolis while attending a Sick of It All concert, and recalled seeing him perform with his previous band Baxter. Impressed with McIlrath&#x27;s gritty vocals, Principe gave him a seven track demo he had recorded, and invited him to join the nascent band. McIlrath accepted the invitation, and dropped out of Northeastern Illinois University.

The initial jam sessions were problematic, as McIlrath was unaccustomed to Principe&#x27;s and Wleklinski&#x27;s fast-paced style of play. McIlrath described these early sessions as &quot;the meeting of different worlds and worlds colliding&quot;, and noted how many of his friends questioned the future of the band. Despite these early issues, they were able to self-publish the extended play (EP) &quot;Transistor Revolt&quot; in 2000. The EP attracted the attention of the local punk community, as well as Fat Mike, the lead vocalist of NOFX and co-founder of the independent record label Fat Wreck Chords. Fat Mike offered to sign the band to a recording contract, with the stipulation that they change their name. He gave some suggestions, like Jimmy Cracked Corn And The I Don&#x27;t Cares, although none of the band members liked them. Tintari suggested Rise Against, to which the band agreed upon.

After signing with Fat Wreck Chords, Tintari and White left the band. The remaining members then spent the next few months looking for another drummer capable of playing double-time beats at a rapid pace. During this period, the band Good Riddance found their new drummer, and sent Rise Against the audition tape of their number two choice, Brandon Barnes. A mutual friend gave Barnes&#x27; phone number to Principe, and after listening to &quot;Transistor Revolt&quot;, Barnes accepted the band&#x27;s invitation.

With their new lineup finalized, Rise Against began work on their debut studio album, &quot;The Unraveling&quot;. Recording sessions took place in late 2000, at Sonic Iguana Studios in Lafayette. Wleklinski served as an assistant engineer under producer Mass Giorgini, and later remarked on the grueling workdays: &quot;12-hour days for 4 of those weeks, and then 22 to 24 hours per day during that last week of tracking. These were the times of &#x27;If you don&#x27;t play it right, you have to play it again,&#x27; not &#x27;That was good enough, I&#x27;ll edit it so it&#x27;s on time.&quot; &quot;The Unraveling&quot; was released on April 24, 2001. Although the album failed to reach any record charts, it did receive positive reviews from critics, who commended the raw and unadulterated music. To promote the album, Rise Against toured extensively throughout North America and Europe. While on tour, Wleklinski left the band due to several complaints from McIlrath. Rumor spread that Wleklinski was fired because of his long hair, although McIlrath derided these claims. Phillip Hill stood in as the lead guitarist while on tour, after which White returned as a replacement.
Less than a year later, White left the band for a second time, and was replaced by Todd Mohney, McIlrath&#x27;s roommate and former bandmate. When it came time to record their second album, &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot;, McIlrath noted that the band was suffering from an &quot;identity crisis&quot;. Fat Wreck Chords was known for a specific pop punk sound, and Rise Against wanted to find a producer that could highlight the heavier side of their music. They decided on Bill Stevenson—the former drummer of the punk band Descendents—and Jason Livermore to produce the album. &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; was recorded at the Blasting Room in Fort Collins, from November to December 2002. The band members developed a strong rapport with Stevenson and Livermore, and the two parties would eventually collaborate on four of next five Rise Against albums.

&quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; was released on April 8, 2003. Like &quot;The Unraveling&quot;, it failed to reach any major record charts, but did reach number thirty-five on the Independent Albums chart in the United States. Critics praised the album for its impassioned lyrics and unique blend of hardcore punk and melodic hardcore; Brian Hiatt of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; &quot;easily among the finest punk records of the past decade&quot;. To support the album, Rise Against traveled with other Fat Wreck Chord bands like Anti-Flag, None More Black, and No Use for a Name on North American and Japan based tours, and participated in the 2003 Warped Tour in North America. When asked about the band&#x27;s early years with Fat Wreck Chords, Principe said: &quot;Our goal was to be on Fat Wreck Chords and just sell enough records so that when we were home from tour, we wouldn&#x27;t have to get jobs...Of course, that was all before we had families and children and numerous responsibilities. That was the beauty. And then the longer we did it things just kept coming our way.&quot;

===Rising popularity (2004–2007)===
Rise Against&#x27;s extensive touring schedule helped to establish an early fanbase, and attracted the attention of major record labels, including Dreamworks Records. The general consensus among Fat Wreck Chords musicians was that major record labels sacrifice musical integrity in exchange for commercial profit. Rise Against held the same belief, but eventually came to the conclusion that unlike other labels, DreamWorks supported their politically charged lyrics. According to McIlrath: &quot;Their faith in what we do and the fact that they cared about stuff we cared about was an eye-opener.&quot; The band signed with Dreamworks in September 2003, and was given complete creative control to record their major record label debut album, &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot;.

The band went into the album with the assumption that Dreamworks was going to drop them at any moment, so they wanted to take advantage of the opportunity by working with their &quot;dream producer&quot;. They chose Garth Richardson, who was known for his work with heavier sounding bands like Rage Against the Machine and Sick of It All. While writing songs for the album, Rise Against&#x27;s lineup once again changed; Mohney quit, and was replaced by Chris Chasse of the band Reach the Sky. The recording sessions for &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; were marred by numerous distractions and inconveniences, the biggest of which was the transition from Dreamworks to Geffen Records. In November 2003, Dreamworks was acquired by Universal Music Group, and eventually merged with Geffen. The transition period between labels left Rise Against without an A&amp;R representative, and little acknowledgement from Geffen executives.

&quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; was released on August 10, 2004. For the first six months, the album sold poorly, and attracted little fanfare. Rise Against&#x27;s incessant touring resulted in greater exposure and an eventual increase in sales. It became the band&#x27;s first album to reach the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at number 136, and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of 500,000 copies. &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot; was praised for its lyrical content, but drew some criticism for a lack of individually memorable songs and perceived overproduction. Three songs from the album were released as singles: &quot;Give It All&quot;, &quot;Swing Life Away&quot;, and &quot;Life Less Frightening&quot;. All three songs charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart in the United States. &quot;Give It All&quot; and &quot;Swing Life Away&quot; in particular are credited as the band&#x27;s breakthrough singles, helping Rise Against achieve mainstream appeal.
After a year and a half of touring, Rise Against reconvened at the Blasting Room to record their fourth album, &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot;. The band members were dissatisfied with Richardson&#x27;s contributions to &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot;, as he produced a more polished and heavier album than their previous works. As a result, they decided to return to Stevenson and Livermore, who they felt had accurately captured the raw punk sound they strove for on &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot;. Unlike the stressful recording sessions for &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot;, the band had a much more enjoyable time with &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot;, as they no longer sought the approval of Geffen executives. According to McIlrath: &quot;It went great, the songs just flowed out of us. There were really few questions and the song lyrics would just come out of us, it went really well and everyone really liked them.&quot;

&quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot; was released on July 4, 2006. The album sold 48,327 copies in its first week of release in the United States, and peaked at number ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot; also charted in seven other countries, including number five on the Canadian Albums Chart, making it the band&#x27;s first album to chart outside of the United States. It was certified gold in three countries, and platinum by Music Canada. The album was well received by critics, who praised the production value, and noted how Rise Against was able to mature in their sound and simultaneously retain their punk roots.

Three songs from &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot; were released as singles: &quot;Ready to Fall&quot;, &quot;Prayer of the Refugee&quot;, and &quot;The Good Left Undone&quot;. These three songs also charted on the Modern Rock Tracks chart, with &quot;Prayer of the Refugee&quot; and &quot;The Good Left Undone&quot; in particular peaking within the top ten. Rise Against supported the album with The Sufferer &amp; the Witness Tour throughout the second half of 2006 and all of 2007. The band was a headliner on the 2006 Warped Tour, during which author and filmmaker Davy Rothbart recorded several of the band&#x27;s live performances, and interviewed some of their fans. This footage was used in the Rise Against DVD documentary &quot;Generation Lost&quot;. Prior to a 2007 tour with My Chemical Romance, Chasse left the band, citing touring fatigue as the reason for his departure; his role was filled shortly thereafter by Zach Blair of the band Only Crime. At the time he received the call about joining Rise Against, Blair was a construction worker living paycheck to paycheck.

===International success (2008–2013)===
McIlrath and Principe had been writing songs for a new album throughout The Sufferer &amp; Witness tour, and in December 2007, the band members went to the Blasting Room to record their fifth studio album &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;. This was the third Rise Against album to be produced by Stevenson and Livermore, and the band members had grown accustomed to the duo&#x27;s work style. According to McIlrath: &quot;[Stevenson&#x27;s] got such a work ethic, just an amazing work ethic, and Livermore too, and the whole studio, all the people that work there.&quot; Blair went into the album with the goal to fit in seamlessly with the other band members, or as he put it &quot;If you listen to every record this band had out, you could tell that Zach Blair played on this record&quot;. He took influence from how Nels Cline sounded on the album &quot;Sky Blue Sky&quot; when he joined Wilco. Blair was already well acquainted with Stevenson before joining Rise Against, as he and Stevenson were in Only Crime. Stevenson helped Blair replicate the sound of past Rise Against guitarists.

&quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; was released on October 7, 2008. It was the first Rise Against album to be released by Interscope Records. In the United States, the album peaked at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, making it Rise Against&#x27;s highest-charting album at the time. The album sold 64,000 copies in its first week of release, and by December 2010, it had sold 482,000 copies. Rise Against&#x27;s popularity continued to grow internationally, with &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; charting highly in several countries including number one in Canadian Albums Chart. &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; marked a musical shift for Rise Against to a more mainstream and radio-friendly sound, which led to division among critical opinions. Some critics commended the album&#x27;s more radio-friendly sound, while other critics found the music to be stale, and bemoaned Rise Against for abandoning their punk roots.
Like with the previous two albums, three songs from &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; were released as singles: &quot;Re-Education (Through Labor)&quot;, &quot;Audience of One&quot;, and &quot;Savior&quot;. All three songs charted highly on the Modern Rock Tracks chart; &quot;Savior&quot; in particular held the record for the most consecutive weeks spent on both the Hot Rock Songs and Modern Rock Tracks charts, with sixty-three and sixty-five weeks respectively. In the midst of &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; singles, Rise Against also released three EPs in 2009, including a short split album with Anti-Flag.

To promote the album, Rise Against embarked on the Appeal To Reason Tour, which began with United States–based tour with Thrice, Alkaline Trio, and The Gaslight Anthem. Rise Against then co-headlined a 2009 tour with Rancid throughout the summer months, which was followed by a short tour of the United Kingdom in November, supported by the bands Thursday and Poison the Well. Some of the 2009 performances were recorded and compiled in the 2010 DVD &quot;Another Station: Another Mile&quot;. These performances were interspersed with interviews of the band members about the process of recording an album.

Rise Against finished recording their sixth studio album, &quot;Endgame&quot;, in January 2011, after recording some last-minute guest vocals. The lyrics of the album focus on real world events, such as Hurricane Katrina and the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. According to McIlrath, although the lyrics discuss grim topics, they actually take on a positive view and were written from the perspective of: &quot;What if the place on the other side of this transition is a place we&#x27;d all rather be living in?&quot; On January 12, 2011, Rise Against announced the release date of &quot;Endgame&quot; as March 15, 2011. Although Spin Magazine labeled &quot;Endgame&quot; as a concept album, on January 7, 2011, McIlrath tweeted a clarifying message stating that &quot;the record is not a concept record and, fret not, has absolutely nothing to do with the Dixie Chicks.&quot; The first single from the album, &quot;Help Is on the Way&quot;, debuted on KROQ on January 17. A second song from the album, &quot;Architects&quot;, was debuted and released digitally on February 15. As a promotion effort, the band embarked on a short tour of South America in February and then a month-long tour of Europe in March. Upon returning to the United States, the band announced a U.S. spring tour with Bad Religion and Four Year Strong.

 &quot;Endgame&quot; is notable for being the first album to establish Rise Against&#x27;s stance on homophobia with the third song on the album, &quot;Make It Stop (September&#x27;s Children),&quot; which references the September 2010 suicides of teenagers in the LGBT community. Upon the album&#x27;s release, the band put a message on their website inviting listeners to apply the songs&#x27; messages to current events, in addition to those on which they were originally based.

On May 10, 2011, the band released a 7&quot; split vinyl with Face to Face. The 7&quot; features two songs, with each band covering a song by the other band. In August 2011, Rise Against made appearances at the Reading and Leeds Festivals. The band was the main support act for the Foo Fighters&#x27; fall US tour 2011. Rise Against supported the Foo Fighters on nine dates in September, with Mariachi El Bronx as the opening act. After this, the band announced a tour of Canada throughout October 2011, supported by Flogging Molly and Black Pacific. The tour consisted of nine dates. Rise Against contributed a cover of &quot;Ballad of Hollis Brown&quot; to &quot;Chimes of Freedom&quot;, a tribute album of Bob Dylan songs produced in February 2012 to commemorate Amnesty International&#x27;s 50th anniversary.

Rise Against embarked on a two-leg US tour with A Day to Remember and The Menzingers in the spring of 2012. Leg one ended with the band launching another European tour. The band continued back to Europe for the summer months while doing a slew of festivals along the way. To end 2012, the band announced the return to the US with a fall tour with Gaslight Anthem and Hot Water Music. The tour included two shows in Arizona, which the band had not played since 2009 due to the Sound Strike. On January 2, 2013, vocalist Tim McIlrath told &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; that Rise Against was &quot;focusing on recharging [their] batteries&quot; after two years of touring in support of &quot;Endgame&quot;. In March 2013, Rise Against played their first ever performances on African soil when they performed in South Africa for the Durban, Johannesburg and Cape Town legs of RAMFest, where they headlined the festival along with the UK band Bring Me the Horizon.

=== Continued success (2014–2022) ===

The extensive touring schedule surrounding &quot;Endgame&quot; took a toll on the band members, and in 2013 they decided to take a year long hiatus. According to Blair: &quot;You&#x27;re constantly gone. You don&#x27;t feel like you live anywhere&quot;. He also discussed how the other three band members lives had evolved, and were away from their families for months on end. &quot;It&#x27;s an interesting thing to kind of realize that and kind of get out of the bubble, get out of the bus, and go &#x27;Oh, geez, we actually have lives outside of what we do.&#x27;&quot; In January 2014, the band members reconvened at the Blasting Room to record Rise Against&#x27;s seventh album &quot;The Black Market&quot;. The band members used new recording techniques, such as greater usage of analog signals on a Kemper amplifier, and an Evertune bridge to keep the guitars in tune. As McIlrath put it: &quot;I want the songs to feel a certain way. I want the songs to hit the guy and the girl who don&#x27;t really care about guitar tones.&quot;

&quot;The Black Market&quot; was released on July 15, 2014. In the United States, the album entered at number three on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and sold 53,000 copies in its first week. It was their fourth consecutive album to debut within the top ten on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and it spent eleven weeks on the chart. &quot;The Black Market&quot; was an international success, in particular in Canada, where it became Rise Against&#x27;s third consecutive album to reach number one. Reviews were generally positive; critics praised the more introspective lyrics, but often bemoaned the music as formulaic and stale. To promote the album, Rise Against toured throughout 2014 and 2015 with several other rock bands, such as Emily&#x27;s Army, Touché Amoré, and Killswitch Engage.
On April 18, 2017, the band posted a new mysterious website which appeared to show a cryptic tracklist, song length and an announcement date &quot;4.20.2017&quot; for the new album.
On April 20, 2017, Rise Against announced the title of their new album &quot;Wolves&quot; which was released on June 9, 2017, via Virgin Records. The album&#x27;s lead single, &quot;The Violence&quot;, was released on April 20, 2017. To promote the album, the band announced a headlining North American tour in fall 2017 with Pierce the Veil and White Lung supporting.

On March 29, 2018, the band&#x27;s Instagram account published a video announcing a project entitled &quot;The Ghost Note Symphonies, Vol. 1&quot;. A later announcement described the album as having &quot;the songs stripped down, with alternate instrumentation, unique orchestration and a surprise or two&quot; and announced a release date of July 27, 2018. The band released an acoustic version of &quot;House on Fire&quot; from &quot;Wolves&quot; as a single for the album on May 18 and an acoustic version of &quot;Like the Angel&quot; from &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; on June 8.

Following touring for &quot;Wolves&quot;, Rise Against chose to take a more relaxed approach to writing their next album. In an interview with Kerrang!, McIlrath explained that &quot;we don&#x27;t want to feel rushed, we&#x27;ll put out the record when it&#x27;s done, not to try and meet some deadline.&quot; New music began to be released in 2020, when the band collaborated with DC comics on the Dark Nights: Death Metal series. The band released a new song called &quot;Broken Dreams, Inc&quot; as the first single for the comic book storyline&#x27;s soundtrack.

News of a new Rise Against album began to surface in early 2021 when the band began posting cryptic videos on their social media accounts. These videos eventually lead to the announcement of &quot;Nowhere Generation&quot; on March 17, 2021. Along with &quot;Broken Dreams, Inc&quot; being included on the track list, the band also released the title track as the second single. Additional singles, &quot;The Numbers&quot; and &quot;Talking to Ourselves&quot; were also released prior to the album, which released on June 4, 2021. The band embarked on a US tour in support of the album that summer with the Descendents and The Menzingers as opening acts. This was followed by multiple 2022 tours with Billy Talent, The Used, Senses Fail, Pennywise, and Stick To Your Guns.

During the recording process for &quot;Nowhere Generation&quot;, Rise Against wrote a total of sixteen songs, but only included eleven of them on the album. The remaining five were eventually released in 2022 as &quot;Nowhere Generation II&quot;; an EP that acts as a continuation of the album. It was announced alongside the release of the single &quot;Last Man Standing&quot; on June 6, 2022, with the EP releasing four days later.

=== Recent year (2023–present) ===
In November 2024, Rise Against announced a co-headlining US tour alongside Papa Roach. Later that year, McIlrath revealed that the band was working on new music, with an intended release the following year: &quot;We have a lot of new music done and we&#x27;re looking forward to sharing the music with the world next year.&quot; On January 23, 2025, the band released a new single called &quot;Nod&quot;.

==Artistry==
===Musical style===
Critics have described Rise Against&#x27;s musical style as punk rock, hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. The band&#x27;s songs emphasize melody, catchy hooks, aggressive movements, and rapid-paced tempo. Guitarists McIlrath and Blair focus on speed riffing and multi-layered choruses, while bassist Principe uses aggressive picking to lock in with the snare and kick of the drums. Likewise, drummer Barnes follows the guitars, stating: &quot;Sometimes I&#x27;ll do it naturally, or we&#x27;ll talk about different ways to accent things - fills from the snare or toms, or some big crashes.&quot; The band members have noted the influence of several punk bands, in particular Black Flag and Minor Threat. In a 2006 interview with &quot;Punknews&quot;, McIlrath commented: &quot;We&#x27;re emulating Minor Threat and Black Flag. Who knows, maybe if Ian MacKaye was wearing eyeliner then I would be.&quot; Other bands that have influenced Rise Against include 7 Seconds, AFI, Bad Brains, Bad Religion, Berri Txarrak, Bikini Kill, Cave In, the Clash, Coalesce, Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, the Cure, Dead Kennedys, Desaparecidos, Descendents, Down by Law, Echo &amp; the Bunnymen, Earth Crisis, Face to Face, Flobots, Fugazi, Guns N&#x27; Roses, Ignite, Jawbreaker, Los Crudos, Janelle Monáe, NOFX, Pennywise, Propagandhi, Public Enemy, Quicksand, Rage Against the Machine, Ramones, Rancid, Refused, Samiam, Gil Scott-Heron, Screeching Weasel, Shades Apart, Sidekick Kato, Sick of It All, Patti Smith, Social Distortion and Touché Amoré.

During the early part of its career, Rise Against&#x27;s music was characterized by a gritty sound described by critics as both hardcore punk and melodic hardcore. &quot;The Unraveling&quot; accentuated a raw punk sound, while &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; featured an overall darker tone. According to Principe: &quot;&quot;The Unraveling&quot; was more of us just trying to figure out how we functioned as a band and what type of band we wanted to be. It all just came together with [&quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot;], my songwriting style and Tim&#x27;s, it really meshes well together and I think it shows on that record. Although this darker tone carried into &quot;Siren Song of the Counter Culture&quot;, McIlrath specially mentioned that &quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot; was an attempt to return to Rise Against&#x27;s punk roots. Corey Apar of AllMusic wrote &quot;[&quot;The Sufferer &amp; the Witness&quot;] is basically one shout-along, mosh-worthy song after another&quot;. In early Rise Against songs, McIlrath would often shift between clean vocals and screaming vocals.

With the release of &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, Rise Against&#x27;s music took a noticeable turn toward a more accessible and radio-friendly sound, with greater emphasis on production value. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Jon Pareles felt &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot; was more tune-oriented than the band&#x27;s previous material, while Davey Boy of Sputnikmusic wrote how &quot;Endgame&quot; was &quot;slickly produced to enhance the melodic nature of songs&quot;. Principe believes the shift in sound resulted from the longevity of the Rise Against. He explained that the band members grew as musicians, and wanted to challenge themselves with new musical directions. For example, at the insistence of Blair, Rise Against began to incorporate more guitar solos into their music. McIlrath&#x27;s screaming vocals became less prevalent in &quot;Appeal to Reason&quot;, a trend that would continue in subsequent albums.

===Lyrics===
Rise Against is known for their outspoken social commentary, which often permeates their lyrics. Throughout the years, the band has discussed a wide range of topics, including animal rights, economic injustice, environmental disasters, forced displacement, homophobia, and modern warfare. Political corruption is another subject commonly found in their lyrics, and as a result, Rise Against is often labeled as a &quot;political band&quot;. Some journalists have stated that the band has specifically targeted the Republican administrations of George W. Bush and Donald Trump, while promoting anarchist ideologies.

As the band&#x27;s primary lyricist, McIlrath is wary of the political label. &quot;In this sort of current climate of music, we stand out simply because I think there are bands that are avoiding the question. So, it makes us sort of an anomaly and I think that&#x27;s where we get the tag &#x27;protest music&#x27; or &#x27;political punk rock&#x27;&quot;. He also noted how the band&#x27;s lyrics discuss these topics in general terms, instead of delving into the specifics. In a 2006 interview, McIlrath said: &quot;I think that a lot of the problems we deal with today in the world are the ones that have been plaguing society for centuries and probably will be here a hundred years from now...There&#x27;s a bigger picture than just the Bush administration and specific problems of 2006, and I want people to relate to that, even if they&#x27;re listening to [our music] 10 years from now.&quot; Principe noted the band does not attempt to preach their beliefs, but instead encourage listeners to become involved, and learn about pertinent issues affecting society.

Not all Rise Against songs discuss controversial topics. More personal stories about broken relationships and forgiveness are common lyrical themes, as is the concept of self-reflection. &quot;The Unraveling&quot; is an early example of this style of songwriting, as the majority of the album&#x27;s songs focus on friendships and memories. It was not until &quot;Revolutions per Minute&quot; that McIlrath began to integrate social issues into their music. Despite the grim subject matter, Rise Against songs are often hopeful in nature, a decision the band conscientiously made from the very beginning. Will Rausch of &quot;PopMatters&quot; wrote: &quot;Unlike typical emo rants filled with despondency and arm chair philosophy, [Rise Against] songs deal with the reality that life sucks, but we must move on.&quot;

===Videography===
Rise Against will often produce an accompanying music video for a single. These videos typically either tell a narrative or feature documentary-like footage. This documentary style of filming can be seen in the music videos for &quot;Ready to Fall&quot;, &quot;Re-Education (Through Labor)&quot;, &quot;Ballad of Hollis Brown&quot;, and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Be Here Anymore&quot;. These videos juxtapose footage of the band playing the song and footage of a certain societal issue such as gun violence or animal abuse, overlaid with damning facts about the issue. For example, the video &quot;Ballad of Hollis Brown&quot; is about the dangers of industrialized farming and poverty in the United States, and features interviews with farmers who are struggling to stay afloat.

Rise Against&#x27;s narrative videos are also usually political in nature. In the video for &quot;Prayer of the Refugee&quot; the band destroys products in a retail store, with intermittent shots of foreign workers making the store products. The goal was for the video to showcase how conventional business models allow for various human rights violations. Some narrative videos follow the song&#x27;s lyric thread, such as in the Hurricane Katrina–based video for &quot;Help Is on the Way&quot;, while other videos are used to enforce the song&#x27;s message, such as the band&#x27;s anti-homophobic stance in the &quot;Make It Stop (September&#x27;s Children)&quot; video.

Discussing the &quot;Ready to Fall&quot; video and need for politicized music videos, McIlrath said: &quot;We looked at it from the perspective of hijacking the airwaves. If they&#x27;re gonna give us three and a half minutes of airtime on TV that means we can play anything, we can make a video that would be intense even on mute&quot;. Rise Against has garnered some controversy for their music videos, particularly for perceived violent themes. The video for &quot;Re-Education (Through Labor)&quot; features the Chicago sect of the Moped Army planting and detonating bombs throughout the city. Some viewers saw this as an act of condoning terrorism. The video for &quot;The Violence&quot;, which was to feature the detonation of busts of the forty-three United States Presidents on a plot of farmland, was prohibited by the farm&#x27;s board of directors for &quot;anti-government themes&quot;.

==Politics and ethics==
Rise Against is known for supporting progressive politics. &quot;Kerrang!&quot; described them as &quot;the torchbearers of politically-charged music&quot; for addressing subjects ranging from climate change to homophobia in their songs.

The band&#x27;s members are vegetarian and, aside from drummer Brandon Barnes, are straight edge – refraining from the consumption of alcohol or drugs. The music video for the single &quot;Ready to Fall&quot; contains footage of factory farming, rodeos, and sport hunting, as well as deforestation, melting ice caps, and forest fires. The group has called the video the most important video they have ever made. After they endorsed a &quot;completely vegan&quot; line of Vans shoes in May 2007, the band released a statement in response to criticism of Vans&#x27; use of sweatshops. McIlrath said that animal rights were his &quot;gateway drug into activism in general.&quot;

The band were outspoken critics against the Iraq War. McIlrath described it as an &quot;unjustified invasion&quot; that &quot;is taking our beloved soldiers – our brothers and sisters and wives and husbands – away from us.&quot; The band was once kicked off a Florida music festival because they refused to play on a stage that was sponsored by the United States Army.

The band has also supported several Democratic Party candidates in the United States. During the 2004 United States presidential election, the band was part of Punkvoter, a political activist group, and appeared on the &quot;Rock Against Bush, Vol. 1&quot; compilation. The Rock Against Bush project raised over $1 million for then presidential candidate John Kerry. During the 2008 presidential election, the band members endorsed Barack Obama. In a news bulletin in early 2009, the band stated: &quot;Few things are more exciting than watching Bush finally release America as his eight year hostage.&quot;

In 2017, McIlrath said: &quot;The Trump administration has made our job really easy because we’ve been trying to point out some of what the right wing tries to get away with—and now they’re not even trying to get away with it. They’re just telling you they’re fucking you!&quot; Following the 2020 election, he commented that &quot;The groundwork that existed to create a candidate like Trump or even to create voters for him was there before he was there, and just because he’s out of office doesn’t mean the problems of the world or in our country suddenly disappear.&quot;

Following the overturning of &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; in 2022, the band issued a statement condemning the decision for how it &quot;only ended safe abortion for people without the resources to travel; disproportionately non-white working class communities.&quot;

<text>Sasquatch (Walter Langkowski) is a superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.

==Publication history==

Sasquatch first appeared in &quot;The Uncanny X-Men&quot; #120 (April 1979) and was created by John Byrne.

==Fictional character biography==
Dr. Walter &#x27;Walt&#x27; Langkowski is a founding member of Alpha Flight, a native of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, renowned physicist, and professor at McGill University. He was also a professional football player for the Green Bay Packers. In the 1993 miniseries The Infinity Crusade it is revealed that Langkowski is Jewish.

As Sasquatch, he possessed the ability to change into a massive, super-strong and orange-furred beast. In this form, Langkowski had immense physical attributes and natural weaponry.

===Origin===
This alternate form was due to Langkowski&#x27;s self-experimentation with gamma radiation. In an attempt to replicate the process that transformed Bruce Banner into the Hulk, Langkowski bombarded himself with a gamma ray projector at an isolated laboratory near the Arctic Circle. 

The experiment transformed Langkowski into a raging beast. He destroyed the laboratory and ran off into the Arctic wilderness before reverting to his human form. He was recovered by a Canadian search-and-rescue team and taken to a hospital for observation. While recovering, he told his colleague James MacDonald Hudson (a.k.a. Guardian) to call him &quot;Sasquatch.&quot; 

Langkowski was baffled to discover his alter ego had orange fur instead of green skin (which is common to gamma mutates). He speculated that the gamma rays collected were contaminated by passage through the Aurora Borealis, which meant they might have included some cosmic rays as well.

However, unknown to Langkowski, it was not the gamma rays that turned him into Sasquatch. His lab equipment opened a doorway between their world and the &quot;Realm of the Great Beasts,&quot; monsters from Canada&#x27;s prehistoric past. When the gap opened, a mystical beast named Tanaraq switched places with Langkowski&#x27;s body, granting him the beast&#x27;s physical powers. These included superhuman strength and endurance. 

His metamorphosis was triggered by willpower, sometimes requiring a few moments of meditation. Further, Langkowski had no difficulty maintaining his personality and intelligence while in Sasquatch form.

===Alpha Flight===
As a founding member of the Canadian superhero team Alpha Flight, Sasquatch battled the X-Men in an attempt to capture Wolverine. The fight between the two teams caused a huge amount of property damage at the Calgary Stampede shopping area, as well as the loss of a DC-10 that Sasquatch flung into a hangar. 

Sasquatch later battled the Hulk, to test his own physical limits, then fought alongside the Hulk against the Wendigo. 

Not long after, Alpha Flight was officially disbanded by its government agency, Department H. However, when Guardian called upon the scattered team members, he joined Alpha Flight to take down the Great Beast Tundra. 

The team soon after worked with Namor, and the Invisible Woman, encountering the Master of the World. On his own, he faced the Super-Skrull. and then rejoined the team to fight Omega Flight in New York City, where the team lost Guardian. 

Alongside Rom, Alpha Flight fought the Dire Wraiths. and then joined the X-Men on a journey to Asgard, where they clashed with Loki. 

===Tanaraq===
While shopping with his girlfriend Aurora, Sasquatch encountered and fought a new armored villain, Calibre. Shot in the chest and seriously injured, Langkowski lost control, allowing the spirit of Tanaraq to inhabit Sasquatch. Tanaraq threatened to kill Aurora and wreak havoc. Confronted by Walt&#x27;s teammate Snowbird, Tanaraq was killed when Snowbird transformed into a white-furred Sasquatch and ripped out the beast&#x27;s heart. Upon the body&#x27;s death, Langkowski&#x27;s spirit was lost.

===New Body and Identity===
After his death, Langkowski&#x27;s teammates traveled to the realm of the Great Beasts to recover his soul. However, a preservation spell cast by Alpha Flight&#x27;s sorcerer Shaman failed to prevent Langkowski&#x27;s body from crumbling to dust. 

Once in the land of the Great Beasts, they were attacked by the monsters&#x27; leader Somon, who summoned his allies Tundra, Kariooq, and Tolomaq against them. Snowbird battled Somon, eventually forcing him to relinquish control of the others; leaderless, the monsters turned on each other and ignored Alpha Flight. 

Forcing the now-weakened Somon to reveal to them the location of Langkowski&#x27;s spirit, Alpha Flight ventured to the Pit of Ultimate Sadness, located beneath the Great Glow-Globe of Phistash-Hasrak, where Somon explained that the souls of those who once inhabited the realm existed in torment. Somon told them that, to enter the Pit&#x27;s Well of Sorrows, they must sacrifice love, hate, and power. Sending Aurora (representing love), Northstar (representing hate), and Talisman (representing power), Alpha Flight realized the Well was a trap set by Somon. 

Snowbird killed Somon and three trapped Alphans were reunited with the rest of the team. Shaman deduced from Somon&#x27;s trap that no actual souls still remained within the Well of Sorrows but rather, the only wandering soul (Walter&#x27;s) resided within the Glow-Globe of Phistash-Hasrak. Containing Walter&#x27;s soul within a globe of its own from his pouch, Shaman then transported Alpha Flight back to Earth, where they met with Heather Hudson and Box. 

Lacking a body, in desperation, Shaman projected the soul into the robot Box, who had arrived as the Alphans returned to Earth. After searching for a habitable but mindless body, Langkowski and Box&#x27;s creator, Roger Bochs, eventually found a nearly-mindless humanoid in another dimension. However, when the pair projected Langkowski&#x27;s soul along an interdimensional &quot;fishing line&quot;, it turned out to be the Hulk. Langkowski, unwilling to displace his colleague and friend Bruce Banner (despite Banner&#x27;s pleas to the contrary), let his soul dissipate into the interdimensional void.

===Return and &quot;White Sasquatch&quot;===
However, Langkowski wasn&#x27;t dead. He returned soon afterward by temporarily inhabiting the shrunken, mindless body of Smart Alec, which had been kept in Shaman&#x27;s pouch. 

He then switched over to occupy Snowbird&#x27;s then-deceased body (with her permission). In Snowbird&#x27;s body, Walt lacked Snowbird&#x27;s shapeshifting powers and was limited to either Snowbird&#x27;s (female) human form and a white-furred version of his Sasquatch form. Now biologically female, she called herself &quot;Wanda Langkowski&quot;, and fought to be recognized as legally alive. Snowbird&#x27;s spirit later altered her former body to be identical of his original self. After this, Sasquatch regained his original orange coloration. 

Among his later adventures with Alpha Flight, Walt battled Llan the Sorcerer, then joined the Avengers, and the People&#x27;s Protectorate against the Atlantean army, the Peace Corpse, and the Combine. The team also helped defend Her against the Consortium.

===2000s: New Teams, New Troubles===
In 2005, Sasquatch assembled another incarnation of Alpha Flight in order to rescue the original team from an alien race known as the Plodex. Sales were poor and the series was canceled with issue #12.

Along with Major Mapleleaf, Puck (both Eugene Judd and Zuzha Yu), Vindicator, Shaman, and Guardian, Sasquatch fights The Collective. He is later revealed to be the only member of Alpha Flight to survive the attack. Following the events of the 2006 &quot;Civil War&quot; storyline, Langkowski is recruited by the Canadian government to form a new team called Omega Flight. He goes out of control when possessed by the Great Beast, Tanaraq, but manages to recover. He also forgives Michael Pointer for the indirect role he played in the destruction of Alpha Flight and apologized for forcing him into the role of Guardian. 

Along with American mutants Wolfsbane, Thornn, and Feral, Sasquatch went to Wakanda to help Wolverine against Sabretooth. Feral was killed by Sabretooth while the villain Romulus made plans of his own involving the group.

During the 2010 &quot;Chaos War&quot; storyline, Sasquatch made a deal with the Great Beasts, bringing them to Earth so they can kill Amatusu-Mikaboshi. Teaming up with Snowbird, Northstar, and Aurora, they reunited with a resurrected Guardian, Vindicator, Shaman, and Marrina Smallwood.

During the 2011 &quot;Fear Itself&quot; storyline, Sasquatch was seen helping Alpha Flight fight Attuma (in the form of Nerkodd: Breaker of Oceans) while saving people from a cataclysmic flood. Once Nerkodd was defeated, Alpha Flight was almost immediately betrayed by former ally Gary Cody and his newly elected Unity Party. When in the custody of the Unity Party, Sasquatch&#x27;s gamma energy is drained enough for him to revert to his human form. 

At Parliament Hill--the heart of the Canadian government--Walt is told by Agent Jeff Brown that concussions sustained when he played football will cause him to act less human when he changes back into Sasquatch. Jeff also tells Walt that he will soon achieve Unity. Walt is later freed by Shaman who knocks out Brown. The team was instrumental in exposing Unity as a front for a planned takeover of Canada.

As part of the 2015 All-New, All-Different Marvel branding, Sasquatch was as part of the Alpha Flight space program and was among the heroes stranded in space when Captain America (secretly a Hydra agent at that time) closed a forcefield around Earth.

====Immortal Hulk====
While taking time off from the Alpha Flight space program, Walt met a reporter named Jackie McGee and agreed to aid her in her search for Bruce Banner. After Walt was stabbed breaking up a fight between two men, he wound up in the hospital where he turned into Sasquatch that night. After killing doctors that were treating him, Sasquatch encounters Hulk who realized Walt was possessed by Brian Banner&#x27;s ghost. Hulk freed Sasquatch from Brian&#x27;s possession by draining enough gamma energy to depower Walt. It was revealed that Brian Banner&#x27;s possession of Sasquatch was caused by the One Below All.

General Reginald Fortean nearly charged Walter for the deaths he caused but changed his mind; instead, he had Captain Marvel send the Avengers after Hulk. After Hulk escaped from General Fortean&#x27;s custody, Walt and Puck formed a new version of Gamma Flight to go after Hulk.

Walt and Gamma Flight arrived at the area where the gamma bomb first turned Bruce Banner into the Hulk. As Hulk fought Gamma Flight, Absorbing Man absorbed the leftover gamma radiation that enabled the One Below All to plunge New Mexico into its Below Place. After Hulk defeated the One Below All, Walter and Gamma Flight were returned to Earth, where Absorbing Man joined the group.

With Titania as its latest member, Walter and Gamma Flight ran into Doc Samson who revealed Hulk&#x27;s plan to wipe out human civilization.

Arriving in Reno, Nevada, Walt and Gamma Flight found the Subject B husk in which the U.S. Hulk Operations placed Rick Jones&#x27; body. They took it to the Alpha Flight Low-Orbit Space Station for study. Wearing the Redeemer armor, General Fortean raided the station to reclaim the Subject B husk. While taking out Gamma Flight, Fortean shot Walter to avenge the deaths Sasquatch caused.

===Doc Sasquatch and Walt Samson===
In the Below Place, Samson discovered that gamma mutates had a way back to life by means of a green door opened by the One Below All. Anyone with gamma radiation could self-resurrect this way, so long as the door was open.

However, the Leader had learned how to manipulate the doors, including figuring out how to close them.

With his door in the Below Place obstructed, Doc Samson searched for an alternative. He discovered one and ended up revived in Walt Langkowski&#x27;s body on the Alpha Flight station. When he woke and transformed, his innate gamma radiation gave the resulting Sasquatch form green fur instead of orange. Samson told Gamma Flight about the Leader&#x27;s meddling and dubbed himself &quot;Doc Sasquatch.&quot; Leading Gamma Flight to confront Hulk&#x27;s gray Joe Fixit persona, Doc prevented everyone from getting sucked out into space when Fixit punched a hole in the space station.

Meanwhile, Walt returned the favor by occupying Samson&#x27;s body and named himself Walt Samson. He made his way to the Baxter Building where he helped the Fantastic Four locate the Below Place to retrieve Bruce Banner and Jackie McGee.

Although Reed Richards promised to restore them to their own bodies, Walt Samson was still with Alpha Flight when the team pretended to work alongside the mutant-extermination coalition Orchis. In reality, they were rounding up mutants to evacuate them from Earth (see Alpha Flight miniseries, 2023). He was part of the support team helping with the evacuation and was not apprehended along with Guardian, Puck, Shaman, and Snowbird.

Walt is not Sasquatch at the present time and his whereabouts are unknown.

==Powers and abilities==
As Sasquatch, Langkowski possessed abnormal strength and stamina, as well as resistance to injury (in an early appearance, he fought the Hulk for &quot;fun&quot; in order to test his limits). He is strong enough to pull a naval destroyer ashore for repairs, as well as hold a DC-10 cargo plane against the thrust of its engines and then hurl it over 1,000 feet backward. Thanks to his thick fur, he can survive easily in extreme arctic environments. Sasquatch is able to jump vast distances, but not as well as the Hulk. His claws are sharp and durable enough to cut through stone, wood, and even some metals. Though his human body requires corrective lenses, Langkowski&#x27;s vision as Sasquatch was better than human. He also heals with unnatural speed, as demonstrated when Walt&#x27;s arm, broken by Super-Skrull, healed when he changed into Sasquatch.

As Walt Samson, he has all the powers of Doc Samson.

Early in his career, switching between forms at will caused Langkowski considerable physical discomfort. To alleviate the pain, he recited a mantra while focusing on his body. However, after many months of practice, he could effect the transformations with relative ease, without the need for meditative yoga. He does not transform as Walt Samson.

Langkowski is a professionally trained scientist with knowledge of both physics and biophysics. He has experience dealing with many forms of experimental radiation and their mutagenic properties on lifeforms under controlled settings. As a former football player, Langkowski has athletic strength and endurance, though he is no longer in peak condition. Sasquatch also has learned some combat skills, although he relies chiefly on brute force.

==Other characters named Sasquatch==
===Sasquatch race===
A race of Sasquatches were discovered to live in the forests of British Columbia. They are first seen in &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; vol. 2 #1. Once a year, the Sasquatches gather at the City of Sasquatches in secret, where they worship their forgotten gods and breed with one another.

One Sasquatch named Murkfoot that lived in the 1000s was the Sorcerer Supreme and a member of the Avengers of 1,000 AD.

===Sasquatch II===
One of these Sasquatches, a barely intelligent monster, is mistaken by Langkowski&#x27;s teammates to be a highly degenerated Langkowski, but it was an actual Bigfoot that had been captured by Department H. He is kept in control by the touch of the superpowered Murmur, though not always successfully. This Sasquatch dies in a conflict with Department H&#x27;s corrupt leadership and the Zodiac.

===Howling Commandos&#x27; Sasquatch===
Another Sasquatch appears in the 2005–2006 &quot;Nick Fury&#x27;s Howling Commandos&quot; series as a member of that titular group. What, if any, connection this character has to Walter Langkowski or the Sasquatch from &quot;Alpha Flight&quot; volume 2, is not revealed. He is first seen helping the Abominable Snowman to track down Groot.

==Other versions==
Versions of Sasquatch that differ from the familiar one usually seen in mainstream Marvel continuity have been seen in various story lines. Some of these involve incarnations of the character that appear in the same storylines as the prime version of the character, while others are seen in story lines set in alternate timelines or dimensions.

===Doppelganger===
A doppelganger of Sasquatch was created by Magus in &quot;Infinity War&quot; #1 and appeared in &quot;Infinity War&quot; #1, 5, &quot;Fantastic Four&quot; #369-370 and &quot;Wonder Man&quot; vol. 2 #15.

===Exiles===
A white-haired entity who appears to be Walter Langowski joins the Exiles, an interdimensional team of heroes dedicated to fixing breaks in the timeline. It is soon revealed that she is a black woman named Heather Hudson, shocking the team who are familiar with versions of Walter.

===Marvel Zombies===
In the &quot;Marvel Zombies&quot; comics set in the universe of Earth-2149, the zombified Alpha Flight attack the X-Men and are eventually killed by Magneto. Sasquatch is seen in a panel of Marvel Zombies Dead Days attacking the X-Man Wolverine. He is killed alongside the rest of zombie Alpha Flight by Magneto in the next panel.

===Old Man Logan===
In the possible future timeline seen in the second &quot;Old Man Logan&quot; ongoing series, it is revealed that Sasquatch and his fellow Alpha Flight members were killed by unknown villain opponents when the supervillain uprising had occurred. Old Man Logan experiences this illusion while he and Puck are taking part in a rescue mission on a space station that was attacked by the Brood.

===Ultimate Marvel===
An Ultimate Marvel version of Sasquatch is referenced as being killed off-panel by a hunter during the &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot; arc &quot;Shock and Awe&quot;. Sasquatch makes an appearance in the first part of the &quot;Ultimate X-Men&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Absolute Power&quot; arc as a member of Alpha Flight. This Sasquatch, more savage than the 616 version, appears to know Rogue and to have experienced her powers firsthand, though Rogue does not recognize the character. The character is later revealed to be Rahne Sinclair, under the influence of the power-enhancing drug Banshee that enabled her to assume a Bigfoot-like form. She is injured by Nightcrawler, who accidentally removes part of her arm while trying to teleport her away.

===What If?===
Sasquatch appears in some &quot;What If&quot; stories:

* In &quot;What If? Logan Battled Weapon X&quot;, Walter Langkowski is shown working with James McDonald Hudson as a scientist in Department H. He is killed off-panel by the man who was captured and laced with adamantium instead of Logan. It was never stated whether or not this Langkowski had become Sasquatch at the time of his death.
* Langkowski appears as Sasquatch in &quot;What If? Wolverine Was the Leader of Alpha Flight&quot;. He fights under Wolverine&#x27;s lead in battles with Annihilus and the Hellfire Club.

==In other media==
===Television===

* Sasquatch appears in the &quot;X-Men: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;Repo Man&quot;, voiced by Harvey Atkin. This version is a member of Alpha Flight.
* Walter Langkowski / Sasquatch appears in &quot;The Incredible Hulk&quot; episode &quot;Man to Man, Beast to Beast&quot;, voiced by Peter Strauss and Clancy Brown respectively. This version is an old friend of Bruce Banner who is unable to return to human form following his transformation into the Sasquatch. After battling the Hulk, he exiles himself to the wilderness when his actions endanger the Hulk&#x27;s friend, a small boy named Taylor.

<text>The Blade is the ninth studio album by the English band Sol Invictus, released in 1997. It continues the classical instrumentation established on the band&#x27;s preceding album, &quot;In the Rain&quot; (1995), but adds more martial drums and electric guitar. The frontman Tony Wakeford brought in two classically trained musicians, Eric Roger on trumpet and cornet and Matt Howden on violin, with whom he had worked in his other band L&#x27;Orchestre Noir.

==Reception==
Cesare Buttaboni and Marco De Baptistis of &quot;&quot; said the first half of the album is interesting and the second is &quot;gorgeous&quot;, highlighting the tracks &quot;The House Above the World&quot;, &quot;Laws and Crowns&quot; and &quot;See How We Fall&quot;.

<doc id="1081644" wikidata="Q13405536" url="?curid=1081644" title="Quill drive">
<text>A quill drive is a mechanism that allows a drive shaft to shift its position (either axially, ly, or both) relative to its driving shaft. It consists of a hollow driving shaft (the quill) with a driven shaft inside it. The two are connected in some fashion which permits the required motion.

==Examples==

===Drill press===
One example of a quill drive is found in a drill press where the quill allows the chuck to move vertically while being driven rotationally.

===Railroad locomotive===
Quill drives have been extensively used in railroad electric locomotives to connect between frame-mounted traction motors and the driven wheels. The two are linked by a flexible drive which allows a degree of radial motion and possibly a small amount of axial motion. This allows the motors to be mounted on top of the suspension system, moving independently of the wheels. This smooths the drive from the motors and isolates them from mechanical shock. This also decreases the unsprung weight borne directly by the wheels, thus decreasing wear on the track.

Quill drives were used by many electric locomotives in the United States, particularly those of the Pennsylvania Railroad—their long-lasting GG1 design being perhaps the best known. Many locomotives built in France, Germany, Italy and Poland used quill drives as well, allowing higher locomotive speed. The English Electric–built NZR ED class used a quill drive, but was found to be hard on the track.

<doc id="1081645" wikidata="Q5326818" url="?curid=1081645" title="Early history of Thailand">
<text>The known early history of Thailand begins with the earliest major archaeological site at Ban Chiang. Dating of artifacts from this site is controversial, but there is a consensus that at least by 3600 BCE, inhabitants had developed bronze tools and had begun to cultivate wet rice, providing the impetus for social and political organisation.

Later, Malay, Mon, and Khmer civilisations flourished in the region prior to the domination of the Thais, most notably the kingdom of Srivijaya in the south, the Dvaravati kingdom in central Thailand, and the Khmer Empire based at Angkor.

The Thai are part of a larger ethno-linguistic group known as the Tai, a group which includes the Lao, the people of the Shan region of northeastern Burma, the Zhuang people of Guangxi Province in China and the Thổ people and Nùng people of northern Vietnam. Migrations from southern China to Southeast Asia took place primarily during the first millennium CE, most likely via northern Laos.

During the first millennium CE the Tai peoples were loosely organised in small entities known as &quot;muang&quot;. They were heavily influenced by the more advanced cultures around them: the Khmer to the east, and the Hindu cultures of India to the west. Most of the Tai were converted to a form of Hinduism, traces of which can still be seen in Thai religious practice today. Between the 6th and 9th centuries CE, Buddhism was introduced into the Tai-speaking lands, probably via Burma, and became the dominant religion. The Theravada Buddhism now practised in Thailand was introduced by missionaries from Sri Lanka in the 13th century.

&quot;Phongsawadannuea&quot; (&quot;Chronicle of the North&quot;) is a historical record of this period. The date of its first compilation is unknown, but its content stretches from 500 CE down to the early 11th century. The recent edition was compiled in early Rattanakosin period.
