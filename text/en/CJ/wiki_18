<text>Wafer testing is a step performed during semiconductor device fabrication after back end of line (BEOL) and before IC packaging. 

Two types of testing are typically done. Very basic wafer parametric tests (WPT) are performed at a few locations on each wafer to ensure the wafer fabrication process has been carried out successfully. Discrete test structures are provided for WPT to test parameters like transistor threshold voltage or gain, interconnect resistance, capacitance, diodes, etc. Considerable information about device performance is obtained from WPT using structured typically provided in the scribe lines.
After WPT, all individual integrated circuits on the wafer are given extensive wafer functional testing (WFT) (also called die sort) by applying special test patterns. The testers used for WFT are typically quite expensive (see Teradyne for an example of a semiconductor test system). The WFT &quot;yield&quot; is recognized as the key test in determining the economic outcome of the entire fabrication process.

==Wafer prober==
Both WPT and WFT are performed using a wafer handler called a wafer prober. The wafer prober brings an array of microscopic needles or probes called a probe card into electrical contact with the wafer (vacuum-mounted on a wafer chuck). WPT and WFT use different probe cards, the WFT card contacts a chip&#x27;s bond pads. After each test the prober moves the wafer to the next testing location. The wafer prober is responsible for loading and unloading the wafers from their carrier (or cassette) and is equipped with automatic pattern recognition optics capable of aligning the wafer with sufficient accuracy to ensure accurate registration between the contact pads on the wafer and the tips of the probes.

==Testing==
When all test patterns pass for a specific die, its position is remembered for later use during IC packaging. Historically, non-passing circuits were marked with a small dot of ink in the middle of the die, today this information is stored in a file, named a wafermap. This wafermap is then sent to the die attachment process which then only selects good dies. When ink dots were used, vision systems on subsequent die handling equipment recognized the ink dot. For today&#x27;s multi-die packages such as stacked chip-scale package (SCSP) or system in package (SiP) – the development of non-contact (RF) probes for identification of known tested die (KTD) and known good die (KGD) are critical to increasing overall system yield.

In some specific cases, a chip that passes some but not all tests can still be used as a product with limited functionality. The most common example of this is a memory chip for which only one part of the memory is functional. In this case, the chip can sometimes still be sold as a lower cost part with a smaller amount of memory. In other specific cases, a defective chip may be repaired (e.g. by laser repair) using redundant spare circuitry. 

After IC packaging, a packaged chip will be tested again during the IC testing phase, usually with the same or very similar tests and tester as for WFT. For this reason, it may be thought that WFT is an unnecessary, redundant step. This is not usually the case, since the removal of defective dies saves the considerable cost of packaging faulty devices. However, when WFT yield is so high that wafer testing is more expensive than the packaging cost of defect devices, the wafer testing step can be skipped altogether and chips undergo blind assembly.

<text>Sing Sing Death House is the second studio album by the American punk rock band The Distillers, released in 2002 on Hellcat Records. The song &quot;Seneca Falls&quot; was featured in the game &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 4&quot; and is a reference to the Seneca Falls Convention of 1848.

==Recording and production==
&quot;Sing Sing Death House&quot; was recorded in a week. Production was rushed as the band was supposed to have the album completed within two weeks. However, after their engineer disappeared during the recording sessions, the band was forced to rush the album to meet deadlines. Following its completion, Epitaph delayed its release for nine months.

==Composition and lyrics==
The lyrics on &quot;Sing Sing Death House&quot; are more direct than on the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album. This came about due to criticism of the album&#x27;s nonsensical lyrics in a review written by &quot;The&quot; &quot;Village Voice&quot;, which greatly affected Brody. Brody called the review &quot;scathing and hilarious and life-altering&quot;, but was grateful for the review&#x27;s honesty. 

==Critical reception==
Andrew Bregman from AllMusic noted the album is &quot;a story with an uncharacteristic ending that punks born of squalor can rise up and create music as impassioned and relatively positive as this&quot;, also calling it &quot;authentic&quot;. In a 2003 piece called &quot;Bands to Watch,&quot; Tim Kenneally from &quot;Spin&quot; wrote, &quot;the band conjures the spirit of ’77 with razor-bladeriffery while [Brody] shouts about urban blight, school shootings, and her troubled youth&quot;.

<text>Johnny Clarke (born 12 January 1955) is a Jamaican reggae musician, best known for his recordings with producer Bunny Lee in the 1970s.

==Biography==
Clarke grew up in the Kingston ghetto of Whitfield Town and attended Jamaica College. In 1971 he won a talent contest in Bull Bay, his prize a meeting with producer Clancy Eccles, with whom he recorded his first song, &quot;God Made the Sea and the Sun&quot;, the following year. The single didn&#x27;t sell well, and disappointed with the lack of promotion from Eccles, he moved on to Rupie Edwards, who produced Clarke&#x27;s first hits in 1973, with &quot;Everyday Wondering&quot; and &quot;Julie&quot;. In 1974, Clarke moved on again, recording &quot;Jump Back Baby&quot; for Glen Brown, before beginning a long association with Bunny Lee and his band The Aggrovators in 1974. &quot;None Shall Escape the Judgement&quot; was an immediate success and became the title track on Clarke&#x27;s debut album. 

Clarke was named Artist of the Year in Jamaica in both 1975 and 1976, and became one of the most popular singers on the island, mixing original songs with covers of popular reggae songs by other artists, and mixing roots and lovers-themed material. Many of Clarke&#x27;s songs concern his faith as a Rasta and the beliefs of the Rastafari movement, including anti-violence (as on &quot;Let Go Violence&quot;) and legalization of marijuana (&quot;Legalize It&quot;). He helped define the &quot;Flying Cymbals&quot; period that preceded the &quot;Roots Rockers&quot; sound of the mid- to late 1970s. Clarke was one of the first Jamaican artists signed to Virgin Records&#x27; Frontline subsidiary in 1976, releasing the albums &quot;Authorized Version&quot; and &quot;Rockers Time Now&quot; on the label. Clarke enjoyed further hits in the early 1980s with producer S Douglas, before working again with Lee. His popularity in Jamaica, however, declined, and he relocated to London in 1983, recording with Mad Professor, as well as further recordings for Jamaican producers King Tubby, Errol Thompson, and Prince Jammy. He has since occasionally reappeared with new material - &quot;Rasta Nuh Fear&quot; in 1992, and &quot;Rock With Me&quot; in 1997 - and continues to tour regularly. His song &quot;None Shall Escape the Judgement&quot; was featured on the Trojan roots compilations.

Clarke is known for his so-called &quot;African Roots&quot; or knee-length dreadlocks, which, when performing live, he frequently conceals inside a large hat. At the climax of his concert, he removes his hat, revealing his &quot;African Roots&quot; to the audience.

He set up his own Hit Machine label, his first album on the label being &quot;Jamaica 50 Johnny Clarke Sing Then Dub Them&quot;, released in 2012 to coincide with the 50th anniversary of Jamaican independence.

<text>Tochmarc Étaíne, meaning &quot;The Wooing of Étaín/Éadaoin&quot;, is an early text of the Irish Mythological Cycle, and also features characters from the Ulster Cycle and the Cycles of the Kings. It is partially preserved in the manuscript known as the &quot;Lebor na hUidre&quot; (c. 1106), and completely preserved in the &quot;Yellow Book of Lecan&quot; (c. 1401), written in language believed to date to the 8th or 9th century. It tells of the lives and loves of Étaín, a beautiful mortal woman of the Ulaid, and her involvement with Aengus and Midir of the Tuatha Dé Danann. It is frequently cited as a possible source text for the Middle English Sir Orfeo. Harvard professor Jeffrey Gantz describes the text as displaying the &quot;poetic sense of law&quot; in Irish legal society.

==The story==

Although the manuscript evidence is not entirely clear on this, the editors Best and Bergin have divided &quot;Tochmarc Étaíne&quot; (&quot;TE&quot;) into three subtales, &quot;TE I&quot; (§§ 10), &quot;TE II&quot; (§§ 11-14) and &quot;TE III&quot; (§§ 14-26).

===&quot;TE I&quot;===

# The story begins with the conception of Aengus by the Dagda and Boand, wife of Elcmar. Aengus is fostered by Midir, and when he grows up takes possession of Brug na Boinne from Elcmar.
# Midir visits Aengus, but is blinded by a sprig of holly thrown by boys playing the Brug, and after he has been healed by the physician Dian Cecht, he demands compensation from Aengus: among other things, the hand of the most beautiful woman in Ireland. He has already identified this woman: Étaín, daughter of Ailill, king of the Ulaid. To win her for Midir, Aengus has to perform various tasks for Ailill, including clearing plains and diverting rivers, as well pay her weight in gold and silver. Midir takes Étaín as his wife.
# However, Midir&#x27;s first wife, Fúamnach, out of jealousy, turns her into a pool of water, out of which, as it evaporates, emerges a beautiful purple fly. Midir knows the fly is Étaín, and she accompanies him wherever he goes. But Fúamnach conjures up a storm which blows the fly away, and she drifts for seven years before landing on Aengus&#x27;s clothing, exhausted. Aengus makes her a crystal bower which he carries around with him, until she returns to health. Fuamnach conjures up another storm and blows her away from Aengus, and after another seven years she lands in a golden cup in the hand of the wife of Étar, a warrior of the Ulaid, in the time of Conchobar mac Nessa. Étar&#x27;s wife drinks from the cup, swallows the fly, and becomes pregnant. Étaín is reborn, 1,012 years after her first birth. Meanwhile, Aengus hunts down Fúamnach and cuts off her head.

===&quot;TE II&quot;===

The High King of Ireland, Eochu Airem, seeks a wife, because the provincial kings will not submit to a king with no queen. He sends messengers to find the most beautiful woman in Ireland, and they find Étaín. He falls in love with her and marries her, but his brother Ailill also falls for her, and wastes away with unrequited love. Eochu leaves Tara on a tour of Ireland, leaving Étaín with the dying Ailill, who tells her the cause of his sickness, which he says would be cured if she gave the word. She tells him she wants him to be well, and he begins to get better, but says the cure will only be complete if she agrees to meet him on the hill above the house, so as not to shame the king in his own house. She agrees to do so three times, but each time she goes to meet him, she in fact meets Midir, who has put Ailill to sleep and taken his appearance. On the third occasion Midir reveals his identity and tells Étaín who he really is, but she does not know him. She finally agrees to go with him, but only if Eochu agrees to let her go.

===&quot;TE III&quot;===

Later, after Ailill has fully recovered and Eochu has returned home, Midir comes to Tara and challenges Eochu to play &quot;fidchell&quot;, an ancient Irish board game, with him. They play for ever increasing stakes. Eochu keeps winning, and Midir has to pay up. One such game compels Midir to build a causeway across the bog of Móin Lámrige: the Corlea Trackway, a wooden causeway built across a bog in County Longford, dated by dendrochronology to 148 BC, is a real-life counterpart to this legendary road. Finally, Midir suggests they play for a kiss and an embrace from Étaín, and this time he wins. Eochu tells Midir to come back in a year for his winnings, and gathers his best warriors at Tara to prepare for his return. Despite the heavy guard, Midir appears inside the house. Eochu agrees that Midir may embrace Étaín, but when he does, the pair fly away through the skylight, turning into swans as they do so.

Eochu instructs his men to dig up every &quot;síd&quot; (fairy-mound) in Ireland until his wife is returned to him. Finally, when they set to digging at Midir&#x27;s &quot;síd&quot; at Brí Léith, Midir appears and promises to give Étaín back. But at the appointed time, Midir brings fifty women, who all look alike, and tells Eochu to pick which one is Étaín. He chooses the woman he thinks is his wife, takes her home and sleeps with her. She becomes pregnant and bears him a daughter. Later, Midir appears and tells him that Étaín had been pregnant when he took her, and the woman Eochu had chosen was his own daughter, who had been born in Midir&#x27;s &quot;síd&quot;. Out of shame, Eochu orders the daughter of their incestuous union to be exposed, but she is found and brought up by a herdsman and his wife, and later marries Eochu&#x27;s successor Eterscél and becomes the mother of the High King Conaire Mór (in &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot; she is named as Mess Búachalla and is the daughter of Étaín and Eochu Feidlech). The story ends with Eochu&#x27;s death at the hands of Sigmall Cael, Midir&#x27;s grandson.

==Influence==
The chivalric romance &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot;, retelling the story of Orpheus as a king rescuing his wife from the fairy king, shows so many motifs in common with this tale that it appears to have been a major influence on Sir Orfeo.

<doc id="1085153" wikidata="Q1237901" url="?curid=1085153" title="Richard Burke (Irish politician)">
<text>Richard Burke (29 March 1932 – 15 March 2016) was an Irish Fine Gael politician who served as European Commissioner for Interinstitutional Relations and Administration from 1982 to 1985, European Commissioner for Taxation, Consumer Affairs, Transport and Parliamentary Relations from 1977 to 1981 and Minister for Education from 1973 to 1976. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1969 to 1976 and from 1981 to 1982.

==Early life and education==
Burke was born in Brooklyn, New York City, in 1932. He was raised in Upperchurch, County Tipperary, and educated at the Christian Brothers School, Thurles. He went on to study at University College Dublin (UCD) and King&#x27;s Inns. He worked as a teacher before embarking on a political career.

==Political career==
His first political involvement was with the Christian Democrat Party founded by Seán Loftus. However, he soon became a member of Fine Gael, becoming a member of Dublin County Council in 1967. Two years later, in 1969, he was elected to Dáil Éireann for the first time, becoming a TD for Dublin County South. He was immediately appointed Fine Gael Chief Whip by party leader Liam Cosgrave.

In 1973, a new Fine Gael–Labour Party coalition government was formed, and Burke was appointed Minister for Education. He joined the Taoiseach, Liam Cosgrave, in voting against the government&#x27;s own Control of Importation, Sale and Manufacture of Contraceptives Bill 1974. In December 1976, he was nominated as Ireland&#x27;s European Commissioner, chosen ahead of fellow minister Justin Keating of Labour to succeed Patrick Hillery, who returned to become President of Ireland. Burke resigned his seat in the Dáil in January 1977 to take up his position.

He took office in the Jenkins Commission as commissioner for taxation, consumer affairs, transport. On the completion of his four-year term as a European commissioner, he accepted an invitation to stand at the 1981 general election for Fine Gael in June, on returning to Ireland from Harvard University after his fellowship year at Leverett House from 1980 to 1981. He was elected a TD for Dublin West.

However, Burke was not appointed to the short-lived cabinet of Garret FitzGerald. At the February 1982 election, he retained his seat, but Fine Gael lost office. Charles Haughey formed a minority Fianna Fáil government with the support of independent deputies. Haughey&#x27;s government nominated Burke for acceptance by the European Council and European Parliament as a European commissioner, avoiding a depletion of the government&#x27;s numbers. Being appointed for the second time his seniority resulted in his nomination as a vice-president of the Commission.

==Later life and death==
After Burke left politics at the Irish and European levels, he became president and chief executive officer of the Stichting Canon Foundation in Europe, roles he held until his retirement in 1998.

Burke married Mary in 1968, and they had six children. Burke died on 15 March 2016 in Dublin. He was predeceased by his son Joseph.

<doc id="1085154" wikidata="Q2448434" url="?curid=1085154" title="The Line of Beauty">
<text>The Line of Beauty is a 2004 Man Booker Prize-winning novel by Alan Hollinghurst.

==Plot==
The novel is set in Britain in three parts, taking place in 1983, 1986 and 1987. The story surrounds the young gay protagonist, Nick Guest. Nick is middle-class and from the fictional market town of Barwick in Northamptonshire; he has graduated from Worcester College, Oxford with a First in English and is to begin postgraduate studies at University College London. Many of the significant characters in the novel are Nick&#x27;s male contemporaries from Oxford.

The book explores the tension between Nick&#x27;s intimate relationship with the Fedden family, in whose parties and holidays he participates, and the realities of his sexuality and gay life, which the Feddens accept only to the extent of never mentioning it. It explores themes of hypocrisy, privilege, drugs, and homosexuality, with the emerging AIDS crisis forming a backdrop to the book&#x27;s conclusion.

===&quot;The Love Chord&quot; (1983)===
The novel begins in the summer of 1983, shortly after Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s second victory in the general election. Nick moves into the luxurious Notting Hill home of the Fedden family. The Feddens&#x27; son, Toby, is Nick&#x27;s Oxford University classmate on whom he has a secret crush. Nick&#x27;s stay is meant to last for a short time while Toby and his parents—Rachel, the daughter of an extremely wealthy Rothschild-like Jewish family, and Gerald, a successful businessman and just-elected Conservative MP for Barwick—are at their holiday home in France. Left at home with Nick is the Feddens&#x27; daughter Catherine whom the Feddens are reluctant to leave on her own because of her history of self-harming. Nick helps Cat through a crisis when she considers cutting herself, and when her parents return they suggest he stay on indefinitely, since Cat has become attached to him and Toby is moving into his own place.

Nick dates Leo Charles, a black man from Willesden in his late 20s, whom he meets through a lonely hearts column. As Leo lives with his religious mother and Nick feels restricted in the Fedden household, the two conduct their sexual affair almost entirely outside in public parks and side streets.

Leo also introduces Nick to Pete, his middle-aged former lover who runs an antiques shop, like Nick&#x27;s father, and who is sickly.

===&quot;To Whom Do You Beautifully Belong?&quot; (1986)===
Having never moved out, Nick is now a permanent member of the Fedden household. He spends most of his time with Wani Ouradi, one of his Oxford contemporaries, the son of a rich Lebanese businessman. Despite the fact that Nick is openly gay, Wani appears to have a female fiancée and remains closeted, so their relationship is kept secret. Though Nick is finishing his doctorate on Henry James, he spends most of his time living a decadent lifestyle of drugs and sex with Wani who lavishes him with money and expensive gifts. To cover their relationship Wani pretends Nick is helping him write a screenplay of &quot;The Spoils of Poynton&quot; as well as helping him establish &quot;Ogee&quot;, a luxury magazine Wani wants to create.

Nick discovers by accident that Gerald is having an affair with his assistant, Penny, which disturbs his view of the Feddens.

Catherine has now been diagnosed as being bipolar and is on lithium, which helps to control her mood swings. She realizes that Nick is having an affair with Wani when the two of them spend time at the Feddens&#x27; French country home.

A party is thrown for Rachel and Gerald&#x27;s 25th wedding anniversary. Nick meets Margaret Thatcher for the first time and, high on coke, asks her to dance, which she accepts.

===&quot;The End of the Street&quot; (1987)===
In 1987 on election day Nick goes to vote and does not vote for the Conservative candidate but a member of the Green party. He is visited by Leo&#x27;s sister at the Ogee office where he learns that Leo died a few weeks before of AIDS and his sister is trying to warn all his former lovers. Nick spends election night at home alone with Catherine. Nick watches as his former gay university friend Polly is elected an MP at 28 and Gerald barely scrapes back in his seat.
He later has a working lunch with two possible gay film investors. Wani arrives late. He has AIDS and is wasting away. Wani offers to leave Nick some property that he owns as it will ensure Nick&#x27;s financial security for the rest of his life. He also warns Nick that a scandal over improperly managed funds will soon be breaking around Gerald.

Going home Nick finds that the scandal has already broken. A boisterous Cat, now overly energetic thanks to her medication, has Nick drive her to a location where they find Penny and Gerald together. Cat exposes their affair, which forces Gerald to resign as an MP and causes resentment between Rachel and Nick, where Rachel blames Nick for her own lack of responsibility regarding Cat, and contends Nick never truly understood that his role was to take care of Catherine, not indulge her.

Shortly after, the press (who have been camped outside the Feddens&#x27; home), publish a story on Wani and Nick, causing greater scandal. Gerald uses Nick as a scapegoat and accuses him of attaching himself to the family and then wrecking them because of his homosexuality.

Nick goes to live with Wani and views the first and final issue of &quot;Ogee&quot;. He goes back to the Feddens&#x27; house to collect his things, knowing they are absent for a wedding, and runs into Penny, who reveals that she is going to continue her affair with Gerald. Nick leaves the Feddens&#x27; house for the final time, and muses on the HIV test he is having done the next day, which he imagines will be positive.

==Title==
The title of the book refers to the Line of Beauty — the double &quot;S&quot; of the ogee shape, a shape which &quot;swings both ways&quot;. William Hogarth, in his 1753 book &quot;The Analysis of Beauty&quot;, describes how beauty itself is embodied in the shape, which protagonist Nick Guest uses to describe Wani&#x27;s body. In contrast, other characters describe lines of cocaine as &quot;beautiful&quot;. Nick also describes being motivated by beauty for its own sake, a character trait that the other characters cannot relate to.

==Major themes==
The book touches upon the emergence of HIV/AIDS, as well as the relationship between politics and homosexuality, and its ambivalent acceptance within the 1980s Conservative Party and mainstream society. The book also considers heterosexual hypocrisy regarding homosexual promiscuity. Finally, an underlying theme is the nature of beauty. Nick is attracted to physical beauty in art and in men. However, he pays a price for his choices: his beautiful lover Wani is a self-hating homosexual, and the Feddens&#x27; home (in which Nick Guest remains a guest) is filled with both exquisite art and vile hypocrisy. The novel also deals with the &quot;coming out&quot; experience of Nick and of gay men in general.

The novel explores the question of whether a gay man can remain apolitical in a homophobic society. Nick&#x27;s dance with Margaret Thatcher has overtones of a dance with the devil.

Social and economic classes are also a major theme: Nick envies the house, connections and mannerism of the Fedden family. It is made particularly apparent when the Fedden and Nick visit Toby&#x27;s aristocratic uncle, who owns several rare pieces of furniture and books. Nick acknowledges the value of those objects because his father is an antiquarian. He is happy to see the furniture as a visitor, a friend of the family, and not as the son of a merchant.

The book refers frequently to the life and works of Henry James.

===Critical Reception===
Upon release, &quot;The Line of Beauty&quot; was generally well-received among the British press. &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; reported on reviews from several publications with a rating scale for the novel out of &quot;Love It&quot;, &quot;Pretty Good&quot;, &quot;Ok&quot;, and &quot;Rubbish&quot;: &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Times&quot;, &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Observer&quot;, &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, &quot;Independent On Sunday&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, and &quot;Spectator&quot; reviews under &quot;Love It&quot; and &quot;Independent&quot; and &quot;Literary Review&quot; reviews under &quot;Pretty Good&quot; and &quot;Guardian&quot; and &quot;TLS&quot; reviews under &quot;Ok&quot;. According to Book Marks, primarily from American press, the book received a &quot;rave&quot; consensus, based on 11 critics: 8 &quot;rave&quot;, 1 &quot;positive&quot;, and 2 &quot;mixed&quot;. On Metacritic, the book received a 89 out of 100 based on 22 critic reviews, indicating &quot;universal acclaim&quot;. In the January/February 2005 issue of &quot;Bookmarks&quot;, the book was scored four out of five. The magazine&#x27;s critical summary reads: &quot;Small criticisms, really—this book is deserving of the Booker&quot;.

Hollinghurst has received praise for his portrayal of life among the privileged governing classes during the early to middle 1980s. The novel has been compared to Anthony Powell&#x27;s &quot;A Dance to the Music of Time&quot;, with special regard to Powell&#x27;s character Nicholas Jenkins. The protagonist has also been likened to Nick Carraway in F. Scott Fitzgerald&#x27;s &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;. James Wood, writing for &quot;The New Republic&quot;, praised the novel, calling it &quot;an ample and sophisticated delight, charged with hundreds of delicate impressions and insights, and scores of vital and lovely sentences&quot;, although he criticized the ending as a &quot;somewhat trite and anachronistic vision of the homosexual as a figure always doomed to be unhoused and exiled from happiness, solitary and lonely, without family or friends, always nostalgic for a bosom that has always, if only secretly, rejected him.&quot;

Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s appearance has been compared to that of Kurtz in Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;; Sir Maurice Tipper and his wife have been compared to Evelyn Waugh characters.

===Awards and Lists===
The book continued to receive acclaim among many critics lists. According to &quot;The Greatest Books&quot;, a site that aggregates book lists, it is &quot;The 867th greatest book of all time&quot;. The book won the 2004 Man Booker Prize. In 2019, the novel was ranked 38th on &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s list of the 100 best books of the 21st century.

==Television adaptation==
In 2006, a three-part television adaptation was broadcast by the BBC, and later released on DVD. Dan Stevens plays Nick Guest, with Oliver Coleman as Toby, Alice Krige as Rachel, and Tim McInnerny as Gerald.

<text>Uch (;
), frequently referred to as Uch Sharīf (; 
; &quot;Noble Uch&quot;), is a historic city in the Pakistan&#x27;s Punjab province. Uch may have been founded as Alexandria on the Indus, a town founded by Alexander the Great during his invasion of the Indus Valley. Uch was an early stronghold of the Delhi Sultanate during the Muslim conquest of the subcontinent. It is also known as the home for the Naqvi/Bukhari&#x27;s after the migration from Bukhara. Uch was a regional metropolitan centre between the 12th and 17th centuries, and became refuge for Muslim religious scholars fleeing persecution from other lands. Though Uch is now a relatively small city, it is renowned for its intact historic urban fabric, and for its collection of shrines dedicated to Muslim mystics (Sufis) from 12th to 15th centuries that are embellished with extensive tile work, and were built in the distinct architectural style of southern Punjab.

== Etymology ==
Uch Sharif was previous known by the name of &quot;Bhatiah&quot; until the 12th century. The origins of the city&#x27;s current name are unclear. In one legend, Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari, the renowned Central Asian Sufi mystic from Bukhara, arrived in Uch and converted the daughter of the town&#x27;s ruler, &quot;Sunandapuri.&quot; Upon her conversion, Jalaluddin Bukhari requested her to build a fortress which he named &quot;Uch,&quot; or &quot;High.&quot; According to another version of the legend, the princess converted by Bukhari was actually a Buddhist princess named &quot;Ucha Rani&quot;, and the city&#x27;s name derives from her. In another version of that legend, &quot;Ucha Rani&quot;.
Uch was not universally recognized as the area&#x27;s name for quite some time, and the city was not referred to by early Muslim historians by the name Uch. Uch, for example, is likely the town recorded as &quot;Bhatia&quot; that was invaded by Mahmud of Ghazni in 1006.

==History==

=== Early ===
Uch Sharif may have been founded in 325 BCE by Alexander the Great as the city of Alexandria on the Indus (Greek: Ἀλεξάνδρεια ἡ ἐν Ἰνδῷ), according to British officer and archaeologist Alexander Cunningham. The city was reportedly settled by natives of the Greek region of Thrace, and was located at the confluence of the Acesines river with the Indus. Uch was once located on the banks of the Indus River, though the river has since shifted its course, and the confluence of the two rivers has shifted approximately 40 km (25 miles) southwest.

=== Medieval ===
In 712 CE, Muhammad bin Qasim conquered Uch. Few details exist of the city in the centuries prior to his invasion. Uch was probably the town recorded as &quot;Bhatia&quot; that was conquered in 1006 by Mahmud of Ghazni. Following the schism between the Nizari and Musta&#x27;li sects of Ismaili Shi&#x27;ism in 1094, Uch became a centre of Nizari missionary activity for several centuries, and today the town and surrounding region are littered with numerous tombs of prominent &quot;pīrs,&quot; as well as pious daughters and wives of those Sufi &quot;pirs.&quot;

The region around Uch and Multan remained centre of Hindu Vaishnavite and Surya pilgrimage throughout the medieval era. Their interactions with Ismaili tradition resulted in the creation of the &quot;Satpanth&quot; tradition. Throughout this era, Uch was at the centre of a region that was steeped in both Vedic and Islamic traditions. The city would later become a centre of &quot;Suhrwadi&quot; Sufism, with the establishment of the order by Bahauddin Zakariya in nearby Multan in the early 1200s.

Muhammad of Ghor conquered Uch and nearby Sultan in 1176 while it was still under the influence of the Ismaili Qarmatians. The town was likely captured from the Soomras based in Sindh. Sindh&#x27;s various dynasties had for centuries attempted to keep Uch and Multan under their sway.

=== Mamluk era ===
Soomra power was eroded by the advance of Nasir ad-Din Qabacha of what would later become the Mamluk dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. Qabacha was declared Governor of Uch in 1204, he also controlled Multan and Sindh regions. Under his rule, Uch became the principal city of Upper Sindh. Qabacha declared independence for his principality centred on Uch and Multan after the death of Sultan Aybak in 1211, before marching onwards to capture Lahore, thereby placing Qabacha&#x27;s new Uch Sultanate in conflict with Sultan Iltutmish in Delhi. Qabacha briefly lost control of Uch to Taj al-Din Yildiz, though Uch was quickly returned to Qabacha&#x27;s rule.

While the power struggle ensued among Qabacha and Iltuthmish, Uch came under further pressure from the Khwarazmian dynasty based in Samarkand that had been displaced by the Mongol armies of Genghis Khan. Following the defeat of his father by the Mongols in the mid 1210s, the last Khwarazmian Sultan, Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu, sacked and conquered Uch in 1224 after Qabacha refused to aid him in a campaign against Genghis Khan. Jalal ud Din Mingburnu was finally defeated by Genghis Khan in 1224 in a battle at Uch, and was forced to flee to Persia. Khan attacked Multan on his return to Iran in 1224, though Sultan Qabacha was able to successfully defend that city. Despite repeated invasions, the city remained a great centre of Muslim scholarship, as evidenced by the appointment of the renowned Persian historian Minhaj-i-Siraj as chief of the city&#x27;s &quot;Firozi&quot; madrasa.

In 1228, Qabacha&#x27;s forces, weakened by Mongol and Khwarazmian invasions, lost Uch to Sultan Iltutmish of Delhi, and fled south to Bhakkar in Sindh, where he was eventually captured and drowned in the Indus River as punishment. Following the collapse of Qabacha&#x27;s sultanate at the hands of Mongols and Khwarazmians, and the degradation of Lahore from years of conflict there, Muslim power in north India shifted away from Punjab and towards the safer environs of Delhi.

=== Mongol and Timurid invasions ===
One of Uch&#x27;s most celebrated saints, Jalaluddin Surkh-Posh Bukhari, migrated to Uch from Bukhara in 1244–45. In 1245–46, the Mongols again invaded Uch under Möngke Khan after receiving aid from the local Khokhar tribes. in 1252, forces from Delhi were sent to the region in order to secure Uch from Mongol raiders, though Uch was again raided in 1258. Uch was raided yet again by Mongols in 1304 and 1305. Following the 1305 invasion, Uch came under the governorship of Ghazi Malik the governor of Multan and Depalpur, who would later seize Delhi and come to be known as Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq, founder of the Tughlaq dynasty of the Delhi Sultanate. Uch was captured in 1398 by Pir Muhammad ibn Jahangir, grandson of Tamerlane, allowing Khizr Khan to regain control of the area, before joining with the forces of the elder Tamerlane to sack Delhi and establish the Sayyid dynasty in 1414.

=== &quot;Langah&quot; sultanate ===
Uch Sharif then came under the control of the Langah Sultanate in the early 15th century, founded in nearby Multan by Budhan Khan, who assumed the title Mahmud Shah. During the rule of Shah Husayn Langah, large numbers of Baloch settlers were invited to settle the region. The city was placed under the &quot;jagir&quot; governorship of a Samma prince. In the mid-1400s, Muhammad Ghaus Gilani, a descendant of the Persian saint Abdul Qadir Gilani, established a Khanqah monastery in Uch, thereby establishing the city as a centre of the &quot;Qadiriyya&quot; Sufi order which would later become the dominant order of Punjab. Following the death of Shah Husayn, Uch&#x27;s Samma rulers quickly allied themselves with Baloch chieftain Mir Chakar Rind.

=== Mughal ===
Guru Nanak, the founder of Sikhism, is believed to have visited Uch Sharif in the early 1500s, and left behind 5 relics, after meeting with the descendants of Jalaludin Bukhari. In 1525 Uch was invaded by rulers of the Arghun dynasty of northern Sindh, before falling to the forces of Pashtun king Sher Shah Suri in 1540.

Mughal Emperor Humayun entered Uch in late 1540, but was not welcomed by the city&#x27;s inhabitants, and was defeated by the forces of Sher Shah Suri. The city reverted to Arghun rule following the expulsion of Humayun, and the fall of Sher Shah Suri&#x27;s short-lived empire.

Uch Sharif became a part of the Mughal Empire during the reign of Akbar, and the city was a district of Multan province. Under Mughal rule, the city continued to flourish as a centre of religious scholarship. It was listed in the Ain-i-Akbari as a pargana in sarkar Multan, counted as part of the &quot;Bīrūn-i Panjnad&quot; (&quot;Beyond the Five Rivers&quot;). It was assessed at 1,910,140 dams in revenue and supplied a force of 100 cavalry and 400 infantry.

In 1680, the renowned Punjabi poet, Bulleh Shah, who is regarded as a saint by both Sufis and Sikhs, was born in Uch. In 1751, Uch was attacked by Sardar Jahan Khan, general in the army of Ahmad Shah Durrani.

=== Under the State of Bahawalpur ===

Uch Sharif came under the control of the Bahawalpur princely state, which declared independence in 1748 following the collapse of the Durrani empire. Bahawalpur had become a vassal of the Sikh Empire under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, before becoming a dependency of the British Empire defined under an 1833 treaty. By 1836, the ruling Abbasi family stopped paying tribute to the Sikhs, and declared independence. Bahawalpur&#x27;s ruling Abbasi family aligned themselves with the British during the First and Second Anglo-Sikh Wars, thereby guaranteeing its survival as a princely state.

Flooding in the early 19th century caused serious damage to many of the city&#x27;s tombs, including structural problems and the deterioration of masonry and finishes.

=== Modern ===
Upon the independence of Pakistan in 1947, Uch Sharif had a population of around 2–3,000 people. As part of Bahawalpur state, Uch Sharif was acceded to the new Pakistani state, but remained part of the autonomous Bahawalpur state until 1955 when it was fully amalgamated into Pakistan. Uch remains a relatively small city, but is an important tourist and pilgrimage destination on account of its numerous tombs and shrines.

== Demographics ==
The population of city in 1998 was 20,476 but according to the 2023 Census of Pakistan, the population has risen to 98,852.
==Geography==
Uch Sharif is located 84 km away from Bahawalpur. Formerly located at the confluence of the Indus and Chenab rivers, the river shifted course, and is now from that confluence, which has moved to Mithankot. The city now lies on a large Alluvial plain near south of the Chenab river. To the southeast lay the vast expanses of the Cholistan Desert.

Uch Sharif is located at an elevation of 113 meters above sea level. Latitude of 29.23895° or 29° 14&#x27; 20&quot; north and longitude 71.06148° or 71° 3&#x27; 41&quot; east.

=== Cityscape ===
Uch Sharif has retained much of its historic urban fabric intact. The historic town is divided into three localities: &quot;Uch Bukhari&quot;, named for the saints from Bukhara, &quot;Uch Gilani&quot; (or &quot;Uch Jilani&quot;), named for the saints from Persia, and &quot;Uch Mughlia&quot;, named for the descendants of Mongol invaders who had settled in that quarter. Monuments are scattered throughout the city, and are connected by narrow lanes and winding bazaars. The most notable collection, called the Uch Monument Complex, is located at the old city&#x27;s western edge. The old core is next to a large field used as a &quot;mela&quot; ground, or fair ground for &quot;urs&quot; festivals dedicated to the town&#x27;s saints.

===Climate===
Uch features an arid climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWh&quot;) with very hot summers and mild winters.

==Uch Monument Complex==

17 tiled funerary monuments and associated structures remain tightly knit into the urban fabric of Uch. The shrines, notably the tombs of Syed Jalaluddin Bukhari and his family, are built in a regional vernacular style particular to southern Punjab, with tile work imported from the nearby city of Multan. These structures were typically domed tombs on octagonal bases, with elements of Tughlaq military architecture, such as the addition of decorative bastions and crenellations.

Three shrines built over the course of 200 years are particularly well known, and along with an accompanying 1400 graves form the Uch Monument Complex, a site tentatively inscribed on the list of UNESCO World Cultural Heritage sites. Of the shrines, the first is said to have been built for Sheikh Baha’al-Halim by his pupil, the Suharwardiya Sufi saint Jahaniyan Jahangasht (1307–1383), the second for the latter&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Bibi Jawindi, in 1494, and the third for the latter&#x27;s architect.

Flooding in the early 19th century caused serious damage to many of the city&#x27;s tombs, including structural problems and the deterioration of masonry and finishes. As the problems have persisted, the Uch Monument Complex was listed in the 1998 World Monuments Watch by the World Monuments Fund, and again in 2000 and 2002. The Fund subsequently offered financial assistance for conservation from American Express. In 2018, the World Bank provided a $500 million loan to the Punjab Government to restore several historical monuments, including the Tomb of Bibi Jawindi.

<text>Eamon, sometimes known as The Wonderful World of Eamon, is a game creation system and a role-playing adventure game series created by Donald Brown and released for the Apple II in 1980. The game is a text adventure similar to other early titles like &quot;Adventure&quot; (1976) or &quot;Zork&quot; (1980) and to later text-based multi-user dungeons (MUDs), though with many role-playing elements not available in other interactive fiction. &quot;Eamon&quot; software is non-commercial and is freely available in the public domain.

== Premise ==
&quot;Eamon&quot; casts the player in the role of a free-wheeling fantasy adventurer who undertakes dangerous quests against numerous enemies to earn riches and experience. Home base is the Guild of Free Adventurers, an association of heroes on the mystical world of Eamon, a vaguely Medieval place awash in magic and populated with strange creatures. Most adventures take place in the dungeons, castles and forests of Eamon, though some occur on other worlds or in different eras. Eamon creator Donald Brown described Eamon as &quot;a world at the center of another galaxy—instead of revolving around any star, all of the stars revolve around it! Those huge bodies exert strange effects on the world of Eamon, bending light, gravity, time, even the laws of nature themselves!&quot;

Though influenced by such fantasy environments as &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;, &quot;Eamon&quot; generally avoids stories, situations or other game elements that are particularly serious or complex, instead seeking to create an engaging, genial mood through quick play and in-jokes. Individual adventures, created by a wide range of authors, vary from the artful to the campy.

Robert Clardy&#x27;s &quot;&quot; displays the same dragon artwork on its title screen as &quot;Eamon&quot;.

== Gameplay ==
Brown encouraged players to modify and add to &quot;Eamon&quot;, and published technical information on the game to assist them. &quot;Eamon&quot; is notable for being one of the first adventure games designed to be modular, with expansion packs written by users forming an integral part of the game experience. A master disk called the &quot;Main Hall&quot; is used to manage player characters and to facilitate their transfer between individual adventures. The character retains his or her attributes and statistics from adventure to adventure, as well as up to four weapons.
The game&#x27;s interface is similar to that of most other text adventures — the game presents the player with descriptions of the character&#x27;s surroundings, including events, artifacts, monsters and exits, then prompts the player to enter a command. These commands include such things as moving in certain directions (NORTH, EAST, UP, etc.), readying weapons, attacking, getting or dropping items, interacting with characters, casting magical spells or checking inventory.

=== Players ===
All player characters in &quot;Eamon&quot; possess a name, plus the three physical attributes of hardiness, agility and charisma in varying quantities. Hardiness affects how much a player can carry and how much damage he can both inflict and withstand. A strength of 12, for instance, allows the player to absorb 12 points of damage and lift 120 (a fictional unit of weight used in the game). Agility influences the player&#x27;s success using certain weapons and avoiding attacks, while charisma determines his ability to make friends and influences the prices he pays for supplies. Common attribute values for player characters are generally between 10 and 20.

Players also have varying abilities with five classes of weapons — axe, bow, club, spear or sword — expressed as a percentage. Scoring a hit in battle may increase the skill in the appropriate weapon class. An additional ability, &quot;armor expertise&quot;, determines the extent to which the player&#x27;s armor affects his chance to score a hit. The greater the expertise, the less the armor encumbers the player in combat. Players may wear leather, chain or plate armor, and can supplement this with a shield.

The final set of abilities describes the player&#x27;s aptitude with magic. A player can hire a wizard to teach him four magic spells: &quot;Blast&quot; (which damages enemies), &quot;Heal&quot; (which helps to restore health), &quot;Speed&quot; (which temporarily doubles agility) and &quot;Power&quot; (a spell with unpredictable results). Various other spells are sometimes available in particular adventures, but cannot be used outside them.

All players begin with 200 gold pieces, which can be used to purchase weapons, armor, spells or other supplies, or can be stored in the bank. One earns more by collecting treasure during adventures.

A player character may die while on an adventure, either as the result of losing a battle or from some other poor decision or mishap. Though death generally spells the end of the character and all his skills and possessions, there are utilities one can use to &quot;resurrect&quot; the player.

=== Monsters ===
All non-player characters in &quot;Eamon&quot;, regardless of their form or disposition, are referred to as &quot;monsters&quot;. The monsters that players must face depend on the style of the adventure and range from the conventional fantasy staples of dragons, goblins, orcs and wizards, to wild animals, zombies, mummies, ghosts, machines, other humans (both friendly and hostile) and many more.

Monsters share most of the same attributes as player characters. A key exception is that monsters have &quot;friendliness&quot; rather than charisma, a rating that along with the encountering player&#x27;s charisma determines how the monster will behave toward the player. Friendly monsters may accompany the player through the adventure and fight on the player&#x27;s behalf, while unfriendly ones may ignore or attack the player. Monsters also possess a &quot;courage&quot; attribute that determines how likely they are to flee from combat or pursue the player.

=== Adventures ===

At least 280 individual &quot;Eamon&quot; adventures have been written by various authors to work with the &quot;Eamon&quot; system. These adventures range from very simple, 20-room outings to complex works spanning multiple diskettes. With few exceptions, each adventure stands alone and does not depend on the user completing any others. Although a majority of the adventures are fantasy-themed, some adventures occupy contemporary or science fictional settings. Most adventures include some degree of customization, adding new commands or other special game features above and beyond those included in the base &quot;Eamon&quot; program.

== History ==
Creator Don Brown first released &quot;Eamon&quot; for non-commercial distribution on the Apple II in 1980, encouraging others to share and expand the game. All of &quot;Eamon&quot;&#x27;s fundamentals, including the original Main Hall, the first adventure design utilities and two manuals, were created by Brown, as were eight complete adventures. Brown subsequently left &quot;Eamon&quot; to develop a commercial version of the game entitled &quot;SwordThrust&quot;, but users continued creating and sharing adventures for the system.

=== Conversion to PC ===
In 1985, Jon Walker from Marshfield, Wisconsin converted Eamon to the PC and released several converted and new adventures. Eventually the disks were released through various shareware organizations and garnered a minor following. While the adventures attracted some modest interest, the direct conversion of the adventure creation program prompted much criticism among PC users for being too difficult to use and poorly written (the latter in later years by people who were probably never constrained by early versions of the BASIC language). By the time a serious attempt was made to upgrade the Eamon system to Foxbase, other adventures containing graphics and real time action were becoming popular and the project was scrapped. In 1997, an attempt was made to bring Eamon to the World Wide Web; however, the project never got beyond a beta version because of the rapid pace at which the web and content distribution was developing. The original PC GW-BASIC source code is almost impossible to find online anymore, and the author has only a few of the original disks archived on CD.

=== National Eamon User&#x27;s Club ===

After Don Brown&#x27;s departure, several &quot;Eamon&quot; enthusiasts in the Des Moines, Iowa area formed the National Eamon User&#x27;s Club (NEUC) which in March 1984 released the first issue of the club newsletter, named &quot;Eamon Adventurer&#x27;s Log&quot;. Published by &quot;Eamon&quot; author John Nelson, this newsletter supported the game community by providing information ranging from adventure reviews to programming design help.

In late 1987, the operations of the NEUC had slowed down to the point that only three newsletters were published in a two-year period. Nelson was interested in other pursuits including writing a PC version of &quot;Eamon&quot;. &quot;Eamon&quot; author Thomas Zuchowski assumed the responsibility of publishing an &quot;Eamon&quot; newsletter and started the Eamon Adventurer&#x27;s Guild (EAG). The NEUC shut down operations and transferred its assets to the EAG.

=== Eamon Adventurer&#x27;s Guild ===
Zuchowski published the &quot;Eamon Adventurer&#x27;s Guild Newsletter&quot; four times a year from June 1988 to January 2001. During this time, 94 additional games were published and the entire &quot;Eamon&quot; library was properly reviewed and documented.

The last &quot;Eamon&quot; adventure to be published with the EAG was announced in December 1997. By January 2001, Zuchowski had run out of new source material for his newsletter. The last issue of the EAG newsletter was published in January 2001. Efforts were made to ensure that &quot;Eamon&quot; would not disappear. Zuchowski created the &quot;Eamon CD&quot; which contains the entirety of &quot;Eamon&quot; resources available at the time. This CD was made available to the members of the EAG and the general public.

In April 2003, the Eamon Adventurer&#x27;s Guild Online website officially opened. This website provides the entire archive of &quot;Eamon&quot; resources including adventures, newsletters, maps, news articles, and documentation for the system, as well as a disk image of the &quot;Eamon CD&quot;. The existence of the website sparked a small revival in &quot;Eamon&quot; as ten new adventures have been published since the website was established.

=== Eamon Deluxe ===
In 1997, programmer Frank Black began work on &quot;Eamon Deluxe&quot;, an MS-DOS-based conversion of &quot;Eamon&quot; designed to add various enhancements and a more user-friendly interface for adventurers and creators alike while also retaining the flavor of the original Apple game. Black converted over half of the classic &quot;Eamon&quot; adventures to the &quot;Eamon Deluxe&quot; system and announced in 2012 that version 5.0 had been sent out for testing.

Version 5.0 is compatible with modern operating systems such as Windows 7 and Mac OS X using emulation software such as DOSBox and also includes a VI compatibility mode to make it more accessible to screen-reader programs used by visually impaired players. The converted adventures and latest updates remain non-commercial freeware and can be downloaded from the Eamon Adventurers Guild Online.

=== Eamon Remastered ===
In February 2017 the browser-based Eamon Remastered was released, making it possible to play Eamon online and save your progress between adventures. Currently, 39 adventures are available.

=== Eamon CS ===
In April 2017 Eamon CS was released by developer and adventure author Michael Penner. It is a version of Eamon ported to the C# programming language. It is playable on Windows, Android and Unix and continues to be developed and expanded. An iOS port is also planned.

<text>Đồng Khánh (, , lit. &quot;collective celebration&quot;; 19 February 1864 – 28 January 1889), born Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Kỷ (阮福膺祺) or Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Đường (阮福膺禟), also known as Chánh Mông (正蒙), was the ninth emperor of the Nguyễn dynasty of Vietnam. He reigned four years between 1885 and 1889. His royal temple name was Cảnh Tông (景宗).

==Biography==
Đồng Khánh was born on 19 February 1864 in the Imperial City of Huế. His childhood name was Chánh Mông because he was brought up in Chánh Mông palace. Đồng Khánh was the eldest son of Prince Nguyễn Phúc Hồng Cai, a son of emperor Thiệu Trị, and his concubine Bùi Thị Thanh.

As his uncle, Emperor Tự Đức, had no children, Đồng Khánh was adopted and given the title Kiên Giang quận công (Duke of Kiên Giang).

==Rule==
After the French armies captured the city of Huế and the Imperial city fell to the French, the court regents Nguyễn Văn Tường and Tôn Thất Thuyết took the young Emperor Hàm Nghi and escaped from the Purple Forbidden City of Huế, and took him to Tân Sở in the mountains as the figurehead of a revolutionary movement against the French. To take away the legitimacy of Hàm Nghi, general de Courcy and résident de Champeaux of France asked the empress dowager Nghi Thiên to enthrone Hàm Nghi&#x27;s elder half brother prince Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Kỷ. On 19 September 1885 with the backing of the governor of Annam, Prince Nguyễn Phúc Ưng Kỷ was crowned as the ninth emperor of Đại Nam with the era name of Đồng Khánh.

Đồng Khánh was pro-French, which was noted in the diary of Trần Trọng Kim:
==Death==
On 28 January 1889, Đồng Khánh died 
aged 24 after reigning for three years. He was granted the posthumous name Hoằng Liệt Thông Thiết Mẫn Huệ Thuần Hoàng Đế (弘烈聰哲敏惠純皇帝), with the temple name Cảnh Tông (景宗).

In 1916, his son the Emperor Khải Định granted him the name Phối Thiên Minh Vận Hiếu Đức Nhân Vũ Vĩ Công Hoằng Liệt Thông Thiết Mẫn Huệ Thuần Hoàng Đế (配天明運孝德仁武偉功弘烈聰哲敏惠純皇帝). He was buried in Tư Lăng mausoleum (思陵), which is located at Dương Xuân Thượng village, Hương Thuỷ commune, Thừa Thiên Province.

<doc id="1085171" wikidata="Q1134199" url="?curid=1085171" title="Ulster Cycle">
<text>The Ulster Cycle (), formerly known as the Red Branch Cycle, is a body of medieval Irish heroic legends and sagas of the Ulaid. It is set far in the past, in what is now eastern Ulster and northern Leinster, particularly counties Armagh, Down and Louth. It focuses on the mythical Ulster king Conchobar mac Nessa and his court at Emain Macha, the hero Cú Chulainn, and their conflict with the Connachta and queen Medb. The longest and most important tale is the epic &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (Cattle Raid of Cooley). The Ulster Cycle is one of the four &#x27;cycles&#x27; of Irish mythology and legend, along with the Mythological Cycle, the Fianna Cycle and the Kings&#x27; Cycle.

==Ulster Cycle stories==
The Ulster Cycle stories are set in and around the reign of King Conchobar mac Nessa, who rules the Ulaid from Emain Macha (now Navan Fort near Armagh). The most prominent hero of the cycle is Conchobar&#x27;s nephew, Cú Chulainn. The Ulaid are most often in conflict with the Connachta, led by their queen, Medb, her husband, Ailill, and their ally Fergus mac Róich, a former king of the Ulaid in exile. The longest and most important story of the cycle is the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; or &quot;Cattle Raid of Cooley&quot;, in which Medb raises an enormous army to invade the Cooley peninsula and steal the Ulaid&#x27;s prize bull, Donn Cúailnge, opposed only by the seventeen-year-old Cú Chulainn. In the Mayo Táin, the Táin Bó Flidhais it is a white cow known as the &#x27;Maol&#x27; that is the object of desire. One of the better known stories is the tragedy of Deirdre, source of plays by W. B. Yeats and J. M. Synge. Other stories tell of the births, courtships and deaths of the characters and of the conflicts between them.

The stories are written in Old and Middle Irish, mostly in prose, interspersed with occasional verse passages, with the earliest extant versions dated to the 12th century. The tone is terse, violent, sometimes comic, and mostly realistic, although supernatural elements intrude from time to time. Cú Chulainn in particular has superhuman fighting skills, the result of his semi-divine ancestry, and when particularly aroused his battle frenzy or &quot;ríastrad&quot; transforms him into an unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend nor foe. Evident deities like Lugh, the Morrígan, Aengus and Midir also make occasional appearances.

Unlike the majority of early Irish historical tradition, which presents ancient Ireland as largely united under a succession of High Kings, the stories of the Ulster Cycle depict a country with no effective central authority, divided into local and provincial kingdoms often at war with each other. The civilisation depicted is a pagan, pastoral one ruled by a warrior aristocracy. Bonds between aristocratic families are cemented by fosterage of each other&#x27;s children. Wealth is reckoned in cattle. Warfare mainly takes the form of cattle raids, or single combats between champions at fords. The characters&#x27; actions are sometimes restricted by religious taboos known as &quot;geasa&quot;.

===Manuscripts===
The stories are preserved in manuscripts of the 12th to 15th centuries but, in many cases, are believed to be much older. The language of the earliest stories is dateable to the 8th century, and events and characters are referred to in poems dating to the 7th.

The earliest extant manuscripts of the Ulster Cycle are &quot;Lebor na hUidre&quot;, &quot;The Book of the Dun Cow&quot;, dating to no later than 1106, and &quot;The Book of Leinster&quot;, compiled around 1160.

==Chronology==

The events of the cycle are traditionally supposed to take place around the time of Christ. The stories of Conchobar&#x27;s birth and death are synchronised with the birth and death of Christ, and the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; dates the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; and the birth and death of Cú Chulainn to the reign of the High King Conaire Mor, who it says was a contemporary of the Roman emperor Augustus (27 BC — AD 14). Some stories, including the &quot;Táin&quot;, refer to Cairbre Nia Fer as the king of Tara, implying that no High King is in place at the time.

The presence of the Connachta as the Ulaid&#x27;s enemies is an apparent anachronism: the Connachta were traditionally said to have been the descendants of Conn Cétchathach, who is supposed to have lived several centuries later. Later stories use the name Cóiced Ol nEchmacht as an earlier name for the province of Connacht to get around this problem. However, the chronology of early Irish historical tradition is an artificial attempt by Christian monks to synchronise native traditions with classical and biblical history, and it is possible that historical wars between the Ulaid and the Connachta have been chronologically misplaced.

==Historicity==

Along with the Lebor Gabála Érenn, elements of the Ulster Cycle were for centuries regarded as historical in Ireland, and the antiquity of these records was a matter of politicised debate; modern scholars have generally taken a more critical stance.

Some scholars of the 19th and early 20th centuries, such as Eugene O&#x27;Curry and Kuno Meyer, believed that the stories and characters of the Ulster Cycle were essentially historical; T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly was inclined to believe the stories were entirely mythical and the characters euhemerised gods; and Ernst Windisch thought that the cycle, while largely imaginary, contains little genuine myth. Elements of the tales are reminiscent of classical descriptions of Celtic societies in Gaul, Galatia and Britain. Warriors fight with swords, spears and shields, and ride in two-horse chariots, driven by skilled charioteers drawn from the lower classes. They take and preserve the heads of slain enemies, and boast of their valour at feasts, with the bravest awarded the &quot;curadmír&quot; or &quot;champion&#x27;s portion&quot;, the choicest cut of meat. Kings are advised by druids (Old Irish &quot;druí&quot;, plural &quot;druíd&quot;), and poets have great power and privilege. These elements led scholars such as Kenneth H. Jackson to conclude that the stories of the Ulster Cycle preserved authentic Celtic traditions from the pre-Christian Iron Age. Other scholars have challenged that conclusion, stressing similarities with early medieval Irish society and the influence of classical literature, while considering the possibility that the stories may contain genuinely ancient material from oral tradition. J. P. Mallory thus found the archaeological record and linguistic evidence to generally disfavour the presence of Iron Age remnants in the Ulster and Mythological Cycles, but emphasised the links to the Corlea Trackway in the earlier Tochmarc Étaíne as a notable exception.

It is probable that the oldest strata of tales are those involving the complex relationship between the Ulaid and the Érainn, represented in the Ulster Cycle by Cú Roí and the Clanna Dedad, and later by Conaire Mór. It was observed a century ago by Eoin MacNeill and other scholars that the historical Ulaid, as represented by the Dál Fiatach, were apparently related to the Clanna Dedad. T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly later concluded that the Ulaid were in fact a branch of the Érainn. A number of the Érainn appear to have been powerful Kings of Tara, with a secondary base of power at the now lost Temair Luachra &quot;Tara of the Rushes&quot; in West Munster, where some action in the Ulster Cycle takes place and may even have been transplanted from the midland Tara. Additionally it may be noteworthy that the several small cycles of tales involving the early dominance of the Érainn in Ireland generally predate the majority of the Ulster Cycle tales in content, if not in their final forms, and are believed to be of a substantially more pre-Christian character. Several of these do not even mention the famous characters from the Ulster Cycle, and those that do may have been slightly reworked after its later expansion with the &quot;Táin&quot; and rise in popularity.

*The Revealing of the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;

==Adaptations==
The Ulster Cycle provided material for Irish writers of the Gaelic revival around the turn of the 20th century. Augusta, Lady Gregory&#x27;s &quot;Cuchulain of Muirthemne&quot; (1902) retold most of the important stories of the cycle, as did Eleanor Hull for younger readers in &quot;The Boys&#x27; Cuchulain&quot; (1904). William Butler Yeats wrote a series of plays – &quot;On Baile&#x27;s Strand&quot; (1904), &quot;Deirdre&quot; (1907), &quot;The Green Helmet&quot; (1910), &quot;At the Hawk&#x27;s Well&quot; (1917), &quot;The Only Jealousy of Emer&quot; (1919) and &quot;The Death of Cuchulain&quot; (1939) – and a poem, &quot;Cuchulain&#x27;s Fight with the Sea&quot; (1892), based on the legends, and completed the late John Millington Synge&#x27;s unfinished play &quot;Deirdre of the Sorrows&quot; (1910), in collaboration with Synge&#x27;s widow Molly Allgood.

Literary adaptations of the 20th and 21st centuries include Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Hound of Ulster&quot; (1963), Morgan Llywelyn&#x27;s &quot;Red Branch&quot; (1989), Patricia Finney&#x27;s novel &quot;A Shadow of Gulls&quot; (1977), and Vincent Woods&#x27; play &quot;A Cry from Heaven&quot; (2005). Randy Lee Eickhoff has also created a series of six novelistic translations and retellings, beginning with &quot;The Raid&quot; (2000).

Parts of the cycle have been adapted as webcomics, including Patrick Brown&#x27;s &quot;Ness&quot; (2007–2008) and &quot;The Cattle Raid of Cooley&quot; (2008–2015); and M.K. Reed&#x27;s unfinished &quot;About a Bull&quot; (2011–2013) based around Queen Medb. The myth of Cú Chulainn was also adapted into graphic novels such as &quot;An Táin&quot; (2006) by Colmán Ó Raghallaigh and by Barry Reynolds and &quot;Hound&quot; (2014–2018) by Paul J. Bolger and Barry Devlin.

The dramatic musical program &quot;Celtic Hero&quot; in the &quot;Radio Tales&quot; series for National Public Radio, was based on the Ulster Cycle story &quot;Tochmarc Emire&quot;. &quot;Deirdre&quot; is an opera adaptation of the Ulster Cycle composed 1943-5, by the Canadian composer, Healey Willan, the text by John Coulter. It was the first full-length opera commissioned by the CBC, and was premiered 20 Apr 1946 on radio as &quot;Deirdre of the Sorrows&quot;, conducted by Ettore Mazzoleni and with Frances James as Deirdre. The myth of Cú Chulainn was adapted by Irish musician Gavin Dunne, better known as &quot;Miracle of Sound,&quot; in the song &quot;Tale of Cú Chulainn&quot; on his 2020 album &quot;Level 11.&quot;

<doc id="1085174" wikidata="Q216918" url="?curid=1085174" title="Silver chloride">
<text>Silver chloride is an inorganic chemical compound with the chemical formula AgCl. This white crystalline solid is well known for its low solubility in water and its sensitivity to light. Upon illumination or heating, silver chloride converts to silver (and chlorine), which is signaled by grey to black or purplish coloration in some samples. AgCl occurs naturally as the mineral chlorargyrite.

It is produced by a metathesis reaction for use in photography and in pH meters as electrodes.

==Preparation==
Silver chloride is unusual in that, unlike most chloride salts, it has very low solubility. It is easily synthesized by metathesis: combining an aqueous solution of silver nitrate (which is soluble) with a soluble chloride salt, such as sodium chloride (which is used industrially as a method of producing AgCl), or cobalt(II) chloride. The silver chloride that forms will precipitate immediately.
:
It can also be produced by the reaction of silver metal and aqua regia; however, the insolubility of silver chloride decelerates the reaction. Silver chloride is also a by-product of the Miller process, where silver metal is reacted with chlorine gas at elevated temperatures.

==History==
Silver chloride has been known since ancient times. Ancient Egyptians produced it as a method of refining silver, which was done by roasting silver ores with salt to produce silver chloride, which was subsequently decomposed to silver and chlorine. However, it was later identified as a distinct compound of silver in 1565 by Georg Fabricius. Silver chloride, historically known as &quot;luna cornea&quot; (which could be translated as &quot;horn silver&quot; as the moon was an alchemic codename for silver), has also been an intermediate in other historical silver refining processes. One such example is the Augustin process developed in 1843, wherein copper ore containing small amounts of silver is roasted in chloridizing conditions and the silver chloride produced is leached by brine, where it is more soluble.

Silver-based photographic films were first made in 1727 by Johann Heinrich Schulze with silver nitrate. However, he was not successful in making permanent images, as they faded away. Later in 1816, the use of silver chloride was introduced into photography by Nicéphore Niépce.

==Structure==

The solid adopts the &quot;fcc&quot; NaCl structure, in which each Ag+ ion is surrounded by an octahedron of six chloride ligands. AgF and AgBr crystallize similarly. However, the crystallography depends on the condition of crystallization, primarily free silver ion concentration, as is shown in the picture to the left (greyish tint and metallic lustre are due to partially reduced silver).

Above 7.5 GPa, silver chloride transitions into a monoclinic KOH phase. Then at 11 GPa, it undergoes another phase change to an orthorhombic TlI phase.

==Reactions==
AgCl dissolves in solutions containing ligands such as chloride, cyanide, triphenylphosphine, thiosulfate, thiocyanate and ammonia. Silver chloride reacts with these ligands according to the following illustrative equations:


Of these reactions used to leach silver chloride from silver ores, cyanidation is the most commonly used. Cyanidation produces the soluble dicyanoargentate complex, which is later turned back to silver by reduction.

Silver chloride does not react with nitric acid, but instead reacts with sulfuric acid to produce silver sulfate. Then the sulfate is protonated in the presence of sulfuric acid to bisulfate, which can be reversed by dilution. This reaction is used to separate silver from other platinum group metals.

Most complexes derived from AgCl are two-, three-, and, in rare cases, four-coordinate, adopting linear, trigonal planar, and tetrahedral coordination geometries, respectively.


These two reactions are particularly important in the qualitative analysis of AgCl in labs as AgCl is white, which changes to (silver arsenite) which is yellow, or (silver arsenate) which is reddish brown.

==Chemistry==

In one of the most famous reactions in chemistry, the addition of colorless aqueous silver nitrate to an equally colorless solution of sodium chloride produces an opaque white precipitate of AgCl:
This conversion is a common test for the presence of chloride in solution. Due to its conspicuousness, it is easily used in titration, which gives the typical case of argentometry.

The solubility product, &quot;K&quot;sp, for AgCl in water is at room temperature, which indicates that only 1.9 mg (that is, formula_1) of AgCl will dissolve per liter of water. The chloride content of an aqueous solution can be determined quantitatively by weighing the precipitated AgCl, which conveniently is non-hygroscopic since AgCl is one of the few transition metal chlorides that are insoluble in water. 
Interfering ions for this test are bromide and iodide, as well as a variety of ligands (see silver halide). 

For AgBr and AgI, the &quot;K&quot;sp values are 5.2 x 10−13 and 8.3 x 10−17, respectively. Silver bromide (slightly yellowish white) and silver iodide (bright yellow) are also significantly more photosensitive than is AgCl.

AgCl quickly darkens on exposure to light by disintegrating into elemental chlorine and metallic silver. This reaction is used in photography and film and is the following:
:Cl− + &quot;hν&quot; → Cl + e− (excitation of the chloride ion, which gives up its extra electron into the conduction band)
:Ag+ + e− → Ag (liberation of a silver ion, which gains an electron to become a silver atom)
The process is not reversible because the silver atom liberated is typically found at a crystal defect or an impurity site so that the electron&#x27;s energy is lowered enough that it is &quot;trapped&quot;.

==Uses==
===Silver chloride electrode===
Silver chloride is a constituent of the silver chloride electrode which is a common reference electrode in electrochemistry. The electrode functions as a reversible redox electrode and the equilibrium is between the solid silver metal and silver chloride in a chloride solution of a given concentration. It is usually the internal reference electrode in pH meters and it is often used as a reference in reduction potential measurements. As an example of the latter, the silver chloride electrode is the most commonly used reference electrode for testing cathodic protection corrosion control systems in seawater environments.
===Photography===
Silver chloride and silver nitrate have been used in photography since it began, and are well known for their light sensitivity. It was also a vital part of the Daguerreotype sensitization where silver plates were fumed with chlorine to produce a thin layer of silver chloride. Another famous process that used silver chloride was the gelatin silver process where embedded silver chloride crystals in gelatin were used to produce images. However, with advances in color photography, these methods of black-and-white photography have dwindled. Even though color photography uses silver chloride, it only works as a mediator for transforming light into organic image dyes.

Other photographic uses include making photographic paper, since it reacts with photons to form latent images via photoreduction; and in photochromic lenses, taking advantage of its reversible conversion to Ag metal. Unlike photography, where the photoreduction is irreversible, the glass prevents the electron from being &#x27;trapped&#x27;. These photochromic lenses are used primarily in sunglasses.

===Antimicrobial agent===
Silver chloride nanoparticles are widely sold commercially as an antimicrobial agent. The antimicrobial activity of silver chloride depends on the particle size, but are usually below 100 nm. In general, silver chloride is antimicrobial against various bacteria, such as E. coli.

Silver chloride nanoparticles for use as a microbial agent can be produced by a metathesis reaction between aqueous silver and chloride ions or can be biogenically synthesized by fungi and plants.

===Other uses===
Silver chloride&#x27;s low solubility makes it a useful addition to pottery glazes for the production of &quot;Inglaze lustre&quot;.
Silver chloride has been used as an antidote for mercury poisoning, assisting in the elimination of mercury.
Other uses of AgCl include:
* in bandages and wound healing products,
* to create yellow, amber, and brown shades in stained glass manufacture, and
* as an infrared transmissive optical component, as it can be hot-pressed into window and lens shapes.

==Natural occurrence==

Silver chloride occurs naturally as chlorargyrite in the arid and oxidized zones in silver deposits. If some of the chloride ions are replaced by bromide or iodide ions, the words bromian and iodian are added before the name, respectively. This mineral is a source of silver and is leached by cyanidation, where it will produce the soluble [Ag(CN)2]– complex.

== Safety ==
According to the ECHA, silver chloride may damage the unborn child, is very toxic to aquatic life with long lasting effects and may be corrosive to metals.

<doc id="1085175" wikidata="Q2018806" url="?curid=1085175" title="Oldsmobile Series 60">
<text>The Series 60 &quot;Special&quot; is a full-size car made by Oldsmobile from the 1939 through the 1948 model years. It was their entry-level model using the GM &quot;A&quot; body platform, giving Oldsmobile an entry-level product with more standard features that would be optional on Chevrolet and Pontiac vehicles using the same platform. Initially, the engine size used was the company&#x27;s flat head 6 cylinder, while senior models would use the flat head 8 cylinder. For marketing purposes, the Oldsmobile Series 60, or the Oldsmobile 66, took advantage of the national highway U.S. Route 66 established in 1926. It was with this generation that all GM vehicles experienced increased width dimensions to accommodate three passengers on the front bench seat and an additional three passengers on rear bench seat installed vehicles. This was accomplished with the deletion of running board thereby adding additional room inside the passenger compartment and upgrading the floor mounted gearshift to a steering column installed transmission gear selector for the Hydramatic automatic transmission. 

==1939–1940==
Naming standards were in flux at Oldsmobile during the late 1930s and 1940s. From 1932 through 1938 Oldsmobile had two series: &quot;F&quot; and &quot;L&quot;. The Series F came with a straight-six engine and the Series L came with a longer body and a straight-eight engine. The Series F was replaced by the Series 60 in 1939 and the Series L was replaced with the Series 70, with the Series 70 being powered by the straight-six and the straight-eight respectively. The Series 60 used the GM A-body and the Series 70 used the B-body. The Series 60 also shared a naming convention with the more upscale Buick Series 40, also called the Buick Special as the entry-level product for Buick.
The Series 60 occupied the entry-level position for Oldsmobiles sold in the United States from 1939 through the 1948 model years. They were trimmed in an entry-level fashion and, in parts and components, the Series 60 models were closely related to Chevrolets and Pontiacs. Naming conventions used by GM since the 1910s for all divisions used alphanumeric designations that changed every year. Oldsmobile starting after the war changed their designations and standardized them so that the first number signified the chassis platform, while the second number signified how many cylinders.

The 1939, Oldsmobiles were available with the &quot;automatic safety transmission&quot;, and was a semi-automatic, in that it still used a clutch to engage the planetary gearbox and then shifted automatically. The Hydramatic transmission, a fully clutch-less automatic transmission, debuted in the 1940 model year.

In 1939, four body styles were available: a business coupe with no rear seat, a club coupe with two rear fold-away jump seats, a two-door sedan with a full rear seat and a four-door sedan which shared its roofline with the two-door sedan. The wheelbase was 115 inches. The backs of the front seats were rounded and padded for protection of the rear seat occupants. A 216CID I6 was used.

In 1940, the even larger C-body was introduced to Oldsmobile and it alone was powered by the straight-eight. In order to differentiate it from the previous year&#x27;s Series 80 it was named the Series 90 (there was no Series 80 that year). The series were also given names for the first time that year with the Series 60, 70, and 90 being called the Special, Dynamic, and Custom Cruiser respectively.

Two body styles were added to the model line up in 1940: a two-door convertible and a four-door station wagon with an optional wooden body showing 633 were manufactured and a listed retail price of US$1,042 ($ in dollars ). In addition, a full rear seat was added to the club coupe, although it still did not share the roofline of the somewhat roomier two-door sedan. A deluxe equipment package was also new that year.
==1941–1948==

In 1941, both engines were offered on each Oldsmobile series so to differentiate between the two the second digit was used to denote the number of cylinders, so the Special 60 was replaced with the Special 66 and 68&#x27;. The only way to get an eight-cylinder engine on the GM A body from 1941 to 1948 was to buy an Oldsmobile Special 68 or a Pontiac Deluxe Torpedo Eight.

In 1941, the Series 60 wheelbase was increased to 119 in. Two models were produced, the 66 which used a 238 in3 (3.9 L) straight-six engine and the 68 which used a new 257CID (4.2 L) straight-eight. All Series 60s came with a three-speed column shift manual, or the optional four-speed Hydramatic automatic. Both options could be paired with either engine choice. Because of the column shift and new wider runningboard-less &quot;torpedo&quot; styling three passengers could now be accommodated comfortably in front. It used full instrumentation.

In 1941 the lineup consisted of a three-passenger two-door business coupe without a rear seat, a six-passenger two-door club coupe with a rear seat, a two-door sedan, a four-door &quot;bustle back&quot; sedan which shared its roof line with the two-door sedan, a four-door eight-passenger wood-bodied station wagon and a three-passenger two-door convertible. Except for the convertible and station wagon, all were available in either standard or deluxe trim. The station wagon was listed with a retail price of US$1,176 ($ in dollars ).

In 1942, Oldsmobile stayed with its Special 60 series on the bottom of a three series format. As with all automakers production was halted early in the year due to the war, both a six- or eight-cylinder motor could be ordered. Now extremely rare, both a convertible and a station wagon were available. A new body style was a six-passenger two-door club sedan fastback.

Production was delayed from 1942 until 1945 due to manufacturing efforts being devoted to World War II defense production. Before production was interrupted, to celebrate the company&#x27;s 44th anniversary at the time, all Oldsmobiles were installed with a small badge on the grille with &quot;B44&quot; attached. This was not a model designation.

In 1946, the Special 60 series was again Oldsmobile&#x27;s lowest priced group of cars. Special 60s had only six-cylinder power, although the eight-cylinder was offered in other years. The business coupe and the two-door sedan were discontinued. Interiors were a tan mixture pattern cloth. Standard tire size was 6.00 x 16 inches. Leather interiors were offered on convertibles. Technical features included electro-hardened aluminum pistons, full-pressure lubrication and automatic choke with fast idle mode. In 1946, dual windshield wipers were standard.

In 1947 more models were offered on the low-priced Special 60 series than the other two Oldsmobile series. The eight-cylinder engine returned to the Special 60 series and there were again 66 and 68 versions of each body style offered. Standard equipment included: safety glass, spare wheel and tire, dual horns, vacuum booster pump and cigarette lighter. The standard interior fabric was tan mixture cloth. Standard tire size was 6.00 x 16 inches. Horsepower grew to 100 for the six and 110 for the eight. It also had a turning circle.

The 66 and 68 were renamed the Dynamic 66 and 68 in 1948, sharing the designation with the Series 70. The Dynamic 60 series were the smallest Oldsmobiles available and offered the greatest variety or body styles. Both six-cylinder and eight-cylinder engines were available and were designated 66 and 68. Standard 60 Series equipment included: dual horns, dual sun visors and a cigarette lighter. The deluxe equipment package added foam rubber seat cushions, deluxe steering wheel, deluxe instrument cluster, clock and chrome wheel trim rings. Standard tires were 6.00 x 16 inches. Upholstery was Bedford cord or broadcloth.

The Series 60 model designation was retired after 1948, the L-head six-cylinder was then increased in displacement to and was used only in the Oldsmobile 76 which was discontinued in 1950. A limited number were put through production in 1950, but only five exist today.


==Australian production==

The Series 60 was also produced from 1946 to 1948 by General Motors-Holden&#x27;s in Australia, where it was marketed as the Oldsmobile Ace. Local bodies were fitted and these cars are completely different from the scuttle back and were the last GM cars to feature &quot;suicide doors&quot; (hinged at the back).

==South African production==
Cars were exported to South Africa in complete knock down (CKD) form for local assembly.

<doc id="1085176" wikidata="Q1674414" url="?curid=1085176" title="Isogeny">
<text>In mathematics, particularly in algebraic geometry, an isogeny is a morphism of algebraic groups (also known as group varieties) that is surjective and has a finite kernel.

If the groups are abelian varieties, then any morphism of the underlying algebraic varieties which is surjective with finite fibres is automatically an isogeny, provided that . Such an isogeny then provides a group homomorphism between the groups of -valued points of and , for any field over which is defined.

The terms &quot;isogeny&quot; and &quot;isogenous&quot; come from the Greek word ισογενη-ς, meaning &quot;equal in kind or nature&quot;. The term &quot;isogeny&quot; was introduced by Weil; before this, the term &quot;isomorphism&quot; was somewhat confusingly used for what is now called an isogeny.

==Degree of isogeny==
Let be isogeny between two algebraic groups.
This mapping induces a pullback mapping between their rational function fields. Since mapping is nontrivial, it is a field embedding and formula_1 is a subfield of . The degree of the extension formula_2 is called degree of isogeny:
:formula_3

Properties of degree:
* If formula_4, formula_5 are isogenies of algebraic groups, then: formula_6
* If formula_7, then formula_8

==Case of abelian varieties==
For abelian varieties, such as elliptic curves, this notion can also be formulated as follows:

Let &quot;E&quot;1 and &quot;E&quot;2 be abelian varieties of the same dimension over a field &quot;k&quot;. An isogeny between &quot;E&quot;1 and &quot;E&quot;2 is a dense morphism of varieties that preserves basepoints (i.e. &quot;f&quot; maps the identity point on &quot;E&quot;1 to that on &quot;E&quot;2).

This is equivalent to the above notion, as every dense morphism between two abelian varieties of the same dimension is automatically surjective with finite fibres, and if it preserves identities then it is a homomorphism of groups.

Two abelian varieties &quot;E&quot;1 and &quot;E&quot;2 are called isogenous if there is an isogeny . This can be shown to be an equivalence relation; in the case of elliptic curves, symmetry is due to the existence of the dual isogeny. As above, every isogeny induces homomorphisms of the groups of the k-valued points of the abelian varieties.

<doc id="1085185" wikidata="Q685847" url="?curid=1085185" title="Oldsmobile Series 70">
<text>The Oldsmobile Series 70 is a full-size midrange automobile produced by Oldsmobile between the 1939 and 1950 model years. Oldsmobiles of this time period were in an unusual &quot;middle&quot; position in GM&#x27;s hierarchy of automobile brands. Chevrolet and Pontiac were the budget priced models, while Buick and Cadillac were the luxury brands. GM would share their &quot;A&quot; body platforms between Chevrolet, Pontiac, and &quot;B&quot; body on Oldsmobile and Buick, while leaving Cadillac on the senior &quot;C&quot; platform. Oldsmobiles were then branded as &quot;luxury level&quot; Chevrolets and Pontiacs, while Oldsmobiles using the &quot;B&quot; platform were &quot;budget priced&quot; Buicks and Cadillacs. 

Competitors from Ford&#x27;s [[Mercury (automobile)|Mercury]] and Chrysler&#x27;s [[DeSoto (automobile)| DeSoto]] brands would give customers a choice to have Oldsmobile levels of luxury, while not paying as much for a comparable Oldsmobile. GM in later years would discontinue the Series 70 and the budget Oldsmobile Series 60, and introduce the Oldsmobile 88 to push Oldsmobile upmarket, giving Chevrolet and Pontiac a better market position for a lower price. It was with this generation that all GM vehicles experienced increased width dimensions to accommodate three passengers on the front bench seat and an additional three passengers on rear bench seat installed vehicles. This was accomplished with the deletion of running board thereby adding additional room inside the passenger compartment and upgrading the floor mounted gearshift to a steering column installed transmission gear selector for the Hydramatic automatic transmission. 

==1939–1940==

Naming standards were in flux at Oldsmobile during the late 1930s and 1940s. From 1932 through 1938 Oldsmobile had two series: &quot;F&quot; and &quot;L&quot;. Series F came with a straight-6 engine and Series L came with a larger body and a straight-8 engine. Series F was renamed Series 60 in 1939 and Series L was replaced with the Series 70, with the Series 70 being powered by the straight-6 and the straight-8 respectively. The Series 60 used the GM A-body and the Series 70 used the B-body. 

In 1940 the even larger C-body was introduced to Oldsmobile and it alone was powered by the straight-8. In order to differentiate it as Oldsmobiles senior level vehicle it was named the Series 90 while remaining below the Buick Special. The series were also given names for the first time that year with the Series 60, 70, and 90 being called the Special, Dynamic, and Custom Cruiser respectively. The Hydramatic transmission, a fully clutchless automatic, debuted in the 1940 model year.
==1941–1948==
In 1941 both straight six- and straight eight-engines were offered on each series so to differentiate between the two the second digit was used to denote the number of cylinders, so the Dynamic 70 was replaced with the Dynamic 76 and 78. In 1942 sales literature started referring to the Series 70 as the Dynamic Cruiser 76 and 78. 

Production was delayed from 1942 until 1945 due to manufacturing efforts being devoted to World War II defense production. To celebrate the company&#x27;s 44th anniversary at the time, all Oldsmobiles were installed with a small badge on the grille with &quot;B44&quot; attached. This was not a model designation.

In 1946 the Dynamic Cruiser Series 70 was Oldsmobile&#x27;s mid-priced model, and offered both a 2-door Club Sedan and 4-door Sedan, and the second number in the series designation continued to identify if it had a straight six- or straight eight-cylinder flat-head engine. Some of the optional equipment included a choice of a 6-tube or DeLuxe 7-tube radio, electric clock, plastic steering wheel, rear window wiper for both sedans, and auxiliary driving lights. Prices listed for the Dynamic 70 DeLuxe 4-door Sedan were US$1,678 ($ in dollars ) and 5,118 were assembled while the Dynamic 70 4-door Sedan was much more popular, selling 25,528 with a listed price of US$1,568 ($ in dollars ). Electrical equipment was modest as the cars of this time only used a 6-volt system. The standard equipment offered Bedford cord or broadcloth upholstery, front seat retractable center armrests, rubber floor mats, painted woodgrained instrument panel, dual sun visors, dual electric windshield wipers, and an automatic choke for the carburetor for easier starts for a cold engine. Buyers who chose the DeLuxe trim package were given carpeted inserts in the rubber floor mats, a deluxe instrument with full gauges, a retractable center armrest for the rear seat, the E-Z-I anti-glare rear view mirror and an electric clock. Curiously, the Standard Series 70 had 16&quot; wheels while the DeLuxe had 15&quot; wheels as standard equipment.

1947 was Oldsmobile&#x27;s fiftieth anniversary and other than some new two-tone exterior paint options, the standard and optional equipment and features remained carryover from previous years. A heater and windshield defroster was added to the options list for US$32 ($ in dollars ). New branch assembly locations were added at Atlanta and Wilmington. Due to the American public taking the opportunity to purchase new vehicles to replace cars kept in service due to WWII production suspension, 38,152 2-door Club Sedans and 30,841 4-door Sedans were built, more than the Special 60 Series or the larger Custom Cruiser 98. The Dynamic 76 was produced in Australia with fewer than 120 thought to have been produced during 1947.

In 1948, when the Series 60 was renamed the Dynamic the &quot;Cruiser&quot; tag was dropped from the Series 70 and it was once again named the Dynamic 76 and 78. 
==1949–1950==
The all new postwar Futuramic styling that had been introduced to the C-body Oldsmobile 98 in 1948 was brought to Oldsmobile&#x27;s A-body which it now shared with Pontiac and Chevrolet in 1949, and the new name Seventy-Six, with the numbers now spelled out, became Oldsmobile&#x27;s entry-level model when the Series 60 was discontinued. The wheelbase was now and was only available with the Oldsmobile straight-6 engine. The previous 78 model was retired with the 1949 introduction of the Oldsmobile 88, which shared its new Futuramic A-body platform with the Seventy-Six but was equipped with the new overhead-valve Rocket V8. The new word from 1948 &quot;Futuramic&quot; identified an Oldsmobile as the Dramatic Design of the Future, Beauty with Design and Styling with a Purpose1948 Oldsmobile Futuramic introduction. In its final year of 1950 the Seventy-Six continued to offer the DeLuxe trim package that was also offered on the station wagon, while the Holiday hardtop coupe was briefly offered, manufacturing only 144 with the standard trim package and 394 with the DeLuxe package and a listed retail price of US$2,108 ($ in dollars ). This particular model is particularly rare to find, as it was the only time Oldsmobile offered a six-cylinder engine with the upscale hardtop feature. The hardtop was built by welding a steel roof onto the convertible body style, which simplified assembly line operations.

The Seventy-Six was available in the following body styles:
* Station wagon
* Convertible
* Holiday hardtop coupé (2-door)
* Club coupé (2-door)
* Club sedan (2-door fastback)
* Town Sedan (4-door fastback)1949 Only
* 2 door Sedan (2-door)1950 only
* 4 door Sedan (4-door)

<text>Prince Félix of Bourbon-Parma (later Prince Félix of Luxembourg; 28 September 1893 – 8 April 1970) was the husband of Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg and the father of her six children, including her successor Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg. By birth to his father Robert I, Duke of Parma, he was a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma and one descendant of King Philip V of Spain. Prince Félix was the longest-serving consort of Luxembourg.

==Early life==
Prince Félix was one of the 24 children of the deposed Robert I, Duke of Parma, being the duke&#x27;s sixth child and third son by his second wife, Maria Antonia of Portugal. His maternal grandparents were Miguel of Portugal and Adelaide of Löwenstein-Wertheim-Rosenberg. He was born in Schwarzau am Steinfeld.

He was also the younger brother (by sixteen months) of Empress Zita of Austria. Of the twelve children of Duke Robert&#x27;s first marriage to Maria-Pia of the Two Sicilies, three died as infants, six had learning difficulties, and only three married. Despite the loss of his throne, Duke Robert and his family enjoyed considerable wealth, travelling in a private train of more than a dozen cars among his castles at Schwarzau am Steinfeld near Vienna, in northwest Italy, and the magnificent Château de Chambord in France.

Less than four months after Robert&#x27;s death in 1907 the Grand Marshal of the Austrian Court declared six of the children of his first marriage legally incompetent, at the behest of Duchess Maria Antonia. Nonetheless, Robert&#x27;s primary heir was Elias, Duke of Parma, (1880–1959), the youngest son of the first marriage and the only one to father children of his own. Duke Elias also became the legal guardian of his six elder siblings. Although Félix&#x27;s elder brothers, Prince Sixte and Prince Xavier, eventually sued their half-brother Duke Elias to obtain a greater share of the ducal fortune, they lost in the French courts, leaving Prince Félix with modest prospects.

During the Battle of Caporetto, Prince Félix accompanied his brother-in-law Charles I of Austria, who had been visiting troops on the Italian front, on a return journey to Trieste. When they were crossing the Torre (river), the Emperor&#x27;s car became stuck in the stream and it was deemed necessary to carry the Emperor to the river bank. However, the driver and aide-de-camp, who were carrying the Emperor, slipped and they were all caught in the current. Seeing this, Prince Félix, along with several chauffeurs, jumped into the river and, with the help of some planks, brought the Emperor and others to shore.

Félix served in the Austrian Dragoons as Lieutenant and Captain, but resigned his commission in November 1918, when Austria-Hungary dissolved.

==Marriage to Grand Duchess Charlotte==
On 6 November 1919 in Luxembourg, the prince married his first cousin Grand Duchess Charlotte of Luxembourg, having been admitted to the nobility of Luxembourg and also made &quot;Prince of Luxembourg&quot; by Grand Ducal decree the day before. Unlike some European consorts, Félix neither adopted his wife&#x27;s dynastic surname (of Nassau), nor relinquished his own title and name &quot;Prince of Bourbon-Parma&quot;. His traditional style as a Bourbon prince of the Parmesan branch is the reason that cadet members of the Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg enjoy the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; (but separately that style belongs to the Luxembourg monarch and heir apparent by right, as the historical prerogative of grand-ducal dynasties).

Felix was president of the Luxembourg Red Cross between 1923 and 1932 and again between 1947 and 1969. He was also Colonel of the Luxembourg Volunteers Company since 1920 and Inspector-General of the Luxembourg Army between 1945 and 1967.

Urban legend has it that Félix lost the Grünewald, a forest owned by the Grand Duchess, at a casino in 1934, but this is false; part of the property was sold, along with Berg Castle, to the Luxembourgian government, with the revenue paying for the upkeep of the grand-ducal household, and was not spent on personal consumption, let alone gambling losses.

During World War II the grand ducal family left Luxembourg shortly before the arrival of Nazi troops, settling in France until the capitulation, in June 1940. Subsequently, the family and the Grand Duchess&#x27; ministers received transit visas to Portugal from the Portuguese consul Aristides de Sousa Mendes, in June 1940. They arrived at Vilar Formoso on 23 June 1940. After travelling through Coimbra and Lisbon, the family first stayed in Cascais, in Casa de Santa Maria, owned by Manuel Espírito Santo, who was then the honorary consul for Luxembourg in Portugal. By July they had moved to Monte Estoril, staying at the Chalet Posser de Andrade. On 10 July 1940, Félix, together with his children, Hereditary Grand Duke Jean, Princess Elisabeth, Princess Marie Adelaide, Princess Marie Gabriele, Prince Charles and Princess Alix, the nanny Justine Reinard and the chauffeur Eugène Niclou, along with his wife Joséphine, boarded the &quot;S.S. Trenton&quot; headed for New York City, after which they moved to Canada.

==Death==
Prince Félix died at Fischbach Castle on 8 April 1970. His funeral mass was held at the Cathedral of Notre-Dame and he was later buried in the crypt of the cathedral.

==Marriage and children==

On 6 November 1919 in Luxembourg, he married Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. They had six children:
* Jean, Grand Duke of Luxembourg (1921–2019), who married HRH Princess Joséphine-Charlotte of Belgium (1927–2005), and had issue.

==Ancestry==

===Patrilineal descent===
Felix&#x27;s patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son.

Patrilineal descent is the principle behind membership in royal houses, as it can be traced back through the generations - which means that if Prince Felix were to choose an historically accurate house name it would be Robertian, as all his male-line ancestors have been of that house.

Felix is a member of the House of Bourbon-Parma, a sub-branch of the House of Bourbon-Spain, itself originally a branch of the House of Bourbon, and thus of the Capetian dynasty and of the Robertians.

Felix&#x27;s patriline is the line from which he is descended father to son. It follows the Dukes of Parma as well as the Kings of Spain, France, and Navarre. The line can be traced back more than 1,200 years from Robert of Hesbaye to the present day, through Kings of France &amp; Navarre, Spain and Two-Sicilies, Dukes of Parma and Grand-Dukes of Luxembourg, Princes of Orléans and Emperors of Brazil. It is one of the oldest in Europe.

<text>Gabriel&#x27;s Gully is a locality in Otago, New Zealand, three kilometres from Lawrence township and close to the Tuapeka River. It was the site of New Zealand&#x27;s first major gold rush.

The discovery of gold at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully by Gabriel Read on 25 May 1861 led to the Otago gold rush. While gold had been found in Otago before, this rush was beyond expectation, with the population of the gold field rising from almost nothing to around 11,500 within a year, twice that of Dunedin at the time. It also stimulated overseas interest in the new colony.

In May 1911, the jubilee of the discovery of gold in Gabriel&#x27;s Gully was held in Lawrence, with around 2,000 people attending, including surviving miners.

Gabriel&#x27;s Gully today is now part of the Gabriels Gully Historic Reserve, and is managed by the Department of Conservation. It has a Heritage New Zealand Category 1 designation.

<text>&#x27; (, &quot;Irish Institute&quot;; &#x27;) is a public body responsible for the promotion of the Irish language throughout the island of Ireland, including both the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It was set up on 2 December 1999, assuming the roles of the Irish language board (including the book distributor ), the publisher , and the terminological committee , all three of which had formerly been state bodies of the Irish government.

==Functions==
* Promotion of the Irish language;
* Facilitating and encouraging its use in speech and writing in public and private life in the Republic of Ireland and, in the context of Part III of the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages, in Northern Ireland where there is appropriate demand;
* Advising both administrations, public bodies and other groups in the private and voluntary sectors;
* Undertaking supportive projects, and grant-aiding bodies and groups as considered necessary;
* Undertaking research, promotional campaigns, and public and media relations;
* Developing terminology and dictionaries;
* Supporting Irish-medium education and the teaching of Irish.

The North South Ministerial Council (NSMC) was established under the Belfast/Good Friday Agreement (1998), to develop consultation, co-operation and action within the island of Ireland. The Language Body (consisting of two agencies i.e. Foras na Gaeilge and the Ulster-Scots Agency) was one of six North South Implementation Bodies which were set up and operate on an all-island basis. While having a clear operational remit, all operate under the overall policy direction of the North South Ministerial Council, with clear accountability lines back to the council and to the Oireachtas and the Northern Ireland Assembly.

==Publications==
&quot;An Gúm&quot;, which previously published Irish language books for the Department of Education, became part of Foras na Gaeilge following its formation in 1999. Foras na Gaeilge is also involved in publishing dictionaries.

&quot;Saol&quot; (meaning &#x27;life&#x27;), also known as &quot;Saol na Gaeilge&quot;, was a free Irish-language monthly newspaper that was funded by Foras na Gaeilge. First published in 1988 and based in Dublin, as of 2001 it was edited by Colm Ó Torna.

<text>Thomas Gabriel Read (21 August 182531 October 1894) was a gold prospector and farmer. His discovery of gold in Gabriel&#x27;s Gully triggered the first major gold rush in New Zealand.

==Life==
Read was born on 21 August 1825 in Van Diemen&#x27;s Land. The eldest of ten children, his father was businessman and banker George Frederick Read and his mother, Margaret Terry, was the daughter of a miller and the senior Read&#x27;s second wife. 

After working on the goldfields of California and Victoria in the 1850s, Read travelled to Otago, New Zealand, on board the &quot;Don Pedro II&quot;, having heard rumours in September 1860 of gold being found in Mataura, Southland. He arrived in Otago in February 1861. On 25 May 1861, he discovered gold close to the banks of the Tuapeka River in Otago, at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully, which is named after him. Read wrote to Otago Superintendent John Richardson on 4 June to confirm the discovery, which led to the Otago gold rush. The Otago Provincial Council awarded Read £1000, having earlier advertised a £500 reward for &quot;the discovery of a Remunerative Goldfield within the Province of Otago&quot;, even though an Indian man, Edward Peters, was the discoverer of the first workable gold field in Otago in 1858 and had two applications rejected.

In 1864, Read returned to Tasmania with his £1000 windfall; he invested £155 of this to purchase Smooth Island. In 1869, he married his cousin, Amelia Mitchell (née Wilson); they remained childless. Read was admitted to the New Norfolk Hospital for the Insane in Hobart in April 1887, suffering from bipolar disorder. He remained at that hospital until his death on 31 October 1894 aged 69. The cause of death was apoplexy. He was buried in an unmarked grave in New Norfolk.

<doc id="1085223" wikidata="Q2301005" url="?curid=1085223" title="Mythological Cycle">
<text>The Mythological Cycle is a conventional grouping within Irish mythology. It consists of tales and poems about the god-like Tuatha Dé Danann, who are based on Ireland&#x27;s pagan deities, and other mythical races such as the Fomorians and the Fir Bolg. It is one of the four main story &#x27;cycles&#x27; of early Irish myth and legend, along with the Ulster Cycle, the Fianna Cycle and the Cycles of the Kings. The name &quot;Mythological Cycle&quot; seems to have gained currency with Arbois de Jubainville . James MacKillop says the term is now &quot;somewhat awkward&quot;, and John T. Koch notes it is &quot;potentially misleading, in that the narratives in question represent only a small part of extant Irish mythology&quot;. He prefers T Ó Cathasaigh&#x27;s name, Cycle of the Gods. Important works in the cycle are the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (&quot;Book of Invasions&quot;), the &quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; (&quot;Battle of Moytura&quot;), the &quot;Aided Chlainne Lir&quot; (&quot;Children of Lir&quot;) and &quot;Tochmarc Étaíne&quot; (&quot;The Wooing of Étaín&quot;).

== Overview ==
The characters appearing in the cycle are essentially gods from the pre-Christian pagan past in Ireland. Commentators exercising caution, however, qualify them as representing only &quot;godlike&quot; beings, and not gods. This is because the Christian scribes who composed the writings were generally (though not always) careful not to refer to the Tuatha Dé Danann and other beings explicitly as deities. The disguises are thinly veiled nonetheless, and these writings contain discernible vestiges of early Irish polytheistic cosmology.

Examples of works from the cycle include numerous prose tales, verse texts, as well as pseudo-historical chronicles (primarily the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (LGE), commonly called &quot;The Book of Invasions&quot;) found in medieval vellum manuscripts or later copies. Some of the romances are of later composition and found only in paper manuscripts dating to near-modern times (&quot;Cath Maige Tuired&quot; and &quot;The Fate of the Children of Tuireann&quot;).

Near-modern histories such as the Annals of the Four Masters and Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;History of Ireland&quot; (=Seathrún Céitinn, &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot;) are also sometimes considered viable sources, since they may offer additional insights with their annotated and interpolated reworkings of &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; accounts.

Orally transmitted folk-tales may also be, in a broad sense, considered mythological cycle material, notably, the folk-tales that describe Cian&#x27;s tryst with Balor&#x27;s daughter while attempting to recover the bountiful cow Glas Gaibhnenn.

The god-folk of the successive invasions are &quot;euhemerised&quot;, i.e., described as having dwelt terrestrially and ruling over Ireland in kingship before the age of mortal men (the Milesians, or their descendants).
Afterwards, the Tuatha Dé Danann are said to have retreated into the sídhe (fairy mounds), cloaking their presence by raising the &quot;féth fiada&quot; (fairy mist).
Having disappeared but not died, the deities oftentimes make &quot;guest appearances&quot; in narratives categorised under other cycles. (e.g., Lugh&#x27;s appearance as the divine father and Morrígan as nemesis to the Ulster hero Cuchulainn;
encounters of Finnian characters with dwellers of the sidhe; Cormac mac Airt&#x27;s, or his grandfather&#x27;s visits to the otherworldly realms.)

Collected literature, while they do not belong to the cycle in entirety, nevertheless capture tidbits of lore about the deities.

==Lists of literature==
The following table is a summary of titles of all of the mythological texts that survive and are in print.
== History of the Mythological Cycle ==
The main source of mythology comes from &quot;The Book of Invasions&quot;, or &quot;Lebor Gabala Erenn&quot;. It is an abridged compilation of both prose and poetry on the origins of Ireland and the extraordinary deities. The original was more expansive, but perished in what is to be assumed Viking raids, or being claimed during war time.

A supplemental text is attributed to a chronicler that goes by the name Keating, who published his book in the 17th century. He had access to materials that have not yet been published. Nennius and Eochaid Ua Flainn, chroniclers who lived during the 10th century, recorded mythological Irish history by way of poetry. Though their contributions are short and semi-vague, they contain a lot of precious information on Ireland&#x27;s spiritual beliefs of the time. The Tuatha De Danann can be linked to the same origins as the gods in Greek mythology. Hesiod calls the Greek Gods &quot;the Golden Race,&quot; and similar attributes are seen in the Celtic gods.

In Irish mythology, Ireland was subject to 6 invasions. The first 5 were from otherworldy beings, and the last was from Milesians.

The Tuatha De Danann were known to come from the heavens, but that may be from scribes not knowing how to execute their origin. So the scribes borrowed from past religions like the Greek, Roman, and Eastern myth to create an origin story. The Gauls were thought to come from underneath the Earth. This information had been passed down from druids from Dispater, the God of the underworld.

Earth was thought to be a woman at the time, so this was thought to be a metaphorical birth, not ascending from hell. The earth, moon, and sun were thought to be created by druids, much like how Brahmans boasted the same cosmogony story. Much like preceding myth, the Gauls believed the trees and mountains held up the sky.

These stories stayed in the oral tradition because the Irish had not been invaded at the time, like surrounding countries. In conjunction, the druidic schools wanted to maintain the stories in verbal form. This kept the stories in circulation to the culture and public. When Christian scribes came to Ireland, they wrote down the stories in Latin. In succeeding centuries many of the texts were lost or destroyed during Viking raids. The remaining texts were re-recorded in manuscripts in the 11th and 12th century. Though previous manuscripts were are dated to 3-4 centuries earlier in the Irish language.

== History of the Tuatha Dé Danann ==
The Tuatha Dé Danann are divine beings that came to Ireland by ships and inhabited the country before the native Irish. They came to Ireland to take the land from the Fir Bolgs that had already been residing in the north of Ireland at the time. The Tuatha were immediately perceived as gods for their superior skills: various arts of druidry, magic, prophecy and history. Their leader was named Nuada. He led them to war against the Fir Bolgs around the west shore of Ireland, where the Tuatha had arrived by ship. Many of the Tuatha died in this war, but thousands of Fir Bolgs died. Including their leader, Eochai Mac Erc. They come from another world, but reside in Ireland until they were pushed out by war with a semi-demonic race called the Fomorians. Their king is known in the mythology as Balor. The Fomorians resided on the outskirts of Ireland. When the Tuatha Dé Danann were defeated in battle against the Milesians, they were forced to live underground in the Sidhes. The Sidhes were chambers under Ireland&#x27;s surface. Though away from the mortal world, they still would come to surface on special days like Hallowe&#x27;en and May Day.

===Verse texts===
Besides independent verses, a number of poems are embedded in prose tales, etc. A number of them are also preserved in the pseudohistorical &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, Keating, etc.

* (&quot;Fintan and the Hawk of Aicill&quot;)
* Coire Érmai / Coire Goriath (&quot;The Cauldron of Poesy&quot;)

===Lore===
Collected lore are not wholly of mythological content, but parts of it are. &quot;The Fitness of Names&quot; (#149–159, etc.) provides interesting explanations on names of Dian Cecht among others. Irish onomastica, the Dindshenchas, also include stories about deities such as Boann (under Inber Colptha), the Dagda (under Fidh nGaible), Brecan (Coire Brecain), often in developed narrative verse or prose tales. Genealogical tracts and the &quot;Roll of the Kings&quot;, various glosses (e.g. to the law treatise &quot;Senchus Mor&quot;) may also be culled for information.
* &quot;Banshenchas&quot; (&quot;History of Women&quot;) 
* Cóir Anmann (&quot;The Fitness of Names&quot;): 
* Dindsenchas (&quot;Lore of Places&quot;)
* &quot;Sanas Cormaic&quot; (&quot;Cormac&#x27;s Glossary&quot;): Nes[s] (Nescoit)
* Triads of Ireland: mention of the indeoin Dagdai, ox of Díl, etc.

===Pseudohistory===
* &quot;Chronicon Scotorum&quot;
* &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;

===Folktales===
* Glas Gaibhnenn

===Prose tales===
The following prose tales are described in greater depth in the following section.

==Survey of prose tales==
The euhemerised deities arrived in five sets of migrations (see &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;), but none of the individual migrations tales (&quot;&quot;; sing. &quot;tochomlod&quot;) survived intact.
Remnants of the migration tales are the summarised accounts given in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; (&quot;Book of Invasions&quot;). Apart from these are the tale of Tuan mac Cairill, Fintan mac Bóchra colloquy. Tuan and Fintan are ancient beings from the Antediluvian past, who have reincaranted into different creatures, and are referred to in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; as well.

Of the battle tales (; sing. cath), the full narratives of the First and Second Battle of Moytura (Battles of Mag Tuired) survive in relatively late (16th century) manuscripts.
Other important battle tales such as the &quot;Cath Tailten&quot; (Battle of Tailten) or &quot;Orgain Tuir Chonaind&quot; (&quot;Massacre of Conan&#x27;s Tower&quot;) are lost, though abstracted in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;.

The late romance of &quot;Oidheadh Chloinne Tuireann&quot; (&quot;The Fate of the Children of Tuireann&quot;) tells how Lugh fines the sons of Tuireann for his father Cian&#x27;s murder, compelling them to collect a series of magical objects and weapons which will be useful in the second battle of Mag Tuired against the Fomorians. An earlier version of this is recorded in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, with a somewhat different list of fines (), with no indication the murder happened on the eve of the great battle.

In the &quot;Oidheadh Chloinne Lir&quot; (&quot;The Fate of the Children of Lir&quot;), the eponymous children are turned into swans by their jealous stepmother, and live in swan form into Christian times, when they are converted, transformed back into human form, and die of extreme old age.

&quot;Tochmarc Étaíne&quot; (&quot;The Wooing of Étaín&quot;) tells first of the conception of Aengus through the adultery of the Dagda and Boann, and how Aengus won the residence of the &quot;Brú na Bóinne&quot; from Boann&#x27;s husband Elcmar. It goes on to tell of the various lives of Étaín, wife of Midir, who is turned into a fly and driven away by Midir&#x27;s jealous first wife Fuamnach. In her insect form she becomes the companion of Aengus, until Fuamnach once again drives her away, and she is swallowed by a mortal woman and reborn as her daughter. Her beauty attracts the attention of the High King, Eochaid Airem, who marries her; ultimately her berift husband Midir uses magic and trickery to win her back.

There is also a curious account regarding Goídel Glas, the legendary ancestor of the migratory races and eponymous creator of the Gaelic language, and how he was cured by Moses&#x27;s rod from a snake bite, related to in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, although Macalister is dismissive of it as fiction invented by glossators.

<doc id="1085227" wikidata="Q6165880" url="?curid=1085227" title="Soviet invasion of Manchuria">
<text>The Soviet invasion of Manchuria, formally known as the Manchurian Strategic Offensive Operation or simply the Manchurian Operation () and sometimes Operation August Storm, began on 9 August 1945 with the Soviet invasion of the Empire of Japan&#x27;s puppet state of Manchukuo, which was situated in Japanese-occupied Manchuria. It was the largest campaign of the 1945 Soviet–Japanese War, which resumed hostilities between the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Empire of Japan after almost six years of peace. 

Soviet gains on the continent were Manchukuo, Mengjiang (the northeast section of present-day Inner Mongolia) and northern Korea. The Soviet entry into this theater of the war and the defeat of the Kwantung Army were significant factors in the Japanese government&#x27;s decision to surrender unconditionally, as it became apparent that the Soviet Union had no intention of acting as a third party in negotiating an end of the war on conditional terms.

==Summary==
As agreed with the United Kingdom and the United States (Western Allies) at the Tehran Conference in November 1943 and the Yalta Conference in February 1945, the Soviet Union entered World War II&#x27;s Pacific Theater within three months of the end of the war in Europe. The invasion began on 9 August 1945, exactly three months after the German surrender on May 8 (9 May, 0:43 Moscow time).

Although the commencement of the invasion fell between the American atomic bombing of Hiroshima, on 6 August, and only hours before the Nagasaki bombing on 9 August, the timing of the invasion had been planned well in advance and was determined by the timing of the agreements at Tehran and Yalta, the long-term buildup of Soviet forces in the Far East since Tehran, and the date of the German surrender some three months earlier; on August 3, Marshal Vasilevsky reported to Premier Joseph Stalin that, if necessary, he could attack on the morning of 5 August.

At 11 p.m. Trans-Baikal (UTC+10) time on 8 August 1945, Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov informed Japanese ambassador Naotake Satō that the Soviet Union had declared war on Japan, and that from 9 August the Soviet government would consider itself to be at war with Japan. At one minute past midnight Trans-Baikal time on 9 August 1945, the Soviets commenced their invasion simultaneously on three fronts to the east, west and north of Manchuria:

* Khingan–Mukden Offensive Operation (9 August 1945 – 2 September 1945) (Lesser Khingan-Mukden area);
* Harbin–Kirin Offensive Operation (9 August 1945 – 2 September 1945) (Harbin-Jilin area); and
* (9 August 1945 – 2 September 1945).

Though the battle extended beyond the borders traditionally known as &quot;Manchuria&quot;—that is, the traditional lands of the Manchus—the coordinated and integrated invasions of Japan&#x27;s northern territories has also been called &quot;the Battle of Manchuria&quot;. It has also been referred to as the &quot;Manchurian strategic offensive operation&quot;.

==Background and buildup==
The Russo-Japanese War of the early 20th century resulted in a Japanese victory and the Treaty of Portsmouth by which, in conjunction with other later events including the Mukden incident and Japanese invasion of Manchuria in September 1931, Japan eventually gained control of Korea, Manchuria and South Sakhalin. In the late 1930s there were a number of Soviet-Japanese border incidents, the most significant being the Battle of Lake Khasan (Changkufeng Incident, July–August 1938) and the Battle of Khalkhin Gol (Nomonhan Incident, May–September 1939), which led to the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact of April 1941. The Neutrality Pact freed up forces from the border incidents and enabled the Soviets to concentrate on their war with Germany, and the Japanese to concentrate on their southern expansion into Asia and the Pacific Ocean.

With success at Stalingrad, and the eventual defeat of Germany becoming increasingly certain, the Soviet attitude to Japan changed, both publicly, with Stalin making speeches denouncing Japan, and covertly with the building up of forces and supplies in the Far East. At the Tehran Conference in November 1943, Stalin, Winston Churchill, and Franklin Roosevelt agreed that the Soviet Union would enter the war against Japan once Germany was defeated. Stalin faced a dilemma: he wanted to avoid a war on two fronts at almost any cost, yet he also saw an opportunity to secure gains in the Far East on top of those he expected in Europe. The only way Stalin could ensure these gains without a two-front war would be for Germany to capitulate before Japan.

Due to the Soviet–Japanese Neutrality Pact, the Soviets made it official policy to intern Allied aircraft and crews who landed in Soviet territory following operations against Japan. However, the Soviets and Western Allies soon came to informal arrangements to circumvent official policy. Under the auspices of Lend Lease, the Allies officially transferred aircraft of the same types interred by the Soviets in the Far East, the mutual understanding being that the Soviets would also be able use &quot;interned&quot; Allied aircraft against the Germans without revealing their true origins. In return, Allied airmen held in the Soviet Union were usually transferred to camps near Iran or other Allied-controlled territory, from where they were typically allowed to &quot;escape&quot; after some period of time. Nevertheless, the Soviet buildup in the Far East steadily accelerated even before the defeat of Germany. By early 1945 it had become apparent to the Japanese that the Soviets were preparing to invade Manchuria, though they correctly calculated that they were unlikely to attack prior to Germany&#x27;s defeat. In addition to their problems in the Pacific, the Japanese realised the need to determine when and where a Soviet invasion would occur.

At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Stalin secured Roosevelt&#x27;s acceptance of Soviet expansion in the Far East, in return for agreeing to enter the Pacific war within two or three months after the defeat of Germany. By the middle of March, things were not going well in the Pacific for the Japanese, and they had withdrawn their elite troops from Manchuria to support actions in the Pacific. Meanwhile, the Soviets continued their Far Eastern buildup, having decided that they did not wish to renew the Neutrality Pact. The terms of the Pact required a notification of expiry 12 months ahead of time, so on 5 April 1945 the Soviets ostensibly obliged, informing the Japanese that they did not wish to renew the treaty. This caused the Japanese considerable concern, but the Soviets went to great efforts to assure the Japanese that the treaty would still be in force for another twelve months, and that the Japanese had nothing to worry about.

Germany surrendered just after midnight Moscow time on 9 May 1945, meaning that if the Soviets were to honour the agreement at Yalta, they would need to enter the war with Japan by 9 August. The situation continued to deteriorate for the Japanese, now the only Axis power left in the war. They were keen to stay at peace with the Soviets, and ultimately to achieve an end to the war. Since Yalta, they had repeatedly tried to convince the Soviets to extend the Neutrality Pact, as well as attempting to enlist them to mediate peace negotiations with the Western Allies. The Soviets did nothing to discourage these overtures, instead happy to draw out the process for as long as possible whilst continuing to prepare their invasion forces. One of the goals of Admiral Baron Suzuki&#x27;s cabinet upon taking office in April was to try to secure any peace terms whatsoever short of unconditional surrender. In late June, they once again approached the Soviets, inviting them to mediate with the Western Allies in support of Japan, providing them with specific proposals. In exchange, they were prepared to offer the Soviets very attractive territorial concessions. Stalin ostensibly expressed interest, and the Japanese now awaited an official Soviet response, even as the Soviets continued to deliberately avoid providing one. The Potsdam Conference was held from 16 July to 2 August; on 24 July the Soviet Union recalled all its embassy staff and families from Japan. On 26 July the conference produced the Potsdam Declaration whereby Churchill, Harry S. Truman and Chiang Kai-shek demanded Japan&#x27;s unconditional surrender. The Japanese avoided responding to the declaration, instead continuing to wait on a clarifying Soviet reply.

The Japanese had been monitoring Trans-Siberian Railway traffic and Soviet activity to the east of Manchuria. In conjunction with the delaying tactics, this suggested that the Soviets would not be ready to invade east Manchuria before the end of August. The Japanese did not have any concrete evidence as to when or where any invasion would occur. They had estimated that an attack was not likely before the spring of 1946, but the &quot;Stavka&quot; had in fact been planning for a mid-August offensive, successfully concealing the buildup of a force of 90 divisions. Many Soviet units had crossed Siberia in their vehicles to avoid straining the rail link.

The Japanese were caught completely by surprise upon receiving the Soviet declaration of war an hour before midnight on 8 August, now facing a simultaneous invasion on three fronts that began just after midnight on 9 August.

==Combatants==

===Soviets===

The Far East Command, under Marshal of the Soviet Union Aleksandr Vasilevsky, had a plan to conquer Manchuria that was simple but huge in scale, calling for a massive pincer movement over all of Manchuria. This was to be performed by the Transbaikal Front from the west and by the 1st Far Eastern Front from the east; the 2nd Far Eastern Front was to attack the center of the pocket from the north. The only Soviet equivalent of a theater command that operated during the war (apart from the short-lived 1941 &quot;Directions&quot; in the west), Far East Command, consisted of three Red Army fronts.

====Transbaikal Front====
The Transbaikal Front, under Marshal Rodion Malinovsky, included:
*17th Army
*36th Army
*39th Army
*53rd Army
*6th Guards Tank Army
*Soviet Mongolian Cavalry Mechanized Group under Issa Pliyev
*12th Air Army.

The Transbaikal Front was to form the western half of the Soviet pincer movement, attacking across the Inner Mongolian desert and over the Greater Khingan mountains. These forces had as their objectives firstly to secure Mukden (present day Shenyang), then to meet troops of the 1st Far Eastern Front at the Changchun area in south central Manchuria, and in doing so finish the pincer movement.

Amassing over one thousand tanks and self-propelled guns, the 6th Guards Tank Army was to serve as an armored spearhead, leading the Front&#x27;s advance and capturing objectives inside Manchuria by the fifth day of the invasion.

The 36th Army was also attacking from the west, but with the objective of meeting forces of the 2nd Far Eastern Front at Harbin and Qiqihar.

====1st Far Eastern Front====
The 1st Far Eastern Front, under Marshal Kirill Meretskov, included:
*1st Red Banner Army
*5th Army
*25th Army
*35th Army
*10th Mechanized Corps
*9th Air Army.

The 1st Far Eastern Front was to form the eastern half of the pincer movement. This attack involved the 1st Red Banner Army, the 5th Army and the 10th Mechanized Corps striking towards Mudanjiang (or Mutanchiang). Once that city was captured, this force was to advance towards the cities of Jilin (or Kirin), Changchun and Harbin. Its final objective was to link up with the forces of the Transbaikal Front at Changchun and Jilin thus closing the double envelopment movement.

As a secondary objective, the 1st Far Eastern Front was to prevent Japanese forces from escaping to Korea, and then invade the Korean Peninsula up to the 38th parallel, establishing in the process what later became North Korea. This secondary objective was to be carried out by the 25th Army. Meanwhile, the 35th Army was tasked with capturing the cities of Boli (or Poli), Linkou and Mishan.

====2nd Far Eastern Front====
The 2nd Far Eastern Front, under General Maksim Purkayev, included:
*2nd Red Banner Army
*15th Army
*16th Army (whose 56th Rifle Corps was its only formation to see combat, on South Sakhalin)
*5th Separate Rifle Corps
*Chuguevsk Operational Group
*Amur Military Flotilla
*10th Air Army

The 2nd Far Eastern Front was deployed in a supporting attack role. Its objectives were the cities of Harbin and Qiqihar, and to prevent an orderly withdrawal to the south by the Japanese forces. The front also included the 88th Separate Rifle Brigade, composed of Chinese and Korean guerrillas of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army who had retreated into the USSR in the beginning of the 1940s. The unit, led by Zhou Baozhong, was set to participate in the invasion for use in sabotage and reconnaissance missions, but was considered too valuable to be sent into the battlefield. They were thus withheld from participating in combat and instead used for leadership and administrative positions for district offices and police stations in the liberated areas during the subsequent occupation. The Korean battalion of the brigade (including future leader of the DPRK, Kim Il Sung) were also sent to assist in the following occupation of Northern Korea as part of the 1st Far Eastern Front.

Once troops from the 1st Far Eastern Front and Transbaikal Front captured the city of Changchun, the 2nd Far Eastern Front was to attack the Liaotung Peninsula and seize Port Arthur (present day Lüshun).

Each front had &quot;front units&quot; attached directly to the front instead of an army. The forces totaled 89 divisions with 1.5 million men, 3,704 tanks, 1,852 self propelled guns, 85,819 vehicles and 3,721 aircraft. Approximately one-third of its strength was in combat support and services. The Soviet plan incorporated all of the experience in maneuver warfare that they had acquired in fighting the Germans.

===Japanese===

The Kwantung Army of the Imperial Japanese Army, under General Otozo Yamada, was the major part of the Japanese occupation forces in Manchuria and Korea, and consisted of two Area Armies and three independent armies:
*First Area Army (northeastern Manchukuo), including:
**3rd Army
**5th Army
*Third Area Army (southwestern Manchukuo), including:
**30th Army
**44th Army
*Independent units:
**4th Army (an independent field army responsible for northern Manchuria)
**34th Army (an independent field army responsible for the areas between the Third and Seventeenth Area Armies in northern Korea)
**Seventeenth Area Army (responsible for Korea; assigned to the Kwantung Army at the eleventh hour, to no avail)

Each &quot;Area Army&quot; (&quot;Homen Gun&quot;, the equivalent of a Western &quot;army&quot;) had headquarters units and units attached directly to the Area Army, in addition to the field armies (the equivalent of a Western corps). In addition, the Japanese were assisted by the forces of their puppet states of Manchukuo and Mengjiang. Manchukuo had an army of about 170,000 to 200,000 troops, while Mengjiang had around 44,000 troops, with the majority of these puppet troops being of dubious quality. Korea, the next target for the Soviet Far East Command, was garrisoned by the Japanese Seventeenth Area Army.

Including the Japanese forces in Korea, the Kwantung Army had over 900,000 men in 31 divisions and 13 brigades; there were about 400 obsolescent tanks and 2,000 aircraft (of the 1040 aircraft in Manchuria, only 230 were combat types and 55 were modern). However, the Kwantung Army was far below its authorized strength; most of its heavy equipment and all of its best military units had transferred to the Pacific Theater over the previous three years to contend with the advance of American forces. Some Kwantung Army units had also re-deployed south against the Nationalist Chinese in Operation Ichigo in 1944. By 1945 the Kwantung Army contained a large number of raw recruits and conscripts, with generally obsolete, light, or otherwise limited equipment. Almost all of the tanks were early 1930s models such as the Type 95 Ha-Go and Type 89 I-Go, the anti-tank units only possessed Type 1 37 mm anti-tank guns that were ineffective against Soviet armor, and the infantry had very few machine-guns and no anti-materiel rifles or submachine guns. As a result, the Japanese forces in Manchuria and Korea had essentially been reduced to a light-infantry counter-insurgency force with limited mobility and limited ability to fight a conventional land war against a coordinated enemy. In fact, only six of the Kwantung Army&#x27;s divisions existed prior to January 1945. Accordingly, the Japanese regarded none of the Kwantung Army&#x27;s units as combat ready, with some units being declared less than 15% ready.

The Imperial Japanese Navy did not contribute to the defense of Manchuria, the occupation of which it had always opposed on strategic grounds. Additionally, by the time of the Soviet invasion, the few remnants of its fleet were stationed and tasked for the defense of the Japanese home islands in the event of an invasion by American forces.

Compounding their problems, the Japanese military made many wrong assumptions and major mistakes, most significantly:
*They wrongly assumed that any attack coming from the west would follow either the old railway line to Hailar, or head into Solun from the eastern tip of Mongolia. The Soviets did attack along those routes, but their main attack from the west went through the supposedly impassable Greater Khingan range south of Solun and into the center of Manchuria.
*Japanese military intelligence failed to determine the nature, location and scale of the Soviet buildup in the Soviet Far East. Based upon an initial underestimation of Soviet strength and on the monitoring of Soviet traffic on the Trans-Siberian railway, the Japanese believed that the Soviets would not have sufficient forces in place for an offensive before the end of August 1945, and that an attack was most likely in the autumn of 1945 or in the spring of 1946.

Due to the withdrawal of the Kwantung Army&#x27;s elite forces for redeployment into the Pacific Theater, the Japanese made new operational plans during the summer of 1945 for the defence of Manchuria against a seemingly inevitable Soviet attack. These called for redeploying the bulk of available forces from the border areas; the borders were to be held lightly and delaying actions were to be fought while the main force was to hold the southeastern corner in strength (so defending Korea from attack).

Further, the Japanese had observed Soviet activity only on the Trans-Siberian railway and along the east Manchurian front, and accordingly prepared for an invasion from the east. They believed that when an attack occurred from the west, the redeployed forces would be able to deal with it.

Although the Japanese redeployment in Manchukuo had begun, it was not due for completion until September 1945, and hence the Kwantung Army was in the midst of redeploying when the Soviets launched their attack simultaneously on all three fronts.

==Campaign==
The operation was carried out as a classic double pincer movement over an area the size of the entire Western European theatre of World War II. In the western pincer, the Red Army advanced over the deserts and mountains from Mongolia, far from their resupply railways. This confounded the Japanese military analysis of Soviet logistics, and the defenders were caught by surprise in unfortified positions. The Kwantung Army commanders were engaged in a planning exercise at the time of the invasion, and were away from their forces for the first eighteen hours of conflict.

The Russians treated the Japanese with the utmost cruelty after their deadly attack on Japan&#x27;s Kwantung Army in Manchuria just days before Japan&#x27;s surrender. Japanese forces were overwhelmed by Soviet attacks. Soviet paratroopers destroyed the Kwantung Army from behind its own lines, while Japanese anti-tank shells bounced off the sides of Soviet tanks. The Japanese forces in Manchuria retreated in fear.

Japanese troops and able-bodied Japanese men in Manchuria were taken prisoner by the Russians and transported to labor camps in Siberia, where many Japanese men would die. From the Russians&#x27; perspective, this was seen as revenge for Russia&#x27;s defeat in the Russo-Japanese War of 1905. The stories of how poorly the Soviets treated the Japanese were brought to Beijing by Japanese evacuees of Manchuria, creating panic among the Japanese population; however, the Russians honored their agreement with Chiang Kai-shek by not entering China proper.

Japanese communication infrastructure was poor, and the Japanese lost communication with forward units very early on. However, the Kwantung Army had a formidable reputation as fierce and relentless fighters, and even though understrength and unprepared, put up strong resistance at the town of Hailar which tied down some of the Soviet forces. The Japanese defenders held out until 18 August, when 3,827 survivors surrendered. At the same time, Soviet airborne units seized airfields and city centers in advance of the land forces, and aircraft ferried fuel to those units that had outrun their supply lines.

Due to Japanese 37mm and 47mm anti-tank guns being only suitable for fighting light Soviet tanks, Japanese forces decided to use suicide bomber squads strapped with grenades and explosives as their main improvised anti-tank weapon.

Japanese Army aviation employed several kamikaze attacks to strike Soviet armoured targets and fortifications in attempt to stop the Soviet advance.

Nevertheless, the prospect of a quick defeat to the Japanese Army seemed far from clear. Given the fanatical and sometimes suicidal resistance put up by the Japanese forces similar in April–June 1945 Battle of Okinawa, there was every reason to believe that a long, difficult campaign for the capture of the last remaining Japanese fortified areas was expected. In some parts of the Soviet offensive these expectations were fulfilled.

The Soviet pincer from the East crossed the Ussuri and advanced around Khanka Lake and attacked towards Suifenhe, and although Japanese defenders fought hard and provided strong resistance, the Soviets proved overwhelming.
After a week of fighting, during which time Soviet forces had penetrated deep into Manchukuo, Japan&#x27;s Emperor Hirohito recorded the &quot;Gyokuon-hōsō&quot; which was broadcast on radio to the Japanese nation on 15 August 1945. It made no direct reference to a surrender of Japan, instead stating that the government had been instructed to accept the terms of the Potsdam Declaration fully. This created confusion in the minds of many listeners who were not sure if Japan had surrendered. The poor audio quality of the radio broadcast, as well as the formal courtly language in which the speech was composed, worsened the confusion.

The Imperial Japanese Army Headquarters did not immediately communicate the cease-fire order to the Kwantung Army, and many elements of the army either did not understand it, or ignored it. Hence, pockets of fierce resistance from the Kwantung Army continued, and the Soviets continued their advance, largely avoiding the pockets of resistance, reaching Mukden, Changchun and Qiqihar by 20 August. The cease-fire order was eventually communicated to the Kwantung Army, but not before the Soviets had made most of their territorial gains.
On the Soviet right flank, the Soviet-Mongolian Cavalry-Mechanized Group entered Inner Mongolia and quickly took Dolon Nur and Kalgan. The Emperor of Manchukuo (and former Emperor of China), Puyi, was captured by the Red Army.

On August 18, several Soviet amphibious landings were conducted ahead of the land advance: three landings in northern Korea, one landing in South Sakhalin, and one landing in the Kuril Islands. This meant that, in Korea at least, there were already Soviet soldiers waiting for the troops coming overland. In South Sakhalin and the Kurils, it meant a sudden establishment of Soviet sovereignty.

The land advance was stopped a good distance short of the Yalu River, the start of the Korean Peninsula, when even aerial supply became unavailable. The forces already in Korea were able to establish control in the peninsula&#x27;s northern area. In accordance with arrangements made earlier with the American government to divide the Korean Peninsula, Soviet forces stopped at the 38th parallel, leaving the Japanese still in control of the southern part of the peninsula. Later, on 8 September 1945, American forces landed at Incheon.

==Aftermath==
The invasion of Manchuria was a factor that contributed to the surrender of Japan and the end of World War II. 

In September 1945, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) dispatched soldiers to Soviet-occupied Manchuria. The CCP obtained Japanese arms with Soviet help. The Soviet stance regarding the CCP and the Chinese Nationalists oscillated during this period, and in November 1945 the Soviet Union requested that the CCP withdraw from major cities in Manchuria.

The Soviet occupation of Manchuria, along with the northern portions of the Korean Peninsula, allowed for parts of those regions to be transferred by the Soviet Union into the control of local communists after the Soviet withdrawal in 1946 in spite of a 1945 agreement signed between the Soviets and the Kuomintang. The control of these regions by communist governments backed by Soviet authorities would be a factor in the rise of the CCP and shape the political conflict of the Korean War.

Several thousand Japanese who were sent as colonizers to Manchukuo and Inner Mongolia were left behind in China. The majority of Japanese left behind in China were women, and these Japanese women mostly married Chinese men and became known as &quot;stranded war wives&quot; (zanryu fujin). Because they had children fathered by Chinese men, Japanese women were not allowed to bring their Chinese families back with them to Japan, so most of them stayed. Japanese nationality laws allowed only children fathered by Japanese fathers to become Japanese citizens.

In late 1949, numerous members of the former Kwantung Army who had been captured in the Soviet invasion of Manchuria were convicted in connection with the activities of Unit 731, and related units for their connections with crimes against humanity and the use of chemical and biological weapons.

==War crimes==

During the invasion of Manchuria, Soviet soldiers killed and raped Japanese civilians. The most famous example was the Gegenmiao massacre, Soviet soldiers from an armoured unit massacred over one thousand Japanese women and children. Property of the Japanese were also looted by the Soviet troops. Soviet forces responsible for the massacre had carried out the same crimes against civilians in East Prussia.

According to Soviet historian Vyacheslav Zimonin, many Japanese settlers committed mass suicide as the Red Army approached. Mothers were forced by the Japanese military to kill their own children before being killed themselves. The Japanese army often took part in the killings of its civilians. The commander of the 5th Japanese Army, General Shimizu, commented that &quot;each nation lives and dies by its own laws.&quot; Wounded Japanese soldiers who were incapable of moving on their own were often left to die as the army retreated.

British and U.S. reports indicate that the Soviet troops that occupied Manchuria (about 700,000) also looted and terrorized the local people of Mukden and were not discouraged by Soviet authorities from &quot;three days of rape and pillage.&quot; In Harbin, Soviet forces ignored protests from Chinese Communist Party leaders on the mass rape and looting. There were several incidents in which Chinese police forces in Manchuria arrested or even killed Soviet troops for committing various crimes, leading to some conflicts between the Soviet and Chinese authorities in Manchuria.

During the Soviet occupation of North Korea, it was reported that Soviet soldiers committed rape against both Japanese and Korean women alike in the northern half of the Korean peninsula. Soviet soldiers also looted the property of both Japanese and Koreans living in northern Korea. The Soviets laid claim to Japanese enterprises in Manchuria and northern Korea and took valuable materials and industrial equipment.

Konstantin Asmolov of the Center for Korean Research of the Russian Academy of Sciences dismisses Western accounts of Soviet violence against civilians in the Far East as exaggeration and rumor and contends that accusations of mass crimes by the Red Army inappropriately extrapolate isolated incidents regarding the nearly 2,000,000 Soviet troops in the Far East into mass crimes. According to him, such accusations are refuted by the documents of the time, from which it is clear that such crimes were far less of a problem than in Germany. Asmolov further asserts that the Soviets prosecuted their perpetrators while prosecution of German and Japanese &quot;rapists and looters&quot; in WWII was virtually unknown.

Japanese women in Manchukuo were repeatedly raped by Russian soldiers every day including underage girls from the families of Japanese who worked for the military and the Manchukuo rail at Beian airport and Japanese military nurses. The Russians seized Japanese civilian girls at Beian airport where there were a total of 1,000 Japanese civilians, repeatedly raping 10 girls each day as recalled by Yoshida Reiko and repeatedly raped 75 Japanese nurses at the Sunwu military hospital in Manchukuo during the occupation. The Russians rejected all the pleading by the Japanese officers to stop the rapes. The Japanese were told by the Russians that they had to give their women for rape as war spoils.

Soviet soldiers raped Japanese women from a group of Japanese families that were with Yamada Tami that attempted to flee their settlements in 14 August and go to Mudanjiang. Another group of Japanese women that were with Ikeda Hiroko that on 15 August tried to flee to Harbin but returned to their settlements were raped by Soviet soldiers.

<text>In New Zealand, Crown Research Institutes (CRIs) are corporatised Crown entities charged with conducting scientific research. In January 2025, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon announced plans to merge the existing crown research institutes into three new public research organisations (PROs).

==History==
Crown Research Institutes date from 1992, with most formed out of parts of the former Department of Scientific and Industrial Research (DSIR) and of elements of various government departments. The dissolution of the DSIR, along with the government-imposed requirement that the CRIs become &quot;financially viable&quot; and operate on commercial lines, created a certain amount of resentment among some scientists.

On 23 January 2025, Prime Minister Christopher Luxon announced that the seven existing CRIs would be merged into three new public research organisations (PRO):
*Earth Science: the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), MetService (which would be merged into NIWA), and GNS Science;
*Bioeconomy: AgResearch, Landcare Research, New Zealand Institute for Plant and Food Research and Scion
*Health and Forensic Science: Institute of Environmental Science and Research will be reorganised
*A fourth PRO focusing on advanced technology
*Callaghan Innovation would be dissolved and its functions moved to other organisations.

The Minister of Science, Innovation and Technology Judith Collins described these reforms as the &quot;largest reset of New Zealand&#x27;s science system in more than 30 years.&quot; Note the current themes are placeholders as the new organisation names have yet to be decided by the transition team.

==Mandate and functions==
The Crown Research Institutes Act 1992 states the purpose of a CRI as carrying out research, and that each CRI must do this for the benefit of New Zealand, pursuing excellence in all that it does, abiding by ethical standards and recognising social responsibility; and operating as a good employer. A CRI must do these things whilst remaining financially viable. The technical definition of financial viability changes from time to time, but focused on return on equity. The State does not expect CRIs to maximise profit, but simply to cover the costs of capital. This formula aims to ensure appropriate commercial disciplines whilst fulfilling scientific purposes.

The State charges CRIs with promoting the transfer and dissemination of research, science and technology. In other words, they have the role of &quot;making a difference&quot; with the research they produce. They do this via strategic, long-term relationships with sectors (the CRI Act set up most of the CRIs with a sector-orientation), to support, sustain, challenge and develop existing sectors and also to lead development of new sectors.

== Governance and administration ==
CRIs were originally governed under a standalone Act, the Crown Research Institutes Act 1992. In 2004, as part of a wider reform of government entities, they were brought under the Crown Entities Act 2004 as a type of crown-entity company.

The New Zealand Government — via two Cabinet Ministers (the Minister of Research, Science and Technology and the Minister of Finance) — holds all shares in each CRI. Cabinet appoints a Board for each CRI. Each Board — intended to comprise business, &quot;professional&quot; and science expertise — operates according to the Companies Act as well as the CRI Act (1992) and other relevant Acts. Each Board produces an annual report and reports to the Crown Company Monitoring Advisory Unit (CCMAU), (part of The Treasury), which represents the shareholders. Parliament also scrutinises each CRI on an annual basis.

Day-to-day, however, CRIs operate as any commercial company would, acting within their strategic statement of intent (agreed with the shareholding Ministers) that aligns with the CRI Act purpose and principles.

The CRIs, along with Callaghan Innovation, cooperate as Science New Zealand. The Cawthron Institute is privately owned and operates independently but engages in partnerships with relevant CRIs, particularly in the aquaculture and seafood research. The Malaghan Institute of Medical Research is a registered charity which operates independently to the government but like CRIs relied on industry partnerships and government research grants.

== Funding ==
The Non-Specific Output Fund (NSOF) provided CRIs with some independent public-good research-funding streams from 1992 to 2005. The CRI Capability Fund (CF) replaced NSOF as from 1 July 2005. It provided public funding to maintain, enhance, and foster current or new capabilities. In 2010, the Government provided each CRI with core funding to deliver outcomes for the benefit of New Zealand. Core funding gives CRIs greater financial certainty and comprises a significant proportion of total funding available to CRIs.

== List of CRIs ==

As of July 2024, there are seven active Crown Research Institutes. Callaghan Innovation is also included in some circumstances and they attend some joint meetings.


The Institute For Social Research and Development (known as NZISRD or SR&amp;D or &quot;Te Kura Kōkiri, Rangahau-ā-Iwi o Aotearoa&quot;) was disestablished in 1995 after failing to achieve financial viability. (Not be confused with the UN agency of similar name.)

<text>Barrel cacti are various members of the two genera &quot;Echinocactus&quot; and &quot;Ferocactus&quot;, endemic to the deserts of Southwestern North America southward to north central Mexico. Some of the largest specimens are found in the Sonoran Desert.

==Description==
Some species of barrel cactus reach over in height at maturity, and have been known to reach in some regions. The ribs are numerous and pronounced, and the spines are long and can range in color from yellow to tan to red, depending on the age of the plant and the species. Flowers appear at the top of the plant only after many years. The barrel cactus can live to be over 100 years old.

Barrel cactus buds typically start to bloom in April with a bright yellow or orange flower. Pink and red varieties also exist but occur less frequently. The flowers only appear on the very top of the plant. As the flowers begin to wilt in early May, they may change color. A late summer desert rainstorm can produce a late bloom, as shown in the photograph below of the orange-flowered variety (it bloomed two days after a hurricane in mid-August and continued to bloom through the end of September).

===Fruit===
As the flowers wilt away, small pineapple-shaped greenish fruit may form. Left untouched, the fruit has been known to last a full calendar year. The fruit can be easily removed but is not usually consumed because it is fairly dry and bitter.

==Facts==

Native Americans collected the fruit as emergency food during extreme drought conditions.

The Seri people distinguished three species of barrel cactus:
* Saguaro barrel cactus — &quot;Ferocactus cylindraceus&quot;
* &quot;Siml caacöl&quot; (big barrel cactus), &quot;siml cöquicöt&quot; (killer barrel cactus) — &quot;Ferocactus emoryi&quot;
* &quot;Siml áa&quot; (true barrel cactus) — &quot;Ferocactus wislizeni&quot;

In Mexico the flesh of the barrel cactus is candied and eaten as a treat.

==Cultivation==
Barrel cacti are cultivated by plant nurseries as an ornamental plant. They are considered easy to grow and relatively fast growing. They may produce round offshoots.

Barrel cacti can fall over because they grow based on sun orientation. They usually grow towards the south to prevent surface tissue sunburn, giving the name &quot;compass cactus.&quot;

<text>The Cycles of the Kings or Kings&#x27; Cycles, sometimes called the Historical Cycle, are a body of Old and Middle Irish literature. They comprise legends about historical and semi-historical kings of Ireland (such as &quot;Buile Shuibhne&quot;, &quot;The Madness of King Suibhne&quot;), stories about the origins of dynasties and peoples (such as &quot;The Expulsion of the Déisi&quot;), accounts of significant battles (such as &quot;Battle of Mag Mucrama&quot;), as well as anecdotes that explain rites and customs. It is one of the four main groupings of early Irish sagas, along with the Mythological Cycle, the Ulster Cycle and the Fianna Cycle.

The kings that are included range from the almost entirely fictional Labraid Loingsech, who allegedly became High King in the 4th century BC, to the entirely historical Brian Boru. Other kings include Cormac mac Airt, Niall of the Nine Hostages, Conall Corc, Diarmait mac Cerbaill, Lugaid mac Con, Conn of the Hundred Battles, Lóegaire mac Néill and Crimthann mac Fidaig. It was part of the duty of the medieval Irish bards, or court poets, to record the history of the family and the genealogy of the king they served. This they did in poems that blended the mythological and the historical to a greater or lesser degree.

One of the most famous legends is the &quot;Buile Shuibhne&quot;, a 12th-century tale told in verse and prose. Suibhne, king of Dál nAraidi, was cursed by St Ronan Finn and became a kind of half-man, half-bird, condemned to live out his life in the woods, fleeing from his human companions. The story has captured the imaginations of contemporary Irish poets and has been translated by Trevor Joyce and Seamus Heaney.

<doc id="1085242" wikidata="Q106848" url="?curid=1085242" title="Teresa, Rizal">
<text>Teresa, officially the Municipality of Teresa (), is a municipality in the province of Rizal, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 64,072 people.

Most of the people here are Tagalogs. Teresa is primarily known for the nearby mountain resorts, Villa Sampaguita Resort and Real Cove Resort (Formerly Sunrise Resort, Sunset Resort, and Terra Villa Resort).

Land uses (in hectares): Commercial (1.92), Residential (104.32), Agricultural (1183.35), Protected areas (13,952.41), Industrial / Ecozone (710.69), Institutional (112.28), and Special / Other uses (123.03).

The town&#x27;s festivals are the Turumba sa Mahal na Patron Santa Rosa (held every August 23), Anniversary celebration of town independence (every December 30), and Town fiesta (every 1st Sunday of March).

== History ==

Teresa was first named &quot;Oroquieta&quot; and was a barrio of the Municipality of Morong. As a non-independent town its name was changed to &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; in honor of the town&#x27;s patron saint, St. Rose of Lima. Against the will of its people, Santa Rosa was annexed to Antipolo, which led to animosity between the two towns. Most of the residents preferred to be under jurisdiction of Morong.

Unstable conditions led militant leaders such as Messra. San Esteban, Santo Domingo, Pio Piriquiquit Santos, Raymundo Francisco, Mariano Celo Francisco, Diego P. Cruz, Santiago P. Cruz, Sabino de Ramos, Platon Gonzales, Brigido Capli Cruz,Lorenzo Capli Cruz, Saturnino Francisco, and Francisco Natividad to clamor for independence. In 1877, the Spanish lawyer Don Mariano Rodriguez Candelaria assisted the people in appealing to the Spanish Governor-General for separate ownership. The appeal was given preferential attention, and Santa Rosa was later declared an independent town. In 1900, the people agreed to change the name from Santa Rosa to &quot;Teresa&quot; in honor of the Spanish lawyer&#x27;s mother, Doña Teresa Candelaria.

In 1903, when rebellion broke out, Teresa was again annexed to the Municipality of Antipolo. In 1917, the able men of the town again moved for independence with the help of the Rizal Governor Eulogio Rodriguez, Sr. This move, however, failed due to political reasons.

With the help extended by Senator Rafael Palma, the independence of Teresa was approved and declared by the Governor-General Charles E. Yeater on January 1, 1919, through Executive Order No. 57 (signed December 16, 1918). Roberto de Jesus was appointed as the first &quot;Municipal President&quot; (known as &quot;Mayor&quot; today). Functioning as a town, Teresa comprised three barrios at the time: May-Iba, Pantay, and San Roque.

After three years of independence, the town acquired a municipal building on November 8, 1921, which was called &quot;Presedencia&quot;. Paulino de la Rosa was the second Municipal President of Teresa, Rizal. During his term the elementary school building (located in Dalig) was inaugurated. His portrait hangs proudly as the first in the grand entrance of the municipal building in Teresa, Rizal.

== Geography ==
Teresa is situated in the slopes of the Sierra Madre Mountains and is bordered on four corners by Antipolo on the north, Angono on the west, Tanay, on the east, and Morong, on the south. The town is passed by motorists bounded for the more inland towns of Morong, Baras, Tanay, Pililla, and Laguna and Quezon provinces.

Contrary to some articles, Teresa is actually a valley surrounded by mountains. The town center is located almost at the center of the valley. In an aerial view of Teresa, one would notice the previously vast expanse of agricultural land bordered by marble-rich mountains.

=== Barangays ===

Teresa is politically subdivided into 9 barangays. Each barangay consists of puroks and some have sitios.
* Bagumbayan
* Dalig
* Dulumbayan
* May-Iba
* Poblacion
* Prinza
* San Gabriel
* San Roque
* Calumpang Santo Cristo

As of the year 2010, there was a proposal to name the eastern section of the municipality as a 10th barangay (the area from the Marcos Highway towards General Nakar in Quezon Province). However, the area is part of the disputed political claim among the municipalities of Morong, Teresa, Baras, and Tanay.

=== Climate ===
== Demographics ==

In the 2020 census, the population of Teresa, Rizal, was 64,072 people, with a density of .

Major religious denominations: Roman Catholic (75%), Iglesia Ni Cristo (12%), Protestant (2%), Islam (1%), and Others (10%)

== Economy ==
Formerly, the predominant source of livelihood in Teresa is agriculture. But with the opening of the Republic Cement Factory (Formerly FR Cement Factory), Teresa Marble Corporation, and ABC Chemical Factory, members of the community have slowly shifted to industry. More, the real estate boom in the 90s caused a surge in the population in Teresa with the opening of the Carissa Homes East 1 (CHE-1 in Bagumbayan) &amp; 2 (CHE-2 in San Gabriel and Dalig) subdivisions and the La Hacienda, La Montagna and Palazzo Estates located at the highlands of Barangay Bagumbayan.

Annual income is P 85,548,638.56 from manufacturing (cement, marble, limestone quarrying), agro-industrial (piggery and poultry farms), and operation of economic enterprises (public market, slaughter house, sukol spring resort, MRF).

== Infrastructure ==
Basic facilities include 2 hospitals, 10 clinics, and 1 public market.

Power is supplied by the Manila Electric Company. Water supply is through the municipal Teresa Water District (TERWD) and Buhay Na Tubig Multi-Purpose Cooperative.

Educational institutions consist of 1 university and college, 8 high schools, and 12 elementary schools.

<doc id="1085251" wikidata="Q709066" url="?curid=1085251" title="Arthur D. Little">
<text>Arthur D. Little is an international management consulting firm originally headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, United States, founded in 1886 and formally incorporated in 1909 by Arthur Dehon Little, an MIT chemist who extended the applications of cellulose acetate, especially its use as artificial silk. Arthur D. Little pioneered the concept of contracted professional services. The company played key roles in the development of business strategy, operations research, the word processor, the first synthetic penicillin, LexisNexis, SABRE, and NASDAQ. Today the company is a multinational management consulting firm operating as a partnership.

== Early history ==


The roots of the company were started in 1886 by Arthur Dehon Little, an MIT chemist, and co-worker Roger B. Griffin (Russell B. Griffin), another chemist and a graduate of the University of Vermont who had met when they both worked for Richmond Paper Company. Their new company, Little &amp; Griffin, was located in Boston where MIT was then located. Griffin and Little prepared a manuscript for &quot;The Chemistry of Paper-making&quot; which was for many years an authoritative text in the area. The book had not been entirely finished when Griffin was killed in a laboratory accident in 1893.

Little, who had studied Chemistry at MIT, collaborated with MIT and William Hultz Walker of the MIT Chemistry department, forming a partnership, Little &amp; Walker, which lasted from 1900 to 1905, while both MIT and Little&#x27;s company were still located in Boston. The partnership dissolved in 1905 when Walker dedicated all of his time to being in charge of the new Research Laboratory of Applied Chemistry at MIT.

Little continued on his own and incorporated the company, Arthur D. Little (ADL), in 1909. He conducted analytical studies, the precursor of the consulting studies for which the firm would later become famous. He also taught papermaking at MIT from 1893 to 1916.

In 1917, the company, originally based at 103 Milk Street in Boston, moved to its own building, the Arthur D. Little Inc., Building, at 30 Memorial Drive on the Charles River next to the new campus of MIT, which had also relocated from Boston to Cambridge. 
The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.
In November 1953, ADL opened a 40-acre site for its Acorn Park labs in west Cambridge, Massachusetts, about 6 miles (10 km) from MIT. The new site took its name from the company motto - &quot;Glandes Sparge Ut Quercus Crescant,&quot; translated as &quot;Scatter Acorns That Oaks May Grow.&quot; The Memorial Drive Trust, a tax-exempt retirement trust for the benefit of its employees, was set up.

== Seminal projects ==

As the pioneer firm in professional services, Arthur D. Little played a key role in numerous 20th-century business initiatives:

In 1911 ADL organized General Motors&#x27; first R&amp;D lab, leading to the formation of the firm&#x27;s dedicated management consulting division, and the birth of the management consulting industry.

In 1916 ADL was commissioned by the Canadian Pacific Railway to do a survey of Canada&#x27;s natural resources.

In 1921 the firm succeeded in using a bucket of sows&#x27; ears to make a silk purse. This revolutionary achievement later became part of the Smithsonian Institute&#x27;s collection.

In 1968 ADL designed the NASDAQ stock exchange systems for London and Tokyo.

In 1969 ADL developed the Apollo 11 Laser Ranging Retro-Reflector experiment which were installed on the Moon as part of the Apollo 11 mission and which remains active and functioning to this day.

In 1980, ADL produced the European Commission&#x27;s first white paper on telecommunications deregulation, having completed the first worldwide telecommunications database on phones installed, markets, technical trends, services and regulatory information. It also helped privatize British Rail, generally regarded as one of the most complex privatization exercises in the world.

== The Altran era ==
By 2001, Arthur D. Little reached its peak as a global consulting firm with very significant growth in the technology sector. However, a new management team mismanaged the company&#x27;s core business and engaged in manipulation of the Memorial Drive Trust. The ADL Board of Trustees replaced this management team. But the damage had been done, and combined with the impact of the dot.com bubble on technology sector activity this led Arthur D. Little to file Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 2002. At an auction in 2002, TIAX LLC, formed by Kenan Sahin, acquired the assets, contracts, and staff of Arthur D. Little&#x27;s U.S. Technology &amp; Innovation business. Paris-based Altran Technologies bought the non-U.S. assets and brand name of Arthur D. Little.

Under Altran&#x27;s ownership, Arthur D. Little operated primarily as a European-centric company initially, rebuilding and strengthening its core practices in oil and gas, telecommunications, automotive, manufacturing, and chemicals. It did however maintain offices in Boston and Houston in the USA. Later ADL grew and expanded throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Asia and continued to be recognized for its expertise in areas combining aspects of technology, innovation, and strategy.

== Refounding - current partnership organization ==

A group of partners led a management buyout from the Altran group in 2011. The MBO was completed on 30 December 2011 with the vast majority of ADL directors becoming partners and shareholders. A small number of senior principals, as well as the CFO and COO, also became shareholders. The firm is led by the elected Global CEO, Ignacio Garcia-Alves, who was also the leader of the MBO team. Currently the firm operates with an elected board of directors and several elected committees - Compensation Committee, Partnership Committee, and an Audit Committee. 
In the five years following the 2011 MBO, ADL opened new offices in Turkey, Oslo, Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Singapore, Hong Kong, Beirut, Riyadh, Prague and Bahrain. In addition, ADL recently re-established itself in the US market and has opened offices in Boston, New York, and San Francisco. In March 2021 Arthur D. Little announced it had reached a milestone of over 100 partners. Growth accelerated after this milestone, with the company reaching 150 partners roughly two years later. 
In March 2022 Arthur D. Little terminated its operations in Russia and closed its Moscow office.

==Practice areas==
Arthur D. Little is organized across a number of industry specialty groups including Aerospace &amp; Defense, Automotive, Chemicals, Consumer Goods &amp; Retail, Energy &amp; Utilities, Financial Services, Healthcare &amp; Life Sciences, Industrial Goods &amp; Services, Oil &amp; Gas, Private Equity, Public Services, Telecommunications, Information Technology, Media &amp; Electronics (TIME), Travel &amp; Transportation. 

Major service lines are in Corporate Finance, Digital Transformation, Digital Problem Solving, Operations and Risk Management, Strategy and Organisation, Sustainability, Innovation Management.

In 1987, ADL claimed that sabotage was likely the cause of the Bhopal disaster, which resulted in the death of thousands. ADL&#x27;s investigation was funded by Union Carbide, the company that owned the chemical plant responsible for the chemical disaster.
Analysis by Arthur D. Little argues that the Negligence argument was impossible for several tangible reasons.

In 2001, ADL wrote a Philip Morris-funded report saying that smoking can help Czech economy: Public Finance Balance of Smoking in the Czech Republic.

In 2010 Booz &amp; Co (now Strategy&amp; owned by PWC) claimed they were the &quot;oldest Management Consulting firm still in business&quot;. Following some pushback in the industry this claim has been dropped following Booz &amp; Co&#x27;s rebranding as Strategy&amp;.

<text>The Jetex motor is a miniature solid-fuel rocket motor produced for use as a powerplant for flying model aircraft. Its production led to a number of imitators and, after its discontinuation, successors of similar type.

== Original Jetex motors ==
Jetex was developed in 1947, by Wilmot, Mansour &amp; Company Ltd of Southampton, which had started operations in a decommissioned hangar at RAF Beaulieu. The first motor was demonstrated in early 1948 and was available to the public in June 1948, when &quot;Aeromodeller&quot; magazine featured Jetex power on its front cover. The first motors were the Jetex 100 and 200, with the more powerful Jetex 350 following in November 1948. The most popular motor, the Jetex 50, was introduced in May 1949, along with kits for a model plane and model car using Jetex power. The subsequent popularity of Jetex led to the manufacture of numerous kits by third-party companies such as KeilKraft and Skyleada.

Jetex motors are powered by a solid pellet consisting mainly of guanidine nitrate, which burns to release an exhaust gas in large volume, leaving little solid residue. Thrust developed is modest and sustained, making it suitable for aerodynamically lifted flying models. The exhaust gas is not excessively hot, which confers a safety advantage.

Motors are loaded with one or more solid fuel pellets and a combustible &#x27;wick&#x27; is led through the exhaust nozzle to ignite the fuel. Fuel and wick were manufactured by Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI). The engine casing of the early motors is made of an aluminium alloy. On introduction, fuel pellets and wick could be purchased separately, meaning that the system is reusable.

Jetex power made a big impact in the late 1940s and early 1950s, allowing new sorts of models, scale and duration, to be designed. During the 1960s, Jetex propellant pellets found another use by AP Films/Century 21, in their &#x27;Supermarionation&#x27; TV series, when they were fitted to the undersides of miniature ground vehicles to emit jets of gas resembling dust trails. 

Jetex went through a change of ownership in the mid 1950s. Gradually its popularity waned. Ron Baddorf speculated that the development of radio control and the increasing reliability and power of diesel motors caused a lack of interest in &quot;the little Jetex&quot;.

== Jetex imitators and successors ==

=== Velojet ===

The Velojet 50 and its larger sibling, the Velojet 100, were New Zealand designed and manufactured. They used standard Jetex fuel and had a safety pressure release at the front in the form of a disc against a pre-tensioned coil spring.

=== Jet-X ===
In 1986, Powermax in the UK launched a range of newly formulated size 50 fuel and wick under the Jet-X brand. In the latter half of the 1990s, the company introduced their own &#x27;Z&#x27; series motors, corresponding to the original Jetex 35, 50 and 100. From August 1995 Jet-X motors, fuel and fuse were commercially imported into the US. &quot;Flying Models&quot; told its readers that &quot;safe and viable rocket power for model airplanes is back&quot;.

=== Rapier ===
Around the new millennium, a new non-reusable motor, called Rapier, was introduced. It has similar weight, thrust and duration to Jetex, allowing many old plans for Jetex powered models to be built and flown with the new motors. The Rapier is a single use motor with a cardboard case and a ceramic nozzle, visually closer to a model rocket motor than the original reloadable Jetex.

=== Tendera ===
In early 2020, another range of non-reusable motors was introduced, called Tendera. These are similar to the Rapiers, being one-time use motors having cardboard cases and ceramic nozzles.

<doc id="1085258" wikidata="Q1181974" url="?curid=1085258" title="Guard hair">
<text>Guard hair or overhair is the outer layer of hair of most mammals, which overlay the fur. Guard hairs are long and coarse and protect the rest of the pelage (fur) from abrasion and frequently from moisture. They are visible on the surface of the fur and usually lend a characteristic contour and colour pattern. Underneath the contour hair is the short, dense, fine down. There are three types of guard hair: awns, bristles, and spines.

== Description ==
Guard hair (overhair) is the top or outer layer of the coat. Guard hairs are longer, generally coarser, and have nearly straight shafts that protrude through the layer of softer down hair. The distal end of the guard hair is the visible layer of most mammal coats. The guard hair is spread over most of the skin, constitutes the main mass of the fur, and gives the contour and color of the fur, from the combinations in different percentages of two pigments: brown and black eumelanin, and yellow and red pheomelanin. This layer has the most marked pigmentation and gloss, manifesting as coat markings that are adapted for camouflage or display. Guard hair repels water and blocks sunlight, protecting the undercoat and skin in wet or aquatic habitats, and from the sun&#x27;s ultraviolet radiation. Guard hairs can also reduce the severity of cuts or scratches to the skin. Many mammals, such as the domestic dog and cat, have a pilomotor reflex that raises their guard hairs as part of a threat display when agitated.

== Types of guard hair ==
The three major types of guard hair recognized are awns, spines and bristles, although intermediates between these types are known.

=== Awn ===
Awn hair is the most common type of guard hair, characterized by an expanded distal end, a thin base, and definitive growth. The shafts of the awn are thick and usually spindle-shaped (or blade- or shieldlike), thinning gradually at the tip. Spindle-shaped portion is hard and usually differently colored. Awns usually lie in one direction, giving the pelage a distinct contour. This type of hair is found in carnivorans. In equids, cattle, and on the face and legs of sheep, the covering bristles are shorter, stiffer, straighter, and inconspicuously spindled.

=== Bristles ===
Bristles are firm, generally long hairs in equids and bovids, some carnivorans, etc., that grow continuously and form manes. The mane often varies by sex, serving to distinguish the sexes (sexual dimorphism). For example, male lions have a collar of long, hard outline hair that grows continuously and extends to the shoulders and forms a mane on the back of the neck. Bristles function as visual signals that augment facial expressions (e.g., lions) or body postures (e.g., horses).

=== Spines ===
The guard hairs are sometimes modified to form defensive spines. Spines are the stiff, enlarged guard hairs that exhibit definitive growth and form the protective quills of echidnas, hedgehogs and especially porcupines. In porcupines, the cuticular scales are elongate and form barbs that make it difficult to remove imbedded spines.

<text>Awn hairs are the intermediate hairs in a mammal&#x27;s coat. They are shorter than the guard hairs and longer than the down hairs. They help with insulation and protect the down hairs underneath. Most of the visible coat is made of this kind of hair.

Among rabbits, each guard hair is surrounded by a number of awn hairs. The awn hairs are slightly shorter, and have a flat (rather than pointed) tip. They also are slightly wavy and have a thinner cortex. Clustered around each awn hair are two more hair types, the awn wool and underwool.

Awn hair is also known as grannenhaare. Awn hairs are distally thicker in comparison to down hair and have a shift in the shape towards the top of the hair. There is another version of awn hair, known as grannenflaumhaare or down awn hair, which is thin and crimped like underfur towards the proximal end of the hair, while the thickened distal end resembles the corresponding part of a guard hair.

<text>Zolochiv (, ; ; ; ) is a small city in Lviv Oblast, western Ukraine, and the administrative center of Zolochiv Raion. It hosts the administration of Zolochiv urban hromada, one of the hromadas of Ukraine. The city is located east of Lviv along Highway H02 Lviv-Ternopil and the railway line Krasne-Ternopil. It has a population of covering an area of 

==History==
===Medieval settlement, Tatar invasion===
The site was occupied from AD 1180 under the name Radeche until the end of the 13th century when a wooden fort was constructed. This was burned in the 14th century during the invasion of the Crimean Tatars.

=== Polish town (1442) ===
In 1442, the city was founded as &quot;Złoczów&quot;, by John of Sienna, a Polish nobleman of the Dębno family although the first written mention of Zolochiv was in 1423.

By 1523, it was already a city of Magdeburg rights.

Zolochiv was incorporated as a town on 15 September 1523 by the Polish king Sigismund I the Old. Located in the Ruthenian Voivodship of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, it belonged to several noble families.

=== Austrian period (1772–1918) ===
From the first partition of Poland in 1772 until 1918, the town was part of the Austrian monarchy (Austria side after the compromise of 1867), head of the district with the same name, one of the 78 &quot;Bezirkshauptmannschaften&quot; in Austrian Galicia province, or &quot;Crown land&quot;, in 1900.

=== Interbellum: Polish Złoczów ===
From 15 March 1923 until the Invasion of Poland in 1939, when the town was occupied by the Soviet Union, Zolochiv, still named Złoczów, belonged to the Tarnopol Voivodship of the second Republic of Poland.

===World War Two===
====First Soviet occupation====
Zolochiv was occupied by the USSR from September 1939 to July 1941. At the Zolochiv prison they committed horrific atrocities against Ukrainian nationalists including priests.

====Nazi occupation====
After July 1941, Zolochiv was occupied by Germany and incorporated into the General Government in the District of Galicia.

On 27 June, the town and its surrounding vicinity was bombed by the Germans, causing panic. In the weeks prior the Germans had parachuted into the area.

On 1 July the Germans arrived in the town, rumours had been circulating of a massacre in the Old Polish Prison, a two-three storied building on Ternopil St. Many Ukrainian locals were able to identify their friends and loved ones amongst the victims. Several rows of corpses were lined up in a pit in the prison yard that was encrusted with blood and human flesh. People repeated that the NKVD had been running tractor engines during the massacre to quiet the noise of those being tortured.

Those clearing the yard had to work quickly, as due to the summer heat the bodies were decomposing and there was a risk of disease spreading. Inside the prison cells, Greek-Catholic priests were found with crosses carved into their chests. In one cell a pool of coagulated blood lay with numerous corpses that had been severely tortured.

One of the local Jews, named Shmulko, who had worked in the flour mill before the war but had joined the NKVD and worked at the prison upon the Soviet invasion, was captured near Sasiv. The individual was forced to show people the corpses of their relatives and friends and was then stoned to death. Before he died he confessed to a second burial pit, that people had suspected but could not find.

The Germans forced local Jews to clear the prison and clean the bodies of those killed and place them outside of the prison for further identification. After that, SS troops executed those Jewish people. No Ukrainians participated in those atrocities. 
According to a German Einsatzgruppen report in Zolochiv &quot;before the Russians fled . . . they arrested and killed in all about 700 Ukrainians. In retribution, the militia arrested several hundred Jews and shot them, on instructions from the Wehrmacht. The number of Jews killed was between 300 and 500.&quot; Then the killing spread beyond the fortress where the Ukrainians and Jews were shot. Within three to four days, around 1400 Jews had been killed. Later the Germans shot another 300.

Once they established their occupation administration, the Germans began to rob and persecute the Jews, including forcing them to do slave labor. The Germans also confiscated their homes and valuables. In August 1942, the Germans with the assistance of the Ukrainian police, rounded up about 2000 Jews and sent them to Belzec where they were immediately murdered. In November, the German and Ukrainian police rounded up another 2500 and sent them to be murdered in Belzec. Other Jews were shot in Zolochiv. After that, the Germans established a ghetto to which Zolochiv Jews were confined along with Jews from other villages who had been sent there. The ghetto, containing about 4000 people, was severely overcrowded and lacked sanitary facilities. Consequently, a typhus epidemic broke out. In April 1943, about 3500 Jews were taken by German and Ukrainian police to be shot at a pit near the village of Yelhovitsa. One German official, Josef Meyer, tried to protect Jews, hiding several. After the war, Yad Vashem awarded him, his wife and two daughters the title Righteous Among the Nations.

There are numerous recorded cases of local Ukrainians sheltering Jews within the town of Zolochiv and the surrounding provinces. The number of Jewish survivors is unknown.

In the spring of 1942, guerrillas from the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) ambushed a Nazi transportation of livestock to the Reich, killing one or more Nazis. There were immediate reprisals on local Ukrainian nationalists. The Gestapo was vigilant and focused on eliminating the OUN within and around Zolochiv. Numerous Ukrainian nationalists were imprisoned in the Gestapo headquarters in Zolochiv and were later transported to Lącki prison in Lviv, these included Ivan Lahola, Bohdan Kachur and Stepan Petelycky.

On 1 December 1942 a ghetto was established, confined within the ghetto was a brewery where beer continued to be produced. Between 7,500 and 9,000 people were imprisoned there, as well as remnants of communities of the surrounding areas, including Olesko, Sasov, and Biali Kamen. The ghetto was liquidated on 2 April 1943, and 6,000 people were murdered in a mass execution perpetrated by an Einsatzgruppen at a pit near the village of Yelhovitsa.

====Second Soviet occupation====
From July 1944 to 16 August 1945, the town was occupied by the Red Army.

===Soviet period===
After the Yalta Conference (4–11 February 1945), drawn as a consequence of the findings of the interim Government of national unity signed on August 16, 1945, an agreement with the USSR, recognising the slightly modified Curzon line for the Eastern Polish border, on the basis of the agreement on the border between the Soviet Union and Polish Committee of National Liberation Government on 27 July 1944. In the Tarnopol voivodeship agreements, Zolochiv was included in the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in the USSR, where it remained until 1991.

===Independent Ukraine===
Since 1991, Zolochiv has been part of independent Ukraine. On July 17, 2007, a man-made disaster occurred near Ozhydiv, 20 km from Zolochiv, when 50 meters of railroad track, about 100 meters of the contact network and three power poles were damaged as a result of a tanker derailment. The fire was extinguished by a cloud of combustion products (the affected area is about 90 km2). Evacuation from the affected area began. First, people from the nearest villages were evacuated, and others were evacuated on request. The situation was complicated by the fact that phosphorus cannot be extinguished with water.

On March 28, 2014, a living alley in memory of the Heavenly Hundred appeared in front of the administrative building of the Zolochiv District Council.

On June 9, 2015, a decision was made in Zolochiv to rename Tchaikovsky Street to Heavenly Hundred Heroes Street. The decision was voted for by 23 members of the city council. P. Tchaikovsky Street runs past Zolochiv School No. 1 and rests on a linden alley planted in front of the district state administration in honor of the Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred. By the way, Heavenly Hundred Heroes Street is located next to the Zolochiv Maidan, where the Viche took place during the Revolution of Dignity.

On June 14, 2022, during the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Zolochiv was hit by a missile attack. The missile (probably a Kalibr) was shot down by air defense systems, but the debris fell on the territory of the city, destroying a brick-making company and damaging nearby houses. Six people (including a one-year-old child) were also injured.

<doc id="1085270" wikidata="Q1991460" url="?curid=1085270" title="Ulaid">
<text>&#x27; (Old Irish, ) or &#x27; (Modern Irish, ) was a Gaelic over-kingdom in north-eastern Ireland during the Middle Ages made up of a confederation of dynastic groups. Alternative names include &#x27;, which is the Latin form of , and &#x27;, Irish for &#x27;the Fifth&#x27;. The king of Ulaid was called the or .

Ulaid also refers to a people of early Ireland, and it is from them that the province of Ulster derives its name. Some of the dynasties in the over-kingdom claimed descent from the Ulaid, but others are cited as being of Cruithin descent. In historical documents, the term Ulaid was used to refer to the population group of which the was the ruling dynasty. As such, the title held two meanings: over-king of the Kingdom of Ulaid and king of the Ulaid people, as in the .

The Ulaid feature prominently in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. According to legend, the ancient territory of Ulaid spanned the whole of the modern province of Ulster, excluding County Cavan, but including County Louth. Its southern border was said to stretch from the River Drowes in the west to the River Boyne in the east. At the onset of the historic period of Irish history in the 6th century, the territory of Ulaid was largely confined to east of the River Bann, as it is said to have lost land to the Airgíalla and the Northern Uí Néill. Ulaid ceased to exist after its conquest in the late 12th century by the Anglo-Norman knight John de Courcy, and was replaced with the Earldom of Ulster.

An individual from Ulaid was known in Irish as an , the nominative plural being .
This name lives on in the surname McAnulty or McNulty, from (&#x27;son of the Ulsterman&#x27;).

==Name==
Ulaid is a plural noun and originated as an ethnonym; however, Irish nomenclature followed a pattern where the names of population groups and apical ancestor figures became more and more associated with geographical areas even when the ruling dynasty had no links to that figure, and this was the case with the Ulaid. Ulaid was also known as &quot;Cóiced Ulad&quot;, the &quot;Fifth of Ulster&quot;, and was one of the legendary five provinces of Ireland. After the subsequent loss of territory to the Airgíalla and Northern Uí Néill, the eastern remnant of the province that formed medieval Ulaid was alternatively known as &quot;in Cóiced&quot;, in reference to the unconquered part of &quot;Cóiced Ulad&quot;.

The Ulaid are likely the Ούολουντιοι (&quot;Uoluntii&quot; or &quot;Voluntii&quot;) mentioned in Ptolemy&#x27;s 2nd century &quot;Geographia&quot;. This may be a corruption of Ούλουτοι (&quot;Uluti&quot;). The name is likely derived from the Gaelic &quot;ul&quot;, meaning &quot;beard&quot;. The late 7th-century writer, Muirchú, spells Ulaid as &quot;Ulothi&quot; in his work the &quot;Life of Patrick&quot;.

Ulaid has historically been anglicised as &quot;Ulagh&quot; or &quot;Ullagh&quot; and Latinized as &quot;Ulidia&quot; or &quot;Ultonia&quot;. The latter two have yielded the terms &quot;Ulidian&quot; and &quot;Ultonian&quot;. The Irish word for someone from Ulaid is &quot;Ultach&quot; (also spelt as &quot;Ultaigh&quot; and &quot;Ultagh&quot;), which in Latin became &quot;Ultonii&quot; and &quot;Ultoniensis&quot;.

Ulaid gave its name to the province of Ulster, though the exact composition of it is disputed: it may derive from &quot;Ulaidh&quot; with or without the Norse genitive &quot;s&quot; and Irish &quot;tír&quot; (&quot;land, country, earth&quot;), or else the second element may be Norse &quot;-ster&quot; (meaning &quot;place&quot;, common in Shetland and Norway).

The Ulaid are also referred to as being of the &quot;Clanna Rudraige&quot;, a late form of group name.

==Population groups within Ulaid==

According to historical tradition, the ruling dynasties of the Ulaid were either of the Ulaid population-group or the Cruthin. Medieval Irish genealogists traced the descent of the Ulaid from the legendary High King of Ireland, Rudraige mac Sithrigi. The Cruthin on the other hand is the Irish term for the Picts, and are stated as initially being the most powerful and numerous of the two groupings. The terms Ulaid and Cruthin in early sources referred to the Dál Fiatach and Dál nAraidi respectively, the most powerful dynasties of both groups.

The general scholarly consensus since the time of Eoin MacNeill has been that the Ulaid were kin to the Érainn, or at least to their royal families, sometimes called the Clanna Dedad, and perhaps not their nebulous subject populations. T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly notably believed the Ulaid were an actual branch of the Érainn. Also claimed as being related to the Ulaid are the Dáirine, another name for the Érainn royalty, both of which may have been related or derived from the Darini of Ptolemy.

There is uncertainty however over the actual ancestry of the people and dynasties within the medieval over-kingdom of Ulaid. Those claimed as being descended from the Ulaid people included medieval tribes that were said to be instead of the Cruthin or Érainn, for example:
*the Dál Riata, Dál Fiatach, and Uí Echach Arda are counted as being of the Ulaid. The Dál Riata and Dál Fiatach however professed to be of Érainn descent. Despite this the term Ulaid still referred to the Dál Fiatach until the Anglo-Norman conquest of the over-kingdom in the late 12th century.
*the Conaille Muirtheimne, Dál nAraidi and Uí Echach Cobo are counted as being of the Cruthin. However, after the 8th century, the &quot;Síl Ír&quot;—the book of genealogies on the descendants of the mythical Ír—focuses on the theme that they are the &quot;fír Ulaid&quot;, &quot;the true Ulaid&quot;. The Dál nAraidi still maintained the claim in the 10th century, long after their power declined.

==History of the over-kingdom==

===Early history===
Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Geographia&quot;, written in the 2nd century, places the &quot;Uoluntii&quot; or &quot;Voluntii&quot; in the southeast of what is now Ulster, somewhere south of the River Lagan and north of the River Boyne. To their north were the Darini and to their south were the Eblani. Muirchú&#x27;s &quot;Life of Patrick&quot;, written in the 7th century, also says that the territory of the &quot;Ulothi&quot; lay between the Lagan and the Boyne. In the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology—which survives in texts from the 8th century onward—the pre-historic Ulaid are said to dominate the whole north of Ireland, their southern border stretching from the River Boyne in the east to the River Drowes in the west, with their capital at Emain Macha (Navan Fort) near present-day Armagh, County Armagh. According to legend, around 331 AD the Three Collas invaded Ulaid, destroyed its ancient capital Emain Macha, and restricted Ulaid to the eastern part of its territory: east of the Lower Bann and Newry River. It is said that the territory the Three Collas conquered became the kingdom of Airgíalla. Another tradition that survived until the 11th century dated the fall of Emain Macha to 450 AD—within the time of Saint Patrick—which may explain why he chose Armagh, near Emain Macha, as the site of his episcopacy, as it would then still be under Ulaid control. It may also explain why he was buried in eastern Ulster in the restricted territory of the Ulaid rather than at Armagh, as it had by then come under Airgíallan control. It is likely that the Airgíalla were not settlers in Ulaid territory, but indigenous tribes; most of whom were vassals of the Ulaid before casting off Ulaid overlordship and becoming independent. It has been suggested that the Airthir—in whose lands lay Emain Macha—were originally an Ulaid tribe before becoming one of the Airgíalla.

Towards the end of the 5th century, the Ulaid sub-group Dál Riata, located in the Glens of Antrim, had started settling in modern-day Scotland, forming a cross-channel kingdom. Their first settlements were in the region of Argyll, which means &quot;eastern province of the Gael&quot;.

It is to these boundaries that Ulaid entered the historic period in Ireland in the 6th century, though the Dál nAraidi still held territory west of the Bann in County Londonderry. The emergence of the Dál nAraidi and Dál Fiatach dynasties may have concealed the dominance of earlier tribal groupings.

===6th to 7th centuries===
By the mid-6th century, the Dál Riata possessions in Scotland came under serious threat from Bridei I, king of the Picts, resulting in them seeking the Northern Uí Néill&#x27;s aid. The king of Dál Riata, Áedán mac Gabráin, had already granted the island of Iona off the coast of Scotland to the Cenél Conaill prince and saint, Columba, who in turn negotiated an alliance between the Northern Uí Néill and Dál Riata in 575 at Druim Ceit near Derry. The result of this pact was the removal of Dál Riata from Ulaid&#x27;s overlordship allowing it to concentrate on extending its Scottish domain. That same year either before or after the convention of Druim Ceit, the king of Dál Riata was killed in a bloody battle with the Dál nAraidi at Fid Euin.

In 563, according to the Annals of Ulster, an apparent internal struggle amongst the Cruthin resulted in Báetán mac Cinn making a deal with the Northern Uí Néill, promising them the territories of Ard Eólairgg (Magilligan peninsula) and the Lee, both west of the River Bann. As a result, the battle of Móin Dairi Lothair (modern-day Moneymore) took place between them and an alliance of Cruthin kings, in which the Cruthin suffered a devastating defeat. Afterwards the Northern Uí Néill settled their Airgíalla allies in the Cruthin territory of Eilne, which lay between the River Bann and the River Bush. The defeated Cruthin alliance meanwhile consolidated themselves on Dál nAraidi.

The Dál nAraidi king Congal Cáech took possession of the overlordship of Ulaid in 626, and in 628 killed the High King of Ireland, Suibne Menn of the Northern Uí Néill in battle. In 629, Congal led the Dál nAraidi to defeat against the same foes. In an attempt to have himself installed as High King of Ireland, Congal made alliances with Dál Riata and Strathclyde, which resulted in the disastrous Battle of Moira in 637, in modern-day County Down, which saw Congal slain by High King Domnall mac Áedo of the Northern Uí Néill and resulted in Dál Riata losing possession of its Scottish lands.

The Annals of Ulster record that in 668, the battle of &quot;Bellum Fertsi&quot; (modern-day Belfast) took place between the Ulaid and Cruithin, both terms which then referred to the Dál Fiatach and Dál nAraide respectively.

Meanwhile, the Dál nAraidi where still resisting the encroaching Northern Uí Néill and in 681, Dúngal Eilni, king of the Dál nAraidi, and his ally Cenn Fáelad of Ciannachta were killed at Dún Cethirinn.

===8th to 10th centuries===
By the 8th century the territory of the Ulaid shrunk to east of the Bann into what is now the modern-day counties Antrim, Down and Louth. In either 732 or 735, the Ulaid suffered a heavy defeat at the hands of the Cenél nEógain led by Áed Allán in the battle of Fochart in Magh Muirthemne, which saw the king of Ulaid, Áed Róin, decapitated. As a result, the Cenél nEógain brought Conaille Muirthemne under their suzerainty.

The taking over of the Ulaid&#x27;s ancestral lands by first the Northern Uí Néill and the end of their glory led to a constant antagonism between them. It was in the 8th century that the kingdom of Dál Riata was overrun by the Dál nAraidi.

The Dál Fiatach dynasty held sway over Ulaid until the battle of Leth Cam in 827, when they attempted to remove Airgíalla from Northern Uí Néill dominance. The Dál Fiatach may have been distracted by the presence of at least one Viking base along Strangford Lough, and by the end of the century, the Dál nAraidi had risen to dominance over them. However, this only lasted until 972, when Eochaid mac Ardgail restored Dál Fiatach&#x27;s fortunes.

During the 9th and 10th centuries, the Vikings had founded several bases in Ulaid, primarily at Annagassan, Carlingford Lough, Lough Neagh, and Strangford Lough. There was also a significant port at Ulfreksfjord, located at Latharna, present-day Larne, County Antrim. All but Ulfreksfjord were destroyed by the combined efforts of the Ulaid and the Northern Uí Néill, however as a result they deprived themselves of the economic advantages provided by prosperous Viking settlements.

===11th century===
In 1000 the Viking king of Dublin, Sigtrygg Silkbeard, was expelled by Brian Boru the High King of Ireland, and was refused sanctuary by the Ulaid. Eventually Sigtrygg was forced to return to Dublin and submitted to Brian. Sigtrygg didn&#x27;t forget the Ulaid&#x27;s refusal, and in 1001 his fleet plundered Inis Cumhscraigh and Cill Cleithe in Dál Fiatach, taking many prisoners. Sigtrygg&#x27;s forces also served in Brian&#x27;s campaigns against the Ulaid in 1002 and 1005.

At Craeb Telcha in 1003 the Northern Uí Néill and Ulaid fought a major battle, the Ulaid inauguration site. Here Eochaid mac Ardgail, and most of Ulaid&#x27;s nobility were slaughtered, along with the Northern Uí Néill king. The result was a bloody succession war amongst the princes of the Dál Fiatach, who also had to war with the Dál nAraidi who eyed the kingship.

In 1005, Brian Boru, marched north to accept submissions from the Ulaid, and set-up camp at Emain Macha possibly with the intention of exploiting the symbolism it held for the Ulaid. From here, Boru marched to the Dál nAraidi capital, Ráith Mór, where he received only the submissions of their king and that of the Dál Fiatach. This however appears to have been the catalyst for a series of attacks by Flaithbertach Ua Néill, king of the Cenél nEógain, to punish the Ulaid. In 1006, an army led by Flaithbertach marched into Leth Cathail and killed its king, followed by the slaying of the heir of Uí Echach Cobo at Loughbrickland.

The battle of Craeb Telcha resulted in the inability of the Ulaid to provide any useful aid to Boru, when in 1006 he led an army made up of men from all over Ireland in an attempt to force the submission of the Northern Uí Néill. Having marched through the lands of the Cenél Conaill and Cenél nEógain, Boru led his army across the River Bann at Fersat Camsa (Macosquin) and into Ulaid, where he accepted submissions from the Ulaid at Craeb Telcha, before marching south and through the traditional assembly place of the Conaille Muirtheimne at &quot;i n-oenach Conaille&quot;.

Flaithbertach Ua Néill continued his attacks on Ulaid in 1007, attacking the Conaille Muirtheimne. In 1011, the same year Boru finally achieved hegemony over the entire of Ireland, Flaithbertach launched an invasion of Ulaid, and after destroying Dún Echdach (Duneight, south of Lisburn) and the surrounding settlement, took the submission of the Dál Fiatach, who had the Ulaid kingship, thus removing them from Boru&#x27;s over-lordship. The next year, Flaithbertach raided the Ards peninsula and took an uncountable number of spoils.

At Ulfreksfjord in 1018, a combined force of native Irish, led by a king called Conchobar, and their Norse allies, led by Eyvind Urarhorn, defeated a major Viking expedition launched by the Earl of Orkney, Einar Sigurdsson, who was aiming to re-assert his father&#x27;s lordship over the seaways between Ireland and Scotland. In 1022, Niall mac Eochaid, the king of Ulaid, inflicted a major defeat on Sigtrygg&#x27;s Dublin fleet, decimating it and taking its crew captive. Niall followed up this victory in 1026 attacking Finn Gall, a Viking settlement just north of Dublin itself.

Sigtrygg&#x27;s nephew, Ivar Haraldsson, plundered Rathlin Island just off the north coast of Ulaid in 1038 and again in 1045. The latter attack saw Ímar kill Ragnall Ua Eochada, the heir-apparent of Ulaid and brother of Niall mac Eochaid, along with three hundred Ulaid nobles. In retribution Niall again attacked Finn Gall. In 1087, a son of the king of Ulaid, allied with two grandsons Ragnall, attacked the Isle of Man in a failed attempt to oust Godred Crovan, king of Dublin and the Isles.

At the end of the 11th century, the Ulaid had a final revival under Donn Sléibe mac Echdacha, from whom descended the Mac Dúinn Shléibe—anglicised MacDonlevy—kings that ruled Ulaid in the 12th century, with the Dál Fiatach kingship restricted to their dynasty after 1137. They developed close ties with the kingdom of the Isles. The Mac Dúinn Shléibe kings desperately maintained the independence of Ulaid from the Mac Lochlainn rulers of the Northern Uí Néill.

===12th century===
By the beginning of the 12th century the Dál nAraidi, ruled by the Ó Loingsigh (O&#x27;Lynch), had lost control of most of Antrim to the Ua Flainn (O&#x27;Lynn) and became restricted to a stretch of land in south Antrim with their base at Mag Line (Moylinny). The Ua Flainn were the ruling sept of the Airgíallan Uí Thuirtre as well as rulers of Fir Lí, both of which lay west of the River Bann. In a process of gradual infiltration by marital and military alliances as well as growing pressure from the encroaching Cenél nEógain, they moved their power east of the Bann. Once they had come to prominence in Antrim the Ua Flainn styled themselves as king of Dál nAraidi, Dál Riata, and Fir Lí, alongside their own Uí Thuirtre.

By 1130, the most southerly part of Ulaid, Conaille Muirtheimne, had been conquered by Donnchad Ua Cerbaill, king of Airgíalla. The part of Muirtheimne called Cualigne was subsequently settled by the Airgíallan Uí Méith (from which Omeath derives its name).

The earliest Irish land charter to survive is that of the grant in 1157 of land to the Cistercians in Newry, which lay in Uí Echach, by the High King Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn. This grant was made with the consent of the king of Ulaid, Cú Ulad Mac Dúinn Sléibe, and the king of Uí Echach, Domnall Ua hÁeda.

The Annals of Ulster record that in April 1165, the Ulaid, ruled by Eochaidh Mac Dúinn Sléibe, turned against Muirchertach Mac Lochlainn, and attacked the Uí Méith as well as the Uí Breasail in modern barony Oneilland East, County Armagh (which was also formerly part of Ulaid), and the Dál Riata. In retaliation Mac Lochlainn led a force consisting of the Northern Uí Néill and Airgíalla into Ulaid killing many and expelling Eochaid from the kingship. In September Eochaid tried to reclaim the kingship, however was expelled by his own people who feared reprisals from Mac Lochlainn, upon whose command had Eochaid confined by Ua Cerbaill. The next month Mac Lochlainn led another raid into Ulaid, receiving their hostages along with a large amount of their treasure. Later that same month Ua Cerbaill along with Eochaid held a meeting with Mac Lochlainn where Eochaid requested the kingship of Ulaid in return for the hostages of all Ulaid, which included the son of every chief along with his own daughter. Eochaid also gave Mac Lochlainn a considerable amount of treasure along with the territory of Bairrche, and the townland of Saul. In turn, Mac Lochlainn swore an oath to the Bishop of Armagh amongst other nobles for his good behaviour. Mac Lochlainn then give Bairrche to Ua Cerbaill for his part in mediating what turned out to be short-lived reconciliation. Over the following century, the Airgíallan Mughdorna would settle Bairrche, and from them derives its present-day name of Mourne. Despite his oath, Muirchertach had Eochaid seized and blinded, after which his allies abandoned him, and he was reduced to a handful of followers. With sixteen of these closest associates, he was killed in 1166.

In 1170 Eochaid&#x27;s brother Magnus who had become king of Ulaid expelled the Augustinian canons from Saul.

===Ulaid and the Normans===
Despite the turmoil amongst the Ulaid, they continued to survive but not for much longer. In 1177 Ulaid was invaded by the Normans led by John de Courcy, who in a surprise attack captured and held the Dál Fiatach capital, Dún De Lethglaise (Downpatrick), forcing the Ulaid over-king, Ruaidrí Mac Duinn Sléibe (Rory MacDonleavy), to flee. A week later, Mac Duinn Sléibe returned with a great host from across Ulaid, and despite heavily outnumbering de Courcy&#x27;s forces, were defeated. In another attempt to retake Dún De Lethglaise, Mac Duinn Sléibe followed up with an even greater force made up a coalition of Ulster&#x27;s powers that included the king of the Cenél nEógain, Máel Sechnaill Mac Lochlainn, and the chief prelates in the province such as the archbishop of Armagh and the bishop of Down. Once again however the Normans won, capturing the clergy and many of their relics.

In 1178, after John de Courcy had retired to Glenree in &quot;Machaire Conaille&quot; (another name for Conaille Muirtheimne), Mac Duinn Sléibe, along with the king of Airgíalla, Murchard Ua Cerbaill (Murrough O&#x27;Carroll), attacked the Normans, killing around 450, and suffering 100 fatalities themselves.

Despite forming alliances, constant inter-warring amongst the Ulaid and against their Irish neighbours continued oblivious to the threat of the Normans. De Courcy would take advantage of this instability and over the following years, despite some setbacks, set about conquering the neighbouring districts in Ulaid shifting the focus of power.

By 1181, Mac Duinn Sléibe and Cú Mide Ua Flainn, the king of Uí Thuirtre and Fir Lí in County Antrim, had come around and served loyally as sub-kings of de Courcy. Mac Duinn Sléibe, possibly inspired by the chance to restore Ulaid to its ancient extent, may have encouraged de Courcy to campaign westwards, which saw attacks on Armagh in 1189 and then Derry and the Inishowen peninsula in 1197.

De Courcy would style himself as &quot;princeps Ultoniae&quot;, &quot;master of Ulster&quot;, and ruled his conquests like an independent king. The Uí Echach Coba in central and western Down however escaped conquest.

In 1199 King John I of England sent Hugh de Lacy to arrest de Courcy and take his possessions. In 1205, de Lacy was made the first Earl of Ulster, founding the Earldom of Ulster, with which he continued the conquest of the Ulaid. The earldom would expand along the northern coast of Ulster all the way to the Cenél nEógain&#x27;s old power-base of Inishowen.

Until the end of the 13th century, the Dál Fiatach, still led by the Mac Dúinnshléibe, retained a fraction of their power being given the title of &quot;rex Hibernicorum Ulidiae&quot;, meaning &quot;king of the Irish of Ulaid&quot;. The Gaelic title of &quot;rí Ulad&quot;, meaning &quot;king of Ulster&quot;, upon the extinction of Dál Fiatach was usurped by the encroaching Ó Néills of the Cenél nEógain.

==Religion==
Ulaid was the location where the future patron saint of Ireland, Saint Patrick, was held during his early captivity. It is here that he made the first Irish converts to Christianity, with the Dál Fiatach the first ruling dynasty to do so. Patrick died at Saul, and buried at &quot;Dún De Lethglaise&quot;, which in the 13th century was renamed &quot;Dún Phádraig&quot;, which became Anglicised as Downpatrick.

When Ireland was being organised into a diocesan system in the 12th century, the following dioceses where created based on the territory of the main dynasties of the Ulaid: the diocese of Down, based on the territory of the Dál Fiatach, with its cathedral at Bangor, however later moved to Downpatrick by John de Courcy; and the diocese of Connor, based on the territory of the Dál nAraidi. Around 1197 the diocese of Down was split in two with the creation of the diocese of Dromore, based on the territory of the Uí Echach Cobo, with its cathedral at Dromore.

===Principal churches/monasteries===
The chief churches, or more accurately monasteries, of the main sub-kingdoms of Ulaid were:
*Mag Bile (modern Irish: &quot;Maigh Bhile&quot;, meaning &quot;plain of [the] sacred trees&quot;), now known as Movilla in County Down. It was the chief church of the Dál Fiatach, and linked with their ecclesiastical origins, having been founded circa 540 by St. Finnian of Movilla, who was of the Dál Fiatach. The name Mag Bile suggests that this monastery was purposely built on the site of an ancient sacred tree.
*Bennchair (modern Irish: &quot;Beannchar&quot;, possibly meaning &quot;place of points&quot;), now known as Bangor in County Down. Built circa 555 or 559 by St. Comgall of the Dál nAraidi in what was Dál Fiatach territory, it was one of the main monastic foundations in Ireland.
*Condaire (modern Irish: &quot;Coinnire&quot;, meaning &quot;[wild-]dog oak-wood&quot;), now known as Connor in County Antrim. It was the chief church of the Dál nAraidi located in the minor-kingdom of Dál Sailni, and was founded by St. Mac Nisse. It would become the cathedral for the diocese of Connor.
*Airther Maigi (modern Irish: &quot;Oirthear Maí&quot;, meaning &quot;the east of the plain&quot;), now known as Armoy in County Antrim. It was the chief church of the Dál Riata founded by St. Olcan; however, after Dál nAraidi expansion in the 7th century it lost its episcopal status and was superseded by the church of Connor.
*Droma Móir (modern Irish: &quot;Droim Mór&quot;, meaning &quot;big ridge&quot;), now known as Dromore in County Down. It became the chief church of the Uí Echach Cobo, and was founded circa 510 by St. Colmán. It would become the cathedral for the diocese of Dromore.

==Artefacts==
Although Francis John Byrne describes the few La Tène artefacts discovered in Ireland as &#x27;rather scanty&#x27;, most of the artefacts (mostly weapons and harness pieces) have been found in the north of Ireland, suggesting &#x27;small bands of settlers (warriors and metalworkers) arrived&#x27; from Britain in the 3rd century BC, and may have been absorbed into the Ulaid population.

==Kingdoms, dynasties, and septs==

By the 12th century Ulaid was divided into four main dynastic sub-kingdoms, each consisting of smaller petty-kingdoms:
* Dál Fiatach, an Ulaid people based at Dún De Lethglaise (present-day Downpatrick, County Down), who dominated the over-kingship of Ulaid and had interests in the Isle of Man. Their principal sept were the Mac Duinnshléibhe.
* Dál nAraidi a Cruithin people, dominated by the Dál nAraidi of Magh Line based at Ráith Mór (near present-day Antrim town, County Antrim). They were the Dál Fiatach&#x27;s main challengers for the over-kingship. Their principal sept were the Uí Choelbad.
* Uí Echach Cobo, a Cruithin sept, kin with the Dál nAraidi, who also challenged for the over-kingship of Ulaid. They were based in modern-day County Down, possibly at &quot;Cnoc Uí Echach&quot; (Knock Iveagh). Their principal sept were the Mag Aonghusa;
* Uí Tuirtri, originating from Airgíalla they took control of most of Dál nAraidi&#x27;s territory. Its principal sept was the Uí Fhloinn.

In the 10th-century revision of the Lebor na Cert, the following twelve Ulaid petty-kingdoms are given as paying stipends to the king of Ulaid:
* Dál nAraidi of Magh Line
* Cobha, ruled by the Uí Echach Cobo
* Dál Riata, based in the Glens of Antrim
* Airrther, a district located in eastern County Armagh
* Uí Erca Céin, a branch of the Dál nAraidi
* Leth Cathail, a branch of the Dál Fiatach, located in and around the modern barony of Lecale, County Down 
* Conaille Muirtheimne, close kin of the Uí Echach Cobo, located in and around the modern barony of Dundalk, County Louth 
* Dál mBuinne, also known as the Muintir Branáin, a branch of the Dál nAraidi located along the border area between County Antrim and Down 
* Uí Blathmaic, a branch of the Dál Fiatach whose territory was located in the north-western part of the barony of Ards and part of Castlereagh; 
*Na hArda, ruled by the Uí Echach Arda, a branch of the Dál Fiatach whose territory was located in the northern part of the Ards peninsula 
*Boirche, alias Bairrche, a branch of the Dál Fiatach located in what is now the barony of Mourne in southern County Down
*Duibhthrian, west of Strangford Lough, County Down.

Other territories and dynasties within Ulaid included:
* Cuailgne, located in the area of Carlingford Lough and Dundalk, County Louth. Their name is preserved in the name of the parish of Cooley, as well as the Cooley Peninsula. Cooley is the location of the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; or Cattle Raid of Cooley.
* Dál Sailni, a client-kingdom of the Dál nAraidi of Magh Line. Whilst the Uí Choelbad dynasty of Dál nAraidi supplied the principal kings, the Dál Sailni held the principal church of Connor. After the Viking period, the church of Connor and the territory of the Dál Sailni were taken over by the Uí Tuirtri.
* Cineál Fhaghartaigh, an offshoot of the Uí Echach Cobo, who at one time held the modern baronies of Kinelarty, Dufferin, and part of Castlereagh.
* Monaig, a people whose locale is disputed. The annals and historians make mention of several different Monaigs: the Monaigh Uladh, in the area of Downpatrick; Monaich Ulad of Rusat; Monaigh at Lough Erne, County Fermanagh; Monaigh Aird, in County Down; the Cenél Maelche/Mailche in Antrim, County Antrim, &quot;alias Monach&quot;; Magh Monaigh; Monach-an-Dúin in Cath Monaigh, possibly in Iveagh, County Down. The ancient Manaigh/Monaigh who settled near Lough Erne, are associated with the Menapii, a Belgae tribe from northern Gaul.

===Descended houses===
The first king of Scotland, Kenneth MacAlpin, founder of the House of Alpin, is said to descend from the mid-6th-century king of Dál Riata, Gabrán mac Domangairt. Along with this, the following Scottish Highland houses are reputed to be of Ulaid descent: McEwen, MacLachlan, McNeills, and the MacSweens. The royal House of Stuart is also claimed as being descended from the Ulaid.

==In medieval literature==
According to medieval pseudo-historians a group of brothers known as the Three Collas in the 4th century founded the over-kingdom of Airgíalla after a decisive defeat of the Ulaid, and afterwards destroyed their ancient capital Emain Macha. This however is a fabrication.

The Ulaid feature in Irish legends and historical traditions of prehistoric times, most notably in the group of sagas known as the Ulster Cycle. These stories are set during the reign of the Ulaid king Conchobar mac Nessa at Emain Macha (Navan Fort, near Armagh) and tell of his conflicts with the Connachta, led by queen Medb and her husband Ailill mac Máta. The chief hero is Conchobar&#x27;s nephew Cú Chulainn, and the central story is the proto-epic &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot;, &quot;The Cattle Raid of Cooley&quot;.

In this period Ireland is said to have been divided into five independent over-kingdoms—or &quot;cuigeadh&quot;, literally meaning &quot;a fifth&quot;—of which Ulaid was one, with its capital at &quot;Emain Macha&quot;. Medieval pseudo-historians called this era &quot;Aimser na Coicedach&quot;, which has been translated as: &quot;Time of the Pentarchs&quot;; &quot;Time of the Five Fifths&quot;; and &quot;Time of the provincial kings&quot;. It was also described as &quot;the Pentarchy&quot;.

In some stories Conchobar&#x27;s birth and death are synchronised with those of Christ, which creates an apparent anachronism in the presence of the Connachta. The historical Connachta were a group of dynasties who traced their descent to the legendary king Conn Cétchathach, whose reign is traditionally dated to the 2nd century. However, the chronology of early Irish historical tradition is inconsistent and highly artificial. One early saga makes Fergus mac Léti, one of Conchobar&#x27;s predecessors as king of the Ulaid, a contemporary of Conn, and Tírechán&#x27;s 7th century memoir of Saint Patrick says that Cairbre Nia Fer, Conchobar&#x27;s son-in-law in the sagas, lived only 100 years before the saint, i.e. in the 4th century.

Kenneth Jackson, based on his estimates on the survival of oral tradition, also suggested that the Ulster Cycle originated in the 4th century. Other scholars, following T. F. O&#x27;Rahilly, propose that the sagas of the Ulster Cycle derive from the wars between the Ulaid and the midland dynasties of the Connachta and the nascent Uí Néill in the 4th and 5th centuries, at the end of which the Ulaid lost much of their territory, and their capital, to the new kingdoms of the Airgíalla. Traditional history credits this to the Three Collas, three great-great-great-grandsons of Conn, who defeated the Ulaid king Fergus Foga at Achad Lethderg in County Monaghan, seized all Ulaid territory west of the Newry River and Lough Neagh, and burned Emain Macha. Fergus Foga is said to have been the last king of the Ulaid to reign there. The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; dates this to AD 331. O&#x27;Rahilly and his followers believe the Collas are literary doublets of the sons of Niall Noígiallach, eponymous founder of the Uí Néill, who they propose were the true conquerors of Emain in the 5th century.

The Kings of Tara in the Ulster Cycle are the kindred of the Ulaid, the Érainn, and are generally portrayed sympathetically, especially Conaire Mór. It was remembered that the Connachta and Uí Néill had not yet taken the kingship. Tara was later occupied by the Laigin, who are to some extent strangely integrated with the Connachta in the Ulster Cycle. The latter later took the midlands from the Laigin and their historical antagonism is legendary. The Érainn, led by Cú Roí, also rule in distant Munster and, while presented as deadly rivals of the Ulaid, are again portrayed with unusual interest and sympathy.

==Cultural impact==
There two known communities in North Carolina, the United States, that are likely to have been named after Ulaid – Mount Ulla and Ulah.

The Ulaid have inspired the name of traditional Irish group Ulaid featuring Dónal O&#x27;Connor, John McSherry &amp; Seán Óg Graham who have released two critically acclaimed albums.

<text>Lullacry was a Finnish melodic band with gothic metal influences that hailed from Helsinki.

==History==
The band recorded their first demo (named &quot;Weeper&#x27;s Aeon&quot;) in 1998 and in a short time they had enough of a following to safely attempt a full-length album – &quot;Sweet Desire&quot; – recorded in 1999. This got the attention of Spinefarm Records and led to a professional contract. Their career truly began progressing after the release of the album &quot;Be My God&quot; – from 2001 – which was issued as they went on a joint tour with the power metal band Edguy.

However, vocalist Tanya Kemppainen quit the band in 2002, leaving Lullacry without its main element. Many female singers applied for the post, but the then unknown contralto vocalist Tanja Lainio was ultimately chosen as the replacement vocalist. Their following release was entitled &quot;Crucify My Heart&quot;. The single &quot;Don&#x27;t Touch the Flame&quot; taken from this album included a cover of the Nine Inch Nails track, &quot;Head Like a Hole&quot;.

Prior to the recording of their fourth album, the EP &quot;Fire Within&quot; was released including alternative versions of two of the band&#x27;s classic tracks, a W.A.S.P. cover &quot;L.O.V.E. Machine&quot;, and two new tracks.

In June 2005, the band announced the completion of their fourth album entitled &quot;Vol. 4&quot;, which was released in September the same year. The single &quot;Stranger in You&quot;, was released in July.

After a long hiatus, Lullacry released their fifth studio album &quot;Where Angels Fear&quot; in 2012. It was released through band&#x27;s own label, OUTO recordings, distributed by Playground Scandinavia, and was licensed to Europe, Japan, North America, Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.

In February 2013, Lullacry released a new video and digi-single for the song &quot;To Every Heartache&quot;. They undertook some shows during 2013, basically in Finland, to celebrate their 15-year career, but officially disbanded in 2014 following three farewell shows.

In August 2009, Devgn changed the spelling of his surname Devgan to &quot;Devgn&quot;, at the request of his family. 

=== Private jet ===

== Career ==
=== Rise to stardom (1991–99) ===
As Devgn entered the film industry in 1991, he changed his stage name from his birth name, Vishal, to &quot;Ajay&quot; due to several other actors named Vishal being launched at the same time, including Manoj Kumar&#x27;s son. He began his professional career alongside Madhoo in the action romance &quot;Phool Aur Kaante&quot;, which earned him the Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut. In his opening scene, Devgn performed a split while balancing between two motorcycles. His next film was &quot;Jigar&quot; (1992), a Bollywood martial arts film co-starring Karisma Kapoor. It was released on Diwali weekend and became the seventh-highest-grossing film of that year, taking at the box office.

In 1993, Devgn starred in &quot;Dil Hai Betaab&quot;, a film about a revengeful love triangle. He next featured in &quot;Divya Shakti&quot; and then &quot;Sangram&quot;, a story of enmity between two fathers. Devgn then worked with Deepak Bahry, who directed the action film &quot;Ek Hi Raasta&quot;, and with Deepak Pawar, who directed &quot;Platform&quot;. Other releases that year were &quot;Shaktiman&quot;, &quot;Dhanwan&quot; and &quot;Bedardi&quot;.

In 1994, Devgn starred in Harry Baweja&#x27;s romantic action film &quot;Dilwale&quot;. He played the part of Arun Saxena, a man with intellectual impairment. The movie was the tenth-highest-grossing movie of the year. His next release was &quot;Kanoon&quot; and then Kuku Kohli&#x27;s &quot;Suhaag&quot; with Akshay Kumar. The film was about two friends. Devgn played Ajay Sharma/Malhotra. &quot;Suhaag&quot; was the seventh-highest-grossing movie of the year. His next film was &quot;Vijaypath&quot;. Shooting dates for &quot;Vijaypath&quot; clashed with those of &quot;Karan Arjun&quot; which Devgn declined. &quot;Vijaypath&quot; was the eighth-highest-grossing film of the year.

In 1995, Devgn appeared alongside Juhi Chawla in Mahesh Bhatt&#x27;s &quot;Naajayaz&quot;, which earned him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor, followed by &quot;Hulchul&quot; directed by Milan Luthria, alongside Kajol. Devgn and Kajol then appeared in &quot;Gundaraj&quot; which did not perform well at the box office. His next release was &quot;Haqeeqat&quot; co-starring with Tabu. This film was the eleventh-highest-grossing film of the year.

In 1996, Devgn starred in the action movie &quot;Jung&quot; with Mithun Chakraborty, Rambha and Aditya Pancholi. His next release was an action movie called &quot;Jaan&quot;, with Twinkle Khanna. He then starred in Harry Baweja&#x27;s film &quot;Diljale&quot;, where he played a terrorist character called Shaka.

In 1997, Devgn starred in a poorly -eceived movie, &quot;Itihaas&quot;, with Twinkle Khanna. His next release was Indra Kumar&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;Ishq&quot; with Aamir Khan, Juhi Chawla and Kajol. In this successful film, Devgn played Ajay, a rich boy in love with a poor girl, played by Kajol. The film grossed and emerged as the fourth-highest-grossing film of the year.

In 1998, Devgn starred in &quot;Major Saab&quot; with Amitabh Bachchan and Sonali Bendre where he played the character of an army officer. The movie was successful and was the tenth-highest-grossing film of the year. He next starred with Kajol in Anees Bazmee&#x27;s second film, the romantic comedy &quot;Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha&quot;, a remake of the 1995 American film &quot;French Kiss&quot;. It grossed . Devgn&#x27;s next release was Mahesh Bhatt&#x27;s drama &quot;Zakhm&quot;, which examines communal tension in Mumbai during riots. Devgn played a man who is fed up with religious conflict. Devgn won several awards for his critically acclaimed performance, including the National Film Award for Best Actor and the Screen Award for Best Actor, in addition to his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.

In 1999, Devgn starred in the musical romance &quot;Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam&quot;, in which he played Vanraj, a man who tries to help his wife (Aishwarya Rai) reunite with her lover (Salman Khan). &quot;Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam&quot; marked a significant turning point in Devgn&#x27;s career. The film, an adaptation of Maitreyi Devi&#x27;s Bengali novel &quot;Na Hanyate&quot;, was directed by Sanjay Leela Bhansali and co-starred Salman Khan and Aishwarya Rai. Devgn&#x27;s performance received positive reviews from critics. &quot;Rediff&quot; said: &quot;Ajay&#x27;s role reminds you of one he did in another film, &quot;Pyaar Toh Hona Hi Tha&quot;. There he is searching for the boyfriend of the girl he secretly loves. But intense scenes are his forte and he does well here. He&#x27;s particularly good in the scene where he gets exasperated with his wife&#x27;s stubbornness and strives to keep his cool.&quot; The film proved to be a commercial success and earned Devgn his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. After that, he appeared in &quot;Hindustan Ki Kasam&quot; with Amitabh Bachchan and Sonali Bendre. He then worked with the director Milan Luthria in &quot;Kachche Dhaage&quot;, with Saif Ali Khan and Manisha Koirala. The movie was a box-office hit. He then performed in the successful movie &quot;Hogi Pyaar Ki Jeet&quot;, a romantic comedy, and then in his home production movie with Kajol, and director, Prakash Jha. The film was titled &quot;Dil Kya Kare&quot;. His other movies in 1999 were &quot;Gair&quot; and &quot;Thakshak&quot; in which he played a strong, silent man.

=== Career fluctuations and critical acclaim (2000–09) ===
In 2000, Devgn performed in Harry Baweja&#x27;s &quot;Deewane&quot;. The film did not do well at the box office. In the same year, Devgn starred in his first home production; &quot;Raju Chacha&quot;, with Kajol. The film was moderately successful.

In 2001, Devgn starred in another moderately successful film; &quot;Yeh Raaste Hain Pyaar Ke&quot; with Madhuri Dixit and Preity Zinta. His next release was &quot;Lajja&quot;, with Manisha Koirala, Madhuri Dixit, Jackie Shroff and Anil Kapoor. His performance was positively received and earned him his first nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor. However, the film was commercially unsuccessful. Mahesh Manjrekar&#x27;s &quot;Tera Mera Saath Rahen&quot; followed.

2002 proved to be a key year for Devgn as he starred in three films of contrasting genres. He first starred in Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s &quot;Company&quot; which was a fictional examination of the Mumbai underworld. Devgn played a gangster named Malik. Both the film and Devgn&#x27;s performance received critical acclaim. As Taran Adarsh reviewed: &quot;Devgn enacts his role to perfection. A controlled performance, the actor takes to this complex character like a fish takes to water. He underplays his part with admirable ease.&quot; Devgn&#x27;s next release was David Dhawan&#x27;s comedy &quot;Hum Kisise Kum Nahin&quot;, with Amitabh Bachchan, Sanjay Dutt and Aishwarya Rai. The same year, he played the role of Bhagat Singh, in Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s biopic &quot;The Legend of Bhagat Singh&quot;. His performance was well received by critics. Taran Adarsh said, &quot;Devgn has lived the role. To state that he is excellent would be an understatement. His performance is bound to win admiration from cinegoers, besides fetching awards.&quot; The film was released on 7 June 2002 and went on to win two National Film Awards, including the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi, and three Filmfare Awards, including the Filmfare Award for Best Film (Critics). Despite these awards, and Devgn winning his second National Film Award for Best Actor for his performance, the film was not popular with the public. Devgn went on to perform in Anees Bazmee&#x27;s &quot;Deewangee&quot;. The film was partially inspired by William Diehl&#x27;s novel, &quot;Primal Fear&quot;. The film was a success at the box office. He jointly won the Filmfare Award for Best Actor (Critics) for his performance in &quot;Company&quot; and &quot;The Legend of Bhagat Singh&quot;, in addition to receiving his fourth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for the former. For his performance in &quot;Deewangee&quot;, he received several awards including the Filmfare Award for Best Villain, the Screen Award for Best Villain and the Zee Cine Award for Best Villain.

In 2003, Devgn starred in Ram Gopal Verma&#x27;s horror film &quot;Bhoot&quot;, opposite Urmila Matondkar. The film was appreciated critically and performed well at the box office. He then starred in the action thriller &quot;&quot; with the actress debutante, Neha Dhupia. The film was a commercial success. Devgn next performed in Milan Luthria&#x27;s romantic film &quot;Chori Chori&quot;, opposite Rani Mukherji and Sonali Bendre. This film did not succeed at the box office. Devgn&#x27;s next release of the year was Prakash Jha&#x27;s &quot;Gangaajal&quot;. The film was set in the time of the blinding incident in Bhagalpur, Bihar. Rediff.com said, &quot;Ajay Devgan pulls up an ace with a part tailormade to reinforce his seething-under-the-surface angry hero image. To his credit (and the director&#x27;s), he brings style and grace to a largely stereotypical, righteous protagonist. To a great extent, his presence covers up the film&#x27;s patchiness in the second half.&quot; Devgn received his fifth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor for his performance in the film. He then worked in Rohit Shetty&#x27;s directional debut &quot;Zameen&quot; and J. P. Dutta&#x27;s war film &quot;LOC Kargil&quot;.

In 2004, Devgn was cast with Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai and Akshay Kumar in Rajkumar Santoshi&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Khakee&quot;. The film was released on 23 January 2004. It received positive reviews and became one of the highest-grossing films of 2004. In &quot;Khakee&quot;, Devgn once again played a villain. His performance as a police officer turned murderer was well received by critics. Taran Adarsh said: &quot;Ajay Devgan adds yet another feather in his cap with a performance that could&#x27;ve been played only by a master performer. His confrontations with Amitabh Bachchan are exemplary.&quot; He received his second nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Villain for his performance in the film. Later in 2004, Devgn appeared in Indra Kumar&#x27;s &quot;Masti&quot; and Mani Ratnam&#x27;s &quot;Yuva&quot;.

Devgn next collaborated with Rituparno Ghosh in the relationship drama &quot;Raincoat&quot;, with Aishwaraya Rai. The film is an adaptation of O. Henry&#x27;s &quot;The Gift of the Magi&quot;. &quot;Raincoat&quot; met with wide critical acclaim and won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi. Devgn was praised for his performance. Rediff said: &quot;Hesitation, desperation, humiliation – Ajay Devgn conveys them eloquently. His Manoj is no cool dude, but just another lower middle-class guy in misery, with whom none would like to switch place. He particularly stands out in the scenes where he cries in the bathroom, or begs Neeru not to marry someone else.&quot; In 2004, Devgn was also seen in a cameo appearance in &quot;&quot;.

2005 was a less successful year for Devgn, with all of his films not proving to be successful at the box office. His movies were not financially successful. They included &quot;Insan&quot;, &quot;Blackmail&quot;, &quot;Main Aisa Hi Hoon&quot;, &quot;Tango Charlie&quot; and &quot;Shikhar&quot;. However, the films &quot;Kaal&quot; and &quot;Apaharan&quot; did well. His performance as a villain in &quot;Kaal&quot; also earned him his third nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Villain.

In 2006, Devgn played Othello in &quot;Omkara&quot;, a Hindi adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot;. It was directed by Vishal Bhardwaj. The film is a tragedy of sexual jealousy set against the backdrop of the political system in Uttar Pradesh. It premiered at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was screened at the Cairo International Film Festival. &quot;Omkara&quot; was well received by critics. &quot;Rediff&quot; said: &quot;Othello is a tricky role, a leading man eclipsed by the villain. Yet the Moor is a brooding and compelling character, and Ajay Devgn does valiantly with his material. Omkara strips Othello of the racism, exchanging his black skin for surprisingly inconsequential half-Brahminism. Ajay&#x27;s best bits are when restrained, and while there is a bit of a seen-that feel to his character, by the time the film is over, you realise just how unflinchingly solid he&#x27;s been.&quot; Taran Adarsh said: &quot;Ajay makes a stirring and powerful interpretation of a man haunted by uncertainty about his lover&#x27;s faithfulness. The serious look that Ajay carries suits him to the T. Of course, Ajay is exceptional in the film and looks every inch the character he portrays.&quot;

In 2006, Devgn also starred in Rohit Shetty&#x27;s &quot;Golmaal&quot;. It had two sequels &quot;Golmaal Returns&quot; and &quot;Golmaal 3&quot;. In the same year, Devgn was featured in a short documentary about the Mumbai floods of 2005 titled &quot;The Awakening&quot;.

In 2007, Devgn starred in two films, director Anubhav Sinha&#x27;s action thriller &quot;Cash&quot; and &quot;Aag&quot;. Both films proved to be critically and commercially unsuccessful.

In 2008, Devgn starred in the social film &quot;Halla Bol&quot;, directed by Rajkumar Santoshi, alongside Pankaj Kapoor and Vidya Balan. The film is based on the life of activist Safdar Hashmi, who was killed in 1989 by political rivals while performing in the street play &quot;Halla Bol&quot;. The film received negative reviews and was a flop at the box office. The same year, Devgn also starred in Rohit Shetty&#x27;s third film &quot;Sunday&quot;. He then took the lead role with Kajol in his own directorial debut film &quot;U Me Aur Hum&quot;. The film performed moderately well at the box office and earned positive critical reviews for his performance as well as for his direction. &quot;Rediff&quot; said: &quot;His character grows, discovers both shirt-buttons and subtlety, delivering an intense acting job. Speaking almost entirely in platitudes – pithy at first, profound as he goes on – this grows into an extraordinarily well-written character, replete with flaws and relatability. The way he treats his remorse, drunkenly pointing every finger at himself around a dinner table, is superbly handled, as is his guilty struggle to delineate his life experience from his professional opinion.&quot; Devgn also made a cameo appearance in his brother Anil Devgan&#x27;s film &quot;Haal-e-Dil&quot;. He then starred in Afzal Khan&#x27;s &quot;Mehbooba&quot;. Again in 2008, Devgn starred in Rohit Shetty&#x27;s comedy &quot;Golmaal Returns&quot;, a sequel to the 2006 film &quot;&quot; about a mistrustful wife who believed her husband was unfaithful. &quot;The Indian Express&quot; said the screenplay was derivative, concluding: &quot;There is nothing particularly new about a suspicious wife keeping tabs on her husband, and there is nothing particularly new in the way Ajay-Kareena play it.&quot; &quot;Golmaal Returns&quot; was a financial hit with global revenues of .

In 2009, Devgn produced his third film, &quot;All the Best&quot;, directed by Rohit Shetty. It was a moderate commercial success. Next, Devgn starred in Vipul Shah&#x27;s &quot;London Dreams&quot;, with Salman Khan and the Tamil film star Asin. The film was not popular with the public.

Both the film and Devgn&#x27;s performance were well received by the critics. Taran Adarsh said: &quot;Ajay Devgn is splendid as Sultan. The actor had enacted a similar role in &quot;Company&quot;, but it must be said that his interpretation is so different in &quot;Once Upon A Time in Mumbaai&quot;. He adds so much depth to the character, which only goes to prove his range and versatility. This is, without a trace of doubt, Ajay&#x27;s finest work so far.&quot; Komal Nahta said: &quot;Ajay Devgn is simply fantastic in the role of Sultan Mirza. So real is his performance that it looks like he was born to play this role. Right from his look to his acting including dialogue-delivery, everything is fabulous. Indeed, an award-winning performance!&quot; The film earned him his sixth nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor.

Devgn then starred in Priyadarshan&#x27;s action-thriller film &quot;Aakrosh&quot;.

He was a narrator in &quot;Yamla Pagla Deewana&quot; and also made a cameo appearance in &quot;Ready&quot;. Devgn starred in Rohit Shetty&#x27;s &quot;Singham&quot;. Taran Adarsh said: &quot;The title means &#x27;Lion&#x27; and Ajay is in the centre of the battle between good and evil. Ajay is well known for the lines, &quot;aataa maajhi satakli&quot;. The embodiment of screen masculinity, Ajay enacts the central character of a righteous, hardhearted cop with flourish. He brings alive on screen a larger-than-life hero character with determined conviction, which renders you thunderstruck. One of the few actors who underplays his part admirably, he returns to the over-the-top-action genre of films with this one. In a nutshell, his performance plays a pivotal role in carrying the film to the winning post.&quot; &quot;Singham&quot; earned him his seventh nomination for the Filmfare Award for Best Actor. He then starred David Dhawan&#x27;s action comedy film &quot;Rascals&quot;.

Taran Adarsh of &quot;Bollywood Hungama&quot; gave it 4 stars and said: &quot;The film is a complete mass entertainer with power-packed drama, hi-intensity dialogue and towering performances as its aces. The brand value attached to it coupled with a long weekend will help the film reap a harvest and rule the box office in days to come.&quot;.

<doc id="1085285" wikidata="Q1274963" url="?curid=1085285" title="Navan Fort">
<text>Navan Fort ( ; ) is an ancient ceremonial monument near Armagh, Northern Ireland. According to tradition it was one of the great royal sites of pre-Christian Gaelic Ireland and the capital of the Ulaidh. It is a large circular hilltop enclosure—marked by a bank and ditch—inside which is a circular mound and the remains of a ring barrow. Archeological investigations show that there were once buildings on the site, including a huge roundhouse-like structure that has been likened to a temple. In a ritual act, this timber structure was filled with stones, deliberately burnt down and then covered with earth to create the mound which stands today. It is believed that Navan was a pagan ceremonial site and was regarded as a sacred space. It features prominently in Irish mythology, especially in the tales of the Ulster Cycle. According to the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of Celtic Mythology&quot;, &quot;the [Eamhain Mhacha] of myth and legend is a far grander and mysterious place than archeological excavation supports&quot;.

Navan Fort is the heart of the larger &#x27;Navan complex&#x27;, which also includes the ancient sites of Haughey&#x27;s Fort (an earlier hilltop enclosure), the King&#x27;s Stables (a manmade ritual pool) and Loughnashade (a natural lake that has yielded votive offerings).

The name &quot;Eamhain Mhacha&quot; has been interpreted as &quot;Macha&#x27;s twins&quot; or &quot;Macha&#x27;s brooch&quot;, referring to a local goddess. &#x27;Navan&#x27; is an anglicisation of the Irish &quot;An Eamhain&quot;.

==Name==
The Irish name of Navan Fort is &quot;Eamhain Mhacha&quot;, from Old Irish: &quot;Emain Macha&quot;. The second element refers to the goddess Macha, for whom nearby Armagh (&quot;Ard Mhacha&quot;) is also named. However, the overall meaning of the name is unclear. It has been interpreted as &quot;Macha&#x27;s twins&quot; or &quot;Macha&#x27;s pair&quot; (possibly referring to the two features on the hilltop, or to Navan Fort and another nearby monument), or as &quot;Macha&#x27;s brooch&quot; (possibly referring to the shape of the monument). There are tales that try to explain how the name came about. In the second century AD, Greek geographer Ptolemy noted a place called &quot;Isamnion&quot; somewhere in southeastern Ulster. Some scholars believe this refers to &quot;Emain&quot;, and Gregory Toner has derived it from Proto-Celtic &quot;*isa-mon&quot; (&quot;holy mound&quot;). Others believe it refers to a place on the coast.

&quot;Eamhain Mhacha&quot;, and its short form &quot;An Eamhain&quot;, was anglicised as &#x27;Owenmagh&#x27;, &#x27;Nawan&#x27; and eventually &#x27;Navan&#x27;.

Navan Fort, sometimes called Navan Rath, is a State Care Historic Monument in the townland of Navan. It is on a low hill about west of Armagh (at grid ref. area H847 452). The site consists of a circular enclosure in diameter, marked by a large bank and ditch encircling the hill. The ditch is on the inside, suggesting the earthwork was symbolic rather than defensive. Inside the enclosure two monuments are visible. North-west of centre is an earthen mound in diameter and high. South-east of centre is the circular impression of a ring-barrow, about in diameter.

==Construction and early history==

Flint tools and shards of pottery show activity at the site in the Neolithic (c. 4000 to 2500 BC).

In the eighth century BC (Bronze Age), a ring of timber poles was raised at the western site, where the high mound now stands. It was 35m in diameter and surrounded by a ring ditch with an eastern entrance. This ditch was in diameter, wide and deep. In the fourth century BC (Iron Age) a new wooden structure was built on the same spot. It was a round building attached to a bigger round enclosure, making a figure-of-eight shape, both with eastern entrances. The larger ring of the figure-of-eight was in diameter, the smaller about . The smaller building had a hearth. The structure has been interpreted as a roundhouse with an attached yard or pen, or a building with an attached enclosure for rituals. Finds suggest that at this time the site was occupied by someone of high standing such as a king, chieftain or druid. They include a chape, a finely-decorated pin and the skull of a Barbary monkey, which was likely a pet that was either imported or given as a gift. The structure was rebuilt several times over the following centuries.

In the first century BC, a huge timber roundhouse-like structure was built on the same spot. It was 40 metres in diameter and consisted of an outer wall and four inner rings of posts (probably holding up a roof), which circled a huge central pillar. This oak pillar has been dated by dendrochronology to the year 95 BC and could have stood about 13 metres tall. The building had a western entrance, toward the setting sun, which suggests it was not a dwelling. A ditch and bank were dug around it. There is evidence that the huge ditch and bank that encircles the hill was dug at about the same time.

Not long after it was built, the building was filled with thousands of stones, to a height of nearly 3 metres. This stone cairn was flat-topped and split into wedges, resembling a spoked wheel when seen from above. There is some evidence that the stones came from an older monument in the area, perhaps a passage tomb. The building was then deliberately burnt down before being covered in a mound of earth. It was made up of many soil types, suggesting that soil was brought from surrounding areas. There is archaeological evidence for similar repeated building and burning at Tara and Dún Ailinne.

In the first or second century BC, a figure-of-eight structure was also built at the eastern site. It was similar to those at the western site and may have been built around the same time as the mound. The larger ring was in diameter, the smaller about . This figure-of-eight structure was then cleared away and replaced by another round wooden structure. It was double-walled, had a central hearth and an eastern entrance. Two graves were found just outside the entrance. This structure was in turn replaced by a ring-barrow: a round mound, usually raised over a burial, surrounded by a ditch and bank.

===Purpose===
It is believed that the creation of the mound was a ritual act, but its meaning is unclear and there are several theories. The timber building may have been built only as a temporary structure to be burned, or it may have briefly served as a temple before its ritual destruction. Scholars suggest that the event was a sacrificial offering to the gods and that the structure was symbolically given to the Otherworld by being ritually burned and buried. Dr Chris Lynn has likened it to the &#x27;wicker man&#x27; rite allegedly carried out by the Gauls, in which a large wooden effigy is burned with a living sacrifice inside. It is thought that the huge outer bank and ditch was made to mark out the hilltop as a sacred space. It could also have been seen as a way of containing the power of the Otherworld within that space.

Dr Richard Warner suggests that the mound was made to be a conduit between this world and the Otherworld. It may be an attempt to replicate an ancient burial mound (&quot;sídhe&quot;), which were believed to be portals to the Otherworld and the homes of ancestral gods. He believes the mound was made as a platform on which druids would perform ceremonies and on which kings would be crowned, while drawing power and authority from the gods and ancestors.

It is possible that each part of the monument represents something. The stones inside the wooden structure may represent souls in the house of the dead, or the souls of fallen warriors in their equivalent of Valhalla. Another theory is that the monument symbolizes a union of the three main classes of society: druids (the wooden frame), warriors (the stones) and farmers (the soil). The central pillar could also represent the world pillar or world tree linking the sky, the earth and the underworld. The radial pattern of the stone cairn may represent the sun wheel, a symbol associated with Celtic sun or sky deities.

Dr Lynn writes: &quot;It seems reasonable to suggest that, in the beginning of the first century BC, Navan was an otherworld place, the home of the gods and goddesses. It was a Celtic tribe&#x27;s sanctuary, its capitol, its sacred symbol of sovereignty and cohesion&quot;.

A recent study used remote sensing (including lidar, photogrammatry, and magnetic gradiometry) to map the site, and found evidence of Iron Age and medieval buildings underground, which co-author Patrick Gleeson says suggests that Navan Fort was &quot;an incredibly important religious center and a place of paramount sacral and cultural authority in later prehistory&quot;.

==In Irish mythology==

In the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology, Emain Macha is the royal capital of the Ulaidh, the people who gave their name to the province of Ulster. It is the residence of Conchobar mac Nessa, king of Ulster. He is said to have had a warrior training school at Emain. Conchobar&#x27;s great hall at Emain was called by medieval writers &quot;in Chraebruad&quot; (the red-branched or red-poled edifice), and his royal warriors are named the Red Branch Knights in English translations.

Emain Macha is said to have been named after Macha, who is believed to have been a sovereignty goddess of the Ulaidh. One tale says that Macha, queen of the Ulaidh, forced her enemy&#x27;s sons to dig the great bank-and-ditch after marking it out with her neck-brooch (&quot;eomuin&quot;), hence the name. In another tale, Macha is the fairy wife of Crunnchu. Despite promising not to speak of her, Crunnchu boasts that his wife can outrun the king&#x27;s horses. The king forces the pregnant Macha to race the horses. She wins, but then gives birth to twins on the finish line. Before dying in childbirth, she curses the Ulstermen to be overcome with the exhaustion of childbirth at the time of their greatest need. This is a fore-tale of the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (Cattle Raid of Cooley). The name Emain Macha is thus explained as &quot;Macha&#x27;s twins&quot;.

The &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; says that the Three Collas conquered the area in 331 AD, burning Emain Macha and driving the Ulaidh eastwards over the River Bann. Another tradition is that Emain Macha was destroyed by Niall of the Nine Hostages, or his sons, in the following century.

Many other characters from Irish mythology are associated with Emain Macha, including:

*Amergin the poet
*Cú Chulainn, the great warrior
*Emer, his strong-willed and beautiful bride
*Conall Cernach, his foster-brother and close friend
*Lóegaire, another warrior
*Cathbad, the chief druid
*Fergus mac Róich, another great warrior and king
*Deirdre of the Sorrows, and Naoise, her brave lover
*Leabharcham, the wise woman

==Conservation and tourism==

Until 1985, the site was threatened by the growth of a nearby limestone quarry. Due mostly to the efforts of the activist group Friends of Navan, a public inquiry held that year halted further quarrying, and recommended that Navan be developed for tourism. A visitor centre, featuring artefacts and audio-visual exhibitions, was opened in 1993, but closed in 2001 for lack of funds. It reopened in 2005 after the site was bought by Armagh City and District Council.

Other significant prehistoric sites nearby include Haughey&#x27;s Fort, an earlier Bronze Age hill fort two-thirds of a mile (1 km) to the west; the King&#x27;s Stables, a manmade pool also dating to the Bronze Age; and Loughnashade, a natural lake which has yielded Iron Age artefacts.

==In popular culture==
Eamhain Mhacha is the name of an Irish traditional music group formed in 2008. Irish heavy metal band Waylander also has a song called &quot;Emain Macha&quot; on their 1998 album &quot;Reawakening Pride Once Lost&quot;.

&quot;Emain Macha&quot; is the name of a place in the computer games &quot;Dark Age of Camelot&quot;, &quot;Mabinogi&quot; and &quot;The Bard&#x27;s Tale&quot;.
&quot;Eamhain Macha&quot; is the name of the capital of Ulster in the &quot;Viking Invasion&quot; expansion to the video game &quot;Medieval Total War&quot;.

<text>Omnium Gatherum is a six-piece melodic death metal band from Finland, founded in the autumn of 1996. Although the band mainly follows the path of the melodic death metal genre, much of their work shows strong influences from progressive metal, especially their later albums. Their music is influenced by Gothenburg-style bands such as At the Gates, In Flames, Dissection, and Dark Tranquillity, but also Iron Maiden, Death, Anathema, and Megadeth among others.


==History==
After releasing four demos, and an EP they recorded after getting signed to Rage of Achilles, their debut full-length album &quot;Spirits And August Light&quot; was released in
April 2003 via Rage Of Achilles and gave the band some attention within the underground metal community and the press.

Next, the band signed to the major metal label Nuclear Blast in the autumn of 2004 to release the second album &quot;Years In Waste&quot;. This album was more technical and progressive than their earlier releases.

In the spring of 2006, long-time singer Antti Filppu was replaced by Jukka Pelkonen aka J.

&quot;Stuck Here On Snakes Way&quot; was the debut OG album featuring J on vocals and it was released in April 2007 after a successful UK tour and a signing to Candlelight Records. The band followed the album with tours alongside Dark Tranquillity, Caliban, and Entombed, as well as a large amount of Finnish headlining gigs, and attained the No. 31 position in the Finnish national
album chart.

Omnium Gatherum&#x27;s fourth album &quot;The Redshift&quot; was recorded at Sound Supreme and SouthEastSounds Studios during the spring days of 2008 and it was mixed and mastered at Unisound Studio in Sweden by the renowned metal musician and producer, Dan Swanö, who stated of the album: &quot;I hate bands like Omnium Gatherum, they are so good it pisses me off!!! Their fine blend of melody and aggression is so good I thought about stealing the record and releasing it as my own :) You won´t find a better album in years.&quot;
Their 2008 album &quot;The Redshift&quot; had generally positive reviews, inked band to do long European tours with Nile/Grave in 2008 and Swallow The Sun/Insomnium in 2009 and even charting in Finnish official album chart to position No. 24.

In the summer of 2008 bassist Eerik Purdon announced that he will be leaving Omnium Gatherum, and In 2009 Toni Mäki Officially joined Omnium Gatherum as their new bassist.

In August 2010, Omnium Gatherum announced that they had signed a deal with Lifeforce Records for their next release, and that their longtime rhythm guitarist Harri Pikka had left the band. Their official statement read &quot;We&#x27;re really sorry to announce also that Harri Pikka has silently decided to flee the OG crew after 13 years of solid service. We don&#x27;t know his exact reasons for this but maybe someday mr. Mystery Man tells us… :) At the moment we&#x27;ve decided to finish the new album as a 5-piece unit, but we have the best possible live guitar unit called Joonas Koto (Malpractice / Ex-To/Die/For / Ex-Hateframe) filling the second guitar live duties at the moment and it rocks!&quot; Omnium Gatherum entered the studio to record their fifth studio album for an early 2011 release. Lead guitarist Markus Vanhala handled all guitar parts for the recording. Mixing and mastering were handled by Dan Swano.

Their fifth album, &quot;New World Shadows&quot;, was released in Germany, Austria and Switzerland on February 4. 2011, in Finland, Sweden and Hungary on February 9, the rest of Europe on February 7, and North America on March 1. &quot;New World Shadows&quot; topped the Finnish album charts and was on the 5th position on official national album chart and was on the 1st position in Finnish Rumba indie chart!
The album was the band&#x27;s first to be released via Lifeforce Records. It was recorded during the period August 2010 - October 2010. After the album release, Omnium Gatherum toured Europe with Rotting Christ in April/May 2011.

New World Shadows was critically acclaimed, and is considered to be one of the best melodic death metal albums in Finnish metal. It is renowned for the mixture of harmonizing melodies along with typical death/heavy metal guitars and drumming. The vocal styles vary from deep death growls to clean vocals. The sound of the album is epic and progressive. 

On June 17 it was announced that Joonas &quot;Jope&quot; Koto had joined Omnium Gatherum as their new full-time second guitarist, replacing Harri Pikka.

On July 10, 2015, the band announced that they had almost finished the recordings for a new album. The album, &quot;Grey Heavens&quot;, was released in 2016.

In 2021, Omnium Gatherum released their ninth studio album &quot;Origin&quot; and announced a North American tour, supported by Allegaeon and Black Crown Initiate.

<doc id="1085308" wikidata="Q902274" url="?curid=1085308" title="Candlepower">
<text>Candlepower (abbreviated as cp or CP) is a unit of measurement for luminous intensity. It expresses levels of light intensity relative to the light emitted by a candle of specific size and constituents. The historical candlepower is equal to 0.981 candelas. In modern usage, &quot;candlepower&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;candela&quot;.

==History==
The term candlepower was originally defined in the United Kingdom, by the Metropolitan Gas Act 1860, as the light produced by a pure spermaceti candle that weighs and burns at a rate of . Spermaceti is a material from the heads of sperm whales, and was once used to make high-quality candles.

At the time the UK established candlepower as a unit, the French standard of light was based on the illumination from a Carcel burner, which defined the illumination that emanates from a lamp burning pure colza oil (obtained from the seed of the plant &quot;Brassica campestris&quot;) at a defined rate. Ten standard candles equaled about one Carcel burner.

In 1909, several agencies met to establish an international standard. It was attended by representatives of the &quot;Laboratoire Central de l’Electricité&quot; (France), the National Physical Laboratory (UK), the Bureau of Standards (United States), and the &quot;Physikalische Technische Reichsanstalt&quot; (Germany). The majority redefined the candle in term of an electric lamp with a carbon filament. The Germans, however, dissented and decided to use a definition equal to 9/10 of the output of a Hefner lamp.

In 1921, the &quot;Commission Internationale de l&#x27;Eclairage&quot; (International Commission for Illumination, commonly referred to as the CIE) redefined the international candle again in terms of a carbon filament incandescent lamp.

In 1937, the international candle was redefined again—against the luminous intensity of a blackbody at the freezing point of liquid platinum which was to be 58.9 international candles per square centimetre.

In 1948, the international unit (SI) candela replaced candlepower. One &quot;candlepower&quot; unit is about 0.981 candela. In general modern use, a &quot;candlepower&quot; now equates directly (1:1) to the number of candelas—an implicit increase from its old value.

==Calibration of lamps==
To measure the candlepower of a lamp, a person judged by eye the relative brightness of adjacent surfaces—one illuminated only by a standard lamp (or candle) and the other only by the lamp under test. They adjusted the distance of one of the lamps until the two surfaces appeared to be of equal brightness. Then they calculated the candlepower of the lamp under test from the two distances and the inverse square law.

==Modern use==
&quot;Candlepower&quot; is largely an obsolete term. However, people still sometimes use it to describe the luminous intensity of high powered flashlights and spotlights. Narrow-beamed lights of all sorts can have very high candlepower specifications, because candlepower measures the intensity of the light on a target, rather than the total amount of light it emits. A given lamp has a higher candlepower rating if its light is more tightly focused.

Candlepower is still used today in law. For example, it is presently used in the California Vehicle Code to define the legal requirements for headlamps and other lamps, including accessory lamps.

Only a few artificial light sources, such as military photoflash bombs, have the very high candlepower ratings characteristic of narrow-beamed spotlights but, simultaneously, a wide unfocused distribution of light.

<text>Imbas forosnai, is a gift of clairvoyance or visionary ability practised by the gifted poets of ancient Ireland.

In Old Irish, &quot;Imbas&quot; imeans &quot;inspiration,&quot; and specifically refers to the sacred poetic inspiration believed to be possessed by the &quot;fili&quot; (Old Irish: inspired, visionary poets) in Early Ireland. &quot;Forosnai&quot; means &quot;illuminated&quot; or &quot;that which illuminates&quot;. Descriptions of the practices associated with &quot;Imbas forosnai&quot; are found in &quot;Cormac&#x27;s Glossary&quot; and in the mythology associated with the hero Fionn mac Cumhaill. In the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailgne&quot;, the woman poet Fedelm uses her &quot;imbas forosnai&quot; to predict the outcome of a battle. &quot;Imbas forosnai&quot; involved the practitioner engaging in sensory deprivation techniques in order to enter a trance and receive answers or prophecy. 

In the Celtic traditions, poetry has always served as a primary conveyance of spiritual truth. Celtic texts differentiate between normal poetry, which is only a matter of learned skill, and &quot;inspired&quot; poetry, which is seen as a gift from the gods.

Some Celtic reconstructionists are involved in the revival of the practices connected with Imbas forosnai.

<text>Directmedia Publishing is a German publishing house created in January 1995 by Ralf Szymanski and Erwin Jurschitza as a publisher of digital media. The emphasis of the publishing house&#x27;s content lies within the field of digital libraries, particularly scientific collections of texts, and encyclopaedias.

In co-operation with the Reclam publishing house in Stuttgart, Directmedia Publishing published the series &quot;Reclam Klassiker auf CD-ROM&quot; (Reclam classical authors on CD-ROM), which presents individual works of the German language . The first German Wikipedia CD was published by Directmedia Publishing in October 2004, and was followed by a DVD-ROM (and CD-ROM) in April 2005. In the first ten days the second edition was presold, 10,000 copies were purchased, 8,000 on Amazon.de.

Directmedia&#x27;s sister enterprise, The Yorck Project (based in Yorck road, Berlin), specialises in the publication of CDs or DVDs with extensive picture collections including art, photography and historical illustrations. The software used to display content runs under Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X, with a beta version for Linux also available. In April 2005, Directmedia contributed scans of 10,000 public domain paintings to the Wikimedia Commons project. In 2007 The Yorck Project was renamed to Zenodot Verlagsgesellschaft mbH and started the online digital library Zeno.org in October 2007.

In 2008 Directmedia Publishing and its sister Zenodot were sold and transferred to Brașov (Romania), led by Claudia Maria Buflea. Zeno.org is meanwhile owned by a non-related company named &quot;Contumax&quot;. The content of Zenodot and DirectMedia Publishing remains nonetheless available.

<text>Om Prakash Puri, (18 October 1950 – 6 January 2017) was an Indian actor who appeared in mainstream commercial Hindi films as well as Urdu, Malayalam, Bengali, Kannada, English, Punjabi, Gujarati, Telugu, and Marathi films, as well as independent and art films and also starred in several international cinema. He is widely regarded as one of the finest actors in world cinema. He won two National Film Awards for Best Actor, two Filmfare Awards and India&#x27;s fourth highest civilian award Padma Shri in 1990. In 2004, he was made an honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

He is best known for his author-backed roles in films like &quot;Aakrosh&quot; (1980), &quot;Arohan&quot; (1982), &quot;Ardh Satya&quot; (1983), television films like &quot;Sadgati&quot; (1981) and &quot;Tamas&quot; (1987), light-hearted roles in &quot;Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro&quot; (1983), &quot;Chachi 420&quot; (1997), &quot;Hera Pheri&quot; (2000), &quot;Chup Chup Ke&quot; (2006) and &quot;Dhol&quot; (2007) and several mainstream commercial films throughout his career. He had various collaborations with director Shyam Benegal and Govind Nihalani. Puri also appeared in non-Indian productions in the United States, Pakistan and Britain. In the 1990s, he appeared in &quot;My Son the Fanatic&quot; (1997) and the comedy drama &quot;East Is East&quot; (1999), receiving a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role.

==Early life==
Om Puri was born in Ambala, Haryana. His father, Tek Chand Puri, worked on the railways and in the Indian Army. Puri&#x27;s parents received no birth certificate and had no records, so his family was unsure of his birth date. But his mother told him he had been born two days after the Hindu festival Dussehra. When he began his schooling, his uncle chose 9 March 1950 as his &quot;official&quot; birthday. However, as an adult when he moved to Mumbai, Puri looked up when Dussehra was celebrated in 1950, to establish his birth date as 18 October.

Puri came from an underprivileged background. When he was six years old, his father who was a railway employee was put behind bars on allegations of theft of cement. This resulted in their family becoming homeless. To make ends meet, Puri&#x27;s brother, Ved Prakash Puri, worked as a coolie (railway porter) and Puri worked in a local tea shop, did odd jobs and collected coal from nearby railways tracks to support his family. He and his brother&#x27;s children were later brought up by a maid servant, Shanti.
While working, Puri continued to study. After his primary education, he joined the National School of Drama in Delhi to study theatre acting. A fellow NSD student who became a long-term friend, Naseeruddin Shah, encouraged Puri to follow him to the Film and Television Institute of India in Poona (present-day Pune). In an interview with &quot;The Times of India&quot;, Puri later recounted his family was so poor that he did not have a decent shirt to wear when he joined FTII. According to Shah, Puri was disappointed by his education at FTII, and also was unable to pay tuition fees—when he became well-known, the institute followed up the debt of ₹280, which Puri refused to pay due to the &quot;impish thrill&quot; of owing them money.

==Career==
Puri&#x27;s first film was &quot;Chor Chor Chhup ja&quot;, a children&#x27;s film. During this time, to make ends meet he also worked at the Actors&#x27; Studio, where future actors such as Gulshan Grover and Anil Kapoor would be his students.

Subsequently, Puri worked in numerous Indian films, as well as many films produced in the United Kingdom and the United States.

Puri made his debut in the mainstream films genre in the 1976 Marathi film &quot;Ghashiram Kotwal&quot;, based on a Marathi play of the same name by Vijay Tendulkar. It was directed by K. Hariharan and Mani Kaul in cooperation with 16 graduates of the FTII. He has claimed that he was paid &quot;peanuts&quot; for his best work. Along with Amrish Puri, Naseeruddin Shah, Shabana Azmi and Smita Patil, he was among the main actors who starred in what was then referred to as art films such as &quot;Bhavni Bhavai&quot; (1980), &quot;Sadgati&quot; (1981), &quot;Ardh Satya&quot; (1982), &quot;Mirch Masala&quot; (1986) and &quot;Dharavi&quot; (1992).

He was critically acclaimed for his performances in many unconventional roles such as a victimized tribal in &quot;Aakrosh&quot; (1980); Jimmy&#x27;s manager in &quot;Disco Dancer&quot; (1982); a police inspector in &quot;Ardh Satya&quot; (1982), for which he got the National Film Award for Best Actor; a humble husband in &quot;Seepeeyan&quot; (1984), Vinod&#x27;s uncle in Zamana the leader of a cell of Sikh militants in &quot;Maachis&quot; (1996); as a tough cop again in the commercial film &quot;Gupt&quot; in 1997; and as the courageous father of a martyred soldier in &quot;Dhoop&quot; (2003).

In 1999, Puri acted in a Kannada film &quot;A.K. 47&quot; as a strict police officer who tries to keep the city safe from the underworld—it became a huge commercial hit. Puri&#x27;s acting in the film is memorable. He rendered his own voice for the Kannada dialogues. In the same year, he starred in the successful British comedy-drama film &quot;East is East&quot;, where he played a first-generation Pakistani immigrant in Northern England, struggling to come to terms with his far more westernised children.

Puri had a cameo in the highly acclaimed film &quot;Gandhi&quot; (1982, directed by Richard Attenborough). In the mid-1990s, he diversified to play character roles in mainstream Hindi cinema, where his roles are more tuned to mass audiences than film critics. He became known internationally by starring in many British films such as &quot;My Son the Fanatic&quot; (1997), &quot;East Is East&quot; (1999) and &quot;The Parole Officer&quot; (2001). He appeared in Hollywood films including &quot;City of Joy&quot; (1992), opposite Patrick Swayze; &quot;Wolf&quot; (1994) with Jack Nicholson; and &quot;The Ghost and the Darkness&quot; (1996) opposite Val Kilmer. In 2007, he appeared as General Zia-ul-Haq in &quot;Charlie Wilson&#x27;s War&quot;, which stars Tom Hanks and Julia Roberts.

He has worked in Hindi television serials like &quot;Kakkaji Kaheen&quot; (1988) (roughly meaning &quot;Uncle Says&quot;) as a paan-chewing &#x27;Kakkaji&#x27;, which was a parody on politicians, and &quot;Mr. Yogi&quot; (1989) as a suave &#x27;Sutradhaar&#x27; who enjoys pulling the protagonist&#x27;s leg. These two serials underlined Om Puri&#x27;s versatility as a comedian. He received critical acclaim for his performance in Govind Nihalani&#x27;s television film &quot;Tamas&quot; (1988) based on a Hindi novel of the same name. He played comic roles in Hindi films like &quot;Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro&quot; which reached a cult status, followed by &quot;Chachi 420&quot; (1997), &quot;Hera Pheri&quot; (2000), &quot;Chor Machaye Shor&quot; (2002), Deewane Hue Pagal, Chup Chup Ke, Kismet Connection and &quot;Malamaal Weekly&quot; (2006) and Oh My God. He was regular in films directed by Priyadarshan and Kamal Haasan.

His notable roles in commercial Hindi films included Drohkaal, In Custody, Narsimha, Ghayal, Mrityudand, Aastha, Hey Ram, Pyar Toh Hona Hi Tha, Farz, Gadar, Lakshya, Dev (2004), Rang De Basanti, Yuva, &quot;Singh Is Kinng&quot;, &quot;Mere Baap Pehle Aap&quot;, &quot;Billu&quot;, Kyunki, Lakshya, Dabangg, Bhaji in Problem, Khap, Bajrangi Bhaijaan, Ghayal Once Again. Puri was seen in the role of Mohammad Ali Kasuri in &quot;Road to Sangam&quot; (2009). In 2010, he appeared in &quot;The Hangman&quot;. In 2011 he was in the Indian action film &quot;Don 2&quot;.

He has also worked in some episodes of the TV series &quot;Aahat&quot; during the second season which was aired between 2004 and 2005 on Sony channel. Other notable television appearances included &quot;Bharat Ek Khoj&quot;, &quot;Yatra&quot;, &quot;Mr. Yogi&quot;, &quot;Kakaji Kahin&quot;, &quot;Sea Hawks&quot;, &quot;Antaral&quot; and &quot;Savdhaan India&quot; second season.

In 2014, he appeared opposite Helen Mirren in the comedy-drama &quot;The Hundred-Foot Journey&quot;. At the time of his death in January 2017, he was working on the Marathi film, &quot;15 August Bhagile 26 January.&quot;

Several of his completed films released after his death including &quot;Viceroy&#x27;s House&quot; and &quot;Tubelight&quot;.

==Personal life==
Puri married director/writer Seema Kapoor, the sister of actor Annu Kapoor, in 1991, but their marriage ended after eight months.

In 1993, he married journalist Nandita Puri, with whom he had a son named Ishaan. In 2009, Nandita wrote a biography of her husband titled &quot;Unlikely Hero: The Story of Om Puri&quot;. Upon the book&#x27;s publication, Puri spoke of his anger at the inclusion of explicit details of his previous relationships. In 2013, Nandita filed an allegation of domestic violence against him, and the two opted for a judicial separation shortly afterwards.

His second wife reported that they kept a &quot;secular house&quot;, but that &quot;while Om is not ritualistic, he does not mind others being so&quot;. He took &quot;solace in spiritual reading&quot;, particularly in the writings of spiritual teacher Eknath Easwaran, many of whose books he shared with friends. Puri seldom took politics seriously, and often found relaxation by cooking or gardening. In an interview to Rajya Sabha TV in 2012, Om Puri spoke about his interest in agriculture and cooking, and suggested that his dream was to open a dhaba by the name Daal Roti.

==Controversies==
In October 2016, Puri appeared for a debate on a news channel regarding a Hindi film producer&#x27;s ban on Pakistani actors after the Uri attack. During the debate, he made insulting comments about Indian soldiers which led to heavy criticism on social media. However, Puri later apologised for his comments.

==Death==
On 6 January 2017, Puri died at the age of 66, after having a heart attack at his residence in Andheri, Mumbai. He was honoured at the 89th Academy Awards in memoriam segment for his contribution in world cinema.

<doc id="1085326" wikidata="Q2396639" url="?curid=1085326" title="Florida breaks">
<text>Florida breaks, which may also be referred to as The Orlando Sound, Orlando breaks, or The Breaks, is a genre of breakbeat dance music that originated in the central region of Florida, United States.
Florida Breaks draws on hip-hop, Miami bass and electro. It often includes samples of early jazz or funk beats from rare groove or popular film. It often features vocal elements. Compared to the hip-hop on which it is based, the style is faster, more syncopated, and has a heavier and unrelenting bassline. The beat frequently slows and breaks down complex beat patterns and then rebuilds. The genre has been described as being easy to dance to while creating an uplifting, happy, or positive mood in the listener.

== History ==

===Late 1980s – early 1990s===

The style emerged during the late &#x27;80s at the Beacham Theatre in Orlando and gained popularity in the local underground music subculture during the city&#x27;s Summer of Love era, roughly 1989 to 1992. Genre pioneer Eddie Pappa, influenced by nights spent at the Beacham, honed his skill at The Edge when it opened in 1992. In 1993, it gained prominence state-wide and, propelled by large events at the Edge, elsewhere in the U.S. and Europe.

===Mid-1990s popularity===

The Breaks influenced producers who mixed breakbeat with progressive and trance, producing a mixture that became known as &quot;The Orlando Sound&quot; or Florida breaks. The sound became popular among DJs and club goers during the mid-1990s. It was marketed internationally as &quot;Orlando friendly.&quot;

English breaks DJ and producer Nick Newton released a 1996 record &quot;Orlando&quot;.

There is only general consensus on the defining elements of the genre, which spawned regional and preference variations. For example, the Orlando Sound of Central and Northern Florida were influenced by new beat, trance, and progressive house sounds. Producers in South Florida and Tampa chose a deep house flavor or retained more of the funk and hip-hop influence of Miami&#x27;s &quot;ghetto-bass&quot; or funky breaks.

The genre received limited local radio play in Central Florida on radio stations WXXL (106.7 FM) and on college radio WPRK (91.5 FM), as well as WUCF (89.9 FM), WFIT (89.5 FM on Space Coast), and WMNF (88.5 FM in Tampa).

===2000s===
The international and local popularity of Florida breaks began to wane in 2000, though it remains popular in Central Florida.

==Early Florida breaks venues ==
AAHZ at the Beacham Theatre (Orlando), The Edge (Orlando). The Abyss (Orlando), The Club at Firestone (Orlando), The Beach Club (Orlando), Icon (Orlando), Simon&#x27;s (Gainesville), Marz (Cocoa Beach), The Edge (Fort. Lauderdale), and Masquerade (Tampa).

<doc id="1085343" wikidata="Q206451" url="?curid=1085343" title="Semi-empirical mass formula">
<text>In nuclear physics, the semi-empirical mass formula (SEMF) (sometimes also called the Weizsäcker formula, Bethe–Weizsäcker formula, or Bethe–Weizsäcker mass formula to distinguish it from the Bethe–Weizsäcker process) is used to approximate the mass of an atomic nucleus from its number of protons and neutrons. As the name suggests, it is based partly on theory and partly on empirical measurements. The formula represents the liquid-drop model proposed by George Gamow, which can account for most of the terms in the formula and gives rough estimates for the values of the coefficients. It was first formulated in 1935 by German physicist Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker, and although refinements have been made to the coefficients over the years, the structure of the formula remains the same today.

The formula gives a good approximation for atomic masses and thereby other effects. However, it fails to explain the existence of lines of greater binding energy at certain numbers of protons and neutrons. These numbers, known as magic numbers, are the foundation of the nuclear shell model.

==Liquid-drop model==

The liquid-drop model was first proposed by George Gamow and further developed by Niels Bohr, John Archibald Wheeler and Lise Meitner. It treats the nucleus as a drop of incompressible fluid of very high density, held together by the nuclear force (a residual effect of the strong force), there is a similarity to the structure of a spherical liquid drop. While a crude model, the liquid-drop model accounts for the spherical shape of most nuclei and makes a rough prediction of binding energy.

The corresponding mass formula is defined purely in terms of the numbers of protons and neutrons it contains. The original Weizsäcker formula defines five terms:
* &quot;Volume energy&quot;, when an assembly of nucleons of the same size is packed together into the smallest volume, each interior nucleon has a certain number of other nucleons in contact with it. So, this nuclear energy is proportional to the volume.
* &quot;Surface energy&quot; corrects for the previous assumption made that every nucleon interacts with the same number of other nucleons. This term is negative and proportional to the surface area, and is therefore roughly equivalent to liquid surface tension.
* &quot;Coulomb energy&quot;, the potential energy from each pair of protons. As this is a repelling force, the binding energy is reduced.
* &quot;Asymmetry energy&quot; (also called Pauli energy), which accounts for the Pauli exclusion principle. Unequal numbers of neutrons and protons imply filling higher energy levels for one type of particle, while leaving lower energy levels vacant for the other type.
* &quot;Pairing energy&quot;, which accounts for the tendency of proton pairs and neutron pairs to occur. An even number of particles is more stable than an odd number due to spin coupling.

==Formula==
The mass of an atomic nucleus, for formula_1 neutrons, formula_2 protons, and therefore formula_3 nucleons, is given by

: formula_4

where formula_5 and formula_6 are the rest mass of a neutron and a proton respectively, and formula_7 is the binding energy of the nucleus. The semi-empirical mass formula states the binding energy is

: formula_8

The formula_9 term is either zero or formula_10, depending on the parity of formula_1 and formula_2, where formula_13 for some exponent formula_14. Note that as formula_3, the numerator of the formula_16 term can be rewritten as formula_17.

Each of the terms in this formula has a theoretical basis. The coefficients formula_18, formula_19, formula_20, formula_16, and formula_22 are determined empirically; while they may be derived from experiment, they are typically derived from least-squares fit to contemporary data. While typically expressed by its basic five terms, further terms exist to explain additional phenomena. Akin to how changing a polynomial fit will change its coefficients, the interplay between these coefficients as new phenomena are introduced is complex; some terms influence each other, whereas the formula_22 term is largely independent.

===Volume term===
The term formula_24 is known as the &quot;volume term&quot;. The volume of the nucleus is proportional to &quot;A&quot;, so this term is proportional to the volume, hence the name.

The basis for this term is the strong nuclear force. The strong force affects both protons and neutrons, and as expected, this term is independent of &quot;Z&quot;. Because the number of pairs that can be taken from &quot;A&quot; particles is formula_25, one might expect a term proportional to formula_26. However, the strong force has a very limited range, and a given nucleon may only interact strongly with its nearest neighbors and next nearest neighbors. Therefore, the number of pairs of particles that actually interact is roughly proportional to &quot;A&quot;, giving the volume term its form.

The coefficient formula_18 is smaller than the binding energy possessed by the nucleons with respect to their neighbors (formula_28), which is of order of 40 MeV. This is because the larger the number of nucleons in the nucleus, the larger their kinetic energy is, due to the Pauli exclusion principle. If one treats the nucleus as a Fermi ball of formula_29 nucleons, with equal numbers of protons and neutrons, then the total kinetic energy is formula_30, with formula_31 the Fermi energy, which is estimated as 38 MeV. Thus the expected value of formula_18 in this model is formula_33 not far from the measured value.

===Surface term===
The term formula_34 is known as the &quot;surface term&quot;. This term, also based on the strong force, is a correction to the volume term.

The volume term suggests that each nucleon interacts with a constant number of nucleons, independent of &quot;A&quot;. While this is very nearly true for nucleons deep within the nucleus, those nucleons on the surface of the nucleus have fewer nearest neighbors, justifying this correction. This can also be thought of as a surface-tension term, and indeed a similar mechanism creates surface tension in liquids.

If the volume of the nucleus is proportional to &quot;A&quot;, then the radius should be proportional to formula_35 and the surface area to formula_36. This explains why the surface term is proportional to formula_36. It can also be deduced that formula_19 should have a similar order of magnitude to formula_18.

===Coulomb term===
The term formula_40 or formula_41 is known as the &quot;Coulomb&quot; or &quot;electrostatic term&quot;.

The basis for this term is the electrostatic repulsion between protons. To a very rough approximation, the nucleus can be considered a sphere of uniform charge density. The potential energy of such a charge distribution can be shown to be
: formula_42

where &quot;Q&quot; is the total charge, and &quot;R&quot; is the radius of the sphere. The value of formula_20 can be approximately calculated by using this equation to calculate the potential energy, using an empirical nuclear radius of formula_44 and &quot;Q&quot; = &quot;Ze&quot;. However, because electrostatic repulsion will only exist for more than one proton, formula_45 becomes formula_46:
: formula_47
where now the electrostatic Coulomb constant formula_20 is
: formula_49

Using the fine-structure constant, we can rewrite the value of formula_20 as

: formula_51

where formula_52 is the fine-structure constant, and formula_53 is the radius of a nucleus, giving formula_54 to be approximately 1.25 femtometers. formula_55 is the proton reduced Compton wavelength, and formula_6 is the proton mass. This gives formula_20 an approximate theoretical value of 0.691 MeV, not far from the measured value.

===Asymmetry term===
The term formula_58 is known as the &quot;asymmetry term&quot; (or &quot;Pauli term&quot;).

The theoretical justification for this term is more complex. The Pauli exclusion principle states that no two identical fermions can occupy exactly the same quantum state in an atom. At a given energy level, there are only finitely many quantum states available for particles. What this means in the nucleus is that as more particles are &quot;added&quot;, these particles must occupy higher energy levels, increasing the total energy of the nucleus (and decreasing the binding energy). Note that this effect is not based on any of the fundamental forces (gravitational, electromagnetic, etc.), only the Pauli exclusion principle.

Protons and neutrons, being distinct types of particles, occupy different quantum states. One can think of two different &quot;pools&quot; of states one for protons and one for neutrons. Now, for example, if there are significantly more neutrons than protons in a nucleus, some of the neutrons will be higher in energy than the available states in the proton pool. If we could move some particles from the neutron pool to the proton pool, in other words, change some neutrons into protons, we would significantly decrease the energy. The imbalance between the number of protons and neutrons causes the energy to be higher than it needs to be, &quot;for a given number of nucleons&quot;. This is the basis for the asymmetry term.

The actual form of the asymmetry term can again be derived by modeling the nucleus as a Fermi ball of protons and neutrons. Its total kinetic energy is
: formula_59
where formula_60 and formula_61 are the Fermi energies of the protons and neutrons. Since these are proportional to formula_62 and formula_63 respectively, one gets
: formula_64 for some constant &quot;C&quot;.
The leading terms in the expansion in the difference formula_65 are then
: formula_66
At the zeroth order in the expansion the kinetic energy is just the overall Fermi energy formula_67 multiplied by formula_68. Thus we get
: formula_69

The first term contributes to the volume term in the semi-empirical mass formula, and the second term is minus the asymmetry term (remember, the kinetic energy contributes to the total binding energy with a &quot;negative&quot; sign).

formula_31 is 38 MeV, so calculating formula_16 from the equation above, we get only half the measured value. The discrepancy is explained by our model not being accurate: nucleons in fact interact with each other and are not spread evenly across the nucleus. For example, in the shell model, a proton and a neutron with overlapping wavefunctions will have a greater strong interaction between them and stronger binding energy. This makes it energetically favourable (i.e. having lower energy) for protons and neutrons to have the same quantum numbers (other than isospin), and thus increase the energy cost of asymmetry between them.

One can also understand the asymmetry term intuitively as follows. It should be dependent on the absolute difference formula_72, and the form formula_73 is simple and differentiable, which is important for certain applications of the formula. In addition, small differences between &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;N&quot; do not have a high energy cost. The &quot;A&quot; in the denominator reflects the fact that a given difference formula_72 is less significant for larger values of &quot;A&quot;.

===Pairing term===

The term formula_75 is known as the &quot;pairing term&quot; (possibly also known as the pairwise interaction). This term captures the effect of spin coupling. It is given by

: formula_76

where formula_77 is found empirically to have a value of about 1000 keV, slowly decreasing with mass number &quot;A&quot;. The binding energy may be increased by converting one of the odd protons or neutrons into a neutron or proton, so the odd nucleon can form a pair with its odd neighbour forming and even &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;N&quot;. The pairs have overlapping wave functions and sit very close together with a bond stronger than any other configuration. When the pairing term is substituted into the binding energy equation, for even &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, the pairing term adds binding energy, and for odd &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;N&quot; the pairing term removes binding energy.

The dependence on mass number is commonly parametrized as
: formula_78

The value of the exponent &quot;k&quot;P is determined from experimental binding-energy data. In the past its value was often assumed to be −3/4, but modern experimental data indicate that a value of −1/2 is nearer the mark:
: formula_79 or formula_80

Due to the Pauli exclusion principle the nucleus would have a lower energy if the number of protons with spin up were equal to the number of protons with spin down. This is also true for neutrons. Only if both &quot;Z&quot; and &quot;N&quot; are even, can both protons and neutrons have equal numbers of spin-up and spin-down particles. This is a similar effect to the asymmetry term.

The factor formula_81 is not easily explained theoretically. The Fermi-ball calculation we have used above, based on the liquid-drop model but neglecting interactions, will give an formula_82 dependence, as in the asymmetry term. This means that the actual effect for large nuclei will be larger than expected by that model. This should be explained by the interactions between nucleons. For example, in the shell model, two protons with the same quantum numbers (other than spin) will have completely overlapping wavefunctions and will thus have greater strong interaction between them and stronger binding energy. This makes it energetically favourable (i.e. having lower energy) for protons to form pairs of opposite spin. The same is true for neutrons.

==Calculating coefficients==
The coefficients are calculated by fitting to experimentally measured masses of nuclei. Their values can vary depending on how they are fitted to the data and which unit is used to express the mass. Several examples are as shown below.

The formula does not consider the internal shell structure of the nucleus.

The semi-empirical mass formula therefore provides a good fit to heavier nuclei, and a poor fit to very light nuclei, especially 4He. For light nuclei, it is usually better to use a model that takes this shell structure into account.

==Examples of consequences of the formula==
By maximizing with respect to &quot;Z&quot;, one would find the best neutron–proton ratio &quot;N&quot;/&quot;Z&quot; for a given atomic weight &quot;A&quot;. We get
: formula_83
This is roughly 1 for light nuclei, but for heavy nuclei the ratio grows in good agreement with experiment.

By substituting the above value of &quot;Z&quot; back into , one obtains the binding energy as a function of the atomic weight, .
Maximizing with respect to &quot;A&quot; gives the nucleus which is most strongly bound, i.e. most stable. The value we get is &quot;A&quot; = 63 (copper), close to the measured values of &quot;A&quot; = 62 (nickel) and &quot;A&quot; = 58 (iron).

The liquid-drop model also allows the computation of fission barriers for nuclei, which determine the stability of a nucleus against spontaneous fission. It was originally speculated that elements beyond atomic number 104 could not exist, as they would undergo fission with very short half-lives, though this formula did not consider stabilizing effects of closed nuclear shells. A modified formula considering shell effects reproduces known data and the predicted island of stability (in which fission barriers and half-lives are expected to increase, reaching a maximum at the shell closures), though also suggests a possible limit to existence of superheavy nuclei beyond &quot;Z&quot; = 120 and &quot;N&quot; = 184.

<doc id="1085344" wikidata="Q6014281" url="?curid=1085344" title="Motivational salience">
<text>Motivational salience is a cognitive process and a form of attention that &quot;motivates&quot; or propels an individual&#x27;s behavior towards or away from a particular object, perceived event or outcome. Motivational salience regulates the intensity of behaviors that facilitate the attainment of a particular goal, the amount of time and energy that an individual is willing to expend to attain a particular goal, and the amount of risk that an individual is willing to accept while working to attain a particular goal.

Motivational salience is composed of two component processes that are defined by their attractive or aversive effects on an individual&#x27;s behavior relative to a particular stimulus: &quot;incentive salience&quot; and &quot;aversive salience&quot;. Incentive salience is the attractive form of motivational salience that causes approach behavior, and is associated with operant reinforcement, desirable outcomes, and pleasurable stimuli. Aversive salience (sometimes known as fearful salience) is the aversive form of motivational salience that causes avoidance behavior, and is associated with operant punishment, undesirable outcomes, and unpleasant stimuli.

==Incentive salience==

Incentive salience is a cognitive process that grants a &quot;desire&quot; or &quot;want&quot; attribute, which includes a motivational component to a rewarding stimulus. &quot;Reward&quot; is the attractive and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior – also known as approach behavior – and consummatory behavior. The &quot;wanting&quot; of incentive salience differs from &quot;liking&quot; in the sense that liking is the pleasure that is immediately gained from the acquisition or consumption of a rewarding stimulus; the &quot;wanting&quot; of incentive salience serves a &quot;motivational magnet&quot; quality of a rewarding stimulus that makes it a desirable and attractive goal, transforming it from a mere sensory experience into something that commands attention, induces approach, and causes it to be sought out.

Incentive salience is regulated by a number of brain structures, but it is assigned to stimuli by a region of the ventral striatum known as the nucleus accumbens shell. Incentive salience is primarily regulated by dopamine neurotransmission in the mesocorticolimbic projection, but activity in other dopaminergic pathways and hedonic hotspots (e.g., the ventral pallidum) also modulate incentive salience.

==Clinical significance==
===Addiction===

The assignment of incentive salience to stimuli is dysregulated in addiction. Addictive drugs are intrinsically rewarding (not to be confused with pleasure) and therefore function as primary positive reinforcers of continued drug use that are assigned incentive salience. During the development of an addiction, the repeated association of otherwise neutral and even non-rewarding stimuli with drug consumption triggers an associative learning process that causes these previously neutral stimuli to act as conditioned positive reinforcers of addictive drug use (i.e., these stimuli start to function as drug cues). As conditioned positive reinforcers of drug use, these previously neutral stimuli are assigned incentive salience (which manifests as a craving) – sometimes at pathologically high levels due to reward sensitization – which can transfer to the primary reinforcer (e.g., the use of an addictive drug) with which it was originally paired. Thus, if an individual remains abstinent from drug use for some time and encounters one of these drug cues, a craving for the associated drug may reappear. For example, anti-drug agencies previously used posters with images of drug paraphernalia as an attempt to show the dangers of drug use. However, such posters are no longer used because of the effects of incentive salience in causing relapse upon sight of the stimuli illustrated in the posters.

In addiction, the &quot;liking&quot; (pleasure or hedonic value) of a drug or other stimulus becomes dissociated from &quot;wanting&quot; (i.e., desire or craving) due to the sensitization of incentive salience. In fact, if the incentive salience associated with drug-taking becomes pathologically amplified, the user may want the drug more and more while liking it less and less as tolerance develops to the drug&#x27;s pleasurable effects.

==Neuropsychopharmacology==

===Dopaminergic psychostimulants===
Amphetamine improves task saliency (motivation to perform a task) and increases arousal (wakefulness), in turn promoting goal-directed behavior. The reinforcing and motivational salience-promoting effects of amphetamine are mostly due to enhanced dopaminergic activity in the mesolimbic pathway.

<text>Tarot is a Finnish heavy metal band. They are most famous for being one of the earliest metal bands in Finland, and for the song &quot;Wings of Darkness&quot; from the 1986 album &quot;Spell of Iron&quot;. While having enjoyed a broad underground popularity in Finland, the band has never been notable elsewhere until gaining new success in recent years, with their singer and bassist Marko Hietala in the largely successful Nightwish for nearly two decades. With a more global audience, the band re-recorded &quot;Spell of Iron&quot; for its 25th anniversary.

== History ==
Tarot was originally formed by the Hietala brothers in the early 1980s. Back then the band was called &quot;Purgatory&quot;. As Purgatory reached the point when they got the record deal, they changed their name to &quot;Tarot&quot; at the insistence of the label Flamingo Records. The line-up settled into the form of Marko Hietala (bass/vocals), Zachary Hietala (guitars), Mako H (guitars) and Pecu Cinnari (drums).

The &quot;Wings of Darkness&quot; single saw the daylight in April 1986 and in December that same year Tarot released their first full-length album &quot;Spell of Iron&quot;. In April 1988, following the release of a single &quot;Rose on the Grave&quot;, their second album &quot;Follow Me into Madness&quot; was released.

After the second album, there was a hiatus in the band. During this &quot;vacation&quot; the line-up changed a little bit and a keyboardist was added to the band as Janne Tolsa joined Tarot and replaced the second guitarist Mako H. After long preparation, the third album &quot;To Live Forever&quot; came out in February 1993. Tarot received good publicity in Japan, making their first live album &quot;To Live Again&quot; to be released as a Japanese special edition in November 1994. The live album was recorded at Tavastia Club, Helsinki in August 1994. Some of the songs from the live album were released the following year on a limited edition bonus CD with the next studio album, &quot;Stigmata&quot;. &quot;To Live Forever&quot; was remixed and re-released in 2006 together with all the previous albums.

Much anticipated &quot;For the Glory of Nothing&quot; came out in 1998. &quot;Shining Black&quot;, a Tarot compilation album, came out in Japan in December 1998. While Tarot was inactive, Marko also played in the bands Conquest and Sinergy. Together with other members of Conquest, Marko played cover songs under the name Metal Gods. Marko became a member of Nightwish in 2001. Tolsa played the keyboards for Virtuocity&#x27;s &quot;Secret Visions&quot; album as Marko sang a few songs on it. In summer 2002 Tarot played a special &#x27;80s gig in Kuopio, playing material only from the first two albums.

In March 2003, the compilation &quot;Shining Black&quot; was released again in the rest of the world. Tarot signed a new record deal with Spinefarm Records and the new studio album &quot;Suffer Our Pleasures&quot; was released. While the album did well in Finland, it was barely noticed elsewhere.

During these years Marko was busy with his other band Nightwish by recording and touring around the world. Tolsa worked on an album with Eternal Tears of Sorrow and toured with the industrial metal band Turmion Kätilöt.

Early 2006, Tarot&#x27;s earlier label Bluelight Records released a collection of the band&#x27;s first six albums remastered with a large amount of bonus material, unreleased demos, live and special versions of the songs and some covers. Some of the albums were also remixed.

The fans had been expecting the re-releases for years and the collection was so successful that in May 2006, when Tarot released the new single &quot;You&quot;, it made number one on the Finnish charts for the first time in the history of the band. During that time, the band formalized their long-time roadie/backing vocalist Tommi Salmela as a band member after being with the band for more than a decade.

Early 2006, Tarot was signed to KingFoo Entertainment in Finland, with Nuclear Blast covering the rest of Europe. During summer of 2006, the band not only toured various clubs and festivals but also composed, demoed and recorded new material. The album &quot;Crows Fly Black&quot; was released in October 2006.

On 11 June 2008, Tarot released their first live DVD, &quot;Undead Indeed&quot;. The DVD also had a live album counterpart. They followed the release with a short tour in support of &quot;Undead Indeed&quot;, which began 30 January 2009.

Their new album, entitled &quot;Gravity of Light&quot;, was released in Finland on 10 March 2010, in Europe on 23 April 2010, the UK on 26 April 2010, and in North America on 8 June 2010.

On 11 September 2016, it was announced on Facebook that drummer Pecu Cinnari had died due to a long-term illness. Since then, the band was on hiatus, during which Marko departed from Nightwish, though he stated in an interview that new material from Tarot is still &quot;up in the air&quot;.

In March 2023, the band announced they will reunite for a one-off show on 26 July in Kuopio, Finland, with Turmion Kätilöt drummer Antero Seppänen filling in Cinnari. They performed at Tuska Festival in June 2024.

<text>Toronto Centre () is a federal electoral district in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, that has been represented in the House of Commons of Canada from 1872 to 1925, and since 1935, under the names Centre Toronto (1872–1903), Toronto Centre (1903–1925, and since 2004), Rosedale (1935–1997), and Toronto Centre—Rosedale (1997–2004).

Toronto Centre contains a large part of Downtown Toronto. The riding contains areas such as Regent Park (Canada&#x27;s first social housing development), St. James Town (a largely immigrant area and the most densely populated neighbourhood in Canada), Cabbagetown, Church and Wellesley (a historic LGBTQ2 neighbourhood), Toronto Metropolitan University, the Toronto Eaton Centre and part of the city&#x27;s financial district (the east side of Bay Street). At just under , it is the smallest riding in Canada by area.

==History==
Centre Toronto riding was first created in 1872 from portions of West Toronto and East Toronto. In 1903, the name was changed to Toronto Centre. In 1924, the riding was broken into Toronto East Centre, Toronto West Centre and Toronto South.

A riding covering much the same area was created in 1933 named &quot;Rosedale&quot; after the wealthy neighbourhood of Rosedale. This riding was replaced with &quot;Toronto Centre—Rosedale&quot; in 1996, but the quickly growing population resulted in large areas being shaved off on all sides. In 2003, Toronto Centre—Rosedale was abolished, and a new riding somewhat to the east was created named &quot;Toronto Centre&quot;.

Each of the four major national political parties (the Liberal Party, the Conservative Party, the Green Party, and the NDP), have active federal and provincial riding associations which act as the local party organizations in the riding. Since the early 1990s, however, most contests have been between the Liberals and NDP.

This riding lost territory to University—Rosedale and Spadina—Fort York, and gained a small fraction of territory from Trinity—Spadina during the 2012 electoral redistribution. This made Toronto Centre the smallest size riding in the country, beating Papineau in Montreal by 4 km2.

Historically, the riding was one of the few in central Toronto where the Progressive Conservatives usually did well. The PCs held the riding for 34 of the 58 years from 1935 to 1993. However, it has been in Liberal hands without interruption since 1993. The 2012 federal electoral redistribution shifted much of the wealthier northern part of the riding, which included Rosedale, to the new riding of University—Rosedale.

The riding was represented by former interim Liberal leader Bob Rae after the federal by-elections of March 17, 2008. Rae resigned from Parliament on July 31, 2013. Liberal Chrystia Freeland picked up the riding in the subsequent by-election, and held it until the 2015 Canadian federal election, when she chose to run for re-election in the new riding of University—Rosedale.

From 2015 to 2020, the riding was represented by Bill Morneau. On August 17, 2020, Morneau resigned as MP. Following a by-election on October 26, 2020, the riding has been represented by Marci Ien.

<text>In neuroanatomy, the superior colliculus () is a structure lying on the roof of the mammalian midbrain. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the homologous structure is known as the optic tectum or optic lobe. The adjective form &quot;tectal&quot; is commonly used for both structures.

In mammals, the superior colliculus forms a major component of the midbrain. It is a paired structure and together with the paired inferior colliculi forms the corpora quadrigemina. The superior colliculus is a layered structure, with a pattern that is similar in all mammals. The layers can be grouped into the superficial layers (stratum opticum and above) and the deeper remaining layers. Neurons in the superficial layers receive direct input from the retina and respond almost exclusively to visual stimuli. Many neurons in the deeper layers also respond to other modalities, and some respond to stimuli in multiple modalities. The deeper layers also contain a population of motor-related neurons, capable of activating eye movements as well as other responses. In other vertebrates the number of layers in the homologous optic tectum varies.

The general function of the tectal system is to direct behavioral responses toward specific points in body-centered space. Each layer contains a topographic map of the surrounding world in retinotopic coordinates, and activation of neurons at a particular point in the map evokes a response directed toward the corresponding point in space. In primates, the superior colliculus has been studied mainly with respect to its role in directing eye movements. Visual input from the retina, or &quot;command&quot; input from the cerebral cortex, creates a &quot;bump&quot; of activity in the tectal map which, if strong enough, induces a saccadic eye movement. Even in primates, however, the superior colliculus is also involved in generating spatially directed head turns, arm-reaching movements, and shifts in attention that do not involve any overt movements. In other species, the superior colliculus is involved in a wide range of responses, including whole-body turns in walking rats. In mammals, and especially primates, the massive expansion of the cerebral cortex reduces the superior colliculus to a much smaller fraction of the whole brain. It remains nonetheless important in terms of its function as the primary integrating center for eye movements.

In non-mammalian species the optic tectum is involved in many responses including swimming in fish, flying in birds, tongue-strikes toward prey in frogs, and fang-strikes in snakes. In some species, including fish and birds, the optic tectum, also known as the optic lobe, is one of the largest components of the brain.

&quot;Note on terminology:&quot; This article follows terminology established in the literature, using the term &quot;superior colliculus&quot; when discussing mammals and &quot;optic tectum&quot; when discussing either specific non-mammalian species or vertebrates in general.

==Structure==

The superior colliculus is a paired structure of the dorsal midbrain and is part of the midbrain tectum. The two superior colliculi are situated inferior/caudal to the pineal gland and the splenium of corpus callosum. They are overlapped by the pulvinar of the thalamus, and a medial geniculate nucleus of the thalamus is situated lateral to either superior colliculus. The two inferior colliculi are situated immediately inferior/caudal to the superior colliculi; the inferior and superior colliculi are known collectively as the corpora quadrigemina (Latin for &quot;quadruplet bodies&quot;). The superior colliculi are larger than the inferior colliculi, though the inferior colliculi are more prominent.

The brachium of superior colliculus (or superior brachium) is a branch that extends laterally from the superior colliculus, and, passing to the thalamus between the pulvinar and the medial geniculate nuclei, is partly continued into an eminence called the lateral geniculate nucleus, and partly into the optic tract.

The superior colliculus is associated with a nearby structure called the parabigeminal nucleus, often referred to as its satellite. In the optic tectum this nearby structure is known as the nucleus isthmi.

The superior colliculus is a synaptic layered structure. The microstructure of the superior colliculus and of the optic tectum, varies across species. As a general rule, there is always a clear distinction between superficial layers, which receive input primarily from the visual system and show primarily visual responses, and deeper layers, which receive many types of input and project to numerous motor-related brain areas. The distinction between these two zones is so clear and consistent that some anatomists have suggested that they should be considered separate brain structures.

In mammals, seven layers are identified The top three layers are called &quot;superficial&quot;:
*Lamina I or SZ, the &quot;stratum zonale&quot;, is a thin layer consisting of small myelinated axons together with marginal and horizontal cells.
*Lamina II or SGS, the &quot;stratum griseum superficiale&quot; (&quot;superficial gray layer&quot;), contains many neurons of various shapes and sizes.
*Lamina III or SO, the &quot;stratum opticum&quot; (&quot;optic layer&quot;), consists mainly of axons coming from the optic tract.

Next come two &quot;intermediate layers&quot;:
*Lamina IV or SGI, the &quot;stratum griseum intermedium&quot; (&quot;intermediate gray layer&quot;), is the thickest layer, and is filled with many neurons of many sizes. This layer is often as thick as all the other layers together. It is often subdivided into &quot;upper&quot; and &quot;lower&quot; parts.
*Lamina V or SAI, the &quot;stratum album intermedium&quot; (&quot;intermediate white layer&quot;), consists mainly of fibers from various sources.

Finally come the two &quot;deep layers&quot;:
*Lamina VI or SGP, the &quot;stratum griseum profundum&quot; (&quot;deep gray layer&quot;), consists of loosely packed neurons and myelinated fibers.
*Lamina VII or SAP, the &quot;stratum album profundum&quot; (&quot;deep white layer&quot;), lying directly above the periaqueductal gray, consists entirely of fibers.

===Neural circuitry===
The superficial layers receive input mainly from the retina, vision-related areas of the cerebral cortex, and two tectal-related structures called the pretectum and &quot;parabigeminal nucleus&quot;. The retinal input encompasses the entire superficial zone, and is bilateral, although the contralateral portion is more extensive. The cortical input comes most heavily from the primary visual cortex (area 17, V1), the secondary visual cortex (areas 18 and 19), and the frontal eye fields. The parabigeminal nucleus plays a very important role in tectal function that is described below.

In contrast to the vision-dominated inputs to the superficial layers, the intermediate and deep layers receive inputs from a very diverse set of sensory and motor structures. Most areas of the cerebral cortex project to these layers, although the input from &quot;association&quot; areas tends to be heavier than the input from primary sensory or motor areas. However, the cortical areas involved, and the strength of their relative projections, differ across species. Another important input comes from the substantia nigra, pars reticulata, a component of the basal ganglia. This projection uses the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA, and is thought to exert a &quot;gating&quot; effect on the superior colliculus. The intermediate and deep layers also receive input from the spinal trigeminal nucleus, which conveys somatosensory information from the face, as well as the hypothalamus, zona incerta, thalamus, and inferior colliculus.

In addition to their distinctive inputs, the superficial and deep zones of the superior colliculus also have distinctive outputs. One of the most important outputs goes to the pulvinar and lateral intermediate areas of the thalamus, which in turn project to areas of the cerebral cortex that are involved in controlling eye movements. There are also projections from the superficial zone to the pretectal nuclei, lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, and the parabigeminal nucleus. The projections from the deeper layers are more extensive. There are two large descending pathways, traveling to the brainstem and spinal cord, and numerous ascending projections to a variety of sensory and motor centers, including several that are involved in generating eye movements.

Both colliculi also have descending projections to the paramedian pontine reticular formation and spinal cord, and thus can be involved in responses to stimuli faster than cortical processing would allow.

==== Mosaic structure ====
On detailed examination, the collicular layers are actually not smooth sheets, but divided into a honeycomb arrangement of discrete columns. The clearest indication of columnar structure comes from the cholinergic inputs arising from the parabigeminal nucleus, whose terminals form evenly spaced clusters that extend from top to bottom of the tectum. Several other neurochemical markers including calretinin, parvalbumin, GAP-43, and NMDA receptors, and connections with numerous other brain structures in the brainstem and diencephalon, also show a corresponding inhomogeneity. The total number of columns has been estimated at around 100. The functional significance of this columnar architecture is not clear, but it is interesting that recent evidence has implicated the cholinergic inputs as part of a recurrent circuit producing winner-take-all dynamics within the tectum, as described in more detail below.

All species that have been examined — including mammals and non-mammals — show compartmentalization, but there are some systematic differences in the details of the arrangement. In species with a streak-type retina (mainly species with laterally placed eyes, such as rabbits and deer), the compartments cover the full extent of the SC. In species with a centrally placed fovea, however, the compartmentalization breaks down in the front (rostral) part of the SC. This portion of the SC contains many &quot;fixation&quot; neurons that fire continually while the eyes remain fixed in a constant position.

==Function==
The history of investigation of the optic tectum has been marked by several large shifts in opinion. Before about 1970, most studies involved non-mammals — fish, frogs, birds — that is, species in which the optic tectum is the dominant structure that receives input from the eyes. The general view then was that the optic tectum, in these species, is the main visual center in the non-mammalian brain, and, as a consequence, is involved in a wide variety of behaviors. From the 1970s to 1990s, however, neural recordings from mammals, mostly monkeys, focused primarily on the role of the superior colliculus in controlling eye movements. This line of investigation came to dominate the literature to such a degree that the majority opinion was that eye-movement control is the only important function in mammals, a view still reflected in many current textbooks.

In the late 1990s, however, experiments using animals whose heads were free to move showed clearly that the SC actually produces &quot;gaze shifts&quot;, usually composed of combined head and eye movements, rather than eye movements &quot;per se&quot;. This discovery reawakened interest in the full breadth of functions of the superior colliculus, and led to studies of multisensory integration in a variety of species and situations. Nevertheless, the role of the SC in controlling eye movements is understood in much greater depth than any other function.

Behavioral studies have shown that the SC is not needed for object recognition, but plays a critical role in the ability to direct behaviors toward specific objects, and can support this ability even in the absence of the cerebral cortex. Thus, cats with major damage to the visual cortex cannot recognize objects, but may still be able to follow and orient toward moving stimuli, although more slowly than usual. If one half of the SC is removed, however, the cats will circle constantly toward the side of the lesion, and orient compulsively toward objects located there, but fail to orient at all toward objects located in the opposite hemifield. These deficits diminish over time but never disappear.

===Eye movements===

In primates, eye movements can be divided into several types: fixation, in which the eyes are directed toward a motionless object, with eye movements only to compensate for movements of the head; smooth pursuit, in which the eyes move steadily to track a moving object; saccades, in which the eyes move very rapidly from one location to another; and vergence, in which the eyes move simultaneously in opposite directions to obtain or maintain single binocular vision. The superior colliculus is involved in all of these, but its role in saccades has been studied most intensively.

Each of the two colliculi — one on each side of the brain — contains a two-dimensional map representing half of the visual field. The fovea — the region of maximum sensitivity — is represented at the front edge of the map, and the periphery at the back edge. Eye movements are evoked by activity in the deep layers of the SC. During fixation, neurons near the front edge — the foveal zone — are tonically active. During smooth pursuit, neurons a small distance from the front edge are activated, leading to small eye movements. For saccades, neurons are activated in a region that represents the point to which the saccade will be directed. Just prior to a saccade, activity rapidly builds up at the target location and decreases in other parts of the SC. The coding is rather broad, so that for any given saccade the activity profile forms a &quot;hill&quot; that encompasses a substantial fraction of the collicular map: The location of the peak of this &quot;hill&quot; represents the saccade target.

The SC encodes the target of a gaze shift, but it does not seem to specify the precise movements needed to get there. The decomposition of a gaze shift into head and eye movements and the precise trajectory of the eye during a saccade depend on integration of collicular and non-collicular signals by downstream motor areas, in ways that are not yet well understood. Regardless of how the movement is evoked or performed, the SC encodes it in &quot;retinotopic&quot; coordinates: that is, the location of the SC &#x27;hill&quot; corresponds to a fixed location on the retina. This seems to contradict the observation that stimulation of a single point on the SC can result in different gaze shift directions, depending on initial eye orientation. However, it has been shown that this is because the retinal location of a stimulus is a non-linear function of target location, eye orientation, and the spherical geometry of the eye.

There has been some controversy about whether the SC merely commands eye movements, and leaves the execution to other structures, or whether it actively participates in the performance of a saccade. In 1991, Munoz et al., on the basis of data they collected, argued that, during a saccade, the &quot;hill&quot; of activity in the SC moves gradually, to reflect the changing offset of the eye from the target location while the saccade is progressing. At present, the predominant view is that, although the &quot;hill&quot; does shift slightly during a saccade, it does not shift in the steady and proportionate way that the &quot;moving hill&quot; hypothesis predicts. However, moving hills may play another role in the superior colliculus; more recent experiments have demonstrated a continuously moving hill of visual memory activity when the eyes move slowly while a separate saccade target is retained.

The output from the motor sector of the SC goes to a set of midbrain and brainstem nuclei, which transform the &quot;place&quot; code used by the SC into the &quot;rate&quot; code used by oculomotor neurons. Eye movements are generated by six muscles, arranged in three orthogonally-aligned pairs. Thus, at the level of the final common path, eye movements are encoded in essentially a Cartesian coordinate system.

Although the SC receives a strong input directly from the retina, in primates it is largely under the control of the cerebral cortex, which contains several areas that are involved in determining eye movements. The frontal eye fields, a portion of the motor cortex, are involved in triggering intentional saccades, and an adjoining area, the supplementary eye fields, are involved in organizing groups of saccades into sequences. The parietal eye fields, farther back in the brain, are involved mainly in reflexive saccades, made in response to changes in the view. Recent evidence suggests that the primary visual cortex (V1) guides reflexive eye movements, according to V1 Saliency Hypothesis, using a bottom-up saliency map of the visual field generated in V1 from external visual inputs.

The SC only receives visual inputs in its superficial layers, whereas the deeper layers of the colliculus receive also auditory and somatosensory inputs and are connected to many sensorimotor areas of the brain. The colliculus as a whole is thought to help orient the head and eyes toward something seen and heard.

The superior colliculus also receives auditory information from the inferior colliculus. This auditory information is integrated with the visual information already present to produce the ventriloquism effect.

=== Distractibility ===
As well as being related to eye movements, the SC appears to have an important role to play in the circuitry underpinning distractibility. Heightened distractibility occurs in normal aging and is also a central feature in a number of medical conditions, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Research has shown that lesions to the SC in a number of species can result in heightened distractibility and, in humans, removing the inhibitory control on the SC from the pre-frontal cortex, therefore increasing activity in the area, also increases distractibility. Research in an animal model of ADHD, the spontaneously hypertensive rat, also shows altered collicular-dependent behaviours and physiology. Furthermore, amphetamine (a mainstay treatment for ADHD) also suppresses activity in the colliculus in healthy animals.

==Other animals==
===Other mammals===
====Primates====
It is usually accepted that the primate superior colliculus is unique among mammals, in that it does not contain a complete map of the visual field seen by the contralateral eye. Instead, like the visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus, each colliculus represents only the contralateral half of the visual field, up to the midline, and excludes a representation of the ipsilateral half. This functional characteristic is explained by the absence, in primates, of anatomical connections between the retinal ganglion cells in the temporal half of the retina and the contralateral superior colliculus. In other mammals, the retinal ganglion cells throughout the contralateral retina project to the contralateral colliculus. This distinction between primates and non-primates has been one of the key lines of evidence in support of the flying primates theory proposed by Australian neuroscientist Jack Pettigrew in 1986, after he discovered that flying foxes (megabats) resemble primates in terms of the pattern of anatomical connections between the retina and superior colliculus.

====Cats====
In the cat the superior colliculus projects through the reticular formation and interacts with motor neurons in the brainstem.

====Bats====
Bats are not, in fact, blind, but they depend much more on echolocation than vision for navigation and prey capture. They obtain information about the surrounding world by emitting sonar chirps and then listening for the echoes. Their brains are highly specialized for this process, and some of these specializations appear in the superior colliculus. In bats, the retinal projection occupies only a thin zone just beneath the surface, but there are extensive inputs from auditory areas, and outputs to motor areas capable of orienting the ears, head, or body. Echoes coming from different directions activate neurons at different locations in the collicular layers, and activation of collicular neurons influences the chirps that the bats emit. Thus, there is a strong case that the superior colliculus performs the same sorts of functions for the auditory-guided behaviors of bats that it performs for the visual-guided behaviors of other species.

Bats are usually classified into two main groups: Microchiroptera (the most numerous, and commonly found throughout the world), and Megachiroptera (fruit bats, found in Asia, Africa and Australasia). With one exception, Megabats do not echolocate, and rely on a developed sense of vision to navigate. The visual receptive fields of neurons in the superior colliculus in these animals form a precise map of the retina, similar to that found in cats and primates.

====Rodents====
The superior colliculus in rodents have been hypothesized to mediate sensory-guided approach and avoidance behaviors. Studies employing circuit analysis tools on mouse superior colliculus have revealed several important functions. In a series of studies, researchers have identified a set of Ying-Yang circuit modules in the superior colliculus to initiate prey capture and predator avoidance behaviors in mice. In mice it has been found to map the touch control of tongue for handling food and water when chewing and swallowing. By using single-cell RNA-sequencing, researchers have analyzed the gene expression profiles of superior colliculus neurons and identified the unique genetic markers of these circuit modules.

===Other vertebrates===
====Optic tectum====

The optic tectum is the visual center in the non-mammalian brain which develops from the alar plate of the mesencephalon. In these other vertebrates the connections from the optic tectum are important for the recognition and reaction to various sized objects which is facilitated by excitatory optic nerve transmitters like L-glutamate.

Disrupting visual experience early on in zebrafish development results in a change in tectal activity. Changes in tectal activity resulted in an inability to successfully hunt and capture prey. Hypothalamus inhibitory signaling to the deep tectal neuropil is important in tectal processing in zebrafish larvae. The tectal neuropil contains structures including periventricular neuronal axons and dendrites. The neuropil also contains GABAergic superficial inhibitory neurons located in stratum opticum. Instead of a large cerebral cortex, zebrafish have a relatively large optic tectum that is hypothesized to carry out some of the visual processing that the cortex performs in mammals.

Recent lesion studies have suggested that the optic tectum has no influence over higher-order motion responses like the optomotor response or the optokinetic response, but may be more integral to lower-order cues in motion perception like in the identification of small objects.

The optic tectum is one of the fundamental components of the vertebrate brain, existing across a range of species. Some aspects of the structure are very consistent, including a structure composed of a number of layers, with a dense input from the optic tracts to the superficial layers and another strong input conveying somatosensory input to deeper layers. Other aspects are highly variable, such as the total number of layers (from 3 in the African lungfish to 15 in the goldfish), and the number of different types of cells (from 2 in the lungfish to 27 in the house sparrow).

The optic tectum is closely associated with an adjoining structure called the nucleus isthmi, which has drawn a lot of interest because it evidently makes a very important contribution to tectal function. (In the superior colliculus the like structure is termed the parabigeminal nucleus). The nucleus isthmii is divided into two parts, called &quot;isthmus pars magnocellularis&quot; (Imc; &quot;the part with the large cells&quot;) and &quot;isthmus pars parvocellularis&quot; (Ipc); &quot;the part with the small cells&quot;). Connections between the three areas — optic tectum, Ipc, and Imc — are topographic. Neurons in the superficial layers of the optic tectum project to corresponding points in the Ipc and Imc. The projections to the Ipc are tightly focused, while the projections to the Imc are somewhat more diffuse. Ipc gives rise to tightly focused cholinergic projections both to Imc and the optic tectum. In the optic tectum, the cholinergic inputs from Ipc ramify to give rise to terminals that extend across an entire column, from top to bottom. Imc, in contrast, gives rise to GABAergic projections to Ipc and optic tectum that spread very broadly in the lateral dimensions, encompassing most of the retinotopic map. Thus, the tectum-Ipc-Imc circuit causes tectal activity to produce recurrent feedback that involves tightly focused excitation of a small column of neighboring tectal neurons, together with global inhibition of distant tectal neurons.

The optic tectum is involved in many responses including swimming in fish, flight in birds, tongue-strikes toward prey in frogs, and fang-strikes in snakes. In some species, including fish and birds, the optic tectum, also known as the optic lobe, is one of the largest components of the brain.

In hagfish, lamprey, and shark it is a relatively small structure, but in teleost fish it is greatly expanded, in some cases becoming the largest structure in the brain. In amphibians, reptiles, and especially birds it is also a very significant component.

In snakes that can detect infrared radiation, such as pythons and pit vipers, the initial neural input is through the trigeminal nerve instead of the optic tract. The rest of the processing is similar to that of the visual sense and, thus, involves the optic tectum.

===Fish===
====Lamprey====
The lamprey has been extensively studied because it has a relatively simple brain that is thought in many respects to reflect the brain structure of early vertebrate ancestors. Inspired by the pioneering work of Carl Rovainen that began in the 1960s (see ), since the 1970s Sten Grillner and his colleagues at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm have used the lamprey as a model system to try to work out the principles of motor control in vertebrates, starting in the spinal cord and working upward into the brain. In common with other systems (see for a historical perspective of the idea), neural circuits within the spinal cord seem capable of generating some basic rhythmic motor patterns underlying swimming, and that these circuits are influenced by specific locomotor areas in the brainstem and midbrain, that are in turn influenced by higher brain structures including the basal ganglia and tectum. In a study of the lamprey tectum published in 2007, they found that electrical stimulation could elicit eye movements, lateral bending movements, or swimming activity, and that the type, amplitude, and direction of movement varied as a function of the location within the tectum that was stimulated. These findings were interpreted as consistent with the idea that the tectum generates goal-directed locomotion in the lamprey as shown in other species.

===Birds===

In birds the optic tectum is involved in flight and is one of the largest brain components. The study of avian visual processing has enabled a greater understanding of that in mammals including humans.

<text>An  or ollamh (; anglicised as ollave or ollav), plural ollomain, in early Irish literature, was a master in a particular trade or skill.

==Bard==
Generally, &quot;ollam&quot; referred to a professional poet or bard of literature and history, and a member of the highest of the seven ranks of filí, achieved after at least twelve years of study, 

As part of a king&#x27;s court, the ollam might combine the functions of poet, story-teller, and historian, including an accurate recitation of genealogies. The calling to the vocation was usually a family tradition.

As early as 574, members of the Ó hUiginn (O&#x27;Higgins) clan were recorded as hereditary poets in the courts of Irish Princes and Chiefs. As such they were accorded a status of nobility second in rank only to the King and were entitled to wear the same number of colours in their robes.

==Other uses==
The term was also used to refer to the highest member of any group; thus an &quot;ollam brithem&quot; would be the highest rank of judge, and an &quot;ollam rí&quot; the highest rank of king. Ollav was also applied to a druidic rank; meaning much the same as &quot;professor&quot;, or person of great learning. 

There was an official post in ancient Ireland called the &quot;Rí Ollam&quot; or &quot;Ard Ollam&quot; or Chief Ollam of Ireland. The holder of the post had a standing equal to the High King of Ireland.

Ollamh Fodhla was the title of the mythical 18th High King of Ireland who is said to have first formed the assembly known as the &quot;Feis Teamhrach&quot;, or Feast of Tara around 1300 BCE.

==Literary fosterage==
In Ancient Ireland, ollams taught children with or without compensation depending on the circumstance.

<text>Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is a U.S. national monument and UNESCO biosphere reserve located in extreme southern Arizona that shares a border with the Mexican state of Sonora. The park is the only place in the United States where the senita and organ pipe cactus grow wild. Along with this species, many other types of cacti and other desert flora native to the Yuma Desert section of the Sonoran Desert region grow in the park. Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is in size. In 1976 the monument was declared a Biosphere Reserve by UNESCO, and in 1977 95% of Organ Pipe Cactus was declared a wilderness area.

Land for the Monument was donated by the Arizona state legislature to the federal government during Prohibition knowing that the north–south road would be improved and make contraband alcohol easier to import from Mexico. In 1937 the land was officially opened as a national monument.

At the north entrance of the park is the unincorporated community of Why, Arizona; the town of Lukeville, Arizona at the park&#x27;s southern border is a border crossing point to Sonoyta, Sonora, Mexico.

Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument is bordered to the northwest by Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge and to the east by the Tohono O&#x27;odham Indian Reservation.

==Mexico-United States barrier==

The visitor center has been named in honor of Ranger Kris Eggle. On August 9, 2002, he was shot and killed by a drug smuggler during a United States Border Patrol operation. With a continuing, steady flow of immigrants and drug runners from Mexico, the majority of the park was closed in 2003. The National Park Service reopened the backcountry in 2014 after surveillance towers, vehicle barriers, and pedestrian fences were installed along the border.

The first panels of a new Arizona, US-Mexico border wall were installed in August 2019 on a stretch of Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument. It is the first of three projects that will add bollard walls along Southern Arizona&#x27;s wildlife refuges. The National Park Service issued a report on September 18, 2019, stating that the barrier wall threatens archaeological artifacts representing 16,000 years of human history. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency said that five archaeological sites fall within the area that it wishes to construct.

In February 2020, controlled demolition and other construction work was performed within the Roosevelt Reservation. This strip of land along the border is federally controlled. However, many sites within this region are considered sacred by the Tohono O&#x27;odham Nation. Important sites include Monument Hill, which is a ceremonial and historic battle site and burial ground; and Quitobaquito Springs, which is a local water source and the site of an annual salt pilgrimage. For this reason, construction was opposed by many locals, including Representative Raúl Grijalva and Tohono O’odham Nation Chairman Ned Norris, Jr., who testified before Congress on the matter. Customs and Border Protection officials maintained that no human remains or artifacts were discovered in the areas where explosives were used, and that Monument Hill was previously disturbed in 2010 when the existing border fence was installed.

<text>Thy Serpent is a Finnish black metal band from Espoo. It started out as a solo project by Sami Tenetz in 1992. A full lineup was acquired in 1995. 

== History ==
After two demos, he signed a record deal with Spinefarm Records. Azhemin, Agathon and Luopio joined between 1995 and 1996 when they released their debut, &quot;Forests of Witchery&quot;. &quot;Only Dust Moves&quot; was featured on the Nightwish single &quot;The Carpenter&quot;. After their debut album&#x27;s success, their international debut, &quot;Christcrusher&quot;, followed.

Contrary to their statements that they would never play live, they did eight gigs in Finland in the summer of 1999. In 2000, Thy Serpent changed its line-up, adding a second guitarist and a new drummer. During that year, they went to the studio to record &quot;Death&quot;, which remains the last record by the band. They are now signed to Candlelight Records.

<doc id="1085361" wikidata="Q358512" url="?curid=1085361" title="Inferior colliculus">
<text>The inferior colliculus (IC) (Latin for &quot;lower hill&quot;) is the principal midbrain nucleus of the auditory pathway and receives input from several peripheral brainstem nuclei in the auditory pathway, as well as inputs from the auditory cortex. The inferior colliculus has three subdivisions: the central nucleus, a dorsal cortex by which it is surrounded, and an external cortex which is located laterally. Its bimodal neurons are implicated in auditory-somatosensory interaction, receiving projections from somatosensory nuclei. This multisensory integration may underlie a filtering of self-effected sounds from vocalization, chewing, or respiration activities. 

The inferior colliculi together with the superior colliculi form the eminences of the corpora quadrigemina, and also part of the midbrain tectum. The inferior colliculus lies caudal to its counterpart - the superior colliculus - above the trochlear nerve, and at the base of the projection of the medial geniculate nucleus and the lateral geniculate nucleus.

== Relationship to auditory system ==
The inferior colliculi of the midbrain are located just below the visual processing centers known as the superior colliculi. The inferior colliculus has three subdivisions – the central nucleus, the dorsal cortex by which it is surrounded, and an external cortex which is located laterally. The inferior colliculus is the first place where vertically orienting data from the fusiform cells in the dorsal cochlear nucleus can finally synapse with horizontally orienting data. Sound location data thus becomes fully integrated by the inferior colliculus.

IC are large auditory nuclei on the right and left sides of the midbrain. Of the three subdivisions the central nucleus of IC (CNIC) is the principal way station for ascending auditory information in the IC.

=== Input and output connections === 
The input connections to the inferior colliculus are composed of many brainstem nuclei. All nuclei except the contralateral ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus send projections to the central nucleus (CNIC) bilaterally. It has been shown that great majority of auditory fibers ascending in the lateral lemniscus terminate in the CNIC. In addition, the IC receives inputs from the auditory cortex, the medial division of the medial geniculate body, the posterior limitans, suprapeduncular nucleus and subparafascicular intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus, the substantia nigra pars compacta lateralis, the dorsolateral periaqueductal gray, the nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus (or inferior brachium) and deep layers of the superior colliculus. The inferior brachium carries auditory afferent fibers from the inferior colliculus of the mesencephalon to the medial geniculate nucleus.

The inferior colliculus receives input from both the ipsilateral and contralateral cochlear nucleus and respectively the corresponding ears. There is some lateralization, the dorsal projections (containing vertical data) only project to the contralateral inferior colliculus. This inferior colliculus contralateral to the ear it is receiving the most information from, then projects to its ipsilateral medial geniculate nucleus.

The inferior colliculus also receives descending inputs from the auditory cortex and auditory thalamus (or medial geniculate nucleus).

The medial geniculate body (MGB) is the output connection from inferior colliculus and the last subcortical way station. The MGB is composed of ventral, dorsal, and medial divisions, which are relatively similar in humans and other mammals. The ventral division receives auditory signals from the central nucleus of the IC.

=== Function ===
The majority of the ascending fibers from the lateral lemniscus project to IC, which means major ascending auditory pathways converge here. IC appears as an integrative station and switchboard as well. It is involved in the integration and routing of multi-modal sensory perception, mainly the startle response and vestibulo-ocular reflex. It is also responsive to specific amplitude modulation frequencies and this might be responsible for detection of pitch. In addition, spatial localization by binaural hearing is a related function of IC as well.

The inferior colliculus has a relatively high metabolism in the brain. The Conrad Simon Memorial Research Initiative measured the blood flow of the IC and put a number at 1.80 cc/g/min in the cat brain. For reference, the runner up in the included measurements was the somatosensory cortex at 1.53. This indicates that the inferior colliculus is metabolically more active than many other parts of the brain. The hippocampus, normally considered to use up a disproportionate amount of energy, was not measured or compared.

Skottun &quot;et al.&quot; measured the interaural time difference sensitivity of single neurons in the inferior colliculus, and used these to predict behavioural performance. The predicted just noticeable difference was comparable to that achieved by humans in behavioral tests. This suggested that by the level of the inferior colliculus, integration of information over multiple neurons is unnecessary (see population code).

Axiomatically determined functional models of spectro-temporal receptive fields in inferior colliculus have been determined by Lindeberg and Friberg in terms of derivatives of Gaussian functions over the log-spectral domain and either Gaussian kernels over time in the case of non-causal time or first-order integrators (truncated exponential kernels) coupled in cascade in the case of truly time-causal operations, optionally in combination with local glissando transformations to account for variations in frequencies over time.
The shapes of the receptive field functions in these models can be determined by necessity from structural properties of the environment combined with requirements about the internal structure of the auditory system to enable theoretically well-founded processing of sound signals at different temporal and log-spectral scales. Thereby, the receptive fields in inferior colliculus can be seen as well adapted to handling natural sound transformations.

<doc id="1085364" wikidata="Q7764931" url="?curid=1085364" title="The Smoke Ring (novel)">
<text>The Smoke Ring is a 1987 science fiction novel by Larry Niven. Like much of Niven&#x27;s work, the story is heavily influenced by the setting: a gas torus, a ring of air around a neutron star. It is a sequel to &quot;The Integral Trees&quot;.

==Setting==
The story is set at the fictional neutron star Levoy&#x27;s Star (abbreviated &quot;Voy&quot;). The gas giant Goldblatt&#x27;s World (abbreviated &quot;Gold&quot;) orbits the star just outside its Roche limit. While Gold&#x27;s gravity is enough to keep it from being pulled apart by Voy&#x27;s tidal forces, it is insufficient to hold its atmosphere, which has been pulled loose into an independent orbit around Voy. This orbiting air forms a ring known as a gas torus. The gas torus is huge—one million kilometers thick—but most of it is too thin to be habitable. The central part of the Gas Torus, where the air is thicker, is known as the Smoke Ring. The Smoke Ring supports a wide variety of life. Robert L. Forward helped Niven calculate the parameters of the ring.

There is no &quot;ground&quot; in the Smoke Ring; it is a world consisting entirely of sky. Thus, most animals can fly, even the fish. Furthermore, since the Smoke Ring is in orbit, it is in free fall. There is no &quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;, only &quot;in&quot; or &quot;out&quot; from Voy. Humans moving in the Smoke Ring use a poetic adage to aid their understanding of orbital mechanics: &quot;East takes you Out, Out takes you West, West takes you In, In takes you East. Port and Starboard bring you back&quot;. (In the novel, the characters also say: &quot;North and South bring you back&quot;.)
Most animals have trilateral symmetry, allowing them to see in all directions. Most plants in the Smoke Ring are quite fragile, as they do not have to support their own weight. A notable exception to this rule are the Integral Trees. These are trees that are up to 100 kilometers long. Tidal locking causes them to be oriented radially, with one end pointing in toward Voy and one end pointing out. The ends of the tree experience a tidal force of up to &quot;g&quot;. Each end consists of a leafy &quot;tuft&quot;, which is where photosynthesis occurs.

Each tuft of a tree is 50 kilometers from the tree&#x27;s center of mass. Thus, a tuft is either orbiting too slowly (the in tuft) or too quickly (the out tuft). Since the atmosphere at either end is moving at its local orbital speed, the ends of trees are subject to a constant hurricane-force wind. This wind bends the ends into the shape of an integral symbol: ∫.

The Smoke Ring was colonized 500 years prior to the beginning of the story by a crew of 20 astronauts. Their descendants have adapted to the free-fall environment by growing taller and developing prehensile toes.

According to &quot;N-Space&quot;, the wings and the method of self-propelled flying featured in the novel were suggested by Isaac Asimov.

==Plot summary==

This book takes place about fifteen years after the end of the original story, when survivors of the Dalton-Quinn tree, a few Carther States jungle dwellers, and two London Tree Citizens have settled on a new tree. This &#x27;Citizen&#x27;s Tree&#x27; has become a stable community which some believe may be too small to survive in the long run.

Kendy, the recorded personality of a citizen of &quot;The State&quot; who exists in the computer of the original space-ship that colonized the Smoke Ring, has become impatient. He decides to re-establish contact with Citizen&#x27;s Tree. Kendy manipulates a group into making contact with &quot;The Admiralty&quot;, a neighboring civilization at Gold&#x27;s L4 Lagrange Point (which they refer to as &quot;the Clump&quot;). The group explores this more advanced civilization with a mixture of wonder and trepidation.

Although much of the story is a sort of &quot;travelogue&quot; exploring the Smoke Ring and the technology used in the unique environment, &quot;The Smoke Ring&quot; does spend more time on story and character development than &quot;The Integral Trees&quot;. One of the drivers for the story follows the latest operator of &quot;the silver suit&quot;, the Citizen&#x27;s Tree&#x27;s working spacesuit. Few are capable of operating the suit due to its size; due to the lack of gravity, most humans in the Smoke Ring grow too tall to fit into it. The job goes to the occasionally born &quot;dwarves&quot; who tend to develop into humans of Earth-normal height and build. A major sub-plot develops around the latest silver suit operator&#x27;s attempts to infiltrate The Admiralty to gain information, and The Admiralty&#x27;s near obsession with capturing the Citizen&#x27;s Tree&#x27;s spacesuit.

This focuses on the story of Kendy and the original mission. The chain of events that led to the colonization of the Smoke Ring through a &quot;mutiny&quot; on the ship is explored. After retrieving the crew&#x27;s own records of the events, Kendy realizes that the crew had not mutinied at all, and that he had forced them off the ship, believing this to be in keeping with his orders from Earth. This was apparently blocked from his memory, and he suffers a form of breakdown when he learns (or re-learns) the truth.

==Literary significance and reception==
The Magill Book Reviews said in 1990 that &quot;the societies and science in the book are very well-researched. It is, however, a &quot;hard&quot; science fiction novel, and it has the weakness endemic to that genre – the individual characters are never satisfyingly drawn, so that the reader is somewhat distanced from them.&quot;

The Library Journal said in 1987 that &quot;the alien topography of this sequel to &quot;The Integral Trees&quot; serves as a fascinating contrast to the persistence of humanity&#x27;s adventuring spirit&quot;.

J. Michael Caparula reviewed &quot;The Smoke Ring&quot; in &quot;Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer&quot; No. 81. Caparula commented that &quot;The setting is, naturally, spectacular, but a lot of the freshness has worn off. &quot;Ringworld&quot; merited a sequel, &quot;The Integral Trees&quot; did not.&quot;

<doc id="1085365" wikidata="Q4749712" url="?curid=1085365" title="Bill 99">
<text>Bill 99 (R.S.Q., c. E-20.2) is a Quebec law concerning the consequences of any future referendum on independence; it was enacted in 2000 in response to the enactment of the federal &quot;Clarity Act&quot; by the Parliament of Canada. The full official title of the law is &quot;An Act respecting the exercise of the fundamental rights and prerogatives of the Québec people and the Québec State&quot; (). It has no formal short title and so is commonly referred to as &quot;Bill 99&quot;, the designation under which it was introduced in the Quebec legislature by the Parti Québécois.

==History==
The bill was introduced by Joseph Facal to the National Assembly of Quebec in an emergency session on 15 December 1999, two days after the introduction of the &quot;Clarity Act&quot; in the House of Commons of Canada. It was adopted on 7 December 2000, by a vote of 69 to 41. The bill was opposed by Liberal leader Jean Charest, who preferred the National Assembly pass a motion rather than a law.

Whereas the federal act states that, in the case of a referendum about the secession of a Canadian province, the House of Commons has the power to determine afterwards whether the question was clear enough and whether the obtained majority was large enough for the result to be accepted, the provincial act stipulates that Quebecers may determine unilaterally how to exercise their right to choose their political regime, including sovereignty, and that the winning option in a referendum is whichever obtains 50% of the votes plus one. Both acts are mandates given to their respective governments.

While opposed to Bill 99, the opposition Liberal Party tabled a motion agreeing with many of its central provisions, including the right of Quebec to decide any referendum question and the 50%-plus-one rule.

The motivation for Bill 99 was to ensure that, even in the absence a referendum, Quebec&#x27;s political fate would result only from decisions made by Quebecers and not by other Canadians. The constitutional validity of both the &quot;Clarity Act&quot; and Bill 99 has been questioned, however, with respect to the &quot;Constitution Act 1867&quot; allocation of legislative powers between the federal and provincial government.

In August 2007, three justices of the Quebec Court of Appeal unanimously held that Keith Henderson, former leader of the Equality Party, an English-language rights group, had standing to challenge the legality of the statute, which the Quebec Superior Court dubbed &quot;Bill 99&quot; in the absence of a short title for it. In 2018, the Quebec Superior Court ruled that Bill 99 was constitutional, as its wording did not actually authorize a unilateral declaration of independence.

<text>A Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist (CRNA) is a type of advanced practice nurse who administers anesthesia in the United States. CRNAs account for approximately half of the anesthesia providers in the United States and are the main providers (80%) of anesthesia in rural America. Historically, nurses have been providing anesthesia care to patients for over 160 years, dating back to the American Civil War (1861–1865). The CRNA credential was formally established in 1956. CRNA schools issue a Doctorate of nursing anesthesia degree to nurses who have completed a program in anesthesia, which is 3 years in length.

Scope of practice and practitioner oversight requirements vary between healthcare facility and state, with 25 states and Guam granting complete autonomy as of 2024. In states that have opted out of supervision, the Joint Commission and CMS recognize CRNAs as licensed independent practitioners. In states requiring supervision, CRNAs have liability separate from supervising practitioners and are able to administer anesthesia independently of physicians, such as Anesthesiologists.

==History==
===American Civil War and the 19th Century===
Among the first American nurses to provide anesthetics was Catherine S. Lawrence during the American Civil War. It was during the Second Battle of Bull Run in 1863 that she administered chloroform to wounded soldiers who needed emergency operations in the battlefield. Nevertheless, it still took several years for nurses to step forward and formally answer the call to provide anesthesia. Reasons for this delay included lack of training, the non-emergency nature of civilian surgical practice after the war was over, and the paucity of role models and sponsors. However, the wartime concept of nurses providing anesthesia care gradually took root as surgeons trained and encouraged nurses to take on this important role.

Catholic nuns played an important role in the training of nurses and also in anesthesia. The earliest recorded nurse to specialize in anesthesia was Sister Mary Bernard Sheridan, a Catholic nun who practiced in 1877 at St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital in Erie, Pennsylvania. Her influence spread throughout the Midwest, and many other Catholic nuns who were also nurses began training to administer anesthesia. Nuns of the Third Order of the Hospital Sisters of St Francis from Münster established a community in Springfield, Illinois, and on June 22, 1879, they founded St John&#x27;s Hospital. At St John&#x27;s, the administration of chloroform and ether was taught to the nurses by surgeons, and many of the Franciscan Sisters were assigned as anesthetists throughout the Midwest. Nurse anesthesia became “undoubtedly a prevailing practice in many Catholic hospitals”.

In 1883, Minnesota was devastated by a tornado. Mother Alfred Moes and the Sisters of Saint Francis proposed building a hospital to aid the sick and injured in Southern Minnesota. However, they stipulated that William Worrall Mayo (1819-1911) and his sons work at the hospital. The Mayos agreed, and in 1889, St Mary&#x27;s Hospital opened with 27 beds. Although Catholic nuns seemed to be the most influential force in teaching nurses to administer anesthesia in the late 1800s, it was William W. Mayo who should be credited for promoting the popularity of nurse anesthesia practice. Mayo and his sons William J. Mayo and Charles H. Mayo were well known for their surgical skills. Surgeons traveled from across the country to their clinic in Minnesota to observe operations and learn their surgical techniques. However, the visiting surgeons also took note of the nurses administering anesthesia at the head of the operating table.

One of the most well-known nurse anesthesia pioneers was Alice Magaw, who came to St Mary&#x27;s Hospital in Rochester, Minnesota, in 1893. She was trained by the Graham sisters, Edith and Dinah, and began working as a nurse anesthetist for Charles H. Mayo, who bestowed on her the title of “Mother of Anesthesia” due to her natural aptitude and mastery of safe administration of open-drop ether. In addition to being skilled at anesthesia administration, Magaw documented and evaluated all her anesthesia procedures, culminating with a landmark article in nurse-anesthesia history. An even larger work (A Review of Over Fourteen Thousand Surgical Anesthesias) was published in 1906, reporting huge number of open-drop ether anesthetics, incredibly without a single fatality. Magaw&#x27;s work highlighted the benefits of the trained anesthetist, allowing great advances in the practice of medicine. As the reputation and success of the Mayo Clinic spread, so did the renown of the Mayo Clinic nurse anesthetists.

The sustainability and historical longevity of the practice of nurse anesthesia can be attributed to excellent working relationships between nurse anesthetists and surgeons in these early years of the practice. Impressed by the provision of superior anesthesia by nurses at St Mary&#x27;s, and following the example of the Mayo Clinic, prominent Cleveland surgeon George Washington Crile recruited Agatha Cobourg Hodgins as his personal anesthetist in 1908.

=== 20th Century and initial challenges ===

Several notable nurse anesthetist from the early 20th century are revered by their modern counterparts. Agnes McGee taught at the Oregon Health Science Center. Alice Hunt was appointed instructor in anesthesia with university rank at the Yale University School of Medicine beginning in 1922 and continuing for 26 years. She authored the 1949 book &quot;Anesthesia, Principles and Practice,&quot; likely the first nurse anesthesia textbook.
The first challenge to the nurse&#x27;s right to administer anesthesia came in 1911 from Francis Hoeffer McMechan, a native Cincinnati physician, who felt that the field of anesthesia should belong solely to physicians. McMechen challenged the practice of nurse anesthesia with the Ohio Medical Board, which along with Ohio State Attorney General ruled in 1916 that only a registered physician could administer anesthesia. Surgeons at the Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland, such as Crile, initially obeyed the ruling; however, in 1917, Crile and his supporters successfully lobbied the Ohio legislature to create an exemption within the Medical Practice Act for nurses who were educated appropriately to administer anesthesia under the supervision of a physician.

Perhaps the most noteworthy challenge occurred in 1934, when nurse anesthetist Dagmar Nelson was charged by an anesthesiologist, William VaneChalmer-Francis, with practicing medicine and violating California Medical Practice by administering anesthesia without a license. The case went all the way to the California Supreme court, but Nelson was given a favorable ruling at each level of the case. The Dagmar Nelson case was won via precedents set by early nurse anesthetists. The California Supreme Court reasoned that Nelson&#x27;s practice of anesthesia was in “accordance with the uniform practice in operating rooms” not only in Los Angeles but also throughout the country including the Mayo Clinic, where Nelson had trained and “where...one hundred thousand surgical operations had been performed” with anesthetic administered by nurses.

Despite the rapid growth of the nurse anesthetist profession following the Great War, World War II again precipitated a shortage of anesthetists. A recruitment campaign was begun, but this was quickly followed by concern about the emergence of “ill advised and unjustified schools”. Helen Lamb in turn stressed the importance of maintaining educational standards even in times of shortages. By the end of WWII, the military had trained more than 2000 nurses to provide anesthesia using a program patterned by the NANA. The quality of nurse anesthesia education was again upgraded following WWII, and although university affiliation was advised, most programs were still hospital based. In 1933, the NANA established an Education Committee to develop educational standards, and by 1952, formal accreditation standards were in place.

===Legal cases===
Under US law, &quot;Frank v. South&quot;, &quot;Chalmers-Francis v. Nelson&quot; and other court decisions established that anesthesia was the practice of nursing as well as medicine. As such, the practice of anesthesia in the US may be delivered by either a nurse anesthetist or an anesthesiologist. The decisions have not been challenged since the Dagmar Nelson case. In addition to legal decisions, individual hospital and surgical facility policies also regulate the granting of anesthesia clinical privileges and are often based on contractual agreements with provider groups.

==Education==
===History===

The first school of nurse anesthesia was formed in 1909 at St. Vincent Hospital, Portland, Oregon. Established by Agnes McGee, the course was seven months long, and included courses on anatomy and physiology, pharmacology, and administration of the few common anesthetic agents available at the time. Within the next decade, approximately 19 schools opened. All consisted of post-graduate anesthesia training for nurses and were about six months in length. These included programs at Mayo Clinic, Johns Hopkins Hospital, Barnes Hospital, New York Post-Graduate Hospital, Charity Hospital in New Orleans, Grace Hospital in Detroit, among others. During those early days of administering anesthetics, knowledge and available anesthetic options were extremely limited and programs provided what little education they could for all levels of health providers. For example, in 1915, chief nurse anesthetist Agatha Hodgins established the Lakeside Hospital School of Anesthesia in Cleveland, Ohio. This program was open to nurses, physicians, and dentists. The training was only six months and the tuition was $50. In its first year, it graduated six physicians, eleven nurses, and two dentists.

Among the oldest schools in the U.S., Ravenswood Hospital in Chicago, opened in 1925 by Mae Cameron, which in 2001 became the NorthShore University HealthSystem School of Nurse Anesthesia, was the first school to be accredited by the Council on Accreditation of Nurse Anesthesia Educational Programs in 1952.

In 1981, the Nursing Council on Accreditation developed guidelines for master&#x27;s degrees. In 1982, it was the official position of the AANA board of directors that registered nurses applying for a school of anesthesia shall be, at minimum, baccalaureate prepared and then complete a master&#x27;s level anesthesia program. As early as 1978, the Kaiser Permanente California State University program had evolved to a master&#x27;s level program. All programs were required to transition to a master&#x27;s degree beginning in 1990 and complete the process by 1998. Currently, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing has endorsed a position statement that will move the current entry level of training and education of nurse anesthetists in the United States to the Doctor of Nursing Practice (DNP) or Doctor of Nurse Anesthesia Practice (DNAP). This move will affect all advance practice nurses, with a mandatory implementation by the year 2015. In August 2007, the AANA announced its support of this advanced clinical degree as an entry level for practice of all nurse anesthetists, with a target compliance date of 2025. In accordance with traditional grandfathering rules, all those in current practice would not be affected and neither would the training provided to those now receiving the DNP or DNAP designation. Currently, more than 50% of the 120 nurse anesthesia programs have already transitioned to the DNP or DNAP entry level format.

===Requirements===
The didactic curricula of nurse-anesthesia programs is governed by the COA standards. Accredited programs provide supervised experiences for students with patients of all ages who require medical, surgical, obstetrical, dental, and pediatric interventions. Programs require study in methods of scientific inquiry and statistics, as well as active participation in a student-generated and faculty-sponsored research project.

Before becoming a nurse anesthetist, one must complete a few years of a bachelor&#x27;s-level registered nursing. A minimum of one year of full-time work experience as a registered nurse in a critical care setting is required before applying to CRNA school. The average experience of RNs entering nurse anesthesia educational programs is 2.9 years. Nurse anesthetists are required to attend accredited educations programs covering all areas of anesthesia. This education provides training about the anesthetics needed for patients in any type of procedure or surgery. After completing an accredited program, CRNAs must pass a national certification exam to acquire this designation. It is important to have the best education for this field for the significance of anesthesia. By 2025 the Council on Accreditation, the organization which accredits nurse anesthetist programs, will require all graduating CRNAs to be doctorate prepared.

==Armed forces==

Nurse anesthetists serve in the United States armed forces. In some military treatment facilities, nurse anesthetists function as the only licensed independent anesthesia practitioners, including U.S. Navy ships at sea. They also provide anesthesia for the Veterans Administration and Public Health Service medical facilities.

During World War I, America&#x27;s nurse anesthetists cared for troops in France. From 1914 to 1915, three years prior to America entering the war, Dr. George Crile and nurse anesthetists Agatha Hodgins and Mabel Littleton served in the Lakeside Unit at the American Ambulance at Neuilly-sur-Seine in France. In addition, they helped train the French and British nurses and physicians in anesthesia care. In 1917, the American participation in the war resulted in the U.S. military training nurse anesthetists for service. The Army and Navy sent nurses anesthesia trainees to various hospitals, including the Mayo Clinic at Rochester and the Lakeside Hospital in Cleveland before overseas service.

Among notable nurse anesthetists are Sophie Gran Winton. She served with the Red Cross at an army hospital in Château-Thierry, France, and earned the French Croix de Guerre in addition to other service awards. In addition, Anne Penland was the first nurse anesthetist to serve on the British Front and was decorated by the British government.

American nurse anesthetists also served in World War II and Korea. Second Lieutenant Mildred Irene Clark provided anesthesia for casualties from the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. During the Vietnam War, nurse anesthetists served as both CRNAs and flight nurses, and also developed new field equipment. Nurse anesthetists have been casualties of war. Lieutenants Kenneth R. Shoemaker Jr. and Jerome E. Olmsted, were killed in an air evac mission en route to Qui Nhon, Vietnam.

At least one nurse anesthetist was a prisoner of war. Army Nurse anesthetist Annie Mealer endured a three-year imprisonment by the Japanese in the Philippines, and was released in 1945. During the Iraq War, nurse anesthetists provide care at forward positioned medical treatment facilities. In addition, they play a role in the continuing education and training of Department of Defense nurses and technicians in the care of wartime trauma patients.

==Certification==
Board certification and recertification process is governed by the National Board on Certification and Recertification of Nurse Anesthetists (NBCRNA). The NBCRNA exists as an autonomous not-for-profit incorporated organization. CRNAs also have continuing education requirements and recertification check-ins every two years thereafter, plus any additional requirements of the state in which they practice. The new recertification pathway focuses on: maintenance of certification, lifelong learning, and continued competence. The Continued Professional Certification (CPC) Program consists of 8-year periods, and each period comprises two four-year cycles.

==Scope of practice==
The degree of independence or supervision by a licensed provider (physician, dentist, or podiatrist) varies with state law. Some states use the term collaboration to define a relationship where the supervising physician and the CRNA work together to provide the anesthetic. Other states require the consent or order of a physician or other qualified licensed provider to administer the anesthetic.

The licensed CRNA is legally authorized to deliver care under the particular Nurse Practice Act of each state. Scope of CRNA practice is commonly further defined by the practice location&#x27;s clinical privilege and credentialing process, anesthesia department policies, or practitioner agreements. Clinical privileges are based on the scope and complexity of the expected clinical practice, CRNA qualifications, and CRNA experience. This allows the CRNA to provide core services and activities under defined conditions with or without supervision.

In 2001, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) published a rule in the &quot;Federal Register&quot; that allows a state to be exempt from Medicare&#x27;s physician supervision requirement for nurse anesthetists after appropriate approval by the state. To date, 22 states and Guam have opted out of the federal requirement, instituting their own individual requirements instead.

== Salary ==
According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, a CRNA salary is around $225,555. Salaries within the US vary by state. Connecticut is the highest-paying state for CRNAs at an average salary of $276,540. It is followed by New Jersey ($263,850), Illinois ($250,280), and West Virginia ($247,650). Overall employment for nurse anesthetists and other medical professions is projected to grow 45 percent from 2020 to 2030.

== Duties ==
CRNAs typically work in healthcare settings such as emergency rooms, intensive care units, and operating rooms. Their environment is with medical and surgical teams with procedures that can occur anytime. Some partnerships they work with are dentists, surgeons, podiatrists and other healthcare providers in serving patients who need of receiving anesthesia. Nurse anesthetists are an essential part of everyday medical facilities. The need of CRNAs is anticipated to grow.

=== Skills and procedures ===
Nurse anesthetists practice independently (depending on the state law) or they practice in collaboration with anesthesiologists, surgeons, and doctors to supply anesthetics to patients. CRNAs are responsible for communicating with the surgeon or team about the patient&#x27;s health history and designing a plan for anesthesia. The procedures that nurse anesthetists offer include:
*Evaluation of the patient prior to anesthesia
*Physical assessment and teaching before the anesthesia
*Administering patients&#x27; anesthesia
*Administering regional anesthesia/analgesia such as spinals and epidurals
*Placing ultrasound guided blocks for surgery
*Managing patients in the post-operative period
*Manage the recovery from the anesthesia

=== Roles and responsibilities ===
CRNAs have important roles when it comes to patient care. They need to meet all patient standards and help ensure the patient is in good condition before receiving an anesthesia plan. Some of the skills a CRNA requires include: 
*Bedside manner 
*Record-keeping skills 
*Communication skills 
*Teamwork with other nurses and physicians
*Inhaled anesthesia administration 
*Ultrasound guided nerve blocks
*Point of care ultrasound
*Administration of blood and medication 
*Epidural placement 
*Placement of arterial and central lines 
Subsequent to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increase in the number of individuals who need respiratory assistance.

== Terminology ==
The AANA recognizes &quot;Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetist&quot;, &quot;CRNA&quot;, &quot;nurse anesthetist&quot;, and &quot;nurse anesthesiologist&quot; as equivalent titles. The use of &quot;nurse anesthetist&quot; is substantially more common than the use of &quot;nurse anesthesiologist;&quot; terms &quot;anesthesia nurse&quot; and &quot;anesthetist nurse&quot; are unheard of.

Use of the term &quot;nurse anesthesiologist&quot; has been criticized by those who argue that the term &quot;anesthesiologist&quot; should be limited to medical doctors. For example, groups representing anesthesiologists and other medical doctors, such as the American Medical Association (AMA) and American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), oppose the use of this phrase to describe CRNAs and call it misleading.

In 2021, after a year-long rebranding effort, the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists changed its name to the American Association of Nurse Anesthesiology. The name change was condemned by physician groups, including the AMA, ASA, American Board of Anesthesiology, American Board of Medical Specialties, and American Osteopathic Association. Physicians&#x27; organizations said that the name change was &quot;title misappropriation&quot; that was deceptive, misleading to patients, and cause confusion in care settings.

<text>Julio César Franco Robles (born August 23, 1958) is a Dominican former professional baseball infielder and coach. He spent most of his playing career in Major League Baseball (MLB), entering the major leagues in and last appearing in , at which time he was the oldest active big league player. During that stretch, Franco also spent two seasons playing in Nippon Professional Baseball (NPB) and one season playing in the KBO.

While Franco was an All-Star and posted above-average hitting statistics throughout his career, he is best known for being the oldest regular position player in MLB history. Franco was the all-time hits leader among Dominican-born players until surpassed in 2011 by Vladimir Guerrero. He made his MLB debut as a shortstop for the Philadelphia Phillies. During his long career, Franco saw significant time as a shortstop, second baseman, first baseman, and designated hitter. At the time of his final game, he was the last MLB player born in the 1950s.

==Early life==
Franco was born in Hato Mayor in the Dominican Republic. As a child, he lived in Consuelo, San Pedro de Macorís, a poor municipality 50 miles east of Santo Domingo. He attended Divine Providence School in Consuelo.

==Career==
===Minor league career===
Signed by the Philadelphia Phillies organization on April 23, 1978, as an amateur free agent, Franco reported to the Rookie-level Butte Copper Kings. In each of five minor league seasons, he hit for a batting average of at least .300. Franco was promoted through the Philadelphia minor league system each year, reaching the Class AAA Oklahoma City 89ers in 1982 and batting .300 and hitting 21 home runs in 120 games.

===Early MLB career===
Franco debuted in the major leagues in 1982, playing 16 games with the Phillies. He was one of five Phillies along with Manny Trillo, George Vukovich, Jerry Willard and Jay Baller who were traded to the Cleveland Indians for Von Hayes at the Winter Meetings on December 9, 1982.

1983 was Franco&#x27;s first full season in the majors. In 149 games, he batted .273 with 153 hits. He finished second in AL Rookie of the Year voting, trailing only Ron Kittle.

In June 1986, Franco received a two-game suspension from the Indians after he arrived at the ballpark but then left before the game started. Indians manager Pat Corrales said that Franco left due to a personal problem, but he said that Franco had left without permission and that he had already been given a warning after missing a game in 1985.

Franco hit over .300 in every season from 1986 to 1989. He also averaged over 20 stolen bases per season from 1983 through 1991. When he switched from shortstop to second base in 1988, he won four straight Silver Slugger Awards. Franco batted with a long whip-like swing with the heaviest bat allowed. Because of his batting style, Franco twice led the American League in grounding into double plays and was in the top-ten in that category seven times in the 1980s. He is seventh on the all-time list in ground-ball double plays and has just over 300.

In December 1988, during baseball&#x27;s Winter Meetings, Franco was traded from Cleveland to the Texas Rangers, who were in need of an everyday second baseman. The Rangers gave up first baseman Pete O&#x27;Brien, and two prospects, Oddibe McDowell and Jerry Browne. The Rangers had acquired first baseman Rafael Palmeiro the day before, and &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the Rangers&#x27; lineup might allow Franco to bat fifth, a batting order slot that could increase his number of runs batted in (RBI).

With Texas, Franco was named to all three of his All-Star teams: in 1989, 1990 and 1991, and he won the Major League Baseball All-Star Game MVP Award in 1990. In the 1990 All-Star game, Franco came to bat in the 7th inning against Rob Dibble of the Cincinnati Reds. Franco drove a 101 mph fastball to the right-center field fence for a double, scoring the only runs of the game.

In 1991, Franco had his only 200-hit season and won the American League batting title. His .341 average was nine points higher than that of future Baseball Hall of Fame member Wade Boggs. A 1992 knee injury limited him to 33 games that season and fundamentally ended Franco&#x27;s time as a middle infielder, playing only 35 more games at 2B the remainder of his career. Franco later said that the injury helped him to realize the importance of taking care of his physical condition. He spent 1993 as a designated hitter before opting to become a free agent and signing with the Chicago White Sox.

===Strike and baseball abroad===
In 1994, as a member of the Chicago White Sox, Franco had already hit 20 home runs for the only time in his career and was on pace to reach 100 runs batted in for the only time in his career when the remainder of the season was canceled by the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike. Franco went on to win his fifth Silver Slugger Award and first as a Designated hitter. On December 28, 1994, Franco signed to play in Japan with the Chiba Lotte Marines in the Pacific League. Chiba Lotte had the best season in its history in 1995, and Franco won the Japanese equivalent of the Gold Glove Award as a first baseman.

After the 1995 season in Japan, Franco signed with the Cleveland Indians, where he was a fan favorite. In 1996, he batted .322 with 76 RBIs even in an injury-shortened season, and played in his first postseason. Early in the 1997 season, Franco hit a hard line drive back to the pitcher&#x27;s mound which struck Detroit Tigers pitcher Willie Blair; the pitcher missed four weeks of the season with a broken jaw. In August 1997, the Indians released Franco. He quickly signed with the Milwaukee Brewers.

In 1998, Franco was back in Japan playing for Chiba Lotte. The following year, he returned to North America, in the Mexican League with a .423 average in 93 games (and also a strikeout in his only MLB at bat with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays). In 2000, Franco was back in Asia but, this time, in South Korea to play for the Samsung Lions. He returned again to the Mexican League in 2001.

===Return to the majors===

In September 2001, Franco was a 43-year-old who had just one major league at bat in the previous three seasons. Despite his lengthy absence, the Atlanta Braves, after seeing his success in the Mexican League, purchased his contract from the Angelopolis (Mexico City) Tigers. Franco played well defensively as a first baseman and was a good hitter against left-handed pitchers. The Braves re-signed him after that season and each of the next three.

Franco was talking in the weight room in August 2003 with Jason Marquis, when he leaned on a stand and an 80-pound weight rolled over his finger, breaking it. &quot;When the weight started to roll,&quot; Franco said, &quot;I said, &#x27;Uh-oh.&#x27;&quot;

In 2004, Franco passed Cap Anson as the oldest regularly playing position player in MLB history. (A few regularly playing pitchers, including knuckleballers Phil Niekro and Hoyt Wilhelm, were older than Franco, and Leroy “Satchel” Paige was reportedly 57, and a few non-pitchers, like Minnie Miñoso and Jim O&#x27;Rourke, appeared as publicity stunts at old ages but did not play regularly.)

On December 8, 2005, at age 47, Franco signed a two-year contract with the Mets.

Franco had been the oldest player in the major leagues from 2004 to 2007, and was the last active player who was born in the 1950s. On April 20, 2006, pinch-hitting with one out in the eighth inning against the San Diego Padres, Franco hit a go-ahead two-run home run, becoming the oldest player in Major League history to hit a home run. Franco hit a three-run homer on September 30, 2006, in Washington to extend his own record. It was one of three hits in the game for Franco, who fell a triple short of hitting for the cycle. Franco yet again bested himself on May 4, 2007, when he homered into the swimming pool at Chase Field against Arizona Diamondbacks lefty Randy Johnson — a game in which he also stole a base.

Franco was also the oldest player ever to hit a grand slam, a pinch-hit home run, two home runs in one game, and to steal two bases in a game. On April 26, 2006, Franco became the second-oldest man in MLB history to steal a base, behind only Arlie Latham, who accomplished the feat in a token appearance at age 49 with the New York Giants in 1909. On July 29, 2006, against the Atlanta Braves, Franco became the oldest player ever to pinch run, when he came in for Carlos Delgado after Delgado was hit by pitch. On September 19, 2006, a day after the Mets clinched the division title, Franco started at third base in a game against the Florida Marlins. This was Franco&#x27;s first start at the position since his rookie year, marking 24 years between starts at the position.

Franco struggled with the Mets in 2007, achieving just a .200 batting average (in only 50 at-bats in half a season). Franco grew unhappy with insufficient playing time before being designated for assignment on July 12. He subsequently re-signed with the Atlanta Braves on July 18 and was placed on the team&#x27;s active roster. In his first game since re-signing with the Braves, he went 1-for-3 with two RBIs and received two standing ovations in a Braves 10–1 rout of the Cardinals. On August 1, just 13 days after the Braves signed him, the Braves designated Franco for assignment after the team acquired Mark Teixeira from the Texas Rangers. He accepted a minor league assignment on August 8 and was called back up as promised on September 1.

Franco declared free agency on October 29, 2007. Franco began the 2008 season — his 31st in professional baseball — as a first baseman for the Tigres de Quintana Roo (Cancún) in the Mexican League.

===After the Mexican League===
On May 2, 2008, Franco officially announced his retirement from baseball to his Mexican League team, the Quintana Roo Tigers. An official announcement was released the next day. Franco said that retiring was the hardest decision he had ever made, but he pointed to his decreasing production as a player and said that he felt like it was time to retire.

Franco was hired in March 2009 as the manager of the rookie-level Gulf Coast League Mets. In Franco&#x27;s only season managing the team, they posted a record of 22 wins and 34 losses. In 2010–2011, Franco managed a winter league team, the Caribes de Anzoátegui, in the Venezuelan Professional Baseball League. He led the team to its first league championship in 20 years. He returned to the team the following season, but he was fired after the team started with a 28–28 win–loss record. Soon thereafter, Franco was hired as the manager of the Pericos de Puebla for the 2012 Mexican League season. In two seasons with Puebla, he led the team to 110 wins and 104 losses.

Franco appeared on the Baseball Hall of Fame ballot in 2013. Paul White of &quot;USA Today&quot; wrote that while Franco was a consistent player over a long career, he was rarely dominant. White wrote that Franco&#x27;s statistics were inferior to other Baseball Hall of Fame second basemen. Franco received six Hall of Fame votes (1.1% of the total ballots), an insufficient total to appear on the next year&#x27;s ballot.

===Return to baseball===
On May 16, 2014, the Fort Worth Cats of United League Baseball announced that Franco had been signed for the 2014 season. He went 6-for-27 in seven games.

On February 8, 2015, Ishikawa Million Stars of the professional Japanese Independent baseball league Baseball Challenge League announced that Franco had been signed as a player-manager for the 2015 season. Franco said that he did not think he would appear often as a player, but 14 games into the season, Franco had played in ten games owing to an injury to a key player.

===Second coaching stint===
Franco was part of the coaching staff for the Lotte Giants of the KBO League from 2016–2020.

On February 5, 2022, Franco returned to the Mexican League as he was named hitting coach of the Acereros de Monclova.

==Career statistics==
In 2,527 games over 23 major league seasons, Franco posted a .298 batting average (2,586-for-8,677) with 1,285 runs, 407 doubles, 54 triples, 173 home runs, 1,194 RBI, 281 stolen bases, 917 bases on balls, .365 on-base percentage and .417 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .978 fielding percentage playing primarily at shortstop, second and first base. In 31 postseason games, he batted .224 (22-for-98) with nine runs, two home runs, six RBI and six walks.

*As of 2006, Julio Franco was the only active player to face a pitcher who pitched against Hall of Famer Ted Williams, who retired in 1960. The pitcher is Jim Kaat, who played in the majors from 1959 to 1983. Williams had batted against Kaat the final day of the 1959 season, Kaat&#x27;s rookie year. Kaat walked Franco in the latter&#x27;s rookie season in 1982.

==Personal life==
Franco is a practicing Christian. In a 2005 interview with the &quot;Baptist Press&quot;, he said, &quot;I’ve been a Christian for 15 years,&quot; and added, &quot;I want to play until I’m 50 years old. I know that my body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and I want to keep my body healthy. I believe the key to that is discipline and obedience.”

<text>Virginia Deane Abernethy (born 1934) is an American anthropologist, far-right activist, white nationalist, and self-described &quot;ethnic separatist.&quot; She is professor emerita of psychiatry at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. She has published research on population demography and immigration. She ran for Vice President of the United States in 2012 alongside Merlin Miller for the American Third Position, a party that promotes white nationalism.

==Early life==
Virginia Deane Abernethy was born in 1934 in Cuba to American parents. She was raised in Argentina and New York City, being educated at New York&#x27;s Riverdale Country School. She received a B.A. from Wellesley College, an M.B.A. from Vanderbilt University, and Ph.D. from the Social Relations Department at Harvard University in 1970.

==Career and opinions==

Abernethy was a post-doctoral researcher and faculty member at Harvard Medical School in the early 1970s. She left Harvard when she was offered a position at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee and described the experience of leaving Massachusetts in her 2023 book, &quot;Born Abroad&quot;: &quot;A Patriot’s Tale of Choice and Chance&quot; “The exuberance with which I drove out of Massachusetts (gun-controlled Taxachusetts) toward Tennessee in my little Ford can hardly be imagined.”

She remained at Vanderbilt for 20 years, working in the Department of Psychiatry of the Vanderbilt School of Medicine from 1975 to 1999. She was appointed as Assistant Professor of Psychiatry, promoted to Associate Professor in 1976 and Professor in 1980. She retired in 1999, and still retains an office on campus as Professor Emerita. She is an anthropology fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

An outspoken opponent of immigration, she has called for a complete moratorium on immigration into the United States. She claims that immigrants devalue the workforce, deplete scarce resources, adversely impact carrying capacity, and that Third World immigration has led to a rise in dangerous diseases within the United States. She has countered claims of racism against her by pointing to her friendship with Jesse Lee Peterson.

In a letter to &quot;The Washington Times&quot; published on September 30, 2004, she rejected their reporting of her as a &quot;self-described &#x27;racial separatist, preferring &quot;ethnic separatist.&quot; The Anti-Defamation League in 2012 described her as being a &quot;white supremacist.&quot;

On June 29, 2011, the American Third Position (now the American Freedom Party), a whites-only party, announced that she had joined their board of directors. She was later nominated as their vice presidential nominee. Abernethy ran in election for vice president of the United States in 2012 as the running mate of Merlin Miller, who ran for president, in the 2012 U.S. presidential election, gaining a total of 12,900 votes nationally.

===Fertility-opportunity hypothesis===
Her research has focused on the issues of population and culture. Her best known work discounts the demographic transition theory, which holds that fertility drops as women become more educated and contraceptives become more available. In its place, she has developed a ″fertility-opportunity hypothesis&quot;, which states that fertility follows perceived economic opportunity. A corollary to the hypothesis is that food aid to developing nations only exacerbates overpopulation. She has advocated in favor of microloans to women in the place of international aid because she believes that they allow improvement in the lives of families without leading to higher fertility.

She has opposed programs that would spur economic development in less developed countries on the grounds that they are self-defeating. For the December 1994 issue of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, she wrote an article entitled &quot;Optimism and Overpopulation&quot; in which she argued that &quot;efforts to alleviate poverty often spur population growth, as does leaving open the door to immigration. Subsidies, windfalls, and the prospect of economic opportunity remove the immediacy of needing to conserve. The mantras of democracy, redistribution, and economic development raise expectations and fertility rates, fostering population growth and thereby steepening a downward environmental and economic spiral.&quot;

==Positions held and publications==
From 1989 to 1999, she served as the editor of the academic journal &quot;Population and Environment&quot;. She also served on the editorial board of &quot;The Citizen Informer,&quot; the newsletter of the Council of Conservative Citizens (CofCC), a neo-Confederate organization. She has also appeared as a guest on the CofCC-affiliated radio show, &quot;The Political Cesspool&quot; hosted by James Edwards. Abernethy regularly addresses meetings of the CofCC. In 2004, she was listed as a member of the editorial advisory board of &quot;The Occidental Quarterly&quot;, a white nationalist journal, on which she remained in 2013. She serves on the board of directors of the Carrying Capacity Network, an immigration-reduction and sustainability organization, and also on the Board of Population-Environment BALANCE, which advocates an immigration moratorium in order to balance population size with resources and the environment&#x27;s capacity to cope with pollution. However, Population-Environment BALANCE has characterized an organization that promotes a right-wing, nativist agenda under the guise of environmentalist activism.

Abernethy has written or edited several books, including: &quot;Population Politics: The Choices that Shape our Future (&quot;1993) and &quot;Population Pressure and Cultural Adjustment (&quot;1979). Abernethy has written articles that have appeared in &quot;Chronicles,&quot; &quot;The Social Contract Press&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, and numerous academic journals. She has also made occasional contributions to the weblog &quot;VDARE&quot;, which have been republished by the Center for Immigration Studies (CIS), an organisation which the SPLC describes as being a hate group. In a blog post circulated by CIS in 2012, she said, responding to Karl Rove, the George W. Bush administration strategist, &quot;those who advocate continued mass immigration choose the path of national suicide.&quot;

At a shared conference of the American Freedom Party and the Council of Conservative Citizens in June 2018 at the Montgomery Bell State Park in Tennessee, Abernethy was a speaker along with Kevin MacDonald, also a leading member of the AFP, and David Duke who was the principal speaker.

In 2012, the Anti-Defamation League referred to Abernathy as an &quot;unabashed white supremacist&quot;, and the Southern Poverty Law Center called her a &quot;full-fledged professor of hate,&quot; adding her to a list of 30 new activists heading the radical right. Abernethy denied that she was a &quot;white supremacist,&quot; preferring to describe herself as an &quot;ethnic separatist.&quot;

==Protect Arizona Now==
She was involved in Arizona&#x27;s Proposition 200 campaign. She was Chair of the National Advisory Board of the Protect Arizona Now (PAN) committee which promoted Proposition 200 in that state&#x27;s 2004 election. Proposition 200, which passed, limited undocumented immigrants access to government benefits and to require proof of citizenship for registering to vote.

During the campaign, she replied to a journalist&#x27;s question about her views by stating how she distinguished between being a separatist, rather than a supremacist: &quot;Groups tend to self-segregate. I know that I&#x27;m not a supremacist. I know that ethnic groups are more comfortable with their own kind.&quot;

<text>Johnny Pulado Estrada III (born June 27, 1976) is an American former professional baseball catcher, who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) for the Philadelphia Phillies, Atlanta Braves, Arizona Diamondbacks, Milwaukee Brewers, and Washington Nationals.

Estrada was selected in the 17th round of the 1997 Major League Baseball draft by the Philadelphia Phillies. His major league career started in with the Phillies after an injury to the regular starting catcher, Mike Lieberthal. In , he became a part-time player. Estrada was acquired by the Atlanta Braves from the Phillies on December 20, 2002, for Kevin Millwood in a move that was said to be financially motivated, since the Braves could not pay Millwood&#x27;s salary. During the season, Estrada spent most of the year on Atlanta&#x27;s Triple-A team, the Richmond Braves. After Javy López left due to free agency, Estrada became Atlanta&#x27;s starting catcher in . He hit .314 with 9 home runs and 76 RBI. Estrada also made the All-Star team and helped Atlanta win their 13th division title in a row. After a slightly disappointing season, Estrada was traded by the Braves to the Arizona Diamondbacks for pitchers Lance Cormier and Óscar Villarreal on December 7, 2005.
The season saw Estrada return to his All-Star form. He hit .302 with 11 home runs and 71 RBI in 115 games. After the 2006 season, Estrada was traded to the Milwaukee Brewers along with pitchers Claudio Vargas and Greg Aquino for pitchers Doug Davis and Dana Eveland and outfielder Dave Krynzel.

On November 20, , Estrada was traded from the Brewers to the New York Mets for pitcher Guillermo Mota. Estrada was not offered a new contract by the Mets and became a free agent on December 12, 2007. On January 31, , Estrada signed a one-year contract with the Washington Nationals worth approximately $1.25 million. On July 24, Estrada was designated for assignment, and released on July 31.

<text>Skepticism is a Finnish funeral doom metal band. Formed in 1991, they are regarded as one of the pioneers of the genre.

==History==

Starting out with a death metal sound on their first 7&quot;, Skepticism soon began to evolve into a more distinctive style, a combination of slow doom metal and death metal with prolific use of keyboards, especially using an organ sound. The keyboards intend to create a depressive sound, rather than the gothic sound that many metal bands using keyboards tend to focus on. This style was first heard on the &quot;Aeothe Kaear&quot; demo (1994), which was still up-tempo compared to the material that was to follow. The debut album &quot;Stormcrowfleet&quot; (1995) pushed the band&#x27;s style away from traditional doom metal.

After this, the band released its first &#x27;pair&#x27;, an EP and album which are thematically connected: &quot;Ethere&quot; (1997) and &quot;Lead and Aether&quot; (1998). In 1999, &quot;Aes&quot; was released, a one-track EP lasting almost 28 minutes, and another departure into different stylistic territory from the band. A variety of musical themes are explored before the song turns back upon itself and returns to the opening theme.

The band&#x27;s latest releases were contained in the second &#x27;pair&#x27;, &quot;The Process of Farmakon&quot; (2002) and &quot;Farmakon&quot; (2003). These releases involve another slight departure from earlier releases, by introducing more elements of dissonance and experimentation. Their 2008 release is called &quot;Alloy&quot;. In 2015, Skepticism released &quot;Ordeal&quot;, which was recorded live in front of an audience.

In 2021, the band released their sixth album, &quot;Companion&quot;, and a music video for the song &quot;Calla&quot;.

<text>Marcus William Giles (born May 18, 1978) is a former Major League Baseball player. He was a second baseman and batted right-handed. His older brother, Brian Giles, was an outfielder who also played in the Major Leagues. Marcus and Brian played together on the 2007 San Diego Padres.

==Career==
Giles was selected by the Atlanta Braves in the 53rd round of the 1996 Major League Baseball draft and made his major league debut in . He hit a grand slam for his first career home run off Mike Hampton of the Colorado Rockies. He became the first Braves player in 24 years to have his first MLB home run be a grand slam. Despite usually having success during his opportunities in majors, he spent the next two years shuttling between Atlanta and their Triple-A affiliate in Richmond. In , his year was marred by a severe ankle sprain in May, and the death of his premature daughter, Lundyn Mae. Giles lost his second base starting job to the injury and, shortly after returning, was demoted to Richmond. He did not play in Atlanta again until August.

In , Giles was given the starting job for good, and proceeded to put up such impressive numbers that he was selected to play in the 2003 All-Star Game. Unfortunately, he suffered a concussion the week prior to the game when Chicago Cubs pitcher Mark Prior collided with him on the basepaths. After missing about a week with the injury, Giles returned to the lineup in top form. He finished the 2003 season with 49 doubles, breaking the Braves record for doubles in a season. Giles had the best range factor among NL second baseman and was third among all NL position players in wins above replacement (as calculated by Baseball Reference).

In , Giles was poised to wage a campaign similar to 2003 but, on May 15, 2004, against the Milwaukee Brewers, while drifting way back into center field to catch a pop fly, he collided with center fielder Andruw Jones. Giles suffered a broken collarbone, a concussion, and a bruised right wrist and did not play again until July 15, 2004, missing 52 games.

Giles avoided fluke injuries in and was able to again be a consistent contributor for the Braves. He doubled 45 times (second most in the National League), scored a career high 104 runs, and was 16 for 19 in stolen base attempts.

With the departure of shortstop Rafael Furcal in late 2005, the Braves moved Giles to the lead-off position in the lineup for the season. By the end of the season, Giles had become vocal in his objections over batting leadoff. His .262 average was his lowest since becoming a starter.

Giles was hospitalized in Philadelphia on September 2, 2006, after experiencing pain in his chest and abdomen. On September 3, he was sent back to Atlanta to undergo a cardiovascular test. Giles told the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot; that he may have a damaged heart valve. On September 4, however, it was determined that his heart was perfectly healthy, and he was instead diagnosed with acid reflux, which is not as serious. He rejoined the team in New York City that evening.

In a cost-cutting measure, and due to a decline of production, the Braves non-tendered Giles on December 12, making him a free agent.

He signed a one-year deal with the Padres before the season, but did not live up to expectations and was waived on October 26, 2007.

Due to a poor performance in 2007, Giles could not get a major league contract and settled for a minor league deal with the Colorado Rockies. However, the Rockies released him before the start of the season. Giles then agreed to terms with the Los Angeles Dodgers on a minor league contract, but had a change of heart on his way to report to the Dodgers&#x27; Triple-A affiliate in Las Vegas and turned down the deal.

On January 6, , he signed a minor league contract with the Philadelphia Phillies. He did not make the team, and was released on March 30.

In 792 games over seven seasons, Giles compiled a .277 batting average (813-for-2934) with 468 runs, 187 doubles, 16 triples, 76 home runs, 333 RBI, 70 stolen bases, 318 bases on balls, .353 on-base percentage and .429 slugging percentage. He finished his career with a .981 fielding percentage. In 25 postseason games, he hit .217 (20-for-92) with 15 runs, 3 doubles, 2 home runs, 6 RBI and 7 walks.

==Personal life==

Giles and his ex-wife, Tracy, have 3 daughters.

<text>The University of Asia and the Pacific (UA&amp;P; ) is a private university in the Philippines. It traces its beginnings to the Center for Research and Communication (CRC), which was established on August 15, 1967, as a private think-tank that conducted economic and social research and offered graduate courses in economics.

The spiritual and doctrinal formation given in the university is entrusted to Opus Dei, a Personal prelature of the Catholic Church.

==History==
On August 15, 1967, a non-profit private research center was formally established by economists Dr. Bernardo M. Villegas and Dr. Jesus P. Estanislao, who would later be appointed Finance Secretary during the presidency of Corazon Aquino. It served as a think-tank for private sector businesses and a provider of economics training programs.

After this formal establishment, CRC set up its offices in a rented facility along Jorge Bocobo Street in Malate, Manila. Prior to this, the CRC&#x27;s first office was at the offices of the United Coconut Authority of the Philippines, a private organization of coconut producers, then headed by Ambassador Jose V. Romero Jr., who served as its executive director.

The expansion of CRC into a university was inspired by a private meeting in Mexico between the founder of Opus Dei, Msgr. Josemaría Escrivá (now Saint), and the founders of CRC in 1970. The meeting encouraged Estanislao and Villegas to expand the institution&#x27;s horizons internationally, which resulted to its first graduate program, the Masters in Industrial Economics.

CRC then moved to its current campus in Ortigas Center, Pasig, with established formal and informal programs in 1982. A year later, the Center for Food and Agribusiness was established. Then in 1987, CRC was reminded by Bishop Álvaro del Portillo to establish a university. This resulted to the Institute of Development Education, the foundation for the School of Education.

In 1995, the CRC&#x27;s bid to become a university was approved by the Philippines&#x27; Commission on Higher Education, and the new university was named the University of Asia and the Pacific (UA&amp;P). The CRC did not cease to exist, however; it continued to take on consultancy projects under its old name, as the Center for Research and Communication Foundation, Inc.

On March 19, 1989, the UA&amp;P College of Arts and Sciences was established and admitted its first batch of 158 college students. The center finally gained its university status on June 26, 1995, with Dr. Estanislao as its first University President and Fr. Ramon Lopez, the regional Vicar of Opus Dei for Asia, as its Vice Grand Chancellor.

== Administration and organization ==

The university is made up of a college offering liberal arts courses as core curriculum and six schools of varied specializations.

A Board of Trustees, chaired by Ambassador Jose L. Cuisia, Jr., takes care of the UA&amp;P Foundation, Inc. Under it is the Management Committee, presided by University President Dr. Winston Conrad Padojinog, which is the university&#x27;s governing body. It was formed to steer the university in the path set out for it. It makes sure that all plans, activities, and projects undertaken advance the mission, goals, and values of the university.

== Campus ==
=== Ortigas Campus ===
The Ortigas Campus has five buildings: Administration &amp; Library Building (ALB), College of Arts and Sciences (CAS), Development Communications Building (DCB), APEC Communications Building (ACB), and Parking and Sports Building (PSB).

== Academic programs ==
The University offers 19 undergraduate degrees and 13 stand-alone graduate degrees. It also offers two fast-track master’s programs: 5-Year Program (5YP), which is offered to incoming college freshmen that allows them to earn a bachelor’s degree and a master’s degree in just five years; and a 6-Year Integrated University Program (6YP), which is offered to incoming junior college (JC) students (senior high school) that allows them to earn their JC diploma, a bachelor’s degree, and a master’s degree in just six years. Another program, Lex Honors, offers graduates of Grade 12 an undergraduate degree and a Juris Doctor degree in seven years. 

UA&amp;P&#x27;s academic programs operate on a semester calendar beginning in early August and ending in mid-May. Since 1998, students are graded in increments of 0.25, from 3.50(failing grade) to 1.00. Undergraduate students and students under the fast-track Master&#x27;s program may graduate with &quot;Latin honors&quot; depending on their graduating GWA. For students of standalone graduate programs, they may graduate &quot;with High Distinction&quot; or &quot;with Distinction&quot;.

== Student life ==
=== Student Mentoring Program ===
An intrinsic part of the liberal education that UA&amp;P offers—and part of the commitment of the University to the holistic development of its students—is the Student Mentoring Program, through which the University’s interdisciplinary offering of knowledge, skills, and values is reinforced on a one-to-one personal level.

The Student Mentoring Program provides students with the opportunity to avail of personal advising and assistance in different areas and at various stages of their student life. It will help them to reflect upon, assess, evaluate, and integrate their learning skills and experiences—under the guidance of their mentor—in a way that benefits the acquisition and strengthening of their intellectual skills and moral criteria. This is aimed toward the holistic formation of the students’ personal, professional, and social life.

=== Student Development Programs ===
There are three sub-programs that handle a more specific range of activities to ensure learning and development even on activities that involve personal interest. These are Organizations and Leadership (which focuses on the development of the student organizations and student leaders through assemblies, leadership workshops, and facilitating students’ participation in external opportunities), Kultura (which seeks to preserve and promote culture and the arts and its significant role in liberal education), and Civics (which focuses on socio-civic initiatives, and guides student organizations in the execution of their outreach projects).

=== Sports Development Programs ===
At UA&amp;P, participation in sports is seen not only as a mechanism for the development of students’ physical competence and fitness, but more importantly for their character formation. With each training session or competition, with each victory or loss—students imbibe the values of teamwork, self-mastery, discipline, and the practice of sportsmanship at all times. 

The University competes in the Men&#x27;s National Collegiate Athletics Association (MNCAA) and the Women&#x27;s National Collegiate Athletics Association (WNCAA) and supports teams in basketball, futsal, volleyball, handball, tennis, badminton, swimming, arnis, taekwondo, aikido, karate, table tennis, and athletics.

In December 2008, the men&#x27;s futsal team won the championship cup in the MNCAA. 

In October 2009, the women&#x27;s basketball and volleyball teams won the championship titles in the WNCAA.

In February 2012, the UA&amp;P Firestarters, the university&#x27;s all-female cheerdance varsity, grabbed the WNCAA cheerdance competition gold.

=== Student Organizations ===
Student interest groups are available for writers, theater artists, dancers and dance enthusiasts, and musicians and music producers. There are associations for students interested in environmental conservation, multi-cultural understanding, outreaches and advocacies, entrepreneurship, case competitions, or student representations. A host of other student groups and volunteer opportunities are also available. The UA&amp;P Chorale represents the University in external competitions. In addition, each school, college, institute, or academic program also has its own academic association.

The Office of Student Affairs&#x27; Civics Desk holds the annual youth conference Civitas Asia and the BIGGKAS project which extends tutorial sessions to local public schools. The desk also supports student organizations with socio-civic aims and activities.

Virtus is the UA&amp;P Competition League, an association of the University&#x27;s academic competing teams. It consists of FORUM: The UA&amp;P Debate Society, Aureum: The UA&amp;P Case Competition Pool, Odyssey: The UA&amp;P Junior College Competition Pool, Citadel: The UA&amp;P Investment Society, Minerva: The UA&amp;P Public Policy Delegation, Trivium: The UA&amp;P English Olympiad, Icarus: The UA&amp;P STEAM Team, and the UA&amp;P Model United Nations.

Virtus has led numerous student achievements including making UA&amp;P the first Philippine university to win the Asian Business Case Competition @ Nanyang,&lt;ref name=&quot;https://mb.com.ph/2021/09/28/filipino-students-win-intl-business-case-tilt/&quot;&gt;Filipino students win int&#x27;l business case tilt, https://mb.com.ph/2021/09/28/filipino-students-win-intl-business-case-tilt/&lt;/ref&gt; Citibank APAC Treasury and Trade Solutions Case Competition,&lt;ref name=&quot;https://mb.com.ph/2022/01/19/filipino-students-win-intl-case-tilt/&quot;&gt;Filipino students win int&#x27;l case tilt, https://mb.com.ph/2022/01/19/filipino-students-win-intl-case-tilt/&lt;/ref&gt; and 2022 Asian English Olympics,&lt;ref name=&quot;https://mb.com.ph/2022/03/13/filipino-students-named-champions-in-asian-english-olympics/&quot;&gt;Filipino students named champions in Asian English Olympics, https://mb.com.ph/2022/03/13/filipino-students-named-champions-in-asian-english-olympics/&lt;/ref&gt; among other local and international events.

=== Student Government ===
All students are highly encouraged to participate in student government by voting in student government elections, and by supporting the various projects of the elected officers of the University Student Government (USG), the highest governing body of the student population. Students may also take a more active role by volunteering for the different committees under each USG officer, by joining a political party, by running for office (whether under a political party or as an independent candidate), or by volunteering for the UA&amp;P Commission on Elections.

== Center for Research and Communication ==

Since the CHED&#x27;s approval of the creation of University of Asia and the Pacific in 1995, a separate unit taking on the name of the Center for Research and Communication has taken on consultancy work in close association with the new university and focusing on the areas of business, economics, international relations, and education, as well as more recently food and agribusiness, energy, data science, analytics, and transportation and logistics.

Aside from its regular business consultancy work, CRC&#x27;s linkages with UA&amp;P over the years have allowed it to partner with corporations and foundations to fund Professorial Chairs in the areas of Policy Research, Social Economics, Migration and Overseas Filipino Work, Family and Youth Education to establish institutional research work.

CRC made research on social economics a major part of its agenda beginning in 2013, with the agenda defined as &quot;how economics and business can–without losing their predominant concerns on getting the maximum material benefits from relatively scarce resources.&quot; Much of CRC&#x27;s work in this area has focused on cooperatives, with one major initiative being the gathering of stakeholder inputs for the Implementing Rules and Regulations of the Philippines&#x27; Cooperative Development Authority Charter of 2019 (Republic Act 11364).

In 2014, CRC also established a research chair specifically focused on Migration and Overseas Filipino Work, initially in partnership with the BPI Foundation. Its notable research in the area concerns the support system needs of OFWs, on their reintegratrion experiences upon returning to the Philippines, and an influential 2022 study on OFWs physical and mental health needs which was later awarded the inaugural APEC Healthy Women, Healthy Economies Research Prize by the APEC Forum on Women and the Economy in 2019.

<text>Elieser Marrero (born November 17, 1973), is a Cuban former Major League Baseball player. Marrero started his career as a catcher, but spent time at first base, third base and in the outfield.

==Playing career==

=== St. Louis Cardinals ===

Marrero was selected in the third round of the 1993 Major Leage Baseball draft by the St. Louis Cardinals. He debuted with the Cardinals in September 1997.

Marrero was diagnosed with thyroid cancer during spring training in 1998. He had his thyroid removed on March 6, but returned the Cardinals on April 13. He missed two months in 2000 after tearing a ligament in his thumb. When he returned to the Cardinals in September, he started logging time in the outfield and at first base, while still catching occasionally. Marrero caught Bud Smith&#x27;s no-hitter on September 3, 2001.

=== Atlanta Braves ===
The Cardinals traded Marrero and J.D. Drew to the Atlanta Braves in December 2003 for pitchers Jason Marquis, Ray King, and prospect Adam Wainwright. Marrero hit .415 against left-handed pitchers with Atlanta in 2004, serving as a backup outfielder behind lefties Drew and Charles Thomas. 

=== Partial seasons with several MLB teams ===
Following the 2004 season, the Braves dealt him to the Kansas City Royals, who needed a power-hitting corner outfielder, for minor-league pitcher Jorge Vasquez. He saw action at all three outfield positions and first base, but hit only .159 in 32 games. The Royals designated him for assignment on May 31, 2005. On June 8, the Royals traded him and cash considerations to the Baltimore Orioles for minor-league infielder Peter Maestrales. He played in 22 games for the Orioles, batting a slightly better .220. He became a free agent after the season.

Marrero signed with the Colorado Rockies on January 7, 2006. He played in 30 games for the Rockies, batting .217 with 4 home runs. He played catcher for one inning in his first game with the Rockies, the first time playing the position since 2003. On June 9, while playing in Triple-A, the Rockies traded Marrero to the New York Mets for infielder Kaz Matsui and cash to offset Matsui&#x27;s contract. On July 2, Marrero saw his first major league action at third base, playing two innings in a blowout loss to the New York Yankees. On August 9, the Mets released Marrero, after he hit .182 in 25 games.

On November 28, 2006, Marrero signed a minor league deal by the St. Louis Cardinals. On May 21, 2007, the Cardinals released Marrero, who played only one game with the Triple-A Memphis Redbirds.

==Coaching career==
In July 2011, Marrero was named the batting coach of the Billings Mustangs. Marrero was the manager of the Arizona League Reds in 2013. On December 1, 2014, Marrero was named manager of the Cincinnati Reds Class A-Advanced affiliate, the Daytona Tortugas. Marrero was with the Tortugas until late in the 2017 season, when he was replaced by Ricky Gutiérrez.

==Personal life==

Marrero is the uncle of professional baseball players Chris Marrero, Christian Marrero, and Deven Marrero.

Marrero&#x27;s son Elih was a 29th round pick by the Cincinnati Reds in the 2015 MLB draft, but he elected to play college baseball at Mississippi State. Elih later transferred to St. Thomas University in Florida and was selected by the Boston Red Sox in the eighth round of the 2018 MLB draft.

<text>A permanent wave, commonly called a perm or permanent (sometimes called a &quot;curly perm&quot; to distinguish it from a &quot;straight perm&quot;), is a hairstyle consisting of waves or curls set into the hair. The curls may last a number of months, hence the name.

Perms may be applied using thermal or chemical means. In the latter method, chemicals are applied to the hair, which is then wrapped around forms to produce waves and curls. The same process is used for chemical straightening or relaxing, with the hair being flattened instead of curled during the chemical reaction.

==History==
The first person to produce a practical thermal method was Marcel Grateau in 1872. He devised a pair of specially manufactured tongs, in which one of the arms had a circular cross-section and the other a concave one, so that one fitted inside the other when the tongs were closed. The tongs were generally heated over a gas or alcohol flame and the correct temperature was achieved by testing the tongs on a newspaper; if the paper browned slightly it was about right. The waving itself was safe if care was taken to keep the tongs away from the scalp. The procedure was to comb a lock of hair towards the operator, moving the comb slowly with one hand to maintain some tension, while applying the tongs to the hair successively down the lock of hair towards the point. Each time the tongs were applied, they were moved slightly in a direction normal to the lock of hair, thus producing a continuous flat or two-dimensional wave. Skill using the wrist could produce slight variations of the wave. Thus, Marcel waving produced a two-dimensional wave, by thermal means only and the change was produced by plastic flow of the hair, rather than by any chemical means. Because of the high temperature used, the process tended to degrade the hair. However, in spite of its drawbacks, forms of Marcel waving have persisted until today, when speedy results and low cost are important.

In the Western world, long hair was standard for women until the 1920s, when flappers cut their hair short (into a &quot;bob&quot;) as a form of rebellion against tradition. As the demand for self-determination grew among women, hair was shortened so that it did not pass the lower end of the neck. This was not only a political gesture but a practical one, as women began to take over men&#x27;s work due to the great shortage of labour during the First World War. At the same time, electricity, which had been introduced mainly for lighting and industrial use, began to be used for heating and the application of the electric motor at the small business and domestic level. Shorter hair was improved in appearance by waving even more than long hair, and soon an improved form of waving would appear.

===Nessler===
An early alternative method for curling hair that was suitable for use on people was invented in 1905 by German hairdresser Karl Nessler. He used a mixture of cow urine and water. The first public demonstration took place on 8 October 1905, but Nessler had been working on the idea since 1896. Previously, wigs had been set with caustic chemicals to form curls, but these recipes were too harsh to use next to human skin. His method, called the spiral heat method, was only useful for long hair. The hair was wrapped in a spiral around rods connected to a machine with an electric heating device. Sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) was applied and the hair was heated to or more for an extended period of time. The process used about twelve brass rollers and took six hours to complete. These hot rollers were kept from touching the scalp by a complex system of countering weights which were suspended from an overhead chandelier and mounted on a stand. Nessler conducted his first experiments on his wife, Katharina Laible. The first two attempts resulted in completely burning her hair off and some scalp burns, but the method was improved and his electric permanent wave machine was used in London in 1909 on the long hair of the time.

Nessler had moved to London in 1901, and during World War I, the British jailed Nessler because he was German and forced him to surrender his assets. He escaped to New York City in 1915, buying passage on a steamship under an assumed name. In New York, he found that hundreds of copies of his machine were in use, but most did not work well and were unreliable. Nessler opened a shop on East 49th Street, and soon had salons in Chicago, Detroit, Palm Beach, Florida and Philadelphia. Nessler also developed a machine for home use that was sold for fifteen dollars. However, his machine made little impression in Europe and his first attempts were not even mentioned in the professional press, perhaps because they were too long-winded, cumbersome and dangerous. 

===Eugene Suter and Isidoro Calvete===

Eugene Suter was a Swiss immigrant who set up a fashionable ladies&#x27; salon in London&#x27;s West End. He claimed to have come from Paris, which in those days was the center of fashion and style. He became aware of the possibilities of electrical permanent waving particularly when shorter hair allowed the design of smaller equipment. The system had two parts; one was the electric heater and the other was the system of winding and holding the hair on a form which was inserted into a heater. Suter tried to design a heater, but was unsuccessful.

Isidoro Calvete was a Spanish immigrant who set up a workshop for the repair and manufacture of electrical equipment in the same area of London in 1917. This equipment was just coming into use for the hairdressing and medical professions. Suter consulted him on the heater and Calvete designed a practical model consisting of two windings inserted into an aluminium tube. This ensured that when inserted over a root winding, the thicker hair nearer to the root became hotter than the thinner hair at the end. Suter patented the design in his own name and for the next 12 years ordered all his hairdressing equipment from Calvete but marketed under his commercial name, Eugene Ltd, which became synonymous with permanent waving throughout the world. At the same time, Calvete developed his own products which he manufactured under the name Icall, Ltd. The simultaneous manufacture of two competing lines would inevitably result in conflict.

Eugene company had a factory in Edgware Road, London. Its products included colour rinses, lustre-lending shampoos, setting lotions and patented steaming sachets as well as its curlers and electric dryer. At least two dozen of the steaming sachets were used for each perm. The company published its own magazine, &quot;The Eugène Waver&quot;, which was sent to hairdressers across the country. It covered advice on using Eugène products, styling techniques and hairdressing trends. Readers were referred to as ‘Eugène wavers’. The National Art Library at the V&amp;A Museum holds volumes of the magazine covering the period 1928 to 1947. During the war, the company made millions of screws and rivets for airplanes and tanks in its factory. The company’s name was so well known that a 1945 page advertisement in Good Housekeeping magazine consisted of a blank page with just the handwritten words:‘What would you like for Christmas?&#x27;

&#x27;Oh, a Eugène wave, please!’From the onset, Eugene had realised the importance of the United States market and made great inroads, challenging Nessler who had started up there. The former also sued the latter for infringing the patent which he had taken out based on Calvete&#x27;s design, and won his case. Nessler was to retaliate some years later suing Eugene in the United Kingdom, over some curlers designed by Calvete which were similar to the Nessler ones.

====Development of the heaters====
The first heaters as described above were tubular, and were inserted over the hair which had been previously wound on to a form or curler. To facilitate this, after a preliminary preparation of the hair, such as washing, cutting or tapering, the hair was combed into up to about 22 sections or locks, a process known a sectioning or squaring off. Each lock of hair was then wound onto the curler (which was basically a rod standing perpendicular to the head), starting at the bottom using the hair nearest the scalp and proceeding spirally up the curler for the length of the lock. For this reason, the process was colloquially referred to as root winding. Considerable ingenuity was exercised in designing the curler to minimize the time, effort and difficulties entailed in winding. In early models, the heaters had a tendency to flop downward on to the head, but with improved designs, they tended to point outwards (see illustration).

A second type of curler was invented later, allegedly in 1924 by a Czech hairdresser called Josef Mayer. In this method, the hair was fed through a small clamp which, after winding, would hold the two ends of a roller. The ends of the hair were held on the roller which was wound around a point until it reached the clamp into which it was inserted. For obvious reasons, this was called point-winding. Mayer attempted to claim a patent on this method of winding, which was challenged in a Federal lawsuit by the National Hairdressers&#x27; and Cosmetologists&#x27; Association.

Calvete designed a new type of heater for this called a croquignole heater which fitted over the winding, rather like a bulldog clip. The trend was to replace some of the tubular heaters on the sides of the head with croquignole ones, to allow greater scope of styling.

====Development of the units====

Apart from portable models which became available later, some system of support was necessary for the curlers. At first these were fixed to the ceiling, but these were soon replaced by a machine that was universally adopted. A vertical metal pipe held a circular unit, called a &quot;chandelier&quot; from which the heaters were suspended. The bottom of the pipe was mounted on a base with wheels which enabled the device to be moved easily between clients or to one side of the salon. By providing a structure from which to distribute the electricity to the heaters, as well as to keep all of them in the correct position and orientation, the chandelier helped minimize the weight of the entire system while also keeping things tidy.

Because of expense, the early models only had a few tubular heaters, and permanent-waving process took place in more than one stage. As the process became more popular and competitive, a whole head of hair could be processed in one sitting, using up to 22 heaters, some of which might be croquignole.

====Development of the &quot;reagents&quot;====
Although heat was required for perming, it was soon realized that if an improvement had to be made over the Marcel method, other means were necessary to avoid overheating and to speed up the waving process. The use of water on its own was an obvious choice, particularly as the hair was already wet from washing, for no other reason than that it prevented overheating, and that steam seemed to improve the process (hence the expression &quot;steaming time&quot;). It was not long before experiments were carried out on the use of additives, and it was soon apparent that alkaline additives improved the results.

Thus the profession started using what was called a &quot;reagent&quot;, perhaps concocted by the hairdresser himself or sold commercially by the manufacturers of the machine. Two common ingredients were borax and ammonia, which are mildly alkaline (having a high pH) but are relatively harmless.

===J. Bari-Woollss===
Until about 1930, most progress was empirical, that is, each hairdresser tended to use a method which he had found to be useful. By then, although some academic work had been done on the subject of hair, Calvete felt that more research should be done on the chemistry of hair, and engaged a chemist by the name of Bari-Woollss, who specialized in the subject. He carried out controlled experiments on known factors such as the effect of heat, water/steam and alkalinity and experimented on variations of the winding process, such as the type of hair, the tension or tightness of winding, the flatness of winding, the overlap and pitch. His practical lectures on the subject proved highly popular among hairdressing professionals, and he wrote a book on the subject.

Certain basic factors he pointed out are still relevant today. A point winding is almost two dimensional, rather like the spring of a watch spiral. A root winding is three-dimensional much like a spiral staircase or, more properly, a helix. Thus point winding tends to produce more of a curl, but both produce waved hair when pulled slightly. Point produces a thicker winding and so heat takes longer to penetrate the core of the winding. Root winding is heated over a greater length and the thickness of the winding will depend on the overlap between turns.

Bari-Woollss was probably instrumental in introducing a new factor-redox reduction. In chemistry, this is the opposite of oxidation and can mean the removal of oxygen or, in this case, the addition of hydrogen, which by breaking the bonds of the keratin in the hair, allowed waving to take place more easily. This resulted in addition of a sulfite, bisulfite or metabisulfite to Icall reagents, sulfur dioxide, a reducing agent, being evolved on heating. The only alternative to sulfites at the time would have been mercaptans which are unpleasant to use. However, later alternatives were found which led to the development of cold-waving. Bari-Woollss left Icall in about 1934 to take over the editorship of an encyclopedic volume on women&#x27;s hairdressing.

===Developments after 1930===
By 1930, the process of permanent-waving was well established and its importance can be gauged if one considers that the majority of middle-class women, at a rough estimate, had their hair set once a week and permed perhaps once every three months as new hair replaced the waved hair. Meanwhile, hairdressers sought to improve the process and reduce the work involved; this meant savings at the lower end of the market and yet more women getting their hair permed. This was also stimulated by pictures of the rich and famous, particularly film stars, who all had their hair permed.

This resulted in many copies of the original equipment being made by reputable firms in some cases with innovations of their own:

* Nestlé. Nessler re-entered the British market under this name, introducing the &quot;Radione&quot; system in which the hair was wound dry and inserted into hollow cellophane tubes sealed at both ends, but contained moistened paper. Also introduced the &quot;oleum&quot; system in which water was replaced by oil.
*MacDonald. A revolutionary system, as it did not use direct electrical heating. Steam was generated in a separate kettle, or later in small individual kettles, the steam being led by tubes to each &quot;heater&quot;. Arrangements had to be made to remove the condensed water, but there was no risk of overheating nor of electric shock, but scalding was a risk.
* Gallia originated by J. Metelski, is credited with first moistening the hair with a reagent. which gave better results but made winding more difficult. It was said to be a very fast system.
* Superma originated by Sartory, was a machineless system that relied on the chemical reaction of the contents of a cotton pad, with water. Temperature control was rather more difficult but the method was popular in the United States perhaps because electricity was not used.
* Wella-Rapide was a German system that used croquignole heaters exclusively. A chandelier was not used and for safety worked at a reduced voltage.
* Frigidine was one of the few, apart from Icall, to use a timing mechanism and Bakelite heaters.
* Vapeur Marcel was a French machine based on the same principles as the MacDonald.

The manner in which reagents worked when applied to the hair and heated, was not only due to the chemicals they contained, but also the effect of the water. Water not only played a part in &quot;steaming&quot; the hair, but there was better heat control, because while there was water, the temperature hardly passed 100 °C. However, this evaporated the water, and it was found that by wrapping the windings with aluminium foil, the hair stayed moist for longer, and also kept the windings upright, facilitating the addition of the heaters.

A further advance was the use of so-called sachets: small absorbent pads containing certain chemicals, attached to foil or other waterproof material, such as vegetable parchment. The sachets were placed in water and then wound rapidly round the curlers. These were popular with hairdressers as a labour-saving device, and with manufacturers, as they were only used once and some 20 would be used for a head of hair.

There were also changes in the equipment. Icall pioneered the use of plastics in hairdressing equipment, specifically a thermosetting plastic, (Bakelite) which was used not only because of its electrical properties in the windings of motors and heaters, but in the outer coverings of the heaters. They were less affected by corrosion and were less likely to burn the fingers of the hairdresser. Icall also used Bakelite for the outer casings of hand-held hair-dryers and also for the large linings of pedestal hair-dryers.

It can be imagined that at a time when electrical installations were not to today&#x27;s standards and at one time were not even grounded, the application of electrical windings to wet hair resulted in enough accidents to worry women. Icall developed what was called the &quot;wireless&quot; system, in which the electric lead to the heater was replaced by a cord that took the weight of the heater, and the heater was heated by plugging into a socket in the chandelier. Outwardly, the machine looked similar to the earlier model, but at no time was there an electric potential near the head.

Also during this time, in the United States a machine-less method that applied preheated clamps over the wrapped rods was invented, In 1931, at the Midwest Beauty Show in Chicago, Ralph L. Evans and Everett G. McDonough showed a heatless system for the first time. Their method used bi-sulfide solution and was often applied at the salon, left on while the client went home and removed the next day, leading it to be called the overnight wave.

With the outbreak of World War II in 1939, all production of such equipment stopped in Europe and hardly recovered afterwards, being replaced either by home heater kits or cold-waving methods.

==Modern perms==
===Cold wave===
In 1938, Arnold F. Willatt invented the cold wave, the precursor to the modern perm. It used no machines and no heat. The hair was wrapped on rods and a reduction lotion containing ammonium thioglycolate was applied. This chemical breaks open the disulfide linkages between the polypeptide bonds in the keratin; the protein structure in the hair. The disulfide bonds give hair its elasticity, and can be reformed with chemicals. Next, an oxidation lotion—hydrogen peroxide—was applied to close the disulfide bridges again, and the hair was reformed to the shape of the rod. The entire process took 6–8 hours at room temperature.

In the 1970s, acid perms were invented. These ammonia-free acid perms, sometimes called buffered waves, use glyceryl monothioglycolate in the place of ammonia. Acid perms, or buffered wavers, are slower but gentler to the hair. Heat is usually added by placing the client under a dryer, after covering the wrapped head with a plastic cap. The reaction is endothermic and the additional heat causes the pH to rise from 6.9 to 7.2.

Perms today use this method with sodium thioglycolate instead of ammonium thioglycolate, at a pH of 8 to 9.5. Perming hair with the sodium thioglycolate method takes only 15–30 minutes of exposure to the sodium thioglycolate solution before a neutralizer solution is applied to bring the pH back to normal and re-bond the hair.

The permanent relaxer straightens the hair instead of curling it. The same chemical methods can be used for this, but the hair is not wrapped around rods.

===Other modern perms===
Other types of modern perms include exothermic perms, which are self timing and self heating; and neutral, or low pH, thioglycolate free perms.

Digital perms were introduced in the 21st century and in use especially in modern Asian cultures. The process was patented and invented by a Japanese company, Paimore Ltd.

==Technical considerations==
There are two parts to a perm: the physical action of wrapping the hair, and the chemical phase. Both of these can affect the result. Important physical variables involved are what type of rod is used, how the hair is wrapped and how end papers are used. The two most common types of rods are straight and concave; each giving a different curl effect. The wrapping method is either spiral or croquinole, and various types and the positioning of end papers can be used with any combination of the above. Generally, smaller rods will produce smaller, tighter curls and increase the appearance of shortening the hair.

The chemical solution used in the perming process is determined by the client&#x27;s hair type and the pH of the solution. Classic alkaline perms are used for stronger, coarser hair. They work at room temperature and usually contain ammonium thioglycolate in the pH range of 9-10. Acid perms are used on more delicate or thinner hair. They require outside heat application and usually contain glyceryl monothioglycolate (GMT) in the pH range of 6.5-8.2. Glyceryl monothioglycolate is considered a recent innovation in perming technology due to its high curling power near the pH of hair. This allows hair cuticles to remain closed during the perming process, minimizing damage to the hair structure.

==Home perms==
A number of brands of home permanent kits were available since the invention of the &#x27;cold wave&#x27; in the 1940s, but their numbers have decreased as permanent waves are not as popular as they were in the 1980s. The first popular home permanent was the TONI brand produced by the Toni Home Permanent Company (founded by brothers Neison and Irving Harris) at its facility in Forest Lake, Minnesota. The Toni company used a set of twins to advertise their products; one with a salon perm and one with the home perm. They introduced a number of types and brands over the next four decades (Silkwave, UnCurly, Tonette, Silver Curl, Prom, Scatter Perm, Lightwaves, Epic Waves) and a formula to remove curl: Curl-Free. The other popular brand was LILT by soap manufacturer Procter &amp; Gamble which included a foam perm in a can called &quot;Push Button&quot; Lilt and a &#x27;Milk Wave&#x27; that used fresh milk as part of the lotion as well as a children&#x27;s perm. Other types of perms included no-lotion perms that used specially treated end papers to produce the wave (PACE, SELF) and self-neutralizing perms that needed no neutralizer but had to set by drying the hair on the perm rods after rinsing out the wave solution. No-mix liquid neutralizers were introduced as many perms were air-neutralized or used a powder that was mixed with water or a powder/liquid combination. Other brands included Richard Hudnut, Ogilvie, Revlon and Nutri-Tonic. At the peak of the second wave of popularity in the 1970s and 1980s, a number of new brands and types of perms were introduced including no-ammonia perms and &quot;soft&quot; perms (Rave) which guaranteed no-frizz results even on bleached or tinted hair, as well as temporary perms that lasted only a few weeks before washing away, leaving hair in virtually the same condition as before. Other types included customized versions that let consumers adjust the curl level before making it permanent and spot perms that let certain parts of the hair be curled (bangs, crown, ends), leaving the rest of the hair untouched. Another brand that was a household name in Britain in the late 1960s and 1970s was Twink (home perm).

<text>Kinuko Yamabe Craft (born January 3, 1940) is a Japanese-born American painter, illustrator and fantasy artist.

==Biography==

Kinuko Yamabe Craft was born in Kanazawa, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan on January 3, 1940. She graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1964 from the Kanazawa College of Art. After graduating, she came to the United States in 1964 to study at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago where she continued her studies in design and illustration. A majority of her earlier work was for the editorial and advertising market.

Craft illustrated the cover art of the older editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s work for the Folger Library. She has a passionate love of European fine art and draws on a deep knowledge of European art history in creating her work. She is most inspired by the works of Leonardo da Vinci, the Pre-Raphaelites, and Symbolist painters. Her work is done with a combination of artist oils and watercolor on clayboard gesso panels.

Craft has illustrated eight picture books (fairy tale and classic mythology) designed for children and young readers. Since the mid-1990s, she has concentrated her efforts on art for fantasy book jackets. Her art has included paintings for the book covers of many well-known fantasy authors such as Patricia A. McKillip, Juliet Marillier, and Tanith Lee. She has also designed opera posters, fairy tale books and painted cover art for many national magazines such as &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Newsweek&quot;, and &quot;National Geographic&quot;.

She has collaborated with many authors and worked with her husband Mahlon F. Craft and her daughter Marie Charlotte Craft. Her original paintings, drawings, and limited-edition prints are represented by Borsini-Burr Gallery in Montara, California, and other galleries.

Her art has been licensed on calendars, posters, greeting cards, and other consumer goods. Her fairy tale books are currently distributed in the USA, other English-speaking countries, Europe, Greece, China, and Korea. She has received numerous awards for her work, including several gold and silver medals from the Society of Illustrators, New York, NY. Ms. Craft’s work can be found in the collections of National Portrait Gallery (United States), the Museum of American Illustration in New York City, the National Geographic Society, and other corporate collections.

She has been nominated five times since 2001 as a Best Artist for the World Fantasy Awards and won the World Fantasy Award for Best Artist in 2011.

Craft has also lectured and given workshops at numerous art schools, universities, and organizations, including Art Center College of Art and Design, San Jose State University, Rhode Island School of Design, Philadelphia College of the Arts (2012), and more.

In 2022, a 294 page collection featuring over 300 of Craft&#x27;s drawings and paintings entitled &quot;Visions of Beauty&quot; was published by Borsini-Burr. The book is nominated for a Locus Award for Best Illustration and Art Book, and Craft is nominated for Best Artist for 2023.

DeRosa primarily played third base and second base, but he started at every position other than center field, pitcher, and catcher. He currently works for MLB Network as a studio analyst. He managed the United States national team at the 2023 World Baseball Classic, leading them to a silver medal.

A Carlstadt, New Jersey, native, DeRosa attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he led the football team to consecutive Ivy League championships as their quarterback in 1994 and 1995. He also played baseball for the Quakers, and he chose to sign when the Braves selected him in the seventh round (212th overall) of the 1996 MLB draft. Originally a shortstop, DeRosa debuted with the Braves briefly in 1998. He gradually got more playing time over the next few seasons, especially after transitioning to a utility player in 2001. In 2004, the Braves tried using him as their starting third baseman, but he was benched in June after struggling. Not offered a contract after the season, he signed with the Rangers. After playing just 66 games with them in 2005, he became an everyday player in 2006, batting .296 and setting career highs in several offensive categories.

Prior to the 2007 season, DeRosa signed a three-year contract with the Cubs. He set a career high with 149 games played in 2007, then equaled that total in 2008, hitting over 20 home runs (21) for the first time in his career. DeRosa was traded to the Indians in 2009, then to the Cardinals in midseason. He hit a career-high 23 home runs but injured his left wrist during the year. Offseason surgery was unsuccessful, and left wrist issues severely limited his playing time with the Giants in 2010 and 2011. DeRosa appeared in 48 games with the Nationals in 2012, then hit his 100th career home run with the Blue Jays in 2013 before retiring after the season.

==High school and college==
DeRosa was born on February 26, 1975, in Passaic, New Jersey. His parents, father Jack and mother Mickey, were descended from Italian immigrants. Jack played college baseball as a pitcher for the Fairleigh Dickinson Knights, for whom he once threw a no hitter. Growing up in Carlstadt, New Jersey, a New York City suburb, Mark regularly watched the New York Yankees on television. His favorite player was Don Mattingly. His early playing experience came with Carlstadt&#x27;s Little League team, which was sponsored by General Tire and coached by his father. He attended Bergen Catholic High School in Oradell, New Jersey, where he earned all-state honors in baseball and in football.

Offered football scholarships to the College of William &amp; Mary as well as Rutgers University, DeRosa instead attended the University of Pennsylvania (Penn), preferring its academic reputation and the opportunity to play baseball as well. After redshirting as a freshman, he became the starting quarterback for the Quakers in 1994, leading them to an undefeated season and an Ivy League championship. He led them to another Ivy League championship in 1995. Passing for 3,895 yards and 25 touchdowns during his career, he became one of the top quarterbacks in school history.

Meanwhile, DeRosa played shortstop on the baseball team. In 1995, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Bourne Braves. Originally expected to be a reserve, he became the team&#x27;s starting third baseman when Troy Glaus departed to play for a national team. Batting over .300, he was selected to the league&#x27;s All-Star team. At Penn, DeRosa was a member of the Sigma Chi fraternity.

Drafted by the Atlanta Braves in the seventh round (212th overall) of the 1996 Major League Baseball (MLB) draft, DeRosa chose to forego participating in college sports as a senior to instead pursue a professional baseball career. However, he continued to take classes in management and marketing, graduating from Penn&#x27;s Wharton School in 1997.

==MLB career==

===Atlanta Braves (1998–2004)===
====Brief callups (1998–2000)====
DeRosa made his professional debut in 1996 with the Eugene Emeralds of the Class A short season Northwest League. Progressing through Atlanta&#x27;s minor league system, he joined the Braves for the first time as a September callup in 1998. He made his MLB debut on September 2, pinch-hitting for Greg Maddux and striking out against Randy Johnson in a 4–1 loss to the Houston Astros. On September 20, he had his first MLB hit, a pinch-hit single against Vladimir Núñez in a 10–0 win over the Arizona Diamondbacks. He appeared in five games for the Braves in 1998, serving as a shortstop, pinch hitter, and pinch runner.

In 1999, DeRosa spent most of the season as the starting shortstop for the Class AAA Richmond Braves of the International League. From June 9 through July 1, he served as a pinch hitter for Atlanta, going hitless in eight at bats while Walt Weiss was on the disabled list (DL). He was called up again on May 5, 2000, when Weiss was again placed on the DL. On May 14, he recorded his only three RBI of the season with a pinch-hit, bases-loaded double against Trever Miller in an 11–2 win over the Philadelphia Phillies. After appearing in five games, he was sent back to Richmond on May 21 when Weiss returned from the DL. He was with Atlanta again from June 13 through 29 while Rafael Furcal was on the DL, then was called up for the remainder of the season in September. In 22 games (13 at bats) for Atlanta in 2000, he batted .308 with nine runs scored and four hits.

====Filling in for Furcal (2001)====
After starting 2001 with Richmond, DeRosa was recalled on June 1, replacing pitcher Chris Seelbach on Atlanta&#x27;s roster. He filled in for Furcal for 10 games, batting .300 while Atlanta&#x27;s starting shortstop recovered from a minor injury. Then, he took over the starting role again on July 6 after Furcal suffered a season-ending shoulder injury. On July 21, he hit his first major league home run, a 10th-inning walkoff one against Graeme Lloyd that gave the Braves a 2–1 victory over the Montreal Expos. DeRosa hit well, batting .342 with 14 RBIs, but defensively he committed five errors. Wanting a better defender with more experience, the Braves acquired Rey Sánchez to be their starting shortstop at the July 31 trade deadline. However, DeRosa started a few more games at shortstop that August when Sánchez was recovering from a left hamstring injury. In 66 games (164 at bats), DeRosa batted .287 with 47 hits, three home runs, and 24 RBI.

DeRosa was part of a playoff roster for the first time as the Braves won the National League (NL) East division. He had a single against Mike Williams Game 1 of the NL Division Series (NLDS), his only appearance of the series as the Braves swept the Astros in three games. In four games (four at bats) in the NL Championship Series (NLCS), he was hitless as the Braves were defeated by Arizona in five games.

====Utility player (2002–2003)====
In 2002, DeRosa began the year as a backup player for the Braves. He had started five games in a row at shortstop for the Braves from May 13 through 17 when, in the last of those, he tore a tendon sheath in his right ankle. The injury required surgery and kept him out until July 17. Upon his return, he split time with Keith Lockhart at second base, though he also saw occasional playing time at shortstop and in left field and right field. In 72 games (212 at bats), he batted .297 with 63 hits, five home runs, and 23 RBI. He returned to the playoffs as the Braves again won the NL East. Starting at second base in Game 2 of the NLDS against the San Francisco Giants, he had two hits and two RBI in a 7–3 victory. His pinch-hit RBI single against Aaron Fultz in Game 5 provided the only Atlanta run in a 3–1 defeat that eliminated the Braves from the playoffs.

Healthy all year in 2003, DeRosa again played a number of positions: every infield spot, as well as left field and designated hitter. Of his six home runs, four came in back-to-back games: May 28 and 30 against the Cincinnati Reds and New York Mets, and September 8 and 9 against Philadelphia. On July 17, he had a walkoff bases-loaded single in the ninth inning against John Franco, giving Atlanta a 3–2 win over the Mets. In the September 8 game, he started the scoring for the Braves with a two-run home run in the first inning, then scored the go-ahead run in the fifth inning of a 6–4 win over the Phillies. In 103 games (266 at bats), he batted .263 with 70 hits, six home runs, and 22 RBI.

DeRosa made the playoffs for the third year in a row as the Braves again won the NL East championship. Starting at second base in Game 2 of the NLDS in place of Marcus Giles, who was recovering from a left leg bruise, DeRosa had an eighth-inning, two-RBI double against Dave Veres, driving in the go-ahead runs in a 5–3 victory over the Chicago Cubs. He pinch hit in three other games in the series, but the Cubs defeated the Braves in five games.

====Chance to start at third base (2004)====
When Vinny Castilla signed with the Colorado Rockies after the 2003 season, the Braves decided to make DeRosa the starting third baseman in 2004, despite him batting just .231 with no extra-base hits in spring training. On May 2, he committed four errors, tying a team record amidst a 13–4 loss to the Rockies. DeRosa said later that the poor defensive performance distracted him from his hitting for about a week. His batting average was a mere .178 in May. On June 15, DeRosa lost his starting job, as Chipper Jones moved from left field to third base, his position from 1995 through 2001. &quot;It was terrible,&quot; DeRosa said of his performance. Watching videotapes of himself and adjusting his approach to hitting, he performed better as a backup, but he remained a reserve player for the rest of the season. His season came to an end on September 25, when he tore his right anterior cruciate ligament (ACL). In 118 games (309 at bats), he batted .239 with 74 hits, three home runs, and 31 RBI. After the season, the Braves declined to offer DeRosa a contract for 2005, making him a free agent.

===Texas Rangers (2005–2006)===
On January 19, 2005, the Texas Rangers signed DeRosa to a contract, but it was only a minor league one, as the Rangers had some concerns about his health. Making it through the spring, he had his contract purchased before the start of the season, as the Rangers wanted an experienced utility infielder on their roster. The last member of the Opening Day roster to appear in a game, not making his Ranger debut until the 11th game of the season, DeRosa played only six games a month in April, May, and July, though he appeared in 12 games in June. In August and September, he saw more action in right field, as Richard Hidalgo was battling a left wrist injury. In 66 games (148 at bats), he batted .243 with 36 hits and 20 RBI. Despite appearing in his fewest games since 2001, his eight home runs represented a new career high. Still under team control at the end of the year, he avoided arbitration on December 12 by agreeing to a one-year, $675,000 contract.

After playing only two of the Rangers&#x27; first 11 games in 2006, DeRosa was on the disabled list from April 15 to 30 with a sprained left foot. With starting second baseman Ian Kinsler injured and fill-in D&#x27;Angelo Jiménez batting .208, DeRosa took over the position upon his return. He responded to the increased playing time by hitting .343, leading the Rangers in hitting in the first half of the season. On May 3, he hit a 12th-inning walkoff home run against John Halama, giving the Rangers a 2–1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles. &quot;He means a lot to our team,&quot; said manager Buck Showalter. Once Kinsler became healthy, DeRosa returned to being a utility player, but he remained a regular in Texas&#x27;s lineup, even though his position changed frequently. On August 4, DeRosa hit his first career grand slam, coming against John Lackey in a 7–3 victory over the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim. Though his average fell to .296 by season&#x27;s end, he was still one of Texas&#x27;s best players in 2006. He set career highs with 136 games played, 40 doubles, 13 home runs, and 74 RBI. After the season, he became a free agent.

===Chicago Cubs (2007–2008)===

On November 14, 2006, he signed a three-year, $13 million contract with the Chicago Cubs. DeRosa was one of several acquisitions by the Cubs in their off-season spending spree. Though the Rangers had been interested in retaining him, Chicago offered DeRosa the chance to start regularly at second base, an option that he preferred. Despite this, he again played multiple positions, though he was in the lineup regularly and second base was his most frequent position. On June 3, he hit a grand slam against Lance Cormier to open the scoring in a 10–1 victory over the Braves. Against the Reds on August 16 and September 17, he had a career-high five hits. In a career-high 149 games, DeRosa batted .293 with 147 hits, 10 home runs, and 72 RBI.

Winners of the NL Central, the Cubs faced the Diamondbacks in the NLDS. Playing second base, DeRosa batted .333 with two runs scored in the series. However, the Cubs were swept by the Diamondbacks in three games.

On February 23, 2008, DeRosa was hospitalized with breathing difficulties and a rapid heartbeat. On February 28, he had a successful catheter ablation at Northwestern Memorial Hospital to correct an irregular heartbeat, a problem which had plagued him since high school. His heart procedure earned him the nickname of &quot;the Pulse&quot;, which also became the name of his blog on the Cubs&#x27; website. On June 30, he hit a two-run home run against Barry Zito and a grand slam against Billy Sadler as the Cubs defeated the Giants 9–2. After having three RBI against the Astros on August 4, he hit a grand slam and recorded five RBI against them on August 5 in an 11–4 victory. He hit home runs in four consecutive games from August 20 through 23, becoming the first Cub to do so since Fred McGriff in 2001. In 2008, DeRosa primarily played second base, but he also filled in at third base, left field, and right field when the Cubs starters at those positions were hurt. He was the only MLB player with at least 20 appearances at four positions in 2008. Manager Lou Piniella said, &quot;The amazing part about it is he’s very adroit defensively at every position he plays&quot;. Playing 149 games for the second year in a row, he batted .285 with 143 hits, setting career highs in runs with 103, home runs with 21, and RBI with 87. Paul Hoynes of &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; called it his finest season in a January 15, 2009, article.

For the second year in a row, the Cubs won the NL Central. DeRosa&#x27;s two-run home run against Derek Lowe in Game 1 of the NLDS opened the scoring but wound up providing the only Cubs runs in a 7–2 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. He had two hits and two RBI in Game 2 but also committed an error that contributed to a five-run second inning by the Dodgers as they defeated Chicago 10–3. DeRosa hit .333 in the series, but the Cubs were swept by Los Angeles in three games, a loss that DeRosa found more disappointing than the previous year&#x27;s.

===Cleveland Indians (2009)===
On December 31, 2008, DeRosa was traded to the Cleveland Indians for minor league pitchers Jeff Stevens, Chris Archer, and John Gaub. Prior to the 2009 season, he represented the United States in the World Baseball Classic. He batted .316 and led the team with nine RBI before Japan eliminated them in the semifinals. Though third base would be his primary position for the Indians, he also spent time at first base and in the outfield. On April 18, he had six RBI in a 22–4 victory over the Yankees. From June 14 through June 16, he hit home runs in three consecutive games. He received a standing ovation from Cubs fans when he returned to Wrigley Field on June 19, even though he was now with a different team. On June 27, DeRosa was traded to the Cardinals for relief pitchers Chris Perez and Jess Todd. In 71 games (278 at bats), he was batting .270 with 75 hits, 13 home runs, and 50 RBI.

===St. Louis Cardinals (2009)===

The Cardinals hoped that the addition of DeRosa would improve their offense. Soon after his acquisition, however, he was placed on the disabled list with a left wrist sprain, an injury that kept him out from July 1 through July 17. From July 26 through 28, he hit home runs in three straight games for the second time that season. On August 4, he was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded in the 10th inning of a game against the Mets, forcing in the winning run in a 12–7 victory over New York. In 68 games (237 at bats), he batted .228 with 54 hits, 10 home runs, and 28 RBI. Defensively, he committed no errors as a Cardinal. Playing 139 games combined between Cleveland and St. Louis, he batted .250 with 129 hits, a career-high 23 home runs, and 78 RBI.

The Cardinals won the NL Central and faced the Dodgers in the NLDS. In Game 1, DeRosa had three hits, including an RBI double, but the Cardinals lost 5–3. He had two hits in Game 2 and scored a run that put the Cardinals ahead in seventh, but they ultimately lost 3–2 following an error by Matt Holliday. For the second year in a row, DeRosa&#x27;s team was swept by the Dodgers in the NLDS. DeRosa, who became a free agent at the end of the year, used the offseason to undergo surgery that sought to repair a torn tendon sheath in his left wrist. He also became a free agent.

===San Francisco Giants (2010–11)===
On December 29, 2009, DeRosa signed a two-year, $12 million contract with the Giants. At the beginning of the 2010 season, DeRosa went into a prolonged slump. He batted only .194 in his first 26 games, with just four extra base hits and 10 RBI. Experiencing numbness in the fingers of his left hand, he underwent a medical examination on May 11 and found that the wrist surgery in 2009 had been a &quot;failure&quot;. He rested it a few days to see if it would improve but was placed on the disabled list on May 17, having not played since May 8. On July 1, he underwent season-ending surgery, a procedure that again sought to repair his tendon sheath, as well as releasing pressure on his carpal tunnel. The Giants went on to win the World Series that year, their first title since 1954.

Though DeRosa suffered from mild tendinitis in his left wrist during spring training, he began the 2011 season on the Giants&#x27; roster, though just as a reserve player. He was on the disabled list from April 28 to May 10 with wrist soreness. On May 18, 2011, he completely tore the injured tendon on a checked swing and went on the disabled list again. &quot;Given his history, you have to consider that the injury might be career-ending&quot;, speculated reporter Andrew Baggarly. DeRosa instead reworked his swing to become more of a singles hitter and returned to the Giants on August 4. He was used mostly as a pinch hitter for the remainder of the season. In 47 games (86 at bats), he batted .279 with 24 hits, no home runs, and 12 RBI. After the season, he became a free agent.

===Washington Nationals (2012)===

On December 22, 2011, DeRosa signed a one-year contract with the Washington Nationals. Now 37 years old, he started at several positions for the Nationals in April 2012 but batted .081 in 13 games. On April 29, DeRosa was placed on the disabled list with a left oblique strain, an injury that kept him inactive until June 25. From then on, most of his appearances throughout the season were as a pinch hitter. He went on the disabled list again from August 5 to September 1 with a left abdominal injury. Despite DeRosa&#x27;s limited playing time, he became an important mentor for his Nationals teammates, many of whom were much younger, including former first overall draft picks Bryce Harper and Stephen Strasburg. In 48 games (85 at bats), he batted .188 with 16 hits, no home runs, and six RBI.

Though the Nationals won the NL East, DeRosa was left off their playoff roster. However, he travelled with the team during the postseason, even reading his teammates the &quot;Man in the Arena&quot; portion of a Theodore Roosevelt speech to inspire them before Game 4 of the NLDS. The Nationals were eliminated by the Cardinals in five games. After the season, DeRosa became a free agent.

===Toronto Blue Jays (2013)===
On January 22, 2013, DeRosa signed a one-year deal worth $775,000 with the Toronto Blue Jays, with a $750,000 club option for the 2014 season. Against the Astros on July 27, DeRosa hit his 100th career home run, a solo shot to lead off the second inning against Dallas Keuchel in an 8–6 loss. In August, DeRosa was placed on revocable waivers and claimed by an unnamed team on August 7, but no trade occurred, and he remained with Toronto. During the season, DeRosa was used mostly as a pinch hitter, but he also started some games at third base, second base, first base, and designated hitter. In 88 games, DeRosa hit .235 with seven home runs and 36 RBI, including hitting .286 with one home run, eight RBI, and seven walks as a pinch hitter. The Blue Jays exercised their option on DeRosa in late October, but on November 12, DeRosa informed the team that he would retire after 16 years in MLB.

==Career statistics==
DeRosa spent parts of 16 seasons in the major leagues. In 1,241 games (3,633 at bats), he batted .268 with 538 runs scored, 975 hits, 196 doubles, 12 triples, 100 home runs, and 494 RBI. Primarily a shortstop early in his career, he became a versatile utility man, ultimately making 363 appearances at third base, 343 appearances at second base, 167 appearances in right field, 120 appearances at shortstop, 90 appearances in left field, and 53 appearances at first base.

==Personal life and post-playing career==
DeRosa married former model Heidi Miller in 2002. Their daughter, Gabriella Faith, was born prematurely by two and a half months on July 28, 2003, after Heidi had spent 10 weeks in the hospital. Though Gabriella was hospitalized with tubes inserted for several weeks, she ultimately progressed to normal health. He is good friends with Jim Finn, his football teammate in high school and college. Bon Jovi is one of his favorite bands.

After retiring, DeRosa accepted a position as a studio analyst with the MLB Network. He has been the broadcast announcer for the video game franchise &quot;&quot; since replacing Harold Reynolds in &quot;MLB The Show 18&quot; until MLB The Show 21.

DeRosa was named Team USA manager for the 2023 World Baseball Classic.

<text>A standard form contract (sometimes referred to as a &quot;contract of adhesion,&quot; a &quot;leonine contract&quot;, a &quot;take-it-or-leave-it contract&quot;, or a &quot;boilerplate contract&quot;) is a contract between two parties, where the terms and conditions of the contract are set by one of the parties, and the other party has little or no ability to negotiate more favorable terms and is thus placed in a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; position.

While these types of contracts are not illegal &quot;per se&quot;, there exists a potential for unconscionability. In addition, in the event of an ambiguity, such ambiguity will be resolved &quot;contra proferentem&quot;, i.e. against the party drafting the contract language.

==Theoretical issues==
There is much debate on a theoretical level whether, and to what extent, courts should enforce standard form contracts.

On one hand, they undeniably fulfill an important role of promoting economic efficiency. Standard form contracting reduces transaction costs substantially by avoiding the need for buyers and sellers of goods and services to negotiate the details of a sale contract each time the product is sold. 

On the other hand, there is the potential for inefficient, and even unjust, terms to be accepted by signatories to these contracts. Such terms might be seen as unjust if they allow the seller to avoid all liability or unilaterally modify terms or terminate the contract. These terms often come in the form of, but are not limited to, forum selection clauses and mandatory arbitration clauses, which can limit or foreclose a party&#x27;s access to the courts; and also liquidated damages clauses, which set a limit to the amount that can be recovered or require a party to pay a specific amount. They might be inefficient if they place the risk of a negative outcome, such as defective manufacturing, on the buyer who is not in the best position to take precautions.

There are a number of reasons why such terms might be accepted:

;Standard form contracts are rarely read:Lengthy boilerplate terms are often in fine print and written in complicated legal language which often seems irrelevant. The prospect of a buyer finding any useful information from reading such terms is correspondingly low. Even if such information is discovered, the consumer is in no position to bargain as the contract is presented on a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; basis. Coupled with the often large amount of time needed to read the terms, the expected payoff from reading the contract is low and few people would be expected to read it.
;Access to the full terms may be difficult or impossible before acceptance: Often the document being signed is not the full contract; the purchaser is told that the rest of the terms are in another location. This reduces the likelihood of the terms being read and in some situations, such as software license agreements, can only be read after they have been notionally accepted by purchasing the good and opening the box. These contracts are typically not enforced, since common law dictates that &quot;all&quot; terms of a contract must be disclosed &quot;before&quot; the contract is executed.
;Boilerplate terms are not salient: The most important terms to purchasers of good are generally the price and the quality, which are generally understood before the contract of adhesion is signed. Terms relating to events that have very small probabilities of occurring or which refer to particular statutes or legal rules do not seem important to the purchaser. This further lowers the chance of such terms being read and also means they are likely to be ignored even if they are read.
;There may be social pressure to sign: Standard form contracts are signed at a point when the main details of the transaction have either been negotiated or explained. Social pressure to conclude the bargain at that point may come from a number of sources. The salesperson may imply that the purchaser is being unreasonable if they read or question the terms, saying that they are &quot;just something the lawyers want us to do&quot; or that they are wasting their time reading them. If the purchaser is at the front of a queue (for example at an airport car rental desk) there is additional pressure to sign quickly. Finally, if there has been negotiation over price or particular details, then concessions given by the salesperson may be seen as a gift which socially obliges the purchaser to respond by being co-operative and concluding the transaction.
;Standard form contracts may exploit unequal power relations: If the good which is being sold using a contract of adhesion is one which is essential or very important for the purchaser to buy (such as a rental property or a needed medical item) then the purchaser might feel they have no choice but to accept the terms. This problem may be mitigated if there are many suppliers of the good who can potentially offer different terms (see below), although even this is not always possible (for instance, a college freshman may be required to sign a standard-form dormitory rental agreement and accept its terms, because the college will not allow a freshman to live off-campus).

Some contend that in a competitive market, consumers have the ability to shop around for the supplier who offers them the most favorable terms and are consequently able to avoid injustice. However, in the case of credit cards (and other oligopolies), for example, the consumer while having the ability to shop around may still have access to only form contracts with like terms and no opportunity for negotiation. Also, as noted, many people do not read or understand the terms so there might be very little incentive for a firm to offer favorable conditions as they would gain only a small amount of business from doing so. Even if this is the case, it is argued by some that only a small percentage of buyers need to actively read standard form contracts for it to be worthwhile for firms to offer better terms if that group is able to influence a larger number of people by affecting the firm&#x27;s reputation.

Another factor that might mitigate the effects of competition on the content of contracts of adhesion is that, in practice, standard form contracts are usually drafted by lawyers instructed to construct them so as to minimize the firm&#x27;s liability, not necessarily to implement managers&#x27; competitive decisions. Sometimes the contracts are written by an industry body and distributed to firms in that industry, increasing homogeneity of the contracts and reducing consumers&#x27; ability to shop around.

==Common law status==
As a general rule, the common law treats standard form contracts like any other contract. The signature or some other objective manifestation of intent to be legally bound will bind the signor to the contract whether or not they read or understood the terms. The reality of standard form contracting, however, means that many common law jurisdictions have developed special rules with respect to them. In general, in the event of an ambiguity, the courts will interpret standard form contracts &quot;contra proferentem&quot; (against the party that drafted the contract), as that party (and only that party) had the ability to draft the contract to remove ambiguity.

===United States===
====Generally====
Standard form contracts are generally enforceable in the United States. The Uniform Commercial Code which is followed in most American states has specific provisions relating to standard form contracts for the sale or lease of goods. Furthermore, standard form contracts will be subject to special scrutiny if they are found to be contracts of adhesion.

====Contracts of adhesion====

The concept of the contract of adhesion originated in French civil law, but did not enter American jurisprudence until the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot; published an influential article by Edwin W. Patterson in 1919. It was subsequently adopted by the majority of American courts, especially after the Supreme Court of California endorsed adhesion analysis in 1962. &quot;See&quot; &quot;Steven v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty Co.&quot;, 58 Cal. 2d 862, 882 n.10 (1962) (explaining the history of the concept).

For a contract to be treated as a contract of adhesion, it must be presented on a standard form on a &quot;take it or leave it&quot; basis, and give one party no ability to negotiate because of their unequal bargaining position. The special scrutiny given to contracts of adhesion can be performed in a number of ways:

*If the term was outside of the reasonable expectations of the person who did not write the contract, and if the parties were contracting on an unequal basis, then it will not be enforceable. The reasonable expectation is assessed objectively, looking at the prominence of the term, the purpose of the term and the circumstances surrounding the acceptance of the contract.
*Section 211 of the American Law Institute&#x27;s Restatement (Second) of Contracts, which has persuasive though non-binding force in courts, provides:This is a subjective test focusing on the mind of the seller and has been adopted by only a few state courts.
*The doctrine of unconscionability is a fact-specific doctrine arising from equitable principles. Unconscionability in standard form contracts usually arises where there is an &quot;absence of meaningful choice on the part of one party due to one-sided contract provisions, together with terms which are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest person would accept them.&quot; (&quot;Fanning v. Fritz&#x27;s Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick Inc.&quot;)

====Shrink wrap contracts====
Courts in the United States have faced the issue of shrink wrap contracts in two ways. One line of cases follows &quot;ProCD v. Zeidenberg&quot; which held such contracts enforceable (e.g. &quot;Brower v Gateway&quot;), and the other follows Klocek v. Gateway, Inc, which found them unenforceable. These decisions are split on the question of assent, with the former holding that only objective manifestation of assent is required while the latter require at least the possibility of subjective assent.

===Canada===
In Canada, exclusion clauses in a standard form contract cannot be relied on where a seller knows or has reason to know a purchaser is mistaken as to its terms (&quot;Tilden Rent-A-Car Co. v. Clendenning&quot;). The Supreme Court found a standard arbitration clause requiring a gig worker to litigate before the Dutch International Chamber of Commerce void due to unconscionability in &quot;Uber Technologies Inc v Heller&quot; (2020).

===Australia===
Standard form contracts have generally received little special treatment under Australian common law. A 2003 New South Wales Court of Appeal case (&quot;Toll (FGCT) Pty Limited v Alphapharm Pty Limited&quot;) gave some support for the position that notice of exceptional terms is required for them to be incorporated. However the defendant successfully appealed to the High Court so currently there is no special treatment of standard form contracts in Australia.

Since 1 January 2011, the Australian Consumer Law has been enacted in Australia at the national level, and due to a Council of Australian Governments (COAG) agreement this legislation is now part of each jurisdiction&#x27;s (state&#x27;s or territory&#x27;s) Fair Trading laws.

===India===
In India leonine contracts are generally deemed unconscionable contracts (though not all leonine contracts are unconscionable contracts) and are voidable. The 199th Law Commission report (2006) on &quot;UNFAIR (PROCEDURAL &amp; SUBSTANTIVE) TERMS IN CONTRACT&quot; deals with it. The unfairness can be procedural or substantive. However, standard form contracts are ubiquitous in India and especially in the digital age, standard form contracts are used much more frequently than any other form. They can be legally valid if reasonable notice has been given and if the terms are not unreasonable. Unfair terms in non-negotiated agreements are often held void.

==Legislation==
In recognition of the consumer protection issues which may arise, many governments have passed specific laws relating to standard form contracts. These are generally enacted on a state level as part of general consumer protection legislation and typically allow consumers to avoid clauses that are found to be unreasonable, though the specific provisions vary greatly. Some laws require notice to be given for these clauses to be effective, others prohibit unfair clauses altogether (e.g. Victorian Fair Trading Act 1999).

===United Kingdom===
Section 3 of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 (in England and Wales) and section 17 (in relation to standard form contracts in Scotland) limit the ability of the drafter of a consumer or standard form contract to draft clauses that would allow them to exclude liability in what is termed an exclusion clause. The act does not &quot;per se&quot; render ineffective provisions in other areas which to the layman appear &quot;unfair&quot;. Where a contract has negotiated the provisions of the act likely would not apply – the law protects from a lot of things but openly making a bad bargain is not one of them. These provisions do not apply in contracts for the international sale of goods, i.e. where the parties&#x27; places of business are in the territories of different states.

===Israel===
The Standard Form Contract Act 1982 defines a set of depriving conditions that may be canceled by a court of law, including unreasonable exclusion or limitation of liability, unreasonable privileges to unilaterally cancel, suspend or postpone the execution of the contract and to change any fundamental charges or pricing, transfer of liability for the execution of the contract to a third party, unreasonable obligation to use the services of a third party or to limit, in any way, the choice of contracting third parties, denial of legal remedy, unreasonable limitations on contractual remedies or setting unreasonable conditions for the consummation of the remedy, denying or limiting the right for legal procedures, exclusive rights to decide on the location of the trial or arbitration, obligatory arbitration with unilaterally control over the arbitrators or the location of the arbitration and setting the holder of the burden of proof contrary to common law. The act also establishes a Standard Form Contract Court, chaired by a district judge and consists of a maximum of 12 members, appointed by the justice minister, including an acting chairman (also a district judge), civil servants (no more than a third) and, at least, 2 consumer organization representatives. The court holds hearings regarding appeals against standard form contract clauses or approval of a specific standard form contract at the requests of a provider.

===Lithuania===
Standard conditions in Lithuania shall be such provisions that are prepared in advance for general and repeated use by one contracting party without their content being negotiated with another party, and which are used in the formation of contracts without negotiation with the other party. Standard conditions prepared by one of the parties shall be binding to the other if the latter was provided with an adequate opportunity of getting acquainted with the said conditions (Article 6.185. Standard conditions of contracts, Lithuanian Civil Code). A consumer shall have the right to claim within the judicial procedure for invalidity of conditions in a consumer contract that are contrary to the criterion of good faith (Article 6.188).

==Civil law countries==

===Russia===
In July 2013, Russian Dmitry Agarkov won a court case against Tinkoff Bank after he altered the standard form contract he had received in the mail. The bank, failing to notice the changes, accepted the application and gave him an account based on the amended contract. The judge ruled that the bank was legally bound to the contract it had signed. Agarkov is further suing the bank for failing to comply with the terms he had added to the contract, which it had unwittingly agreed to by signing the contract. Agarkov&#x27;s lawyer, Dmitry Mihalevich said – &quot;They signed the documents without looking. They said what usually their borrowers say in court: &#x27;We have not read it&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Molisch&#x27;s test is a sensitive chemical test, named after Austrian botanist Hans Molisch, for the presence of carbohydrates, based on the dehydration of the carbohydrate by sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid to produce an aldehyde, which condenses with two molecules of a phenol (usually α-naphthol, though other phenols such as resorcinol and thymol also give colored products), resulting in a violet ring.

==Procedure==
The test solution is combined with a small amount of Molisch&#x27;s reagent (α-naphthol dissolved in ethanol) in a test tube. After mixing, a small amount of concentrated sulfuric acid is slowly added down the sides of the sloping test-tube, without mixing, to form a layer. A positive reaction is indicated by appearance of a purple red ring at the interface between the acid and test layers.

==Reaction==
All carbohydrates – monosaccharides, disaccharides, and polysaccharides (except trioses and tetroses)– should give a positive reaction, and nucleic acids and glycoproteins also give a positive reaction, as all these compounds are eventually hydrolyzed to monosaccharides by strong mineral acids. Pentoses are then dehydrated to furfural, while hexoses are dehydrated to 5-hydroxymethylfurfural. Either of these aldehydes, if present, will condense with two molecules of α-naphthol to form a purple-colored product, as illustrated below by the example of glucose:

<text>Barfoed&#x27;s test is a chemical test used for detecting the presence of monosaccharides. It is based on the reduction of copper(II) acetate to copper(I) oxide (Cu2O), which forms a brick-red precipitate.

::RCHO + 2Cu2+ + 2H2O → RCOOH + Cu2O↓ + 4H+

(Disaccharides may also react, but the reaction is much slower.) The aldehyde group of the monosaccharide which normally forms a cyclic hemiacetal is oxidized to the carboxylate. A number of other substances, including sodium chloride, may interfere.

Its author is the Danish chemist Christen Thomsen Barfoed and it is primarily used in botany.

The test is similar to the reaction of Fehling&#x27;s solution to aldehydes.

==Composition==
Barfoed&#x27;s reagent consists of a 0.33 molar solution of copper (II) acetate in 1% acetic acid solution. The reagent does not keep well and it is therefore advisable to make it up when it is actually required.

==Procedure==
1 drops of Barfoed&#x27;s reagent is added to 2 mL of given sample in a test tube and boiled for 3 minutes and then allowed to cool. If a red precipitate occurs, a monosaccharide is present.

<text>Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam (English: The Man Who Saves The World) is a 1982 Turkish science fantasy martial arts superhero adventure film directed by Çetin İnanç, and starring actor/martial artist Cüneyt Arkın. It was first released in November 1982 by Anıt Ticaret in Turkey, and later in 2005 by BijouFlix Releasing in the United States.

The film is popularly known abroad as Turkish Star Wars, due to its notorious unauthorized use of footage, music and sound effects from &quot;Star Wars&quot; and other science fiction films. The film, part of a wave of Turksploitation superhero films produced during the 1970s to early 1980s, combines science fiction themes with martial arts fantasy action, having more in common with 1970s Hong Kong martial arts films from Golden Harvest than with &quot;Star Wars&quot;.

The film was panned by critics and has often been considered one of the worst films ever made.

==Plot==
Murat and Ali crash land on an alien desert planet following a battle (shown by using footage from &quot;Star Wars&quot; and newsreel clips of Soviet and American rocket launches). While hiking across the desert, they speculate that the planet is inhabited only by women. Ali uses his &quot;irresistible&quot; wolf-whistling to lure in the imagined women, attracting the attention of a group of skeletons on horseback, which they defeat in hand-to-hand combat.

The Sorcerer appears and captures the heroes, bringing them to a gladiatorial arena. A robot resembling Robby the Robot is also shown. He tells them he is a 1,000-year-old wizard from Earth. He had tried to defeat Earth&#x27;s forces but had been repelled by a &quot;shield of concentrated human brain molecules&quot; (depicted with footage of the Death Star). The only way he can bypass it is to use a human brain against it.

The heroes escape and hide in a cave full of refugees who fled the Sorcerer&#x27;s tyrannical rule. Murat develops a romantic connection with the only woman there (Uçar), who looks after the children. (The implied romance is shown through many long eye contacts and smiles from the girl, but nothing more.) A group of Zombies and Mummies invade the cave and infect several children, their blood used to renew the Sorcerer&#x27;s immortality. The three flee the cave and find a local bar (footage of the Mos Eisley cantina lifted directly from &quot;Star Wars&quot;). The two men get into a brawl, when the Sorcerer suddenly appears and captures them again.

The Sorcerer separates the men and tries to convince them to join him. He sends his queen to seduce Ali, while he orders his robot to bring Murat before him. He offers Murat the chance to rule over the cosmos if he joins him. He possesses the power of Earth&#x27;s ancestry in the form of a golden brain, and all he needs to conquer Earth is a real human brain. After Murat declines, the Sorcerer shows that he has the woman and child in captivity. Enraged, Murat fights the Sorcerer&#x27;s monsters and skeleton guardians. A group of monsters attack Ali when he is about to kiss the queen. He defeats the monsters and joins Murat&#x27;s fight. They are both knocked out by laser-armed guards and unsuccessfully tortured by the Sorcerer, who pits Murat against a giant monster in the arena. Murat defeats the monster and flees, taking the woman and the child with him. Ali is left in captivity.

Murat finds out about a sword made by &quot;the 13th clan,&quot; who melted a mountain thousands of &quot;space years&quot; ago. Murat later finds this sword, shaped like a lightning bolt, in a cave defended by two golden ninjas. He takes the sword after dispatching the guards in an uncharacteristically short fight. Renewed by the sword&#x27;s power, Murat goes to free his friend from the Sorcerer&#x27;s dungeon. However, Ali becomes envious of the sword, knocks out Murat, and takes both the sword and the golden brain. The Sorcerer manipulates Ali into handing over the artifacts and uses them to trap him, Murat, the woman, and the child. Ali is killed in a foolish attempt to escape.

Grief-stricken, Murat melts down the golden sword and brain and forge them into a pair of gauntlets and boots. Equipped with magical gloves and super-jumping boots, he searches for the Sorcerer to avenge his friend&#x27;s death. After fighting through numerous monsters and skeletons, he comes face-to-face with his nemesis and karate chops him in half. He then leaves the planet for Earth in a ship that resembles the &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot;.

Directed by Çetin İnanç and written by Cüneyt Arkın, a well-known Turkish actor whose works span the last five decades, the film also starred Arkın in the leading role. Other actors include Aytekin Akkaya who later starred in the Italian film &quot;Sopravvissuti della città morta&quot;, as well as Hüseyin Peyda and Füsun Uçar both of whom remained in Turkey.

==Soundtrack==
The musical soundtrack is entirely lifted from popular movies. The main theme used is &quot;The Raiders March&quot;, composed by John Williams, from the 1981 film &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. Other scenes incorporated the music of &quot;Moonraker&quot;, &quot;Ben-Hur&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot;, Giorgio Moroder&#x27;s version of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;, &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot;, &quot;Silent Running&quot;, &quot;Moses&quot; and Disney&#x27;s &quot;The Black Hole&quot;. In the scene where Cüneyt Arkın and Aytekin Akkaya find the graves of old civilizations, the director selected Johann Sebastian Bach&#x27;s Toccata to play. Music from &quot;Star Wars&quot;&#x27; Academy Award winning John Williams score appears, but less extensively than footage from the film.

==Reception==
Despite initial negative reviews for its incoherent storyline, poor performances, and use of footage and music from other films, the film has since gained a significant cult following over the years and is considered to be one of the worst films ever made. Louis Proyect of &quot;Rec Arts Movie Reviews&quot; called the film &quot;classic midnight movie fun.&quot; Phil Hall of &quot;Film Threat&quot; gave the film a perfect 5 stars, calling it &quot;jaw-droppingly insane ... a film that makes criticism moot.&quot;

David Elroy Goldweber has criticized the &quot;Turkish Star Wars&quot; fan title. He notes that, while the film has science fiction themes, it is more of a martial arts fantasy film that has much more in common with 1970s Hong Kong martial arts films from Golden Harvest than it does with &quot;Star Wars&quot;. &quot;BBC News&quot; notes that &quot;Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam&quot; was part of a wave of low-budget Turkish superhero films produced during the 1970s to early 1980s.

==Sequel==
After many attempts to gather the original actors in the film to create a sequel to &quot;The Man Who Saved the World&quot;, a follow-up, &quot;The Son of the Man Who Saved the World&quot; (&quot;Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam&#x27;ın Oğlu&quot;), commonly known as &quot;Turks in Space&quot;, was shot in 2006.

The sequel was released on 15 December 2006. Some fans expressed their disapproval that the special effects were not similar to the original film, where all the space scenes were ripped directly from science fiction titles of the time, such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, the &quot;Star Trek&quot; series, and &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot;. Famous actors from Turkey, such as Mehmet Ali Erbil took part, and Kartal Tibet directed.

=== Alternate sequel ===
Çetin İnanç proposed his own ideas for a much grander sequel, involving the creation of &quot;zombie ninja space warriors,&quot; and the abduction of the Turkish and American presidents by aliens, and a journey to a planet that is on the other side of a black hole. According to İnanç, it &quot;pits God against the Devil in an epic war for Earth.&quot;

==Revivals==
Foleyvision, an Austin, Texas-based comedy troupe who showed films replacing the original soundtrack with new dialogue, music, and sound-effects live in the theatre, used &quot;Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam&quot; as one of their performances in 2004, providing what troupe leader Buzz Moran said was &quot;the first English translation of this film ever in the world.&quot; During the introduction to the show, Moran stated that the translator had told them that &quot;It doesn&#x27;t make any more sense in Turkish.&quot;

Filmusik, a Portland, Oregon-based collaborative performance group, similarly screened &quot;Turkish Star Wars&quot; with live voiceovers, music, and sound effects in late 2012.

== Restoration ==
In 2016, film historian Ed Glaser purchased the only known surviving 35mm print of the film from a retired projectionist. As a result, the film received a 2K scan whose quality far surpassed any previously available copy (until then, the film had only been available in versions sourced from a poor quality videotape). Glaser&#x27;s restoration went on to receive a limited theatrical release in the United Kingdom in 2018. This restoration received a limited Blu-ray release from Big Bosphorus Media, being sold from 1 to 31 October 2021.
