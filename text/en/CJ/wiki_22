<text>SMS was a battlecruiser of the German (Imperial Navy), built in Hamburg. She was ordered in 1910 and commissioned in May 1913, the fourth battlecruiser built for the High Seas Fleet. She was named after Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, a Prussian general during the reign of King Frederick the Great and the Seven Years&#x27; War. represented the culmination of the first generation of German battlecruisers, which had started with the in 1906 and continued with the pair of s ordered in 1907 and 1908. featured several incremental improvements over the preceding designs, including a redesigned propulsion system and an improved armor layout. The ship was also significantly larger than her predecessors—at , she was approximately 3,000 metric tons heavier than the -class ships.

 participated in many of the large fleet actions during World War I, including the battles of Dogger Bank and Jutland in the North Sea. The ship suffered severe damage during both engagements; during the Battle of Dogger Bank, a 13.5 in (34.3 cm) shell from the British battlecruiser struck ″s rearmost turret and nearly caused a magazine explosion that could have destroyed the ship. At the Battle of Jutland she was hit twenty-one times by large-caliber shells, one of which penetrated the working chamber of the aft superfiring turret. Although the resulting fire destroyed the turret, the safety measures imposed after the battle of Dogger Bank prevented a catastrophe. The ship was also hit by a torpedo during the battle, causing her to take in over 5,300 metric tons of water and her freeboard was reduced to 2.5 m. She had to be lightened significantly to permit her crossing of the Jade Bar. The ship inflicted severe damage on her British opponents as well; early in the battle, salvos from both and the battlecruiser destroyed the battlecruiser in seconds.

 saw limited action in the Baltic Sea, when she provided screening for the German flotilla that at Battle of the Gulf of Riga attempted to clear the gulf in 1915. As with the rest of the German battlecruisers that survived the war, the ship was interned in Scapa Flow in 1918. The ship, along with the rest of the High Seas Fleet, was scuttled in June 1919, to prevent her seizure by the British Royal Navy. She was raised on 2 November 1928 and scrapped by 1930 in Rosyth.

== Development ==
Despite the success of the previous German battlecruiser designs—those of and the —there was still significant debate as to how new ships of the type were to be designed. In 1909, the (Navy Department) requested Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz, the State Secretary for the navy, to provide them with the improvements that would be necessary for the next battlecruiser design. Tirpitz continued to push for the use of battlecruisers solely as fleet scouts and to destroy enemy cruisers, along the lines of the battlecruisers employed by the British Royal Navy; this meant larger guns, higher speeds, and less armor protection. Kaiser Wilhelm II and the majority of the Navy Department argued that due to Germany&#x27;s numerical inferiority compared to the Royal Navy, the ships would also have to fight in the line of battle. This necessitated much heavier armor protection than that afforded to the Royal Navy&#x27;s battlecruiser designs. Ultimately, the Kaiser and the Navy Department won the debate, and the battlecruiser for the 1909–1910 building year would continue in the pattern of the previous and -class designs.

Financial constraints meant that there would have to be a trade-off between speed, battle capabilities, and displacement. The initial design specifications mandated that speed was to have been at least as high as with the class, and that the ship was to have been armed with either eight guns or ten guns. The design staff considered three-gun turrets, but these were discarded when it was decided that the standard 28 cm twin turret was sufficient.

In August 1909, the (Imperial Diet) stated that it would tolerate no increases in cost over the -class battlecruisers, and so for a time, the Navy Department considered shelving the new design and instead to build a third -class ship. Tirpitz was able to negotiate a discount on armor plate from both Krupp and Dillingen; Tirpitz also pressured the ship&#x27;s builder, Blohm &amp; Voss, for a discount. These cost reductions freed up sufficient funds to make some material improvements to the design. On 27 January 1910, the Kaiser approved the design for the new ship, ordered under the provisional name &quot;Cruiser J&quot;.

== Design ==
=== General characteristics ===
 was long at the waterline, and overall. The ship had a beam of , which was increased to with anti-torpedo nets equipped. She had a draft of forward and aft. displaced as designed, which increased to at full load. had a double bottom for 76 percent of the length of the hull.

The ship carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, three barges, two launches, two yawls, and two dinghies. was described as having been a good sea boat with gentle motion. The ship lost up to 60 percent of her speed at a hard rudder, and would heel over to 9 degrees. The ship had a standard complement of 43 officers and 1025 men, and when serving as the flagship of I Scouting Group, this increased by an additional 13 officers and 62 men.

=== Propulsion ===
 was propelled by four Parsons direct-drive steam turbines that were arranged in two sets. Each set consisted of a high-pressure outboard turbine which exhausted into a low-pressure inboard turbine. Each turbine drove a 3-bladed screw propeller that was in diameter. Steam for the turbines was provided by twenty-seven small-tube Schulz-Thornycroft boilers that had two fire boxes per boiler. The boilers were divided into three boiler rooms, and they were ducted into a pair of widely spaced funnels. Electrical power was provided by six turbo generators that produced 1,800 kW at 220 V.

The engines were designed to produce and a top speed of . Using forced draft on trials, the engines provided up to and a top speed of . The ship carried up to of coal. With full fuel stores, could steam at a cruising speed of for . Steering was controlled by a pair of side-by-side rudders.

=== Armament ===
 mounted a nearly identical main battery to that of the preceding -class ships: ten SK L/50 guns in five twin-gun turrets. The guns were arranged similarly as well, with one turret fore, two staggered wing turrets amidships, and two super-firing turrets aft. They were placed in newer Drh. L C/1910 mountings, which enabled depression of the guns down to −8 degrees and elevation to 13.5 degrees—the same range of motion of the earlier Drh. L C/1908 turrets. At 13.5 degrees, the guns could be fired to . In 1916, had her main turrets modified to allow for elevation up to 16 degrees, for a maximum range of . Each turret was equipped with a rangefinder, apart from the rear turret, and an additional 3 m rangefinder was fitted in the gunnery control tower, which was located directly aft of the conning tower. The main battery was supplied with 87 armor-piercing rounds per gun, for a total of 870 shells. In addition to the shell, each gun chambered a fore propellant charge in a silk bag and a main charge in a brass case. The guns fired the shells at a muzzle velocity of . The guns were hand-rammed, which required the barrels to be returned to 0 degrees elevation for reloading. Training and elevation was controlled hydraulically.

 carried a similar secondary battery to the preceding -class design. She mounted twelve SK L/45 quick-firing guns in single casemates along the center of the ship. These guns fired armor-piercing shells at a rate of 4 to 5 per minute. The guns could depress to −7 degrees and elevate to 20 degrees, for a maximum range of , and after the 1916 refit, the range was extended to . The shells weighed and were fired at a muzzle velocity of . The guns were manually elevated and trained.

For defense against torpedo boats, the ship was also armed with twelve SK L/45 quick-firing guns, which were mounted in casemates as well. These guns fired at a muzzle velocity of 590 mps (1,936 fps). Their rate of fire was approximately 15 shells per minute; the guns could engage targets out to . The gun mounts were manually operated. Two of these guns were removed in 1916 and replaced with high-angle 8.8 cm Flak L/45 anti-aircraft guns.

As was customary for all German capital ships of the time, was equipped with four submerged torpedo tubes. The ship mounted one tube in the bow, one in the stern, and one was on each side of the vessel. The weapons were in diameter, and a total of eleven torpedoes were stored. She was initially equipped with the G6 version, which carried a warhead and could be set at two speeds for different ranges. At , the torpedoes could reach and at , the range fell to . These were replaced beginning in 1913 by the G7 type, which carried a warhead. Their range increased significantly, to at 27 knots and at .

=== Armor ===
As was standard for German warships of the period, used Krupp cemented and nickel steel for her armor plating. The ship had an armored belt that was thick at its strongest area in the citadel, and tapered down to in the bow and stern. The main belt was reinforced by a torpedo bulkhead that was thick. The forward conning tower had of armor on the sides, and a thick roof. The turrets were protected by on the sides and armor ranging in thickness from on the turret roofs. The casemates had lighter armor protection, with on the sides and roofs. The deck armor ranged in thickness, depending on the area being protected. In the more vital areas, the deck armor was thick, while less important areas of the ship were covered by only . A 50 mm belt of sloping armor was placed under the main deck armor. The turret barbettes were protected by plating thick. The portions of the barbettes that were behind the main belt were thinner to save weight, which was a practice employed on most German and British ships of the period.

== Service history ==
 was launched on 30 March 1912, and was christened by Karl Wilhelm Heinrich von Kleist. On 22 May 1913 the ship was commissioned into the German fleet, her crew being taken from the old armored cruiser , which had been recently transferred to the reserve fleet. After sea trials, joined the rest of the High Seas Fleet for maneuvers off Helgoland. (Rear Admiral) Franz von Hipper, the commander of I Scouting Group, raised his flag in the ship on 23 June 1914. The ship served as Hipper&#x27;s flagship until 26 October 1917.

=== World War I ===

==== Battle of Heligoland Bight ====
Shortly after the outbreak of World War I, a brief engagement between German light cruisers and a raiding force of British cruisers and battlecruisers took place on 28 August 1914. During the morning, British cruisers from the Harwich Force attacked the German destroyers patrolling the Heligoland Bight. Six German light cruisers—, , , , , and —responded to the attack and inflicted serious damage to the British raiders. The arrival at approximately 13:37 of the British 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, under the command of Vice Admiral David Beatty, quickly put the German ships at a disadvantage.

Along with the rest of the I Scouting Group battlecruisers, was stationed in the Wilhelmshaven Roads on the morning of the battle. By 08:50, Hipper had requested permission from Admiral Friedrich von Ingenohl, the commander in chief of the High Seas Fleet, to send his ships to relieve the beleaguered German cruisers. The battlecruisers and were ready to sail by 12:10, but the low tide prevented the ships from being able to pass over the sand bar at the mouth of the Jade Estuary safely. At 14:10, and were able to cross the Jade bar; Hipper ordered the German light cruisers to fall back to his ships, while Hipper himself was about an hour behind in . At 14:25, the remaining light cruisers—, , , , and —rendezvoused with the battlecruisers. arrived on the scene by 15:10, while succumbed to battle damage and sank. Hipper ventured forth cautiously to search for the two missing light cruisers, and , which had already sunk. By 16:00, the German flotilla turned around to return to the Jade Estuary, arriving at approximately 20:23.

==== Bombardment of Yarmouth ====

On 2 November 1914, , followed by , , and the armored cruiser , along with four light cruisers, left the Jade Estuary and steamed towards the English coast. The flotilla arrived off Great Yarmouth at daybreak the following morning and bombarded the port, while the light cruiser laid a minefield. The British submarine responded to the bombardment, but struck one of the mines laid by and sank. Shortly thereafter, Hipper ordered his ships to turn back to German waters. While Hipper&#x27;s ships were returning to German waters, a heavy fog covered the Heligoland Bight, so the ships were ordered to halt until visibility improved so they could safely navigate the defensive minefields. The armored cruiser made a navigational error that led the ship into one of the German minefields. struck two mines and quickly sank; the coastal defense ship was able to save 127 men of the crew.

==== Bombardment of Scarborough, Hartlepool, and Whitby ====
Ingenohl decided that another raid on the English coast should be carried out in the hopes of luring a portion of the Grand Fleet into combat where it could be destroyed. At 03:20 on 15 December, , , , the new battlecruiser , and , along with the light cruisers , , , and , and two squadrons of torpedo boats left the Jade. The ships sailed north past the island of Heligoland, until they reached the Horns Reef lighthouse, at which point the ships turned west towards Scarborough. Twelve hours after Hipper left the Jade, the High Seas Fleet, consisting of 14 dreadnoughts and 8 pre-dreadnoughts and a screening force of 2 armored cruisers, 7 light cruisers, and 54 torpedo boats, departed to provide distant cover.

On 26 August 1914, the German light cruiser had run aground in the Gulf of Finland; the wreck was captured by the Russian navy, which found code books used by the German navy, along with navigational charts for the North Sea. These documents were then passed on to the Royal Navy. Room 40 began decrypting German signals, and on 14 December, intercepted messages relating to the plan to bombard Scarborough. The exact details of the plan were unknown, and it was assumed that the High Seas Fleet would remain safely in port, as in the previous bombardment. Beatty&#x27;s four battlecruisers, supported by the 3rd Cruiser Squadron and the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron, along with the 2nd Battle Squadron&#x27;s six dreadnoughts, were to ambush Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers.

During the night of 15 December, the main body of the High Seas Fleet encountered British destroyers. Fearing the prospect of a nighttime torpedo attack, Ingenohl ordered the ships to retreat. Hipper was unaware of Ingenohl&#x27;s reversal, and so he continued with the bombardment. Upon reaching the British coast, Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers split into two groups. , , and went north to shell Hartlepool, while and went south to shell Scarborough and Whitby. During the bombardment of Hartlepool, was hit three times and was hit six times by the coastal battery. suffered only minimal damage, and no casualties. By 09:45 on the 16th, the two groups had reassembled, and they began to retreat eastward.

By this time, Beatty&#x27;s battlecruisers were in position to block Hipper&#x27;s chosen egress route, while other forces were en route to complete the encirclement. At 12:25, the light cruisers of II Scouting Group began to pass through the British forces searching for Hipper. One of the cruisers in the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron spotted and signaled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers towards the German ships. Beatty presumed that the German cruisers were the advance screen for Hipper&#x27;s ships, but the battlecruisers were some ahead. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty&#x27;s ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the northeast of the British forces and made good their escape.

Both the British and the Germans were disappointed that they failed to effectively engage their opponents. Ingenohl&#x27;s reputation suffered greatly as a result of his timidity. The captain of was furious; he stated that Ingenohl had turned back &quot;because he was afraid of eleven British destroyers which could have been eliminated ... under the present leadership we will accomplish nothing.&quot; The official German history criticized Ingenohl for failing to use his light forces to determine the size of the British fleet, stating: &quot;He decided on a measure which not only seriously jeopardized his advance forces off the English coast but also deprived the German Fleet of a signal and certain victory.&quot;

==== Battle of Dogger Bank ====

In early January 1915, it became known that British ships were conducting reconnaissance in the Dogger Bank area. Ingenohl was initially reluctant to attempt to destroy these forces, because I Scouting Group was temporarily weakened while was in drydock for periodic maintenance. Richard Eckermann, the Chief of Staff of the High Seas Fleet, insisted on the operation, and so Ingenohl relented and ordered Hipper to take his battlecruisers to the Dogger Bank. On 23 January, Hipper sortied, with in the lead, followed by , , and , along with the light cruisers , , , and and 19 torpedo boats from V Flotilla and II and XVIII Half-Flotillas. and were assigned to the forward screen, while and were assigned to the starboard and port, respectively. Each light cruiser had a half-flotilla of torpedo boats attached.

Again, interception and decryption of German wireless signals played an important role. Although they were unaware of the exact plans, the cryptographers of Room 40 were able to deduce that Hipper would be conducting an operation in the Dogger Bank area. To counter it, Beatty&#x27;s 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, Rear Admiral Archibald Moore&#x27;s 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron and Commodore William Goodenough&#x27;s 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron were to rendezvous with Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt&#x27;s Harwich Force at 8:00 on 24 January, approximately north of the Dogger Bank. At 08:14, spotted the light cruiser and several destroyers from the Harwich Force. &quot;Aurora&quot; challenged with a search light, at which point attacked &quot;Aurora&quot; and scored two hits. &quot;Aurora&quot; returned fire and scored two hits on in retaliation. Hipper immediately turned his battlecruisers towards the gunfire, when, almost simultaneously, spotted a large amount of smoke to the northwest of her position. This was identified as a number of large British warships steaming towards Hipper&#x27;s ships.

Hipper turned south to flee, but was limited to , which was the maximum speed of the older armored cruiser . The pursuing British battlecruisers were steaming at , and quickly caught up to the German ships. At 09:52, opened fire on from a range of approximately ; shortly thereafter, and began firing as well. At 10:09, the British guns made their first hit on . Two minutes later, the German ships began returning fire, primarily concentrating on &quot;Lion&quot;, from a range of . At 10:28, &quot;Lion&quot; was struck on the waterline, which tore a hole in the side of the ship and flooded a coal bunker. At 10:30, , the fourth ship in Beatty&#x27;s line, came within range of and opened fire. By 10:35, the range had closed to , at which point the entire German line was within the effective range of the British ships. Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to engage their German counterparts. Confusion aboard &quot;Tiger&quot; led the captain to believe he was to fire on , which left able to fire without distraction.
 was struck in her forecastle at 10:25, by a shell from &quot;Lion&quot;, but this hit did minor damage. At 10:40, &quot;Lion&quot; hit with another 13.5 in shell, which holed the deck and penetrated the rear barbette. The shell itself failed to enter the barbette, but the explosion flashed into the working chamber and detonated the propellant charges inside.

The explosion killed 159 men, and destroyed both of the rear turrets. The fire was prevented from spreading to the shell magazines, which could have destroyed the ship, by the quick action of the executive officer, who ordered both magazines be flooded. The Wilhelm Heidkamp was severely injured when he turned the red-hot valves to flood the magazines. At 11:01, struck back at &quot;Lion&quot;, and with a single 28 cm shell, knocked out two of &quot;Lion&quot;″s engines. Shortly thereafter, a pair of 30.5 cm shells fired by &quot;Derfflinger&quot; struck &quot;Lion&quot;, one at the waterline. The penetration allowed water to enter the port feed tank—this hit eventually crippled &quot;Lion&quot;, the sea water contamination forced the ship&#x27;s crew to shut down the port engine. At 11:25, was struck on her armored belt amidships by a third and final shell, which did little damage.

By this time, was severely damaged after having been pounded by heavy shells. The chase ended when there were several reports of U-boats ahead of the British ships; Beatty quickly ordered evasive maneuvers, which allowed the German ships to increase the distance to their pursuers. At this time, &quot;Lion&quot;″s last operational dynamo failed, which dropped her speed to . Beatty, in the stricken &quot;Lion&quot;, ordered the remaining battlecruisers to &quot;Engage the enemy&#x27;s rear,&quot; but signal confusion caused the ships to solely target , allowing , , and to escape. By the time Beatty regained control over his ships, after having boarded &quot;Princess Royal&quot;, the German ships had increased their lead to a distance too great for the British to reengage; at 13:50, he broke off the chase. was repaired at the (Imperial Shipyard) in Wilhelmshaven from 25 January to 31 March 1915, after which she rejoined the fleet.

==== Battle of the Gulf of Riga ====
On 3 August 1915, , , and were transferred to the Baltic with I Reconnaissance Group (AG) to participate in a planned foray into the Riga Gulf. The intention was to destroy the Russian naval forces in the area, including the pre-dreadnought , and to use the minelayer to block the entrance to Moon Sound with naval mines. The German forces, under the command of Hipper, included the four and four s, the battlecruisers , , and , and a number of smaller craft. Throughout the operation, and the other two battlecruisers remained in the Baltic and provided cover for the assault into the Gulf of Riga.

Following the operation, and the other heavy units of the High Seas Fleet returned to the North Sea. On 11–12 September, and the rest of I Scouting Group covered a minefield laying operation off Terschelling. On 24 November, the ship ran aground in the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, but was quickly refloated. On 4 December, while exiting the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal, became entangled in one of the net barriers. Divers had to remove the tangled nets from the starboard screws.

==== Bombardment of Yarmouth and Lowestoft ====


On 24–25 April 1916, I Scouting Group undertook another operation to bombard the English coast, this time, the towns of Yarmouth and Lowestoft. Hipper was on sick leave, so the German ships were under the command of Friedrich Boedicker, who flew his flag in . The German battlecruisers , , , and left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 on 24 April, and were supported by a screening force of 6 light cruisers and two torpedo boat flotillas. The heavy units of the High Seas Fleet sailed at 13:40, with the objective to provide distant support for Boedicker&#x27;s ships. The British Admiralty was made aware of the German sortie through the interception of German wireless signals, and deployed the Grand Fleet at 15:50.

By 14:00, Boedicker&#x27;s ships had reached a position off Norderney, at which point he turned his ships northward to avoid the Dutch observers on the island of Terschelling. At 15:38, struck a mine, which tore a 15 m (50-foot) hole in her hull, just abaft of the starboard broadside torpedo tube. Eleven men were killed and of water entered the ship. The ship&#x27;s draft increased at the bow of the ship. turned back with the screen of light cruisers at a speed of . The four remaining battlecruisers turned south immediately in the direction of Norderney to avoid further mine damage. By 16:00, was clear of imminent danger, so the ship stopped to allow Boedicker to disembark. The torpedo boat brought Boedicker to , and the operation continued as planned. After Boedicker departed the ship, , escorted by a pair of torpedo boats, withdrew southward to the Jade. She was out of service for over a month for repair work due to the mine damage.

==== Battle of Jutland ====

=====Deployment=====
Almost immediately after the Lowestoft raid, (Vice Admiral) Reinhard Scheer began planning another foray into the North Sea. He had initially intended to launch the operation in mid-May, but the mine damage to had proved difficult to repair—Scheer was unwilling to embark on a major raid without his battlecruiser forces at full strength. On 22 May, the Wilhelmshaven dockyard reported the ship to be fit for duty, but tests carried out that night showed that the broadside torpedo flat that had been damaged by the mine was still not watertight, and there were still leaks in the fore and aft transverse bulkheads. Further repairs were necessary, and so the operation was postponed another week, by which time the Wilhelmshaven dockyard assured Scheer that the ship would be ready. At noon on 28 May, the repairs to were finally completed, and the ship returned to I Scouting Group.

On the night of 30 May 1916, and the other four battlecruisers of I Scouting Group lay in anchor in the Jade roadstead. The following morning, at 02:00 CET, the ships slowly steamed out towards the Skagerrak at a speed of . By this time, Hipper had transferred his flag from to the newer battlecruiser . took her place in the center of the line, to the rear of and ahead of . II Scouting Group, consisting of the light cruisers , Boedicker&#x27;s flagship, , , and , and 30 torpedo boats of II, VI, and IX Flotillas, accompanied Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers.

An hour and a half later, the High Seas Fleet under the command of Scheer left the Jade; the force was composed of 16 dreadnoughts. The High Seas Fleet was accompanied by IV Scouting Group, composed of the light cruisers , , , , and , and 31 torpedo boats of I, III, V, and VII Flotillas, led by the light cruiser . The six pre-dreadnoughts of II Battle Squadron had departed from the Elbe roads at 02:45, and rendezvoused with the battle fleet at 5:00.

=====Run to the south=====
Shortly before 16:00, Hipper&#x27;s force encountered Beatty&#x27;s battlecruiser squadron. The German ships were the first to open fire, at a range of approximately . The British rangefinders had misread the range to their German targets, and so the first salvos fired by the British ships fell a mile past the German battlecruisers. As the two lines of battlecruisers deployed to engage each other, began to duel with her opposite in the British line, &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. By 16:54, the range between the ships decreased to , which enabled ″s secondary battery to enter the fray. She was close enough to the ships of the British 9th and 10th Destroyer Flotillas that her secondary guns could effectively engage them. The other four German battlecruisers employed their secondary battery against the British battlecruisers.

Between 16:55 and 16:57, was struck by two heavy caliber shells from &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. The first shell penetrated the side of the ship five feet above the main battery deck, and caused a number of small fires. The second shell penetrated the barbette of the aft superfiring turret. Four propellant charges were ignited in the working chamber; the resulting fire flashed up into the turret and down to the magazine. The anti-flash precautions that had been put in place after the explosion at Dogger Bank prevented any further propellant explosions. Regardless, the turret was destroyed and most of the gun crew had been killed in the blaze.

By 17:25, the British battlecruisers were taking a severe battering from their German opponents. had been destroyed by a salvo from approximately 20 minutes before, and Beatty sought to turn his ships away by 2 points in order to regroup, while the s of the 5th Battle Squadron arrived on the scene and provided covering fire. As the British battlecruisers began to turn away, and were able to concentrate their fire on &quot;Queen Mary&quot;. Witnesses reported at least 5 shells from two salvos hit the ship, which caused an intense explosion that ripped the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; in half. Shortly after the destruction of &quot;Queen Mary&quot;, both British and German destroyers attempted to make torpedo attacks on the opposing lines. One British torpedo struck at 17:57. The torpedo hit the ship directly below the fore turret, slightly aft of where she had been mined the month before. The explosion tore a hole 40 feet long by 13 feet wide (12 m × 4.0 m), and caused a slight list. Despite the damage, the ship was still able to maintain her top speed, and kept position in the line.

The leading ships of the German battle fleet had by 18:00 come within effective range of the British ships, and had begun trading shots with the British battlecruisers and &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot;-class battleships. Between 18:09 and 18:19, was hit by a shell from either or . This shell struck the face of the port wing turret and disabled the guns. A second 380 mm shell penetrated the already disabled aft superfiring turret and detonated the cordite charges that had not already burned. The ship also had two of her 150 mm guns disabled from British gunfire, and the rear turret lost its right-hand gun.

As the evening wore on, visibility steadily decreased for the German ships. ″s commander, Moritz von Egidy, later remarked:

=====Battlefleets engage=====
At around 19:00, Beatty&#x27;s forces were nearing the main body of the Grand Fleet, and to delay the discovery of the Grand Fleet&#x27;s location by the German fleet, he turned his ships towards the German line, in order to force them to turn as well. This reduced the distance between the British and German battlecruisers from . Visibility continued to favor the British, and the German battlecruisers paid the price. Over the next several minutes, was hit six times, primarily on the forward section of the ship. A fire started under the ship&#x27;s forecastle. The smothering fire from Beatty&#x27;s ships forced Hipper to temporarily withdraw his battlecruisers to the southwest. As the ships withdrew, began taking on more water, and the list to starboard worsened. The ship was thoroughly flooded above the middle deck in the fore compartments, and had nearly lost all buoyancy.

By 19:30, the High Seas Fleet, which was by that point pursuing the British battlecruisers, had not yet encountered the Grand Fleet. Scheer had been considering retiring his forces before darkness exposed his ships to torpedo boat attack. He had not yet made a decision when his leading battleships encountered the main body of the Grand Fleet. This development made it impossible for Scheer to retreat, for doing so would have sacrificed the slower pre-dreadnought battleships of II Battle Squadron, while using his dreadnoughts and battlecruisers to cover their retreat would have subjected his strongest ships to overwhelming British fire. Instead, Scheer ordered his ships to turn 16 points to starboard, which would bring the pre-dreadnoughts to the relative safety of the disengaged side of the German battle line.

 and the other battlecruisers followed the move, which put them astern of . Hipper&#x27;s badly battered ships gained a temporary moment of respite, and uncertainty over the exact location and course of Scheer&#x27;s ships led Admiral Jellicoe to turn his ships eastward, towards what he thought was the likely path of the German retreat. The German fleet was instead sailing west, but Scheer ordered a second 16-point turn, which reversed course and pointed his ships at the center of the British fleet. The German fleet came under intense fire from the British line, and Scheer sent , , , and at high speed towards the British fleet, in an attempt to disrupt their formation and gain time for his main force to retreat. By 20:17, the German battlecruisers had closed to within of , at which point Scheer directed the ships to engage the lead ship of the British line. managed to hit &quot;Colossus&quot; once, but caused only minor damage to the ship&#x27;s superstructure. Three minutes later, the German battlecruisers turned in retreat, covered by a torpedo boat attack.

=====Withdrawal=====
A pause in the battle at dusk allowed and the other German battlecruisers to cut away wreckage that interfered with the main guns, extinguish fires, repair the fire control and signal equipment, and ready the searchlights for nighttime action. During this period, the German fleet reorganized into a well-ordered formation in reverse order, when the German light forces encountered the British screen shortly after 21:00. The renewed gunfire gained Beatty&#x27;s attention, so he turned his battlecruisers westward. At 21:09, he sighted the German battlecruisers, and drew to within before opening fire at 20:20. In the ensuing melee, was hit several times; one shell struck the rear gun turret and other hit the ship&#x27;s bridge. The entire bridge crew was killed and several men in the conning tower were wounded. The German ships returned fire with every gun available, and at 21:32 hit both &quot;Lion&quot; and &quot;Princess Royal&quot; in the darkness. The maneuvering of the German battlecruisers forced the leading I Battle Squadron to turn westward to avoid collision. This brought the pre-dreadnoughts of II Battle Squadron directly behind the battlecruisers, and prevented the British ships from pursuing the German battlecruisers when they turned southward. The British battlecruisers opened fire on the old battleships; the German ships turned southwest to bring all of their guns to bear against the British ships.

By 22:15, Hipper was finally able to transfer to , and then ordered his ships to steam at towards the head of the German line. Only and were in condition to comply; and could make at most , and so these ships lagged behind. and were in the process of steaming to the front of the line when the ships passed close to , which forced the ship to drastically slow down to avoid collision. This forced , , and to turn to port, which led them into contact with the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron; at a range of , the cruisers on both sides pummeled each other. Ludwig von Reuter decided to attempt to lure the British cruisers towards and . Nearly simultaneously, the heavily damaged British cruisers broke off the attack. As the light cruisers were disengaging, a torpedo fired by struck , and the ship exploded. The German formation fell into disarray, and in the confusion, lost sight of . The ship was no longer able to keep up with ″s 22 knots, and so detached herself to proceed to the Horns Reef lighthouse independently.

At 00:45, was attempting to thread her way through the British fleet, but was sighted by the dreadnought and noted as a &quot;ship or Destroyer&quot;. &quot;Agincourt&quot;″s captain did not want to risk giving away his ship&#x27;s position, and so allowed her to pass. By 01:12, had managed to slip through the British fleet, and she was able to head for the safety of Horns Reef. At approximately 03:40, she scraped over Horns Reef. Both of the ship&#x27;s gyro-compasses had failed, so the light cruiser was sent to guide the ship home. By 15:30 on 1 June, was in critical condition; the bow was nearly completely submerged, and the only buoyancy that remained in the forward section of the ship was the broadside torpedo room. Preparations were being made to evacuate the wounded crew when a pair of pump steamers arrived on the scene. The ships were able to stabilize ″s flooding, and the ship managed to limp back to port. She reached the outer Jade river on the morning of 2 June, and on 3 June the ship entered Entrance III of the Wilhelmshaven Lock. At most, had been flooded by of water.

Close to the end of the battle, at 03:55, Hipper transmitted a report to Scheer informing him of the tremendous damage his ships had suffered. By that time, and each had only two guns in operation, was flooded with 1,000 tons of water, and was severely damaged. Hipper reported: &quot;I Scouting Group was therefore no longer of any value for a serious engagement, and was consequently directed to return to harbor by the Commander-in-Chief, while he himself determined to await developments off Horns Reef with the battlefleet.&quot; In the course of the battle, was hit 21 times by heavy-caliber shells, twice by secondary battery shells, and once by a torpedo. The ship suffered a total of 98 of her crew killed and 55 wounded. herself fired 376 main battery shells and scored approximately 10 hits.

==== Later operations ====
On 15 June 1916, repair work to began in the Imperial Dockyard in Wilhelmshaven, and continued until 1 October. The ship then underwent individual training, and rejoined the fleet in November. With his previous flagship at the bottom of the North Sea, Hipper again raised his flag in . On 4 November, and , along with II Division, I Battle Squadron, III Battle Squadron, and the new battleship sailed to Bovbjerg on the Danish coast, in order to retrieve the stranded U-boats and .

Scheer had begun to use light surface forces to attack British convoys to Norway beginning in late 1917. As a result, the Royal Navy attached a squadron of battleships to protect the convoys, which presented Scheer with the possibility of destroying a detached squadron of the Grand Fleet. Scheer remarked that &quot;A successful attack on such a convoy would not only result in the sinking of much tonnage, but would be a great military success, and would ... force the English to send more warships to the northern waters.&quot; Scheer instituted strict wireless silence in preparation for the planned attack. This denied the British the ability to intercept and decrypt German signals, which had previously been a significant advantage. The operation called for Hipper&#x27;s battlecruisers to attack the convoy and its escorts on 23 April while the battleships of the High Seas Fleet stood by in support. At 05:00 on 23 April 1918, the High Seas Fleet left harbor with the intention of intercepting one of the heavily escorted convoys.

Hipper&#x27;s forces were west of Egerö, Norway, by 05:20 on 24 April. Despite the success in reaching the convoy route undetected, the operation failed due to faulty intelligence. Reports from U-boats indicated to Scheer that the convoys sailed at the start and middle of each week, but a west-bound convoy had left Bergen on Tuesday the 22nd and an east-bound group left Methil, Scotland, on the 24th, a Thursday. As a result, there was no convoy for Hipper to attack. The same day, one of screws slipped off, which caused serious damage to the power plant and allowed of water into the ship. was forced to break radio silence in order to inform Scheer of the ship&#x27;s condition, which alerted the Royal Navy to the High Seas Fleet&#x27;s activities. Beatty sortied with a force of 31 battleships and four battlecruisers, but was too late to intercept the retreating Germans. The Germans reached their defensive minefields early on 25 April, though approximately off Helgoland was torpedoed by the submarine , though she successfully returned to port.

=== Fate ===

 was to have taken part in what would have amounted to the &quot;death ride&quot; of the High Seas Fleet shortly before the end of World War I. The bulk of the High Seas Fleet was to have sortied from their base in Wilhelmshaven to engage the British Grand Fleet; Scheer—by now the of the fleet—intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy, in order to retain a better bargaining position for Germany, whatever the cost to the fleet. While the fleet was consolidating in Wilhelmshaven, war-weary sailors began deserting en masse. As and passed through the locks that separated Wilhelmshaven&#x27;s inner harbor and roadstead, some 300 men from both ships climbed over the side and disappeared ashore.

On 24 October 1918, the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven. Many of the war-weary sailors felt the operation would disrupt the peace process and prolong the war. Starting on the night of 29 October, sailors on several battleships mutinied; three ships from III Squadron refused to weigh anchors, and acts of sabotage were committed on board the battleships and . The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation. Informed of the situation, the Kaiser stated &quot;I no longer have a navy.&quot; The Wilhelmshaven mutiny spread to Kiel, and fueled a larger German Revolution that continued after the end of the war. Germany&#x27;s military position was hopeless, and so Generals Paul von Hindenburg and Erich Ludendorff convinced the government to sign the Armistice to end the war.

Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918, most of the High Seas Fleet, under the command of Reuter, were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow. Prior to the departure of the German fleet, Admiral Adolf von Trotha made clear to Reuter that he could not allow the Allies to seize the ships, under any conditions. The fleet rendezvoused with the British light cruiser , which led the ships to the Allied fleet that was to escort the Germans to Scapa Flow. The massive flotilla consisted of some 370 British, American, and French warships. Once the ships were interned, their guns were disabled through the removal of their breech blocks, and their crews were reduced to 200 officers and men.

The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended by two days, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. slipped beneath the surface at 13:50. On her side and on the bottom in 22 meters of water the wreck was frequently mistaken for a small island, and was sold in this condition as scrap to the salvage firm of Cox and Danks, led by Ernest Cox, along with a battleship and twenty-six destroyers.

Salvaging also proved difficult, as the ship sank again during the first attempt to raise her, wrecking most of the salvage equipment. Undaunted, Cox tried again, ordering that when she was next raised, news cameras would be there to capture him witnessing the moment. The plan nearly backfired when was accidentally refloated while Cox was holidaying in Switzerland. Cox told the workers to sink her again, then returned to Britain to be present as was duly refloated a third time. The ship was raised on 2 November 1928, and while still inverted was towed south to be scrapped in Rosyth by 1930. ″s bell is on display at the Laboe Naval Memorial. One of the ship&#x27;s 15 cm guns, which had been removed in 1916, was later mounted aboard the commerce raider during World War II.

<text>Mordant&#x27;s Need is a fantasy two-part book series by American writer Stephen R. Donaldson, comprising the novels &quot;The Mirror of Her Dreams&quot; (1986) and &quot;A Man Rides Through&quot; (1987).

==Synopsis==
It tells the story of a woman named Terisa who travels from our modern world to a medieval setting through a mirror, where political and military struggles are entwined with the power of Imagery, a form of magic based on mirrors. The Mirror of Her Dreams, the first volume, was published in 1986 and A Man Rides Through, the second volume, was published in 1987. The books deal with themes of reality, power, inaction and love in the context of a fantasy adventure. This series is much lighter in tone than Donaldson&#x27;s &quot;The Chronicles of Thomas Covenant, the Unbeliever&quot; or &quot;The Gap Cycle&quot;.

==Plot summary==
Terisa Morgan opens the series living a vacant life, supported by her father from afar and volunteering at a mission for lack of anything more purposeful to do with her time. She fills her apartment with mirrors so as to see her reflection, and thus be constantly reassured of her existence. Geraden, an apprentice Imager (magician) from a land called Mordant appears in her apartment, searching for aid against a powerful enemy who has been plaguing Mordant with monsters &quot;translated&quot; from other worlds. As mirrors are inextricably linked with magic in Mordant, Terisa&#x27;s home decor convinces him that he has stumbled into the lair of a powerful sorceress. He persuades her to accompany him back to the snowbound castle of Orison, where she finds herself embroiled in a morass of intrigue and danger from both the political plotting of a corrupt court and from the frightening magical creatures that appear without warning and can&#x27;t seem to be defended against. As she soon finds out, the mirrors of this world show &quot;anything but&quot; what is in front of them; in fact, mirrors are gateways to other worlds (or to a different point in the same world) and could be manipulated in a variety of ways to effect what amounts to magic. 

Terisa is suddenly the center of attention, a position that she has never before held, which is not easy because Geraden is held in little regard at the castle; so court opinion naturally is divided on whether she should be taken seriously as a potentially powerful ally, threat, or treated as an object of ridicule and proof of Geraden&#x27;s perceived incompetence. She must deal with the ever-earnest Geraden, the (seemingly) senile King Joyse and his headstrong daughters, the mad Adept Havelock, the inimical Castellan Lebbick, Geraden&#x27;s mostly-well-meaning brothers, the lascivious Master Eremis and the rest of the disorganized group of Imager masters Geraden belongs to known collectively as the Congery.

Unsurprisingly, the story twists and turns, very little is as it seems in Orison and various groups plot to depose King Joyse and take over Mordant. The mysterious rogue Imager is still sending magical creatures to cause destruction seemingly without rhyme or reason; the High King&#x27;s Monomach, the best swordsmen in the land, appears in Orison by seemingly impossible translations; and Geraden remains firmly convinced that he has not made a mistake and that Terisa definitely is to be Mordant&#x27;s champion and salvation despite her own doubts, protests, and debilitating passivity.

==Main characters==
* Terisa Morgan: Terisa grew up mostly ignored by her rich parents, and has become extremely passive and self-effacing as a result. She often feels as if she is unreal, which can only be countered by seeing a reflection of herself in one of her many mirrors. She agrees to help Geraden because he looks at her so earnestly she knows she is real, at least, to him. 
* Geraden: the youngest of seven brothers, Geraden is clumsy and prone to embarrassing himself in front of others. Chosen to seek the champion by an augury, his magic is considered to have gone awry when he finds Terisa instead of the great warrior everyone was expecting.
* King Joyse: once a formidable warrior, Joyse managed to unite the warring Cares of Mordant into one nation under his rule, in order to pull the teeth of neighboring lands of Cadwall and the Alend Kingdom. He created the Congery, a group of Imagers devoted to studying how Imagery could be used for good, and forced every Imager to join it. Now, with a rogue Imager or Imagers sending horror after horror into the kingdom, he appears to have become weak and diffident about the fate of the world.
* Elega, Myste, and Torrent, the King&#x27;s daughters: Elega is the eldest; pragmatic and headstrong, she is furious with her father for his inaction. Myste is a dreamer, who has faith that somehow things will work out. Torrent, the youngest, is estranged from her father, as she followed her mother back to her childhood Care in protest of the King&#x27;s refusal to act.
* Master Havelock: Formerly Joyse&#x27;s personal Imager and best friend, Havelock was driven mad by going through a flat mirror but has rare moments of partial lucidity. 
* Castellan Lebbick: The man in charge of the castle&#x27;s defense, he is loyal to Joyse because he cannot believe in anything else. He is tormented by the rape and murder of his wife by enemy soldiers during the Alend-Cadwall wars.
* Master Eremis: One of the Imagers in the Congery, he suggests that Terisa did not exist until she came to Mordant, but this doesn&#x27;t stop him from trying to seduce her at every turn.
* Prince Kragen: Son of the Alend Monarch and hopeful heir to the throne, he is sent as his father&#x27;s emissary to King Joyse to learn how Joyse plans to defeat the threat from Imagery. 
* Artagel: Geraden&#x27;s eldest brother, he is the best swordsman in Mordant.
* Vagel: formerly an imager from Cadwall, he is an Arch-Imager, one who can pass through flat mirrors without going mad. He is responsible for Havelock&#x27;s condition, but long rumored to be dead
* Gart: the High King of Cadwall&#x27;s Monomach; an assassin highly trained in every manner of weaponry, fighting, and clandestine murder.

==Themes==

The story deals deeply with themes of what reality is, and how we can know what is real. Terisa is a troubled young woman who doubts the reality of her own existence, even before she is summoned to Mordant, where the prevailing belief among Imagers is that the things they summon from their magic mirrors (such as Terisa) do not actually exist before Imagery brings them into the world of Mordant.

There is a similarity between the handling of this theme in &quot;Mordant&#x27;s Need&quot; and in Donaldson&#x27;s &quot;Thomas Covenant&quot; series, where Thomas Covenant, the &quot;Unbeliever&quot;, commits at least one reprehensible act because he refuses to believe that the world he perceives around him could be real. Mordant&#x27;s Need can be read as a reflection, or mirror image, of the Covenant story, where the reality questioned is not the fantasy world and the reality of those around the male protagonist, but the original world and the female protagonist&#x27;s own reality.

The dynamic between the aged King Joyse and his daughters strongly echoes Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;.

<text>Mammola Sandon, known by the stage name of Flo Sandon&#x27;s (29 June 1924 – 17 November 2006), was an Italian singer who was popular in the post-World War II years. She won the Sanremo Music Festival in 1953 with the song &quot;Viale d&#x27;autunno&quot;.

==Career==
Sandon was born in Vicenza, in Veneto. Her musical career began in 1944 when she made her stage début in a Red Cross charity show. Her stage name &quot;Sandon&#x27;s&quot; came by chance - it was an oversight by the illustrator who prepared her first record cover.
Her first big break as a professional vocalist came in 1947, when she sang in The Hot Club of France with two jazz legends: guitarist Django Reinhardt, and violinist Stéphane Grappelli. Celebrity came in 1952 thanks to the movie &quot;Anna&quot; directed by Alberto Lattuada and starring Silvana Mangano, Vittorio Gassman and Raf Vallone. Flo Sandon&#x27;s did not appear in the movie itself, but she performed two songs on the movie soundtrack, &quot;T&#x27;ho voluto ben&quot; and &quot;El Negro Zumbón&quot;. Both were great hits. Nat King Cole liked &quot;T&#x27;ho voluto ben&quot; so much that a few years later he recorded it with the new title &quot;Non Dimenticar&quot;.

In 1953 Flo Sandon&#x27;s took part in the Sanremo Music Festival for the first time, and won. The song was &quot;Viale d&#x27;autunno&quot; and it was also performed by another singer, Carla Boni. Both winners were at their first appearance at the popular song contest, and succeeded ahead of the great favorite Nilla Pizzi. The press speculated about a possible plot against Pizzi: allegedly she had been originally chosen to perform &quot;Viale d&#x27;autunno&quot; but was then dismissed, possibly out of spite or jealousy, and the song offered to Sandon&#x27;s and Boni.

In 1955 Flo Sandon&#x27;s married Natalino Otto, also an Italian singer. They had a daughter, Silvia, who was born in 1956. They later toured together in Italy and abroad for several years.

They are credited with the discovery of one of Italy&#x27;s greatest singers of all times - Mina. On the night of 24 September 1958, the Happy Boys, a band of teen-age students was playing in the Rivarolo del Re dance hall, Cremona. Otto and his wife were present, and were greatly impressed by the singer of that group. They went to meet her at the end of the concert and proposed her a trial recording session. One month later, Mina&#x27;s first single was out.

Flo Sandon&#x27;s competed five more times at the Sanremo Music Festival, but never won again. She however won another song contest, the Festival of Naples in 1960 with &quot;Serenata a Mergellina&quot;.

Other hits from her repertoire include &quot;Vorrei volare&quot;, &quot;Kiss Me&quot;, &quot;I Love Paris&quot;, &quot;Passa il tempo&quot;, &quot;Concerto d&#x27;autunno&quot;, &quot;Verde luna&quot;, &quot;Domani&quot;, &quot;Que sera sera&quot; and &quot;Bevi con me&quot;.

Flo Sandon&#x27;s died in Rome at the age of 82.

<text>LaMar Baker (December 29, 1915 – June 20, 2003) was a Tennessee businessman and Republican political figure who served two terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1975. Earlier, he had been a member of both houses of the Tennessee State Legislature.

==Biography==
Born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, Baker attended public schools there and then David Lipscomb College, now Lipscomb University, in Nashville from 1936 to 1938. In 1940, he received a Bachelor of Science degree from Harding College in Searcy, Arkansas. Both Lipscomb and Harding are Churches of Christ institutions. During World War II, he served from 1942 to 1946 in the United States Army Air Forces, now the United States Air Force.

Baker was a successful Chattanooga-area businessman prior to his election in 1966 to the Tennessee House of Representatives. In 1968, he was elected to the Tennessee State Senate. In 1970, he received the Republican nomination for the Chattanooga-based Congressional District to replace Bill Brock, who was elected to the United States Senate. He won a very close race in November, undoubtedly aided by coattails of Brock and the Republican gubernatorial victor, Winfield Dunn.

Baker served two terms in Congress. He was reelected in the Republican landslide year of 1972, in which President Richard M. Nixon won all but five of Tennessee&#x27;s ninety-five counties. Baker was a delegate to the 1972 Republican National Convention. In 1974, however, he was defeated for reelection by Democrat Marilyn Lloyd.

Two factors were involved in this defeat. One was the general unpopularity of Republicans in the wake of the Watergate scandal and Nixon&#x27;s resignation earlier that year, which was played out in many usually competitive and marginally Republican districts throughout the country. The other was the fact that Marilyn Lloyd was the widow of Mort Lloyd, an anchorman at CBS affiliate WDEF-TV, who had won the Democratic nomination to face Baker and who had then been killed in a light-airplane accident on his way to celebrate his primary victory; the Democratic Party then chose his wife to succeed him as the congressional nominee.

Baker lost badly in a rematch against Lloyd in 1976, when Jimmy Carter of Georgia won Tennessee&#x27;s electoral votes. From 1981 to 1985, during the administration of U.S. President Ronald W. Reagan, Baker served as the regional representative to the United States Secretary of Transportation Drew Lewis. Baker lived his later years in Nashville and is interred in that city&#x27;s Woodlawn Cemetery.

<text>Patong ( , ) refers to the beach and town on Phuket&#x27;s west coast. It is the main tourist resort on the island of Phuket, and is the centre of Phuket&#x27;s nightlife and shopping. The beach became popular with Western tourists, especially Europeans, in the late-1980s. It has numerous hotels and the area has expanded into a tourist place.

==History==

Patong Beach is known for its nightlife and 2850-metre (1.77 mile) beach that runs the entire length of Patong&#x27;s west side. Nightlife is centered in two main areas, Bangla Road and the &quot;Paradise Complex&quot;, with Bangla Road being predominantly straight and Paradise Complex gay. Both are lined with many bars, discotheques, and go go bars. Prostitution in Thailand is illegal, but tolerated, as is the case in Patong. 

On 26 December 2004, Patong Beach along with many other areas along the west coast of Phuket and Thailand were struck by a tsunami caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. The wave caused a great deal of destruction to the waterfront of the beach and immediately inland and only one woman was killed in a basement seafront grocery store. Patong was one of the worst affected areas of Phuket, although the destruction was not as bad as nearby Khao Lak. Patong has largely recovered since the tsunami.

==Environment==
 the waters off Patong Beach exceeded Thai Pollution Control Department standards for fecal coliform bacteria (FCB) and enterococci bacteria. To avoid paying the municipal wastewater treatment fee of five baht per cubic meter, many households discharge their wastewater untreated into canals and the sea. Patong also has limited capacity to treat wastewater. The municipal wastewater treatment plant is nearing its capacity of 28,000 m3 a day. An upgrade be operational in 2018 which will increase capacity by an extra 9,000 m3 per day.

=== Municipality&#x27;s Efforts to Maintain Cleanliness at Patong Beach in Phuket ===
Patong Beach, attracting a large number of visitors every day. Unfortunately, this influx of tourists can sometimes lead to pollution and garbage on the beach.

=== Nightlife ===
Bangla is considered as the most popular walking street in Phuket. Along the street is full of beer bars and go-go bars, which makes tourists stay there longer or in a whole night.

<text>Jean La Lime or Lalime (died June 17, 1812) was a trader from Quebec, Canada who worked in what became the Northwest Territory of the United States. He worked as an agent for William Burnett, also of Canada, to sell to the Native Americans and take furs in exchange. He was among the first European permanent settlers in Chicago. He was killed there in 1812, in what was called the &quot;first murder in Chicago&quot;, by John Kinzie, a trading partner of Burnett who was another early settler from Canada.
==Chicago==
During the time of the American Revolutionary War, France joined the cause of the Americans against the British. Because of this, in their Canadian territories, the British treated those of French heritage more harshly. Several families, the first two being the families of Jean La Lime and Antoinne Ouillemette, fled to the Eschikagou (Chicago) area to escape the harsh treatment. After trading along the frontier and likely in Detroit, La Lime arrived in the Chicago area on August 17, 1792 as an agent for William Burnett of Canada. In 1800, he purchased the homestead of Jean Baptiste Point du Sable for Burnett for 6,000 livres. The bill of sale was filed in Detroit, Michigan on September 18, 1800, although dated in Chicago on May 7 of that year. After the Americans established Fort Dearborn in 1804, La Lime worked there as an interpreter, aiding communication between the Americans and Indians. He broke his leg in 1809 and, as it was improperly set, was left lame.

==Murder==
By 1804, Burnett&#x27;s partner, John Kinzie, who also settled in Chicago, had bought the former du Sable house. He lived there with his wife and first child. They had three other children born in Chicago. On June 17, 1812 in Chicago, La Lime and Kinzie quarreled, and Kinzie killed him. Kinzie fled to Milwaukee, then in Indian territory. He claimed La Lime had shot at him and he had stabbed the interpreter in self-defense. 

In letters to U.S. Secretary of War William Eustis, fort Factor Matthew Irwin and Surgeon&#x27;s Mate Isaac Van Voorhis wrote that Kinzie murdered La Lime in an argument over Irwin informing the War Department about Kinzie corruptly obtaining the fort sutler&#x27;s contract.
==Burial==
La Lime was originally buried within sight of Kinzie&#x27;s house, as the European settlement was thinly strung along Lake Michigan. 

Recounting stories told her by John Kinzie’s wife Eleanor Lytle Kinzie, John Kinzie’s daughter-in-law Juliette Magill Kinzie would later write that La Lime’s friends buried him directly in front of John Kinzie’s home as “suitable punishment,” but that the Kinzie family maintained the gravesite “in most beautiful order” and planted flowers on it.

However, former Kinzie family servant Victoire Porthier, who grew up in the Kinzie house, told historian A.T. Andreas in 1883, “I don’t think his grave was very near Mr. Kinzie’s house. I don’t remember that Mr. Kinzie ever took care of the grave.”

In 1891, a coffin was discovered at Wabash Avenue and Illinois Street near the Rush Street Bridge. Based on the research of Joseph Kirkland, the bones inside were believed to be La Lime&#x27;s. The remains are held by the Chicago History Museum.

<text>The Battle of Ortona (20–28 December 1943) was fought between two battalions of elite German (paratroops) from the German 1st Parachute Division under Richard Heidrich, and assaulting Canadian troops from the 1st Canadian Infantry Division under Major General Christopher Vokes. It was the culmination of the fighting on the Adriatic front in Italy during &quot;Bloody December&quot;. The battle was known to those who fought it as the &quot;Italian Stalingrad,&quot; and as &quot;Little Stalingrad&quot;, for the brutality of its close-quarters combat, which was only worsened by the chaotic rubble of the town and the many booby traps used by both sides. The battle took place in the small Adriatic Sea town of Ortona (Abruzzo), with a peacetime population of 10,000.

==Background==
By late 1943, the Allies did not intend the entire Italian campaign to win the war but only to remove Italian troops from other areas of Europe, divert German forces from France and reduce the strength of the German army; the D-Day invasion was already in the planning stages for the following spring or summer. As one source indicates, &quot;By dividing Nazi forces between several separate fronts, the Allies would prevent Hitler from striking a deadly blow at the USSR or from concentrating an invincible army along the coast of Normandy&quot;.

The British Eighth Army&#x27;s offensive on the Winter Line defences east of the Apennine mountains had commenced on 23 November with the crossing of the river Sangro. By the end of the month, the main Gustav Line defences (the major part of the Winter Line) had been penetrated and the Allied troops were fighting their way forward to the next river, the Moro, north of the mouth of which lay Ortona. For the Moro crossing in early December the exhausted British 78th Infantry Division on the Allied right flank on the Adriatic coast had been relieved by the 1st Canadian Infantry Division, under the command of Major-General Christopher Vokes. By mid-December, after fierce fighting in the cold and mud, the 1st Canadian Division&#x27;s 1st Infantry Brigade, under Brigadier Howard Graham, had fought its way to within of Ortona and was relieved by Brigadier Bert Hoffmeister&#x27;s 2nd Infantry Brigade for the advance on the town.

Some historians indicate that Ortona was of high strategic importance, as it was one of Italy&#x27;s few usable deep water ports on the east coast, and was needed for docking Allied ships and to shorten Eighth Army&#x27;s lines of supply which at the time stretched back to Bari and Taranto. Allied forces were ordered to maintain the offensive, and going through the built-up areas in and around Ortona was the only feasible option. Ortona was part of the Winter Line defence system and the Germans had constructed a series of interlocking defensive positions in the town. This—together with the fact that the Germans had been ordered to &quot;fight for every last house and tree&quot;—made the town a formidable obstacle to any attacking force.

Other historians, including Rick Atkinson, assign lesser importance for Ortona. He quotes Field Marshal Albert Kesselring who said, &quot;We do not want to defend Ortona decisively .. but the English have made it appear as important as Rome&quot;; General Joachim Lemelsen, the temporary commander, replied, &quot;It costs so much in blood, it cannot be justified&quot;. Nonetheless, the Allies believed it would be merely a minor battle and proceeded with the plan; the Germans then rose to the occasion, holding the town with great determination.

==Battle==

The Canadians faced elements of the German 1st Parachute Division. These soldiers were battle-hardened after many years of war, and defended doggedly.

The initial Canadian attack on the town was made on 20 December by Canadian 2nd Brigade&#x27;s Loyal Edmonton Regiment with elements of The Seaforth Highlanders of Canada under command. Meanwhile, elements of the division&#x27;s 3rd Infantry Brigade launched a northerly attack to the west of the town in attempt to outflank and cut off the town&#x27;s rear communications but made slow progress because of the difficult terrain and the skillful and determined German defence. On 21 December 1943, the Loyal Edmonton Regiment and the Seaforth Highlanders entered Ortona, assisted by the tanks of the Three Rivers Regiment, part of the 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade, under Brigadier Robert Andrew Wyman.

===Mouse-holing===
The Germans had concealed various machine guns and anti-tank emplacements throughout the town, making movement by armour and infantry increasingly difficult. The house-to-house fighting was vicious and the Canadians made use of a tactic that had previously infrequently been used: &quot;mouse-holing&quot;. This tactic involved using weapons such as the PIAT or cumbersome Teller anti-tank mines to create a large aperture in the wall of a building, as houses within Ortona shared adjoining walls. The soldiers would then throw in grenades and make their assault through the mouse holes, clearing the stairs to the top or bottom floor with grenades or machine guns; they would follow to reach any adversaries and struggle in repeated close-quarters combat. Mouse-holing was also used to pierce through walls into adjoining rooms, sometimes catching enemy troops by surprise. The tactic would be used repeatedly as assaulting through the streets caused heavy casualties for both Canadian and German troops.

Mouse-holing also allowed the soldiers to progress through the town, building by building, without entering the streets where they would face enemy fire. While some sources attribute the strategy to the Canadian forces, a British training film of 1941 had already illustrated the concept. The Canadians were certainly early, effective and courageous users of the technique. Throughout the battle, engineers on both sides also used the brutal but effective tactic of using demolition charges to collapse entire buildings on top of enemy troops.

On 28 December, after eight days of fighting, the depleted German troops finally withdrew from the town. The Canadians suffered 1,375 dead during the Moro River battles of which Ortona was one part. This represented almost a quarter of all Canadians killed during the entire Italian Campaign. Other sources placed Canadian casualties as high as 2,300 (including 500 dead) before the town was won for the Allies.

The battle has been examined post-war for lessons in urban fighting, drawing upon articles. A detailed online account exists.

===Destruction===
The Canadians destroyed the dome on the church of St Thomas in the town centre using tank fire, to prevent it being used for spotting. On Christmas Day the Allies (who had by then occupied a smaller church), were ordered to destroy both the cathedral and the civilian hospital, but this was largely avoided.

==Legacy==
Ortona was successfully liberated but the month would be considered as &quot;Bloody December&quot; by Canadian forces because of the numerous casualties in and around the town. As well, over 5,000 Canadians were evacuated due to battle exhaustion and illness. In addition to the Canadian losses, the German 1st Parachute Division and the 90th Light Infantry Division (Wehrmacht) also suffered numerous casualties.
The contribution made by Canadian troops was summarized as follows by Major General Christopher Vokes in his report on the Ortona offensive: &quot;We smashed the 90th Panzer Grenadier Division and we gave the 1st German Parachute Division a mauling which it will long remember&quot;. Nonetheless, after the war, the significance of the battle in Ortona was minimized by others such as Rick Atkinson, perhaps because it did not have a significant impact on winning the war.

In November 2000, the Government of Canada erected a plaque at the Piazza Plebiscito in Ortona, in recognition of the battle as a National Historic Event of Canada that &quot;symbolized the efforts of the Canadian Army in the Italian Campaign during World War II&quot;. The plaque reads as follows: &quot;In early December 1943 the 1st Canadian Infantry Division and 1st Canadian Armoured Brigade began their most savage battle of the Italian Campaign. In the mud and rain troops attacked from the Moro River to Ortona. Then, from house to house and room to room there raged a ferocious battle against resolute German defenders. With extraordinary courage the Canadians prevailed, and just after Christmas finally secured the town&quot;.

<doc id="1086815" wikidata="Q314146" url="?curid=1086815" title="Tom Regan">
<text>Tom Regan (; November 28, 1938 – February 17, 2017) was an American philosopher who specialized in animal rights theory. He was professor emeritus of philosophy at North Carolina State University, where he had taught from 1967 until his retirement in 2001.

Regan was the author of numerous books on the philosophy of animal rights, including &quot;The Case for Animal Rights&quot; (1983), one of a handful of studies that have significantly influenced the modern animal rights movement. In these, he argued that non-human animals are what he called the &quot;subjects-of-a-life&quot;, just as humans are, and that, if we want to ascribe value to all human beings regardless of their ability to be rational agents, then to be consistent, we must similarly ascribe it to non-humans.

From 1985, Regan served with his wife Nancy as co-founder and co-president of the Culture and Animals Foundation, a nonprofit organization &quot;committed to fostering the growth of intellectual and artistic endeavors united by a positive concern for animals&quot;. The Vegan Society remembers him as &quot;a stalwart vegan and activist&quot;.

==Education and career==
Regan graduated from Thiel College in 1960, receiving his M.A. in 1962 and his PhD in 1966 from the University of Virginia. He taught philosophy at North Carolina State University from 1967 until 2001. Regan directed the 1986 film &quot;We Are All Noah&quot;, which is available on VHS videotape.

==Animal rights==
In &quot;The Case for Animal Rights&quot;, Regan argued that non-human animals bear moral rights. His philosophy aligns broadly within the tradition of Immanuel Kant, although he rejects Kant&#x27;s idea that respect is due only to rational beings. Regan points out that we routinely ascribe inherent value, and thus the right to be treated with respect, to humans who are not rational, including infants and the severely mentally impaired.

The crucial attribute that all humans have in common, he argues, is not rationality, but the fact that each of us has a life that matters to us; in other words, what happens to us matters to us, regardless of whether it matters to anyone else. In Regan&#x27;s terminology, we each experience being the &quot;subject-of-a-life&quot;. If this is the true basis for ascribing inherent value to individuals, to be consistent we must ascribe inherent value, and hence moral rights, to all subjects-of-a-life, whether human or non-human. The basic right that all who possess inherent value have, he argues, is the right never to be treated merely as a means to the ends of others.

In Regan&#x27;s view, not to be used as a means entails the right to be treated with respect, which includes the right not to be harmed. This right, however, is not absolute, as, there are times when to respect someone&#x27; s right not to be harmed, another&#x27; s right not to be harmed must be overridden. His philosophy employs principles such as the miniride principle (a.k.a. minimize overriding) and the worse-off principle to deal with these situations. The miniride principle is that when faced with overriding the rights of many innocent beings versus the rights of few innocent beings—when each individual involved would be equally harmed—we should override the rights of the few. The worse-off principle states that, when individuals involved are not harmed in a comparable way given a certain course of action, we should mitigate the situation of those who would be worse-off. Thus, if the harm of a few innocent beings is greater than the harm to many innocent beings, the right action is to override the rights of the many. As this relates to animal rights, Regan asserts the harm in the death of an animal is not tantamount to the harm in the death of a normal, healthy human. This is supposedly because the ending of an animal life entails the loss of fewer opportunities when compared to the loss of a normal, healthy human. According to Regan, there would be more harm in the death of a normal, healthy dog than there would be in the death of a person who was irreversibly comatose, as the dog would have more opportunities for satisfaction than the irreversibly comatose human.

Supporters argue that Regan&#x27;s argument for animal rights does not rely on a radical new theory of ethics, but that it follows from a consistent application of moral principles and insights that many of us already hold with respect to the ethical treatment of human beings; however, others criticize the lack of certainty with which Regan&#x27;s &quot;inherent value&quot; or &quot;subject-of-a-life&quot; status can be determined, and note that the sufficient conditions he lists—for example, having sense-perceptions, beliefs, desires, motives, and memory—in effect reduce to &quot;similarity to humans&quot;.

According to Regan, it follows from the ascription to animals of the basic right to be treated with respect that we should abolish the breeding of animals for food, animal experimentation, and commercial hunting. Starting as a leather-wearing, circus-visiting meat eater, a series of musings, experiences, and insights led him to conclude he was morally unable to use animals for meat, clothing, or any other purpose that does not respect their rights. Reagan was unconcerned with the prospects of humans possibly dying from diseases which might be cured from animal research, saying, “ “If it [abolition of animal research] means there are some things we cannot learn, then so be it. We have no basic right not to be harmed by those natural diseases we are heir to.”

==G. E. Moore scholarship==

In the 1980s, Regan published three books on G. E. Moore&#x27;s philosophy. The first book, &quot;G. E. Moore: The Early Essays&quot;, is a collection of essays that were originally published between 1897 and 1903, none of which Moore himself anthologized. Regan argues that these papers reveal Moore&#x27;s early taste for speculative metaphysics; in &quot;The Nature of Judgment&quot;, for example, Moore maintains that &quot;the world consists of concepts&quot;, including existence, &quot;which is itself a concept ... Thus, all that exists ... is composed of concepts necessarily related to one another in specific manners, and likewise to the concept of existence.&quot; In another paper, &quot;Freedom&quot;, Moore enthusiastically affirms his agreement with F. H. Bradley, writing: &quot;I can only say that the arguments by which Mr. Bradley has endeavoured to prove the unreality of Time appear to me perfectly conclusive.&quot; Regan&#x27;s second book, &quot;The Elements of Ethics&quot;, is a series of ten lectures Moore delivered in 1898. Large parts of these lectures were carried over by Moore into &quot;Principia Ethica&quot; and, Regan maintains, these lectures cast important light on &quot;Principia&quot; pages.

Regan&#x27;s third book, &quot;Bloomsbury&#x27;s Prophet: G. E. Moore and the Development of His Moral Philosophy&quot;, represents Regan&#x27;s major contribution to Moorean scholarship. Representative reviews include E. D. Klemke writing that &quot;Bloomsbury&#x27;s Prophet&quot; is &quot;a marvelous book&quot;, while Aurum Stroll writes &quot;[t]he portrait of the man Moore that Regan gives us is not only unique ... but it is well done, indeed.&quot; In this book, Regan relies on a trove of unpublished material, housed in the Moore Archive at the University of Cambridge, including Moore&#x27;s two dissertations, on Kant&#x27;s moral philosophy; correspondence, consisting of letters that Moore wrote as well those he received; scores of papers he read at meetings of the Cambridge Conversazione Society, also known as the Apostles, and at the Sunday Essay Society; and a diary Moore kept throughout his formative years, breaking off on April 19, 1916. Using these materials, Regan argues that &quot;Principia&quot;″s primary purpose was (as Moore wrote) to &quot;humble the Science of Ethics&quot; by exposing the &quot;lies&quot; told by &quot;would-be scientific ethicists&quot; (&quot;Art, Morals, and Religion&quot;: May 5, 1901). In Moore&#x27;s view, a truly scientific ethic is able to prove very little concerning values, rules, duty, and virtues.

Regarding values: such an ethic cannot establish anything concerning what has intrinsic value—what is good in itself. That must be left to the judgment of individuals who, taking due precautions, ask themselves what things would be good if they were the only things to exist in the world. Regarding rules of conduct: a truly scientific ethic can at most establish that &quot;a very few rules&quot; (&quot;Principia&quot;, xxii, italics in the original) ought always to be followed. Not even all the rules commended by Common Sense qualify: only &quot;most of those most universally recognized by Common Sense&quot; are possible candidates, and even in their case Moore maintains only that the requisite type of justification &quot;may be possible&quot; (p. xxii, italics in the original). That being so, almost all our decisions will need to be made without relying on any rule: in almost all cases, Moore writes, &quot;rules of action should not be followed at all&quot; (&quot;Ibid&quot;., p. xiii). In all cases of this sort, individuals should guide their choice &quot;by a direct consideration of the effects which the action may produce&quot; (p. XX), doing what one thinks will promote one&#x27; s own interests, as these are enlarged by the lives of others in whom one has &quot;a strong personal interest&quot; (&quot;Ibid&quot;., XX) instead of attempting to satisfy the demands of &quot;a more extended beneficence,&quot; as in &quot;the greatest good for the greatest number.&quot; And of the goods to be aimed at, the more immediate are generally to be preferred to the more distant. In short, in virtually all our activities in our day-to-day life we are at liberty to live and choose without troubling ourselves about whether we are doing what duty, in the form of the rules of morality, requires.

Regarding virtues: a truly scientific ethic should promote the private virtues of prudence, temperance, and industry (the only virtues Moore discusses in &quot;Principia&quot;), not the (so-called) virtues of beneficence, charity, civic-mindedness, social justice, patriotism, piety, reverence, or altruism. Such an ethic should promote the virtues of the creative self, not the virtues of the conscientious citizen. On this basis Regan argues that Moore genuinely is &quot;Bloomsbury&#x27; s prophet,&quot; advocating, as he does, the values, the rules of conduct, and the virtues that are synonymous with the name, &quot;Bloomsbury.&quot; As Regan notes, &quot;theirs was an anarchy of the bedroom, not the streets.&quot; Writing in the Library Journal, Leon H. Brody assessed the work as follows. &quot;Regan&#x27;s thesis is that an adequate understanding of Moore&#x27;s ethical philosophy can be achieved only when seen against the backdrop of Bloomsbury—the avant-garde group of free spirits (among whom were Lytton Strachey, Virginia Woolf, and John Maynard Keynes) who met weekly in London between 1905 and 1920. When seen in that light, Regan argues, Moore&#x27;s thought as expressed in &quot;Principia Ethica&quot; is a &quot;radical defense of the freedom of the individual to choose,&quot; rather than a defense of conformity to the status quo, as is usually assumed. Written with the verve appropriate to its subject, and yet philosophically scrupulous, this book deserves a place in philosophy and cultural history collections in both public and academic libraries.&quot;

<doc id="1086816" wikidata="Q7709620" url="?curid=1086816" title="Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes">
<text>The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes (; ) is a Catholic Marian shrine and pilgrimage site dedicated to Our Lady of Lourdes in the town of Lourdes, Hautes-Pyrénées, France. The sanctuary includes several religious buildings and monuments around the grotto of Massabielle, the place where the events of the Lourdes apparitions occurred in 1858, among them are three basilicas, the Basilica of Our Lady of the Immaculate Conception, the Rosary Basilica and the Basilica of St. Pius X, respectively known as the upper, lower and underground basilica.

The sanctuary is a destination for sick and disabled pilgrims as the Lourdes water, which has flowed from the grotto since the apparitions, is reputed for miraculous healings. The area is owned and administered by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Tarbes-et-Lourdes, and has several functions, including devotional activities, offices, and accommodation for sick and disabled pilgrims and their helpers. In addition to the grotto and the three basilicas, the sanctuary includes fountains providing Lourdes water, baths for immersion in the water, an esplanade for processions, a calvary, the offices of the Lourdes Medical Bureau, and several places of worship in a area.

The sanctuary of Lourdes is one of the most-visited Catholic shrines in the world, with around four million tourists coming every year. The grotto of Massabielle, which is the most famous site in the sanctuary, has hundreds of replicas around the world, known as &quot;Lourdes grottos&quot;.

== History ==

The sanctuary of Our Lady of Lourdes began with the Marian apparitions to Bernadette Soubirous in 1858 in the town of Lourdes. On 11 February 1858, a 14-year-old peasant girl, called Bernadette Soubirous, said she saw a &quot;lady&quot; while playing near the grotto of Massabielle (from &quot;masse vieille&quot;: &quot;old mass&quot;) with her sister and a friend, on the left bank of the Gave de Pau river. The &quot;lady&quot; was standing on a rose bush in a niche above the main cavity of the Massabielle grotto.

At the time of the apparitions, the grotto lay well outside town, on common ground which was used by the villagers variously for pasturing animals, collecting firewood, and as a garbage dump, and it had a reputation for being an unpleasant place.

Bernadette told her sister not to tell their parents about the apparition, but she told them anyway and their parents forbid them to go to the grotto again. Bernadette ignored their orders and kept going to the grotto. From 11 February to 16 July 1858, Bernadette saw the same vision 18 times. The &quot;lady&quot; eventually introduced herself to Bernadette as the Immaculate Conception, which had been proclaimed as a dogma for the Virgin Mary by Pope Pius IX in 1854. This convinced local priest Dominique Peyramale that Bernadette saw an authentic apparition of the Virgin Mary.

During the apparitions, Bernadette was given instructions by the &quot;lady&quot;, which were to prove central in the development of the sanctuary and its ceremonies. Bernadette was told to go and drink water from a spring which was to appear inside the grotto and wash herself with it. She was also told to go and tell the priests to build a chapel at the grotto site where people were to come in procession.

During the months after the apparitions, public interest in the apparitions grew, and curious visitors began to be replaced by pilgrims from increasingly far away, drawn by compelling stories of apparitions and miracles.

Local priest Dominique Peyramale and local bishop Bertrand-Sévère Laurence bought the grotto and the land around it from the town of Lourdes in 1861, three years after the apparitions. Immediately they set about modifying the area to make it more accessible to pilgrims, and started work to build the first of the churches, which is now known as the &quot;Crypt&quot;.

In 1864, the French sculptor Joseph-Hugues Fabisch was commissioned to create a statue of Our Lady of Lourdes based on Bernadette&#x27;s descriptions. Although it has become an iconic symbol of Our Lady of Lourdes, it depicts a figure which is not only older and taller than Bernadette&#x27;s description, but also more in keeping with orthodox and traditional representations of the Virgin Mary. The statue rests in the niche where the Virgin appeared to Bernadette. The original wild rose bush was destroyed shortly after the apparitions by pilgrims seeking relics, but a newer one has been planted nearby.

Due to French political upheaval resulting in an enforced separation of Church and State, the property and grounds of the sanctuary were confiscated from the Church and returned to the ownership of the town in 1910. The then bishop, François-Xavier Schoepfer, contested this confiscation and was permitted to rent the area of the sanctuary from the town until the outbreak of World War I in 1914.
Later, a visit to Lourdes by Marshal Pétain in 1941 provided official recognition of the sanctuary. Church officials successfully petitioned Pétain to allow the Church to reclaim ownership of the sanctuary.

== Administration ==
The Bishop of Tarbes and Lourdes is responsible for the spiritual governance of the sanctuary. He appoints a local representative, who is called the rector. The sanctuary is run independently of the parish of Lourdes, which is responsible for the spiritual needs of the Lourdais themselves.

Thirty full-time chaplains are employed in the sanctuary, from dioceses and religious communities worldwide. there were 292 full-time lay employees and a further 120 seasonal employees working in 63 different divisions, with an annual running budget of €18 million, 90% from donations.

The sanctuary is open all year round. In winter there are substantially fewer visitors, a reduced timetable of services and devotional activity, and no processions. The winter season runs from 1 November (the feast of All Saints) until Easter. On 11 February, the Feast of Our Lady of Lourdes, a full programme of activities usually takes place.

The sanctuary is fully active between Easter and All Saints&#x27; Day each year, and has a programme of devotional activities including Mass, processions, adoration of the Blessed Sacrament, and the sacrament of reconciliation. Many activities are carried out in several languages; in some services the liturgy is repeated in different languages.

The grounds are open daily from 5 am until midnight; outside these times the grotto is accessible via the Lacets Gate behind the Upper Basilica.

An estimated 200 million people have visited the shrine since 1860. The Roman Catholic Church has officially recognized 70 miracle healings, the 70th of which was the cure of Sister Bernadette Moriau, recognised on 11 February 2018.

== Lourdes water ==

Lourdes water flows from a spring at the same spot where it was discovered by Bernadette, in the grotto of Massabielle. The original spring can be seen within the grotto, lit from below and protected by a glass screen. Pilgrims drink Lourdes water due to its reputed healing power. The water is accessed from individual taps located between the grotto and the baths. The water from Lourdes was thoroughly analysed by independent chemists in 1858 and 1859, and does not appear to have a latent power to cure and has no special scientific or medicinal properties. Despite this, the water is itself a strong symbol of devotion for Lourdes pilgrims, and many buy statues and rosary beads containing small vials of it, and take home large plastic containers of it.

== Processions ==
Processions are held in the sanctuary, with the torchlight procession being perhaps the best-known and most visually impressive.

=== Blessed Sacrament procession ===
The Blessed Sacrament procession is held daily at 5:00 pm. The procession begins at the open-air altar on the prairie across the river from the grotto and is led by sick pilgrims followed by a priest, bishop or cardinal carrying a monstrance containing the Blessed Sacrament. Typically the bearer of the Blessed Sacrament is sheltered by a baldachin. The Blessed Sacrament is accompanied by candle bearers and incense burners. These ministers are chosen from the pilgrims. A representative group of doctors from the various pilgrimages follow directly behind the Blessed Sacrament, both during the procession and the Blessing of the sick. Lastly, there are groups of pilgrims, some following their parish or diocesan banner. The procession makes its way across the river, past the Crowned Virgin, along the esplanade and down into the St. Pius X underground basilica where pilgrims with disabilities are provided accommodations (often in the front) to access the altar. During the procession, there are meditations, prayers, hymns and chants, all in several languages. When all the participants are assembled, there is a period of Eucharistic adoration, followed by the Blessing of the Sick.

During extreme weather conditions, the procession takes place inside the basilica.
=== Torchlight procession ===
The torchlight Marian procession takes place daily at 9 pm. It begins near the grotto and continues in the alleys of the esplanade ending in the Rosary square. In extreme weather an indoor ceremony may be held in the Underground Basilica instead. The procession is led by sick and disabled pilgrims followed by volunteers carrying a replica of the Cabuchet statue of the Virgin Mary. Most participants carry a candle.

The focus of this procession is the rosary. All five decades are recited, usually in a variety of languages. The &quot;Immaculate Mary&quot;, the Lourdes hymn, is also sung, with verses in different languages. Intercessions may be invoked followed by the &quot;Laudate Mariam&quot;. There is a final blessing in Latin, and then an invitation to exchange the sign of peace with fellow pilgrims.

== Basilicas ==

=== Upper Basilica ===
The Basilica of the Immaculate Conception, commonly known as the &quot;Upper Basilica&quot;, was consecrated in 1876. It is an impressive, elaborate building in Gothic style, designed by architect Hyppolyte Durand, and on one side seems to emerge directly from the rock of Massabielle (the sanctuary is directly above the grotto). The walls are lined with &quot;ex voto&quot; plaques, and banners from official National Pilgrimages of the past. It has a series of stained-glass windows depicting various events in the story of Lourdes; the clerestory windows depict Mary as &quot;the Second Eve&quot;.

The exterior is dominated by a spire, and two lesser spires completed later in 1908. Above the entrance is a mosaic depicting Pope Pius IX, who defined the dogma of the Immaculate Conception in 1854.

The basilica has a crypt, which was the first church to be completed in the sanctuary, in 1866. Construction was started by Abbé Peyramale and bishop Laurence. Bernadette&#x27;s father worked on its construction and was present at its official opening, on Pentecost Sunday 1866. The nave is small and a notable feature as are the enormous pillars which support the weight of the Upper Basilica, which was constructed on top of it.

The crypt is entered along a corridor, whose entrance is dominated by a large bronze statue of St. Peter, holding the Keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. Opposite stands a statue of Pius X. The walls of the corridor and nave are lined with small marble plaques, known as &quot;ex voto&quot; plaques, donated in thanks for spiritual favours received.

=== Lower Basilica ===

The Rosary Basilica, known as the &quot;Lower Basilica&quot;, was completed in 1899, and designed by architect Leopold Hardy. It was consecrated in 1901 and has a capacity of 1,500 worshipers. Its style is influenced by Byzantine architecture. The nave is open and circular, surmounted by a dome. The exterior of the dome is surmounted by a dramatic gilded crown and cross, which were a gift from the people of Ireland in 1924.

The exterior facade of the basilica was modified in 2007 to include a depiction of the luminous mysteries, which are not a part of the traditional fifteen mysteries, but of an extended version of it by Pope John Paul II in 2002.

=== Underground Basilica ===

The Basilica of St. Pius X, known as the &quot;Underground Basilica&quot;, is the largest of the sanctuary&#x27;s churches. It was designed by the architect Pierre Vago and completed in 1958 in anticipation of the enormous crowds expected in Lourdes for the centenary of the apparitions. A modern, concrete building, it is almost entirely underground (part of the building lies beneath the Boulevard Père Rémi Sempé above). When full it can accommodate 25,000 worshippers.

== Grotto area ==
The place where Bernadette Soubirous is said to have seen the Lourdes apparitions is called the &quot;grotto of Massabielle&quot;, which is the most famous place in the sanctuary. The Lourdes water flows from a spring located inside the cave. From 2014 to 2018, the surroundings of the grotto were modified to facilitate the passing of pilgrims through the various facilities around the grotto. A new esplanade was built on the banks, taps providing water from the spring were moved away from the grotto while new fountains for pilgrims were created, baths were renovated and a new bridge was built. Chapel of lights were built on the right bank for pilgrims to light candles.

=== Grotto of Massabielle ===

In contrast to the grandness of Rosary Square and the three basilicas, the grotto at Massabielle where St Bernadette&#x27;s visions took place is very simple and stark. The recess of the grotto itself is undecorated, although a plain stone altar and lectern have been placed there so that Mass can be celebrated. Above the main recess is the niche where the &quot;lady&quot; seen by Bernadette Soubirous was standing during the apparitions and Fabisch&#x27;s statue of Our Lady of Lourdes now stands. A large candelabra with 96 candles next to the altar is kept burning throughout the year. During the pilgrimage season, two pilgrimage Masses are usually celebrated each morning at the grotto.

The spring Bernadette that was discovered can be seen at the rear of the grotto, shielded by a glass cover. When Mass is not being celebrated, pilgrims can process through the grotto where it is traditional to touch the rocks directly under the statue; so many people have done this that the stones have become polished. Also at the rear of the grotto is a metal box into which written prayers or petitions may be deposited; they are collected daily and burnt.

Rows of benches allow visitors to sit and pray or contemplate. Pilgrims are asked to remain silent while in the vicinity to create an atmosphere of devotion. One of the spots where Bernadette prayed to the Virgin is marked by a special paving slab.

Some of the rock walls around the grotto bear clear signs of deliberate alteration, presumably to improve access for pilgrims. It is therefore no longer clear what the original configuration of the grotto was.

At least one contemporary account describes a series of chambers behind the statue&#x27;s niche, which can only be reached by climbing &quot;like a lizard&quot; through clefts in the rocks.

=== Water taps and fountains ===
Lourdes water used to be available for pilgrims at water taps located near the grotto along the Massabielle rock. However, people in charge of the sanctuary thought it would be better to have two separate places for Lourdes water distribution, with one place available for drinking water and filling bottles and containers with water and another place intended for pilgrims to take water as a religious gesture, in the same way Bernadette Soubirous did during the apparitions when she was told by the &quot;lady&quot; to drink water from the spring and wash herself with it. This is why new fountains were created for the &quot;water gesture&quot; on the western side of the grotto along the Massabielle rock, shaped to made it difficult to fill bottles and containers, with a low water flow. New water taps were built on the bank, intended to filling bottles and containers with Lourdes water, away from the grotto.

=== Baths of water ===
In addition to washing their face at the fountains, pilgrims can immerse in baths filled with Lourdes water (called &quot;piscines&quot; in French, meaning &quot;pools&quot;). This is also meant to repeat a gesture made by Bernadette Soubirous during the apparitions as she washed herself with the water after she was told to do so by the &quot;lady&quot;. The original baths were built in 1862 and the current baths in 1955. They are located on the western side of the grotto along the Massabielle rock. Pilgrims are helped by volunteers for a full immersion into the bath. Each year about 350,000 pilgrims bathe. It is not allowed to take pictures or videos.

=== Chapels of light ===

Lighting a votive candle is another religious gesture that Bernadette Soubirous made during the apparitions and which is now part of the Lourdes pilgrimage. Pilgrims used to light candles near the grotto, along the Massabielle rock. Now they have to cross the Gave de Pau river on a new bridge to reach the &quot;chapels of light&quot;, where all candles are meant to be lighted. Around 800 tonnes of wax is burnt annually in devotional candles. Pilgrims can place candles of various sizes, some of them bring large candles from their respective parishes. The candle burners are tended by a staff of &quot;feutiers&quot;, attendants whose job is to ensure candles are burnt safely and evenly and to remove the trays of melted wax which collects under each burner. In July 2022, four candle chapels were damaged by a fire caused by candles and are currently closed.

== Additional religious sites ==
In addition to the three basilicas and the grotto area, the sanctuary has various places of worship and places intended for the pilgrims.

=== Church of St. Bernadette ===
The most recent of the major centres of worship is the Church of St. Bernadette, which was consecrated in 1988. It was built opposite the grotto across the river, on the spot where Bernadette Soubirous stood during the 18th and final apparition on 16 July 1858.

The Church of St. Bernadette is a brutalist building with comparatively little adornment. It was designed to allow as much natural light as possible into the nave, and light-coloured materials have been used, making it noticeably brighter than the Underground Basilica. It was designed by the architect Jean-Paul Felix.

It is also a more versatile building. The nave has provision for 5,000 seated worshippers and 350 wheelchairs, but partitions can be drawn to divide the nave into smaller sections. In addition, it includes the hemicycle, a large lecture room which may be used for worship, and an assortment of conference rooms and smaller rooms which may be used for devotional or non-devotional activity.

=== Chapel of reconciliation ===
The chapel of reconciliation formerly occupied a site slightly more remote, at the entrance of the upper stations of the Cross. It was moved several years ago into a more prominent position, into the building previously known as the Accueil Notre Dame, near the crowned statue and facing the esplanade.

The chapel of reconciliation is somewhat unusual in that no Masses or other services take place there; instead it is given over entirely to the sacrament of reconciliation. Priests from different countries observe a duty roster, which means that, at almost any time of day, pilgrims from Europe (and occasionally further away) can find a priest who will hear their confession in their own language.

=== St. Joseph&#x27;s Chapel ===
St. Joseph&#x27;s Chapel, named in honor of Mary&#x27;s husband Saint Joseph, is situated at the far end of the esplanade, near St. Michael&#x27;s Gate. It is a modern, concrete church, mostly underground, with little natural light. It was also designed by Pierre Vago, and was consecrated on 1 May 1968. It has provision for 450 seated worshipers and 80 wheelchairs.

=== Rosary Square ===

The open space in front of the Rosary Basilica is known as &quot;Rosary Square&quot;. The entrances to the Upper Basilica and its crypt, both of which are built on top of the Massabielle rock, are far above ground level. To facilitate access, two enormous ramps were constructed, which curve down either side of Rosary Square. The image of the entrance of the Rosary Basilica, flanked by the two ramps and surmounted by the spires of the Upper Basilica, has become one of the iconic symbols of Lourdes, and a stylised form of this image has been adopted by the sanctuary itself as its logo.

=== Crown statue ===
The statue of the Crowned Virgin is a statue of Our Lady of Lourdes very similar to the statue in the grotto of Massabielle. It has been known as the &quot;crowned statue&quot; after its canonical coronation on 3 July 1876 by papal legate Pier Francesco Meglia. The statue stands across Rosary Square from the Rosary Basilica and faces the entrance. This prominent statue is a familiar landmark and a traditional meeting point. The statue is 2.5m high and cast in bronze, painted white and blue in the traditional colours. Her rosary is of the Birgittine style and incorporates six decades. Behind the Crowned Statue is the &quot;Esplanade&quot;, a large open walkway which is used for the processions.

=== Prairie ===

Across the Gave from the grotto is a wide, open, uncluttered space covered with grass and known in French as the &quot;prairie&quot;, or in English, the meadow. In the corner of the &quot;prairie&quot; is the tent-like chapel of adoration, consecrated in 1995 and given over entirely to adoration of the Blessed Sacrament. There is also an open-air altar for outdoor ceremonies. In 2002 the Water Walk was introduced, across the Gave and slightly downstream from the grotto. It consists of a series of nine stations of the Cross at which there is a small Lourdes water font.

=== Calvary ===

The sanctuary include a calvary built on the Espelugues hill, located south of the grotto and the basilicas. The Espelugues hill is separated from the central part of the sanctuary by the avenue Mgr Théas and the route de la Forêt. The Espelugues lands extending over the hill were acquired by the missionaries of Garaison, which were in charge of the sanctuary&#x27;s administration. The first station was built in 1901, and the calvary was inaugurated in 1912.

The stations of the Cross feature a total of 115 characters which are slightly larger than average human size. The calvary extends on a course of around , starting close to the Basilica of the Immaculate Conception and climbing up to the 13th station then descending back to the basilicas and the grotto. It includes the fourteen traditional stations of the passion of Christ and a fifteenth station, the resurrection of Christ, added in 1958. To reach the first station, a stone staircase of 28 steps is reminiscent of the Scala Sancta in Rome, with some pilgrims also climbing it and on their knees.

== Accommodation ==
Across the river from the grotto and the churches is the Accueil Notre Dame, a modern facility built in 1996 to house sick pilgrims during their time in Lourdes.

The Accueil Notre Dame was built to replace two older residencies for pilgrims. The old Accueil Notre Dame stood opposite the Underground Basilica, and has been extensively remodelled, being divided into two buildings by removing a section. One building now contains the Chapel of Reconciliation, which used to be the refectory, and also houses the convent of the Sisters of Charity of Nevers. The other section is now known as the Accueil John Paul II, and contains several chapels, the First Aid post and Dispensary, and the offices of the Hospitalité. The other was the Accueil St. Bernadette, which stood across the river from the old Accueil Notre Dame, and was demolished to make way for the new one.

Since Easter 1997 sick pilgrims from all over the world have been housed in the Accueil Notre Dame, an airy modern building. The Accueil is organised into two wings, each consisting of six storeys, with the Reception area on the ground floor and the Transit Lounge on the fifth. Each floor from one to four is named after a specific saint, with female saints honoured on one side and male ones on the other. Each floor has a central refectory area where pilgrims congregate to eat.

The rooms, each with bathroom and shower, accommodate from one to six people. Each room has a window, with some fortunate ones having a view of the grotto, and storage cupboards and a table and chairs. Each room opens onto a communal area.

Linking the two sides is the Administration Area, with two panoramic lifts bringing visitors to each floor. The administration offices are on the sixth and seventh floors, and there are kitchens for each side.

Typically, pilgrims arrive at the Accueil Notre Dame in specially adapted buses, either from Tarbes Airport or Lourdes train station, and will be welcomed in the transit lounge from where they are taken to their rooms.

Another residency, the Accueil Marie St. Frai, is located a short distance outside the sanctuary; it is similar in design and atmosphere to the Accueil Notre Dame.

== Criticism ==
Modern Lourdes contains many souvenir shops. Some visitors may dislike the commercialism of parts of Lourdes, with neon-emblazoned shops overflowing with what Malcolm Muggeridge, a supporter of the shrine, called &quot;tawdry relics, the bric-a-brac of piety&quot;. Bernadette herself despised any and all commercialization related to the apparitions. Lourdes has been called the &quot;Disneyland of the Catholic Church&quot;. Critics argue that the Lourdes phenomenon is nothing more than a significant money-spinner for the town and the region, which therefore has a strong vested interest in keeping the pilgrims coming. The Church, however, distances itself from commercialisation. The many stalls are privately owned, and hawkers are strictly forbidden inside the sanctuary.

<doc id="1086830" wikidata="Q1982067" url="?curid=1086830" title="Null-subject language">
<text>In linguistic typology, a null-subject language is a language whose grammar permits an independent clause to lack an explicit subject; such a clause is then said to have a null subject.

In the principles and parameters framework, the null subject is controlled by the pro-drop parameter, which is either on or off for a particular language.

Typically, null-subject languages express person, number, and/or gender agreement with the referent on the verb, rendering a subject noun phrase redundant.

For example, in Italian the subject &quot;she&quot; can be either explicit or implicit:

The subject &quot;(s)he&quot; of the second sentence is only implied in Italian. English and French, on the other hand, require an explicit subject in this sentence.

Null-subject languages include Arabic, most Romance languages, Chinese, Greek, Hebrew, the Indo-Aryan languages, Japanese, Korean, Persian, the Slavic languages, Tamil, and the Turkic languages.

== Characterization ==
Languages which are not null-subject languages usually require an explicit subject. English and French make an exception for the imperative mood, or where a subject is mentioned in the same sentence, one immediately preceding it, or where the subject is implied. These languages can sometimes drop pronouns in limited contexts: e.g, German for &quot;please&quot;, &quot;Bitte&quot;, literally means &quot;[I] beg&quot;, and in English &quot;Not happy!&quot; would be clearly understood as the first person singular &quot;&quot;I am&quot; not happy&quot;. Similarly, in some cases the additional inclusion of pronouns in English has equivalent force to their optional inclusion in Spanish or Italian: e.g, &quot;I cook, I wash up and I do the shopping&quot; is more emphatic than simply &quot;I cook, wash up and do the shopping&quot;.

Subjects may sometimes be dropped in colloquial speech where the subject is implied.

In the framework of government and binding theory of syntax, the term &quot;null subject&quot; refers to an empty category. The empty category in question is thought to behave like an ordinary pronoun with respect to anaphoric reference and other grammatical behavior. Hence it is most commonly referred to as &quot;pro&quot;.

This phenomenon is similar, but not identical, to that of pro-drop languages, which may omit pronouns, including subject pronouns, but also object pronouns. While all pro-drop languages are null-subject languages, not all null-subject languages are pro-drop.

In null-subject languages that have verb inflection in which the verb inflects for person, the grammatical person of the subject is reflected by the inflection of the verb and likewise for number and gender.

==Examples==

The following examples come from Portuguese:

*&quot;I&#x27;m going home&quot; can be translated either as &quot; or as &quot;, where &quot;eu&quot; means &quot;I&quot;.
*&quot;It&#x27;s raining&quot; can be translated as (Brazilian Portuguese) or (European Portuguese). In Portuguese, as in most other Romance languages (but not all, French is a notable exception), there is no exact equivalent for the pronoun &quot;it&quot;. However, some older persons say (European Portuguese) which directly translates to &quot;He is raining&quot;.
*&quot;I&#x27;m going home. I&#x27;m going to watch TV&quot; would not, except in exceptional circumstances, be translated as At least the subject of the second sentence should be omitted in Portuguese unless one wishes to express emphasis, as to emphasize the &quot;I&quot;.

As the examples illustrate, in many null-subject languages, personal pronouns exist and can be used for emphasis but are dropped whenever they can be inferred from the context. Some sentences do not allow a subject in any form while, in other cases an explicit subject without particular emphasis, would sound awkward or unnatural.

Most Bantu languages are null-subject. For example, in Ganda, &#x27;I&#x27;m going home&#x27; could be translated as or as , where means &#x27;I&#x27;.

=== Albanian === 
===Arabic===
Arabic is considered a null-subject language, as demonstrated by the following example:

Subject information for &#x27;they&#x27; is encoded in the conjugation of the verb .

===Azerbaijani===
===Bulgarian===
===Catalan/Valencian===
In Catalan/Valencian, as in Spanish, Portuguese, Galician, etc., the subject is also encoded in the verb conjugation. Pronoun use is not obligatory.
* &quot;(Nosaltres) Anem a la platja&quot;: We go to the beach.
* &quot;(Tu) Ets la meva amiga&quot;: You are my friend.
* &quot;(Vostès/vosaltres) No són/sou benvinguts aquí&quot;: You are not welcome here.
* &quot;(Ells) Estan dormint&quot;: They are asleep.
* &quot;(Jo) Necessito ajuda&quot;: I need help.
* &quot;(Ell) És a la seva habitació&quot;: He is in his bedroom.
* &quot;(Ella) Està cansada&quot;: She is tired.

In Catalan/Valencian, one may choose whether to use the subject or not. If used in an inclined tone, it may be seen as an added emphasis; however, in colloquial speaking, usage of a pronoun is optional. Even so, sentences with a null subject are used more frequently than sentences with a subject. In some cases, it is even necessary to skip the subject to create a grammatically correct sentence.

===Chinese===
Most varieties of Chinese tend to be non-null-subject. Verbs in Chinese languages are not conjugated, so it is not possible to determine the subject based on the verb alone. However, in certain circumstances, most Chinese varieties allow dropping of the subject, thus forming null-subject sentences. One of the instances where the subject would be removed is when the subject is known. Below is an example in Mandarin:

The above example clearly shows that a speaker could omit the subject if the doer of the verb is known. In a Chinese imperative sentence, like the first text, the subject is also left out.

===Galician===
In Galician, as in Spanish, Portuguese, Catalan, etc., the subject is also encoded in the verb conjugation. Pronoun use is not obligatory.
* &quot;(Nós) Imos á praia&quot;: We go to the beach.
* &quot;(Ti) E-la miña amiga&quot;: You are my friend. (Informal singular)
* &quot;(Vós) Non sodes benvidos aquí&quot;: You are not welcome here. (Informal Plural)
* &quot;(Eles) Están durmindo&quot;: They are sleeping.
* &quot;(Eu) Necesito axuda&quot;: I need help.
* &quot;(El) Está no seu cuarto&quot;: He is in his bedroom.
* &quot;(Ela) Está cansada&quot;: She is tired.

In Galician, one may choose whether to use the subject or not. If used in an inclined tone, it may be seen as an added emphasis; however, in colloquial speaking, usage of a pronoun is optional. Even so, sentences with a null subject are used more frequently than sentences with a subject. In some cases, it is even necessary to skip the subject to create a grammatically correct sentence.

===Modern Greek===
&quot;Εγώ(Egó)&quot;, which means &quot;I&quot;,has been omitted. The conjugation has encoded them,

===Hebrew===
Hebrew is considered a partially null-subject language, as demonstrated by the following example:

Subjects can usually be omitted only when the verb is conjugated for grammatical person, as in the third-person plural in the example above.
In Hebrew one can also construct null-subject sentences as in the Latin and Turkish language examples: &quot;We/you/they are going to the beach&quot; can be expressed as &quot;holkhim la-yam&quot; (הולכים לים), lit. &quot;Are going to the beach.&quot; This is truly a null-subject construction.

As in Spanish and Turkish, though, Hebrew conjugates verbs in accordance with specific pronouns, so &quot;we went to the beach&quot; is technically just as much a null-subject construction as in the other languages, but in fact the conjugation does indicate the subject pronoun: &quot;Halakhnu la-yam&quot; (הלכנו לים), lit. &quot;Went (we) to the beach.&quot; The word &quot;halakhnu&quot; means &quot;we went&quot;, just as the Spanish and Turkish examples indicate the relevant pronoun as the subject in their conjugation. So these should perhaps not be considered to be true null-subject phrases. Potentially confusing the issue further is the fact that Hebrew word order can also make some sentences appear to be null-subject, when the subject is in fact given after the verb. For instance, &quot;it&#x27;s raining&quot; is expressed &quot;yored geshem&quot; (יורד גשם), which means &quot;descends rain&quot;; &quot;rain&quot; is the subject. The phrases meaning &quot;It&#x27;s snowing&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s hailing&quot; are formed in the same way.

=== Hindustani ===
The Hindustani language shows radical pro-drop. This type of pro-drop differs from pro-drop in languages like Spanish where pro-drop is licensed by rich verbal morphology. Radical pro-drop is possible only in NP languages. South Asian languages such as Hindustani, in general, have the ability to pro-drop any and all arguments. Here, the case is expressed in a morpheme that is independent from the stem, making the pro-drop possible. 



===Italian===


The conjugations of the root verbs (&quot;faccio&quot; for &quot;fare&quot;; &quot;chiama&quot; for &quot;chiamare&quot;) already imply the subject of the sentences.

===Japanese===
Japanese and several other null-subject languages are topic-prominent languages; some of these languages require an expressed topic in order for sentences to make sense. In Japanese, for example, it is possible to start a sentence with a topic marked by the particle &quot;は&quot;(read as &quot;wa&quot;, written as &quot;ha&quot;) and in subsequent sentences leave the topic unstated, as it is understood to remain the same, until another one is either explicitly or implicitly introduced. For example, in the second sentence below, the subject (&quot;we&quot;) is not expressed again but left implicit:

In other cases, the topic can be changed without being explicitly stated, as in the following example, where the topic changes implicitly from &quot;today&quot; to &quot;I&quot;.

It is also common for Japanese to omit things which are obvious in context. If the above line were part of a conversation about considering purchasing the game, it could be further shortened to:

===Latin===
Verb-conjugation endings in Latin express number and person (as well as tense and mood).

===Macedonian===
===Polish===
In Polish, the subject is omitted almost every time, although it can be present to put emphasis on the subject.

===Russian===
===Sindhi===
With subjects: آئون آيس، مون ڏٺو، آئون، کٽيس
Idiomatic translation: I came, I saw, I conquered.

===Spanish===
In Spanish, as with Latin and most Romance languages, the subject is encoded in the verb conjugation. Pronoun use is not obligatory.
* : I need help.
* : You (informal) are my friend.
* : You (informal) are my friend.
* : You (formal) see me.
* : He is in his bedroom.
* : She is tired.
* : We go to the beach.
* : You (plural, informal) should leave.
* : You (plural) are not welcome here.
* : They are asleep.
* : They (feminine) go there.

In Spanish, for the most part one may choose whether to use the subject or not. Generally if a subject is provided, it is either for clarity or for emphasis. Sentences with a null subject are used more frequently than sentences with a subject.

===Tamil===
Verb conjugations in Tamil incorporate suffixes for number (singular and plural) and person (1st, 2nd and 3rd), and also for gender (masculine, feminine and neuter) in the third person. An explicit subject, therefore, is unnecessary, and can be inferred from the verb conjugation.

Tamil script: முடிந்துவிட்டது Transliteration: muḍinduviṭṭaduLiteral Translation: It has left, having ended.Idiomatic Translation: It has come to an end.

==Impersonal constructions==
In some cases (impersonal constructions), a proposition has no referent at all. Pro-drop languages deal naturally with these, whereas many non-pro-drop languages such as English and French must fill in the syntactic gap by inserting a dummy pronoun. &quot;*Rains&quot; is not a correct sentence; a dummy &quot;it&quot; must be added: &quot;&quot;It rains&quot;; in French &quot;Il pleut&quot;. In most Romance languages, however, &quot;Rains&quot; can be a sentence: Spanish &quot;Llueve&quot;, Italian &quot;Piove&quot;, Catalan &quot;Plou&quot;, Portuguese &quot;Chove&quot;, Romanian &quot;Plouă&quot;, etc. Uralic and Slavic languages also show this trait: Finnish &quot;Sataa&quot;, Hungarian &quot;Esik&quot;; Polish &quot;Pada&quot;&quot;.

There are constructed languages that are not pro-drop but do not require this syntactic gap to be filled. For example, in Esperanto, &quot;He made the cake&quot; would translate as &quot;Li faris la kukon&quot; (never &quot;*Faris la kukon&quot;), but &quot;It rained yesterday&quot; would be &quot;Pluvis hieraŭ&quot; (not &quot;*Ĝi pluvis hieraŭ&quot;).

==Null subjects in non-null-subject languages==
Other languages (sometimes called non-null-subject languages) require each sentence to include a subject: this is the case for most Germanic languages, including English and German, as well as many other languages. French, though a Romance language, also requires a subject. In some cases—particularly in English, less so in German, and occasionally in French—colloquial expressions allow for the omission of the subject in a manner similar to that of Spanish or Russian:

:&quot;[&quot;It&quot;] Sounds good.&quot; 
:&quot;[&quot;I&quot;] Bumped into George this morning.&quot; 
:&quot;[&quot;We&quot;] Agreed to have a snifter to catch up on old times.&quot; 
:&quot;[&quot;We&quot;] Can, must, and shall fight.&quot;
:&quot;[&quot;You&quot;] Went down to Brighton for the weekend?&quot; 

===The imperative form===
Even in such non-null-subject languages such as English, it is standard for clauses in the imperative mood to lack explicit subjects; for example:
:&quot;Take a break—you&#x27;re working too hard.&quot;
:&quot;Shut up!&quot;
:&quot;Don&#x27;t listen to him!&quot;

An explicit declaration of the pronoun in the imperative mood is typically reserved for emphasis:
:&quot;You stay away!&quot;
:&quot;Don&#x27;t you listen to him!&quot;

French and German offer less flexibility with respect to null subjects. 

In French, it is neither grammatically correct nor possible to include the subject within the imperative form; the &quot;vous&quot; in the expression &quot;taisez-vous&quot; stems from the fact that &quot;se taire&quot;, &quot;to be silent,&quot; is a reflexive verb and is thus the object with similar meaning to &quot;yourself&quot; in an English imperative.

In German, the pronoun (singular &quot;du&quot; or plural &quot;ihr&quot;) is normally omitted from the informal second-person imperative (&quot;Mach das&quot;, &quot;Do it&quot;), although it may be added in a colloquial manner for emphasis (&quot;Macht ihr das!&quot;, &quot;&quot;You [guys]&quot; do it!&quot;). By contrast, the addressee-specific formal imperative requires the addition of the pronoun &quot;Sie&quot; (as in &quot;Machen Sie das!&quot;, &quot;Do it, [sir/ma&#x27;am]!&quot;) to avoid confusion with the otherwise morphologically identical infinitive, whereas the addressee-nonspecific or &quot;neutral&quot; formal imperative omits the pronoun and moves the verb to final position (as in &quot;Bitte nicht stören&quot;, &quot;Please do not disturb&quot;). On the other hand, the pronoun &quot;wir&quot; is always included in the first-person plural imperative (&quot;Machen wir das!&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s do it!&quot;), with the verb appearing in first position to differentiate the imperative from the indicative mood, wherein the verb appears in second position (as in &quot;Wir machen das&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re doing it&quot;).

== Auxiliary languages ==

Many international auxiliary languages, while not officially pro-drop, permit pronoun omission with some regularity.

===Interlingua===
In Interlingua, pronoun omission is most common with the pronoun &quot;il&quot;, which means &quot;it&quot; when referring to part of a sentence or to nothing in particular. Examples of this word include
:Il pluvia.
:&quot;It&#x27;s raining.&quot;
:Il es ver que ille arriva deman.
:&quot;It is true that he arrives tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Il&quot; tends to be omitted whenever the contraction &quot;it&#x27;s&quot; can be used in English. Thus, &quot;il&quot; may be omitted from the second sentence above: &quot;Es ver que ille arriva deman&quot;. In addition, subject pronouns are sometimes omitted when they can be inferred from a previous sentence:

:Illa audiva un crito. Curreva al porta. Aperiva lo.
:&quot;She heard a cry. Ran to the door. Opened it.&quot;

===Esperanto===
Similarly, Esperanto sometimes exhibits pronoun deletion in casual use. This deletion is normally limited to subject pronouns, especially where the pronoun has been used just previously:

In &quot;official&quot; use, however, Esperanto admits of null-subject sentences in two cases only:
* (optional) in the 2nd person imperative &quot;(N.B. The Esperanto imperative is often named &quot;volitive&quot; instead, since it can be conjugated with a subject in any person, and also used in subordinate clauses)&quot;
*: Venu! &quot;Come!&quot;
*: Vi venu! &quot;You [there], come [with me]!&quot; (pronoun added for emphasis)
* For &quot;impersonal verbs&quot; which have no semantic subject. In English or French, an &quot;empty&quot; subject is nevertheless required:
*: Pluvas. It is raining.&quot; FR: Il pleut.&quot;
*: Estas nun somero. It is summer now.&quot; FR: C&#x27;est l&#x27;été à présent.&quot;
*: Estas vere, ke li alvenos morgaŭ. It is true that he will arrive tomorrow.&quot; FR: C&#x27;est vrai qu&#x27;il arrivera demain.&quot;
*:: &quot;(In this latter case, the sentence is not really no-subject, since &quot;ke li alvenos morgaŭ&quot; (&quot;that he will arrive tomorrow&quot;) is the subject.)&quot;

Contrary to the Interlingua example above, and as in English, a repeated subject can normally be omitted only within a single sentence:
: Ŝi aŭdis krion. Ŝi kuris al la pordo. Ŝi malfermis ĝin.
:: &quot;She heard a shout. She ran to the door. She opened it.&quot;
: Ŝi aŭdis krion, kuris al la pordo kaj malfermis ĝin.
:: &quot;She heard a shout, ran to the door and opened it.&quot;

<doc id="1086831" wikidata="Q1267727" url="?curid=1086831" title="Dustin Nguyen">
<text>Dustin Nguyen (born Nguyễn Xuân Trí) is a Vietnamese–American actor and martial artist. He is best known for his roles as Harry Truman Ioki on &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; and as Johnny Loh on &quot;V.I.P.&quot; Recently, he starred as Zing in the Cinemax/Max martial arts crime drama series &quot;Warrior&quot;. In film, he is known for starring in &quot;Little Fish&quot;, &quot;The Doom Generation&quot; and &quot;The Rebel&quot;.

==Early life==
Nguyen was born Nguyễn Xuân Trí in Saigon, South Vietnam, and was one of two sons in his family. His mother, My Le, was an actress and dancer, and his father, Xuân Phát, was an actor, comedian, writer, and producer in Vietnam. The family left Vietnam in April 1975 during the fall of Saigon.

In his teens, his family arrived in Guam as refugees, and then the family was moved to a refugee camp in Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. Finally with the assistance of a Methodist church they relocated to Des Peres, Missouri, a suburb of St. Louis. The &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; season 2 episode &quot;Christmas in Saigon&quot;, which first aired in December 1987, is based in his experiences escaping Vietnam and eventually arriving in the United States; Nguyen also served as a technical advisor in the episode.

Nguyen graduated from Garden Grove High School in Garden Grove, California, he attended Orange Coast College and majored in communications but later dropped out to pursue acting full time.

Nguyen practices several martial arts including Muay Thai, Tae Kwon Do, Eskrima, and Jeet Kune Do.

==Career==
He made his acting debut on &quot;Magnum, P.I.&quot;, portraying a Cambodian freedom fighter in the episode &quot;All For One.&quot; He was a series regular on both &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; and &quot;VIP&quot;, and has guest-starred on a number of other series, including &quot;General Hospital&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and most notably &quot;seaQuest DSV&quot;, playing the role of Chief William Shan. Moreover, he had a cameo role in &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot;. Nguyen also auditioned for the role of Liu Kang in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, but lost out to Robin Shou. In 1993 he played a Vietnamese man sent off to fight with the Viet Cong, in the film &quot;Heaven &amp; Earth&quot;. In 2005, Nguyen starred as a former heroin addict opposite Academy Award-winner Cate Blanchett in the critically acclaimed &quot;Little Fish&quot;. He starred in the 2007 films &quot;The Rebel&quot; and &quot;Saigon Eclipse&quot;. In 2008 he starred in the Vietnamese martial art film &quot;Huyen Thoai Bat Tu&quot; (The Legend Is Alive, The Immortal Legend) where he plays a mentally disabled martial artist. Nguyen screened in 2009 the thriller &quot;The Gauntlet&quot; directed by Matt Eskandari; he stars with Chinese actress Bai Ling. He made a small cameo in &quot;22 Jump Street&quot; as Vietnamese Jesus.

Nguyen continues to act and make films in Vietnam full-time. He made his feature directorial debut in the Vietnamese fantasy film &quot;Once Upon a Time in Vietnam&quot;, in which he also starred. He then starred in the Vietnamese film &quot;Gentle&quot; that premiered at the 2015 Busan International Film Festival where he received strong reception for his performance.

He was cast in Cinemax&#x27;s &quot;Warrior&quot; in a recurring role before he officially joined the main cast in season two of the series.

Nguyen also was cast in &quot;The Accidental Getaway Driver&quot; which premiered at the 2023 Sundance Film Festival.

==Personal life==
After a car accident late at night that occurred on September 3, 2001, on California&#x27;s Interstate 5 Highway between San Francisco and Los Angeles during a Labor Day weekend which left his fiancée, Angela Rockwood, a paraplegic, Nguyen and Rockwood became active in The Christopher and Dana Reeve Paralysis Resource Center. The accident also claimed the life of Vietnamese actress Thuy Trang, a member of the original cast of &quot;Mighty Morphin Power Rangers&quot; as the original Yellow Ranger, Trini. He and Rockwood divorced in 2012.

Nguyen is based in Vietnam full-time. In 2012, he married Vietnamese actress-model Bebe Pham with whom he has four daughters.

He is fluent in English and Vietnamese.

<text>Narrow Water Castle (; Ulster-Scots: &quot;Narra Wattèr Castle&quot;) is a 16th-century tower house and bawn near Warrenpoint in Northern Ireland. It is beside the A2 road and on the County Down bank of the Clanrye (Newry) River, which enters Carlingford Lough a mile to the south. It is a historic monument in state care in the townland of Narrow Water, in Newry and Mourne District Council district, at grid ref: J1256 1939.

==History==

Originally the site of a 13th century Norman keep (associated with Hugh de Lacy), a replacement tower house and bawn was built at Narrow Water (by the Magennis family) in the 16th century. The replacement structure, built in the 1560s, was a typical example of the tower houses built throughout Ireland at the time. This kind of building, often rectangular in plan and three or more storeys high, comprised a series of superimposed chambers, with stairs, closets and latrines built within the walls (which are 1.5 metres or five feet thick in places).

The castle was damaged during the Irish Rebellion of 1641, and sold to the Hall family in the 1670s. It was occupied by the Hall family until they built an &quot;Elizabethan revival style&quot; mansion (also called &quot;Narrow Water Castle&quot;) in the early 19th century.

The original (16th century) Narrow Water Castle keep was given into state care in 1956. The more recent (19th century) mansion remains a private residence of the Hall family.

On 27 August 1979, 18 British Army soldiers were killed by a Provisional IRA ambush near Narrow Water Castle (see Narrow Water ambush). It was the greatest single loss of life for the British Army during The Troubles.

A bridge was proposed to be built near the castle in the early 21st century. However, in July 2013, Louth County Council announced that the projected costs were prohibitive and the project was not progressed at that stage. In 2023, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar committed to examining the feasibility of co-funding a Narrow Water Bridge.

<doc id="1086860" wikidata="Q7562486" url="?curid=1086860" title="Sony HiFD">
<text>The Sony HiFD (High capacity Floppy Disk) was a high-capacity floppy disk system developed by Sony and Fujifilm and introduced in late 1998. Development and sale of the drives was discontinued by early 2001.

Announced in October 1997, HiFD disks offered a capacity of 200 MB while maintaining backwards compatibility with standard 720 KB and 1.44 MB diskettes. Sony initially planned to begin shipping the drives in the first half of 1998, however, the introduction was delayed until the end of the year. TEAC and Alps also planned to introduce HiFD drives. The first drives to reach the public were external parallel port models priced at $199. An internalATA version was later offered, with a SCSI version planned but never launched. IBM offered an internal HiFD drive as an option on some of its workstations in 2000.

Its immediate competitors were the popular Iomega Zip drive, which had a capacity of 100 MB and Imation&#x27;s Laser-Servo LS-120 SuperDisk, which had a capacity of 120 MB and like HiFD was also compatible with existing floppy disk formats. Many observers confidently predicted that the HiFD would swiftly take over the market, and ultimately replace the floppy drive.

This did not happen, however. A few months after launch it emerged that the HiFD suffered from frequent crashes during read/write operations, and had a tendency of having its read rate drop into the low kilobyte per second range, effectively rendering it unusable. Initially it was thought that a new driver could solve these problems – instead, Sony issued a full recall at the start of the following year.

The HiFD was re-released in November 1999, using a USB connection for the external drive. The whole affair gave the HiFD a reputation for being unreliable, and by this time the Zip drive now sported a 250 MB capacity and CD-RW drives were entering the mainstream. These factors doomed the second HiFD to failure.

<doc id="1086865" wikidata="Q284348" url="?curid=1086865" title="Mexborough">
<text>Mexborough is a town in the City of Doncaster District, South Yorkshire, England, between Manvers and Denaby Main, on the River Don close to where it joins the River Dearne, and the A6023 road. It is contiguous with Swinton to the southwest and Conisbrough to the east. 

Historically part of the West Riding of Yorkshire, Mexborough had a population of 15,244 at the 2011 Census.

==Topnym==
The name of &quot;Mexborough&quot; is a combination of an Old English or Old Norse personal name, which may be &quot;Meke&quot;, &quot;Muik&quot;, &quot;Meoc&quot; or &quot;Mjukr&quot;, and the suffix &quot;burh&quot;, meaning a fortified place in Anglo-Saxon Old English.

==History==
Mexborough is located at the north-eastern end of a dyke known as the &quot;Roman Ridge&quot;, which is thought to have been constructed either by the Brigantian tribes in the 1st century AD, perhaps as a defence against the Roman invasion of Britain, or after the 5th century to defend the British kingdom of Elmet from the Angles.

The earliest known written reference to Mexborough is found in the Domesday Book of 1086 (&quot;Mechesburg&quot;), which states that before the Norman Conquest of England the area had been controlled by the Saxon lords Wulfheah and Ulfkil. Following the Conquest, the area fell under the control of the Norman Baron Roger de Busli. The remains of an earthwork in Castle Park are thought to have been a motte-and-bailey castle constructed in the 11th century shortly after the Conquest.
St John the Baptist&#x27;s Church includes elements that date from the 12th century. A few other pre-1800 buildings remain, including several public houses: the Ferryboat Inn, the George and Dragon, the Bull&#x27;s Head and the Red Lion. Most of the buildings in the town are post-1800.

Throughout the 18th, 19th and much of the 20th century the town&#x27;s economy was based around coal mining, quarrying, brickworks and the production of ceramics, and it soon became a busy railway junction. These industries led to an increase in industrial illness and an increase in the mortality rate. Although the town boasted a cottage hospital, the lack of suitable facilities led to Lord Montagu donating land for a new hospital to be built. Lord Montagu laid the first stone at the site in 1904. The site is still a working hospital, which now forms part of the Doncaster and Bassetlaw NHS trust.

The industries that led to the creation of Montagu Hospital not only brought problems to the town but also led to an increase in population and, for some, an increase in wealth and opportunity. Many more public houses and other businesses were created, many of which are still trading today. It was in one of these public houses, the Montagu Arms, that Stan Laurel stayed overnight after performing at the town&#x27;s Prince of Wales Theatre on 9 December 1907.

During the second half of the 19th century, as in many other industrial towns, a Cooperative Society was formed in Mexborough. It was modelled on the consumer cooperative set up by the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844. In 1861, nine working men met at the home of James Simpson in Mexborough and decided to form the Mexborough Working Men&#x27;s Industrial Society (later renamed the Mexborough Cooperative Society). The aim of the Society was to supply (at first to the nine men themselves) the necessary things of life. Membership quickly grew and by the 1890s it stood at 1,200. At one time, there were ten shops across the built-up area of Mexborough. By 1903, land had been purchased in the middle of Mexborough on which to build a large and grand new central store, but then suddenly in 1904 the Mexborough Cooperative Society went into liquidation. Soon afterwards it was taken over by the Barnsley British Co-operative Society. One of Mexborough&#x27;s landmarks is closely associated with the Cooperative Society. This is the former Barnsley British Cooperative Society flour mill, which stands on the north side of the River Don Navigation, close to the Church of St John the Baptist. It started off as the &quot;Don Roller Mills&quot;. It was owned by James White, who sold it to the Barnsley British Cooperative Society in 1912.

For more than a hundred years the railway locomotive maintenance and stabling depot (colloquially known as &quot;Mexborough Loco&quot;) was a major employer. The South Yorkshire, Doncaster and Goole Railway arrived in Mexborough in 1850. The extensive coal traffic generated by the local collieries required railway locomotives to haul it and these locomotives required driving, firing, refuelling, maintenance and stabling. Mexborough was chosen as the site for a large 15-road depot. In its heyday it had an allocation of about 150 locomotives. In the 1920s it was the stabling point for the LNER Garratt, then the most powerful locomotive in the UK. The depot closed in 1964. Following the demise of coal-mining in the 1980s, Mexborough, like many ex-mining towns and villages, is still in the process of economic and social recovery.

===Ceramics===
The Rock Pottery originally operated as Beevers &amp; Ford. In 1839 it was bought by James Reed, whose son John renamed the business the &quot;Mexborough Pottery&quot;, and expanded the works. On the bankruptcy of the Rockingham Pottery in 1842, John Reed bought many of its moulds and continued their production, though with different transfer prints and also in a plain green with a leaf design impressed &quot;Reed&quot;.

==Politics==

Before 2010, Mexborough was in the Barnsley East and Mexborough constituency. Since then, it has been in the Doncaster North constituency, whose current MP is Ed Miliband, former leader of the Labour Party.

Local party Mexborough First did hold all three seats in the Mexborough ward on Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council but following the defection of Bev Chapman to Labour it (Mexborough First) only holds two seats.

In late 2023, Glenn Bluff, Doncaster City Councillor for neighbouring Adwick-on-Dearne in the Sprotbrough ward and Parish Councillor for Neighbouring Barnburgh and Harlington announced he was standing against sitting MP Ed Miliband in the next General Election and one of his first priorities was a town council for Mexborough, a concept known locally as Mexit. In December 2023, a meeting was held and jointly hosted by Bev Chapman and Glenn Bluff, from opposing parties to push forward the concept of a town council that has since received local support and has a facebook page.

==Transport==

===Rail===

Mexborough railway station is located on the south bank of the River Don on Station Road, a short cul-de-sac off the A6023 Greens Way dual carriageway on the south side of the town. It is served by local stopping trains towards and , operated by Northern Trains, with generally an hourly service in each direction.
===Bus===

Mexborough also has a bus station in the town centre, Mexborough Interchange, operated by Travel South Yorkshire. The Interchange is located between the A6023 Greens Way dual carriageway, John Street, Main Street and Hartley Street, around from Mexborough High Street and on foot from Mexborough railway station.

The bus station consists of three stands (numbered A1–A3) located in a bus-only lay-by on the northern side of the eastbound carriageway of Greens Way, a single stand (numbered B1) at a right angle to these accessed from John Street, and three stands (numbered HS1–HS3) situated a short distance away at the side of Hartley Street. The three sets of stands are in close proximity, linked by car parks and pathways. The majority of bus routes traverse Mexborough town centre on a one-way loop, with the Greens Way stops serving routes heading generally eastbound towards Doncaster and the Hartley Street stops serving westbound services towards Barnsley and Rotherham.

Mexborough Interchange was built by the South Yorkshire Passenger Transport Executive in the early 1990s, replacing bus stops in both directions on the High Street which was subsequently pedestrianised. When the Interchange first opened, there was a staffed ticket office and indoor waiting area with toilet facilities located in a small building between the Greens Way stands and John Street. However, around the time of the beginning of the Great Recession, the staffed ticket office was closed and all facilities inside were sealed off as an austerity measure. , the stand allocation is:

==Education==
Mexborough has one secondary school (Laurel Academy) and many primary schools.

<text>Paolo Vanoli (; born 12 August 1972) is an Italian professional football coach and a former player who played as a left back or left midfielder. He is the head coach of club Torino.

==Club career==
Vanoli played for many clubs, including Hellas Verona, Parma, and Fiorentina (for 9 billion lire fee in co-ownership deal; €4.648 million), having also two spells abroad: Scottish Premier League club Rangers from August 2003 to January 2005, scoring once against Dundee, and Akratitos in Greece (2005–06).

While at Parma, Vanoli won both the UEFA Cup and Coppa Italia in 1999, and then in 2001 won the Coppa Italia again with Fiorentina, this time beating his former team Parma in the final. Vanoli scored in all three finals.

==International career==
Vanoli was also an Italian international, playing twice and scoring once on his debut in a 3–1 defeat against Belgium in 1999.

==Managerial career==
Between 2016 and 2017, Vanoli was the assistant manager of the Italy national team. He was then appointed as assistant manager of Chelsea, serving in the role from 2017 to 2018.

On 17 December 2021, Vanoli joined Spartak Moscow as manager, signing a contract until the end of the 2022–23 season. On 29 May 2022, Spartak won the 2021–22 Russian Cup. The club announced on 9 June 2022 that Vanoli had left his post, citing a number of circumstances &quot;beyond the club&#x27;s control,&quot; in other words, the Russian Invasion of Ukraine, even though first in March he announced he would continue.

On 7 November 2022, Vanoli was hired as the new head coach of Serie B struggling club Venezia, signing a contract until 30 June 2024. In his second season in charge, Vanoli guided Venezia to Serie A promotion after defeating Cremonese in a two-legged playoff. On 20 June 2024, Vanoli and Venezia parted ways by mutual consent.

<doc id="1086884" wikidata="Q5540572" url="?curid=1086884" title="George Hewison">
<text>George Hewison (born 1944) is a Canadian folk singer, trade unionist and former politician. He was formerly a long-time member of the Communist Party of Canada and served as the party&#x27;s general secretary from 1988 to 1992.

==Early life==
Hewison&#x27;s father, &quot;Jack&quot; Hewison, immigrated to Canada from Scotland and settled in Campbell River, British Columbia, where he worked as a fisherman and became secretary of his union local. He was a founding member of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation but became disillusioned with the CCF during the Cold War. He joined the Labor-Progressive Party (as the Communist Party was known) in 1953 after CCF leaders supported a raid by Hal Banks and the Seafarers International Union against Hewison&#x27;s union, the United Fishermen and Allied Workers&#x27; Union. Prior to the raid, the UFAWU had been expelled from the Trades and Labour Congress of Canada because of its Communist leadership.

Hewison grew up in Campbell River, British Columbia, selling the party press and joined the Communist Party and the fishermen&#x27;s union at the age of 17. He grew up in a musical family before television and made his first public performance when his voice changed from soprano to bass in 1960. In addition to his labour and political activism, Hewison has always seen music as an essential part of his life.

==Trade unionism==
In 1965 he became a full-time organizer for his union and in 1973, Hewison was elected business agent for the United Fishermen and Allied Workers Union in British Columbia, and became the union&#x27;s secretary-treasurer in 1977, remaining in the position until 1985 when he left the union to move to Toronto to become the labour secretary on the Communist Party&#x27;s Central Executive Committee.

While an officer of his union, Hewison represented west coast fishermen in bilateral government to government negotiations with the United States on boundary and fisheries issues. He headed many lobbies to the provincial and nation&#x27;s capital. As Vice President of the Vancouver and District Labour Council, he initiated the massive resistance to the 26 pieces of legislation brought forward by the British Columbia Social Credit Party government in 1983 that later evolved into &quot;Operation Solidarity&quot;. Throughout this period, he continued to use his voice and guitar as his favourite tools to advance the interests of working people.

==General Secretary of the CPC==
Hewison succeeded William Kashtan as general secretary of the Communist Party of Canada in 1988 at a time when the Communist world was being convulsed by Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s reforms in the Soviet Union. He was leader of the Canadian party when the USSR and the Soviet bloc collapsed. The Communist Party of Canada had long been relatively uncritical supporters of Moscow, not least Hewison himself, and was severely disoriented by the collapse of Soviet Communism in Eastern Europe. As a major discussion about the causes for the collapse of the Soviet Union and the significance for Communists in Canada and internationally opened, the leadership of the party under Hewison&#x27;s leadership began to increasingly question the legacy of Stalinism within the Party. The group was eventually challenged by a pro-Leninist faction, led by previous leader William Kashtan and future leaders Miguel Figueroa and Elizabeth Rowley among others, who accused him of &quot;revisionism.&quot;

Hewison was unanimously re-elected leader at the party&#x27;s next convention in 1992 which produced a new manifesto called &quot;Communists and the New Decade&quot; (1990s) and the slogan &quot;Its a good time to be a communist&quot;. A critical faction, however, was also elected by convention to the Party&#x27;s Central Committee, but were defeated in elections to top positions in the Party. They nevertheless continued to resist the direction the Hewison leadership was heading, which was opposed by a significant number of the Party membership especially in the Atlantic, Ontario, Manitoba and British Columbia, with Hewison&#x27;s main supporters in Quebec and Alberta.

==Party split==
Long-standing financial support from the Soviet Union to the Communist Party of Canada was discontinued, and later other business arrangements such as cultural-exchange deals from which the Party benefited helped created financial pressures on the party in terms of its ability to continue to finance a large staff, headquarters, maintain a print shop, a publishing house and two weekly newspapers (&quot;Canadian Tribune&quot; and &quot;Pacific Tribune&quot;). The leadership led by Hewison argued the Party was in financial crisis.

As the confrontation exploded in the Party, the pro-Leninist faction (led by Elizabeth Rowley) forced the Hewison group into court. Meanwhile the provincial conventions of the CPC in BC, Manitoba and Ontario voted-out the Hewison leadership. After strained years for the CPC an out-of-court settlement took place between the two sides, in which those siding with Hewison surrendered the Party&#x27;s name, but not the newspaper.

In the meantime, hundreds of party activists, frustrated with the paralytic debate between the factions, had left the party. During the inner-party crisis, the membership dropped from almost 2000 to about 800, which included many links with organized labour as well as the entire Party in Quebec and much of the Party organization in Alberta. The out-of-court settlement also mandated the splitting of the old party&#x27;s assets, with the out-going leadership undertaking to leave the Communist Party. The &quot;Canadian Tribune&quot; and the Cecil-Ross Society (a society with strict injunctions on use of funds) were allotted to the group around Hewison. Those funds were allocated according to the rules of the &quot;Societies Act&quot;.

==Cecil-Ross Society and musical career==
The Cecil-Ross Society leadership which left the party, as their critics had alleged, attempted to broaden the appeal for their press by dropping their previous ideological &quot;baggage&quot; and included other socialists. For a variety of reasons, the &quot;New Times&quot;, which was meant to be a broad left periodical, failed after only two issues. The Cecil-Ross Society in British Columbia also attempted to publish another magazine, &quot;Ginger&quot;, but it failed as well. Within a few years, the group folded and the remaining funds from the group were dispensed to the constituent parts throughout Canada.

Today, Hewison continues to play a role in the labour and progressive movements for which he was a part for half a century. He was recently honoured as a &quot;Pioneer of Labour&quot; by the Peterborough and District Labour Council. He has continued to link music with labour and social activism and is the founder and lead singer of the &quot;Rank n File Band&quot;, created by the Canadian Auto Workers union. He has produced five albums over a fifty years span, and has written scores of songs for, and performed at, conventions of virtually every major labour organization in the country.

Hewison has toured extensively and most recently performed at the Illawarra Folk Festival in Australia and the Mariposa Folk Festival and Miners Memorial weekend in Canada as well at Joe Hill&#x27;s birthplace in Gavle in Sweden. He has also performed and recorded with &quot;Joe Hill&quot; composer, Earl Robinson. His latest album is entitled &quot;Uncharted Waters&quot;. He also continues to study contemporary capitalism and conducts classes in political economy, blogging on his website.

<doc id="1086895" wikidata="Q426127" url="?curid=1086895" title="...But Seriously">
<text>...But Seriously is the fourth solo studio album by English drummer and singer-songwriter Phil Collins. It was released on 20 November 1989 in the United Kingdom by Virgin Records and by Atlantic Records in the United States. After Collins finished touring commitments with the rock band Genesis in 1987, the group entered a four-year hiatus, during which Collins starred in the feature film &quot;Buster&quot; (1988). By the spring of 1989, Collins had written material for a new solo album, which addressed more serious lyrical themes, like socio-economic and political issues, as opposed to his previous dance-oriented album, &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; (1985).

&quot;...But Seriously&quot; was a huge commercial success worldwide, reaching No. 1 in the UK and the US for 15 and 4 non-consecutive weeks, respectively. It was the best-selling album of 1990 in the UK, eventually selling 2.75 million copies there and 4 million in the US. The lead single, &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;, won a Grammy Award for Record of the Year. Collins supported the album with the Seriously, Live! World Tour in 1990. In 2016, the album was remastered with additional studio, live, and demo tracks, and updated artwork.

==Background==
In July 1987, Collins finished touring commitments with the band Genesis and resumed his solo career. He had scored a series of hit singles with his previous solo album &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; (1985) and with Genesis on &quot;Invisible Touch&quot; (1986), and recognised this period as &quot;severe danger of overkill&quot; due to the high amount of radio airplay the songs had received. To combat this, Collins took a year out solely from music and accepted a lead role in &quot;Buster&quot; (1988), a romantic comedy film based on the Great Train Robbery. Collins recorded &quot;Two Hearts&quot; and &quot;A Groovy Kind of Love&quot; for the soundtrack, which led to his belief that people thought his songs had become &quot;Very, very light. That wasn&#x27;t where I was coming from.&quot; When he started work on his next solo album, Collins deliberately shifted styles by addressing more serious issues in his lyrics and songs with greater depth than the dance-oriented approach for &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;. Some bits of music originated as far back as 1978. Primarily, Collins wrote and demoed the songs at his Old Croft home onto a 12-track recorder with piano, drum machine &amp; keyboards, then he did a guide vocal to improvise lyric and melody ideas. The lyrics for songs like &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; and &quot;That&#x27;s Just the Way It Is&quot; were developed around these initial vocal ideas.

==Production==
&quot;...But Seriously&quot; was recorded between April and October 1989 at The Farm in Chiddingfold, Surrey and A&amp;M Studios in Los Angeles, California. It was produced by Collins and Hugh Padgham, who had worked on his previous solo albums and with Genesis throughout the decade. The album saw Collins use a live drum kit in contrast with &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; which had greater use of a drum machine, although the Roland TR-808 did make a prominent appearance on the tracks &quot;That&#x27;s Just The Way It Is&quot;, &quot;Do You Remember?&quot; and &quot;Father to Son&quot;. He also prominently used keyboards and electric piano and fewer synthesisers. Collins made a conscious decision not to rely on vocal effects on the album as his previous recordings, including with Genesis, involved the use of a harmoniser and echo and he looked back on this as a way of hiding the perceived drawbacks he had about his singing. In the end, a small amount of reverb and delay for a slap echo effect were used.

Collins experienced difficulty in naming the album. The initial title was &quot;Serious Business&quot;, before Collins decided against the potential connotations of business or corporations that it may have on the public. As the title suggests, the album is a change of pace from the lighter tone of Collins&#x27;s previous work. Collins expanded his focus to the exploration of socio-economic and political themes. There is emotional turmoil underneath the polished studio production and many of the songs are unambiguous and unveiled in their melancholy. While incorporating political themes, &quot;...But Seriously&quot; does not abandon the theme of relationships. But unlike some of his earlier work, Collins takes a more mature and reflective approach when looking at the relationships in his life.

As with his previous albums Collins wrote the sleeve notes by hand because &quot;that&#x27;s all part of the personal statement&quot;; the exception being &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;. He wrote the text on the &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; single on the inbound from the album&#x27;s European press trip in November 1989.

==Songs==
Atlantic Records initially placed a sticker on the CD version that read &quot;Two bonus tracks&quot; which Collins disagreed with and clarified that they were &quot;extra&quot; songs. The sticker was changed accordingly. The album was a departure from the dance pop of the &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; album. Unlike &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;, this album was a pop-rock album, but also included various styles and influences, like R&amp;B, dance-pop, jazz, soul and gospel.

&quot;Hang in Long Enough&quot; is the opening track on the album. It is a dance-pop song, with influenced soul and rock, and talks about ambition.

&quot;That&#x27;s Just the Way It Is&quot; is an anti-war ballad about The Troubles in Northern Ireland and features David Crosby on backing vocals. Collins had wanted Crosby to perform on his first solo album &quot;Face Value&quot; (1981), but he was unavailable at the time. The two met at the Atlantic Records 40th Anniversary concert in 1988, and Crosby was keen to participate on the album. When recording moved to Los Angeles, Collins prepared several mixes of the songs that he wanted Crosby to sing on and recalled that Crosby &quot;did exactly what I expected him to do [...] He just picked a few notes out of the air that I would never have thought of&quot;. The B-side to the single was &quot;Broadway Chorus&quot;, the demo version of &quot;Something Happened on the Way to Heaven&quot;.

&quot;Do You Remember?&quot; has lyrics from the perspective of a man whose relationship is failing due to his lover&#x27;s neglect. It features Stephen Bishop on backing vocals.

&quot;Something Happened on the Way to Heaven&quot; was written by Collins and his longtime touring guitarist Daryl Stuermer. It was the last song written for the album and was originally for the Four Tops, but it was not delivered to the group as Collins wanted to keep it for himself by the time it was finished. While the song was being arranged in the studio in England, Stuermer had devised some chords for the chorus which resulted in Nathan East playing bass on the new parts as Sklar had left for the US.

&quot;Colours&quot; is a politically themed song condemning apartheid in South Africa and displays a progressive rock influence. It was originally titled &quot;Oh Mr. Botha, What Can We Do?&quot;, a reference to the English music hall song &quot;Oh! Mr Porter&quot;.

&quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot; is a gospel-influenced track that Collins said is the closest he had come to writing a blues song. It features Eric Clapton on lead guitar.

&quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; addresses the issue of homelessness. Its working title was &quot;Homeless&quot;. Among the inspirational sources for the song was Collins&#x27;s stay in Washington, D.C., while on tour and encountered homeless people by Capitol Hill trying to keep warm and the contradiction of the White House being so close by.

&quot;Heat on the Street&quot; is a political song about the abuse and violence in the street. The song has a pop-rock oriented sound.

Collins wrote in his autobiography &quot;I&#x27;m Not Dead&quot; that &quot;All of My Life&quot; is about his relationship with his late father and his regrets to not have more connection with him during his life. The song was a R&amp;B jazz ballad influenced. Steve Winwood is featured playing the Hammond organ on the song.

The album also features a sole instrumental track, &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;, which recalls the jazz-influenced instrumentals featured on his first two albums, &quot;Face Value&quot; and &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going&quot;.

&quot;Father to Son&quot; is a ballad about Collins&#x27;s relationship with his eldest son, Simon.

The closing track, &quot;Find a Way to My Heart&quot;, is a simple rock-sounding love song, though with a heavy horn section and a synthesized intro and coda. It was later used in the 1990 action film &quot;Fire Birds&quot;.

===Additional material===
Collins recorded three other songs that were released as B-sides to the album&#x27;s singles:

#&quot;That&#x27;s How I Feel&quot;
#&quot;You&#x27;ve Been in Love (That Little Bit Too Long)&quot;
#&quot;Around the World in 80 Presets&quot;

==Singles==

The album spawned six singles released between October 1989 and November 1990.

*&quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; – US #1, UK #2 (1989)
*&quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot; – US #3, UK #7 (1990)
*&quot;Something Happened on the Way to Heaven&quot; – US #4, UK #15 (1990)
*&quot;Do You Remember?&quot; – US #4 (1990)
* &quot;That&#x27;s Just The Way It Is&quot; – UK #26 (1990)
*&quot;Hang in Long Enough&quot; – US #23, UK #34 (1990)

In Canada, &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;, &quot;I Wish It Would Rain Down&quot;, &quot;Do You Remember?&quot;, and &quot;Something Happened on the Way to Heaven&quot; reached No. 1.

==Release==
In the UK, &quot;...But Seriously&quot; spent 15 non-consecutive weeks at No. 1, including the whole competitive Christmas season, and at the end of 1989 became the third best-selling album of the year in the country after only six weeks on sale. It became the best-selling album of 1990 in the UK. &quot;...But Seriously&quot; also peaked at No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for four weeks and became the second best-selling album of 1990 in the US, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. It was the last number one album of the 1980s and the first of the 1990s in the UK and in the US.

In Germany, it is the second best-selling album in the chart history of certified albums, and the best-selling album within the foreign repertoire.

==Critical reception==

In his review for AllMusic, Geoff Orens praised the decision to use more live instrumentation than &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;, saying &quot;there&#x27;s no doubt that tracks such as &#x27;Find a Way to My Heart&#x27; and &#x27;Hang in Long Enough&#x27; have enough bite to outlast his more dated sounding mid-80s material.&quot; He criticised the album for &quot;too many generic ballads&quot;, but added that &quot;when Collins moves out of his formula&quot;, citing &quot;the dramatic gospel-influenced &#x27;I Wish it Would Rain Down&#x27;, [...] the results are staggering.&quot; In 2014, Corey Deiterman wrote for &quot;Houston Press&quot;, &quot;One need only look at his album &quot;...But Seriously&quot; to see some of the blueprint for being serious without being boring. That album wasn&#x27;t perfect, by any means, and nowhere near as good as his preceding three records, but it allowed Collins to delve into serious subject matter and more serious musical territory while also retaining the sense of slick, fun pop he had traded in throughout the &#x27;80s.&quot;

Mark Beaumont, writing for &quot;NME&quot; in 2016, included it on his list of eight of the all-time best-selling albums in the UK to have &quot;no redeeming features whatsoever&quot;, calling the album the &quot;beginning of Collins&#x27; solo rot&quot; and particularly criticizing &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;.

==Accolades==

At the 33rd Annual Grammy Awards &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; won the award for Record of the Year. &quot;...But Seriously&quot; received further nominations for Album of the Year, Producer of the Year (Non-Classical) and Best Engineered Recording – Non-Classical. &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; was further nominated for Song of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male, while the instrumental piece &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot; was nominated for Best Pop Instrumental Performance.

&quot;...But Seriously&quot; received two American Music Awards for Favorite Pop/Rock Album and Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist.

At the Brit Awards in 1990 &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot; received the award for British Single, while Collins was named British Male Artist, for which he was nominated again a year later.

==Tour==
In support of the album, Collins&#x27; embarked on a worldwide tour, called Seriously Live!. In total, there were 113 shows over three continents and it led to the release of a live album and video &quot;Serious Hits... Live!&quot;.

==Track listing==
===CD and cassette===
===LP===
The vinyl release features a rearranged track listing and is missing two tracks from the CD/cassette version, &quot;Heat on the Street&quot; and the instrumental &quot;Saturday Night and Sunday Morning&quot;.

<text>Ragibagh (Mongolian: Рагибаха or Ражабаг; ; Arigabag), also known by his era name as the Tianshun Emperor of Yuan (), was a son of Yesün Temür (Taiding Emperor) who was briefly installed to the throne of the Yuan dynasty of China in Shangdu in 1328. Although he should have been the seventh ruler of the Yuan dynasty in succession to his father Yesün Temür, he was dethroned by his rival Tugh Temür (Emperor Wenzong) who was installed by a coup before Ragibagh&#x27;s succession. Apart from Emperor of China, he is regarded as the 11th Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, although it was only nominal due to the division of the empire. He was the shortest-reigning Yuan emperor.

== Life ==
Ragibagh was the eldest son of Yesün Temür. His mother Babukhan Khatun came from the Khunggirad clan, who had held power through marriage to the imperial family. He became Crown Prince at infancy in 1324. In August 1328 when Yesün Temür suddenly died in Shangdu, he was installed by the powerful Muslim officer Dawlat Shah there in the next month.

However, Yesün Temür&#x27;s sudden death triggered an uprising of an anti-mainstream faction who had been dissatisfied with monopolization of power by Yesün Temür&#x27;s aides including Dawlat Shah who had served him since he was stationed in Mongolia as Jinong. In the eighth month, the Mongolized Qipchaq commander El Temür, who was stationed in Dadu, launched a coup and called for installation of Khayishan&#x27;s son. Tugh Temür was welcomed into Dadu in the same month in which Ragibagh ascended to the throne.

The civil war known as the War of the Two Capitals soon broke out. Ragibagh&#x27;s army broke through the Great Wall at several points and advanced on Dadu; but was severely defeated by El Temür&#x27;s troops. At the time, most of Ragibagh&#x27;s army were involved on the Great Wall front, and the Shangdu court was compelled to surrender on the very next day. Dawlat Shah and most of the leading loyalists were taken prisoner and later executed by the Dadu faction after surrender; but Ragibagh is said to have disappeared after that, evidently murdered.

== Name ==
Due to scarcity of historical sources and their multilinguality, Ragibagh&#x27;s name has a lot of variants. The Tibetan &quot;Red Annals&quot; (Hu lān deb ther) calls him &quot;ra khyi phag&quot; (). The later Mongolian chronicles such as the &quot;Erdeni-yin tobchi&quot; and the &quot;Altan tobchi&quot; spell him Radzibaγ or Raǰibaγ. &quot;The History of the Yuan&quot; refers to him as A-su-ji-ba (阿速吉八), but it is apparently a misspelling of A-la-ji-ba (阿剌吉八). The initial &quot;a&quot; prevents the word from starting with &quot;r&quot; in Mongolian. It looks like a modern Mongolian painter Ts.Mandir interpreted his name as &quot;Asidkebe&quot; (Ашидхэв). According to some scholars, his name was from Sanskrit &quot;rāja-pika&quot; (), which means &quot;king cuckoo&quot;. He is also commonly known as the Tianshun Emperor based on his era name.

<text>Fairy painting is a genre of painting and illustration featuring fairies and fairy tale settings, often with extreme attention to detail, seen as escapism for Victorians. The genre is most closely associated with Victorian painting in the United Kingdom and has experienced a contemporary revival.

==Origins and influences==
Despite its whimsical appearance, fairy painting is strongly rooted in the literary and theatrical influences of Romanticism and the cultural issues facing the Victorian era. Among the most significant of these influences were the fantasy themes of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;. Other literary works, such as Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; and Alexander Pope&#x27;s mock-heroic &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;, have been cited as contributing influences as well. Innovations in stage production helped bring these works to the public eye, as the development of gaslight and improvements in wire-work led to increasingly elaborate special effects. Once described by Douglas Jerrold as &quot;a fairy creation that could only be acted by fairies&quot;, productions of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; became more common, eventually leading to an 1863 spectacle featuring Ellen Terry as Titania astride a mechanical mushroom.

Cultural changes were also an important factor during this period. Continuing industrialization was uprooting longstanding traditions, and rapid advances in science and technology, especially the invention of photography, left some people discomforted and confused. According to Jeremy Maas, the turn to mythological and fantasy elements, and in particular to the fairy&#x27;s world, allowed an escape from these demands. &quot;No other type of painting concentrates so many of the opposing elements of the Victorian psyche: the desire to escape the drear hardships of daily existence; the stirrings of new attitudes toward sex, stifled by religious dogma; a passion for the unseen; the birth of psychoanalysis; the latent revulsion against the exactitude of the new invention of photography.&quot; The significance of fairy paintings as a reaction to cultural change is not universally accepted, however. &quot;Ultimately,&quot; Andrew Stuttaford wrote, &quot;these paintings were just about fun.&quot;

==Victorian fairy painting==
The earliest artists considered to have contributed to the genre predate much of Romanticism and the Victorian era. Henry Fuseli and William Blake produced works that would be indicative of the later genre even before 1800. The artist most closely associated with fairy painting was outsider artist Richard Dadd, who was suspected to have schizophrenia and produced most of his work while incarcerated in the Bethlem psychiatric hospital for the murder of his father. Despite his status and condition, his fantastic subjects and extraordinarily detailed style were generally well-received, with one period reviewer describing his work as &quot;exquisitely ideal&quot;. He accompanied his masterpiece, &quot;The Fairy Feller&#x27;s Master-Stroke&quot;, which he painted from 1855 to 1864, with an elaborate poem which provides historical, literary, or mythological context to each of the depicted characters.

Fairy painting was not exclusively the domain of outside art. The work of John Anster Fitzgerald debuted at London&#x27;s Royal Academy. His work, a series of Christmas-themed fairy illustrations, received wider public visibility in the Illustrated London News. The Scottish artist Joseph Noel Paton exhibited two immensely detailed paintings, &quot;The Quarrel of Oberon and Titania&quot; and &quot;The Reconciliation of Titania and Oberon&quot;, based on the popular fairy scenes of &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Even Edwin Landseer, sometimes named &quot;Victoria&#x27;s favourite artist&quot;, produced a painting of Titania and Bottom in the genre&#x27;s style, his &quot;Scene from A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

The genre also influenced the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood and the movement it began. Co-founder John Everett Millais produced a series of fairy paintings based on &quot;The Tempest&quot;, ending with his 1849 work &quot;Ferdinand Lured by Ariel&quot;. Dante Gabriel Rossetti, another of the Brotherhood&#x27;s initial members, took a more sensual approach to the subject, in both painting and poetry. Others involved with the movement, such as Arthur Hughes and William Bell Scott, also contributed to the genre.

The Cottingley Fairies briefly revived interest in fae subjects, before the waning of Romanticism and the advent of World War I reduced interest in the styles and topics popular during the Victorian era. The illustrated fairy-tale books of Arthur Rackham are considered its &quot;final flowering&quot;.

==Modern revival==
The interest in fantasy art and literature since the 1970s has seen a revival in the topics and styles of Victorian fairy painting, often in novel contexts. While artists such as Stephanie Pui-Mun Law have produced genre illustrations for book covers and role-playing games, the works of Brian Froud, also known for a series of illustrated fairy books, have been adapted into several successful motion pictures including &quot;The Dark Crystal&quot; (1982) and &quot;Labyrinth&quot; (1986). The concept design work of Alan Lee and John Howe for &quot;The Lord of the Rings (film series)&quot;(2001–03), for which the former won an Oscar, would change popular perceptions of the depiction of fairy cultures. The 2003 book, &quot;The Art of Faery&quot;, written by David Riche and mentored by Froud, contributed to the careers of twenty fairy artists of this revival movement, including Amy Brown, Myrea Pettit, Jasmine Becket-Griffith, Philippe Fernandez, James Browne, and Jessica Galbreth, many of whom went on to author individual art books. Depictions of fae have made their way into popular culture in other ways, including clothing designs, ceramics, figurines, needlecraft, figurative art, and quilting, many marketed through Hot Topic to an international market online. Part of the growth in popularity over the past three decades is due to the New Age Movement. Renaissance fairs and science fiction conventions have also developed modern fairy art as a genre of collectibles.

<text>Sundorne is a suburb of the town of Shrewsbury, county town of Shropshire. It is located 2 km north of the town centre. The B5062 road begins at Heathgates Roundabout and is called Sundorne Road in the Sundorne area, before crossing the Shrewsbury by-pass (the A49) at Sundorne Roundabout and heading east towards Newport. Population (2001 census): 5123, reducing to 3,957 at the 2011 census.

It is an electoral division of Shropshire Council, returning one councillor, and a ward of the town, returning a councillor to the town council. The suburb has its own library/community centre and also now has the main sports centre for the town (the Shrewsbury Sports Village). The sports centre hosted the counting for the 2009 elections to Shropshire Council and Shrewsbury Town Council. There is a public house on Sundorne Road, called &quot;the Coracle&quot; and another pub at Heathgates Roundabout, called &quot;the Heathgates&quot;.

==Military==
One of Shrewsbury&#x27;s two TA centres (the other (extant) being in Copthorne) was in Sundorne, until it closed. The land was sold and the centre building was being demolished in 2015, on its site has been built a care home, Montgomery House. The new Army Reserve Centre is located on the grounds of Shrewsbury Academy.

==Canal and river==
The now disused Shrewsbury and Newport Canal runs through woodland in the southern part of the area. The River Severn forms the southern boundary of Sundorne.

==Education==
The main secondary school in Sundorne was for many years called &quot;Harlescott&quot; school. It was then renamed Sundorne School to be more in keeping with the name of the ward (and less in keeping with the name of the Harlescott ward further to the northwest in Shrewsbury). Sundorne School stood next to Sundorne County Infants School, which has always used Sundorne in its nomenclature. Sundorne School combined with Grange School in September 2016 under the title Shrewsbury Academy. There still remains, however, Harlescott County Junior School on Featherbed Lane, the north-eastern boundary of the Sundorne ward. 
Many residents, especially those born before about 1985, in fact still use &quot;Harlescott&quot; to include Sundorne: the numerous car dealerships on Featherbed Lane carry advertisements with the address &quot;Featherbed Lane, Harlescott&quot;, while the two churches on Meadow Farm Drive - the Church of England Holy Spirit Church and Roman Catholic Church of Our Lady of Pity - also have &quot;Harlescott&quot; in their titles.

==Sport==
Sundorne is represented in sport by the local Sunday League football club AFC Sundorne, members of the Shropshire County Minor League. Other football teams play at the Sports Village, including Haughmond (named after the nearby hill) who play in the Midland Football League. The Perkins social club is also located in Sundorne, which is home of Perkins CCC, a local cricket side.

==Public transport==
Different areas of the suburb are served by various bus routes, all of which are operated by Arriva Midland North. The 24 route runs between the Tesco store in Harlescott and Shrewsbury bus station via Shrewsbury railway station. The 519 and 524 services run between Shrewsbury bus station and Newport.

==Sundorne Castle==

Nearby are the remains of the stately home known as Sundorne Castle, at onetime a seat of the Corbet-Pigott family.

<doc id="1086918" wikidata="Q16251652" url="?curid=1086918" title="Email fraud">
<text>Email fraud (or email scam) is intentional deception for either personal gain or to damage another individual using email as the vehicle. Almost as soon as email became widely used, it began to be used as a means to defraud people, just as telephony and paper mail 
were used by previous generations.

Email fraud can take the form of a confidence trick (&quot;con game&quot;, &quot;scam&quot;, etc.). Some confidence tricks tend to exploit the inherent greed and dishonesty of its victims. The prospect of a &#x27;bargain&#x27; or &#x27;something for nothing&#x27; can be very tempting. Email fraud, as with other &quot;bunco schemes&quot;, usually targets naïve individuals who put their confidence in schemes to get rich quickly. These include &#x27;too good to be true&#x27; investments or offers to sell popular items at &#x27;impossibly low&#x27; prices. 

Another form of email fraud is an impersonation technique known as email spoofing: the recipient is misled by falsified origin information () into making an anticipated payment into the fraudster&#x27;s account rather than the correct one. The method is known as phishing or spear phishing: &#x27;phishing&#x27; involves sending thousands of emails claiming, for example, that an account has been compromised; &#x27;spear phishing&#x27; typically involves targeted and personalized emails or messages designed to deceive specific individuals or organizations into revealing sensitive information or performing malicious actions.

== Forms ==

=== Spoofing ===

Email sent from someone pretending to be someone else is known as spoofing. Spoofing may take place in a number of ways. Common to all of them is that the actual sender&#x27;s name and the origin of the message are concealed or masked from the recipient. Many instances of email fraud use at least spoofing, and as most frauds are clearly criminal acts, criminals typically try to avoid easy traceability.

=== Phishing ===

Phishing is a type of social engineering where an attacker sends a fraudulent (e.g., spoofed, fake, or otherwise deceptive) message designed to trick a person into revealing sensitive information to the attacker or to deploy malicious software on the victim&#x27;s infrastructure such as ransomware. Some spoof messages purport to be from an existing company, perhaps one with which the intended victim already has a business relationship. The &#x27;bait&#x27; in this instance may appear to be a message from &quot;the fraud department&quot; of, for example, the victim&#x27;s bank, which asks the customer to: &quot;confirm their information&quot;; &quot;log in to their account&quot;; &quot;create a new password&quot;, or similar requests. Instead of being directed to the website they trust, they are referred to an identical looking page with a different URL.

After entering their log-in details, their username and password is visible to the perpetrators. In many cases, phishing emails can appear to be benign - for example, a message prompting the receiver that they have a new friend request on a social media platform. Regardless of how innocent the message is in itself, it will always lead the victim to an imitation web page and false log-in prompt.

In a study, researchers concluded that cognitive reflection and sensation-seeking tendencies are modest but significant predictors of susceptibility to phishing. Additionally, participants who were pressured to make quick email legitimacy judgments made more errors.

=== Bogus offers ===
Email solicitations to purchase goods or services may be instances of attempted fraud. The fraudulent offer typically features a popular item or service, at a drastically reduced price.

Items may be offered in advance of their actual availability. For instance, the latest video game may be offered prior to its release, but at a similar price to a normal sale. In this case, the &quot;greed factor&quot; is the desire to get something that nobody else has, and before everyone else can get it, rather than a reduction in price. Of course, the item is never delivered, as it was not a legitimate offer in the first place.

Such an offer may even be no more than a phishing attempt to obtain the victim&#x27;s credit card information, with the intent of using the information to fraudulently obtain goods or services, paid for by the hapless victim, who may not know they were scammed until their credit card has been &quot;used up.&quot;

=== Requests for help ===
The &quot;request for help&quot; type of email fraud takes this form: an email is sent requesting help in some way. However, a reward is included for this help, which acts as a &quot;hook&quot;. The reward may be a large amount of money, a treasure, or some artifact of supposedly great value.

This type of scam has existed at least since the Renaissance, known as the &quot;Spanish Prisoner&quot; or &quot;Turkish Prisoner&quot; scam. In its original form, this scheme has the con man purport to be in correspondence with a wealthy person who has been imprisoned under a false identity and is relying on the confidence artist to raise money to secure his release. The con man tells the &quot;mark&quot; (victim) that he is &quot;allowed&quot; to supply money, for which he should expect a generous reward when the prisoner returns. The confidence artist claims to have chosen the victim for their reputation for honesty.

=== Other ===

* Business email compromise is a class of email fraud where employees with privileged access (such as to company finances) are deceived into making invalid payments or installing ransomware
*Advance-fee scam: Among the variations on this type of scam, are the Nigerian Letter also called the 419 fraud, Nigerian scam, Nigerian bank scam, or Nigerian money offer. The Nigerian Senate emblem is sometimes used in this scam.
*Lottery scam: The intended victim is often told their name or email address was selected through a random computer ballot and sponsored by a marketing company. In order to claim their so-called winnings, the victim is asked to provide their bank account details and other personal information. The victim is asked to contact the claims agent or award department.
*FBI email: Claim to be an “official order” from the FBI’s Anti-Terrorist and Monetary Crimes Division, from an alleged FBI unit in Nigeria, confirm an inheritance, or contain a lottery notification, all informing recipients they have been named the beneficiary of millions of dollars.
*Hitman: An email is sent to the victim&#x27;s inbox, supposedly from a hitman who has been hired by a &quot;close friend&quot; of the recipient to kill him or her but will call off the hit in exchange for a large sum of money. This is usually backed up with a warning that if the victim informs local police or the FBI, the &quot;hitman&quot; will be forced to go through with the plan. This is less an advance-fee fraud and more outright extortion, but a reward can sometimes be offered in the form of the &quot;hitman&quot; offering to kill the man who ordered the original hit on the victim.
*Investment schemes: Emails touting investments that promise high rates of return with little or no risk. One version seeks investors to help form an offshore bank. The Fifth Third Bank brand, name, and logo have been frequently exploited in this scam. The computer security company McAfee reports that, at the beginning of September 2006, over 33% of phishing scam emails being reported to McAfee were using Fifth Third Bank&#x27;s brand.
*Romance scam: Usually this scam begins at an online dating site, and is quickly moved to personal email, online chat room, or social media site. Under this form, fraudsters (pretended males or females) build online relationships, and after some time, they ask for money from the victims. They claim the money is needed due to the fact they have lost their money (or their luggage was stolen), they have been beaten or otherwise harmed and they need to get out of the country to fly to the victim&#x27;s country.
*Dating extortion scam: After baiting an individual into intimate conversations, they are told to pay unless they want their conversations posted online and they are named a cheater. There are no reports from the FBI that indicate that the records are actually removed once payment has been made.
*Online business directory: Typically offering a free subscription to a non-existent directory with hefty fees for maintenance in the fine print.
*Death certificate scam: Person will get an obituary off Internet. Find out relatives related. Get their emails. Contact them with fake story of another family member near death, which of course, is only told in ambiguous language. It originates out of Ethiopia with the &quot;makelawi&quot; tag in the email, but it can have de (German free email tag) along with it.
*Marriage agency scam: Pretending to be translation agency or marriage agency, they do not actually translate emails nor connect to real brides, but fabricate emails and create fake profiles on dating sites. They can use pictures of real people from other websites. Typically they are aimed at foreign men looking for brides from the former Soviet countries. When a victim is engaged, they ask for communication expenses such as translations, voice phone calls, video calls, &quot;agency fees&quot;. They impersonate the brides instead of providing a matchmaking service to them. The real ladies may not be aware that someone is using their identity.
*Secret shopper: The intended victim is solicited via email to work as a &#x27;secret shopper&#x27;, often after the victim&#x27;s resume has been posted at a job search site. Once engaged, the victim is sent a counterfeit check along with instructions and forms for work as a secret shopper. The provided instructions typically are to make several small transactions at nearby businesses, recording their experience on an official looking form. Universally is the instruction for the victim to also create a significant wire transfer, with a request to rate the experience. The counterfeit check is cashed at the unsuspecting victim&#x27;s financial institution in order to accomplish the listed tasks.
*Traffic ticket spam: Fraudulent emails claiming the recipient had been issued a traffic ticket. The spam, which spoofed a nyc.gov email address, claimed to be from the New York State Police (NYSP).
*Word of Mouth: This type of email spam states that an anonymous person posted a secret about the recipient and that he needs to pay a fee in order to see the message.
*Job Scams: The victim is seeking a job and posts a resume on any internet job site. The scammer spots the resume and sends the victim an email claiming to be a legitimate job listing service, and claiming to have a client who is looking for an employee with their skills and experience. The victim is invited to click on a link to apply for the job. Clicking the link takes the victim to a job description specifically written for the skills and experience on the victim&#x27;s resume, and provides a very high salary, and invites them to &quot;click here&quot; to apply for the job. If the victim clicks on that &quot;apply&quot; link, they are taken to an &quot;application&quot; form that asks for the normal job application information, PLUS the victim&#x27;s social security number, date of birth, the name of the bank and account number where they will want their paycheck to be deposited to, a &quot;relative&quot; reference, etc. With this information, the scammer can open up a bank account in any on-line bank and utilize the victim&#x27;s credit to buy items online and ship them to associates who are in on the scam.
*PayPal scam: Fraudulent emails claiming the victim has been issued a payment to his/her account, however processing will be complete once the victim has sent the item he/she is selling to the individuals address. This scam is mostly common in selling items to individuals abroad.
*Counterfeit Invoice Ploy: You get an email with an invoice claiming you owe money for a product or service you never ordered. The email looks legitimate and includes the official logo of the business or school. Opening the attachment can potentially infect your computer with malware.
*Gift Card Scam: Someone has hacked into your close friend&#x27;s email account, and you get a message from them asking for help buying gift cards. Kind-hearted people who are quick to help often fall victim to this scam.

== Avoiding email fraud ==
Due to the widespread use of web bugs in email, simply opening an email can potentially alert the sender that the address to which the email is sent is a valid address. This can also happen when the mail is &#x27;reported&#x27; as spam, in some cases: if the email is forwarded for inspection, and opened, the sender will be notified in the same way as if the addressee opened it.

Email fraud may be avoided by:
*Not responding to suspicious emails.
*Keeping one&#x27;s email address as secret as possible.
*Using a spam filter.
*Noticing the several spelling errors in the body of the &quot;official looking&quot; email.
*Ignoring unsolicited emails of all types and deleting them.
*Not clicking on links.
*Not opening unexpected attachments, even if they appear to be from someone the user trusts. Many email fraudsters attach viruses or malware to emails.
*Ignoring offers from unknown sources. The contents of an email are not a formal or binding agreement.

Many frauds go unreported to authorities, due to feelings of shame, guilt, or embarrassment.

<doc id="1086924" wikidata="Q15223060" url="?curid=1086924" title="Harlescott">
<text>Harlescott ( , ) is a suburb of the town of Shrewsbury, county town of Shropshire. It is one of the most industrial parts of the town, and is the 5th most deprived ward in non-metropolitan Shropshire Neighbouring suburbs include Sundorne to the east and Ditherington to the south. Note that many locals, particularly those born before about 1985, use the term &quot;Harlescott&quot; to refer to a wider area than the council ward, including much of what is officially &quot;Sundorne&quot; (to the east of Whitchurch and Battlefield Roads) and also much of the Heathgates and Mount Pleasant areas (sometimes called &quot;Heath Farm&quot;).

==History and Topography==
The centre of the area contains the remains of a moated settlement, probably the original Harlescott Grange. The earthwork and buried remains of the medieval moated site are situated on a gentle north east facing slope. It is now surrounded by a modern housing estate, but from this location there would originally have been extensive views of the surrounding area. The moat is now visible as a slight earthwork having been drained in 1950 and largely infilled following the construction of the housing estate. The arms of the moat, which survive as buried features, are between 12m and 15m wide and define a rectangular island approximately 40m by 46m. Material excavated from the moat has been used to raise the surface of the island between 1.2m and 2m above the level of the surrounding ground. An account of the site in 1937 indicated that the sides of the moat were lined with masonry and when the moat was drained, 13th century pottery was found. Sherds of medieval pottery were also found when a small-scale archaeological excavation was conducted in 1960.

There was once a military supply depot here, RAF Harlescott, but this has closed and the nearest RAF base is now a few miles away at Shawbury. Harlescott was also once a fairly notable railway centre, but now all the sidings have gone. Only the Welsh Marches Line itself and Harlescott Crossing remain.

Shrewsbury&#x27;s livestock market was at Harlescott (between 1956 and 2006 - it is now at a new site out-of-town at Battlefield) to the north. The site has been redeveloped with a Tesco supermarket. Next door there is a Park and Ride car park. Every Sunday, when there are no Park and Ride buses, an open-air market is held at this site.

Harlescott has been the location of the Arriva Midlands Shrewsbury bus depot since 2012, with the newly built depot (behind the Park and Ride site by Tesco) replacing the former Midland Red / Arriva Midlands depot in Ditherington, which was then demolished.

There were four bank branches nearby on Harlescott Lane, two of which are now closed. There were plans in 2011 to expand the Tesco, including new units to accommodate the banks. However, these plans never came into place and the units are now housing a Greggs and a barber.

There are two pubs in Harlescott, one called &quot;The Anchor Inn&quot; and the other &quot;Harry Hotspur&quot;. The latter is named after Harry Hotspur, who fought at the Battle of Shrewsbury, which took place in what is now Battlefield. (&quot;The Coracle&quot;, Sundorne Road, &quot;The Heathgates&quot; on the Heathgates island, and &quot;The Steam Wagon&quot; on Mount Pleasant Road are also in Harlescott according to the wider definition, see above). Another pub, &quot;The Harlescott&quot;, recently closed and was later set alight by arsonists. It has now been demolished and a new supermarket (Lidl) has been built on the site. Recently, there has been significant retail development around Harlescott, including a newly built public house called The Featherbed and owned by Marston&#x27;s Breweries. A Frankie &amp; Benny&#x27;s restaurant, alongside a Chiquitos, KFC and Subway have also recently opened.

==Education==
Harlescott&#x27;s Secondary school was The Grange School, an 11 to 16 co-educational secondary school. It amalgamated with Sundorne School in 2016 into a split-site school known as Shrewsbury Academy.

<text>Tanjung Priok is a district in the administrative city of North Jakarta, Indonesia. It hosts the western part of the city&#x27;s main harbor, the Port of Tanjung Priok (located in Tanjung Priok District and Koja District). The district of Tanjung Priok is bounded by Laksamana Yos Sudarso Tollway and Sunter River canal to the east, by Kali Japat, Kali Ancol, and the former Kemayoran Airport to the southwest, by Sunter Jaya Road and Sunter Kemayoran Road to the south, and by Jakarta Bay to the north.

==History==
Before human development, the coastal area of what is now Tanjung Priok was an area of brackish water with swamp and mangrove forest.

=== The old harbor of Jakarta ===
During the colonial era, Batavia at first relied on the Sunda Kelapa harbor area. This meant that Batavia had a harbor system like many others cities. I.e. an anchorage at sea at some distance from the city, and a city harbor where smaller ships could attach to a quay. It meant that big ships like the Dutch East Indiamen and later ships safely anchored at some distance from Batavia, at what was called the &#x27;harbor&#x27; of Batavia. Passengers and cargo then had to be trans-loaded on smaller ships, that would actually land these on one of the quays of Batavia.

The &#x27;outer harbor&#x27; situation of Batavia became problematic when the natural harbor of Singapore became a competitor. In Singapore ocean-going ships could directly attach to a quay. The effect was that for many Dutch East-Indian commodities, it was cheaper to ship via the more distant harbor of Singapore. (At Batavia, a sea going ship from e.g. Surabaya, would have to unload its cargo into boats that sailed to a quay in Batavia proper. Later these boats would have to be used again to load the cargo into a ship to the Netherlands. The same ship could sail to Singapore, and directly unload at a quay. This eliminated the step to transload on boats.)

=== Plans for the new harbor ===
The goal of the Tanjung Priok harbor plans was to create a harbor where ocean-going ships could attach to a quay. The increased traffic which resulted from the opening of the Suez Canal contributed to these plans, but the rationale centered on eliminating the need for trans-loading. The effect would be that commodities produced in the Dutch East Indies could be brought to the Batavia warehouses more cheaply. This would put Batavia, and Dutch ships at a more equal foot to Singapore and English ships. In turn, scale effects, i.e. regular supply of cargo, would further redress the balance for Dutch shipping.

=== Construction of the harbor ===
The construction of the new harbor was started in 1877 by Governor General Johan Wilhelm van Lansberge (1875–1881). The new harbor was named Tandjong Priok. The construction of the harbor was a major project.

Several facilities were built to support the function of the new harbor. Repair facilities were provided by Tanjung Priok Dock of 4,000 tons. A railway connection was established by building Tanjung Priuk Station (1914) and connecting it to the existing rail network.

== Spelling ==
Tanjung Priok is variously spelled in history as &quot;Tandjong Priok&quot;, &quot;Tandjoeng Priok&quot; or &quot;Tanjon Preeq&quot;.

== Riots ==

Tanjung Priok was the site of a widely publicized incident on September 12, 1984, when army forces fired on a group of Muslim protesters. The protesters were demonstrating against proposed government regulations that would require all formal organisations in the country to adopt Pancasila as their ideology. There were conflicting reports about the total death toll, but most sources indicate that several hundred protesters were killed. After the fall of Suharto the case was taken up again, and in 2003 fourteen people, among them a former commander of the Kopassus special forces unit, were named as suspects in the 1984 killings.

==Administrative villages (&quot;kelurahan&quot;)==
The district of Tanjung Priok is divided into seven &quot;kelurahan&quot; or subdistricts:
==Important places==

*Port of Tanjung Priok
*Tanjung Priuk railway station (1914) 
*Jakarta International Stadium
On November 20, 2011, the Jakarta administration inaugurated the city&#x27;s first railways tourism package aimed at attracting more tourists and reducing traffic congestion from Gambir railway station to the Tanjung Priuk railway station.

<text>Liternum was an ancient town of Campania, southern central Italy, near &quot;Patria lake&quot;, on the low sandy coast between Cumae and the mouth of the Volturnus. It was probably once dependent on Cumae. In 194 BC it became a Roman colony. Although Livy records that the town was unsuccessful, excavation reveals a Roman town existed there until the 4th century AD.

== History ==
The town is mainly famous as the residence of the elder Scipio Africanus, who withdrew from Rome and died there. His tomb and villa are described by Seneca the Younger in his&quot; Moral Letters to Lucilius&quot;. In letter LXXXVI, Seneca describes the villa as being built with squared stone blocks with towers on both sides. 

In Ovid&#x27;s&quot; Metamorphoses&quot; Liternum is mentioned for its mastic trees: &quot;lentisciferum... Liternum&quot;. Augustus Caesar is said to have conducted a colony of veterans to Liternum.
The construction of the Via Domitiana through Liternum made it a posting station, but the town later had a malaria outbreak and went into decline. In 455, the town was pillaged and destroyed by Genseric, king of the Vandals.

Excavations between 1930 and 1936 brought to light some elements of the city center (a forum with a podium temple from the early years of the town, a basilica and a small theater). Outside the city walls, the remains of the amphitheater and the necropolis have been identified.

<doc id="1086948" wikidata="Q7896077" url="?curid=1086948" title="University of Pennsylvania Glee Club">
<text>Founded in 1862, the University of Pennsylvania Glee Club (Penn Glee Club) is one of the oldest continually running glee clubs in the United States and the oldest performing arts group at the University of Pennsylvania. The Club draws its singing members from the undergraduate and graduate populations of the University of Pennsylvania; individuals from the Penn community are also called upon to fill roles in the band and technical staff when the Club puts on theatrical productions. The club, known for its eclectic mix of Penn standards, Broadway classics, classical favorites, and pop hits, has traveled to over 40 countries and territories on five continents. On April 9, 2021, the Penn Glee Club began accepting singers of all genders. The Glee Club&#x27;s current music director is Sam Scheibe.

==History==

The Glee Club&#x27;s history began modestly in 1862 when eight undergraduate men formed what is now the oldest performing arts group at the University of Pennsylvania; subsequently, another eight men were added to the group. The Glee Club&#x27;s premiere performance was in the chapel of Collegiate Hall at Ninth &amp; Chestnut Streets in Philadelphia for &quot;an audience that was unusually select and large, the Hall filled to its utmost capacity&quot;. At this concert, each man wore red and blue ribbons in his buttonhole, thus becoming the first known Penn group to wear the university colors as part of its uniform.

The Glee Club quickly became a part of campus life, singing at football rallies, basketball games, alumni events, and chapel services. Soon, much of the university&#x27;s musical demands depended upon the Glee Club. As a result, the reliance on such traditional collegiate songs such as &quot;Gaudeamus Igitur&quot; and &quot;Integer Vitae&quot; gave way to original pieces composed especially for the university and the Glee Club which themselves became traditions: &quot;The Red and Blue,&quot; &quot;Afterglow,&quot; and &quot;Fight On, Pennsylvania.&quot;

The Glee Club began to have more of a regional and national presence in the early decades of the Twentieth Century. In 1910, it embarked on a brief tour of the New England states. In 1915, the club sang at the U.S. Naval Academy. In 1926, the Glee Club performed for President Calvin Coolidge in the White House. In 1928, listeners could hear the club as far west as Nebraska in a broadcast publicizing the newly formed CBS Radio Network.

In 1934, under director Harl McDonald, the Penn Glee Club began performing with the Philadelphia Orchestra. The club&#x27;s partnership with this symphony came to include a 1938 performance of the Brahms&#x27; Alto Rhapsody with Marian Anderson and the 1970 world premiere broadcast of then-Director Bruce &quot;Monty&quot; Montgomery&#x27;s &quot;Herodotus Fragments&quot;. The 1950s saw the first of many Glee Club appearances on national television with such celebrities as Ed McMahon and Carol Lawrence. The club has been showcased on television specials, in the Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, and at professional sporting events. The Philadelphia Phillies had the Club sing the National Anthem at the 1993 National League Championship Series. In 1976, the Penn Glee Club first performed with the Boston Pops. The club has also shared the stage with such superstars as Bob Hope, Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Stewart, and Grace Kelly.

The Penn Glee Club stepped out of the formal lines of choral performance in 1928, performing its first fully staged production, &quot;Hades, Inc.&quot;, written by then-director H. Alexander Matthews. Staging became standard fare for the modern Club with 1969/1970&#x27;s &quot;Handel With Hair&quot;. Each year, the Club writes and produces a fully staged, Broadway-style production, highlighting choral singing, clever plots and dialogue, dancing, humor, colorful sets and costumes, and a pit band.

The Penn Glee Club has toured internationally since 1959 and has traveled to nearly all 50 states in the United States and 37 nations and territories on five continents.
Since its first performance at the White House for President Calvin Coolidge in 1926, the club has sung for numerous heads of state and world leaders, including for Polish President Lech Wałęsa in 1989. In 1999, several prominent Japanese executives sponsored a tour to Guam and Japan, the club&#x27;s first tour of the Asian Pacific. In 2004, the Club returned to Asia, this time touring China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Singapore. The following year, in 2005, the Club journeyed back to South America for the first time since 1987, touring Argentina and Uruguay. The 2006–2007 season saw the group traveling to Ireland and Northern Ireland for the first time. In the summer of 2009, the Club toured Colombia, Panama, and Costa Rica.

In 2021, the Penn Glee Club expanded its singing section to a full soprano, alto, tenor, bass (SATB) roster by combining with its sister group, the Penn Sirens. The club now features an SATB choir, SSAA and TTBB chamber choirs, and two student-run a cappella groups, the Penn Pipers and Penn Sirens.

==The Penn Pipers==
The Penn Pipers, a subset of the Glee Club, formed in 1950, making it the oldest existing a cappella group at the University of Pennsylvania. Its founding student leaders created arrangements emulating the close, contemporary harmonies of a popular, jazz-oriented quartet called &quot;The Hi-Los&quot;. The Pipers&#x27; most popular tune of the time—a lush setting of Brahm&#x27;s Lullaby arranged by member Bill Tost—became its standard closing number for many years. The group has always been a subset of the University of Pennsylvania Glee Club and serves as an opportunity for some of the Glee Club&#x27;s singers to perform music of a lighter and more popular style.

The group performs barbershop music and doo-wop. Its current repertoire encompasses popular music from the 1890s through to the present day.

== The Penn Glee Club Band ==
The Penn Glee Club Band is the Glee Club&#x27;s pit band. As its own ensemble, the band performs on its own as well. The band was formed in 2012 as an integral part of the larger Club&#x27;s annual fall and spring shows. In addition to performing in the fall and spring shows, the Penn Glee Club Band also performs its own gigs, both on campus and around the city. It has performed at Spring Fling, an annual Penn tradition, and has also filmed a music video.

<doc id="1086949" wikidata="Q514491" url="?curid=1086949" title="Marilyn Lloyd">
<text>Rachel Marilyn Lloyd (née Laird; January 3, 1929 – September 19, 2018) was an American politician and businesswoman who served ten terms in the United States House of Representatives from 1975 until 1995.

==Education and personal life==
Laird was born in Fort Smith, Arkansas in 1929, the daughter of a Church of Christ pastor. She graduated from Western Kentucky College High School, a high school that associated with what is now Western Kentucky University, in Bowling Green, Kentucky, in 1945. She attended Shorter College in Rome, Georgia. She owned radio station WTTI in Dalton, Georgia, and Executive Aviation in Winchester, Tennessee.

Her first husband was Dr. Robert Earl Davison, a dentist in Trion, Georgia. After Davison&#x27;s death in 1960, she married Chattanooga TV news anchor Mort Lloyd in 1963. He died in an airplane crash in 1974. In 1978, she married engineer Joseph P. Bouquard. In 1983, the couple divorced, and she resumed using the name Marilyn Lloyd. In 1991, she married Robert Fowler, a physician, who also predeceased her. Lloyd had three daughters from her marriage to Davison, and a son from her marriage to Lloyd.

==Political and congressional career==
Mort Lloyd was a popular television anchor at WDEF-TV in Chattanooga, who had entered the 1974 Democratic primary for Tennessee&#x27;s 3rd congressional district, to oppose two-term incumbent Republican Congressman LaMar Baker. Lloyd had won the primary in the Chattanooga-based district on August 1, but he was killed in an airplane crash on August 20 while flying to visit his parents, and the Democratic Party selected his widow to replace him on the ballot. She went on to defeat Baker in the General Election in November. That election saw many Republicans, in competitive and marginal districts, defeated, in large part because of the Watergate scandal. Lloyd was a moderate-to-conservative Democrat, receiving a score of 53% from the American Conservative Union.

=== Congress ===
She became the first woman ever elected to Congress from Tennessee for a full term. Willa Eslick, Louise Reece, and Irene Baker were all elected in special elections to succeed their husbands as caretakers and did not run for a full term in the next election. Lloyd was considered a conservative Democrat by national standards, but a moderate by Tennessee standards. She often broke with the Democratic Party&#x27;s national leadership, her views reflecting those of her conservative-minded district.

Lloyd served on the House Science Committee for her entire congressional career. That committee had jurisdiction over legislation related to nuclear weapons and research facilities at Oak Ridge in her district. By the time of her retirement from Congress, she was the second-ranking Democrat on the committee. She was a strong advocate for the Clinch River Breeder Reactor project in Oak Ridge. She also served on the Committee on Public Works (1975–87), on the Armed Services Committee (1983–95), and on the House Select Committee on Aging for much of her congressional career.

When women members of the House formed a Women&#x27;s Caucus in 1977, Lloyd was one of three congresswomen who declined membership, presumably because she feared alienating her constituents. She later joined the caucus but resigned in 1980 over political disagreements. Lloyd cosponsored legislation related to women&#x27;s health, notably the Mammography Quality Standards Act, which was enacted in 1992. After she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1991 and was denied a silicone breast implant because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had removed them from the market, Lloyd became an advocate for breast cancer treatment and women&#x27;s health. She advocated for the availability of breast implants for reconstructive surgery. Her fight with cancer led her to reverse her longstanding opposition to abortion; she announced on the floor of the House that having to fight to make decisions about her treatment &quot;that should have been mine alone&quot; led to her change of heart on the issue.

In 1992, her Republican opponent was real estate broker Zach Wamp. In one of the closest contests of her career, she only defeated Wamp by 2,900 votes (1%), and only then because of the withdrawal of underground environmental candidate Peter Melcher. Lloyd lost badly in Hamilton County, home to Chattanooga, and retained her seat only due to a strong showing in the Oak Ridge area. Despite Tennessee&#x27;s Senator Al Gore being elected Vice President as Bill Clinton&#x27;s running mate, the Clinton–Gore Democratic ticket won the 3rd District by only 39 votes out of 225,000 cast, one of their worst performances in the state. The closeness of the race is believed to have influenced her decision not to stand for an 11th term in 1994. She endorsed Wamp&#x27;s bid for Congress that year, which may have contributed to his narrow victory. That election was one of only two times since Lloyd left office that the Democrats have cleared the 40 percent mark in the district.

==Post-retirement and death==
Subsequent to her retirement from Congress, Lloyd maintained a fairly low profile other than her advocacy for victims of domestic violence. The Marilyn Lloyd Environmental and Life Sciences Research Complex at Oak Ridge National Laboratory was named in her honor in 1999. Her Congressional papers are archived in the library of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga.

Lloyd died on September 19, 2018, aged 89, at her home in Chattanooga, Tennessee, from an undisclosed reason.

<text>&quot;A.E.I.O.U.&quot; (sometimes A.E.I.O.V.) was a symbolic device coined by Emperor Frederick III (1415–1493) and historically used as a motto by the Habsburgs. One note in his notebook (discovered in 1666), though not in the same hand, explains it in German and Latin as &quot;All the world is subject to Austria&quot; ( or ). Frederick habitually signed buildings such as Santa Maria dell&#x27;Anima in Rome, , or Graz Cathedral as well as his tableware and other objects with the vowel graphemes. A.E.I.O.U. is also the motto of the Theresian Military Academy, established in 1751. It can also be found on the wall of the Chancellor&#x27;s office in the Federal Chancellery of Austria. The famous device is probably the most known motto of premodern times, because it has repeatedly been given new interpretations. Unraveling the mystery of what the AEIOU means is part of a centuries-long debate that is still ongoing today.

Contemporary research has shown that the Roman chancellery of Frederick III used the interpretation &quot;En amor electis iniustis ordinor ultor. Sic Fridericus ego mea iura rego&quot; as the official motto. This interpretation has also been shown to be the most commonly used variant in the 15th century. It was also supposed that the &quot;Austriae est imperare&quot; variants probably go back to Frederick&#x27;s proto-notary Heinrich Leubing.

==Interpretation==

Frederick&#x27;s first use of the five-letter monogram was in 1437, when he was Duke of Styria. One note in his notebook (discovered in 1666), though not in the same hand, explains it in German and Latin as &quot;All the world is subject to Austria&quot; ( or ).

Another passage, later in the same notebook, uses the letters in sequence as the initial letters of the words in the first line of a couplet poem, (&quot;I am loved by the elect, for the unjust I am ordained an avenger&quot;). This verse was probably adopted by Frederick from a poem by Nicolaus Petschacher of Znaim who worked as a court official in the 1440s.

Other interpretations have been put forth, including by contemporary heraldists. Several explanations proceed on the assumption that it was meant as a political slogan.
* (&quot;Austria is best united by the Empire&quot;).
* (&quot;Austria will be supreme in the world&quot;, sometimes incorrectly given as &quot;Austria will be the last (surviving) in the world&quot;).
* 

Since Frederick wrote this acronym when he was not yet the ruler of the Archduchy of Austria and, at that time, Styria was entirely separated from Austria and was not considered to be its part until the next century, the term &quot;Austria&quot; in this context would not mean Austria as a territory or a nation, but rather the &quot;House of Austria&quot;, that is, the Habsburg dynasty.

Many Latin and German interpretations have been attempted over the centuries; most of these versions refer to a motto of present-day Austria or the extensive Habsburg monarchy.

== In literature ==
In Joyce&#x27;s novel &quot;Ulysses&quot;&#x27;s 9th chapter, the phrase &quot;A. E. I. O. U.&quot; means, &quot;Æ, I owe you&quot;.

<text>American Medical Response, Inc. (AMR) is a private ambulance company in the United States that provides and manages emergency medical services, non-emergency and managed transportation, rotary and fixed-wing air ambulance services, and disaster response across the United States.

== History ==
The company was founded in 1991 through the merger of Regional Ambulance (Alameda and Contra Costa counties, California), Vanguard Ambulance (Santa Clara County, California), and Buck Ambulance (Portland, Oregon). It was subsequently acquired by Laidlaw, and sold to Onex in 2004. With this acquisition, Onex formed Emergency Medical Services Corporation (EMSC) by merging AMR with EmCare. In 2011, EMSC was acquired by Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice.

On June 12, 2013, EMSC changed its name to Envision Healthcare.

On August 8, 2017, Envision Healthcare announced that AMR would be sold to Kohlberg Kravis Roberts in a deal worth US$2.4 billion.

In March 2018, AMR became a subsidiary of Global Medical Response. Also in 2018, AMR was the main campaign contributor in support of California Proposition 11 (2018), a bill that modified California labor law to allow for EMS workers to be on-call during breaks.

In 2022 AMR got a five-year contract with FEMA to provide medical transport and support for national disasters in the United States.

<text>Ahman Rashad Green (; born February 16, 1977) is an American former professional football running back who played 12 seasons in the National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Nebraska Cornhuskers, earning second-team All-American honors in 1997. Green was selected by the Seattle Seahawks in the third round of the 1998 NFL draft, playing there for two seasons before being traded to the Green Bay Packers, with whom he played for eight of the next ten seasons. Green also played for the Houston Texans, and was a four-time Pro Bowl selection with the Packers, where he holds the franchise record for rushing yards. He was the head esports coach at Lakeland University until the end of 2022.

==Early life==
Green was born in Omaha, Nebraska, and attended Omaha North before transferring to Omaha Central for high school. He was a high school All-American selection and state &#x27;Player of the Year&#x27; as a senior.

In addition to football, he also ran track and field. He currently holds the 10th fastest 100 meter dash ever in the state of Nebraska, at 10.61 seconds.

Green also competed in powerlifting in high school, placing 2nd in the ADFPA High School National Powerlifting Championships in Des Moines, Iowa.

==College career==
Green was a standout running back and three-year starter for the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers. He was an integral component and key contributor on two national championship squads.

===Freshman (1995)===
As a freshman, Green was perhaps overshadowed by his backfield mates running back Lawrence Phillips and quarterback Tommie Frazier. He was a major contributor during Nebraska&#x27;s 1995 championship run. He rushed for 1,086 yards (still the school&#x27;s single-season freshman rushing record) and 13 touchdowns on 141 carries (7.7 avg.) and was honored as a freshman All-America selection by Football News. In addition, he earned Big Eight all-conference and &#x27;Freshman of the Year&#x27; honors.

===Sophomore (1996)===
As a sophomore in 1996, Green compiled a team-leading 917 yards on 155 carries and seven touchdowns, despite a turf toe injury. Green had a career-high 214 yards against Iowa State University that season.

===Junior (1997)===
As a junior, Green garnered All-Big 12 Conference recognition and was named second-team All-America by the Associated Press and The Sporting News as Nebraska again captured the national championship. He was a finalist for the Doak Walker Award, the annual honor for college football&#x27;s top running back, in 1997. During that campaign he carried the ball 278 times for 1,877 yards (6.8 avg.) and 22 touchdowns (a school record for juniors). He posted 12 consecutive 100-yard games, including three contests with over 200 yards (he also had 99 yards on nine carries in the opener against Akron).

During his collegiate career, Green compiled 3,880 rushing yards and 42 touchdowns, both totals good for second place on the Cornhuskers&#x27; all-time list. He also posted 300 receiving yards and three touchdowns on 35 catches. One of Green&#x27;s best collegiate performances came on January 2, 1998, in the Orange Bowl. He rushed for an Orange Bowl record 206 yards and two touchdowns in Nebraska&#x27;s 42–17 victory over #3 Tennessee, breaking the previous 20-year-old record of 205 yards held by Arkansas running back Roland Sales. Green was also named the 1998 Orange Bowl MVP. The performance marked the Cornhuskers&#x27; record-setting third national championship in four years.

==== Bowl games ====
Green played in a bowl game each season he was at Nebraska. In the 1996 Fiesta Bowl, he rushed for 68 yards and one touchdown. In the 1996 Orange Bowl (played at the end of the year), he rushed for 52 yards, and in the 1998 Orange Bowl, he rushed for 206 yards and two touchdowns.

==Professional career==
===Seattle Seahawks (1998–1999)===
Green was drafted in the third round (76th overall) of the 1998 NFL draft by the Seattle Seahawks. Although Green produced a high rushing average (6.0 in 1998 and 4.6 in 1999) he had difficulty earning significant playing time behind established veteran Ricky Watters.

===Green Bay Packers (first stint, 2000–2006)===

In 2000, Green was traded along with a fifth round draft pick to the Green Bay Packers for Fred Vinson and a sixth round pick. He was selected to the NFL Pro Bowl from 2001 to 2004 and broke several franchise records. From the time he joined the Packers in 2000 up through the end of the 2004 season, Green gained more yards from scrimmage (9,036) and rushing yards (6,848) than any other NFL player. Green&#x27;s highest rushing touchdown per game total came in 2002, when he scored three in a 30–9 win versus the then-Washington Redskins. In 2003, he had his best year as a professional and set the Green Bay franchise record by running for 1,883 yards in the regular season, and three of his highest rushing yardage games came that season (218, 192, 176). That year, he became the first and only player in NFL history to record at least 1,850 rushing yards, average 5.0 yards per carry, score 20 touchdowns and catch 50 passes in one season. He threw a touchdown pass on October 17, 2004 vs. the Detroit Lions. During his time with the Packers, Green became one of two players in NFL history to have two touchdown runs of 90 or more yards (Bo Jackson is the other). Despite his injury-shortened 2005 season, the Packers re-signed Green to a one-year, $2 million contract, with an extra $3 million in incentives. After the 2006 season he became a free agent. He signed a one-year deal to remain with the Packers.

===Houston Texans (2007–2008)===
On March 4, 2007, Green signed a four-year, $23 million deal with the Houston Texans. He was reunited with his former head coach and former Texans&#x27; assistant head coach Mike Sherman along with former Packers running back Samkon Gado. He was asked to handle the bulk of the load at running back after a 2006 season in which the Texans used a &quot;running back by committee&quot; approach. Across his two seasons with the Texans, Green rushed 144 times for 554 yards and two touchdowns and also caught 25 passes for 155 yards.

On February 10, 2009, Green was released by the Texans.

===Green Bay Packers (second stint, 2009)===
Ahman Green officially re-signed with the Green Bay Packers on October 21, 2009, after the Packers placed running back DeShawn Wynn on injured reserve. With his former number, 30, taken by fullback John Kuhn, Green wore No. 34, the same number as former Chicago Bears running back Walter Payton, whom Green idolized as a young player. On November 8, 2009, Green broke Jim Taylor&#x27;s record to become the all-time leading rusher in Packer history. In his final NFL season, Green was primarily used in a reserve role, rushing 41 times for 160 yards and one touchdown and also catching 3 passes for 18 yards.

===Omaha Nighthawks (2010)===
Green joined the Omaha Nighthawks of the United Football League for the 2010 season. He was a part of the Nighthawks&#x27; 40-man protected roster, started 8 games for the Nighthawks.

===Montreal Alouettes (2011)===
On February 7, 2011, the Montreal Alouettes of the Canadian Football League announced they signed Green to a tryout contract, signing Green to an official contract in March of that year. Green was released on Sunday of training camp on June 5, 2011, after arriving with an injured hamstring.

=== Retirement ===
Green announced his retirement from football in August 2011.

==Personal life==
Green was named after former NFL wide receiver and current broadcaster Ahmad Rashad. He has an uncle, Michael Green, who also attended Nebraska as a running back in the late 1960s. His uncle was drafted by the San Diego Chargers, but never appeared in a game.

In 2003, Green completed his undergraduate degree at Nebraska after taking classes at the University of Wisconsin–Green Bay, receiving a bachelor&#x27;s degree in geography.

On September 21, 2012, Green was inducted into the University Of Nebraska Football Hall of Fame and was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Football Hall of Fame on July 19, 2014.

Green has lived in Green Bay since his retirement, and is an avid video-gamer and comic book fan – so much so that his nickname is &quot;Batman&quot;, illustrated further by a calf tattoo of the superhero. He operates a sports training facility in the city, and serves as a spokesman for the Wisconsin Alzheimer&#x27;s Association. From 2012 to 2014, Green served as co-owner of the Green Bay Blizzard, an arena football team.

In 2006, Green played a small role in the film &quot;Big Stan&quot; as the prisoner Lee Otis. Green also had a small role in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; as an unnamed thug, but his scene was cut from the final version of the film.

On June 26, 2017, Green was arrested on charges of child abuse and disorderly conduct after his daughter (from a previous marriage) claimed Green pushed her and struck her in the head over a dispute about chores. Green eventually entered a plea bargain where he pled no contest to reduced charges of criminal damage to property and disorderly conduct, claiming that he did not want to subject his daughter to a jury trial. He received 18 months probation.

In February 2020, Green was named head coach of Lakeland University&#x27;s new varsity esports team.

In November 2021, Green hosted the finals of the first ever Mid-America Gamers Expo in Council Bluffs.

Green was announced as a professor in the University of Nebraska&#x27;s College of Journalism and Mass Communications in 2023.

<text>The Shambles is a historic street in York, England, featuring preserved medieval buildings, some dating back as far as the 14th century. The street is narrow, with many timber-framed buildings with jettied floors that overhang the street by several feet. It was once known as The Great Flesh Shambles, probably from the Anglo-Saxon &quot;Fleshammels&quot; (literally &quot;flesh-shelves&quot;), the word for the shelves that butchers used to display their meat. In 1885, thirty-one butchers&#x27; shops were located along the street, but none remain today.

==Etymology==
&quot;Shambles&quot; is an obsolete term for an open-air slaughterhouse and meat market. Streets of that name were so called from having been the sites on which butchers killed and dressed animals for consumption (One source suggests that the term derives from &quot;Shammel&quot;, an Anglo-Saxon word for shelves that stores used to display their wares, while another indicates that by AD 971 &quot;shamble&quot; meant a &#x27;bench for the sale of goods&#x27; and by 1305, a &#x27;stall for the sale of meat&#x27;.).

The area around the Shambles was known as Marketshire into the 14th century and included the streets of the Shambles and Pavement. The Shambles itself had several names: by 1240 it was referred to as Haymongergate, and it was called Nedlergate in 1394, both thought to be references to other trades and crafts which took place in the street. In addition to these names, by 1426 it had become more commonly known as The Great Flesh Shambles, which was eventually shortened to its current name.

There are streets named &quot;The Shambles&quot;, or &quot;Shambles Street&quot;, in other UK towns and cities, including Barnsley, Bradford on Avon, Chesterfield, Guildford, Swansea, Chippenham, Manchester, Sevenoaks, Whitby, Worcester and Armagh. There is also a Fishamble Street in Dublin, Ireland.

==History==

Although not named in the Domesday Book of 1086, it has been identified through an entry which lists two butchers&#x27; stalls near the church of St Crux () being in the ownership of the Count of Mortain. 

The naming of the street after butcher stalls has stuck since the 14th century because the association of the street with butchers has been a large part of its history and character. This was because of a continuous tradition of butchers occupying the street that was upheld for centuries. This is probably in large part due to the favourable architecture of the street towards butcher practices of centuries past. The rears of the shops were slaughterhouses and the fact the buildings shade the narrow street from direct sunlight meant that the meat on display could stay fresh for longer. Also, when butchering took place, the guts, offal and blood were thrown into the street runnels that had a natural slope which helped it wash away after rain. These butchering practices long predated basic modern standards of hygiene and the street would have been incredibly unhygienic in these days. The last butcher shops on the street closed in the early 20th century and although the butchers have now vanished, a number of the shops on the street still have meat-hooks hanging outside and, below them, shelves on which meat was displayed. The shops include restaurants and shops as well as a bookshop and a bakery.

In medieval times, many streets in York had a similar appearance to the Shambles, such as The Water Lanes. The Shambles preserves a large amount of original medieval-built fabric, with many buildings dating from circa 1350–1475. Along with this, the picturesque qualities of the narrow street with its timber-framed jettied houses have meant that, since as early as the 19th century, it has been recognised as a major attraction of the city of York.

The 1940s and 1950s were a period when the Shambles was subject to a lot of change. After the Second World War, the street was targeted by city planners who wanted to make improvements to the buildings which by that time were in urgent need of restoration. York City Council purchased numerous properties from private owners and, during the 1950s, they extensively altered and rebuilt many buildings and demolished large sections of the area, including the entirety of Little Shambles, a short street that led west off the centre which was considered to be beyond repair. A chapel called Holy Trinity Christ Church was at the heart of King&#x27;s Square until it was demolished in 1937. Today, some of these restorations are seen as insensitive, since a great deal of historic fabric, including slaughterhouses and outbuildings at the rear of the properties, was demolished. The Yorkshire Architectural and York Archaeological Society&#x27;s annual report of 1949 contains plans of The Shambles showing the buildings to be removed.

There are five &quot;snickelways&quot; that lead off the Shambles because they used to be small alleyways in the backs of the buildings, but since these back buildings were demolished in the 1950s, they now open out onto a big open space with market stalls known as Shambles Market. The market was previously known as Newgate Market, after the street on which it is located, but was renamed in 2015.

The Shambles is one of a number of locations, along with streets in Chepstow, Edinburgh, Exeter and London, for which claims have been made to have been the inspiration for Diagon Alley in the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; franchise. However, the author, J. K. Rowling, has denied this, stating that she had never been to The Shambles. Since 2017, four wizard-themed shops have opened in the street.

==Notable buildings==

Almost all the buildings on the street are listed. On the east side, 1 Shambles is timber-framed and probably 14th century; 2 Shambles is early 18th century; and 3–5 Shambles are all 19th century, one initially serving as the former Shoulder of Mutton pub. 6 Shambles is late 18th century, with a 20th-century renovation and shopfront. 7–8 Shambles are late and early 15th century, respectively; and 9 Shambles is also 15th century. 10–11 Shambles originated as one 15th-century house; and 12 Shambles has some parts probably dating from the 14th century. 13 Shambles is early 17th century, while 14 Shambles was originally timber-framed but of unclear date. 19 Shambles was built in the early 16th century; 20 Shambles is mid-18th century; and 21 Shambles and 22–23 Shambles were each built in early 18th century. At the end of the street is the parish room of St Crux.

On the west side, 27–28 Shambles were built in the early 19th century; 30 Shambles is 18th-century but largely rebuilt in 1952; and 31–33 Shambles were built as a terrace in about 1436. 

Among the structures of The Shambles is a shrine to Saint Margaret Clitherow, who was married to a butcher who owned and lived in a shop in the street. Her home is thought to have been number 10 Shambles, on the opposite side of the street to the shrine, at number 35, which has a priest hole fireplace. These are also listed. 37–38 Shambles are late-15th century; and 39 Shambles includes a 15th-century timber frame. 40 Shambles is early-18th century; 41–42 Shambles is 15th century; and 43 Shambles was built in 1775. 44 Shambles is 15th century; 45 Shambles is early-18th century; and 46–47 Shambles were built in about 1740.

<doc id="1086978" wikidata="Q5682452" url="?curid=1086978" title="Haughmond Hill">
<text>Haughmond Hill is a small, shallow hill in the English county of Shropshire. It is covered by woodland for the most part, although there is an open cast quarry (for stone aggregates) in use. Its proximity to the town of Shrewsbury has meant that it has become something of a forest park, with guided paths, car parking and picnic areas maintained in places. The rocky summit overlooks countryside and Shrewsbury itself.

Haughmond Hill is made up of ancient turbidite sediments from the late Precambrian era which once cascaded off the edge of a continent into the ocean that surrounded it.

The villages of Uffington and Upton Magna lie below and the B5062, Shrewsbury to Newport, road runs through the northern half of the woodland.

Deer can be found in the woods, which are mixed deciduous/coniferous and are to some extent used for forestry to this day.

The hill has several dubious connections with the Battle of Shrewsbury in 1403. &quot;Queen Eleanor&#x27;s Bower&quot; is a small enclosure on the hill from which the wife of Henry IV of England supposedly watched the battle&#x27;s progress (although neither of his wives were named Eleanor). Finally, the &quot;bosky hill&quot; mentioned in Act V Scene i of Shakespeare&#x27;s Henry IV part 1 is almost certainly Haughmond, which looms to the east of the battlefield:

&quot;How bloodily the sun begins to peer&quot;
&quot;Above yon bosky hill?&quot;
&quot;The day looks pale&quot;
&quot;At his distemperature.&quot;

Also nearby is Haughmond Abbey, now a ruin, and Ebury Hill, a prehistoric fort. The summit has the ruins of Haughmond Castle, a folly originally built about 1780 that collapsed in 1931.

<doc id="1086992" wikidata="Q981088" url="?curid=1086992" title="Comet Donati">
<text>Comet Donati, or Donati&#x27;s Comet, formally designated C/1858 L1 and 1858 VI, is a long-period comet named after the Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Donati who first observed it on June 2, 1858. After the Great Comet of 1811, it was the most brilliant comet that appeared in the 19th century. It was also the first comet to be photographed.

==Discovery and observations==
Donati first observed the comet on 2 June from the Florence Observatory: it was initially visible as a small nebula-like object of magnitude 7 near the &quot;head&quot; of Leo. By mid-August it had brightened sufficiently to be visible to the naked eye.

In September it passed into Ursa Major. For much of its apparition it occupied a unique position (among great comets) in the sky and was particularly well placed for Northern Hemisphere viewers.

It was nearest the Earth on October 10, 1858, and for much of October was a brilliant object with a long, scimitar-like dust tail and prominent gas tail. It remained a naked-eye object until November for Southern Hemisphere observers. The final observation was by William Mann, chief assistant at the Royal Observatory, Cape of Good Hope, who detected it as a faint nebulosity on March 4, 1859.

During its apparition the comet was particularly closely studied by the astronomer George Phillips Bond and his father William Cranch Bond. G. P. Bond incorporated these observations and those of many other astronomers into a monograph, &quot;&quot;An Account of the Great Comet of 1858&quot;, which remains his most important scientific work and for which he was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society, being the first American to receive the award.

===Comet photographed===
Donati&#x27;s Comet was successfully photographed on September 27 by W. Usherwood, a portrait photographer at Walton-on-the-Hill, Surrey, using a 7-second exposure with an 2.4 portrait lens, the first time a comet had been photographed. Usherwood&#x27;s photograph, which has not survived, showed the bright region around the comet&#x27;s nucleus and a part of the tail. G.P. Bond also successfully photographed the comet on September 28 at Harvard College Observatory, the first comet photograph through a telescope. He made several attempts with increasing exposure times, finally achieving a discernible image. He later wrote, &quot;only the nucleus and a little nebulosity 15&quot; in diameter acted on the plate in an exposure of six minutes&quot;.

===Orbital calculations===
Orbits for the comet were calculated by Friedrich Emil von Asten and George William Hill, the latter&#x27;s based on nearly 1000 positions. The comet had an orbital inclination of 116.9°. With an epoch 2200 barycentric orbital period approximated at 1739 years, it is estimated that Donati&#x27;s Comet will not be seen passing by Earth again until somewhere around the year 3600. , JPL Horizons estimates that the comet is from the Sun and continuing to move away from the Sun at .

The comet&#x27;s orbit lies very close to that of Venus, with the minimum intersection distance being , which is smallest known distance a great comet can approach a terrestrial planet. It is possible the comet produces a strong meteor shower at the northern hemisphere.

==In art and culture==

Donati&#x27;s Comet is considered to be one of the most beautiful comets observed, and was one of the brightest of the century, making a strong impression both on artists and the general public. After a prior period of hysteria on the subject of comets, especially in Paris (caused partly by incorrect calculations by John Russell Hind which suggested that one would strike the Earth in June 1857) Donati&#x27;s Comet went on to be the most-observed of the century due to its excellent visibility in dark skies for Northern Hemisphere viewers, particularly in Europe, and fine weather in September and October. William Henry Smyth, an English astronomer, recalled it as &quot;one of the most beautiful objects that I have ever seen&quot;&quot;. Donati himself, a relatively obscure figure, was propelled to the status of an astronomical hero, and the comet helped cultivate a general enthusiasm for astronomy among the public.

Donati&#x27;s Comet appears as a streak and star in the early evening sky of a painting by William Dyce, &quot;Pegwell Bay, Kent – a Recollection of October 5th 1858&quot;. It was featured in a number of sketches and at least one painting by William Turner of Oxford, and in a painting, &quot;The Comet of 1858, as seen from the Heights of Dartmoor&quot;, by Samuel Palmer. &quot;The Comet at Yell&#x27;ham&quot;, a 1902 poem by Thomas Hardy, was inspired by his recollections of Donati&#x27;s Comet.

Abraham Lincoln, then a candidate for a seat in the U.S. Senate, sat up on the porch of his hotel in Jonesboro, Illinois, to see &quot;Donti&#x27;s Comet&quot; on September 14, 1858, the night before the third of his historic debates with Stephen Douglas.

In his journals of the Malay Archipelago, naturalist Alfred Russel Wallace writes of seeing the comet in October 1858 off the island of Tidore in Indonesia. &quot;I observed what seemed a fire of remarkable whiteness on the very summit of the hill... the magnificent comet which was at the same time, astonishing all Europe. The nucleus presented to the naked eye a distinct disc of brilliant white light, from which the tail rose at an angle of about 30° or 35° with the horizon, curving slightly downwards, and terminating in a broad brush of faint light, the curvature of which diminished till it was nearly straight at the end. The portion of the tail next the comet appeared three or four times as bright as the most luminous portion of the milky way, and what struck me as a singular feature was that its upper margin, from the nucleus to very near the extremity, was clearly and almost sharply defined, while the lower side gradually shaded off into obscurity.&quot;

The influence of the comet, particularly in visual and design terms, was such that traces of its appearance can be found in magazine and commercial illustrations, household objects, children&#x27;s books and other items up until the early years of the 20th century.

<text>Farnham is a village and civil parish in North Dorset, in the south of England, on Cranborne Chase, northeast of Blandford Forum. In the 2011 census the parish had a population of 183.

==Toponymy==
The name Farnham derives from the Old English &quot;fearn&quot; (fern) and &quot;ham&quot; (homestead) and means an enclosure or homestead where ferns grow. In the Domesday Book of 1086 Farnham was recorded as &quot;Ferneham&quot; or &quot;Fernham&quot;.

==History==
The early settlement history of Farnham isn&#x27;t clear. Iron Age and Romano-British field systems were created in the surrounding area generally, though traces haven&#x27;t survived at Farnham. The present-day Farnham village has emerged from five separate settlements associated with clearings in hazel coppice; in the Domesday Book &quot;Ferneham&quot; or &quot;Fernham&quot; is recorded five times, though not all the entries refer to the present-day settlement. The book records 12 households with a total taxable value of 6 geld units. The county&#x27;s sheriff at the time, Aiulf the chamberlain, owned some of the land.

For much of its history Farnham has been closely connected with Tollard Royal, the adjacent village and parish in the neighbouring county of Wiltshire. Tollard Farnham (or Farnham Tollard), a tithing to the north of Farnham village, was previously owned by the de Tollard family of Tollard Royal, and until 1885, when it was joined with Farnham, its dead were taken along a track named Burials Drove to be buried at Tollard Royal.
Augustus Pitt Rivers lived nearby on the Rushmore Estate. Following his donation of some 20,000 antiquities to the University of Oxford in 1884, forming the nucleus of the Pitt Rivers Museum, he continued to collect archaeological and ethnological specimens for his personal collection, which was held in the former Orphan Gypsy School at Crossways, about from Farnham village centre. The village&#x27;s inn became the Museum Hotel to cater for visitors, which numbered 12,000 per year at the peak of the museum&#x27;s popularity. The Farnham collection was dispersed in the 1970s, with the British items going to the Salisbury and South Wiltshire Museum, and the ethnographic collections sold.

<doc id="1087008" wikidata="Q6884660" url="?curid=1087008" title="Mizo Union">
<text>Mizo Union (6 April 1946 – 12 January 1974) was the first political party in Mizoram, in Northeast India. It was founded on 6 April 1946 at Aizawl as the Mizo Common People&#x27;s Union. At the time of independence of India from British rule in India in 1947, the party was the only political force in the Lushai Hills (former name of Mizoram). It won the first Mizoram District Council general election under the new Indian Union in 1951, and consecutively in 1957, 1962 and 1966.

However, the mautam (bamboo famine) of 1958 and its protégé insurgency in 1966 downgraded its status, so that the party was compelled to dissolve in 1974 and merged with the Indian National Congress.

== History ==
Mizo Union was the upshot of administrative preparation when the British rule in India was about to end. The British administrators initiated forming local representatives to maintain law and order. However, the Mizo leaders, especially the central organisation Young Lushai Association (YLA), preferred complete independence from India and started a boycott against British orders. At the onset, there even was a proposal to turn YLA into a political party. The learned men were urged the need to create an entirely political organisation. R. Vanlawma and P.S. Dahrawka then prepared a constitution of what they eventually called the &quot;Mizo Common People&#x27;s Union&quot;. After recruiting members, the party was formally established on 6 April 1946 with R. Vanlawma becoming the General Secretary and Convener. After a discussion the name was simplified to &quot;Mizo Union&quot; and the first officials were elected on 25 May 1946. The premier businessman Pachhunga became the first president.

Immediately, the party gained unprecedented support from the general public throughout the land. This was largely because of the general anachronistic attitude towards tribal chiefdom and their British allies, who wearied them with levies and forced labour. But the momentum of popularity had its drawbacks. The freshly educated recruits formed an intellectual group and usurped against the party leaders, who were not highly educated, which was the main issue. The intellectuals mounted a coup in the party&#x27;s first general meeting on 24–26 September of that year, which led to the resignation of Pachhunga and elimination of other leaders. The only remaining original official, Vice President Lalhema, became the president, but he was also a petty businessman and still had a deficit in education. The issue erupted in the November meeting, and an election in early 1947 clearly toppled Lalhema, who was ousted by Khawtinkhuma, a fresh master&#x27;s degree holder from Tripura. The trailblazers were forced to unite into an offshoot party. which they named the &quot;Mizo Union Council&quot;. This for a time formed a public and religious chasms in Aizawl as the Mizo Union was supported by the educated class and commoners and also mostly by church leaders. The new party was espoused by the influences of the philanthropist Pachhunga, who were mostly well-to-do entrepreneurs and the tribal chiefs. Thus Aizawl was divided into a southern Mizo Union dominion with its headquarters at Thakthing and northern Mizo Union Council territory having its office at Pachhunga&#x27;s residence at Dawrpui.

=== UMFO ===
In early 1947m Khawtinkhuma was offered a regular government job and was succeeded by Pastor Zairema, who was supported by the Presbyterian Church, on 18 January. But there was an internal turmoil incited by Lalbiaktluanga, who as the Vice President rightly claimed the presidency but to no avail. The dispirited Lalbiaktluanga and his sympathisers departed with the creation of a new party, the &quot;United Mizo Freedom Organisation&quot; (UMFO), on 5 July 1947. The main propaganda of UMFO was to join the administrative state of Burma instead of India or independence. the UMFO eventually absorbed the supporters of the Mizo Union Council, thereby becoming the only political rival. At the election to Advisory Council of Mizoram, the first democratic election under independent India, Mizo Union received a massive win (23 against 1 for UMFO). That resulted in the loss of Burma inclination and also to the eventual demise of the UMFO.

When the Mizoram District Council was created by the Government of India, the first general election in April 1952 was cleanly captured by Mizo Union (17 out of 18 electorates), and President Lalsawia became the first Chief Executive Member.

=== Dedecline ===
If one person is to be singled out for the rise and fall of Mizo Union, it would invariably be an astute Ch. Saprawnga. From the start he was the instigator of the first coup in 1946. When the party won the first governmental election in 1952,Mizoram was a district of Assam, and Saprawnga as the leader of Assam Legislative Assembly members from Mizoram and was offered as an honour the position on Parliamentary Secretary under the ruling Assam Congress Party. The ever-strategic Saprawnga declined and unexpectedly returned to the Mizoram District and cast a motion of no confidence against CEM Lalsawia, whom he eventually replaced. The ingenious Saprawnga then designated Lalsawia as an executive member to the dismay of the party, especially President R. Thanhlira. After feud and friction in the party, Thanhlira conceded to resigning the presidency.

That led to factional divide of the party into two, Saprawnga&#x27;s and Lalsawia&#x27;s sides. The split in the party paid a serious blow when they almost lost to UMFO (11 against 8) in the 1957 election. To the blessing of Saprawnga, UMFO and Lalsawia with his clique decided to join a Meghalaya-based Eastern India Tribal Union (EITU) party in October 1957, so that Saprawnga was left with the sole political party of the land.

=== Dissolution ===
The principal goal of the Mizo Union, to subjugate customary tribal administration, was quite fulfilled by the creation of the democratic administration of the District Council. However, other causes independence and Greater Mizoram, were not. The original aspiration of sovereignty was immediately subdued, and the attempt for unification of all Mizo tribes into a united state was a total failure. Instead, the party was more and more engrossed in the Indian politics to the disappointment of many, whuich was one of the basic factors of the rise of Mizo National Front and the eventual uprising.

The party had no agenda for promotion of ethnic identity and social backlashes. The shortcoming was compounded by the 1959 famine, as the ruling party was held incapable of solving the socio-economic crisis, and was accused of indifference towards the suffering of the people. That prompted the organisation of Mizo National Front, which attempted to alleviate the situation and had a renewed struggle for independence. Theoe policies, as before, were closer to the sentiments of the people, and actually the sealed the fate of the Mizo Union. A scheduled 1966 election could not be held because of the insurgency, and internal politics as a whole was crushed. The Mizo Union was gradually disintegrating. The party assembly on 12 January 1974 therefore resolved to dissolve the party entirely and merged with Mizoram Pradesh Congress Committee. Although a few devotees of the party recreated the &quot;Mizo Union Party&quot; on 17 March 1974, they failed to make political landmarks.

== Ideology ==
The Mizo Union arose from the irate commoners of anachronism of the tribal administrative system in which a tribal chief had an absolute power on the welfare of the citizens, and that most often was exercised in prejudice. The original bearing &quot;Common&quot; was expressly clear that it was a force to overthrow the oppressive tribal governance of the chiefs, which was further exploited by the British. For that reason alone, it readily gained support from the majority of the population.

The 1947 conference explicitly voted against the oppressive tribal administration and demanded the total abolition of construction works by forced labour, paddy tax to the chief, the chief&#x27;s authoritative judgement of disputes the meat tax to the chief. The Mizo Union&#x27;s other central motive was to claim independent and sovereign state for Mizoram, instead of becoming a part of India. This aspiration also carried the unification of all Mizo clans into a single administrative area, that is to bring all lands inhabited by Mizo tribes including those of Cachar, Manipur, Tripura and Chin Hills into a united state. On the eve of the Indian Independence the party organised the firs- ever grand procession in Mizoram in which they cried out the slogan of independence. On the day of independence on 15 August 1947, they planned for a more jubilant demonstration. However, the Mizo Union Council, which had turned to patronise the tribal chiefs, warned them of physical opposition to such protest march even to the extent of taking up arms, and the rally was called off for fear of bloodshed.

The political aspiration shifted its direction when the intellectual group overtook the party administration. Although the fundamental objective remained independence, there was an influential view that the party should go for autonomy of some sort under Indian. Leaders of the party were on good terms with the Indian National Congress. The first General Assembly in 1946 had resolved that upon Indian independence, the Lushai Hills must be integrated to Assam. It was then in January 1947 that President Khawtinkhuma and Secretary Vanṭhuama wrote to the President of the Constituent Assembly of India that representative of the Mizo Union should be included in the Advisory Committee for the Tribal Areas of Assam. They submitted a memorandum to the Bordoloi Committee that they agreed the incorporation of the then Lushai Hills to India but on the condition &quot;that the Lushai&#x27;s will be allowed to opt out of the Indian Union when willing to do so subject to a minimum period of ten years&quot;.

At the turn of 1960, the attitude redirected towards permanent statehood under India. The party convention on 10 June 1963 made a resolution to demand for a Mizo state, which should include all Mizo-inhabited areas of Lushai Hills, Tripura, Assam and Manipur.

<text>In mathematics, a space form is a complete Riemannian manifold &quot;M&quot; of constant sectional curvature &quot;K&quot;. The three most fundamental examples are Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-space, the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional sphere, and hyperbolic space, although a space form need not be simply connected.

==Reduction to generalized crystallography==

The Killing–Hopf theorem of Riemannian geometry states that the universal cover of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional space form formula_1 with curvature formula_2 is isometric to formula_3, hyperbolic space, with curvature formula_4 is isometric to formula_5, Euclidean &quot;n&quot;-space, and with curvature formula_6 is isometric to formula_7, the n-dimensional sphere of points distance 1 from the origin in formula_8.

By rescaling the Riemannian metric on formula_3, we may create a space formula_10 of constant curvature formula_11 for any formula_12. Similarly, by rescaling the Riemannian metric on formula_7, we may create a space formula_10 of constant curvature formula_11 for any formula_16. Thus the universal cover of a space form formula_17 with constant curvature formula_11 is isometric to formula_10.

This reduces the problem of studying space forms to studying discrete groups of isometries formula_20 of formula_10 which act properly discontinuously. Note that the fundamental group of formula_17, formula_23, will be isomorphic to formula_20. Groups acting in this manner on formula_5 are called crystallographic groups. Groups acting in this manner on formula_26 and formula_27 are called Fuchsian groups and Kleinian groups, respectively.

<doc id="1087011" wikidata="Q8560" url="?curid=1087011" title="Yesün Temür (Yuan dynasty)">
<text>Yesün Temür (Mongolian: Есөн Төмөр ; , 1293 – August 15, 1328) was a great-grandson of Kublai Khan and an emperor of the Yuan dynasty of China from 1323 to 1328. Apart from being Emperor of China, he is regarded as the 10th Khagan of the Mongol Empire, although it was only nominal due to the division of the empire. In Chinese historiography, Yesün Temür, who was very fond of the traditional ways of the Mongols, is commonly known as the Taiding Emperor of Yuan () based on his first era name. His name means &quot;nine iron&quot; in the Mongolian language.

He was probably the emperor visited by the Franciscan friar Odoric, who left an excellent record of his travels.

==Early life==
Yesün Temür was born in Mongolia in 1293 to Gammala, the eldest son of Zhenjin, who was presumed heir to his father Kublai Khan. Gammala was appointed as Jinong (&quot;jinwang&quot;, 晉王) in 1292 after Zhenjin&#x27;s death, but he lost the race for successor to his younger brother Temür. Khanship was assumed by Temür, Darmabala, and their sons and grandson, so Gammala and his son Yesün Temür were out of the race. As Jinong, Gammala ruled the Mongolian steppe north of the Gobi Desert and enshrined Genghis Khan in the Four Great Ordo. In 1302 Gammala died and Yesün Temür took over as Jinong.

During the reigns of Kulug Khan, Ayurbarwada, and Gegeen Khan, Yesün Temür, who had a large fief and powerful army in the Mongolian steppe, became one of the princes most respected by the court and emerged as the undisputed leader of the princes in the steppe.

==Accession==
In 1323 when Shidebala Gegeen Khan (Emperor Yingzong) was assassinated by Grand Censor Tegshi and Esen Temur, the rebellious group welcomed Yesün Temür since his mother was Buyan Kelmish of the Khunggirad clan. According to the official history of the Yuan, Yesün Temür caused Tegshi&#x27;s envoy Walus to be seized and sent notice of the plot to Shidebala Khan, but the messengers arrived too late. 

Yesün Temür was not merely the principal beneficiary of the conspiracy but was also very likely a participant. It is said that his administrator Dawlat Shah had established close contact with the conspirators. After receiving the imperial seal sent by the conspirators, he ascended to the throne on the bank of the Kherlen River in Mongolia on October 4, 1323. Esen Temur was made the grand councilor of the right, and Tegshi the manager of the Bureau of Military Affairs. Upon learning that he would incur suspicion as a party to the murders, he suddenly reversed his policy and ordered Tegshi, Esen Temur, and others to be put to death. Under the leadership of Chang Kuei, the late Khagan&#x27;s officials sent a letter to Yesün Temür urging him to accept the throne and to punish the conspirators. He sent troops to Dadu and Shangdu and had rebellious officers executed before he entered Dadu because he feared becoming their puppet. The five princes who had been involved were exiled to Yunnan, Hainan, and other distant places. 

Chinese officials repeatedly urged Yesün Temür to extend the purge to all former allies of Temuder and Tegshi and their families, but Yesün Temür Khan refused. He issued an amnesty decree, and the confiscated properties of the executed conspirators were returned to their families.

== Administration ==

As a ruler who had seized the throne by intrigue and violence, Yesün Temür tried to win the widest possible support. To secure support as Emperor of China from the Han populace, he duly showed his respect for the Confucian tradition from the beginning of his reign. Nevertheless, Muslim and Mongol officials from the steppe constituted the majority of posts in the Yuan government during this period. Kumeijil and Tas Temur served as grand councillars of the right; Dawlat Shah served as the manager of the governmental affairs of the Central Secretariat (中書省), then as censor in chief, and finally as grand councillary of the left; and Andachu, the manager of the Bureau of Military Affairs. 

In addition to Dawlat Shah, there were two Muslims, Ubaidullah and Bayanchar, who served as managers of governmental affairs in the Secretariat. Mahumud Shah and Hasan Khoja managed the Bureau of Military Affairs. In contrast with the Muslims, Han officials exerted little influence on the administration. The high point of the Mongol partner-merchants&#x27; operations came under Yesün Temür, whose administration exempted Christians and Muslims from any corvee payments and guaranteed huge payments promised by the Mongolian nobility in return for luxury goods (тансаг).

Yesün Temür Khan denounced the extravagance of the court in buying costly precious stones, imported by foreign merchants, and sold for ten times their value, while the poor were starving. In 1326, Ozbeg Khan of the Golden Horde sent cheetahs to Yesün Temür Khan who responded with grants of gold, silver, cash, and silks.

During his reign Yesün Temür Khan divided the empire into eighteen departments controlled by a board called &quot;the Lords of the Provinces&quot;; it had formerly been divided into twelve units. Reports were presented on the condition of the Yuan provinces were full of complaints about the Lamas who, armed with their golden seals, rode about the province making exaction and treating the people in a shameful way. They put up at private houses, drove out their masters, debauched their wives, and did pretty much as they wished. The fear of offending the Mongols and the Lamas prevented the Khan from doing anything effectual at first. Finally, he forbade the Lamas from entering China. Besides Buddhism, Yesün Temür Khan neglected the ancient worship of the sky of the Mongols. 

Yesün Temür left the empire&#x27;s governance to his Muslim aide Dawlat Shah and Khatun Babukhan when he suddenly died in Shangdu on August 15, 1328. His son Ragibagh was installed by Dawlat Shah, but he was defeated by his rival Tugh Temür three months later during the War of the Two Capitals.

<text>The gerenuk (Litocranius walleri), also known as the giraffe gazelle, is a long-necked, medium-sized antelope found in parts of East Africa. The sole member of the genus Litocranius, the gerenuk was first described by the naturalist Victor Brooke in 1879. It is characterised by its long, slender neck and limbs. The antelope is tall, and weighs between . Two types of colouration are clearly visible on the smooth coat: the reddish brown back or the &quot;saddle&quot;, and the lighter flanks, fawn to buff. The horns, present only on males, are lyre-shaped. Curving backward then slightly forward, these measure .

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
The gerenuk was first described by Victor Brooke in 1879 on the basis of three male specimens procured on &quot;the mainland of Africa, north of the island of Zanzibar&quot;. Brooke used the scientific name &quot;Gazella walleri&quot;, on the request of Gerald Waller (who provided the specimens) to name it after his deceased brother. The type locality was later corrected by John Kirk, who originally obtained the specimens on the &quot;coast near the River Juba in southern Somalia&quot; before giving them to Waller. In 1886, Franz Friedrich Kohl proposed a new genus for the gerenuk, &quot;Litocranius&quot;. The common name derives from the Somali name for the animal (&quot;gáránúug&quot;); the first recorded use of the name dates back to 1895. It is also known as the &quot;giraffe gazelle&quot; due to its similarity to the giraffe.

Two subspecies have been proposed, but these are considered to be independent species by some authors.

* &quot;L. w. sclateri&quot; (Northern gerenuk or Sclater&#x27;s gazelle) : Its range extends from northwestern Somalia (Berbera District) westward to touch the Ethiopian border and Djibouti.
* &quot;L. w. walleri&quot; (Southern gerenuk or Waller&#x27;s gazelle) : Its range extends through northeastern Tanzania through Kenya to Galcaio (Somalia). The range lies north of the Shebelle River and near Juba River.

In 1997 Colin Groves proposed that &quot;Litocranius&quot; is a sister taxon of the similarly long-necked dibatag (&quot;Ammodorcas clarkei&quot;), but withdrew from this in 2000. A 1999 phylogenetic study based on cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase subunit III analysis showed that the tribe Antilopini, to which the gerenuk belongs, is monophyletic. In 2013, Eva Verena Bärmann and colleagues (of the University of Cambridge) revised the phylogeny of tribe on the basis of nuclear and mitochondrial gene analysis. The cladogram prepared by them (given below) showed that the springbok (&quot;Antidorcas marsupialis&quot;) forms a clade with the gerenuk; this clade is sister to the saiga (&quot;Saiga tatarica&quot;, tribe Saigini) and the genera &quot;Antilope&quot; (blackbuck), &quot;Eudorcas&quot;, &quot;Gazella&quot; and &quot;Nanger&quot; (of Antilopini).

== Description ==
The gerenuk is a notably tall, slender antelope that resembles gazelles. It is characterised by its long, slender neck and limbs, the flat, wedge-like head and the large, round eyes. Males are nearly tall, and the shorter females ; the head-and-body length is typically between . Males weigh between ; females are lighter, weighing . The species is sexually dimorphic. The tail, that ends in a black tuft, measures .

Two types of colouration are clearly visible on the smooth coat: the reddish brown dorsal parts (the back or the &quot;saddle&quot;), and the lighter flanks, fawn to buff. The underbelly and insides of the legs are cream in colour. The eyes and the mouth are surrounded by white fur. Females have a dark patch on the crown. The horns, present only on males, are lyre-like (S-shaped). Curving backward then slightly forward, these measure . 

The gerenuk resembles the dibatag, with which it is sympatric in eastern and central Somalia and southeastern Ethiopia. Both are brachyodonts and share several facial and cranial features, along with a two-tone colouration of the coat and strong thick horns (only in males). However, there are also some features distinguishing it from the gerenuk, including major morphological differences in horns, horn cores, tail, postorbital area and basioccipital processes. The gerenuk has a longer, heavier neck and a shorter tail. A finer point of difference is the absence of an inward-curving lobe in the lower edge of the ear (near its tip) in the gerenuk. The subspecies of the gerenuk are similar in colouration; the southern gerenuk is the smaller of the two. The Gerenuk stages of growth have a timespan from 4 months to 2.5 years: at four months, their shoulder height is about two-thirds of adult female, at six months their shoulder height is about three-quarters of adult female, at eight months their horn tips are clearly visible (about 1cm long), at one year their shoulder height is nearly equal to adult female but body more lightly built, their horns are slightly less than half ear-length, then curve, at two years their horns are about 1.5 times their ear length and the second curve becomes noticeable with the tips turning forwards, and finally at two and a half years the double curve in the horns are nearly completed.

==Ecology and behavior==
The gerenuk is a diurnal animal (active mainly during the day), though it typically stands or rests in shade during the noon. Foraging and feeding is the major activity throughout the day; females appear to spend longer time in feeding. The gerenuk may expose itself to rain, probably to cool its body. The social structure consists of small herds of two to six members. Herds typically comprise members of a single sex, though female herds additionally have juveniles. Some males lead a solitary life.

Fighting and travel are uncommon, possibly as a strategy to save energy for foraging. Both sexes maintain home ranges large, and might overlap. Those of males are scent-marked with preorbital gland secretions and guarded - hence these may be termed territories. The sedentary tendency of the antelope appears to increase with age.

==Diet==

Primarily a browser, the gerenuk feed on foliage of bushes as well as trees, shoots, herbs, flowers and fruits. It can reach higher branches and twigs better than other gazelles and antelopes by standing erect on its hindlegs and elongating its neck; this helps it reach over above the ground. &quot;Acacia&quot; species are eaten whenever available, while evergreen vegetation forms the diet during droughts. The pointed mouth assists in extracting leaves from thorny vegetation. The gerenuk does not drink water regularly. Major predators of the antelope include African wild dogs, cheetahs, hyenas, lions and leopards.

==Reproduction==
Gerenuk reproduce throughout the year. Females reach sexual maturity at around one year, and males reach sexual maturity at 1.5 years, although in the wild they may only be successful after acquiring a territory (perhaps 3.5 years). The gestation period is about seven months. They are born one at a time, weighing about at birth. Offspring were produced through artificial insemination for the first time in 2010 at White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida. Four female calves were born, and one of the four was later inseminated successfully by White Oak and SEZARC (South-East Zoo Alliance for Reproduction &amp; Conservation), creating a second generation of calves born from artificial insemination. Gerenuk can live thirteen years or more in captivity, and at least eight years in the wild.

<text>Quneitra (also Al Qunaytirah, Qunaitira, or Kuneitra; , &quot;al-Qunayṭrah&quot; or &quot;al-Qunayṭirah&quot; ) is the largely destroyed and abandoned capital of the Quneitra Governorate in south-western Syria. It is situated in a high valley in the Golan Heights at 1,010 metres (3,313 feet) above sea level. Since 1974, pursuant to United Nations Security Council Resolution 350 and the Agreement on Disengagement between Israel and Syria, the city is inside the UN-patrolled buffer zone.

Quneitra was founded in the Ottoman era as a way station on the caravan route to Damascus and subsequently became a garrison town of some 20,000 people. In 1946, it became part of the independent Syrian Republic within the Riff Dimashq Governorate and in 1964 became the capital of the split Quneitra Governorate. On 10 June 1967, the last day of the Six-Day War, Quneitra came under Israeli control. It was briefly recaptured by Syria during the 1973 Yom Kippur War, but Israel regained control in its subsequent counter-offensive. The city was almost completely destroyed by Israel before it withdrew in June 1974. Syria later refused to rebuild the city and actively discouraged resettlement in the area. Israel was heavily criticized by the United Nations for the city&#x27;s destruction, while Israel has also criticized Syria for not rebuilding Quneitra. 

In 2004, its population was estimated at 153 persons, with some 4,000 more living in the surrounding areas of the former city. 

During the Syrian Civil War, Quneitra became a clash point between rebel forces and Syrian Arab Army. Between 2014 and July 2018, Quneitra was &quot;de facto&quot; controlled by the Southern Front, a Syrian rebel alliance. By the end of July 2018, Syrian Government forces regained control over the city, until the rebels retook it.

Quneitra Came under the control of the Israeli armed forces following the fall of the al-Assad regime in December 2024.

==Etymology==
Qantara is the Arabic word for arched bridge. Quneitra means small arch or bridge, and the name is derived from the small-arches bridge around which the town has been built.

==Political status==

Quneitra is the capital of the Quneitra Governorate, a district of southwestern Syria that incorporates the whole of the Golan Heights. The city of Quneitra is within the portion of the Golan Heights controlled by Syria. Madinat al-Salam (Peace City), also known as New Quneitra, replaced Quneitra as the administrative centre of Quneitra Governorate.

==Geography and demographics==

Quneitra is situated in a high valley in the Golan Heights at an altitude of above sea level. It is overshadowed to the west by the Israeli-held portion of the Golan Heights and the peak of Har Bental. The surrounding area is dominated by ancient volcanic lava flows interspersed by a number of dormant volcanic cones which rise some above the surrounding plain. The volcanic hills of the region have played a key role as observation points and natural firing positions in the conflicts over the region, most notably in the Yom Kippur War. In more peaceful times, the fertile volcanic soil has supported agricultural activities such as wheat growing and pastoralism.

Writing during the inter-war period, the American traveler Harriet-Louise H. Patterson recorded that Quneitra was

The city&#x27;s position on an important trade route gave it a varied population for much of its history. By the start of the 20th century it was dominated by Muslim Circassians from the Caucasus, accompanied by Turkmen and Arabs. Its population grew to some 21,000 people, mostly Arabs, followed by Turkmen and Circassians, following Syrian independence from France in 1946. After its abandonment in 1967 and subsequent destruction, its population was dispersed to other parts of Syria. The city remains abandoned apart from a residual Syrian security presence. Due to frequent and large population movements within Syria and across borders caused by war, there are no reliable population estimates available post-2011. The impact of the crisis has led to massive displacements and a gradual deterioration of access to basic services. Quneitra has also been the destination for many internally displaced persons (IDPs) from neighbouring Daraa and Rif Dimashq governorates. In August 2013, many of the estimated 75,000 IDPs from Nawa and Al-Harra in Daraa Governorate reportedly fled to Quneitra.

==History==
===Prehistory===
The surrounding area has been inhabited for millennia. Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers are thought to have lived there, as evidenced by the discovery of Levallois and Mousterian flint tools in the vicinity.

===Hellenistic to Byzantine periods===
A settlement was established at least as early as the late Hellenistic period, and continued through the Roman and Byzantine times; it was known by the name &quot;Sarisai&quot;. The settlement served as a stop on the road from Damascus to western Palestine. Saint Paul is said to have passed through the settlement on his way from Jerusalem to Damascus. The site of the Conversion of Paul was traditionally identified with the small village of Kokab, north-east of Quneitra, on the road to Damascus.

===Late Ottoman period===
For much of the 18th and 19th centuries Quneitra was abandoned. In 1868 a travel handbook reported that the site was a &quot;ruined village of about 80 or 100 houses&quot; and that a large &quot;caravanserai&quot; also stood in ruins. Semi-nomadic pastoral groups such as the Arab Al Fadl and Banu Nu&#x27;aym tribes and several Turkmen tribes grazed their flocks in Quneitra&#x27;s rocky lands.

In 1873, a group of Circassians from Sivas in Anatolia settled in Quneitra. This initial group did not cultivate the area for a number of years. A second wave of Circassians, numbering about 2,000, arrived in the Golan in 1878 via Acre after fleeing Bulgaria due to the Russo-Turkish War. Along with Quneitra, they settled or built number of other villages in the vicinity. The Circassians began farming the area and each family was given title to 70 to 130 dunams of land by the government depending on the family&#x27;s size. The Ottomans encouraged Circassian settlement in the Golan as a means to drive a wedge between the frequently rebellious Druze villages of Mount Hermon and those in Jabal Hauran. The Circassians of Quneitra engaged in sustained conflicts with the Druze and the Al Fadl through the remainder of the 19th century.

Modern Quneitra grew around the nucleus of the old Ottoman caravanserai, which had been built using the stones of a ruined ancient settlement. By the mid-1880s, Quneitra had become the main city and seat of government of the Golan. Gottlieb Schumacher wrote in 1888 that it &quot;consists of 260 buildings, which are mostly well and carefully constructed of basalt stones, and contains, excluding the soldiers and officials, 1,300 inhabitants, principally Circassians.&quot; Circassians moved away from the Golan beginning after the Six-Day War and again after the fall of the Soviet Union.

During World War I, the Australian Mounted Division and 5th Cavalry Division defeated the Ottoman Turks at Quneitra on 29 September 1918, before they took Damascus (see also Battle of Megiddo (1918)).

===Second World War===
Quneitra saw several battles during the Syria-Lebanon Campaign of the Second World War, including the Battle of Damascus and Battle of Kissoué.

===Arab-Israeli conflict===
When the modern states of Syria and Israel gained their independence from France and Britain respectively after the Second World War, Quneitra gained a new strategic significance as a key road junction some from the border. It became a prosperous market town and military garrison, with its population tripling to over 20,000 people, predominately Arabs.

====Six-Day War====
Quneitra was the Syrian headquarters for the Golan Heights. The Israeli capture of the city occurred in chaotic circumstances on 10 June 1967, the last day of the Six-Day War. Israeli forces advancing towards Quneitra from the north-west prompted Syrian troops to deploy north of the city, under heavy bombardment, to defend the road to Damascus. At , Syrian radio broadcast an announcement that the city had fallen, though it actually had not. Alarmed, the Syrian Army&#x27;s redeployment turned into a chaotic retreat along the Damascus road.

According to 8th Brigade Commander Ibrahim Isma&#x27;il Khahya:
We received orders to block the roads leading to Quneitra. But then the fall of the city was announced and that caused many of my soldiers to leave the front and run back to Syria while the roads were still open. They piled onto vehicles. It further crushed our morale. I retreated before I ever saw an enemy soldier. 
Although a correction was broadcast two hours later, the Israelis took advantage of the confusion to seize Quneitra. An armoured brigade under Colonel Albert Mandler entered Quneitra at and found the city deserted and strewn with abandoned military equipment. One of the Israeli commanders later commented:

We arrived almost without hindrance to the gates of Quneitra ... All around us there were huge quantities of booty. Everything was in working order. Tanks with their engines still running, communication equipment still in operation, had been abandoned. We captured Quneitra without a fight.

&quot;Time&quot; magazine reported: &quot;In an effort to pressure the United Nations into enforcing a ceasefire, Damascus Radio undercut its own army by broadcasting the fall of the city of El Quneitra three hours before it actually capitulated. That premature report of the surrender of their headquarters destroyed the morale of the Syrian troops left in the Golan area.&quot;

A ceasefire was agreed later in the afternoon, leaving Quneitra under Israeli control. In June 1967, &quot;Time&quot; magazine wrote that: &quot;The city of El Quneitra was a ghost town, its shops shuttered, its deserted streets patrolled by Israelis on house-to-house searches for caches of arms and ammunition. The hills echoed with explosions as Israeli sappers systematically destroyed the miniature Maginot line from which the Syrians had shelled kibbutzim across the Sea of Galilee.&quot;

The United Nations Special Representative, Nils-Göran Gussing, visited it in July and reported that &quot;nearly every shop and every house seemed to have been broken into and looted&quot; and that some buildings had been set on fire after they had been stripped. Although Israeli spokesmen told Gussing that Quneitra had actually been looted by the withdrawing Syrians, the UN representative viewed this as unlikely given the extremely short space of time between the erroneous radio announcement and the fall of the city a few hours later. He concluded that &quot;responsibility for this extensive looting of the town of Quneitra lay to a great extent with the Israeli forces.&quot;

Circassian dispersion from the Golan began after the Six-Day War, then additional numbers moved to the Caucasus after the fall of the Soviet Union.

====Israeli occupation====
The deserted city remained in Israeli hands for the next six years. However, Israel and Syria remained in a state of war throughout this period (and, indeed, to the present day). The town gained a fresh symbolic value; it was seen by the Syrians as &quot;the badge of Syria&#x27;s defeat, an emblem of hatred between Syria and Israel and a cross [Syrian President Hafez al-Assad] had to bear.&quot; Syria shelled the city several times during the early 1970s; in June 1970 a Syrian armored unit launched an attack, and in November 1972, Damascus radio announced that Syrian artillery had again shelled Quneitra.

====Yom Kippur War====

During the first few days of the Yom Kippur War in 1973, Quneitra was briefly recaptured by the Syrian Army before it was repulsed in an Israeli counter-offensive. 
In the middle of October 1973 the Israeli counter-offensive started. The Syrians had massed nearly 1,000 tanks along a front. With a massive concentration of tanks, the Israelis lashed into the Syrian forces. The Syrians at first fell back, but then managed to counterattack and drive back into occupied territory. Quneitra changed hands several times. Finally, Israeli armored units, closely supported by Phantoms and Skyhawks performing close air support with napalm strikes against the forward Syrian units, halted the Syrian drive and turned the Syrian Army back.

====Destruction of Quneitra and return to Syrian control====
Israel continued to control the city until early June 1974, when it was returned to Syrian civilian control following the signature of a United States-brokered disengagement agreement signed on 31 May 1974. The surrender of Quneitra was controversial, with Israeli settlers and the Likud and National Religious Party opposing it. According to Michael Mandelbaum, the agreement provided that the city was to be repopulated to serve as evidence of peaceful Syrian intentions, by doing so it would encourage the Israelis to pull back further.

In an attempt to block the withdrawal, a group of settlers from Merom Golan – a settlement established in 1967 – took over an abandoned bunker in Quneitra and declared it to be a new settlement called Keshet (Quneitra in Hebrew). The settlers also set about razing the existing town to the ground. The leader of Merom Golan, Yehuda Harel, and another Merom Golan member, Shimshon Wollner, initiated the destruction of Quneitra, which was carried out by the Land Development Administration of the Jewish National Fund. Harel later described what happened:

Wollner and Harel asked the Jewish National Fund to carry out the work, ostensibly to prepare an area for agricultural cultivation, but were refused as they did not have permission from the Israeli army. They then approached the Assistant to the Head of Northern Command and asked him to mark on a map which buildings the army needed. According to Harel,

The buildings were systematically stripped, with anything movable being removed and sold to Israeli contractors, before they were pulled apart with tractors and bulldozers.

The disengagement went into force on 6 June. On 26 June, the Syrian president Hafez al-Assad travelled to Quneitra where he pledged to return the rest of the occupied territories to Syrian control. Western reporters accompanied Syrian refugees returning to the city in early July 1974 and described what they saw on the ground. &quot;Time&quot; magazine&#x27;s correspondent reported that &quot;Most of its buildings are knocked flat, as though by dynamite, or pockmarked by shellfire.&quot; &quot;Le Monde&quot;&#x27;s Syria correspondent, in a report for &quot;The Times&quot;, gave a detailed eyewitness description of the destruction:

Today the city is unrecognisable. The houses with their roofs lying on the ground look like gravestones. Parts of the rubble are covered with fresh earth furrowed by bulldozer tracks. Everywhere there are fragments of furniture, discarded kitchen utensils, Hebrew newspapers dating from the first week of June; here a ripped-up mattress, there the springs of an old sofa. On the few sections of wall still standing, Hebrew inscriptions proclaim: &quot;There&#x27;ll be another round&quot;; &quot;You want Quneitra, you&#x27;ll have it destroyed.&quot;

Israel asserted that most of the damage had been caused in the two wars and during the artillery duels in between. Several reports from before the withdrawal did refer to the city as &quot;ruined&quot; and &quot;shell-scarred&quot;. &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; correspondent saw the city for himself on 6 May, a month before the Israeli withdrawal, and described it as being &quot;in ruins and deserted after seven years of war and dereliction. It looks like a wild west city struck by an earthquake and if the Syrians get it back they will face a major feat of reconstruction. Nearly every building is heavily damaged and scores have collapsed.&quot;

Direct evidence of the city&#x27;s condition was provided when it was filmed on 12 May 1974 by a British television news team which included the veteran journalist Peter Snow, who was reporting for Independent Television News on the disengagement negotiations. His report was broadcast on ITN&#x27;s &quot;News at Ten&quot; programme. According to &quot;The Times&quot;&#x27; correspondent Edward Mortimer, &quot;viewers were thus afforded a panoramic view of the city, which had stood almost completely empty since the Syrian army evacuated it in 1967. It could be seen that many of the buildings were damaged, but most of them were still standing.&quot; After it was handed over, &quot;very few buildings were left standing. Most of those destroyed did not present the jagged outline and random heaps of rubble usually produced by artillery or aerial bombardment. The roofs lay flat on the ground, &#x27;pancaked&#x27; in a manner which I am told can only be achieved by systematic dynamiting of the support walls inside.&quot; Mortimer concluded that the footage &quot;establishes beyond reasonable doubt that much of the destruction took place after 12 May—at a time when there was no fighting anywhere near Kuneitra.&quot;

The United Nations established a &quot;Special Committee to Investigate Israeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the Population of the Occupied Territories&quot;, which engaged a Swiss engineer Edward Gruner to investigate the damage. Gruner and a team of surveyors spent four months in Quneitra, documenting every building and its condition. His report concluded that Israeli forces had deliberately destroyed the city prior to their withdrawal, including almost 4,000 buildings and a large amount of infrastructure, of value estimated at 463 million Syrian pounds. The report&#x27;s conclusions were subsequently adopted by the United Nations General Assembly. It passed a resolution on 29 November 1974 describing the destruction of Quneitra as &quot;a grave breach of the [Fourth] Geneva Convention&quot; and &quot;condemn[ing] Israel for such acts,&quot; by a margin of 93 votes to 8, with 74 abstentions. The United Nations Commission on Human Rights also voted to condemn the &quot;deliberate destruction and devastation&quot; of Quneitra in a resolution of 22 February 1975, by a margin of 22 votes to one (the United States) with nine abstentions.

====As a city ruin====

The city remains in a destroyed condition. Syria has left the ruins in place and built a museum to memorialize its destruction. It maintains billboards at the ruins of many buildings and effectively preserves it in the condition that the Israeli army left it in. The former residents of the town have not returned and Syria discourages the re-population of the area. However, in the 2004 census by the Central Bureau of Statistics, a small population of 153 people living in 28 households was recorded, all living in the neighborhood of Rasm al-Rawabi. The &quot;Rough Guide to Syria&quot; describes the appearance of the city in 2001: &quot;The first sight of the flattened houses on Quneitra&#x27;s outskirts is the most dramatic; many of the unscathed roofs simply lie on top of a mass of rubble, leaving the impression of a building that has imploded.&quot;

The city has often been used as a stop for foreign VIPs, ranging from the Soviet foreign minister Alexei Kosygin in June 1976 to Pope John Paul II in May 2001. Only a handful of families now live in the town, making a living by providing services for the United Nations troops patrolling the demilitarized zone. According to &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;the carefully preserved ruined city has become a pilgrimage site for a generation of Syrians.&quot;

Prior to the Syrian Civil War, the city could be visited by tourists with a permit from the Syrian Ministry of the Interior and under the supervision of a military guide. The principal sights on the standard tour were the remains of Quneitra&#x27;s hospital, mosque and Greek Orthodox church. A &quot;Liberated Quneitra Museum&quot;, displaying artifacts from the city&#x27;s ancient and medieval past, is housed in the former Ottoman Turkish caravanserai in the city centre. The western edge of the city marks the start of &quot;no-man&#x27;s land&quot; beyond which lies Israeli-controlled territory. It was and still is not possible to visit Quneitra directly from Israel.

===Syrian Civil War===
On 13 November 2012, during the ongoing Syrian Civil War, which had begun in March 2011, Syria′s president Bashar al-Assad issued a decreed establishment of a branch of the University of Damascus in Quneitra. 

On 6 June 2013, the nearby Quneitra border crossing was attacked by rebel forces and temporarily occupied, with Syrian army later retaking the crossing; In July 2013, opposition forces attacked a military checkpoint in Quneitra, and by the next day were attacking several Syrian Arab Army positions in Quneitra. 

In August 2014, rebel forces captured the crossing. A Filipino peacekeeper of the UNDOF was wounded during the fighting. As a result the Austrian government announced the withdrawal of its troops from the UN mission.

On 26 July 2018, the Syrian Army took back the town of Quneitra after rebels surrendered and handed over the heavy and medium weapons to army.

<text>Alversund is a village in Alver municipality in Vestland county, Norway. The village is located on the mainland of the Lindås peninsula, along the shore of the Alverstraumen strait. The village sits between the villages of Alverstraumen (across the strait) and Alver (to the south), forming a large village area that is often referred to as Alversund.
The Alversund Bridge spans the Alverstraumen strait between Alversund and the village area of Alverstraumen located on the southern tip of the island of Radøy, creating a vital connection between Radøy and the mainland. In Alversund there is a primary school counting 400 pupils. Alversund Church (&quot;Alversund kyrkje&quot;) dates from 1879 and it is located in the village, along the main road. It was built of wood and has 200 seats. The village was historically the administrative centre of the old municipality of Alversund which existed from 1885 until 1964.

Among other things one will find &quot;Den Gamle Bokstova&quot;, a book café where a small group of people meets 6-8 times a year to discuss literature. The building dates from the 16th century and is a former bank, library, and community house.

==Name==
The municipality (originally the parish) is named after the old Alver farm (Old Norse: &quot;Alviðra&quot;) since the first church was built there. The meaning of the name is &quot;all weather&quot; (meaning &quot;weather from all directions&quot; - describing a farm with an exposed and unsheltered site). The last element is &quot;sund&quot; which means &quot;sound&quot; or &quot;strait&quot;, referring to Alverstraumen strait.

==Notable residents==
*Ivar Medaas (1938–2005), folksinger and fiddle player
*Hans Karolus Ommedal (1901–1984), politician for the Christian Democratic Party
*Nils Hjelmtveit (1892–1985), educator and politician for the Labour Party

<doc id="1087060" wikidata="Q5265661" url="?curid=1087060" title="Detente bala">
<text>&quot;Detente bala&quot; is an inscription used by Spanish soldiers from the 18th century.

The phrase &quot;detente bala&quot; means &quot;stop, bullet&quot; in Spanish. The whole motto is usually written meaning: &quot;Stop, bullet, the Sacred Heart of Jesus is with me (or protects me)!&quot; 

Patches of cloth with the phrase around a Sacred Heart of Jesus were worn on the chest as a protection and later as a piece of cloth under the name/rank badge (usually as close to the heart as possible).
The devotion is derived by the badges of the Sacred Heart promoted by 17th-century saint Margaret Mary Alacoque against epidemics.
They are still used by the Spanish soldiers in the 21st century.

The history of the use of the &quot;Detente bala&quot; dates back to 1686. Popular belief explains that Saint Margaret Mary Alacoque started the custom of wearing a small cloth emblem with the image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus as a symbol of devotion. This symbol soon began to spread as a protection &quot;amulet&quot; against the epidemics that devastated Europe with the name of &quot;Safeguard&quot; initially and &quot;stop&quot; with the passage of time. It is from the eighteenth century when its use became popular among Spanish soldiers. Tradition has it that the &quot;Detente bala&quot; were embroidered by hand by the wives, mothers or sisters of the combatants before they left for the war, in the hope that they would stop the bullets that threatened their lives and return them safe and sound to their homes.

<doc id="1087061" wikidata="Q1689427" url="?curid=1087061" title="Jimmy Quillen">
<text>James Henry Quillen (January 11, 1916 – November 2, 2003) was an American politician who served as a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Tennessee from 1963 to 1997. Quillen represented the 1st congressional district, which covers the northeast corner of the state, including the Tri-Cities region.

==Early life==
Quillen was born in Scott County, Virginia, the fifth of ten children, son of John A. and Hannah Quillen, near the Tennessee line and was later a 1934 graduate of Dobyns-Bennett High School in Kingsport, Tennessee. Quillen worked as a restaurant kitchen prep worker, a grocery store clerk, a copy boy, and later as a young adult, an advertising salesman for a Kingsport newspaper.

During 1936, Quillen invested his own personal savings of $42 to become the publisher and owner of &quot;The Kingsport Mirror&quot;, a weekly newspaper that he started in Kingsport, Tennessee. Quillen sold &quot;The Kingsport Mirror&quot; during 1939 and moved to Johnson City, Tennessee (where he resided at the Montrose Court Apartments) to start up another weekly newspaper, &quot;The Johnson City Times&quot;.

==Draft exemption and military service==
Prior to the U.S. entry into World War II, Quillen received a two-year Selective Service System Class 3-A draft deferment beginning in December 1940 through late November 1942.

Quillen later served in the United States Navy as a public information officer from late 1942 to 1946. Quillen received his overseas orders in late 1944, with his assignment aboard the Ticonderoga class aircraft carrier USS &quot;Antietam&quot; (CV-36).

The USS &quot;Antietam&quot; entered the Pacific theater of operations too late in the war to participate in combat, as the carrier arrived in Hawaii from the Panama Canal just as the first atomic bomb was dropped by the United States on Japan.

==Entry into state and party politics==
Eventually becoming a Kingsport and Johnson City based real estate development and insurance company owner (starting Kingsport Development Company, Inc.), and bank executive following World War II, Quillen also was elected as a Republican member of the Tennessee House of Representatives in 1954, serving four terms from a district in Sullivan County.

Quillen was later selected as a Tennessee delegate to the Republican National Convention in 1956, 1964, and 1968.

==Elected into the U.S. Congress==

During 1961, B. Carroll Reece, who had represented Tennessee&#x27;s 1st congressional district for all but six of the last 40 years, died in office. His wife, Louise, took over as a caretaker until the next election. Quillen decided not to run for a fifth term in the state house in 1962, instead seeking the Republican nomination for the 1st District. This region was one of the few ancestrally Republican regions of the South; its voters had identified with the Republicans after the Civil War and had remained staunchly Republican ever since; indeed, Reece was one of the few truly senior Republican congressmen elected from a Southern state before the 1950s.

Quillen won a five-way Republican primary with only 28 percent of the vote, and won the general election with 53.8 percent of the vote. He was reelected 16 more times. Apart from his initial run for the seat, he only faced one relatively close contest, when he was held to 57 percent of the vote in 1976. The 1962 and 1976 contests were the only times that Quillen dropped below 64 percent of the vote and are the only times since 1898 that a Democrat has even managed 40 percent of the vote in this district. Quillen faced no major-party opposition in 1966 and 1980, and was completely unopposed in 1984 and 1990. Quillen eventually became de facto leader of the Republican Party in East Tennessee, and thus a statewide power broker within the tight circle of Tennessee Republican politics.

Quillen&#x27;s popularity was not due only to his district&#x27;s heavy Republican tilt, but also because he was widely perceived as providing strong constituent service. However, during his 34 years in Congress, Quillen managed to sponsor only three pieces of original federal legislation (including his legislation pertaining to the social security &quot;notch babies&quot; benefit adjustment and an anti-flag desecration amendment to the U.S. Constitution).

=== Social security &quot;notch babies&quot; ===
First surfacing as a federal legislative issue after the U.S. Congress decided to automatically link social security benefit increases to the consumer price index beginning in 1972, a cohort of social security retirees born during the period of 1910 through 1916 received undue windfall of payments from the federal taxpayers through the Social Security Administration miscalculating social security benefits based upon the 1910–1916 cohort. Social security retirees born immediately afterwards during the so-called &quot;notch&quot; period running approximately from 1917 to 1921–such as Quillen&#x27;s wife Cecile–perceived agency mistreatment and petitioned members of Congress for a similar upward and unwarranted windfall adjustment for payments to their own social security benefits.

==Controversies==
Quillen amassed a large campaign treasury due to having received many large individual and PAC contributions, including those well financed PACs representing the beer, wine, and spirits beverage industries. Another important fact buttressing Quillen&#x27;s re-election campaign finance efforts, according to Vin Weber of the Brookings Institution, was the Northeast Tennessee congressman&#x27;s &quot;...tremendous success...in shaking down the business community for [campaign] contributions.&quot; However, he never had to use much of this fund due to his district&#x27;s heavy Republican bent.

=== Quillen twice voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 ===
Quillen voted twice against the enactment of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 () is a landmark civil rights and US labor law in the United States that outlaws discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. It ended unequal application of voter registration requirements and racial segregation in schools, at the workplace and by facilities that served the general public (known as &quot;public accommodations&quot;).

Quillen first voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1964 on February 10, 1964, and again on July 2, 1964, when the bill came back to the U.S. House of Representatives for a final vote with an amendment attached to the original bill by the U.S. Senate. Congress asserted its authority to legislate under several different parts of the United States Constitution, principally its power to regulate interstate commerce under Article One (section 8), its duty to guarantee all citizens equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment, and its duty to protect voting rights under the Fifteenth Amendment. The final version of Civil Rights Act of 1964 was signed into law later on that same day by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 2, 1964, at the White House.

=== Quillen introduces amendment to the Teague-Cranston Act ===
In April 1971, U.S. Representative Olin Teague of Texas introduced a bill to create five medical schools in conjunction with established VA hospitals and U.S. Senator Alan Cranston of California introduced a companion bill within the U.S. Senate. Known as the Teague-Cranston Act, the federal legislative proposal called for the creation of five new medical schools in five states to meet the needs of the medically underserved areas of the country.

Quillen frequently reported to Tennessee news media that he himself had introduced an amendment to the Teague-Cranston Act legislation which required that any university to be considered for acceptance into this pilot program must be on government property contiguous and adjacent to a VA hospital, as East Tennessee State University was adjacent to the Mountain Home VA Hospital. However, the October 4, 1993, edition of the &quot;Kingsport Times-News&quot; released an investigative report entitled &quot;Story of ETSU medical school&#x27;s founding not always in agreement with facts&quot; documented several facts pertaining to the Teague-Cranston Act that disputed Quillen&#x27;s district claim of his amendment sponsorship:
* one of the Teague-Cranston Act medical schools &quot;was established at Texas A&amp;M&quot; within the district of U.S. Rep. Olin Teague and located about seventy miles away from the nearest Veterans Administration hospital;
* Quillen only become a signatory sponsor two months after Teague had introduced the original bill specifying the creation of medical colleges in medically under served areas of the United States;
* the Teague-Cranston Act was never in any danger of failing within the U.S. House of Representatives, and the legislation had actually been passed in the House by an overwhelming margin. and;
* a memo from the Nixon Administration indicates that Nixon signed the bill &quot;... primarily as an election-year gesture toward veterans.&quot;

The Teague-Cranston Act passed without a dissenting vote in October 1972, and was signed by U.S. President Richard Nixon.

=== Renaming of ETSU Quillen-Dishner College of Medicine ===
While serving as Governor of Tennessee, fellow Republican Winfield Dunn incurred Quillen&#x27;s wrath by vetoing a bill establishing a medical school at East Tennessee State University. Dunn claimed that Tennessee lacked the resources to adequately staff and fund two first-rate medical schools and that more resources should instead be devoted to the existing medical school in Memphis, which was approximately 500 miles from Quillen&#x27;s district.

One reason for Quillen&#x27;s anger may have been that Dunn was from Memphis himself, and perhaps Quillen felt that Dunn was showing too much favoritism to his hometown. There has been considerable acrimony between East Tennessee and the state&#x27;s other grand divisions dating back to settlement times. Whatever the case, Quillen never forgave Dunn, and it came back to haunt Dunn when he ran for governor again in 1986. Quillen made it known in East Tennessee Republican circles that Dunn was &quot;not&quot; to be supported. Dunn managed to overcome Quillen&#x27;s opposition and won the nomination. However, without significant support in East Tennessee, Dunn stood almost no chance against the popular Democratic State House Speaker, Ned McWherter. Only a large turnout in his former Memphis base kept the margin of defeat to under nine points.

The ETSU medical school was subsequently built anyway after the legislature overrode Dunn&#x27;s veto, and opened as the ETSU Quillen-Dishner College of Medicine. The name of one of the school&#x27;s early benefactors and teachers, Paul Dishner, was later removed in the wake of a &quot;homosexual sex scandal&quot;, and is now officially known as the East Tennessee State University James H. Quillen College of Medicine.

=== Quillen&#x27;s Kingsport Development Co. ===
In 1972, a public interest task force led by Ralph Nader pointed a very public finger at Rep. Quillen, accusing the congressman of using his elected office to &quot;...promote his business interests, specifically insurance sales through Kingsport Development Co., Inc.&quot;, a Kingsport-based real estate and insurance agency owned by Quillen.

=== USPS recall of 1980 Olympic postage stamps ===
In 1980, UPI Washington syndicated news reported that the United States Postal Service was &quot;...investigating whether Rep. James H. Quillen, R-Tenn. illegally purchased hundreds of commemorative Olympic postage stamps after they were recalled&quot; after the &quot;stamps were ordered recalled last March 11 because of the U.S. boycott of the summer games in Moscow, and those stamps had been previously sold became collectors&#x27; items.&quot; A USPS spokesman said that postal inspectors were looking into whether Quillen had purchased the stamps before or after the recall order.

=== Savings and Loan &quot;supervisory goodwill&quot; ===
In 1989, Quillen (also a banker) worked against pending legislation for the savings and loan industry that would prohibit S&amp;Ls from carrying &quot;supervisory goodwill&quot;—a form of phantom capital to count toward their capital requirements&quot; for accounting and regulatory reports.

=== Passed over for Rules Committee chairmanship ===
Quillen&#x27;s fellow Republicans passed him over in 1990 for consideration as ranking Republican on the House Rules Committee in favor of Gerald Solomon of New York, even though Quillen was the committee&#x27;s most senior member. An unnamed fellow committee member was once quoted by the Kingsport Times-News (October 4, 1992) as saying, &quot;Jimmy&#x27;s one helluva nice guy, ... but let&#x27;s face it. He couldn&#x27;t organize a one-car funeral.&quot; He thus lost a chance to become the committee&#x27;s chairman when the Republicans later gained control of Congress after the 1994 elections—thus making him one of the longest-serving congressmen to have never chaired a committee.

=== Rebuking 1992 presidential candidate Clinton as a &quot;draft dodger&quot; ===
The October 25, 1992, edition of the &quot;Johnson City Press&quot; reported that both Quillen and former U.S. Senate Howard Baker, while in Jonesborough, Tennessee on their Bush/Quayle/Quillen Victory Bus tour, attacked the character of U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bill Clinton with Quillen telling the assembled crowd, &quot;We don&#x27;t want a draft dodger as President of the United States.,&quot; and referring to the 1992 elections as &quot;a national crisis&quot;. Quillen had himself avoided conscription into military service during the early 1940s, but later served in the U.S. Navy from late 1942 to 1946.

=== &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; Congressional &quot;baseball hitting percentages&quot; ===
In 1993, a study first featured within the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; used a baseball hitting percentages statistical analogy to rate the effectiveness of members of the U.S. Congress, listed Quillen with a .000 average.

=== Support of NAFTA and GATT ===
Quillen voted for approval of the 1994 modifications to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and approval of the North American Free Trade Agreement.

==Retirement==
Quillen did decide to retire prior to the 1996 election and was succeeded by circuit court judge Bill Jenkins, a fellow Republican.

Quillen holds the record for the longest unbroken tenure of a Tennessean within the U.S. House of Representatives. Only Reece had been elected to more terms in the House (18 terms to Quillen&#x27;s 17), and only Kenneth McKellar had served in both chambers longer.

After retiring, Quillen was inducted as an honorary member of the East Tennessee State University chapter of Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

Quillen died on November 2, 2003, and was buried at Oak Hill Cemetery in Kingsport.

Quillen&#x27;s estate was valued at approximately $17 million, with the majority going to schools in his district. King College, Milligan College, Carson-Newman College, and Tusculum College each received $250,000 for scholarships. East Tennessee State University received an estimated $14.6 million for two scholarship endowments, including one for students of James H. Quillen College of Medicine.

The East Tennessee State University Charles C. Sherrod Library also maintains the &quot;Quillen Congressional Office and Gallery&quot; on the fourth floor of the building, serving as a memorabilia shrine with an exact size replica of longtime U.S. Congressional Representative James H. Quillen&#x27;s former Washington, D.C., office within the U.S. House of Representatives.

<doc id="1087064" wikidata="Q2985114" url="?curid=1087064" title="Xfinity Center (College Park, Maryland)">
<text>Xfinity Center is the indoor arena and student activities center that serves as the home of the University of Maryland Terrapins men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. Ground was broken in May 2000 and construction was completed in October 2002 at a cost of $125 million. It replaced Cole Field House as the Terrapins&#x27; home court, which had served as the home of Maryland basketball since 1955.

The on-campus facility was originally named the Comcast Center after Comcast Corporation purchased a 20-year, $25 million corporate naming agreement when the arena opened in 2002. In July 2014, it was renamed Xfinity Center after Comcast&#x27;s cable brand, Xfinity.

Xfinity Center, which has a capacity of 17,950, opened for Midnight Madness on October 11, 2002, and the first official men&#x27;s game was a 64–49 victory over Miami University (Ohio) on November 24, 2002. In its first season, 281,057 fans visited to watch Terrapin basketball games for a per-game average of 17,566 as Maryland finished fifth in the nation in attendance. On January 25, 2012, the court was renamed in honor of Gary Williams, the men&#x27;s basketball coach who retired the previous year.

Though Xfinity Center is the largest arena in the state of Maryland, it is the second-largest arena in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area by seating capacity, just behind Capital One Arena in Washington, D.C., which has an official seating capacity of roughly 500 more than Xfinity Center. The facility is also used for concerts, graduation ceremonies including those for the University of Maryland, state high school basketball tournaments, and other special events. Concert seating capacity is nearly 19,000.


==Amenities==
In addition to the main basketball court, Xfinity Center also features a 1,500-seat gymnasium for volleyball, gymnastics, and wrestling, and a academic support center for student-athletes. The facility also holds Heritage Hall, a 400-seat multi-purpose room overlooking the arena&#x27;s seating bowl equipped to host banquets, press conferences, meetings and serve as a pregame restaurant. The team&#x27;s athletic store and university athletic offices are located in the facility as well. Inside the lobby on the east side of the facility is the Terrapin Walk of Fame and History, featuring many images of the past of Maryland athletics as well as the 2002 men&#x27;s national championship trophy and the 2006 women&#x27;s national championship trophy.

In 2014, the university replaced the building&#x27;s original scoreboard with a new, start-of-the-art center hung Daktronics videoboard that features two side displays measuring approximately high by wide and two end displays measuring approximately high by wide making it one of the largest jumbotrons in college basketball. The videoboard can display one single image to show live video and replays, but can also be divided into separate windows to display graphics, animations, game statistics, scoring information and advertisements. The Xfinity Center also features four message displays in each corner of the facility that are used to display closed captioning.

==Student section==

The student section contains 4,000 seats arranged in the first ten rows on all sides of the arena, among the largest student sections in the Big Ten. The most notable feature of the arena is the steeply pitched kop-style seating area at the west end of the arena behind the visiting team&#x27;s second half basket, informally known as &quot;the Wall.&quot; Originally designed to reduce excavation costs due to a hill, the area features 2,600 student seats meant to intimidate opposing players who shoot free throws in the second half. Maryland has long had a reputation for having one of the most raucous student sections in the nation for several years before Xfinity Center opened in 2002, and &quot;FanSided&quot; ranked Xfinity as the fifteenth-best college basketball atmosphere in 2018.

Because of the athletic department&#x27;s online lottery system which distributes tickets to students, most games are student sell-outs. Student attendance is typically highest for conference games, non-conference games against top teams (such as the annual Big Ten-ACC Challenge), and the annual &quot;Maryland Madness&quot; event (formerly, though still colloquially, known as &quot;Midnight Madness&quot;) held in October to signify the official start of the college basketball season. Attendance by students is generally lowest for early season exhibition and non-conference games, as well as games played while the students are on Thanksgiving and winter break.

==Notable games at Xfinity Center==
*December 14, 2002 – In Maryland&#x27;s debut game against a ranked opponent at the new arena, they fell to the #17 University of Florida Gators, 69–64. Despite a valiant effort, Maryland&#x27;s inability to contain Anthony Roberson from behind the arc and shooting just 36% from the free throw line led to a less than auspicious christening of the facility against a ranked opponent.
*January 18, 2003 – The Terrapins defeated then undefeated #1 Duke, 87–72.
*February 17, 2003 – Due to a major snowstorm in the area, the game against #10 Wake Forest was postponed from the previous night. Since most ticket holders were unable to travel to College Park, the athletic department instituted an open attendance policy. Anyone with a valid student ID was given free admission and the general public was charged $20. The near-capacity crowd was composed mostly of students enjoying their snowday, and the Terrapins defeated the Demon Deacons, 90–67.
*February 22, 2004 – The third largest crowd to watch an Atlantic Coast Conference women&#x27;s regular season basketball game and the second largest crowd to watch a women&#x27;s game at the arena (13,346), went home disappointed as No. 4-ranked Duke defeated the Terrapins 72–59.
*February 12, 2005 – The Terrapins won their third consecutive game against Duke and became first team to sweep the regular season series from the Blue Devils since Wake Forest did it during 1995–96 season. The 99–92 overtime thriller coincided with a visit from ESPN&#x27;s College GameDay.
*February 13, 2005 – The No. 18-ranked women&#x27;s team lost to No. 4-ranked Duke 60–49 in front of the largest crowd to watch an Atlantic Coast Conference women&#x27;s regular season basketball game (17,243).
*March 20–22, 2005 – Comcast Center (as it was then known) hosted first- and second-round games for the NCAA women&#x27;s basketball tournament. The No. 7-seeded Terps used their home court advantage to defeat 10-seed Wisconsin–Green Bay but lost to No. 2-seeded Ohio State. In the other games, Liberty became only the second 13-seed to advance to the Sweet 16 by upsetting fourth-seeded Penn State and fifth-seeded DePaul.
*February 7, 2006 – Maryland came from behind to beat Virginia, 76–65, to give Gary Williams 349 wins at Maryland, surpassing the record previously set by Charles &quot;Lefty&quot; Driesell.
*January 28, 2007 – The largest crowd in ACC women&#x27;s history, 17,950, watched second ranked North Carolina defeat third-ranked Maryland 84–71, surpassing the record set the previous season.
*February 17, 2007 – Undefeated and No. 1 Duke women&#x27;s team beat #6 Maryland on Senior Day 69–57 on only the second ever sold-out game for women&#x27;s basketball at the Comcast Center.
*January 14, 2008 – The #4 Maryland women&#x27;s team beat #10 Duke 85–70 at home for the first time in ten years. The crowd of 15,531 is the fifth largest in ACC women&#x27;s basketball history.
*February 21, 2009 – Trailing by as many as 16 points, and still down by 9 with less than two minutes to go, unranked Maryland came back to beat #3 North Carolina 88–85 in overtime. Maryland fans rushed the court after the upset victory.
*March 3, 2010 -Led by first team All-American point guard Greivis Vasquez, the Maryland men&#x27;s basketball team defeated #4 Duke 79–72. As a result of the 79–72 victory, the Terps would go on to share the ACC regular season championship with Duke.
*January 25, 2012 – The basketball court was named in honor of Gary Williams, the men&#x27;s basketball coach who retired after the previous season. That night, the men&#x27;s basketball team fell to Duke, 74–61.
*February 16, 2013 – Maryland Men&#x27;s Basketball upsets #2 Duke in a thrilling 83–81 victory. This was the first victory for the Terps against the Blue Devils since 2010 and the first win against a top 3 ranked team since 2009. This also was the first victory against Duke for Mark Turgeon as the head coach for Maryland Basketball.
*March 9, 2014 - Maryland Men&#x27;s Basketball Team took down longtime rival #5 Virginia 75–69 in overtime. This was the last home game for the Terrapins as a member of the ACC. Also it was the last home game with the Terp&#x27;s venue being named the Comcast Center.
*February 24, 2015 - Maryland Men&#x27;s Basketball Team upsets #5 Wisconsin 59–53.
*November 17, 2015 - Maryland Men&#x27;s Basketball Team defeats the Georgetown Hoyas behind a 24-point performance from guard Melo Trimble. This game was considered a renewal of the old-school rivalry between these teams. It was the first time they had played since 1993.
*January 28, 2016 - First matchup featuring two top-ten ranked Men&#x27;s Basketball teams in the history of the Xfinity Center. The #8 Maryland Terrapins defeated the #3 Iowa Hawkeyes 74–68 in front of a crowd of 17, 950 people.
*March 8, 2020 - #9 Maryland Men&#x27;s Basketball Team defeated the #25 Michigan Wolverines 74–66, clinching a share of the 2019-20 Big Ten regular-season championship. It was the first Big Ten title for the men&#x27;s basketball team in school history.
*February 16, 2023 - Maryland Men&#x27;s Basketball Team upsets #3 Purdue 68-54 which was the first top 5 win at home since 2016 for the Terps.

<doc id="1087068" wikidata="Q291339" url="?curid=1087068" title="Battlelore">
<text>Battlelore are a Finnish heavy metal band from Lappeenranta, founded in 1999 by guitarist Jyri Vahvanen and bassist Miika Kokkola. The name derives from the union of the words &#x27;battle&#x27; and &#x27;folklore&#x27;. Many of Battlelore&#x27;s lyrics concern J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s Middle-earth sagas and their stage costumes and live shows are largely inspired by the themes and characters of fantasy literature. The band had many changes of personnel during their twelve years of activity and had a long hiatus after the completion of the tour supporting their latest release &quot;Doombound&quot; in 2011. In January 2016 they announced that they would be performing at Metal Female Voices Fest XIII in October 2016.

== History ==

=== The first demo and Napalm Records (1999–2004) ===

Battlelore&#x27;s first demo &quot;Warrior&#x27;s Tale&quot; was released in late 1999, the same year of the founding of the group, but Battlelore attracted the attention of the Austrian record label Napalm Records only after the publication of the second demo &quot;Dark Fantasy&quot; in late 2000, which featured for the first time long standing members Kaisa Jouhki as female singer, Henri Vahvanen on drums and Maria Honkanen on keyboards. Under request from the label, the band recorded an untitled 3-tracks demo before finally signing the contract.

In the fall of 2001, the band was at Music Bros. Studios to record their debut album with producer Miitri Aaltonen.

Around this time, guitarist Tommi Havo left the band for personal reasons and was replaced by the current lead guitarist Jussi Rautio. The debut album, &quot;...Where the Shadows Lie&quot;, which includes re-recorded songs coming from early demos, was published in 2002 with good success. A video for the song &quot;Journey to Undying Lands&quot; was shot to promote the album. However, Battlelore are best known for their second album &quot;Sword&#x27;s Song&quot;, registered like the first one at Music Bros. Studios with Miitri Aaltonen as producer and released in the spring of 2003, defined by many as their best. The album was successful and led the group to their first European tour.

In 2004, the band released their first DVD, &quot;The Journey&quot;, containing the recording of a concert held at the prestigious Finnish Tavastia Club in Helsinki, a documentary and video clips.

=== Change of formation and &quot;Third Age of the Sun&quot; (2004–2005) ===

In 2004 singer Patrik Mennander left the band, because of lack of time to devote to Battlelore, and his place was taken at first temporarily and then officially by the former frontman of the band Evemaster, Tomi Mykkänen. Mennander&#x27;s last concert was at a show as headliner band at the RingCon (the official festival of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; in Bonn, Germany). Bassist and founding member Miika Kokkola also left the band for personal reasons and was replaced by Timo Honkanen, a former tour roadie.

With this new line-up, the band released in 2005 their third studio album, &quot;Third Age of the Sun&quot;, recorded at Sound Suite Studios, in the spring of 2005 and produced by Terje Refsnes, for the promotion of which the video for &quot;Storm of the Blades&quot; was filmed. Music critics judged &quot;Third Age of the Sun&quot; inferior compared to previous records, partly due to the defection of Mennander and Kokkola. However, the album presents a more varied and ambitious songwriting, mixing folk tunes and a symphonic vein, rendered through the more prominent use of keyboards and the temporary waiver of clean male vocals, which, however, reappeared in the next album.

The album entered in the Finnish charts at number 38.

=== Touring in Europe, more albums, and hiatus (2006–2011) ===

After attending the Wacken Open Air festival of 2006, in the fall Battlelore started recording their fourth album, again with Miitri Aaltonen at Music Bros Studios, which was published in early 2007 with the title &quot;Evernight&quot;, anticipated by the video for the song &quot;House of Heroes&quot;. Many defined &quot;Evernight&quot; the darkest album of the Finnish group, but also their best since &quot;Sword&#x27;s Song&quot;.

In the early days of September, a European tour planned for November with Draconian and Darzamat was announced, but the tour was later canceled.

In January 2007, guitarist Vahvanen temporarily left the band to travel through Asia for six months, and was replaced by Tommy Lintunen, which appears in the video for &quot;House of Heroes&quot;. On his return in June, Vahvanen took back his place as guitarist.

In September, it was announced that the Finnish band would open the November dates of After Forever in Helsinki and Tampere, but the dates were deleted by the promoter and in November Battlelore were also excluded from the European tour with Korpiklaani, scheduled for December. On 20 October 2007 the band was at the Metal Female Voices Fest and the performance was recorded to be part of a live DVD.

In the period from April to May 2008, their fifth album &quot;The Last Alliance&quot; was recorded at Sound Supreme Studios in Hämeenlinna with Dan Swanö as producer. The album was published in September, preceded by the video for the song &quot;Third Immortal&quot;. After a week from release, the album reached position twenty-sixth in the best-selling albums chart in Finland. Battlelore were part of &#x27;The Finnish Fire Tour&#x27; along Korpiklaani, Falchion and Kivimetsän Druidi, but singer Mykkänen had to be replaced by Harri Hyytiäinen, a member of Avathar for personal problems.
The album was also released in a special edition with a DVD, including the recording of the Metal Female Voices Fest 2007 concert

During the summer, the place of drummer was taken temporarily by Enrico Annus, because of Henri Vahvanen&#x27;s other personal commitments.

In July 2009, it was announced that the group had renewed the contract with Napalm Records, ended with &quot;The Last Alliance&quot;, providing label support for the band&#x27;s next album and its promotional tour.

In late September 2009, the band embarked on a brief tour of six dates in England together with Finntroll and in December it was announced that the sixth album was in preparation and Battlelore would have entered the studio around June–July 2010 for the recordings. The publication was intended for October 2010 and then moved to early 2011.

&quot;Doombound&quot; was recorded again at Sound Supreme Studios with Janne Saksa, with Dan Swanö at mixing duties. Stylistically, the album marked a return to the sound of the first records and it was Battlelore&#x27;s first concept album, focusing on the figure of Túrin Turambar.
The album contains eleven songs, including one instrumental and one sung in Finnish language to celebrate Finland and the Finnish epic poem, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. The special edition of the album contains the DVD &quot;10 Years of Battlelore&quot;, with many special features.

On 23 October 2011, the group announced via their website an indefinite break from the music scene, indicating that this is not a final farewell.

=== Reunion show and &quot;The Return of the Shadow&quot; (2016, 2022-present) ===

In January 2016, they announced that they would be performing a reunion concert at Metal Female Voices Fest XIII in October 2016.

On 3 June 2022, they released their seventh studio album titled &quot;The Return of the Shadow&quot;, the band&#x27;s first album in over a decade.

== Style and influences ==

Battlelore mixes female vocals with harsh male growling in &quot;beauty and the beast&quot; duets, backed by heavy guitar riffing and occasional keyboard interludes. The band&#x27;s style takes elements from gothic metal, folk metal, power metal and melodic death metal. Because of the variety of Battlelore&#x27;s music, different reviewers have labeled the band with each of these genres, as well as idiosyncratic terms such as &quot;epic metal&quot; or &quot;fantasy metal&quot;. Guitarist and founder Jyri Vahvanen described the music of Battlelore as &quot;fantasy metal&quot; and &quot;very bombastic, epic and melodic metal&quot;.

According to Battlelore&#x27;s official MySpace website, Bolt Thrower, Emperor, The Gathering, Kyuss, Black Sabbath, Morbid Angel, Katatonia, Anathema, My Dying Bride, Iron Maiden, W.A.S.P., Zakk Wylde, Dissection and Theatre of Tragedy are some of the artists who influenced the music of the band.

Battlelore&#x27;s lyrics are about Middle-earth characters and events described by the British author J. R. R. Tolkien in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; trilogy of books and in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot;. More lyrical inspiration comes from medieval literature and the &quot;Kalevala&quot;. Starting with the album &quot;Evernight&quot;, the band deliberately decided not to use names or places taken from the imaginary of Tolkien, although his works remain the main inspiration for their lyrics.

The same inspiration marks the band&#x27;s distinctive pseudo-medieval stage show, in which each member is dressed up in costumes and fantasy makeup to look like &quot;ferocious warriors&quot;, &quot;dirty thieves&quot; or &quot;beautiful female elves&quot;.

<doc id="1087117" wikidata="Q3243342" url="?curid=1087117" title="Pig in a poke">
<text>A pig in a poke is a thing that is bought without first being inspected, and thus of unknown authenticity or quality. The idiom is attested in 1555:
A &quot;poke&quot; is a sack, so the image is of a concealed item being sold.

Starting in the 19th century, this idiom was explained as a confidence trick where a farmer would substitute a cat for a suckling pig when bringing it to market. When the buyer discovered the deception, he was said to &quot;let the cat out of the bag&quot;, that is, to learn of something unfortunate prematurely, hence the expression &quot;letting the cat out of the bag&quot;, meaning &quot;to reveal that which is secret&quot;. The French idiom &quot;acheter (un) chat en poche&quot; and the Dutch &quot;een kat in de zak kopen&quot; and also the German &quot;die Katze im Sack kaufen&quot; (all: to buy a cat in a bag) refer to an actual scam of this nature, as do many other European equivalents, while the English expression refers to the appearance of the trick. The English idiom &quot;sold a pup&quot; refers to a similar con. Other variations include &quot;buy a fish in water&quot; (Arabic), &quot;buy a cow on another mountain&quot; (Chinese), &quot;buy in a closed box&quot; (Italian) and &quot;buy a cat instead of a hare&quot; (Iberian languages).

In common law, buyers have the right to inspect goods before purchase.

==Etymology==
A &quot;poke&quot; is a sack or bag, from French &quot;poque&quot;, which is also the etymon of &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, and &quot;&quot;. &quot;Poke&quot; is still in regional use. Pigs were formerly brought to market for sale in a cloth bag, a poke.

==Use in popular culture==
In the April 1929 edition of the literary magazine &quot;The London Aphrodite&quot;, a story by Rhys Davies, titled &quot;A Pig in a Poke&quot;, was published, in which a Welsh coal miner takes a woman from London for his wife and regrets it.

In the 1985 film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s European Vacation&quot;, the Griswold family wins the vacation on a game show called &quot;Pig in a Poke&quot;.

<doc id="1087128" wikidata="Q2473371" url="?curid=1087128" title="São Paulo State Symphony Orchestra">
<text>The São Paulo State Symphony Orchestra () is a Brazilian orchestra based in São Paulo. The principal concert venue of OSESP is the Sala São Paulo.

==History==
The orchestra, initially called the &quot;Orquestra Sinfônica Estadual&quot; (State Symphony Orchestra), gave its first concert on 18 July 1953 at the Municipal Theatre of São Paulo, conducted by João de Sousa Lima. The government of the State of São Paulo officially codified the establishment of the orchestra in a decree (Law No. 2733) dated 13 September 1954, signed by Governor Lucas Nogueira Garcez. Sousa Lima served as the orchestra&#x27;s first principal conductor and artistic director. OSESP alternated between periods of success and great difficulty, including a hiatus in its activities. In 1964, the Italian conductor Bruno Roccela became principal conductor. In 1972, Eleazar de Carvalho succeeded Roccela, and served as principal conductor until his death in 1996. In 1978, the orchestra formally took on its current name of the &quot;Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo&quot;.

John Neschling became principal conductor of OSESP in 1997. One condition that Neschling set for signing his contract was the establishment of a permanent home for OSESP. In 1999, the orchestra took up residence in a newly renovated venue located in the spaces of the abandoned Júlio Prestes Station, the Sala São Paulo. In 2005, the OSESP Foundation, a non-profit organization presided by former President of Brazil Fernando Henrique Cardoso, took over operations of OSESP. In January 2009, following reports of conflicts between Neschling and the OSESP governing board and musicians, OSESP rescinded Neschling&#x27;s contract, with immediate effect.

Yan Pascal Tortelier served as principal conductor from 2009 to 2011, and subsequently as principal guest conductor from 2011 to 2013. From January 2010, music scholar and writer Arthur Nestrovski was named Artistic Director, in charge of programming, educational activities, publications and outreach programs. In February 2011, OSESP announced the appointment of Marin Alsop as principal conductor, the first female conductor named to the post, with an initial contract of five years, effective in 2012. In August 2012, under the direction of Alsop, OSESP made its first-ever appearance at the Proms, the first Proms appearance by any Brazilian orchestra. In July 2013, OSESP granted Alsop the title of music director. In April 2015, OSESP extended her contract to the end of 2019. In December 2017, OSESP announced that Alsop is to stand down as its chief conductor in December 2019, and subsequently to take the title of honorary conductor.

In October 2016, Thierry Fischer first guest-conducted OSESP. In June 2019, OSESP announced the appointment of Fischer as its next music director, effective in 2020, with an initial contract through 2024.

The orchestra has made commercial recordings for such labels as Biscoito Fino, BIS, and Naxos. These albums include symphonies of Camargo Guarnieri, Francisco Braga&#x27;s opera &quot;Jupyra&quot;, works by Francisco Mignone and Cláudio Santoro, and Heitor Villa-Lobos&#x27;s complete symphonies, &quot;Bachianas Brasileiras&quot; and &quot;Chôros&quot;. With Alsop, OSESP has recorded commercially music of Prokofiev.

<doc id="1087130" wikidata="Q881051" url="?curid=1087130" title="Alexander William Doniphan">
<text>Alexander William Doniphan (July 9, 1808 – August 8, 1887) was a 19th-century American attorney, soldier and politician from Missouri who is best known today as the man who prevented the summary execution of Joseph Smith, founder of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, at the close of the 1838 Mormon War in that state. He also achieved renown as a leader of American troops during the Mexican–American War, as the author of a legal code that still forms the basis of New Mexico&#x27;s Bill of Rights, and as a successful defense attorney in the Missouri towns of Liberty, Richmond and Independence.

==Early life==
Doniphan was born near the town of Maysville, Kentucky, near the Ohio River. He was the youngest of the ten children of Joseph and Anne Fowke (née Smith) Doniphan, both natives of Virginia. Joseph had been a friend of Daniel Boone, and both of Alexander&#x27;s grandfathers had fought in the American Revolution.

Doniphan graduated from Augusta College in 1824, and was admitted to the bar in 1830. He began his law practice in Lexington, Missouri, but soon moved to Liberty, where he was a successful lawyer. Doniphan always served as a defense attorney, never as a prosecutor, and was noted for his oratorical skills. He served in the state legislature in 1836, 1840, and 1854, representing the Whig Party.

==The Heatherly War==
Doniphan&#x27;s friend and partner, David Rice Atchison, was a member of the Liberty Blues, a volunteer militia company. In June 1836 he persuaded Doniphan to join them. Doniphan took part in the so-called &quot;Heatherly War&quot; as an aide to Colonel Samuel C. Allen. As the Liberty Blues moved toward the Missouri border, Stephen Watts Kearny, then a lieutenant colonel, joined them from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.

Kearny discovered that the Heatherly brothers had sold whiskey to a hunting party of Potawatomi Indians, then stole their horses. The Potawatomis pursued the brothers and killed three of them. The brothers&#x27; mother sought revenge by claiming that the Potawatomis had gone on the war path, while the remaining Heatherly brothers robbed and murdered two white men, trying to place the blame on the Potawatomis. The &quot;war&quot; ended with the Heatherly family being arrested, tried, and convicted.

==The 1838 Mormon War==
Starting in 1831, Jackson County, Missouri, had become home to several members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, a religious organization founded by Joseph Smith in upstate New York a year earlier. By 1833, approximately 1200 Mormons lived in Jackson County, where they aroused the ire of many earlier settlers by their belief that American Indians, whom they called &quot;Lamanites&quot;, were the descendants of ancient Israelites who had migrated to the New World centuries earlier (see Book of Mormon). Other fundamental differences between Mormons and non-Mormons exacerbated the situation, especially a belief that the Mormons were abolitionists, who planned to foment uprisings among Missouri slaves. Denunciations of abolitionism in the church press did nothing to allay their neighbors&#x27; fears, and matters came to a head in late 1833, when the Mormons were forcibly expelled from the county.

Following these events, Joseph Smith and other church leaders petitioned the governor of Missouri for protection, but were largely ignored. This led them to hire Doniphan and Atchison, among others, to defend their rights in court. Doniphan assisted in the creation of a special county in northwestern Missouri for the Mormons, but continued friction between Mormons and non-Mormon settlers in that region ultimately led to the outbreak of the 1838 Mormon War. Following a clash between Mormons and state militia at the Battle of Crooked River, governor Lilburn Boggs issued his infamous &quot;Extermination Order&quot;, directing that the Mormons be &quot;exterminated, or driven from the state&quot;.

As a brigadier general in the Missouri Militia, Doniphan was ordered into the field with other forces to operate against the Mormons, even though he had worked diligently to avoid the conflict, and believed that the Mormons were largely acting in self-defense. After the surrender of Far West, General Samuel Lucas took custody of Joseph Smith and other Mormon leaders, and instituted a drumhead court martial (kangaroo court), which declared Smith and the others guilty of treason, and ordered Doniphan to execute them. Doniphan indignantly refused, saying: &quot;It is cold blooded murder. I will not obey your order. ... [I]f you execute these men, I will hold you responsible before an earthly tribunal, so help me God&quot;. The Mormon leaders were accordingly sent to Liberty Jail during the winter, to await trial during the following spring of 1839, at which trial Doniphan was appointed as their defense attorney and energetically defended them at the risk of his good reputation and, in all probability, his life. Ultimately, the church leaders were permitted to escape from custody, and they subsequently made their way to the new Mormon settlement in Hancock County, Illinois, where Joseph Smith was killed in 1844. In Doniphan&#x27;s honor, Joseph and Emma Hale Smith named a son Alexander Hale Smith.

In 1843, Porter Rockwell, a controversial Mormon figure later known as &quot;the destroying angel of Mormondom&quot;, was arrested in St. Louis and accused of carrying out a failed assassination attempt on (now former) governor Boggs. After nine months of being imprisoned in poor conditions, he was able to hire Doniphan to defend him; Doniphan managed to have the main charge of attempted murder dismissed for lack of evidence, and arranged for Rockwell to serve a five-minute sentence (for a jailbreak attempt during his imprisonment) in the county jail before being released. Rockwell made his way to Illinois, then later to Utah, where he achieved fame as a lawman and Wild West figure.

Forty years after the events of 1838, an aged Doniphan visited Salt Lake City, Utah Territory, which had become the nucleus for the largest body of Mormons following the death of Joseph Smith. He received a hero&#x27;s welcome, and was feted and thanked by the Latter-day Saints for his role in saving the life of their prophet.

==Mexican–American War==
In 1846, at the beginning of the Mexican–American War Doniphan was commissioned as Colonel of the 1st Regiment of Missouri Mounted Volunteers, and served in several campaigns, including General Stephen W. Kearny&#x27;s capture of Santa Fe and an invasion of northern Mexico (present day northern New Mexico).

After Santa Fe was secure, Kearny left Doniphan in charge in New Mexico, and departed towards California on September 25, 1846. Doniphan&#x27;s orders were to wait until General Sterling Price arrived with the Second Missouri Mounted Volunteers, who were coming from Fort Leavenworth, Kansas; after they arrived he was to lead them to Chihuahua via Ciudad Juarez, then known as Paso del Norte. They were to link up with Brigadier General John E. Wool, who was moving southwest from San Antonio, Texas toward Guerrero and Monclova, Coahuila, to attack Monterrey, Nuevo León from the west. Kearny had known that the Navajo people were going on the war path. With the Spanish gone, the Navajos wanted to test these new American soldiers; hence, as Doniphan waited for Price, the Navajos mounted a raid and kidnapped 20 Mexican families.

Doniphan was eager to start south, but he first had to wait for Price to arrive. Kearny, and then Doniphan had tried to negotiate with the Navajos, together with the Ute tribe and Apaches, but had made little progress. After Price arrived with his force, Kearny, near the present-day border of Arizona and New Mexico, learned that the Navajos had attacked some sheepherders, killed them, and stolen their herd of 2,000 sheep. Kearny dispatched a message to Doniphan to attack the Navajos on October 2, 1846. Doniphan signed a peace treaty with the Utes, and then took three companies and headed west (toward present day Gallup) in pursuit of the Navajos.

Doniphan was unable to find his foe, but they sent a member of their tribe to find him and tell him they wanted to negotiate. At first, Kearny was willing to be amicable with the Navajos, but the following day, October 3, the Navajos attacked the village of Polvadera, stealing the livestock and sending the residents fleeing for their lives. Kearny now called for all citizens of the territory to take up arms and aid the cavalry in finding the Navajos, retrieving the stolen property, and to &quot;make reprisals and obtain redress for the many insults they received from them&quot;.
Returning to their campaign against the Mexican Army, Doniphan&#x27;s men won the Battle of El Brazito (outside modern day El Paso, Texas) and then won the Battle of the Sacramento River, enabling the capture of the city of Chihuahua. At the latter battle, Doniphan and his force were outnumbered by more than four to one in troops, and nearly two to one in artillery, but only lost one dead and eleven wounded to the Mexican loss of 320 dead, 560 wounded and 72 prisoners.

Doniphan&#x27;s men ultimately embarked on ships and returned to Missouri via New Orleans to a hero&#x27;s welcome. His campaign had taken him and his men on a march of nearly , considered the longest military campaign since the times of Alexander the Great.

==Return to civilian life==
After the Mexican–American War, Doniphan was appointed by General Kearny to write a code of civil laws (known as the &quot;Kearny code&quot;) in both English and Spanish. It was to be used in the lands annexed from Mexico, and still forms the basis of New Mexico&#x27;s Bill of Rights and legal code. He was also instrumental in the establishment of William Jewell College in his home town of Liberty; one of his colleagues on the college&#x27;s board of trustees was Rev. Robert James, father of Frank and Jesse James. Doniphan also served as the first Clay County superintendent of schools.

Doniphan was a moderate in the events leading up to the American Civil War, opposing secession and favoring neutrality for Missouri. Although a slaveholder, Doniphan advocated the gradual elimination of slavery. This was in response to proposals of the Republican Party to make emancipation immediate, without compensation to the slaveowners or any preparation of the slaves for life as free men.

Doniphan attended a peace conference at Washington, D.C., in February 1861, but returned home frustrated at its inability to solve the crisis. He was appointed Brigadier General and commander of the Fifth Division of the Missouri State Guard, but declined. Doniphan was also offered high rank in the Union Army, but refused to fight against the South. In 1863 he moved to St. Louis and remained there for the rest of the war. During a meeting with Doniphan, President Abraham Lincoln is alleged to have remarked: &quot;Doniphan, you are the only man I&#x27;ve ever met whose appearance came up to my expectations&quot;. During the war, Doniphan worked in St. Louis with the Missouri Claims Commission, handling pension applications.

In the late 1860s, Doniphan re-opened his law office in Richmond, Missouri, where he died at the age of 79. He is buried in Fairview Cemetery in Liberty under an obelisk.

==Family==
Doniphan married Elizabeth Jane Thornton (December 21, 1820–July 19, 1873) on December 21, 1837, in Liberty, Missouri. Her father was a colleague of Doniphan&#x27;s in the state legislature. Their wedding was on her 17th birthday, and it was a double-wedding ceremony, with Elizabeth&#x27;s sister Caroline and Oliver P. Moss being married at the same time. Elizabeth became sickly in the 1850s, and during the burial of her son John she suffered a stroke, which left her a semi-invalid for the remainder of her life. 
Elizabeth Doniphan died in New York City of pulmonary hemorrhage.

The couple had two sons, John Thornton (September 18, 1838–May 9, 1853) and Alexander William Jr. (September 10, 1840–May 11, 1858), neither of whom lived to age 18. John Thornton Doniphan died from accidental poisoning: while visiting his uncle James Baldwin, he sought relief for a toothache in the middle of the night but mistakenly took corrosive sublimate (mercury chloride), thinking that it was Epsom salts. Alexander William Doniphan Jr. died while attending Bethany College, in Bethany, West Virginia, when he drowned in a flood-swollen river.

<text>Carey McWilliams is an American author, outdoorsman and firearms safety consultant. He gained prominence in 2001, when he became the first blind person to acquire a concealed weapons permit to allow him to carry a firearm for self-defense.

==Life==

McWilliams was born the son of Janice McWilliams. His blindness, caused by a late-blooming birth defect that failed to appear at birth, occurred at age ten. Despite complete blindness, at age 14, McWilliams joined the Civil Air Patrol, where he had the opportunity to co-pilot many small aircraft. It was through the cadet program that he learned to disassemble, clean, reassemble and fire his first gun, the M16.
After passing a pistol marksmanship course through the Army ROTC with a GPA of 4.0 at 18. At 27 he passed all shooting and written exams to receive his first concealed weapons permit from North Dakota in September 2000. In 2005, he became a figure in the National Gun Debate when he publicly opposed a move by his home state&#x27;s legislature to remove the shooting portion of the CCW permit, stating that such allowed the carrying of loaded firearms by individuals who may have no knowledge of safe gun operation. Despite opposition from many sides of the gun issue, he has pursued other state&#x27;s carry permits, obtaining CCW permits from Arizona, Florida, Utah and Virginia. In 2018, he passed all enhanced written and live-fire requirements to be issued a North Dakota enhanced class 1 concealed weapons permit, allowing him to carry a loaded firearm in 40 states with reciprocity.

In 2021, McWilliams obtained a permit to carry a loaded handgun from the state of Minnesota after two previous attempts in 2006 and again in 2016.

McWilliams married singer and minister Victoria Rice from Moorhead, Minnesota in 2004 in Germany. Rice has cerebral palsy.

<doc id="1087141" wikidata="Q157541" url="?curid=1087141" title="Sunflowers (Van Gogh series)">
<text>Sunflowers (original title, in French: Tournesols) is the title of two series of still life paintings by the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. The first series, executed in Paris in 1887, depicts the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set, made a year later in Arles, shows a bouquet of sunflowers in a vase. In the artist&#x27;s mind, both sets were linked by the name of his friend Paul Gauguin, who acquired two of the Paris versions. About eight months later, van Gogh hoped to welcome and impress Gauguin again with &quot;Sunflowers&quot;, now part of the painted &quot;Décoration for the Yellow House&quot; that he prepared for the guestroom of his home in Arles, where Gauguin was supposed to stay. 

== The Paris &quot;Sunflowers&quot; ==

Little is known of van Gogh&#x27;s activities during the two years he lived with his brother, Theo, in Paris, 1886–1888. The fact that he had painted &quot;Sunflowers&quot; already is only revealed in the spring of 1889, when Gauguin claimed one of the Arles versions in exchange for studies he had left behind after leaving Arles for Paris. Van Gogh was upset and replied that Gauguin had absolutely no right to make this request: &quot;I am definitely keeping my sunflowers in question. He has two of them already, let that hold him. And if he is not satisfied with the exchange he has made with me, he can take back his little Martinique canvas, and his self-portrait sent to me from Brittany, at the same time giving me back both my portrait and the two sunflower canvases which he has taken to Paris. So if he ever broaches this subject again, I&#x27;ve told you just how matters stand.&quot;
The two &quot;Sunflowers&quot; in question show two buttons each; one of them was preceded by a small study, and a fourth large canvas combines both compositions.

These were van Gogh&#x27;s first paintings with &quot;nothing but sunflowers&quot;—yet, he had already included sunflowers in still life and landscape earlier.

== The Arles &quot;Sunflowers&quot; ==
In a letter to Theo dating from 21 or 22 August 1888, van Gogh wrote: &quot;I&#x27;m painting with the gusto of a Marseillais eating bouillabaisse, which won’t surprise you when it&#x27;s a question of painting large sunflowers.&quot; At the time, he was working on three paintings simultaneously and intended to do more, as he explained to his brother: &quot;in the hope of living in a studio of our own with Gauguin, I&#x27;d like to do a decoration for the studio. Nothing but large sunflowers&quot;.

Leaving aside the first two versions, all Arlesian &quot;Sunflowers&quot; are painted on size 30 canvases.

=== The initial versions, August 1888 ===
The versions of the paintings provided by van Gogh in his announcement of his sunflower series do not precisely match every detail supplied by him. The first version differs in size, is painted on a size 20 canvas—not on a size 15 canvas as indicated—and all the others differ in the number of flowers depicted from van Gogh&#x27;s announcement. The second was evidently enlarged and the initial composition altered by insertion of the two flowers lying in the foreground, center and right. Neither the third nor the fourth shows the dozen or 14 flowers indicated by the artist, but more—fifteen or sixteen.
These alterations are executed &quot;wet-in-wet&quot; and therefore considered genuine rework—even the more so as they are copied to the &quot;repetitions&quot; of January 1889; there is no longer a trace of later alterations, at least in this aspect.

The fourth version of the painting was attacked on October 14, 2022 by environmental activists from the Just Stop Oil campaign, who threw tomato soup at it, while it was on display at National Gallery in London, before gluing their hands to the wall. The painting was covered with plexiglass, and it was unharmed with the exception of minor damage to the frame. The two activists were arrested and the painting was put back on display later that day. The two activists were found guilty of criminal damage in July 2024, and sentenced in September to 20 and 24 months in prison, respectively.

=== The &quot;Repetitions&quot;, January 1889 ===
Both &quot;repetitions&quot; of the 4th version are no longer in their original state. In the Amsterdam version, a strip of wood was added at the top—probably by van Gogh himself. The Tokyo version, however, was enlarged on all sides with strips of canvas, which were added at a later time—presumably by the first owner, Émile Schuffenecker. The series is perhaps van Gogh&#x27;s best known and most widely reproduced. In the 2000s, debate arose regarding the authenticity of one of the paintings, and it has been suggested that this version may have been the work of Émile Schuffenecker or of Paul Gauguin. Most experts, however, conclude that the work is genuine.

=== The &quot;Berceuse&quot;-Triptych ===
In January 1889, when Vincent had just finished the first repetitions of the &quot;Berceuse&quot; and the &quot;Sunflowers&quot; pendants, he told Theo: &quot;I picture to myself these same canvases between those of the sunflowers, which would thus form torches or candelabra beside them, the same size, and so the whole would be composed of seven or nine canvases.&quot;

A definite hint for the arrangement of the triptych is supplied by van Gogh&#x27;s sketch in a letter of July 1889.

Later that year, Vincent selected both versions for his display at Les XX, 1890.

The triptych was displayed as Vincent intended at the National Gallery in London in 2024, with the London and Philadelphia versions flanking the Boston Berceuse. The two Sunflowers paintings were again attacked by Just Stop Oil protestors.

== Sunflowers, friendship and gratitude ==

Van Gogh began painting in late summer of 1888 and continued into the following year. One went to decorate his friend Paul Gauguin&#x27;s bedroom. The paintings show sunflowers in all stages of life, from full bloom to withering. The paintings were considered innovative for their use of the yellow spectrum, partly because newly invented pigments made new colors possible.

In a letter to Theo, Vincent wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a type of painting that changes its aspect a little, which grows in richness the more you look at it. Besides, you know that Gauguin likes them extraordinarily. He said to me about them, among other things:
‘that — ... that&#x27;s... the flower’. You know that Jeannin has the peony, Quost has the hollyhock, but I have the sunflower, in a way.&quot;

== Subsequent history ==

On March 30, 1987, Japanese insurance magnate Yasuo Goto paid the equivalent of US$39,921,750 for van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Still Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers&quot; at auction at Christie&#x27;s London, at the time a record-setting amount for a work of art. The price was over three times the previous record of about $12million paid for Andrea Mantegna&#x27;s &quot;Adoration of the Magi&quot; in 1985. The record was broken a few months later with the purchase of another van Gogh, &quot;Irises&quot;, by Alan Bond for $53.9million at Sotheby&#x27;s, New York on November 11, 1987.

While it is uncertain whether Yasuo Goto bought the painting himself or on behalf of his company, the Yasuda Fire and Marine Insurance Company of Japan, the painting currently resides at Seiji Togo Yasuda Memorial Museum of Modern Art in Tokyo. After the purchase, a controversy arose whether this is a genuine van Gogh or an Émile Schuffenecker forgery.

=== Provenances ===
Two Paris versions van Gogh exchanged with Gauguin in December 1887 or January 1888, were both sold to Ambroise Vollard: one in January 1895 and the other in April 1896. The first canvas resided for a short time with Félix Roux, but was reacquired by Vollard and sold to Degas, then from his estate to Rosenberg, then to Hahnloser and bequested to the Kunstmuseum Bern. The second was acquired by the Dutch collector Hoogendijk at the sale of his collection by Kann, who ceded the painting to Richard Bühler and then via Thannhauser to the Metropolitan Museum in New York.

Two of van Gogh&#x27;s &quot;Sunflowers&quot; paintings never left the artist&#x27;s estate: the study for one of the Paris versions (F377) and the repetition of fourth version (F458). Both are in the possession of the Vincent van Gogh Foundation, established 1962 by Vincent Willem van Gogh, the artist&#x27;s nephew, and on permanent loan to the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam.

Five other versions are recorded in the van Gogh estate papers:
*the final Paris version (F.452) in the artist&#x27;s estate was sold 1909 via C. M. van Gogh, The Hague (J. H. de Bois) to Kröller-Müller
*(F457) sold 1894 to Émile Schuffenecker. (Tokyo version).
*(F456) sold 1905 via Paul Cassirer to Hugo von Tschudi. (Munich version).
*(F459) sold 1908 C. M. van Gogh (J. H. de Bois), The Hague to Fritz Meyer-Fierz, Zürich (destroyed by U.S. air raid in Japan on 6 August 1945).
*(F454) sold 1924 via Ernest Brown &amp; Phillips (The Leicester Galleries) to the Tate Gallery; since on permanent loan to the National Gallery, London. (London version).

Two Arles versions left the artist&#x27;s estate unrecorded:
*(F453) (private collection). Sold 1891 to Octave Mirbeau, Paris, (via Tanguy, Paris) for £12 (about £1,300 in 2013 £). Sold 1996 to a private collector for an undisclosed sum.
*(F455) (Philadelphia version).

<text>Margaret Louisa Woods (née Bradley; 20 November 1855 – 1 December 1945) was an English writer, known for novels and for her lyrical and socially conscious poetry.

==Life==
She was born in Rugby, the daughter of the scholar George Granville Bradley, an academic and senior priest, who served as Dean of Westminster from 1881 to 1902. Her sister was the writer Mabel Birchenough. In 1879 she married Henry George Woods, who became President of Trinity College, Oxford, and Master of the Temple. They built Thessaly Cottage, on the ridge of Boars Hill above Oxford, one of the first brick houses to be established there, and stayed there until 1893. There were three sons. Margaret died at her home, Vine Cottage, in Thursley, Surrey. Her ashes are interred with her husband, at Holywell Cemetery, Oxford.

==Novels==
&quot;Esther Vanhomrigh&quot;, is a historical romance inspired by the life of the Irish poet Esther Vanhomrigh, the lover and correspondent of Jonathan Swift. &quot;The Vagabonds&quot; is an exploration of male perceptions of women. There are three novels set in Spain at the time of the Peninsular War (&quot;Sons of the Sword, The King&#x27;s Revoke, The Spanish Lady&quot;). &quot;A Poet&#x27;s Youth&quot; is a portrayal of William Wordsworth. Her most unusual novel, &quot;The Invader&quot;, is a fantasy about a young female scholar (one of the earliest women students accepted by Oxford University), who is possessed by the spirit of a similar fore-bearer.

<doc id="1087149" wikidata="Q7946781" url="?curid=1087149" title="WATC-DT">
<text>WATC-DT (channel 57) is a religious independent television station in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. Owned by Carolina Christian Broadcasting, the station maintains studios on Enterprise Drive in Norcross, and its transmitter is located on Sweat Mountain in northeastern Cobb County, near the Cherokee County line.

WATC broadcasts programming from various Christian organizations and local and national churches over its two main channels, including World Harvest Television, The Inspiration Network, The Worship Network, Golden Eagle and The Shepherd&#x27;s Chapel. Its third subchannel carries The Loop, a network made up of classic sitcoms, dramas, Westerns and films, all in the public domain.

==History==
WATC launched on September 10, 1996.

WATC granted permission to simulcast its signal on WSKC-CA (channel 22, also licensed to Atlanta), so that station could maintain its Class A status. WSKC-CA was located on the same broadcast tower as WATC, and could continue broadcasting in analog even after WATC went digital-only in February 2009. However, it was off-air as of March 2009, and remained so for most of the year. Since then, the station has moved to transmit digitally from a location near Norcross as WSKC-CD, and now airs Korean programming as it had previously done on analog before its affiliation with WATC.

Despite the DTV Delay Act extending the deadline from February 17 to June 12, the station ended shut down its analog signal on February 17, 2009, the original target date on which full-power television stations in the United States were to transition from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate (which was later pushed back to June 12, 2009). The station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 41. On June 18, it changed its broadcast callsign from WATC a few days after the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) announced that TV stations were free to add or drop &quot;-DT&quot; as easily as &quot;-TV&quot;. WATC received a construction permit for a fill-in broadcast translator in Union City, Georgia (southwestern metro Atlanta) on channel 36, which was vacated by analog WATL. It will have the same callsign as its parent station (with no extra numerals or other differentiation, despite not being a same-channel booster) and could not be sold separately, as it is within a program the FCC created in 2009 in order to address the shortcomings of the ATSC digital broadcast television system. Since ATSC is very prone to multipath interference, this may be due to reflected signals from the skyscrapers of downtown Atlanta and midtown Atlanta, as well as terrain shielding of the Chattahoochee River valley and the hills around it. 

The station formerly had a translator station, W42AO, licensed to Athens, Georgia. That station became WAGC-LD. Owner Carolina Christian Broadcasting, Inc. also owns WGGS-TV, its sister station in Greenville, South Carolina.

In early May 2011, the station added other religious programming called &quot;WATC Too&quot; on new channel 57.2.

<doc id="1087159" wikidata="Q7532148" url="?curid=1087159" title="Situation analysis">
<text>In strategic management, situation analysis (or situational analysis) refers to a collection of methods that managers use to analyze an organization&#x27;s internal and external environment to understand the organization&#x27;s capabilities, customers, and business environment. The situation analysis can include several methods of analysis such as the 5C analysis, SWOT analysis and Porter&#x27;s five forces analysis.

== In marketing ==

In marketing, a marketing plan is created to guide businesses on how to communicate the benefits of their products to the needs of potential customer. The situation analysis is the second step in the marketing plan and is a critical step in establishing a long term relationship with customers.

The parts of a marketing plan are:
* Introduction
* Situation analysis
* Objectives
* Budgeting
* Strategy
* Execution
* Evaluation

The situation analysis looks at both the macro-environmental factors that affect many firms within the environment and the micro-environmental factors that specifically affect the firm. The purpose of the situation analysis is to indicate to a company about the organizational and product position, as well as the overall survival of the business, within the environment. Companies must be able to summarize opportunities and problems within the environment so they can understand their capabilities within the market.

== 5C analysis ==
While a situation analysis is often referred to as the &quot;3C analysis&quot;, the extension to the 5C analysis has allowed businesses to gain more information on internal and external factors to aid in strategic decision-making. The 5C analysis is considered the most useful and common way to analyze the market environment, because of the extensive information it provides.

=== Company ===
The company analysis involves evaluation of the company&#x27;s objectives, strategy, and capabilities. These indicate to an organization the strength of the business model, whether there are areas for improvement, and how well an organization fits the external environment.
* Goals and objectives: An analysis on the mission of the business, the industry of the business and the stated goals required to achieve the mission.
* Position: An analysis on the marketing strategy and the marketing mix.
* Performance: An analysis on how effective the business is achieving their stated mission and goals.
* Product line: An analysis on the products manufactured by the business and how successful it is in the market.

=== Competitors ===
The competitor analysis takes into consideration the competitors position within the industry and the potential threat it may pose to other businesses. The main purpose of the competitor analysis is for businesses to analyze a competitor&#x27;s current and potential nature and capabilities so they can prepare against competition. The competitor analysis looks at the following criteria: 
*Identify competitors: Businesses must be able to identify competitors within their industry. Identifying whether competitors provide the same services or products to the same customer base is useful in gaining knowledge of direct competitors. Both direct and indirect competitors must be identified, as well as potential future competitors.
*Assessment of competitors: The competitor analysis looks at competitor goals, mission, strategies and resources. This supports a thorough comparison of goals and strategies of competitors and the organization.
*Predict future initiatives of competitors: An early insight into the potential activity of a competitor helps a company prepare against competition.

=== Customers ===
Customer analysis can be vast and complicated. Some of the important areas that a company analyzes includes:
*Demographics
**Advertising that is most suitable for the demographic
**Market size and potential growth
**Customer wants and needs
**Motivation to buy the product
**Distribution channels (retail, online, wholesale, etc...)
**Quantity and frequency of purchase
**Income level of customer

=== Collaborators ===
Collaborators are useful for businesses as they allow for an increase in the creation of ideas, as well as an increase in the likelihood of gaining more business opportunities. The following type of collaborators are:
*Agencies: Agencies are the middlemen of the business world. When businesses need a specific worker who specializes in the trade, they go to a recruitment agency.
*Suppliers: Suppliers provide raw materials that are required to build products. Different types of Suppliers include manufacturers, wholesalers, merchants, franchisors, importers and exporters, independent crafts people and drop shippers. Each category of suppliers can bring a different skill and experience to the company.
*Distributors: Distributors are important as they are the holding areas for inventory. Distributors can help manage manufacturer relationships as well as handle vendor relationships.
*Partnerships: Business partners would share assets and liabilities, allowing for a new source of capital and skills.

Businesses must be able to identify whether the collaborator has the capabilities needed to help run the business as well as an analysis on the level of commitment needed for a collaborator-business relationship.

=== Climate ===
To fully understand the business climate and environment, many factors that can affect the business must be researched and understood. An analysis on the climate is also known as PEST analysis. The types of climate/environment firms have to analyse are:
* Political and regulatory environment: An analysis of how actively the government regulates the market with their policies and how it would affect the production, distribution and sale of the goods and services.
* Economic Environment: An analysis of trends regarding macroeconomics, such as exchange rates and inflation rate, can prove to influence businesses.
* Social/cultural environment: An analysis interpreting the trends of society, which includes the study of demographics, education, culture etc.
* Technological analysis: An analysis of technology helps improve on old routines and suggest new methods for being cost efficient. To stay competitive and gain an advantage over competitors, businesses must sufficiently understand technological advances.

== SWOT ==

A SWOT analysis is another method of situation analysis that examines the &quot;strengths&quot; and &quot;weaknesses&quot; of a company (internal environment) as well as the &quot;opportunities&quot; and &quot;threats&quot; within the market (external environment). A SWOT analysis looks at both current and future situations. The goal is to build on strengths as much as possible while reducing weaknesses. This analysis helps a company come up with a plan that keeps it prepared for a number of potential scenarios, as part of corporate planning or strategic planning

== Porter&#x27;s five forces industry analysis ==
Porter&#x27;s model involves scanning the environment for threats from competitors and identifying problems early on to minimize threats imposed by competitors. This model can apply for any type of business, from small to larger sized businesses. Porter&#x27;s model is not just for businesses, but can also be applied to a country to help gain insight into creating a competitive advantage in the global market. The ultimate purpose of Porter&#x27;s five forces model is to help businesses compare and analyze their profitability and position with the industry against indirect and direct competition.

<text>Questions and Answers is a topical debate television programme broadcast in Ireland for 23 years between 1986 and 2009.

Similar in format to the BBC television programme &quot;Question Time&quot;, it originally aired on Sunday nights but later moved to Monday nights when it was usually shown at 10.30 pm. The first two series were presented by Olivia O&#x27;Leary; however, John Bowman took over as chairperson for all subsequent series.

Broadcast on RTÉ One, the show typically featured politicians from large political parties as well as public figures who answered questions put to them by the audience. The final edition aired on 29 June 2009. Director-General of RTÉ Cathal Goan described the programme as an &quot;integral part of the national conversation for over 20 years&quot;. It was replaced by &quot;The Frontline&quot;, a series hosted by Pat Kenny.

==Format==
The programme, was launched in the late 1980s. Each week the chairperson initiates a discussion between several prominent politicians and commentators. The discussion is led by questions asked by members of the audience. The first question will usually deal with the major political issue of the week. The final question is often a trivial or comic question.

&quot;Questions and Answers&quot; was usually broadcast from the RTÉ television complex in Donnybrook, Dublin with only occasional broadcasts from around Ireland.

It was broadcast at 22:30, although one edition which was broadcast at 21:30 drew comment from Declan Lynch in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; who wondered if it was &quot;a gesture to the poor ould fellas who might have some chance of staying awake past the first question&quot;.

For its first decade the programme was taped for broadcast from approximately 19:00 on the night of transmission. From the late 1990s, however, the programme was broadcast live, with phoned-in or emailed-in comments from viewers read out on air.

==Presenters==
* Olivia O&#x27;Leary (1986–88)
* John Bowman (1988–2009)
* Vincent Browne (Guest Presenter)

==History==

===Lenihan Tape Affair: 1990===
The programme has occasionally set the national news agenda. During a broadcast in 1990 the then Tánaiste and expected next President of Ireland, Brian Lenihan, badly damaged his chances of being elected. He denied involvement in an effort eight years earlier in January 1982 to pressurise the then President to refuse a parliamentary dissolution – contradicting previous statement he had made.

Lenihan had actually confirmed his involvement in the effort some months earlier in an &quot;on-the-record&quot; interview with a journalist Jim Duffy, as he had to numerous political colleagues privately over eight years. During the presidential election campaign he changed his story, first in an Irish Press interview, and then on &quot;Questions and Answers&quot;. Some journalists had been told by Lenihan previously of his role in pressurising Hillery, but had been told it in an &#x27;off the record&#x27; conversation and so could not reveal it (though one did hint it in an unsigned editorial in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot; during the crisis following the programme).

However following the programme, Duffy, in a backlash to pressure from Lenihan&#x27;s Fianna Fáil not to reveal the information, did reveal that Lenihan&#x27;s account on the programme conflicted with his pre-campaign version. The minor party in Charles Haughey&#x27;s government, the Progressive Democrats, threatened to quit government and cause a general election unless either Lenihan was sacked from cabinet or an inquiry was ordered into the events of January 1982. When Lenihan refused to resign, Haughey, instead of ordering an inquiry into who had made the calls in 1982, sacked him.

The &quot;ill-fated appearance&quot; was remembered in the final episode of &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; in 2009.

===Doherty on McCabe death: 1996===
Sinn Féin&#x27;s Pat Doherty also used the show in 1996 to deny the involvement of the Provisional IRA in the death of Jerry McCabe. Members of that group were later convicted of manslaughter and Sinn Féin have campaigned for their early release in conjunction with the Belfast Agreement.

Doherty&#x27;s refusal to condemn the murder was remembered in the final episode of &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; in 2009.

===McLaughlin and Michael McDowell on Jean McConville killing: 2005===
In 2005, Sinn Féin chairman Mitchel McLaughlin told viewers that though it had been wrong for the Provisional IRA to kill Jean McConville, a widowed mother of ten young children kidnapped, shot and secretly buried, the action was not a &quot;crime&quot;. In the aftermath of his comments, he was subjected to extreme criticism from within the Irish government, from all the main parties in Dáil Éireann, the media and by the public on radio shows.

Labour Party leader Pat Rabbitte, in a press release immediately afterwards commented that &quot;Any civilised society must consider the abduction and murder of a mother of 10 children to be a crime of considerable barbarism&quot; while Mrs McConville&#x27;s son Michael said that McLaughlin, along with Sinn Féin TD Arthur Morgan, who had made similar comments elsewhere, &quot;should be holding their heads in shame&quot;.

McLaughlin&#x27;s refusal to call the murder a crime was remembered in the final episode of &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; in 2009.

===Michael O&#x27;Brien vs. Noel Dempsey: 2009===
In one of the last episodes, former mayor of Clonmel and Fianna Fáil member, Michael O&#x27;Brien confronted Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey about the way the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse had treated survivors of the industrial schools, pointing out that the allegedly non-adversarial process had involved him being accused of lying. He said the government should change the constitution so that the assets of the religious orders who ran the industrial schools could be frozen. He also spoke of how he still suffered nightmares about the abuse he suffered in Ferryhouse and how his experience of the questioning had led him to contemplate suicide but his wife had persuaded him not to do it. He ended his remarks by saying &quot;You know me minister&quot; to Noel Dempsey to which Dempsey nodded in silence. Presenter John Bowman in the final show just weeks later said that interruption was &quot;by far the most memorable moment&quot; in the history of &quot;Questions and Answers&quot;.

==Final episode==
The final episode was broadcast on 29 June 2009. It featured an interview with Taoiseach Brian Cowen plus three separate panels filled with senior politicians. The first panel featured Minister for Health Mary Harney, Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, Labour spokesman on justice Pat Rabbitte, tax lawyer Suzanne Kelly, and Senator David Norris. The second panel featured &quot;The Irish Times&quot; columnist and writer John Waters, former Progressive Democrats minister Liz O&#x27;Donnell, Fergus Finlay, former chef-de-cabinet of the Irish Labour Party and current chief executive of Barnardos, solicitor Catherine Ghent, and vice-president of Sinn Féin Mary Lou McDonald. The third panel featured Noel Whelan, barrister with political background, Eddie Hobbs financial advisor with political future, Green party leader and Minister for the Environment John Gormley, MEP Mairéad McGuinness, editor of the &quot;Irish Daily Star&quot; Ger Colleran.

John Boland, writing in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, described the final episode as &quot;genuinely engrossing&quot;, saying that &quot;reminiscence rather than recrimination won through&quot;. He described the overall programme as a &quot;weird combination of the unmissable and the frequently unwatchable&quot;.

===Demise===
The final &quot;Questions and Answers&quot; aired on 29 June 2009. The decision was taken when the presenter, John Bowman stepped aside. It would be replaced by a similar programme, &quot;The Frontline&quot; said to involve public participation and to run in the same time slot on a Monday night. Some politicians were said to have welcomed the show&#x27;s demise, saying it was &quot;well past its sell-by date&quot;. One government Minister told the &quot;Evening Herald&quot; newspaper: &quot;Government and opposition parties were finding it more and more difficult to get people to go on a show that was late at night and at the start of the week to debate topics which had been trashed to death on every other show over the weekend.&quot; &quot;Prime Time&quot; presenter Miriam O&#x27;Callaghan was speculated upon as a replacement but insisted she knew nothing of the show&#x27;s departure until she read about it on the RTÉ website.

<text>&#x27; (Old Norse and Old English) or &#x27; (Old English) are religious ceremonies in Germanic paganism that centred on the killing and offering of an animal to a particular being, typically followed by the communal cooking and eating of its meat. Old Norse sources present it as a central ritual in Old Nordic religion that was intimately connected with many wider aspects of life.
Large are often described as taking place in halls, organised by the rulers of the region who were expected to carry out the practice on behalf of the people. were central to the legitimacy of rulers and Christian rulers refusing to hold them were at times replaced by more willing alternatives and driven out of the land. Smaller, household were sometimes recorded as being led by women. Beyond strengthening legitimacy for the ruling elites, the performance of was often in order to ensure the fertility of the land, a good harvest and peace, although they are also recorded as being performed for divination or to achieve desired results in legal matters.

After the establishment of Christianity, were routinely made punishable offences, as seen in early Germanic legal codes, with the recipients of the worship and sacrifice often equated with demons. Despite this, some aspects of the practice were likely incorporated into local Christian culture and continued into the modern period. The conscious performing of has also been revived in the modern period as part of the practice of modern heathens.

==Etymology and meaning==
===Etymology===
The verb form is seen in (&quot;to worship; to sacrifice&quot;), (&quot;to serve (God); to worship&quot;; to honour (through sacrifice)&quot;), (&quot;to sacrifice&quot;) and . The Proto-Germanic form of the verb can be reconstructed as the strong verb , or meaning &quot;to sacrifice&quot;. 

The noun form is seen in and (&quot;sacrifice&quot;), and (&quot;sacrifice; worship&quot;). A Proto-Germanic form of the noun can be similarly reconstructed as . A similar and related form can be reconstructed as from (&quot;sacrifice&quot;) and , a component of (&quot;worshipper of God&quot;). can also be used to mean &quot;idol-worship&quot; in general, an &quot;idol&quot; (often in the form ) or metaphorically to mean &quot;cursing&quot; or &quot;swearing&quot; in Christian times due to the negative view of heathenry.

The shared Germanic root has been proposed to be related to (&quot;to blow; to bloom; to blossom&quot;), which is further connected to (&quot;blood&quot;). A connection has been further proposed to (&quot;priest&quot;), although it has been argued that the validity of this is dependent on the exact root of which cannot be determined with certainty.

===Usage===
In the context of &quot;to worship&quot; or &quot;to worship with sacrifice&quot;, the Old Norse verb is typically used with that being worshipped in the accusative case, and rarely with it in the dative case. The dative case is more typically used for the object being sacrificed. The verb is often followed by the aim of the , for example (&quot;for peace, victory, long life, good season, fair wind&quot;).

===In compounds===
 is found in many compound words relating to worship or sacrifice. These include adjectives such as (&quot;rich in sacrifices&quot;) and terms for individuals also include it is a prefix such as , , or (&quot;heathen priest&quot;), (&quot;heathen chief&quot;). Other compounds include recipients of worship such as (&quot;heathen god&quot;) and (&quot;calf worshipped with sacrifices&quot;). Items with religious function can also include it as a prefix such as (&quot;sacrificial bowl&quot;) and (&quot;garments worn at sacrifices&quot;), and it can refer to religious concepts such as or (&quot;idolatry&quot;), and which is used to mean both &quot;sacrificing to heathen gods&quot; and &quot;idolatry&quot;.

==Components of the practice==
===Location===

It has been proposed that during the Migration Period, religious organisation drastically changed, with rulers gaining enough power to centralise sacrifices and ceremonies to their own homes rather than in outdoor spaces such as bogs and lakes, as had been done before. These indoor cultic buildings are referred to in Old Norse soures variously as , , , .

Sources do still record Viking Age taking place a diverse range of sites, with groves, hofs and waterfalls being described as the recipients of , along with beings such as gods, elves and heathen vættir. Some nouns for places include as a prefix, suggesting them as sites where these ceremonies took place, such as (&quot;sacrificial mound or cairn&quot;) and (&quot;heathen house of worship&quot;). Kjalnesinga saga describes how there was a site near a large hof called (&quot;sacrificial fen/bog/well/spring&quot; or &quot;fen near the heathen temple&quot;) into which sacrifices were thrown during sacrifical feasts. This idea is also reflected in Icelandic placenames such as at Möðrudalur and (&quot;fen/spring of the gods&quot;) at Mývatn.

===Killing of humans and other animals===
The written sources and the archaeological record indicate that in Old Norse religious practice, the sacrifice of animals, particularly pigs and horses, played a significant part in the . Closer in conception to a gift, it usually involved killing animals, and sometimes humans, in ritual fashion.

Adam of Bremen&#x27;s account of the temple at Uppsala notes that only the heads were offered. This practice is possibly supported by the archaeological record. At the temple-hall of Hofstaðir in northern Iceland, oxen were decapitated in seasonal rituals for many years and the heads displayed at the hall. Osteological analysis of the bones shows that the animals were killed with blows to the neck by axe or sword. This method was perhaps intended to produce the spectacle of a shower of arterial blood. Similar observations have been made at other sites such as the Viking Age birch stump found underneath the church at Frösön (&quot;Freyr&#x27;s island&quot;) in Jämtland, and a site of a possible cult-house in Borg in Östergötland. Both of these sites had a significant enrichment of skulls relative to other bones. It has been proposed that there was a widespread practice to offer the heads to the gods, whilst cooking the meat for the feast that followed. It has also been suggested that the number of skulls that a hall displayed would act as a status signal, indicating the size of the feast that could be hosted within.

The written sources speak of sacrifices made of prisoners of war; Roman descriptions of Germanic tribes sacrificing their defeated enemies to Mars or Mercury have a similarity with customs related to the cult of Óðinn in Old Norse religion. The Icelandic skáld Helgi Trausti mentions his killing an enemy as a sacrifice to Óðinn; &quot;Egils saga einhenda ok Ásmundar berserkjabana&quot; and &quot;Orkneyinga saga&quot; describe the sacrificing of captive enemies to Óðinn. In depositions of remains found near Uppland, most of the human bodies are of young males with healed bone trauma, a possible congruence with the sacrificed captives of war mentioned in the written corpus. In almost all instances, human sacrifices occurring in the context of the Old Norse texts are related to Óðinn. Criminals and slaves are the humans being sacrificed in the majority of cases which has been compared to modern executions. Scholars doubt the reliability of some claims of human sacrifice. In the case of Adam of Bremen&#x27;s account of the sacrifices at Uppsala, for example, the author likely exaggerated about the sacrifices of humans in order to demonise Germanic religion. Similarly, the accuracy of the account of human sacrifice in Kjalnesinga saga has been doubted by some scholars.

===Role of blood and ===

In Hákonar saga góða, Snorri Sturluson describes (&quot;sacrificial twigs&quot;) being used like sprinklers to spread blood over the (&quot;altars&quot; or &quot;platforms&quot;), the walls of the hof (both inside and outside) and the people who were present there. It is possible that this description was influenced by the ecclesiastical ceremonies of the medieval church in which holy water was sprinkled over the congregation, or the account in the Old Testament, in which Moses sprinkles blood on his people. Snorri in his description explicitly notes the similarity between and (&quot;aspergillum&quot;). Building on this, it has been proposed that the use of terms such as , and to mean &quot;sacrificial blood&quot;, &quot;sacrificial twig&quot; and &quot;sacrificial bowl&quot; respectively does not accurately reflect their use in pre-Christian times. This is partly based on the absence of the terms from Skaldic poetry and Eddic poems. Olof Sundqvist supports the idea that formerly had the meaning of &quot;lot&quot; in the context of divination.

While Klaus Düwel has taken this argument further, arguing that the sprinkling of sacrificial blood had no influence from heathen Germanic culture and was derived wholly from other sources such as the Old Testament, this has been challenged. The word (corresponding to one of the places sprinkled with blood in Snorri&#x27;s account), likely did have a meaning related to sacrifice in pre-Christian Scandinavian contexts. The phrase (&quot;sacred stand&quot;) is found in Skaldic poetry and there are attestations of blood being smeared on holy objects elsewhere in Western Scandinavia. In Hyndluljóð, Freyja says about how one of her worshippers has made a (&quot;altar&quot;) for her, faced with stone that was turned to glass and reddened with ox blood. Similarly, the U-version of Hervarar saga tells how a holy tree, referred to as a , is reddened with blood from a sacrificial horse. It is unclear if this is meant to be interpreted as a literal tree or as a platform or altar (, or ). In Ynglinga saga, the king Dómaldi is sacrificed in order to make their crops grow and they redden the with his blood; Ynglingatal, the poem upon which this narrative is built, does not reference but it does emphasise that the ground was reddened with blood. It has been suggested that the pouring of blood on the ground below may be related to the taking of soil from below the by Þórólfr from Norway to Iceland during the settlement of the island, as described in Eyrbyggja saga. Religious objects are recorded as being reddened with blood during , like oath-rings according to the Hauksbók version of Landnámabók. The practice of collecting sacrificial blood and pouring it on altars is well attested in other cultures such as in Ancient Greek and religion and in Jewish burnt offerings.

Along with having a role in divination, other suggestions for the importance of blood in have been put forward by scholars. It has been put forward that the violence used to kill the animals found at Hofstaðir may have acted as a way to remove tensions in the community. Olof Sundqvist instead proposes that the blood was used in a performative setting, creating a feeling of spectacle and that the event was strongly separate from usual daily life. If true, those participating in the ceremony would likely have become emotionally engaged in the ritual drama. He further suggests, consistent with ideas by Bruce Lincoln, that there may have been a perceived connection between the killing during the and the killing of Ymir during the creation account told in Gylfaginning, which acted as its mythic counterpart. In this context, the bloodshed may have signalled a renewal of the world, in which conditions would improve for those who performed the .
===Feasting and drinking===
Sacrificial feasts ( or ) had a prominent place in the ancient religious practices of the Scandinavians, and were part of the seasonal festivals attended by large numbers of people. Family rituals such as the &quot;álfablót&quot; in western Sweden mentioned by the Norwegian skald Sigvatr Þórðarson in an early 11th-century poem, were usually performed on farm homesteads. Feasts and ritual drinking at are also mirrored in a mythological context in the depictions of Valhǫll in Hákonarmál.

Horses are often recorded as being eaten in and the eating of horsemeat was made an offence punishable by fines and outlawry by a number of medieval Scandinavian laws made after the adoption of Christianity, such as the Borgarthings-Lov, Den ældre Gulathings-Lov and the Frostathings-Lov. In Iceland, an exception was made for eating horsemeat in private for a short time after the establishment of Christianity but was later repealed. 

The ritual killing of animals was followed by feasts on the meat, as described in the Eddic and Scaldic poetry, the Icelandic sagas, and on rune stones. The meat was boiled in large cooking pits with heated stones, either indoors or outdoors, and ale or mead was drunk in the ceremony.

Sites suggesting religious feasting have been found in Scandinavia such as in Melhus where many cooking pits, mainly dating to between 900 and 1300 CE, were found containing bones of domesticated animals. The hearths in hall-room C at Borg in Lofoten has also been suggested to have been the site of ritual cooking of meat from sacrificed animals. One large pit measuring around 6 m by 3 m has been interpreted as a (a cooking pit intended for ritual preparation of meat). The Old Gutnish cognate term is found as a prefix in Guta saga, which describes those who partook in together as (&quot;boiling companions&quot;) as they cooked their meals made from sacrificed animals together. and are likely both related to (&quot;sacrifice&quot;).
===Function===
More than just a simple sacrifice, was central to all the ritual activities that took place in Norse sacral structures.

====Help from the gods====
Bulls have been noted to have been often sacrificed when seeking help from the gods in legal matters.
 are also often described as being performed in order to achieve good harvests, with some texts explicitly recording that they are held (&quot;for a good harvest and peace&quot;). The rituals are suggested to be effective by some sources such as Fagrskinna, which notes that Hákon Sigurðarson restored the holy sites that had been damaged by Christians and made more than before and soon a period of prosperity followed, with a greater grain harvest and abundance of herring. This has been argued to show an ideology that a legitimate ruler must protect holy places and uphold so as to maintain a good relationship with the gods, in turn leading to the good fortunes of the people.

====Divination====
Divination is suggested to have occurred at some and is recorded in Ynglinga saga in connection to a (&quot;boar sacrifice&quot;). This is not accepted universally by scholars, with Düwel arguing the link is only seen in Snorri&#x27;s works. The link has been proposed to be seen elsewhere though, such as the compound word (&quot;chip used in divination&quot;).

According to &quot;Eyrbyggja saga&quot;, Þórólf Mostrarskeggi made preparations for his settlement of Iceland by performing a before he left Norway:

According to the &quot;Sturlubók&quot; and &quot;Hauksbók&quot; versions of &quot;Landnámabók&quot;, a man named Ingólf prepared to settle in Iceland with his brother Hjörleif by performing a in a similar way to Þórólf:

Hjörleif was later killed by his thralls which Ingólf attributed to his refusal to uphold heathen customs. The book later states that no one dared live where Hjörleif had settled for fear of the landvættir.

====Legitimisation of rulers====
The holding of and associated feasts were an opportunity for rulers to demonstrate their wealth and generosity and praise of these traits is recorded in sources such as the skaldic poem Sigurðardrápa. Giving of gifts at feasts, such as rings, is well attested in Germanic texts such as Egils saga and Beowulf and has been proposed to have been a central practice in building loyalty to the king and strengthening authority. Displaying of heads of eaten animals may have created a degree of competition between communities and played into the wider strategy of rulership in Viking Age Iceland.

==Religious and cultic leaders==

Scholars have debated the concept of religious leaders in Late Iron Age Scandinavia, with some such as Folke Ström supporting the idea that there was no professional priesthood and that rulers instead held this role. While this remains debated by scholars, there is no strong evidence for formal training into religious role whilst the organisation of sanctuaries and by elites is well attested in Old Norse texts.

Certain elites are highlighted for their participation in such as Sigurðr Hlaðajarl who is called (&quot;the most ardent heathen worshipper&quot;) and is described as having maintained all the sacrificial feasts in Trøndelag on behalf of the king. This concept is also attested on the Stentoften stone which records that a man named HaþuwulfR, likely a local ruler, held a to give a good harvest. In Iceland, (&quot;chieftains&quot;) are often recorded as leading public religious activities including . 

Sources further describe how in both Norway and Svetjud, taking part in public was required for the ruler to be accepted by their subjects. tells how the Christian King Hákon came to Trøndelag and did not want to take part in the , upsetting the local farmers and chieftains. At the Frostaþing he was asked to partake in them as his father had done and he was later strongly pressured to eat horse liver at a (&quot;sacrificial feast&quot;) in Mære. Similarly, the heathen king Blótsveinn took part in a horse sacrifice and ate horsemeat when becoming king of the Svear according to . The U-version of this saga further tells how Blótsveinn became king after his brother-in-law, Ingi, refused to uphold the old customs due to him being Christian and was thus driven away by the Svear to Västergötland. This closely resembles Adam of Bremen&#x27;s description of king Anunder who was also driven out for refusing to uphold the performing of .

There is evidence of being led by women such as the (&quot;housewife&quot;) in Vǫlsa þáttr and possibly the who is also mentioned as holding álfablót in Austrfararvísur. Whilst absent from detailed accounts such as those in , this is consistent with a wider Germanic context of some women playing central roles in ceremonies, the holding of feasts and running of the farm. This is attestedin written sources such as Beowulf, Egils saga and the Hassmyra Runestone and is potentially also represented in the archaeological record in high status female burials.

==Calendrical ==
===Yearly===
====Beginning of winter====

 taking place at the beginning of winter in Norway and Iceland to celebrate (&quot;winter-nights&quot;) are recorded in multiple sources, such as Gísla saga Súrssonar, in which the goði Þorgrímr Þorsteinsson sacrifices to Freyr during the feast. This time has been suggested to have marked the beginning of the new year and may be the same as the dísablót, named for the disir, which is recorded in Ynglinga saga as having taken place in Uppsala. Two further are attested as having taken place in Scandinavia, each in a single source. Völsa þáttr, preserved in Flateyjarbók, describes a family in Northern Norway at the beginning of the 11th century CE in which are performed each night in the autumn to the preserved penis of a horse that had been previously killed. An álfablót is recorded as having taken place in autumn in Svetjud in Austrfaravísur, written around 1020 CE. 

In Anglo-Saxon contexts, are recorded as occurring in Blōtmōnaþ, a month in the Old English calendar which roughly corresponds to the Gregorian month of November.

====Later in winter====
Other are also recorded as having taken place in winter, such as the in Trøndelag recorded in Heimskringla. Yule was celebrated in the middle of winter and had a diversity of religious components such as the performing of and heitstrengingar. The Þorrablót was held at midwinter in the month of Þorri. The Orkneyinga saga tells in an aetiological story that the got its name from the son of King Snær who held a every year at this time but it is more likely it got its name from the month.

====Summer====
Óláfs saga Tryggvasonar mentions a (&quot;midsummer sacrifice&quot;) at Mære. Furthermore, Ynglinga saga describes how Odin instituted three festivals in Sweden, one of which was the (&quot;sacrifice for victory&quot;), which was to take place at the start of summer.

====Other====
Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s Gesta Danorum tells how Hadding, after having his fleet destroyed in a storm began sacrificing dark-coloured victims to Frey to regain his favourof the gods. The sacrifice was repeated yearly, being called by the Swedes the Frøblot

===Every nine years===
====Lejre====
Thietmar of Merseburg wrote in his chronicle, dated to the early 11th century CE, that the Danes had their main cult centre on Zealand at Lejre and gathered there every nine years and held a large sacrifice:

It has been noted that at the time of Thietmar&#x27;s writing, Denmark had been nominally Christian for nearly 50 years and it is unlikely that large scale were still being performed at the end of the 10th century in Lejre. It has been further noted that Thietmar was determined to show the heathen Danes as being as ferocious and backwards as possible, using large numbers to show their barbarity. He further potentially based his description on existing literature available to him, which formed part of a long tradition of supposing that heathens in general commonly sacrificed humans. Such sources would have allowed him to further dehumanise the Danish heathen population and depict them as evil.

====Uppsala====

The chronicler Adam of Bremen has described a being performed every 9 years at Temple at Uppsala in Sweden in Gesta Hammaburgensis ecclesiae pontificum, written in the mid 11th century CE:

Rudolf Simek has argued that Adam of Bremen had a strong motive in his work to present both that a Christian mission to Scandinavia would be successful, while also emphasising the urgency as the heathens were still supposedly performing what he perceived as evil practices, such as performing blood sacrifices to idols. He proposes that he likely drew on accounts such as Thietmar of Merseburg&#x27;s chronicle and this could have been the source of certain details such as it recurring every nine years, although the possibility does remain that similar sacrifices were held at both religious sites. Despite this, he argues there that the account is still informed by reliable sources and notable details are not found in sources that he would have had access to, such as the hanging of the sacrificed in trees.

==Reception by medieval Christians==
=== strengthening evil spirits===

Several conversion þættir, short stories concerned with reconciling Christian doctrine and heathen beliefs, present as harmful practices that, whilst effective in bringing benefits to the community that performs them, function by empowering evil spirits that pose as the helpful beings in which the heathens believe.

The conversion þáttr Óláfs þáttr Geirstaðaálfs gives an account of Óláfr digrbeinn, a king who the author says predicted his own death and warned his people not to perform to him after he dies, claiming that doing so turns the dead into trolls. Following this, Óláfr explains that these demons can bring good harvests but are also harmful. After his death, bad harvests occur and the people ignore his requests and worship him, calling him &quot;Geirstaðaálfr&quot; (&quot;the elf of Geirstad&quot;). Shortly after this, the harvests improve though when they stop their , the evil spirits that were receiving the gifts become angered. It has been proposed that this tale is the result of the author imperfectly trying to combine the ideas of Christian demonology and &quot;the noble heathen&quot;, who is meant to maintain his dignity after death.

Similarly in another conversion þáttr, Ögmundar þáttr dytts, the author equates Freyr and the devil and explains that the constant offerings to the carving of Freyr have given the devil the ability to speak through it so as to strengthen their belief in Freyr. Later in the tale, Óláfr Tryggvason spiritually helps a Norwegian named Gunnar in defeating the devil, driving it out of the wooden carving. Gunnar then pretends to be Freyr, putting on the clothes of the cult image and accepting offerings of valuable gifts from the worshippers of the god, who stop sacrificing animals from then on.

===Banning and suppression===
The Anglo-Saxon Penitential of Theodore imposes 1-10 years of penance for those (&quot;who sacrifice to demons&quot;). In this context, &quot;demons&quot; would likely have been used to refer to heathen gods and other beings connected to the cult, given that these were commonly equated in Christian thought. The penitential further prohibits the eating of food offered in sacrifices to the recipient being. Similar prohibitions are seen throughout later law codes in England such as the laws of King Wihtred of Kent. In Norðhymbra preosta lagu, are explicitly forbidden along with other practices deemed heathen such as idol-worship, with those caught performing them being made to pay 5 half-marks to the Church and 5 to the king.

Early Norwegian law codes explicitly forbid performing of , making it a punishable offence. The Older Gulaþing Law, dating to around the mid 11th century CE, bans performing of to heathen gods, howes or hǫrgar, listing it an offence for which the punishment is a fine, penance and if this is not followed, expulsion from the land. This is built upon in the ecclesiastical Law of Sverrir Sigurðarson, which further forbids to heathen vættir, and is consistent with the Frostaþing law which likewise bans . When Christianity was adopted as the main religion of Iceland, were allowed for a short time, as long as they were performed in private, with the punishment being lesser outlawry if they were observed publicly. This exception was soon repealed and the practice was fully banned.

The section of Gutalagen, the legal code for Gotland, imposes fines for those who perform , along with those who follow heathen customs more widely. It further specifies that it is forbidden to make invocations with food or drink if they are not following Christian customs. In Sweden, the Upplandslagen forbade veneration of groves and stones, and sacrificing to (&quot;idols&quot;).

===Incorporation into Christian culture===
Upon adoption of Christianity by the elite, ritual drinking at was sometimes blended with the incoming traditions, as recorded in the late 12th-century history of the kings of Norway &quot;Ágrip&quot; when King Óláfr Tryggvason: 

This process of incorporating pre-existing heathen traditions into Christian traditions is likely also seen with the ritual formula (&quot;for good harvest and peace&quot;). In Hákonar saga góða it is used as part of Njörðr&#x27;s and Freyr&#x27;s toast, while other sources record it being used in a Christian context. Den ældre Gulathings-Lov, for example, states that the beer drunk during All Saint&#x27;s Day and Christmas should be consecrated to thank Christ and Mary (&quot;For property and peace&quot;).

==Modern period==
After the banning of by church officials, the giving of food and drink to beings believed to inhabit the landscape continued as part of local folk practices. This includes the offering to house spirits such as tomter in Sweden which is recorded throughout history such as in medieval criticisms by individuals such as heliga Birgitta and Olaus Magnus and folktales as late as the 20th century. Further, the at Yule may be the origin of the practice in Orkney recorded in the 18th century by which each family in Sandwick that rears pigs would slaughter one sow on the 17th of December which was known as Sow Day. A similar practice is recorded in the 19th century in which each household on North Ronaldsay slaughtered a sheep known as the Yule sheep on Christmas Eve.

Reconstructionist adherents of contemporary Germanic paganism have developed traditions of &quot;blót&quot; rituals celebrated in a contemporary context since the 1970s. In these practices, animal sacrifice is usually replaced with offerings of food or drink, although there remains a large focus on sharing food and strengthening relationships.

<text>Anarchists Against the Wall (AAtW; ) sometimes called &quot;Anarchists Against Fences&quot; or &quot;Jews Against Ghettos&quot;, was a direct action group composed of Israeli anarchists and anti-authoritarians who opposed the construction of the Israeli West Bank barrier.

A member of Anarchists Against the Wall described the construction of the barrier as part of a strategy of ethnic cleansing, &quot;one of the greatest threats the Palestinian population has known over the last century... which is to make life so appalling for the Palestinian people that they will be left with one choice: move out.&quot;

The group disbanded, at least in part due to the decline in Palestinian popular resistance in the late 2010s.

A collection of writings by various anti-wall activists under the name &quot;Anarchists Against the Wall: Direct Action and Solidarity with the Palestinian Popular Struggle&quot; was published in the English language by AK Press in 2013.

==Activities==
The activists routinely broke the law, based on their position that the construction of the West Bank barrier was illegal according to international law, making the barrier itself illegitimate.
Their direct action took the form of entering closed-off military zones, burning tires, halting construction work, damaging or tearing down sections of the barrier, breaking through gates of the barrier, and throwing stones. The military responses against the Palestinians, Israelis, and foreign national activists included tear gas canisters, rubber-coated metal bullets, concussion grenades, and at times live ammunition.

On 26 December 2003, during an AAtW demonstration near the village of Mas&#x27;ha, the Israeli Defense Forces fired shots after demonstrators started to shake the locked gate in the fence. Israeli anarchist and former paratrooper Gil Na&#x27;amati was shot in both legs. This got a great deal of media coverage, leading the group to keep what had been a temporary name that it was using at the moment.

<text>The Black League was a Finnish heavy metal band. They were formed in 1998 by Taneli Jarva, three years after his departure from the gothic metal band Sentenced. The Black League&#x27;s first two full-lengths carry on the spirit from Taneli&#x27;s work with his former band, seasoning their metal with elements of traditional rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll. On their third release, &quot;Man&#x27;s Ruin Revisited&quot;, these influences take an even more prominent role in their sound. In October 2014, Taneli Jarva pronounced of his decision to call the band the quits due to &quot;lack of personal inspiration&quot;.

== Band members ==
* Taneli Jarva – lead vocals (1998–2014)
* Maike Valanne – rhythm guitar, backing vocals (1998–2014)
* Heavy Hiltunen – lead guitar (2005–2014)

<text>The A1 motorway, also known as the Athens–Thessaloniki–Evzonoi (A.Th.E.) motorway, and formerly the Patras–Athens–Thessaloniki–Evzonoi (P.A.Th.E.) motorway, is the 2nd longest motorway in Greece with a length of 550 km. It is the principal north–south road connection in Greece, connecting the country&#x27;s capital Athens with the regions of Thessaly and Macedonia, as well as the country&#x27;s second largest city, Thessaloniki. It starts from Neo Faliro in Attica and continues north to reach the Evzonoi border station, on the Greek border with North Macedonia.

Today, the construction, operation and maintenance of the A1 motorway have been largely outsourced to private companies: Aftokinitodromos Aigaiou SA. (Kleidi, Imathia - Raches, Fthiotida), Kentriki Odos SA (Raches, Fthiotida - Skarfia, Fthiotida) and Nea Odos SA (Skarfia, Fthiotida - Metamorfosi, Attica). The section of Kleidi, Imathia-Evzoni since 2014 operates and is maintained by Egnatia Odos SA.

== Route ==
The motorway passes through Mainland Greece and has largely replaced National Road 1. It begins at Kifissou Avenue, Athens, just north of the Bay of Phaliro, and continues northward to Evzonoi, on the border with the country&#x27;s northern neighbour, North Macedonia, where it continues as the A1. Before the European routes numbers were changed, the northern part from Efzoni to EO2 was E5N, while today the entire road is part of European route E75. The task of maintaining and charging for parts of the motorway has recently been ceded to private consortia, part of the deal for the construction of the A5 (Ionia Odos), the A3/E65, and the bypass of Tempe Valley.

The part west of downtown Athens runs over the Cephisus river and Kifissou Avenue. From north of the boundary of Voiotia - Phthiotis, up to near Velestino, the tollway runs close to the coast of the Aegean Sea. It then continues north of the Tempe Valley and up to the junction of the European route E90. It then shares a 25 km common part with the A2/E90 (on a west–east direction), and then, at the &quot;Axios Interchange&quot;, continues north to Evzonoi and the national border with North Macedonia. Its total length is approximately 550 km.

==History==

=== 1950s-1970s ===
The old Greek National Road 1, was a historic road, which connected Athens with the Customs of Evzoni, through Dhekelia, Atalanti, Kamena Vourla, Thermopylae, Lamia, Stylida, Almyros, Velestino, Larissa, Valley of Tempi, Katerini, Alexandria, Gefyra and Polykastro. The road followed the route of the streets of antiquity. However, over time, its specifications began to be considered obsolete, as in the rest of Europe, modern highways began were started to be built. Thus, in the mid-1950s, construction work began on a new road, which began in 1959 with the delivery of the Larissa-Katerini section (Later, the Athens-Lamia section in 1962 and the Lamia-Larissa section in 1967) and were completed in 1973, with the delivery of the part Katerini - Thessaloniki - Evzoni. For the most part it was - (except for the part of the Valley of Tempi, which was , because it was built on a mountain) and 2 traffic lanes (1 lane + 1 auxiliary lane in each direction), without a median strip. The Polykastro - Evzoni section was the first section with motorway specifications.

=== 1980-today ===
Work on the conversion to a motorway began in the mid-1980s, with the construction of the sections Klidi interchange- Gallikos river (delivered in 1988), Bogiati camp - Kryoneri interchange (delivered in 1989) (4.5 km), Inofyta interchange- Schimatari interchange (delivered in 1989) (12.5 km), Ritsona interchange - Thebes interchange (delivered in 1989) (14.8 km). In the early 1990s, work began on the entire length of the sections Athens - Thebes interchange, and Katerini - Klidi.

As early as 1995, National Road 1 had highway specifications in the sections Athens - Yliki, Katerini - Klidi - Thessaloniki and Polykastro - Evzoni.

In 1998, it had six lanes in the Athens (Metamorfosi) -Thebe section and four in the Thebes-Tempi section, with the exception of a few sections in Magnesia, which still had two.

In 2002 the Yliki-Agios Konstantinos section was completed.

In 2004 the first tunnel of the A1 was built, the tunnel of Katerini (tunnels of Alexander the Great and Philip), while in the same year Kifissos Avenue was handed over, which is the part of the road that connects Metamorfosi with Faliro, above the Kifissos river, inside Athens.

In November 2017, with the launch of the tender for the privatization of Egnatia Motorway and the announcement of its terms, it was announced that the upgrade of the Halastra-Polykastro section from an expressway to as motorway was under planning. This was confirmed in September 2018. Construction costs are estimated to exceed €200 million, and the remainder of the axis from Polykastro to Evzoni, which has already been characterized a motorway will be upgraded with more modern features such as safety barriers, new signage and road improvements.

In 2005, it was completed along its entire length, except for the &quot;Horseshoe&quot; of Maliakos and Tempi.

On June 13, 2007, the Aegean Motorway SA was established, which undertook the construction and operation of the motorway in the Raches-Klidi section.

In the same year, the first sections of Maliakos, the Agios Konstantinos Bypass, the Kamenon Vourlon Bypass and the 4.5 km long Agia Paraskevi-Agia Marina section were opened to traffic. In 2008 the Thermopylae-Bralos Bypass section was delivered.

In 2014, the Velestino interchange was completed, which connects ATHE with Volos.

In 2015, the last section of Maliakos Stylida-Raches with the tunnels of Stylida, with the upgraded Lamia interchange and the new bridge of Sperchios (bypass of Lamia) was handed over to traffic.

In 2016, the northern interchange of Katerini was completed, after about 26 years of construction, due to expropriation and financing problems. On April 6, 2017, the section Evangelismos - Skotina (bypass of Tempi and Platamonas), 25 km long, was delivered. In November 2017, with the start of the tender for the privatization of Egnatia Odos and the announcement of its terms, it became known that the HRDH may include in the object of the Concession Agreement the upgrade of the section Halastra - Polykastro from expressway to motorway, which was confirmed in September 2018. The construction cost is estimated to exceed 200 million euros, while the rest of the axis from Polykastro to Evzoni, which already has highway features, will be upgraded with more modern features such as safety railings, new signage and pavement improvement.

<doc id="1087195" wikidata="Q3258484" url="?curid=1087195" title="Might makes right">
<text>&quot;Might makes right&quot; or &quot;might is right&quot; is an aphorism that asserts that those who hold power are the origin of morality, and they control a society&#x27;s view of right and wrong. Montague defined kratocracy or kraterocracy (from the ) as a government by those strong enough to seize control through violence or deceit.

&quot;Might makes right&quot; has been described as the credo of totalitarian regimes. The sociologist Max Weber analyzed the relations between a state&#x27;s power and its moral authority in . Realist scholars of international politics use the phrase to describe the &quot;state of nature&quot; in which power determines the relations among sovereign states.

== History ==

The idea, though not the wording, has been attributed to the &quot;History of the Peloponnesian War&quot;, written around 410 BC by the ancient historian Thucydides, who stated that &quot;right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.&quot;

In the first chapter of Plato&#x27;s &quot;Republic&quot;, authored around 375 BC Thrasymachus claims that &quot;justice is nothing else than the interest of the stronger&quot;, which Socrates then disputes. Callicles in &quot;Gorgias&quot; argues similarly that the strong should rule the weak, as a right owed to their superiority.

The Book of Wisdom, written around the first century BC to first century AD, describes the reasoning of the wicked: &quot;Let us oppress the righteous poor man; let us not spare the widow nor regard the gray hairs of the aged. But let our might be our law of right, for what is weak proves itself to be useless.&quot;

The related idea of &quot;woe to the conquered&quot; is stated by Livy, in which the similar Latin phrase &quot;vae victis&quot; is first recorded.

An early instance of the phrase in English is found in Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s 1839 essay &quot;Chartism&quot;: &quot;Might and Right do differ frightfully from hour to hour; but give them centuries to try it in, they are found to be identical.&quot; He later clarified his position in a journal entry from 1848, saying that &quot;right is the eternal symbol of might&quot; rather than the reverse.

In 1846, the American pacifist and abolitionist Adin Ballou (1803–1890) wrote, &quot;But now, instead of discussion and argument, brute force rises up to the rescue of discomfited error, and crushes truth and right into the dust. &#x27;Might makes right,&#x27; and hoary folly totters on in her mad career escorted by armies and navies.&quot;

Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s Cooper Union campaign address (1860) reverses the phrase: &quot;Let us have faith that right makes might, and in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it&quot;. He spoke in defense of neutral engagement with slave-holders, as against violent confrontation.

Arthur Desmond authored &quot;Might Is Right&quot; in 1896, which prompted criticism from Leo Tolstoy.

Philosopher William Pepperell Montague coined the term &quot;Kratocracy&quot;, from the (), meaning &quot;strong&quot;, for government by those who are strong enough to seize power through force or cunning.

In a letter to Albert Einstein from 1932, Sigmund Freud also explores the history and validity of &quot;might versus right&quot;.

Pope Francis has observed that &quot;immense inequality, injustice and acts of violence&quot; have arisen from adoption of the principle of &quot;might is right&quot;.

<doc id="1087196" wikidata="Q795393" url="?curid=1087196" title="Placentophagy">
<text>Placentophagy, also known as placentophagia, is the act of consuming part or all of the afterbirth following parturition in mammals. Parturition involves the delivery of the neonate, as well as the placenta and fetal membranes. The placenta is a critical organ that develops in the maternal uterus during pregnancy to support the fetus. It connects to the fetus via the umbilical cord in order to allow nutrient transport, waste excretion and gas exchange between mother and fetus. The morphological features of the placenta differ among species, but the function is universal.
The behaviour is characteristic to the mother of the majority of placental mammals. Significant documentation has been provided on placentophagy in a range of animals.

Anomalies generally include humans and aquatic species, as well as camels. However, the concept is becoming more popular among women in the West, despite its controversial overtone.

Theories as to why mammals engage in placentophagy are related to the many proposed benefits of placental consumption. These vary between animals but tend to be behavioural, medical or spiritual in nature.

== Prevalence ==
Placentophagy is a normality in most members of the taxonomic group Eutheria. It has been observed in animals ranging from rodents to primates, and even in some instances humans. The most extensive study has been on animals in orders Rodentia, Chiroptera, Lagomorpha, Carnivora, Perissodactyla, Artiodactyla, and Primates. Exceptions to the ubiquitous behaviour in mammals can be seen in humans, sea mammals and camelids. It is suggested that the portion of marine species that do not practice placentophagy are ones that deliver their offspring in the water because beneficial components are dispersed upon expulsion from the mother, and that the domestication of camelids has eradicated the behaviour by placing stress and selective pressure on the species.

=== In rabbits ===

Placentophagia in rabbits is exclusively performed by maternal figures that have recently given birth. A study shows that even when pregnant and pre-parturient female rabbits are presented with placental meal there is little participation in the behavior but all postpartum mothers ate the afterbirth. When compared with the consumption of liver, another protein source, the occurrence of placentophagia alone increases by roughly 55% in the short 1–5 day period following parturition. The liver is preferential to non-pregnant, pregnant and pre-parturient mothers consistently as opposed to post-partum mothers who chose to consume only placenta when presented with both. The same study also looked at the interest of the placenta in pregnant rabbits, they saw that in the days leading up to delivery the animals were more intrigued by the placenta when it was presented, which was shown by increasing sniffing of the placenta. The attraction was not demonstrated towards the liver. This infers that there is a tie between elements prompting both delivery and placentophagy in pregnant maternal rabbits. In some instances placentophagia is tied to cannibalism in rabbits. As the mother engages in the act of consuming the placenta, they accidentally ingest the neonate as well.

=== In rats ===
Placentophagia has been studied most commonly in rodents, specifically rats. There have been multiple conclusions drawn from the available literature. One major finding is that the consumption of the afterbirth and associated materials increases the onset and intensity of maternal behavior in rats. The increased contact between the adult and the infant is what enhances the adoption of parental behavior. In addition to increasing the parenting tendencies of mother rats, it has been seen that placentophagia by female weanling laboratory rats when the mother births a subsequent litter, elevates alloparenting behavior toward their siblings. Additional research has shown that ingestion of the placenta and amniotic fluid influences the pain tolerance in pregnant rats via elevation of naturally occurring opioid-mediated analgesia. Production of endogenous opioids produced by the central nervous system, is increased during the birthing process which raises the pain threshold of the mother. When coupled with the ingestion of placenta or amniotic fluid, there is a drastic increase in the opioid effect. A test whereby rats were given meat rather than placenta supported the contribution of the afterbirth components to the enhanced opioid effect by showing no increase in the pain threshold of the post-partum mother.

== Hypothesized benefits ==
There are numerous hypothesized benefits to the practice of placentophagy in both human and nonhuman mammals, which are seen as the direct motivation for various animals to engage in the consumption of the afterbirth. Many of these proposed benefits have since been disproved through scientific study.

=== Satiation of hunger ===
Some initial conjectures related directly to the satiation of specific and general maternal hunger. These hinged on the idea that prior to parturition mothers ceased to eat and so, immediately after birth they consumed the placenta to satisfy an intense hunger. A further idea was that of specific hunger, according to which the maternal figure participated in placentophagy in order to replenish any resources depleted during pregnancy that were contained within the placenta. This was later disproved by studies on rats and other species showing that a wide range of animals do not typically decrease the amount of food or water taken in prior to delivery, and that rats presented with placenta will consume it regardless of pregnancy or virginity.

=== Cleanliness and protection against predation ===
Another aspect of placentophagy that was initially considered a beneficial reason for its occurrence was that the consumption of the afterbirth ensured cleanliness of the nest and eliminated any sign of new and vulnerable offspring. It was suggested that nesting animals, who would then rear their young within the nest, benefited by having an aseptic area. Further, predators would be attracted to the site of parturition by the scent of blood and of fetal tissue, so ingesting the afterbirth would eliminate the ability for predators to easily locate newborns. This would in turn provide protection for the defenseless young. These hypothesized benefits were later rejected because the act of consuming the placenta would be more time-consuming than merely abandoning the site of parturition or removing the afterbirth from the nesting area, each of which would provide the same benefit as placentophagy was presumed to provide.

=== Increased pain threshold ===
A newer hypothesis about the maternal consumption of afterbirth in mammals is that the placenta contains compounds that increase pain tolerance post parturition. Although it is known that during pregnancy and labour there is a natural increase in internal production of enkephalins and endorphins that decrease the sensation of pain, studies indicated that the consumption of placenta by maternal rats after delivery spiked the subsequent numbers of these opioids. This was due to the active ingredient present in the placenta as well as the amniotic fluid, placental opioid-enhancing factor (POEF). It is important to note that afterbirth also contains amniotic fluid, and scientists believe its consumption may be equally as important in the elevation of pain threshold as is the placental ingestion. Amniotic fluid is likely taken in unknowingly by cleaning the genital area prior or post delivery, or by cleaning or kissing the infant soon after expulsion.

== Evolution ==
Placentophagy evolved independently in different lineages as adaptations to various challenges faced by ancestral species. The behaviour was ultimately attractive to the maternal subject based on the hypothesized benefits discussed above but provided some kind of advantage. Based on this advantage, placentophagy was selected for by natural selection which lead to its persistence in mammal species.

== Human placentophagy ==

Although the placenta is revered in many cultures, there is scarce evidence that any customarily eat the placenta after the newborn&#x27;s birth.

Those who advocate placentophagy in humans believe that eating the placenta prevents postpartum depression and other pregnancy complications. Obstetrician and spokesperson for the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists Maggie Blott disputes the post-natal depression theory, stating there is no medical reason to eat the placenta: &quot;Animals eat their placenta to get nutrition – but when people are already well-nourished, there is no benefit, there is no reason to do it.&quot; While no scientific study has proven any benefits, a survey was conducted by American medical anthropologists at the University of South Florida and University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Among the respondents, about three-fourths claimed to have positive experiences from eating their own placenta, citing &quot;improved mood&quot;, &quot;increased energy&quot;, and &quot;improved lactation&quot;.
Human placenta has also been an ingredient in some traditional Chinese medicines, including using dried human placenta, known as &quot;ziheche&quot; (), to treat wasting diseases, infertility, impotence and other conditions.
Most recently, the CDC published a report of a newborn infected with group B &quot;Streptococcus&quot; (GBS) bacteria likely after the mother ingested placenta capsules. Consequently, the CDC said that placenta capsule ingestion should be avoided and to educate mothers interested in placenta encapsulation about the potential risks. A recent publication advised that physicians should discourage placentophagy because it is potentially harmful with no documented benefit.

British celebrity chef Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, known for his series of River Cottage programmes, notoriously cooked and ate a human placenta on one of his programmes.

Pg.104-7 in Cecil Adams&#x27;s &quot;Return of the Straight Dope&quot; (1994) describes a home childbirth, followed by placentophagy, in Berkeley, California.

<text>The Rochelle Railroad Park is a city park located in Rochelle, Illinois where railfans can safely view and photograph trains.

== Location ==

The park is in the eastern quadrant of the double diamond crossing between the Union Pacific Railroad (UP) and BNSF Railway (BNSF) mainlines between Chicago and points west.

The two mainlines cross on the southwest side of Rochelle. The UP (formerly Chicago and North Western Railway) Geneva Subdivision travels through the crossing from the southwest to northeast, from Chicago towards Clinton, Iowa, and Omaha. The UP&#x27;s Global III yard is about 1 mile southwest of the diamond. The BNSF (formerly Burlington Northern Railroad and before that, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad) Aurora Subdivision travels the northwest to southeast corners, from Aurora Illinois to Savannah, Illinois and to the twin cities of Minneapolis-St Paul. This double mainline, four-track, diamond, known as NX Crossing, is at milepost 83.7 on the BNSF, and at 75.3 on the UP.

== History ==
Before the city of Rochelle built the park, railfans often parked just short of an interchange siding connecting the two railroads in the northern quadrant of the crossing. The interchange track connected the northern track of the eastern portion of the UP&#x27;s mainline with the northern track of the western portion of the BNSF&#x27;s mainline. While this parking location allowed railfans to see a great distance towards the west along UP&#x27;s mainline, many vehicles were parked too close to the interchange track to be safe if a train used it. Additionally, there was no protection to keep trespassers off the tracks. The northern interchange track has since been removed although a longer interchange siding still exists on the South quadrant of the crossing.

== Features ==

The city chose the eastern quadrant of the crossing in which to build the park. Many factors went into the selection of the eastern quadrant, but by using it, the city was able to erect an elevated viewing platform with a gazebo-style roof, picnic tables, an area to build a re-creation of a hobo jungle, a display of strap rail track, a small preserved Whitcomb switching locomotive (manufactured by the Whitcomb Locomotive Works of Rochelle), and a paved parking lot. The amenities are further enhanced with public restrooms, vending machines, and a small model railroad shop.

Some of the more technical offerings at the park for railfans to enjoy include the following:
* A live railroad scanner set to monitor both UP and BNSF operational radio frequencies (speakers in the picnic/viewing platform) or on low power FM 106.9.
* Wi-Fi
* Two ATCS monitors showing a live view of the UP Geneva Sub (one in museum, one by back door visible to outside)
* A live internet-viewable webcam with audio atop the viewing platform&#x27;s roof operated by Trains Magazine, EarthCam and Virtual Railfan.

Indicators that a train is approaching the park include the following:
* Eastbound - Both railroads have defect detectors just west of the crossing that signal train statuses over the radio
* Westbound - Grade crossing signals to the east of the park at N 9th Street will activate to protect the grade crossings although trains will no longer (since 2016) signal due to Rochelle having a quiet zone.

<doc id="1087209" wikidata="Q999706" url="?curid=1087209" title="Vincent Brady">
<text>Vincent Brady (14 March 1936 – 6 October 2020) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician. He served under Taoiseach Charles Haughey as Government Chief Whip (1987–1991) and Minister for Defence (1991–1992).

==Early life==
Brady was born in Dublin on 14 March 1936. His parents, Tom and Nellie Gilroy, were a young couple from County Cavan. As they were not married at the time, they placed Vincent in foster care. He was fostered by Margaret Bourke, a widow from County Kilkenny, and her two sisters. They lived on Tolka Road in Ballybough. Until 1998, Brady was unaware that he had six younger siblings. He met his birth family at the age of 62. He was educated at St Canice&#x27;s CBS and O&#x27;Connell School in Dublin, before studying accounting and business at the College of Commerce in Rathmines. Before embarking on a career in politics, he was a director of a company engaged in machinery distribution, which he had founded in 1970.

==Political career==
Brady was elected to Dáil Éireann at his first attempt, in the 1977 general election for the Dublin North-Central constituency. Two years later he became involved in local politics, when he was elected to Dublin City Council.

When in 1979 Fianna Fáil faced its first leadership election since 1966, Brady backed his constituency colleague Charles Haughey against the only other contender, George Colley. Haughey won, and Brady continued to back him during the three attempts in the early 1980s to displace Haughey from the party leadership.

During the early 1980s, Brady was a member of the Council of Europe. In 1984 he joined the front bench of the party as Chief Whip. He was re-elected to Dublin City Council in 1985, having topped the poll in Dublin Clontarf and received the highest vote in the country. When Fianna Fáil returned to government in 1987, Brady was appointed Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and Defence, the Government Chief Whip. He served in that position until November 1991, when he joined the cabinet as Minister for Defence. He remained in that position until February 1992, when Albert Reynolds became Taoiseach and sacked Brady, along with many other senior ministers who had served under Haughey. Brady retired from politics at the 1992 general election. After his retirement from politics, he concentrated on continuing the development of his distribution business.

==Personal life==
Brady married Mary Neville, known as Mollie, and they had three children. Vincent and Mollie were later estranged. He began a relationship with Dymphna O’Moore who was his partner until his death on 6 October 2020. Brady&#x27;s estate was valued at €31,191,408. He bequeathed property and shares to Mollie, Dymphna, his children, and his grandchildren. He left €10,000 to his foster siblings. He also left €5,000 to the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul with an “express wish” that the money be used in Marino, Dublin, “insofar as possible”.

<doc id="1087212" wikidata="Q7767813" url="?curid=1087212" title="The Symphony Sessions (Red Rider album)">
<text>The Symphony Sessions was a live album released in December 1989 by Tom Cochrane &amp; Red Rider. It was the band&#x27;s seventh and final album.

The album was recorded with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra at the Northern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium in Edmonton, Alberta. The concert featured a 56-piece orchestra, including six players who had performed with Procol Harum at that band&#x27;s 1971 performance with the Edmonton Symphony Orchestra.

Following this album, Tom Cochrane pursued a solo career, releasing &quot;Mad Mad World&quot; in 1991.

==Background and writing==
The album was recorded by Biff Dawes and the Westwood One mobile unit over two days and featured on one of the &quot;Westwood One live&quot; concert series shows. Two tracks recorded during these sessions were featured on the Westwood One concert but did not make the final album cut: &quot;Ocean Blues (Emotion Blue)&quot; and &quot;The Untouchable One&quot;. Both songs are from the 1986 self-titled &quot;Tom Cochrane &amp; Red Rider&quot; album.

Tom Cochrane explained the idea behind the album: &quot;When we put our songs together... Kenny (Greer) has sort of a classical background, as I do... we never had the budget or the means to do it with these kind of players, plus you want to keep it intact as a band, so we&#x27;ve always done it with synthesizers and whatever we had at hand, so it&#x27;s nice to go in with a real complement of players and have them contribute like they did. In our music, &quot;Lunatic Fringe,&quot; for example, there are parts implied that we thought should be transposed from keyboard to orchestral instruments, and then in other areas we gave George (Blondheim) carte blanche and said, &#x27;Do what you want, add some creative input&#x27;. &quot;

The concerts were recorded live with a 56-piece orchestra and then mixed down at the Metalworks Studios in Toronto.

<text>The River Wye is a river in Buckinghamshire, England. It takes its name from the town of High Wycombe through which it flows, rather than the town being named after the river, as is more commonly the case.

Around in length, the Wye rises close to West Wycombe village in the Chiltern Hills and flows through High Wycombe, where it is fed from other tributataries such as Hughenden Stream, before emptying into the River Thames at Bourne End, on the reach above Cookham Lock. In particularly wet years, the source can temporarily change and effectively extend the river by another mile, due to a chalk spring rising above the ground in a field further up the same valley. The River Wye now runs in underground culverts through the centre of High Wycombe. Pann Mill watermill, at the eastern end of Wycombe, is the last remaining watermill on the river.

==History==
There is a long history of water-mills being operated in the Wye Valley which drops about in its course. The Domesday Book records eighteen of them in the nine miles between West Wycombe and the Thames.
By the seventeenth century there were fulling mills as well as corn mills. A Court of Survey in 1627 lists six mills running upstream from the boundary with Wooburn Parish: the paper mill, Tredway, Loudwater, Bassetsbury, Chalfonts (Rye) and Bridge. There were by this time at least two paper mills: Glory in Wooburn Green and Hedge in Loudwater. By 1636 another paper mill had been established in the parish of West Wycombe and by 1656 another at Marsh, below Wycombe. At this time paper was made from rags and by the end of the eighteenth century more than 150 men were recorded as papermakers in the valley. In 1816 there were 32 paper mills (some of which also milled corn), four which only milled corn and one which was also a saw mill. This was when paper making reached its peak in the valley. However, the introduction of the Fourdrinier machine at the nearby Frogmore Paper Mill, which produced a continuous roll of paper, led to widespread unemployment and many families went to the cotton mills of Lancashire. In 1830 there were riots when machine wreckers broke the machines at Ash, Marsh Green and Loudwater. Twenty men were punished by penal transportation to Tasmania.

Papermaking continued at the Soho and Glory mills till the end of the twentieth century, though the water-mills gave way to steam in the mid-nineteenth century. The Soho mill in Wooburn was the prime supplier of high-grade colour paper till its demise in 1984.

==Mills==
Shown in order from highest to lowest. Note that Marsh Green to Treadway are on an extra cut parallel to Pan to Loudwater Mills. The number is that given by registration in the eighteenth century.

<text>Limone sul Garda (Gardesano: ) is a town and &quot;comune&quot; in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy (northern Italy), at the western bank of Lake Garda.

==History==
Despite the presence of famous cultivations of lemons (the meaning of in Italian), the town&#x27;s name is probably derived from the ancient (elm) or (Latin: boundary, referring to the communes of Brescia and the Bishopric of Trento). Between 1863 and 1905 the denomination of the comune was Limone San Giovanni.

On 13 September 1786, the famous German poet J. Wolfgang Goethe passed by the village by boat and described with these words its lemon gardens:

:&quot;We passed Limone, the mountain-gardens of which, laid out terrace-fashion, and planted with citron-trees, have a neat and rich appearance. The whole garden consists of rows of square white pillars placed at some distance from each other, and rising up the mountain in steps. On these pillars strong beams are laid, that the trees planted between them may be sheltered in the winter. The view of these pleasant objects was favored by a slow passage, and we had already passed Malcesine when the wind suddenly changed, took the direction usual in the day-time, and blew towards the north.&quot;

(Italian Journey, J. Wolfgang Goethe, 1816–17)

Until the 1940s, the town was reachable only by lake or through the mountains, with the road to Riva del Garda being completed in 1932, but today Limone is one of the most renowned tourist resorts in the area.

==Municipal government==
Limone is headed by a mayor (&#x27;) assisted by a legislative body, the &#x27;, and an executive body, the &#x27;. Since 1995 the mayor and members of the &#x27; are directly elected together by resident citizens, while from 1945 to 1995 the mayor was chosen by the legislative body. The &#x27; is chaired by the mayor, who appoints others members, called &#x27;. The offices of the &#x27; are housed in a building usually called the &#x27; or &quot;&quot;.

Since 1995, the mayor of Limone is directly elected by citizens, originally every four, then every five years. The current mayor is Franceschini Risatti, elected for a fourth term on 10 June 2024.

==Health==
In 1979, researchers discovered that people in Limone possess a mutant form of apolipoprotein (called ApoA-1 Milano) in their blood, that induced a healthy form of high-density cholesterol, which resulted in a lowered risk of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases.

The protein appears to have given residents of the village extreme longevity - a dozen of those living here are over the age of 100 (for c. 1,000 total inhabitants). The origin of the mutation has been traced back to a couple who lived in Limone in the 17th century. Research has been ongoing to develop pharmaceutical treatments against heart disease based on mimicking the beneficial effects of the ApoA-1 mutation.

<text>Gerard Brady (1 July 1936 – 16 May 2020) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Education from October to December 1982.

Brady was born in Dublin in 1936. He was educated at St. Mary&#x27;s College in Rathmines and later at the College of Science and Technology and the College of Pharmacy in the city. Following his graduation he worked as an ophthalmic optician. Brady&#x27;s first entry into the political scene was at local level when he was elected to Dublin City Council in 1974. At the 1977 general election he was elected to Dáil Éireann at his first attempt, succeeding his father Philip Brady as Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) for the Dublin Rathmines West constituency. He represented Dublin South-East from 1981 onwards.

He was appointed Minister of State at the Department of the Environment by Charles Haughey in March 1982. Following the resignation of Martin O&#x27;Donoghue as Minister for Education on 6 October that year, Haughey chose to make himself acting Minister for three weeks before appointing Brady to the post on 27 October. Less than a month later Fianna Fáil lost the November 1982 general election, and Gemma Hussey became the new Minister for Education on 14 December. Brady&#x27;s Cabinet tenure is one of the shortest in history. He was reappointed to the opposition frontbench but was not given a ministerial job when the party returned to power in 1987, nor in 1989. He lost his seat at the 1992 general election to party colleague Eoin Ryan, and subsequently retired from political life.

Brady died on 16 May 2020, in Donnybrook, Dublin, aged 82.

<text>Brooks Wackerman (born February 15, 1977) is an American musician. He is the current drummer of heavy metal band Avenged Sevenfold, which he joined in 2015. His first album with Avenged Sevenfold was &quot;The Stage&quot; (2016). He was previously the drummer for the punk rock band Bad Religion (2001 to 2015). Wackerman has also performed, either as a member or a session or touring member, with Blink-182, Bad4Good, Infectious Grooves, Glenn Tipton, Mass Mental, Suicidal Tendencies, The Vandals, Avril Lavigne, Korn, Kidneys (in which he sang and played guitar, releasing two albums), Fear and the Nervous System, Tenacious D, Farmikos, Tom Delonge, and Big Talk. His brothers, Chad Wackerman, and John Wackerman, are also drummers.

==Early life==

Wackerman&#x27;s father Chuck, also a drummer, started teaching him how to play drums as early as five years old and was also his jazz band teacher at Los Alamitos High School, winning Most Outstanding Musician at the Reno Jazz Festival in 1993. Wackerman started his musical career as a teen with a group called Bad4Good in 1991. The band released one album in 1992 called &quot;Refugee&quot;, produced by Steve Vai.

==Career==

===Infectious Grooves (1993–2020)===

From 1993 to 2000, Wackerman was a member of Infectious Grooves, playing drums on the albums &quot;Groove Family Cyco&quot; in 1994 and &quot;Mas Borracho&quot; in 2000 as well as touring with the band. He returned to the band when they resumed activities and did a show in Brazil in November 2019.

===Suicidal Tendencies (1996–2001)===
Wackerman was a member of Suicidal Tendencies from 1996 to 2001, playing drums on &quot;Six the Hard Way&quot; in 1998, &quot;Freedumb&quot; in 1999, and &quot;Free Your Soul and Save My Mind&quot; in 2000. He left the band to join Bad Religion in 2001.

===Bad Religion (2001–2015)===
In 2001, he became the drummer for Bad Religion by replacing Bobby Schayer, who left the band due to a shoulder injury. He appeared on five albums with them (&quot;The Process of Belief&quot;, &quot;The Empire Strikes First&quot;, &quot;New Maps of Hell&quot;, &quot;The Dissent of Man&quot; and &quot;True North&quot;) as well as their 2013 EP &quot;Christmas Songs&quot;. On October 27, 2015, Brooks left Bad Religion after deciding it was time to pursue another path. At the time of his departure, Wackerman was Bad Religion&#x27;s all-time longest standing drummer, surpassing Bobby Schayer, who was in the band for ten years. He was also the youngest member of the band, with all of the other members being at least ten years his senior. Wackerman was replaced by Jamie Miller.

===Tenacious D (2006–2015)===
In 2006, for The Pick of Destiny tour, Wackerman was selected to feature as the drummer for Tenacious D due to his previous work on the Vandals&#x27; &quot;Look What I Almost Stepped In...&quot; album, which both Jack Black and Kyle Gass cameo on. He would go on to play for Tenacious D at various festivals as well as support act and benefit concerts throughout 2008 to 2011. in 2012, Wackerman played with Tenacious D again on their Rize of the Fenix tour where he got the nickname &quot;Thunderskin&quot; from Jack Black for comical remark, making appearances on the &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot;, &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; and &quot;The Daily Show with Jon Stewart&quot;. They also performed at the 2012 Festival. Wackerman also appeared in the music videos for their songs &quot;Roadie&quot; and &quot;Rize of the Fenix&quot;. He would perform on their 2012 EP &quot;Tenacious D Jazz&quot; and their 2015 live album &quot;Tenacious D Live&quot;.

=== Avenged Sevenfold (2015–present) ===
On November 4, 2015, it was revealed that Wackerman was the new drummer for Avenged Sevenfold. Brooks was working with the band one year prior to the official announcement because the band wanted to &quot;fit in&quot; with the new drummer. Like his predecessors Mike Portnoy and Arin Ilejay, but unlike the rest of the band members, he doesn&#x27;t have a stage name. His first full-length album with the band was their October 2016 release &quot;The Stage&quot;, which showcased his progressive metal style of drumming, often using fast double kicks and blast beats.

===Other projects===
Alongside Terry Bozzio, Wackerman contributed drums and percussion for Korn&#x27;s untitled album. Wackerman is also the drummer for the Innocent, a thrash metal band featuring bassist Ryan Sinn (formerly of Angels &amp; Airwaves and the Distillers), vocalist Brandan Schieppati (Bleeding Through), and guitarist Dave Nassie (No Use for a Name). In March 2008, Wackerman joined Korn guitarist James &quot;Munky&quot; Shaffer&#x27;s newest solo project, experimental industrial rock band Fear and the Nervous System, alongside vocalist Steve Krolikowski (Repeater), Billy Gould (Faith No More), Leopold Ross (Error), and Zac Baird (Korn, Billy Goat). Brooks also played drums for Avril Lavigne. Brooks filled in for Travis Barker during Blink-182&#x27;s 2013 tour of Australia in the Soundwave festival as well as their sideshows. Brooks was hired to record drums on Blink-182 member Tom DeLonge&#x27;s debut solo album &quot;To the Stars... Demos, Odds and Ends&quot;.

Wackerman formerly fronted Kidneys alongside fellow Tenacious D band member John Spiker. Initially, his brother, John Wackerman played with Kidneys, but he would later be replaced by Todd Hennig (Death By Stereo). A full-length self-titled album was released in 2007, and another album in 2012, entitled &quot;Hold Your Fire&quot;, is available for digital download. The band parted ways in 2012.

Wackerman appeared in The Suicide Machines &quot;S.O.S.&quot; music video in place of drummer Derek Grant, due to Grant&#x27;s refusal to appear in photos or videos.

==Gear==
Wackerman currently endorses Drum Workshop drums, Remo drumheads and also uses Innovative Percussion drumsticks. Additionally, in 2021, after many years of using and endorsing Zildjian cymbals Wackerman officially signed on as an Istanbul Agop artist. He also once had a signature line of drumsticks manufactured by Zildjian as well.

<text>Mali i Thatë (, &quot;Suva Gora&quot;; ) is a mountain in southeast Albania; with a part of it being in the southwest of North Macedonia (known with the name Galičica and declared a National Park) with the highest altitude of 2287 meters.

== Geography ==
It borders Lake Prespa in the east, Lake Ohrid in northwest and overlooks the city of Pogradec to the west. It stretches 25 km from north to south and is 8 km wide in its central part. Mali i Thatë highest peak is Pllaja e Pusit (meaning &quot;Well&#x27;s plateau&quot;) and it reaches an altitude of above sea level. It is found within Albania, close to the Macedonian border. From this high peak, among several mountains of Albania, both Ohrid Lake and Prespa Lake can be seen as well as the third highest peak in North Macedonia, Baba Mountain or Pelister Mountain (2601 m). 
The mountain has an anticlinal shape and is almost completely composed of mesozoic limestone formations. Mali i Thatë has craggy slopes (especially the western face), whereas its crest is almost flat but full of karstic cavities. 

The vegetation is primarily made up of alpine meadows, whereas in the eastern face beech, oak and bush forests are found. 
Near the Albanian village of Goricë the soil is rich of iron bauxite and chalk minerals. During the Albanian Revolt of 1911 Spiro Bellkameni&#x27;s band defeated an Ottoman contingent in Mali i Thatë.

<doc id="1087247" wikidata="Q1541847" url="?curid=1087247" title="The Mark of Zorro (1940 film)">
<text>The Mark of Zorro is a 1940 American black-and-white swashbuckling film released by 20th Century-Fox, directed by Rouben Mamoulian, produced by Darryl F. Zanuck, and starring Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell, and Basil Rathbone.

The film is based on the novel &quot;The Curse of Capistrano&quot; by Johnston McCulley, originally published in 1919 in five serialized installments in &quot;All-Story Weekly&quot;, which introduced the masked hero Zorro; the story is set in Southern California during the early 19th century. After the enormous success of the silent 1920 film adaptation, the novel was republished under that name by Grosset &amp; Dunlap. &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Original Score.

The film was named to the National Film Registry in 2009 by the Library of Congress for being &quot;culturally, historically or aesthetically significant&quot;, and to be preserved for all time.

==Plot==
Don Diego Vega is urgently called home by his father. To all outward appearances, he is the foppish son of a wealthy &quot;ranchero&quot;, the former &quot;alcalde&quot; Don Alejandro Vega, having returned to Alta California after his military education in Spain.

Don Diego is horrified at the way the common people are mistreated by the corrupt new alcalde, Luis Quintero. Don Diego quickly adopts the guise of El Zorro (&quot;The Fox&quot;), a masked outlaw dressed entirely in black, who becomes the defender of the common people and a champion for justice against the uncaring Quintero and his garrison of brutish soldiers.

In the meantime, he romances the alcalde&#x27;s beautiful and innocent niece, Lolita, whom he grows to love. As part of his plan, Don Diego simultaneously flirts with the alcalde&#x27;s wife Inez, filling her head with tales of fashion and culture while nurturing her desire to finally get rid of her cruel husband.

In both his guises, Don Diego must always contend with the governor&#x27;s most capable henchman, the malevolent and deadly Captain Esteban Pasquale. When the current situation comes to a head, he eventually dispatches the captain during a fast-moving rapier duel-to-the-death, as the alcalde looks on in astonishment. This action leads to a forced regime change with the help of the people of Los Angeles, the other landowners, and his father, and though Quintero is defeated, Zorro continues to fight for justice and the common people against the greedy and wicked.

==Reception==
Critic Bosley Crowther at the New York Times expresses good-spirited contempt for the film, comparing it unfavorably to the &quot;silent film version&quot; starring Douglas Fairbanks. Crowther also notes that in 1940, audiences were experiencing “mask” fatigue: “Your regular movie-goer of late has become more or less blasé over the doings of various Lone Rangers and heroes of the Masked Marvel stamp. So there may not be quite the same old punch that there was twenty years ago in this story of the dashing young Spaniard who rode mysteriously through the night, performing great deeds of daring with reckless imprudence in order to rid the land of a cruelly oppressive tyrant.” Crowther praises the film for its “lively, exciting clip” and its “excellent cast of expansive actors.”

==Retrospective appraisal==
Film historian Tom Milne considers &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot;, director Mamoulian’s first foray in action-adventure pictures “a masterpiece of the genre” and simultaneously a deviation from the formula. Milne notes how little “action” actually occurs throughout the picture and how rarely Zorro (Tyrone Power) engages in the “swashbuckling” athleticism which characterized Douglas Fairbanks’ Zorro in the 1920 silent version of the same name. 
 Milne observes that Power was not required to be engage in these Fairbanks-like gymnastics: “Mamoulian was doing the swashbuckling for him.”

The impression that Power is everywhere at once, in almost continuous motion in action sequences, is effected through “cutting on movement” a method that Mamoulian used to create the impression of relentless action. Milne admits that The Mark of Zorro is merely a “swashbuckle” but nonetheless “one of Mamoulian’s most elegant and intelligent films.”

==Theme==
Two related thematic elements converge in the narrative of The Mark of Zorro: the oedipal struggle and the duality in the character of Don Deigo Vega/Zorro. Director Mamoulian’s films had dealt with “double identities,” most notably in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931). The Mark of Zorro is presents another protagonist with “a double life.” Diego crafts an outward persona that is “stereotypically feminine” — gentle, sensitive and ineffectual. His performance is itself a masking of his true self; that of a virile male possessing “guile, wit and superior intellect.” 

Diego’s masculine identity only emerges when he dons his mask and becomes Zorro. Diego&#x27; s discovery that his rightful heritage is usurped by a malignant male authoritarian transforms the youth into the avenging Zorro, who proceeds to destroy “the evil father” figure.

Film historian Marc Spergel discovers another theme in the film’s narrative, an “allusion” to the conflict between the Hollywood film industry establishment and the emerging union organization among employees. The Zorro figure seeks to strip power from the powerful usurpers and hand it to those worthy of merit.

==Remake, music score, and sequel==
&quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; (1974) is a made-for-television remake film starring Frank Langella and co-starring Ricardo Montalbán in the roles played by Power and Rathbone in the original. It reuses Alfred Newman&#x27;s original film score, along with new incidental music composed by Dominic Frontiere.

Portions of Newman&#x27;s original music score were reused by composer Ian Fraser for the George Hamilton swashbuckling comedy film &quot;Zorro, the Gay Blade&quot; (1981). The film&#x27;s storyline is a tongue-in-cheek sequel to the original 1940 film. Hamilton sent a note to director Rouben Mamoulian informing him that &quot;Zorro, the Gay Blade&quot;, was being dedicated to him in honor of his 1940 version starring Tyrone Power.

==1920 silent version==
&quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; is a sound remake of the lavish 1920 smash-hit silent film starring Douglas Fairbanks as Zorro and Noah Beery Sr. as Sergeant Gonzales. This film depiction includes Don Diego&#x27;s mother, Isabella, but it omits Bernardo (Don Diego&#x27;s mute servant). That 1920 feature introduced Zorro&#x27;s iconic all-black costume, subsequently incorporated into Johnston McCulley&#x27;s later Zorro stories in his original fiction series upon which Fairbanks&#x27; film had been based. The 1920 film was the first in a popular array of swashbuckler action features starring the acrobatic Fairbanks, who had previously appeared mainly in comedies. Clips from the film were inc
orporated into &quot;The Artist&quot; nine decades later.

Acknowledging that director Mamoulian&#x27;s 1940 version is a remake of the Douglas Fairbanks&#x27; 1920 swashbuckler, film critic Todd Wiener observes:

==Batman connection==
In the DC Comics continuity, &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; was established as the film that the eight-year-old Bruce Wayne had seen with his parents, Thomas and Martha, at a movie theater, only moments before they were killed in front of him by an armed thug (later retconned to be Joe Chill). Zorro is often portrayed as Bruce&#x27;s childhood hero and an influence on his Batman persona. Discrepancies exist regarding which version Bruce saw: &quot;The Dark Knight Returns&quot; claims it was the Tyrone Power version, whereas a story by Alan Grant claimed it to be the silent Douglas Fairbanks original. Bill Finger was himself inspired by Fairbanks&#x27; Zorro, including similarities in costumes, the &quot;Bat Cave&quot; and Zorro&#x27;s cave, and unexpected secret identities, especially since the Batman character antedates the Tyrone Power remake by a year. In &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot; (set in the DCEU continuity), Bruce and his parents leave a screening of 1940&#x27;s &quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; the night of their murder.

==Home media==
&quot;The Mark of Zorro&quot; has been released twice on DVD. The first was on October 7, 2003, and featured the film in its original black-and-white, as part of 20th Century Fox Studio Classics Collection. The second was released on October 18, 2005, as a Special Edition, featuring both a newly restored black-and-white version and a colorized version, prepared by Legend Films. Both contain the short film &quot;Tyrone Power: The Last Idol&quot; as seen on &quot;Biography&quot; on the A&amp;E Network, with a commentary by film critic Richard Schickel. Kino Lorber released the film on Blu-ray in 2016.

<text>Lonato del Garda (before 1 July 2007 simply Lonato; , ) is a town and municipality () in the province of Brescia, in Lombardy, northern Italy. Lonato is located about halfway between Milan and Venice, on the southwest shore of Lake Garda, the biggest lake in Italy.

Neighbouring communities are Castiglione delle Stiviere, Desenzano del Garda, Calcinato, Bedizzole, Calvagese della Riviera, Padenghe sul Garda, Pozzolengo, Montichiari, Solferino. The town is a holiday destination due to its scenic lakeside location about from the lake and its numerous historical and artistic monuments and museums, prehistoric sites (pile dwellings), Roman ruins, Medieval castle, Baroque churches and modern museums.

==History==

The town lies on the landscape of Morenic Hill, on the southwest side of Lake Garda. Here the first human settlements appeared in the Bronze Age on pile dwellings, as testified by archaeological findings in the areas of Polada and Lavagnone. The name Lonato is believed from some scholars to derive from the Celtic term &quot;Lona&quot; meaning little lake.

In the imperial Roman time, Lonato was crossed by the Basilica Emilia way, which used to connect Gaul with Aquileia. Roman ruins were found in the area of Monte Mario and Pozzo (Waiting for Godot).

The town was destroyed in the year 909 by the Hungarians, after which a new castle was built and the town fortified. In the following centuries Lonato was destroyed and rebuilt various times. In 1512 King Louis XII of France established his headquarters here when he invaded Italy. In 1516 Lonato become part of the Venetian Republic, until Napoleon arrived in 1796, when he fought and beat the Austrians during the first Italian campaign. In 1859 the town was part of the Italian Kingdom. During World War I the &quot;basso Garda&quot; defensive line was built, while in World War II it was a training centre for the X MAS.

The coat of arms is a lion rampant turned on the left side, with two golden keys grasped by the front legs. In 1509, King Louis XII of France granted to Lonato the honour to enrich the coat of arm with the three lilies of France, in gratitude for the favors that Lonato&#x27;s community offered him.

Lonato received the honorary title of city with a presidential decree on November 21, 1996.

==Main sights==
Around the main square, called Piazza Martiri della libertà, there is the town hall, the Venetian column, the Cathedral of San Giovanni Battista, and the Civic Tower (or Clock Tower).

Outside the centre of town there are Roman ruins of Fornaci, the Abbazia di Maguzzano, Drugolo Castle, the churches of Madonna di San Martino, San Cipriano, and pieve di San Zeno.

The &quot;House of the Podestà&quot; was built in the second half of the 15th century as seat of the representative of Venetian Republic, who controlled the region for more than 350 years (1441–1796). Only briefly, was Lonato under Mantuan rule under Francesco II Gonzaga (1509–1516).

After Napoleon Bonaparte granted the Venetian domains to the Austrians, the Podestà House was used by the Austrians as barracks; later it became a property of the comune of Lonato, under which it fell into disrepair.

The building was auctioned in public in 1906, and bought by Ugo da Como and his wife Maria Glisenti, who, conscious of the historical importance, called the architect A. Tagliaferri to restore it. As was fashionable in his time, they furnished the house, and today the extensive collections, including the library, 405 incunabula (one of the most important collection in Italy), 470 manuscripts and rare illuminated codes, parchments and prints. It also contains one of the smallest books in the world, 15x9 mm, which reproduces the letter by Galileo Galilei to Cristina di Lorena. In addition, it holds manuscripts letters by Ugo Foscolo to his lover Marzia Martinengo, written in 1807–1809.

The &quot;Rocca of Lonato&quot; surmounts a hill dominating the southern side of Lake Garda. The southern slope shelters the historical centre of Lonato, the limits of which, today, borders the Padana lowlands.

The fortification&#x27;s irregular form reveals a central structure almost 180 meters in length and approximately 45 metres in width. It is composed of two structures at different levels: the Rocca in the upper part and, lower down, what is called the General Quarters. Despite the long domination by the Visconti and Scaligeri families, the walled embankment, built in large morenic rocks, carries Guelph merlons.

In all probability, Lonato&#x27;s castle was first built around the year 1000 when fortifications were raised around the area against the invasion of the barbarians. Its architectural design closely follows the standards of the 15th and 16th centuries when it was rebuilt by the Visconti family of Milan.

After passing from the Gonzaga domination to Venice, then back to the Gonzaga and again to Venice, the castle passed to the Austrian Empire and finally to private hands. The military base was demolished and the internal and external surface was transformed into agricultural land. In 1912 the castle was declared a national monument; it was bought by Senator Ugo da Como in 1920 who partly restored it, and since 1996 it houses the Museo Civico Ornitologico, conferences, weddings and theatral shows.

The Museo Civico Ornitologico (Museum of Birds) is located inside the castle and contains more than 700 specimens. The species represented are from the area of Lake Garda but also of exotic origin, together with specimens with rarities, unique characteristics and plumage anomalies.

The Duomo (Cathedral) of San Giovanni Battista (St. John the Baptist) dates from the 19th century. It is an example of Baroque architecture, designed by the Lonato architect Paolo Sorattini and built during the second half of the 18th century. Its balanced cupola (20 meters of diameter and 60 meters high) and facade soberly decorated with marble are the basilica&#x27;s most notable points. The Baroque interior is enriched with frescoes and altar pieces by Venetian artists such as Antonio Balestra and Giambettino Cignaroli.

The civic tower (1555) is high and it has a clock of the 1773 with an original counterbalance mechanism.

The &quot;Fornaci Romane&quot; (Roman Furnaces) is an archeological site south of Lonato, in Gorghi. Six Roman brickworks were recently found and restored. The brickworks have circular shape with a firing chamber built using a technique with casts of pebbles stuck together with mortar. The ruins seems to indicate that this location was an important industrial center between the 1st and 2nd century AD.

<doc id="1087249" wikidata="Q5397861" url="?curid=1087249" title="J. J. Walsh">
<text>James Joseph Walsh (20 February 1880 – 3 February 1948), generally referred to as J. J. Walsh, was Postmaster General, (later Minister for Posts and Telegraphs) of the Irish Free State from 1923 to 1927. He was also a senior Gaelic Athletic Association organiser and Cumann na nGaedheal politician. Later, Walsh had heavy connections with fascism, including his association with Ailtirí na hAiséirghe.

==Early years==
J. J. Walsh was born in the townland of Rathroon, near Bandon, County Cork. His family came from a farming background, &quot;working a substantial holding of medium but well-cultivated land&quot;. Until the age of fifteen, Walsh attended a local school in Bandon, but by his own account &quot;as far as learning went, I may as well have been at home&quot;. Together with his school-friend P. S. O&#x27;Hegarty, he passed the Civil Service exams for the Postal service. He later worked locally as a clerk in the Post Office. Like O&#x27;Hegarty, he spent three years in London at King&#x27;s College, studying for the Secretary&#x27;s Office &quot;a syllabus (which) differed little from the Indian Civil Service&quot;. While O&#x27;Hegarty succeeded in his studies, Walsh did not, and returned to Cork where a friend, Sir Edward Fitzgerald, arranged work for him on the Entertainments Committee of the Cork International Exhibition.

==Sport==
Walsh was active in the Gaelic Athletic Association, promoting Gaelic games in many areas, but particularly in Cork city and county. His interest in organised sports had a strong political dimension.
 I happened to be one of those who realised the potentialities of the G.A.A. as a training ground for Physical Force. Contamination with the alien and all his works was taboo. I gathered around me a force of youthful enthusiasts from the University, Civil Service and Business. With this intensely organised instrument, war was declared on foreign games which were made to feel the shock so heavily that one by one, Soccer and Rugby Clubs began to disappear.
He was also instrumental in establishing the &#x27;revived&#x27; Tailteann Games.

He was Chairman of the Cork County Council GAA.

==Politics==
He was involved of the founding of the Cork City Irish Volunteers.

He participated in the Easter Rising in 1916 in the GPO. He claims he was responsible for mobilising 20 members of the Hibernian Rifles and took them to the GPO. However Rifles commandant John J. Scollan contradicts this account. He was promoted from Rifleman to Vice-Commandant of the Hibernian Rifles in 1915.

He was arrested following the general surrender and sentenced to death after a court-martial at Richmond Barracks. This was almost immediately commuted to life imprisonment, but he was released the following year under a general amnesty.

In later 1917 he was arrested and imprisoned after making a speech declaring &quot;the only way to address John Bull is through the barrel of a rifle&quot;.

In autumn 1919 he was involved in a failed assassination attempt on Lord French.

Walsh was elected as a Sinn Féin Member of Parliament (MP) in the 1918 general election for the Cork City constituency. As a member of the 1st Dáil he was arrested for partaking in an illegal government. He was released in 1921 and supported the Anglo-Irish Treaty and went on to become a founding member of the new political party, Cumann na nGaedheal. Walsh served as Postmaster General from 1922 until 1924 and joined the cabinet of W. T. Cosgrave between 1924 and 1927, after the office was reconstituted as the Department of Posts and Telegraphs. He was elected at every election for the Cork Borough constituency until 1927 when he retired from government.

In August 1922 he was part of a government committee which was intended to consider what the Irish Free State&#x27;s policy towards North-east Ulster would be.

During World War II, known at the time in Ireland as &quot;the Emergency&quot;, Walsh&#x27;s connections with fascism, including his association with Ailtirí na hAiséirghe, brought him to the attention of the Directorate of Intelligence (G2), the Intelligence branch of the Irish Army. Their request to the Minister for Justice, Gerald Boland, to place a tap on Walsh&#x27;s phone was, however, refused. He was closely associated with Irish-based pro-Nazi initiatives through his association with Ailtirí na hAiséirghe, during World War II, frequently expressing his views with anti-semitic rhetoric.

In 1944 he published a short memoir, &#x27;Recollections of a Rebel&#x27;.

On Sunday 24 April 2016 a plaque commemorating J.J. Walsh was unveiled in Kilbrittain.

<text>Gegeen Khan (Mongolian: Гэгээн хаан; Mongol script: ; &quot;Shidebal Gegegen qaγan&quot;; ), born Shidibala (; 碩德八剌), also known by his temple name as the Emperor Yingzong of Yuan (; February 22, 1302 – September 4, 1323), was an emperor of the Yuan dynasty of China. Apart from Emperor of China, he is regarded as the ninth Great Khan of the Mongol Empire, although it was only nominal due to the division of the empire. His personal name &quot;Shidibala&quot; was termed from Sanskrit &quot;Siddhipāla&quot; () meaning &#x27;protector of the advanced state of supernatural perfection&#x27; (referring to the Buddhist concept of Siddhi) and his regnal name &quot;Gegeen Khan&quot; means &quot;enlightened/bright khan&quot; in the Mongolian language.

Early in his short reign, the Khunggirat faction played a key role in the Yuan court. When his grandmother Dagi (Targi) and the grand councillor Temuder died in 1322, his opponents seemed to have triumphed. Despite the Emperor&#x27;s aim to reform the government based on the Confucian principles, Temuder&#x27;s faction linked up with the Alan guard and assassinated the emperor in 1323. This was the first violent transition struggle in the Yuan dynasty&#x27;s history, which is also known as the Coup d&#x27;état at Nanpo (南坡之變), that an emperor was overthrown by a group led by a non-Borjigin.

==Peaceful succession==
Prince Shidibala was the eldest son of Ayurbarwada Buyantu Khan (Emperor Renzong) and Radnashiri of the Khunggirad clan. In return for his own crown princeship, Ayurbarwada promised his elder brother Khayishan to appoint Khayishan&#x27;s son as Crown Prince after his succession. But when Khayishan died, Khayishan&#x27;s two sons were relegated to borderlands and pro-Khayishan officers were purged.

Shidibala&#x27;s powerful grandmother Dagi installed Shidibala as Crown Prince in 1316, and then as Khan, since he was mothered by a Khunggirad khatun. He was made the nominal head of both the Secretariat and the Bureau of Military Affairs one year later. At one time, his father Ayurbarwada had even toyed with the idea of abdicating the throne in favor of Shidebala. Dagi&#x27;s protégé Temuder was made as tutor to the heir apparent, Shidibala, after he failed to increase tax revenue.

Between Ayurbarwada&#x27;s death in March 1320 and his own death in October 1322, Temüder attained a great power with the full support of Dagi. Immediately after her grandson&#x27;s succession, Dagi reinstated Temüder as Minister of the Secretariat and took politics into her own hands more openly than during Ayurbarwada&#x27;s reign.

==Puppet regime==
As Gegeen Khan, Prince Shidibala succeeded his father on April 19, 1320. Empress Targi (Dagi) reappointed Temuder senior grand councillor. While Temuder&#x27;s persecution of his opponents in the censorate alienated the new Emperor, Temuder remained in power until his death, which came only two years later.

The return to power of Temudar was signalised by fresh excesses, and by the execution of several of those whom he suspected of having been the cause of his late trial. At length the young prince began to feel the leading strings of the Empress Dowager and Temudar rather irksome, and determined to speed on his inauguration.

From the beginning of his reign, Shidebala showed a political independence and resolution beyond his years. In a masterly move to counter the influence of the grand empress dowager and Temüder, Gegeen appointed the 21-year-old Baiju, a Jalayir and grandson of Antong, who had illustrious family background and good Confucian education, as the grand councillor of the left in the summer of 1320, which gave Shidabala several political advantages. Temuder was on the high-road to the attainment of supreme power when Baiju. However, Baiju, the commander of the kheshig, who was descended from Muqali, the renowned general of Genghis Khan, and was a man of high character, gained great influence over the Emperor, and displaced that of Temuder.

Gegeen Khan, the young emperor, however, did not sit with folded hands. The throne soon became the focus of loyalty for the Confucian scholar-officials in their struggle against the powerful Temüder. Gegeen was prepared for such a role, for he had been as well educated in Chinese as his father had been. Deeply affected by Confucianism as well as by Buddhism, Gegeen could cite Tang poems from memory and also was a creditable calligrapher.

Besides Confucianism, Gegeen was also devoted to Buddhism. In 1321 Shidbala built a Buddhist temple in honor of &#x27;Phags-pa Lama on the mountains west of Dadu, and when the censors reproached him he had several of them put to death; among them a very distinguished officer, named Soyaoelhatimichi, whose ancestors had been faithful dependents of the Mongol Imperial house. On the other hand, Islam suffered particularly severe discrimination during his reign. It is said that the Emperor destroyed a temple built by the Muslims, at Shangdu, and prohibited them from buying slaves from the Mongols and selling them again to the Chinese.

The growing influence of Baiju greatly disgusted Temuder. Baiju went to Liau tung to put up a monument to his ancestors. Temudar thought this a favourable opportunity of regaining his influence at the Yuan court, and presented himself at the palace, but was refused admittance, and died shortly after that. The Empress, Dagi (Targi), died about the same time in 1322–23.

He continued his father&#x27;s policy, ordering the abolition of government offices made during Khubilai&#x27;s reign. He also enforced a stricter discipline in government administration.

==Self-assertion==
In 1322, the deaths of Dagi and Temüder enabled him to seize full power. He was able to dismantle the Khunggirad faction from the Gegeen-led new administration. The severe suppression of the powerful faction including the deprivation of Temüder&#x27;s titles and estates, the execution of his son drove it into the corner. On the other hand, he appointed Baiju as the grand councillor of the right. As the sole grand councillor throughout the rest of Gegeen&#x27;s reign, Baiju became a powerful ally of Gegeen. They eliminated many offices subordinate to the personal establishments of the empress dowager and the empress. The increasing influence of Neo-Confucianism saw greater limits placed on Mongol women who were allowed to move about more freely in public.

Soon after becoming his own master and with the help of Baiju, Gegeen Khan began to reform the government based on the Confucian principles, continued his father Ayurbarwada&#x27;s policies for active promoting Chinese cultures. He and Baiju recruited for the government a great number of Chinese scholar-officials, many of whom had resigned when Temüder was in power. Heading of this list, Zhang Gui, a veteran administrator, was reappointed manager of governmental affairs and became Baiju&#x27;s chief partner in carrying out reforms. Apart from the three elderly scholars appointed as councilors to the Secretariat, seven famous scholars were appointed to the Hanlin Academy. It was approximately at this same time that the Da Yuan Tong Zhi (大元通制, &quot;the comprehensive institutions of the Great Yuan&quot;), a huge collection of codes and regulations of the Yuan dynasty began by his father, was revised in order to rationalize the administration and facilitate the dispensation of justice.

Furthermore, to relieve the labour burdens of small landowners, Gegeen&#x27;s administration stipulated that landowners set aside a certain proportion of the lands registered under their ownership from which revenues could be collected to cover corvée expenses.

==Death==
Regardless of the merits of Shidebala&#x27;s reign, it came to a tragic end on September 4, 1323, known as the &quot;Coup d&#x27;état at Nanpo&quot;. A plot was formed among Temuder&#x27;s supporters, who were afraid of vengeance overtaking them. It was headed by Temüder&#x27;s adopted son Tegshi. Besides the high-ranking officials, five princes were involved: Altan Bukha, the younger brother of the former prince of An-si, Ananda, who was executed by Ayurbarwada&#x27;s faction; and Bolad, a grandson of Ariq Böke; Yerutömör, a son of Ananda; Kulud Bukha; and Ulus Bukha, a descendant of Möngke Khan.

When Gegeen stayed at Nanpo on his way from the summer palace Shangdu to the capital Dadu of the Yuan dynasty, Gegeen and Bayiju were assassinated by Tegshi, who attacked Gegeen&#x27;s Ordo with Asud guards and other soldiers under him. Tegshi asked Yesün Temür to succeed the throne, but Yesün Temür purged Tegshi&#x27;s faction before he entered Dadu because he feared to become a puppet of it.

Gegeen&#x27;s reign was short; his direct rule lasted only for a year after Dagi&#x27;s death. But he was glorified in Chinese records since he and his father, aided by their sinicized Mongolian ministers and Chinese scholar-officials, had made vigorous efforts to transform further the Yuan along traditional Confucian lines. From that point of view, Gegeen&#x27;s assassination was sometimes explained as the struggle between the pro-Confucian faction and the opposite steppe elite faction, for Yesün Temür Khan had ruled Mongolia before succession and his policies appeared relatively unfavorable for Chinese officials.

His marriage to Sugabala, produced no children to succeed him.

<text>A Pictish stone is a type of monumental stele, generally carved or incised with symbols or designs. A few have ogham inscriptions. Located in Scotland, mostly north of the Clyde-Forth line and on the Eastern side of the country, these stones are the most visible remaining evidence of the Picts and are thought to date from the 6th to 9th century, a period during which the Picts became Christianized. The earlier stones have no parallels from the rest of the British Isles, but the later forms are variations within a wider Insular tradition of monumental stones such as high crosses. About 350 objects classified as Pictish stones have survived, the earlier examples of which holding by far the greatest number of surviving examples of the mysterious symbols, which have long intrigued scholars.

==Classification==

In &quot;The Early Christian Monuments of Scotland&quot; (1903) J Romilly Allen and Joseph Anderson first classified Pictish stones into three groups. Critics have noted weaknesses in this system but it is widely known and still used in the field. In particular, the classification may be misleading for the many incomplete stones. Allen and Anderson regarded their classes as coming from distinct periods in sequence, but it is now clear that there was a considerable period when both Class I and II stones were being produced.

*Class I — unworked stones with symbols only incised. There is no cross on either side. Class I stones date back to the 6th, 7th and 8th century.
*Class II — stones of more or less rectangular shape with a large cross and symbol(s) on one or both sides. The symbols, as well as Christian motifs, are carved in relief and the cross with its surroundings is filled with designs. Class II stones date from the 8th and 9th century.
*Class III — these stones feature no idiomatic Pictish symbols. The stones can be cross-slabs, recumbent gravemarkers, free-standing crosses, and composite stone shrines. They originate in the 8th or 9th century. Historic Scotland describes this class as &quot;too simplistic&quot; and says &quot;Nowadays this is not considered a useful category. A surviving fragment may belong to a monument that did include Christian imagery&quot;.

Later Scottish stones merge into wider medieval British and European traditions.

==Purpose and meaning==

The purpose and meaning of the stones are only slightly understood, and the various theories proposed for the early Class I symbol stones, those that are considered to mostly pre-date the spread of Christianity to the Picts, are essentially speculative.

Many later Christian stones from Class II and Class III fall more easily into recognisable categories such as gravestones. The earlier symbol stones may have served as personal memorials or territorial markers, with symbols for individual names, clans, lineages or kindreds, although there are several other theories, and proposed explanations of the meanings of the symbols.

===Standard ideograms===

Class I and II stones contain symbols from a recognisable set of standard ideograms, many unique to Pictish art, which are known as the Pictish symbols. The exact number of distinct Pictish symbols is uncertain, as there is some debate as to what constitutes a Pictish symbol, and whether some varied forms should be counted together or separately. The more inclusive estimates are in excess of sixty different symbols, but a more typical estimate is &quot;around thirty&quot;, or &quot;around forty&quot; according to Historic Scotland.

These include geometric symbols, which have been assigned descriptive names by researchers such as:
* &quot;crescent&quot;
* &quot;V-rod&quot;
* &quot;double disc and Z-rod&quot;
* &quot;mirror and comb&quot;
* &quot;triple disc&quot;
and outline representations of animals such as:
* adder
* salmon
* wolf
* stag
* eagle
* Pictish Beast (apparently mythical – perhaps intended as a sea monster)

Some are representations of everyday objects, such as the &quot;mirror and comb&quot;, which could have been used by high-status Picts. The symbols are almost always arranged in pairs or sets of pairs, often with the object type, such as the mirror and comb, below the others, and the animals are generally found only in combination with the abstract types. Hence some think they could represent names, lineage, or kinships, such as the clans of two parents, analogous to the Japanese mon. According to Anthony Jackson the symbol pairs represent matrilineal marriage alliances.

===Finds and associations===
A small number of Pictish stones have been found associated with burials, but most are not in their original locations. Some later stones may also have marked tribal or lineage territories. Some were re-used for other purposes, such as the two Congash Stones near Grantown-on-Spey, now placed as portal stones for an old graveyard. The shaft of an old cross is lying in the field.

Another Pictish stone, the Dunachton Stone near Kincraig, was later used as a door lintel in a barn. This was discovered when the building was dismantled in 1870. The stone was re-erected in the field. Recently it fell, after being photographed in 2007, but was re-erected again a few years later by the owner of Dunachton Lodge.

The symbols are found on some of the extremely rare survivals of Pictish jewellery, such as the pair of silver plaques from the Norrie&#x27;s Law hoard found in Fife in the early 19th century, 
and the Whitecleuch Chain.

The symbols are also sometimes found on other movable objects like small stone discs and bones mostly from the Northern Isles. Simple or early forms of the symbols are carved on the walls of coastal caves at East Wemyss, Fife and Covesea, Moray. It is therefore thought likely that they were represented in other more perishable forms that have not survived in the archaeological record, perhaps including clothing and tattoos. Some symbols appear across the whole geographical range of the stones while, for example, six stones with the single symbol of a bull found at Burghead Fort suggest that this represented the place itself, or its owners, despite other examples appearing elsewhere.

===Exeter analysis===
A team from Exeter University, using mathematical analysis, have concluded that the symbols in the Pictish image stones &quot;exhibit the characteristics of written languages&quot; (as opposed to &quot;random or sematographic (heraldic) characters&quot;).

The Exeter analysts&#x27; claim has been criticized by linguists Mark Liberman and Richard Sproat on the grounds that the non-uniform distribution of symbols – taken to be evidence of writing – is little different from non-linguistic non-uniform distributions (such as die rolls), and that the Exeter team are using a definition of writing broader than that used by linguists.

To date, even those who propose that the symbols should be considered &quot;writing&quot; from this mathematical approach do not have a suggested decipherment. Although earlier studies based on a contextual approach, postulating the identification of the pagan &quot;pre-Christian Celtic Cult of the Archer Guardian&quot;, have suggested possible clausal meanings for symbol pairs.

==Gallery of symbols==
A selection of the Pictish symbols, showing the variation between individual examples. Each group is classified as a single type by most researchers. Only the geometric and object types are represented here, not the animal group.
==Distribution and sites==
Only a few stones still stand at their original sites; most have been moved to museums or other protected sites. Some of the more notable individual examples and collections are listed below (Note that listing is no guarantee of unrestricted access, since some lie on private land). Pictish Symbol stones have been found throughout Scotland, although their original locations are concentrated largely in the North East of the country in lowland areas, the Pictish heartland. During the period when the stones were being created, Christianity was spreading through Scotland from the west and the south, through the kingdoms of Dál Riata, which included parts of Ireland, and the extension into modern Scotland of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Bernicia and Northumbria.

Areas that show particular concentrations include Strathtay, Strathmore, coastal Angus, Fife, Strathdee, Garioch, Moray, Strathspey, Caithness, Easter Ross, the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland. 

Three stones with Pictish symbols are known outside areas normally recognised as Pictish: in Dunadd, Argyll; Trusty&#x27;s Hill in Dumfries and Galloway; and Edinburgh in Lothian. All three are located at major royal power centres.

Two Pictish Class I stones are known to have been removed from Scotland. These are Burghead 5 from Burghead Fort in Moray, showing the figure of a bull, now in the British Museum, and the Crosskirk stone (Caithness), presented to the King of Denmark in the 19th century, but whose location is currently unknown.

<text>James FitzGerald-Kenney (1 January 1878 – 21 October 1956) was an Irish Fine Gael politician and barrister who served as Minister for Justice from 1927 to 1932. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Mayo South constituency from 1927 to 1944.

==Biography==
He was born at his mother&#x27;s family home in Clogher, near Claremorris, County Mayo. He was the second son of James Fitzgerald-Kenney of Galway and Helena Crean-Lynch. He was educated at Clongowes Wood College and University College Dublin, where he took his degree in 1898. He was called to the Bar in 1899 and built up a large practice on the Western Circuit. He was called to the Inner Bar in 1925.

In politics, he was until 1918 a supporter of John Redmond; he joined the Irish Volunteers in 1914 and became an inspecting officer for South Mayo. After the split within the Volunteers in late 1914 over whether to serve with the British Army in World War I or not, FitzGerald-Kenney aligned with the Redmondite National Volunteers who opted in favour of doing so. 

==Political career==
In June 1927, he was elected as a Cumann na nGaedheal TD for Mayo South and became parliamentary secretary to acting Minister for Justice W. T. Cosgrave. Following the assassination of Kevin O’Higgins, he was appointed Minister for Justice on October 11, 1927, a position he held until 1932. His appointment as a minister after only a few months in parliament caused a surprise, and as the least experienced cabinet member, he often became the focus of opposition criticism and struggled with parliamentary duties. Unlike O&#x27;Higgins, he allowed Eoin O&#x27;Duffy complete discretion as to how he ran the police force. He occasionally invited ridicule in his willingness to defend O&#x27;Duffy: his claim that a victim of Garda brutality had been knocked down by a cow led to a brief fashion for referring to Gardaí as &quot;Fitzgerald-Kenney&#x27;s cows&quot;.

When the Four Courts, which had been badly damaged during the Irish Civil War, reopened in 1931, he firmly vetoed the proposal by the Chief Justice of Ireland Hugh Kennedy to hold a formal ceremony to mark the occasion, on the ground that it would virtually amount to an invitation to extremists to attack the building again.

Following the merger of Cumann na nGaedheal with the National Centre Party and the Army Comrades Association (better known as the Blueshirts) to form Fine Gael in September 1933, he lost his front bench seat. He was involved with the Blueshirts and led its youth section. 

After losing in the 1944 general election, he declined a nomination to Seanad Éireann by the bar council and chose to retire from politics to focus on his legal career and spent his remaining years farming at Clogher which he inherited from his mother. 

==Personal life==
A dedicated supporter of the Irish language, Fitzgerald-Kenney was a pioneering member of the Gaelic League in Mayo, where he established and chaired the local branch. He also had a passion for shooting and golf. In addition to his political and legal careers, he managed the large estate at Clogher House, Mayo, which he inherited from his mother in 1903. 

FitzGerald-Kenney died on 21 October 1956, in a Dublin nursing home, leaving an estate valued at £3,713. He never married, and his papers are preserved in the James Hardiman Library at the National University of Ireland, Galway.
