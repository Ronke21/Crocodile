<text>Ian Murray Revell (born 7 February 1948) is a former New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1990 to 1999, representing the National Party. Before entering politics, Revell was a senior detective in the New Zealand Police.

== Member of Parliament ==

He was first elected to Parliament in the 1990 election as MP for Birkenhead, defeating the incumbent Jenny Kirk of the Labour Party. He remained MP for Birkenhead until the seat was abolished in the 1996 election, when he successfully stood for the new Northcote electorate. In the 1999 election, he was defeated by Labour&#x27;s Ann Hartley by less than 300 votes. As he was not on National&#x27;s party list, he left Parliament.

== After politics ==
He now works as a Senior Sales Consultant for Prestige Realty and has been the recipient of the Top Salesperson Award for 2006 and 2007. Revell primarily works on Auckland&#x27;s North Shore, based in Takapuna.

Revell was formerly the patron of the Monarchist League of New Zealand, but resigned in favour of Sir Peter Tapsell in 2000 soon after leaving Parliament.

At the 2016 Auckland elections, Revell stood for the Takapuna-Devonport local board, as part of Team George Wood. He finished eighth, and was not elected to the board.

<doc id="1114454" wikidata="Q1370493" url="?curid=1114454" title="Lloyd Cole">
<text>Lloyd Cole (born 31 January 1961) is an English singer, songwriter and musician. He was lead vocalist of Lloyd Cole and the Commotions from 1984 to 1989 and subsequently worked solo.

== Early life ==
Cole was born in Buxton, Derbyshire, England. He grew up in nearby Chapel-en-le-Frith and went to New Mills Comprehensive School and later attended Runshaw College in Leyland, Lancashire. He studied a year of law at University College London but switched to the University of Glasgow, where he studied philosophy and English, and also met the future members of the Commotions.

== Career ==
=== 1984–1989: Lloyd Cole and the Commotions ===
The Commotions&#x27; debut studio album, &quot;Rattlesnakes&quot; (1984), contained literary and pop culture references to such figures as Arthur Lee, Norman Mailer, Grace Kelly, Eva Marie Saint, Simone de Beauvoir, Truman Capote and Joan Didion. The band produced two more studio albums, &quot;Easy Pieces&quot; (1985) and &quot;Mainstream&quot; (1987), before disbanding in 1989.

Songs by the band include &quot;Perfect Skin&quot;, &quot;Rattlesnakes&quot;, &quot;Forest Fire&quot;, &quot;Are You Ready to Be Heartbroken?&quot;, &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; and &quot;Jennifer She Said&quot;. Cole subsequently relocated to New York City and recorded with various musicians, including Fred Maher, Robert Quine and Matthew Sweet.

=== 1990–1992: &quot;Lloyd Cole&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Weird on Me Babe&quot; ===
This solo setting produced two studio albums, &quot;Lloyd Cole&quot; in 1990 – preceded by the single &quot;No Blue Skies&quot; – and &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Weird on Me Babe&quot; in 1991. The latter was recorded in two parts: one side continued the New York rock of his debut solo studio album, while the other side featured a session orchestra, much in the style of Burt Bacharach or Scott Walker. While he remained with Polydor as his record label, the US distribution contract with Capitol Records ended. (US rights were picked up by Rykodisc.) &quot;She&#x27;s a Girl and I&#x27;m a Man&quot;, &quot;Weeping Wine&quot; and &quot;Butterfly&quot; were released as singles.

&quot;Downtown&quot; (from &quot;Lloyd Cole&quot;, 1990) was featured in the American psychological thriller film &quot;Bad Influence&quot; (1990) – starring Rob Lowe and James Spader – while &quot;Pay for It&quot; (from &quot;Don&#x27;t Get Weird on Me Babe&quot;, 1991) was on the soundtrack of &quot;When the Party&#x27;s Over&quot;, starring Sandra Bullock.

=== 1993–1999: &quot;Bad Vibes&quot;, &quot;Love Story&quot; and &quot;The Collection&quot; ===

Cole recorded &quot;Bad Vibes&quot; in 1993, a collaboration with producer and remixer Adam Peters, using a harder sound. &quot;So You&#x27;d Like to Save the World&quot; and &quot;Morning Is Broken&quot; were released as singles.

&quot;Love Story&quot; (1995) was recorded with the help of Stephen Street (who has worked with Blur and the Smiths) and former Commotion Neil Clark. It produced a minor hit with the song &quot;Like Lovers Do&quot;, affording Cole a mid-1990s appearance on &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;.

=== 2000–2009: &quot;The Negatives&quot;, &quot;Music in a Foreign Language&quot;, &quot;Antidepressant&quot; ===
In 1997 and 1998, Cole played with some New York musicians under the name the Negatives. The group consisted of Jill Sobule, Dave Derby of the Dambuilders, Mike Kotch and Rafa Maciejak, who recorded an eponymous CD, released mainly in Western Europe and North America. Songs from the album like &quot;Past Imperfect&quot;, &quot;Vin Ordinaire&quot; and &quot;No More Love Songs&quot; returned to Cole&#x27;s live sets regularly throughout his career.

In 2000, Cole took time out from recording to &quot;learn Macromedia Flash and build the first Lloyd Cole website.&quot; Macromedia Flash was a popular web authoring tool at that time. The official Lloyd Cole website has subsequently been redeveloped.

He has since released solo albums on smaller independent labels. Sanctuary Records released &quot;Music in a Foreign Language&quot; (2003) in the UK. Recorded largely by Cole himself (including tracks recorded directly onto a Mac), the songs had a stark, folk-inspired singer-songwriter style. The album was released in the US by the One Little Indian label, which also collected a number of outtakes (recorded from 1996 to 2000) on 2002&#x27;s &quot;Etc.&quot; and released an instrumental ambient electronica album, &quot;Plastic Wood&quot;, the same year. Cole has mentioned &quot;Music in a Foreign Language&quot; as his favourite studio album. It featured new versions of Nick Cave&#x27;s &quot;People Ain&#x27;t No Good&quot; and his own &quot;No More Love Songs&quot;. Both the title track and &quot;Late Night, Early Town&quot; became staples in his live sets.

In 2004, to mark the 20th anniversary of the release of &quot;Rattlesnakes&quot;, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions reformed to perform a one-off tour of the UK and Ireland. The reformation was never intended to be permanent, and Cole released another solo studio album in 2006, &quot;Antidepressant&quot;, using his usual home recording outfit by playing all the instruments himself with friends like Sobule, Derby and the guitar work of former Commotion Neil Clark on some tracks. The album included &quot;Woman in a Bar&quot; and &quot;The Young Idealists&quot; a.o. Cole has mentioned &quot;Rolodex Incident&quot; as a personal favourite.

In 2009, Cole released &quot;Cleaning Out the Ashtrays&quot; – a collection of outtakes, B-sides, rarities and alternative versions of his solo work. Notable cover versions include Leonard Cohen&#x27;s &quot;Chelsea Hotel #2&quot;, T. Rex&#x27;s &quot;The Children of the Revolution&quot; and Kris Kristofferson&#x27;s &quot;For the Good Times&quot;, which he recorded with Jill Sobule.

=== 2010–2018: &quot;Broken Record&quot;, &quot;Standards&quot; and &quot;Selected Studies Vol. 1&quot; ===

&quot;Broken Record&quot;, released in September 2010 preceded by the single &quot;Writer&#x27;s Retreat&quot;, marked a departure from his solo recordings, as it was performed by a band of longstanding friends and working partners, including Fred Maher, Joan As Police Woman, Rainy Orteca, Dave Derby and Blair Cowan – as well as two musicians, Matt Cullen (guitar; banjo) and Mark Schwaber (guitar; mandolin), with whom Cole tours, billed as &#x27;Lloyd Cole Small Ensemble&#x27;. The recording of the album was entirely financed by advance purchases by his fans and contributions from Tapete Records, which later distributed the album and also oversaw and negotiated the rights to release a boxed set with his complete collection of B-sides, alternative takes and previously unreleased material, under the title &quot;Cleaning Out the Ashtrays&quot;.

A further album co-funded by fans, &quot;Standards&quot;, was released in June 2013, and includes contributions from Fred Maher and Matthew Sweet, Blair Cowan (The Commotions) and Joan Wasser (a.k.a. Joan As Police Woman). It was preceded by the single and music video &quot;Period Piece&quot;. Other notable songs on the album were Cole&#x27;s re-make of John Hartford&#x27;s &quot;California Earthquake&quot;, &quot;Women&#x27;s Studies&quot; and favourite &quot;Myrtle and Rose&quot;. For the first time since 1999&#x27;s &quot;The Collection&quot;, Cole appeared on the UK Albums Chart for one week at position 74.

In February 2013 a new album of electronic music by Cole and Hans-Joachim Roedelius was released, called &quot;Selected Studies Vol. 1&quot;.

In 2016, Cole went on tour with the Leopards to celebrate the release of the &quot;Lloyd Cole and the Commotions Collected Recordings 1983–1988&quot; box set. Live album &quot;Lloyd Cole and the Leopards – Live at Brooklyn Bowl&quot; was released through his website along with several live recordings of shows he performed with his son William on guitar.

In early 2017 the single &quot;Man on the Verge&quot; was released as a taster for the &quot;Lloyd Cole in New York – Collected Recordings 1988–1996&quot; box set.

=== 2019–present: &quot;Guesswork&quot; and &quot;On Pain&quot; ===
Cole&#x27;s eleventh studio album &quot;Guesswork&quot; was released on 26 July 2019 by earMUSIC. Recorded (mostly) in his attic studio in Massachusetts, &quot;Guesswork&quot; was produced by Cole and mixed by German producer Olaf Opal, with executive production from Chris Hughes. The record was mastered by Kai Blankenberg at Skyline Tonfabrik in Düsseldorf. The electronic sounding album also featured contributions from a.o. Fred Maher and former Commotions Blair Cowan and Neil Clark. It was preceded by the singles &quot;Violins&quot; and &quot;Night Sweats&quot;.

In 2021, &quot;Cleaning Out the Ashtrays&quot; – the 2009 collection of outtakes, alternative versions of his solo work, and cover versions – was released digitally.

On 30 January 2023, Cole announced his twelfth studio album &quot;On Pain&quot; to be released on 23 June 2023. An album featuring eight songs recorded in Cole&#x27;s attic and produced by Chris Merrick Hughes. Four of the songs are co-written by founding Commotions members Blair Cowan and Neil Clark. It was preceded by the upbeat single and music video &quot;Warm by the Fire&quot;. It received 4-star reviews by &quot;Uncut&quot;, &quot;Mojo&quot; and AllMusic and it entered the UK Albums Chart at number 23.

Second single &quot;The Idiot&quot; - released on August 25 - is a homage to David Bowie&#x27;s and Iggy Pop&#x27;s friendship during their Berlin era in the late &#x27;70&#x27;s. According to CLASH Music the video for &quot;The Idiot&quot; is a touching vision of love and friendship, shot not in Berlin but in Toronto&#x27;s legendary Horseshoe Bar. Directed by Doug Arrowsmith and starring the dancers Kaelin Isserlin (as &#x27;David&#x27;) and Ryan Kostyniuk (as &#x27;Jim&#x27;). 

The first leg of the On Pain Tour kicked off in Newcastle on October 6, 2023 and finished in Amsterdam on November 6. The show consisted of a semi-acoustic part and an electric part, both performed with Commotions co-founders Blair Cowan and Neil Clark, and Icelandic drummer Signy Jakobsdottir.

The setlist featured songs from all over Lloyd&#x27;s and The Commotions&#x27; career and all his band and solo albums.

On December 8, 2023, the &quot;Wolves Disco and Boogaloo Remixes&quot; single was released, featuring &#x27;Wolves&#x27; remixes by Mogwai a.o.

MOJO Magazine listed &quot;On Pain&quot; at #42 in their best albums of 2023 Top 100, Classic Rock Magazine at #3.

== Live performances ==

In 2010, Cole formed a small ensemble consisting of American musicians Mark Schwaber and Matt Cullen and, in October and November of that year, completed a tour of Europe. Further tours of New Zealand and Australia and Europe followed in 2011. In autumn 2016, Cole undertook a short tour of the UK and Europe, titled &#x27;The Retrospective&#x27;, playing acoustic versions of songs written between 1983 and 1996.

In 2023 Lloyd took a four piece band on the road (including himself on bass), in support of his On Pain album. Starring Commotions co-founders Blair Cowan and Neil Clark, and Icelandic drummer Signy Jakobsdottir. The show consisted of a semi-acoustic part and an electric part.

<text>Katherine Victoria O&#x27;Regan (née Newton, 24 May 1946 – 2 May 2018) was a New Zealand politician. She was a member of parliament from 1984 to 1999, representing the National Party. She served as a minister for the National Government for six of those years.

==Early life==
Katherine Victoria Newton was born to farming parents at Te Mata, on the West Coast of the North Island and attended Hamilton Girls&#x27; High School. She chose a nursing career but left after two years due to suffering from back problems. After leaving nursing, O&#x27;Regan was involved in community organisations like the Plunket Society, SPELD (a non-profit organisation that supports people with dyslexia) and the Hamilton Speech Therapy Association.

==Political career==



O&#x27;Regan was a voting delegate for the National Party in the Raglan electorate candidate selection ahead of the 1975 election, where she supported Marilyn Waring. O&#x27;Regan would work for Waring as her electoral agent for eight years. She was elected to the Waipa County Council in 1977 and served as a county councillor for eight years; she was the first woman to be elected to the council. When Waring, then representing the Waipa electorate, retired from Parliament, O&#x27;Regan was selected as the new National Party candidate for the electorate in 1984. She held Waipa for twelve years until it was abolished in 1996.

=== In Opposition, 1984–1990 ===
The National Government was defeated at the 1984 election. On her entry to Parliament, O&#x27;Regan sought to highlight the plight of children with specific learning disabilities by introducing a private members bill seeking recognition by the education system of children with these disabilities. It was not successful, but the bill was carried over by the Labour Party in Government. It was finally discharged after 1990.

=== In Government, 1990–1999 ===
National regained the government benches in 1990. In the Fourth National Government, O&#x27;Regan was appointed as a Minister outside of Cabinet, as Minister of Consumer Affairs, Associate Minister of Health, Associate Minister of Social Welfare and Associate Minister of Women&#x27;s Affairs. These remained her portfolios until the 1996 election; she additionally served as Minister of Youth Affairs in 1996. As Associate Minister of Health, she amended the Human Rights Act to outlaw discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and having organisms in the body which might cause disease and established a free breast cancer screening programme.

In 1993, O&#x27;Regan was awarded the New Zealand Suffrage Centennial Medal. In 1994, O&#x27;Regan led the New Zealand Delegation to the United Nations Population and Development Conference in Cairo and also gave the Second Country Report to CEDAW at the United Nations in New York.

Ahead of the 1996 general election, the Waipa electorate was disestablished. O&#x27;Regan contested the Tauranga electorate against the former National Party MP for Tauranga, Winston Peters, who was contesting the electorate under his New Zealand First Party. O&#x27;Regan was unsuccessful in this election but remained in Parliament as a list MP. With the National Party forming a coalition government with New Zealand First, O&#x27;Regan did not continue as a minister and was instead appointed the Chairperson of the Internal Affairs select committee from 1996 to 1999. O&#x27;Regan continued her interest in population and development issues by establishing, with the help of Family Planning International, a New Zealand Parliamentarians&#x27; Group on Population and Development.

In the 1999 general election, she again challenged Peters, and came within 62 votes of defeating him—had she won, the New Zealand First party would have lost all parliamentary representation. Labour&#x27;s candidate Margaret Wilson, who came third in the electorate, requested a recount. The final result was a 63 votes majority for Peters. O&#x27;Regan attempted to oust Peters from the electorate by encouraging voters to vote tactically, and vote for her rather than Labour&#x27;s Wilson. However, Peters was re-elected but with a much reduced margin. Unlike in 1996, O&#x27;Regan was not high enough on National&#x27;s party list to remain in Parliament and thus retired from politics.

== Later career ==
In the 2002 Queen&#x27;s Birthday and Golden Jubilee Honours, O&#x27;Regan was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services.

She was the chair of the Te Awamutu Community Public Relations Organisation. She was Chair of the Human Ethics in Research Committee for eight years at Waikato Institute of Technology and served on the New Zealand Law Society Waikato/Bay of Plenty Complaints Committee.

==Political views==
O&#x27;Regan was a council member of Family Planning New Zealand. She favoured compulsory sex education from age ten and condom vending machines in all secondary schools and public toilets. In an obituary, her daughter Susan O&#x27;Regan described her mother as a Royalist, feminist, and strong believer in equal rights.

== Personal life ==
O&#x27;Regan has two children to her first husband Neil O&#x27;Regan, whom she married in 1968. The couple divorced; O&#x27;Regan married former National MP Michael Cox in 1992.

O&#x27;Regan was diagnosed, through the free screening programme she had established as Associate Minister of Health, with breast cancer in 2008. She died of her illness on 2 May 2018.

<text>Lloyd Cole and the Commotions were a British rock and pop band that formed in Glasgow, Scotland in 1982. Between 1984 and 1989, the band scored four Top 20 albums and five Top 40 singles in the UK; it also had success in several other countries including Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden and New Zealand. After they broke up in 1989, Cole embarked on a solo career but the band reformed briefly in 2004 to perform a 20th anniversary mini-tour of the UK and Ireland.

==Band history==
The band were formed whilst Cole (who was born in Derbyshire, England) was studying at the University of Glasgow. They signed a recording contract with Polydor Records; their debut single &quot;Perfect Skin&quot; reaching number 26 on the UK Singles Chart in spring 1984, while the second single &quot;Forest Fire&quot; reached 41. Their debut studio album, &quot;Rattlesnakes&quot;, was released in October 1984. Produced by Paul Hardiman and featuring string arrangements by Anne Dudley, it peaked at No. 13 in the UK and was certified gold for sales over 100,000 copies. &quot;NME&quot; included it in its Top 100 Albums of All Time list, and the title track was later covered by the American singer Tori Amos. The Welsh band Manic Street Preachers included the album amongst their top ten list.

The band&#x27;s follow-up studio album, &quot;Easy Pieces&quot;, was produced by Clive Langer and Alan Winstanley, who had previously produced for Madness, the Teardrop Explodes, Dexys Midnight Runners and Elvis Costello and the Attractions. Released in November 1985, the album was a quicker commercial success than its predecessor (entering the UK Albums Chart at No. 5, and certified gold within a month). The singles &quot;Brand New Friend&quot; and &quot;Lost Weekend&quot; were the band&#x27;s first and only UK top 20 hits (reaching No. 19 and No. 17 respectively).

Two years later, the band released their third and final studio album, &quot;Mainstream&quot;. Produced by Ian Stanley (former songwriter and keyboardist of Tears for Fears), the album peaked at No. 9 in the UK and was also certified gold, but contained only one UK top 40 single, &quot;Jennifer She Said&quot; (No. 31). Its first single &quot;My Bag&quot;, and a later release, the &quot;From the Hip&quot; EP, failed to make the top 40.

In 1989, the band decided to break up and released a &quot;best of&quot; compilation, &quot;1984–1989&quot;, which was their fourth top 20 album (UK No. 14) and fourth gold certification. Following this, Cole embarked on a solo career with the release of his eponymous debut studio album in 1990.

On the first two Commotions albums, Cole was the band&#x27;s principal songwriter (though he co-wrote several songs with various bandmembers). The third studio album is credited to the band as a whole.

During 2004, Lloyd Cole and the Commotions reunited for a month to celebrate the release of the &quot;Rattlesnakes&quot; deluxe edition. Rehearsals were in Glasgow and the band played to packed houses at the Barrowlands, and then in Dublin, Manchester and London.

<text>Pandit Mallikarjun Bheemaraayappa Mansur, (31 December 1910 12 September 1992) was a Hindustani classical singer from Karnataka. He sang in the khyal genre and belonged to the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana.

==Early life and background==
Mallikarjun was born on 31 December 1910, at Mansur, a village five kilometres west of Dharwad, Karnataka. According to his biography, he was born on an Amavasya day. His father, Bheemaraayappa, was the village headman, a farmer by occupation and an ardent lover and patron of music. He had four brothers and three sisters. His elder brother Basavaraj owned a theatre troupe, and thus at age nine Mallikarjun did a small role in a play.

Spotting the talent in his son, Mallikarjun&#x27;s father engaged him to a travelling Yakshagana (Kannada theatre) troupe. The owner of this troupe took a liking to the tender and melodious voice of Mallikarjun and encouraged him to sing different types of compositions during the drama-performances. Hearing one such performance, he was picked up by Appaya Swamy under whom he had his initial training in Carnatic music. Sometime later, he was introduced to Hindustani music under Nilkanth Bua Alurmath of Miraj who belonged to the Gwalior gharana. The latter brought him to Alladiya Khan (1855–1946), the stalwart and the then patriarch of the Jaipur-Atrauli gharana, in the late 1920s, who referred him to his elder son, Manji Khan. Following Manji Khan&#x27;s untimely death, he came under the tutelage of Manji Khan&#x27;s younger brother Bhurji Khan. This grooming under Bhurji Khan had the most important influence on his style of singing.

==Career==

Mansur was well known for his command over a large number of rare (&quot;aprachalit&quot;) ragas such as Shuddh Nat, Asa Jogiya, Hem Nat, Lachchhasakh, Khat, Shivmat Bhairav, Kabir Bhairav, Bihari, Sampoorna Malkauns, Lajawanti, Adambari Kedar, Ek Nishad Bihagda and Bahaduri Todi, as well as his constant, mercurial improvisations in both melody and metre without ever losing the emotional content of the song. Initially, his voice and style resembled that of Manji Khan and Narayanrao Vyas, but gradually he developed his own style of rendition.

He also remained music director with His Master&#x27;s Voice and later music advisor to All India Radio&#x27;s Dharwad station.

==Awards==
He received all three national Padma Awards:
*Padma Shri Award by the Government of India in 1970 
*Padma Bhushan Award by the Government of India in 1976. 
*Padma Vibhushan, the second highest civilian honour given Government of India in 1992. 
*In 1982, he was awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Fellowship, the highest honour conferred by the Sangeet Natak Akademi, India&#x27;s National Academy of Music, Dance &amp; Drama.
*Kalidas Samman Award by the Government of Madhya Pradesh.

==Books==
Mansur wrote an autobiographical book in his mother tongue Kannada, titled &quot;Nanna Rasayatre&quot; () in Kannada, which has been translated into English as a book titled &quot;My Journey in Music&quot; by his son, Rajshekhar Mansur.

==Personal life==
Mansur was married to Gangamma. He had seven daughters and a son, Rajashekhar Mansur. Amongst Mansur&#x27;s children, Rajashekhar and Neela Kodli are vocalists.

Mansur recovered from an illness after being in coma for two weeks in April 1992. On 12 September that year, he died after he developed breathing complications due to lung cancer, in Dharwad. He was given a state funeral.

==Legacy==
The residence of Mallikarjun Mansur, Mrutyunjaya, today houses a museum in his memory. The museum is managed by Dr. Mallikarjun Mansur National Memorial Trust functioning under the Department of Kannada and Culture, State Government of Karnataka. Every year the Trust organises a National Concert on 12 and 13 September to commemorate his death anniversary, with artists from his legacy performing in the morning at the museum and invited artists performing later in the evening. The Trust annually announces three awards on 31 December to commemorate his birth anniversary.

Indian documentary film director Nandan Kudhyadi made &quot;Rasayatra&quot; about the musician in 1994, it won the National Film Awards for Best Non-Feature Film, Best Non-Feature Film Cinematography, and Best Non-Feature Film Editing.

To mark his birth centenary, a three-day music festival was organised in Dharwad and Hubli from 1 to 3 January 2011, wherein singers from across India performed and performances were held at the Kariyamma Devi temple premises at his birthplace Mansur village. His ancestral home in Mansur was also converted into a memorial.

In 2013, a five audio CD collection, &quot;Akashvani Sangeet&quot; of his music including rare &quot;Vachana Gayana&quot; renditions, was released by All India Radio archives at a ceremony held at Srijana Rangamandir at the Karnatak College Dharwar campus.

In September 2014, a postage stamp featuring Mansur was released by India Post commemorating his contributions to music.

<text>Metheringham is a village and civil parish in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England. The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 3,605. It is about south of Lincoln and north of Sleaford. The centre of the village is a conservation area.

==History==
The village is a documented settlement in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 and is thought to date from Saxon times. It appears to be associated with the name &quot;Medrich&quot;. The addition of the plural ending &quot;-es&quot; together with the familiar &quot;-ham&quot; ending is thought to have produced &quot;Medrichesham&quot; (the homestead of Medrich), which in time became corrupted into the modern name of the village. The earliest surviving document relating specifically to the village dates from 24 June 1314, in the reign of Edward II. In July 1599, a great fire left only a few houses standing. It started in a gully that ran the length of the village street.

&quot;White&#x27;s 1842 Directory of Lincolnshire&quot; called Metheringham &quot;a large improving village, on a gentle declivity, between Lincoln Heath and the Cardyke navigation, 9 miles S. E. of Lincoln. Its parish increased its population from 536 in 1801, to 880 in 1831, to 1197 in 1841,and contains 5682A[cres], 1R[ood], 32P[erches] of land.&quot; It also notes, &quot;An ancient Cross, which stood in the village, was replaced by a new one in 1835, at the cost of about £25, and a market is now held round it on Saturday evenings. The drainage of the parish is aided by a steam engine of 25-horse power, and has dried an ancient spring called Holywell.&quot; It describes the church (see below) and adds, &quot;Here is a Wesleyan Chapel, erected in 1840. A School was established by subscription in 1841, and there is a flourishing Sick Club, and also a Cow Club. The poor parishioners have 3R.37P. of land left by one Colley; and an annuity of £3, left by John Ellis in 1829.&quot;

The village war memorial records the names of 42 men who died for their country in the First World War and eight who fell in the Second World War.

===Notable person===
The village was the birthplace of H. F. Ellis (1907–2000), a writer who developed the comic schoolmaster character A. J. Wentworth B. A. in the magazine &quot;Punch&quot; and later in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

==Geography==
Metheringham lies east of the Lincoln Cliff escarpment, on the western edge of fenland extending south-east towards Boston and The Wash. It lies on the north–south B1188 between Ruskington and Branston, and on the east–west B1202 and B1189 roads. Dunston is to the north, and Scopwick and Blankney are to the south. The railway station is in Station Road (B1189). The centre of the village is a conservation area. To the west and the A15 is Metheringham Heath, on which is a SSSI at a local quarry.

===Metheringham Fen, Sots Hole and Tanvats===
To the east is Metheringham Fen, across which lies Metheringham Delph that drains into the River Witham from where it connects to the Car Dyke near an old wartime airfield. The Metheringham Delph was recommended for designation as a local wildlife area in 2010. The area has historically been a centre for potato cultivation, and agricultural workers lived at two hamlets on the fen, Tanvats and Sots Hole. Their needs were served by two schools, a church, a shop and a public house. All were gone by the 1980s, as agricultural mechanisation saw a decline in employment.

==Community==
Metheringham is known to locals as &quot;Meg&quot;. The population of the built-up area was estimated at 3,595 in 2018.

The parish church of St Wilfrid belongs to the Metheringham group with Blankney and Dunston. There is a Methodist church, built in 1907 by the architect Albert Edward Lambert. San Damiano House is one of five houses in England of the Community of St. Francis, a Franciscan Anglican religious order for women.

The village has a primary school, a High Street cafe, a Co-op store, and a traditional butcher&#x27;s shop, which has been trading for over 80 years. It has four pubs: the &quot;Star &amp; Garter&quot; in Prince&#x27;s Street, the &quot;White Hart Inn&quot;, the &quot;Lincolnshire Poacher&quot; in High Street, and the &quot;Londesborough Arms&quot;.

Metheringham is served by an hourly daytime, Monday-to-Saturday bus between Boston and Lincoln, provided by Brylaine. This runs less frequently on Sundays. Other services run to South Kyme (P. C. Coaches) and to Sleaford (Road Car). There are regular direct Monday-to-Saturday train services to Lincoln, Doncaster, Sleaford, Spalding, Peterborough, and Leicester.

<doc id="1114499" wikidata="Q730078" url="?curid=1114499" title="Luc Letellier de St-Just">
<text>Luc Letellier de Saint-Just, (May 12, 1820 – January 28, 1881) was a Canadian politician. He also served as the third Lieutenant Governor of Quebec (1876–1879).

A notary by training, Letellier belonged to a prominent family that descended from Michel Letellier who, originally from Saint-Quentin, in the diocese of Noyon, migrated to New France around 1705 with his wife Marie Mélie. Their son, François Letellier de Saint-Just, born in Québec in 1709, became a soldier in Fouville&#x27;s company and retired from the troops in October 1740, after marrying Marie-Françoise Pelletier in Québec on January 25, 1740. In February 1750, they had a son named Michel Tellier who, as a farmer, was a member of the House of Assembly of Lower Canada between 1800 and 1804. He and his wife Louise Moreau are the parents of François Letellier, notary, who married Marie-Sophie Casgrain, who are the parents of Luc Letellier de Saint-Just, who was a half-brother of Horace Bélanger.

In 1851, Luc Letellier was elected in a by-election to the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada as a supporter of Louis-Hippolyte Lafontaine. He was defeated in a general election a few months later by his rival Jean-Charles Chapais. In 1860, Letellier won election to the legislative council of the united province and, in 1863, he was appointed minister of agriculture in the Reform - rouge Cabinet of Joint Premiers John Sandfield Macdonald and Antoine-Aimé Dorion. The government fell the next year, however, in favour of a Tory – Parti bleu administration.

Letellier opposed Canadian Confederation prior to 1867, but accepted it once it became a reality. He was appointed by royal charter as a charter member of the Senate of Canada when it was created in 1867. He sat as a &quot;Nationalist Liberal&quot;, and was Leader of the Opposition in the Senate from 1867 until the 1872 election when the Liberals took power under Alexander Mackenzie. Letellier became Leader of the Government in the Senate and Minister of Agriculture in Mackenzie&#x27;s Cabinet. He had also attempted to concurrently win a seat in the Quebec legislative assembly, but was defeated in his attempts in 1869 and 1871 to win election.

In 1876, Mackenzie advised the Governor General of Canada to appoint Letellier to the position of lieutenant-governor of Quebec. As lieutenant governor, he dismissed the government of Conservative Quebec Premier Charles-Eugène Boucher de Boucherville on March 1, 1878, despite the fact that the government enjoyed a 20-seat majority in the Legislative Assembly and a two-to-one majority in the Legislative Council. Letellier justified the dismissal on charges that the government was acting incompetently and corruptly on the matter of railway legislation. He also argued that if the de Boucherville government had not made concessions to &quot;rings&quot; of interest within the legislature on the issue, it would have lost the legislature&#x27;s support. De Boucherville called the move a &quot;coup d&#x27;etat&quot; and complained to the Governor General of Canada. Both houses of the legislature passed motions of censure against the lieutenant-governor.

When the federal Conservatives under Sir John A. Macdonald defeated the federal Liberals in the 1878 election, the new federal Cabinet tried to have Letellier dismissed as lieutenant-governor of Quebec. The Governor General, the Marquess of Lorne, referred the matter to the Colonial Secretary in London, who advised him to follow the advice of his ministers. Letellier was dismissed.

<doc id="1114504" wikidata="Q133744" url="?curid=1114504" title="Tour operator">
<text>A tour operator is a business that typically combines and organizes accommodations, meals, sightseeing and transportation components, in order to create a package tour. They advertise and produce brochures to promote their products, holidays and itineraries. Tour operators can sell directly to the public or sell through travel agents or a combination of both.

The most common example of a tour operator&#x27;s product would be a flight on a charter airline, plus a transfer from the airport to a hotel and the services of a local representative, all for one price. Each tour operator may specialise in certain destinations, e.g. Italy, activities and experiences, e.g. skiing, or a combination thereof.

==Operations==
The original &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; of tour operating was the difficulty for ordinary folk of making arrangements in far-flung places, with problems of language, currency and communication. The advent of the Internet has led to a rapid increase in self-packaging of holidays. However, tour operators still have their competence in arranging tours for those who do not have time to do DIY holidays, and specialize in large group events and meetings such as conferences or seminars. Also, tour operators still exercise contracting power with suppliers (airlines, hotels, other land arrangements, cruise companies and so on) and influence over other entities (tourism boards and other government authorities) in order to create packages and special group departures for destinations that might otherwise be difficult and expensive to visit.

==Trade associations==
The three major tour operator associations in the U.S. are the National Tour Association (NTA), the United States Tour Operators Association (USTOA), and the American Bus Association (ABA).

<text>Whitmore Knaggs was a fighter, linguist and spy.

==Biography==
Knagg&#x27;s parents were George Knaggs, who had been born in London, England, and Rachel Sly, who had Dutch parentage. One of at least eight children, he was born in about 1763 on his father&#x27;s farm by the Maumee River in Ohio. He was educated at home, being taught French, Latin, and Dutch by his mother.

Knaggs was friendly with the local Native American people, and was appointed a United States Indian agent in 1781. In July 1784 the headman of the Ottawa nation granted him a tract of land on the Maumee River on which Fort Miami was later built.

On August 20, 1794, he fought with General Anthony Wayne at the Battle of Fallen Timbers against a mixed Canadian and Native American force. He also acted as interpreter.

He moved to Detroit, where his father had opened a trading store, and in 1797, married Josette Labadie. In 1803 he bought a homestead and farm on the Detroit River by Knaggs Creek (now disappeared, the site was about two blocks west of where Grand Boulevard meets the Detroit River), where he raised five children, and built a windmill. It became a stopping point for the Ottawa, Chippewa, Pottawatomi and Wabash tribes. Whitmore Knaggs could converse in all these languages.

He was a personal friend of the Indian leader Tecumseh (who was later killed by James Knaggs). In 1805 he was made a captain in the Michigan Militia, and fought against the British and the Indians in the War of 1812, from 1812 to 1815. He was present at the Surrender of Detroit and was taken prisoner by the British, but later released. Later captured by the Shawnee chief George Blue Jacket, he was saved from death by the Wyandot chief, Jack Brandy.

After the war he resumed his duties as Indian agent and interpreter, being a signatory to Treaties at Detroit (1807), Brownstown (1808), Maumee (1817), St Mary&#x27;s, Ohio (1818), Saginaw (1819).

A full history of Whitmore Knaggs, his family and descendants is told in &quot;History of the Knaggs Family of Ohio and Michigan&quot; by Robert B Ross, Detroit, 1902.

<doc id="1114528" wikidata="Q245375" url="?curid=1114528" title="Inter-Cities Fairs Cup">
<text>The Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, sometimes referred to as the European Fairs Cup, Fairs Cities&#x27; Cup, or simply as the Fairs Cup, was a European football competition played between 1955 and 1971. It is considered the predecessor to the UEFA Cup (now the UEFA Europa League). The competition was the idea of FIFA vice-president and executive committee member Ernst Thommen, Italian Football Federation president and FIFA executive committee member Ottorino Barassi, and the English Football Association general secretary, Stanley Rous, who later became an executive committee member and vice-president of UEFA (1958–1961) and president of FIFA (1961–1974). As the name suggests, the competition was set up to promote international trade fairs. Friendly games were regularly held between teams from cities holding trade fairs and it was from these games that the competition evolved. Initially, the competition was only open to cities that hosted trade fairs, and where the cities&#x27; clubs finished in their national league had no relevance. Early competitions also featured a &quot;one city, one team&quot; rule, with some teams selected from multiple clubs.

After 1964, the Fairs Cup was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Runners-up Cup&quot;, with teams now qualifying based on league position. The winning team received the Noel Beard Trophy (&quot;Trophée Noel Beard&quot;), named for the cutler who designed it.

The competition was organised by the Fairs Cup Committee which was led by some FIFA executives until 1971, when it was taken over by UEFA and replaced with the UEFA Cup. According to UEFA general secretary Hans Bangerter, &quot;The competition was very successful but the time came when the UEFA Executive Committee thought that such a major competition should be governed and organised by UEFA itself, which could ensure that standard rules were followed and could deal with refereeing and disciplinary matters.&quot; While the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup is generally considered to be the predecessor to the UEFA Cup, it was not organised by UEFA and ran under different regulations; consequently, the confederation does not consider clubs&#x27; records in the Fairs Cup to be part of their European record.

==History==
===Spanish era===
The first competition was to be held over two seasons to avoid clashes with national leagues fixtures. Because it was also intended to coincide with trade fairs, it ran over into a third year. It commenced in 1955 and finished in 1958. Cities that entered teams included Barcelona, Basel, Birmingham, Copenhagen, Frankfurt, Vienna, Cologne, Lausanne, Leipzig, London, Milan, and Zagreb. The first competition included a group stage and also featured some city representative teams instead of clubs. The eventual finalists were the city of Barcelona, dubbed Barcelona XI, and a London XI. While the latter side consisted of players from 11 clubs, the former was effectively FC Barcelona. After a 2–2 draw at Stamford Bridge, Barcelona emerged triumphant after winning the return 6–0. A second tournament took place between 1958 and 1960. This time, the group stage format was abandoned in favour of a knockout tournament. Barcelona retained the cup, beating Birmingham City 4–1 in the final.

The third tournament was held over the course of the 1960–61 season and all subsequent tournaments were completed over one season. The season also saw the holders, Barcelona, compete in both the Fairs Cup and European Cup. During the early days of European competition, these tournaments were effectively rivals and there was little or no co-ordination between the administrators running them. The European Cup quickly established itself as the premier club competition, largely because it had the advantage of featuring national league champions and was completed in a single season from the very start. The efforts of Barcelona ended in failure in both competitions. In the Fairs Cup quarter-finals, they lost 7–6 on aggregate to Hibernian, while in the European Cup, they were beaten in the final by Benfica. Roma took three games to beat Hibernian in the semi-finals before they progressed to the final. Birmingham City reached their second final in two years but once again they were defeated. After a 2–2 draw at home, they lost 2–0 to Roma in the return.

The 1961–62 season saw the rules amended to allow three teams from each country to enter. The &quot;one city, one team&quot; rule was temporarily abandoned and two teams represented each of Edinburgh, Milan, and Barcelona (respectively Hibernian and Heart of Midlothian, Internazionale and A.C. Milan, and FC Barcelona and RCD Espanyol). This increase in teams resulted in Spanish teams continuing to dominate the competition. FC Barcelona were now regularly joined by Valencia CF and Zaragoza. These three clubs won the competition six times between them from 1958 to 1966. The Fairs Cup saw three all-Spanish finals in 1962, 1964, and 1966. The 1962 final saw Valencia CF beat FC Barcelona 7–3 on aggregate and in 1963 they retained the title after beating Dinamo Zagreb with a 4–1 aggregate score. They reached their third final in 1964 but lost 2–1 to Zaragoza in a single game at the Camp Nou.

The 1965 tournament saw a record entry of 48 teams, testimony to the growing status of the Fairs Cup. It also produced only the second final not to feature a Spanish team. Ferencvárosi TC of Hungary beat Juventus in another single-game final. The 1966 competition attracted attention for all the wrong reasons. Chelsea were pelted with rubbish at Roma and Leeds United fought a bruising encounter with Valencia CF which ended with three dismissals. Leeds also had Johnny Giles sent off in the semi-final against Zaragoza. The final saw FC Barcelona beat Zaragoza 4–3 on aggregate.

===English era===
The 1967 tournament saw the emergence of English clubs with Leeds United reaching the final. Although they lost to Dinamo Zagreb, they returned the following season and defeated Ferencvárosi TC to become the first English club to win the competition. The subsequent victories of Newcastle United and Arsenal and a second win for Leeds United saw English clubs winning the last four Fairs Cup tournaments. The last final saw Leeds United declared winners on away goals after drawing with Juventus 3–3 on aggregate.

===UEFA Cup===
In the 1971–72 season the competition was abolished and replaced by the UEFA Cup after UEFA revised the entry regulations and concluded that the &quot;one city one team&quot; rule related with the Fairs Cup must be abolished, which had had a particularly bad effect on English entrants for 1969–70, when Liverpool (2nd), Arsenal (4th), Southampton (7th), and Newcastle United (9th-also holders) got the places, at the expense of Everton (3rd), Chelsea (5th), Tottenham Hotspur (6th), and West Ham United (8th). The Football League upheld the geographic rule until 1975, when UEFA pressured the League to drop it or face sanctions. Everton that year, having come 4th, would have been excluded from the competition due to Liverpool&#x27;s 2nd-place finish.

==Finals==
;Notes
==Trophy play-off match==

After the 1970–71 tournament, the last of the Fairs Cup, the competition was abolished and replaced with the UEFA Cup.

The Fairs Cup trophy had not been won by any club permanently, so a play-off match was organised to decide who would gain permanent possession of the original competition trophy. Before the match, then FIFA President Sir Stanley Rous presented silver insignia to the members of the 1958 title-winning side, FC Barcelona.

The one-off match was played on 22 September 1971, between the first ever Fairs Cup winners, Barcelona, and the last winners, Leeds United. Barcelona won this play-off 2–1.

<text>Registration authorities (RAs) exist for many standards organizations, such as ISO, the Object Management Group, W3C, and others. In general, registration authorities all perform a similar function, in promoting the use of a particular standard through facilitating its use. This may be by applying the standard, where appropriate, or by verifying that a particular application satisfies the standard&#x27;s tenants. Maintenance agencies, in contrast, may change an element in a standard based on set rules – such as the creation or change of a currency code when a currency is created or revalued (i.e. TRL to TRY for Turkish lira). The Object Management Group has an additional concept of certified provider, which is deemed an entity permitted to perform some functions on behalf of the registration authority, under specific processes and procedures documented within the standard for such a role.

An ISO registration authority is not authorized to update standards but provides a registration function to facilitate implementation of an International Standard (e.g. ISBN for books). Frequently, facilitating the implementation of an ISO standard&#x27;s requirements is best suited, by its nature, to one entity, an RA. This, de facto, creates a monopoly situation and this is why care needs to be taken with respect to the functions carried out and the fees charged to avoid an abuse of such a situation. In most cases, there is a formal legal contract in place between the standards body, such as the ISO General Secretariat, and the selected registration authority.

ISO registration authorities differ from a maintenance agency. Maintenance agencies are authorized to update particular elements in an International Standard and as a matter of policy, the secretariats of MAs are assigned to bodies forming part of the ISO system (member bodies or organizations to which a member body delegates certain tasks in its country). The membership of MAs and their operating procedures are subject to approval by the Technical Management Board.

While registration authorities for a particular standard typically do not change, the position is not formally guaranteed and is subject to review and reassignment to a different firm or organization. In some cases, the concept of a registration authority may not exist for a standard at all.

By further example, the equivalent registration authority organization for Internet standards is the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority.

<text>Captain Tobias Furneaux (21 August 173518 September 1781) was a British navigator and Royal Navy officer, who accompanied James Cook on his second voyage of exploration. He was one of the first men to circumnavigate the world in both directions, and later commanded a British vessel during the American War of Independence.

== Early life ==
Furneaux was born at Swilly House near Stoke Damerel, Plymouth Dock, son of William Furneaux (1696–1748) of Swilly, and Susanna Wilcocks (1698–1775). He entered the Royal Navy and was employed on the French and African coasts and in the West Indies during the latter part of the Seven Years&#x27; War (1760–1763). He served as second lieutenant of under Captain Samuel Wallis on the latter&#x27;s voyage round the globe (August 1766May 1768) and due to Wallis being ill and confined to his cabin, Furneaux was the first European to set foot on Tahiti, hoisting a pennant, turning a turf, and taking possession of the land in the name of His Majesty (25 June 1767).

== Service with Cook ==
In November 1771, Furneaux was given command of HMS , which accompanied James Cook (in ) on his second voyage. On this expedition Furneaux was twice separated from his leader (8 February 1773 to 19 May 1773; and 22 October 1773 to 14 July 1774, the date of his return to England). On the former occasion he explored a great part of the south and east coasts of Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania), and made the earliest British chart of the island. Unfortunately he mapped several place names incorrectly. He glimpsed the opening to D&#x27;Entrecasteaux Channel and thought that was Storm Bay. He thought he had rounded Cape Pillar and was on the east coast just south of Cape Frederick Hendrik, whereas he had turned left one stop early and was at Bruny Island, where he named Adventure Bay for his ship. The cape to his north he assumed to be Cape Frederick Hendrik, with Frederick Hendrik Bay on the other side of it, so he put both names on his chart. Off to the north-east, Furneaux could see where Maria Island should be, but there seemed to be a few extra sights of land, so he changed the name to Maria Isles.

Most of his names here survive; Cook, visiting the shore-line on his third voyage, confirmed Furneaux&#x27;s account and delineation of it, with certain minor criticisms and emendations, and named after him the Furneaux Group at the eastern entrance to Bass Strait, and the group now known as the Low Archipelago.

After &quot;Adventure&quot; was finally separated from &quot;Resolution&quot; off New Zealand in October 1773, Furneaux returned home alone, bringing with him Omai of Ulaietea (Raiatea). This first South Sea Islander to travel to Great Britain returned to Tahiti with Cook on 12 August 1777. Also of note is that Furneaux successfully introduced domestic animals and potatoes into the South Sea Islands.

== Later commands ==
Furneaux was made a captain in 1775. During the American War of Independence, he commanded HMS &quot;Syren&quot; in the British attack of 28 June 1776 upon Charleston, South Carolina. &quot;Syren&quot;, with Furneaux in command, was wrecked near Point Judith, Rhode Island on 6 November 1777. The Rhode Island Marine Archaeology Project (RIMAP) has published a detailed history of the &quot;Syren&quot;&#x27;s activities in the American War of Independence, as well as some of the original documents related to her loss, confirming 6 November as the correct date. By 10 November Furneaux and his crew were prisoners in Providence, Rhode Island, awaiting later exchange. RIMAP has also noted that the &quot;Syren&quot; is one of at least five ships associated with Captain Cook and his circumnavigating men with an historical connection to the State of Rhode Island.

== Taxon named in his honor ==
*The Furneaux scorpionfish, Scorpaenopsis furneauxi is a species of venomous marine ray-finned fish belonging to the family Scorpaenidae, the scorpionfishes that was named after him.

Furneaux died unmarried in 1781 and was buried in Stoke Damerel Church in Plymouth where he had been christened.

<doc id="1114538" wikidata="Q135847" url="?curid=1114538" title="Z39.50">
<text>Z39.50 is an international standard client–server, application layer communications protocol for searching and retrieving information from a database over a TCP/IP computer network, developed and maintained by the Library of Congress. It is covered by ANSI/NISO standard Z39.50, and ISO standard 23950. 

Z39.50 is widely used in library environments, for interlibrary catalogue search and loan, often incorporated into integrated library systems and personal bibliographic reference software, and social media such as LibraryThing. 

Work on the Z39.50 protocol began in the 1970s, and led to successive versions in 1988, 1992, 1995 and 2003. The Contextual Query Language (formerly called the Common Query Language) is based on Z39.50 semantics.

== Search syntax ==
The protocol supports search, retrieval, sort, and browse. Search queries contain attributes, typically from the bib-1 attribute set which defines six attributes to specify information searches on the server computer: use, relation, position, structure, truncation, completeness. The syntax of Z39.50 allows for very complex queries.

In practice, the functional complexity is limited by the uneven implementations by developers and commercial vendors. The syntax of Z39.50 is abstracted from the underlying database structure. For example, if the client specifies an author search using attribute 1003, the server must determine how to map that search to the indexes it contains. This allows Z39.50 queries to be formulated without knowing anything about the target database, but it also means that results for the same query can vary widely among different servers. One server may have an author index and another may use its index of personal names, whether they are authors or not. A third may have no name index and fall back on its keyword index, and yet another may have no suitable index and return an error.

An attempt to remedy the inconsistency is the Bath Profile (named after Bath, England, where the working group first met in 1999). This document rigidly specifies the search syntax to employ for common bibliographic searches, and the expected response of Bath-compliant servers. Implementation of the Bath Profile has been slow but is gradually improving the Z39.50 landscape. The Bath Profile is maintained by Library and Archives Canada.

== Modernization efforts ==
Z39.50 is a pre-Web technology, and various working groups are attempting to update it to fit better into the modern environment. These attempts fall under the designation ZING (Z39.50 International: Next Generation), and pursue various strategies.

The successors to Z39.50 are the twin protocols SRU/SRW (&quot;Search/Retrieve via URL&quot;/&quot;Search/Retrieve Web service&quot;), which drop the Z39.50 communications protocol (replacing it with HTTP) while still attempting to preserve the benefits of the query syntax. SRU is REST-based, and enables queries to be expressed in URL query strings; SRW uses SOAP. Both expect search results to be returned as XML.

These projects have a much lower barrier to entry for developers than the original Z39.50 protocol, allowing the relatively small market for library software to benefit from the web service tools developed for much larger markets.

Alternatives include the following.
* Open Archives Initiative Protocol for Metadata Harvesting (OAI-PMH)
* SPARQL

== Firewall information ==

The registered network port number for Z39.50 is 210. Although the majority of servers use this port, there are dozens of other port numbers used worldwide by Z39.50 (e.g. 2100, 2200, 2210, 2213, 3520, or in one case, ports 2101 and higher for different databases).

<text>Worrall is a small rural village in the civil parish of Bradfield, South Yorkshire, England, north west of Sheffield city centre. It has an area of 233 hectares, and population of 1,306 as of 2006, and borders the Sheffield suburbs of Wadsley, Middlewood and Loxley to the south and east and the adjoining village of Oughtibridge to the north; to the west is a rural area extending towards the village of High Bradfield.

==History==
The origins of Worrall go back to Viking times as the names of Towngate Road and Lund Road indicate. Also it is sited away from existing Anglo-Saxon villages such as Wadsley and this was quite common for many Viking settlements. There is no evidence of Anglo-Saxon activity in Worrall. It had its roots in farming and was mentioned in records as part of a manor which also included the areas of Ughill and Wadsley. The manor was held by the Saxon chief Aldene and included 14 bovates of land and an open woodland, a mile square. The villages name derives from the Saxon word &quot;Hrivfull&quot; meaning &quot;top&quot; and this would certainly apply to Worrall&#x27;s lofty position above the Don and Loxley valleys.

After the Norman Conquest Worrall was mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as being part of the land held by Roger de Busli. Throughout its history Worrall was closely connected with the nearby village of Wadsley which lies two km to the SW. 
A certain Geoffrey (&quot;of Worrell&quot;) de la Pole, c,1430-1474, is believed to have been associated with Worrall.
In 1541 Henry Everingham was named as lord of the manor of both villages in a charter which granted relief from paying certain duties as long as tenants paid their annual rent. The manor of Worrall was transferred to the ownership of Robert Swyft in 1557 and then to Sir Francis Leake before passing into the estates of the Earl of Shrewsbury. In the 18th century the Stead family estate owned properties in Worrall; at his death Thomas Stead (1728–93) owned 16 properties and in various parts of Hallamshire and Sheffield. Throughout this period Worrall was predominantly a farming community.

Worrall developed some small-scale industry at the onset of the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th and early 19th centuries when some small Little Mester workshops were set up to make cutlery and knives. Nearby Wadsley had a reputation for making pocket knives and Worrall found it easier to trade with Wadsley than with the more distant Sheffield.

Ganister mining and quarrying were other industries that grew in the area. Quarrying developed from the middle of the 17th century when there was an expansion of farming in the area and farmhouses and cottages needed to be built for the workers. The biggest quarry in the area was the Middlewood quarry off Mowson Lane which was owned by George Turner. Local historian Joe Castle has suggested that stone from this quarry was used to build the Wicker Arches in Sheffield. The quarry closed at the start of World War II and is now a new housing development. There were three ganister mines in the immediate Worrall area. The Yews Mine and the Langhouse Mine were owned by Charles Bramall, while the Stubbin Mine was owned by the Oughtibridge Silica Firebrick Company and was the last to close in November 1927. The Bramall Company owned 2 silica brickworks in the area - Birtin Works and Caledonia Works, both had closed by 1927.

==Present day==

Today Worrall is mostly a residential village with a mixture of new and older housing. Most of its working residents commute to their jobs in Sheffield and other areas. There is a higher proportion of older people in the village compared to the rest of Sheffield with 32% of the population aged between 45 and 64. 87% of the houses in Worrall are owner occupied, a high figure compared to the 60% average for Sheffield as a whole. There are still several farms on the periphery of the village but farming is much reduced from the 19 farms that existed in the immediate area in the 1930s. Some such as Lund Farm, Grange Farm and The Yews Farm have been sold for housing development in recent years. The last farm to operate in the centre of Worrall was the Wiggan dairy farm on Towngate Road. Sycamore Park is a public recreation area off Briarfields Lane in the village; it is 1.4 hectares (3.46 acres) in area and has a playground, mini football pitch, cycle track and picnic benches.

===Significant buildings===

There are two public houses in the village. The Blue Ball is believed to have been originally two cottages which were connected at some time to make bigger premises. There is no documented date of origin although first licensed in 1825 (Robert Waite 1825-1833 first Landlord). The Shoulder of Mutton was formerly farm buildings but has been a pub since at least 1817, it was modernised in the 1980s. Worrall Independent Chapel dates from 1878 and has a foundation stone inscribed &quot;This stone was laid by John Wycliffe Wilson of Sheffield July 15th 1878&quot;. Worrall National school was founded in 1848 and eventually closed in 1966 with the pupils being transferred to Oughtibridge Primary School; the old school house is now a private residence. Bradfield School, a secondary school for pupils aged between 11 and 16 was built in 1957 on Kirk Edge Road as it leaves the village; there are approximately 1,000 pupils at the school.

Worrall Hall situated on Kirk Edge Road is the oldest building in Worrall but it has three distinct sections all of different time periods. The west wing dates from the 16th century while the central section has a date stone of 1720; the eastern section dates from 1820. The Hall was formerly a listed building but was taken off the list in 1985. It is a private house and has undergone renovation work in recent years after becoming run down. The adjoining Worrall Hall Farm has not been a working farm for many years. The Yews is a building located on Worrall Road as it enters the village from the SE. It dates from the 1880s and was formerly a hospital. It was owned by Sheffield Primary Care Trust and was used as offices for the Mental Health Team. Now it has been sold at auction and there is a renovation project to turn it into a £1million plus valued home.

The Worrall Memorial Hall is a venue for local social and fundraising activities; it is situated next to Sycamore Park. Hillsborough Golf Club lies to the south of the village. The course was created in 1920 with the club house added in 1936. Worrall Male Voice Choir was formed on 7 September 1970 and is a highly respected local vocal group which is based in the village; it has a busy schedule of concerts and fund raising activities. The Monastery of The Holy Spirit, known locally as Kirk Edge convent stands two km to the west of the village. Built in 1871, it is a monastery of the Carmelite order of nuns.

<doc id="1114543" wikidata="Q706997" url="?curid=1114543" title="Taramakau River">
<text>The Taramakau River is a river of the West Coast Region of the South Island of New Zealand. It rises in the Southern Alps / Kā Tiritiri o te Moana near Harper Pass, due east of Hokitika, and runs westward for into the Tasman Sea south of Greymouth.

The Taramakau River forms the administrative boundary between the Westland District to the south and the Grey District to the north.

Several small rivers are tributaries of the Taramakau. The largest of upper tributaries are the Otehake River and the Ōtira River. The valley of the Ōtira forms the western approach to Arthur&#x27;s Pass. The Taipo River is a major tributary joining the Taramakau from the south, downstream of Inchbonnie.

==Statutory acknowledgement==
The South Island iwi Ngāi Tahu have manawhenua or tribal authority over the Taramakau River, acknowledged under s56 of the Ngāi Tahu Claims Settlement Act 1998. The Taramakau was a traditional route of travel across the Southern Alps, providing access to Nōti Taramakau (Harper Pass), one of the lowest and most accessible passes through the mountainous terrain. The river has also been a source of the highly prized stone pounamu.

== Taramakau Bridge at Kumara Junction ==

The Taramakau River posed significant difficulties and dangers for early travellers on the West Coast. The explorer Henry Whitcombe drowned crossing the river on 6 May 1863. There are two memorials to Whitcombe; one on the river&#x27;s left bank at the (road-)rail bridge, and he is one of the four men commemorated by the Westland Explorers&#x27; Monument in Hokitika Cemetery. Before a bridge was built near the coast, a cable way operated across the river, carrying a tram car.On 18 December 1893, the railway line from Hokitika to Greymouth opened, including a long single-lane road and rail bridge across the Taramakau River near Kumara Junction. By 2016, this bridge was New Zealand&#x27;s last remaining road and rail bridge. There were 25 crashes on the bridge in the 10 years to June 2015, including one fatality in 2012. The one-lane bridge also caused traffic congestion on State Highway 6, because vehicles had to queue before crossing. Work on a new road bridge commenced in 2016 and was completed at a cost of $25 million. The new bridge was opened on 22 July 2018. The old bridge continued in service as a rail-only bridge.

== Stopbanks at Inchbonnie ==

The Taramakau River crosses the Alpine Fault at Inchbonnie. At this point, it has in its history flowed in three different directions: westwards along its present course, northwards towards and into Lake Brunner via the Ōrangipuku River, and northeast through Lake Poerua, the Poerua River and the lower reaches of Crooked River into Lake Brunner. Inchbonnie is located on an alluvial fan that infills the three valleys. If the Taramakau River changed course at Inchbonnie, in addition to the damage to arable farming land, it would cause increased flows in the Arnold and Grey Rivers. The effective design capacity of existing flood protection works at Greymouth would be reduced, increasing the flood risk exposure of the town.

In the early 1900s, the Taramakau River overflowed into the Ōrangipuku River on several occasions, raising the risk of “breaking-through” to Lake Brunner. Investigations of river protection works began as early as 1907. In February 1946, floodwaters from the Taramakau again flowed into the Ōrangipuku River causing significant problems, and in October that year a proposal was developed to construct a stopbank along the north bank of the Taramakau River. In 1953 a small project involving 60 metres of tree protection and 80 metres of rockwork and was approved. However, by 1958, erosion had progressed to the point that there was only 5 metres of land remaining between the Taramakau and Ōrangipuku Rivers, and emergency works were required. A report prepared in March 1959 recommended construction of of new stopbanks, strengthening and raising of existing stopbanks, plus of new rock rip rap, and diverting the upper section of the Ōrangipuku River into the Taramakau River. This proposal was only partially implemented to contain costs for ratepayers, with works including of rock riprap, and strengthening and raising stopbanks where there was inadequate freeboard. In August 1959, a 3:1 subsidy was provided by the NZ Soil Conservation and River Control Council for a larger project involving placement of 17,300 tonnes of rock, 9,000 cubic metres of fill for stopbanks and 3,200 tonnes of rock for “topping-up”.

The river protection works at Inchbonnie are some of the most critical flood defences managed by the West Coast Regional Council, because of the widespread consequences if they failed.

<doc id="1114549" wikidata="Q6700599" url="?curid=1114549" title="Luis Francisco Ojeda">
<text>Luis Francisco Ojeda (born June 16, 1941) is a well-known Puerto Rican television, radio reporter and host, noted for his aggressive, uncompromising questioning. He spent 50 years on radio until his retirement in 2020.

==Early years==
Ojeda was born in Jayuya. He moved to Ponce when he was still a youngster. While studying in high school, he got his first opportunity to talk live in a daily show, becoming a newscaster for Ponce&#x27;s WPAB radio station.

==Career as a newscaster==
Ojeda signed a contract with WAPA in 1960, and moved to San Juan. He worked at WAPA as newscaster (and occasional disc jockey) until 1968, moving on that year to work for rival WKAQ-Radio Reloj. While there, he had to cover the historic riots at the University of Puerto Rico at Rio Piedras in 1971. In one of the incidents covered by Ojeda a shooting ensued, and Ojeda, in the middle of the shootout, rescued a police lieutenant who had been shot. Despite his efforts, the police officer died from his gunshot wounds in the back of the remote unit truck while Ojeda was broadcasting his and his driver&#x27;s frantic rush to the nearest emergency room live.

Ojeda was later offered a job as the news director and anchorman of Telemundo Puerto Rico&#x27;s television news show. He decided, however, not to take the job, opting instead to join then governor Rafael Hernández Colón&#x27;s staff, as a member of Puerto Rico&#x27;s Communications Office. Ojeda needed to work as a journalist, however, and, by 1973, he decided to step in front of the television cameras for the first time, working at channel 11&#x27;s news show. Not long after Ojeda joined channel 11, the channel&#x27;s owner had died and the station went bankrupt, so Ojeda signed on with WAPA-TV to work as a field reporter at Noticentro 4.

Ojeda spent most of his time at Noticentro 4 traveling across Puerto Rico, working as an on-the-field reporter, but he also sporadically got chances to host the show, usually filling in for a sick anchorman or woman. He worked on various tragedies, government scandals and other types of news while at Noticentro 4, essentially pioneering investigative reporting in Puerto Rican television.

==Ojeda, Sin Limite==
In 1987, he was given his own television talk show, &quot;Ojeda, Sin Limite&quot; (&quot;Ojeda, Without Limit&quot;). He became known for his strong questioning of participants of the show, and the show produced a number of classic moments of Puerto Rican television; such as the time that two of the three candidates for Puerto Rican commissioner in Washington, D.C., the PNP&#x27;s Carlos Romero Barceló (former governor of Puerto Rico) and the PPD&#x27;s Miguel Hernandez Agosto got into a shouting match, calling each other &quot;liar&quot; multiple times and almost physically assaulting each other.

After his show was cancelled, Ojeda continued &quot;Ojeda, Sin Limite&quot; as a radio show, on WKAQ-Radio.

==Currently==
In 2000, he returned to television, with a show named Ojeda, once again at WAPA-TV, which, by then, had the new name of Televicentro. Later on, he was offered a fifteen-minute space on Televicentro&#x27;s midday variety show, &quot;Mediodía Puerto Rico&quot; (Midday Puerto Rico), where he would accept calls from the public in a segment called &quot;La Descarga&quot; (Discharge). In this segment, Don Eleuterio, comedian Sunshine Logroño&#x27;s alter ego who was a backer of Puerto Rican statehood movements (Logrono himself is a backer of Puerto Rican independence), calls and changes his name trying to pass as another person from the public. Ojeda of course recognizes his voice. Don Eleuterio then usually praises the American people and picks on Ojeda for being an &quot;independista&quot; (an advocate of P.R.&#x27;s independence). Ojeda now collaborates on a new radio station show as well.

As of May 15, 2009, Ojeda broadcast his last &quot;descarga&quot; and on the air tendered his resignation in response to the cancellation of the remaining local programs (Club Sunshine and TV Ilegal) and the dismissal of Junior Alvarez over comments made of mistreatment in part of the vice-president of programming, Jimmy Arteaga, of Peruvian descent. In 2013, Ojeda returned to television again, in Dando Candela by Telemundo.

Ojeda retired in March 2020.

<text>Shaʽban (, &quot;&quot;) is the eighth month of the Islamic calendar. It is called the month of &quot;separation&quot;, as the word means &quot;to disperse&quot; or &quot;to separate&quot; because the pagan Arabs used to disperse in search of water.

The fifteenth night of this month is Mid-Sha&#x27;ban, which coincides with the celebration of Shab-e-Barat in Muslim communities all over Asia.

Sha&#x27;ban is the last lunar month before Ramadan, and so Muslims determine in it when the first day of Ramadan fasting will be. In the second Hijri year (624), fasting during Ramadan was made obligatory during this month.

In the post-Tanzimat Ottoman Empire context, the word was, in French, the main language of diplomacy and a common language among educated and among non-Muslim subjects, spelled Chaban. The current Turkish spelling today is Şâban.

== Virtues ==

The virtues of Sha&#x27;ban is mentioned in various traditions of the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

Aisha, the wife of Muhammad, narrated that &quot;(she) did not see him fasting in any month more than in the month of Sha&#x27;ban,&quot; except Ramadan.

In another narration Muhammad said, &quot;Do those deeds which you can do easily, as Allah will not get tired (of giving rewards) till you get bored and tired (of performing religious deeds).&quot;

==Timing ==

The Islamic calendar is a lunar calendar, and months begin when the first crescent of a new moon is sighted. Since the Islamic lunar calendar year is 11 to 12 days shorter than the solar year, Sha&#x27;ban migrates throughout the seasons. The estimated start and end dates for Sha&#x27;ban, based on the Umm al-Qura calendar of Saudi Arabia, are:

==Islamic events==
* 01 Sha&#x27;ban, birth of Zaynab bint Ali
* 02 Sha&#x27;ban, death of (Imam Azam) Abu Hanifa
* 03 Sha&#x27;ban, birth of Husayn ibn Ali
* 04 Sha&#x27;ban, birth of Abbas ibn Ali
* 05 Sha&#x27;ban, birth of Ali ibn Husayn
* 05 Sha&#x27;ban, death of Fizza, the hand-maiden (Qaneez) of Fatimah
* 07 Sha&#x27;ban, birth of Qasim ibn Hasan
* 11 Sha&#x27;ban, birth of Ali al-Akbar ibn Husayn
* 15 Sha&#x27;ban, holiday known as Laylat al-Bara&#x27;at or Nisfu Sha&#x27;ban; birth of Muhammad al-Mahdi
* 21 Sha&#x27;ban, passing away of Lal Shahbaz Qalandar
* 22 Sha&#x27;ban, death of Muhammad Usman Damani
* 27 Sha&#x27;ban, Death of Sayyad Laal Shah Hamdani
* 27 Sha&#x27;ban, birth of Eissa Hussain Allaqband

<text>Zerna Addas Sharp (August 12, 1889 – June 17, 1981) was an American educator and book editor who is best known as the creator of the Dick and Jane series of beginning readers for elementary school-aged children. Published by Scott, Foresman and Company of Chicago, Illinois, the readers, which described the activities of her fictional siblings, &quot;Dick,&quot; &quot;Jane,&quot; &quot;Sally,&quot; and other characters, were widely used in schools in the United States and many other English-speaking countries for nearly forty years. The series, which included such titles as &quot;We Look and See&quot;, &quot;We Come and Go&quot;, &quot;We Work and Play&quot;, and &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;, among others, was marketed until 1973 and used the look-say method of teaching reading.

==Early life and education==
Zerna Addas Sharp was born on August 12, 1889, to Charles and Lottie (Smith) Sharp in Hillisburg, Clinton County, Indiana, and was the eldest of the family&#x27;s five children. Zerna&#x27;s father owned a general store in Hillisburg. After graduating from high school she completed a year of teacher training at Marion Normal College (Indiana Wesleyan University) in Marion, Indiana, but never earned a degree, and later attended Columbia University in New York City.

==Career==
===Early years===
Sharp began her career as an educator. She taught first-grade students for nearly a decade at elementary schools in Hillisburg, Kirklin, and La Porte, Indiana. Sharp also served as an elementary school principal.

===Creator of the Dick and Jane readers===
Sharp created the characters and concept for the Dick and Jane readers, which were widely used in classrooms in the United States and in other English-speaking countries for nearly four decades before they were replaced with other reading texts. She came up with the idea for the beginning readers for elementary school children while working as a reading consultant and textbook editor for Scott, Foresman and Company, a publisher in Chicago, Illinois.

William Scott Gray (1885–1960), director of the Curriculum Foundation Series at Scott Foresman and dean of the University of Chicago&#x27;s college of education, hired Sharp to develop the characters for the readers and to combine her approach with his ideas for a process of learning to read. Sharp noted the reduced reading ability of children and urged the development 
of a new reading format for primers; Gray&#x27;s research focused on methods to improve reading instruction using content that would be of interest to children and develop their word-recognition skills. Gary and Sharp wanted children who read the books to be able to readily identify with the characters. They also wanted the characters in the stories to participate in typical activities. Before the appearance of the Dick and Jane stories, reading primers &quot;generally included Bible stories or fairy tales with complicated language and few pictures.&quot; 
Sharp was not the author or illustrator of the texts. As the creator of the Dick and Jane beginning readers, Sharp designed the format and content. She also selected the storylines from ideas that others submitted. Gray co-authored with William H. Elson the &quot;Elson Basic Readers&quot; (renamed the &quot;Elson-Gray Basic Readers&quot; in 1936), which Scott Foresman published in Chicago, Illinois. The &quot;Dick&quot; and &quot;Jane&quot; characters, created by Sharp, made their debut in the series in 1930. After the Elson-Gray series ended in 1940, Sharp&#x27;s characters continued in a subsequent series of primary readers that were better known as the &quot;Dick and Jane&quot; readers.

Sharp worked with Gray to create the characters and primary readers that incorporated his input and used the whole-word or look-say method of word recognition (also called sight reading). The look-say method used a controlled vocabulary and taught readers to memorize the words through repetition, placing limited emphasis on teaching phonics. Teacher guides accompanying the texts also encouraged adoption of the whole-word (look-say) method of identifying the meaning of words from the illustrations and repeating words introduced in the text.

===Content developer===
Sharp felt that the watercolor illustrations and texts should work together to provide stories that young readers would relate to and help them learn to read more easily. The text introduced a repetitive pattern of words; the illustrations provided visual reinforcements to help students understand the meaning of the words. Sharp suggested that primers introduce to new readers only one new word on each page and only five new words in each individual story. The Dick and Jane primers adhered to this format.

Sharp worked with illustrator Eleanor B. Campbell, who did most of the illustrations for the Dick and Jane readers, and others to produce and edit the content. In addition, Sharp named the characters in the stories and supervised the layout and illustrations. Sharp, who never married, referred to the two main characters, &quot;Dick&quot; and &quot;Jane,&quot; as her children. These names were chosen because they were easy to sound out. To make sure language in the texts were authentic, Sharp also observed children playing and listened to their speech patterns.

The Dick and Jane reading series taught reading as well as American middle-class values to school-aged children. The storylines that Sharp selected described the lives and experiences of a stereotypical American middle-class, white family in a two-parent suburban home that included three children and two pets. &quot;Father&quot; wore a suit, worked in an office, mowed the lawn, and washed the car. &quot;Mother&quot; stayed at home, did housework, and raised the children. &quot;Dick,&quot; the oldest of the family&#x27;s three children, was active and well-behaved. &quot;Jane,&quot; the second oldest child, was pretty and carefree. She also helped care for the youngest sibling, a baby sister named &quot;Sally.&quot; The family dog was named &quot;Spot;&quot; their cat was named &quot;Puff.&quot; The fictional family&#x27;s suburban home was surrounded with a white picket fence. Because the readers were made for nationwide distribution, the text and illustrations intentionally lacked references to specific regional geography such as mountains, rivers, lakes, plains, or the seashore.

===Response to criticisms===
The Dick and Jane readers, which included titles such as &quot;We Look and See&quot;, &quot;We Come and Go&quot;, &quot;We Work and Play&quot;, and &quot;Fun with Dick and Jane&quot;, among others, monopolized the market for several decades and reached the height of their popularity in the 1950s, when 80 percent of first-grade students in the United States were learning to read though the Dick and Jane stories. However, in the late 1950s and early 1960s, critics of the Dick and Jane readers began to point out its stereotypes; concerns about class, gender, and racial bias; and errors in content and illustrations. Increasing social changes, including the civil rights movement in the 1960s, also made the characters of &quot;Dick and Jane seem increasingly irrelevant to some.&quot; Sharp, who was proud of the series and objected to the harsh criticism, replied, &quot;That&#x27;s all an adult&#x27;s viewpoint.&quot;

==Later years==
Scott Foresman made changes in their readers in the 1960s in an effort to keep the stories relevant, updating the series every five years. The 1965 edition, the last of the Dick and Jane series, introduced the first African American family as characters in a first-grade reader. The family included two parents and their three children: a son, &quot;Mike,&quot; and twin daughters, &quot;Pam&quot; and &quot;Penny.&quot; Although the Dick and Jane series of primers continued to be sold until 1973, and were used in some classroom throughout the 1970s, they were replaced with other reading texts and gradually disappeared from use in schools.

In her retirement Sharp traveled and remained active in the education field. She divided her time between California and Indiana, where she established a home in her later years at Frankfort.

==Death and legacy==
Sharp died at Wesley Manor nursing home in Frankfort, Indiana, on June 17, 1981, at the age of ninety-one. Her remains are interred at a local cemetery.

Sharp&#x27;s legacy was the Dick and Jane readers of the mid-twentieth century, the successors to the phonics-based McGuffey Readers that were popular from the mid-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth century. In 1967, two years after Scott Foresman retired the Dick and Jane series, the company introduced its Open Highways series, which included heavily illustrated classic children&#x27;s stories and poems, as well as placing greater emphasis on multicultural content and phonics training in its subsequent readers.

The Dick and Jane primers that Sharp edited, which were well known for their simple narrative text and watercolor illustrations, taught reading to millions of students for four decades. Despite the challenges and criticisms of these readers, their content, and the look-say format they used to teach reading, Sharp&#x27;s characters of &quot;Dick,&quot; &quot;Jane,&quot; and &quot;Sally&quot; became household words and the primers became icons of mid-century American culture, as well as collectors&#x27; items.

<text>is a Zainichi Korean playwright, novelist, and essayist. Yu writes in Japanese, her native language, but is a citizen of South Korea.

==Early life==
Yu was born in Tsuchiura, Ibaraki Prefecture and grew up in Yokohama, Kanagawa Prefecture as one of four children born to Korean parents. Her father, a son of Korean immigrants, worked at a pachinko gambling parlor. Her mother, a refugee from the Korean War who fled to Japan from South Korea, worked as a hostess in a bar.

Yu&#x27;s father was often abusive, and eventually her parents divorced when Yu was a child. A frequent victim of bullying at school, and after several suicide attempts, she found refuge in literature after reading the literary works of Edgar Allan Poe, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, William Faulkner, and Truman Capote.

==Literary career==
After dropping out of the &quot;Yokohama Kyoritsu Gakuen&quot; high school, she joined the &quot;Tokyo Kid Brothers&quot; (東京キッドブラザース) theater troupe and worked as an actress and assistant director. In 1986, she formed a troupe called &quot;Seishun Gogetsutō&quot; (青春五月党), and the first of several plays written by her was published in 1991.

In the early 1990s, Yu switched to writing novels. Her novels include &quot;Furu Hausu&quot; (フルハウス, &quot;Full House&quot;, 1996), which won the Noma Literary Prize for best work by a new author; &quot;Kazoku Shinema&quot; (家族シネマ, &quot;Family Cinema,&quot; 1997), which won the prestigious Akutagawa Prize; &quot;Gōrudo Rasshu&quot; (ゴールドラッシュ, &quot;Gold Rush&quot; 1998), which was translated into English as &quot;Gold Rush&quot; (2002); and &quot;Hachi-gatsu no Hate&quot; (8月の果て, &quot;The End of August,&quot; 2004). She has published a dozen books of essays and memoirs, and she was an editor of and contributor to the literary quarterly &quot;en-taxi &quot;. Her best-selling memoir &quot;Inochi&quot; (命, &quot;Life&quot;) was made into a movie, also titled &quot;Inochi&quot;.

Yu&#x27;s first novel, a semiautobiographical work titled &quot;Ishi ni Oyogu Sakana&quot; (石に泳ぐ魚, &quot;The Fish Swimming in the Stone&quot;) published in the September 1994 issue of the literary journal Shinchō, became the focus of a legal and ethical controversy. The model for one of the novel&#x27;s main characters—and the person referred to indirectly by the title—objected to her depiction in the story. The publication of the novel in book form was blocked by court order, and some libraries restricted access to the magazine version. After a prolonged legal fight and widespread debate over the rights of authors, readers, and publishers versus individuals&#x27; rights to privacy, a revised version of the novel was published in 2002.

After the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami, Yu began to travel frequently to the affected areas, and, from March 16, 2012, she hosted a weekly radio show called &quot;Yu Miri no Futari to Hitori&quot; (柳美里の二人と一人, &quot;Yu Miri&#x27;s Two People and One Person&quot;) on a temporary emergency broadcasting station called Minamisōma Hibari FM, based in Minamisōma, Fukushima.

Her 2014 novel &quot;Tokyo Ueno Station&quot; reflects her engagement with historical memory and margins by incorporating themes of a migrant laborer from northeastern Japan and his work on Olympic construction sites in Tokyo, as well as the March 11, 2011 disaster. In November 2020, &quot;Tokyo Ueno Station&quot; won the National Book Award for Translated Literature for a translation by translator Morgan Giles.

In 2021, she was working on a novel about migrant workers titled &quot;Yonomori Station&quot; after Yonomori Station on the Jōban Line.

Her latest novel, &quot;The End of August&quot;, about a multi-generational Korean family living during the 1930s Japanese occupation, was published in 2023.

==Personal life==
Yu has experienced racist backlash to her work because of her ethnic background, with some events at bookstores being canceled due to bomb threats.

In 1999, she became pregnant with a married man and took refuge with a former lover suffering from cancer. He took care of her during her pregnancy and died shortly after her child was born in 2000. These events form the basis of her memoir &quot;Inochi&quot;. Since April 2015, Yu has lived in Minamisōma, Fukushima. In 2018, she opened a bookstore called Full House and a theatre space called LaMaMa ODAKA at her home in Odaka District. In 2020, she was baptized at the Haramachi Catholic Church in Minamisōma and was given the name Teresa Benedicta, the religious name of Edith Stein.

She is a single mother and has one son.

<doc id="1114561" wikidata="Q5196285" url="?curid=1114561" title="Custard (band)">
<text>Custard are an Australian indie rock band formed in 1989 in Brisbane, Queensland. The band is colloquially known as Custaro () due to frequent misreadings of its name. They are best known for the ARIA Music Award-winning song &quot;Girls Like That (Don&#x27;t Go For Guys Like Us)&quot;.

==History==
===1989–1993: Formation and early EPs===
The band was originally known as Custard Gun and featured David McCormack on vocals and guitar, Paul Medew on bass (McCormack and Medew both ex-Who&#x27;s Gerald?), James Straker (later in The Melniks) on guitar and Shane Brunn (who later formed Hugbubble and Vanlustbader) on drums. After a few shows and line up changes (namely Straker being replaced by Matthew Strong) Custard Gun morphed into Custard in early 1990.

Custard&#x27;s first release was the four track vinyl EP &quot;Rockfish Anna&quot;, which was issued in November 1990. A fire breathing Elvis impersonator was part of the EP&#x27;s launch festivities.

Custard&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Buttercup/Bedford&quot;, was recorded in 1991. It was meant to be released on CD in March 1992, but things went awry. The CDs never turned up on time for the album launch, forcing them to give away copies of the album on cassettes to keep the audience happy. It was not until the end of 1992 that the band finally got their hands on the elusive CDs. By this time Custard had signed to Ra Records and had released their first &quot;major label&quot; release, an EP called &quot;Gastanked&quot;. &quot;Gastanked&quot; was followed in 1993 by another EP, &quot;Brisbane&quot;, and two singles, &quot;Casanova&quot; and &quot;Singlette&quot;. By this time the band was onto its third drummer. Shane Brunn had been replaced by Gavin Herrenberg, who had subsequently been replaced by Danny Plant.

===1994–1995: &quot;Wahooti Fandango&quot; and &quot;Wisenheimer&quot;===

Custard&#x27;s debut major label album &quot;Wahooti Fandango&quot; was issued in 1994. The video for the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Aloha Tambourinist&quot;, was set on a beach, featured male models pretending to be Custard, while scantily clad women roll around in the sand.

&quot;Wahooti Fandango&quot; was critically acclaimed, and at the ARIA Music Awards of 1995 was nominated for Best Alternative Release.

The band&#x27;s &quot;breakthrough hit&quot; did not come until October 1995, when they released &quot;Apartment&quot;, the first single lifted from their third studio album, &quot;Wisenheimer&quot;. &quot;Apartment&quot; received a high rotation airplay on triple j, and was voted in at number 7 in the Triple J Hottest 100, 1995. &quot;Wisenheimer&quot; was recorded in San Francisco, being produced by Eric Drew Feldman (Captain Beefheart, PJ Harvey, Pere Ubu et al.). The album also spawned the singles &quot;Sunset Strip&quot;, &quot;Lucky Star&quot; and &quot;Leisuremaster&quot;.

After &quot;Wisenheimer&quot;, Danny Plant was replaced by Glenn Thompson.

===1996–1999: &quot;We Have the Technology&quot; and &quot;Loverama&quot;===
On 24 November 1996, Custard performed on the forecourt of the Sydney Opera House as part of Crowded House&#x27;s &quot;Farewell to the World&quot; concert, alongside You Am I and Powderfinger. Estimates of the audience in attendance range from 100,000 to 250,000 people.

1996 and 1997 were big years for the band, touring Australia with Weezer, Frank Black, Beck and the Presidents of the USA, and venturing back to America (where &quot;Wisenheimer&quot; had been recorded) to play more shows with the Presidents. While in the USA the band also recorded album number 4, &quot;We Have the Technology&quot;.

&quot;Nice Bird&quot; was the first single to be lifted from &quot;We Have the Technology&quot;, followed by &quot;Anatomically Correct&quot;. However, it was the final single, &quot;Music is Crap&quot;, that captured the public&#x27;s attention and became their first single to peak within the ARIA top 100. The song was written and sung by Thompson, and reinvigorated public interest in Custard.

The next single, &quot;Girls Like That (Don&#x27;t Go For Guys Like Us)&quot;, became the band&#x27;s biggest hit. It peaked at #52 on the ARIA singles chart, and came in at 3 in the Triple J Hottest 100, 1998. At the ARIA Music Awards of 1999 they won Best Video for Andrew Lancaster and David McCormack. The album that it was featured on, &quot;Loverama&quot;, went on to become the band&#x27;s most commercially successful.

Custard went on a six-month &quot;hiatus&quot; at the end of 1999, before eventually disbanding.

===2000–2008: Dissolution of the band, and other projects===
After the split, lead singer and guitarist, McCormack, formed The Titanics with drummer, Thompson, also on guitar. Joining them were McCormack&#x27;s then-wife, Emma Tom, on bass and Tina Havelock-Stevens on drums. The Titanics did not last long, releasing two albums, &quot;Size Isn&#x27;t Everything&quot; and &quot;Love is the Devil&quot;, before the group disbanded.

McCormack released a series of solo albums with The Polaroids, featuring his brother Dylan (Gentle Ben and his Sensitive Side) on bass, Shane Melder (ex-Sidewinder) on drums and Cameron Bruce (Paul Kelly). Releases include &quot;Candy&quot; (2002), &quot;Save Dave&quot; DVD (2003), &quot;The Truth About Love&quot; (2004) and &quot;Little Murders&quot; (2009).

In 2004, Strong joined the Lost Gospel, alongside Phil Jamieson of Grinspoon. The group released one album.

Thompson joined The Go-Betweens in 2001, having previously played with Robert Forster and Grant McLennan in 1995. In addition to appearing on many of Forster&#x27;s solo albums, Thompson played on The Go-Betweens&#x27; final two albums, &quot;Bright Yellow Bright Orange&quot; and &quot;Oceans Apart&quot;; and toured with the band until McLennan&#x27;s death in 2006. Thompson then released his first solo album, &quot;Brighton Bothways&quot;, under the name &quot;Beachfield&quot; in 2007. In 2010, Thompson formed a duo with Adele Pickvance from The Go-Betweens, called Adele &amp; Glenn, and launched a debut album in April 2012.

A DVD video clip compilation called &quot;The Spaces at the Side of the Road – A Digital History of Custard&quot; was released in 2007.

In 2008, Medew was a member of The Purple Hearts.

===2009–2011: Reformation===

Custard reformed for an event on 10 December 2009 to celebrate Queensland&#x27;s 150th birthday, appearing alongside Powderfinger and a number of other local acts.

Since reforming, the band have played one or two gigs per year. In 2010 they appeared at the Meredith Music Festival. They also performed as a headliner act for &quot;Float On: A Brisbane Flood Relief Benefit&quot; in February 2011, a show to raise money for the victims of the floods in Queensland. In 2011 Custard were featured as part of the Brisbane Festival.

===2015–2019: &quot;Come Back, All Is Forgiven&quot; and &quot;The Common Touch&quot;===
Custard released their first album of new material since 1999&#x27;s &quot;Loverama&quot;, on 6 November 2015, entitled &quot;Come Back, All Is Forgiven&quot;, through ABC Music.

In 2017, Custard released &quot;The Common Touch&quot;, featuring the singles &quot;In the Grand Scheme of Things&quot; and &quot;2000 Woman&quot;.

In August 2018, to promote a short tour the group undertook that September, the group released &quot;The Band: Live in the Basement&quot;, a recording of a concert performed on 9 November 2017 at the Basement club in Sydney.

=== 2020–present: &quot;Respect All Lifeforms&quot; and &quot;Suburban Curtains&quot; ===
On 19 March 2020, Custard released the new single &quot;Funky Again&quot;, and announced their eighth studio album &quot;Respect All Lifeforms&quot;.
The album was released on 22 May.

In September 2023, Custard announced on their social media pages that pre-production on a new album has started. 15 August 2024 saw the release of a new single, &quot;Molecules Colliding&quot;, announced as the first single off the band&#x27;s ninth album, &quot;Suburban Curtains&quot;, with a supporting tour to follow in November 2024.

<text>Fu Daqing (), alias Fu Dajing (), was a Chinese Communist propagandist, translator and organiser who worked for the Communist cause before his capture and execution by the Imperial Japanese Army during World War II. He is also the father of Dai Qing (), a leading activist. 

Fu Daqing was born in 1900 in Linchuan, Jiangxi province. Having lost his father at an early age, the young Daqing was brought up by his mother, a school teacher. After graduating from a missionary-run high school with fluency in English, he travelled to Shanghai to continue his education. In Shanghai, he read the newspaper &quot;New Youth&quot; and met Chen Duxiu, co-founder of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Whilst learning Russian at the Institute of Foreign Languages, Fu joined the Socialist Youth Brigade of China in 1920. 

The next year he travelled by sea to study at the Eastern University in Moscow with Liu Shaoqi and others. In Moscow Fu took the Russian name Federov and later joined the CCP. In the summer of 1924, after returning from Moscow, Fu worked for Sun Yatsen&#x27;s government in Guangdong as a translator for the Soviet agent Mikhail Borodin. He was active at the Whampoa Military Academy and first participated in military operations in 1925. The following year Fu joined the Northern Expedition. After the abortive Nanchang Uprising, Fu Daqing returned to his native Linchuan to engage in propaganda work among the people. In December 1927, he participated in a failed Communist uprising in Guangzhou, after which he fled to Hong Kong. Fu went on to visit Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia, Burma and the Philippines. On 29 April 1930 Fu Daqing co-founded the South Seas Communist Party (predecessor to the Communist parties of Indochina, Malaya and Siam) with Ho Chi Minh and eighteen others. Later he became a propaganda officer for the party, co-editing &quot;The Malayan Worker&quot;. The British authorities had him arrested and deported back to China, where he was imprisoned firstly at Guangzhou and then at Shanghai by the Kuomintang. 

At the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War, he was released from gaol. Fu Daqing made his way to Wuhan where he worked for the Communist Eighth Route Army. After the fall of Wuhuan in 1938 he moved to Guiyang and Guilin to engage in anti-Japanese propaganda. Later he moved to Yan&#x27;an, where he translated Carl von Clausewitz&#x27;s classic treatise &quot;On War&quot; into Chinese, receiving praise from CCP commanders Zhu De and Ye Jianying. In 1940 Fu Daqing met Yang Jie (), a female colleague in Chongqing, and the two began living together. The couple married on New Year&#x27;s Day 1941. In June 1941 he was dispatched by the Central Committee to Beiping to engage in propaganda activities and underground communication with the Comintern. Two months later, Yang Jie gave birth to a daughter, Dai Qing. The family was reunited at the end of the year in Beiping.

On July 23, 1944, both Fu and his wife were captured by the Imperial Japanese Army. He was executed sometime before the end of World War II. The CCP only learned of this from captured Japanese archives. Having held no official position in the CCP, Fu Daqing is best remembered for his expertise in linguistics. He spoke English, Russian, Malay as well as a number of Chinese dialects, including Cantonese and Hainanese. Fu&#x27;s daughter Dai Qing was later adopted by his good friend Ye Jianying.

<doc id="1114567" wikidata="Q915654" url="?curid=1114567" title="Flexible single master operation">
<text>Flexible Single Master Operations (FSMO, F is sometimes &quot;floating&quot;; pronounced Fiz-mo), or just single master operation or operations master, is a feature of Microsoft&#x27;s Active Directory (AD). As of 2005, the term FSMO has been deprecated in favour of operations masters.

FSMO is a specialized domain controller (DC) set of tasks, used where standard data transfer and update methods are inadequate. AD normally relies on multiple peer DCs, each with a copy of the AD database, being synchronized by multi-master replication. The tasks which are not suited to multi-master replication and are viable only with a single-master database are the FSMOs.

== FSMO roles ==

===Per-domain roles===
These roles are applicable at the domain level (i.e., there is one of each for every domain in a forest):

* The PDC Emulator (Primary Domain Controller) - This role is the most used of all FSMO roles and has the widest range of functions. The domain controller that holds the PDC Emulator role is crucial in a mixed environment where Windows NT 4.0 BDCs are still present. This is because the PDC Emulator role emulates the functions of a Windows NT 4.0 PDC. Even if all Windows NT 4.0 domain controllers have been migrated to Windows 2000 or later, the domain controller that holds the PDC Emulator role still does a lot. The PDC Emulator is the domain source for time synchronization for all other domain controllers; in a multi-domain forest, the PDC Emulator in each domain synchronizes to the forest root PDC Emulator. All other domain member computers synchronize to their respective domain controllers. It is critically important that computer clocks are synchronized across the forest because excessive clock skew causes Kerberos authentication to fail. In addition, all password changes occur on the PDC Emulator and receive priority replication.
* The RID Master - (Relative ID) This FSMO role owner is the single DC responsible for processing RID Pool requests from all DCs within a given domain. It is also responsible for moving an object from one domain to another during an interdomain object move. When a DC creates a security principal object such as a user or group, it attaches a unique SID to the object. This SID consists of a domain SID (the same for all SIDs created in a domain) and a relative ID (RID) that is unique for each security principal SID created in a domain. Each DC in a domain is allocated a pool of RIDs that it is allowed to assign to the security principals it creates. When a DC&#x27;s allocated RID pool falls below a threshold, that DC issues a request for additional RIDs to the domain&#x27;s RID Master FSMO role owner, the RID Master FSMO role owner responds to the request by retrieving RIDs from the domain&#x27;s unallocated RID pool and assigns them to the pool of the requesting DC.
* The Infrastructure Master - The purpose of this role is to ensure that cross-domain object references are correctly handled. For example, if a user from one domain is added to a security group from a different domain, the Infrastructure Master makes sure this is done properly. However, if the Active Directory deployment has only a single domain, then the Infrastructure Master role does no work at all, and even in a multi-domain environment it is rarely used except when complex user administration tasks are performed. This applies to the domain partition (default naming context) only. and will only query the domain partition. However, every application partition, including Forest and Domain-level DNS domain zones has its own Infrastructure Master. The holder of this role is stored in the attribute of the object in the root of the partition, it can be modified with , for example one can modify the attribute of the object to .

===Per-forest roles===
These roles are unique at the forest level (both are located in the forest root domain):

* The Schema Master - The purpose of this role is to replicate schema changes to all other domain controllers in the forest. Since the schema of Active Directory is rarely changed, however, the Schema Master role will rarely do any work. This role is typically involved in the deployment of Exchange Server and Skype for Business Server, as well as domain controllers from one version to another version, as all of these situations involve making changes to the Active Directory schema.
* The Domain Naming Master - The other forest-specific FSMO role is the Domain Naming Master, and this role also resides in the forest root domain. The Domain Naming Master role processes all changes to the namespace, for example adding the child domain vancouver.mycompany.com to the forest root domain mycompany.com requires that this role be available. Failure of this role to function correctly can prevent the addition of a new child domain or new domain tree.

== Moving FSMO roles between domain controllers ==

By default AD assigns all operations master roles to the first DC created in a forest. To provide fault tolerance, there should be multiple domain controllers available within each domain of the Forest. If new domains are created in the forest, the first DC in a new domain holds all of the domain-wide FSMO roles. This is not a satisfactory position if the domain has a large number of domain controllers. Microsoft recommends the careful division of FSMO roles, with standby DCs ready to take over each role. The PDC emulator and the RID master should be on the same DC, if possible. The Schema Master and Domain Naming Master should also be on the same DC.

When a FSMO role is transferred to a different DC, the original FSMO holder and the new FSMO holder communicate to ensure no data is lost during the transfer. If the original FSMO holder experienced an unrecoverable failure, another DC can be made to &quot;seize&quot; the lost roles; however, there is a risk of data loss because of the lack of communications. Seizing roles from a domain controller instead of transferring it prevents that domain controller from hosting that FSMO role again, except for the PDC Emulator and Infrastructure Master Operation roles. Corruption can occur within Active Directory. FSMO roles can be easily moved between DCs using the AD snap-ins to the MMC or using codice_1, which is a command line-based tool.

== FSMO Roles and Global Catalog ==

Certain FSMO roles depend on the DC being a Global Catalog (GC) server as well. When a Forest is initially created, the first Domain Controller is a Global Catalog server by default. The Global Catalog provides several functions. The GC stores object data information, manages queries of these data objects and their attributes as well as provides data to allow network logon.

Often all domain controllers are also global catalog servers. If this is not the case, the Infrastructure Master role must not be housed on a domain controller which also houses a copy of the global catalog in a multi-domain forest, as the combination of these two roles on the same host will cause unexpected (and potentially damaging) behaviour in a multi-domain environment. However, The Domain Naming Master role should be housed on a DC which is also a GC.

<doc id="1114570" wikidata="Q306351" url="?curid=1114570" title="John O'Shea">
<text>John Francis O&#x27;Shea (; born 30 April 1981) is an Irish professional football coach and former player. He was known for his versatility in playing several defensive and midfield positions on either side of the pitch or the centre. O&#x27;Shea spent the majority of his playing career at Manchester United, where he won five Premier League titles, one FA Cup, two Football League Cups, four FA Community Shields, the FIFA Club World Cup and the UEFA Champions League. With 14 winners&#x27; medals, he is one of the most decorated Irish footballers of all time; only Denis Irwin, Roy Keane, Steve Heighway and Ronnie Whelan have accrued more honours.

Born in County Waterford and growing up in Ferrybank, O&#x27;Shea joined Manchester United when he was 17. He spent loan spells at AFC Bournemouth and Royal Antwerp before establishing himself in the Manchester United first team, going on to make 393 appearances and scoring 15 times in all competitions across 12 seasons. He joined Sunderland in July 2011. Having played 256 times for the Wearside club and scoring four goals, he signed for Championship side Reading in July 2018. Retiring in May 2019, he joined that club&#x27;s coaching staff that summer, before leaving in the summer of 2021. He then coached at Stoke City and Birmingham City.

O&#x27;Shea made his Republic of Ireland debut in 2001 against Croatia and made 118 appearances for his national team over the next 17 years, scoring three goals, his first in 2003 against Australia. He was part of the team that controversially lost to France in a play-off for the 2010 FIFA World Cup and went on to play in UEFA Euro 2012 and UEFA Euro 2016. He then served as assistant manager on the under-21 and senior teams, as well as interim manager of the latter in 2024.

==Club career==
===Manchester United===
====1999–2006====
Prior to joining the Manchester United academy, O&#x27;Shea played for Ferrybank AFC and Waterford Bohemians. He signed professional forms at the age of 17 and made his professional debut on 13 October 1999 against Aston Villa at Villa Park in a 3–0 Football League Cup defeat.

In January 2000, O&#x27;Shea was loaned to AFC Bournemouth in the Football League Second Division. He played 11 total games for the Cherries and scored once in the third minute of a 3–1 loss at Millwall on 19 February. After a loan to Belgian side Royal Antwerp, he returned to Manchester and began to feature in the United first team in the 2002–03 season, demonstrating versatility by playing at left-back, right-back, centre-back and central midfield during the successful 2002–03 Premier League campaign.

In 2003–04, United were without Rio Ferdinand after he began a suspension for missing a drugs test in January, and O&#x27;Shea took over from Ferdinand in central defence, helping United reach the FA Cup final where they triumphed 3–0 over Millwall.

He displayed indifferent form in the 2004–05 season and was linked with a move away from Manchester, with Newcastle United and Liverpool being linked with the Irishman. One of the highlights of Manchester United&#x27;s otherwise slightly disappointing season was the 4–2 away victory against Arsenal, in which O&#x27;Shea scored the fourth goal by chipping Arsenal goalkeeper Manuel Almunia from the edge of the 18-yard box.

An injury to Gary Neville in the 2005–06 season also gave O&#x27;Shea more first-team opportunities. He was criticised for his lacklustre performances that season, and was reportedly one of the players lambasted by United veteran Roy Keane in a controversial interview on the club&#x27;s MUTV channel.

====2007–2011====
On 4 February 2007, during a league game against Tottenham Hotspur, O&#x27;Shea deputised for Edwin van der Sar in goal after Van der Sar was taken off the pitch for a broken nose, while Manchester United had already used all three substitutes. During this time, he denied his Republic of Ireland teammate Robbie Keane a goal with a save a few minutes before full-time. Following this incident, United fans chanted &quot;Ireland&#x27;s number one&quot; in O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s honour.

A month later, he won over many United fans by scoring a stoppage-time winner against Liverpool at Anfield for United in the league, having come on as a substitute for Wayne Rooney. This goal was important in United going on to regain the Premier League trophy for the 2006–07 season. He also rescued his team against Everton in one of the final games of the season, when he bundled the ball into the net after Everton goalkeeper Iain Turner fumbled a Ryan Giggs corner. United went on to win 4–2. This was perhaps an even more decisive goal, as Bolton Wanderers were drawing with Chelsea at the same time and defeat would have let Chelsea back into the title race. He scored another goal from close range, in a 2–1 defeat away to Portsmouth that season, this goal came during an injury-hit part of the season, where O&#x27;Shea, as a versatile player, was required to play at full-back. O&#x27;Shea had a shooting accuracy of 100% and scored with 80% of his shots in the 2006–07 season.

During the 2007–08 season, Manchester United used O&#x27;Shea as an emergency striker due to injury problems. His use as a striker gave him the distinction of having played in every position for Manchester United. In November 2007, O&#x27;Shea extended his contract at Manchester United, to keep him at the club until 2012. Throughout the 2007–08 season, O&#x27;Shea came off the bench several times as United won a Premier League and Champions League double. O&#x27;Shea captained his club for the first time during a 2–0 home defeat to Coventry City in the League Cup Fourth Round.

Throughout the 2008–09 season, O&#x27;Shea became a regular within the team, deputising at right-back because of injuries to Gary Neville and Wes Brown. On 20 January 2009, O&#x27;Shea scored his first goal of the season against Derby County in the second leg of the League Cup semi-final. O&#x27;Shea then started the 2009 Football League Cup final, before being replaced by Nemanja Vidić on 76 minutes, United won the game 4–1 on penalties. On 29 April 2009, O&#x27;Shea scored the only goal of the game in the first leg of the Champions League semi-final against Arsenal, this set United up to go on and win in the second leg by 4–1 on aggregate. O&#x27;Shea started and played the full 90 minutes in the 2009 Champions League final 2–0 loss to Barcelona, and by many accounts was one of United&#x27;s better performers on the night. Sir Alex Ferguson had promised O&#x27;Shea, who was an unused substitute in the 2008 Champions League final, a starting place in the 2009 final for his contribution to the team that season.

O&#x27;Shea captained United for the second time against Birmingham City in their first game of the 2009–10 Premier League season. On his 350th appareance he scored his first league goal in over two years against Stoke City on 29 September 2009, a header in a 2–0 win. He captained the team for the third time in the second leg of United&#x27;s 2010–11 UEFA Champions League semi-final victory over Schalke 04, but was not named in the squad for the final. O&#x27;Shea made 393 total appearances for Manchester United.

===Sunderland===
On 7 July 2011, O&#x27;Shea signed a four-year contract with Sunderland, managed by former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce, who paid Manchester United an undisclosed fee for O&#x27;Shea. In his first appearance for Sunderland, a friendly against Arminia Bielefeld, O&#x27;Shea picked up a hamstring injury, ruling him out for the rest of pre-season and the start of the 2011–12 campaign. O&#x27;Shea made his first competitive appearance for Sunderland on 27 August 2011 in a goalless draw against Swansea.

O&#x27;Shea scored his first Sunderland goal at the Stadium of Light in the 2012–13 season in a 2–1 loss to Tottenham Hotspur.

At the end of the 2016–17 season, which ended in Sunderland&#x27;s relegation, O&#x27;Shea&#x27;s contract had initially expired. However, the Irishman agreed to sign a one-year contract lasting until July 2018.

O&#x27;Shea scored his first club goal for more than four years to help Sunderland clinch a 4–1 away win over Derby County to move off the bottom of the Championship table on 30 March 2018. At the end of the season, O&#x27;Shea suffered a second consecutive relegation with Sunderland as the team finished in last place.

===Reading===
On 6 June 2018, O&#x27;Shea agreed terms on a one-year deal with Championship club Reading. He would link up with his compatriot David Meyler who had signed for the Berkshire club a day earlier.

O&#x27;Shea made his Reading debut on 14 August 2018, coming on as an 82nd-minute substitute for Yakou Méïté in a 2–0 home win against Birmingham City in the EFL Cup. He made his league debut for the club on 22 September in a 3–0 home victory over Hull City in a match which he received a straight red card for a foul on Chris Martin.

O&#x27;Shea announced his retirement from football on 30 April 2019, his 38th birthday, and made his final career appearance five days later in a goalless draw at home to Birmingham City where he received a guard of honour from both sets of players.

==International career==
O&#x27;Shea earned his first senior cap for the Republic of Ireland on 15 August 2001, when manager Mick McCarthy sent him on as an 84th-minute substitute for Gary Kelly in a friendly against Croatia at Lansdowne Road. He gave away a penalty for handball in injury time, which was scored by Davor Šuker for a 2–2 draw. He was not included in the Irish squad for the 2002 FIFA World Cup. On 19 August 2003, O&#x27;Shea scored his first international goal as he headed in Ireland&#x27;s first in a 2–1 home friendly victory over Australia.

During the 2010 World Cup qualifying, O&#x27;Shea was ever present in the starting line-up for eight of the 10 games. On 1 April 2009, in the game against Italy, he was elbowed in the forehead by Giampaolo Pazzini, who earned the record for the fastest sending off in Italian football history. After receiving treatment for the bleeding, O&#x27;Shea continued playing all 90 minutes.
Including the second leg of their play-off victory over Estonia, made nine appearances in UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying, as Ireland reached the continental tournament for the first time since 1988. He played every minute of their finals campaign, a group stage elimination after three defeats. On 15 August 2012, his 80th cap, O&#x27;Shea captained Ireland for the first time, in a goalless friendly draw against Serbia at the Red Star Stadium in Belgrade. On 15 October 2013, he opened a 3–1 World Cup qualifying victory over Kazakhstan at the Aviva Stadium, his second international goal and the first in over a decade.

O&#x27;Shea was scheduled to face Spain on 11 June 2013 at Yankee Stadium in New York, but was ruled out of the game over the sudden death of his uncle Jimmy O&#x27;Leary. On 14 October 2014, on his 100th cap, O&#x27;Shea scored the equalising goal with the last kick of the match, in a 1–1 draw against Germany at Gelsenkirchen, in a UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying match. In the final qualifier, a 2–1 defeat away to Poland on 11 October 2015, he was sent off for a foul on Robert Lewandowski and thus missed the first leg of the Republic&#x27;s play-off.

O&#x27;Shea was selected in manager Martin O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s 23-man squad for UEFA Euro 2016 in France. In the absence of Robbie Keane, he captained the Irish in their first two group matches, a 1–1 draw with Sweden and a 3–0 loss to Belgium. He was one of several players who lost their starting place for the decisive final game against Italy, as he and defensive partner Ciaran Clark made way for Shane Duffy and Richard Keogh; the game ended with a 1–0 victory. In the last 16, as Ireland lost 2–1 to the hosts at Parc Olympique Lyonnais, O&#x27;Shea entered as a 68th-minute substitute for James McClean.

Over a year after his penultimate game for Ireland, O&#x27;Shea played his final of 118 matches on 2 June 2018, a 2–1 friendly win over the United States at the Aviva Stadium. After 34 minutes, he was substituted to widespread applause as debutant Darragh Lenihan came onto the pitch. Before the game, he was congratulated by the President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, who called him &quot;one of the most inspirational, committed and admired members of our national teams&quot;.

==Coaching career ==
In April 2020, O&#x27;Shea was named as assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland under-21 team under manager Jim Crawford.

On 22 July 2022, O&#x27;Shea joined Stoke City as first-team coach. He was one of 20 coaches who successfully completed their UEFA Pro Licence course with the Football Association of Ireland (FAI) in December 2022. O&#x27;Shea left his role at Stoke on 12 May 2023.

On 22 February 2023, O&#x27;Shea was named assistant manager of the Republic of Ireland senior team, under manager Stephen Kenny. He left in November after Kenny&#x27;s contract ended.

When Wayne Rooney was appointed manager of EFL Championship club Birmingham City in October 2023, O&#x27;Shea joined his staff as a first-team coach. He left by mutual consent at his own request a few days after Rooney&#x27;s sacking in January 2024.

On 28 February 2024, O&#x27;Shea was named as interim manager of the senior Republic of Ireland team for the March friendlies against Belgium and Switzerland, while the Football Association of Ireland continued their search for a permanent manager. He continued as interim manager for the friendlies against Hungary and Portugal in June. His debut on 23 March was a goalless draw at home to Belgium, with Evan Ferguson missing a penalty.

In August 2024, O&#x27;Shea was appointed assistant coach of the Republic of Ireland team under new manager Heimir Hallgrimsson.

==Personal life==
O&#x27;Shea married his long-term partner, Yvonne Manning, in the Lady Chapel in Maynooth, County Kildare, Ireland on 8 June 2010. They have a son and a daughter.

<text>Péter Esterházy (14 April 1950 – 14 July 2016) was a Hungarian writer. He was one of the best known Hungarian and Central European writers of his era. He was called a &quot;leading figure of 20th century Hungarian literature&quot;, and his books were considered to be significant contributions to post-war literature.

==Biography==
Esterházy was born in Budapest on 14 April 1950, the eldest son of Mátyás Esterházy de Galántha (1919–1998) (Count Esterházy until 1947, when all titles and ranks were abolished) and Magdolna Mányoki (1916–1980). His paternal grandfather was Count Móric Esterházy (1881–1960), who briefly served as Prime Minister of Hungary in 1917. Through his paternal grandmother Countess Margit Károlyi (1896–1975), one of his ancestors was Count Gyula Károlyi (1871–1947), also Prime Minister from 1931 to 1932. Péter had three younger brothers, including international football player Márton Esterházy (born 1956).

Esterházy was educated as a mathematician and began to write in the 1970s. He is perhaps best known outside of his native country for &quot;Celestial Harmonies&quot; (&quot;Harmonia Caelestis&quot;, 2001) which chronicles his forefathers&#x27; epic rise during the Austro-Hungarian empire to their dispossession under communism. His next novel, &quot;Revised Edition&quot; or &quot;Corrected Version&quot; (&quot;Javított kiadás&quot;, 2002), which appeared as an appendix to the former work, deals with his realisation that his father was an informant for the secret police during the communist era.

After the regime change in 1989, Péter Esterházy refused to accept the return of any land or valuables nationalized by the communists.

Many of his other works also deal with the experience of living under a communist regime and in a post-communist country. He wrote in a style that can be characterised as postmodernist and his prose was described by John Updike as &quot;jumpy, allusive, and slangy. ...there is vividness, an electric crackle. The sentences are active and concrete. Physical details leap from the murk of emotional ambivalence&quot;. In an obituary published by Reuters, his literary technique is described as &quot;Employing a stop-and-go rhythm, his writing concentrated on twists and surprises rather than straight narrative lines, combining personal experiences with references, quotes and all shades of jokes from sarcasm to toilet humor, sometimes including texts of other authors.&quot;

His works have been published in more than 20 languages. He was awarded several literary distinctions in Hungary, including the prestigious Kossuth Prize in 1996, and has received awards for his work in France, Austria, Germany, Slovenia and Poland.

He was highly critical of the authoritarian tendencies of Viktor Orbán&#x27;s administration, declaring that &quot;Orbán is not a statesman&quot; and that &quot;the Orbán system is damaging to Hungary. Our Democracy is not liberal, freedom of the press is limited, and the division of power is inadequate.&quot;

He was married to Margit Reén, and had four children.

In October 2015, it became public knowledge that he was suffering from pancreatic cancer. He died on 14 July 2016.

<doc id="1114577" wikidata="Q518180" url="?curid=1114577" title="Parking enforcement officer">
<text>A parking enforcement officer (PEO), traffic warden (British English), parking inspector/parking officer (Australia and New Zealand), or civil enforcement officer is a member of a traffic control agency, local government, or police force who issues tickets for parking violations. The term parking attendant is sometimes considered a synonym but sometimes used to refer to the different profession of parking lot attendant.

In the United States, even where parking meters are no longer used, the term &quot;meter maid&quot; is often still used to refer to female PEOs.

==Other duties==

On 9 December 2007, the mayor of Stockholm, Mikael Söderlund, announced that the tasks of the parking enforcement officers will be broadened to include fining graffiti vandals and litterers. Trade union representatives say these officers are not prepared to take on new tasks, already stretched by metering vehicles, and that they fear the risk of violence. Those authorities in England that invested in vehicles with onboard computer and camera equipment have also begun policing bus lanes.

With the combination of the role of parking attendants in some areas of Great Britain into that of civil enforcement officers, many now routinely issue fixed penalties for such offences as littering, public drinking, anti-social behaviour and noise violations in addition to dealing with nuisance parking offences which previously escaped the attention of parking attendants as they contravened legislation other than the Road Traffic Act 1991. Nevertheless, the National Careers Service does not list any of these new tasks. Parking wardens in New Zealand are also empowered by law to enforce the use of special vehicle lanes, such as bus and transit lanes.

==By country==
=== Canada ===

In Canada, parking enforcement duties are frequently handled under the umbrella of bylaw enforcement by bylaw enforcement officers. No jurisdictions remain where persons employed for the purpose of enforcing traffic bylaws are referred to as &quot;meter maids&quot; and increasingly fewer offices of &quot;parking enforcement officer&quot; exist. Most officials once employed as PEOs are now utilized to perform a variety of bylaw enforcement duties, often including animal control or the enforcement of other bylaws. The position is increasingly upgraded to that of the more professional position of bylaw enforcement officer. Common duties of bylaw enforcement officers include parking enforcement, property and zoning regulation, and regulation of general conduct of persons in public. Bylaw officers, however, only have the power to issue civil citations as such as penalties for most municipal bylaw violations.

The cities of Montreal, Toronto and Vancouver still employ officials with the title of parking enforcement officer. In the case of Montreal and Toronto, PEOs are a sub-division of their respective police force : the Montreal SPVM (where they are nicknamed &quot;green onions&quot; due to their formerly green uniforms) and the Toronto Police Service (where they have been nicknamed &#x27;blue hornets&#x27; because of their blue uniform stripe, which is red on police officers&#x27; uniforms). In Vancouver&#x27;s case, PEOs are employees of the municipal government, not affiliated with the Vancouver Police Department.

Canadian parking enforcement officers are &quot;de facto&quot; peace officers while in the performance of their duties and inasmuch as that designation is required for the performance of their duties, even if they are not sworn officers or constables. Case law has upheld this legal interpretation. See bylaw enforcement officer for case-law excerpts. This means that assault on a Canadian parking enforcement officer or bylaw officer conducting traffic bylaw enforcement is punishable under the Criminal Code of Canada as assault on a peace officer and carries higher penalties than standard assault.

In some areas in Canada, parking enforcement services are subcontracted to a private organization, such as the Canadian Corps of Commissionaires. However these facilities are usually privately owned parking lots and garage. Although some large municipalities have long standing agreements.

Toronto is deploying traffic wardens to help with congestion at major intersections in the city beginning in early 2018. Their focus is to expedite flow of cars and pedestrians at problem intersections, where they will replace use of Toronto police officers in the same role.

===Indonesia===

In Indonesia, traffic wardens or also known as parking enforcement officers are under the Ministry of Transportation and are known as &quot;Dinas Perhubungan&quot; abbreviated &quot;Dishub&quot; or &quot;Dinas Lalu Lintas dan Angkutan Jalan Raya&quot; abbreviated &quot;LLAJR&quot; (Road Traffic and Transportation Agency). Besides enforcing parking regulations, they also assist the traffic police in directing traffic and enforce law and regulations towards public transportation vehicles such as public buses, taxis, trucks, etc. which use yellow license plates. They are usually stationed in public transportation terminals and posted at various roadways of the country and wear light blue as their uniform.

=== Ireland ===
In the Republic of Ireland, parking enforcement officers are employed by councils to enforce laws relating to the parking and stopping of motor vehicles. They were introduced by the Local Authorities (Traffic Wardens) Act 1975. Under the Road Traffic Acts, traffic wardens are empowered to issue on the spot parking tickets and fines for non-display of a tax disc. It is an offence to refuse to provide your name and address when demanded to do so by a traffic warden.

=== New Zealand ===
In New Zealand, a local authority may appoint a person to hold the office of parking warden. Parking wardens have jurisdiction on a public road within the local authority&#x27;s region, and are warranted upon appointment to enforce parking offences and special vehicle lane offences. The fines for various parking offences are considerably lower than many other places around the world, with fines as low as $12 for minor offences. However, abuse and violence against officers is common, resulting in some councils adopting body worn cameras for them. Parking wardens may direct people to remove their vehicle off a public road if it causes an obstruction on the road or to any vehicle entrance, or if it is desirable in the interests of road safety or the interests of the Public. They can also (for the reasons just mentioned) authorize the towing of vehicles on a public road. Similar to Ireland, it is an offence in certain circumstances if the driver or person in charge of a vehicle refuses to provide their details when required to do so by a parking warden.

The term &#x27;parking warden&#x27; is considered to be a misnomer, as they deal with matters more than just parking, especially as the law also empowers them to enforce certain moving violations, such as unauthorised use of a special vehicle lane.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom (UK), traffic wardens have historically, since the 1960s, been employed by the territorial police force to help with traffic management and parking regulations. Their origins in the UK can be traced back to the work of Athelstan Popkess who in 1959 proposed the idea of &quot;a body of men, eager for police work, but barred by height or age to deal with trifling motoring offences like illegal parking and obstruction&quot; to the Home Secretary Ernest Marples and his professional colleagues. He took the idea from a scheme already in existence in South Africa.

Now &#x27;Parking Attendants&#x27; and &#x27;Civil Enforcement Officers&#x27; are used by local authorities to pursue decriminalised parking enforcement and thus almost everywhere replaced the &quot;traffic warden&quot;, who was part of a police force.

====Public perception====
Accusations of overzealousness on the part of parking attendants is likely due to high pressure management focused around delivering a certain number of tickets per day, leading to allegations of corruption and illegality. This brings accusations that their real purpose is to raise revenue for the local authority rather than keep the traffic moving. Those who receive fines argue that the &quot;punishment does not fit the crime,&quot; pointing to the size of fines levied for minor parking violations in comparison with fines generally issued for more serious motoring offences or other offences such as shoplifting. Public dislike of parking attendants in the UK is such that some parking attendants have been stabbed, received death threats, and been issued stab-proof vests and cotton swabs to take DNA samples when members of the public spit on them, for later prosecution.

&quot;Enforcement of laws dealing with the parking of motor vehicles in the UK can be the responsibility of one or more of the following persons:&quot;

====Public====
*Civil enforcement officers (England, Wales, Scotland), including those previously known as parking attendants (whose duties might still be limited to parking contraventions or might now be extended to other road traffic contraventions where a local authority has chosen to do so), are employed by local authorities or a contractor providing their services to a local authority. Since the advent of decriminalised parking enforcement, they have largely replaced [police] traffic wardens as the primary enforcers of parking regulations. They have the power to issue penalty charge notices (PCNs) for parking contraventions dealt with by ss.63-79 Road Traffic Act 1991; in areas where their duties have been extended beyond that of a parking attendant they can also issue PCNs for parking offences coming under other legislation such as e.g. parking a vehicle entirely on a footway or the parking of a detached vehicle trailer or skip.
*Traffic attendants (Northern Ireland) issue parking offence penalty charge notices (i.e. a civil penalty not a criminal penalty) for the Roads Service using powers under the Traffic Management (Northern Ireland) Order 2005.
*Traffic wardens are employees of police forces and are primarily responsible for controlling traffic in general using powers available to &quot;authorised persons&quot; defined in the Road Traffic Act 1988. Their usage for parking enforcement is far less common since the advent of decriminalised parking enforcement which in many areas transferred the enforcement of offences concerning simple parking in controlled areas to local authorities; other parking offences such as any involving penalty points and/or those not involving the 1991 Act (or equivalent in Northern Ireland) remain enforceable by traffic wardens. Traffic wardens in the Metropolitan Police could be promoted to traffic warden supervisor, traffic warden controller, senior traffic warden controller, and area traffic warden controller. Most &quot;traffic wardens&quot; are now non-existent and have, in almost all areas, been replaced by local authority civil enforcement officers/parking wardens/parking attendants etc.
*Traffic officers of National Highways (England) operate under the Traffic Management Act 2004 and have various powers to deal with vehicles on a &quot;relevant road&quot; (chiefly motorways and trunk roads) which on other roads would be dealt with as parking offences by police or local authorities; this includes the power to remove such vehicles.

The power to deal with a parking offence on a highway generally remains available to a police constable.

====Private====
*Private parking enforcement agents (England and Wales) - landowners and private car park owners within England are increasingly using private parking enforcement companies and individuals to impose &#x27;Parking Charge Notices&#x27; (Often abbreviated to PCN &quot;although not to be confused with Penalty Charge Notices which are issued by Civil enforcement officers&quot;) for infringements such as parking outside marked bays or over staying limited duration.

The British Parking Association (BPA) act as the industry body for parking operators. Landowners and agents who pursue private parking charges through the courts do so on the basis of trespass the BPA issue guidance to facilitate this through the use of onsite signage.

The BPA&#x27;s Approved Operator Scheme Code of Practice (a guide for its members who operate enforcement in private car parks), section 27.1, says that: 

==In popular culture==

The term &#x27;meter maid&#x27; was popularised in The Beatles&#x27; song &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;, in which the male singer, smitten with a female traffic warden, recalls:

:&quot;Standing by a parking meter, when I caught a glimpse of Rita&quot;
:&quot;Filling in a ticket in her little white book.&quot;
:&quot;In a cap, she looked much older,&quot;
:&quot;And the bag across her shoulder&quot;
:&quot;Made her look a little like a military man.&quot;

: &quot;Lovely Rita meter maid,&quot;
: &quot;May I inquire discreetly,&quot;
: &quot;When are you free to take some tea with me?&quot;

On the NBC television comedy series &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In,&quot; cast member Barbara Sharma was often featured as an overzealous meter maid (spelled Metre Made) who would ticket anything from baby carriages to trash cans.

The A&amp;E reality television show &quot;Parking Wars&quot; focuses on parking enforcement.

In the 1984 BBC television drama &quot;Threads&quot;, a deputized traffic warden armed with a Self Loading Rifle is briefly shown keeping watch over an improvised internment camp for looters, following a nuclear strike on Sheffield. The warden&#x27;s bandaged face was used in the promotional material for the film.

In the 2016 Disney animated film &quot;Zootopia&quot; the main character, Judy Hopps, is disappointed to be assigned parking enforcement duties, but decides to excel at her task.

<text>Aureolus (died 809) is traditionally thought to have been the chief of the Franks in the region of Aragón.

Between 798 and 802 the Franks established several positions in the zone: Bahlul Ibn Marzuq revolted in Zaragoza against the central government of Muslim Al-Andalus in 798, and in 800 conquered Huesca from the Banu Salama. General Amrus ibn Yusuf (born in Huesca), sent by the Amir, conquered Zaragoza and Huesca (c. 801). Bahlul fled to Pallars and was killed by his lieutenant Jalaf Ibn Rashid (802), who at the time held Barbitanya (Barbastro). With all this disturbances the Franks established control over Jaca and other castles and designated Aureolus as count of Aragón.

After Aureolus died in 809 the Frankish lobby secured succession for Aznar Galíndez I, but Amrus ibn Yusuf overran the county of Sobrarbe, which was not reconquered by Aznar until 814.

<doc id="1114584" wikidata="Q2695776" url="?curid=1114584" title="Shipbourne">
<text>Shipbourne ( ) is a village and civil parish situated between the towns of Sevenoaks and Tonbridge, in the borough of Tonbridge and Malling in the English county of Kent. In 2020 it was named as the most expensive village in Kent.

It is located in an undulating landscape traversed by the small streams of the River Bourne, set in a clay vale at the foot of the wooded Sevenoaks Greensand Ridge. The landscape is agricultural with dispersed groups of buildings that are almost entirely residential or used for farming purposes.

The dominant characteristics of the historical landscape are thick woodland with smaller, broadleaf coppices with small to medium-sized fields enclosed by traditional boundaries of hedges or chestnut fencing. Earlier removal of some hedgerows has resulted in some larger arable fields; these are often separated by small woodland belts or shaws. The most distinctive landscape feature is The Common, also known as The Green, which is a large, open and dominant space in the centre of the village.
To the south of the village, on each side of the A227 is Hoad Common. Before the last war Hoad Common was an attractive lightly treed open space popular with visitors but is now neglected and is rapidly deteriorating into scrubby woodland.

The parish is situated in the Metropolitan Green Belt and is an area designated as a Special Landscape Area. The central village, including the pub, the church, the village school and The Common, is within a Conservation Area. Much of the village lies within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==The Fairlawne Estate==
The Fairlawne Estate is a 1,000 acre landed-estate which stretches from Shipbourne into neighbouring Plaxtol. It was formerly owned by the Saudi Arabian horse-breeder, Prince Khalid Abdullah.

Vane Family: In Stuart times, the estate was the property of Sir Henry Vane the Elder, Secretary of State to Charles I. Sir Henry was created Lord-Lieutenant of Durham and the family later became one of the leading families in that county too. Sir Henry&#x27;s eldest son, also called Harry and also knighted, became Governor of Massachusetts in 1635. Sir Henry Vane the Younger made valiant attempts to remain on the winning side during the difficult period of the English Civil War, but is probably noted for his inept handling of the aspiration: he had been a Royalist but then became a Roundhead, before switching back to being a Royalist under Charles I. He was executed in London after being reported as being &#x27;too dangerous to live&#x27;. His body lies in the Vane family vault area of the crypt of Shipbourne church in an anthropoid (body shaped) lead shell coffin with many members of the Vane family. His ghost is said to wander the village.

The son of one employee of the Vane family on the estate wrote a 700 verse blank poem about hop-growing. The poet Christopher Smart was born in 1722 at &quot;Fairlawne&quot;, where his father was steward.

Cazalet Family: The Vane family were followed by the Cazalets. In 1880, Edward Cazalet built the church, dedicated to St Giles, plus a public house, originally named &quot;The New Inn&quot; and later renamed &quot;The Chaser&quot;, and several of the cottages which surround The Common. Major Peter Cazalet was the trainer of horses owned by Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Many members of the Cazalet family are commemorated in the church.

== The Village ==
St Giles’ Church: Originally the regarded as a chapel to Tonbridge Parish Church by 1314 the Church belonged to the Knights Hospitallers of St John of Jerusalem. The dedication of the church to St Giles, the patron saint of lepers, beggars and disabled people dates from this period. Jane Austen&#x27;s father, George Austen held the curacy of St Giles church until 1758. The current church building was commissioned by Edward Cazalet in 1879 to replace a much loved but crumbling older building dating from 1722. The new church was built by a local builder, William Allcorn, who used pinnacles from the old church as gateposts for his new house on School Lane.

St Giles&#x27; Church continues to serve as a place of worship, but nowadays also doubles up, every Thursday morning, as the venue for the local farmers&#x27; market. 

Dene Park: Dene Park woods is 250 acres of mixed woodland stretching from Shipbourne Common towards Tonbridge. Now looked after by the forestry commission, it originally formed part of the 650 acre Dene Park Estate; a sporting estate and country house on the outskirts of the village. The equestrian and canine artist F.M. Hollams spent her early years at Dene Park. 

Shipbourne Cricket Club: Established in 1880, Shipbourne CC are one of the oldest village cricket clubs in the county. Originally playing on Shipbourne Common in 1939 the Common was turned over to Agricultural use by the Kent War Agricultural Committee; despite the village warning that nothing would grow on the Common an attempt to grow corn was made. Whilst nothing grew the land was ruined for cricket going forwards.

Following the end of the Second World War, Peter Cazalet asked his gallops manager and Shipbourne Cricket Captain Joe Hills to identify a new home for the Club. Joe identified a field behind St. Giles church at the bottom of Fairlawne Hill where the club play to this day. Shipbourne have 2 Saturday league sides and a friendly XI on Sundays.

Shipbourne Village Hall: Built in 1879, Shipbourne Village hall forms part of a small cottage at the end of the Common and was gifted to the village by the Cazalet family. 

The Wood House: A Grade II listed house, commissioned by Jack and Frankie Donaldson and built on land found for them by Peter Cazalet on the edge of Shipbourne Common. The house was built by the Bauhaus founder Walter Gropius. Thought to be Gropius&#x27; last work in the UK and the only weather-board one; the Wood House was initially mocked by villagers and known as &quot;The Chicken House&quot;, but over the years it has become well-loved local landmark

<text>Joseph Denis Irwin (born 31 October 1965) is an Irish former professional footballer and sports television presenter. Irwin is the joint most successful Irish footballer in history, a record he shares with Ronnie Whelan and fellow Manchester United stalwart Roy Keane, having won 19 trophies in his career.

As a player, he played as a full back from 1983 to 2004. Irwin is best known for his long and successful stint at Manchester United, where he established himself as one of the most important players in a team that won a host of domestic and European trophies from 1990 to 2002, including seven Premier League titles and the UEFA Champions League. He has been regarded by Alex Ferguson as, pound for pound, his greatest ever signing. Earlier in his career he played for Leeds United and then Oldham Athletic, and finished his career with a two-year spell at Wolverhampton Wanderers, the club he supported as a child.

Irwin was capped by the Republic of Ireland national side 56 times, scoring four goals and featuring in the side that reached the second round (last 16) at the 1994 FIFA World Cup.

==Early life==
Irwin was born and raised in Cork, County Cork, and was educated at Togher Boys&#x27; National School and Coláiste Chríost Rí. As a schoolboy, he excelled at both Gaelic football and hurling, and played at Croke Park more than once, on one occasion marking future teammate Niall Quinn.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Irwin began his career with Leeds United in 1983, making 72 appearances in the Second Division, before moving on to Oldham Athletic on a free transfer in 1986. He helped Oldham reach the semi-finals of the FA Cup and the final of the League Cup in 1990 before he was transferred to Manchester United for a fee of £650,000.

===Manchester United===
In 12 years at Old Trafford, he made 296 Premier League appearances and won seven Premier League title medals, as well as two FA Cup winner&#x27;s medals (1994 and 1996), a League Cup winner&#x27;s medal, and UEFA Champions League and European Cup Winners&#x27; Cup honours. He was comfortable in either of the full back positions and an expert at free kicks and penalties, and even in his mid-thirties he was still United&#x27;s first-choice left back in preference to the younger Phil Neville.

He scored a total of 22 league goals for Manchester United, including several penalties. The first of these came on 7 September 1991 in a 3–0 home win over Norwich City in the First Division.

Notable goals came on 26 December 1991, when he scored twice in a 6–3 away league win over his old club Oldham Athletic, and his late winner against Southampton in May 1995 which kept the league title race open until the final match.

Irwin was awarded a testimonial match for Manchester United – played on 16 August 2000 against Manchester City at Old Trafford. Despite testimonials being friendly matches, due to the match being between local rivals it was a physical affair. Irwin went off injured in the 37th minute after a bad challenge by City striker George Weah.

Irwin made his last appearance for Manchester United at Old Trafford against Charlton Athletic on the final day of the 2001–02 Premier League season (11 May 2002), which ended in a 0–0 draw. For his final appearance as a Manchester United player, Alex Ferguson awarded him the captain&#x27;s armband.

=== Wolverhampton Wanderers ===
Irwin joined Wolverhampton Wanderers on a free transfer after the 2001–02 season, coincidentally joining the Black Country club at the same time as his former Manchester United teammate Paul Ince made the move to the West Midlands club, having previously been at Middlesbrough. Irwin scored twice in his first season at Wolves, against Burnley and Grimsby.

After Wolves won promotion to the Premier League in 2003, Irwin was applauded by the Manchester United supporters when he walked onto the pitch at Old Trafford for an early season league match which United won 1–0.

Wolves were relegated at the end of the 2003–04 season, and the 38-year-old Irwin then announced his retirement.

==International career==
Irwin played for the Republic of Ireland national under-19 team that qualified for the 1983 UEFA European Under-18 Championship and the 1984 UEFA European Under-18 Championship. He was capped 56 times for the Republic of Ireland between 1990 and 1999, and scored four goals. His first appearance came on 12 September 1990 (just after his move to Manchester United), when he helped them beat Morocco 1–0 in a friendly at Dalymount Park. He made his competitive international debut on 17 October 1990, when the national side began their UEFA Euro 1992 qualifying campaign with a 5–0 win over Turkey at Lansdowne Road. He scored his first international goal on 29 April 1992 in a friendly against the United States at Lansdowne Road. His final international appearance came on 17 November 1999, at the age of 34, when Republic of Ireland lost to Turkey in the UEFA Euro 2000 qualifying play-off second leg in Bursa.

Irwin made his only international tournament appearance for Republic of Ireland at the 1994 FIFA World Cup in the United States. He started at right back in the team&#x27;s first two group matches; a 1–0 victory against Italy and a 2–1 loss to Mexico. He was then suspended for Republic of Ireland&#x27;s final group game (0–0 draw vs. Norway) and was an unused substitute in the 2–0 loss to the Netherlands in the Round of 16.

==Media career==
Since 2004, Irwin has worked as a presenter on MUTV. Irwin has been involved in coverage of several football tournaments on RTÉ. He is also a columnist with Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Sunday World&quot; newspaper. He contributed to RTÉ Sport&#x27;s coverage of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

==Early life and education==
Bynner was born in Brooklyn, New York, the son of Thomas Edgarton Bynner and the former Annie Louise Brewer. His domineering mother separated from his alcoholic father in December 1888 and moved with her two sons to Connecticut. The father died in 1891, and in 1892 the family moved to Brookline, Massachusetts. Bynner attended Brookline High School and was editor of its literary magazine. He entered Harvard University in 1898, where he was the first member of his class invited to join the student literary magazine, &quot;The Harvard Advocate&quot;, by its editor Wallace Stevens. He was also published in another of Harvard&#x27;s literary journals, &quot;The Harvard Monthly&quot;. His favorite professor was George Santayana. While a student he took on the nickname &quot;Hal&quot; by which his friends would know him for the rest of his life. He enjoyed theater, opera, and symphony performances in Boston, and he became involved in the suffrage movement. He graduated from Harvard with honors in 1902. His first book of poems, &quot;An Ode to Harvard&quot; (later changed to &quot;Young Harvard&quot;), came out in 1907. In 1911 he was the Harvard Phi Beta Kappa Poet.

==New York and New Hampshire==
After a trip to Europe, he took a position at &quot;McClure&#x27;s Magazine&quot; and worked there for four years. He had an opportunity to meet and socialize with many New York writers and artists. He next turned to independent writing and lecturing, living in Cornish, New Hampshire.

In 1916 he and Arthur Davison Ficke, a friend from Harvard, were among the perpetrators of an elaborate literary hoax. They created a purported &quot;Spectrist&quot; school of poets, along the lines of the Imagists, but based in Pittsburgh. &quot;Spectra&quot;, a slim collection, was published under the pseudonyms of Anne Knish (Ficke) and Emanuel Morgan (Bynner). Marjorie Allen Seiffert, writing as Elijah Hay, was also part of the &quot;movement&quot;.

Bynner was friendly with Kahlil Gibran and introduced the writer to his publisher, Alfred A. Knopf. The latter published Gibran&#x27;s &quot;The Prophet&quot; in 1923, which has had a long popularity. Gibran drew a portrait of Bynner in 1919.

In New York City, Bynner was a member of The Players club, the Harvard Club, and the MacDowell Club. In San Francisco, he joined the Bohemian Club.

==Asia and Berkeley==
Bynner traveled with Ficke and others to Japan, Korea, and China in 1917.

He had a short spell in academia in 1918–1919 at the University of California, Berkeley. He was hired to teach Oral English to the Students&#x27; Army Training Corps as a form of conscientious objector alternative service. After World War I ended, Bynner was invited to stay on in the English department to teach poetry. His students included several who became published poets of some note, such as Stanton A. Coblentz, Hildegarde Flanner, Idella Purnell, and Genevieve Taggard. In celebration of the end of the war, he composed &quot;A Canticle of Praise,&quot; performed in the Hearst Greek Theatre before some 8,000 people.

At Berkeley he met Kiang Kang-hu, a professor of Chinese, and began an eleven-year collaboration with him on the translation of Tang dynasty poems. His teaching contract was not renewed, but his students continued to meet as a group and he occasionally joined them. An elaborate dinner honoring him was held at the Bohemian Club in San Francisco. A &quot;festschrift&quot;, a book of poems by students and friends, &quot;W.B. in California&quot;, was given to all who were present.

Bynner returned to China, living there from June 1920 to April 1921 for intensive study of Chinese literature and culture. He met sculptor Beniamino Bufano en route. After returning to California, Bynner went to see family in New York. He embarked on another lecture tour, reaching Santa Fe, New Mexico in February 1922. Exhausted and suffering from a lingering cold, he decided to cancel the rest of his tour and rest there.

==Santa Fe and Mexico==
Finding the small city very appealing, in June 1922 Bynner moved permanently to Santa Fe. He first returned to Berkeley, where he recruited his former student Walter Willard &#x27;Spud&#x27; Johnson to join him as his secretary (and lover). Mabel Dodge Luhan introduced the two men to D.H. Lawrence and his wife Frieda.

The following year, Bynner and Johnson joined the Lawrences on a trip through Mexico. Lawrence was inspired to write several essays related to the trip, and his novel &quot;The Plumed Serpent,&quot; includes characters based on Bynner and Johnson. Bynner also produced related writings: three poems about Lawrence, and his memoir &quot;Journey with Genius&quot;, published in 1951.

Luhan was not pleased that the two couples had traveled together, as she wanted to be at the center of the community. She is said to have taken revenge on Bynner by hiring Johnson to be her own secretary. Bynner in turn wrote a play, &quot;Cake&quot;, satirizing her lifestyle.

In 1930 Robert &quot;Bob&quot; Hunt (1906–1964) arrived in Santa Fe, originally for a visit while recuperating from an illness. He and Bynner began a relationship which lasted for the rest of Hunt&#x27;s life. Together they entertained artists and literary figures such as Ansel Adams, W. H. Auden, Willa Cather, Robert Frost, Martha Graham, Aldous Huxley, Christopher Isherwood, D. H. Lawrence and his wife, Edna St. Vincent Millay, James Merrill, Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe, Carl Sandburg, Igor Stravinsky, Carl Van Vechten, and Thornton Wilder. They also made frequent visits to a second home in Chapala, Mexico, that they had bought from the Mexican architect Luis Barragán.

Bynner spent much of the 1940s and early 1950s in Chapala, until he began to lose his eyesight. He returned to the U.S., received treatment, and traveled to Europe with Hunt. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, Hunt took increasing responsibility for Bynner. Hunt died of a heart attack in January 1964.

On January 18, 1965, Bynner had a severe stroke. He never recovered, and required constant care until he died on June 1, 1968. Hunt and Bynner&#x27;s ashes are buried beneath the carved stone weeping dog at the house where he lived on Atalaya Hill in Santa Fe, now the president&#x27;s home at St. John&#x27;s College.

==Legacy==
From 1921 to 1923, Bynner had served as president of the Poetry Society of America. To encourage young poets, he created the Witter Bynner Prize for Undergraduate Excellence in Poetry, administered by the Poetry Society in cooperation with &quot;Palms&quot; poetry magazine, of which he was associate editor. African-American poets received the award soon after it was established: Countee Cullen in 1925 and Langston Hughes in 1926.

Bynner&#x27;s home in Santa Fe is now a bed and breakfast called the Inn of the Turquoise Bear.

In 1972, the Witter Bynner Foundation for Poetry was founded through a bequest from Bynner. It makes grants to perpetuate the art of poetry, primarily by supporting individual poets, translations, and audience development. Since 1997, it has funded the Witter Bynner Fellowship, the recipient of which is selected by the U.S. Poet Laureate.

A Witter Bynner Poetry Prize was established by the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1980 to support young poets. It was discontinued in 2003.

<doc id="1114601" wikidata="Q649750" url="?curid=1114601" title="Lordship of Argos and Nauplia">
<text>During the late Middle Ages, the two cities of Argos (, ) and Nauplia (modern Nafplio, Ναύπλιο; in the Middle Ages Ἀνάπλι, in French &quot;Naples de Romanie&quot;) formed a lordship within the Frankish-ruled Morea in southern Greece.

Following their conquest in 1211–1212, the cities were granted as a fief to Otto de la Roche, duke of Athens, by Geoffrey I of Villehardouin, prince of Achaea. The lordship remained in the possession of the de la Roche and the Brienne dukes of Athens even after the conquest of the Duchy of Athens by the Catalan Company in 1311, and the Brienne line continued to be recognized as dukes of Athens there. Walter VI of Brienne was largely an absentee lord, spending most of his life in his European domains, except for a failed attempt in 1331 to recover Athens from the Catalans. After his death in 1356 the lordship was inherited by his sixth son, Guy of Enghien. Guy took up residence in Greece, and in 1370–1371 Guy and his brothers launched another, also failed, invasion of the Catalan domains. When Guy died in 1376, the lordship then passed to his daughter Maria of Enghien and her Venetian husband Pietro Cornaro, who would also reside there until his death in 1388. The lordship became a &quot;de facto&quot; Venetian dependency during this period, and shortly after his death, Maria sold the two cities to Venice, where she retired. Before Venice could take possession, Argos was seized by the Despot Theodore I Palaiologos, while his ally, Nerio I Acciaioli seized Nauplia. The latter city was soon captured by Venice, but Argos remained in Byzantine hands until 1394, when it too was handed over to Venice.

== History ==

In the first years of the 13th century, already before the arrival of the Fourth Crusade in the Byzantine Empire, Argos and Nauplia became the centre of an independent domain under the Greek lord Leo Sgouros. Sgouros had exploited the feebleness of imperial authority, and like many other provincial magnates, proceeded to carve out his own principality. From his hometown Nauplia, he seized Argos and Corinth, and attacked Athens, although he failed to take the Acropolis of Athens. By early 1205, Sgouros had advanced into Boeotia and Thessaly, but was forced to abandon his conquests in the face of the Crusaders under Boniface of Montferrat, who advanced south from Thessalonica. Boniface overran Thessaly, Boeotia and Attica, where he installed his followers as barons, and his men invaded the Morea. Sgouros and his men held out in the citadels of Argos, Nauplia and Corinth, however, even after both Boniface and Sgouros died, in 1207 and 1208 respectively. The three fortresses were kept under siege by the Crusaders until the fall of Acrocorinth in 1210, followed by Nauplia and finally by Argos in 1212. The Lord of Athens, Otto de la Roche (), played a major role in their capture, and as a reward the Prince of Achaea Geoffrey I of Villehardouin () gave him Argos and Nauplia as a fief, along with an income of 400 &quot;hyperpyra&quot; from Corinth. The area of Damala (Troezen) in the Argolid was also given to the de la Roche, but soon passed to a cadet branch of the family, which assumed the Barony of Veligosti. Despite the establishment of a Frankish lordship in the southern Argolid, however, the Franks were never numerous in the district. Much as happened elsewhere in the Morea, the local Greek magnates simply submitted to their new Frankish lords, but kept their possessions and Orthodox faith, as well as a typically Byzantine culture, as evidenced by the continued construction of Byzantine-style churches during the period.

=== Under the de la Roche family ===
After the death of Otto I, some time between 1225 and 1234, Argos and Nauplia were inherited by his son , while Athens went to Guy I de la Roche (). In April 1251, Otto II sold his Greek possessions to his brother Guy I in exchange of 15,000 gold &quot;hyperpyra&quot; and the latter&#x27;s lands and claims in France.

Following the fall of Boniface&#x27;s Kingdom of Thessalonica to the Greek Despotate of Epirus in 1224, the Principality of Achaea emerged as the most powerful and pre-eminent among the Latin states of southern Greece. Inevitably, the other Latin lordships began to be drawn into the orbit of Achaea, which during the early reign of William II of Villehardouin () reached the height of its power and prosperity. Guy I de la Roche was one of William&#x27;s feudatories, both for Argos and Nauplia, as well as for his possession of one half of Thebes As a result, he participated in the siege and conquest of the last Greek stronghold in the Morea, the fortress city of Monemvasia (1246–1248), alongside William. At about the same time, William received from the Latin Emperor the suzerainty over the Duchy of Naxos, Negroponte (Euboea), and possibly over the Marquisate of Bodonitsa as well, while the County of Cephalonia also recognized his overlordship. William&#x27;s hegemonic ambitions worried many of the other Latin rulers and barons, however, resulting in the War of the Euboeote Succession (1256–1258). Guy de la Roche fought against William in the conflict, but it ended in a complete victory for William and Guy&#x27;s submission to the Prince of Achaea. 

Following the capture of William II by the Byzantines in the Battle of Pelagonia (1259), in 1261 the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos () received a number of fortresses in the southeastern Morea (Monemvasia, Mystras and Grand Magne, possibly also Geraki) as a ransom for the Prince&#x27;s release. According to George Pachymeres, Argos and Nauplia were also demanded by Palaiologos, but in the event they remained in Latin hands. In the 1270s, with the rise of the Latin renegade Licario, who became a Byzantine admiral, the Argolid suffered repeated raids at the hands of Licario&#x27;s corsairs.

=== Under the Brienne family ===

In 1309, Walter I of Brienne succeeded to the Duchy of Athens, but he and many of the most important lords of Frankish Greece fell in the Battle of Halmyros in March 1311 against the Catalan Company. In its aftermath, the Catalans took over the Duchy of Athens and, with the military capacity of the remaining Latin states of Greece crippled, threatened to invade the Morea and take over Argos and Nauplia as well. After briefly holding Athens against the Catalans, Walter&#x27;s widow, Joanna of Châtillon, went to France to solicit aid from her father, the Constable of France Gaucher V de Châtillon, whom she appointed &quot;bailli&quot; in her name on 22 November 1312. 

Over the next few years, with support from the Angevin Kingdom of Naples and the Papacy, Joanna dispatched men and provisions to the Argolid, which was administered in her name by the local Frankish brothers Walter and Francis of Foucherolles. The steadfast loyalty of the Foucherolles to the Briennist claimants was instrumental in keeping the lordship under their control over the next decade, when the Argolid was ravaged by Catalan raids. The lordship&#x27;s maintenance necessitated continuous expense, however, which forced Joanna to undertake large debts. When Joanna&#x27;s son Walter II of Brienne came of age in January 1321, he initially refused to take over his mother&#x27;s debts. King Philip V of France adjudicated between them and decided that Walter had to pay off the sum of 7,000 livres tournois and his mother the rest. 

The Briennist claims were upheld by Pope Clement V and Pope John XXII, who took a firm stance against the Catalan Company: the Catalans were excommunicated, their attacks on fellow Christians excoriated, and attacks on them by the other Latin powers of Greece encouraged. Clement sought the intercession of King James II of Aragon to get the Catalans to abandon Athens, but the King&#x27;s appeal to that effect was ignored. Clement further ordered the Knights Hospitaller to provide three or four galleys and men to defend the Brienne lands, and in 1314 commanded all Templar properties in the Duchy of Athens to be placed under the control of Gaucher V de Châtillon and to be used against the Catalans. The Briennist cause was undermined, however, by the persistent refusal of the Republic of Venice to support anti-Catalan ventures. Although the Venetians were often at odds with the Catalans over their claims to various fiefs in Euboea, in 1319 an accord was reached that established generally peaceful relations between the two over the next few decades.

After 1321, Walter II repeatedly announced his intention to campaign in Greece and recover the Duchy of Athens, but financial constraints and his obligations to the King of Naples kept him occupied in Italy. In 1328, he even briefly concluded a truce with the Catalans. Thus it was not until 1330 that a serious effort got under way. In June 1330, Pope John XXII issued a crusading bull for Walter, and ordered prelates in Italy and Greece to preach for a crusade against the Catalans; shortly after, King Robert of Naples also gave the crusade his support, and allowed his feudatories to join it. The Venetians, on the other hand, renewed their treaty with the Catalans in April 1331. Sailing from Brindisi in August, Walter attacked first the Latin County palatine of Cephalonia and Zakynthos, and the Greek Despotate of Epirus, forcing them to recognize the overlordship of King Robert. From there he proceeded to invade the Duchy of Athens through northern Boeotia, but his campaign was a failure as the Catalans avoided battle and withdrew behind the walls of Thebes and Athens. Walter had neither the troops to overwhelm the Catalans nor the money to sustain a prolonged war of sieges and attrition, and found no support among the native Greek population. By summer 1332, it was clear that the expedition had failed, and Walter returned to Brindisi. He had captured the island of Leucas and Vonitsa for himself and briefly restored Angevin suzerainty over western Greece, but the main objective had eluded him, and he had ended up with even more crippling debts. The effect of his expedition on Argos and Nauplia is unclear; he may not even have visited the territory during his stay in Greece. 

Walter did not abandon his plans for regaining his inheritance in Greece, and retained papal support, which materialized in repeated excommunications of the Catalans. With the Venetians firmly opposed to rendering any help, however, Walter&#x27;s plans could not be fulfilled. After further ventures and adventures in Italy and France, Walter was killed at the Battle of Poitiers in 1356. During this time, the Argolid suffered a raid by the Aydinid Turks under Umur Bey in 1332, which coincided with a prolonged famine that required food to be imported from Italy. At the same time, Argos and Nauplia also came within reach of the expanding Byzantine province in the Morea, which by had expanded from the southeast to include most of Arcadia and Cynuria. The increased threat to the lordship prompted Walter II to construct two new castles, which first appear in his will of 1347: at Kiveri (&quot;Chamires&quot; in French) across the Argolic Gulf from Nauplia and Thermisi (&quot;Trémis&quot;) further east along the coast, across Hydra Island. Despite the depredations from raids, the Brienne fief was relatively prosperous: the area was fertile and supported agriculture, pastures for livestock, and vineyards, while the Argolic Gulf provided fisheries and salt flats near Thermisi. According to documents from later in the 14th century, carobs, raisins, resin and acorn dyes, as well as cotton and linen cloth, were exported.

=== Under the Enghien family ===
Walter II died without direct heirs, as his only son had died as a child during his 1331 campaign. He was succeeded in his titles and claims by his sister Isabella of Brienne and her husband Walter of Enghien, but these were immediately devolved on their numerous children. While the couple&#x27;s second (and eldest surviving) son, Sohier of Enghien, received the County of Brienne and the rights to Athens, it was a younger son, Engelbert, who received Argos and Nauplia, as well as Walter&#x27;s lands in Cyprus. Unwilling to undertake the considerable burden of defending the Greek fiefs, Engelbert exchanged them with his brother Guy, who had originally received the fief of Ramerupt in France. Guy thus became the new &quot;Lord of Argos, Nauplia and Kiveri&quot;. 

Guy replaced Nicholas of Foucherolles, who had served as &quot;bailli&quot; during the last decade of Walter&#x27;s reign, with two members of a branch of the Medici family who had settled in Greece: Piere Tantenes (&quot;of Athens&quot;), also known as &quot;Yatro&quot; (Greek for &quot;physician&quot;, a hellenization of &quot;Medici&quot;) in 1357–1360 and Arardo or Averardo de Medici in 1360–1363/4. Their rule proved unpopular, however, and in 1360 the local populace rebelled—according to historian Thanos Kondylis, perhaps with the encouragement of the Foucherolles—when Averardo de Medici increased taxation on figs and raisins, and blockaded Guy&#x27;s soldiers in their castles. The situation was resolved when Guy in person came and settled in the lordship—he is attested at Nauplia in December 1364, where he issued an act in favour of Jacomo, Lord of Tzoya and a son-in-law of Nicholas of Foucherolles. Guy strengthened his ties to the lordship by marrying into the local aristocracy. The identity of his wife is unclear: the early 15th-century &quot;Chronographia regum francorum&quot; records that she was the daughter of the Baron of Arcadia, probably Erard III le Maure, while the 17th-century Flemish historian Vredius records that she was a Greek named Bonne or Maria. The 19th-century historian of Frankish Greece, Karl Hopf, hypothesized that Bonne was a daughter of Nicholas of Foucherolles, but without any evidence; nevertheless, his version is commonly accepted in modern literature. 

Guy&#x27;s reign was troubled by the threat of the Ottoman Turks, against whom, according to the &quot;Chronographia regum francorum&quot;, he proved a courageous leader. To strengthen the security of his domains, on 22 July 1362, Guy became a Venetian citizen, a development that heralded active Venetian involvement in the affairs of the area. Two years later, soon after his arrival in the Morea, he was involved in the civil war over possession of the Principality of Achaea between Philip II of Taranto and Maria of Bourbon, widow of Philip&#x27;s older brother Robert, who died in September 1364 without a direct heir. Guy, along with the Despot of the Morea Manuel Kantakouzenos (), supported Maria and her son Hugh of Lusignan until 1370, when the latter sold their claims to Philip.

Now the undisputed Prince of Achaea, Philip sent to the Morea as his &quot;bailli&quot; Guy&#x27;s brother Louis, Count of Conversano. By this time, the Catalans of Athens had entered a period of decline and civil war, which only somewhat subsided with the appointment of Matthew of Peralta as vicar-general in 1370. The Enghiens saw a perfect opportunity to reclaim their ancestral inheritance: on 28 March 1370 a third brother, John of Enghien, Count of Lecce, received permission from Queen Joanna I of Naples to gather 1,000 foot and 500 horse for service in Greece, and began arranging for ships to ferry them along the southeastern coasts of Italy. Guy also arranged a truce with the Despot of the Morea so as to concentrate his forces against the Catalans. As Venetian citizens, the Enghiens also approached Venice for aid, which was politely but firmly declined, first in April 1370, and again in February 1371. Undeterred, the Enghiens launched an invasion of Attica in spring 1371, but the campaign failed as the Acropolis resisted and Louis fell ill. The Enghiens retreated, and Guy concluded a truce with the Catalans in August; a marriage between his daughter and heir Maria and Joan de Llúria (probably the son of the former Catalan vicar-general Roger de Llúria) was initially stipulated in the agreement, but never actually took place. This was to be the last effort by the claimants, for troubles in Italy occupied Guy&#x27;s brothers, and the looming Ottoman threat forced the Papacy to shift to a policy of supporting the Catalans. Any prospects to regain the Athenian duchy were further impeded by the capture of Megara by the ambitious Nerio I Acciaioli in 1374/75, which barred the land route into Attica to the Enghiens. Guy of Engien died shortly after October 1376. As his daughter Maria was underage and unmarried, the Lordship was governed by his brother Louis as her guardian. Louis arranged Maria&#x27;s marriage to the Venetian Pietro Cornaro in May 1377. Louis seems to have launched some raids against the Catalans in 1377, but this was overshadowed by the fall of the Duchy of Athens to the Navarrese Company in 1379.

=== Takeover by Venice ===

The Cornaro family had been established in Latin Greece for some time, acting both as the Republic of Venice&#x27;s officials and on their own account, and Pietro&#x27;s father Federico was accounted the richest man in Venice in 1379. The marriage of Maria of Enghien and Pietro Cornaro coincided with an increasing Venetian interest in the region, as the Republic faced new challenges and opportunities in the Aegean with the rise of the Ottomans. Possession of Nauplia would complete Venice&#x27;s control of the shores of the Morea, which in turn controlled the routes from the Adriatic to the eastern Mediterranean; while Nauplia itself was valuable as an intermediate stop for the Black Sea commercial routes as well. Maria of Enghien and Pietro Cornaro were both still young when they became lords of Argos and Nauplia. In the first years of their reign, they resided in Venice, and Pietro&#x27;s father Federico acted on their behalf, securing permissions from the Venetian government to send supplies or arm a galley to defend the lordship. Following his father&#x27;s death in 1382, Pietro secured permission by the Venetian government to go to Nauplia himself; by this time, in Anthony Luttrell&#x27;s words, &quot;the [Venetian] senate considered these places more or less as Venetian possessions&quot;. 

When Pietro Cornaro died in 1388, Maria, unable to defend her possessions, sold them to Venice on 12 December in exchange for an annual subsidy of 700 ducats. Before the Venetians could arrive to take over the two towns, however, the Byzantine Despot of the Morea Theodore I Palaiologos (), and his ally and father-in-law Nerio I Acciaioli seized them with the aid of an Ottoman army under Evrenos. Although the Venetians were quickly able to oust Nerio from Nauplia, Argos, Kiveri and Thermisi remained in Theodore&#x27;s hands until 11 June 1394, when he ceded them to Venice. After Maria&#x27;s death in 1393, her uncle Engelbert—who had originally received the lordship in 1356—claimed her inheritance, but when the Venetians provided the document of sale, and suggested that they would be willing to cede the castles if he could pay for their defence and reimburse Venice for the costs of their purchase and the ongoing siege of Argos, he dropped his claim. Argos remained in Venetian hands until conquered by the Ottomans at the outbreak of the First Ottoman–Venetian War in 1463, while of all Venetian territories in the Morea, Nauplia persisted longest, and was surrendered to the Ottomans in 1540 after the conclusion of the Third Ottoman–Venetian War.

<text>Helen Rodd is a Canadian zoologist who is a professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at the University of Toronto. 

Rodd&#x27;s work focuses on reproductive strategies among live-bearing fish as a system to understand mate selection among animals. Her work on mate preference in guppy fish (&quot;Poecilia reticulata&quot;) attracted media attention in numerous nature magazines and the United States public broadcasting service, as well as academic notice, based upon her research finding that female guppies in Trinidad may choose males for orange coloration similar to a favored food, the fruit of a local tree. In 2001, Rodd was awarded a &quot;Premier&#x27;s Research Excellence Award&quot; by the Ontario government for her work in guppy mate selection.

Rodd received her Ph.D. in Biology from York University in Toronto with a thesis titled: &quot;Phenotypic plasticity in the life history traits and sexual behaviour of Trinidadian guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in response to their social environment.&quot;

<text>Roberta Alexandra Mary Taylor (; 26 February 1948 – 6 July 2024) was an English actress and author. She was known for her roles of Irene Raymond in &quot;EastEnders&quot; (1997–2000) and Inspector Gina Gold in &quot;The Bill&quot; (2002–2008).

==Career==
Taylor worked in the theatre and appeared at the Glasgow Citizens Theatre from 1980 to 1992. During that period, she played La Duchesse de Guermantes in a stage adaptation of Marcel Proust&#x27;s &quot;A la recherche du temps perdu&quot; (&quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot;) entitled &quot;A Waste of Time&quot;, in which Rupert Everett and Gary Oldman were also in the cast. She was also seen in Noël Coward&#x27;s &quot;Design for Living&quot;, Oscar Wilde&#x27;s &quot;A Woman of No Importance&quot; and &quot;An Ideal Husband&quot;. She was the Princess Kosmonopolis in Tennessee Williams&#x27; &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; in 1992, and in 1995 played the Nurse in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; at the Lyric Hammersmith.

She also appeared in episodes of the television series &quot;Doctors&quot;, &quot;Sharman&quot;, &quot;Holby City&quot;, &quot;Silent Witness&quot;, Shakespeare and Hathaway and &quot;Inspector Morse&quot;. She has appeared as a guest on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot; and in the films &quot;The Witches&quot; (1990) and &quot;Tom &amp; Viv&quot; (1994). She has also appeared as herself on Lily Savage&#x27;s Blankety Blank.

In 2005 she played Mrs Pardiggle in the BBC&#x27;s drama serial adaptation of Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;Bleak House&quot;. In 2009, she starred as the long-suffering Phoebe Rice in John Osborne&#x27;s play &quot;The Entertainer&quot; at the Royal Exchange Theatre in Manchester. In 2011 she appeared in the West End revival of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, alongside Rupert Everett, Kara Tointon and Diana Rigg. In September 2017, Taylor made a guest appearance in &quot;Casualty&quot;.

==Books==
Alongside her acting career, Taylor was an author. Her first book, &quot;Too Many Mothers&quot;, a memoir of her childhood, was published in October 2005. She was criticised by two cousins for some of the content in the book, with one of the cousins claiming that she was &quot;too flippant about traumatic events in his difficult past&quot;. She refused to remove any of the content prior to publication, and later walked away from one of them at a book signing. Her first novel, &quot;The Reinvention of Ivy Brown&quot;, was published in November 2008.

==Personal life and death==
Born out of wedlock to Robert Alexander Archer, an already married bus conductor, Taylor was brought up by her mother Winifred Roberts, aunts, and grandmother.

She married Victor Taylor on 1 April 1966. The couple had a son but divorced in 1975. Taylor met actor Peter Guinness while working with the Glasgow Citizens Theatre. They married in September 1996 after having been together for twenty years. Guinness appeared in a few episodes of &quot;The Bill&quot; as her character’s lover in 2007.

Taylor died of pneumonia following a fall, on 6 July 2024, at the age of 76. Taylor had suffered from emphysema due to being a &quot;dedicated smoker&quot;.

<text>Apple Symbols is a font introduced in Mac OS X 10.3 “Panther”. This is a TrueType font intended to provide coverage for characters defined as symbols in the Unicode Standard. It continues to ship with Mac OS X as part of the default installation. Prior to Mac OS X 10.5, its path was codice_1. From Mac OS X 10.5 onward, it is to be found at codice_2, meaning it is now considered an essential part of the system software, not to be deleted by users.

The version of the font as of Mac OS X 10.5 is 6.0d7e4.

It remains available in modern macOS versions such as macOS Ventura.

<doc id="1114623" wikidata="Q369661" url="?curid=1114623" title="Cadillac Calais">
<text>The Cadillac Calais is an automobile produced by Cadillac from 1965 to 1976. The Division renamed its entry-level Series 62 as the &quot;Calais&quot; in 1965, after the French port city, derived from Calais in Greek mythology, one of two winged sons of Boreas, god of the North Wind, and Oreithyea. The Calais was identical in styling and mechanics to the better-equipped, more expensive Cadillac de Ville. No convertible model was offered in the Calais line.
==1965–1970==

In 1965, Calais tailfins were canted slightly downward, and sharp, distinct body lines were featured. The rear bumper was straight and the rear lamp clusters were vertical. The headlight pairs were vertical, permitting a wide grille. Side windows were curved and frameless. Perimeter frame construction allowed positioning of the engine forward in the frame, thus lowering the transmission hump and increasing interior room. Like the De Ville, the Calais was available as a 2- or 4-door hardtop as well as a &quot;formal-roof&quot; 4-door sedan, which was a hybrid with frameless, hardtop-like windows, but with a pillar between them.

The primary differences between the Calais and the De Ville were trim levels and standard equipment. While the De Ville was delivered with such standard amenities as AM/FM radio, power windows, and 2-way power seats, the Calais had hand-cranked windows and manual seat adjusters as standard, with the radio and power windows being US$165 ($ in dollars ) in 1965 and US$119 options ($ in dollars ) in 1965, respectively. Other standard equipment on the Calais included power brakes; power steering; automatic transmission; cornering lights; dual back-up lights; windshield washers and dual speed wipers; full wheel covers; remote controlled outside rear view mirror; visor vanity mirror; oil filter; five tubeless blackwall tires; heater; defroster; lamps for glove and rear passenger compartments and front and rear seat belts.

Unlike the De Ville, the Calais did not offer leather seating areas and vinyl roof trim was not offered initially. A high-grade cloth and vinyl, similar to what was seen on top-line GM C platform-based Buick Electras and Oldsmobile 98s, was standard. Another item not initially available on the Calais was the Cadillac-exclusive &quot;firemist&quot; paint, an extra-cost high gloss metallic paint. 

Cadillac, always General Motors&#x27; technology leader, offered most De Ville options on the Calais, such as Twilight Sentinel and the GuideMatic headlight dimmer. In 1965, the new Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission, standard on the 1964 De Ville, but not the lower-priced Series 62, became standard throughout the Cadillac line, including the Calais. The V8 also remained the standard engine.

Pricing of the Cadillac Calais started at just under US$5,000 ($ in dollars ), almost US$1,000 ($ in dollars ) (or about 25%) more than the Electra 225 and Oldsmobile 98, and about US$500 ($ in dollars ) more than the top-line Buick Riviera.
In 1966, changes included a somewhat coarser mesh for the radiator grille insert, which was became divided by a thick, bright metal horizontal center bar housing rectangular parking lamps at the outer ends. Separate rectangular side marker lamps replaced the integral grille extension designs. There was generally less chrome on all Cadillac models this year. Cadillac &quot;firsts&quot; this season included variable ratio steering and optional front seats with carbon cloth heating pads built into the cushions and seatbacks. Comfort and convenience innovations were headrests, reclining seats and an AM/FM stereo system. Automatic level control was available. Engineering improvements made to the perimeter frame increased ride and handling ease. Newly designed piston and oil rings and a new engine mounting system and patented quiet exhaust were used. Head rests became an option.
The Calais was extensively restyled for 1967. Prominent styling features were given a powerful frontal appearance with &quot;forward-leaning&quot; front end, long sculptured body lines, and redefined rear fenders that had more than just a hint of tail fins in them. The full-width forward-thrust &quot;eggcrate&quot; grille was flanked by dual stacked headlights for the third consecutive year. The squarer cornered grille insert had blades that seemed to emphasize its vertical members and it appeared both above the bumper and through a horizontal slot cut into it. Rectangular parking lamps were built into the outer edges of the grille. Rear end styling revisions were highlighted by metal divided taillamps and a painted lower bumper section. For 1967, power windows became standard on the Calais line, although power seats were still optional even in the 1970s models. Coupes got a new roofline, inspired by the Florentine show car created for the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair, that gave rear seat passengers added privacy. As on that show car, the quarter window glass retracted rearward into a sail panel. New standard Calais features included non-glare rear-view mirror, electric clock, Automatic Climate Controls, padded dashboard, Hazard Warning system, outboard seatbelt retractors and rear cigarette lighters in all styles. A slide-out fuse box and safety front seat back lock for two-door models were additional Cadillac advances for the 1967 model year. Technical improvements included a revised engine valve train, different carburetor, Mylar printed circuit instrument panel, re-tuned body mounts, and a new engine fan with clutch for quieter operation. An energy absorbing steering column became optional. 1967 was the last model year for pillared sedans.
For 1968, grilles had an insert with finer mesh and step down outer section which held the rectangular parking lights slightly higher than before. Front and rear side marker lights were mandatory, beginning this year. Rear end styling was modestly altered with the deck lid having more of a rake. The hood was re-designed to accommodate recessed windshield wiper-washers, which became three speed as standard. Of 20 exterior paint color combinations, 14 were totally new. On the inside, enriched appointments included molded inner door panels with illuminated reflectors and a selection of 147 upholstery combinations, 76 in cloth, 67 in leather and four in vinyl. New standard features included a Light Group, a Mirror Group, a trip odometer and an ignition key warning buzzer. Like all other Cadillacs, the Calais received the OHV V8 in 1968. 1968 was also the last year for the &quot;stacked&quot; dual headlights, which were replaced with horizontal dual headlights in 1969. 1968 was also the last year for vent windows. Shoulder belts became standard for both driver and right front passenger seating positions on all Cadillacs (except convertibles) built effective January 1, 1968.

In 1969, the Calais was restyled. A new front fender treatment similar to the Eldorado helped to emphasize a stronger horizontal design line. Rear quarters were extended to give the car a longer look. Dual horizontal headlamps were positioned in the outboard step down areas of the all-new grille. The roofline was squarer and the rear deck and bumper more sculptured. A new ventilation system eliminated the need for vent windows, which provided a longer sleeker look and improved visibility. New standard features included front center seat armrests.
Front seat headrests were mandatory and the ignition switch was moved from the instrument panel to the steering column, which locked both the steering wheel and transmission selector lever when the key was removed. 

In 1970, a facelift included a new grille with 13 vertical blades set against a delicately cross-hatched rectangular opening. The bright metal headlamp surrounds were bordered with body color to give a more refined look. Narrow vertical taillamps were seen again and had smaller bottom lenses extending downward in the bumper. Standard wheel covers and winged crest fender tip emblems were new. Exterior distinctions came from a Calais signature script above the rear end of the horizontal belt molding just ahead of the taillight dividers and from the use of small square back-up light lenses set into the lower bumper as opposed to the long rectangular lenses used on the De Ville. The Cadillac crest on the hood and decklid was slightly larger and the traditional &#x27;V&#x27; emblem beneath the crest was removed from both the Calais and De Ville this year, not to return until 1972.
==1971–1976==
For 1971, all Cadillac models including the Calais were completely restyled, inside and out. The new 1971 GM full-size bodies, at 64.3&quot; front shoulder room (62.1&quot; on Cadillac) and 63.4&quot; rear shoulder room (64.0&quot; on Cadillac) set a record for interior width that would not be matched by any car until the full-size GM rear-wheel drive models of the early to mid-1990s. Pairs of individually housed round headlamps were wider apart, with a winged Cadillac crest set between each pair. The V-shaped grille had an eggcrate style insert and was protected by massive vertical guards framing a rectangular license plate indentation. A wide hood with full-length windsplints, a prominent center crease and recessed windshield wipers was used. A larger Cadillac crest (again, minus the traditional &#x27;V&#x27; emblem) decorated the hood face and new optional fiber-optic lamp indicators were placed atop each front fender. A horizontal beltline molding ran from behind the front wheel housing almost to the rear, stopping where an elliptical bulge in the body came to a point and where thin rectangular side markers were placed above and below the chrome strip. The rear wheel openings were again covered by fender skirts. New vertical taillamps were no longer divided by a chrome bar. Long horizontal back-up lamps were set in the bumper, on either side of a deeply recessed license plate housing. The Calais wheelbase was extended to . Interiors were redesigned featuring a new curved instrument panel available with brushed aluminum trim. Revised seating areas featured either standard cloth or optional vinyl upholstery.

In 1972, a minor facelift placed more emphasis on horizontal grille blades. The parking lamps were moved from the bumper to between the square bezeled headlamps, which were now set wider apart. After a two year absence, the traditional &#x27;V&#x27; emblem was restored to the hood and deck lid. New standard features included a bumper impact system, automatic parking brake release, passenger assist straps and flow through ventilation system.

Energy absorbing bumpers were new on all GM cars in 1973. Styling refinements to the Calais included a wider grille with an intricate eggcrate design. Larger vertical rectangles housed the parking lamps between wide spaced headlamps which had square bezels but round lenses. Bumpers ran fully across the front and wrapped around each end. Vertical guards were spaced much further apart at a point outboard of the grille. The rear end had a bumper with a flatter upper section housing an angled license plate recess. Border outline moldings vertically &quot;veed&quot; paralleled the fender edge shape at the rear bodysides. Single horizontally mounted rectangular rear side marker lamps were placed over and under the rear tip of the thin beltline trim. &#x27;Cadillac&#x27; script was seen on the front fender sides below the belt molding behind the wheel opening; &#x27;Calais&#x27; script appeared on the lower right of the deck lid. Interior seating was revised this year, featuring standard cloth or optional vinyl upholstery. Also new were &quot;soft-pillow&quot; door panels with larger, sturdier pull-straps.

In 1974, a wider eggcrate grille was used. Dual round headlamps were mounted close together in square bezels. Further outboard were double deck wraparound turn signal/parking lamps. Shorter vertical grille guards appeared in about the same position as before. Rear fendersides were flatter without the elliptical bulge. The thin beltline molding was positioned lower by several inches. The rear end had vertical chrome bumper ends with integrated side-marker lights. New horizontal taillamps and back-up lamps were positioned beneath the trunk lid. Both bumpers, especially the rear, protruded further from the body. Coupes were no longer hardtops, instead sporting large wide &quot;coach&quot; windows giving a thick center pillar look. A new, two-tiered, &quot;space-aged&quot; curved instrument panel housed a new standard quartz controlled digital clock. Other standard features included a removable litter receptacle and bias belted blackwall tires.

1974 also saw the introduction of the industry&#x27;s first airbag system, the optional GM &quot;Air Cushion Restraint System&quot;. This option provided protection for front seat occupants in the case of a frontal collision. One airbag was located in the steering wheel hub, while the other sat in place of the glove compartment on the lower passenger side of the dashboard. The glove box was replaced with a rectangular storage compartment, complete with a lockable wood-tone hinged front panel, centrally located under the dashboard. Additionally, there was a driver&#x27;s side knee bolster panel with an ashtray to the right of the steering column and a small hinged-door storage compartment on the left side.
Although the &quot;ACRS&quot; system (also available on top of the line Buick and Oldsmobile models) saved lives, the option was quite expensive and therefore unpopular with customers. It was discontinued after 1976, and Cadillac would not offer airbags again until the 1990 model year. 

Styling changes for 1975 included a new hood with sharper lines; dual rectangular headlamps flanked by rectangular turn signal/parking lights wrapped around squared-off front fenders resulted in a more unified front-end appearance. A new cross hatched grille also appeared with Cadillac script on the header. Sedans now featured slim fixed triangular quarter windows. New standard equipment included the lamp monitor system, power door locks, high energy ignition and steel-belted radial tires. The big engine, an Eldorado exclusive since 1970, was now standard in all Cadillacs except the new, smaller Seville. Vinyl seating areas were of the same configuration since 1973; Cloth upholstery was available in more colors.

In 1976, the grille saw a new finer crosshatching pattern. Cornering lamps received new horizontal silver trim, while taillamps bezels also gained chrome-like trim. Eight different color accent stripes were available. Optional padded vinyl roof coverings were now stamped with an Elk grain pattern. Vinyl seats were continued and new interior trim included plaids, plush velours and knits. Coupe models equipped with the available cabriolet vinyl top, covering the rear-half of the roof, were trimmed with a lower molding that served as a continuation of the door &quot;belt&quot; molding. A Controlled (limited-slip) Differential was included for extra traction. An optional illuminated entry and theft deterrent system was available. A new Delco Freedom battery never needed water. Simulated wire wheel covers were newly available. Other new options included a push-button Weather Band built into the AM/FM stereo signal-seeking radio, plus power passenger and manual driver seatback recliners for 50/50 front seats. Of the 15 standard and six optional Firemist body colors, 13 were new this year. New standard features included Soft-Ray tinted glass, spare tire cover, trunk mat, washer fluid level indicator, and steel belted radial whitewall tires.

1976 was the 11th and final year for the slow-selling Calais. Sales had never been strong, and had been declining steadily since the introduction of the model in 1965; the difference in cost between the entry-level Calais and the base De Ville had become basically negligible, and Cadillac customers saw little reason to purchase a Calais when a better equipped De Ville cost only slightly more. For 1977, the Cadillac De Ville and Fleetwood would be extensively redesigned and downsized; prices would also increase significantly.

<doc id="1114625" wikidata="Q5601333" url="?curid=1114625" title="Greatest Hits 1982–1989">
<text>Greatest Hits 1982–1989 is the third greatest hits album by the American band Chicago, released by Full Moon/Reprise Records on November 21, 1989. It became one of Chicago&#x27;s biggest selling albums, having been certified five times platinum in the United States. 

Spanning from &quot;Chicago 16&quot; in 1982 to &quot;Chicago 19&quot; in 1988, the set includes founding vocalist Peter Cetera and his successor Jason Scheff. It includes a remix of &quot;What Kind of Man Would I Be?&quot;, as well as also being Chicago&#x27;s last release before the dismissal of its original drummer Danny Seraphine in the following year after its release. 

A variation titled The Heart of... Chicago was issued in countries outside North America, with similar artwork but a different track list including four songs originally released on the Columbia record label.

== Track listing &quot;Greatest Hits 1982–1989&quot; ==
#&quot;Hard to Say I&#x27;m Sorry/Get Away&quot; (Peter Cetera, David Foster, Robert Lamm) – 5:07
#&quot;Look Away&quot; (Diane Warren) – 4:03
#&quot;Stay the Night&quot; (Cetera, Foster) – 3:49
#&quot;Will You Still Love Me?&quot; (Foster, Tom Keane, Richard Baskin) – 5:43
#&quot;Love Me Tomorrow&quot; (Cetera, Foster) – 5:06
#&quot;What Kind of Man Would I Be?&quot; (Remix) (Jason Scheff, Chas Sandford, Bobby Caldwell) – 4:14
#&quot;You&#x27;re the Inspiration&quot; (Cetera, Foster) – 3:50
#&quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Live Without Your Love&quot; (Warren, Albert Hammond) – 3:52
#&quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot; (Steve Kipner, Jon Parker) – 4:44
#&quot;Along Comes a Woman&quot; (Cetera, Mark Goldenberg) – 4:16
#&quot;If She Would Have Been Faithful...&quot; (Kipner, Randy Goodrum) – 3:53
#&quot;We Can Last Forever&quot; (Scheff, John Dexter) – 3:44

Unlike the two previous &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; albums, all of the songs were in their original album lengths, except &quot;What Kind of Man Would I Be?&quot;. Some US copies on vinyl, and possibly some CDs, list &quot;Along Comes a Woman&quot; but actually contain &quot;Remember the Feeling&quot; (originally the flipside of &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot;).

<doc id="1114636" wikidata="Q7367005" url="?curid=1114636" title="Rosa 'Schoener's Nutkana'">
<text>&quot;Rosa&quot; &#x27;Schoener&#x27;s Nutkana&#x27; is a deep pink rose variety named after Father Georg Schöner (1864–1941), a priest who became a notable rose breeder, who developed this rose in 1930 as a cross between &quot;Rosa nutkana&quot; and the hybrid perpetual &#x27;Paul Neyron&#x27; (Levet, 1869).

This hybrid nutkana is a shrub rose with large, single flowers, five-petalled but sometimes with another one or two, reaching an average diameter of . Their colour is light to carmine-pink with a large circle of yellow stamens. The long-lasting flowers are moderately fragrant, develop from small, pointed buds, and appear in small clusters of two to five on short strong stems in a spring or summer flush with some scattered flowers later on. In autumn, the shrub sports rose hips.

The plant tends to be a tall, sprawling shrub, with very few thorns on its arching shoots and small light to medium grey-green foliage with seven leaflets. &#x27;Schoener&#x27;s Nutkana&#x27; can grow high and wide. The vigorous shrub tolerates half-shade and poorer soils, is very disease resistant and winter hardy down to −25 °C (USDA zone 5). It is well suited to form hedges.

<text>Roger Francis Hamilton Maxwell (born 21 March 1941) is a former New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1984 to 1999, representing the National Party.

==Early life==
Maxwell was born in South Canterbury. He obtained his tertiary education at Lincoln College and at Massey University. From 1967, he owned a farm in the Taranaki region and studied rural valuation.

==Political career==



Maxwell was a member of the Ashburton branch of the Young Nats from 1963. He chaired the Urenui branch of the National Party from 1969, and was the Taranaki electorate chairman from 1977 to 1983. He organised the Taranaki electorate campaigns for the and s for David Thomson.

He was first elected to Parliament in the 1984 election in Taranaki, when he succeeded Thomson. When the National Party won power in the 1990 election, Maxwell became the Minister of Business Development, the Associate Minister of Employment, and the Associate Minister of Immigration. In 1993, he became the (full) Minister of Immigration.

In the 1996 election, the Taranaki electorate was merged with the King Country electorate, and the combined Taranaki-King Country electorate was taken by King Country MP (and Prime Minister) Jim Bolger; Maxwell instead contested the New Plymouth electorate, but was defeated by Labour&#x27;s Harry Duynhoven. Maxwell remained in Parliament as a list MP, but lost his ministerial portfolios in the reshuffle made necessary by National&#x27;s coalition with New Zealand First. He retired at the 1999 election.

==Honours==
In the 2004 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, Maxwell was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services.

<text>The common hatchetfish or river hatchetfish (&quot;Gasteropelecus sternicla&quot;) is a tropical fish belonging to the freshwater hatchetfish family (Gasteropelecidae). Originating in South America in the Peruvian and middle Amazon, the Guianas and Venezuela, it grows to about . The fish gets its name from its relatively large protruding belly which resembles a hatchet. Hatchetfish will often jump out of the water when alarmed, propelled by their large, winglike pectoral fins. They also jump to catch small aerial insects.

==In the aquarium==

The river hatchetfish is a schooling species best kept in groups of five or more that spends most of its time in the top-level of the water where it searches for food. These fish are peaceful towards other fishes, but frequently bicker among themselves. Typical lifespan in captivity is around five years, but can live longer. They come from streams in a tropical climate and prefer water at pH 6–7, a water hardness of up to 15.0 dGH, and an ideal temperature range of . As carnivores, they will readily eat many types of small annelid worms, insects, and crustaceans, and they will also eat standard flake foods. They have a reputation for being greedy fish.

Because of their natural tendency to jump when alarmed, they may jump out of aquarium tanks. To prevent this, the top must either be completely sealed, or the water level lowered so the edges of the tank extend further upwards than the fish are capable of jumping. This is also less common with the addition of floating plants, to provide cover. It is also advised to keep them in a planted aquarium.

<text>Zile, anciently known as Zela () (still as Latin Catholic titular see), is a city in Tokat Province, Turkey. It is the seat of Zile District. Its population is 33,557 (2022). Zile lies to the south of Amasya and the west of Tokat in north-central Turkey. The city has a long history, including as former bishopric and the site of the Battle of Zela, which prompted the phrase &quot;Veni, vidi, vici.&quot; Today the city is a center for agricultural marketing and tourism.

== History ==
Historically, Zile has been known as Zela (), Zelitis (), Zelid, Anzila, Gırgırıye (Karkariye), Zīleh, Zilleli, Zeyli, and Silas (). Zile castle, the only solid castle in Anatolia, was built by Roman commander Lucius Cornelius Sulla. The castle contains the Amanos temple, and is called &quot;silla&quot;, meaning &quot;respected&quot;. In Semra Meral&#x27;s &quot;Her Yönüyle Zile&quot;, she claims that the name &quot;Zile&quot; came from &quot;Zela&quot;, stemming from &quot;Silla&quot;.

===Ancient City===
According to recent archaeological research, there is evidence of human habitation since Neolithic times in Zile. In his book &quot;Geographica&quot;, Strabo claimed that Zela was founded by Semiramis, a legendary Assyrian queen. By 548 BC, Zela and greater Anatolia were under the rule of Achaemenid Persian Empire. Persian rule saw construction of a portion of the Royal Road in the area, and of temples to the Persian gods Anahita, Vohu-Mano, and Anadates in the city itself. Darius I of Persia divided the largest Anatolian state of that time, Cappadocia, into two, with Zela remaining in Pontus Cappadocia, the northern region.

===Classical Era===

After roughly 200 years of Persian rule, Alexander the Great captured Zela from Darius III of Persia as a result of the Battle of the Granicus (334 BC). Following Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC and the collapse of his empire, Zela passed to the Seleucid Empire, a Hellenistic successor state of Alexander the Great&#x27;s dominion. It controlled the area for 200 years, but by 100 BC, its power in the region started to collapse. As a consequence, King Mithridates VI of Pontus attacked and took Zela in 88 BC, and ordered the killing of all Romans living there. This led the nearby Cappadocians to call on Rome for help. The Roman army, under Sulla&#x27;s command, fought and defeated Mithradates in the First Mithridatic War. Mithridates attacked Zela again in 67 BC with the help of his Armenian ally Tigranes the Great, king of Greater Armenia, initiating the Third Mithridatic War, which ended with victory by the Romans under Pompeius Magnus and the suicide of Mithridates in 63 BC. In Pompey&#x27;s settlement of Pontus, Zela received a civic constitution and a sizable territory thus transforming from its previous status as a temple domain to a city.

In 49 BC, civil war broke out between Julius Caesar and Pompey. While the Romans were distracted by this, Pharnaces II of Pontus, son of Mithridates, decided to seize the opportunity and take revenge for his father. His attack on Zela was halted by Julius Caesar in the bloody Battle of Zela (47 BC). While Caesar&#x27;s army suffered great losses, Pharnaces&#x27;s was completely destroyed in five hours. After this victory, Caesar sent his famous message to the Roman Senate: &quot;Veni Vidi Vici&quot;, meaning &quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot;. Caesar&#x27;s words were written on a cylindrical marble column and placed in the city castle.

According to Strabo, Zela had the temple of Anaïtis (), who was also revered by the Armenians.

===Middle Ages===
In 241, the Sassanid king Shapur I, attacked the Romans and defeated Roman Emperor Valerian, thus capturing Zela. From 241 to 1071, Zile was conquered many times by the Byzantines and Sasanids. Under Byzantine rule, Zile became a (now Titular Latin) bishopric of Asia Minor, suffragan of Amasya in the former Roman province of Helenopontus (see below).

Zela was conquered by Danishmend Melik Ahmet Gazi in 1071 and, since, has belonged to the Turks, who suppressed the bishopric. In 1174, Anatolian Seljuks captured the city from Danishmends under Izzettin II Kılıçaslan. After the collapse of the Anatolian Seljuks, the Eretna Emirate was founded in Zile&#x27;s district in 1335. The Ottomans defeated Ertans in 1397 under the rule of Sultan Bayezid I, integrating Zile into their empire.

===Modern History===
During the course of the Greco-Turkish War of 1919–1922 (also known as Turkish War of Independence), some supporters of Sharia (strict Islamic law) seized power in Zile and attacked the barracks of new Turkish Republic&#x27;s army. The soldiers were forced to retreat to the city castle and consequently asked for help from the Çorum battalion. The battalion reached the city in four days and upon their arrival they started bombing the city so as to force the rebels to surrender. As a result of heavy bombardment, Zile suffered a great fire which led to the loss of two thirds of its infrastructure and most of its forest cover. Finally, the army managed to put down the rebellion and regained control. Since then, Zile has been a rural district in Tokat province of the Republic of Turkey.

== Ecclesiastical history ==
Zela, in the Roman province of Helenopontus (civil diocese of Pontus), was a suffragan of the Metropolitan Archdiocese of Amasea, in the sway of the Patriarchate of Constantinople.
The following Suffragan Bishops of Zela are historically documented :

== Attractions ==
There are several columns in the center of the castle, but some researchers claim that the actual column with Caesar&#x27;s famous words was stolen, and the thieves have not been found yet. There are many other historical buildings and artifacts from Hittites, Lycians, Persians, Greeks, Romans and Turks in Zile. Among these, Zile castle, the Roman theatre, Ulu Camii and Çifte Hamam are the most famous. Kaya Mezarı, Kusyuva, Çay Pınarı, Imam Melikiddin Tomb, Seyh Musa Fakih Tomb, Elbaşı Mosque, Mast Tumulus, Namlı Hisar Kale, Anzavur Caves, Hacı Boz Bridge, Koç Taşı and Manastry in Kuruçay are also popular.

The remains of the Roman theatre are visible to the east of the citadel hill, together with some rock tombs. Two Ottoman baths, the Yeni Hamam and the Çifte Hamam, date from the 16th and 17th century and the Hasan Aga Madrasah was built in 1497. The Boyaci Hasan Aga Mosque with its stalactiform prayer niche dates from 1479 and the Seyh Musa Fakih Tomb is also very old with 1106 or 1305 given as possible construction dates.

Mast Tumulus, an ancient site located in Zile, is of special importance since it hosts the palace of a Hittitite ruler, earthenware utensils and Hittite hieroglyphics.

== Geography ==
Zile covers an area of within its city limits and has an elevation of . Turhal, Çekerek, Artova, Kadışehri, and Amasya are all towns located near Zile. The city is mostly surrounded by a fertile plain called &quot;Zile Ovası&quot; crossed by the Yeşil River and can produce harvests twice a year. South of the city, however, are the Deveci Mountains (1,892 m / 6,207 ft high), Güvercin Çalı, and Hüseyin Gazi Hill. Zile once had a great forest covering most of the plain, but during the 1950s, the city lost much of its forest because of the excessive breeding of goats and the use of wood for heating purposes. However, there is a recent study to plan reforestation in the area.

The city&#x27;s water supply is provided by the Çekerek River, flowing from Zile to Çekerek and the Büyükaköz dam which was constructed on the Çatak river. The Süreyyabey Dam and hydroelectric plant is under construction and will provide electricity and water for irrigation in the area.

===Climate===
Zile&#x27;s weather is influenced by the narrow coast land of the Black Sea Region to the north, bringing humidity, and by the Central Anatolia inland plateau to the south, with its low rainfall and cold winters. Summers are hot and dry, while the winters are snowy and cold. The weather is hot throughout the months of June to September, as the average summer maximum is 28 °C (83 °F), and the average minimum is 13 °C (56 °F), and is cold throughout the months of December to February as the average winter maximum is 7 °C (45 °F), and the average minimum is as low as -3 °C (27 °F). Northerly winds are responsible for humid climate from April to June. It is usually rainy during the months of April, May, June, November and December.

== Economy ==
Historically, coal was mined in Zile.

Agriculture, trade, and livestock are the main economic activities of Zile. Zile is a center of cereal production such that she is one of the biggest exporters of wheat, barley, lentil and common vetch in the Black Sea region. Zile is famous for its grapes, leblebi, cherry, and fruit gardens. The annual Cherry Festival is very famous in Tokat, Sivas and Yozgat. People of Zile don&#x27;t use their grapes to produce wine, but pekmez - a syrup-like liquid mixed from different kinds of fruit-juices.

The students of Zile Dinçerler School of Tourism and Hotel Management of Gaziosmanpasha University play an important role in city&#x27;s economic activities. The industry of Zile is developing rapidly. Since 1996, there has been a major movement from agriculture to industry. Anatolian Tigers constructed 55 factories whose major products include textiles, sugar beet, furniture, tomato sauce, leblebi, marble and shoes.

The municipality and the European Union have had a joint project to increase the tourism potential of Zile and to transform the city into a tourism destination. The project is funded by the EU and includes advertisements as well as education of local people about tourism.

== Education ==

The city boasts 100% literacy in the city centre and over 90% in surrounding villages, with public and Imam Hatip schools, and a roughly 1:27 student-teacher ratio. There are 126 primary and secondary schools with 14,373 students and 540 teachers. Zile Dinçerler Lisesi, Dinçerler 75th Year Anatolian High School and Anadolu Öğretmen Lisesi provide high school education in Zile. There are also four professional high schools providing technical education. Gaziosmanpasa University&#x27;s Zile Dinçerler School of Tourism and Hotel Management is also located in Zile. By the end of 2008, with the donations of Serafettin and Cemalettin Dincer, schooling will gain totally new educational premises including a modern and luxurious hotel building which will be also used for practical education by students.

== Media and social life ==
In Zile, theatres and concerts are conducted at a movie theatre whose capacity is 850 people. Along with national TV channels and radios, there is one local TV channel and two radio stations that keep Zile people up to date on current events. Zile has three local daily newspapers (&quot;Özhaber&quot;, &quot;Zile Postası&quot;, &quot;Gündem&quot;) and daily newspapers sell around 4000 copies per day.

== Transportation ==
Zile is linked by highways with the cities of Tokat and Amasya and is near the Sivas-Samsun railway.

<doc id="1114658" wikidata="Q971507" url="?curid=1114658" title="Battle of Zela (47 BC)">
<text>The Battle of Zela was fought in 47 BC between Julius Caesar and Pharnaces II of the Kingdom of Pontus. The battle took place near Zela (modern Zile), which is now a small hilltop town in the Tokat province of northern Turkey. The battle ended the ambitions of king Pharnaces who wanted to expand his rule over Asia Minor.

Following his swift victory, Caesar famously declared, &quot;&quot; (&quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot;), emphasizing the speed and decisiveness of his triumph.

==Prelude==
After the defeat of the Ptolemaic forces at the Battle of the Nile, Caesar left Egypt and travelled through Syria, Cilicia, and Cappadocia to fight Pharnaces, son of Mithridates VI.

Pharnaces had defeated Caesar&#x27;s Legate Gnaeus Domitius Calvinus, and his small Roman and allied army at the Battle of Nicopolis. He then committed atrocities against the Roman prisoners and against any Roman civilians he found in the region. When Pharnaces received word of Caesar&#x27;s approach, he sent envoys to seek peace, which Caesar refused outright.

Pharnaces had made camp near the town of Zela on the site of a great victory won by his father. His camp was in a strong defensive position, on high ground with a track linking his camp to the town to maintain his supply line. Caesar set up camp on the other side of the valley, but upon his scouts reporting Pharnaces&#x27; position, he decided to move his camp to the high ground opposite the Pontic camp. The Romans quickly marched onto the highground and started building a camp. Pharnaces reacted by drawing his army out of camp and put them into battle order. Caesar drew up one line of infantry to protect the workers but kept the rest of his army constructing the new camp. The Pontic army suddenly marched against the Romans.

==Armies==
Caesar had a detachment of the veteran VI Legion, the XXII Legion, the XXXVI Legion and several cohorts of survivors of the army of Domitius Calvinus. He also had a small contingent of cavalry. His army numbered c. 15,000 men.

Pharnaces had an army of approximately 20,000 strong, mostly consisting of tribal and levied infantry, but also containing a core of professional soldiers: phalangites, legionaries, and cavalry. Pharnaces also had scythed chariots.

==Order of battle==
Pharnaces drew up his army with the scythed chariots in front of the first line, which was made up of light infantry and cavalry; the second and third lines held the rest of the infantry. 

After Caesar had rushed his men into position, he had the VI on the right, the XXXVI on the left, and the Galatian legion in the centre.

==Battle==
Pharnaces&#x27; army marched down into the valley separating the two armies. Caesar initially laughed at this move, thinking it was merely bravado, as it meant his opponents had to fight an uphill battle. However, Pharnaces&#x27; men began climbing up from the valley, and Caesar realized they were serious. Caesar recalled the rest of his men from constructing their camp, and hastily drew them up for battle. Immediately after, the Pontic army engaged Caesar&#x27;s thin line of legionaries. Pharnaces&#x27; scythed chariots broke through the thin defensive line but were met by a hail of missiles (pila, the Roman throwing spear) from Caesar&#x27;s battle line and were forced to retreat. Caesar launched a counter-attack and drove the Pontic army back down the hill, where it was completely routed. Caesar then stormed and took Pharnaces&#x27; camp, completing his victory.

==Aftermath==
It was a decisive point in Caesar&#x27;s military career. His five-day campaign against Pharnaces was so swift and complete that, according to Plutarch (writing about 150 years after the battle), he commemorated it with the now-famous Latin words reportedly written to Amantius in Rome: &quot;Veni, vidi, vici&quot; (&quot;I came, I saw, I conquered&quot;). Suetonius says that the same three words were displayed prominently in the triumph for the victory at Zela. Pharnaces escaped from Zela, first fleeing to Sinope, then back to his Bosporan Kingdom. He started to recruit another army but was soon after defeated and killed by his son-in-law Asander, one of his former governors who had revolted after the Battle of Nicopolis. Caesar made Mithridates of Pergamum the new king of the Bosporan kingdom in recognition of his aid during the Egyptian campaign.

<doc id="1114673" wikidata="Q5257374" url="?curid=1114673" title="Denis Marshall (politician)">
<text>Denis William Anson Marshall (born 23 September 1943) is a former New Zealand politician. He was an MP from 1984 to 1999, representing the National Party, and a government minister until 1996. His ministerial career ended when he resigned about six months after the release of the Commission of Inquiry report into the Cave Creek Disaster, and a year after the accident itself, in which 14 people died and a further four were seriously injured, and during which time he was minister of conservation. He had been under pressure to resign since the report&#x27;s release.

==Early life==
Born in Marton on 23 September 1943, Marshall was educated at Norwood School, Gisborne, Hereworth School, Havelock North, Christ&#x27;s College, Christchurch and Lincoln College as part of the Kellogg New Zealand Rural Leadership Programme, and he was a Nuffield Farming Scholar to the United Kingdom 1983.

In 1965, he married Mary Annette Kilmister, and the couple went on to have three children.

==Member of Parliament==



Marshall was a member of the New Zealand House of Representatives from 1984 to 1999. Having joined the National Party in the 1970s, he was first elected to Parliament for Rangitikei in the 1984 election, defeating Social Credit Party leader Bruce Beetham. He held the seat against Beetham in the 1987 election and retained it until his retirement at the 1999 election.

==Cabinet minister==
Marshall served in a number of ministerial roles, beginning in 1993 and ending in 1996. He was Minister of Lands, Valuation, Department of Survey Land &amp; Information from 1993 to 1996, and Minister of Forestry in 1996. Other notable positions between 1997 and 1999 include Chairman of the Parliamentary Select Committee on Transport and Environment Committee, Chairman of Special Select Committee on Dairy Industry Restructuring, and Producer Boarder Reform.

===Minister of conservation===
Denis Marshall&#x27;s best-known post was as minister of conservation from 1990 to 1996 during which he also acted as associate minister of agriculture and associate minister of employment. He resigned from his role as a minister in May 1996, roughly a year following the April 1995 Cave Creek disaster, in which 14 people died. A commission of inquiry found that whilst many individual mistakes contributed to the accident, a root cause was that the Department of Conservation had been under-funded and under-resourced for the role it was expected to achieve, and from the time of its creation in 1987 it had remained disorganised internally with few consistently used project and safety management systems, or formally qualified staff for much of the required work. Intense scrutiny of the minister followed, as well as scrutiny of the government&#x27;s funding priorities.

He did not resign immediately following the release of the report, claiming that his resignation would not remedy the situation, and citing a quotation of Sir Geoffrey Palmer which stated that ministers weren&#x27;t personally responsible for everything done in their name, as they could not be expected to know or authorise everything that occurred. Criticism that he had been the minister of conservation for five years during which time it had remained in a disorganised state, however, eventually ended with his resignation about six months later.

==Life after politics==
Marshall retired from Parliament in 1999 and moved to London. He took up a full-time post as secretary-general at the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) from January 2002 to December 2006.

He has been consulting to the UNDP and the WBI over the past four years.

He now lives in Queenstown, Central Otago, New Zealand, where he is a vigneron of his own vineyard, Hawkshead Wine, a producer of pinot noir, pinot gris, riesling and sauvignon blanc.

==Community==
In 2000 he founded the NZ National Parks and Conservation Foundation following his strong belief that there needed to be an opportunity for the private sector and corporate world to contribute more to conservation in New Zealand. He was the foundation&#x27;s inaugural chairman from 2000 to 2001.

He was the chairman of the New Zealand Rural Communities Trust from 2000 to 2001.

He is a member in numerous community organisations in New Zealand such NZ Historic Places Trust and Royal Forest and Bird Protection Society.

==Honours==
In 1990, Marshall was awarded the New Zealand 1990 Commemoration Medal. In the 2000 New Year Honours, he was appointed a Companion of the Queen&#x27;s Service Order for public services.

<text>The freshwater hatchetfish are a family, Gasteropelecidae, of ray-finned fish from South and Central America. The common hatchetfish is the most popular member among fish keeping hobbyists. The family includes three genera: &quot;Carnegiella&quot; (four species), &quot;Gasteropelecus&quot; (three species), and &quot;Thoracocharax&quot; (two species).

==Distribution and habitat==
Freshwater hatchetfish originate from Panama and South America (though they are absent from Chile). They tend to be an upper-level fish, often swimming directly below the surface of the water, biding their time patiently.

==Size==
When fully grown, freshwater hatchetfish typically range in size from . One exception is the giant hatchetfish (&quot;Thoracocharax securis&quot;), which can grow up to . The smallest species are the pygmy hatchetfish (&quot;Carnegiella myersi&quot;), which only grows to about , and the dwarf hatchetfish (&quot;Carnegiella schereri&quot;), which grows to about .

==Flight==
The most obvious trait of the freshwater hatchetfish is their enormously enlarged sternal region. This is accompanied by large pectoral fins and &quot;extraordinarily powerful&quot; associated muscles which account for up to one-quarter of their total body weight. &quot;Quick beats of the pectoral fins&quot; allow hatchetfish to &quot;lift themselves half out of the water and glide along the surface ... Some species can even leave the water for short stretches.&quot; Because of this ability to fly and tendency to jump, aquaria used to keep hatchetfish should have a tightly sealed cover to prevent these fish from escaping.

==Genera==
The genera in this family are:
* &quot;Carnegiella&quot;
* &quot;Gasteropelecus&quot;
* &quot;Thoracocharax&quot;

<text>Giuseppe Calì (14 August 1846 – 1 March 1930) was a Maltese painter of Italian descent.

== Biography==

Born in Valletta, Calì was baptised at the Dominican Parish Church of Porto Salvo, one of the seven offsprings of the artist and musician Raffaele Calì, set designer at the Royal Theatre, and of mezzosoprano Giovanna Padiglione.
His parents, who were from Naples, had moved to British Malta in 1840.

At age 19, in 1865, thanks to the generosity of the merchant William Stephen Eynaud, Calì moved to Naples to further his artistic formation at the Accademia di Belle Arti, where he studied under neoclassicist Giuseppe Mancinelli (1812-1875). Rather than following Mancinelli&#x27;s style, the young Calì was attracted by the anti-academic Domenico Morelli (1826-1901), a follower of the Verismo movement. In Naples, Calì also grew closer to Romanticism and to the Italian Risorgimento. He made return to Valletta two years later, in 1867, summoned by his terrified parents who were told that their son planned to join Garibaldi in his latest attempt to overthrow the Papal States.

His first major work, &quot;The Death of Dragut&quot; from 1867, is still deemed a masterpiece; it was purchased by the government and placed on permanent display in the armory of the Grandmaster&#x27;s Palace, Valletta - then later at the Museum of Fine Arts, today&#x27;s MUŻA. The influences of both Mancinelli and Morelli are visible in the &quot;Death of Dragut&quot; and in other works of his early period.

Calì&#x27;s art soon found wide acceptance in Malta, where he got employed in decorating private houses with landscapes and portraits. Only after 1870 Calì started to accept Church commissions. In 1881 he pained St. Jerome at the Sacro Cuor Church in Sliema, also deemed among his major works.

Calì married Perennia Pace from Senglea in 1871, with whom had 11 children. In order to sustain the family, he got employed as art teacher at the Lyceum.

As an established authority in the artistic scene in the island, Calì started to grow his own school, favouring the style of Verismo over the rampant Neo-Classicism and academicism. Among his students were his son Ramiro Raffaele Calì, Raphael Bonnici Calì, Gianni Vella and Ignatio Cefai.

He died in Valletta and was commemorated by the Republic of Malta with a series of four postage stamps in 1996, and a coin in 2004. His son Ramiro Calì was also a painter. A bust of him is located behind the Malta Stock Exchange in the Upper Barrakka Gardens in Valletta.

== Works ==

Giuseppe Calì was a very prolific artist, almost every major church in Malta prides itself on his work. He worked very quickly, and according to one of his grandsons he was called &quot;ix-xitan tal-pinzell&quot; (&quot;devil of the brush&quot;). His performance was enormous; during his lifetime he made more than 600 different compositions (according to some sources - about 2,000) consisting of an impressive variety of paintings, drawings, bozzetti, portraits and decorations of church vaults, as well as a number of sculptures and lithography. Unfortunately, many of them were lost during World War II, such as the crucifixion in the Stella Maris church in Sliema.

The influence of Romanticism, which the artist became acquainted with in Naples, is evident in most of his early works, such as the painting of the altar of the parish church in Mosta, &quot;Our Lady of the Rosary&quot; (1870), his first work for churches after his return from Italy, and the &quot;Saint Lawrence&quot; (1881) and &quot;Saint Jerome&quot; (1882) in the &quot;Sacro Cuor&quot; church in Sliema. The latter is widely recognized as a masterpiece of the genre. This style is also visible in the works from 1885: &quot;Saint Joseph with Child&quot; for the parish church of St. Cajetan in Ħamrun and the &quot;Martyrdom of St. Demetrius&quot; for the parish church of Maria Bambina in Senglea. 
Calì has also done several works in collaboration with artist Carlo Ignazio Cortis, including for the Parish Church of St. Lawrence in Birgu and the Church of the Savior in Lija. At the end of the 19th century, he also worked on some side paintings, such as the one for the Church of the Annunciation in Tarxien, and the painting of Saint Dominic for the Porto Salvo parish church in Valletta, where he was baptized.

Calì has worked on many private home decoration assignments, including a series of four putti entitled &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; in the entrance hall of Villa Alhambra in Sliema, property of the architect Emanuele Luigi Galizia.
He also had a great influence on Maltese society, he painted about fifty portraits of famous people in Malta. This should include the portraits of Cardinal Lavigerie (1884), Cardinal Logue (1886), as well as Governor Richard More O&#x27;Ferrall, Marquis Emanuele Scicluna, Giovanni Battista Schembri, Achille Camilleri, Edward V. Ferro, Sir Victor Houlton, Judge Sir Adrian Dingli, Rector of University Napoleone Tagliaferro, Pope Pius IX, Judge Paolo Debono, Count and Countess of Messina, and Lord and Lady Strickland.

<doc id="1114702" wikidata="Q457278" url="?curid=1114702" title="Oodgeroo Noonuccal">
<text>Oodgeroo Noonuccal ( ; born Kathleen Jean Mary Ruska, later Kath Walker (3 November 192016 September 1993) was an Aboriginal Australian political activist, artist and educator, who campaigned for Aboriginal rights. Noonuccal was best known for her poetry, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse.

==Art and activism==
Oodgeroo Noonuccal joined the Australian Women&#x27;s Army Service in 1942, after her two brothers were captured by the Japanese at the fall of Singapore. Serving as a signaller in Brisbane she met many black American soldiers, as well as European Australians. These contacts helped to lay the foundations for her later advocacy of Aboriginal rights. During the 1940s, she joined the Communist Party of Australia because it was the only party which opposed the White Australia policy.

During the 1960s Walker emerged as a prominent political activist and writer. She was Queensland state secretary of the Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders (FCAATSI), and was involved in a number of other political organisations. She was a key figure in the campaign for the reform of the Australian constitution to allow Aboriginal people full citizenship, lobbying Prime Minister Robert Menzies in 1965, and his successor Harold Holt in 1966. At one deputation in 1963, she taught Robert Menzies a lesson in the realities of Aboriginal life. After the Prime Minister offered the deputation an alcoholic drink, he was startled to learn from her that in Queensland he could be jailed for this.

She wrote many books, beginning with &quot;We Are Going&quot; (1964), the first book to be published by an Aboriginal woman. The title poem concludes:

&lt;poem&gt;
The scrubs are gone, the hunting and the laughter.
The eagle is gone, the emu and the kangaroo are gone from this place.
The bora ring is gone.
The corroboree is gone.
And we are going.
&lt;/poem&gt;
This first book of poetry was extraordinarily successful, selling out in several editions, and setting Oodgeroo well on the way to be Australia&#x27;s highest-selling poet alongside C. J. Dennis. Critics&#x27; responses were mixed, with some questioning whether Oodgeroo, as an Aboriginal person, could really have written it herself. Others were disturbed by the activism of the poems, and found that they were &quot;propaganda&quot; rather than what they considered to be real poetry. Oodgeroo embraced the idea of her poetry as propaganda, and described her own style as &quot;sloganistic, civil-writerish, plain and simple.&quot; She wanted to convey pride in her Aboriginality to the broadest possible audience, and to popularise equality and Aboriginal rights through her writing.

Walker was inaugural president of the committee of the Aboriginal Publications Foundation, which published the magazine &quot;Identity&quot; in the 1970s.

In 1972 she bought a property on North Stradbroke Island (also known as &quot;Minjerribah&quot;) which she called Moongalba (&quot;sitting-down place&quot;), and established the Noonuccal-Nughie Education and Cultural Centre. And in 1977, a documentary about her, called &quot;Shadow Sister&quot;, was released. It was directed and produced by Frank Heimans and photographed by Geoff Burton. It describes her return to Moongalba and her life there. In a 1987 interview, she described her education program at Moongalba, saying that over &quot;the last seventeen years I&#x27;ve had 26,500 children on the island. White kids as well as black. And if there were green ones, I&#x27;d like them too ... I&#x27;m colour blind, you see. I teach them about Aboriginal culture. I teach them about the balance of nature.&quot; Oodgeroo was committed to education at all levels, and collaborated with universities in creating programs for teacher education that would lead to better teaching in Australian schools.

On 13 June 1970, Noonuccal (as Kathleen Jean Mary Walker) received the award of Member of the Order of the British Empire (Civil) (MBE) for her services to the community.
In 1974 Noonuccal was aboard a British Airways flight that was hijacked by terrorists campaigning for Palestinian liberation. The hijackers shot a crew member and a passenger and forced the plane to fly to several different African destinations. During her three days in captivity, she used a blunt pencil and an airline sickbag from the seat pocket to write two poems, &quot;Commonplace&quot; and &quot;Yusuf (Hijacker)&quot;.

In 1983, Noonuccal announced she would stand as an independent candidate for the Senate in Queensland at the 1983 federal election. She unsuccessfully attempted to recruit Senator Neville Bonner to join her on a pro-Aboriginal ticket, following his resignation from the Liberal Party. She subsequently withdrew her candidacy, stating she and Bonner were likely to split the vote. Later in the year Noonuccal ran in the 1983 Queensland state election for the Australian Democrats political party in the seat of Redlands. Her campaign focused around policies promoting the environment and Aboriginal rights. Receiving 6.4% of the primary vote, she was not elected.

In 1986 she played the part of Eva in Bruce Beresford&#x27;s film, &quot;The Fringe Dwellers&quot;.

In December 1987, she announced she would return her MBE in protest over the Australian Government&#x27;s intention to celebrate the Australian Bicentenary which she described as &quot;200 years of sheer unadulterated humiliation&quot; of Aboriginal people. She also announced she would change her name to Oodgeroo Noonuccal, with &quot;Oodgeroo&quot; meaning &quot;paperbark tree&quot; and Noonuccal (also spelt Nunukul) being her people&#x27;s name.

== Personal life and family==
Noonuccal was born Kathleen Jean Mary Ruska on 3 November 1920 on North Stradbroke Island. She attended Dunwich State School and then became a domestic servant.

On 8 May 1943 she married childhood friend and Brisbane waterside worker Bruce Walker at the Methodist Church, West End, Brisbane. The couple had one son Denis, but they later separated.
She worked for Raphael and Phyllis Cilento and had a second son, Vivian Charles Walker, with the Cilentos&#x27; son Raphael junior, born in Brisbane in 1953. In 1970 Vivian won the first Aboriginal scholarship to attend the National Institute of Dramatic Art, and worked in the performing and visual arts. He lived and worked abroad for many years before returning to Australia, where his talent was fostered by the Aboriginal National Theatre Trust, which was established in 1988. In 1988 he adopted the Indigenous name Kabul Oodgeroo Noonuccal, &quot;kabul&quot; meaning &quot;carpet snake&quot;, and in the same year co-authored &quot;The Rainbow Serpent&quot; with his mother, for Expo 88. In March 1990 he directed the world premiere of &quot;Munjong&quot;, by Richard Walley, at the Victorian Arts Centre. He died on 20 February 1991.

Oodgeroo Noonuccal died from cancer on 16 September 1993 at the Repatriation General Hospital at Greenslopes, Brisbane, aged 72 years and was buried at Moongalba on North Stradbroke Island.

==In culture==
A play has been written by Sam Watson entitled &quot;Oodgeroo: Bloodline to Country&quot;, based on Oodgeroo Noonuccal&#x27;s real-life experience as an Aboriginal woman on board a flight hijacked by Palestinian terrorists on her way home from a committee meeting in Nigeria for the World Black and African Festival of Arts and Culture

Noonuccal&#x27;s poetry has been set to music by numerous composers, including Christopher Gordon, Clare Maclean, Stephen Leek, Andrew Ford, Paul Stanhope, Mary Mageau, and Joseph Twist.

==Recognition==
Oodgeroo won several literary awards, including the Mary Gilmore Medal (1970), the Jessie Litchfield Award (1975), and the FAW Patricia Weickhardt Award to an Aboriginal Writer (1985).

She received an honorary Doctorate of Letters from Macquarie University for her contribution to Australian literature in 1988. She was also made an honorary Doctor of the university by Griffith University in 1989, and was awarded a further honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1991 by Monash University. In 1992, Oodgeroo Noonuccal received an honorary Doctorate from the Faculty of Education Queensland University of Technology for both her contribution to literature and in recognition of her work in the field of education.

In 1979, she was awarded the Sixth Annual Oscar at the Micheaux Awards Ceremony, hosted by the US Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame and in the same year received the International Acting Award for the film Shadow Sisters.

She was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1970, but returned the award in 1987 in protest at the Australian Bicentenary celebrations in order to make a political statement about the condition of her people.

In 1985, she was named Aboriginal of the Year, by the &quot;National Aborigines Day Observance Committee&quot; (NADOC, now NAIDOC), an honour bestowed by Indigenous people.

In 1991, the commemorative plaque with her name on it was one of the first installed on Sydney Writers Walk.

In 1992 Queensland University of Technology (QUT) awarded her an honorary doctorate from the Faculty of Education recognising her contributions to literature and education. In 2006 the university renamed their Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Support Unit as the Oodgeroo Unit in her honour. The university also has the Oodgeroo Scholarship Program which provides undergraduate and postgraduate scholarships for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, she was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for her role as an &quot;Influential Artist&quot;.

In 2016 the Queensland Poetry Festival introduced an Indigenous program which included the inaugural Oodgeroo Noonuccal Indigenous Poetry Prize.

The electoral district of Oodgeroo created in the 2017 Queensland state electoral redistribution was named after her.

<doc id="1114705" wikidata="Q138393" url="?curid=1114705" title="Óscar Freire">
<text>Óscar Freire Gómez (born 15 February 1976) is a Spanish former professional road bicycle racer. He was one of the top sprinters in road bicycle racing, having won the world championship three times, equalling Alfredo Binda, Rik Van Steenbergen, Eddy Merckx and Peter Sagan. In the later years of his career, he became more of a classics rider. He won the cycling monument Milan–San Remo three times, the green jersey and four stages in the Tour de France and seven stages of the Vuelta a España, throughout a successful career.

Despite his diminutive stature, Freire was a world class sprinter. He had a training philosophy where he rode shorter distances than most professional cyclists, sometimes covering only about half the distance his colleagues would. When growing up he contracted tuberculosis and narrowly avoided having a leg amputated.

==Career==

===Vitalicio Seguros (1998–1999)===
Born in Torrelavega, Cantabria, (where the town has named a velodrome in his honour) Freire became professional in 1998 with Vitalicio Seguros. He won one race that year, a stage of the Vuelta a Castilla y León. He came 11th in Paris–Tours. 

In 1999, Freire won little until the UCI World Championship Road Race in October. He went to Verona to make up numbers in the Spanish team. He spent his prize on an elevator for his grandmother&#x27;s apartment. After his victory, as with all his victories, his grandmother sung a regional folk song on his telephone. Prior to winning the World Championships, ONCE had expressed interest in signing him, but following victory his inflated price was too high, meaning that he never rode for a native team again.

===Mapei–Quick Step (2000–2002)===

Freire joined Mapei in 2000. Upon joining the team, he spent his salary on a new family home for his parents and grandmother. It had been ranked best team since 1994. That year he won 11 races including two stages in the Vuelta a España. He also came third place in the UCI World Championship Road Race. 

In 2001 he won two races and took the points competition in the Vuelta a Burgos, before becoming world champion for the second time by winning the 2001 UCI Road World Championships – Men&#x27;s road race in Lisbon.

In 2002 he won a stage in the Tour de France. 
===Rabobank (2003–2011)===
In 2003, Freire moved to Rabobank, where in his first season he won six races. 

In 2004 he won Milan–San Remo, Trofeo Luis Puig, a stage and second place overall in Tirreno–Adriatico, a stage in the Vuelta a España and for the third time, and the second time in Verona, the world championship road race. 

He started 2005 winning three stages, the points classification and the yellow jersey at Tirreno–Adriatico, as well as the Brabantse Pijl, Trofeo Alcúdia and Trofeo Mallorca, all before the end of March. His season was then cut short by a saddle sore.

In 2006, Freire won his second consecutive Brabantse Pijl. His stage 3 win at Tirreno–Adriatico allowed him to lead for two days. At the Tour de Suisse, he survived an early break of four riders to win alone on stage 7. Freire won the fifth and ninth stages in the 2006 Tour de France and was contesting the points classification when he retired due to illness. During stage twelve, he was in a breakaway with three others. Freire&#x27;s career has been blighted with injury and lay-offs. He had back problems, saddle sores and neck problems.
When Yaroslav Popovych, riding for the Discovery Channel Pro Cycling Team, rode away for victory, rumours spread that Freire had been ordered by Rabobank not to ride for the victory, to secure help from the Discovery Team in the mountains. Although rumours were denied by both teams, Freire was upset after the stage. Freire continued his successful year by winning the Vattenfall Cyclassics ahead of German favourite Erik Zabel. Freire had half of Rabobank&#x27;s victories in 2006. His season was cut short by neck and spinal injuries, forcing him to miss the Vuelta a España and world championship. 

Freire re-signed for Rabobank in late 2006 until the end of 2008, rejecting Saunier Duval–Prodir.
In the 2007 Tour de France, he did not win a stage, partly because Rabobank was defending Michael Rasmussen&#x27;s lead for a large part of the race. But he won three stages in the Vuelta a España. 

In the 2008 Tour, Freire wore the green jersey from stage 8. He won stage 14 and the points classification. 

In the 2009 Tour he and Julian Dean were shot by an air rifle during the 13th stage from Vittel to Colmar. He was shot in the thigh and finished the stage 117th.

In March 2010, Freire won the 2010 Milan–San Remo in front of Tom Boonen and Alessandro Petacchi. On 10 October 2010 Freire became the first Spaniard to win Paris–Tours and in doing so became the new holder of the Ruban Jaune for setting the fastest average speed in a classic race, he covered the 233 km at an average of 47.73 km per hour.

Shortly before the 2011 UCI Road World Championships it was announced that Óscar Freire would retire at the end of the season if he did not win the World Championship road race. Freire ended negotiations to continue his contract with his team before the race, and noted health issues include worsening respiratory problems, having had sinus and nasal surgery in the last two years. He was unable to race the 2011 Tour de France and was forced to abandon the 2011 Vuelta a España.

===Team Katusha (2012)===
Initially, Freire planned to finish his career by 2012, but at the end of season 2011 he suddenly changed his mind. While his home Rabobank team, confused by the situation and Oscar&#x27;s indecision, failed to provide him an extension for another year, Freire had to start talks with other teams. Omega Pharma–Quick-Step, Lotto–Belisol and Geox–TMC expressed their interest to secure his service for season 2012, but Freire chose Team Katusha. He was reported to have been swayed by Team Katusha because the Russian team had a good number of other Spanish riders on its roster along with its well-organised structure and guaranteed entry into WorldTour races.

By 2012 Freire fully recovered from his previous health problems and managed to show very good results at the first opening races. In January he won stage 3 of Australian Tour Down Under, and then completed his success at stage 3 of Vuelta a Andalucía. At the spring classics Óscar Freire finished 7th at Milan–San Remo, while having taken two second places: one at E3 Harelbeke where he was edged on the line by Tom Boonen () and the other at the Brabantse Pijl, where he dominated the sprint of the chasers after lone escapee Thomas Voeckler of had crossed the line. He then went on to finish 4th in the Amstel Gold Race. He escaped from the lead group with to cover and held an advantage of 18 seconds at the bottom of the final climb, the Cauberg. He was passed in the final meters, but managed to hold on for fourth.

In an interview to the French magazine &quot;Velochrono&quot;, Freire claimed to take part in the Olympics in London along with the Tour de France and UCI Road World Championships. Freire later admitted that he was contemplating retirement if he didn&#x27;t win the rainbow jersey, and that he would keep riding for another year or two if he wins the 2012 UCI Championships. He retired from professional cycling at the end of 2012, reportedly refusing a deal from , who would have liked him to race for the 2013 season and then take a post in management. The Basque team was suspected of trying to hoard in Freire&#x27;s crucial UCI World Tour points, which would help them get a World Tour license for 2013, but the team management denied it. In retirement he went to live, with his family, in Switzerland.

<text>Thierry Marc Boutsen (; born 13 July 1957) is a Belgian former racing driver, businessman and motorsport executive, who competed in Formula One from to . Boutsen won three Formula One Grands Prix across 11 seasons. 

Boutsen competed in Formula One for Arrows, Benetton, Williams, Ligier and Jordan. He finished fourth in the 1988 World Drivers&#x27; Championship with Benetton. Boutsen also competed in 10 editions of the 24 Hours of Le Mans from to , finishing runner-up in and with Peugeot and Porsche, respectively.

Since retiring from motor racing, Boutsen has moved into the aviation industry, selling business jets from his firm in Monaco. He is also the founder, co-owner and advisor to Boutsen Racing, who have competed in touring car racing since 1998.

==Career==

===Junior formulae and sportscars===
After winning the &quot;Volant V&quot; in 1977 at the André Pilette Racing School, Zolder, Boutsen entered the Belgian Formula Ford 1600 championship and won it in 1978 with 15 victories in 18 races. He also entered the 1978 Spa 24 Hours race, the last auto race on the old 14 km (8.7 mi) Spa-Francorchamps circuit- driving a Toyota Trueno. For 1979 he moved to Formula 3, winning three races in 1980 and second place in the European title race, behind Michele Alboreto. In 1981 he moved to Formula 2 and was again second in the European championship, including winning at the 14-mile Nürburgring- this time behind Geoff Lees.

He also entered the 1981 24 Hours of Le Mans. The race started at 3pm in unusually hot weather – one hour earlier than usual due to the Parliamentary elections held on the same weekend. At 4:06pm Boutsen suffered a massive accident just after the Hunaudières kink, some before the Mulsanne bosse (the &quot;hump&quot;) when his WM P81-Peugeot was travelling at some . A suspension piece had failed and the car hit the guard-rail losing the entire rear end. Boutsen was untouched, but the debris field of hurled parts and bodywork was spread over . Three marshals and a gendarme were struck by the debris. One of them, Thierry Mabilat, was killed - struck in the chest by a detached piece of the guard rail. The other two marshals, Claude Hertault and Serge David (who lost an arm), and the gendarme were all seriously injured.

In 1983 Boutsen drove in the European Touring Car Championship and in World Sportscar races, where he won the very first Group C race, the Monza 1000 km with Bob Wollek driving a Porsche 956. He also won the famous Daytona 24-hour race in 1985, co-driving the Porsche 956 from the Preston Henn Racing with Bob Wollek, A. J. Foyt and Al Unser Sr.

===Formula One===
====Arrows====
Boutsen was considered a promising driver, testing for McLaren and Brabham. He was briefly attached to the Spirit Honda F1 project before losing out to his Formula Two teammate Stefan Johansson. In 1983 he paid $500,000 for a drive in Formula One and made his debut with Arrows at his home race, the 1983 Belgian Grand Prix at the shortened 7 km (4.3 mi) Spa. While he scored no points in 1983 his careful handling and close performance compared to experienced teammate Marc Surer allowed him to foster a positive reputation within the team. With backing from Barclay cigarettes he remained with Arrows for a further three seasons. The first saw Arrows struggle with their difficult first turbocharged car, with powerful BMW turbo engines but poor handling. Boutsen scored points twice in the old Cosworth DFV powered A6 and once in the turbo machine. His second season saw several notable results, including 2nd place at Imola. Boutsen crossed the line third, behind Alain Prost and Elio de Angelis but after the race, Prost was disqualified because his car was 2 kg underweight. Three more points scores saw him 11th overall in the standings. A final season with Arrows saw no points for Boutsen in an uncompetitive car, but in parallel to F1 he drove for the Walter Brun team in Group C and clinched the World Championship title with them in 1986, winning that year&#x27;s Spa 1000 km.

====Benetton====

Boutsen got his big chance when he switched to the works Ford Europe F1 team, Benetton, for the season as teammate to Teo Fabi. While the package wasn&#x27;t a race winner, it did allow him to run regularly in the top 6. He scored points in six races, his best being awarded 3rd place in Adelaide after the disqualification of Ayrton Senna&#x27;s Lotus and moved to 8th overall. At the Australian Grand Prix, Boutsen was furious with Fabi when the Italian refused to let his teammate lap him for a number of laps. When Boutsen confronted Fabi about this after the race, a frustrated Fabi (who had been unable to find an F1 drive for ), told the Belgian to &quot;come back and see me when you have a pole position&quot;. Fabi scored no wins in his F1 career but did have 3 poles to his name while at that stage Boutsen could only boast his 2nd place at Imola in 1985.

 saw Boutsen with a new teammate, the Italian Alessandro Nannini. When Cosworth stopped development of their turbocharged V6 engine, Benetton were forced to switch to normally aspirated Ford DFR V8 engines in anticipation of the banning of turbos in 1989. Boutsen&#x27;s consistency, mechanical sympathy and speed in the Rory Byrne designed Benetton B188 saw him score points in 10 of the 16 races, including five 3rd-place finishes (all behind the all-conquering McLaren-Honda cars), and place 4th overall as the best non-turbo driver in the field.

====Williams====
Frank Williams signed Boutsen in the summer of 1988 to replace Nigel Mansell for 1989 as Mansell had signed to move to Ferrari. Boutsen&#x27;s reputation as a reliable, fast driver with good development skills saw Williams sign him on a two-year contract.

For 1989, he drove the new V10 Renault powered Williams FW12C. began with Boutsen on the back foot due to a heavy pre-season testing crash in Rio and because veteran teammate Riccardo Patrese had a major resurgence in form. However at the Canadian Grand Prix, Boutsen drove well in wet conditions and took his maiden victory after Senna suffered a late engine failure. Although it was a welcome win (Boutsen became the first new winner in F1 since former Arrows teammate Gerhard Berger had won the 1986 Mexican Grand Prix for Benetton), it was considered a lucky win for the Belgian as he had been last at one stage and had a full 360° spin, though luckily he managed to keep his car off the walls. He managed to catch and pass Patrese who was suffering with a loose undertray and took the lead 3 laps from the end when the Honda V10 engine in Senna&#x27;s McLaren MP4/5 seized. Three more podium finishes came before Boutsen rounded the year off with a second victory at the rain-soaked Australian Grand Prix. Ironically Boutsen had been one of the drivers protesting about the conditions at the circuit before the race.

 saw more consistent points scoring drives, including his third and final Grand Prix victory - a lights-to-flag victory in Hungary where he took his first pole position and held off sustained pressure from Alessandro Nannini (Benetton) and Ayrton Senna (McLaren) to win. However, with Nigel Mansell available in 1991, Williams felt they needed a &#x27;star&#x27; driver to put together a championship bid. Despite Boutsen winning three races in two years to Patrese&#x27;s one and finishing every race in 1990 in the points (top 6) barring retirements, the team felt that Patrese had been more consistent (and had worked well with Mansell in 1988) and decided to keep the Italian to drive alongside Mansell.

====Ligier====

With no vacancies among the top teams Boutsen had to drop down to the Ligier team. Despite having a sizeable budget and Lamborghini V12 engines, the JS35 was an uncompetitive car and Boutsen was frequently unable to disguise his disgust with the machinery given to him. The arrival of Renault engines in 1992 improved matters a little and in his final race for the team he scored 5th place, his first points since leaving Williams.

====Jordan====
Initially he was unable to find a drive for 1993 but Barclay secured him a slot at Jordan, replacing Ivan Capelli. Boutsen was too tall for the car and largely outpaced by young teammate Rubens Barrichello, failing to score any points in ten races. With Eddie Jordan keen to bring in younger, well-sponsored drivers to the seat the decision was taken to turn Boutsen&#x27;s home race into a farewell event, though he retired on the first lap.

===Touring cars===

For 1994, Boutsen was hired by Ford Motorsport to lead their works challenge on the newly created Super Tourenwagen Cup in Germany. Driving a factory prepared Ford Mondeo built by Eggenberger Motorsport, that first season was a learning year for both Boutsen and the team.

The following year, Boutsen was joined by his old Williams teammate Riccardo Patrese, but the season was a disaster. Attempting to follow Audi&#x27;s lead by developing a four-wheel drive car, the Mondeo was totally uncompetitive.

Boutsen started in only the first four races in 1996 before leaving the team and turning his attention to sports car racing. After three years of limited success, Ford pulled the plug on the project at the end of that season to focus solely on the British series.

===Sportscars===
Boutsen then drove sports cars in the US, driving for Champion Racing in a Porsche 911 GT1, alongside Bill Adam and Hans Stuck. The trio finished 2nd in class at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 1997, Boutsen won the GT-1 US Championship with the Champion Racing in 1998. After a crash at Le Mans in 1999 at the wheel of a Toyota GT-One he retired from racing altogether.

==Helmet==

Boutsen&#x27;s helmet was black with a red, orange and yellow ribbon design surrounding the visor and the rear area. The colours used are the colours of the Belgian flag (except for orange).

==Business==
Today Boutsen runs his own company, Boutsen Aviation, in Monaco. Its business is the &quot;Sale and Acquisition of Business Jets&quot;. He founded the company in 1997 with his wife Daniela and up to May 2011, the company had sold 205 aircraft, ranging from Airbus Corporate Jets to Cessna Citation. He is also co-owner of Boutsen Energy Racing alongside his brother-in-law Olivier Lainé and Georges Kaczka. The team competes in the Formula Le Mans class in the Le Mans Series. Boutsen also runs cars in Formula Renault and Eurocup Mégane Trophy.

<text>George Schoener, or Georg Schöner (March 21, 1864 – October 2, 1941) was a German-born Roman Catholic priest who became known in the United States as the &quot;Padre of the Roses&quot; for his experiments in rose breeding, especially in the use of wild species. Only two of his creations survive today, however: &#x27;Arrilaga&#x27; and &#x27;Schoener&#x27;s Nutkana&#x27;.

He was born into a peasant family of Steinach, Baden. He studied in Engelberg and Einsiedeln from 1883 to 1889. An aunt enabled him to emigrate to America, where he became a priest in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Afflicted with illnesses, he ended up in Brooks, Oregon in 1911, where the rose growing activity in nearby Portland caught his interest. He searched the nearby hills for specimens of wild species such as &quot;Rosa nutkana&quot;.

A fire in 1915 destroyed church and house, and in 1917 he moved to Santa Barbara, California.
In 1939 he took up a position at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, California, but died just two years later.

The &quot;Georg-Schöner-Schule&quot;, a primary school in his hometown, Steinach, is named after him.

<text>The [[Paddle steamer|PS]] &quot;Medway Queen&quot; is a paddle driven steamship, the only mobile estuary paddle steamer left in the United Kingdom. She was one of the &quot;little ships of Dunkirk&quot;, making a record seven trips and rescuing 7,000 men in the evacuation of Dunkirk.

She was the subject of a £1.8 million National Lottery Heritage Memorial Fund grant to restore her hull. By 2014, her hull had been reconstructed and she is berthed at Gillingham Pier on the River Medway . In 2024, she celebrated her centenary.

==History==
PS &quot;Medway Queen&quot; was built by the Ailsa Shipbuilding Company at Troon, Scotland, in 1924 for service on the River Medway and in the Thames Estuary. Trialled on the River Clyde, she was delivered to be part of the &quot;Queen Line&quot; fleet of the New Medway Steam Packet Company based at Rochester, Kent. She steamed on routes from Strood and Chatham, to Sheerness, Herne Bay and Margate in Kent, and to Clacton and Southend in Essex.

On 3 August 1929, &quot;Medway Queen&quot; collided with Southend Pier, Essex, and suffered extensive damage to her bows.

After attending the Coronation Fleet Review for King George VI at Spithead, &quot;Medway Queen&quot; was converted to oil-fired steaming by Wallsend Slipway &amp; Engineering Company in 1937.

===World War II===
Requisitioned by the Royal Navy on 9 September 1939, her first task was evacuating Kent children from Gravesend to East Anglia. She was refitted at the shipyard of the General Steam Navigation Company in Deptford Creek as a minesweeper, her stern being modified to take sweeping gear, being fitted with a 12-pounder gun and two machine guns, and allocated pennant number J 48 (N 48). She served for the duration of World War II in the 10th Minesweeping Flotilla, patrolling the Strait of Dover and the English Channel.

In May 1940 Operation Dynamo was launched to rescue retreating British Army soldiers from Dunkirk in northern France. HMS &quot;Medway Queen&quot; became part of the flotilla of little ships. She left with paddle steamers &quot;Sandown&quot;, &quot;Thames Queen&quot;, &quot;Gracie Fields&quot;, &quot;Queen of Thanet&quot;, , &quot;Laguna Belle&quot; and &quot;Brighton Belle&quot;. She made seven crossings.

On her first trip, approximately 600 soldiers were taken off De Panne beach in lifeboats and ferried to the ship. On her return to Dover, her arrival coincided with an air raid. She shot down a German aircraft outside the harbour. The &quot;Brighton Belle&quot; ran over sunken wreckage and began to sink. All of her passengers and crew were rescued by the &quot;Medway Queen&quot; without loss of life and, heavily overloaded, she made the harbour.

On her second trip she took about 450 soldiers directly off the beach; this required more skill, but was much faster. Soldiers used a technique with oily bags to conceal their distinctive wash from patrolling aircraft. On later trips, the &quot;Medway Queen&quot; penetrated the damaged Dunkirk port and took off men from a concrete jetty or mole. Men were discharged at Ramsgate rather than Dover, where the vessel was fuelled and reprovisioned.

On Monday 3 June Vice Admiral Ramsey gave the order that all ships were to leave Dunkirk by 2.30 the following morning. This was the &quot;Medway Queen&quot;&#x27;s seventh trip. She was at the mole in Dunkirk when a destroyer moored astern of her was driven forwards by an explosion and smashed her starboard paddle box, she sustained considerable damage. &quot;Medway Queen&quot; limped back to Dover with 400 French soldiers on board. On arriving back at Dover the crew of the &quot;Medway Queen&quot; discovered that the Admiralty had reported their ship as having been sunk (news which was reported throughout the UK); the Admiralty published a correction the following morning.

Her crew gained seven awards for gallantry – two Distinguished Service Crosses, three Distinguished Service Medals and two mentions in dispatches – having made seven crossings and rescued 7,000 men. In view of this remarkable achievement in rescuing so many Allied troops from France, she earned the title of &quot;The Heroine of Dunkirk&quot;. After repairs in Portsmouth Dockyard, she returned to minesweeping duties, and in 1942 she was converted to a minesweeping training ship, serving out the war in this capacity, and was returned to her owners in January 1946.

===Return to service===
Rebuilt by Thornycrofts of Southampton in 1946, she returned to civilian service with New Medway Steam Packet Company for the 1947 season. &quot;Medway Queen&quot; attended the 1953 Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead.

She made her last sailing on 8 September 1963, and was scheduled to be scrapped in Belgium. The Belgian ship-breaker, upon discovering that the vessel he was expecting to break up was &quot;The Heroine of Dunkirk&quot;, declined to continue (it is reported that he felt that no one should dare to destroy such a gallant and important little ship). The Daily Mail campaigned to save her.

===Use as nightclub===
Having been saved from scrapping, &quot;Medway Queen&quot; was eventually sold for use as a nightclub and marina clubhouse, and was moored at the Medway Queen Marina (now known as the Island Harbour Marina) on the Isle of Wight. The club opened in 1966. In 1970, a larger ship, PS &quot;Ryde&quot;, renamed as &quot;Ryde Queen&quot;, joined &quot;Medway Queen&quot; at the marina site, also operating as a nightclub. The two premises operated alongside one another for a period, until the &quot;Medway Queen&quot; was eventually closed and fell into disrepair.

===Preservation===
In 1978 the &quot;Medway Queen&quot; was bought by private owners with the aim of preserving her. She was moved out of the marina to the adjacent River Medina, but sank in the river when the hull sprang a leak. There she remained, in a state of increasing deterioration, until in 1984 she was salvaged, moved to Cowes at the river’s mouth, and thence towed back to Chatham in Kent on a salvage barge. In 1985 the Medway Queen Preservation Society formed, with the intention of preserving the historic ship.

In 1987 she was moved to Damhead Creek, Kingsnorth on the Hoo Peninsula, but the trust lacked funds to bring her back to service, and struggled to preserve the structure. After a series of near disasters, in 2006 the National Lottery Heritage Memorial Fund agreed a £1.8 million funding package to restore her structure, subject to the society raising £225,000. Although the funds were raised, neither the insurance company nor marine engineers were confident that her hull was seaworthy and able to sustain lifting on to a pontoon. In October 2006, the Trust agreed to the deconstruction of the hull, and salvageable pieces were moved to Gillingham Pier (and a National Lottery funded warehouse) in Chatham Dockyard, in preparation of the hull being professionally restored to seaworthy condition.

In October 2008, the society signed a contract with David Abels Shipbuilders to restore the hull at the Albion Dry Dock in Bristol, using plate riveting. Work began in April 2009 and was due to be completed in the summer of 2010. On 27 July 2013 the ship was rededicated. Plans were to float her out of the Albion Dock during the summer of 2013 and tow her back to Gillingham for a reception on 2 November.

The tow home to Gillingham using the tug &quot;Christine&quot; started from Bristol on 24 October 2013. Weather conditions meant they were held up at Avonmouth until 15 November when the wind abated sufficiently, and the tow around Land&#x27;s End and through the English Channel continued in safety. The tug and tow finally arrived on the River Medway on Monday 18 November 2013. Due mainly to tidal restriction, the &quot;Medway Queen&quot; was buoyed in Saltpan Reach until high tide the following day. On 19 November the &quot;Medway Queen&quot; made the final leg of her journey to her new home at Gillingham Pier, guided by tug master Alan Pratt, with the ship welcomed by a large crowd and TV crews.

In July 2021 the &quot;Medway Queen&quot; was towed to the Royal Harbour, Ramsgate for a major refurbishment, including repairs to the paddle wheels, hull and new handrails, before returning to Gillingham.

==Cultural references==
The ship features in the 1964 Ken Russell film &quot;French Dressing&quot;.

==Official number and code letters==
Official Numbers provided, on a national basis, a unique identifier for a ship, regardless of change of name. &quot;Medway Queen&quot; had the UK Official Number 148361. 

She used the Code Letters GGNG between about 1944 and 1950.

==Timeline==
*1924 – built Troon, Scotland, by the Ailsa Yard for service on the River Medway and the Thames Estuary. Trialled on the River Clyde
*1925 – worked on River Medway and the Thames Estuary, part of the &quot;Queen Line&quot; fleet of the New Medway Steam Packet Company based at Rochester, Kent
*1937 – attended the Coronation Review for George VI at Spithead
*1938 – converted by Wallsend Engineering from coal to oil burning, by Wallsend Engineering
*1939 – carried children evacuated from Kent to East Anglia. Joined Royal Navy as minesweeper No J 48 (N 48), serving for the duration of the war in the 10th minesweeping flotilla in the English Channel
*1940 – became part of the flotilla of ships evacuating British Army soldiers from Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo. After making seven trips (the record number of crossings by any merchant navy ship involved in the evacuation), she rescued over 7,000 men, gaining for the ship&#x27;s crew seven awards for gallantry, and shot down three enemy aircraft. At one time during the evacuation, she was overdue and was thought to have been lost with all hands and troops – but she eventually arrived back at Dover, ready to return to France for more troops. The efforts of the ship and her crew earned the paddle steamer the title of &quot;Heroine of Dunkirk&quot;
*1946 – rebuilt by Thorneycrofts of Southampton
*1947 – returned to civilian service with New Medway Steam Packet Company
*1953 – attended the Coronation Review for Queen Elizabeth II at Spithead
*1963 – taken out of service, with the possibility of being broken up, but the Belgian shipbreaker declined to break up the &quot;Heroine of Dunkirk&quot;
*1964 – sold, and later opened as a nightclub on the Isle of Wight
*1970s – replaced by the larger PS &quot;Ryde&quot; and moved to the River Medina, but sank when the hull sprang a leak
*1984 – raised and towed back to the River Medway on a pontoon by new owners
*???? – abandoned and sank again, while moored against the wall of Chatham Dockyard
*1985 – the Medway Queen Preservation Society formed, with the intention of preserving the ship
*1987 – raised and moved to Damhead Creek, Kingsnorth on the Hoo Peninsula
*2006 – the National Lottery Heritage Memorial Fund agreed a £1.8 million funding package to restore the structure, subject to the Society raising £225,000
*2006 – deconstructed, as hull considered both unseaworthy and of sustaining lifting onto a pontoon. The hull and salvageable pieces were moved to Chatham Dockyard
*2009 – restoration began in April, with new hull to be constructed at Albion Shipyard, Bristol.
*2011 – Visitors&#x27; Centre opened at Gillingham Pier, funded by the European Heroes2c project with sister projects Association Tourville and de Steenschuit
*2013 – new hull entered the River Medway at Sheerness under tow from Bristol on 18 November 2013

<doc id="1114729" wikidata="Q135578" url="?curid=1114729" title="Yohoia">
<text>Yohoia is an extinct genus of megacheiran arthropod from the Cambrian period that has been found as fossils in the Burgess Shale formation of British Columbia, Canada. The type species, &quot;Yohoia tenuis&quot;, was described in 1912 by Walcott, who considered it an anostracan crustacean. 711 specimens of &quot;Yohoia&quot; are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed, where they comprise 1.35% of the community. In 2015, Conway Morris &quot;et al.&quot; reported another species, &quot;Y. utahana&quot;, from the Marjum Formation, Utah.

== Description ==

Fossil specimens of &quot;Yohoia&quot; range in size from 7 to 23 mm, they have a head shield which is followed by 13 trunk tergites, or plates. On both sides, the bottom side of the first 10 of these ended in backward-pointing, triangular points or projections. The last three plates were complete tubes, circling the entire trunk. At the end of the trunk was a paddle-like tail. There were also a pair of large extensions at the front of the head shield. They had a pronounced &quot;elbow&quot; and ended in four long spines, looking rather like fingers. There were three appendages on the bottom of the head shield on each side, and these are assumed to have supported the creature on the sandy or silty sea bottom. There were also single appendages hanging down under the body plates which were flap-like and fringed with setae, probably used for swimming and respiration. Specimens also show some bulbous formations at the front of the head shield that may have served as eyes.

== Classification ==
&quot;Yohoia&quot; is one of the &quot;great appendage&quot; arthropods. All taxa have a single pair of large pre-oral jointed limbs with branched spiny ends for grasping, impaling, or filtering food items. &quot;Great appendage&quot; arthropods have been seen as a polyphyletic group where the appendage has independently evolved, or as a class Megacheira including &quot;Yohoia&quot; (with &quot;Leanchoilia&quot;, &quot;Alalcomenaeus&quot;, &quot;Oestokerkus&quot;, &quot;Fortiforceps&quot;, &quot;Jianfengia&quot;, &quot;Yawunik&quot;) defined as euarthropods, plus the radiodonts, defined as a sister group to arthropods. &quot;Yohoia-&quot;like genera are small and have biramous limbs with a walking segment, while radiodonts are larger animals without limbs except for the great appendage. (Although biramous limbs have been described in the Devonian radiodont &quot;Schinderhannes&quot;, this interpretation is highly questioned and it is more likely to be bands of gill lamellae instead.)

== Ecology ==
&quot;Yohoia&quot; is assumed to have been a mainly benthic (bottom-dwelling) creature that swam just above the muddy ocean floor, using its appendages to scavenge or capture prey.

<doc id="1114731" wikidata="Q810952" url="?curid=1114731" title="Battery eliminator circuit">
<text>In battery-powered equipment, a battery eliminator circuit (BEC) is an electronic voltage regulator used to power a subsystem at a different voltage without the need for a supplemental battery. BECs are commonly used in radio-controlled models, which need separate voltages to power the motor and the RC equipment.

== Radio-controlled (RC) models ==
In an electric-powered radio-controlled model, the BEC is typically part of the electronic speed control (ESC). BEC allows such a model to carry only one battery (the motive power battery) instead of two (motive power, and a separate battery to operate the RC equipment). A BEC-equipped ESC meant for airplane use often incorporates a low-voltage-cutoff (LVC) circuit which can sense the voltage drop caused when the battery has little charge left. It then cuts the power to the &#x27;drive&#x27; motor in order to provide the &#x27;steering&#x27; servo(s) with enough power to be able to bring the model safely back to the operator. The power to the propeller is cut but the operation of the control surfaces would be maintained in order to perform a dead-stick landing. Without this feature, all control would be lost when the battery expired, probably resulting in the destruction of the model. In some cases, the BEC is part of the radio control receiver, instead of being part of the ESC.

RC BECs in their simplest form use a linear fixed voltage regulator with its standard circuit suggested in the manufacturer&#x27;s datasheet – usually the power supply of the receiver needs 5 V. Low-dropout types are preferred – especially for batteries with only a few cells. For small models, 1.5 to 2 A are enough; for mid-size models a 3 A type needs to be considered. BECs for large models have to provide current of 5 A or more. In this case, a more complicated switching mode regulator should be used, as the switching mode BECs are more electrically efficient than linear regulator BECs. The power dissipation losses in a linear regulator BEC are a product of the difference between the target voltage of 5 volts and the voltage of the main battery multiplied by the required current. For example, take a 10-cell NiMH accumulator with a normal voltage of 12 volts. With a peak current of 5 A, the BEC will have losses of (12 V − 5 V) × 5 A = 35 W. With a linear regulator, these 35 W will be converted to heat and so require a large heat sink. This is an efficiency of (5 V / 12 V) = 41.7%. However, a switching mode regulator with a buck step-down supply can achieve over 90% efficiency. In all cases, it is a good idea to mount some large capacitors to buffer the regulated output. In large plane or ship models, another possibility is to buffer the power supply with a further capacitor near the actuators (servos).

More recent uses for RC BECs are converting higher-voltage lithium polymer battery packs to 12 V. This has occurred due to the increased popularity of camera equipment for FPV use. Several BEC manufacturers offer a BEC (voltage regulator) for this purpose and people may become confused as this is &#x27;out of the ordinary&#x27; to use a BEC for a 12 V application.

BECs also come in several forms, SBEC &amp; UBEC being the main variety. See Voltage regulator

== Vehicles ==
BECs are also used in some motorcycle and ATV applications to reduce the weight penalty involved in carrying a battery. The battery is typically replaced by one or more large but light-weight capacitors which smooth out the fluctuating electrical pulses coming from the alternator, without themselves generating power. As there is no electrical power source, electrical starters cannot be used.

<text>The region of Palestine, also known as historic Palestine, is a geographical area in West Asia. It includes modern-day Israel and Palestine, as well as parts of northwestern Jordan in some definitions. Other names for the region include Canaan, the Promised Land, the Land of Israel, or the Holy Land.

The earliest written record referring to Palestine as a geographical region is in the &quot;Histories&quot; of Herodotus in the 5th century BCE, which calls the area &quot;Palaistine&quot;, referring to the territory previously held by Philistia, a state that existed in that area from the 12th to the 7th century BCE. The Roman Empire conquered the region and in 6 CE established the province known as Judaea. In 132 CE, in the period of the Bar Kokhba revolt, the province was expanded and renamed to Syria Palaestina. In 390, during the Byzantine period, the region was split into the provinces of Palaestina Prima, Palaestina Secunda, and Palaestina Tertia. Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant in the 630s, the military district of Jund Filastin was established. While Palestine&#x27;s boundaries have changed throughout history, it has generally comprised the southern portion of regions such as Syria or the Levant.

As the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity, Palestine has been a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. In the Bronze Age, it was home to Canaanite city-states; and the later Iron Age saw the emergence of Israel and Judah. It has since come under the sway of various empires, including the Neo-Assyrian Empire, the Neo-Babylonian Empire, the Achaemenid Empire, the Macedonian Empire, and the Seleucid Empire. The brief Hasmonean dynasty ended with its gradual incorporation into the Roman Empire, and later the Byzantine Empire, during which Palestine became a center of Christianity. In the 7th century, Palestine was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, ending Byzantine rule in the region; Rashidun rule was succeeded by the Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid Caliphate, and the Fatimid Caliphate. Following the collapse of the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had been established through the Crusades, the population of Palestine became predominantly Muslim. In the 13th century, it became part of the Mamluk Sultanate, and after 1516, spent four centuries as part of the Ottoman Empire.

During World War I, Palestine was occupied by the United Kingdom as part of the Sinai and Palestine campaign. Between 1919 and 1922, the League of Nations created the Mandate for Palestine, which came under British administration as Mandatory Palestine through the 1940s. Tensions between Jews and Arabs escalated into the 1947–1949 Palestine war, which ended with the establishment of Israel on most of the territory, and neighboring Jordan and Egypt controlling the West Bank and the Gaza Strip respectively. The 1967 Six-Day War saw Israel&#x27;s occupation of both territories, which has been among the core issues of the ongoing Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

== Etymology ==

Modern archaeology has identified 12 ancient inscriptions from Egyptian and Assyrian records recording likely cognates of Hebrew &quot;Pelesheth&quot;. The term &quot;Peleset&quot; (transliterated from hieroglyphs as &quot;P-r-s-t&quot;) is found in five inscriptions referring to a neighboring people or land starting from during the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt. The first known mention is at the temple at Medinet Habu which refers to the Peleset among those who fought with Egypt in Ramesses III&#x27;s reign, and the last known is 300 years later on Padiiset&#x27;s Statue. Seven known Assyrian inscriptions refer to the region of &quot;Palashtu&quot; or &quot;Pilistu&quot;, beginning with Adad-nirari III in the Nimrud Slab in through to a treaty made by Esarhaddon more than a century later. Neither the Egyptian nor the Assyrian sources provided clear regional boundaries for the term.

The first clear use of the term Palestine to refer to the entire area between Phoenicia and Egypt was in 5th century BCE ancient Greece, when Herodotus wrote of a &quot;district of Syria, called &quot;Palaistínē&quot;&quot; () in &quot;The Histories&quot;, which included the Judean mountains and the Jordan Rift Valley. Approximately a century later, Aristotle used a similar definition for the region in &quot;Meteorology&quot;, in which he included the Dead Sea. Later Greek writers such as Polemon and Pausanias also used the term to refer to the same region, which was followed by Roman writers such as Ovid, Tibullus, Pomponius Mela, Pliny the Elder, Dio Chrysostom, Statius, Plutarch as well as Romano-Jewish writers Philo of Alexandria and Josephus. The term was first used to denote an official province in , when the Roman authorities, following the suppression of the Bar Kokhba Revolt, renamed the province of Judaea &quot;Syria Palaestina&quot;. There is circumstantial evidence linking Hadrian with the name change, but the precise date is not certain.

The term is generally accepted to be a cognate of the biblical name &quot;Peleshet&quot; ( &quot;Pəlésheth&quot;, usually transliterated as Philistia). The term and its derivates are used more than 250 times in Masoretic-derived versions of the Hebrew Bible, of which 10 uses are in the Torah, with undefined boundaries, and almost 200 of the remaining references are in the Book of Judges and the Books of Samuel. The term is rarely used in the Septuagint, which used a transliteration &quot;Land of Phylistieim&quot; (), different from the contemporary Greek place name &quot;Palaistínē&quot; (). It is also theorized to be the portmanteau of the Greek word for the Philistines and &quot;palaistês&quot;, which means &quot;wrestler/rival/adversary&quot;. This aligns with the Greek practice of punning place names since the latter is also the etymological meaning for Israel.

The Septuagint instead used the term &quot;allophuloi&quot; (, &quot;other nations&quot;) throughout the Books of Judges and Samuel, such that the term &quot;Philistines&quot; has been interpreted to mean &quot;non-Israelites of the Promised Land&quot; when used in the context of Samson, Saul and David, and Rabbinic sources explain that these peoples were different from the Philistines of the Book of Genesis.

During the Byzantine period, the region of Palestine within Syria Palaestina was subdivided into Palaestina Prima and Secunda, and an area of land including the Negev and Sinai became Palaestina Salutaris. Following the Muslim conquest, place names that were in use by the Byzantine administration generally continued to be used in Arabic. The use of the name &quot;Palestine&quot; became common in Early Modern English, was used in English and Arabic during the Mutasarrifate of Jerusalem and was revived as an official place name with the British Mandate for Palestine.

Some other terms that have been used to refer to all or part of this land include Canaan, Land of Israel (Eretz Yisrael or Ha&#x27;aretz), the Promised Land, the region of Syria, the Holy Land, Iudaea Province, Judea, Coele-Syria, &quot;Israel HaShlema&quot;, Kingdom of Israel, Kingdom of Jerusalem, Zion, &quot;Retenu&quot; (Ancient Egyptian), Southern Syria, Southern Levant and Syria Palaestina.

== History ==

=== Overview ===

Situated at a strategic location between Egypt, Syria and Arabia, and the birthplace of Judaism and Christianity, the region has a long and tumultuous history as a crossroads for religion, culture, commerce, and politics. The region has been controlled by numerous peoples, including ancient Egyptians, Canaanites, Israelites, Assyrians, Babylonians, Achaemenids, ancient Greeks, Romans, Parthians, Sasanians, Byzantines, the Arab Rashidun, Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid caliphates, Crusaders, Ayyubids, Mamluks, Mongols, Ottomans, the British, and modern Israelis and Palestinians.
=== Ancient period ===
The region was among the earliest in the world to see human habitation, agricultural communities and civilization. During the Bronze Age, independent Canaanite city-states were established, and were influenced by the surrounding civilizations of ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Phoenicia, Minoan Crete, and Syria. Between 1550 and 1400BCE, the Canaanite cities became vassals to the Egyptian New Kingdom who held power until the 1178BCE Battle of Djahy (Canaan) during the wider Bronze Age collapse.

The Israelites emerged from a dramatic social transformation that took place in the people of the central hill country of Canaan around 1200BCE, with no signs of violent invasion or even of peaceful infiltration of a clearly defined ethnic group from elsewhere. During the Iron Age, the Israelites established two related kingdoms, Israel and Judah. The Kingdom of Israel emerged as an important local power by the 10th century BCE before falling to the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 722BCE. Israel&#x27;s southern neighbor, the Kingdom of Judah, emerged in the 8th or 9th century BCE and later became a client state of first the Neo-Assyrian and then the Neo-Babylonian Empire before a revolt against the latter led to its destruction in 586BCE. The region became part of the Neo-Assyrian Empire from , which was itself replaced by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in .

In 587/6BCE, Jerusalem was besieged and destroyed by the second Babylonian king, Nebuchadnezzar II, who subsequently exiled the Judeans to Babylon. The Kingdom of Judah was then annexed as a Babylonian province. The Philistines were also exiled. The defeat of Judah was recorded by the Babylonians.

In 539BCE, the Babylonian empire was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. According to the Hebrew Bible and implications from the Cyrus Cylinder, the exiled Jews were eventually allowed to return to Jerusalem. The returned population in Judah were allowed to self-rule under Persian governance, and some parts of the fallen kingdom became a Persian province known as Yehud. Except Yehud, at least another four Persian provinces existed in the region: Samaria, Gaza, Ashdod, and Ascalon, in addition to the Phoenician city states in the north and the Arabian tribes in the south. During the same period, the Edomites migrated from Transjordan to the southern parts of Judea, which became known as Idumaea. The Qedarites were the dominant Arab tribe; their territory ran from the Hejaz in the south to the Negev in the north through the period of Persian and Hellenistic dominion.

=== Classical antiquity ===
In the 330s BCE, Macedonian ruler Alexander the Great conquered the region, which changed hands several times during the wars of the Diadochi and later Syrian Wars. It ultimately fell to the Seleucid Empire between 219 and 200BCE. During that period, the region became heavily hellenized, building tensions between Greeks and locals.

In 167BCE, the Maccabean Revolt erupted, leading to the establishment of an independent Hasmonean Kingdom in Judea. From 110BCE, the Hasmoneans extended their authority over much of Palestine, including Samaria, Galilee, Iturea, Perea, and Idumea. The Jewish control over the wider region resulted in it also becoming known as Judaea, a term that had previously only referred to the smaller region of the Judaean Mountains. During the same period, the Edomites were converted to Judaism.

Between 73 and 63BCE, the Roman Republic extended its influence into the region in the Third Mithridatic War. Pompey conquered Judea in 63BCE, splitting the former Hasmonean Kingdom into five districts. In around 40BCE, the Parthians conquered Palestine, deposed the Roman ally Hyrcanus II, and installed a puppet ruler of the Hasmonean line known as Antigonus II. By 37BCE, the Parthians withdrew from Palestine.

Palestine is generally considered the &quot;Cradle of Christianity&quot;. Christianity, a religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus of Nazareth, arose as a messianic sect from within Second Temple Judaism. The three-year Ministry of Jesus, culminating in his crucifixion, is estimated to have occurred from 28 to 30CE, although the historicity of Jesus is disputed by a minority of scholars.

In the first and second centuries CE, the province of Judea became the site of two large-scale Jewish revolts against Rome. During the First Jewish-Roman War, which lasted from 66 to 73CE, the Romans razed Jerusalem and destroyed the Second Temple. In Masada, Jewish zealots preferred to commit suicide than endure Roman captivity. In 132CE, another Jewish rebellion erupted. The Bar Kokhba revolt took three years to put down, incurred massive costs on both the Romans and the Jews, and desolated much of Judea. The center of Jewish life in Palestine moved to the Galilee. During or after the revolt, Hadrian joined the province of Iudaea with Galilee and the Paralia to form the new province of Syria Palaestina, and Jerusalem was renamed &quot;Aelia Capitolina&quot;. Some scholars view these actions as an attempt to disconnect the Jewish people from their homeland, but this theory is debated.

Between 259 and 272, the region fell under the rule of Odaenathus as King of the Palmyrene Empire. Following the victory of Christian emperor Constantine in the Civil wars of the Tetrarchy, the Christianization of the Roman Empire began, and in 326, Constantine&#x27;s mother Saint Helena visited Jerusalem and began the construction of churches and shrines. Palestine became a center of Christianity, attracting numerous monks and religious scholars. The Samaritan Revolts during this period caused their near extinction. In 614CE, Palestine was annexed by another Persian dynasty; the Sassanids, until returning to Byzantine control in 628CE.

=== Early Muslim period ===

Palestine was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, beginning in 634CE. In 636, the Battle of Yarmouk during the Muslim conquest of the Levant marked the start of Muslim hegemony over the region, which became known as the military district of Jund Filastin within the province of Bilâd al-Shâm (Greater Syria). In 661, with the Assassination of Ali, Muawiyah I became the Caliph of the Islamic world after being crowned in Jerusalem. The Dome of the Rock, completed in 691, was the world&#x27;s first great work of Islamic architecture.

The majority of the population was Christian and was to remain so until the conquest of Saladin in 1187. The Muslim conquest apparently had little impact on social and administrative continuities for several decades. The word &#x27;Arab&#x27; at the time referred predominantly to Bedouin nomads, though Arab settlement is attested in the Judean highlands and near Jerusalem by the 5th century, and some tribes had converted to Christianity. The local population engaged in farming, which was considered demeaning, and were called &quot;Nabaț&quot;, referring to Aramaic-speaking villagers. A ḥadīth, brought in the name of a Muslim freedman who settled in Palestine, ordered the Muslim Arabs not to settle in the villages, &quot;for he who abides in villages it is as if he abides in graves&quot;.

The Umayyads, who had spurred a strong economic resurgence in the area, were replaced by the Abbasids in 750. Ramla became the administrative centre for the following centuries, while Tiberias became a thriving centre of Muslim scholarship. From 878, Palestine was ruled from Egypt by semi-autonomous rulers for almost a century, beginning with the Turkish freeman Ahmad ibn Tulun, for whom both Jews and Christians prayed when he lay dying and ending with the Ikhshidid rulers. Reverence for Jerusalem increased during this period, with many of the Egyptian rulers choosing to be buried there. However, the later period became characterized by persecution of Christians as the threat from Byzantium grew. The Fatimids, with a predominantly Berber army, conquered the region in 970, a date that marks the beginning of a period of unceasing warfare between numerous enemies, which destroyed Palestine, and in particular, devastating its Jewish population. Between 1071 and 1073, Palestine was captured by the Great Seljuq Empire, only to be recaptured by the Fatimids in 1098.

=== Crusader/Ayyubid period ===

The Fatimids again lost the region to the Crusaders in 1099. The Crusaders set up the Kingdom of Jerusalem (1099–1291). Their control of Jerusalem and most of Palestine lasted almost a century until their defeat by Saladin&#x27;s forces in 1187, after which most of Palestine was controlled by the Ayyubids, except for the years 1229–1244 when Jerusalem and other areas were retaken by the Second Kingdom of Jerusalem, by then ruled from Acre (1191–1291), but, despite seven further crusades, the Franks were no longer a significant power in the region. The Fourth Crusade, which did not reach Palestine, led directly to the decline of the Byzantine Empire, dramatically reducing Christian influence throughout the region.

=== Mamluk period ===
The Mamluk Sultanate was created in Egypt as an indirect result of the Seventh Crusade. The Mongol Empire reached Palestine for the first time in 1260, beginning with the Mongol raids into Palestine under Nestorian Christian general Kitbuqa, and reaching an apex at the pivotal Battle of Ain Jalut, where they were pushed back by the Mamluks.

=== Ottoman period ===

In 1486, hostilities broke out between the Mamluks and the Ottoman Empire in a battle for control over western Asia, and the Ottomans conquered Palestine in 1516. Between the mid-16th and 17th centuries, a close-knit alliance of three local dynasties, the Ridwans of Gaza, the Turabays of al-Lajjun and the Farrukhs of Nablus, governed Palestine on behalf of the Porte (imperial Ottoman government).
In the 18th century, the Zaydani clan under the leadership of Zahir al-Umar ruled large parts of Palestine autonomously until the Ottomans were able to defeat them in their Galilee strongholds in 1775–76. Zahir had turned the port city of Acre into a major regional power, partly fueled by his monopolization of the cotton and olive oil trade from Palestine to Europe. Acre&#x27;s regional dominance was further elevated under Zahir&#x27;s successor Ahmad Pasha al-Jazzar at the expense of Damascus.

In 1830, on the eve of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s invasion, the Porte transferred control of the sanjaks of Jerusalem and Nablus to Abdullah Pasha, the governor of Acre. According to Silverburg, in regional and cultural terms this move was important for creating an Arab Palestine detached from greater Syria (&quot;bilad al-Sham&quot;). According to Pappe, it was an attempt to reinforce the Syrian front in face of Muhammad Ali&#x27;s invasion. Two years later, Palestine was conquered by Muhammad Ali&#x27;s Egypt, but Egyptian rule was challenged in 1834 by a countrywide popular uprising against conscription and other measures considered intrusive by the population. Its suppression devastated many of Palestine&#x27;s villages and major towns.

In 1840, Britain intervened and returned control of the Levant to the Ottomans in return for further capitulations. The death of Aqil Agha marked the last local challenge to Ottoman centralization in Palestine, and beginning in the 1860s, Palestine underwent an acceleration in its socio-economic development, due to its incorporation into the global, and particularly European, economic pattern of growth. The beneficiaries of this process were Arabic-speaking Muslims and Christians who emerged as a new layer within the Arab elite. From 1880 large-scale Jewish immigration began, almost entirely from Europe, based on an explicitly Zionist ideology. There was also a revival of the Hebrew language and culture.

Christian Zionism in the United Kingdom preceded its spread within the Jewish community. The government of Great Britain publicly supported it during World War I with the Balfour Declaration of 1917.

=== British Mandate period ===

The British began their Sinai and Palestine Campaign in 1915. The war reached southern Palestine in 1917, progressing to Gaza and around Jerusalem by the end of the year. The British secured Jerusalem in December 1917. They moved into the Jordan valley in 1918 and a campaign by the Entente into northern Palestine led to victory at Megiddo in September.

The British were formally awarded the mandate to govern the region in 1922. The Arab Palestinians rioted in 1920, 1921, 1929, and revolted in 1936. In 1947, following World War II and The Holocaust, the British Government announced its desire to terminate the Mandate, and the United Nations General Assembly adopted in November 1947 a Resolution 181(II) recommending partition into an Arab state, a Jewish state and the Special International Regime for the City of Jerusalem. A civil war began immediately after the Resolution&#x27;s adoption. The State of Israel was declared in May 1948.

=== Arab–Israeli conflict ===

In the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, Israel captured and incorporated a further 26% of the Mandate territory, Jordan captured the regions of Judea and Samaria, renaming it the &quot;West Bank&quot;, while the Gaza Strip was captured by Egypt. Following the 1948 Palestinian expulsion and flight, also known as al-Nakba, the 700,000 Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes were not allowed to return following the Lausanne Conference of 1949.

In the course of the Six-Day War in June 1967, Israel captured the rest of Mandate Palestine from Jordan and Egypt, and began a policy of establishing Jewish settlements in those territories. From 1987 to 1993, the First Palestinian Intifada against Israel took place, which included the Declaration of the State of Palestine in 1988 and ended with the 1993 Oslo Peace Accords and the creation of the Palestinian National Authority.

In 2000, the Second Intifada (also called al-Aqsa Intifada) began, and Israel built a separation barrier. In the 2005 Israeli disengagement from Gaza, Israel withdrew all settlers and military presence from the Gaza Strip, but maintained military control of numerous aspects of the territory including its borders, air space and coast. Israel&#x27;s ongoing military occupation of the Gaza Strip, the West Bank and East Jerusalem continues to be the world&#x27;s longest military occupation in modern times.

In 2008 Palestinian hikaye was inscribed to UNESCO&#x27;s list of intangible cultural heritage; the first of four listings reflecting the significance of Palestinian culture globally.

In November 2012, the status of Palestinian delegation in the United Nations was upgraded to non-member observer state as the State of Palestine.

== Boundaries ==
=== Pre-modern period ===
The boundaries of Palestine have varied throughout history. The Jordan Rift Valley (comprising Wadi Arabah, the Dead Sea and River Jordan) has at times formed a political and administrative frontier, even within empires that have controlled both territories. At other times, such as during certain periods during the Hasmonean and Crusader states for example, as well as during the biblical period, territories on both sides of the river formed part of the same administrative unit. During the Arab Caliphate period, parts of southern Lebanon and the northern highland areas of Palestine and Jordan were administered as &quot;Jund al-Urdun&quot;, while the southern parts of the latter two formed part of &quot;Jund Dimashq&quot;, which during the 9th century was attached to the administrative unit of &quot;Jund Filastin&quot;.

The boundaries of the area and the ethnic nature of the people referred to by Herodotus in the 5th century BCE as Palaestina vary according to context. Sometimes, he uses it to refer to the coast north of Mount Carmel. Elsewhere, distinguishing the Syrians in Palestine from the Phoenicians, he refers to their land as extending down all the coast from Phoenicia to Egypt. Pliny, writing in Latin in the 1st century CE, describes a region of Syria that was &quot;formerly called &quot;Palaestina&quot;&quot; among the areas of the Eastern Mediterranean.

Since the Byzantine Period, the Byzantine borders of &quot;Palaestina&quot; (&quot;I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, also known as &quot;Palaestina Prima&quot;, &quot;First Palestine&quot;, and &quot;Palaestina Secunda&quot;, &quot;Second Palestine&quot;), have served as a name for the geographic area between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. Under Arab rule, &quot;Filastin&quot; (or &quot;Jund Filastin&quot;) was used administratively to refer to what was under the Byzantines &quot;Palaestina Secunda&quot; (comprising Judaea and Samaria), while &quot;Palaestina Prima&quot; (comprising the Galilee region) was renamed &quot;Urdunn&quot; (&quot;Jordan&quot; or &quot;Jund al-Urdunn&quot;).

=== Modern period ===

Nineteenth-century sources refer to Palestine as extending from the sea to the caravan route, presumably the Hejaz-Damascus route east of the Jordan River valley. Others refer to it as extending from the sea to the desert. Prior to the Allied Powers victory in World War I and the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire, which created the British mandate in the Levant, most of the northern area of what is today Jordan formed part of the Ottoman Vilayet of Damascus (Syria), while the southern part of Jordan was part of the Vilayet of Hejaz. What later became Mandatory Palestine was in late Ottoman times divided between the Vilayet of Beirut (Lebanon) and the Sanjak of Jerusalem. The Zionist Organization provided its definition of the boundaries of Palestine in a statement to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919.

The British administered Mandatory Palestine after World War I, having promised to establish a homeland for the Jewish people. The modern definition of the region follows the boundaries of that entity, which were fixed in the North and East in 1920–23 by the British Mandate for Palestine (including the Transjordan memorandum) and the Paulet–Newcombe Agreement, and on the South by following the 1906 Turco-Egyptian boundary agreement.
=== Current usage ===

The region of Palestine is the eponym for the Palestinian people and the culture of Palestine, both of which are defined as relating to the whole historical region, usually defined as the localities within the border of Mandatory Palestine. The 1968 Palestinian National Covenant described Palestine as the &quot;homeland of the Arab Palestinian people&quot;, with &quot;the boundaries it had during the British Mandate&quot;.

However, since the 1988 Palestinian Declaration of Independence, the term State of Palestine refers only to the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. This discrepancy was described by the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas as a negotiated concession in a September 2011 speech to the United Nations: &quot;... we agreed to establish the State of Palestine on only 22% of the territory of historical Palestine – on all the Palestinian Territory occupied by Israel in 1967.&quot;

The term &quot;Palestine&quot; is also sometimes used in a limited sense to refer to the parts of the Palestinian territories currently under the administrative control of the Palestinian National Authority, a quasi-governmental entity which governs parts of the State of Palestine under the terms of the Oslo Accords.

== Demographics ==
=== Early demographics ===

Estimating the population of Palestine in antiquity relies on two methods – censuses and writings made at the times, and the scientific method based on excavations and statistical methods that consider the number of settlements at the particular age, area of each settlement, density factor for each settlement.

The Bar Kokhba revolt in the 2nd century CE saw a major shift in the population of Palestine. The sheer scale and scope of the overall destruction has been described by Dio Cassius in his &quot;Roman History&quot;, where he notes that Roman war operations in the country had left some 580,000 Jews dead, with many more dying of hunger and disease, while 50 of their most important outposts and 985 of their most famous villages were razed to the ground. &quot;Thus,&quot; writes Dio Cassius, &quot;nearly the whole of Judaea was made desolate.&quot;

According to Israeli archaeologists Magen Broshi and Yigal Shiloh, the population of ancient Palestine did not exceed one million. By 300CE, Christianity had spread so significantly that Jews comprised only a quarter of the population.

=== Late Ottoman and British Mandate periods ===
In a study of Ottoman registers of the early Ottoman rule of Palestine, Bernard Lewis reports:[T]he first half century of Ottoman rule brought a sharp increase in population. The towns grew rapidly, villages became larger and more numerous, and there was an extensive development of agriculture, industry, and trade. The two last were certainly helped to no small extent by the influx of Spanish and other Western Jews.From the mass of detail in the registers, it is possible to extract something like a general picture of the economic life of the country in that period. Out of a total population of about 300,000 souls, between a fifth and a quarter lived in the six towns of Jerusalem, Gaza, Safed, Nablus, Ramle, and Hebron. The remainder consisted mainly of peasants, living in villages of varying size, and engaged in agriculture. Their main food-crops were wheat and barley in that order, supplemented by leguminous pulses, olives, fruit, and vegetables. In and around most of the towns there was a considerable number of vineyards, orchards, and vegetable gardens.
According to Alexander Scholch, the population of Palestine in 1850 was about 350,000 inhabitants, 30% of whom lived in 13 towns; roughly 85% were Muslims, 11% were Christians and 4% Jews.

According to Ottoman statistics studied by Justin McCarthy, the population of Palestine in the early 19th century was 350,000, in 1860 it was 411,000 and in 1900 about 600,000 of whom 94% were Arabs. In 1914 Palestine had a population of 657,000 Muslim Arabs, 81,000 Christian Arabs, and 59,000 Jews. McCarthy estimates the non-Jewish population of Palestine at 452,789 in 1882; 737,389 in 1914; 725,507 in 1922; 880,746 in 1931; and 1,339,763 in 1946.

In 1920, the League of Nations&#x27; &quot;Interim Report on the Civil Administration of Palestine&quot; described the 700,000 people living in Palestine as follows:

=== Current demographics ===

According to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, , the total population of Israel was 8.5million people, of which 75% were Jews, 21% Arabs, and 4% &quot;others&quot;. Of the Jewish group, 76% were Sabras (born in Israel); the rest were olim (immigrants)—16% from Europe, the former Soviet republics, and the Americas, and 8% from Asia and Africa, including the Arab countries.

According to the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics evaluations, in 2015 the Palestinian population of the West Bank was approximately 2.9million and that of the Gaza Strip was 1.8million. By 2022, the population of the Gaza strip had increased to an estimated 2,375,259, corresponding to a density of more than 6,507 people per square kilometre.

Both Israeli and Palestinian statistics include Arab residents of East Jerusalem in their reports. According to these estimates the total population in the region of Palestine, as defined as Israel and the Palestinian territories, stands approximately 12.8million.

=== Flora distribution ===

The World Geographical Scheme for Recording Plant Distributions is widely used in recording the distribution of plants. The scheme uses the code &quot;PAL&quot; to refer to the region of Palestine – a Level 3 area. The WGSRPD&#x27;s Palestine is further divided into Israel (PAL-IS), including the Palestinian territories, and Jordan (PAL-JO), so is larger than some other definitions of &quot;Palestine&quot;.

<text>Panda Security is a Spanish cybersecurity software company. Panda Security&#x27;s core offering is antivirus software and other cybersecurity software. This includes security products and services for both businesses and home users, as well as protection tools for systems, networks, emails, and other private information. As of August 2024, Panda Security reports over 600 employees.

==Overview==
In 2005, Panda Security was the fourth largest antivirus vendor worldwide, with 3.2% of the marketplace. In November 2015, OPSWAT measured Panda Security&#x27;s market share to be 3.6%. The company, whose shares were previously 100% held by Mikel Urizarbarrena, announced on April 24, 2007, the sale of 75% of its shares to the Southern European investment group Investindustrial and private equity firm Gala Capital. On 30 July 2007, the company changed its name from Panda Software to Panda Security and Urizarbarrena was replaced by Jorge Dinares. Almost one year later, on 3 June 2008, amidst flagging sales, the board of directors voted to replace Dinares with Juan Santana, the CEO. Santana resigned in September 2011 and was replaced by José Sancho as acting CEO. In February 2018, Juan Santamaría was appointed CEO of Panda Security after serving as General Manager.

The firm has subsidiaries in the US, Italy, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, France, the UK, Sweden, Finland, Spain, and Japan. Additionally, it has franchises in another 44 countries. The US subsidiary moved its headquarters to Orlando, Florida in 2009.

In late 2009, Panda Security created a partnership with Web of Trust to help fight the war on viruses.

Panda was previously embroiled in a lawsuit with one of its channel partners, External Technologies, Inc. In 2013, Panda prevailed in this lawsuit, recovering a judgment in excess of $100,000 and prevailing on all claims asserted by External against Panda. On 3 August 2010, a new office location in Menlo Park, California was publicly announced by Panda&#x27;s CEO via his Twitter account.

In 2012, the firm was the tenth largest antivirus vendor worldwide, with 2.0% of the marketplace.

In March 2020, the Seattle-based network security firm WatchGuard announced that they entered into an agreement to acquire Panda Security.

<doc id="1114737" wikidata="Q7181561" url="?curid=1114737" title="Phi Sigma Kappa">
<text>Phi Sigma Kappa (), colloquially known as Phi Sig or PSK, is a men&#x27;s social and academic fraternity with approximately 74 active chapters and provisional chapters in North America. Most of its first two dozen chapters were granted to schools in New England, New York, and Pennsylvania; therefore its early development was strongly Eastern in character, eventually operating chapters at six of the eight Ivy League schools as well as more egalitarian state schools. It later expanded to the South and West. The fraternity has initiated more than 180,000 members since 1873.

According to its Constitution, Phi Sigma Kappa is devoted to the promotion of its three Cardinal Principles: the &quot;Promotion of Brotherhood&quot;, the &quot;Stimulation of Scholarship&quot;, and the &quot;Development of Character&quot;.

Phi Sigma Kappa began on March 15, 1873, at Massachusetts Agricultural College in Amherst (now the University of Massachusetts Amherst) by six sophomores (referred to as The Founders). Phi Sigma Epsilon merged with Phi Sigma Kappa in 1985, which was the largest merger of Greek-letter fraternities.

==History==

===Founding===
Massachusetts Agricultural College in Amherst, now the University of Massachusetts Amherst, was the setting for the founding of Phi Sigma Kappa. Among its other students in the early 1870s, it had attracted six men of varied backgrounds, ages, abilities, and goals in life who saw the need for a new and different kind of society on campus. Early members recalled that it was Henry Hague who suggested that, since the six were close and were not interested in either of the two local fraternities on campus, they create their own. The six sophomores, meeting in Old North Hall, banded together during the summer of 1873 to form a &quot;society to promote morality, learning and social culture.&quot;

The six Founders of Phi Sigma Kappa were:
* Jabez William Clay
* Joseph Francis Barrett
* Henry Hague
* Xenos Young Clark
* Frederick George Campbell
* William Penn Brooks

The six were active college students, members of literary and academic societies and athletic groups, and editors of campus publications. Three were military lieutenants and Brooks was a captain. Hague and Brooks even ran the college store. Academic leaders as well, &quot;it cannot be too strongly stressed that these men were the best students in [the] college.&quot; On March 15, 1873, the Founders met in secret. Brooks already had prepared a constitution and symbolism, and Hague had designed a ritual. The first meeting seemed destined to succeed, for the individuals all had done their work well. The ritual has been changed only six times since, and never drastically. The symbolism and esoteric structure have never been altered. Clay was elected president of the group—which for its first five years had no name. Its cryptic characters could not be pronounced, either, though Brooks recalled that outsiders referred to them as &quot;T, double T, T upside-down.&quot;

===Grand Chapter===
The Grand Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa was organized in 1878, five years after the founding of &quot;Alpha chapter&quot;, to tie alumni and undergraduates into a continuing relationship. Charles Sumner Howe, an 1876 initiate, was elected its first Grand President (at the age of 20). Phi Sigma Kappa was adopted as the group&#x27;s official name that same year after four years of debate and the work of seven committees.

===Expansion===

Originally, only one chapter was contemplated by the founders. Although the germ of expansion arrived early, its period of gestation consumed 13 years. As early as 1875 an inquiry had been received from a group at Maine Agricultural College, and a few years later there was an unexpected letter from the University of New Mexico-but nothing came of either &quot;feeler.&quot; In 1878, John A. Cutter was inducted into the group, a man destined to have much to do with the preservation of the order&#x27;s early records and with its expansion beyond the confines of the Massachusetts campus. Graduating from &quot;Aggie&quot; he went on to attend Albany Medical College (which in 1873 had become a unit of Union College) and established a group that became &quot;Beta&quot; Chapter (1888). 

Cutter was also instrumental in the establishment of &quot;Gamma&quot; at Cornell (1889). The transition to a national order was accomplished. These same early years saw the pin (or badge) adopted essentially as it is today; an induction ritual, which embodied the concept of universal brotherhood and expanded the order&#x27;s horizons beyond Massachusetts, was written in 1890; the establishment of the fraternity&#x27;s magazine, &quot;The Signet,&quot; and the first chapter out of the Northeast came into being at West Virginia University (1891).

&quot;Bigness was never one of our ideas,&quot; Big Chief Barrett said in later years, admonishing a convention that was getting starry-eyed over dozens of new expansion possibilities. The principle has held; that though Phi Sigma Kappa stands high among national orders, size alone has never been a major consideration or goal.

 Phi Sig&#x27;s value to other campuses was as an organization offering something special and valuable to persons of varying backgrounds. Massachusetts Agricultural − &quot;Aggie&quot; − was more egalitarian, open to men of average means but high potential, and not filled with the class-conscious scions of Boston and New York society. In many ways, it has kept this ethic throughout its expansion. It never was simply another fraternity to be invited. Founder Brooks, four years before he died in 1938, put it this way: &quot;We believe that our fraternity exerts a powerful influence for good in national college life. The thought which lay in the minds of the Founders was good. May our brothers never forget that the foundation for a useful and satisfying life must be thought -- thought resulting in the visualization of a high ideal; and the determination to use all of one&#x27;s strength of body, mind, and soul for its realization.&quot;

During the final decade of the 19th century, careful expansion nevertheless led to solid chapters at Yale (Sachem Hall), Columbia, Maryland, Penn State and Penn, among other storied schools. Dartmouth, Brown, and MIT followed soon after. Eventually, Phi Sig was present at six of the eight Ivy League schools; even Canadian campuses were not excluded in the thinking of those who carried new chapters in all directions shortly after the turn of the century. &quot;Rho chapter&quot; was organized at Queen&#x27;s University at Kingston, Ontario, in 1903, and seventeen other units were added during the decade. Under Cutter&#x27;s and Barrett&#x27;s leadership, the national organization was strengthened, and work was begun among the alumni to support their continued interest in the fraternity after graduation. The Greek system&#x27;s uniqueness among American organizations is based partly on this principle – the idea of continued involvement for members after their undergraduate days. Phi Sigma Kappa was one of the early leaders in such efforts and remains one of the strongest alumni-oriented groups. If Founder Brooks&#x27; assessment of its purpose is true, then there would be no end to the fraternity&#x27;s influence on its members, and its role in their lives—another vital part of Phi Sig&#x27;s heritage.

Though the admonition against &quot;bigness for bigness&#x27; sake&quot; was always there, the demand to serve campuses wherever they might be was equally loud. In 1909, for example (after the Grand Council had earlier refused to put a chapter on the West Coast because of the distance involved and because it feared such a chapter would be denied the visits and services of a nearby headquarters), the fraternity spanned the continent. The Ridge Road Club of the University of California, Berkeley became &quot;Omega chapter&quot;—fittingly utilizing the last letter of the Greek alphabet and preparing the way for the first of the Deuteron or second-series units. This national aspect did not escape the notice of the mid-continent; within six months, petitions were received from Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa State. In all, fourteen new chapters were established in the first decade of the new century. Some who were there tell that the induction ceremonies at the early Deuteron units often included a reminder in the form of Founder Hague&#x27;s benediction on the night of March 15, 1873, words that still ring of idealism and true worth:

Let us ... keep on growing till our beloved fraternity shall become full grown ..., having the strength to help and protect its members, wisdom to guide them to helpful and good things as to college life, and love so warm that its members shall feel its kindly glow, that brotherly love may indeed be a reality and not an idea.

Phi Sigma Kappa became a founding member of the North American Interfraternity Conference, or NIC, in 1910.

To honor the Founders, on , members unveiled &quot;The Shrine&quot; on the wall of Old North College, the site of the first meetings of the fraternity. This memorial was moved to the entrance of Machmer Hall in when Old North was razed.

In the 1920s the fraternity continued to grow, especially into the land grant institutions, with establishment of chapters at Oregon State, Stanford, Tennessee, Alabama, Ohio State, Kentucky, Washington, Oregon, South Carolina and others, twenty-five in all.

===Great Depression===
Phi Sig did not escape the Great Depression; no fraternal order did. But like many of them, she came out of it wiser and stronger for the experience, filled with the knowledge that brotherhood based on a heritage of helpfulness and value cannot be submerged by a flood of economic hardship. 
Nationally, chapters of all fraternities existing at the start of the new century were wooed into increasingly expansive building projects in the boom years leading up to the Great Depression. The economic downturn became the great leveler; chapters that had extended themselves beyond their means were felled by sharply reduced revenues and growing debt. Within Phi Sig, closely tied as it was to its graduates, alumni were called in to support weakened balance sheets on buildings the undergraduate population alone could no longer afford. In one famous but probably not unique case, chapter advisor Sam Gale went door to door in 1931, successfully seeking alumni backing against the mortgage of Minnesota&#x27;s newly built Tudor masterpiece. Not only was this impulse acted on at the alumni level: The fraternity&#x27;s undergraduate delegates, moved by the plight of their brethren, had fathered a plan at the 1930 Convention that channeled 25 cents each month from each active member (about $12 per month, per man, in 2021 dollars) into a fund to assist chapters stricken by the Depression; the principle of mutual helpfulness could not have been better illustrated. Low manpower, too, had brought about fraternal belt-tightening where possible, while still investing in tactical, significant national services - training in rushing techniques, a pledge manual, better accounting systems, and visits by field representatives.

Chapter growth slowed, as the fraternity sought to shore up its existing chapters. However, in its sixth decade, Phi Sigma Kappa nevertheless established chapters at Purdue, American University, and Montana State.

Perhaps the most significant development of these years came out of the 1934 Convention in Ann Arbor. Brother Stewart W. Herman of Gettysburg wrote and presented the Phi Sigma Kappa &quot;Creed&quot;, and Brother Ralph Watts of Massachusetts drafted and presented the fraternity&#x27;s &quot;Cardinal Principles&quot;. More than half a century later they stand as Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s heritage personified, as much a part of the fraternity&#x27;s individuality as any of its more ancient rituals and symbolism.

===World War II===
The 1938 Convention adopted the six-degree membership structure to honor the six Founders, especially as a tribute to Founder Brooks, who had died only a few weeks earlier. The first professional manager of the fraternity was hired that same year, marking still another organizational response to growing needs in a critical period. The hardships of World War I and the Great Depression were scarcely overcome when World War II arrived. The extraordinary efforts by which the fraternity survived are another and longer story; the important fact is that Phi Sig did survive. The 1948 Convention in Boston marked the 75th anniversary of the founding. There were 52 active chapters; the Phi Sigma Kappa Foundation had been established, primarily to reward good scholarship among brothers; and &quot;The Signet&quot; was guaranteed to all members for life under a plan that had few parallels in the Greek world at that time. D. R. (Spec) Collins of Iowa, one of the fraternity&#x27;s most dynamic leaders of the post-World War II years, reaffirmed the heritage in more modern terms:&quot;The Founders very wisely developed the ritual and philosophy of the fraternity based on service to its members. The Cardinal Principles of Phi Sigma Kappa are the development of brotherhood, scholarship, and character ... There is nothing in our Cardinal Principles about prestige, the most beautiful house, the best social program, [being] &#x27;number one on campus&#x27; in intramurals, activities, etc. These are all frosting on the cake. A fraternity chapter that truly serves its purpose helps its members in their personal development. Thus I do not believe a chapter, that pledges students who are already top scholars and which wins a scholarship cup year-in and year-out, outperforms any distinctive service. That chapter which pledges average students, however, and encourages them to develop their academic capabilities to the utmost, deserves the scholarship cup. The same is true of character. If we pledge only the most polished and mature individuals, there is little left for the chapter to do for these people. The fraternity can and should take average college students and help them develop their character, and help them learn to live together in brotherhood.&quot;
&quot;My fraternity did something for me when I was in school. It helped me to learn to live with others and to develop my own personal, moral, and social attributes so that I could fit better into the society that I found when I left the University. The services of fraternity supplemented those of my family, my church, and my teachers. For this reason, I am willing to continue to work for my fraternity -- so long as my fraternity is working to serve its individual members.&quot;

The massive post-war influx of GIs to collegiate campuses brought with it a class of men of maturity, and literally, battle-tested experiences of fraternal bonding. For a time, a significant percentage of Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s active members were married. The fraternal magazine was expanded to celebrate marriages and births as a counterpoint to the solemn roster of Gold Stars - servicemen brothers who had been killed in action - or the lists of those still serving. &quot;The Signet&quot; carried popular interest stories about member wartime experiences, first-hand accounts by seasoned correspondents, and even geopolitical essays.

Demand led to aggressive growth and an expansion of chapters once again; Now, where so many members had served overseas or traveled extensively, awareness and interest in the doings of chapters in distant states became more apparent. Sporting heroes were celebrated. Lists of national collegiate football, basketball, and baseball &quot;All Phi Sig&quot; teams were published and scrutinized. Local programs grew quickly into national events. One example is Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s &quot;Moonlight Girl&quot;, a chapter sweetheart contest that rivaled the &quot;Sweetheart of Sigma Chi&quot; as the premier sweetheart pageant of the fraternity world. For a dozen years, &quot;The Signet&quot; printed photos of many of the winners of local chapter contests for a popular write-in election for the national Moonlight Girl. The winner would travel, with her escort, to the national convention, there to entertain the delegates with songs and conversation. This popular appearance would be underwritten by the fraternity and served to increase attendance. Moonlight Girl continues as a local tradition in a handful of chapters, including Minnesota. The popular &quot;Moonlight Girl&quot; song was heard around pianos at chapters across the nation:

:&quot;When we find a girl with golden hair,&quot;
:&quot;And eyes of shining blue,&quot;
:&quot;With lips so rare, and a skin so fair,&quot;
:&quot;And a heart that shall ever be true.&quot;
:&quot;Then we&#x27;ll love her and cherish her through the years,&quot;
:&quot;Singing this old refrain,&quot;
:&quot;She&#x27;s the beautiful sweetheart of old Phi Sig,&quot;
:&quot;In our hearts she will e&#x27;er remain.&quot;

The Phi Sigma Kappa Foundation (PSKF) was formed as a separate legal entity in 1947 to provide scholarships to undergraduates and program support. It has proven to be the financial backbone of the fraternity due to its support of member development and leadership programming and publications.

===Post World War II===
Following World War II the fraternity (along with other Greek organizations) faced issues related to segregation, hazing, and academics. During the 1950s, Phi Sigma Kappa removed racial restrictions on membership, worked with other NIC fraternities to eliminate hazing, and revised its membership education program to reflect such changes. During this time membership in Greek organizations declined significantly and some chapters were again lost.

====Civil rights====
Phi Sigma Kappa, like almost all fraternities and sororities, formed before the Civil Rights Movement, had previously not taken in minorities on any scale except for the occasional foreign student. At the 1952 Bedford Springs Convention some chapters, mainly outside of New England and the East, wanted an understanding that no chapter would pledge &quot;negroes,&quot; and offered legislation to this end called &quot;The Bedford Resolution.&quot; The Bedford Resolution read, &quot;That the fraternity&#x27;s tradition be maintained in the sense that there be no pledging or initiating of Negro men until they are acceptable to all chapters.&quot; The Bedford Resolution narrowly passed. Immediately after, Phi Sigma Kappa lost several chapters due to negative reactions to the resolution. The Alpha Triton Chapter at Wesleyan University disaffiliated itself rather than de-pledge a black student it had pledged in good faith, and reformed itself as a local, Gamma Psi. Chapters at Boston University, Hartwick College and Knox College were expelled from the Grand Chapter in 1953-55 for each pledging an African-American student, reverting to their former local status. Tau chapter at Dartmouth College disaffiliated from Phi Sigma Kappa, citing &quot;racist membership policies&quot; of the fraternity as its motivation. Tau became a local fraternity, and eventually the co-ed organization of Phi Tau, in May 1956. Of the chapters that left during the debate, only Tau still operates.

In a letter dated June 28, 1954, D.R. &quot;Spec&quot; Collins, the then-president of Phi Sigma Kappa, announced that from his point of view, &quot;the entire fraternity system is truly an American institution engaged in the service of building good American citizens–is being challenged. Challenged by those subversive elements who, by encouraging us to quarrel among ourselves may cause us to destroy ourselves. The &#x27;divide and conquer strategy&#x27; that might well eliminate a great American institution.&quot; President Collins warned that the anti-discrimination issue would be raised at the next Phi Sigma Kappa convention. The Bedford Resolution was a policy and was more easily changed than a constitutional measure or bylaw. Two years after its passage, at the 1954 Convention the Bedford Resolution was repealed in favor of a non-legislative &quot;Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement&quot; to ban non-whites. This much weaker, short-lived, informal agreement also encouraged local chapters not to admit minorities to membership.

Two years later, at the 1956 Convention, the Gentlemen&#x27;s Agreement was also dropped leaving no race restrictions. Immediately following the 1956 Convention, &quot;Phi chapter&quot; at Swarthmore, in Pennsylvania, pledged a black man from the Gold Coast. The Grand President simply took the stance that he would not suspend the chapter, since neither the Bedford Resolution nor any other agreement was in place. At the 1958 convention, there was little discussion of the matter.

In 2009 some delegates to that year&#x27;s convention felt that a definitive statement on the issue of discrimination should be incorporated into the constitution itself. Phi Sigma Kappa amended its constitution to include the following nondiscrimination clause, largely intended as a formality:

&quot;No chapter shall discriminate in recruitment or membership based on race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, ethnic background, sexual orientation, veteran status, marital status, parental status, or political affiliation.&quot;

===Merger===

Phi Sigma Kappa first discussed mergers at the onset of World War II when most fraternities were in danger of falling apart as students went to war. The issue was not discussed seriously again on a national level for decades.

In 1980, a Phi Sigma Kappa Council meeting included the subject of mergers on its agenda. The outcome of the discussion was the conclusion that Phi Sigma Kappa would only participate in a merger if it was the continuing fraternity: Phi Sigma Kappa was open to absorbing a smaller fraternity.

In 1984, a chapter of Phi Sigma Epsilon placed a call to the national headquarters of Phi Sigma Kappa to discuss the fact that several Phi Sigma Epsilon chapters were unhappy with the services of their national organization and that they were interested in Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s expansion efforts. These chapters were considering a change in national affiliation which is not possible under the rules of the NIC. A call was made between the presidents of both national organizations but a merger was not explored.

Later on in the fall of 1984, the two fraternities were placed next to each other at a table during the NIC conference. Discussions commenced and the members at the conference discovered that they had more in common than the first two letters of their respective fraternity&#x27;s names. Phi Sigma Epsilon&#x27;s beliefs in justice, wisdom, and honor closely paralleled Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s cardinal principles of brotherhood, scholarship, and character. Phi Sigma Epsilon was in the midst of difficult administrative and financial circumstances and most chapters were in the interior of the contiguous United States. Phi Sigma Kappa, although relatively strong both administratively and financially, was concentrated on the east and west coasts of the country. It was found that both organizations had similar rituals upon the report of a brother of Phi Sigma Epsilon who had become an adviser of a Phi Sigma Kappa chapter. That chapter had allowed the faculty adviser to view the rituals of Phi Sigma Kappa. This was an error on the part of the Phi Sigma Kappa chapter but it allowed the two national organizations to otherwise resolve the awkward question of how similar their secrets were.

Chapter questionnaires, meetings, and communications regarding a merger would occupy both fraternities over several months. Phi Sigma Epsilon narrowly voted in favor of the merger in June 1985. Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s convention was not until August but initial responses were overwhelmingly positive.

On August 14, 1985, the merger was approved and formalized. In a stroke of good fortune for the two national bodies, there was only one school, Cornell University, which had active chapters of both fraternities. Younger, and smaller, the Phi Sigma Epsilon chapter was released to affiliate with another national fraternity.

Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s Court of Honor was expanded to include all past presidents of Phi Sigma Epsilon. Shannon Flowers of PSE agreed to serve as the new Recorder for that entity. The Grand Council was expanded to include PSE&#x27;s past president James Whitfield and former vice president Larry Beck. The Ritual of Association was rewritten to include significant portions of the Phi Sigma Epsilon ritual, and the PSE ritual itself was cast into the form of a special lecture to be added to the ritual book of all chapters for use on particular occasions. The co-author of Phi Sigma Epsilon&#x27;s ritual, Fred Schwengel, a strong supporter of the Merger, assisted in the incorporation of the two rituals.

At the Convention in 1987 in Long Beach, California, two years following the merger, the crest, Associate Member (pledge) pin, and flag were changed to incorporate the symbolism of Phi Sigma Epsilon.

Alumni of PSE chapters that merged into Phi Sigma Kappa are accorded the same rank or honors as they held in PSE. The PSE badge is honored as equivalent to a PSK badge for those alumni who choose to wear it. Where Phi Sigma Kappa HQ has accurate mailing addresses, they also receive fraternity mailings and chapter news.

====Dissension====
Almost all Phi Sigma Epsilon chapters and all Phi Sigma Kappa chapters participated in the merger, which was noted as the largest and most successful collegiate fraternal merger ever.

Leaders of both fraternities made great attempts to be sensitive to the pain of change and emotions of loss that any such merger would naturally entail. There were pockets of dissent, and not all chapters nor all alumni of Phi Sigma Epsilon participated. Soon after the merger, the former PSE chapter at Cornell was released to join another national; its building was sold to Alpha Chi Omega sorority. Other PSE chapters were found to be non-viable or had simply evaporated in the few years since a PSE officer had last visited or corresponded. These were formally closed. Eventually, following several disaffected alumni leaders of Phi Sigma Epsilon, seven PSE groups would go on to form Phi Sigma Phi in 1988.
Today, both fraternities seek to focus on their futures and maintain a posture of civility and cooperation on those occasions where they cross paths. Considering their shared history and the economic difficulties of supporting full-time operations with a small base of chapter revenue, Phi Sigma Kappa has consistently maintained it would welcome future inquiries toward cooperation from Phi Sigma Phi and her chapters, as a homecoming.

Phi Sigma Kappa continues to teach new members its enlarged historical record, marking milestones of both original fraternities.

===Present===
More recently, expansion efforts have been increased, and now somewhat outpace chapter closures, bringing in schools where Phi Sigma Kappa has not had a historical presence, as well as revitalizing troubled groups or dormant groups. This period of expansion has been entwined with an assertive effort to ensure the many surviving former Phi Sigma Epsilon chapters were fully integrated into the larger fraternity, and fully served. Several have had to be re-established, an effort that continues today. Aggressive risk management training has allowed Phi Sig to avoid, for the most part, headline-making news about hazing incidents. Key expansion targets and the return to long-established campuses where chapters have been lost have been another focus. While the fraternity has not lost sight of the attitude of its Founders to not seek bigness for its own sake, Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s Grand Council affirmed a desire for purposeful expansion in the 1980s and 90s which has enhanced its ability to provide the programs and services expected of a strong international fraternity.

Since the merger, Phi Sigma Kappa has grown at a rate of at least two chapters per year.

On many campuses, the provision of suitable housing remains the biggest challenge for a new provisional chapter. Phi Sigma Kappa Properties (PSKP), a separate legal entity, was created in 2002 to address this issue in areas of management, finding and funding buildings, dissemination of best practices for alumni holding companies, and building improvements for Phi Sig chapters nationwide.

== Symbols ==
The fraternity&#x27;s motto is &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot; Its Cardinal Principles or pillars are To Promote Brotherhood, To Stimulate Scholarship, To Develop Character. Its symbol is the Triple T, as seen on the signet ring to the right.

The fraternity&#x27;s colors are Cardinal red and silver. Its mascot is the owl. The original flower of Phi Sigma Kappa was the red carnation. After the merger, in 1987 the fraternity adopted a second official flower, the White Tea Rose, which had been honored by Phi Sigma Epsilon. Phi Sigma Kappa now recognizes both flowers with equal deference.

Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s publication is &quot;The Signet&quot;.

=== Badge ===
The official pin consists of the three Greek letters (&#x27;). The letter &#x27; may be plain gold or crown set with fifteen whole pearls and is superimposed upon a rose engraved and rose finished chased gold &#x27; to the left and &#x27; to the right. As a mark of distinction, council members may wear a ruby instead of a pearl as the center jewel, and national presidents are presented with a badge set with diamonds instead of pearls, and with a ruby as the center jewel. Appointive officers may wear an emerald instead of a pearl as their center jewel. The pledge pin used to be a red button approximately 3/8 inch in diameter. That pin was surrounded by a silver band in which the original Three T characters of the society were inset in silver. After the adoption of the merger symbolism in 1987, the circle and Triple T&#x27;s characters were circumscribed by a slightly larger triangle of silver. Phi Sigma Kappa continues to recognize the Phi Sigma Epsilon badge for those brothers who received it before the merger of the two fraternities.

=== Flag ===
The official flag had been seven by five feet in dimension, but in 2021 those specific dimensions were relaxed to allow flags of other sizes. The description of the flag remains consistent: three horizontal bars of equal height. The bottom bar is red and symbolizes First and Second Degree members, the foundation of the fraternity. The middle bar is silver for Third and Fourth Degree members, indicative of the field of fraternal service. The Greek letters are located in the center of this bar. The top bar, also red, commemorates Fifth and Sixth Degree members, indicative of Grand Chapter recognition. The silver and red Tumbling T&#x27;s logo inscribed in a triangle of silver is located at the left end of the upper bar.

This flag was adopted at the 1987 Convention, before this, Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s flag bore the Triple T&#x27;s set alone in a round border, without the triangle, and used the old colors of silver and magenta in an otherwise identical layout. It was at the 1987 Convention in Long Beach, CA that a special &quot;merger committee&quot; gave its recommendations including the new flag design, updated colors of Cardinal Red and Silver, revised wording of the Cardinal Principles paragraphs, various changes to the esoteric Ritual, the updated crest design and updated pledge pin design. The committee&#x27;s report was adopted by a wide margin, with acclaim, as ATPS notes &quot;continuing the spirit of the [merger] convention.&quot;

== Chapters ==

Interest groups form provisional chapters, which in turn become chapters by earning a Phi Sigma Kappa charter from the international headquarters. A charter is a document that conveys from a governing body permission for a local group to operate as a chapter. A PSK charter also signifies the date and location of the new chapter and lists its founding members. In the event of a re-colonization, a new group may still refer to the original charter date when citing the age of their chapter, even in a re-colonization.

Chapters are individually designated by a chapter name. The original 24 chapters are called, in order, &quot;Alpha&quot;, &quot;Beta&quot;, &quot;Gamma&quot;, etc., thru to &quot;Omega&quot;. Following this, the &quot;Deuteron&quot; series began with &quot;Alpha Deuteron&quot;, then &quot;Beta Deuteron&quot;, &quot;Gamma Deuteron&quot;, and continuing through to &quot;Omega Deuteron&quot;. As of 2010, eight naming series have been established. Several other fraternities and sororities use a similar naming system. The Greek-based designations used by Phi Sigma Kappa include:

:Original Series, &quot;Alpha&quot; through &quot;Omega&quot;
:Deuteron Series, or second series, beginning with &quot;Alpha Deuteron&quot;
:Triton Series, or third series
:Tetarton Series, or fourth series
:Pentaton Series, or fifth series
:Hexaton Series, or sixth series
:Septaton Series, or seventh series
:Octaton Series, or eighth series

Phi Sigma Epsilon brought its naming system to the fraternity. Concerning the sensitivity of the merger in general, it was quickly decided that incoming PSE chapters could with pride maintain either their original chapter names or a chapter name that evoked their source in PSE. These naming series are:

:Epsilon Series, original oldest 24 PSE chapters
:Phi Series, second PSE series
:Sigma Series, third PSE series

Additionally, the three founding chapters of Phi Sigma Epsilon were honored by reversing in their names the letters &quot;Epsilon Alpha&quot; into &quot;Alpha Epsilon&quot;, &quot;Epsilon Beta&quot; into &quot;Beta Epsilon&quot;, and &quot;Epsilon Gamma&quot; into &quot;Gamma Epsilon&quot;, signifying their role in the formation of Phi Sigma Epsilon. The fourth oldest PSE chapter is &quot;Epsilon Delta&quot;, with the naming convention remaining more or less consistent, depending on the age of the chapter, and with some exceptions to match most closely the original names of those chapters.

Chapter lists are rendered in order of the original date of chapter founding.

Re-establishment where both groups existed but where they both are dormant usually takes on the name of the older dormant chapter, although some exceptions have been made if the alumni base has a clear preference.

New chapters where there has been neither a PSK nor PSE chapter will continue the Octaton series, or further series, as needed.

==Chapter houses==
Following are images of many of the Phi Sigma Kappa chapter houses. Many of the buildings in the historical photos are still owned by fraternity chapters and their alumni today, having been remodeled and expanded, while others have been replaced. 
==Organization and legal status==
Phi Sigma Kappa is divided into three distinct entities: Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity, Phi Sigma Kappa Foundation, and Phi Sigma Kappa Properties. The Phi Sigma Kappa International Headquarters is staffed by administrators who handle many of the day-to-day operations in the fraternity as well as coordinate and plan many events, meetings, and other programs held by the Grand Chapter and the Foundation.

===Phi Sigma Kappa fraternity===
Management of the fraternity (PSK) on a day-to-day basis is vested in the executive director, Joe Kern. He and twelve full-time staff members support all aspects of chapter operations, expansion, alumni relations, program development, risk management, and event coordination. Phi Sigma Kappa&#x27;s Grand Council operates as its volunteer board of directors, composed of one grand president and six directors who guide the fraternity&#x27;s future and ensure the implementation of its policies.

Regional Advisers are liaisons between the fraternity&#x27;s national officers and undergraduates.

Local Chapter Advisors often serve as another key point of contact between Regional and National staff or volunteers, to the local chapter.

Some individual Phi Sigma Kappa chapters may work with local alumni- or parent-led housing corporations of their own to manage chapter housing or may work with Phi Sigma Kappa Properties to achieve this same purpose. Local chapter house corporations are separate legal entities from the national structure.

===Phi Sigma Kappa Foundation===
The Foundation (PSKF), incorporated as an entity separate from the Grand Chapter in 1947, serves as the financial backbone of the fraternity. It is facilitated by a board of trustees which appropriates funds for various programs and scholarships administered by the Grand Council. The money for this comes from member dues, pledges, and donations. The Foundation is immensely important to the growth and maintenance of the fraternity. Some of the programs it funds are the Leadership School, Undergraduate Scholarships, the Grand Chapter website, and Regional Conclaves.

===Phi Sigma Kappa Properties===
Phi Sigma Kappa Properties (PSKP) is the newest of the three Phi Sigma Kappa entities but plans to become a full-service real estate management and development corporation. PSKP held a long-range planning meeting in August 2005, which was facilitated by Grand Council Director Tim Vojtasko. The organization developed a set of five long-range goals for the next five years and beyond. Those goals include:
* To become the largest (assets owned and managed) property management organization in the fraternity world
* To double the number of houses owned by a PSK-related entity; also 40 houses (owned and managed) in 5 years
* To hire an executive director/CFO with a complete staff of 5 within 5 years
* To develop a world-class model for owning, managing, and financing fraternity properties
* To be able to offer all PSK-related properties the opportunity to be owned and/or managed by PSKP

== Membership ==
Membership in Phi Sigma Kappa is available to male students attending a college, university, technical institute, or community college with a Phi Sigma Kappa chapter, provided the man is not a member of a nationally recognized social collegiate fraternity. This opportunity extends not only to undergraduates but also to faculty, graduate students, and former students. Membership is also possible at a chapter elsewhere than the man&#x27;s place of higher education if his school lacks a chapter. Additionally, honorary membership is provided for in the Constitution and Bylaws of the Grand Chapter of Phi Sigma Kappa. Specific requirements for membership may vary between places of higher education and chapters but minimum requirements are nationally legislated. Membership in Phi Sigma Kappa can be dissolved only by death or expulsion.

===Degrees of membership===
* First Degree: members of undergraduate chapters
* Second Degree: members elected to symbolic offices
* Third Degree: alumni and those initiated as graduates, former students, faculty, or honorary members
* Fourth Degree: members appointed to an office by the Grand Council or Grand President, past or present
* Fifth Degree: members elected to the Grand Council, past or present
* Sixth Degree: members who have been elected Grand President, past or present

<doc id="1114743" wikidata="Q5054899" url="?curid=1114743" title="Cave Creek disaster">
<text>The Cave Creek disaster occurred on 28 April 1995 when a scenic viewing platform in Paparoa National Park, New Zealand, collapsed, resulting in the deaths of 14 people. The victims, 13 of whom were Tai Poutini Polytechnic students, fell onto rocks below. The tragedy resulted in wide criticism of the government and its policies towards funding and management of the conservation estate. Denis Marshall, New Zealand&#x27;s Minister of Conservation, eventually resigned, after the Commission of Inquiry&#x27;s report came out. It also resulted in major changes to procedures used by the New Zealand Department of Conservation, after it was revealed that serious systemic failures had led to the building of the unstable platform. Eventual changes in New Zealand law, following a change of government, allowed for government departments to be held criminally liable for inadequate building practices, in the same way as the non-government organisations.

== Background ==
Cave Creek / Kotihotiho is a small stream in Paparoa National Park. A viewing platform was erected by the Department of Conservation (DOC) in April 1994, looking out over a 40-metre chasm with a view of the resurgence, where the creek emerges from a cave system below.

The builders of the platform did not have appropriate qualifications for the job. Twelve major problems or oversights occurred during the platform&#x27;s construction (see below), including nails being used to connect the bearers to the piles instead of bolts as no drill was brought to the site. The platform was highly unsafe, especially with large numbers of people on it.

== Platform collapse ==
On the day of the incident, a group of students from Tai Poutini Polytechnic in Greymouth visited the park. En route through the bush, a small group consisting of the polytechnic tutor, a Department of Conservation (DOC) officer and three students split off while the larger group of 17 students and another DOC officer continued towards the platform.

The larger group reached the platform first, and walked to the edge together at about 11:25 a.m. Several students started shaking the platform and it toppled forward into the chasm. The DOC officer and 13 of the students were killed. Four students survived the collapse with serious injuries.

The second group reached the location shortly after the collapse. Having realised what happened, the remaining DOC officer and one of the students ran back to the start of the track for help, but on arriving they found that the keys were not in the group&#x27;s vehicles. At this point, the DOC officer returned to the scene of the accident while the student ran along the road with a note containing information about the location of the accident. By 12:15 p.m., he had managed to phone the police at Greymouth.

The remoteness of the site made it difficult for medical services to assist the survivors. The first person to reach the scene was a Greymouth police constable, who arrived on foot two hours after the accident. Ambulances from Greymouth and Westport arrived initially, later followed by RNZAF Bell UH-1H and BK-117 Rescue helicopters from Christchurch.

== Commission of Inquiry ==
A Commission of Inquiry into the accident, headed by District Judge Graeme Noble, highlighted a number of serious concerns with the Department of Conservation&#x27;s construction of the platform. Specific concerns that were raised included:

* The platform had not been designed or approved by a qualified engineer.
* None of the people involved in building the platform were qualified engineers.
* Nails were used to secure the platform instead of bolts (as intended by the design), because an appropriate drill had not been taken to the building site.
* The steps to the platform, which were supposed to be attached as a counterweight, had not been properly attached.
* A Building Consent had never been obtained for the platform. By the time this was realised, the plans had been lost and replacement (and incorrect) schematics were hastily drawn by an unqualified volunteer exchange student so as to lodge a retrospective application. Further confusion about the Building Act then resulted in the consent never being lodged.
* The platform was not listed in any register that would have resulted in regular inspections.
* A warning sign for the platform, suggesting a maximum limit of five people, had been ordered but was never installed at the site.

Besides the specific flaws in the actual platform and methods of its construction, the Commission said the &quot;root causes&quot; of the collapse were systemic problems in the department as a whole, noting that the department was seriously under-funded and under-resourced. The Commission found that the department had not been given sufficient resources to meet its requirements without &quot;cutting corners&quot;, and was frequently forced to accept poor quality standards due to its lack of funding. The report of the Commission concluded that given the department&#x27;s state, &quot;a tragedy such as Cave Creek was almost bound to happen&quot;.

Ten years after the accident, survivor Stacy Mitchell said that he and some other students were shaking the platform hard when it collapsed, which he had not reported at the time through fear of being blamed. Evidence at the inquiry indicated that the platform should have been designed and built to tolerate use that could reasonably be expected.

== Repercussions ==

Soon after the accident, the Department of Conservation inspected more than 520 structures, and 65 were closed for repairs. The review led to the removal of a large number of structures on public land, and many safety notices appeared on the remainder around New Zealand. Indeed, some felt the response was excessive, for example in cases where bridges and platforms were labelled with signs such as &quot;1 person maximum&quot;.

Although DOC took responsibility for the accident, there were no prosecutions as New Zealand law at the time did not permit the Crown to prosecute itself. $2.6 million was still paid to the victims&#x27; families, however. Since the accident, New Zealand law has been adjusted to ensure that the Building Act covers government departments, and to allow government departments to be held liable for such negligence in future.

Prime Minister Jim Bolger initially attacked the report produced by the Commission of Inquiry, arguing that the platform failed &quot;essentially because it lacked about $20 worth of bolts to hold it together&quot;. The Minister of Conservation, Denis Marshall, was criticised in the media for his management of the department. Many people blamed Marshall, although there was also wide criticism of the whole government&#x27;s policies on management of the conservation estate. Marshall eventually resigned in May 1996, just over a year after the accident occurred. A new Minister, Nick Smith, was appointed, and a full review of the department was conducted by the State Services Commission.

A memorial plaque was unveiled in April 1996. In 1998 the track re-opened to the public, new stairs replaced the old ones, but the viewing platform was not rebuilt. The platform space has a fence around it and warning signs.

In 1996 New Zealand composer John Dylan wrote an orchestral piece, &quot;Cave Creek 95 - An Elegy&quot; in recognition of the event.

The section of track to Cave Creek from the intersection with the Inland Pack Track was renamed the Cave Creek Memorial Track/Kotihotiho in 2020, as part of the 25 year remembrance of the disaster. There is a memorial on the side of the track to those who died.

<doc id="1114749" wikidata="Q2542281" url="?curid=1114749" title="Constitution of Cuba">
<text>Even before attaining its independence from Spain, Cuba had several constitutions either proposed or adopted by insurgents as governing documents for territory they controlled during their war against Spain. Cuba has had several constitutions since winning its independence. The first constitution since the Cuban Revolution was drafted in 1976 and has since been amended. In 2018, Cuba became engaged in a major revision of its constitution. The current constitution was then enacted in 2019.

== Early models ==
Events in early 19th-century Spain prompted a general concern with constitutions throughout Spain&#x27;s overseas possessions. In 1808, both Ferdinand VII of Spain and his predecessor and father, Charles IV of Spain, resigned their claims to the throne in favor of Napoleon Bonaparte, who in turn passed the crown to his brother Joseph Bonaparte. In the ensuing Peninsular War, the Spanish waged a war of independence against the French Empire. On 19 March 1812, the Cortes Generales in refuge in Cádiz adopted the Spanish Constitution of 1812, which established a constitutional monarchy and eliminated many basic institutions that privileged some groups over others. The Cortes included representatives from throughout the Spanish Empire, including Cuba.

Several models of constitutional government were proposed for Cuba. offered &quot;a charter for Cuban autonomy under Spanish rule&quot; in &quot;Diario de la Habana&quot; in 1810, elaborated as the &quot;Project for an Autonomous Government in Cuba&quot; in 1811. The next year, Bayamo attorney Joaquín Infante living in Caracas wrote his &quot;Constitutional Project for the Island of Cuba&quot;. He reconciled his liberal political principles with slavery in Cuba, noting that slavery existed in the United States alongside republican government. Spanish authorities imprisoned him for his writings. In 1821, Félix Varela represented Cuba in the Cortes Generales of Spain during a short period when the Constitution of 1812 was revived. He joined in a petition to the Crown for the independence of Spain&#x27;s Latin American colonies, supported by his &quot;Project of Instruction for the Politically and Economically Autonomous Government of the Overseas Provinces&quot;.

== Guáimaro Constitution ==

The Guáimaro Constitution was the governing document written by the idealistic and politically liberal faction in the insurgency that contested Spanish colonial rule in Cuba and imposed on Carlos Manuel de Céspedes, the conservative who claimed leadership of the independence movement. It was nominally in effect from 1869 to 1878 during the Ten Years&#x27; War against Spain.

== Jimaguayú Constitution ==
Two ad hoc constitutions were adopted in the course of Cuba&#x27;s last fight for independence from Spain (1895–1898). On 16 September 1895, delegates representing the rebel forces adopted a constitution in Jimaguayú, the Constitution of the Republic of Cuba in Arms, and set it to be reviewed in two years by a representative assembly. It described relations between civil and military authority. It named key officials and outlined the requirements of a peace treaty with Spain. In September 1897, the assembly met in , adopted a new document on 30 October, and named a new president and vice-president.

== La Yaya Constitution ==
La Yaya Constitution written in 1897 was the last constitution before the defeat of the Spanish. The principal notable passages of this constitution on equal civil rights, the right of suffrage and the rights governing equal education for all Cubans were written by General José Braulio Alemán Urquía. This constitution was used as template for the 1901 Constitution.

== 1901 Constitution ==

The 1901 Constitution, was Cuba&#x27;s first as an independent state. It incorporated eight principles set out in the Platt Amendment without which United States troops would not have been withdrawn from Cuba, including the clause that the U.S. has the right to intervene in Cuba&#x27;s affairs to protect its independence and guarantee the stability of its government. All but one of the Platt Amendment principles remained in force until a treaty between Cuba and the U.S., the Cuban–American Treaty of Relations (1934), negotiated as part of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s Good Neighbor policy toward Latin America, took effect on 9 June 1934, leaving the U.S. only its right to a permanent lease to its Guantanamo Naval Station.

== 1940 Constitution ==

During the presidency of Federico Laredo Brú, a Constitutional Assembly was elected in November 1939 to write a new constitution. The Assembly debated publicly for six months and adopted the constitution at the Capitol in Havana. It was signed by the delegates on 1 July 1940, and took effect on 10 October 1940. It provided for land reform, public education, universal healthcare, minimum wage, and other progressive ideas. The constitution abolished capital punishment and established as national policy restrictions on the size of land holdings and an end to common ownership of sugar plantations and sugar mills, but these principles were never translated into legislation. The constitution ordained a presidency and a bicameral congress, both with a four-year tenure, with a ban on direct re-elections to the office of president (though non-consecutive re-election would be tolerated; similar to the current constitution of Chile) with executive power shared with a new, separate office of Prime Minister of Cuba, to be nominated by the president. Fulgencio Batista suspended parts of this constitution after seizing power in 1952. It was completely suspended after the Cuban revolution.

== 1976 Constitution ==
After 16 years of non-constitutional government from 1959 to 1975, the revolutionary government of Cuba sought to institutionalize the revolution by putting a new constitution to a popular vote. The Constitution of 1976, modeled after the 1936 Soviet Constitution, was adopted by referendum on 15 February 1976, in which it was approved by 99.02% of voters, in a 98% turnout. It took effect on 24 February 1976. This constitution called for a centralized control of the market and re-committed the state to providing its citizens with access to free education and health care, as in the 1940 constitution. Article 53 gave citizens freedom of speech, and Article 54 gave citizens the right to assemble.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc plunged Cuba into an era of economic crisis known as the Special Period in Time of Peace. In response, the constitution was amended in 1992 to remove certain limitations on foreign investment and grant foreign corporations a limited right to own property on the island if they established joint ventures with the government. Another amendment established that Cuba is a secular state rather than an atheist state, prompting an expansion of local participation in religious observance, increased social service work on the part of sectarian international charities, and public recognition of religious pluralism. In 2002, the constitution was amended to stipulate that the socialistic system was permanent and irrevocable.

== 2019 Constitution ==

On 14 July 2018, a Cuban Communist Party task force drafted a new constitutional text, then given to a National Assembly commission headed by Party First Secretary Raúl Castro to assess, refine, and forward the new draft constitution to the National Assembly plenary. The reforms were seen as part of the attempt to modernize the Cuban government. The draft contained 87 new articles, increasing the total from 137 to 229. Among the reforms were the following:
* The recognition of private property under heavy regulation.
* The restoration of the positions of President and Prime Minister of Cuba as posts separate from President of the Council of State and of Ministers.
* The transfer of head of Council of State to the President of the National Assembly.
* The position of mayor being added to that of president of a municipal assembly.
* The creation of a requirement for presidential-appointed Provincial Governors and Lieutenant Governors to be ratified by local municipal governments.
* The acknowledgement of climate change and its threat.
* The establishment of provincial councils made up of municipal leaders.
* The creation of a two consecutive five-year term limit imposed on the president.
* Defining marriage as &quot;a social and legal institution&quot; and &quot;one form of family organization&quot; (formerly included legalization of same-sex marriage).
* Extending the terms of municipal council delegates to five years.
* Banning discrimination based on gender, race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability.
* The restoration of a presumption of innocence in the justice system, last provided for in the 1940 constitution.

The new constitution was presented to the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power by secretary of the Council of State Homero Acosta for approval on 21 July 2018 before being slated to a national referendum. The National Assembly then approved the new constitution on 22 July 2018, a day ahead of schedule. It was announced that a popular consultation which allows citizen input for potential amendments to the text of the proposed constitution would start on 13 August and conclude on 15 November.

It was announced that 135,000 meetings would be held during the popular consultation. Each of these would be run by 7,600 two-person teams who would receive specialized training. Cuban exiles were invited to take part in the meetings. Following consideration of amendments, a referendum was held to pass the Constitution on 24 February 2019, succeeding with 86.85% of the popular vote. The popular consultation began as scheduled on 13 August 2018, in tandem with the 92nd birthday of the late Cuban President Fidel Castro. The popular consultation concluded as scheduled on 15 November 2018. On 1 December 2018, Granma Newspaper reported that the Cuban Parliament would be summoned to vote on proposed amendments to the new Constitution on 21 December.

The new constitution was debated at the 8th Plenum of the Communist Party of Cuba&#x27;s Central Committee which took place between 12 and 13 December 2018. At the meeting, the amended draft of the proposed constitution was drawn up by a group commissioned by the National Assembly of People&#x27;s Power. However, details of what was amended would not be made public until it was approved by the National Assembly. On 18 December 2018, it was revealed that one of the changes to the new constitution which would have paved the way for same sex marriage was dropped. On 20 December 2018, another change to the new Cuban Constitution was dropped and its language once again reinserts direction to building a communist society. On 21 December 2018, the Cuba National Assembly approved the amended constitution, completing the final step for a referendum. On 24 February 2019, the new constitution was approved by 90.15% of voters, with a turnout of 84%. On 7 March, it was announced that the National Assembly would meet 10 April 2019 to determine the timeframe of when the new constitution would go into effect. On 28 March, it was announced the Council of State had held a meeting on 25 March and decided that the new constitution would be proclaimed by the National Assembly on 10 April. Upon being proclaimed, the new constitution would be adopted.

The new constitution was proclaimed as scheduled on 10 April 2019. After being proclaimed, the Constitution of Cuba was published in the &quot;Official Gazette of the Republic&quot;, ensuring its entry into force. It was also announced that new laws enforcing the constitutional reform of the judicial system must be enacted within 18 months. This includes, among other things, the enactment of presumption of innocence in criminal cases and introduction of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. An electoral law which would enforce the change in the structure of government in Cuba also must be enacted within six months. Within the following three months, the National Assembly would elect a president of the country, who must then appoint provincial governors and a prime minister, a new post separating the role of head of state from the role of head of government.

<text>Simon Hunt, sometimes known as Pauline Pantsdown (born c. 1962), is an Australian satirist and Australian Senate candidate who parodied Pauline Hanson, a controversial member of federal parliament, in 1997 and 2016.
His birth name was Simon Hunt, but he legally changed his name through Births, Deaths &amp; Marriages so that he would appear on the electoral ballot as &quot;Pauline Pantsdown&quot;; he later changed back to &quot;Simon Hunt&quot;. He is the son of the late David Hunt, who was a Chief Judge at Common Law of the Supreme Court of New South Wales.

As Pantsdown, he is a drag queen whose taste in fashion parodies Hanson&#x27;s, and is best known for the songs &quot;Backdoor Man&quot; and &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like It&quot;. The song &quot;Backdoor Man&quot; was a huge hit on the youth radio network Triple J after its release in 1997, being played almost hourly due to a massive number of requests, making it into the 1997 &quot;Hottest 100&quot; list at number 5. However, less than a week after its release, Hanson obtained a court injunction against the song, claiming it was defamatory. In September 2004, after Hanson launched a campaign for the Australian Senate, the ABC was reported to be planning a challenge to the injunction. However, after public criticism from Hanson, the ABC backed down.

==Early life and activism==
Born in Sydney, Hunt began playing in bands when he was 12 years old.

Hunt became influenced by arts-activism work around the world as a young adult, particularly the group ACT UP.

Prior to parodying Hanson, Hunt had successfully lobbied the Office of Film and Literature Classification to remove homosexuality from its list of &quot;adult themes&quot;, and produced a parody track collage of Fred Nile&#x27;s voice. As a gay man, Hunt reflected that homosexuality was not legalized in New South Wales until he was 22; until that point, the prison sentence for consensual homosexual sex was longer than it was for heterosexual rape.

As of 2016, Hunt is a head lecturer at the University of New South Wales.

==Homebake appearance==
The resulting controversy resulted in Pauline Pantsdown making an appearance at the 1998 Homebake live music festival, complete with apparently gay half-naked Asian dancers. He was booed and pelted with objects and later claimed &quot;Homophobia is alive and well in Sydney&quot;.

==Songs==
* &quot;Backdoor Man&quot; was originally conceived of as a lip-synch performance by Hunt for performance at a dance party. Another organiser of the party gave a recording of the song to the ABC to promote the dance party, and as a result, &quot;Backdoor Man&quot; became the most-requested song on Triple J over a period of 11 days. &quot;Backdoor Man&quot; consists of a series of samples of Hanson&#x27;s speeches stuck together to form sentences such as &quot;&quot;I&#x27;m a backdoor man. I&#x27;m homosexual. I&#x27;m very proud of it&quot;, and &quot;I&#x27;m a backdoor man for the Ku Klux Klan with very horrendous plans. I&#x27;m a very caring potato&quot;&quot;, parodying Hanson&#x27;s conservative politics. Hanson vehemently condemned the track, claiming that the song portrayed her as a prostitute and a transsexual.

* After the injunction over &quot;Backdoor Man&quot;, Pantsdown released the follow-up single &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like It&quot; in response. Once again the song used segments of Hanson&#x27;s voice to parody her, this time with equally ridiculous but less personal lyrics such as &quot;Why can&#x27;t my blood be coloured white? I should talk to some medical doctors; coloured blood is just not right&quot;. Once again the song was a hit on Triple J and peaked in the ARIA Charts at number 10 during the 1998 federal election campaign. &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like It&quot; was nominated for Best Comedy Release at the 1999 ARIA Awards.
* In 2004, on the &quot;Rock Against Howard&quot; compilation, Hunt released the song &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry&quot; under the pseudonym &quot;Little Johnny&quot;, which had appeared as a download on his website earlier in 2000 with a video. This song used the same techniques to parody John Howard&#x27;s refusal to apologise to the Aboriginal people of Australia over the Stolen Generations.

==Senate run==
Hunt changed his name by deed poll so that he would appear on the electoral ballot for the 1998 senate elections as &quot;Pauline Pantsdown&quot;; he later changed back to &quot;Simon Hunt&quot;. On the night of the federal election, Pantsdown performed at the Mardi Gras Sleaze Ball, and a Pauline Hanson Mardi Gras float was exploded.

==2010s==
Pantsdown performed a remixed version of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like It&quot; at the 2011 Sydney Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras Party during Bob Downe&#x27;s &#x27;Retro-Gras&#x27; DJ set just days before Hanson announced her candidacy in the 2011 NSW state election. Pantsdown also performed a remixed version of &quot;I Don&#x27;t Like It&quot; on Channel Seven&#x27;s &quot;The Morning Show&quot; on 22 May 2012. Nearing the end of the performance, Hunt undid a rainbow-coloured button-up shirt and revealed a T-shirt with the slogan &quot;ABBOTT is INSIDE me&quot; written on it, with a caricature of Tony Abbott&#x27;s head beneath it. In an interview following his performance, he claimed that he was partly inspired by the &quot;hurt and pain&quot; that, in particular, the communities Hanson targeted at the time felt, and &quot;wanted to give them an opportunity to laugh back&quot;. Kylie Gillies also noted that Hunt now lectures at a university (Media Arts, at the University of New South Wales College of Fine Arts, or COFA).

Hunt also campaigned against opera singer Tamar Iveri, who was released from a performance of Othello after making homophobic comments on social media. After Hanson won a place in the senate in 2016, Hunt considered a return as Pantsdown. In the same year, in a televised clip, Hanson referred to Hunt as &quot;What a joke...he was an absolute idiot ratbag&quot;.

Hunt maintains a Facebook page as Pauline Pantsdown. In 2016, he was campaigning against the same-sex marriage plebiscite and the Australian Christian Lobby.

Hunt explained, &quot;I think that stopping the plebiscite has been incredibly important in, at the very least, shutting down funding for those sorts of campaigns. It would have been a really dark stain on our history if we had funded a ‘no’ campaign for this issue, because it wouldn’t have been about marriage equality at all.&quot;

Nevertheless, the plebiscite went ahead, and the legality of same-sex marriage was ratified with a 61.6% vote in the affirmative.

During the Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey, Pantsdown ran a parody Twitter account spoofing the Coalition for Marriage.

<text>Sinndar (27 February 1997 – 26 November 2018) was an Irish Thoroughbred racehorse and sire. In a racing career that lasted from September 1999 until October 2000, he ran eight times and won seven races. He was notable for his unique achievement in winning The Derby, Irish Derby Stakes and Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe in the same year.

==Background==
Sinndar, a dark-coated bay horse with a white stripe and white hind feet, was bred by his owner the Aga Khan in Ireland.

He was sired by Grand Lodge out of the mare Sinntara. Apart from Sinndar, Grand Lodge (winner of the Dewhurst Stakes and the St James&#x27;s Palace Stakes) sired the winners of over six hundred races including Grandera, Indian Lodge (Prix du Moulin de Longchamp, Prix de la Forêt) and Queens Logic (undefeated two-year-old champion). Sinntara was a staying Listed race winner, descended from a highly successful family which had been established by Marcel Boussac. As a descendant of the broodmare Tourzima, Sinntara was from the same branch of Thoroughbred Family 13-c which produced Darshaan, Acamas (Prix du Jockey Club), Akarad (Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud) and Akiyda (Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe). His pedigree was seen as combining speed on his sire&#x27;s side with stamina from his dam.

Like many of his owner&#x27;s horses, he was sent into training with John Oxx near the Curragh, County Kildare, Ireland. Sinndar was ridden in all his races by the stable jockey, Johnny Murtagh.

==Racing career==

===1999: two-year-old season===
Sinndar did not appear on the racecourse until the September of his two-year-old season when he ran in a maiden race at his local course, the Curragh. Starting the Evens favourite, he took the lead in the final furlong and won &quot;comfortably&quot; by one and a half lengths from Rainbow And Gold, with the future Melbourne Cup winner Media Puzzle a neck away in third place.

Only two weeks after his debut, having never previously run in a Conditions race, Sinndar was sent to contest Ireland&#x27;s most important two-year-old race, the National Stakes over the same course and distance. He was regarded as a serious candidate, starting at odds of 7/1, but the overwhelming favourite was the Aidan O&#x27;Brien-trained Bernstein, who started at 4/11. Bernstein led from the start, and went clear of his opponents, but suddenly weakened inside the final furlong and was passed by the 50/1 outsider Murawwi. Sinndar, who had been apparently struggling to make an impression, began to stay on strongly, catching first Bernstein and then Murawwi to win the Group One prize by a head. After the race, Oxx characterised the horse as &quot;tough and very honest&quot; whilst the Aga Khan expressed his view that Sinndar had the potential to win more important races over longer distances.
===2000: three-year-old season===

====Spring====
In 2000, Sinndar was clearly aimed at a staying campaign, bypassing the usual Guineas trials and opening his season with a run in the Listed Ballysax Stakes. The race is one in which horses carry extra weight according to races they have already won, making it, unofficially, a form of handicap. As a Group One winner, Sinndar carried seven pounds more than his three opponents, and he was only third in the betting. Johnny Murtagh attempted to make all the running on Sinndar, but the colt was caught inside the final furlong and beaten a head by the Dermot Weld-trained Grand Finale, with the pair finishing fifteen lengths clear of the other two runners. It proved to be Sinndar&#x27;s only defeat.

A month later, in the Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial, Sinndar again gave seven pounds to the other runners, who included his stable companion Shawandi, who was in the race to set the pace, and the unbeaten Bach from Aidan O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s Ballydoyle stable. Sinndar and Bach were made joint favourites and dominated the finish after Shawandi gave up the lead in the straight. Both colts ran on strongly under pressure, with Sinndar winning by a head.

====Summer====
Sinndar&#x27;s next race was the Derby, although until just before the race, the possibility of firm ground at Epsom had led Oxx to consider running the colt in the Prix du Jockey Club- the French Derby instead. Despite the late withdrawal of the 2,000 Guineas winner King&#x27;s Best, the field for the 2000 Derby was a strong one, and Sinndar was fourth in the betting behind Sakhee, Beat Hollow and the Ballydoyle-trained Racing Post Trophy winner Aristotle, with Best of the Bests, representing Godolphin also well supported. Oxx was confident of a prominent showing, saying, &quot;Our fellow will run well and I&#x27;ll be disappointed if he doesn&#x27;t run a cracking race and be involved in the finish&quot;.

In the race, Sinndar ran close behind the leaders, and as the runners entered the straight he was fourth, behind Best of the Bests, Sakhee and the Henry Cecil-trained Wellbeing. A quarter mile from the finish, Richard Hills sent Sakhee to the front and went into a clear lead, but he was then challenged by Murtagh and Sinndar. The two colts raced together for a few strides, but inside the final furlong Sinndar pulled ahead to win by a length. It was five lengths back to Beat Hollow in third and another four back to Best of the Bests in fourth.

The Irish Derby featured an anticipated meeting between Sinndar and the English-trained Holding Court, who had won the Prix du Jockey Club- the French Derby- by six lengths on soft ground. Timeform rated the colts only one pound apart. The ground at the Curragh was also soft (officially &quot;yielding&quot;), but Sinndar was preferred in the betting at 11/10, with Holding Court 9/4. Sinndar was moved into the lead in the last quarter mile and pulled steadily away from the field to win by nine lengths, despite being eased down by Johnny Murtagh near the finish, in what was described as &quot;one of the great Classic performances&quot;. Holding Court finished sixth. The win also earned Sinndar&#x27;s owners a bonus of $1,000,000 from the race&#x27;s sponsors for winning both the English and Irish Derbies. Oxx revealed that winning the race fulfilled an ambition that had begun thirty-eight years earlier, when he had watched Arctic Storm, trained by his father, narrowly defeated in the 1962 running of the race.

====Autumn====
Sinndar was prepared for the Prix de l&#x27;Arc de Triomphe with a run in the Prix Niel over the same course and distance in September. The Niel often attracts the best colts in France (Montjeu and Hurricane Run were among the recent previous winners), but the opposition to Sinndar in the 2000 race was relatively weak. After taking over from his pacemaker Raypour at the start of the straight Sinndar pulled clear and beat Crimson Quest by eight lengths. Oxx was &quot;very happy&quot; with the performance, whilst being realistic about the quality of the opposition.

In October, Sinndar attempted to become the first winner of both The Derby and the Irish Derby to win the Arc. The previous colts to attempt the feat had been Nijinsky (second in 1970), Troy (third in 1979), Shahrastani (fourth in 1986), Kahyasi (sixth in 1988) and Generous (eighth in 1991). By far his most dangerous rival was expected to be the 1999 Arc winner Montjeu, who had won eight of his last nine starts, including six Group Ones, and was described as being &quot;on the verge of immortality&quot;. Montjeu was made 4/5 favourite ahead of Sinndar at 6/4, with the unbeaten German colt Samum, and the Prix Vermeille winner Volvoreta the only other runners to start at less than 25/1.

Sinndar led in the very early stages, before settling into second behind his pacemaker Raypour. Murtagh sent Sinndar past Raypour and into the lead at the start of the straight. Several horses attempted to challenge, with the filly Egyptband looking the biggest threat to the leader, but Sinndar stayed on to win by one and a half lengths. It was three lengths back to Volvoreta in third and a further two and a half lengths back to Montjeu in fourth. Murtagh was effusive in his praise of Sinndar&#x27;s speed and stamina, saying, &quot;No horse can get by him... he&#x27;s the best horse... unbeatable&quot;. However, Montjeu&#x27;s trainer, John Hammond, observed that &quot;You always think there&#x27;s going to come a day when they don&#x27;t quite fire and that happened today&quot;.

Feeling that the colt had &quot;nothing left to prove&quot;, Sinndar&#x27;s connections announced his retirement ten days later. 
==Race record==
==Assessment==
For his performances in 2000, Sinndar was voted European Champion Three-Year-Old Colt. Curiously, he was then beaten in a separate poll for the Cartier Horse of the Year title by a rival three-year-old colt, the miler Giant&#x27;s Causeway.

In the International Classification (the forerunner of the World Thoroughbred Racehorse Rankings) Sinndar was named the best three-year-old in the world and the second best racehorse of in 2000 with a rating of 132, two pounds behind Dubai Millennium (134) and five pounds ahead of Giant&#x27;s Causeway.

Sinndar was given a Timeform rating of 135 following his Arc win.

==Stud career==
After being retired from racing, Sinndar stood at the Aga Khan&#x27;s two main studs moving between the Haras de Bonneval in Le Mesnil-Mauger in Lower Normandy, and the Gilltown Stud in County Kildare.

He sired the winners of more than 200 races including Shawanda (dam of Encke), Youmzain and Rosanara (Prix Marcel Boussac) and Shareta finished second to Danedream in the 2011 Arc. Sinndar&#x27;s son, Sinnbad has also been to Royal Windsor Horse Show and Horse of the Year Show for ROR Showing, as well as winning many area dressage finals and the Sunshine Tour championship 2017.

He was moved to the Haras National du Lion d&#x27;Angers in 2015 and was retired from stud duty on 2017. His death was reported on 26 November 2018.
