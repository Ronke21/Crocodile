<text>Picture Post was a photojournalistic magazine published in the United Kingdom from 1938 to 1957. It is considered a pioneering example of photojournalism and was an immediate success, selling 1,000,000 copies a week after only two months. It has been called the UK&#x27;s equivalent of &quot;Life&quot; magazine.

The magazine&#x27;s editorial stance was liberal, anti-fascist, and populist, and from its inception, &quot;Picture Post&quot; campaigned against the persecution of Jews in Nazi Germany. In the 26 November 1938 issue, a picture story was run entitled &quot;Back to the Middle Ages&quot;: photographs of Adolf Hitler, Joseph Goebbels and Hermann Göring were contrasted with the faces of those scientists, writers and actors they were persecuting.

==History==
In January 1941 &quot;Picture Post&quot; published their &quot;Plan for Britain&quot;. This included minimum wages throughout industry, full employment, child allowances, a national health service, the planned use of land and a complete overhaul of education. This document led to discussions about post-war Britain and was a populist forerunner of William Beveridge&#x27;s November 1942 Report.

Sales of &quot;Picture Post&quot; increased further during World War II, and by December 1943, the magazine was selling 1,950,000 copies a week. By the end of 1949 circulation had declined to 1,422,000.

The founding editor, Stefan Lorant (who had also founded &quot;Lilliput&quot; and had even earlier pioneered the picture-story in Germany in the 1920s), had been succeeded by (Sir) Tom Hopkinson in 1940. Lorant, who was Jewish, had been imprisoned by Hitler in the early 1930s and later wrote a best-selling book, &quot;I Was Hitler&#x27;s Prisoner&quot;. By 1940, he feared that he would be captured in a Nazi invasion of Britain and so fled to Massachusetts, where he wrote important illustrated US histories and biographies.

During World War II, the art editor of the magazine, Edgar Ainsworth, served as a war correspondent and accompanied the American 7th Army on its advance across Europe in 1945. He visited the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp three times after the British army liberated the complex in April 1945. Several of his sketches and drawings from the camp were published in a September 1945 article, &quot;Victim and Prisoner&quot;. Ainsworth also commissioned the artist Mervyn Peake to visit France and Germany at the end of the war and reported from Bergen-Belsen.

Hopkinson said that his photographers were thoroughbreds and that text could always be written after the event, but if his photographers did not come back with good pictures, he had nothing to work with. Years later, Hopkinson said that the greatest photos he ever received to lay out were Bert Hardy&#x27;s images from the Korean War&#x27;s Battle of Incheon, for which James Cameron wrote the article. The magazine&#x27;s greatest photographers included Hardy, Kurt Hutton, Felix H. Man (aka Hans Baumann), Francis Reiss, Thurston Hopkins, John Chillingworth, Grace Robertson, and Leonard McCombe, who eventually joined &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s staff. Staff writers included MacDonald Hastings, Lorna Hay, Sydney Jacobson, J. B. Priestley, Lionel Birch, James Cameron, Fyfe Robertson, Anne Scott-James, Robert Kee and Bert Lloyd. Many freelancer writers contributed as well, including George Bernard Shaw, Dorothy Parker, and William Saroyan.

On 17 June 1950, &quot;Leader&quot; magazine was incorporated in &quot;Picture Post&quot;. Editor Tom Hopkinson was often in conflict with (Sir) Edward G. Hulton, the owner of &quot;Picture Post&quot;. Hulton mainly supported the Conservative Party and objected to Hopkinson&#x27;s socialist views. The conflict led to Hopkinson&#x27;s dismissal in 1950 following the publication of Cameron&#x27;s article, with pictures by Hardy, about South Korea&#x27;s treatment of political prisoners in the Korean War.

By June 1952, circulation had fallen to 935,000. Sales continued to decline in the face of competition from television and a revolving door of new editors. By the time the magazine closed in July 1957, circulation was less than 600,000 copies a week.

&quot;Picture Post&quot; was digitised as The Picture Post Historical Archive, 1938–1957 and consists of the complete, fully searchable facsimile archive of the &quot;Picture Post&quot;. It was made available in 2011 to libraries and institutions.

==Hulton Press Library==

As the photographic archive of &quot;Picture Post&quot; expanded through the Second World War, it became clear that its vast collection of photographs and negatives, both published and unpublished, were becoming an important historical documentary resource. In 1945, Sir Edward Hulton set up the Hulton Press Library as a semi-independent operation. He commissioned Charles Gibbs-Smith of the Victoria and Albert Museum to catalogue the entire archive using a system of keywords and classifications. The Gibbs-Smith system was the world&#x27;s first indexing system for pictures, and it was eventually adopted by the Victoria and Albert Museum and parts of the British Museum collections.

When &quot;Picture Post&quot; folded, Sir Edward Hulton sold the archive collection to the BBC in 1957. It was incorporated into the &quot;Radio Times&quot; photo archive, and the BBC expanded the collection further with the purchase of the photo archives of the &quot;Daily Express&quot; and &quot;Evening Standard&quot; newspapers. Eventually, the BBC disposed of its photo archive and the BBC Hulton Picture Library was sold on once more, this time to Brian Deutsch, in 1988. In 1996, the Hulton Picture Collection was bought by Getty Investments for £8.6 million. Getty Images now owns the rights to some 15 million photographs from the British press archives dating back to the 19th century. In 2000, Getty embarked on a large project to digitise the photo archive, and launched a dedicated website in 2001. A data migration programme began in 2003 and the Hulton Archive was transferred to the main Getty Images website; the Hulton Archive is still available today as a featured resource within the vast Getty holdings.

== Present day: &quot;Picture Stories&quot; ==
A documentary about the life and photographic legacy of &quot;Picture Post&quot;, &quot;Picture Stories&quot;, was produced by Ship of Life Films in 2021.

The documentary features archive interviews with editors Stefan Lorant and Tom Hopkinson and several &quot;Picture Post&quot; photographers, including Bert Hardy, Thurston Hopkins, John Chillingworth,  Humphrey Spender and David Steen. It also includes the photographer Grace Robertson&#x27;s last interview, in which she discusses her classic picture story &quot;Mother&#x27;s Day Off&quot;. Modern-day documentary photographers including David Hurn, Daniel Meadows, Anna Fox, Homer Sykes, Peter Dench and Nick Turpin discuss the photography and influence of &quot;Picture Post&quot;.

&quot;Picture Stories&quot; received positive reviews and won the Audience Award at the 2021 UK Jewish Film Festival. &quot;The Guardian&quot; gave the documentary a four-star review, describing it as &quot;inspiring&quot;.

<doc id="1108004" wikidata="Q3356503" url="?curid=1108004" title="Orleans, Ontario">
<text>Orleans (; French: ; officially and in French Orléans) is a community in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is located in the east end of the city along the Ottawa River, about from Downtown Ottawa. The Canada 2021 Census determined that Orléans&#x27; population was 125,937. Before being amalgamated into Ottawa in 2001, the community of Orléans was spread over two municipal jurisdictions, the eastern portion being in the pre-amalgamation City of Cumberland, the western portion in the City of Gloucester. According to the 2021 census, 75,453 people lived in the Cumberland portion of Orleans, while 50,484 lived in the Gloucester portion. Today, Orléans spans the municipal wards of Orléans East-Cumberland, Orléans West-Innes, and Orléans South-Navan. Orléans contains a significant francophone population.

== History ==

It was in the 1830s that the earliest pioneers arrived in the Orléans area. The Dupuis, Besserer, Major, Duford, and Vézina families were among the first Francophones. A few English-speaking families also made Orléans their home from the very beginning, such as the Kennys and the McNeelys. In 1880, the parish consisted of 43 Anglophone families and 131 Francophone families.

In 1858, the first subdivision plans (Lots 1 and 2) were registered in the County of Carleton for Gloucester Township, creating the Village of Saint-Joseph d&#x27;Orléans. In 1859, François Dupuis also registered his plan (Lot 3), including St. John (St-Jean), Dupuis (Dessere), and Scott Streets (St-Charles).

Monsignor Ebrard named Orleans in the late 1850s after the city of the same name in France. According to the Canadian Permanent Committee on Geographical Names files, he applied for the establishment of a post office &quot;plus tard en 1859.&quot; It was granted in 1860.

In 1860, Father Alphonse-Marius Chaîne was appointed resident priest of the new Saint-Joseph d’Orléans parish, founded in October of the same year.

In 1885, the first church opened its doors. In 1922, a second church - the current one - replaced the first, which had been destroyed by fire. The parish priest was Mgr. Hilaire Chartrand.

In the same year (1922), Orléans became a semi-autonomous municipality, known as a police village, and more decisions were made locally. The police village was governed by a council of three volunteers elected to preserve peace, health, and public safety. At the time, the village was part of Gloucester Township, which in turn, was part of Carleton County. However, some parishioners lived in Cumberland Township, east of Champlain Street, the dividing line between the townships.

By the 1950s, St-Joseph Boulevard became a major artery, with storefronts multiplying everywhere and new restaurants opening up the length of the through fare. Social life took on a decidedly community flavour, with clubs and community associations being formed. Commercial life improved considerably in Orléans in 1955 with the establishment of the first Chamber of Commerce, which campaigned on behalf of various causes, such as pressing for a decent water and sewer system in the 1960s. The quiet, rural community that was once Orléans lived its last moments in 1958 when developers hit the town, and from then on, things would never be the same. Orléans has known dramatic residential growth since then, which has led to profound social and linguistic changes in the population&#x27;s makeup.

The first significant real estate development was Queenswood Heights, with construction beginning in 1958. In 1970, the Grey Nuns of Charity Congregation sold 500 acres of land to the Costain and Minto real estate companies, which launched significant developments in the Convent Glen, Orléans Wood, Chatelaine Village areas, etc.

On 1 January 1974, the village of Saint-Joseph d’Orléans was incorporated into the Regional Municipality of Ottawa-Carleton. It was in the 1970s that the first high schools opened their doors, and after class hours, Orléans youth started setting up their clubs.

The housing and population boom years for Orléans came in the decade from 1981 to 1991. The population of Orléans tripled and grew from 24,000 to 70,000 people. Orléans recorded the second-highest population growth rate in the entire country in the late 1980s.

In 1989, Orléans became a municipality, Cumberland Township moved its city hall from Leonard, Ont. to Orléans. Orleans continued its residential developments through the 1990s. In addition to the residential developments, the 1990s in Orleans saw the final expansion of the Place d&#x27;Orléans shopping centre, a movie theatre, several new restaurants, new businesses, four new high schools, etc.

In 2001, Orléans was amalgamated into the City of Ottawa, becoming Urban sub-area No. 16 (now No. 15). The country-wide housing boom starting from 2000 has also seen a considerable amount of housing and residential areas being developed in the eastern Orléans area west of Trim Road and south of Innes Road, such as the new communities Avalon, Notting Gate (including Notting Hill). The population and business growth in the area prompted the re-development of Innes Road from a two-lane to a four-lane road in 2005. With the Innes Road expansion, newer business areas along Innes Road between Trim and Pagé Roads consist of many large retail outlets, restaurants, gyms, a movie theatre, etc.

Currently, the largest tenants at the facility are the Ottawa TFC soccer club (formerly known as the Cumberland United Soccer Club) and the Cumberland Panthers football club.

Petrie Island is situated along the Ottawa River northeast of Orléans. The Petrie Islands were formed by sand deposited at the close of the last ice age, about 12,000 years ago. The 2 km by 500 m area, from the foot of Champlain St. to Trim Rd in Orleans, has a total shoreline length, including all channels and bays, of about 12 km. Much of the area has been publicly owned since 1983, purchased to preserve the natural habitat of the western portion of the islands. Sand dredging at the eastern end was phased out in 2003, and the ten-hectare sand fill and natural beach is now used for public recreation. Petrie Island is home to turtles in some of its sheltered lagoons and has a nature centre for learning more about the local environment. There is a marina with canoe and kayak rentals. Petrie Island hosts annual Canada Day celebrations for the Orléans community.

There are also several nature trails and paths throughout the area, including the Bilberry Creek Trail and the Princess Louise Trail (incl. a waterfall) through which Taylor Creek runs. In 1984, the Township formed a committee to develop a policy for the use of Conservation lands and approved the policy in March 1985. In 1988 a Township-wide Nature trails sub-committee was formed under the Cumberland Township Recreation committee. This Committee, composed of volunteer Township residents, advises and assists the Township in developing, maintaining and protecting the natural areas within Cumberland.

At present, there are:

* 2.7 km of trails in Chatelaine Village
* 5.5 km of trails in Queenswood/Fallingbrook Escarpment
* 9 km of trails in Ravine – Township Western boundary (Q.H.)
* 2 km of trails in Cumberland Village

In 2009, the Shenkman Arts Centre opened just east of Place d&#x27;Orléans. It is a multidisciplinary arts centre that houses two theatres, seven galleries and 17 studios. The Centre houses activities within specialized spaces for hands-on instruction, creation and presentation of the visual, performing, literary and media arts and unique spaces for receptions and special events. Operated by the City of Ottawa, this diversity of programs and activities is attributed to a unique collaboration with the Centre’s Resident Arts Partners: AOE Arts Council, Gloucester Pottery School, MIFO (Mouvement d’implication francophone d’Orléans), Ottawa School of Art–Orléans Campus, and OYP Theatre School. The Centre is also home to Resident Company Tara Luz Danse and ARTicipate, a one-of-a-kind endowment fund that supports innovative programming at the Centre.

A memorial diorama by Bruce Garner was erected August 13, 2000 in the Memorial Park near Royal Canadian Legion, Branch 632 to remember those who have served Canada in wars and as peace keepers.

==Transportation==
Public transportation in Orléans is provided by OC Transpo. Route 39 is the only rapid or express route that serves Orléans, the route replacing the eastern part (after Blair) of the former route 95. The most frequent route is route 25, which travels via Innes, the most commercial and busy road of south Orléans, to/from La Cité or Millennium station. Local bus routes 24, 30, 32, 33, 34, 35, 38 and 302 provide service to/from Blair station to each route&#x27;s served neighbourhoods, while routes 31, 36 and 138 run to/from Place d&#x27;Orléans station. Connexion routes 221, 222, 228, 234 and 237 provide service to Blair on mornings, and back east to communities in the afternoon.

All local, express, and most connexion routes that serve Orléans to/from Blair currently travel via the 174 with dedicated bus lanes. But this will be replaced by the LRT O-Train east extension once it opens in mid-2025 with five under construction stations: Montréal station, Jeanne d&#x27;Arc station, Convent Glen station, Place d&#x27;Orléans station, and Trim station, which will be the eastern terminus for both Line 1 and Line 3. All of these stations are being built in the median of the 174.

<text>Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley is a civil parish within the Borough of Dartford in Kent, England. It lies to the south of the urban part of the Borough, and consists of the two settlements named, both to the west of the River Darent, one of the parish boundaries. The M25 motorway divides them. It has a population of 4,133, increasing to 4,230 at the 2011 Census.

==History of the parish==
In former times, when Kent was administered through areas known as lathes, Sutton-at-Hone was a half-lathe. It covered an area well in excess of Dartford Borough as it is today. The half-lathe embraced a number of towns and villages including Dartford (Darentford) and Hawley. 1894 saw the formation of the Parish Council of Sutton-at-Hone under the Local Government Act of that year. At that time the Council&#x27;s area included Sutton-at-Hone, Hawley, Swanley Junction, Swanley Village, Hextable and Crockenhill. In 1955 many parish boundaries were changed dramatically and the Parish was reduced to just Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley. In the late 1970s the parish was renamed Sutton-at-Hone and Hawley Parish Council to reflect its specific administration area see 

==St John&#x27;s Jerusalem==

Within the parish is the one-time Commandery of the Knights Hospitallers of the Order of St John of Jerusalem. Now in the hands of the National Trust, the garden and 13th century chapel are open to the public.

Farningham Road railway station is also located within the parish.

<text>Adam Brinley Woodyatt (born 28 June 1968) is an English actor. He is known for his role as Ian Beale in the BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;, a role he has portrayed since the show&#x27;s inception in 1985.

==Early life and education==
Woodyatt was born on 28 June 1968 in Walthamstow, and grew up in east London. He was educated at two independent schools: Forest School, on the edge of Epping Forest, in Walthamstow in north east London, where he shared classes with comedy writer Sharat Sardana and cricket captain Nasser Hussain; and the Sylvia Young Theatre School. He also attended Llanidloes High School, Llanidloes, Wales.

==Career==
Aged 13, Woodyatt appeared on stage at the National Theatre in Tom Stoppard&#x27;s play &quot;On the Razzle&quot;. Following the completion of his studies at the Sylvia Young Theatre School, Woodyatt appeared in the BBC&#x27;s children&#x27;s drama series &quot;The Baker Street Boys&quot; and the ITV fantasy series &quot;The Witches and the Grinnygog&quot;, both airing in 1983. He then put his acting career on hiatus and worked as a butcher in Wales for a brief period, before joining the cast of BBC soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Not expecting to stay much beyond the first year, Woodyatt has become the longest-serving male cast member in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In 2013, his longevity was honoured at The British Soap Awards, where he received a Lifetime Achievement Award for his portrayal of Ian Beale.

Woodyatt has also appeared as a guest personality on several BBC game shows and charity fundraisers, including &quot;A Question of Sport&quot;, &quot;Robot Wars&quot; (winning the show&#x27;s Celebrity Special with the robot &quot;Pussycat&quot;) and &quot;Children in Need&quot;. In 2015, Woodyatt played the henchman of the Wicked Queen in a pantomime production of &quot;Snow White&quot; at Swindon&#x27;s Wyvern Theatre. Speaking about joining the production, Woodyatt commented: &quot;I absolutely love performing in front of an audience as it&#x27;s so different to camera – I love the reaction of the audience. I am very much looking forward to spending the Christmas season at the Wyvern Theatre, which I know has a reputation for staging outstanding pantomimes.&quot;

On 24 April 2015, the comedy singer Gavin Osborn released a song titled &quot;Adam Woodyatt&quot;, with the lines &quot;Imagine how it feels, being Ian Beale&quot;. In 2019, he appeared on &quot;Celebrity Masterchef&quot;.

In August 2020, it was announced Woodyatt would be taking an &quot;extended break&quot; from appearing in &quot;EastEnders&quot;. In 2022, he made a brief return for the funeral of Dot Cotton (June Brown). He returned on a permanent basis in August 2023, alongside the character&#x27;s wife Cindy Beale who was supposedly killed off 25 years prior.

In November 2021, Woodyatt was announced as one of the two annual late entrants during the twenty-first series of&quot; I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;, entering alongside &quot;Coronation Street&quot; actor Simon Gregson. He was eliminated on day 18 from Gwrych Castle (hosting its second season) in Wales on 10 December 2021, finishing in sixth place. 

Woodyatt is also a photographer, a hobby he took up while performing &quot;On The Razzle&quot; at the National Theatre when he was 13 years old.

In 2008, he won the Architectural Photographer of the Year Award of The Societies of Photographers with a picture he took at St Pancras, where he was filming &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

==Personal life==
On 8 April 1998, Woodyatt married dancer Beverley Sharp in a private ceremony at Disney World, Florida. The couple have two children. For many years, the family lived in Southam, Warwickshire, some 72 miles northwest of the BBC Elstree Studios in south Hertfordshire, where &quot;EastEnders&quot; is recorded. On 21 August 2020, it was revealed that Woodyatt had decided to separate from Sharp the previous year, after more than twenty years of marriage. Woodyatt is a supporter of Liverpool F.C. and has been described by Digital Spy as a &quot;huge sci-fi fanatic&quot;.

===Charity===
Inspired by his father&#x27;s death from cancer aged 58, Woodyatt has helped raise money for various cancer research initiatives, and broke his collarbone in June 2003 whilst training for a charity bicycle ride.

Woodyatt was also involved in launching an Aid for Haiti event at Coventry&#x27;s Ricoh Arena in February 2010, with many of his actor colleagues posing for photographs, signing autographs, and providing items for an auction, which raised £30,000. Woodyatt is also a supporter of Warwickshire &amp; Northamptonshire Air Ambulance and an Ambassador for the Children&#x27;s Air Ambulance.

In January 2019, it was announced that he would be running the London Marathon with some of his &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-stars for a Dementia campaign in honour of former &quot;Eastenders&quot; actress Barbara Windsor.

<doc id="1108025" wikidata="Q3078159" url="?curid=1108025" title="Fort de Chartres">
<text>Fort de Chartres was a French fortification first built in 1720 on the east bank of the Mississippi River in present-day Illinois. It was used as the administrative center for the province, which was part of New France. Due generally to river flooding, the fort was rebuilt twice, the last time in limestone in the 1750s in the era of French colonial control over Louisiana and the Illinois Country.

The magazine (ammunition storehouse) of the fort is believed to be the oldest surviving building in Illinois. A partial reconstruction now exists of the limestone fort and the site is preserved as an Illinois state park, four miles (6 km) west of Prairie du Rocher in Randolph County, Illinois. Located on the floodplain area that became known as the American Bottom, the site is south of modern St. Louis. The forts were placed on the National Register of Historic Places and recognized as a National Historic Landmark on October 15, 1966. It was named one of the contributing properties to the French Colonial Historic District in 1974, along with other French-influenced sites such as the Creole House, the Pierre Menard House, the Kolmer Site (a former Indian village), and the site of Fort Kaskaskia.

The name of the fort honored Louis, duc de Chartres, son of the Regent of France. The state historic site today hosts several large re-enactments at the fort of colonial-era civil and military life each summer.

==History==

===French rule===
On January 1, 1718, the French government granted a trade monopoly to John Law and his Company of the West. Hoping to make a fortune mining precious metals, the company built a fort to protect its interests. The original wooden fort was built in 1718–1720 by a French contingent from New Orleans, led by Pierre Dugué de Boisbriant. When administration of the Illinois Country was moved from Quebec City to New Orleans, governance was transferred to the Company of the Indies. The fort was built to be the seat of government and to control the Indians of the region, particularly the Fox. The original fort was a palisade of logs with two bastions at opposite corners.

Within five years, flooding from the Mississippi had left the original fort in bad condition. Construction of a second fort further from the river, but still on the flood plain, began in 1725. This fort was also made of logs and had a bastion at each of the four corners.

The second wooden fort deteriorated somewhat less rapidly but by 1742 was in bad repair. In 1747 the French garrison moved to the region&#x27;s primary settlement to the south at Kaskaskia. The French debated where to rebuild the fort. When rule of the area reverted to the French crown in the 1730s, officials began to discuss construction of a stone fortress. The government in New Orleans wanted to move the garrison permanently to Kaskaskia, but the local commandant argued for a location near the original site.

The government decided to rebuild a fort in stone near the first forts rather than at Kaskaskia. Construction began in 1753 and was mostly completed in 1754. The limestone fort had walls 15-ft (3 m)-high and 3-ft (1 m)-thick, enclosing an area of 4 acres (16,000 m2). The stone for construction was quarried in bluffs about two or three miles (4 km) distant and had to be ferried across a small lake.

In August 1751 Francois Saucier was summoned from Mobile to New Orleans by Governor Vaudreuil for a special assignment. This assignment was for the construction of a new fort to accommodate the garrison of additional troops that France was sending to the colony. The new fort was to replace the old wooden Fort de Chartres and was to be constructed of stone at the settlement. The main purpose of the new fort was to impress the warring Chickasaw Tribe of the area and to check and halt the progress of the British in the area. This new assignment required Francois to immediately journey to his new post in Illinois without the benefit of first returning home to Mobile for personal necessities. 
The original intention of the French Government was for Francois and his crew to build the new stone Fort de Chartres in Kaskaskia. The Governor of the territory, Vaudreuil, eventually made the decision to leave the Fort where it stood. Due to problems of flooding it was decided to move it a little over one half mile north of the old fort. Upon arriving he took on the task of surveying the terrain, its situation and advantages, in order to make recommendations on construction. Once his plans were completed he sent them as instructed to the governor in New Orleans with all specifications and estimated costs. After some time of deliberations by the French government and many delays and discussions of the cost of construction as planned by Francois, a scaled down version of the fort was finally given approval and Francois was then given permission to start its construction. During this period of waiting for approval from France, preparations were being conducted by Francois and his crew of soldiers as he had been instructed by the governor for the forts construction, including clearing the land, felling of trees for timber and other site preparations. After the many earlier delays, the budget for building the new fort was finally approved and they proceed with the construction of Fort de Chartres.

===British rule===
In 1763 the Treaty of Paris was signed following the Seven Years&#x27; War (French and Indian War) and the French transferred control of the Illinois Country east of the Mississippi to Great Britain. (Spain had been granted the western part of the Illinois Country—also known as &quot;Upper Louisiana&quot;—in the 1762 Treaty of Fontainebleau.) The stone fort had served as center of French administration of the region for only twenty years.

The British had difficulty getting a regiment to their newly acquired fort, but on October 10, 1765, a small detachment of the 42nd Regiment of Foot commanded by Captain Thomas Stirling took control of the fort and surrounding area. The 42nd was shortly replaced by the 34th Foot. French Canadian settlers were ordered to leave or get a special license to remain. Many Canadien settlers moved to the more congenial culture of St. Louis. The 34th Regiment of Foot renamed the installation Fort Cavendish, after its colonel. However, the post was known as Ft. Chartres from 1768 on, after the 34th were replaced by the 18th Regiment of Foot under the command of Lt. Col. Wilkins. The British abandoned the post in May 1772 when the majority of the 18th Foot was ordered back to Philadelphia. A small party under Capt Hugh Lord remained at Kaskaskia until May 1776.

===Ruin===
The Mississippi continued to take its toll after the fort was abandoned. In 1772 the south wall and bastion fell into the river. The remaining walls deteriorated, and visitors noted trees growing in them by the 1820s. Locals carted away stones for construction over the years. By 1900 the walls were gone. The only part of the original fort that remained was the stone masonry powder magazine.

===Reconstruction===
The State of Illinois acquired the ruins in 1913 as a historic site and restored the powder magazine in 1917. The powder magazine is thought to be the oldest existing building in the state of Illinois. In the 1920s the foundations of the fort&#x27;s buildings and walls were exposed. In the late 1920s and through the 1930s, the US WPA rebuilt the gateway and two stone buildings.

A combination museum and office building, constructed in 1928 on the foundation of an original fort building, houses exhibits depicting French life at Fort de Chartres. The large stone &quot;Guards House&quot;, reconstructed in 1936, contains a Catholic chapel furnished in the style of the 1750s, along with a priest&#x27;s room, a gunner&#x27;s room, an officer-of-the-day room, and a guard&#x27;s room. Also on the grounds are an operating bake oven, a garden shed built of upright logs in French Colonial &quot;poteaux-sur-sol&quot; (French: &quot;post on sill&quot;) construction, and a kitchen garden with raised beds of produce typical of French 18th-century Illinois.

Partial reconstruction of the fort&#x27;s walls on the original foundations followed in 1989. The frames of some additional buildings were erected as a display of the post-and-beam construction techniques used for the originals. Other buildings&#x27; foundations and cellars were exposed for educational display as well.

Today the site has a museum and small gift shop. It plays host each June to a Rendezvous that is said to be one of the largest and oldest in the country, celebrating frontier French and Indian culture.

The site is protected by modern levees, but the Mississippi River is still an occasional menace. The flood of 1993 breached the levee and sent waters fifteen feet deep to lap at the top of the walls.

<text>Birmabright is a trade name of the former Birmetals Co. (Birmabright works in Clapgate Lane, Quinton, Birmingham, UK) for various types of lightweight sheet metal in an aluminium–magnesium alloy. The alloy was introduced by the Birmid Group in 1929 and was particularly noted for its corrosion resistance. Birmal Boats was created in 1930 for the building of light-alloy boats. Birmetals Ltd was formed in 1936 and during the war produced both copper bearing aluminium alloys and the Birmabright magnesium bearing alloys, mainly for aircraft production.

The constituents were from 1% to 7% magnesium, with &lt;1% manganese, and the remainder aluminium. The alloys were provided in different temper conditions. e.g. soft, 1/4 hard, 1/2 hard and were designed to be work hardened e.g. by cold pressing into shape. They do not exhibit age hardening, or have a precipitation heat treatment to promote hardening (unlike other contemporary aluminium alloys such as Duralumin). Weldability is good but machinability is only fair to poor. The alloy has good seawater corrosion resistance (unlike Duralumin). 

Birmetals Ltd Birmabright grades included the following : 
The Birmabright designations are obsolete, but equivalent grades exist, for example BB2 equivalent specifications are British standard NS4, American 5251 and ISO designation AlMg2. 

Gas welding of Birmabright is easier than that of pure aluminium and may be carried out autogenously using scraps of the same material as a filler rod. 
Birmabright is best known as the material used in the body of the Land Rover from its launch in April 1948, and in a few other classic British vehicles. The doors, boot lid and bonnet of most Rover P4 models were also Birmabright, however towards the end of production this was changed to steel to reduce costs. An early use in the 1930s was for the bodywork of the land speed record car, Thunderbolt. Also used for the bodywork of Bluebird K7 used for the Coniston speed record attempt by Donald Campbell.

The well known Laurent Giles designed 46ft sailboat &quot;Beyond&quot; was built of riveted sheets of Birmabright and circumnavigated in the early 1950s by Tom and Ann Worth. The hull proved corrosion resistant but required re-riveting later due to crystallisation of the rivet heads, and lasted well until being sunk in the Caribbean as an artificial diving reef in the 1980s.

Birmetals (part of the Birmid Qualcast Group) closed its factory in 1980 after losing money in 1977-1979, followed by a protracted strike over wages by key staff which prevented production.

<text>Vladimir Mikhailovich Bekhterev (; 20 January 1857 – 24 December 1927) was a Russian neurologist and the father of objective psychology. He is best known for noting the role of the hippocampus in memory, his study of reflexes, and Bekhterev’s disease. Moreover, he is known for his competition with Ivan Pavlov regarding the study of conditioned reflexes.

The sudden circumstances of his death has led to rumours that he died on the orders of Joseph Stalin. This is because Bekhterev performed a medical diagnosis of Stalin shortly before his death which was considered to be politically damaging to the position of the Soviet dictator. This remains disputed among scholars due to the lack of direct evidence.

==Early life==
Vladimir Bekhterev was born in Sorali, a village in the Vyatka Governorate of the Russian Empire between the Volga River and the Ural Mountains. V. M. Bekhterev&#x27;s father – Mikhail Pavlovich – was a district police officer; his mother, Maria Mikhailovna – was a daughter of a titular councilor, was educated at a boarding school which also provided lessons of music and the French language. Beside Vladimir they had two more sons in the family: Nikolai and Aleksandr, older than he by 6 and 3 years respectively. In 1864 the family moved to Vyatka, and within a year the head of the family died of tuberculosis when Bekhterev was still very young. While his childhood was not simple, Bekhterev did have the opportunity to attend Vyatka gymnasium in 1867, one of the oldest schools in Russia, as well as the Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg in 1873. Then he studied in St. Petersburg Medicosurgical Academy where he worked under professor Jan Lucjan Mierzejewski (pl). It was here where Bekhterev&#x27;s interest in the disciplines of neuropathology and psychiatry were first sparked.

Russia went to war with the Ottoman Empire in 1877. Bekhterev took time off from his studies in order to help the war effort by volunteering with an ambulance detachment. After the war, he returned to school. While attending school, Bekhterev worked as a junior doctor in the clinic of mental and nervous diseases at the Institutes of Medic’s Improvement. Here he began performing his experimental work. In 1878, Bekhterev graduated from the Medical and Surgery Academy of St. Petersburg with a degree similar to a Bachelor of Medicine. After graduating, Bekhterev worked at the Psychiatric Clinic in St. Petersburg, where he was inspired to begin studying the anatomy and physiology of the brain, the area in which he would later make some of his most notable contributions. It was also during this time that Bekhterev married Natalya Bazilevskaya.

In 1880, Bekhterev began publishing his research. One of his earlier works described Russian social issues. In this paper, he wrote essays describing the individual characteristics of the Votyaks (Udmurts), a Finno-Ugric people under Russian rule who live in the Udmurt Republic between the rivers Vyatka and Kama. Then, on 4 April 1881, Bekhterev successfully defended his doctoral thesis, &quot;Clinical studies of temperature in some forms of mental disorders,&quot; and received his doctorate from the Medicosurgical Academy of St. Petersburg. This doctorate allowed Bekhterev to become a &quot;private-docent&quot; or associate professor, where he lectured on the diagnostics of nervous diseases.

==Contribution to neurology==

Throughout his career, Bekhterev conducted a large amount of research which greatly contributed to the current understanding of the brain. This research was described in works such as &quot;The Conduction Paths in the Brain and Spinal Cord,&quot; written in 1882, followed by a second edition written in 1896. In 1884 he published 58 scientific works about the functions of the brain. His extensive research led to an 18-month travel scholarship awarded to study and conduct research in both Germany and Paris. On this trip he worked with and learned from a variety of notable contributors the field of science such as Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920), Paul Emil Flechsig (1847–1929), Theodor Meynert (1833–1892), Karl Friedrich Otto Westphal (1833–1890), Emil du Bois-Reymond (1818–1896), and Jean Martin Charcot (1825–1893). Bekhterev&#x27;s scholarship lasted until September 1885, after which, he returned to Russia and worked as the head of the Psychiatry Department at the University of Kazan until 1893.

During his time at the University of Kazan, Bekhterev made some of his greatest contributions to neurological science. He established the first laboratory of experimental psychology in Russia in 1886 to study the nervous system and the structures of the brain. As a result of his research, Bekhterev believed that there were zones within the brain and each of these zones had a specific function. Moreover, because nervous disorders and mental disorders usually occur in conjunction with each other, he believed that there was no definite distinction between these disorders. When conducting research at the University of Kazan, Bekhterev also identified Ankylosing Spondylitis or
Bekhterev’s disease (more frequently spelled in English as Bechterew’s disease, following the German transliteration system for Russian names), a degenerative arthritis of the spine. As a result of his groundbreaking research, in 1891, Bekhterev was granted permission by the Kazan government to open and become the chairman of the Neurology Science Society.

In 1893, Bekhterev left the University of Kazan to return to St. Petersburg Military Medical Academy to become the head to the Department of Nervous and Mental Diseases where he worked with Alexandre Dogiel. Here he continued his contribution to neurological research by organizing the first Russian neurosurgical operating room to specialize in neurosurgery. While Bekhterev never performed any surgeries himself, he was highly involved in the diagnostics of neurological diseases, eventually earning him the Full State Chancellor Title in 1894.

Between 1894 and 1905 Bekhterev was very busy with his research. He completed between 14 and 24 scientific works per year and founded &quot;Nevrologicheski Vestnik&quot; (Neurology Bulletin) in 1893, the first Russian journal on nervous disease. Eventually, his work earned him the Baire’s Prize, awarded in December 1900, for the two volumes of his writing “Pathways of brain and bone marrow” in which he noted the role that the hippocampus plays in memory. Bekhterev&#x27;s other writings include “Mind and Life,” a book written in 1902, which contained multiple volumes including “Foundations for Brain Functions Theory” written in 1903. “Foundations for Brain Functions Theory” described Bekhterev&#x27;s views on the functions of the parts of the brain and the nervous system. It also suggested the Energetic Inhibition Theory which describes automatic responses (reflexes). This theory claims that there is an active energy in the brain which moves towards a center, and when this happens, the other parts of the brain are left in an inhibited state.
He published around 600 scientific papers. The most important works are &quot;Suggestion and its Role in Social Life&quot; (1899), &quot;Consciousness and its Borders&quot; (1888), &quot;Psyche and Life&quot; (1902),&quot;Objective Psychology&quot; (1907), &quot;Subject Matter and Tasks of Social Psychology as an Objective Science&quot; (1911), &quot;Collective Reflexology&quot; (1921) and &quot;General Principles of Human Reflexology&quot; (1926). An Autobiography was published at 1928, after his death. He founded other scientific journals: the “Archives of psychiatry, neurology and experimental psychology” (1896) and the “Bulletin of psychology, criminal anthropology and hypnotism” (1904).
“Suggestion and its role in social life” is a book of its time, the turning of the nineteenth to the twentieth century.
On the question of the so-called psychic epidemic (folie à deux, folie à millions...), the author refers Calmeil, Landel, Laségue, Falret, Legrand de Saule, Regnard, Baillarger, Moreau de Tours and Morel. Gustave Le Bon and Gabriel Tarde are also mentioned on the psychology of the crowds.. He stresses the difference between suggestion and hypnosis
Bekhterev was interested in phenomena of direct mental suggestion and made experiments to influence behavior of dogs at distance (José Manuel Jara, 2013).
Bekhterev&#x27;s research on associated responses would become highly connected with the important area of psychology called Behaviorism. It also led to a long-standing rivalry with Ivan Pavlov, described in further detail below.

==Objective psychology==
Objective psychology is based on the principle that all behavior can be explained by objectively studying reflexes. Therefore, behavior is studied through observable traits. This idea contrasted the more subjective views of psychology such as structuralism, which allowed for the use of tools such as introspection to study inner thoughts about personal experiences.

Objective Psychology would later become the basis of Reflexology, Gestalt Psychology, and especially behaviorism, an area which would later revolutionize the field of psychology and the manner in which the science of psychology is conducted. Bekhterev’s beliefs about how to best conduct research contributed to the rise of Soviet sociolinguistics from the ashes of völkerpsychologie and the Journal of the History of the behavioral Sciences.

==Other contributions==
Bekhterev founded the Psychoneurological Institute at the St. Petersburg State Medical Academy; however, he was forced to resign in 1913 as a professor at the Military Medical Academy in St. Petersburg. He was reinstated in 1918 following the Russian Revolution of 1917 and became the chairperson for the Department of Psychology and Reflexology at the University of Petrograd in St. Petersburg as well as established the Institute of Studying Brain Mental Activities.

In 1921 he was involved in organising the First Conference on Scientific Organization of Labour. He was critical of Taylorism arguing that &quot;The ultimate ideal of the labour problem is not in it, but is in such organisation of the labour process that would yield a maximum of efficiency coupled with a minimum of health hazards, absence of fatigue and a guarantee of the sound health and all round personal development of the working people.&quot;

During his time away from teaching, Bekhterev worked to open an orphanage, complete with both a kindergarten and school, for refugee children from the western regions of Russia. He also participated in creating health services in the &quot;young country&quot; of Russia.

Ensuing from his doctrine of reflex arc, Bekhterev postulated the impact of social conditions on mental health. Thus, he demanded the improve of social conditions to improve mental health and to reduce crime.

==Rivalry with Ivan Pavlov==
Both Ivan Pavlov and Bekhterev independently developed a theory of conditioned reflexes which describe automatic responses to the environment. What was called association reflex by Bekhterev is called the conditioned reflex by Pavlov, although the two theories are essentially the same. Because John Watson discovered the salivation research completed by Pavlov, this research was incorporated into Watson’s famous theory of Behaviorism, making Pavlov a household name. While Watson used Pavlov’s research to support his Behaviorist claims, closer inspection shows that in fact, Watson’s teachings are better supported by Bekhterev’s research.

Bekhterev was familiar with Pavlov’s work and had multiple criticisms. According to Bekhterev, one of Pavlov’s major research flaws included using a saliva method. He found fault with this method because it could not be easily used on humans. In contrast, Bekhterev&#x27;s method of studying this association (conditioned) reflex using mild electrical stimulation to examine motor reflexes was able to demonstrate the existence of this reflex in humans. Bekhterev also questioned using acid to encourage saliva from the animals. He felt that this practice may contaminate the results of the experiment. Finally, Bekhterev criticized Pavlov’s method by stating that the secretory reflex is unimportant and unreliable. If the animal is not hungry then food may not elicit the desired response, acting as evidence of the method’s unreliability. Pavlov however was not without his own criticisms of Bekhterev, stating that Bekhterev’s laboratory was poorly controlled.

==Death==
According to Moroz (1989) and Shereshevsky (1992), mystery surrounds the death of Bekhterev. Bekhterev was a co-founder of the First All-Russian Congress of Neurologists and Psychiatry, held in December 1927 in Moscow, and was appointed as an Honorary President of the Congress. On 23 December 1927, after having lectured on child neurology at the Congress, Bekhterev went to the Kremlin to examine Joseph Stalin. About 3 hours later he came back to the Congress for a meeting and said to some colleagues there: &quot;I have just examined a paranoiac with a short, dry hand.&quot; The day after, Bekhterev suddenly died, causing speculation that he was poisoned by Stalin as revenge for the diagnosis.
Moreover, after Bekhterev&#x27;s death, Stalin had Bekhterev&#x27;s name and all of his works removed from Soviet textbooks.

==Legacy==

Vladimir Bekhterev&#x27;s contributions to science and specifically psychology were impressive. Bekhterev was a force in the science of neurology; greatly expanding knowledge on how the brain works as well as the parts of the brain. For instance, his research on the hippocampus allowed for the understanding of one of the most central portions of the brain vital to the function of memory. Moreover, his influence to psychology was immeasurable. Bekhterev’s works laid the groundwork for the future of psychology. His ideas regarding Objective psychology as well as his views on reflexes were a cornerstone of behaviorism.

According to a study conducted in 2015, Vladimir Bekhterev included in &quot;Russia team on medicine&quot;. This list includes fifty-three famous Russian medical scientists from the Russian Federation, the Soviet Union, and the Russian Empire who were born in 1757—1950.

<text>National Rebirth of Poland (), abbreviated to NOP, is an ultranationalist far-right political party in Poland registered by the District Court in Warsaw and National Electoral Commission. As of the 2015 election, the party had no seats in the Polish parliament. It was a member of the European National Front.

==History and politics==

National Rebirth of Poland was founded as a nationalist discussion group for young people on 10 November 1981. It joined the Christian National Union when that party was founded in 1989, before leaving in February 1990. The NOP registered as a political party in 1992. The party is the only far-right organisation to claim to be a successor to the National Radical Camp Falanga (ONR), the pre-war nationalist youth organisation, which was banned in 1934.

NOP publishes the magazines (the name of the Polish royal coronation sword), which lists neofascists Derek Holland and Roberto Fiore among the members of its editorial board, (&quot;National Youth&quot;), (&quot;The Thought&quot;), and (&quot;17 – The Civilization of the Times of Trial&quot;).

In 2009, NOP membership in Poland was estimated at 1000. NOP also has supporters outside Poland, notably among the Polish American community, including Polish Patriots&#x27; Association residing in New York City, and the revisionist Polish Historical Institute in Chicago.

In 2001, the NOP tried to enter parliamentary politics for the first time. The newly created NOP front organization, the New Forces Alliance (), joined the nationalist electoral bloc, Alternative Social Movement (). Among the NOP candidates were Marcin Radzewicz, the leader of the openly neo-Nazi National Socialist Front (). ARS gained just below 0.5% of the votes, and the alliance was dissolved.

In the 2005 parliamentary elections, the NOP received 0.06% of the vote. In the 2006 self-government regional elections, it received 0.30%, or about 41 000 votes. In the 2007 parliamentary election, the NOP received 42 407 votes in four electoral districts. In the self-government regional elections in 2010, the party received 0.24% of the vote.

In the 2011 parliamentary elections, NOP senate candidate Anetta Stemler, running in the 1st electoral district, received 2934 votes, or 3.10%.

The NOP is known for trying to get media attention with its shock value campaigns. During the 2007 parliamentary election, the NOP distributed election campaign posters with the slogan &quot;Fascism? We are worse.&quot;

Another, openly homophobic shock value campaign conducted by the NOP was called &quot;Zakaz Pedalowania&quot; (the phrase is a pun meaning both &quot;Cycling Forbidden&quot; and &quot;Faggotry Forbidden&quot;). On 17 May 2006 in Toruń, the NOP organized a counter-demonstration against a public LGBT rights supporters&#x27; meeting. NOP members chanted slogans, including &quot;gas the queers&quot; () and &quot;there will be a baton for a queer face&quot; ().

==Antisemitism and racism==

The NOP is stated to be an antisemitic organisation by a number of government bodies, nongovernmental organizations, academic institutions and individual experts worldwide, such as the United States Department of State, and the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance (ECRI). According to The Stephen Roth Institute for the Study of Contemporary Antisemitism and Racism, the NOP is promoting violent forms of neo-fascism and antisemitism, including Holocaust denial.
According to the British historian, Dr John Pollard, neo-Nazi elements in the NOP and their racism and homophobia continue to give rise to concern in other member countries of the European Union.
NOP actions were also condemned by the Anti-Defamation League, which claims that the NOP is an openly anti-Semitic extremist organization. According to the magazine &quot;The Warsaw voice&quot;, the manifesto of the National Revival of Poland, which contains a sentence stating that &quot;Jews will be removed from Poland, and their possessions will be confiscated&quot;, is taken directly from Adolf Hitler&#x27;s &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;. The magazine also claims that the official greeting gesture used in the party is the Nazi-like gesture of the raised arm.

A number of NOP-related incidents received some media coverage in Poland and abroad. According to the European Roma Rights Centre, on July 3, 1998, NOP supporters vandalised the Roma community centre in Łódź. Along with racist graffiti, swastikas were sprayed onto the office walls. The perpetrators also left behind their signature as . During the same night, the same group reportedly vandalised the premises of the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses religious group.

In March 2000, in Łódź, swastikas and the slogan &quot;Jews out!&quot; along with NOP symbols were spray-painted on the home of Marek Edelman, who was the deputy commander in the Warsaw Ghetto uprising and the last of the leaders of the uprising still alive. The incident was condemned by the president and prime minister of Poland, who sent Edelman letters of support and apology.

NOP front organization National-Radical Institute (, INR) was involved in publishing Western and Polish Holocaust denial literature. In 1997, INR published a volume of translated works of Western Holocaust deniers under the title &quot;The Myth of the Holocaust&quot;. The same year, INR announced that there were no exterminations in gas chambers at Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp.

In 2006, the NOP was involved in campaigning to free convicted British Holocaust denier David Irving from prison in Austria, and produced a poster containing the slogan &quot;&quot; (&quot;David Irving – Free the truth&quot;.)

The party also expressed support for the bombing of Israel at the time of the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict, with a poster image stating, &quot;&quot; (&quot;Bombs against Israel – it&#x27;s about time!!!&quot;). On August 13, 2006, NOP leader Adam Gmurczyk published a declaration on behalf of the NOP Executive Council titled &quot;&quot; (&quot;Israel must be destroyed!&quot;), calling for the international military takeover of Israel, and offering to put administrative control of Jerusalem in the hands of Pope Benedict XVI and his successors.

On April 14, 2007, in Kraków, antisemitic slogans were shouted and fascist-like gestures made by the participants of an NOP demonstration. Investigations by the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office were discontinued on November 26, 2007, as no perpetrators were identified and the case was not classified as an offense.

<doc id="1108041" wikidata="Q3547877" url="?curid=1108041" title="Shane Richie">
<text>Shane Patrick Paul Roche (born 11 March 1964), known as Shane Richie, is an English actor, comedian, presenter and singer. Following initial success as a stage and screen performer, he became best known for his portrayal of the character Alfie Moon in the BBC One soap opera &quot;EastEnders&quot; (appearing 2002–2005, 2010–2016, 2018–2019, 2022–present) and then in its spin-off RTÉ Drama &quot;Redwater&quot; in 2017. In 2020, he appeared on the twentieth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here&quot; and finished in fourth place.

Richie has presented a number of BBC game shows including &quot;Reflex&quot;, &quot;Win Your Wish List&quot; and &quot;Decimate&quot;.

He also regularly appears in pantomime and has repeatedly starred as Robin Hood. He first took the role appearing at the Mayflower Theatre, Southampton in 2016, then repeated it in 2017 at the New Victoria Theatre, Woking. He then reprised the role once again in 2018 at the Milton Keynes Theatre. In 2019 he starred alongside Jennie Dale as the title character in Dick Whittington at the Bristol Hippodrome in Bristol.

==Early life and career beginnings==
Richie was born on 11 March 1964 at St Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington, London to Irish parents. He attended Willesden High School and was a member of a youth theatre as a child, and began his professional career in adolescence as a bluecoat entertainer at a Pontins holiday camp Little Canada, on the Isle of Wight. He progressed to the live stand up circuit, receiving a nomination for best new stand-up at the inaugural British Comedy Awards.

In 1989, Richie made nightly appearances for Sky TV&#x27;s chat show series &quot;Jameson Tonight&quot;, which was hosted by Derek Jameson and Richie and recorded at the Windmill Theatre, London. In 1990, Richie made his first terrestrial television appearances as one of the comics on the BBC One sketch show &quot;Up to Something!&quot; with Suzy Aitchison, David Schneider, Frances Dodge, Mike Hayley and Lewis MacLeod; however, the show was axed after one series. Richie was one of five comics, along with Maddi Cryer, Annette Law, George Marshall and Billy Pearce.

Richie later branched out into hosting game shows after proving successful as host of the children&#x27;s quiz show &quot;Run the Risk&quot;, which was played during the BBC Saturday morning show &quot;Going Live!&quot;. He moved into mainstream presenting with &quot;Caught in the Act&quot;, &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;, &quot;The Shane Richie Experience&quot; (later revamped as &quot;Love Me Do&quot;) and &quot;Lucky Numbers&quot;. He also replaced Danny Baker in the &#x27;doorstep challenge&#x27; TV ads for Daz detergent; he had previously replaced Baker as host of &quot;Win, Lose or Draw&quot;. In the 2012 Christmas episode of &quot;The Sarah Millican Television Programme&quot;, Richie said that Daz gave him so much money for doing the adverts that he would have &quot;snorted the stuff&quot; if they had asked him.

==Career==

===Musicals and music career===
Richie has had success in musicals, appearing in such musicals as &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; and the 1993 London revival production of &quot;Grease&quot;. He released two albums, &quot;The Album&quot; in 1997, and &quot;Once Around the Sun&quot; in 2000, to limited commercial response. Richie had a number 2 hit in the UK Singles Chart in 2003, with his &quot;Children in Need&quot; cover version of Wham!&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;m Your Man&quot;.

Over Christmas 2005, Richie appeared in a touring run of &quot;Scrooge: The Musical&quot;.

In 2009, Richie was reportedly scheduled as the opening act for Michael Jackson&#x27;s concerts at The O2 Arena. The concerts were cancelled following Jackson&#x27;s death.

During Christmas 2009, 2013 and 2014, Richie appeared as Aladdin, Buttons and Dick Whittington, in the pantomimes &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Dick Whittington&quot; at the Wycombe Swan Theatre in High Wycombe.

In 2017, Richie signed with East West Records and released his debut country music album, &quot;A Country Soul&quot; on 10 November 2017, which featured songs co-written by his son, Rixton member Jake Roche.

===Television===
Richie was a regular co-host alongside Derek Jameson on &quot;Jameson Tonight&quot;, an early Sky One talk show in 1990.

In 1995, Richie began hosting the game show &quot;Lucky Numbers&quot; and starred in &quot;The Shane Richie Experience&quot; (1995–1996).

From 2002 to 2003, Richie played the villainous Danny Dexter on &quot;Night and Day&quot;. He won supporting roles in low-profile British films, beginning with &quot;Chris Barfoot&quot;&#x27;s award-winning short comedy movie &quot;Dead Clean&quot; and then later &quot;Distant Shadow&quot;. In 2003, Richie was executive producer for the British film &quot;Shoreditch&quot;, in which he also appeared in a lead role. He invested a six-figure sum into the budget of the film, which ultimately made little profit.

In 2007, Richie starred in ITV drama &quot;The Good Samaritan&quot;, and &quot;Father Frank&quot; for BBC One. He also starred in the second series of &quot;Skins&quot; on Channel 4 as Bruce Gelcart, a lecherous college drama lecturer.

On 11 May 2008, Richie hosted a quiz show on Sky One called &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics!&quot;, whereby contestants must finish off the lyrics to lines of popular songs in order to win money.

On 25 April 2008, he was due to be a guest on &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;, but due to Paul O&#x27;Grady falling ill, Richie stood in as host.

In February 2009, Richie starred in a revamp of the series &quot;Minder&quot; on Channel 5. Rather than a remake of the original, Richie starred as Archie Daley, the nephew of the character Arthur Daley from the original series, which ran from 1979 to 1994 on ITV.

On 26 July 2009, Richie appeared in a one-off television drama called &quot;Whatever It Takes&quot; playing a character called JJ Merrick who comes to the aid of a girl who wins a radio competition – and catapults her into stardom, thus giving her a new lease of life.

The BBC announced on 14 November 2011 that following Jimmy Savile&#x27;s recent death, &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot; would return for a one-off Christmas Special in December 2011, with Richie as host.

In January 2014, Richie presented one series of the BBC One game show &quot;Reflex&quot;, made by Objective Productions. In December 2014, Richie began hosting &quot;The National Lottery: Win Your Wish List&quot;, a new Saturday night game show. A second series began airing in February 2016.

Richie has guest-hosted numerous episodes of &quot;The One Show&quot;. Between 2015 and 2016, Richie presented the BBC One daytime game show &quot;Decimate&quot;.

In June 2015, it was announced that he would be appearing in an episode of &quot;Benidorm&quot;.

In 2019, Richie filmed &quot;Caravanning With Shane Richie&quot; for Channel 5.

In November 2020, it was announced that Richie would appear on the twentieth series of &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here&quot;. He finished in fourth place.

===&quot;EastEnders&quot;===

In 2002, Richie joined the cast of &quot;EastEnders&quot; as Alfie Moon, a humorous character in a programme which had been criticised for being too depressing. The role won him numerous awards, including the award for Best Male European Actor at the Rose d&#x27;Or festival and National Television Awards for Most Popular Actor in 2005, shortly before he and co-star Jessie Wallace left the programme on Christmas Day in 2005.

On 8 May 2008, he said in an interview with Digital Spy that he would love to return to &quot;EastEnders&quot;.

On 23 July 2009, Richie announced on &quot;The One Show&quot; that his character Alfie Moon would return to &quot;EastEnders&quot;. Following an absence of almost five years, Richie made his on-screen return to &quot;EastEnders&quot; on 21 September 2010.

As well as appearing in &quot;EastEnders&quot;, Richie also narrated three episodes for the documentary series &quot;EastEnders Revealed&quot;, a series that goes behind the scenes to explore characters and storylines; the episodes were &quot;The Secret Mitchell&quot; (2009) about Ronnie Mitchell and Danielle Jones, &quot;Peggy Mitchell – Queen of the Vic&quot; (2010) about Peggy Mitchell, and &quot;Farewell Pat&quot; (2012) about Pat Evans.

On 4 April 2015, it was announced that Richie would appear alongside Jessie Wallace in a six-part BBC One drama series, &quot;Redwater&quot;. In the spin-off, Kat and Alfie Moon visited Ireland as they put their past behind them. Speaking about the series, Richie commented: &quot;Both Jessie and I are absolutely thrilled to be given this amazing opportunity. To have a whole drama focussed around Kat and Alfie is a huge honour for us both and we just can&#x27;t wait to start filming.

Richie briefly reprised the role in 2018, with the character leaving once again in early 2019.

In July 2022, it was announced that Richie would reprise the role of Alfie again, returning to the soap in the autumn.

===Film===
In 2003, Richie produced and starred in the film &quot;Shoreditch&quot;, into which he had reportedly invested half a million pounds of his own money. The film received negative reviews and was not widely seen.

In 2006, Richie played a rat named Sid in the Aardman Animation film &quot;Flushed Away&quot;. He was subsequently seen in the UK stage tour of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; as Randle McMurphy, and heard as a presenter on Virgin Radio, where he interviewed Tony Hadley of Spandau Ballet.

===Stage===

In July 2015, it was announced that Richie would star alongside his &quot;EastEnders&quot; co-star Jessie Wallace in &quot;The Perfect Murder&quot; at the Theatre Royal in February 2016.

Since 2016, Richie has appeared in pantomime as Robin Hood.

In 2019, Richie starred as retired drag queen Hugo Battersby/Loco Chanelle in the hit musical &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talking About Jamie&quot; at the Apollo Theatre. He then reprised the role for the 2020 UK tour, running until 2022, despite some Covid interruptions.

==Personal life==
Richie married Coleen Nolan in 1990. Together, they had two sons, Shane Roche Jr. (born 1988) and Jake Roche (born 1992). The couple divorced in 1999. Richie has three children with wife Christie.

In 2003, Richie released his autobiography &quot;Rags to Richie&quot;. In the book, he claims to have had sex with six girls in a chalet during his time as a Pontins Bluecoat, and says that he broke the law by orchestrating ticket touts outside the theatre where he was appearing in &quot;Grease&quot;. Richie also claims to have given free tickets to the touts, who went on to sell them at a large profit for Richie.

===Charity===
Richie is patron of Shinfield Players Theatre, an amateur little theatre in Reading, Berkshire, taking the role from Anton Rodgers who died in 2007. He made his first appearance in the audience on 11 July 2009 for the Youth Group production of &quot;Disco Inferno&quot;.

Richie is patron of the UK&#x27;s Huntington&#x27;s Disease Association. He is also a patron of a charity called Cherry Trees, which provides respite care for children with disabilities.

In 2019, Richie admitted that he had to live in a squat when a job failed to happen. After the squat was raided by police, he ended up homeless and was cautioned by the police for vagrancy. Of the experience, Richie said &quot;What I learnt almost 40 years ago has had, and will always have, a lasting effect on me.&quot;

<doc id="1108048" wikidata="Q157952" url="?curid=1108048" title="Dracaena draco">
<text>Dracaena draco, the Canary Islands dragon tree or drago, is a subtropical tree in the genus &quot;Dracaena&quot;, native to the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Madeira, western Morocco, and possibly introduced into the Azores.

It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1762 as &quot;Asparagus draco&quot;. In 1767 he assigned it to the new genus, &quot;Dracaena&quot;.

A related tree of similar appearance, the Socotra dragon tree &quot;Dracaena cinnabari&quot;, grows on the island of Socotra, Yemen, more than 7000 km from the Canary Islands.

==Description==
&quot;Dracaena draco&quot; is an evergreen long lived tree capable of exceeding in height and having a trunk of or more in circumference, starting with a smooth bark that evolves to a more rough texture as it ages. The &quot;dragon tree&quot; is a Monocot, with a branching growth pattern currently placed in the asparagus family (Asparagaceae, subfamily Nolinoidae). When young it has a single stem. At about 10–15 years of age the stem stops growing and produces a flower spike with white, lily-like perfumed flowers, followed by coral berries. Soon a crown of terminal buds appears and the plant starts branching. Each branch grows for about 10–15 years and re-branches, so that a mature plant has an umbrella-like habit. It grows slowly, requiring about 10 years to reach in height, but at times, grows much faster.

Despite being a monocotyledon, it has annual growth rings. There is considerable genetic variation within the Canary Island dragon trees. The form found on Gran Canaria is now treated as a separate species, &quot;Dracaena tamaranae&quot;, based on differences in flower structure. The form endemic to La Palma, initially branches very low with numerous, nearly vertical branches arranged fastigiately. There is a forest of such trees at Las Tricias, Garafia district, La Palma.

Subspecies:
* &quot;D. draco&quot; subsp. &quot;draco&quot;: Endemic to Madeira and Canary Islands
* &quot;D. draco&quot; subsp. &quot;ajgal&quot; : Endemic to Morocco
* &quot;D. draco&quot; subsp. &quot;caboverdeana&quot; : Endemic to the Cape Verde islands

&quot;Plants of the World Online&quot; considers the Moroccan and Cape Verdean forms to be separate species, &quot;Dracaena ajgal&quot; and &quot;Dracaena caboverdeana&quot;.

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Dracaena draco&quot; is native to Macaronesia and southwest Morocco, where it is commonly cultivated as an ornamental plant. On the Canary and Madeira archipelagos, wild endemic populations today are known only in Tenerife and Madeira after recently going extinct in the wild in Gran Canaria. Wild populations in Morocco extend to the southwest Atlas Mountains. Its origin on the Azores is uncertain but it is thought to result from an introduction made by the Portuguese prior to 1500 with seeds from Madeira and Cape Verde, as some individuals were observed to have similarities with the Cape Verdean subspecies (subsp. &quot;caboverdeana&quot;); there are around 200-300 individuals on remote sites in the island of São Jorge and a few more on other islands and it is unknown if these populations can be considered native or the result of an early introduction.

==Uses==
When the bark or leaves are cut they secrete a reddish resin, one of several sources of substances known as dragon&#x27;s blood. Red resins from this tree contain many mono- and dimeric flavans that contribute to the red color of the resins. Dragon&#x27;s blood has a number of traditional medical uses, although dragon&#x27;s blood obtained from &quot;Dracaena draco&quot; was not known until the 15th century, and analyses suggest that most dragon&#x27;s blood used in art was obtained from species of the genus &quot;Calamus&quot; formerly placed in &quot;Daemonorops&quot;. The primary and secondary plant body are the site of the secretory plant tissues that form dragon&#x27;s blood. These tissues include ground parenchyma cells and cortex cells. Dragon&#x27;s blood from &quot;Dracaena draco&quot; and &quot;Dracaena cinnabari&quot; can be distinguished by differences in 10 compounds and a dominant flavonoid DrC11 missing in &quot;Dracaena draco&quot;.

The Guanches worshiped a specimen in Tenerife, and hollowed its trunk into a small sanctuary. Alexander von Humboldt saw it at the time of his visit. It was tall and in circumference, and was estimated to be 6,000 years old. It was destroyed by a storm in 1868.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Dracaena draco&quot; is cultivated and widely available as an ornamental tree for parks, gardens, and drought tolerant water conserving sustainable landscape projects. It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

In 2017, the city of Angra do Heroísmo (Terceira Island) planted a grove of 200 dragon trees.

The Museum of Wine on Pico Island, Azores, has one of the largest concentrations of this species in Macaronesia, some being more than 100 years old.

==Symbolism==
&quot;Dracaena draco&quot; is the natural symbol of the island of Tenerife, together with the blue chaffinch.

<text>Eibar (, ) is a city and municipality within the province of Gipuzkoa, in the Autonomous Community of Euskadi. It is the capital of the &quot;eskualde / comarca&quot; of Debabarrena.

Eibar has 27,138 inhabitants (Eustat, 2018). Its chief industry is metal manufacturing, and the city has been known since the 16th century for the manufacture of armaments, particularly finely engraved small arms. It was also the home of Serveta scooters.

It is home to the SD Eibar football team.

== Geography ==
Eibar lies at an altitude of 121m above sea level, in the west of the province of Gipuzkoa, very close to Biscay. Eibar has an oceanic climate. The town lies in a narrow valley in a mountainous area, with mountains like Karakate, Kalamua and Akondia being between 700 and 800 metres tall. Eibar is traversed by the river Ego, which is a tributary of the Deba.

Apart from the urban area, the municipality consists of five rural neighbourhoods: Otaola-Kinarraga, Aginaga, Arrate, Mandiola and Gorosta.

== History ==
The city was chartered by Alfonso XI of Castile in 1346, receiving the name of &quot;Villanueva de San Andrés de Heybar&quot;.

The feudal families that dominated the territory engaged in the War of the Bands. Eibar, like the rest of settlements in the valley, had an industry based on finery forges and arms manufacturing. In 1766, Eibar was engaged in a social revolt known as the &quot;Machinada&quot;, and years later, in 1794, it was attacked by the French, who destroyed the town.

In the 19th century, industrialisation transformed the systems of production in the city and spawned a powerful social movement. After the rest of Gipuzkoa sided with the French in 1793 during the French Revolutionary Wars, Eibar temporarily voted to join Biscay. In the Carlist Wars, Eibar sided with the Liberals. The labour movement and socialism became particularly strong in Eibar. In 1931, it was the first city in Spain to proclaim the Second Spanish Republic; in recognition it was given the title of &quot;Very Exemplary City&quot;.

In the Spanish Civil War, Eibar was practically destroyed by Italian bombers aiding the Spanish Nationalists. The subsequent rebuilding brought significant industrial development and a demographic increase, as Eibar&#x27;s population increased to nearly 40,000 within a few years.

Due to the lack of space for expansion, several factories moved to Durangaldea and Álava. The industrial crisis in the 1980s also caused Eibar to lose a great part of its population.

At the beginning of the 21st century, Eibar&#x27;s economy is based on industry and services.

<doc id="1108056" wikidata="Q951064" url="?curid=1108056" title="New Force (Italy)">
<text>New Force (, FN) is an Italian neo-fascist political party. It was founded by Roberto Fiore and Massimo Morsello. The party is a member of the Alliance for Peace and Freedom and was a part of the Social Alternative from 2003 to 2006. The party has often been strongly criticized for its radical positions and for acts of violence involving some militants. It was also the protagonist of political campaigns opposed to same-sex marriage and immigration to Italy.

==History==
New Force was formed within the Tricolour Flame (&quot;Fiamma Tricolore&quot;) and then began the process that led it to become a party. Its founders and financiers were two well-known names from the years of militancy in the lead for the movements of the Roman radical right, and for their neo-fascist political beliefs. The split occurred when Tricolour Flame of Pino Rauti began to oppose the distribution among its members of the bulletin of Roberto Fiore and Massimo Morsello.

In 1980, Fiore and Morsello escaped to London as fugitives after arrest warrants aimed at shedding light on the facts of the massacre at the Bologna railway station. The two were considered unrelated to the massacre, although they belonged, according to the judiciary, to the Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari. They both stayed in England during the first government led by Margaret Thatcher with the status of political refugees for 20 years.

New Force was founded on 29 September 1997 at a meeting in Cave, in the province of Lazio, organized by Francesco Pallottino, leader of a Nazi rock group. It was not a random date because it is the one dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel, a symbol among other things of the Romanian Iron Guard, to which Forza Nuova historically refers. The founders Fiore and Morsello were still fugitives in London and did not return until 1999. Fiore was sentenced by a court to 66 months in prison. Morsello was sentenced to 98 months, although he did not serve them as he was dying from cancer (he died in March 2001).

The national launch of the group was in Latina with a conference in April 1998. Forza Nuova was placed on the political scene with the goal at the local level, to broaden their contacts on concrete campaigns against immigration, abortion, crime, and to hold together the conservative right-wing traditionalist with the social channel blocker.

On 25 March 1999, Massimo Morsello returned to Italy, and so did Roberto Fiore on 21 April of the following year. They were welcomed at the airport by deputies of the National Alliance and Forza Italia such as Francesco Storace, Enzo Fragalà, Alberto Simeone, Carlo Taormina, Ernesto Caccavale and Teodoro Buontempo. In early 2001, the movement could count on 2500 members and forty sections scattered across Italy.
In 2001 general election, New Force gained 13,622 votes at the Chamber of Deputies.
In 2008 general election, the party won 0.30% in the Chamber and 0.26% in the Senate. It has not been elected a parliamentary presented himself in the lists of the party. Following the resignation of mandatory Alessandra Mussolini, elected to the Chamber of Deputies, Roberto Fiore became MEP.

In 2013 general election, New Force got 89,812 votes (0.26%) in the Chamber of Deputies and 81,521 votes in the Senate, failing to elect any candidate but becoming the largest far-right party in Italy.

In 2016, New Force was featured in an episode of &quot;Huang&#x27;s World&quot; on the television channel Viceland. In the episode, the members went out to eat with Eddie Huang, the host, and an apparent local Sicilian walked by and happened to recognize the politicians and yelled at them for their far-right views. It ends with the host and camera crew going to jail because, they claimed, the New Force members had them arrested by the police.

For the 2018 general election New Force joined with Tricolour Flame to form the Italy for the Italians coalition.

In May 2020 an internal party split takes place, dozens of offices throughout Italy leave the party giving life to a new entity called National Movement – The Network of the Patriots in controversy with the management of Fiore and Castellino considered not very transparent and too close to Matteo Salvini as well as aiming exclusively at obtaining media hype. The new political entity is officially founded on 10 October 2020.

On 9 October 2021 New Force militants attacked the Italian General Confederation of Labour&#x27;s headquarters during a protest march against vaccine passports. Party founder and national secretary Roberto Fiore, the chief of the Roman chapter of the party Giuliano Castellino, the former NAR terrorist Luigi Aronica and other party members were arrested in the aftermath of the attack.

On 11 October 2021 the Public Prosecutor&#x27;s Office at the Court of Rome imposed a block on the party&#x27;s website.

==Presence outside Italy==
Forza Nuova has longstanding ties to other European far-right organization, including the British National Party. Forza Nuova leader Roberto Fiore was once closely allied with the Ukrainian far-right Svoboda party, but following the beginning of the Russo-Ukrainian War, Forza Nuova and Fiore &quot;made a considerable shift to the pro-Russian camp.&quot; According to the Political Capital Institute, a Hungarian think tank, Forza Nuova is one of a number of Russian-backed radical right political parties in Europe.

In 2016, a Forza Nuova affiliate continued attempts to recruit members in the United States. The group established Forza Nuova—USA chapters in New Jersey (Forza Nuova—USA&#x27;s headquarters) and Phoenix, Arizona.

In 2018, Forza Nuova joined forces with Polish ultra-right organization National Radical Camp to &quot;patrol&quot; the beaches of Italian Romagna Riviera.

==Political platform==

The political movement claims to aim for &quot;national reconstruction&quot; by achieving eleven objectives:

* The repeal of abortion law.
* A social policy that encourages population growth and the traditional family.
* Opposition to immigration and the humane repatriation of recent immigrants to Italy.
* The fight against the Mafia, the banning of Freemasonry and all secret societies, together with exit from NATO and removal from the U.S. sphere of influence.
* The fight against usury and writing off of public debt, as well as the abolition of capitalism.
* The restoration of the 1929 agreement between the State and the Church and the defence of national identity.
* The repeal of the Mancino and Scelba laws, which the Forza Nuova believes destroy freedom.
* The formation of guilds for the protection of workers.
* Laws to eliminate seigniorage banking income and for the state to issue currency; complementary currencies for local trade, and the nationalization of the following sectors: health, the central bank, commercial banks and strategic industries
* The &quot;recovery of Christian religiosity&quot; and of &quot;faith in the Catholic Church&quot;.

New Force is also characterized by Euroscepticism; Roberto Fiore, FN leader, stated that he wanted to oppose &quot;with all possible legal means&quot; the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. As the Russo-Ukrainian War began, the party started supporting Russia, although it had previously enjoyed relations with Ukrainian far-right groups. This has created a disunity with CasaPound, which is pro-Ukraine. According to the Italian edition of the &quot;HuffPost&quot;, members of New Force went to fight in Ukraine for Russia, among them Andrea Palmeri, enlisted in the separatist forces in Donbas. 

Regarding the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, New Force is pro-Palestine and are accused of supporting extremist groups like Hamas (views that are shared among the Italian neo-fascist groups). After 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, New Force led by Roberto Fiore organized demonstrations in support of &quot;Palestinian resistance&quot;.

==Symbolism==

=== Symbols ===
New logo introduced in 2021, depicting a swallow, refers to the logo of Ala Littoria, national airline from 1934 to 1945.

=== Association with white shirts ===
During 2014 anti-immigration demonstrations, the party members wore white shirts. According to Italian journalist Fabio Spaterna, the use of white shirts symbolizes their &quot;anti-immigrant instances&quot;. In addition to this distinctive clothing the &quot;forzanovisti&quot; () have flown the flag of the Russian Federation. New Force leader Roberto Fiore justified the Russian flag presence by affirming: &quot;Irony of history, Putin is the only one who represents our values today&quot;.

<text>Merville Garden Village is a housing estate located at Shore Road, Drumnadrough, Newtownabbey, County Antrim, Northern Ireland created by structural and landscape architect Edward Prentice Mawson. It was completed in 1949.

==Historical background==
Merville was originally a private house, the modern-day Merville House, and estate built in 1795 by the Belfast banker and merchant John Brown (c.1740–1808). It was intended as his country retreat. Other fêted people would come to reside at the sprawling 24-acre shoreline manor. Between 1849–1887, for example, it was the home of Sir Edward Coey (1805–1887), noted as the first and only Liberal Party Mayor of Belfast (1861) and prominent wealthy businessman, who helped make Belfast one of the most prosperous manufacturing centres in the world during the 19th century.

During WWII little to no houses were built and Belfast was becoming densely populated. So in 1947-49 the Garden Village, the first such housing development in Ireland, was constructed. It was the idea of Lurgan-born builder Thomas McGrath who had established his company, Ulster Garden Villages Limited, in January 1946. Thomas Arlow McGrath was born into a working-class family in Lurgan in 1896. Having trained initially as a cabinet maker, and following service in the First World War, he formed a successful building business with his carpenter brothers, Andy and Bob. McGrath was an admirer of the Garden Village movement which had developed in England, listing notable examples of the work of various housing societies such as Bourneville and Letchworth, and commenting: “An important part of the policy of the housing society movement is that of giving every attention not only to the welfare of its estates, and care in the maintenance of its properties but to the welfare of tenants.”. 

English architect Edward Prentice Mawson, eldest son of internationally renowned English landscape architect Thomas Hayton Mawson, became known to McGrath after being introduced to him by his site manager Jesse Williams, who previously worked with Mawson in England. Edward Prentice Mawson was the past President of the Institute of Landscape Architects, having originally trained at the London School of Architecture and at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris. Mawson&#x27;s philosophical approach to planning had a sound commercial basis and dovetailed well with that of McGrath: &quot;Good design and beauty are commercial assets, quite apart from their psychological effect on everyone.&quot;(Mawson, 1934). Subsequently, Mawson was appointed the consultant architect of all of McGrath&#x27;s ambitious Garden Village schemes in Northern Ireland. Along with Merville, these were at Abbots Cross, Fernagh, Prince&#x27;s Park, King&#x27;s Park, Muckamore, and Whitehead, all in County Antrim. 

The Merville original designs consisted of 256 apartments, 28 cottage flats, 146 terraced and semi-detached houses, and a row of 14 shops. The building work was completed in 1949. 

The design of Merville was widely praised: Stanley Gale noted in 1949: “In the Merville Estate in Belfast, the designer Mr E. Prentice Mawson has produced an outstanding example that should set a new standard in both layout and in the grouping and design of the units.” The estate was endowed with shops and a community centre (having classes in drama, singing, music and other activities). There was also a small theatre, and landscaped gardens included the original walled garden of Merville House, as well as various landscape features such as field boundary fragments. Merville Garden Village was designated a conservation area in 1995. 

The original intention to form a strong sense of home and community became a deep psychological seed within the minds of those who lived there. By 1975 The Merville Garden Village Residents Association was formally constituted, having 249 subscribing households, and is considered one of the oldest resident associations in Northern Ireland today.

==Conservation Area designation==
Merville Garden Village was designated a conservation area on 23 June 1995 because of its unique architecture and landscape and is the only neighbourhood in the borough of Newtownabbey to have this protection.

==Merville House restoration==
In April 2000 Patricia Pepper, Jackie Thompson and Brian McNally began the restoration of Merville House when they met Belfast Regeneration Office officials, amongst others. The meeting with potential funders was initiated by local North Belfast MLA Fred Cobain after a chance meeting with MRA committee member Barbara McPhee. However, Stephen Hamilton, another Merville resident, joined the committee and formally set up &quot;Merville House Limited&quot; in February 2002 to help garner funding for the project. Other key players in the Merville House team included the late Jacqui Thompson, and Carol Magill and Colin Simms who assisted with grant applications. Carol Magill was Chair of Merville House and with her husband Colin and Patricia presented and secured the £1.2m funds for the restoration. The scheme was ultimately funded by Ulster Garden Villages Limited, International Fund for Ireland, Newtownabbey Borough Council, Newtownabbey Local Strategy Partnership and Belfast Local Strategy Partnership and a private donor. The house was officially re-opened on 27 April 2006 by Baroness Blood, a well-known community activist in west Belfast. Today Merville House is utilised by the whole community.

==60th anniversary celebration==
On 25 September 2009 a celebration was organised by &quot;Merville Residents&#x27; Association&quot; to mark the 60th anniversary of the completion of the village with guest of honour Thomas Prentice Mawson, the son of Edward Prentice Mawson. Thomas was a member of the original Merville design team led by his father. Other dignitaries at the event included incumbent Alderman John Scott, Mayor of Newtownabbey, and Tony Hopkins CBE, the head of Ulster Garden Villages Limited.

Vizrt&#x27;s usual customer base is composed of broadcasters and publishing houses. Vizrt is a privately owned company by Nordic Capital Fund VIII.

==History==
TV 2 Norway needed a solution for creating graphics in the newsroom for journalists. A spin-off company called Pilot Broadcast Systems AS was established in 1997, where the first template-based graphics system was created.

In 1999, Norway-based Pilot Broadcast Systems AS merged with the Austrian company, Peak Software Technologies GmbH (founded by Christian Huber, Karl-Heinz Klotz and Hubert Oehm), to form Peak Broadcast Systems. Peak Software was a developer of software for real-time 3D graphics and animation, virtual sets and playback control systems. The business fusion Peak Broadcast Systems, could now offer software for real-time 3D graphics creation and virtual sets, together with playout control.

The following year marked the formation of Vizrt when Peak Broadcast Systems merged with RT-SET (Real Time Synthesized Entertainment Technology) Ltd, an Israeli virtual studio system developer. RT-SET, founded in 1994, utilized Flight Simulator technology originally developed for the Israeli Air Force, transforming it to a virtual set and on-air graphics systems that could benefit the television broadcast industry. In 1999, RT-SET had an initial public offering on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, raising $48 million. The combined company continued to be listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange (under ticker symbol VIZ), until 2009 when it delisted its shares.

In 2005, the company acquired London-based Curious Software, developers of 2D and 3D animated maps for broadcast television, corporate presentations and online applications. The same year Vizrt listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange

Later in 2005, Vizrt acquired 19 percent of Adactus AS, a Norwegian company specializing in the transportation of content to mobile phone platforms. Together, Vizrt and Adactus developed Viz 3G, a graphics engine for mobile telephones and other mobile devices. Based on Vizrt&#x27;s Viz Engine renderer and Adactus&#x27; MPEG-21 standards-based multimedia delivery platform, it was the first integration of a graphics engine for mobile phone video viewing applications. Vizrt acquired the rest of the shares in the company in 2010.

In 2006, Vizrt acquired Ardendo, a digital asset management company serving the television broadcast industry, based in Sweden.

In 2008, Vizrt acquired Escenic, a Norwegian developer of content management software for digital media publishing. Escenic technologies are used by many news media websites, including &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, the Times Online, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, and Welt Online.

In October 2010, Vizrt formalized its strategic collaboration with Stergen Hi-Tech Ltd. Stergen develops 2D to 3D video conversion technologies for the TV sports market.

In November 2010, Vizrt entered into a terms sheet with Swiss company LiberoVision AG, a developer of virtual sports enhancements. Vizrt fully acquired LiberoVision in 2012. Liberovision was then rebranded to Viz Libero. The CEP of LiberoVision, Stephan Würmlin Stadler, was appointed EVP Sports, managing Vizrt&#x27;s sports production tools.

On November 13, 2013, Vizrt announced plans to sell its online production tools, formerly Escenic, to CCI of Denmark. As of January 7, 2014, Vizrt has completed sale of 75.5 percent of Escenic&#x27;s outstanding share capital.

On the same day, November 13, 2013, Vizrt announced intentions to acquire Mosart Medialab from TV 2 Norway. The acquisition brought the Mosart control room automation system into the Vizrt product line. The system was renamed Viz Mosart and facilitated the creation of the Viz Opus control room in a box system.

On 10 November 2014, the company entered into a merger agreement with Nordic Capital. The merger was approved by an extraordinary general meeting of the company on 18 December 2014. On 19 March 2015, it was announced that all pre-closing conditions set out in the merger agreement had been fulfilled, and the merger was subsequently consummated on 19 March 2015. The acquisition removed Vizrt from the Oslo stock exchange.

In May 2019, Vizrt acquired all shares of the company NewTek for a sum of 95.25 million, disclosed in their Q2 report.

==Noteworthy events==
Vizrt&#x27;s Viz Virtual Studio software and Viz Engine renderer were an integral part of the success of the first remote “holographic” live interviews conducted by CNN during the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Tracking data from the cameras in CNN&#x27;s Election Center was processed by Viz Virtual Studio software. From the images captured, a specially developed Viz Engine plug-in, created a full 3D representation of the person. CNN also uses Vizrt for its award-winning MAM system, for broadcast graphics and for streaming to mobile.

Also in 2008, Vizrt technology powered a play-along version of “Who Wants to Be A Millionaire,” which aired on TV2 Norway. The show featured web-interactive elements. Viz Multi Platform Suite delivered real-time 3D graphics to the show&#x27;s online participants. PGA Tour Productions selected Viz Ardome media asset management software to manage its HD and SD content in 2009.
Also in 2009, ZDF (Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen), one of two large public broadcasters in Germany began broadcasting from two virtual studios using Viz Virtual Studio and broadcast graphics solutions from Vizrt. ZDF now broadcasts from Europe&#x27;s largest and most advanced virtual studio.

In 2010, GMA Network, a major broadcast network in the Philippines also selected Vizrt technology to provide graphical reports like that of CNN for the coverage of the Philippine national elections, in which they teamed up with Google, it was continued from 2013 onwards.

In 2011, Escenic and Sveriges Television (SVT) demonstrated the world&#x27;s first professional website using on responsive design in the Escenic Content Engine.

In 2012, Vizrt provided graphic, video and online tools for three major events; the London Olympic Games, Euro2012 and the U.S. Presidential Election. For the U.S. Presidential Election, Vizrt graphics and video tools were used by almost all of the major U.S. broadcasters including ABC, CBS, Fox News, CNN, Univision. Global Broadcasters using Vizrt to cover the election included BBC, Sky News, CBC, Al Jazeera and many others.

In 2014, Vizrt provided virtual graphics and on-air graphics for Fox Sport&#x27;s coverage of the Super Bowl and Daytona 500. Vizrt also provided graphics systems for the Olympics in Sochi for customers such as TV 2 Norway, Viasat in Sweden and Sky Italia as well as provided Viz World customers access to satellite imagery that were continuously being collected during the games.

Warren is a poet, and the author of two books, including &quot;Mi Base side orn Pitcairn&quot; (&quot;My Favourite Place on Pitcairn&quot;), written with children on Pitcairn Island. It is the first book written and published in Pitkern and English.

Her works include a cookbook, &quot;Taste of Pitcairn&quot; featuring the cuisine of the Pitcairn Islands, and poetry in both Pitkern and English.

In 2007, Warren revived Pitcairn&#x27;s tradition of art created on tapa cloth, a woven bark cloth common in Polynesian culture. Her works have been displayed in museums and galleries in Tahiti, Norfolk Island, and New Zealand. In 2011, she was one of seven artists awarded a Commonwealth Connections International Arts Residency, which provided a grant of £8,000 that allowed her to work with other artists in New Zealand. She is the first recipient from the Pitcairn Islands.

Pitcairn has a small population. The island&#x27;s 48 residents often serve in several capacities or jobs. Warren describes her many roles on her personal website:

Travelling with patients to New Zealand and Tahiti and taking up Nursing, Radio Operator for the shore to ship skeds from ZBP station and twice daily contact with Auckland international Radio telephone link, Working in our Co-op store, Council member for many years as well as being the Governors appointee member to council a few times, Becoming the first female Police &amp; Immigration Officer for a few years. Lands Commission president, Lands court member, Bee keeper since 1978. ASL operator for siesmic Vault, Installing wireless networking throughout Adamstown, Duncan cleaner, Contract Lawnmowing jobs, and many misc jobs inc Tourism and Entertainment. PHEWWwww. it became apparent to me that what I enjoy most is my art. (T)his is getting pushed aside whilst I am working these time consuming no pay or low paid positions which was making me very tired and yes. ... Bitchy

Beginning in 1996, Warren served as the island&#x27;s only police officer. However, since no one had been arrested on the island since the 1950s, her duties involved issuing driving licences and stamping visitors&#x27; passports. Warren had no qualifications or formal training to be a police officer, and was given the job because everyone on the island had a &quot;job&quot;. The island&#x27;s jail was described as &quot;the size of a garden shed and riddled with termites&quot;, and its cells had been used to store building materials and lifejackets. When the island came into the international spotlight due to a sexual abuse scandal, a law enforcement professional sent to the island criticized their practices, stating &quot;It was glaringly obvious ... that their standard of policing was not really adequate.&quot;

Warren was elected on 15 December 2004 to the Island Council. As a radio operator, she broadcasts under the call sign VP6MW.

===Pitcairn&#x27;s sexual abuse trial===

Warren was an outspoken critic of accusations that the island&#x27;s girls had been sexually abused when young, and the prosecution of a selected number of Pitcairn&#x27;s male residents. She claimed that young girls on Pitcairn customarily became sexually active after age 12, a practice of underage sex that had been accepted as a Polynesian tradition since the settlement of the island in 1790. One resident, Olive Christian, said of her girlhood, &quot;We all thought sex was like food on the table.&quot;

Many Pitcairn Island men blamed the British police for persuading the women involved to press charges. Some of the women agreed, and advocated a conspiracy theory that the trial was, in Warren&#x27;s words, &quot;a British plot to jail the [community&#x27;s] able-bodied men and &#x27;close&#x27; the island&quot;, and that the British officials &quot;picked on all the viable young men, the ones who are the backbone of this place&quot;.

A majority of the island&#x27;s residents denied or excused the allegations. During the trial, Warren circulated a poem titled &quot;Is Seven a Lucky Number?&quot; that criticized the British government and lawyers&#x27; attempts to impose British law against their island&#x27;s traditions.

&lt;poem&gt;&quot;There&#x27;s never an age consent set in our Laws
Oh 16 is in the British clause
What book they choose
What next law will they ruse
Why must these Seven men be used&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

As the case wore on, Warren reflected that &quot;the bottom had fallen out of our world ... We lost our trust for each other.&quot; Her brother, Jay Warren, who was accused of &quot;indecent assault&quot;, was the only defendant among the seven accused to be acquitted on 24 October 2004.

Warren was convicted of assault during a drunken disagreement with another resident when the two were angered by tensions over the sexual abuse matter. The case was prosecuted by a Crown prosecutor and tried by a New Zealand magistrate. Warren was fined NZ$60. The case cost the British government NZ$40,000 to prosecute.

<text>Nouvelle cuisine (; &#x27;new cuisine&#x27;) is an approach to cooking and food presentation in French cuisine. In contrast to &quot;cuisine classique&quot;, an older form of &quot;haute cuisine&quot;, nouvelle cuisine is characterized by lighter, more delicate dishes and an increased emphasis on presentation. It was popularized in the 1960s by the food critic Henri Gault, who coined the phrase, and his colleagues André Gayot and Christian Millau in a new restaurant guide, the Gault Millau, or &quot;Le Nouveau Guide&quot;.

==History==

The term &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; has been used several times in the history of French cuisine, to mark a clean break with the past.

In the 1730s and 1740s, several French writers emphasized their break with tradition, calling their cooking &quot;modern&quot; or &quot;new&quot;. Vincent La Chapelle published his &quot;Cuisinier moderne&quot; in 1733–1735. The first volumes of Menon&#x27;s &quot;Nouveau traité de la cuisine&quot; was published in 1739. It was in 1742 that Menon introduced the term &quot;nouvelle cuisine&quot; as the title of the third volume of his &quot;Nouveau traité&quot;. François Marin worked in the same tradition.

In the 1880s and 1890s, the cooking of Georges Auguste Escoffier was sometimes described with the term.
The modern usage is variously attributed to authors Henri Gault, Christian Millau, and André Gayot, who used nouvelle cuisine to describe the cooking of Paul Bocuse, Alain Chapel, Jean and Pierre Troisgros, Michel Guérard, Roger Vergé, and Raymond Oliver, many of whom were once students of Fernand Point. Paul Bocuse claimed that Gault first used the term to describe food prepared by Bocuse and other top chefs for the maiden flight of the Concorde airliner in 1969.

The style Gault and Millau wrote about was a reaction to the French &quot;cuisine classique&quot; placed into &quot;orthodoxy&quot; by Escoffier. Calling for greater simplicity and elegance in creating dishes, nouvelle cuisine is not &quot;cuisine minceur&quot; (&#x27;thin cooking&#x27;), which was created by Michel Guérard as spa food. It has been speculated that the outbreak of World War II was a significant contributor to nouvelle cuisine&#x27;s creation—the short supply of animal protein during the German occupation made it a natural development.

==The &quot;formula&quot;==

Gault and Millau discovered the &quot;formula&quot; contained in ten characteristics of this new style of cooking. The ten characteristics identified were:
*A rejection of excessive complication in cooking.
*Cooking times for most fish, seafood, game birds, veal, green vegetables, and pâtés were greatly reduced in an attempt to preserve their natural flavours. Steaming was an important trend from this characteristic.
*The cuisine was made with the freshest possible ingredients.
*Large menus were abandoned in favour of shorter menus.
*Strong marinades for meat and game ceased to be used.
*Heavy sauces such as &quot;espagnole&quot; and béchamel were replaced by seasonings with fresh herbs, high-quality butter, lemon juice, and vinegar.
*Regional dishes replaced &quot;cuisine classique&quot; as a source of inspiration.
*New techniques were embraced and modern equipment was often used; Bocuse even used microwave ovens.
*The chefs paid close attention to the dietary needs of their guests through their dishes.
*The chefs were extremely inventive and created new combinations and pairings.

==Abandonment==
There is a standing debate as to whether nouvelle cuisine has been abandoned. Much of what it stood for—particularly its preference for lightly presented, fresh flavours—has been assimilated into mainstream restaurant cooking. By the mid-1980s, some food writers stated that the style of cuisine had reached exhaustion and many chefs began returning to the &quot;cuisine classique&quot; style of cooking, although much of the lighter presentations and new techniques remained.

<text>Sir John Schorne (died 1313) was rector of North Marston in the English county of Buckinghamshire. He was a very pious man and was said to have effected many miraculous cures for gout and toothaches.

During a drought, he discovered a well, whose waters were reputed to have miraculous properties. His reputation for holiness was such that he is believed to have cast the devil into a boot. He is often pictured holding a boot with a devil in it, which was thought to be the origin of the children&#x27;s jack-in-the-box toy. However, the toy did not come about until over 500 years after Schorne&#x27;s time. 
When he died, his shrine in the church at North Marston became a popular place of pilgrimage and he was regarded by many as a saint, although he was never canonised. His remains were later moved to St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor, the burial place of English monarchs. Henry VIII, who was buried there, went on pilgrimage to Schorne&#x27;s Well in July 1511 and May 1521. The Holy Well was renovated in 2004/2005 and may still be seen in North Marston.

There was a rector in Princes Risborough in Buckinghamshire called John de Schorne, &quot;circa&quot; 1289, according to the list of rectors in the front of the parish register. It is likely to be the same person, though this is difficult to confirm for certain.

One of the two team benefices in Claydon Deanery is named after Schorne to this day.

<doc id="1108071" wikidata="Q453384" url="?curid=1108071" title="Janet Flanner">
<text>Janet Flanner (March 13, 1892 – November 7, 1978) was an American writer and pioneering narrative journalist who served as the Paris correspondent of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; magazine from 1925 until she retired in 1975. She wrote under the pen name &quot;Genêt&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost-1979/11/18&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; She also published a single novel, &quot;The Cubical City&quot;, set in New York City.

She was a prominent member of America&#x27;s expatriate community living in Paris before WWII. Along with her longtime partner Solita Solano, Flanner was called &quot;a defining force in the creative expat scene in Paris&quot;. She returned to New York during the war. Flanner split her time between there and Paris until her death in 1978.

==Early life==
Janet Flanner was born in Indianapolis, Indiana, to Frank and Mary Ellen Flanner (née Hockett), who were Quakers. She had two sisters, Marie and Hildegarde Flanner. Her father co-owned a mortuary and ran the first crematorium in the state of Indiana. After a period spent traveling abroad with her family and studies at Tudor Hall School for Girls (now Park Tudor School), she enrolled in the University of Chicago in 1912. She left the university in 1914. Two years later, she returned to her native city to take up a post as the first cinema critic on the local paper, the &quot;Indianapolis Star&quot;.

==Expatriate in Paris==
While in New York, Flanner moved in the circle of the Algonquin Round Table, but was not a member. She also met the couple Jane Grant and Harold Ross, through painter Neysa McMein. It was based on this connection that Harold Ross offered Flanner the position of French Correspondent to &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

After these early years spent in Pennsylvania and New York in her mid twenties, Flanner left the United States for Paris.

In September 1925 Flanner published her first &quot;Letter from Paris&quot; in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, which had been launched the previous February. She would be professionally linked with the magazine for the next five decades. Her columns covered a wide range of topics, including artists, performances, and crime, including a lengthy feature on murderesses Christine and Léa Papin. She also published several installments about the Stavisky Affair. Flanner was also known for her obituaries—examples include those of Isadora Duncan and Edith Wharton.

Flanner had first come to the attention of editor Harold Ross through his first wife, Jane Grant, who was a friend of Flanner&#x27;s from the Lucy Stone League. This organization fought for women to preserve their maiden names after marriage, in the manner of Lucy Stone. Flanner joined the group in 1921. Ross famously thought Flanner&#x27;s pen name &quot;Genêt&quot; was French for &quot;Janet&quot;.

Flanner wrote one novel, &quot;The Cubical City&quot; (1926), which achieved little success.

Flanner was a prominent member of the American expatriate community in Paris which included Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, E. E. Cummings, Hart Crane, Djuna Barnes, Ezra Pound, and Gertrude Stein - the world of the Lost Generation and &quot;Les Deux Magots&quot;. While in Paris she became very close friends with Gertrude Stein and her lover, Alice B. Toklas.

She played a crucial role in introducing her contemporaries to new artists in Paris, including Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque, Henri Matisse, André Gide, and Jean Cocteau, and the Ballets Russes dance company. She also introduced them to crime passionel and vernissage, the triumphant crossing of the Atlantic Ocean by pilot Charles Lindbergh and the depravities of the Stavisky Affair.

Her prose style has since come to epitomise the &quot;&quot;New Yorker&quot; style&quot;—its influence can be seen decades later in the prose of Bruce Chatwin. An example: &quot;The late Jean De Koven was an average American tourist in Paris but for two exceptions: she never set foot in the Opéra, and she was murdered.&quot;

==War correspondent==
Her &quot;New Yorker&quot; work during World War II included not only her famous &quot;Letter from Paris&quot; columns, but also included a seminal 3-part series in 1936 profiling Hitler.

After Hitler invaded Poland on September 1, 1939, Flanner moved back to New York City, where she lived with Natalia Danesi Murray and her son William Murray. She still wrote for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, analyzing radio broadcasts and print reports about life in wartime Paris. She returned to Paris in 1944, contributing a series of weekly radio broadcasts entitled &quot;Listen: the Women&quot; for the Blue Network during the months following the liberation of Paris in late August 1944.

Flanner covered the Nuremberg trials (1945) for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;.

== Post-war ==
She covered the Suez crisis, the Soviet invasion of Hungary, and the strife in Algeria which helped the rise of Charles de Gaulle.

==Awards and recognitions==
In 1948, Flanner was made a knight of Legion d&#x27;Honneur.

In 1958, Flanner was awarded an honorary doctorate by Smith College.

In 1966 she won the U.S. National Book Award in the Arts and Letters category for her &quot;Paris Journal, 1944–1965&quot;. Extracts of her &quot;Paris Journal&quot; were adapted as a piece for chorus and orchestra by composer Ned Rorem.

In 2019, Park Tudor School — the coed successor to the Tudor Hall for Girls (Flanner&#x27;s alma mater) — posthumously awarded her their prestigious &quot;distinguished alumni award&quot;. The school&#x27;s fine arts department created a speaker series in her name, titled the &quot;Janet Flanner Visiting Artist Series&quot;.

==Marriage and personal life==
In 1918, Flanner married William &quot;Lane&quot; Rehm, a friend she had met while at the University of Chicago. He was working as an artist in New York City, and she later admitted that she married him to get out of Indianapolis. The marriage lasted for only a few years and they divorced amicably in 1926. Rehm was supportive of Flanner&#x27;s career until his death.

In 1918, the same year she married her husband, she met Solita Solano in Greenwich Village. The two women became lifelong lovers, although both also became involved with other lovers throughout their relationship. Solano was drama editor for the &quot;New-York Tribune&quot;, and also wrote for &quot;National Geographic&quot;.

In 1932 Flanner fell in love with Noël Haskins Murphy, an American singer who lived in a village just outside Paris. They had a short-lived romance. This did not affect her relationship with Solano.

Flanner lived in Paris with Solano, who put away her own literary aspirations to be Flanner&#x27;s personal secretary. They lived together for more than 50 years, but their relationship was not monogamous. In 1940, Flanner met Natalia Danesi Murray; their romance lasted until Flanner&#x27;s death in 1978, though Flanner always had several relationships at a time. &quot;You complain that I have three wives and the truth is, as you know, that I also have a husband, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;,&quot; Flanner once wrote to Murray.

Flanner frequently visited Los Angeles, where her mother Mary Flanner lived at 530 East Marigold St. in Altadena with her sister, poet Hildegarde Flanner, and brother-in-law, Frederick Monhoff.

Flanner was a chain smoker.

In 1975, she returned to New York City permanently, to be cared for by Murray. Flanner died on November 7, 1978. She was cremated. Her ashes were scattered along with Murray&#x27;s over Cherry Grove in Fire Island where the two women had met in 1940, according to William Murray, Danesi Murray&#x27;s son, in his book &quot;Janet, My Mother, and Me&quot; (2000).

== In popular culture ==
* Solita Solano and Flanner are portrayed as &quot;Nip&quot; and &quot;Tuck&quot; in the 1928 novel &quot;Ladies Almanack&quot;, by Djuna Barnes, a &quot;roman à clef&quot; about the amorous intrigues of the lesbian network centered in Natalie Clifford Barney&#x27;s salon in Paris.
*Flanner is among the journalists cited as inspirations for the 2021 Wes Anderson film &quot;The French Dispatch&quot;.
*Flanner is briefly mentioned in Season 1 Episode 4 of Fran Lebowitz&#x27; Netflix series &quot;Pretend It&#x27;s a City&quot;.
*In 1971, Flanner was the third guest during an infamous verbal scuffle between Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;. In the course of trading insults with both fellow guests and their host, Mailer asked her to stop &quot;muttering in the corner&quot;, and Flanner accused both Vidal and (particularly) Mailer of acting as if they were having a private conversation amongst themselves, while ignoring that there were other people at (and on) the show. Mailer asked her twice if she was &quot;working as the referee or as Mr. Vidal&#x27;s manager&quot;.

<text>Snowed In is the first Christmas album by American pop rock group Hanson. It was quickly released following the success of their previous album, &quot;Middle of Nowhere&quot;, and was recorded in London. &quot;Snowed In&quot; was also the best-selling holiday album for 1997 in the United States, selling 863,000 copies that year according to Nielsen SoundScan. It has since sold a total of 1,081,000 copies in the US.

The album features a mix of traditional Christmas carols (such as &quot;Silent Night Medley&quot;), covers of Christmas themed songs (such as &quot;Rockin&#x27; Around the Christmas Tree&quot; and &quot;Merry Christmas, Baby&quot;) and Hanson&#x27;s own compositions (such as &quot;At Christmas&quot; and &quot;Christmas Time&quot;).

==Commercial performance==
Total sales were around 2 million, though 1.2 million of these were sold in the United States. The album both debuted and peaked at position number 7 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album sales chart in December 1997, and was certified Platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America on December 15, 1997, for shipment of one million copies in the U.S.

The album also had a quick run on the Swedish albums chart and peaked at number 14.

<doc id="1108085" wikidata="Q5017359" url="?curid=1108085" title="Voter caging">
<text>Voter caging is a colloquial term used in the United States referring to a campaign activity used to remove, or attempt to remove, targeted voters from official lists of registered voters. It occurs when a non-governmental organization, such as a political party or a campaign, sends first-class mail to registered voters, in order to compile a so-called &quot;challenge list&quot; of the names of those whose letters are returned undelivered. The fact that the mail was returned as undeliverable may be seen as either proof, or strong evidence of, the person no longer residing at the address on their voter registration. The challenge list is presented to election officials with the suggestion that the officials should these names from the voter registration rolls or to challenge voters&#x27; eligibility to vote on the grounds that the voters no longer reside at their registered addresses.

The phrase &quot;voter caging&quot; came about as a metaphorical extension of the benign term &quot;caging&quot; that is used in the direct mail industry.

In the United States, official government election offices are required to periodically maintain and update their lists of registered voters. Organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and Fair Fight Action periodically take to the courts to challenge the methods used by official government election offices to maintain their lists. Some list maintenance tactics are prohibited by the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 

==Method==
Voter caging refers to the practice of sending mail to addresses on the voter rolls, compiling a list of the mail that is returned undelivered, and using that list to challenge voters&#x27; registrations and votes on the grounds that the voters on the roll do not legally reside at their registered addresses.

More concretely, a political party or campaign will send out non-forwardable, first-class mail to voters or particular voters they want to target (often assumed to be a demographic that belongs to the opposing party). It will compile a list of voters for whom mail has been returned as undeliverable. The list is called a caging list. First-class mail marked as non-forwardable has resulted in a rate of return (returned and marked undeliverabl) as high as one return for every fifteen letters sent out. The so-called &quot;caging list&quot; that is the compiled names of all those for whom the envelopes were returned, marked undeliverable, can then be presented by the political party or campaign to election officials, with a request that the election officials should proceed to purge those people from the list of registered voters, or at a minimum, take a second look at whether the voter still resides at the address of registration. Election officials are not required to remove names based on having been presented with a caging list.

When a voter turns out to vote, who has been identified as no longer living at the address on their voter registration, election officials at the polling place may challenge their registration and require them to cast a provisional ballot. If investigation of the provisional ballot demonstrates that the voter has just moved or there is an error in the address and the voter is legally registered, the vote would then be counted. Opponents of this practice say that it is an unreliable method for determining whether a voter is ineligible to vote.

==History==

=== 1980s ===
Actions of the Ballot Security Task Force in New Jersey in 1981 are believed to be the first wide-scale use of voter caging as a campaign tactic. The RNC sent letters to predominantly-black neighborhoods in New Jersey in 1981. When 45,000 letters were returned as undeliverable, the RNC compiled a challenge list to remove those voters from the rolls. The RNC additionally sent off-duty law enforcement officials to the polls and hung posters in heavily black neighborhoods warning that violating election laws is a crime. 
Believing that these tactics violated the Voting Rights Act, the Democratic National Committee took the RNC to federal court. Rather than see the case fully litigated, the RNC entered a consent decree, which prohibited the party from engaging in anti-fraud initiatives that targeted minorities from conducting mail campaigns to &quot;compile voter challenge lists&quot;.

In Louisiana in 1986, the RNC tried to have 31,000 voters, mostly black, removed from the rolls when a party mailer was returned. Again, the action was successfully challenged in federal court.

=== 1993 National Voter Registration Act ===
Section 8 of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (NVRA) has been interpreted to prohibit voter caging:
===2004 elections===
BBC journalist Greg Palast obtained an RNC document entitled &quot;State Implementation Template III.doc&quot; that described Republican election operations for caging plans in numerous states. The paragraph in the document pertaining to caging was:
V. Pre Election Day Operations New Registration Mailing
At whatever point registration in the state closes, a first class mailing should be sent to all new registrants as well as purged/inactive voters. This mailing should welcome the recipient to the voter rolls. It is important that a return address is clearly identifiable. Any mail returned as undeliverable for any reason, should be used to generate a list of problematic registrations. Poll watchers should have this list and be prepared to challenge anyone from this list attempting to vote.
Shortly before the 2004 election, Palast also obtained a caging list for Jacksonville, Florida, which contained many blacks and registered Democrats. The list was attached to an email that a Florida Republican Party official was sending to RNC headquarters official Tim Griffin.

The Republican National Committee also sent letters to minority areas in Cleveland, Ohio. When 35,000 letters were returned as undeliverable, the party employed poll watchers to challenge the voters&#x27; right to vote. Civil liberties groups challenged the RNC in a case that went to the Supreme Court, but the RNC was not stopped from challenging the voters.

Similarly, the RNC sent out 130,000 letters to minority areas in mostly-black Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

===2008 elections===

In December 2007, Kansas Republican Chair Kris Kobach sent an email boasting that &quot;to date, the Kansas GOP has identified and caged more voters in the last 11 months than the previous two years!&quot;

Republicans sent out fundraising mailers to voters in five Florida counties: Duval, Hillsborough, Collier, Miami-Dade and Escambia, with &#x27;do not forward&#x27; on the letters. The mailers included inaccurate voter ID numbers and ostensibly confirmed with voters they were registered as Republican. The RNC declined to discuss the mailer with the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot;. A representative denied that the mailing had anything to do with caging. Two top Florida elections officials, both Republicans, faulted the Republican mailing, calling it &quot;confusing&quot; and &quot;unfortunate&quot; because of a potential to undermine voter confidence by making them question the accuracy of their registrations.&quot; Some officials expressed concern that the RNC would try to use a caging list derived from the mailers.

In Northern California, reports of voter caging emerged when letters marked &#x27;do not forward&#x27; were sent to Democrats with fake voter ID numbers. The description of the letters matched the letters that were sent out in Florida. Many details on the letters were false; for example, the letters referred to a Voter Identification Division, but RNC personnel said they had no such department. The RNC did not return calls from a news organization regarding the letters.

On October 5, 2008, the Republican Lieutenant Governor of Montana, John Bohlinger, accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge 6,000 voters from three counties that trend Democratic. The purges included decorated war veterans and active duty soldiers.

Terri Lynn Land, the Secretary of State of Michigan, was found to be purging thousands of voters from voting rolls based on Voter ID cards being returned as undeliverable. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) took Michigan to court over the purges. Judge Stephen J. Murphy ruled the purge illegal under the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 and directed Land to reinstate the affected voters.

===2013: &quot;RNC v. DNC&quot; retention of consent decree===
In the years since the original 1982 consent decree on voter caging, a series of suits and countersuits between the RNC and the DNC as well as civil rights groups and labor unions ensued. The RNC would attempt to have the consent decree lifted and other parties would attempt to have the decree enforced in specific cases in which the plaintiffs would allege the RNC was in violation of the decree. In November 2008, the RNC sought to have the consent decree lifted in the U.S. District Court in Newark (&quot;Republican National Committee v. Democratic National Committee&quot;). Judge Dickinson R. Debevoise rejected the effort, and his ruling was upheld by the Third US Circuit Court of Appeals. The Third Circuit ruling found, &quot;It is not in the public interest to vacate the decree.&quot; It also stated, &quot;If the RNC does not hope to engage in conduct that would violate the Decree, it is puzzling that the RNC is pursuing vacatur so vigorously notwithstanding the District Court&#x27;s significant modifications to the Decree.&quot; The RNC then petitioned the Supreme Court of the United States to hear an appeal of the Third Circuit ruling but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case, leaving the Third Circuit ruling to stand as legally binding.

===2016: No new violation established ===

&quot;On October 26, 2016, the DNC filed a motion asking that the court find the RNC had violated the decree. On November 5, after abbreviated discovery, the district court denied the DNC’s request, ruling that the DNC had not provided sufficient evidence of coordination between the Trump campaign and the RNC on ballot-security operations, but will allow the DNC to offer further evidence after the election,&quot; according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law.

=== 2017: Consent decree expired ===

On January 8, 2018, the US District Court for the District of New Jersey declined to extend the consent decree beyond its previous December 1, 2017, expiration date, because, “the did not prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, a violation of the [1982] Consent Decree before December 1, 2017”. Harvard Law Professor Nicholas Stephanopoulos suggested this decision was at least partially influenced by a general decline in the willingness of courts to intervene in election law issues, as witnessed by several moderately recent decisions by the Supreme Court of the United States, especially in &quot;Shelby County v. Holder&quot;.

<doc id="1108087" wikidata="Q469693" url="?curid=1108087" title="Lucille Bremer">
<text>Lucille Bremer (February 21, 1917 – April 16, 1996) was an American film actress and dancer.

==Biography==
Bremer was born in Amsterdam, New York, but soon moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where she studied ballet. At age 12, she danced with the Philadelphia Opera Company.

=== Pre-Hollywood career ===
Once in New York, she danced in various specialty acts, most notably in the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair &quot;American Jubilee&quot;. She auditioned and began her career as a Rockette at Radio City Music Hall in New York City, at age 16. She was voted as &quot;most likely to succeed&quot; by her Rockette peers. She was also known as &quot;5th from the right&quot; in the Rockettes line up. Bremer also auditioned as a dancer for various Broadway shows, along with fellow stars Vera-Ellen and June Allyson, appearing as a &#x27;Pony Girl&#x27; in the Broadway musical &quot;Panama Hattie&quot; and also in &quot;Lady in the Dark&quot;.

Bremer&#x27;s first attempt at a career in films was unsuccessful. She said of her screen test with Warner Bros.: &quot;It was so bad I realized why nothing had happened.&quot; She returned to dancing, performing at the Copacabana nightclub in New York City and the Club Versailles, where she was spotted by Arthur Freed, a producer at Metro Goldwyn Mayer. She was listed among six &quot;Samba Sirens&quot; for the Copacabana Revue&#x27;s in the summer of 1942 outing in Saratoga Springs, New York, and as a singer-dancer as a Hotel Commodore &quot;Commodorable&quot; in 1943.

=== Career in film ===
Freed took her to Hollywood, where her screen test impressed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer mogul Louis B. Mayer. She was offered a contract with Goldwyn Studios, but ultimately decided to sign with MGM so that she could showcase her dancing ability. An accomplished dancer, she was considered to display potential as a dramatic actress. She studied acting at MGM with the great acting coach Lillian Burns, and was groomed for stardom as an important member of the legendary Freed Unit.
Bremer made her screen debut to excellent notices in director Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s smash hit Technicolor musical &quot;Meet Me in St. Louis&quot; (1944) as Rose Smith, Judy Garland&#x27;s older sister, and followed this with a starring role opposite Fred Astaire in the musical fable &quot;Yolanda and the Thief&quot; (1945). Despite sumptuous production values and a staff of high-priced talent behind the scenes (directed again by Vincente Minnelli from a story by Ludwig Bemelmans, with an original score by Harry Warren and producer/songwriter Arthur Freed, and choreographed by Fred Astaire and Eugene Loring), it was a box-office failure. The film&#x27;s ambitious surrealist fantasy theme was not popular with wartime audiences, and Bremer, a newcomer in her first starring role, took most of the blame. Her career never recovered. She followed this disappointment with featured dance performances, once again with Astaire and directed by Minnelli, in two memorable sequences in the successful musical revue &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (released in 1946, but Bremer&#x27;s numbers were filmed in 1945, before filming &quot;Yolanda and the Thief&quot;). Her last major film musical was the lavish Jerome Kern biopic &quot;Till the Clouds Roll By&quot; (1946), in which Bremer had some good dramatic scenes and dances with Van Johnson. After this, MGM began to lose interest in promoting her. After a minor dramatic film with MGM, &quot;Dark Delusion&quot; (1947), she was loaned to Eagle-Lion in 1948 for her final three films. Bremer played her last starring role in the film noir &quot;Behind Locked Doors&quot; (1948).

=== Life and career after MGM ===

One of her last films was alongside Mexican movie star Arturo de Córdova in &quot;Adventures of Casanova&quot; (1948).

Reportedly disappointed with her Hollywood career, she elected not to renew her contract and left the film industry. She had met and fallen in love with the son of the former president of Mexico, Abelardo Luis Rodriguez, who bore the same name as his father. She and &quot;Rod&quot; Rodriguez were married at Catalina Island in August 1948. She moved with him to Baja California Sur, Mexico, at the beginning of the Golden Age of Baja and started the private resort Rancho Las Cruces as well as the original Palmilla Hotel and the Hacienda Hotel. With her contacts in Hollywood and her husband Rod&#x27;s influence, they drew people from Hollywood who sought to enjoy this newly found paradise. She and her husband were also business partners with Desi Arnaz, Lucille Ball, and Bing Crosby.

After her divorce (in 1963), Bremer settled in La Jolla, California, where she owned a children&#x27;s clothing boutique. She continued to travel between La Jolla, California, and Baja California Mexico.

==Death==
Bremer died in 1996 from a heart attack at age 79.

<text>Amos Eaton (May 17, 1776 – May 10, 1842) was an American botanist, geologist, and educator who is considered the founder of the modern scientific prospectus in education, which was a radical departure from the American liberal arts tradition of classics, theology, lecture, and recitation. Eaton co-founded the Rensselaer School in 1824 with Stephen van Rensselaer III &quot;in the application of science to the common purposes of life&quot;. His books in the eighteenth century were among the first published for which a systematic treatment of the United States was attempted, and in a language that all could read. His teaching laboratory for botany in the 1820s was the first of its kind in the country. Eaton&#x27;s popular lectures and writings inspired numerous thinkers, in particular women, whom he encouraged to attend his public talks on experimental philosophy. Emma Willard would found the Troy Female Seminary (Emma Willard School), and Mary Mason Lyon, the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (Mount Holyoke College). Eaton held the rank of senior professor at Rensselaer until his death in 1842.

==Life==

Amos Eaton was born at Chatham, New York on May 17, 1776. His father, Captain Abel Eaton was a farmer of comfortable means. He belonged to a family that traced its lineage to John Eaton, who arrived from Dover, England in 1635, settling two years later in Dedham, Massachusetts Bay Colony. Amos Eaton showed early preference for nature, by the age of sixteen constructing his own compass and chain to survey land as a chain bearer.

Eaton was sent to Williamstown with the Rev. Dr. David Potter, of Spencertown, to study at Williams College. After graduating in 1799 with high marks in natural philosophy, he married the Polly Thomas in October the same year. She died in 1802, leaving him a son. In 1805 he married Sally Cady who bore him five sons. In New York, Eaton formed an association with naturalists David Hosack and Samuel L. Mitchill and under their influence, he became committed to the natural sciences, and in particular botany.

Nevertheless, Eaton pursued a legal career and arranged to study law with Elisha Williams, of Spencertown, and Josiah Ogden, of New York. In 1802 he was admitted to the bar and in 1804 received permission to practice before the Supreme Court of New York. Eaton worked as a lawyer and as a land agent in Catskill, New York. He became deeply involved in land-speculation and was charged with forgery in 1810, possibly as a result of securing a loan using property that was already mortgaged. He was found guilty and spent nearly five years in Newgate Prison, the state penitentiary at Greenwich Village. While in prison he formed a friendship with a young John Torrey, whose father was a city alderman and fiscal agent for the prison. Torrey would bring Eaton books while Eaton in turn would tutor his protege in the basics of botany. In 1815 he was released with a pardon from Daniel D. Tompkins, the governor of New York.

On his release in 1815, Eaton moved to New Haven at Yale College to take up the study of botany, chemistry and mineralogy under the tuition of Benjamin Silliman and Eli Ives. He then returned to Williams College to offer a course of lectures and volunteer classes of the students on botany, mineralogy zoology, and geology and published a botanical dictionary. In 1817, he published his &quot;Manual of Botany for the Northern States&quot;, the first comprehensive flora of the area; it ultimately went through eight editions. From Williams College the lectures were extended, in the shape of courses, with practical instructions to classes, to the larger towns of New England and New York.

He returned to New York in 1818 following Governor DeWitt Clinton&#x27;s invitation for him to deliver a series of lectures on the state&#x27;s geology to the New York State Legislature in connection with the building of the Erie Canal. Among the legislators who heard these lectures was Stephen Van Rensselaer III, who hired him to produce &quot;A Geological Survey of the County of Albany&quot;, which was followed by geological surveys of much of the area through which the canal was built. Ultimately, Eaton completed a survey fifty miles wide from Buffalo to Boston.

Eaton delivered talks at the Lenox Academy and the Medical College at Castleton, Vermont, where he was appointed professor of natural history in 1820. He gave lectures and practical instructions in Troy, laying the foundation of the Lyceum of Natural History. In 1820 and 1821, Eaton initiated geological and agricultural surveys of Albany and Rensselaer counties, which were financed by Van Rensselaer.

===Rensselaer School===
After co-founding the Rensselaer School in 1824, Van Rensselaer appointed Eaton to teach chemistry, experimental philosophy, geology, surveying, and the &quot;laws regulating town officers and jurors.&quot; By then Eaton was a well established public speaker on natural philosophy, touring and delivering lectures in the northeast. He was also a recognized pioneer in botany and principal land surveyor in the country. Eaton immediately set about to develop a new kind of institution devoted to the application of science to life, a modern scientific prospectus, new methods of instruction and examination, recognizing women in higher education, and practical training for adults. Eaton&#x27;s original aim was to also train teachers and disciples, which he did in large numbers. Students learned by doing, in sharp contrast with the conventional method of learning by rote. Students were made into experimenters and workers, and, in place of recitations, delivered lectures to one another. Eaton also often led day excursions, taking students to observe the application of science on nearby farms and in workshops, tanneries, and bleaching factories. They then returned to the laboratory, analyzing the principles involved. This, too, was an innovation, as it represented a reversal of the usual pedagogical method, which began with the principle and proceeded to the application. Eaton&#x27;s principal focus was the training of students to teach science and its applications to the New York farming community via experimental demonstrations, a goal in keeping with Britain&#x27;s mechanics&#x27; institutes and lyceum movements on diffusing useful knowledge. As a result, Eaton&#x27;s system of instruction posed a challenge, if not a threat, to the traditional liberal-arts colleges, causing them to expand their own curricula and set up departments or schools of engineering and science. Formal engineering education would not be added at Rensselaer until 1828. After becoming professor of natural history at Harvard College in 1842, Asa Gray required some practical work of all of his students in botany along the lines established by Amos Eaton.

Eaton was interested in education for women, he had lectured them on his tour of New England, and he was persuaded that their failure in science was caused by inferior opportunity, not &quot;perversion of female genius.&quot; Eaton, clearly hoped to educate females at the school. He believed that women were capable of learning practical science and mathematics; they simply had not been taught the subjects at traditional female academies. His commitment to the cause led Eaton to enroll a class of eight young women in a special mathematics course to show that they could advance beyond &quot;the speculative geometry and algebra as generally practiced in female seminaries.&quot; When the students completed their course of study in 1835, Eaton requested a review of their progress by the school&#x27;s less-than-enthusiastic board of examiners. The eight young ladies who participated in Eaton&#x27;s experiment continued their education at the Troy Female Seminary. Eaton trained a bevy of future, notable, scientists and lectured to countless later educationists.

Today Amos Eaton Hall houses the mathematics department, and the Amos Eaton Professorship is a faculty endowment named at the institute. The Amos Eaton Chair was originally given by students to Amos Eaton in 1839, but was later returned to the institute by the Eaton family.

===Personal life===
Following the death of his first wife, Polly Thomas, Eaton was remarried to Sally Cady in 1803, who bore him five sons. After her death he was remarried to Anna Bradley in 1816, by whom he had three sons and two daughters. She having died, Eaton married Alice Johnson in 1827, who bore him one son, and survived him about four years. Three of his children showed a preference for natural philosophy. Hezekiah Hulbert Eaton (1809-1832) became a chemist at Transylvania University but died at the age of twenty-three. Major General Amos Beebe Eaton (1806-1877) was a U.S. Army officer interested in natural philosophy. Sara Cady Eaton (1818-1881) taught natural sciences and modern languages in a young woman&#x27;s seminary at Monticello, Illinois. Eaton&#x27;s grandson, Daniel Cady Eaton (1834-1895), professed botany at Yale College in the 1860s.

<text>Calgon is an American brand of bath and beauty products, owned by PDC Brands.

== Early history ==
The original product consisted of powdered sodium hexametaphosphate (amorphous sodium polyphosphate), which, in water, would complex with ambient calcium ions and certain other cations—preventing formation of unwanted salts and interference by those cations with the actions of soap or other detergents. Its name, a portmanteau derived from the phrase &quot;calcium gone&quot;, was originally promoted for general use in bathing and cleaning. It gave rise to derivative products, which have diverged from the original composition. Today, Calgon water softener contains the active ingredient sodium citrate, and the now discontinued powder used zeolite and polycarboxylate, all of which are less problematic in wastewater treatment than phosphates.

<doc id="1108096" wikidata="Q1108749" url="?curid=1108096" title="Bubble Symphony">
<text>, also known as , is an arcade video game in the &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; series developed by Taito in 1994. While being a new &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; for a new generation, it takes place after &quot;Parasol Stars&quot;.

==Story==
For this adventure, Bubblun and Bobblun, the familiar green and blue bubble dragons, are joined by girls Kululun (an amber dragon) and Cororon (a pink dragon), but they are stated to be the children of the Bub and Bob of &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;.

According to the intro, the four characters (as humans) inadvertently unleash Hyper Drunk, the final boss, while reading books. Hyper Drunk transforms the four into bubble dragons and banishes them to a new world.

&quot;Bubble Symphony&quot; takes place after &quot;Bubble Memories&quot;, even though it was released earlier.

===Cameos===
The game includes cameos by other Taito characters and settings from &quot;The NewZealand Story&quot;, &quot;Darius&quot;, &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, &quot;Arkanoid&quot;, &quot;Liquid Kids&quot;, &quot;KiKi KaiKai&quot; (including Cindy, known in Japanese version as Sayo-chan and the English &quot;Pocky &amp; Rocky&quot; games as Pocky), &quot;Yūyu no Quiz de Go! Go!&quot;, &quot;Pu·Li·Ru·La&quot;, and &quot;The Fairyland Story&quot;.

==Gameplay==
Although a sequel to &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot;, the game inaugurates few changes to the gameplay formula of that title. The small changes that have been made are that a boss is now encountered every five to ten levels, giving those scenes a similar prominence to &quot;Rainbow Islands&quot;, and the player takes a branching route through the levels by selecting one of two doors after every boss. The players can now charge the bubble shot; if released when the dragon&#x27;s horns or bow is glowing, the player character will breathe three bubbles at once, with the specific formation dependent on the character chosen. The players must collect certain square cards with music notes inside, in order to get the 4 keys that lead to the final world or face an early false ending. Also, the characters have to collect a rod to turn their characters from their dragon to human forms during the course of the game.

All the enemies from the original &quot;Bubble Bobble&quot; appear in this game, along with a lot of newer enemies. The credits (in the arcade version) show all the enemies&#x27; names, and those of characters who make cameos from other Taito games.

===Characters===
* is the well-rounded character; he can fire three grouped bubbles straight ahead when powered up (the bubble button is held for a few seconds then released).
* has faster speed in exchange for shorter range. He can shoot three bubbles in a spread pattern when powered up.
* has the longest available range, but is slow. She can shoot her bubbles in a &quot;T&quot; pattern (forwards, backwards, and down) when powered up.
* has the fastest bubble blowing and can shoot her bubbles in an inverted-&quot;T&quot; pattern (forwards, backwards, and up) when powered up.

==Ports==
The only home port of &quot;Bubble Symphony&quot; was for the Sega Saturn in Japan.

The game was included in the &quot;Taito Legends 2&quot; compilation for Microsoft Windows in North America and Europe, and on the Xbox in Europe only. It was released on the PlayStation 2 in Japan only, via &quot;Taito Memories II Volume 2&quot;. The Xbox and PS2 versions run in upscanned 640x448 resolution, which results in slight flickering, no scanlines, and slightly blurrier image compared to the Arcade and Sega Saturn versions. A PlayStation version was completed, and was going to be published by Virgin Interactive Entertainment, but was never released.

==Soundtrack==
 is a video game soundtrack that was released on CD and published by Pony Canyon and Scitron Label on January 20, 1995 in Japan. Tracks 1, 2 and 22 were arranged by Yasuko Yamada, Yasutaka Mizushima and Tamayo Kawamoto.

 was released by Zuntata Records and Taito Corp on July 31, 2013 in Japan.

== Reception ==
In Japan, &quot;Game Machine&quot; listed &quot;Bubble Symphony&quot; on their December 1, 1994 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade game of the year.

<doc id="1108102" wikidata="Q704781" url="?curid=1108102" title="Vernon Dalhart">
<text>Marion Try Slaughter (April 6, 1883 – September 14, 1948), better known by his stage name Vernon Dalhart, was an American country music singer and songwriter. His recording of the classic ballad &quot;Wreck of the Old 97&quot; was the first country song reputed to have sold one million copies, although sales figures for pre-World War Two recordings are difficult to verify.

==Biography==
Dalhart was born in Jefferson, Texas, on April 6, 1883. He took his stage name from two towns, Vernon and Dalhart in Texas, between which he punched cattle as a teenager in the 1890s. Dalhart&#x27;s father, Robert Marion Slaughter, was killed by his brother-in-law, Bob Castleberry, when Vernon was age 10. When Dalhart was 12 or 13, the family moved from Jefferson to Dallas, Texas.

He sang and played harmonica and Jew&#x27;s harp at local community events and attended the Dallas Conservatory of Music. He married Sadie Lee Moore-Livingston in 1901 and had two children, a son and a daughter. In 1910, he moved the family to New York City, where he worked in a piano warehouse and took occasional singing jobs.

===Music career===
Dalhart&#x27;s education was rooted in classical music. He wanted to be an opera singer, and in 1913 he got parts in &quot;Madame Butterfly&quot; and &quot;H.M.S. Pinafore&quot;. He saw an advertisement in the local newspaper for singers and applied. He was auditioned by Thomas Alva Edison and went on to record for Edison Records. From 1916 until 1926, he made over 400 recordings of light classical music and early dance band vocals for various record labels.

Between 1927 and 1929 he also recorded with the Vernon Dalhart Trio, composed of Vernon Dalhart, Adelyne Hood, and Carson Robison.

In the 1920s and 1930s, he sang on more than 5000 singles (78s) for many labels, employing more than 100 pseudonyms, such as Al Craver, Vernon Dale, Frank Evans, Hugh Lattimer, Sid Turner, George White (with original Memphis Five) and Bob White. On Grey Gull Records, he often used the name &quot;Vel Veteran&quot;, which was also used by other singers, including Arthur Fields. He was already an established singer when he made his first country music recordings.

Dalhart stated in a 1918 interview amidst criticism of his accent seeming artificial, &quot;When you are born and brought up in the South your only trouble is to talk any other way ...the &#x27;sure &#x27;nough Southerner&#x27; talks almost like a Negro, even when he&#x27;s white. I&#x27;ve broken myself of the habit, more or less, in ordinary conversation, but it still comes pretty easy.&quot;

===Hits===
Dalhart had a hit single with his 1924 recording of &quot;The Wreck of the Old 97&quot;, a classic American ballad about the derailment of &quot;Fast Mail&quot; train No. 97 near Danville, Virginia, in 1903. Recorded for the Victor Talking Machine Company, the song alerted the national record companies to the existence of a sizable market for country-music vocals. It became the first Southern song to become a national success. With &quot;The Prisoner&#x27;s Song&quot; as the b-side, the single eventually sold as many as seven million copies, a huge number for recording in the 1920s. It was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and was the biggest-selling, non-holiday record in the first 70 years of recorded music. Joel Whitburn, a statistician for &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, determined that &quot;The Prisoner&#x27;s Song&quot; was No. 1 hit for twelve weeks in 1925–26.

One of the recordings most associated with Vernon Dalhart, especially in the United Kingdom, is his 1925 track &quot;The Runaway Train&quot; (Talking Machine Co., Camden, New Jersey, Victor 19685-A, Shellac). This was played on BBC Radio&#x27;s &#x27;Children&#x27;s Favourites&#x27; between 1954 and 1982, and even now almost every compilation of children&#x27;s records in the UK includes this timeless favourite.

Wanting to repeat the success of the single, the Victor Company sent Ralph Peer to the southern mountains in 1927 to facilitate the Bristol Sessions. These sessions led to the discovery of singer Jimmie Rodgers and the Carter Family, after which Peer&#x27;s royalty model would become the standard of the music industry.

=== Later life and death ===
By the late 1930s, Dalhart&#x27;s popularity declined and he had lost much of his income in the Great Depression. Dalhart eventually retired and relocated to Bridgeport, Connecticut in 1940 where he worked as a night clerk for the Hotel Barnum. 

He died on September 14, 1948 of a coronary occlusion at the age of 65. He is buried in Mountain Grove Cemetery in Bridgeport.

<doc id="1108103" wikidata="Q57947" url="?curid=1108103" title="Nantong">
<text>Nantong is a prefecture-level city in southeastern Jiangsu province, China. Located on the northern bank of the Yangtze River, near the river mouth. Nantong is a vital river port bordering Yancheng to the north; Taizhou to the west; Suzhou, Wuxi and Shanghai to the south across the river; and the East China Sea to the east. Its population was 7,726,635 as of the 2020 census, 3,766,534 of whom lived in the built-up area made up of three urban districts.

On September 26, 2004, the first World Metropolitan Development Forum was held in Nantong. In 2005, Nantong had a GDP growth of 15.4%, the highest growth rate in Jiangsu province, and in 2016 Nantong&#x27;s GDP had a total of about 675 billion yuan, ranking 21st in the whole country.

Although the city took a blow from the economic depression of the 1930s, as well as the Japanese occupation of the 1930s and 40s, Nantong has remained an important center for the textile industry. Because of its deepwater harbor and connections to inland navigational canals, it was one of 14 port cities opened to foreign investment in recent Chinese economic reforms.

==Geography and climate==

Because the coast of the East China Sea is constantly expanding eastward as the Yangtze River adds silt to its delta, the distance between Nantong and the seashore is getting longer than it once was in ancient times.

In May 2021, a violent storm hit the city, leaving 11 people dead, and a further 102 people injured. According to authorities, many homes were badly damaged during the storm, and more than 3,000 people were evacuated. They were among many other cities on China&#x27;s east coast that were affected.

Nantong has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with four distinct seasons. Winters are chilly and damp, and cold northwesterly winds caused by the Siberian high can force temperatures to fall below freezing at night although snowfall is relatively uncommon. Summers are hot and humid, and downpours or freak thunderstorms often occur. Monthly daily average temperatures range from in January to in July, and the annual mean is . With the plum rains in June and early July comes the rainiest part of the year.

==History==
===Ancient era===

The area that is now Nantong was originally part of the state of Wu during the Spring and Autumn period, which was later conquered by the state of Yue in 473 BC. After yet again being subjected to a new foreign rule by the state of Chu in 334 BC, the inhabitants of present-day Nantong would again experience another regime change during the first unification of China by the state of Qin.

===Imperial era===
From the Han dynasty up until the Tang dynasty, what is now called Nantong was a minor city county subordinate to Yangzhou. By AD 958, that city county had already gained sufficient importance for it to be upgraded to an independent prefecture called Tongzhou (&quot;Opening Prefecture&quot;, possibly from its position near the mouth of the Yangtze) to be created. The increasing wealth of Yangzhou caused Tongzhou to be once again eclipsed as an administrative center in 1368.

When Tongzhou finally regained prefecture status in 1724 during the Qing dynasty, it was renamed to its present name Nantong (&quot;Southern Tong&quot;) to avoid confusion with another administrative division also named Tongzhou, located near Beijing.

===Modern era===
Nantong was the first place in China to be developed into a modern city after the collapse of the Qing dynasty, and was also the birthplace of China&#x27;s modern industry.

The prosperity of Nantong has traditionally depended on salt production on the nearby seacoast, rice and cotton agriculture, and manufacture of cotton and silk textiles, especially Nantong blue calico. A local statesman and industrialist named Zhang Jian founded Nantong&#x27;s first modern cotton mills in 1899. He then developed an industrial complex that included flour, oil, and silk reeling mills, a distillery, and a machinery shop. He also founded a shipping line and reclaimed saline agricultural land to the east of Nantong for cotton production. Thanks to these efforts, by 1911 Nantong was commonly called &quot;Zhang Jian&#x27;s Kingdom&quot;. In the early Republican period, the Nantong Special Administrative District included Chongming County, now part of Shanghai.

==Culture==
* Xuanmiao Temple, structure built during the Song era.
* Nantong Museum

==Language==

Nantong city and its six counties (or county-level cities) are rich in linguistic diversity, featuring both important Northern Wu varieties and highly divergent dialects of Mandarin (see Nantong dialect). People in the city of Nantong speak a unique dialect which sounds nothing like standard Mandarin or any other dialect, and it also holds distinctive differences from surrounding dialects. 

About 2 million people in the southern parts of Tongzhou, Haimen, and Qidong speak the Wu language, the specific local variety of which is often referred to as &quot;Qi-hai Hua&quot; (), meaning Qidong-Haimen speech. It is about the same as the dialect spoken on the neighbouring island of Chongming, Shanghai. People in northern parts of these counties speak the &quot;Tongdong dialect&quot; (. People in Rugao, Hai&#x27;an speak other dialects.

==Tourism==
The Hao River, known as the Emerald Necklace of Nantong, surrounds the city with a total length of . Most city scenery lines this river.

Popular tourist sites include Langshan (&quot;Wolf Hill&quot;), which is around 110 meters high. On top of the hill is a Buddhist temple dedicated to a Song dynasty monk. Because of the monk&#x27;s legendary powers over water demons, sailors pray to him for protection on their voyages.

The Cao Gong Zhu Memorial Temple commemorates a local hero who defended the city against Japanese pirates in 1557.

Shuihuiyuan Garden, meaning Water Garden, is unique of all Chinese classical gardens due its creation in the Hui style. It includes the tombs of several people, such as Luo Binwang, a poet of the Tang dynasty; Wen Tianxiang, the national hero of the Nansong dynasty; and Zhang Jian, the scholar of the late Qing dynasty, who was a modern industrialist and supporter of education.

==Economy==

Nantong was historically known as an agricultural area and a traditional site for salt-making. Its principal agricultural products include cotton, silk, rice, wheat, fishing, fruits, rice wine, and more. Currently, the city is making efforts to upgrade its farming sectors and increase production of organic foods.

Nantong is one of the 14 port cities opened to foreign investment projects under China&#x27;s current policies of modernization. Nantong was traditionally an industrial city, especially around the turn of the 20th century, specializing in salt and cotton textile production. Today&#x27;s industrial corporations have made Nantong into an industrial hub since it opened its door to the outside world in the 1990s. With its excellent geographic location and the completion of two Yangtze River bridges, the prefecture is attracting more investment funding nationwide. Many of these investments come from international corporations. In October 2007, Singapore RGM International signed an agreement with Rudong, a county under Nantong&#x27;s jurisdiction, to invest in a port project, costing 9 billion Yuan or US$1.33 billion, at Rudong Yangkou Port. 

Today, Nantong is one of many fast-growing coastal cities in China. With the opening of Sutong Bridge in April 2008 and Chonghai Bridge in 2009, the city has been listed as the number one city in the Yangtze River Delta Economic Zone for foreign investment, surpassing its rivals Suzhou, Hangzhou and Nanjing.

As a sprawling metropolis, Nantong has experienced environment damage from its industrialization as well. The municipal government has been putting stiffer environmental policies into practice over the years and has spent tremendous amounts of money to curb pollution and plant more trees along its roads. The city is active in shutting down factories that do not meet its environment laws.

Nantong has developed rapidly in the last 25 years, as have most of the cities in the Yangtze River Delta. Nantong&#x27;s rapid economic growth is generally attributed to its advantageous location just north of Shanghai. Nantong&#x27;s Sutong Bridge is expected to further Nantong&#x27;s integration with Shanghai, cutting transportation time between the cities down from three hours to one hour.

The shipping corporation Cosco has a large port and ship repair yard on the river. Cosco (Nantong) Shipyard Co., Ltd, the first shipyard of the Cosco group, has placed itself adjacent to the busy port of Nantong. The yard has 1120 m of coastline and is equipped with one cape-size and one panamax size floating dock. Cosco Shipyard handles approximately 150 vessels per year. Nantong Mingde Heavy Industries originally operated a shipyard in Nantong, but declared bankruptcy in 2014. Minde&#x27;s parent company, Jiangsu Sainty Marine Corporation, would cease operations in 2017.

<doc id="1108108" wikidata="Q155933" url="?curid=1108108" title="Ards Peninsula">
<text>The Ards Peninsula () is a peninsula in County Down, Northern Ireland, on the north-east coast of Ireland. It separates Strangford Lough from the North Channel of the Irish Sea. Towns and villages on the peninsula include Donaghadee, Millisle, Portavogie and Portaferry. The large towns of Newtownards and Bangor are at the mainland edge of the peninsula. Burr Point is the easternmost point on the island of Ireland.

==History==

In the Middle Ages, the Ards peninsula was inhabited by the Uí Echach Arda, a Gaelic Irish clan, and was part of the kingdom of Ulaid. In the late 12th century it was invaded and conquered by the Anglo-Normans under John de Courcy, becoming a county of the Earldom of Ulster. The Earldom collapsed in the 14th century, but the Hiberno-Norman Savage family controlled the southern portion of the peninsula (the &#x27;Upper Ards&#x27; or &#x27;Little Ards&#x27;) over the following three centuries, while the northern portion (the &#x27;Lower Ards&#x27; or &#x27;Great Ards&#x27;) became part of the Gaelic territory of Clannaboy. There was a failed attempt by the English to colonize the Ards in the 1570s. In the early 17th century, the Lower Ards was acquired by James Hamilton and Hugh Montgomery, who settled Scottish Protestants there as part of the Plantation of Ulster.

<doc id="1108112" wikidata="Q914155" url="?curid=1108112" title="Luxo Jr.">
<text>Luxo Jr. is a 1986 American animated short film produced and released by Pixar. Written and directed by John Lasseter, the two-minute short film revolves around one larger and one smaller desk lamp. The larger lamp, named Luxo Sr., looks on while the smaller, &quot;younger&quot; Luxo Jr. plays exuberantly with a ball to the extent that it accidentally deflates. &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; was Pixar&#x27;s first animation after Ed Catmull and John Lasseter left the Lucasfilm Computer Division. The film is the source of Luxo Jr., the mascot of Pixar.

Lasseter aimed to finish the short film for the 1986 SIGGRAPH, an annual computer graphics conference attended by thousands of industry professionals. The film would come from his experiments with modeling his Luxo lamp. Lasseter worked to improve the story within the allotted two minutes. In animation, the film demonstrates the use of shadow maps within the rendering software. Lasseter applied the classic animation principles popularized by Disney&#x27;s Nine Old Men to convey the lamps&#x27; emotions. Catmull and Lasseter worked around the clock, and Lasseter even took a sleeping bag into work and slept under his desk, ready to work early the next morning. Ultimately, the film took four and a half months to be completed.

The short film debuted at SIGGRAPH. Before the film finished playing, the audience had already risen in applause. &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; is regarded as a breakthrough in the animation industry as a whole, changing traditionalists&#x27; interpretation of computer animation. The short was the first work of animation to use procedural animation, the software written by Eben Ostby. It received an Academy Award nomination for Best Animated Short Film, becoming the first CGI film nominated for an Academy Award.

The soundtrack music is an uncredited edit of three compositions on Brian Bennett&#x27;s album &quot;Counterpoint In Rhythm&quot;: &quot;Finesse&quot;, &quot;Quicksilver&quot;, and &quot;Chateau Latour&quot;.

In 2014, &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; was deemed &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot; by the Library of Congress and selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry.

==Plot==

In a dark room, a large illuminated balanced-arm desk lamp named Luxo Sr. sees a small yellow ball with a blue stripe and a red star on the front roll-up to him. He eyes the ball curiously and pushes it away, but the ball comes back to him. He pushes it away again, but it rolls past him as Luxo Jr., his happy and excited son, hops over and plays with the ball. Luxo Jr. then balances himself on top of the ball and bounces on it excessively, causing it to deflate. Luxo Jr. flips the deflated ball onto its side and looks up at Luxo Sr., who gently admonishes his son. Luxo Jr. then hops offscreen in shame but is later seen playing with a beach ball. Luxo Sr. looks at the camera, then shakes his head in embarrassment.

==Background==
The Graphics Group, which was one-third of the Computer Division of Lucasfilm, had been associating with Industrial Light &amp; Magic on computer-generated graphics in the early 1980s. In 1984, the group produced an animated short film titled &quot;The Adventures of André &amp; Wally B.&quot;, which premiered at the annual SIGGRAPH conference to great fanfare. The group, which numbered 40 individuals, was spun out as a corporation in February 1986 with investment by Steve Jobs shortly after he left Apple Computer. Jobs paid $5 million to George Lucas for technology rights and put them and $5 million cash as capital into the company. A factor contributing to Lucas&#x27; sale was an increase in cash flow difficulties following his 1983 divorce, which coincided with the sudden dropoff in revenues from &quot;Star Wars&quot; licenses following the release of &quot;Return of the Jedi&quot;. The newly independent company was headed by Dr. Edwin Catmull as president and Dr. Alvy Ray Smith as Executive Vice President. They were joined on the Board of Directors by Steve Jobs who was chairman.

Pixar&#x27;s small animation department—consisting of Lasseter, plus the part-time supporting efforts of several graphics scientists—was never meant to generate any revenue as far as Jobs was concerned. Catmull and Smith justified its existence on the basis that more films that were shown at SIGGRAPH like &quot;The Adventures of André and Wally B.&quot; would promote the company&#x27;s computers. The group had no film at SIGGRAPH the preceding year, its last year under Lucas&#x27;s wing, apart from a stained-glass knight sequence they produced for &quot;Young Sherlock Holmes&quot;. Catmull was determined that Pixar would have a film to show at its first SIGGRAPH as an independent company in August 1986. &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; was produced by Pixar employee John Lasseter as a demonstration of the Pixar Image Computer&#x27;s capabilities.

Two other short animations produced by two of the company&#x27;s graphics experts were in production during the time in which &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; was conceived. Bill Reeves, who was interested in algorithms to re-create the turbulence of ocean waves, made &quot;Flags and Waves&quot;, with waves reflecting a sunset and lapping against the shore. Eben Ostby, a Brown architecture major turned graphics programmer, made &quot;Beach Chair&quot;, starring a chair that walked across the sand and nervously approached the water, dipped its front legs in just far enough to test the temperature, then scurried along. Reeves and Ostby also assisted Lasseter with model making and rendering on the short film.

==Production==

Lasseter&#x27;s student film at CalArts, &quot;The Lady and the Lamp&quot;, applied Walt Disney&#x27;s observation that giving lifelike qualities to inanimate objects held comic potential. &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; displayed a further insight, however: that inanimate objects as characters held the potential for dramatic value as well. The film would come from Lasseter&#x27;s experiments with modeling his Luxo lamp. He had felt an inspiration strike when fellow employee Tom Porter brought his infant son Spencer to work one day and Lasseter, playing with the child, became fascinated with his proportions. A baby&#x27;s head was huge compared with the rest of its body, Lasseter realized. It struck Lasseter as humorous and he began to wonder what a young lamp would look like. He fiddled with the dimensions of all the parts of his Luxo model—all but the bulb since lightbulbs come from a store and don&#x27;t grow, he reasoned—and he emerged with a second character, Luxo Jr.

Lasseter initially intended &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; as a plotless character study. When he showed some early tests at an animation festival in Brussels, Belgium, respected Belgian animator Raoul Servais exhorted him, &quot;No matter how short it is, it should have a beginning, a middle, and an end. Don&#x27;t forget the story.&quot; Lasseter protested that the film would be too short for a story. &quot;You can tell a story in ten seconds&quot;, Servais responded. Lasseter was convinced. He devised a simple plotline in which the two lamps would play a game of catch with an inflated ball; Luxo Jr. would then approach the ball, hop onto it, bounce until the ball popped under him, and show dejection as the parent lamp looked on. Finally, Luxo Jr. would reappear feeling excited with a new, larger ball. Among the films shown at SIGGRAPH in 1985, Lasseter particularly admired a piece of character animation called &quot;Tony de Peltrie&quot;, which came from a group at the University of Montreal; it featured a strikingly expressive human character, an aging piano player who entertained while inwardly reflecting on better days, which inspired the film.

Apart from the film&#x27;s hoped-for promotional value, Catmull and Smith rationalized the project as a test of &quot;self-shadowing&quot; in the rendering software- that is, the ability of objects to shed light and shadows on themselves. Before self-shadowing, CGI shadows were made by adding a flattened and darkened version of the shadowed object.
On the technical level, the film demonstrates the use of shadow maps to simulate the shifting light and shadow given by the animated lamps. The lights and the color surfaces of all the objects are calculated, each using a RenderMan surface shader, not surface textures. The articulation of &quot;limbs&quot; is carefully coordinated, and power cords trail believably behind the moving lamps.

Because time and money were tight, Lasseter reduced the setting to its simplest elements. The background would be plain black and there would be no camera movement. His energies would rather be focused instead on working out techniques based on classic animation principles to convey emotion. Even though the characters were faceless and wordless, Lasseter shaped such subtleties as the speed of the child&#x27;s hops and the way it carried its head to convey in an instant when the child was feeling joy and when it was feeling sad. At every moment, the parent and child seemed to have a definite frame of mind. On the cinematic level, it demonstrates a simple and entertaining story, including effectively expressive individual characters. Catmull and Lasseter worked around the clock, and Lasseter even took a sleeping bag into work and slept under his desk, ready to work early the next morning.

==Release==

&quot;Luxo Jr.&quot;, alongside &quot;Flags and Waves&quot; and &quot;Beach Chair&quot;, debuted at SIGGRAPH in the Dallas Convention Center Arena, where the audience of six thousand immediately recognized the short film as a breakthrough. Before &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; finished playing at SIGGRAPH, the crowd had already risen in applause. &quot;Pixar&#x27;s marketing department did not go out of its way to point out that none of the film, not a single frame, had been rendered on a Pixar Image Computer&quot;, wrote David Price in his book &quot;The Pixar Touch&quot;. The audience was captivated by the far more realistic look than &quot;The Adventures of André and Wally B.&quot;. More significant than its photorealism, however, was its emotional realism. &quot;It was perhaps the first computer-animated film that enabled viewers to forget they were watching computer animation&quot;, wrote Price.

Afterward, Lasseter saw Jim Blinn, a longtime professional colleague, approaching him, obviously readying a question. Lasseter braced for a question about the shadowing algorithm or some other recondite technical issue that he knew equally little about. Blinn instead asked whether the big lamp was the mother or the father. Although the memories of those involved are now hazy, Lasseter elsewhere referred to the parent lamp as the father. Lasseter then realized that he had succeeded in applying the Disney touch of thought and emotion to his characters.

&quot;&quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; sent shock waves through the entire industry – to all of the corners for computer and traditional animation. At that time, most traditional artists were afraid of the computer. They did not realize that the computer was merely a different tool in the artist&#x27;s kit but instead perceived it as a type of automation that might endanger their jobs. Luckily, this attitude changed dramatically in the early &#x27;80s with the use of personal computers in the home. The release of our &quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; [...] reinforced this opinion turnaround within the professional community.&quot; – Edwin Catmull, Computer Animation: A Whole New World, 1998.

&quot;Luxo Jr.&quot; was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short in 1987 at the 59th Academy Awards, becoming the first CGI-animated short film to be nominated for an Academy Award. It won the Golden Nica in the &quot;Computer Animation/Film/ VFX” category of the Ars Electronica Festival in Linz in 1987.

The short was later released in theaters with &quot;Toy Story 2&quot; in 1999, subsequently appearing on its VHS and DVD releases in 2000. In this version, the short is preceded by the message, &quot;In 1986 Pixar Animation Studios produced its first film. This is why we have a hopping lamp in our logo.&quot; It also saw release on home video as part of &quot;Tiny Toy Stories&quot; in 1996 and &quot;Pixar Short Films Collection, Volume 1&quot; in 2007.

<doc id="1108118" wikidata="Q1394046" url="?curid=1108118" title="Faliraki">
<text>Faliraki () is the primary seaside resort village on the Greek island of Rhodes, in the Dodecanese. It is situated on Faliraki Bay, on the northeastern coast, about 14 km south of the town of Rhodes and 10 km southeast of the airport. It is part of the municipal unit Kallithea.

==Tourism==
Faliraki is a popular tourist destination with a 5 km stretch of sand and 12 FEE Blue Flags. At the southern end of Faliraki Beach there is an official naturist beach called Mandomata Beach, which has a small tavern as well as a couple of public toilets. Faliraki has rediscovered itself as a cosmopolitan, vibrant centre of tourism catering to many nationalities and all age groups. Faliraki boasts the largest water park in Greece, a state-of-the-art bowling park, a history park, and a fun-park for families and younger children. The centre of the town, particularly in July and August, is buzzing with younger children and families. As well as traditional Greek cuisine there are restaurants specialising in Chinese, Mexican, Italian and British cuisine. Along the beach front there are taverns, bars, restaurants, cafeterias and tourist shops. The fishing harbour of St. Apostolos is a hub of activity especially in the morning, whilst the fishing boats unload their catch, the day cruisers (direct to Lindos, Rhodes Town &amp; beaches) depart and locals congregate for their coffee.

<text>The Old Man of Hoy is a sea stack on Hoy, part of the Orkney archipelago off the north coast of Scotland. Formed from Old Red Sandstone, it is one of the tallest stacks in the United Kingdom. The Old Man is popular with climbers, and was first climbed in 1966. Created by the erosion of a cliff through hydraulic action some time after 1750, the stack is not more than a few hundred years old, but may soon collapse into the sea.

==Geography==
The Old Man stands close to Rackwick Bay on the west coast of Hoy, in Orkney, Scotland, and can be seen from the Scrabster to Stromness ferry. From certain angles it is said to resemble a human figure.

Winds are faster than for nearly a third of the time, and gales occur on average for 29 days a year. Combined with the depth of the sea, which quickly falls to , high-energy waves on the western side of Hoy lead to rapid erosion of the coast.

==Geology==
The Old Man of Hoy is a red sandstone stack, perched on a plinth of basalt rock, and one of the tallest sea stacks in the UK. It is separated from the mainland by a 60-metre (200 ft) chasm strewn with debris, and has nearly vertical sides with a top just a few metres wide. The rock is composed of layers of soft, sandy and pebbly sandstone and harder flagstones of Old Red Sandstone, giving the sides a notched and slab-like profile.

==History==

The Old Man is probably less than 250 years old and may be in danger of collapsing. The stack is not mentioned in the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a headland exists at the point where the Old Man is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a headland but no stack, but by 1819 the Old Man had been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller top section and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name.

Sometime in the early nineteenth century, a storm washed away one of the legs leaving it much as it is today, although erosion continues. By 1992, a 40-metre (130 ft) crack had appeared in the top of the south face, leaving a large overhanging section that will eventually collapse.

==Human activity==

===Climbing===
The stack was first climbed by mountaineers Chris Bonington, Rusty Baillie and Tom Patey in 1966. From 8–9 July 1967, an ascent featured in &quot;The Great Climb&quot;, a live BBC three-night outside broadcast, which had around 15 million viewers. This featured three pairs of climbers: Bonington and Patey repeated their original route, whilst two new lines were climbed by Joe Brown and Ian McNaught-Davis and by Pete Crew and Dougal Haston.

In 1968 Christine Crawshaw became the first woman to reach the summit of Hoy. In 1997, Catherine Destivelle made a solo ascent of the Old Man of Hoy; she did so while four months pregnant; her climb is captured in the 1998 climbing film, &quot;Rock Queen&quot;. This climb was filmed and has often been credited as the first solo ascent, but the Old Man had previously been soloed in October 1985 by Scots climber Bob Duncan; like Destivelle, he backroped the second, crux pitch, though he also backroped the top pitch because &quot;it looked harder from below than it turned out to be&quot;.
Red Széll became the first blind person to climb the Old Man, despite suffering from retinitis pigmentosa that left him with 5% vision. With assistance from Martin Moran and Nick Carter, he scaled the stack in 2013.

The youngest person to climb the Old Man is Edward Mills, who was 8 years old when he completed the climb in 4 hours 55 minutes on 9 June 2018, to raise money for the charity &quot;Climbers Against Cancer&quot; as his mother had terminal breast cancer. He was accompanied by his trainers, Ben West and Cailean Harker.

In 2019, Jesse Dufton became the first blind climber to lead an ascent on Old Man of Hoy. The climb was the subject of the 2020 film &quot;Climbing Blind&quot;.

The youngest female to climb the Old Man of Hoy is Sophia Wood, who was 10 years old when she completed the climb in just over 3 hours in June 2023. She traveled from the southeast of Virginia USA to Hoy Scotland UK and completed the climb with her two guides Edmund Hastings and Alex Riley. Sophia used this climb to start a fundraiser to help introduce climbing to kids with the &quot;Boys and Girls Club&quot; in her local area. 

There are seven routes up the stack, the most commonly used of which is the original landward facing &quot;East Face Route&quot;, graded E1 5b (Extremely Severe). A log book in a Tupperware container is buried in a cairn on the summit, as an ascensionists&#x27; record. As many as fifty ascents of the stack are made each year.

===Highline===

On 10 July 2017, Alexander Schulz completed a highline walk to and from the summit, at above the sea on a line long.

===BASE jumping===
Roger Holmes, Gus Hutchison-Brown, and Tim Emmett made the first BASE jump from the stack on 14 May 2008. Hutchinson-Brown died 11 days later during a jump in Switzerland. On 27 July 2019, two Poles, Filip Kubica and Dominik Grajner repeated BASE jumped from the top.

<doc id="1108130" wikidata="Q77486" url="?curid=1108130" title="Hermann Löns">
<text>Hermann Löns (29 August 1866 – 26 September 1914) was a German journalist and writer. He is most famous as &quot;The Poet of the Heath&quot; for his novels and poems celebrating the people and landscape of the North German moors, particularly the Lüneburg Heath in Lower Saxony. Löns is well known in Germany for his famous folksongs. He was also a hunter, naturalist and conservationist. Despite being well over the normal recruitment age, Löns enlisted and was killed in World War I and his purported remains were later used by the German government for celebratory purposes.

== Life and work ==
Hermann Löns was born on 29 August 1866 in Kulm (now Chełmno, Poland) in the Province of Prussia. He was one of twelve siblings, of whom five died early. His parents were Friedrich Wilhelm Löns (1832–1908) from Bochum, a teacher, and Klara (née Cramer; 1844–96) from Paderborn. Hermann Löns grew up in Deutsch-Krone (West Prussia). In 1884, the family relocated back to Westfalen as his father found a position in Münster. A sickly child who survived typhus, Löns graduated from school on his second try with the &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1886. Urged by his father, he began to attend courses at Münster university in preparation for studying medicine. In 1887, he started his studies at the University of Greifswald. There he joined a dueling fraternity (&quot;Turnerschaft Cimbria&quot;), but was dismissed &quot;cum infamia&quot; (with infamy). In November 1888, Löns relocated to the university of Göttingen, but returned to Münster without having attained a degree. In fact, he never even enrolled at Göttingen but joined a drinking society called the &quot;Club der Bewusstlosen&quot;. At Münster he studied natural sciences emphasizing zoology at the &quot;Theologische und Philosophische Akademie&quot; from the spring of 1889 to autumn 1890. While there, he developed interests in environmental issues – protecting nature from damage by industrial activity – and in literature. However, he was also arrested in 1889 for disorderly conduct and sentenced to five days in jail for extinguishing gas lights and resisting arrest while drunk.

In the autumn of 1891, Löns decided to quit university without graduating and to become a journalist. He went first to Kaiserslautern, where he worked for the newspaper &quot;Pfälzische Presse&quot;. He was dismissed after five months for being late and for being drunk. Löns then went to Gera where he again became an assistant editor, this time for the &quot;Reußische Volkszeitung&quot;. He also lost that job after three weeks, again for being drunk. Löns then started work as a freelance reporter for the &quot;Hannoveraner Anzeiger&quot;. From 1892, Löns lived in Hanover and as a regional news editor wrote about a wide variety of subjects. Some of his writings with the pseudonym &quot;Fritz von der Leine&quot; were collected as a book &quot;Ausgewählte Werke von Fritz von der Leine&quot;, published in 1902. The year before, Löns had published a collection of poetry and a book of short stories on hunting. In 1902, Löns quit the newspaper and co-founded the rival newspaper &quot;Hannoversche Allgemeine Zeitung&quot;. In April 1903, he became its editor-in-chief, but by February 1904 the newspaper folded due to a lack of funds. Löns then joined the &quot;Hannoversches Tagblatt&quot;, writing as &quot;Ulenspeigel&quot;. It was at this time that Löns began to make a name for himself as a writer on nature, in particular on the heaths of Lower Saxony (&quot;Heidedichter&quot;). In 1906, he published these writings in &quot;Mein braunes Buch&quot; which became his first literary success. Löns became editor-in-chief of the newspaper &quot;Schaumburg-Lippische Landeszeitung&quot; of Bückeburg in 1907, and remained in this position through April 1909. Once again, alcohol consumption was the cause of his dismissal.

Freed from the need to do regular work as a newspaper man, Löns wrote and published several more of his works in 1909, emphasizing animal studies and characterization, including the popular &quot;Mümmelmann&quot;. That same year, he wrote three more novels, two of which were published in 1910, including &quot;Der Wehrwolf&quot;, his most successful book, depicting the bloody revenge of Lower Saxony peasants against marauding soldiers of the Thirty Years War. The poems contained in the collection &quot;Der kleine Rosengarten&quot; (1911) were referred to by Löns as &quot;folk songs&quot; (&quot;Volkslieder&quot;). They included the &quot;Matrosenlied&quot; (&quot;Sailors&#x27; Song&quot;) with the chorus &quot;Denn wir fahren gegen Engelland&quot; (&quot;For we are sailing against England&quot;), which was put to music by Herms Niel and became one of the most-sung German military songs of World War II. 
A number of his poems from &quot;Der kleine Rosengarten&quot; were set to music by Franz Gabriel [1883-1929] in 1927-8 and published in an album with a dedication to the tenor, Richard Tauber, who recorded 13 of them for Odeon in August 1928. Another of his poems, &quot;Das Geheimnis&quot; [The Secret], beginning &#x27;Ja, grün ist die Heide&#x27;, was set to music by Karl Blume and recorded by Tauber in 1932.

== Marriages and divorces ==
Löns had married Elisabet Erbeck (1864–1922), a divorced sales assistant, at Hanover in 1893 (engagement 1890, divorced 1901). She had five miscarriages and was committed to a sanatorium. Soon after the divorce, Löns had changed his confession from Catholic to Protestant and married Lisa Hausmann (an editorial assistant, born 1871), also at Hanover. He had a child with his second wife, but their son was mentally and physically handicapped. In 1911, his family left him, after he fired a shotgun inside their home. In the divorce proceedings he had a nervous breakdown. Löns refused to pay alimony and then left without leaving an address, travelling in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands. In November 1911, Löns considered suicide. In November 1912, he returned to Hanover and subsequently published two more collections of hunting and nature stories &quot;Auf der Wildbahn&quot; (1912) and &quot;Mein buntes Buch&quot; (1913), followed by his final novel, &quot;Die Häuser von Ohlendorf&quot; (1913). Suffering from bipolar disorder, Löns veered between depression and making fantastic plans for the future.

== First World War service ==
At the age of 48, he volunteered for service with the German Army for the First World War. Due to his ill health and weak constitution, he was rejected initially by the military. It took the intervention of an officer friend of his for Löns to be accepted as a common fusilier by the &quot;Ersatzbatallion&quot; of the &quot;Regiment Generalfeldmarschall Prinz Albrecht von Preußen&quot;, also known as 73rd Fusilier Regiment. On 26 September 1914, just three weeks after enlisting on 3 September, Löns was killed in action during an assault on a French position at Loivre near Reims in France. Of the 120 men in his unit, only two dozen survived.

==Reception in National Socialist Germany==

Löns&#x27; books continued to sell well after his death. By 1934, they had reached an overall circulation of 2.5 million books. By 1938, the &quot;Wehrwolf&quot; had sold more than 500,000 copies (reaching 865,000 copies by 1945). This made him one of the most successful authors in Germany at the time.

Löns had considered himself as a poet of nature and he had argued eloquently for conservationism. He was co-initiator of the &quot;Heideschutzpark&quot; at Wilseder Berg which later grew into the &quot;Naturpark Lüneburger Heide&quot; (Lüneburg Heath Nature Park), the first nature reserve in Germany. Löns combined these sentiments, based not least on the &quot;&quot; of the turn of the century (as represented by Adolf Bartels) with an increasingly radical nationalism, the racial concept of an &quot;aristocratic peasantry&quot; (&quot;Blood and soil&quot;), enmity towards the metropolis (Berlin) and xenophobia. His literary work has been categorised as part of the folkish philosophy, although his character was also one of intense individualism.

As some of his writings had included nationalistic ideas, he was considered by the National Socialists as one of their writers. Some parts of his works conformed well with the &quot;Blood and soil&quot; ethos endorsed by National Socialist ideologues such as Walther Darre and Alfred Rosenberg, which lauded the peasantry and small rural communities as the true character of the German nation.

On 5 January 1933, a French farmer found the boots of a German soldier in one of his fields. With the help of the local sexton, he uncovered a skeleton and identification tag. The sexton buried the body in an individual grave in a German graveyard near Loivre. It took almost 18 months for the tag to reach Berlin via the German embassy in France. This tag was subsequently lost during an Allied bombing raid on Berlin; an extant photograph of it does not allow a definite conclusion on whether the tag said &quot;F.R.&quot; (&quot;Füselier-Regiment&quot;) or &quot;I.R.&quot; (&quot;Infanterie-Regiment&quot;). However, on 8 May 1934, the newspaper &quot;Völkische Beobachter&quot; announced that the grave of Löns had been discovered. In October 1934, at the behest of Adolf Hitler, Löns&#x27; purported body was exhumed and brought to Germany. There was not any medical examination to try to verify that these were indeed the remains of the writer.

In 1919, several bodies had been exhumed in the vicinity of the area where Löns was killed and transferred to the war cemetery at Luxembourg. From there they were moved to a mass grave near Loivre, where they remain to this day, according to the &quot;Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge&quot;, a charity. It is quite possible that Löns&#x27; remains were among them.

The exhumed body of Löns was supposed to be buried in the Lüneburg Heath, given his association with the area. However, the exact location of his new grave posed problems. The initial plan to bury him at the Sieben Steinhäuser, a megalithic site, was abandoned since the military at the time had (still secret) plans to establish the military training facility Bergen in the area. An alternative site near Wilseder Berg was rejected due to concerns about the environmental effect of large numbers of visitors to the grave. Finding a suitable burial place became an issue for the top echelons of the regime, including Hermann Göring, Rudolf Heß, Joseph Goebbels, Werner von Blomberg and even Adolf Hitler.

On 30 November 1934, members of the Sturmabteilung (SA), apparently on orders from Goebbels, removed the remains from the graveyard chapel in Fallingbostel where they were awaiting reburial. They buried them near the roadside of what was then &quot;Reichsstrasse 3&quot; (now Bundesstrasse 3 or B3) south of Barrl, near the area known presently as Reinsehlen Camp. However, on 2 August 1935, the anniversary of the start of World War I, on the initiative of von Blomberg, Minister of War, the Reichswehr exhumed the remains and transferred them to the &quot;Tietlinger Wacholderhain&quot; near Walsrode, where an earlier (1929) memorial had been erected, for a ceremonial reburial.

==Legacy==
After 1945, Löns remained a bestselling author. The company that published most of his works estimated that by 1966 they had sold 7.5 million books written by him.

Composer Pauline Volkstein (1849-1925) set Löns’ text to music in her lieder.

The 1932 movie &quot;Grün ist die Heide&quot; (Green Is The Heath) was based on Löns&#x27; writings. It was remade with great commercial success in 1951, featuring Sonja Ziemann and Rudolf Prack, and again in 1972.

In 1956, Dieter Borsche featured as Löns in &quot;&quot;, a German movie based on Löns&#x27; autobiography &quot;Das zweite Gesicht&quot;.

==Memorials==

There are 113 memorials total to Löns in Germany plus eight in Austria and 19 in other countries. Additionally, 247 streets and roads in Germany have been named for him. Twelve schools have his name. Finally, there is Hermann Löns Stadium at Paderborn.

<text>Werner Hegemann (June 15, 1881 – April 12, 1936) was a city planner, architecture critic, and political writer in Germany&#x27;s Weimar Republic. His published criticism of Hitler and the Nazi party required him to leave Germany with his family in 1933. He died prematurely in New York City in 1936.

==Biography==

Hegemann was the son of Ottmar Hegemann (1839–1900), a manufacturer in Mannheim, and Elise Caroline Friedrich Vorster (1846–1911), daughter of Julius Vorster, a founder of Chemische Fabrik Kalk in Cologne. After graduating from Gymnasium Schloss Plön in 1901, he began college studies in Berlin; studied art history and economics in Paris; economics at the University of Pennsylvania (1904–05) and in Strasbourg, and in 1908 completed his doctorate in economics at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. In 1905 he married Alice Hesse (1882–1976) in Berlin. The couple had one child, Ellis, in 1906. After obtaining his Ph.D in 1908, Hegemann returned to the United States (with his wife and child) and worked as a Philadelphia housing inspector. In 1909 he was in Boston, working with the Boston-1915 Movement, a five-year plan to develop and improve the Boston area.

Back in Berlin in 1910 Hegemann was General Secretary of the Universal City Planning Exhibition held in Berlin in May and June of that year. The exhibition aroused great interest and was reprised in refocused form in Düsseldorf; Hegemann wrote an article about it for a general audience and a two-volume official book. These city planning exhibitions were the first of their kind: Hegemann was in the right place at the right time to play a formative role in the early development of city planning as a profession.

In 1912 Hegemann accepted an invitation from Frederic C. Howe, Director of the People&#x27;s Institute in New York, to give lectures on city planning in over 20 American cities. In 1916, while in the U.S., he was divorced from Alice Hesse.

As World War I ended Hegemann lived in Milwaukee, where he was deeply involved in work and writing another book. He had established &quot;Hegemann &amp; Peets,&quot; a firm specializing in city and suburban planning, with landscape architect Elbert Peets. The firm designed the Washington Highlands Historic District, and Wyomissing Park, a &quot;Modern Garden Suburb&quot; in Reading, Pennsylvania. In late 1918, visiting his friend Fiske Kimball at the University of Michigan, Hegemann met Ida Belle Guthe, daughter of Karl Eugen Guthe. In 1920 the couple married at the bride&#x27;s home in Ann Arbor, Michigan. In 1921 Hegemann completed work on &quot;The American Vitruvius: An Architects&#x27; Handbook of Civic Art&quot; with Elbert Peets, a &quot;thesaurus&quot; of civic art for architects, commenting on about 1200 examples of the discipline (published in 1922).

In 1931 he made a lecture tour through South America, visiting Argentina, where he attended a local convention on urban planning at Mar del Plata. Hegemann gave a lecture criticising European aesthetics, patterns and planning of this resort city. 
In February 1933, a few weeks after Hitler took power and contemporaneously with the Reichstag Fire, Hegemann published &quot;Entlarvte Geschichte&quot; (&quot;Unmasked History&quot;), a book critically and sarcastically questioning the origins of and role models for the Nazi Party. He left Germany on the evening before publication. With characteristic irony Hegemann dedicated the book to Adolf Hitler, leading Nazi bookstores to promote it for three weeks before discovering the ruse and banning the book. In the May 1933 Nazi book burnings he was denounced as an &quot;Historical Forger,&quot; with his books burned with the Nazi &quot;Fire Oath,&quot; &quot;&quot;Against&quot; the falsification of our history and disparagement of its great figures! &quot;For&quot; reverence for our past!&quot; After several months in Geneva and France, Hegemann was invited by Alvin Johnson to teach urban planning at The New School for Social Research in New York City beginning in November 1933. That October Hegemann left Europe for the United States with his wife and four young children. He was one of many intellectuals essentially exiled from Germany due to Nazi hostility and persecution. Upon arriving in New York City on November 4, 1933, Hegemann opined that the German people would not tolerate Hitler for more than two more years. He began lecturing at the New School and organizing assistance for intellectuals and scholars detained by the Nazis in Germany, such as Carl von Ossietzky, another German critic of Hitler, who was arrested and imprisoned by the Nazi&#x27;s in the same month that Hegemann left Germany. He also wrote in support of Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal. In 1935 Hegemann began teaching at Columbia University. In 1934 the Nazis seized Hegemann&#x27;s house in Nikolassee, and in 1938 revoked his doctorate. 

Hegemann&#x27;s early years in the United States, along with his strong education and broad interests, made him an intermediary between city planners and architects throughout Europe and on both sides of the Atlantic. In particular, his &quot;The American Vitruvius&quot; refers extensively to European design, taking many examples from his book on the Berlin 1910 exhibition, while in &quot;Amerikanische Architektur und Stadtbaukunst&quot; he informs German architects of American solutions. However, his emphasis on urban planning rather than purely formal considerations and possibly his having not been present during the development in Europe of the Modern Movement in architecture put him at odds with modernists. For example, in 1929 he was forced to retract an accusation that Martin Wagner&#x27;s primary activity as chief of city planning for Berlin was funneling architectural commissions to extremist friends, and he labeled Le Corbusier&#x27;s Ville Contemporaine project for transforming Paris &quot;only &quot;vieux jeu&quot;&quot; (old hat), sarcastically predicting that it was likely to be realized, 

[not] because [the skyscrapers] are desirable, healthy, beautiful, and reasonable from the perspective of urban planning but because they are theatrical, romantic, unreasonable, and generally harmful, and because it is part of the money-making activities of a metropolis, in what is literally the world&#x27;s most international city, Paris, to serve the need for sensation and the vices of native and imported fools.
==Writing==

Hegemann authored the book &quot;Der Gerettete Christus&quot; (Translated as &quot;Christ Rescued&quot;) in 1928. The book discusses a variant of the swoon hypothesis that Jesus did not die on the cross. When the book was published, blasphemy proceedings were filed by Berlin authorities against Hegemann for asserting that Jesus was not crucified.

During the late 1920s Hegemann published two historical books debunking German heroes: &quot;Fredericus&quot; (published in Germany in 1926 with an English translation in 1929), and &quot;Napoleon, or Prostration Before the Hero&quot; (published in Germany in 1927 with an English translation in 1931). In 1931 he made a lecture tour through South America, visiting Argentina, where he attended a local convention on urban planning at Mar del Plata. Hegemann gave a lecture criticising European aesthetics, patterns and planning of this resort city. Back to Germany, he devoted himself increasingly to warnings against the National Socialists in a series of political articles.

==Death==

In New York in early 1936, Hegemann became ill, first diagnosed with sciatica and then hospitalized with apparent pneumonia. His illness developed during a time of great stress, as he worked to support his family after having to leave all his assets behind in Germany. While bed-ridden at Doctors Hospital he worked on his last book, the three-volume &quot;City Planning, Housing&quot;, intended to supplement and update &quot;The American Vitruvius&quot;. Eventually completed by two co-editors, the last volume appeared in 1938. Hegemann died on April 12, 1936, at age 54. The treating doctor opined that the cause of death was tuberculous meningitis.

<doc id="1108139" wikidata="Q131021" url="?curid=1108139" title="Acrocanthosaurus">
<text>Acrocanthosaurus ( ; ) is a genus of carcharodontosaurid dinosaur that existed in what is now North America during the Aptian and early Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous, from 113 to 110 million years ago. Like most dinosaur genera, &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; contains only a single species, &quot;A. atokensis&quot;. It had a continent-wide range, with fossil remains known from the U.S. states of Oklahoma, Texas, and Wyoming in the west, and Maryland in the east. However, most of these remains are assigned to the species based on the assumption that &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; is the only large carcharodontosaurid from North America during this time, and there exists the possibility that some referred specimens could represent distinct taxa.

&quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was a bipedal predator. As the name suggests, it is best known for the high neural spines on many of its vertebrae, which most likely supported a ridge of muscle over the animal&#x27;s neck, back, and hips. &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was one of the largest theropods, with the largest known specimen reaching in length and weighing approximately . Large theropod footprints discovered in Texas may have been made by &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, although there is no direct association with skeletal remains. Recent discoveries have elucidated many details of its anatomy, allowing for specialized studies focusing on its brain structure and forelimb function. &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was the largest theropod in its ecosystem and likely an apex predator which preyed on sauropods, ornithopods, and ankylosaurs.

==Discovery and naming==

&quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; is named after its tall neural spines, from the Greek &quot;ɑκρɑ&quot;/&quot;akra&quot; (&#x27;high&#x27;), &quot;ɑκɑνθɑ&quot;/&quot;akantha&quot; (&#x27;thorn&#x27; or &#x27;spine&#x27;) and &quot;σɑʊρος&quot;/&quot;sauros&quot; (&#x27;lizard&#x27;). There is one named species (&quot;A. atokensis&quot;), after Atoka County in Oklahoma, where the original specimens were found. The name was coined in 1950 by American paleontologists J. Willis Stovall and Wann Langston Jr. Langston had proposed the name &quot;Acracanthus atokaensis&quot; for the genus and species in his unpublished 1947 master&#x27;s thesis, but the name was changed to &quot;Acrocanthosaurus atokensis&quot; for formal publication.

The holotype and paratype (OMNH 10146 and OMNH 10147), discovered in the early 1940s and described at the same time in 1950, consist of two partial skeletons and a piece of skull material from the Antlers Formation in Oklahoma. Two much more complete specimens were described in the 1990s. The first (SMU 74646) is a partial skeleton, missing most of the skull, recovered from the Twin Mountains Formation of Texas and currently part of the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History collection. An even more complete skeleton (NCSM 14345, nicknamed &quot;Fran&quot;) was recovered from the Antlers Formation of Oklahoma by Cephis Hall and Sid Love, prepared by the Black Hills Institute in South Dakota, and is now housed at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh. The specimen is the largest and includes the only known complete skull and forelimb. Skeletal elements of OMNH 10147 are almost the same size as comparable bones in NCSM 14345, indicating an animal of roughly the same size, while the holotype and SMU 74646 are significantly smaller.

The presence of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; in the Cloverly Formation was established in 2012 with the description of another partial skeleton (UM 20796). The specimen, consisting of parts of two vertebrae, partial pubic bones, a femur, a partial fibula, and fragments, represents a juvenile animal. It came from a bonebed in the Bighorn Basin of north-central Wyoming, and was found near the shoulder blade of a &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot;. An assortment of other fragmentary theropod remains from the formation may also belong to &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, which may be the only large theropod in the Cloverly Formation.

Unlike many other dinosaur genera, much less large theropods, &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; inhabited both the western and eastern regions of the North American continent. The presence of the genus in the Arundel Formation of Maryland (roughly concurrent with the western formations) had long been suspected, with teeth almost identical to &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; previously known from the formation. In 2024, an incomplete theropod skeleton (USNM 466054) from the Arundel Formation was identified as that of a subadult &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, referred to as &quot;A.&quot; cf. &quot;atokensis&quot;, marking the first definitive record of the genus from eastern North America. This skeleton, the most completely known theropod specimen from the formation despite its fragmentary nature, had been previously identified as an ornithomimosaur until this study, and also represents the smallest known individual of the genus.

&quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; may be known from less complete remains outside of Oklahoma, Texas, Wyoming, and Maryland. A tooth from southern Arizona has been referred to the genus, and matching tooth marks have been found in sauropod bones from the same area. Many other teeth and bones from various geologic formations throughout the western United States have also been referred to &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, but most of these have been misidentified; there is, however, some disagreement with this assessment regarding fossils from the Cloverly Formation.

==Description==

&quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was among the largest theropods known to exist, with an estimated skull length of and body length of based on the largest known specimen (NCSM 14345). Researchers have yielded body mass estimates for this specimen between based on various techniques.

===Skull===

The skull of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, like most other allosauroids, was long, low and narrow. The weight-reducing opening in front of the eye socket (antorbital fenestra) was quite large, more than a quarter of the length of the skull and two-thirds of its height. The outside surface of the maxilla (upper jaw bone) and the upper surface of the nasal bone on the roof of the snout were not nearly as rough-textured as those of &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; or &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;. Long, low ridges arose from the nasal bones, running along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye, where they continued onto the lacrimal bones. This is a characteristic feature of all allosauroids. Unlike &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, there was no prominent crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye. The lacrimal and postorbital bones met to form a thick brow over the eye, as seen in carcharodontosaurids and the unrelated abelisaurids. Nineteen curved, serrated teeth lined each side of the upper jaw, but a tooth count for the lower jaw has not been published. &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; teeth were wider than those of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; and did not have the wrinkled texture that characterized the carcharodontosaurids. The dentary (tooth-bearing lower jaw bone) was squared off at the front edge, as in &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, and shallow, while the rest of the jaw behind it became very deep. &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; and &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; shared a thick horizontal ridge on the outside surface of the surangular bone of the lower jaw, underneath the articulation with the skull.

===Postcranial skeleton===
The most notable feature of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was its row of tall neural spines, located on the vertebrae of the neck, back, hips and upper tail, which could be more than 2.5 times the height of the vertebrae from which they extended. Other dinosaurs also had high spines on the back, sometimes much higher than those of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;. For instance, the African genus &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; had spines nearly tall, about 11 times taller than the bodies of its vertebrae. The lower spines of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; had attachments for powerful muscles like those of modern bison, probably forming a tall, thick ridge down its back. The function of the spines remains unknown, although they may have been involved in communication, fat storage, muscle or temperature control. All of its cervical (neck) and dorsal (back) vertebrae had prominent depressions (pleurocoels) on the sides, while the caudal (tail) vertebrae bore smaller ones. This is more similar to carcharodontosaurids than to &quot;Allosaurus&quot;.

Aside from its vertebrae, &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; had a typical allosauroid skeleton. &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was bipedal, with a long, heavy tail counterbalancing the head and body, maintaining its center of gravity over its hips. Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; but were otherwise similar: each hand bore three clawed digits. Unlike many smaller fast-running dinosaurs, its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals, suggesting that &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was not a fast runner. Unsurprisingly, the hind leg bones of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; were proportionally more robust than its smaller relative &quot;Allosaurus&quot;. Its feet had four digits each, although as is typical for theropods, the first was much smaller than the rest and did not make contact with the ground.

==Classification and systematics==
&quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; is classified in the superfamily Allosauroidea within the infraorder Tetanurae. This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones on top of the snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae, among other features. It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000. Most studies have found it to be a member of the related family Carcharodontosauridae.

At the time of its discovery, &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; and most other large theropods were known from only fragmentary remains, leading to highly variable classifications for this genus. J. Willis Stovall and Wann Langston Jr. first assigned it to the &quot;Antrodemidae&quot;, the equivalent of the Allosauridae, but it was transferred to the Megalosauridae, a wastebasket taxon, by Alfred Sherwood Romer in 1956. To other authors, the long spines on its vertebrae suggested a relationship with &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;. This interpretation of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; as a spinosaurid persisted into the 1980s, and was repeated in the semi-technical dinosaur books of the time.

Tall spined vertebrae from the Early Cretaceous of England were once considered to be very similar to those of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, and in 1988 Gregory S. Paul named them as a second species of the genus, &quot;A. altispinax&quot;. These bones were originally assigned to &quot;Altispinax&quot;, an English theropod otherwise known only from teeth, and this assignment led to at least one author proposing that &quot;Altispinax&quot; itself was a synonym of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;. These vertebrae were later assigned to the new genus &quot;Becklespinax&quot;, separate from both &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; and &quot;Altispinax&quot;.

Most cladistic analyses including &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; have found it to be a carcharodontosaurid, usually in a basal position relative to &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; of Africa and &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; from South America. It has often been considered the sister taxon to the equally basal &quot;Eocarcharia&quot;, also from Africa. &quot;Neovenator&quot;, discovered in England, is often considered an even more basal carcharodontosaurid, or as a basal member of a sister group called Neovenatoridae. This suggests that the family originated in Europe and then dispersed into the southern continents (at the time united as the supercontinent Gondwana). If &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was a carcharodontosaurid, then dispersal would also have occurred into North America. All known carcharodontosaurids lived during the early-to-middle Cretaceous period.
The following cladogram after Novas et al., 2013, shows the placement of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; within Carcharodontosauridae.

Cau (2024) recovered similar results for &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;. His results are shown below.

In the description of the carcharodontosaurid &quot;Tameryraptor&quot;, it is noted the specimen NCSM 14345 possesses several differences from the type specimen of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus atokensis&quot;, seen listed below:
* The antorbital fossa is separated dorsally and ventrally by an anterior expansion of the lateral lamina.
* A narrow orbital margin with an antorbital fossa that is restricted to the antorbital part of the jugal.
* A wide, dorsally bifurcated supraoccipital crest.
* A wide angle between the occiput in the braincase and the posterior skull roof.
* The absence of a ridge extending from the dorsal rim of the paroccipital process medially below the posterior exit of the mid-cerebral vein.
* A completely split trigeminal foramen.
* Wider pneumatic pockets next to the occipital condyle.
* Ventral indentation of the articular surface of the occipital condyle.
* The distal shaft of the tibia is straight.

While beyond the scope of their paper, the authors note that these differences may be grounds for a reexamination of North American carcharodontosaurid material, and may suggest a much richer diversity than once thought.

==Paleobiology==
===Growth and longevity===

From the bone features of the holotype OMNH 10146 and NCSM 14345, it is estimated that &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; required at least 12 years to fully grow. This number may have been much higher because in the process of bones remodeling and the growth of the medullary cavity, some Harris lines were lost. If accounting for these lines, then &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; needed 18–24 years to be mature.

===Bite force=== 
The bite force of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was studied and compared with that of 33 other dinosaurs by Sakamoto et al. (2022). According to the results, its bite force at the anterior part of the jaws was 8,266 newtons, while the posterior bite force was estimated to be 16,894 newtons.

===Forelimb function===

Like those of most other non-avian theropods, &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; forelimbs did not make contact with the ground and were not used for locomotion; instead, they served a predatory function. The discovery of a complete forelimb (NCSM 14345) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;. The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating. In many of the joints, the bones did not fit together exactly, indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints, as is seen in many living archosaurs. Among other findings, the study suggested that, in a resting position, the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backward slightly, the elbow bent, and the claws facing medially (inwards).
The shoulder of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was limited in its range of motion compared to that of humans. The arm could not swing in a complete circle, but could retract (swing backward) 109° from the vertical, so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards. Protraction (swinging forward) was limited to only 24° past the vertical. The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when adducting (swinging downwards) but could abduct (swing upwards) to 9° above horizontal. Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans, with a total range of motion of only 57°. The arm could not completely extend (straighten), nor could it flex (bend) very far, with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm. The radius and ulna (forearm bones) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or supination (twisting) as in human forearms.
None of the carpals (wrist bones) fit together precisely, suggesting the presence of a large amount of cartilage in the wrist, which would have stiffened it. All of the digits were able to hyperextend (bend backward) until they nearly touched the wrist. When flexed, the middle digit would converge towards the first digit, while the third digit would twist inwards. The first digit of the hand bore the largest claw, which was permanently flexed so that it curved back towards the underside of the hand. Likewise, the middle claw may have been permanently flexed, while the third claw, also the smallest, was able to both flex and extend. After determining the ranges of motion in the joints of the forelimb, the study went on to hypothesize about the predatory habits of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;. The forelimbs could not swing forward very far, unable even to scratch the animal&#x27;s own neck. Therefore, they were not likely to have been used in the initial capture of prey and &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; probably led with its mouth when hunting. On the other hand, the forelimbs were able to retract towards the body very strongly. Once prey had been seized in the jaws, the heavily muscled forelimbs may have retracted, holding the prey tightly against the body and preventing escape. As the prey animal attempted to pull away, it would only have been further impaled on the permanently flexed claws of the first two digits. The extreme hyperextensibility of the digits may have been an adaptation allowing &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; to hold struggling prey without fear of dislocation. Once the prey was trapped against the body, &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; may have dispatched it with its jaws. Another possibility is that &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; held its prey in its jaws, while repeatedly retracting its forelimbs, tearing large gashes with its claws. Other less probable theories have suggested the forelimb range of motion being able to grasp onto the side of a sauropod and clinging on to topple the sauropods of smaller stature, though this is unlikely due to &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; having a rather robust leg structure compared to other similarly structured theropods.

===Brain and inner ear structure===
In 2005, scientists reconstructed an endocast (replica) of an &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; cranial cavity using computed tomography (CT scanning) to analyze the spaces within the holotype braincase (OMNH 10146). In life, much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid, in addition to the brain itself. However, the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created. While the brain is similar to many theropods, it is most similar to that of allosauroids. It most resembles the brains of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; rather than those of &quot;Allosaurus&quot; or &quot;Sinraptor&quot;, providing support for the hypothesis that &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was a carcharodontosaurid.

The brain was slightly sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much expansion of the cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This is in keeping with the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground, as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture.

===Possible footprints===

The Glen Rose Formation of central Texas preserves many dinosaur footprints, including large, three-toed theropod prints. The most famous of these trackways was discovered along the Paluxy River in Dinosaur Valley State Park, a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, although several other sites around the state have been described in the literature. It is impossible to say what animal made the prints, since no fossil bones have been associated with the trackways. However, scientists have long considered it likely that the footprints belong to &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;. A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose footprints to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus. However, the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;. Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age, and the only large theropod known from those formations is &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;, the study concluded that &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was most likely to have made the tracks.

The famous Glen Rose trackway on display in New York City includes theropod footprints belonging to several individuals which moved in the same direction as up to twelve sauropod dinosaurs. The theropod prints are sometimes found on top of the sauropod footprints, indicating that they were formed later. This has been put forth as evidence that a small pack of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was stalking a herd of sauropods. While interesting and plausible, this hypothesis is difficult to prove and other explanations exist. For example, several solitary theropods may have moved through in the same direction at different times after the sauropods had passed, creating the appearance of a pack stalking its prey. The same can be said for the purported &quot;herd&quot; of sauropods, who also may or may not have been moving as a group. At a point where it crosses the path of one of the sauropods, one of the theropod trackways is missing a footprint, which has been cited as evidence of an attack. However, other scientists doubt the validity of this interpretation because the sauropod did not change gait, as would be expected if a large predator were hanging onto its side.

===Pathology===

The skull of the &quot;Acrocanthosaurus atokensis&quot; holotype shows light exostotic material on the squamosal. The neural spine of the eleventh vertebra was fractured and healed while the neural spine of its third tail vertebra had an unusual hook-like structure.

==Paleoecology==
Definite &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; fossils have been found in the Twin Mountains Formation of northern Texas, the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly Formation of north-central Wyoming and the Arundel Formation in Maryland. These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. Based on changes in ammonite taxa, the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, which may contain &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation. This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage, which lasted from 125 to 112 million years ago. The Antlers Formation contains fossils of &quot;Deinonychus&quot; and &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot;, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation, which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the Antlers. Therefore, &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago.

During this time, the area preserved in the Twin Mountains and Antlers formations was a large floodplain that drained into a shallow inland sea. A few million years later, this sea would expand to the north, becoming the Western Interior Seaway and dividing North America in two for nearly the entire Late Cretaceous. The presence of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; in the Arundel Formation suggests that it had managed to spread across the continent before the seaway could impede it. The Glen Rose Formation represents a coastal environment, with possible &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; tracks preserved in mudflats along the ancient shoreline. As &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; was a large predator, it is expected that it had an extensive home range and lived in many different environments in the area. Potential prey animals include sauropods like &quot;Astrodon&quot; or possibly even the enormous &quot;Sauroposeidon&quot;, as well as large ornithopod like &quot;Tenontosaurus&quot;. The smaller theropod &quot;Deinonychus&quot; also prowled the area but at in length, most likely provided only minimal competition, or even food, for &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;.

<text>The 1957 African Cup of Nations was the 1st edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, the football championship of Africa organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). The competition took place between 10 and 16 February 1957. It was hosted by Sudan.

Organized by the African football continental association CAF, only three teams took part: Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan. South Africa, which had originally been registered, was excluded from the tournament due to its refusal to enter a multi-ethnic team, so only two games took place. Both games were played in the Municipal Stadium in the Sudanese capital Khartoum. Egypt won the tournament and became the first African football champions in history.

== Context ==

On the African continent, South Africa created the South African Football Association in 1892, then joined FIFA in 1910, before leaving in 1924 and returning in 1952. Then, Egypt created its federation on 3 December 1921 and joined FIFA in 1923; then Sudan created its federation while it was under Anglo-Egyptian domination in 1936 and joined FIFA in 1948. Finally, Ethiopia created its federation in 1943 and joined FIFA under the name of Abyssinia in 1952. These were the first nations to organize themselves into an independent selection and to join FIFA.

The integration of these four African nations into FIFA was incomplete and this was evident in the organisation of the World Cup qualifiers: in 1934, only Egypt took part in the World Cup qualifiers (against Mandatory Palestine) in the Africa–Asia group and took part in the 1934 World Cup, making it the first African nation in the World Cup. In 1938, Egypt was transferred to a European group but withdrew. In 1950, no team was registered and in 1954, only Egypt played in the qualifiers in the European zone against Italy. The involvement of African teams in the qualifiers was either with Asia or Europe and this led to the idea of creating an African confederation.

== Overview ==
South Africa was drawn to play Ethiopia in the semi-finals, but were disqualified due to apartheid. Ethiopia therefore had a bye to the final, whilst in the other semi-final at Municipal Stadium in Khartoum, the Egyptians beat the host nation 2–1. In the final, Egypt beat Ethiopia 4–0, with all four goals scored by El-Diba, who finished the tournament as top scorer with five goals. Only two games were played in this first edition.

== Participating teams ==

Four teams were due to take part in the tournament: Egypt, Sudan, Ethiopia and South Africa, but the latter was disqualified from participating due to problems related to Apartheid.

<doc id="1108158" wikidata="Q830166" url="?curid=1108158" title="Ohi Day">
<text>Ohi Day (; ) is celebrated throughout Greece, Cyprus and the Greek communities around the world on 28 October each year. &quot;Ohi Day&quot; commemorates the rejection by the Greek dictator Ioannis Metaxas of the ultimatum made by Italian dictator Benito Mussolini on 28 October 1940 and the subsequent Hellenic counterattack against the invading Italian forces at the mountains of Pindus during the Greco-Italian War and Greek resistance during the Axis occupation.

==Ultimatum==
Shortly after 03:00 am on 28 October 1940, the Italian ambassador to Greece, Emanuele Grazzi, came from a party in the Italian embassy in Athens and visited Metaxas. He presented Metaxas with an ultimatum: allow Axis forces to enter Greek territory and occupy certain unspecified &quot;strategic locations&quot; or otherwise face war. Metaxas allegedly answered with a single laconic word: &quot;όχι&quot; (No!). However, his actual reply was, “&quot;Alors, c’est la guerre!&quot;” (Then it is war!).

In response to Metaxas&#x27;s refusal, Italian troops stationed in Albania, then an Italian protectorate, attacked the Greek border at 05:30 am – the beginning of Greece&#x27;s participation in World War II (see Greco-Italian War and the Battle of Greece).

On the morning of 28 October, the Greek population took to the streets, irrespective of political affiliation, shouting &#x27;ohi&#x27;. From 1942, it was celebrated as Ohi Day, first mostly among the members of the resistance and after the war by all the Greeks.
==More information==

During the war, 28 October was commemorated yearly in Greece and Cyprus, as well as by Greek communities around the world. After World War II, it became a public holiday in Greece and Cyprus. The events of 1940 are commemorated every year with military and student parades and on every anniversary, most public buildings and residences are decorated with national flags. Schools and all places of work are closed.

<text>Carcharodontosaurus (; ) is a genus of large carnivorous theropod dinosaur that lived in Northwest Africa from about 100 to 94 million years ago during the Cenomanian age of the Cretaceous. Two teeth of the genus, now lost, were first described from Algeria by French paleontologists Charles Depéret and Justin Savornin as &quot;Megalosaurus saharicus&quot;. A partial skeleton initially referred to this genus was collected by crews of German paleontologist Ernst Stromer during a 1914 expedition to Egypt. Stromer did not report the Egyptian find until 1931, in which he dubbed the novel genus &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, making the type species &quot;C. saharicus&quot;. Although this skeleton was destroyed during the Second World War, it was subsequently redescribed as the holotype of a distinct carcharodontosaurid genus, &quot;Tameryraptor&quot;. In 1995, a nearly complete skull of &quot;C. saharicus,&quot; the first well-preserved specimen to be found in almost a century, was discovered in the Kem Kem Beds of Morocco, which was officially designated as the neotype in 2007. In the same year, fossils unearthed from the Echkar Formation of northern Niger were described and named as another species, &quot;C. iguidensis&quot;, though this species might belong to a different genus.

&quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; is one of the largest theropod dinosaurs known, with the type species reaching in length and approximately in body mass. It had a large, lightly built skull with a triangular rostrum. Its jaws were lined with sharp, recurved, serrated teeth that bear striking resemblances to those of the great white shark (genus &quot;Carcharodon&quot;), the inspiration for the name. Though giant, its cranium was made lighter by greatly expanded fossae and fenestra, but also making it more fragile than tyrannosaurids&#x27;. Studies of the bite force and tooth anatomy of carcharodontosaurids have found them to have relatively low bite force compared to other (large) theropods. The forelimbs were tiny whereas the hindlimbs were robust and muscular. Like most other theropods, it had an elongated tail for balance. Many gigantic theropods are known from North Africa during this period, including both species of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; as well as the spinosaurid &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, the possible ceratosaur &quot;Deltadromeus&quot; and unnamed large abelisaurids. North Africa at the time was blanketed in mangrove forests and wetlands, creating a hotspot of fish, crocodyliforms, and pterosaur diversity.

==Discovery and species==
=== Initial finds ===

In 1924, two teeth of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; were unearthed from wall cuts in different foggaras near Timimoun, French Algeria. These sedimens came from the Cretaceous-aged Continental intercalaire Formation. The fossils were taken to the governor of Timimoun, Captain Burté, who gave them to French geologist Charles Depéret later that year. In 1925, Depéret and his colleague Justin Savornin described the teeth as syntypes (name-bearing specimens) of a new species of theropod dinosaur, &quot;Megalosaurus saharicus&quot;. These were the first fossils of theropods to be described from the region. The name &quot;saharicus&quot; refers to the Sahara Desert where the teeth had been found. The genus &quot;Megalosaurus&quot; was a wastebasket taxon, with many new species referred to it without justification, including &quot;M. saharicus&quot;. It was later considered to be a species of &quot;Dryptosaurus&quot; in 1927, though this is unjustified. By accident, another species of &quot;Megalosaurus, M. africanus&quot;, was named by German paleontologist Friedrich von Huene based on the teeth. It is therefore considered a junior synonym of &quot;M. saharicus&quot;. Both syntypic teeth of &quot;M. saharicus&quot; have since been lost, possibly being kept in a collection in Algeria, Paris, or Lyon, and lack distinguishing characteristics from other carcharodontosaurids. In 1960, French paleontologist Albert-Félix de Lapparent reported the discovery of more teeth and several caudal vertebrae from sites in Algeria belonging to &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, though some of these fossils might belong to other genera. Later authors have mentioned finds of teeth and isolated fossils from other provinces of Algeria.

However, fossils referred to &quot;C. saharicus&quot; were first found in marls near Ain Gedid, Egypt in early April 1914 by Austro-Hungarian paleontologist Richard Markgraf. Marls from this region derive from the Cenomanian-aged Bahariya Formation, one of many Cretaceous-aged sites of North Africa. In Bahariya, Markgraf did extensive collecting of dinosaur skeletons for his employer, German paleontologist Ernst Stromer of the Paläontologisches Museum München (Bavarian State Collection of Paleontology). This Egyptian skeleton (SNSB-BSPG 1922 X 46) consisted of a partial skull, including much of the braincase, teeth, three cervical and a caudal vertebra, incomplete pelvis, a manual ungual, femora, and the left fibula. An isolated ilium was also considered to be from &quot;C. saharicus&quot;, but it is likely from a ceratosaur.

Due to political tensions between the German Empire and then British-owned Egypt, the &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; skeleton took years to get to Germany. It was not until 1922 that they were transported overseas to Munich where they were described by Stromer in 1931. Stromer recognized that SNSB-BSPG 1922 X 46&#x27;s teeth matched the characteristic dentition of those described by Depéret and Savornin, which led to Stromer conserving the species name &quot;saharicus.&quot; However, he found it necessary to erect a new genus for this species, &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, for their similarities, in sharpness and serrations, to the teeth of the great white shark (&quot;Carcharodon carcharias&quot;). World War II would break out in 1939, leading SNSB-BSPG 1922 X 46 and other material from Bahariya to be destroyed during a British bombing raid on Munich during the night of April 24/25, 1944. An endocast was made and survived the war, being the only remaining relic of the specimen. However in 2025, this specimen was redescribed as the holotype of a distinct carcharodontosaurid genus, &quot;Tameryraptor&quot;.

=== Resurgent discoveries, &quot;C. iguidensis&quot;, and confusion with spinosaurids ===

Few discoveries of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; material were made until 1995, when American paleontologist Paul Sereno found an incomplete skull during an expedition embarked on by the University of Chicago. This skull (SGM-Din 1) was found in the Cenomanian-aged rocks of the Lower Douira Formation, Kem Kem Beds in Errachidia, southeastern Morocco. The specimen was taken to the University of Chicago and described in 1996 by Sereno and colleagues. In 2007, SGM-Din 1 was officially designated as the neotype of &quot;C. saharicus&quot; due to the loss of other specimens and the similar age and geographic location to previously noted material. The taxonomy of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; was discussed by Chiarenza and Cau (2016), who suggested that the neotype of &quot;C. saharicus&quot; was similar but distinct from the holotype in the morphology of the maxillary interdental plates. However, paleontologist Mickey Mortimer put forward that the suggested difference between the &quot;C. saharicus&quot; neotype and holotype was actually due to damage to the neotype. Because the neotype designation was in accordance with ICZN article 75.4, the describers of &quot;Tameryraptor&quot; agreed that SGM-Din 1 is a valid neotype.

Several other fossils of &quot;C. saharicus&quot; have been unearthed from the Kem Kem Beds, such as dentary fragments, a cervical vertebra, and many teeth. Sereno et al. also referred a multitude of cervical vertebrae described as the spinosaurids &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; and &quot;&quot;Spinosaurus&quot; B&quot; to &quot;C. saharicus&quot; reasoning that stout cervicals would be needed to carry the skulls of carcharodontosaurids. Later research proved otherwise, with the vertebrae being placed in &quot;Spinosaurus aegyptiacus&quot; by Ibrahim et al. (2020). French paleontologist René Lavocat was the first to note the possible presence of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; in Morocco as early as 1954.

In 2007, a novel species of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus, C. iguidensis,&quot; was dubbed by paleontologists Steve Brusatte and Paul Sereno. Fossils of &quot;C. iguidensis&quot; had been uncovered during an expedition to the Echkar Formation of Iguidi, Niger, a partial maxilla (MNN IGU2) being designated the holotype. The species name &quot;iguidensis&quot; is after Iguidi, where the fossils were unearthed. Several other remains such as a braincase, a lacrimal, a dentary, a cervical vertebra, and a collection of teeth were referred to &quot;C. iguidensis&quot; based on size and supposed similarities to other &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; bones. Chiarenza and Cau (2016) identified the referred material of &quot;C. iguidensis&quot; as belonging to &quot;Sigilmassasaurus&quot; (later referred to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; sp.) and a non-carcharodontosaurine, and therefore chose to limit &quot;C. iguidensis&quot; to the holotype pending future research. Another carcharodontosaurid from the Kem Kem Beds, &quot;Sauroniops pachytholus&quot;, was dubbed in 2012 based on a single frontal, and has been proposed to be synonymous with &quot;C. saharicus&quot;. This proposed synonymy has been disputed by others, though the describers of &quot;Tameryraptor&quot; suggested that &quot;Sauroniops&quot; is a &quot;nomen dubium&quot; as they considered the holotype to be too fragmentary. The South American genus &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; was synonymized with &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; by Figueiredo (1998) and Paul (2010), but no authors have since followed this assessment.

==== Other referred specimens ====
* Lapparent (1951, 1960) described several &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; teeth from the Continental intercalaire Formation of Guermessa, Tunisia.
* A postorbital bone and several postcranial remains assigned to &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; were found in the Elrhaz Formation of northern Niger. Taquet (1976) noted that the postorbital was similar to that of &quot;Acrocanthosaurus,&quot; a relative of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, while the postcranial fossils could belong to other theropods.
* Two braincase fragments, 137 teeth, two caudal vertebrae, and a manual phalanx from the Echkar Formation were referred to as &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; by Lapparent (1960). A pedal phalanx had also been described as &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; but it likely is from a spinosaurid instead.
* Many vertebrae, including two associated dorsals, were found in the Early Cretaceous strata of the Irhazer Group of Agadez, Niger. Lapparent mentioned these fossils as &quot;C. saharicus&quot; in 1960, though they may belong to other theropod genera.
* Caudal vertebrae from the Tefidet and teeth from Akarazeras sites of the Continental intercalaire Formation of Agadez, Niger were recorded by Lapparent (1960) and Taquet (1976) respectively. The vertebrae could be from other theropods.
* From an unknown locale in the Continental intercalaire of the Sahara Desert, Lapparent (1960) documented eight vertebrae, a humerus, and a manual phalanx as coming from &quot;C. saharicus.&quot; These elements could be from other theropods.
* Two papers, the first in 1978, have described teeth and a caudal vertebra of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; from the Chenini Formation of southern Tunisia. However, the caudal vertebra is now labeled Carcharodontosauridae indet.
* A 1999 paper described several vertebrae and limb elements of a carcharodontosaurid which were unearthed from the Wadi Milk Formation of Sudan. These were placed only as carcharodontosaurid, but researcher Mickey Mortimer proposed that they belong to &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; itself based on the presence of pleurocoels (shallow openings) in the caudal vertebrae.
* In 2015, a large neural arch of a dorsal vertebra from the Kem Kem Beds was informally described as belonging to a new genus and species of megaraptoran dubbed &quot;Osteoporosia gigantea&quot;. This specimen is owned by the head of a Polish theme park chain who described it as belonging to a long carnosaur similar to &quot;Mapusaurus&quot; and &quot;Carcharodontosaurus.&quot; However, it was much smaller than proposed and may belong to &quot;C. saharicus&quot; or &quot;Sauroniops&quot; based on its carcharodontosaurid traits and origin.

==== Previously assigned specimens ====

* A maxillary tooth recovered from the Villar del Arzobispo Formation of Spain was referred to &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; in 1966. However, it lacks the traits of carcharodontosaurid teeth and instead is more similar to that of other allosauroids.
* Bond and Bromley (1970) described teeth deriving from the Gokwe Formation of Zimbabwe as being similar to &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, with Mickey Mortimer assigning them to the genus tentatively. However, later studies have found them to be indeterminate.
* Teeth from the Alcantara Formation of Brazil were placed in &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; in 2002, but this has been disputed based on its geographic origin.
* Partial specimens from Wadi Milk Formation were originally assigned to &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, but were now considered to be indeterminate carcharodontosaurids, some of which are similar to the genus.
* Fossils from the Campanian Quseir Formation of western Egypt have been tentatively assigned to &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, but these specimens were never described in detail and thus classified as Theropoda indet.

==Description==
=== Size ===
Stromer hypothesized that &quot;C. saharicus&quot; was around the same size as the tyrannosaurid &quot;Gorgosaurus&quot;, which would place it at around long, based on his specimen SNSB-BSPG 1922 X 46 (now &quot;Tameryraptor&quot;). This individual was around 15% smaller than the neotype, the latter was estimated to be in length and approximately in body mass. This makes &quot;Carcharodontosaurus saharicus&quot; one of the largest known theropod dinosaurs and one of the largest terrestrial carnivores. &quot;C. iguidensis&quot; was much smaller, only reaching in length and in body mass.

=== Skull ===
==== Cranium ====

The largest and most complete skull of &quot;C. saharicus&quot; would measure when complete, around the same size as the largest &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; skulls. No skulls of the genus preserve premaxillae, complete posterior skull regions, or mandibles. Skulls of carcharodontosaurids tend to be more slender and lightly built than those of later tyrannosaurids, which have robust builds and adaptations for crushing. The neotype cranium tapers towards the front in side view creating a triangular outline. This is similar to that of other carcharodontosaurids like &quot;Mapusaurus&quot; and &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;. Its skull was lighter than that of tyrannosaurids, with the antorbital fenestra composing over 30% of the total skull length as well as being surrounded by fossae in the maxillae (upper jaw bone), nasals (nose bone), jugals (cheekbone), and lacrimals (front orbit bone). Akin to other genera, its nasal is elongated and bears an anterior face covered in a rugose surface. These bumps were likely extended by keratin sheaths, creating a horn-like structure as in &quot;Ceratosaurus&quot;. A similar rugosity is found on the lacrimal which would also be lengthened by keratin, forming a similar element. The most distinctive trait of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;″ skull is the sculpted exterior of the maxillae, which is unique to the genus. However, &quot;C. iguidensis&quot; has antorbital fossae limited to the proximity of the antorbital fenestra, a crest running along the medial face of the maxilla, and a process along its midline. These traits are missing in &quot;C. saharicus&quot;, differentiating the two species.

The maxilla of SNSB-BSPG 1922 X 46 (now &quot;Tameryraptor&quot;) would have been long when complete, whereas the neotype&#x27;s complete maxilla is much larger. 14 teeth sockets are present in each maxilla. Parts of the braincase are known though much of their morphology is the same as &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;″. However, &quot;C. saharicus&quot; has a much more prominent nuchal crest, which overhangs the skull roof. The frontal bones are firmly fused, a characteristic evident in most theropods. The jugals are broad and triangle-shaped. The lower jaw articulation was placed farther back behind the occipital condyle (where the neck is attached to the skull) compared to other theropods. Two dentary (lower jaw bone) fragments which were referred to &quot;C. saharicus&quot; by Ibrahim et al. (2020) have deep and expanded alveoli (tooth sockets), traits found in other large theropods. If like &quot;Tyrannotitan&quot; and &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, the dentary would have 16 alveoli (tooth sockets).

==== Teeth ====
Estimations of the tooth count of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; vary, but a recent estimate of 30 dentary, 8 premaxillary, and 24 maxillary teeth for a total of 62 teeth was made. Carcharodontosaurid teeth are some of the largest of any dinosaur group, with a maxillary tooth from SNSB-BSPG 1922 X 46 being tall and wide. However, they are extremely thin, with most being under a centimeter thick. Serrations are numerous on the anterior and posterior margins, with over 18 to 20 serrations per centimeter of edge in &quot;C. saharicus&quot; and up to 32 per centimeter in &quot;C. iguidensis&quot;. Its teeth are straight, laterally flattened, and spindle-shaped in cross-section. However, dentition towards the back of the mouth became more recurved than those in the maxilla. The posterior margin of these crowns are recurved and convex at its termination. Bowed enamel wrinkles are present on both dorsoventral sides of the crowns. These wrinkles curve towards the marginal serrations, composing a band-shape along the ends.

==== Brain and inner ear ====

In 2001, Hans C. E. Larsson published a description of the inner ear and endocranium of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus saharicus&quot;. Starting from the portion of the brain closest to the tip of the animal&#x27;s snout is the forebrain, which is followed by the midbrain. The midbrain is angled downwards at a 45-degree angle and towards the rear of the animal. This is followed by the hindbrain, which is roughly parallel to the forebrain and forms a roughly 40-degree angle with the midbrain. Overall, the brain of &quot;C. saharicus&quot; would have been similar to that of a related dinosaur, &quot;Allosaurus fragilis.&quot; Larsson found that the ratio of the cerebrum to the volume of the brain overall in &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; was typical for a non-avian reptile. &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; also had a large optic nerve.

The three semicircular canals of the inner ear of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus saharicus&quot;—when viewed from the side—had a subtriangular outline. This subtriangular inner-ear configuration is present in &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, lizards, and turtles, but not in birds. The semi-&quot;circular&quot; canals themselves were very linear, which explains the pointed silhouette. In life, the floccular lobe of the brain would have projected into the area surrounded by the semicircular canals, just like in other non-avian theropods, birds, and pterosaurs.

=== Postcrania ===

Few postcranial elements are confidently known from &quot;Carcharodontosaurus,&quot; though many isolated bones from the Sahara have been referred to the genus without detailed study. Like other carcharodontosaurids, it was robust with small forelimbs, an elongated tail, and short neck. The most complete specimen was SNSB-BSPG 1922 X 46 (now &quot;Tameryraptor&quot;), but it was destroyed. This specimen preserved 3 cervical vertebrae, which were weathered severely. One is an axis and the other two are articulating anterior cervicals which are longer and wider than the axis. The cervical vertebrae of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; are stout and opisthocoelus (concave posterior ends). Cervical vertebrae in this genus, as in &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;, are topped by low neural spines joined with sturdy transverse processes which hung over the pleurocoels (shallow depressions on the sides of centra), which would contain pneumatic air sacs to lighten the vertebrae. The centra of these vertebrae are adorned by keels along their ventral sides. An anterior caudal vertebra was also known, which was platycoelous (flat anterior and posterior ends) and short. This caudal was incomplete, missing much of the neural spine, but had diapophyses that would conjugate with the chevrons. The sides of its centrum were pleurocoelus as well. Two blade-like chevrons were preserved in this individual as well.

The pelvis was incomplete, containing both pubes and the left ischium, though complete pelves are known in related genera. The ischium pointed backwards whereas the pubes pointed forwards, a diagnostic trait of saurischians. The pubes were likely nearly when fully preserved, with shafts that were thin but were transversely expanded at the anterior ends where they connected, creating a V-shape in anterior view. Both femora in addition to the left fibula were recovered, the former element being one of the largest recorded from a theropod at in length. Its femora lacked strong curvature and are mostly straight except for the anterior and posterior ends. The greater trochanter is small but has a notable protrusion, which would attach to the m. caudofemoralis longus muscle of the tail. Its fibula was only long, around 1/3rd the length of the femora. The anterior end was triangular in lateral view with bulging condyles whereas the posterior end is rounded.

==Classification==
===Systematics===

&quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; is the type genus of the family Carcharodontosauridae and subfamily Carcharodontosaurinae. This subfamily contains &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; itself as well as the other carcharodontosaurines &quot;Giganotosaurus, Mapusaurus, Meraxes,&quot; and &quot;Tyrannotitan&quot;; however, these genera make up an independent tribe: Giganotosaurini. Carcharodontosauridae was a clade created by Stromer for &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Bahariasaurus&quot;, though the name remained unused until the recognition of other members of the group in the late 20th century. He noted the likeness of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; bones to the American theropods &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot;, leading him to consider the family part of Theropoda.

Paul Sereno&#x27;s description of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; fossils in 1996 led to the realization of a transcontinental clade of carcharodontosaurids. As more carcharodontosaurids were discovered, their interrelationships became even clearer. The group was defined as all allosauroids closer to &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; than &quot;Allosaurus&quot; or &quot;Sinraptor&quot; by the paleontologist Thomas R. Holtz and colleagues in 2004. &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; is more poorly known than most other carcharodontosaurids, with &quot;Meraxes&quot; and &quot;Giganotosaurus&quot; represented by nearly complete skeletons. Members of the family have been recognized from the Late Jurassic to Middle Cretaceous of every continent except Antarctica.

In their phylogenetic analyses, Kellermann, Cuesta &amp; Rauhut (2025) recovered &quot;C. iguidensis&quot; as a non-carcharodontosaurine member of the Carcharodontosauridae outside the genus &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, suggesting that this species belongs to a different genus. Their analyses found support for a sister taxon relationship of carcharodontosaurids and metriacanthosaurids, which the authors named as a new clade, Carcharodontosauriformes. The results of their analysis using merged OTUs (operational taxonomic units) is displayed in the cladogram below:

=== Evolution ===
Rodolfo Coria and Leonardo Salgado suggested that the convergent evolution of gigantism in theropods could have been linked to common conditions in their environments or ecosystems. Sereno and colleagues found that the presence of carcharodontosaurids in Africa (&quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;), North America (&quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;), and South America (&quot;Giganotosaurus&quot;), showed the group had a transcontinental distribution by the Early Cretaceous period. Dispersal routes between the northern and southern continents appear to have been severed by ocean barriers in the Late Cretaceous, which led to more distinct, provincial faunas, by preventing exchange. Previously, it was thought that the Cretaceous world was biogeographically separated, with the northern continents being dominated by tyrannosaurids, South America by abelisaurids, and Africa by carcharodontosaurids. The subfamily Carcharodontosaurinae, in which &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; belongs, appears to have been restricted to the southern continent of Gondwana (formed by South America and Africa), where they were probably the apex predators. The South American tribe Giganotosaurini may have been separated from their African relatives through vicariance, when Gondwana broke up during the Aptian–Albian ages of the Early Cretaceous.

==Paleobiology==
=== Lifting capabilities ===
A biomechanical analysis of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;&#x27; lifting capabilities was conducted by paleontologist Donald Henderson and paleoartist Robert Nicholls in 2015. The authors used 3D models of the animal as well as a subadult sauropod &quot;Limaysaurus&quot;, which although not found alongside &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;, is similar to the rebbachisaurids of the Kem Kem Beds. The models included the size of the lungs and other pneumatic structures of the two, fostering an accurate weight simulation of the scenario. Henderson &amp; Nicholls&#x27; study found that an adult &quot;C. saharicus&quot; could hold a maximum of , half the weight of an adult &quot;Limaysaurus&quot;. However, two &quot;C. saharicus&quot; adults could together lift as much as .

=== Feeding and diet ===

The dentition of allosauroids is distinct, with carcharodontosaurid teeth bearing distinctly thin and blade-like teeth. However, these teeth are thin and likely could not sustain impact against hard surfaces like bone without potentially bending and snapping. This danger is exacerbated by the straight edges, slightly recurved tips, and sinusoidal shapes observed in their dentition. Despite these traits, the teeth are still much more robust than those of smaller theropods and due to their overall size could take more pressure. &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; also had a high tooth replacement rate meaning that damaged teeth could be replaced easily in contrast to extant bone-crushing mammals who spend much of their energy maintaining their teeth. Evidence of bone-crunching bites is observed in &quot;Allosaurus&quot;, which would engage in ritual face-biting with other individuals and bite into the pelves of &quot;Stegosaurus&quot; as shown by bite marks.

Bite forces of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; as well as other giant theropods including &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; and &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; have been analyzed. Studies reported that carcharodontosaurids had much lower bite forces than &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; despite being in the same size class. The anterior bite force of &quot;C. saharicus&quot; was estimated in a 2022 paper to be 11,312 newtons while the posterior bite force was 25,449 newtons. This is much lower than that of &quot;Tyrannosaurus,&quot; implying that it did not eat bones. Finite element accounts of the skulls of theropods have also been taken, which further supported the idea that &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; ate softer food than tyrannosaurids. Great amounts of stress were recovered in the posterior part of the cranium near the quadrate in &quot;Carcharodontosaurus, Spinosaurus,&quot; and &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot;. The skulls of these theropods had higher relative stress quantities in opposition to that of smaller genera. This indicates that the crania of giant taxa (ex. &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot;) were unstable due to having large pneumatic structures to save weight instead of creating a firm build. However, &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Suchomimus&quot; experienced even greater values of stress meaning that they could only consume light, small prey instead of larger items, which the stronger skull of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; could bite while sustaining the stress.

Isotopic analyses of the teeth of &quot;C. saharicus&quot; have found δ18O values that are higher than that of the contemporary &quot;Spinosaurus&quot;, suggesting the latter pursued semi-aquatic habits whereas &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; was more terrestrial. This is further supported by the taphonomy of &quot;C. saharicus&quot; teeth, which are more often found in land terrains than aquatic ones. &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; was also a homeotherm with an endotherm-like thermophysiology as inferred by these isotopes meaning that most of its oxygen was accumulated by drinking water rather than being in it.

=== Crest function ===
Theropods such as &quot;Carcharodontosaurus, Allosaurus,&quot; and &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; have enlarged lacrimal crests, whose purpose is unknown. Paleontologist Daniel Chure hypothesized that these crests were used for &quot;head-butting&quot; between individuals, but how durable they are has not been studied.

=== Vision ===
A 2006 study by biologist Kent Stevens analyzed the binocular vision capabilities of the allosauroids &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Allosaurus&quot; as well as several coelurosaurs including &quot;Tyrannosaurus&quot; and &quot;Stenonychosaurus&quot;. By applying modified perimetry to models of these dinosaurs&#x27; heads, Stevens deduced that the binocular vision of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; was limited, a side effect of its large, elongated rostrum. Its greatest degree of binocular vision was at higher elevations, suggesting that &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; may have habitually held its head at a downward 40° angle with its eyes facing up accordingly to achieve maximum binocular vision. The range of vision seen in these allosauroids is comparable to that of crocodiles, suggesting that they were ambush predators. They likely sensed prey via motion parallax between prey and background, with a narrow binocular field of vision helping predators judge prey distances and time attacks.

===Pathology===

The neotype skull of &quot;C. saharicus&quot; is one of many allosauroid individuals to preserve pathologies, with signs of biting, infection, and breaks observed in &quot;Allosaurus&quot; and &quot;Acrocanthosaurus&quot; among others. This skull bears a circular puncture wound in the nasal and &quot;an abnormal projection of bone on the antorbital rim&quot;. A later study theorized that this was the result of craniofacial bites.

== Paleoenvironment ==
Fossils of &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; are known from several Cretaceous-age sites across North Africa, similar to the ranges of &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; and &quot;Deltadromeus&quot;. North Africa during this period bordered the Tethys Sea, which transformed the region into a mangrove-dominated coastal environment filled with vast tidal flats and waterways. Isotopes from &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; and &quot;Spinosaurus&quot; fossils suggest that the Kem Kem Beds witnessed a temporary monsoon season rather than constant rainfall, similar to modern conditions present in sub-tropical and tropical environments in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. These riverine deposits bore large fishes, including the sawskate &quot;Onchopristis&quot;, coelacanth &quot;Mawsonia&quot;, and bichir &quot;Bawitius&quot;. This led to an abundance of piscivorous crocodyliformes evolving in response, such as the giant stomatosuchid &quot;Stomatosuchus&quot; in Egypt and the genera &quot;Elosuchus, Laganosuchus,&quot; and &quot;Aegisuchus&quot; from Morocco. Morocco also bore an abundance of pterosaurs like &quot;Siroccopteryx&quot; and &quot;Nicorhynchus&quot;.

The composition of the dinosaur fauna of these sites is an anomaly, as there are fewer herbivorous dinosaur species relative to carnivorous dinosaurs than usual. This indicates that there was niche partitioning between the different theropod clades, with spinosaurids consuming fish while other groups hunted herbivorous dinosaurs. Isotopic evidence supports this, which found greater quantities of sizable, terrestrial animals in the diets of carcharodontosaurids and ceratosaurs from both the Kem Kem Beds and Elrhaz Formation. It also coexisted with the sauropod &quot;Rebbachisaurus&quot; which is found in the Kem Kem Beds. Carcharodontosaurids are represented by &quot;C. saharicus&quot; and &quot;Sauroniops&quot; in the Kem Kem Beds, &quot;Eocarcharia&quot; and potentially &quot;Carcharodontosaurus&quot; in the Elrhaz Formation, and &quot;C. iguidensis&quot; in the Echkar Formation.

<text>The 1962 African Cup of Nations was the third edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, the football championship of Africa (CAF). It was hosted by Ethiopia. Nine countries entered the competition, including the reigning champions Egypt, meaning for the first time a qualification tournament was required. The finals only included four teams. Egypt, as holders, and Ethiopia as hosts, qualified automatically meaning each needed to play only one game to reach the final. Ethiopia won the tournament for the first time, defeating UAR 4–2, after extra time in the final.

This tournament has the highest goals-per-game average in Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.

== Qualified teams ==
This page details the process of qualifying for the 1962 African Cup of Nations. 

Nine nations initially entered the competition, with Ethiopia and Egypt both automatically qualified as hosts and title holders respectively. Sudan withdrew before the draw, and Morocco withdrew before play began, thus leaving five teams vying for the remaining two spots in the finals. This was the first time Sudan did not compete in the tournament.

<doc id="1108175" wikidata="Q1202106" url="?curid=1108175" title="Room on the 3rd Floor">
<text>Room on the 3rd Floor is the debut studio album by English pop rock band McFly. It was released on 5 July 2004 in the United Kingdom via Island Records, and was later issued in the United States by Island Def Jam Records via the iTunes Store.

The album debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart, breaking the world record for the youngest ever band with a number-one album, a record previously held by The Beatles. It reached the top of the charts after selling over 61,000 copies in its first week. The album has been certified 2× Platinum in the UK for sales of over 600,000 copies. The album won Best Album at the 2004 &quot;Smash Hits&quot; Awards. As of 2014, the album has sold over 2 million copies worldwide.

==Background==
In 2001, Tom Fletcher auditioned for pop punk band Busted; it was the same audition Charlie Simpson was at. Fletcher was originally accepted as part of Busted&#x27;s line-up, but Island Records went on to reassess the situation and eventually decided to have the band as a three-piece rather than a four-piece. Though the record label decided against offering Fletcher a place in Busted, they were intrigued by his songwriting talents and later offered him a place on Busted&#x27;s songwriting &#x27;team&#x27;, alongside band member (and already accomplished songwriter) James Bourne, whom Fletcher credits with helping him to compose melodies.

While writing Busted&#x27;s second album, &quot;A Present for Everyone&quot;, Fletcher was asked by the record label if he was available to film auditions for a new band, V. It was at this time that Jones and Fletcher met for the first time; Danny Jones went to the audition mistaking the band to be an instrumental band rather than the conventional, all-singing, all-dancing boy band, for which they were intended. Fletcher was impressed with Jones&#x27; unique style and so approached and invited him to write with himself and Bourne. When writing projects for Busted had come to an end, the two began collaborating for their own (yet unnamed) band and, eventually, moved into the InterContinental Hotel in London for two months, (while still receiving help from Bourne) to concentrate on writing together. Bassist Dougie Poynter and drummer Harry Judd were subsequently recruited via a classified advertisement in the &quot;NME&quot; magazine. The pair, both Essex lads, coincidentally turned up at the same audition and got to talking over their shared appreciation of the band The Starting Line, after Poynter noticed their name and logo was printed on Judd&#x27;s T-shirt.

The album was named after the hotel room where most of the songs were written. The album&#x27;s main songwriters include band members Fletcher and Jones, as well as contributions from James Bourne from the band Busted, as well as some of Busted&#x27;s main producers. The album is directly influenced by three things: modern pop punk, 1960s surfer pop, and tales of unrequited love. The track &quot;Get Over You&quot; is hidden, and does not appear on the track listing. It can be accessed by rewinding into the pregap, prior to the first track, &quot;Five Colours in Her Hair&quot;. The track cannot be accessed if the album is played in a computer. The song was later released as a regular track on the deluxe edition of the band&#x27;s 2012 compilation album &quot;Memory Lane: The Best of McFly&quot;. Four singles were released from the album: &quot;Five Colours in Her Hair&quot; and &quot;Obviously&quot;, which both went to number one, &quot;That Girl&quot;, which reached number three, and the title track, &quot;Room on the 3rd Floor&quot;, which peaked at five. A demo version of the track &quot;Saturday Night&quot; was previously released as &quot;Saturday Nite&quot; on the B-side of the &quot;Five Colours in Her Hair&quot; single. The international version of the album removes the songs &quot;Broccoli&quot; and &quot;Surfer Babe&quot; for contractual reasons. This version also features alternate artwork – the colour of the band logo is altered from yellow to red.

==Critical reception==
Sharon Mawer of AllMusic said of the album: &quot;When a vacancy appears in pop music, it doesn&#x27;t take long to fill it. As Busted moved out of pure pop into more serious material, the way was left open for McFly to capture teenage girls&#x27; hearts with their debut album, Room on the 3rd Floor. Named after the character in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy and sounding like an updated 2000s garage band with close harmonies and raw guitars, McFly opened their album with two number one singles, &quot;5 Colours in Her Hair&quot; and &quot;Obviously,&quot; so Room on the 3rd Floor really couldn&#x27;t fail—and it didn&#x27;t, hitting the top on its first week of release. &quot;That Girl,&quot; the third single released, could have sat easily on a Beach Boys album from the 1960s, or possibly even the early Beatles with the count of &quot;one two three four&quot; before a guitar crashes in. &quot;Surfer Babe&quot; (fairly predictably) and &quot;Down by the Lake&quot; were also Beach Boys-sounding tracks. It&#x27;s not that good, however—just a fun summery mid-2000s pop album from four lads who sound as if they were enjoying themselves singing mostly about girls. &quot;Met This Girl&quot; also took its influences from the Rolling Stones of the 1960s with a touch of Manfred Mann&#x27;s fast-paced blues. &quot;Everybody likes to party on a Saturday night,&quot; claim the lads on the track &quot;Saturday Night,&quot; and if you were about thirteen years old and female, this was the album of summer 2004.&quot;

==Theatre tour==
After a minor supporting slot with Busted, the band announced their very first headline tour in 2004. They started the tour just sixteen days after the release of the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;That Girl&quot;. The tour began on 22 September 2004, and ended on 13 October, with a total of fifteen sell-out dates.

<text>Prithvi () is a tactical surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) developed by Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) of India under the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP). It is deployed by India&#x27;s Strategic Forces Command.

== Development and history ==
The Government of India launched the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program in 1983 to achieve self-sufficiency in the development and production of wide range of ballistic missiles, surface-to-air missiles etc. Prithvi was the first missile to be developed under the program. DRDO attempted to build a surface-to-air missile under Project Devil. Variants make use of either liquid or both liquid and solid fuels. Developed as a battlefield missile, it could carry a nuclear warhead in its role as a tactical nuclear weapon.

The aerodynamic characterization research was conducted at the National Aerospace Laboratories&#x27; 1.2m Trisonic Wind Tunnel Facility.

=== Variants ===
The Prithvi missile project encompassed developing three variants for use by the Indian Army, Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy. The initial project framework of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program outlines the variants in the following manner.
*Prithvi I (SS-150) – Army version &quot;( range with a payload of )&quot;
*Prithvi II (SS-250) – Air Force version &quot;(&quot; &quot;range with a payload of )&quot;
*Prithvi III (SS-350) – Naval version &quot;( range with a payload of )&quot;

== Description ==
=== Prithvi I ===
Prithvi I is a single-stage liquid-fuelled surface-to-surface ballistic missile having a maximum warhead mounting capability of 1,000 kg, with a range of . It has an accuracy of and can be launched from transporter erector launchers. This class of Prithvi missile was inducted into the Indian Army in 1994. As per DRDO&#x27;s former chief Avinash Chander, the tactical 150 km-range Prithvi missile will be replaced with the Prahaar missile, which is more capable and has more accuracy. According to Chander, the Prithvi I missiles withdrawn from service would be upgraded to be used for longer ranges.

As per reports, in the 1990s, 75 missiles were initially ordered and the order was subsequently increased. The missiles are generally paired with conventional warheads but can be equipped with nuclear warheads as well. The units under the Regiment of Artillery, that are equipped with these missiles includes

# 222 Missile Group
# 333 Missile Group (Secunderabad under XI Corps)
# 444 Missile Group
# 555 Missile Group

=== Prithvi II ===
Prithvi II is a single-stage liquid-fuelled missile. Initially, it was developed for an extended range of and maximum warhead capacity of 500 kg. This was gradually enhanced to a range of and 500–1000 kg payload. It was developed with the Indian Air Force being the primary user.

It was first test-fired on 27 January 1996 and the developmental trials were completed in 2004. In a test, the missile was launched with an extended range of and had improved navigation due to an improvement in inertial navigation system. The missile features measures to deceive anti-ballistic missiles.

The missile was inducted into India&#x27;s Strategic Forces Command in 2003. After a failed test on 24 September 2010, two more missiles aimed at two different targets were launched on 22 December 2010 and were successful. According to reports, the range has been increased to and the payload capacity now ranges between 500 – 1000 kg. On 2 June, India successfully test-fired another Prithvi-II missile from the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur, Odisha at 9:50 am.

On 20 November 2019, Strategic Forces Command carried out 2 night user trials of Prithvi-II missiles as part of its annual training cycle to test the combat readiness of its missile forces. Two Prithvi-II tactical surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles were test fired from the Integrated Test Range (ITR) on Abdul Kalam Island in the Bay of Bengal off the coast of Odisha, according to government sources cited in local media reports. The trial of the surface-to-surface missile with a strike range of 350 km was carried out from a mobile launcher from Launch Complex III of the ITR between 7:00 pm and 7:15 pm.

On 4 December 2019, another night trial was conducted off Odisha coast at 07:48 pm from Launch Complex III of Integrated Test Range in Chandipur. The Strategic Forces Command conducted night trial of Prithvi II in full operational configuration from Launch Complex III of Integrated Test Range on 23 September 2020.
=== Prithvi III ===
Prithvi III is a two-stage surface-to-surface missile. The first stage is solid fueled with a 16 metric ton force (157 kN) thrust motor. The second stage is liquid-fuelled. The missile can carry a 1,000 kg warhead to a distance of and a 500 kg warhead to a distance of and a 250 kg warhead up to a distance of .

Prithvi III was first tested in 2000 from , a . The missile was launched from the updated reinforced helicopter deck of the vessel. The first flight test of the variant was only partially successful. The full operational testing was completed in 2004.

==Dhanush (missile) ==
Dhanush () is a variant of the surface-to-surface or ship-to-ship Prithvi III missile for the Indian Navy. It is capable of carrying both conventional as well as nuclear warheads with pay-load capacity of 500 kg-1000 kg and can strike targets in the maximum range of . Dhanush is a system consisting of a stabilization platform and the missile. It is a customized version of the Prithvi and is certified for sea worthiness. Dhanush has to be launched from a hydraulically stabilized launch pad. Its low range acts against it and thus it is seen as a weapon either to be used to destroy an aircraft carrier or an enemy port. The Dhanush missile can be used as an anti-ship weapon as well as for destroying land targets depending on the range. The missile has been tested from surface ships of the navy many times.

===Trial history===
A new variant of the Prithvi-III missile, named Dhanush, was test fired from the &quot;Rajput&quot; in March 2007 and successfully hit a land-based target.

The missile was successfully tested-fired from INS &quot;Subhadra&quot;, which was anchored about offshore from the Integrated Test Range at Chandipur on 13 December 2009. It was the sixth test of the missile.

The missile was test-fired successfully on 5 October 2012, on 23 November 2013, 9 April 2015, and 24 November 2015 from INS Subhadra in the Bay of Bengal off the Odisha coast.

Dhanush was again tested on 26 November 2015 from INS &quot;Subhadra&quot; in the Bay of Bengal.

A successful user trial was conducted from a naval ship on 23 February 2018 by the Strategic Forces Command off the Odisha coast.

<text>The 1965 African Cup of Nations was the fifth edition of the biennial African association football tournament organized by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) hosted in Tunisia from 12 and 21 November 1965. This was the final edition of the tournament to be held in an odd-numbered year before 2013. The growing enthusiasm for the competition and the increasing number of participating teams led to an increase in the number of participants in the tournament, which rose from four to six teams.

Two of them qualified automatically, the host country Tunisia and the defending champion Ghana. A first round was determined by two groups of three teams, then the final (for the top teams in each group) and a third-place match for the teams that finished second.

Ethiopia is the only team to have participated in every edition of the Africa Cup of Nations since its inception. Egypt (twice winner in 1957 and 1959) refused to participate due to the diplomatic crisis with Tunisia. Sudan also failed to qualify after stumbling in the qualifiers. Congo-Léopoldville, Senegal and Ivory Coast are participating in the finals for the first time. Ghana retained its title, beating Tunisia in the final 3–2 after extra time. This was Ghana&#x27;s second African championship title in two participations.

== Teams ==
Four places were available to the thirteen countries participating in these qualifications. Tunisia, the tournament organizer, and Ghana, the defending champion, qualified automatically. 

Egypt qualified from Zone 1 after Morocco and Nigeria withdrew before the start of the qualifiers, but later withdrew due to the deterioration of its diplomatic relations with Tunisia after a speech given by Tunisian President Habib Bourguiba in Jericho in which he called on Arab countries to recognize Israel.

Sudan, called upon to take Egypt&#x27;s place, declined the invitation: a single playoff match was then scheduled in Accra on 31 October between Congo-Léopoldville and Guinea.

However, Guinea withdrew shortly before this date; therefore, the playoff was scratched and Congo-Léopoldville qualified.

<doc id="1108197" wikidata="Q790706" url="?curid=1108197" title="Barnevelder">
<text>The Barnevelder is a Dutch breed of domestic chicken. It resulted from cross-breeding between local Dutch chickens and various &quot;Shanghai&quot; birds imported from Asia to Europe in the later part of the nineteenth century; these may have been of Brahma, Cochin or Croad Langshan type. It is named for the town and &quot;gemeente&quot; (municipality) of Barneveld, in Gelderland in the central Netherlands. The hens are good layers of large brown eggs and, unlike some other breeds, continue to lay well during winter.

== History ==

In the 1850s Asian chickens began to arrive in Europe, where they were at first known as &quot;Shanghai&quot; chickens. These were initially cross-bred among themselves, and only later developed into breeds such as the Brahma, the Cochin and the Croad Langshan. From about 1865, some of these Shanghai chickens were cross-bred with local farmyard chickens in the area of Barneveld. Towards the end of the nineteenth century there may also have been some breeding with a type called &quot;Amerikaanse Nuthoenders&quot; (&quot;American utility birds&quot;), which showed some similarity to the American Wyandotte; it is not known what these birds were, or if they were really American. In about 1906 there may also have been some cross-breeding with British Buff Orpington stock. According to Hans Schippers, the greatest influence on the characteristics of the Barnevelder was from the Langshan, which contributed hardiness, brown eggs, and good winter production.

The name Barnevelder was first used for birds shown at the Landbouwtentoonstelling or agricultural exhibition held in The Hague in 1911. From about this time attempts were made to breed for consistent type and colour. However, when the Dutch Poultry Club discussed whether to accept the Barnevelder as a new breed in 1919, it was found to be too variable. In 1921 a breeders&#x27; association was formed, and the first standard was drawn up. The breed was recognised in 1923.

From about 1921 the Barnevelder was exported to the United Kingdom, where brown eggs were in demand. The birds were at first very variable, with single-laced, double-laced or – mostly – partridge plumage. Partridge and double-laced varieties were included in the British Poultry Standard; the double-laced became the principal variety. There may have been some cross-breeding with Indian Game stock. The partridge variety was added to the &quot;Standard of Perfection&quot; of the American Poultry Association in 1991.

== Characteristics ==

Four colour varieties are recognised by the Barnevelderclub of the Netherlands in both large fowl and bantams: double-laced, double-laced blue, black and white. The silver double-laced variety was recognised – in the bantam only – in 2009, and the silver-black double-laced was recognised in 2014; other varieties are in development. The Entente Européenne recognises two further colours in large fowl – blue and partridge; for bantams it recognises crele and partridge in addition to those recognised in Holland, and lists the blue. In the United Kingdom the four varieties recognised are the double-laced blue, double-laced brown, double-laced silver and black.

== Use ==

A Barnevelder hen lays some 175–200 brown eggs per year, with a weight of about

<text>Acid Pro (often stylized ACID) is a professional digital audio workstation (DAW) software program currently developed by Magix Software. It was originally called Acid pH1 and published by Sonic Foundry, later by Sony Creative Software as Acid Pro, and since spring 2018 by Magix as both Acid Pro and a simplified version, Acid Music Studio. Acid Pro 11 supports 64-bit architectures, and has MIDI, ASIO, VST, VST3, DirectX Audio, and 5.1 surround sound support.

== History ==
Acid was first launched in 1998, as Acid pH1, by Sonic Foundry in Madison, Wisconsin. It was a loop-based music sequencer, in which Acid Loop files could be simply drag-and-dropped then automatically adjust to the tempo and key of a song with virtually no sonic degradation.

A website for budding musicians using Acid technology was set up, named AcidPlanet.com. The software became very popular in the late 1990s and early 2000s among composers, producers, and DJs interested in quickly creating beats, music textures, or complete compositions and orchestrations, that would work with virtually any tempo or key signature.

Sonic Foundry sold its Acid, Vegas, Sound Forge, CD Architect, Siren, VideoFactory, ScreenBlast, and Batch Converter product lines to Sony Pictures Digital in July 2003; the merger resulted in the new Sony Creative Software division. Sony&#x27;s Acid Pro 6 (released in the third quarter of 2006) introduced a full-digital audio workstation that also included MIDI and multitrack audio recording with full support for ASIO computer-audio and VST synthesizer-plugin standards.

On May 20, 2016, German company Magix Software GmbH announced they had acquired the majority of the products in the Sony Creative Software portfolio. These include Acid Pro, Vegas Pro, Movie Studio, and Sound Forge Pro. Acid Pro 8, the first version since Magix&#x27;s acquisition, was announced on January 21, 2018 and released in spring 2018. The update came with new modern features including an enhanced interface, support for 64-bit, additional samples, VST3 support, over 20 DirectX audio effects, the ability to mix in 5.1 surround sound, and new features named Media Manager, BeatMapper, and Chopper.

Acid Pro 11 runs on 64-bit version of Microsoft Windows 10 or 11. Versions do not exist for macOS or Linux.

== Acid Loops ==
&quot;Acid Loop&quot; (trademark), also &quot;Acidized&quot; or &quot;Acidified loop&quot; (generic terms), refers to a sound clip which can be repeated and transposed to form a song with minimal manual adjustment. Acidized loops contain tempo and key information, so that Acid can properly time-stretch and pitch-shift the clip to fit into an existing track structure. An Acidized loop is a specially prepared WAV audio file, which can be created using an audio-editing tool such as Sound Forge. 

The technology was created in 1998 for Sonic Foundry&#x27;s original Acid pH1 software. Sony and Magix later sold series of Acidized loop sample CDs to be used with Acid Pro, as have various third-party companies. Since then, this looping technique has been adopted by the majority of other digital audio workstations on the market, sometimes with competing brand names for the feature, such as Cakewalk Sonar (calling it Groove Clips), and Cubase (calling it Audio Warp). Many DAWs can also directly support Acidized loops intended for use in Acid Pro.

<doc id="1108210" wikidata="Q231439" url="?curid=1108210" title="Antlion">
<text>The antlions are a group of about 2,000 species of insect in the neuropteran family Myrmeleontidae. They are known for the predatory habits of their larvae, which mostly dig pits to trap passing ants or other prey. In North America, the larvae are sometimes referred to as doodlebugs because of the marks they leave in the sand. The adult insects are less well known due to their relatively short lifespans in comparison with the larvae. Adults, sometimes known as antlion lacewings, mostly fly at dusk or just after dark and may be mistakenly identified as dragonflies or damselflies.

Antlions have a worldwide distribution. The greatest diversity occurs in the tropics, but a few species are found in cold-temperate locations, one such being the European &quot;Euroleon nostras&quot;. They most commonly occur in dry and sandy habitats where the larvae can easily excavate their pits, but some larvae hide under debris or ambush their prey among leaf litter.

Antlions are poorly represented in the fossil record. Myrmeleontiformia is generally accepted to be a monophyletic group, and within the Myrmeleontoidea, the antlions&#x27; closest living relatives are thought to be the owlflies (Ascalaphidae). A 2019 study finds Myrmeleontidae to be monophyletic, aside from Stilbopteryginae and Palparinae, which form separate clades closer to Ascalaphidae. The predatory actions of the larvae have attracted attention throughout history and antlions have been mentioned in literature since classical times.

==Etymology==
The exact meaning of the name &quot;antlion&quot; is uncertain. It has been thought to refer to ants forming a large percentage of the prey of the insect, the suffix &quot;lion&quot; merely suggesting &quot;destroyer&quot; or &quot;hunter&quot;. In any case, the term seems to go back to classical antiquity. The antlion larva is often called a &quot;doodlebug&quot; in North America because of the odd winding, spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while relocating, which look as if someone has been doodling.

The scientific name of the type genus &quot;Myrmeleo&quot; – and thus, the family as a whole – is derived from Ancient Greek &quot;mýrmex&quot; (μύρμηξ) &quot;ant&quot; + &quot;léon&quot; (λέων) &quot;lion&quot;, in a loan translation of the names common across Europe. In most European and Middle Eastern languages, at least the larvae are known under the local term corresponding to &quot;antlion&quot;.

==Description==
Antlions can be fairly small to very large neuropterans, with wingspans ranging from . The African genus &quot;Palpares&quot; contains some of the largest examples. &quot;Acanthaclisis occitanica&quot; is the largest European species, with an wingspan, and most North American species approach this size.

The adult has two pairs of long, narrow, multiveined, translucent wings and a long, slender abdomen. Although they somewhat resemble dragonflies or damselflies, they belong to a different infraclass of winged insects. Antlion adults are easily distinguished from damselflies by their prominent, apically clubbed antennae which are about as long as the head and thorax combined. Also, the pattern of wing venation differs, and compared to damselflies, the adults are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about at night in search of a mate. Adult antlions are typically nocturnal, and rarely seen by day.

Males of most species have a unique structure, a bristle-bearing knob known as a &quot;pilula axillaris&quot;, at the base of the rear wing. The abdomen in males is usually longer than in females and often has an extra lobe. The tip of the abdomen of females shows greater variation than that of males, depending perhaps on oviposition sites, and usually bears tufts of bristles for digging and a finger-like extension.

The antlion larva has a robust body, a very plump abdomen, and a thorax bearing three pairs of walking legs. The prothorax forms a slender mobile &quot;neck&quot; for the large, square, flattened head, which bears an enormous pair of sickle-like jaws with several sharp, hollow projections. The jaws are formed by the maxillae and mandibles; the mandibles each contain a deep groove over which the maxilla fits neatly, forming an enclosed canal for injecting venom to immobilise the victim, and enzymes to digest its soft parts. The larva is clad in forward-pointing bristles which help it to anchor itself and exert greater traction, enabling it to subdue prey considerably larger than itself.

Antlion larvae are unusual among insects in lacking an anus. All the metabolic waste generated during the larval stage is stored; some is used to spin the silk for the cocoon and the rest is eventually voided as meconium at the end of its pupal stage.

==Distribution==
There are about 2,000 species of antlion found in most parts of the world, with the greatest diversity being in warmer areas. The best known species are those in which the larvae dig pits to trap their prey, but not all species do this. Antlions live in a range of usually dry habitats including open woodland floors, scrub-clad dunes, hedge bases, river banks, road verges, under raised buildings and in vacant lots.
==Life-cycle==
Apart from pit-trap-forming taxa, the biology of members of the family Myrmeleontidae, to which the antlions belong, has been little studied. The life-cycle begins with oviposition (egg-laying) in a suitable location. The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site with the tip of her abdomen and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays an egg.

Depending on the species and where it lives, the larva either conceals itself under leaves, debris or pieces of wood, hides in a crack or digs a funnel-shaped pit in loose material. As ambush predators, catching prey is risky because food arrives unpredictably and, for those species that make traps, maintaining one is costly. The larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive for long periods without food. They can take several years to complete their life-cycle; they mature faster with plentiful food, but can survive for many months without feeding. In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter.
When the larva attains its maximum size, it pupates and undergoes metamorphosis. It makes a globular cocoon of sand or other local substrate stuck together with fine silk spun from a slender spinneret at the rear end of the body. The cocoon may be buried several centimetres deep in sand. After completing its transformation into an adult insect over the course of about one month, it emerges from the case, leaving the pupal integument behind, and works its way to the surface. After about twenty minutes, the adult&#x27;s wings are fully opened and it flies off in search of a mate. The adult is considerably larger than the larva as antlions exhibit the greatest disparity in size between larva and adult of any type of holometabolous insect. This is by virtue of the fact that the exoskeleton of the adult is extremely thin and flimsy, with an exceptionally low density. The adult typically lives for about 25 days, but some insects survive for as long as 45 days.

==Ecology==

Antlion larvae eat small arthropods – mainly ants – while the adults of some species eat pollen and nectar, and others are predators of small arthropods. In certain species of Myrmeleontidae, such as &quot;Dendroleon pantherinus&quot;, the larva, although resembling that of &quot;Myrmeleon&quot; structurally, makes no pitfall trap, but hides in in a hole in a tree and seizes passing prey. In Japan, &quot;Gatzara jezoensis&quot; larvae lurk on the surface of rocks for several years while awaiting prey; during this time they often become coated with lichen, and have been recorded at densities of up to 344 per square metre.

The larva is a voracious predator. Within a few minutes of seizing its prey with its jaws and injecting it with venom and enzymes, it begins to suck out the digestion products. The larva is extremely sensitive to ground vibrations, the low-frequency sounds made by an insect crawling across the ground; the larva locates the source of the vibrations by the differences in timing of the arrival of waves detected by receptors, tufts of hairs on the sides of the two hindmost thoracic segments.

===Pit-building species===

Funnel-shaped pits are built by members of just 3 antlion tribes: Myrmeleontini, Myrmecaelurini, and Nesoleontini. In these trap-building species, an average-sized larva digs a pit about 2 in (5 cm) deep and 3 in (7.5 cm) wide at the edge. This behavior has also been observed in the Vermileonidae (Diptera), whose larvae dig the same sort of pit to feed on ants. Having marked out the chosen site with a circular groove, the antlion larva begins to crawl backward, using its abdomen as a plough to dig up the soil. Using one of its front legs, it places heaps of loosened particles upon its head which it then flicks clear of the scene of operations. Continuing in this way, it gradually works its way from the circumference toward the center. As it slowly moves round and round, the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper, until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose (that is, the steepest angle the sand can maintain, where it is on the verge of collapse from slight disturbance), and the pit is solely lined by fine grains. By digging in a spiral when constructing its pit, the antlion minimises the time needed to complete the pit.

When the pit is completed, the larva settles down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface, often in a wide-opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone. The steep-sloped trap that guides prey into the larva&#x27;s mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom. The fine grain lining ensures that the avalanches which carry prey are as large as possible.
Since the sides of the pit consist of loose sand at its angle of repose, they afford an insecure foothold to any small insects that inadvertently venture over the edge, such as ants. Slipping to the bottom, the prey is immediately seized by the lurking antlion; if it attempts to scramble up the treacherous walls of the pit, it is speedily checked in its efforts and brought down by showers of loose sand which are thrown at it from below by the larva. By throwing up loose sand from the bottom of the pit, the larva also undermines the sides of the pit, causing them to collapse and bring the prey with them. Thus, it does not matter whether the larva actually strikes the prey with the sand showers.

Antlion larvae are capable of capturing and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods, and can even subdue small spiders. The projections in the jaws of the larva are hollow and through this, the larva sucks the fluids out of its victim. After the contents are consumed, the dry carcass is flicked out of the pit. The larva readies the pit once again by throwing out collapsed material from the center, steepening the pit walls to the angle of repose.
Antlion larvae require loose soil, not necessarily, but often, sand. Antlions can also handle larger granular material which is filtered out of the soil during pit construction. The larvae prefer dry places protected from the rain. When it first hatches, the tiny larva specialises in very small insects, but as it grows larger, it constructs larger pits, and thus catches larger prey, sometimes much larger than itself.

Other arthropods may make use of the antlion larva&#x27;s ability to trap prey. The larva of the Australian horsefly (&quot;Scaptia muscula&quot;) lives in antlion (for example &quot;Myrmeleon pictifrons&quot;) pit traps and feeds on the prey caught, and the female chalcid wasp (&quot;Lasiochalcidia igiliensis&quot;) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax.

Recent research has found that antlion larvae often &quot;play dead&quot; for a variable amount of time (from a few minutes up to an hour) when disturbed to hide from predators. The method is effective; it increased survival rates in patches that use it by 20%. Furthermore, they appear to have maximized its usefulness—further increasing the duration is not likely to convey substantial survival benefits to the larvae.

==Evolution==
The closest living relatives of antlions within the Myrmeleontoidea are the owlflies (Ascalaphidae); the Nymphidae are more distantly related. The extinct Araripeneuridae and Babinskaiidae are considered likely to be stem groups in the Myrmeleontiformia clade. The phylogeny of the Neuroptera has been explored using mitochondrial DNA sequences, and while issues remain for the group as a whole (the &quot;Hemerobiiformia&quot; being paraphyletic), the Myrmeleontiformia is generally agreed to be monophyletic, giving the following cladogram:

The subfamilies are shown below; a few genera, mostly fossil, are of uncertain or basal position. The fossil record of antlions is very small by neuropteran standards. However, some Mesozoic fossils attest to the antlions&#x27; origin more than 150 million years ago. These were at one time separated as the Palaeoleontidae, but are now usually recognized as early antlions.

==Taxonomy==
The supra-generic classification within the Myrmeleontidae is disputed by different authors. Several different schematics have been proposed.

===Stange (2004) classification===
Stange recognized three subfamilies, consisting of Stilbopteryginae, Palparinae, and Myrmeleontinae. Brachynemurinae, Dendroleontinae, and other subfamilies recognized by prior authors were placed in the Myrmeleontinae.

* Stilbopteryginae 
# Stilbopterygini monotypic: &quot;Stilbopteryx&quot; 
* Palparinae 
# Dimarini 
# Palparidiini 
# Palparini 
# Pseudimarini 
* Myrmeleontinae 
# Acanthaclisini 
# Brachynemurini 
# Dendroleontini 
# Gnopholeontini 
# Lemolemini 
# Maulini 
# Myrmecaelurini 
# Myrmeleontini 
# Nesoleontini 
# Nemoleontini 

===Michel &quot;et al.&quot; (2017) classification===
Michel &quot;et.al&quot; recognized just four subfamilies, consisting of Acanthaclisinae, Myrmeleontinae, Palparinae, and Stilbopteryginae.

* Stilbopteryginae 
# Stilbopterygini 
* Acanthaclisinae 
# Acanthaclisini 
* Palparinae 
# Dimarini 
# Palparidiini 
# Palparini 
# Pseudimarini 
* Myrmeleontinae 
# Brachynemurini 
# Dendroleontini 
# Gepini 
# Gnopholeontini 
# Lemolemini 
# Maulini 
# Myrmecaelurini 
# Myrmeleontini 
# Nesoleontini 

===Machado &quot;et al.&quot; (2018) classification===
A subsequent revision by Machado &quot;et.al&quot; recognized a different four subfamilies, notable in the inclusion of the family Ascalaphidae as a subfamily instead of as a sister taxon to Myrmeleontidae: Ascalaphinae, Myrmeleontinae, Dendroleontinae, and Nemoleontinae.

* Ascalaphinae Rambur, 1842
# Ascalaphini 
# Dimarini 
# Haplogleniini 
# Palparini 
# Stilbopterygini 
# Ululodini 
* Myrmeleontinae 
# Acanthaclisini 
# Brachynemurini 
# Myrmecaelurini 
# Myrmeleontini 
# Nesoleontini 
* Dendroleontinae 
# Acanthoplectrini 
# Dendroleontini 
# Glenurini 
# Megistopini 
* Nemoleontinae 
# Nemoleontini 
# Protoplectrini 

===Jones (2019) classification===
Jones dissented with Machado &quot;et al.&quot; and presented an alternative classification, restoring the Ascalaphidae to its traditional family-rank placement, and elevating Palparinae and Stilbopteryginae to family level, leaving only a single subfamily in Myrmeleontidae &quot;sensu stricto&quot;. However, this classification has been rejected by Hévin &quot;et al.&quot; (2023), finding the taxonomic decisions to be &quot;not substantiated, with only the family name Palparidae being mentioned in isolation.&quot;

* Myrmeleontinae 
# Acanthaclisini 
# Brachynemurini 
# Dendroleontini 
# Myrmecaelurini 
# Myrmeleontini 
# Nemoleontini 
# Nesoleontini 

==In culture and folklore==
In popular folklore in the southern United States, people recite a poem or chant to make the antlion come out of its hole. Similar practices have been recorded from Africa, the Caribbean, China and Australia.

The Myrmecoleon was a mythical ant–lion hybrid written about in the 2nd century AD &quot;Physiologus&quot;, where animal descriptions were paired with Christian morals. The ant-lion as described was said to starve to death because of its dual nature – the lion nature of the father could only eat meat, but the ant half from the mother could only eat grain chaff, thus the offspring could not eat either and would starve. It was paired with the Biblical verse Matthew 5:37. The fictional ant-lion of &quot;Physiologus&quot; is probably derived from a misreading of Job 4:11.

The French naturalist Jean-Henri Fabre wrote that &quot;The Ant-lion makes a slanting funnel in the sand. Its victim, the Ant, slides down the slant and is then stoned, from the bottom of the funnel, by the hunter, who turns his neck into a catapult.&quot;

In Japan, both the insect and its pit-traps are popularly known as . This term has since become a stock colloquialism for any &quot;inescapable&quot; trap, whether literal or metaphorical (&quot;i.e.&quot; an unpleasant social obligation).

Antlions appear as antagonists in the 1991 life simulation video game, &quot;SimAnt&quot;, and (in a giant form) in the &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; series, &quot;Grounded&quot;, &quot;Terraria&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Starve Together&quot;, &quot;Monster Rancher 2&quot;, &quot;Mother 3&quot; and in the &quot;Half-Life 2&quot; video game series as an unrelated alien insect species sharing sand burowing traits with the real antlion larvae. The Trapinch, Vibrava, and Flygon Pokémon evolution line is based on an antlion. The fictional sarlacc from the &quot;Star Wars&quot; franchise is often compared to the real-life antlion. It also appears as a predator in the film &quot;Enemy Mine&quot;.

In the third book of Tove Jansson&#x27;s Moomins series, &quot;Finn Family Moomintroll&quot;, a rather large and fanciful antlion appears in the second chapter, depicted as a sand-dwelling predator with the literal head of a lion.

<doc id="1108214" wikidata="Q969296" url="?curid=1108214" title="Raheny">
<text>Raheny () is a northern suburb of Dublin, Ireland, halfway from the city centre to Howth. It is centred on a historic settlement, first documented in 570 AD (Mervyn Archdall). The district shares Dublin&#x27;s two largest municipal parks, Saint Anne&#x27;s Park and Bull Island with its 4.5 km beach, with neighbouring Clontarf, and is crossed by several small watercourses.

The coastal hamlet grew rapidly in the 20th century and is now a mid-density, chiefly residential, Northside suburb with a village core. It is home to a range of retail and banking outlets, multiple sports groups including two golf courses, several schools and churches, Dublin&#x27;s second-busiest library and a Garda station.

Raheny is also a civil parish in the ancient barony of Coolock.

==Location and access==
Raheny runs from the coast inland, with its centre about from Dublin city centre and from Dublin Airport. It is administered by Dublin City Council. The county boundary with Fingal lies close by, where Raheny meets Kilbarrack. Nearby areas include Killester, Clontarf, Artane, Kilbarrack, Coolock and Donaghmede, and the skyline is dominated by Howth Head. Raheny is bisected by the Howth Road (R105) and the R809 (from Bull Island via in turn Watermill Road, Main Street, Station Road) and is also accessed from the Malahide Road (R107), the coastal James Larkin Road (R807) and the R104 (including the Oscar Traynor Road and Kilbarrack Road).

Raheny railway station, opened on 25 May 1844, overlooking the village centre, serves the DART suburban railway system and the Dublin-Belfast main line, and parts of Raheny are served by other DART stations, Harmonstown and Kilbarrack, on the same line. Raheny is also served by Dublin Bus (routes H1, H2 and H3) and has a taxi rank.

Much of the district is situated on gently rising ground, with a bluff overlooking Bull Island at Maywood and Bettyglen, and further rises from the village centre to the station and then to Belmont or Mount Olive, a hill which once featured a windmill. Opposite and beyond Belmont was once an area of sunken land with limestone quarries but this was landfilled, much of it with urban refuse, and then partly levelled and converted into a city park, Edenmore Park, in the late 1960s.
==Historical features==

===Ráth (ringfort)===
Within Raheny lies the remains of a large ringfort (or &quot;ráth&quot;) from which the area gets its name. The ráth extends under the centre of the modern village, from beside the Santry River, including some marshy ground, to the Roman Catholic church, Windsor Motors, the Scout Den and the two St. Assam&#x27;s Churches. Some excavations were carried out in the 1970s, giving an idea of its size (probably c. 110m across) and structure. The old church and graveyard complex behind the village plaza may reflect a remnant of the rath, as does some embankment behind the Scout Den.

During the 19th century, significant changes to the village, especially the centre, occurred, as a result of work on the Howth Road by the Telford Engineering Company; prior to this, the road entered the village at the bottom of the central hill, turning sharply coastwards at the top of Main Street. Works to straighten the road resulted in a reduction of the old ringfort.

===Religious sites===
The ruined St. Assam&#x27;s Church, dating from a 1712 reconstruction of a 1609 building, is believed to be the successor to early religious settlement. The later St. Assam&#x27;s Church, opposite it, was built from 1859, in the period when Roman Catholics regained the right to have their own churches and opened in 1864.

Raheny was also the site of two holy wells. The first of these, St. Ann&#x27;s Well, gave its name to St. Anne&#x27;s Park. The site of this well is still visible under a stone cupola by the boating lake in the park, but it has been dry for several decades, despite efforts by municipal authorities to restart it. The second well, dedicated to the patron saint of the area, St. Assam, lay in the field which now holds the Church of Our Lady Mother of Divine Grace. When last recorded, it was marked by a depression in the ground but was later, in the 20th century, covered over, and its waters diverted into the Santry River.

The &quot;Celtic-style&quot; cross on display in the village (now on the main plaza but previously placed in other locations, including at the junctions of Main Street and Watermill Lane, and of Watermill Land and Howth Road) is a memorial to Marie Elizabeth Hayes, an early female medical graduate and 19th-century medical missionary from the area to India, paid for by locals in the area in which the doctor worked.

===Raheny Heritage Trail and guides===
In 1992, the &quot;Raheny Heritage Society&quot; published a walking guide, the &quot;Raheny Heritage Trail&quot;, which included a general introduction to the area and its history, and a map, and this was reprinted, with only minor changes, in 2000. Large panels describing highlights of the area&#x27;s historical and natural sights in English and Irish, and with maps of the central village area, stand either side of the central crossroads. In 2006 the &quot;Raheny Business Association&quot; placed blue informational plaques, with wording coordinated with the &quot;Raheny Heritage Society&quot;, on or near 15 historical buildings.

===Raheny-on-the-Strand===
There was, at least by the 18th century, a hamlet, a &quot;second Raheny&quot;, Lower Raheny or Raheny-on-the-Strand, in the area of &quot;Black Bush&quot; and by the coastal point known as the &quot;Whip of the Water&quot; - where the Howth Road on its then route, and Fox Stream, met the sea. There was a beach road here, later washed away, then succeeded by the tram line to Howth. The current coastal road, the James Larkin Road, is a later construction.

===Mills and quay===
In the 18th century, Raheny had a water mill near the mouth of the Santry River, in ruins by 1757; this gave the name to the lane from the village down to the coastal road, now Watermill Road. There were also two windmills, a rare item on the map of the Dublin area. One of the latter, mapped as &quot;Old Windmill&quot;, was situated on the Howth Road, on the slope above the Naniken River, and the other, &quot;The Mill of Raheny&quot;, on Belmont hill, where the Capuchin friary now stands. There was also a stone wharf where the lane from the village came down to join the coastal road.

===Crescent Cottages===

Eight cottages in a crescent formation on Station Road near the junction with the Howth Road are among the oldest buildings in the village, having been built around 1790 by local resident Samuel Dick, then Governor of the Bank of Ireland. The cottages served as residences for men who worked on Mr. Dick&#x27;s estate. The cottages are informally known as the &quot;Doh-Ray-Mee&quot; cottages due to their resemblance to piano keys. The cottage nearest to the Manhattan pub was once the village post office. The cottages were willed to a trust to support what is now Springdale School, and aside from one sold, with court permission, to fund capital developments, the rent from the cottages contributes to the running of the school.

==Name==
Several explanations exist for the origin of the name Raheny: one (from Ráth Éanna) is that it means the ringfort of Éanna, an early local chief, another (Ráth Eanaigh) is that the name derives from &quot;eanach&quot;, an old Irish word for marsh or swamp, or for a passage through a swampy area. Yet another (deriving from Rath Ain Abha) comes from &quot;Noble Fortress of the Sea&quot;. Locally, most use Ráth Éanna while officialdom now tends towards Ráth Eanaigh. Until the mid-20th century, many local residents pronounced the English language name as something more like Rahenny or Rathenny, as it was mapped in the 18th century, or Ratheny.

Although there is a range of similar names (such as Rahanna), the name Raheny is nearly unique in Ireland, occurring in just one other locality, a portion of the rural town of Lusk. This once-significant monastic and civil centre in north County Dublin is not very remote but no connection between the two locales is known.

==Natural features==
In addition to the Santry River (historically &quot;Skillings Glas&quot;), Raheny is also crossed by the Naniken River (previously parts of it named &quot;Ballyhoy&quot; after a Raheny townland through which it passes), the Fox Stream and the Blackbanks Stream, all monitored by Dublin City Council. The Santry and the Naniken are shown on many old maps, and one or other of the other two sometimes also appear. The Santry comes from Harristown and Dubber, north of Ballymun, and passes through eastern Santry, and Coolock, then between Harmonstown and Edenmore, to reach central Raheny and then flow on to the sea; it is in the open for most of its course. The Naniken, now culverted for more than half its length, flows from central Santry through Artane, then passes under the railway line in a syphon. Its line is marked by a disused lane from Ennafort to Howth Road, it passes under Ballyhoy Bridge (now hidden under the tarmac of the main road) and comes out of the culvert at the edge of St Anne&#x27;s Park, and forms a feature through the park. From partway through the park, its course marks the boundary between Raheny and Clontarf. Both the Fox and Blackbanks Streams flow from the limestone area above Station Road (which used to hold caves and quarries), one either side of the steep Belmont or Mount Olive hill on Station Road; both flow underground. The Fox Stream runs through Walmer lands, under Tuscany Downs, but is today smaller than historically, as some of its flow is diverted by pipe before the railway, into the already larger Blackbanks Stream. According to a chronicle of the ceremony of &quot;Riding the Franchises&quot;, the Fox Stream used to mark the northern boundary of Dublin City.

A major feature is the nearly beach known as &quot;Dollymount Strand&quot;, on the nature reserve of North Bull Island, which is shared with Clontarf. Parklands include the two largest Dublin municipal parks, North Bull Island itself and Saint Anne&#x27;s Park (formerly the home of the Guinness family of brewing and later banking fame), which is also shared with Clontarf, as well as Edenmore Park (10.25 hectares, with a pitch and putt course, playground and exercise area, and playing fields), Springdale Road Park (along the Santry River) and many small green areas, such as at Rathmore Park, Maywood Lawn and within the Foxfield housing area.

There are walking and cycling lanes on the seafront (one can walk, or cycle on designated cycleways, from Howth to Dún Laoghaire), and also on North Bull Island and in St. Anne&#x27;s Park. The &quot;Raheny Tidy Village Group&quot;, with the support of Dublin City Council, launched a set of three measured walking routes for the Raheny area, the &quot;Raheny Way&quot;, with a guiding noticeboard placed at Raheny DART Station, and a leaflet available at various locations around the area.

==Community organisations and media==
A range of residents&#x27; associations have been established over time but many have faded as housing areas have matured. One of those still functioning, the St Anne&#x27;s Residents&#x27; Association (SARA), with some allied bodies, operates a community hall, CARA Hall, on All Saints&#x27; Drive, while the Grange Woodbine Association has hall facilities on Station Road. One umbrella body, the &quot;Raheny Community Council&quot; operated for a time in the 1970s, while another, the &quot;Federation of Raheny Residents&quot; (FoRR), was active from 1981 to 2011. The Federation organised a range of activities, some in conjunction with the Raheny Business Association and some with the local authority and other official bodies, including strategic plans for the village, Neighbourhood Watch arrangements, community awareness weeks, the charitable Mayor of Raheny campaigns, events for older people, the setting up of the Millennium Clock in the middle of the village, and the moving of the Marie Elizabeth Hayes Cross.

Many other voluntary groups operate in the area, some secular, such as the Raheny Heritage Society, Raheny Toastmasters, Raheny St. John Ambulance Division Raheny Order of Malta unit and Raheny Community First Responders and some church-related, such as the local conference of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the Mothers&#x27; Union. A special form of community organisation was the Maywood Avondale Bettyglen TV Association (MABTVA), which provided a local TV cable service for parts of Raheny (most of Dublin being served by one of two large TV cable companies), using its own receiving station, situated at the back of the old Bettyglen Estate.

The &quot;Raheny News&quot;, a local voluntary production founded in 1975, is a four-page local newsletter, known as the &quot;green paper&quot; due to its distinctive publication material. It is produced weekly throughout most of the year by a group of local people, with some support from the Roman Catholic parish. It was a partial successor to &quot;The Acorn&quot;, a bi-monthly magazine sponsored by the joint Killester-Raheny parish, and then by Raheny parish alone, and to &quot;The Relay&quot;, the magazine of Raheny Community Council. Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland parishes also produce bulletins. Another local paper, &quot;The Raheny Informer&quot;, was published monthly in the 2000s. From time to time, postcards of the area are published.

Raheny is part of the service area of the community radio station NEAR FM.

===Business community===
A number of local businesses, and some civic entities, are members of the Raheny Business Association (RBA), a form of chamber of commerce.

===Environment and Tidy Towns===
Raheny&#x27;s voluntary Tidy Village Group drives activities for the Tidy Towns competition, and has helped the area win a number of civic awards. In 2006, the Raheny Business Association began to sponsor a part-time paid coordinator to help the group in its work. Raheny received a &quot;Highly Commended&quot; rating in the 2008 Tidy Towns competition, and the detailed report noted potential, with some further organisation, to win the competition outright. The following year, 2009, Raheny won the Best Urban Village award and was one of four areas of Dublin City to receive a commendation in the overall Tidy Towns competition. In 2014 Raheny again won the Best Urban Village award in the Tidy Towns competition. Raheny won the bronze medal in its category in the National Tidy Towns Competition every year from 2015 to 2019; the Tidy Towns contest was not held in 2020 due to the Covid-19 pandemic.

The Raheny Way is a project developed by the Raheny Tidy Village group aimed at developing walking routes within the Raheny area. Routes identified take the walker past many historical and environmental attractions in the area. The Tidy Village group also runs community events such a Tallest Sunflower Competition and beach cleans.

==Amenities and business==

Raheny&#x27;s library was opened in 1972 and is Dublin&#x27;s second busiest municipal branch library. Located near the village centre it has a reading garden and recycling centre. Adjacent to the library is the site of the first Catholic School in the village, built by William Sweetman circa 1820, now a solicitor&#x27;s office. The district also holds St. Francis Hospice and St. Joseph&#x27;s Hospital (administered by Beaumont Hospital Board), as well as a small local health centre, a Credit Union branch (the local credit union merged with those of Artane and Coolock), a Garda Síochána station, located opposite the national school complex on All Saints&#x27; Drive, and one of Dublin&#x27;s three driving test centres, at the St. Anne&#x27;s shopping plaza. Local amenities include several shops and small shopping areas. There are several financial institutions, a fitness club and several doctors, dentists and specific and alternative health providers. The area&#x27;s swimming pool, separate from but adjacent to St. Paul&#x27;s College, closed to the public in 2006 after about 30 years of private operation, and was later replaced by an apartment block development.

The main local shopping facility is located in the centre of the village, on Howth Road beside the Santry River. The anchor unit is a SuperValu store. Across Howth Road from the shopping centre proper, are several other retail units and service outlets. Dublin bus routes 31 and 32 serve the shopping centre&#x27;s &#x27;Raheny Village&#x27; stop. Parts of the areas are also served by the Tesco-anchored Kilbarrack Shopping Centre and another in coastal Kilbarrack and Edenmore Shopping Centre, and the nearest large supermarkets are in Donaghmede and at Clare Hall. There are two service stations, one at each end of the area, and there are several motor dealers and vehicle repair locations.

===Hospitality===

In addition to a number of bed-and-breakfasts and guest houses, there are several pubs in the area. These include the Cedar Lounge, the Manhattan, the (Raheny) Inn and the Watermill, and eating places include the Watermill and three restaurants, one of the three old schoolhouses in the village centre, at the top of Main Street, one on Watermill Road, in the former Raheny Hardware building, and one in St Assam&#x27;s, as well as a coffee shop with dinner service, under the main shopping centre.

==Religious institutions==
Raheny has four church buildings in the village core, active Roman Catholic and Church of Ireland (Anglican) churches, one closed Catholic church, and one ruin. The Catholic church overlooks the centre of the village (with feature belfry and baptistry), while the Church of Ireland building is sited on the approach to the village centre from the city.

The central Roman Catholic church building is the Church of Our Lady Mother of Divine Grace, of the Catholic Parish of Raheny. The building, completed in 1962, was designed by Peppard and Duffy architects, at the behest of Monsignor William Fitzpatrick and Archbishop John Charles McQuaid, with a capacity of 1500 to accommodate a burgeoning local congregation. The church opened on Sunday, 22 July 1962. The main entrance is framed within a large triangle inset with numerous smaller triangles, recalling traditional motifs from Romanesque Irish churches. The facade and the bell tower are built with green limestone.

Our Lady&#x27;s substantially smaller predecessor, St. Assam&#x27;s Church, built between 1859 and 1864, is directly opposite. Regular worship ceased there when Our Lady&#x27;s opened, and it was lightly used for the succeeding three decades, hosting St Joseph&#x27;s Youth Club (Bru Sheosamh), Taize prayer services, and some meetings and occasional Masses. The building is a Protected Structure. It was later sold, and a conversion to office space was planned.

The district is also served by the pyramid-style church of Kilbarrack-Foxfield Parish, by St. Benedict&#x27;s, of Grange Park Parish, and by St. Brigid&#x27;s, of Killester Parish, and by the chapel at the Capuchin Friary. A number of other Roman Catholic religious orders also have local presences. Prior to the restoration of local worship, Rahenyites had for centuries to attend Mass in Coolock or, later, Clontarf, or in local houses.

The Church of Ireland church, for the Anglican Parish of Raheny, (now in Union with the Parish of Coolock), All Saints Church, was built at the expense of Arthur Guinness, 1st Baron Ardilaun of the Guinness family. Before this church was built, Raheny Parish was served by the older church in the centre of Raheny, an earlier St. Assam&#x27;s Church, dating back to 1712, and previously to 1609 and before. All Saints&#x27; has a Rectory in the grounds, as well as a community hall and a preserved gate lodge for the verger. In April 2010, it was announced that the church required extensive roof repairs and funds were raised to complete this.

There was for some time also a large Plymouth Brethren meeting hall in &quot;new&quot; Bettyglen. Methodist worshippers have churches in Clontarf and Sutton, and Presbyterian churches are in Clontarf and Howth.

==Education==
The district has a boys&#x27; secondary school, St. Paul&#x27;s College, Raheny (attended by approximately 600 pupils in 2006) and one of Ireland&#x27;s largest girls&#x27; secondary schools, Manor House, as well as Ardscoil La Salle, on Raheny Road, a smaller mixed second level facility.

There is a primary school complex just behind the village centre, with a mixed junior school, Scoil Ide, and distinct boys&#x27; and girls&#x27; senior schools, Scoil Assaim and Scoil Aine respectively, as well as a shared assembly hall, used for many community events. There is also a mixed primary school, Springdale National School, on Springdale Road, overseen by a Board of Governors, with an endowment which includes rent from seven of the area&#x27;s historic cottages at the Crescent. There is a special national school operated by St. Michael&#x27;s House on Raheny Road, and another general primary school in the Grange Park locality.

The locality of Edenmore has its own school facilities, with a junior girls&#x27; school (St Monica&#x27;s), and separate senior primary schools for boys (St Malachy&#x27;s) and girls (St Eithne&#x27;s).

==Sport==
===GAA===
Raheny GAA, founded in the late 1950s, has a large clubhouse on All Saints Drive. St Vincents GAA was based north of the village centre, but has since moved to Marino

===Athletics===
Raheny Shamrock Athletic Club operates from a converted old schoolhouse behind the Scout Den on the slopes of the old fortification which gives its name to Raheny. The Shamrocks manage the annual AXA Raheny Five Mile Road Race, and 30 other events. The club became the largest athletics club in Dublin and have provided four Olympians. There is also a regular &quot;parkrun&quot; in St Anne&#x27;s Park.

===Soccer (association football)===
Raheny United F.C. was formed from the union of two local clubs, Raheny Boys F.C. and Dunseedy United F.C. The senior men&#x27;s team plays in Athletic Union League, while the senior women&#x27;s team were founder members of the Women&#x27;s National League and have also played in the Dublin Women&#x27;s Soccer League Grange Woodbine F.C. was founded in 1973 and its teams play their home matches at Edenmore Park and Woodbine Road Belgrove F.C. play their home matches at St. Paul&#x27;s College, Raheny.

===Golf and related sports===
St. Anne&#x27;s Golf Club, founded by a small group of locals in 1921, is based at the Raheny end of Bull Island, while the Royal Dublin Golf Club is also on Bull Island, primarily in Clontarf but partly, and with its service entrance, in Raheny. There is also a public par-3 golf course in St Anne&#x27;s Park, and municipal Pitch and Putt facility within Edenmore Park, on Station Road.

===Racquet sports===
St Anne&#x27;s Park Tennis Club plays at the public tennis courts at St Anne&#x27;s Park. There are also two badminton clubs, Raheny Badminton Club and Raheny Smashers, both playing at the badminton facility in Baldoyle.

==Youth groups==

The 73rd Raheny Scout Group, a unit of Scouting Ireland, meet at their den on the banks of the Santry River, opposite the Church of Our Lady Mother of Divine Grace on the Howth Road. Raheny Guides, also known as Buion An Leanbh Prague of the Catholic Guides of Ireland, have been in existence since 1966, meeting on a Wednesday evening. The Cygnets (age 5–7) meet in the CARA Hall and the Brigins (age 6–10), Guides (age 10–16) and Rangers (age 14–19) meet in Scoil Aine (Raheny N.S.) Hall. There are also Girls&#x27; and Boys&#x27; Brigade companies meeting at the Church of Ireland halls.

Previously the area had a youth club for the eastern end of the village, M.A.F.R.A., and later St Joseph&#x27;s Youth Club, based at the new St Assam&#x27;s Church, and supported by the Roman Catholic parish.

==Politics==
In Dáil Éireann, Raheny is part of the five-seat Dublin Bay North constituency. Until the 2016 general election it was split between the constituencies of Dublin North-Central and Dublin North-East. The splitting of the district, which also gives electoral stations on either side of the village centre (generally at the library and at the National Schools complex), was a source of local anger for many years.

Long-serving politicians for the area include Seán Kenny (politician), a Dublin City Councillor from 1979 until 2011 when he was elected for the second time in Dáil Éireann (the first occasion having been in the 1990s) and former minister Michael Woods, who lives in neighbouring Kilbarrack. Past figures include the late ex-Taoiseach Charles Haughey, and Councillor Niamh Cosgrave, of Foxfield, the latter in a rare move having been removed from the City Council for non-attendance.

==Localities and housing==
The civil parish of Raheny comprises at least the townlands of Ballyhoy, Bettyville, Charleville, Edenmore, Foxlands, Glebe, Maryville, Mountolive (or Mount of Olives), North Bull Island, Raheny North, Raheny South and (the) Snug. Some historic records also note the village centre as a distinct entity, &quot;Raheny Town&quot;. Foxlands now contains Avondale, Maywood and Bettyglen, while Mountolive (and parts of Swan&#x27;s Nest) now include several roads and estates, notably &quot;Tuscany Downs&quot; whose naming caused ministerial comment and public discussion about inappropriate naming conventions. The modern civic district is sometimes seen as extending beyond these areas, and at one time Raheny was used as the address for much of what is now Donaghmede, for example. The civil parish is still maintained in law, and its boundaries were last reviewed in 1985, with their extension to a greater part of Dublin Bay; it includes half, or slightly more, of Bull Island.

The first major housing development in Raheny was St Anne&#x27;s, built for Dublin Corporation on parts of the former Guinness estate not retained as a public park, which was followed by Cill Éanna and Ennafort, then Avondale, Rathmore Park, St Assam&#x27;s and Foxfield, and Maywood were developed by the building firm of Curtis &amp; Farrelly in the early to mid-1960s. Grange Park, Millwood and Grange-Woodbine, and &quot;Old&quot; Bettyglen followed, and later Ashcroft on the former St Vincent&#x27;s grounds, &quot;New Bettyglen&quot; in the 1980s, Belmont and Tuscany Downs. There are a number of housing units for older people, notably in St. Anne&#x27;s and at Avondale, and three retirement/nursing homes, one formerly dedicated for retired members of the Garda Siochana and their families, one run by the Little Sisters of the Poor at Sybil Hill, and one HSE facility. The Sorohan Brothers built a range of houses from 1966.

Starting in the mid-2000s, Raheny, most of which was laid out with semi-detached and terraced houses with good gardens front and rear, has seen some infill development, especially on corner sites, and the arrival of a small but growing number of apartment developments (the area previously had almost no apartment buildings).

===Localities===
All of one and part of another of Raheny&#x27;s townlands were largely developed by Dublin Corporation to form a new neighbourhood, Edenmore, in one of its largest-ever housing projects. Although still part of the overall district, and shown in addresses as &quot;Edenmore, Raheny&quot;, the new area, with its own schools, small shopping centre (including one of Dublin&#x27;s highest-turnover pubs), church (Roman Catholic: St. Monica&#x27;s), health centre and some sports teams, has a distinct identity. There is also a nursing home, St Gabriel&#x27;s.

The locality of Harmonstown, straddling the boundary between Raheny and Artane, lies just over the railway line from the Ennafort housing development in Raheny, and across the Santry River from Edenmore.

<text>The Socialist Youth League (&quot;Socialistiska Ungdomsförbundet&quot;, SUF) of Sweden was founded in Stockholm in 1897. The SUF soon attracted &quot;radical&quot; elements who stood in opposition to social democratic leaders. In 1903, part of the organisation split off to become the Social Democratic Youth League. The remainder of the SUF formed the backbone of the Young Socialists, founded in 1908. 

Notable members included Albert Jensen, who went on to found the Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden in 1910.

<doc id="1108228" wikidata="Q6898741" url="?curid=1108228" title="Mondo 2000">
<text>Mondo 2000 was a glossy cyberculture magazine published in California during the 1980s and 1990s. It covered cyberpunk topics such as virtual reality and smart drugs. It was a more anarchic and subversive prototype for the later-founded &quot;Wired&quot; magazine.

==History==
&quot;Mondo 2000&quot; originated as &quot;High Frontiers&quot; in 1984, edited by R. U. Sirius (pseudonym for Ken Goffman) with co-editor and publisher Morgan Russell. R. U. Sirius was succeeded as Editor-in-Chief by Alison Bailey Kennedy, a.k.a. &quot;Queen Mu&quot; and &quot;Alison Wonderland&quot;.

Sirius was joined by hacker Jude Milhon (a.k.a. St. Jude) as editor and the magazine was renamed &quot;Reality Hackers&quot; in 1988 to better reflect its drugs and computers theme. It changed title again to &quot;Mondo 2000&quot; in 1989. Art director and photographer Bart Nagel, a pioneer in Photoshop collage, created the publication&#x27;s elegantly surrealist aesthetic. R. U. Sirius left at the beginning of 1993, at about the same time as the launch of &quot;Wired&quot;. The magazine continued until 1998, with the last issue being #17.

&quot;Mondo 2000&quot; was relaunched as the blog &quot;Mondo2000.com&quot; in August 2017.

==Featured writers==
Along with the print version of &quot;Boing Boing&quot; — with which &quot;Mondo 2000&quot; shared several writers, including Mark Frauenfelder, Richard Kadrey, Gareth Branwyn, and Jon Lebkowsky — &quot;Mondo 2000&quot; helped develop what was to become the cyberpunk subculture. Writers included William Gibson, Nan C. Druid (pseudonym for Maerian Morris), Paco Nathan, Rudy Rucker, Bruce Sterling, Tiffany Lee Brown, Andrew Hultkrans, Mark Dery, Douglas Rushkoff, Mark Pesce, and Robert Anton Wilson.

Writers contributing since the 2017 relaunch include John Higgs, John Shirley, Giulio Prisco, Hyun Yi Kang, Woody Evans, Michael Pinchera, Rudy Rucker, Prop Anon, R.U. Sirius, and interviews with Douglas Rushkoff and Grant Morrison.

<doc id="1108234" wikidata="Q3352302" url="?curid=1108234" title="Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme">
<text>The Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme (IGMDP) was an Indian Ministry of Defence programme for the research and development of the comprehensive range of missiles. The programme was managed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Ordnance Factories Board in partnership with other Indian government political organisations. The project started in 1982–83 under the leadership of Abdul Kalam who oversaw its ending in 2008 after these strategic missiles were successfully developed.

On 8 January 2008, the DRDO formally announced the successful rated guided missile programme was completed with its design objectives achieved since most of the missiles in the programme had been developed and inducted by the Indian armed forces.

== History ==

By the start of the 1980s, the DRDL had developed competence and expertise in the fields of propulsion, navigation and manufacture of aerospace materials based on the Soviet rocketry technologies. Thus, India&#x27;s political leadership, which included Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, Defence Minister R. Venkataraman, V.S. Arunachalam (Scientific Advisor to the Defence Minister), decided that all these technologies should be consolidated.

This led to the birth of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme with Dr. Abdul Kalam, who had previously been the project director for the SLV-3 programme at ISRO, was inducted as the DRDL Director in 1983 to conceive and lead it. While the scientists proposed the development of each missile consecutively, the Defence Minister R. Venkataraman asked them to reconsider and develop all the missiles simultaneously. Thus, four projects, to be pursued concurrently, were born under the IGMDP:
* Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam started multiple projects simultaneously to develop the following types of Indian Guided Missiles missiles.
*# Short Range Surface to Surface Missile (SSM) ‘Prithvi’
*# Long Range Surface to Surface Missile (SSM) ‘Agni’
*# Medium Range Surface to Air Missile (SAM) ‘Akash’
*# Short Range Surface to Air Missile (SAM) ‘Trishul’
*# Anti-tank Guided Missile (ATGM) ‘Nag’

The Agni missile was initially conceived in the IGMDP as a technology demonstrator project in the form of a re-entry vehicle, and was later upgraded to a ballistic missile with different ranges. As part of this program, the Interim Test Range at Balasore in Odisha was also developed for missile testing.

=== Hurdles ===

After India test-fired the first Prithvi missile in 1988, and the Agni missile in 1989, the Missile Technology Control Regime (then an informal grouping established in 1987 by Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States) decided to restrict access to any technology that would help India in its missile development program. To counter the MTCR, the IGMDP team formed a consortium of DRDO laboratories, industries and academic institutions to build these sub-systems, components and materials. Though this slowed down the progress of the program, India successfully developed indigenously all the restricted components denied to it by the MTCR.

===Regional influence===
The starting of India&#x27;s missile program influenced Pakistan to scramble its resources to meet the challenge. Like India, Pakistan faced hurdles to operationalize its program since education on space sciences was never sought. It took Pakistan decades of expensive trial errors before their program became feasible for military deployment.

== Prithvi ==
The Prithvi missile (from Sanskrit पृथ्वी &quot;&quot; &quot;Earth&quot;) is a family of tactical surface-to-surface short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) and is India&#x27;s first indigenously developed ballistic missile. Development of the Prithvi began in 1983, and it was first test-fired on 25 February 1988 from Sriharikota, SHAR Centre, Pottisreeramulu Nellore district, Andhra Pradesh. It has a range of up to 150 to 300 km. The land variant is called Prithvi while the naval operational variant of Prithvi I and Prithvi III class missiles are code named Dhanush (meaning &quot;Bow&quot;). Both variants are used for surface targets.

The Prithvi is said to have its propulsion technology derived from the Soviet SA-2 surface-to-air missile. Variants make use of either liquid or both liquid and solid fuels. Developed as a battlefield missile, it could carry a nuclear warhead in its role as a tactical nuclear weapon.
The initial project framework of the IGMDP envisioned the Prithvi missile as a short-range ballistic missile with variants for the Indian Army, Indian Air Force and the Indian Navy. Over the years the &quot;Prithvi&quot; missile specifications have undergone a number of changes. The Prithvi I class of missiles were inducted into the Indian Army in 1994, and it is reported that Prithvi I missiles are being withdrawn from service, being replaced with Prahar missiles. Prithvi II missiles were inducted in 1996. &quot;Prithvi III&quot; class has a longer-range of 350 km, and was successfully test fired in 2004.

== Agni re-entry technology ==
A technology demonstrator for re-entry technology called Agni was added to IGMDP as Prithvi was unable to be converted to a longer ranged missile. The first flight of Agni with re-entry technology took place in 1989. The re-entry system used resins and carbon fibres in its construction and was able to withstand a temperature of up to 3000 °C. The technologies developed in this project were eventually used in the Agni series of missiles.

== Trishul ==

Trishul (Sanskrit: त्रिशूल, meaning &quot;trident&quot;) is the name of a short range surface-to-air missile developed by India as a part of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program. It has a range of 12 km and is fitted with a 5.5 kg warhead. Designed to be used against low-level (sea skimming) targets at short range, the system has been developed to defend naval vessels against missiles and also as a short-range surface-to-air missile on land. According to reports, the range of the missile is 12 km and is fitted with a 15 kg warhead. The weight of the missile is 130 kg. The length of the missile is 3.5 m. India officially shut down the project on 27 February 2008. In 2003, Defence Minister George Fernandes had indicated that the Trishul missile had been de-linked from user service and would be continued as a technology demonstrator.

== Akash ==

Akash (Sanskrit: आकाश meaning &quot;Sky&quot;) is a medium-range surface-to-air missile developed as part of India&#x27;s Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme to achieve self-sufficiency in the area of surface-to-air missiles. It is the most expensive missile project ever undertaken by the Union government in the 20th century. Development costs skyrocketed to almost 120 million, which is far more than other similar systems.

Akash is a medium-range surface-to-air missile with an intercept range of 30 km. It has a launch weight of 720 kg, a diameter of 35 cm and a length of 5.8 metres. Akash flies at supersonic speed, reaching around Mach 2.5. It can reach an altitude of 18 km. A digital proximity fuse is coupled with a 55 kg pre-fragmented warhead, while the safety arming and detonation mechanism enables a controlled detonation sequence. A self-destruct device is also integrated. It is propelled by a solid fuelled booster stage. The missile has a terminal guidance system capable of working through electronic countermeasures. The entire Akash SAM system allows for attacking multiple targets (up to 4 per battery). The Akash missile&#x27;s use of ramjet propulsion system allows it to maintain its speed without deceleration, unlike the Patriot missiles. The missile is supported by a multi-target and multi-function phased array fire control radar called the &#x27;Rajendra&#x27; with a range of about 80 km in search, and 60 km in terms of engagement.

The missile is completely guided by the radar, without any active guidance of its own. This allows it greater capability against jamming as the aircraft self-protection jammer would have to work against the high-power Rajendra, and the aircraft being attacked is not alerted by any terminal seeker on the Akash itself.

Design of the missile is similar to that of the SA-6, with four long tube ramjet inlet ducts mounted mid-body between wings. For pitch/yaw control four clipped triangular moving wings are mounted on mid-body. For roll control four inline clipped delta fins with ailerons are mounted before the tail. However, internal schema shows a completely modernised layout, including an onboard computer with special optimised trajectories, and an all-digital proximity fuse.

The Akash system meant for the Army uses the T-72 tank chassis for its launcher and radar vehicles. The Rajendra derivative for the Army is called the Battery Level Radar-III. The Air Force version uses an Ashok Leyland truck platform to tow the missile launcher, while the Radar is on a BMP-2 chassis and is called the Battery Level Radar-II. In either case, the launchers carry three ready-to-fire Akash missiles each. The launchers are automated, autonomous and networked to a command post and the guidance radar. They are slewable in azimuth and elevation. The Akash system can be deployed by rail, road or air.

The first test flight of Akash missile was conducted in 1990, with development flights up to March 1997.

The IAF has initiated the process to induct the Akash surface-to-air missiles developed as a part of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme. The Multiple target handling capability of Akash weapon system was demonstrated by live firing in a C4I environment during the trials. Two Akash missiles intercepted two fast moving targets in simultaneous engagement mode in 2005 itself. The Akash System&#x27;s 3-D central acquisition radar (3-D car) group mode performance was then fully established.

In December 2007 Indian Air Force completed user trials for the Akash missile system. The trials, which were spread over ten days, were successful, and the missile hit its target on all five occasions. Before the ten-day trial at Chandipur, the Akash system&#x27;s ECCM Evaluation tests were carried out at Gwalior Air force base while mobility trials for the system vehicles were carried out at Pokhran. The IAF had evolved the user Trial Directive to verify the Akash&#x27;s consistency in engaging targets. The following trials were conducted: Against low-flying near-range target, long-range high-altitude target, crossing and approaching target and ripple firing of two missiles from the same launcher against a low-altitude receding target.
Following this, the IAF declared that it would initiate the induction of 2 squadrons strength (each squadron with 2 batteries) of this missile system, to begin with. Once deliveries are complete, further orders would be placed to replace retiring SA-3 GOA (Pechora) SAM systems. In February 2010, the Indian Air Force ordered six more squadrons of the Akash system, taking orders to eight of the type. The Indian Army is also expected to order the Akash system.

== Nag ==

Nag (Sanskrit: नाग meaning &quot;cobra&quot;) is India&#x27;s third generation &quot;Fire-and-forget&quot; anti-tank missile. It is an all weather, top attack missile with a range of 0.5 to 4 km.

The missile uses an 8 kg high-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) tandem warhead capable of defeating modern armour including Explosive Reactive Armour (ERA) and composite armour. Nag uses Imaging Infra-Red (IIR) guidance with day and night capability. Mode of launch for the IIR seeker is LOBL (lock-on before launch). Nag can be mounted on an infantry vehicle; a helicopter launched version will also be available with integration work being carried out with the HAL Dhruv.

Separate versions for the Army and the Air Force are being developed. For the Army, the missiles will be carried by specialist carrier vehicles (NAMICA-Nag Missile Carrier) equipped with a thermographic camera for target acquisition. NAMICA is a modified BMP-2 infantry fighting vehicle licence produced as &quot;Sarath&quot; in India. The carriers are capable of carrying four ready-to-fire missiles in the observation/launch platform which can be elevated with more missiles available for reload within the carrier. For the Air Force, a nose-mounted thermal imaging system has been developed for guiding the missile&#x27;s trajectory &quot;Helina&quot;. The missile has a completely fiberglass structure and weighs around 42 kg.

Nag was test fired for the 45th time on 19 March 2005 from the Test Range at Ahmednagar (Maharashtra), signalling the completion of the developmental phase. It will now enter the production phase, subject to user trials and acceptance by the Indian Army.

Further versions of the missile may make use of an all-weather Milli-metre Wave (mmW) seeker as an additional option. This seeker has reportedly been developed and efforts are on to integrate it into the missile.

<text>The 1978 African Cup of Nations was the eleventh edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, the football championship of Africa (CAF). It was hosted by Accra and Kumasi, Ghana. The format of the competition changed from 1976: the field of eight teams was still split into two groups of four, but the final group stage was eliminated in favor of the knockout semifinals used in tournaments prior to 1976 (except 1959). Ghana won its third championship, beating Uganda in the final 2−0.

Ivory Coast and Mali were both disqualified in the second round of qualification: Ivory Coast for using an ineligible player, and Mali after stadium security and police assaulted match officials during the first leg. Since Mali had received a first round walkover after Niger failed to appear, Upper Volta, who had been beaten by the Ivory Coast in the first round, were given their place in the final tournament.

<doc id="1108261" wikidata="Q2472743" url="?curid=1108261" title="Silsden">
<text>Silsden is a town and civil parish in the City of Bradford in West Yorkshire, England, on the River Aire and Leeds and Liverpool Canal between Keighley and Skipton, which had a population of 8,390 at the 2021 Census. The parish includes the hamlet of Brunthwaite.

A milestone on the A6034 &quot;Keighley Rd&quot; as it crosses the river Aire marks the boundary of the town.

== History ==
Silsden was mentioned in the 1086 &quot;Domesday Book&quot; as &quot;Siglesdene&quot;, and as the most important village in Craven.

Generally an agricultural area, the Industrial Revolution had a significant impact on West Yorkshire, including Silsden. The town hosted a number of mills none of which now operate in their original form. 
Nail making can be traced back to the late 1700s when the Leeds and Liverpool Canal gave ready access to remote markets and easier access to raw materials from the forges in Leeds. By the mid 1800s there was steady work for over 100 men and boys making nails throughout the town. A wide variety of specialist nails was made, including joiners nails, horse shoe nails, shoe and clog nails. These latter &quot;cobbler&#x27;s nails&quot; gave Silsden its nickname of &quot;Cobbydale&quot;. The nail making history was commemorated by an art installation in 2011 in Wesley Place (on the site of the long gone original fire station) called &quot;Bent Nail&quot; by Sam Shendi. 

There is still industry in the town, some in old mill buildings and some in a new industrial estate between the town and the river. The town retains a very small amount of manufacturing.

The Leeds and Liverpool Canal became a key element of local infrastructure upon its completion in 1816. Silsden was then connected to both a significant manufacturing city (Leeds) and a major ocean port (Liverpool) by canal. Canal boats allowed for cheap transportation of bulk goods, especially coal and wool, to the area.
In 1911, there was a riot in Silsden when the police station was attacked. A very unpopular policeman had been too enthusiastic in his duties. Questions were raised in the House of Commons and it was reported in the national press. The policeman was removed from the town and no more trouble occurred.

During the 1940s, a hostel was built off Howden Road, to house refugees and prisoners of war from various countries. The area is now a housing estate, and there is a plaque, erected by the local Ukrainian community in 1988, to commemorate the hostel on Ings Way. 

In 1998, a hoard of 27 gold coins dating back to the 1st century AD were found in the town and subsequently valued at £20,000 by experts appointed by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.

The &quot;Guinness Book of World Records&quot; reported that the biggest onion ever, at , was grown in Silsden in 2010 by Vincent Throup. However this has since been beaten.

On 6 July 2014, Stage 2 of the 2014 Tour de France from York to Sheffield, passed through the town.

=== Brunthwaite ===
The hamlet of Brunthwaite lies about east of the centre of Silsden, near Brunthwaite Beck and at the foot of Rombalds Moor. Land here formed a small manor from Saxon times, and the first known written mention of the name (as &quot;Bronthweyt&quot;) occurs in the 14th century. The oldest buildings in the present settlement are from an 18th-century farming community. The hamlet was designated as a conservation area in 1977, which was reassessed by Bradford Council in 2005.

==Governance==
The town is part of the Craven ward of the Metropolitan borough of the City of Bradford, part of the Metropolitan county of West Yorkshire.

== Community ==
Silsden has been administered by the City of Bradford Metropolitan District Council since 1974. It also has its own town council which is based at Silsden Town Hall.

Silsden has eight public houses: the Robin Hood, the Counting House, the Red Lion, the Duck Pond, the Post Office, the Butchers Arms, the Punch Bowl, and the King&#x27;s Arms. There are two members&#x27; clubs: Sunnybank Social Club and Twisters Social Club.

Whilst Silsden does not have its own railway station, the Steeton and Silsden railway station is south in the village of Steeton. The station provides a link for commuters to the cities of Leeds and Bradford.
Lying between Keighley and Ilkley, Silsden is served by buses to both these towns. Silsden&#x27;s public transport benefits from Silsden being part of West Yorkshire rather than North Yorkshire, the border of which runs along one end of the town.

== Notable people ==
The Lampkin family lived at Silsden during the Second World War. Lampkin brothers Arthur, Alan and Martin were, later, national motorcycle trials champions. Martin Lampkin won the 1975 FIM Trial World Championship and his son, Douglas &quot;Dougie&quot; Lampkin, is a twelve-time trials world champion.

The Wainman family, a second motorsport dynasty from Silsden, compete in BriSCA Formula 1 Stock Cars. Frankie Wainman was World Champion in 1979, while his son Frankie Wainman Junior is one of the most successful drivers in the history of the sport.

English rugby league player Jack Reed, who played for the Brisbane Broncos, was born in Silsden.

Henry Price started his first Fifty Shilling Tailors shop in Silsden. With this fortune, the now Sir Henry Price, bought Wakehurst Place, Ardingly, West Sussex, which is now owned by the National Trust.

Margaret Wintringham, née Longbottom, was a British Liberal Party politician. She was the second woman take her seat in the House of Commons and lived in Silsden when her father was the head teacher at Bolton Road School.

== Media ==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC Yorkshire and ITV Yorkshire. Television signals are received from the Emley Moor TV transmitter, and the Keighley relay transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Leeds on 102.7 FM, Capital Yorkshire on 105.6 FM, Heart Yorkshire on 107.6 FM, Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 97.5 FM, Greatest Hits Radio West Yorkshire on 96.3 FM, and Rombalds Radio, a community based radio station that broadcast online.

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Keighley News&quot; and &quot;Telegraph &amp; Argus&quot;.

=== Other media ===
On 27 April 1995, a one-off anthology supernatural drama series &quot;Chiller&quot; aired, in which episode 5, titled &quot;Number Six&quot;, featured Silsden. It was featured for almost the entire one-hour episode, using locations across the town.

Bonapartes Restaurant, on Kirkgate, was the subject of the first-ever episode of Gordon Ramsay&#x27;s &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot; in 2004. After the show aired, the restaurant&#x27;s owner Sue Ray threatened to take legal action against Ramsay, Channel 4 and the programme makers, Optomen, after claiming that the show put her £400,000 in debt. Christine Hall, producer of &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot;, refused to accept the blame, stating that Ray only had herself to blame. The programme revisited the restaurant in the second series, but Ray would only talk to Ramsay off-camera. In June 2006, Ramsay won a High Court case against the &quot;London Evening Standard&quot;, which had alleged, after reports from Ray, that scenes and the general condition of Bonapartes had been faked. Ramsay was awarded £75,000 plus costs. Ramsay said at the time: &quot;I won&#x27;t let people write anything they want to about me. We have never done anything in a cynical, fake way.&quot;

In July 2007, the butchers, barbers and shoe shop located on Bradley Road were used in an episode of ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Royal&quot;.

<text>&quot;Fiddlin&#x27;&quot; John Carson (March 23, 1868 – December 11, 1949) was an American musician and singer who is widely considered to be one of the early pioneers of country music.

==Early life==
Carson was born near McCaysville in Fannin County, Georgia. He moved to Cobb County in his youth. His father worked as a section foreman for the Western and Atlantic Railroad Company. In his teens, Carson learned to play the fiddle, using an old Stradivari-copy violin brought from Ireland in the early 18th century. In his teens, he worked as a racehorse jockey.

In 1894, Carson married, and a couple of years later, in 1900, he began working for the Exposition Cotton Mills in Atlanta, followed by work in other cotton mills of the Atlanta area for the next twenty years, eventually being promoted to foreman. In 1911, Carson&#x27;s family moved to Cabbagetown, Georgia, and he and his children began working for the Fulton Bag and Cotton Mill. Three years later, in 1914, the workers of the cotton mill went on strike for their right to form a union, and Carson had nothing else to do but to perform for a living in the streets of North Atlanta. In these days, he wrote many songs, and he used to print copies and sell them in the streets for a nickel or a dime. Some of the songs he wrote dealt with real-life drama, like the murder ballad &quot;Mary Phagan&quot;. Because the governor of Georgia, John Marshall Slaton, commuted the death sentence of the wrongly convicted murderer of Mary Phagan to a life sentence, Carson, in outrage, wrote another version of &quot;Mary Phagan&quot; where he accused the governor of being paid a million dollars from a New York bank to change the verdict, causing him to be thrown in jail for slander. The convicted killer, Leo Frank, was lynched.

On April 1, 1913, Carson performed at the first annual &quot;Georgia Old-Time Fiddlers&#x27; Convention&quot;, held at the Municipal Auditorium in Atlanta, where he came in fourth. But between 1914 and 1922, he was proclaimed &quot;Champion Fiddler of Georgia&quot; seven times. The governor of Tennessee, Robert L. Taylor, dubbed him &quot;Fiddlin&#x27; John&quot;. In 1919, Carson began touring, mostly the areas north of Atlanta, with his newly formed band the Cronies. He became associated with many politicians of Georgia, like Tom Watson, Herman Talmadge, and Eugene Talmadge, relations that gave rise to new songs like &quot;Tom Watson Special&quot;. Carson and his daughter Rosa Lee began a series of performances for different political campaigns: for the Tom Watson U.S. Senate Campaign in 1920, for all of the Gene Talmadge campaigns, and for the Herman Talmadge for governor campaign. On September 9, 1922, Carson made his radio debut at the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot;&#x27;s radio station WSB in Atlanta, It was reported by the &quot;Atlanta Journal&quot; that Carson&#x27;s fame quickly spread all over the United States following his broadcast at WSB.

==Career and aftermath==

In early June 1923, Polk C. Brockman, an Atlanta furniture store owner, who had been instrumental in the distribution of records for Okeh Records, went to New York City to work out a new business deal with Okeh Records. Later, in New York, he was asked if he knew of any artist in Atlanta that could justify a recording trip to Georgia. Brockman promised to return with an answer. A few days later, he was watching a movie followed by a silent newsreel at the Palace Theater in Times Square. The newsreel contained footage of Carson from an old time fiddler&#x27;s contest in Virginia. Brockman wrote in his notebook: &quot;Record Fiddlin&#x27; John Carson&quot;. At his next meeting with Okeh Records Board, he persuaded Ralph Peer to go ahead and record Carson.

On June 19, 1923, Carson made his recording debut in an empty building on Nassau Street in Atlanta, cutting two sides, &quot;The Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane&quot; and &quot;The Old Hen Cackled and the Rooster&#x27;s Going To Crow.&quot; Brockman told researchers in the 1960s that Peer had disliked the singing style of Carson and described it &quot;pluperfect awful&quot;, but Peer was persuaded by Brockman to press five hundred copies for him to distribute. (Peer&#x27;s biographer, Barry Mazor, argues that Peer&#x27;s dissatisfaction concerned the technical quality of the recording, rather than the music, and that Peer was keen to make more recordings of Carson in New York.) The recording was immediately sold out from the stage of the next Fiddler&#x27;s convention on July 13, 1923. Peer, realizing Carson&#x27;s potential, immediately invited Carson to New York City for another recording session. His recordings of &quot;You Will Never Miss Your Mother Until She Is Gone&quot; and &quot;Old Joe Clark&quot; both sold over one million copies.

Carson ceased recording temporarily in 1931 but resumed in 1934, now for the Victor label. Between 1923 and 1931, Carson recorded almost 150 songs, mostly together with the &quot;Virginia Reelers&quot; or his daughter Rosa Lee Carson, who performed with him as Moonshine Kate. Carson&#x27;s final recordings were done in Camden, New Jersey, for Bluebird Records. In 1935, Carson made a trip to Hollywood, as movie producers were eyeing him as their next big movie star. Along with Rosa Lee, he was to appear in a film called &quot;The Mountain Stillers&quot;, though this never came to pass. He wrote more than 150 songs in his life, but only nine were ever copyrighted. Because Carson could not read sheet music, he had his songs transferred to standard notation by Irene Spain, the stepdaughter of the preacher Andrew Jenkins. Carson was involved in several copyright issues with both Okeh Records and other musicians during his active career.

In his later years, he worked for the local government as an elevator operator in Atlanta, a job he had obtained through his friendship with governor Herman Talmadge. He died in 1949 in Atlanta, Georgia, holding his fiddle in his arms, and is buried in Sylvester Cemetery in the East Atlanta neighborhood of Atlanta, where surviving friends and family play music at his grave each year around the anniversary of his birth.

==Views on race and evolution==
Carson&#x27;s song &quot;There Ain&#x27;t No Bugs on Me&quot; mocked the theory of evolution, stating &quot;there may be monkey in some of you guys, but there ain&#x27;t no monkey in me&quot;. In the same song, he referenced the Ku Klux Klan (&quot;my old man joined the Ku Klux, and ma, she lost her sheet&quot;), whose rallies he regularly attended. Another of Carson&#x27;s songs was &quot;Ballad of Little Mary Phagan&quot;, a murder ballad that stoked the anti-Semitism present in Atlanta in the wake of Phagan&#x27;s murder. Carson later wrote a song in praise of the tree from which Leo Frank had been lynched.

<text>Blake Tollison Shelton (born June 18, 1976) is an American country singer, songwriter and television personality. In 2001, he made his debut with the single &quot;Austin&quot; from his first album, &quot;Blake Shelton&quot;. &quot;Austin&quot; spent five weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Songs chart. The now Platinum-certified debut album also produced two more top 20 entries (&quot;All Over Me&quot; and &quot;Ol&#x27; Red&quot;).

His second and third albums, 2003&#x27;s &quot;The Dreamer&quot; and 2004&#x27;s &quot;Blake Shelton&#x27;s Barn &amp; Grill&quot;, are gold and platinum, respectively. His fourth album, &quot;Pure BS&quot; (2007), was re-issued in 2008 with a cover of Michael Bublé&#x27;s pop hit &quot;Home&quot; as one of the bonus tracks. His fifth album, &quot;Startin&#x27; Fires&quot; was released in November 2008. It was followed by the extended plays &quot;Hillbilly Bone&quot; and &quot;All About Tonight&quot; in 2010, and the albums &quot;Red River Blue&quot; in 2011, &quot;Based on a True Story...&quot; in 2013, &quot;Bringing Back the Sunshine&quot; in 2014, &quot;If I&#x27;m Honest&quot; in 2016, &quot;Texoma Shore&quot; in 2017, and &quot;Fully Loaded: God&#x27;s Country&quot; in 2019.

, Shelton has charted 40 singles, including 29 number ones, 17 of which were consecutive. The 11th No. 1 (&quot;Doin&#x27; What She Likes&quot;) broke &quot;the record for the most consecutive No. 1 singles in the Country Airplay chart&#x27;s 24-year history&quot;. Throughout his career, he has received nine Grammy Award nominations, including two for Best Country Album. In 2024, Shelton left Warner Music Nashville and signed with BBR Music Group.

Shelton has been a judge on the televised singing competitions &quot;Nashville Star&quot;, &quot;Clash of the Choirs&quot;, and a coach on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Voice&quot;. He was on &quot;The Voice&quot; from 2011 to 2023, and, in nine of twenty-three seasons (2–4, 7, 11, 13, 18, 20, 22), a member of his team won.

==Early life==
Blake Tollison Shelton was born in Ada, Oklahoma, to Dorothy Ann (née Bristol) (b. 1936), a beauty salon owner, and Richard Lee &quot;Dick&quot; Shelton (1940–2012), a car salesman. Shelton began singing at an early age and by the age of 12, he was taught how to play the guitar by his uncle. By age 15, he had written his first song. By age 16, he had received a Denbo Diamond Award in his home state. On November 13, 1990, his older brother, Richie Shelton was killed in an automobile accident at 24.

 After graduating from high school at 17, he moved to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a singing career. There he got a job at a music publishing company and, in 1997, he was aided by Bobby Braddock to obtain a production contract with Sony Music.

==Music career==
===2001–2006: Beginnings===
 Some years later in Nashville, he signed to Giant Records. In 2001, he was slated to release a song entitled &quot;I Wanna Talk About Me&quot; as a single. However, staff at the label considered the song unsuitable for a lead-off single, and the song was eventually recorded by Toby Keith, whose version was a number 1 single.

Instead, Giant released &quot;Austin&quot; as Shelton&#x27;s debut single. Shortly after that song was released, Giant Records was closed, and Shelton was transferred to parent company Warner Bros. Records. &quot;Austin&quot; became Shelton&#x27;s first number-one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Country Singles &amp; Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) charts and spent five weeks at that position. Warner released Shelton&#x27;s self-titled debut album, which was produced by songwriter Bobby Braddock. It also produced the Top 20 hits &quot;All Over Me&quot;, which Shelton co-wrote with Earl Thomas Conley and Mike Pyle, and &quot;Ol&#x27; Red&quot;. Although Shelton&#x27;s rendition of &quot;Ol&#x27; Red&quot; was not a major radio hit, he considers it his signature song, and it has become popular in concert. The album received a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for shipments of 1,000,000 copies.

The album received a positive review from Maria Konicki Dinoia of Allmusic, who called &quot;Austin&quot; &quot;tremendously imaginative&quot; and praised Shelton for including songs written by Braddock and Conley. &quot;Country Standard Time&quot; was less favorable, with Scott Homewood saying that the &quot;album just smacks of being assembled with the intent on capturing the burgeoning alternative country market&quot;.

Shelton&#x27;s second album, &quot;The Dreamer&quot;, was first released on February 4, 2003, on Warner Bros. Records. Its lead-off single, &quot;The Baby&quot;, reached No. 1 on the country charts, holding that position for three weeks. Although the second and third singles (&quot;Heavy Liftin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Playboys of the Southwestern World&quot;, respectively) only reached No. 32 and No. 24, &quot;The Dreamer&quot; earned gold certification, as well. He, along with Andy Griggs and Montgomery Gentry, sang guest vocals on Tracy Byrd&#x27;s mid-2003 single &quot;The Truth About Men&quot;. &quot;Blake Shelton&#x27;s Barn &amp; Grill&quot; was the title of Shelton&#x27;s third studio album, released in 2004. Its lead-off single, the Harley Allen co-write &quot;When Somebody Knows You That Well&quot;, peaked at No. 37 on the country charts, while the follow-up &quot;Some Beach&quot; became his third No. 1 hit, holding that position for four weeks. It was followed by a cover of Conway Twitty&#x27;s 1988 single &quot;Goodbye Time&quot;. Both this cover and its followup, &quot;Nobody but Me&quot;, reached Top Ten for Shelton, as well. As with his first album, &quot;Blake Shelton&#x27;s Barn &amp; Grill&quot; was certified platinum. Accompanying the album&#x27;s release was a video collection entitled &quot;Blake Shelton&#x27;s Barn &amp; Grill: A Video Collection&quot;.

On December 18, 2005, several of Shelton&#x27;s songs, including &quot;Nobody but Me&quot;, appeared on the TV movie &quot;The Christmas Blessing&quot;, starring Neil Patrick Harris, Rebecca Gayheart, Angus T. Jones, and Rob Lowe. Shelton had a small role at the end of the movie, playing himself at a benefit concert, singing &quot;Nobody But Me&quot;.

===2006–2011: &quot;Pure BS&quot; and &quot;Startin&#x27; Fires&quot;===

Shelton released his fourth studio album, &quot;Pure BS&quot;, in early 2007. Unlike with his first three albums, which were produced entirely by Bobby Braddock, Shelton worked with Braddock, Brent Rowan, and Paul Worley as producers for this album. Its first two singles—&quot;Don&#x27;t Make Me&quot; and &quot;The More I Drink&quot;—were both Top 20 hits on the country charts, respectively reaching No.12 and No. 19. Also in late 2007, Shelton made appearances on television shows: first as a judge on the talent competition &quot;Nashville Star&quot;, and later on &quot;Clash of the Choirs&quot;.

&quot;Pure BS&quot; was re-released in 2008 with three bonus tracks, including a cover of Michael Bublé&#x27;s hit single &quot;Home&quot;. This cover, released in early 2008 as the album&#x27;s third single, became his fourth No.1 hit in July.

&quot;Home&quot; was followed in August 2008 by the single &quot;She Wouldn&#x27;t Be Gone&quot;, his 14th chart entry and his fifth No. 1 hit. It was the first time in his career that he had two consecutive number ones. &quot;She Wouldn&#x27;t Be Gone&quot; is the lead-off to Shelton&#x27;s fifth studio album, &quot;Startin&#x27; Fires,&quot; which has also produced the single &quot;I&#x27;ll Just Hold On&quot;. This album also includes &quot;Bare Skin Rug&quot;, a duet with Lambert.

<text>The 1988 African Cup of Nations was the 16th edition of the Africa Cup of Nations, the association football championship of Africa (CAF). It was hosted by Morocco, who replaced original host Zambia. Just like in 1986, the field of eight teams was split into two groups of four. The tournament final was held in Casablanca at Stade Mohamed V. Cameroon won its second championship, beating Nigeria in the final 1−0.

This tournament has the fewest goals-per-game average in Africa Cup of Nations tournaments.

== Host selection ==
The original host was Zambia but after their withdrawal in December 1986 due to financial issues, the Confederation of African Football approached Algeria which agreed to host the tournament. However, in February
1987 the CAF rescinded this decision following a dispute with Algeria which protested the CAF&#x27;s decision to order a replay of the first leg match of the 1987 All-Africa Games qualification against Tunisia. CAF had made this decision following Tunisia&#x27;s protest that Algeria had fielded two professional players.
Morocco was chosen in the end to host the 1988 Africa Cup of Nations replacing Algeria.
== Qualified teams ==
The 8 qualified teams are:

<text>FLEX is a discontinued single-tasking operating system developed by Technical Systems Consultants (TSC) of West Lafayette, Indiana, for the Motorola 6800 in 1976.

==Overview==
The original version was distributed on 8-inch floppy disks; the (smaller) version for 5.25-inch floppies is called mini-Flex. It was also later ported to the Motorola 6809; that version is called Flex09. All versions are text-based and intended for use on display devices ranging from printing terminals like the Teletype Model 33 ASR to smart terminals. While no graphic displays are supported by TSC software, some hardware supports elementary graphics and pointing devices.

FLEX is a disk-based operating system, using 256-byte sectors on soft-sectored floppies; the disk structure uses linkage bytes in each sector to indicate the next sector in a file or free list. The directory structure is simplified as a result. TSC (and others) provide several programming languages including BASIC in two flavors (standard and extended) and a tokenizing version of extended BASIC called Pre-compiled BASIC, FORTH, C, FORTRAN, and PASCAL.

TSC also wrote a version of FLEX, &quot;Smoke Signal DOS&quot;, for the California hardware manufacturer Smoke Signal Broadcasting; this version uses forward and reverse linkage bytes in each sector which increase disk reliability at the expense of compatibility and speed.

Later, TSC introduced the multitasking, multi-user, Unix-like UniFLEX operating system, which requires DMA disk controllers, 8&quot; disk, and sold in small numbers. Several of the TSC computer languages were ported to UniFLEX.

During the early 1980s, FLEX was offered by Compusense Ltd as an operating system for the 6809-based Dragon 64 home computer.

<doc id="1108287" wikidata="Q110111" url="?curid=1108287" title="Gunnar Nordahl">
<text>Nils Gunnar Nordahl (; 19 October 1921 – 15 September 1995) was a Swedish professional footballer. A highly prolific, powerful, and physically strong striker, with an eye for goal, he is best known for his spell at AC Milan from 1949 to 1956, in which he won the &quot;scudetto&quot; twice, and also the title of &quot;pluricapocannoniere&quot;, with an unprecedented five top scorer (&quot;capocannonieri&quot;) awards, more than any other player in the history of the Italian championship.

Nordahl is Milan’s all-time record goalscorer, and he long held the record for most goals for a single club in the history of Italian league, before being surpassed by Francesco Totti in January 2012. He still holds the record for goals per appearance in Italy. He had several nicknames in Italy, whereof the most famous was &quot;Il Cannoniere&quot; (&quot;The Prime Gunner&quot;). He was also known as &quot;Il Pompiere&quot; (&quot;The Fireman&quot;) and &quot;Il Bisonte&quot; (&quot;The Bison&#x27;&quot;).

A full international between 1942 and 1948, he won 33 caps and scored 43 goals for the Sweden national team. He represented his country at the 1948 Summer Olympics, where he was the joint top scorer alongside Denmark&#x27;s John Hansen as Sweden won gold.

Nordahl is considered to be one of the greatest Swedish players and one of the best strikers of all-time. In 2017, he was included in &quot;FourFourTwo&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the 100 greatest players of all time, at the 54th position.

He is the father of former footballer Thomas Nordahl.

==Club career==

===Sweden===
Nordahl started out at Hörnefors IF in Sweden before moving to first Degerfors IF and then IFK Norrköping. He won four Swedish championships with IFK Norrköping and once scored seven goals in one game. During his time in Swedish clubs, Nordahl scored 149 goals in 172 matches.

===Italy===
Nordahl transferred to AC Milan on 22 January 1949. This made him the first Swedish player to play in a foreign league. Later, he would team up with his national team strike partners, Gunnar Gren and Nils Liedholm to form the renowned Gre-No-Li trio. Playing eight seasons with Milan, he is Serie A&#x27;s multi-top-scorer a record five times (1949–50, 1950–51, 1952–53, 1953–54 and 1954–55). Nordahl is also Milan&#x27;s all-time top-scorer, with 210 league goals.

Nordahl is the third-highest Serie A goalscorer of all time, with 225 goals in 291 matches, only behind Silvio Piola and Francesco Totti. That makes Nordahl the top goalscorer among non-Italian players, and he is also the most efficient goalscorer goals in Serie A ever with 0.77 goals/match. He was nicknamed &quot;Il Pompiere&quot; (&quot;The Fireman&quot;), because of his former job while he played in Sweden.
After leaving Milan, Nordahl played for Roma for two seasons. Nordahl&#x27;s record for most goals scored in Serie A (not including Divisione Nazionale, before Serie A was installed) of 35 in 1949–50 in a season was broken by Gonzalo Higuaín in the 2015–16 season who scored 36. Nordahl, together with the mentioned Gre-No-Li is today legendary in Milan. When Milan striker Andriy Shevchenko scored his 100 goal in Serie A for Milan, it is said that some old Milanese supporters commented: &quot;Well he can double that number, and then add another 26, then, and just then, he has passed &quot;Il Cannoniere&quot;.&quot;

==International career==
Nordahl was first called up to the Sweden national team in 1942. In 1948, he helped Sweden to win the Olympic football tournament, achieving top tournament scoring status. The Swedish team also included his brothers Bertil and Knut Nordahl. Nordahl&#x27;s transfer to Milan forced him to retire from the national team, as the rules at the time prevented professionals from serving on the Sweden national team and unavailble to the 1950 FIFA World Cup as were Gren and Liedholm. His 33 matches in the national team resulted in scoring 43 goals.
However, both Nordahl and other Swedish professionals appeared in the euphemistic &quot;Sveriges proffslandslag&quot; (&quot;Swedish professional national team&quot;) during the 1950s. The latter was discontinued in 1958, when Sweden, like many other nations, lifted the professional ban for respective national team consideration.

<doc id="1108295" wikidata="Q496894" url="?curid=1108295" title="N5 road (Ireland)">
<text>The N5 road is a national primary road in Ireland, connecting Longford town with Westport. It is the main access route from Dublin (via the M4/N4) to most of County Mayo, including the county&#x27;s largest towns, Castlebar, Ballina (via the N26), and Westport.

Almost all of the route has been improved in the 21st century, with the construction of bypasses and extensive resurfacing works on stretches not bypassed. From Longford, the N5 passes through Strokestown and close to Ballaghaderreen, before crossing the N17 at an interchange near Ireland West Airport and continuing westward to bypass Swinford and Castlebar before terminating in Westport. The N26 to Ballina leaves the N5 just outside Swinford. The road is long.

==Standard of route==
The majority of the N5 is a two-lane single carriageway, however a 20km section from Westport to the Castlebar East roundabout is a four-lane dual carriageway without hard shoulders. The single carriageway section has wide driving lanes and hard shoulders for between Castlebar East and Tibohine, near Frenchpark, and between Strokestown and Longford for . The remainder of the route – between Frenchpark and Strokestown – consists of a narrow road with no hard shoulders, and with a poor horizontal and vertical alignment allowing few overtaking opportunities. Construction work to upgrade this section is due to start in 2023 (see below).

==Campaign to upgrade route==
The standard of the N5 road is a significant political issue in Mayo. Local politicians have argued that because the N5 is the main access route to the county, it should be upgraded to a consistent standard - a single carriageway road with hard shoulders, bypassing all towns along the route.

Political arguments were given more weight in recent years when several major multinational firms based in Mayo joined forces to lobby the government to upgrade the N5. The Mayo Industries Group is made up of household names including Coca-Cola (through its Mayo subsidiary Ballina Beverages), Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Baxter and Hollister. The group has met with senior government ministers on several occasions in an attempt to secure funding for further improvements to the road.

==Completed schemes==

===Westport – Turlough===
This comprises a 20km dual carriageway from Westport to the existing N5 near Turlough, bypassing Castlebar, as well as a single carriageway relief road around Westport and the realignment of 2.5km of the N59 road north of the town. An Bórd Pleanala approved the route in May 2014. Contracts were signed in October 2019 for the construction of the project. The Castlebar bypass opened on 26 April 2023, with the remainder of the route to Westport opening on 15 June that year. The original N5 road has been redesignated as a regional route, the R309.

===Ballaghaderreen bypass===
This scheme comprises of standard single carriageway and provides a bypass to the north of Ballaghaderreen town. The project includes realignment/bridging of local roads and a major grade separated junction between the N5 and R293 to provide access to the town. An Bord Pleanála approved the scheme in 2008. Transport Minister Leo Varadkar turned the first sod on the project on 2 November 2012, and the road was opened on 2 September 2014 by Taoiseach Enda Kenny.

===Longford bypass===
This is a standard single carriageway link between the N4 and the existing N5. It provides a bypass to the northwest of Longford town so that traffic between Dublin and Mayo no longer has to pass through Longford town centre. The scheme includes rail and river bridge crossings and access is restricted to the roundabouts at either end of the scheme. Construction commenced in April 2011 and the road opened to traffic on 3 August 2012.

===Charlestown bypass===
An long single carriageway bypass of Charlestown, from east of Carracastle to the end of the Swinford bypass at Cloonlara, began construction in March 2006 and opened on 2 November 2007. It cost €81 million to build.

It is named the John Healy Road in honour of the late Irish Times journalist who wrote about the economic decline of Charlestown in the 1960s.

===Scramoge – Cloonmore===
An stretch of standard single carriageway between Strokestown and Longford commenced construction in September 2001 and was officially opened on 10 May 2004 at a cost of €21 million. The project includes two river bridges, one rail bridge, 500 metres of culverts and 600,000 cubic metres of earthworks - including excavation of 350,000 cubic metres of peat.

===Swinford bypass===
A single carriageway bypass of Swinford was completed in 1996. It incorporates a major junction with the N26 road to Ballina. The junctions on this scheme are all at-grade and this has led to safety concerns, with high collision rates at the R320, R375 and N26 junctions. The singer Ronan Keating&#x27;s brother was killed in one of the numerous fatal collisions along this part of the N5, leading to repeated calls from the Mayo county coroner for safety improvements to be made. There is a proposal to grade separate these junctions by providing overbridges for crossing traffic. 

===Castlebar – Turlough===
This single carriageway includes a bypass of Turlough village and a relief road around Castlebar which opened in 1990. The western end of this scheme, including the Castlebar relief road, was itself bypassed and redesignated as the R309 after the 2023 opening of the Turlough to Westport dual-carriageway.

==Schemes in planning or construction==
===Scramoge – Ballaghaderreen===
The project involves the upgrade of the N5 in County Roscommon between Rathkeery at the eastern end of the Ballaghaderreen bypass and Scramoge, east of Strokestown. It will bypass Frenchpark, Bellanagare, Tulsk and Strokestown. The planned route, a stretch of single carriageway, was approved by An Bord Pleanala in January 2019. Contracts for the construction of the project were signed in October 2021, with Roadbridge awarded the contract. However, Roadbridge collapsed in March 2022. The project was re-tendered and construction was due to start in late 2023. Contracts were signed with Wills Bros, the new contractor, on 8 December 2023.

===Turlough – Bohola===
The Turlough to Bohola road scheme will facilitate the upgrade of the N5 from east of Castlebar to east of Bohola. The project will combine an online upgrade of the existing N5 west of Bellavary with offline bypasses of both Bellavary and Bohola. A preferred route corridor has been selected.

==Route through Longford and Roscommon==

The N5 leaves the N4 on the northwest side of Longford. The first of the route follows a new bypass road that was completed in August 2012. Approximately west of the town, the N5 crosses the River Shannon into County Roscommon at &quot;Tarmonbarry Bridge&quot;. The road passes by Scramoge along a realignment (opened in May 2004) on the way to Strokestown. West of Strokestown, at Tulsk, the N61 crosses the N5. The route continues northwest and passes north of Ballaghaderreen (alignment opened in 2014) before crossing into County Mayo.

==Route through Mayo==

The N5 continues west bypassing Carracastle and Charlestown (bypass opened 2007). The N17 crosses the route near Charlestown. The N26 joins the N5 at Cloonlara just east of Swinford (bypassed to the south by the N5 &quot;Swinford Bypass&quot;). The N5 runs west/southwest through Bohola to Bellavary, where it meets the N58. The N5 continues west towards Castlebar, where it bypasses the town on the southeastern side as a dual carriageway, with grade-separated junctions for the N60 (for Roscommon town via Claremorris and Ballyhaunis) and N84 (for Galway via Ballinrobe and Headford) roads. The dual carriageway ends at a roundabout on the outskirts of Westport, while the N5 continues as a single carriageway, bypassing Westport to the north, before terminating at a roundabout junction with the N59. The N5 is County Mayo&#x27;s busiest road with traffic counts of almost 10,000 vehicles per day between Westport and Bellavary. Conversely, some parts of the route through County Roscommon have less than 5,000 vehicles daily (https://www.tii.ie/tii-library/strategic-planning/tii-road-network-indicators/TII-National-Roads-Network-Indicators-2022.pdf)

<doc id="1108299" wikidata="Q515037" url="?curid=1108299" title="1994 African Cup of Nations">
<text>The 1994 African Cup of Nations, known as the [[Nescafé]] 1994 Africa Cup of Nations for sponsorship purposes, was the 19th edition of the African Cup of Nations, the biennial international men&#x27;s football championship of Africa organised by the Confederation of African Football (CAF). The tournament was played between 26 March and 10 April 1994 in Tunisia, taking place in the country for the second time following the 1965 editions. Tunisia host the tournament, who replaced original hosts Zaire. The Zambian team was recently formed, following an air disaster in which eighteen players and several staff members of the previous team had been killed.

The defending champions were Ivory Coast from the 1992 edition. A total of 20 matches were played, in which 44 goals were scored, at an average of 2.2 goals per match. Attendance at all stages of the tournament reached 267,400, averaging 13,370 viewers per match. Qualification took place from 14 June 1992 to 24 October 1993. Ivory Coast as title holder and Tunisia as host country automatically qualified for the final phase of the tournament. As in the 1992 edition, twelve teams, divided into four groups each comprising tree teams, took part in the competition. Host Tunisia were eliminated from the group stage, which became the biggest failure in the history of the team. The defending champions Ivory Coast were eliminated in the semi-finals after losing in penalties against Nigeria.

Nigeria won the title for the second time in their history, after beating Zambia in the final match with a score of 2–1. Ivory Coast secured third place after beating Mali in the third place match, which placed them fourth. Nigerian Rashidi Yekini scored 5 goals at the end of the tournament, so he won the top scorer award, also he won the best player award. As champions, Nigeria qualified for the 1995 King Fahd Cup in Saudi Arabia, as a representative of African continent.

== Teams ==
Ten tickets are to be distributed to the 37 countries participating in these qualifications. Tunisia, the tournament organizer, and the Ivory Coast, the defending champion, are exempt from these games. After a preliminary round played in two-way matches involving four teams (two qualified for the main round), the teams are divided into eight groups of four. The first in each group as well as the second in groups of 5 or 6 obtain their ticket for the final tournament in Tunisia. In addition to the withdrawals during the competition of Togo, Chad, Tanzania and Burkina Faso, the selections of Mauritania and Libya, initially registered, withdraw before the start of the qualifications.

Note for these qualifiers the debut in official international competition of the selection of Cape Verde, eliminated in the preliminary round, and the first participation of South Africa, banned from world football since the establishment of apartheid. The end of South Africa&#x27;s segregationist policy allows the reintegration of Bafana Bafana into the CAF.

Subsequently, he featured in several commercially successful films, including, &quot;Kasoor&quot; (2001) for which he received Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Negative Role and a nomination for Filmfare Best Villain Award, &quot;Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai&quot; (2002), &quot;Awara Paagal Deewana&quot; (2002), &quot;Hungama&quot; (2003), &quot;Masti&quot; (2004). His debut film in Tamil cinema was &quot;Bhaskar Oru Rascal&quot; (2018). He made his debut in Kannada cinema with the commercial hit movie &quot;Kotigobba 3 &quot; (2021).

== Personal life ==
Shivdasani was born in Mumbai in a Sindhi Hindu family to Prem and Putli Shivdasani. His mother is an Irani Zoroastrian. Shivdasani studied at St. Xavier&#x27;s High School, Fort, then graduated from H. R. College of Commerce in Mumbai. In 2012, he got engaged to Nin Dusanj, a London-based Punjabi who grew up in London and later moved to Hong Kong, working within the advertising and luxury branding industries in Asia. On 5 June 2014, he married Dusanj at a private ceremony attended only by both their families. They have a daughter, Nevaeh, born in 2020.

== Career ==

=== 1987–1994: Child roles ===
Shivdasani was selected as the Farex baby (baby food brand) at age 14 months and from that point on he appeared in many TV commercials. He made his Bollywood debut as a child actor in &quot;Mr. India&quot; (1987), then appearing in films such as &quot;Awwal Number&quot;, &quot;Shahenshah&quot;, &quot;ChaalBaaz&quot; and &quot;Insaniyat&quot;. He also played the child role for Inspector Vijaykumar Srivastav in the 1988 film &#x27;Shahenshah&#x27;, who would later be played by Amitabh Bachchan for the remainder of the film.

=== 1999–2008: Switch to adult roles and breakthrough ===

Shivdasani continued appearing in commercials until the age of 19 when he was offered a lead role in director Ram Gopal Varma&#x27;s &quot;Mast&quot; opposite Urmila Matondkar while still studying at H.R. College. Shivdasani made his debut as an adult opposite Matondkar in &quot;Mast&quot;. The film became an instant flop although Shivdasani won the Zee Cine Award for Best Male Debut and the Star Screen Award for Most Promising Newcomer – Male for his performance in &quot;Mast&quot;. He earned critical acclaim for his performance. Mohammad Ali Ikram of PlanetBollywood.com praised his performance and wrote: &quot;Newcomer Aftab Shivdasani comes across as a bit young and aimless when the movie opens, but as you watch the proceedings, you&#x27;ll learn that this bit of casting makes perfect sense considering Kittu&#x27;s immaturity and innocence.&quot;

In 2001, Shivdasani made his comeback to acting with his second film, Vikram Bhatt’s &quot;Kasoor&quot; opposite the debutant Lisa Ray. Shivdasani played a negative role and shot to instant fame with his portrayal of Shekhar Saxena, a well-known journalist, who murders his wife. His performance in the film earned him a nomination for the Filmfare Best Villain Award and a Zee Cine Award for Best Actor in a Negative Role. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama noticed the improvement in his acting and praised his performance. &quot;Aftab, as the suave publishing magnate, catches you unaware with a performance that is first-rate. His characterisation is dissimilar from the one he played in his debut-making venture &quot;Mast&quot;. His work should catapult him to the league of genteel artists.&quot; His next release of that year saw him paired with Ram Gopal Varma again after &quot;Mast&quot; in &quot;Love Ke Liye Kuch Bhi Karega&quot;, in which Shivdasani starred in a supporting role opposite Saif Ali Khan, Fardeen Khan, Twinkle Khanna and Sonali Bendre. Shivdasani&#x27;s performance was applauded by Taran Adarsh and considered to be better than the other two heroes. Taran Adarsh wrote &quot;Aftab plays to the gallery and gives a good account of himself. Aftab has an edge over the other two heroes because his character is mass appealing. His scenes with Johny Lever are simply superb.&quot; However, the film failed at the box office. His last release of the year was Rajiv Rai&#x27;s &quot;Pyaar Ishq Aur Mohabbat&quot;, in which Shivdasani played Taj Bharadwaj, one of the three lead roles with the debutant Arjun Rampal and Suniel Shetty opposite Kirti Reddy. Shivdasani was praised by Taran Adarsh. &quot;Aftab Shivdasani has an edge thanks to his lovable characterization. He is natural.&quot; Pankaj Shukla of SmasHits wrote &quot;Aftab is impressive as usual and is fast maturing as an actor.&quot;

In 2002, Shivdasani&#x27;s first two films &quot;Koi Mere Dil Se Poochhe&quot; opposite debutant Esha Deol was a failure but &quot;Kya Yehi Pyaar Hai&quot; opposite Ameesha Patel was successful at the box office. His third release of that year was Rajkumar Kohli&#x27;s multi-starrer supernatural horror &quot;Jaani Dushman: Ek Anokhi Kahani&quot; that was a disaster. His fourth film of 2002 was the multi-starrer action comedy &quot;Awara Paagal Deewana&quot;, that proved to be a successful movie and became the seventh highest grosser movie of that year. It was an average grosser. His final release of that year was &quot;Pyaasa&quot;.

Shivdasani had some failures in 2003 with the multi-starrer &quot;Darna Mana Hai&quot;, which was a commercial failure at the box office but it was critically successful. His role of Purab, a young college student who has the ability to stop and move people, was critically praised. His next release was Priyadarshan&#x27;s comedy film &quot;Hungama&quot; opposite Akshaye Khanna and the debutant Rimi Sen, which was his biggest success of that year. His third and final release of that year was &quot;Footpath&quot; opposite Bipasha Basu, Rahul Dev and debutant Emraan Hashmi, which failed to do well at the box office.

Shivdasani&#x27;s first two releases of 2004 were &quot;Suno Sasurjee&quot; opposite Ameesha Patel, and &quot;Muskaan&quot; opposite Gracy Singh. His third release of that year was Indra Kumar&#x27;s comedy film &quot;&quot;, in which he starred opposite Vivek Oberoi, Ritesh Deshmukh, Amrita Rao, Genelia D&#x27;Souza, Tara Sharma, Lara Dutta and Ajay Devgan. The film became a hit. His last release of that year was &quot;&quot; opposite Anupam Kher and Shriya Saran.

In 2005, Shivdasani&#x27;s films included &quot;Mr Ya Miss&quot; opposite Antara Mali and &quot;Koi Aap Sa&quot; opposite Anita Hassanandani Reddy and Dipannita Sharma. The former was a flop while the latter was average at the box office. All of Shivdasani&#x27;s films, especially &quot;Ankahee&quot;, were failures in 2006. Shivdasani found failures with multi-starrer films in 2007 and 2008.

=== 2009–present: &quot;Aao Wish Karein&quot; and recent projects ===
In 2009, Shivdasani acted in &quot;Aao Wish Karein&quot;, the first film produced under his production company, Rising Sun Entertainment. He helped co-write the script and also played the lead character, Mickey. The same year, Shivdasani appeared in &quot;Acid Factory&quot;. In 2011, Shivdasani played the lead role in the comedy film &quot;Bin Bulaye Baraati&quot; opposite Priyanka Kothari. Shivdasani&#x27;s next release was 2012 super-hit &quot;1920: The Evil Returns&quot; in which he played the lead role opposite Twinkle Bajpai. His next film &quot;Grand Masti&quot;, a sequel to the 2004 blockbuster &quot;Masti&quot; was also a huge success like the original grossing over 100crores at the box office. In January 2016 part 3 of the hit franchise &quot;Kyaa Kool Hai Hum&quot; was released where Aftab starred alongside Tusshar Kapoor the film was a hit at the box office. In July 2016 the third instalment of the super hit Masti series, Great Grand Masti was released.

In 2021, he took part in a commercially successful Kannada movie, Kotigobba 3, as a police officer. Later that year, Shivdasani starred as Vijay Kumar, a RAW officer in Special Ops 1.5: The Himmat Story, the sequel to Neeraj Panday’s hit series Special Ops on Disney+ Hotstar. His performance received commercial and critical appreciation from all and was also hailed as the surprise package of the second season.

<text>George Riley Puckett (May 7, 1894 – July 13, 1946) was an American country music artist, best known as a member of Gid Tanner and the Skillet Lickers.

His dynamic single-string guitar playing, featuring dramatic bass runs, earned for him an enviable reputation as an instrumentalist. Many aspiring guitarists who followed him have studied and copied his style. Although he was an accomplished musician on several instruments, his singing was most responsible for establishing him as an important figure in the history of country music.

==Biography==
Puckett was born in Dallas, Georgia, United States. An incorrect treatment of his eyes using lead acetate during infancy left him blind. He had his formal education at the Georgia School for the Blind in Macon, Georgia.

He sang and played guitar and banjo. He was first heard on the radio as a part of Clayton McMichen&#x27;s Hometown Band.

His vocalizing was a regular feature at the Georgia Old-Time Fiddlers Conventions. Newspaper reporters covering these events referred to him as the &quot;Bald Mountain Caruso&quot;, in admiration of his renditions of such songs as &quot;When You and I Were Young, Maggie&quot; and &quot;Sleep, Baby, Sleep&quot;. For several years, Puckett played and sang with the Home Town Boys, a string-band ensemble composed of Atlanta-area musicians. They made their debut on Atlanta&#x27;s six-month-old radio station, WSB, on September 18, 1922. Until going off the air in 1926, they remained one of the station&#x27;s most popular acts. In 1925, only Vernon Dalhart sold more records on the Columbia label than Puckett.

In 1924, Puckett accompanied fiddler Gid Tanner to New York, where, on March 7 and 8, they recorded twelve songs and tunes for the Columbia Phonograph Company. They were the first country-music artists to record for that firm. These recording sessions yielded vocal selections by Puckett and fiddle tunes by Tanner. One of Puckett&#x27;s songs, &quot;Rock All Our Babies to Sleep&quot;, (Columbia #107-D, with &quot;Little Old Log Cabin in the Lane&quot;, on the reverse side), established him as probably the first country-music artist to yodel on records. It pre-dated Jimmie Rodgers first yodeling recordings by three years. Yodeling was employed as an embellishment by numerous country music vocalists well into the 1940s.

On November 4, 1929, Puckett, Clayton McMichen, Lowe Stokes, Fate Norris, Bert Layne, Uncle Fuzz (prob. Frank Walker, Tom Dorsey (aka Dan Hornsby) recorded in Atlanta, the track, &quot;A Night in a Blind Tiger&quot; on Columbia Records, and continued recording together on Blue Bird Records in March 1934, in San Antonio, Texas.

Puckett was a charter member of the influential string band Gid Tanner and His Skillet Lickers, and continued to record with the group through their last session in 1934. Puckett recorded as a solo artist into the early 1940s, creating a discography of more than 200 records on such labels as Columbia, Decca, and Bluebird. His repertoire included novelty songs, religious songs, traditional folk songs, cowboy songs, and ballads from the field of popular music.

He was one of the nationally known pioneer country music artists, who gained experience and exposure at the Georgia Old-Time Fiddlers Conventions, held in Atlanta between 1913 and 1934.

In addition to making records, he appeared in stage shows and worked on radio stations in Atlanta and other Georgia cities, as well as selected eastern and midwestern cities. He died of blood poisoning on July 13, 1946, in East Point, Georgia. He had developed a pimple on his neck which turned into a boil. He ignored medical attention and continued to work until he became very ill. A doctor lanced the boil but it was too late, as sepsis had already set in, and he died in the hospital. He is buried at Enon Baptist Church. Riley Puckett was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame in 1986.

<text>The women&#x27;s [[modern pentathlon]] at the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] took place at the Olympic Modern Pentathlon Centre in Goudi Olympic Complex on 27 August. On its second appearance at the Olympics, thirty-two athletes from 21 nations participated in this event.

Zsuzsanna Vörös of Hungary emerged as the top favorite in the women&#x27;s event, and won the gold medal, with a score of 5,448 points. Meanwhile, Jeļena Rubļevska set a historic milestone as the first female Latvian to win an Olympic medal, taking the silver in this event. Great Britain&#x27;s Georgina Harland claimed the nation&#x27;s second Olympic bronze medal, and third overall for the women&#x27;s.

==Competition format==
The modern pentathlon consisted of five events, with all five held in one day.

* Shooting: A 4.5 mm air pistol shooting (the athlete must hit 20 shots, one at each target). Score was based on the number of shots hitting at each target.
* Fencing: A round-robin, one-touch épée competition. Score was based on winning percentage.
* Swimming: A 200 m freestyle race. Score was based on time.
* Horse-riding: A show jumping competition. Score based on penalties for fallen bars, refusals, falls, and being over the time limit.
* Running: A 3 km run. Starts are staggered (based on points from first four events), so that the first to cross the finish line wins.

==Schedule==

==Results==
* Did not finish the riding course because of the exceeding number of obstacle and time penalties

<text>Project Chatter was a United States Navy program beginning in the fall of 1947 focusing on the identification and testing of drugs in interrogations and the recruitment of agents. Their search included laboratory experiments on both animal and human subjects. The program operated under the direction of Charles Savage of the Naval Medical Research Institute, Bethesda, Maryland, from 1947 to 1953. The project was geared toward identifying agents both synthetic and natural that were effective during interrogation, as well as testing possible treatments for depression. The project was centered on, but not restricted to, the use of anabasine (an alkaloid), scopolamine and mescaline. It was the first U.S. government project in which lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) was used on human subjects. The Navy ended the project in 1953 when its experiments were merged into Project MKULTRA.

<doc id="1108335" wikidata="Q59904" url="?curid=1108335" title="Herbert von Bismarck">
<text>Nikolaus Heinrich Ferdinand Herbert, Prince of Bismarck (born Nikolaus Heinrich Ferdinand Herbert Graf von Bismarck-Schönhausen; 28 December 1849 – 18 September 1904) was a German politician, who served as Foreign Secretary from 1886 to 1890. His political career was closely tied to that of his father, Otto von Bismarck, and he left office a few days after his father&#x27;s dismissal. He succeeded his father as the 2nd Prince of Bismarck in 1898. He was born in Berlin and died in Friedrichsruh. 

==Early life==
Herbert von Bismarck born in Berlin, the oldest son of Otto von Bismarck and his wife, Johanna, née von Puttkamer. He had an older sister, Marie (b. 1848), and a younger brother, Wilhelm (b. 1852). He fought in the Franco-Prussian War, sustaining a bullet wound through the left leg during a cavalry charge at the Battle of Mars-La-Tour. He joined the diplomatic service in 1874 on his father&#x27;s wishes. Bismarck attempted to gain influence with the heir to the German throne, Prince Wilhelm, by appealing to his narcissism. In June 1884, he wrote to thank Wilhelm for a portrait that Wilhelm had given to him after they returned from a state visit to Russia: 

Bismarck became Under-Secretary and acting head of the Foreign Office in 1885, and the following year, he was appointed the State Secretary for Foreign Affairs. He additionally was appointed Minister of State of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1888. He once said, &quot;My father is the only person who can handle this business&quot; In 1890, when Kaiser Wilhelm II called for the resignation of Otto von Bismarck as Chancellor, Herbert von Bismarck also resigned as State Secretary, despite Wilhelm&#x27;s attempts to retain him so that his &quot;de facto&quot; dismissal of his father would &quot;look better in the eyes of the world&quot;.

==Personal life==
Bismarck had wanted to marry Princess Elisabeth zu Carolath-Beuthen in 1881, but his father would not allow it, as she was a Catholic divorcée and was ten years older than Herbert. The Chancellor pressured his son with tears, blackmail and threats to disinherit him by getting Kaiser Wilhelm I to change the primogeniture statutes. That experience left Herbert a very bitter and alcoholic man. He once shot five bullets through a Foreign Office window, to be told he may have hit someone. He replied, &quot;Officials have to be kept in a permanent state of irritation and alarm; the moment that ceases they stop working&quot;.

On 21 June 1892 in Vienna, he married Countess Marguerite, Countess of Hoyos, a member of the originally Spanish House of Hoyos from Hungary. She herself was half-English and a grand-daughter of Robert Whitehead, the inventor of the torpedo. They had five children: 

*Countess Hannah Leopoldine Alice von Bismarck-Schönhausen (1893–1971), married Leopold von Bredow (1875–1933)
*Countess Maria Goedela von Bismarck-Schönhausen (1896–1981), married Hermann Graf Keyserling (1880–1946)
*HSH Otto Christian Archibald, Prince von Bismarck (1897–1975), married Ann-Mari Tengbom (1907–1999)
*Count Gottfried Alexander Georg Herbert von Bismarck-Schönhausen (1901–1949), married Countess Melanie, Countess of Hoyos (1916–1949)
*Count Albrecht Edzard Heinrich Karl von Bismarck-Schönhausen (1903–1970), married Mona Travis Strader (1897–1983).

He was at his father&#x27;s bedside when the latter died on 30 July 1898, at 10:57 p.m.

He died in Friedrichsruh.

The capital of the German colonial administration of German New Guinea was called Herbertshöhe (now Kokopo) in his honor.
