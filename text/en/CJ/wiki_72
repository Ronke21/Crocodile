<text>Robert John Valentine (born May 13, 1950), nicknamed &quot;Bobby V&quot;, is an American former professional baseball player and manager. He also served as the athletic director at Sacred Heart University. Valentine played for the Los Angeles Dodgers (1969, 1971–72), California Angels (1973–1975), San Diego Padres (1975-1977), New York Mets (1977–78), and Seattle Mariners (1979) in MLB. He managed the Texas Rangers (1985–1992), the New York Mets (1996–2002), and the Boston Red Sox (2012) of MLB, as well as the Chiba Lotte Marines of Nippon Professional Baseball (1995, 2004–2009).

Valentine has been an analyst for ESPN&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot;. In February 2013, CBSSports.com hired Valentine to represent its Fantasy Sports business, including running a viral marketing campaign in which he made fun of the many times he was fired in his career and gave fans a chance to &quot;Hire or Fire Bobby V&quot; one more time.

On November 2, 2021, Valentine lost the election to become mayor of his hometown of Stamford, Connecticut, to Caroline Simmons, the first female elected mayor in Stamford.

==Early years==
Valentine was born in Stamford, Connecticut, to Joseph and Grace Valentine. He attended Rippowam High School in Stamford, Connecticut, where he was an All-State player in football, baseball and track. He is the only three-time All-State football player in Connecticut history. He set state records for career touchdowns (53), career interceptions for TD (5) and 60-yard dash. The career interception for TD record remains, having later been tied by two other players. As a sophomore in 1965, he averaged 5.6 yards a carry, scored 21 touchdowns and led Rippowam to a 9–0 record and a state championship. He was also a champion ballroom dancer as a teenager, winning a regional competition with his partner at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York and took part in the opening ceremonies of the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. He was president of the student council.

He was recruited by the University of Nebraska, the University of Notre Dame and the University of Southern California as a star in football and baseball, but ultimately chose USC. In 1967, he played collegiate summer baseball for the Yarmouth Indians of the Cape Cod Baseball League. The Los Angeles Dodgers drafted him fifth overall in the 1968 Major League Baseball draft and he signed with the Dodgers, receiving a $65,000 signing bonus. He attended both USC and Arizona State University while in the Dodgers organization and was a member of the Sigma Chi Fraternity. His roommate at USC was Bill Buckner, who was the Dodgers second round pick in 1968.

==Playing career==
===Minor leagues (1968–1970)===
At age 18, Valentine made his professional debut playing with the Ogden Dodgers of the Rookie Pioneer League, winning the league&#x27;s MVP Award, hitting .281 with a .460 slugging percentage and leading the league with 20 stolen bases. He was one of only three players in the league to appear in every game. His roommate was Tom Paciorek and was also teammates with Bill Buckner and Steve Garvey. The manager at Ogden was Tommy Lasorda, the start of a friendship that has lasted four decades. In 1969, Valentine impressive enough in Spring Training that he was promoted to the Class AAA Spokane Indians of the Pacific Coast League. After the PCL season ended, he debuted with the Los Angeles Dodgers as a September call-up in 1969 at 19 years old. Though he did not record a major league at-bat that season, he appeared in 5 games as a pinch runner, scoring three runs.

Back with the Spokane Indians for 1970, Valentine was again his league&#x27;s MVP after batting .340 with fourteen home runs and leading the Pacific Coast League in eight offensive categories. Led by Valentine and manager Lasorda, Spokane won the league championship over the Hawaii Islanders. He suffered a fractured cheekbone when he was beaned in the PCL playoffs that season and also had right knee surgery to repair a ruptured ligament in January 1971.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (1971–1972)===
Valentine made the Dodgers out of Spring Training in 1971 and batted .249 with one home run and 25 RBIs in 101 games. His first career MLB hit came on April 25, 1971, an RBI single off Milt Wilcox, scoring Steve Garvey in a 4–2 Dodgers win over the Reds. The following season in 1972, he managed to play in 119 games by playing many different positions—including shortstop, second base, third and all three outfield positions and his batting average improved to .274. He missed time after sustaining a broken nose. Following the season on November 28, 1972, he was packaged in a trade along with Frank Robinson, Billy Grabarkewitz, Bill Singer and Mike Strahler to the California Angels for Andy Messersmith and Ken McMullen.

===California Angels (1973–1975)===
Prior to the start of the 1973 season, Valentine was named Caribbean Series MVP playing shortstop for the series champions from the Dominican Republic, Tigres del Licey. The team was managed by Tommy Lasorda.

As a regular starter for the Angels, Valentine had a strong start, leading the Angels with a .302 batting average. Four days after his 23rd birthday, he suffered a multiple compound leg fracture on May 17, 1973, at Anaheim Stadium in a game against the Oakland Athletics after his spikes got caught in the outfield&#x27;s chain link fence while attempting to catch a home run ball hit by Dick Green, one of only three home runs hit by Green during the season. He missed the remainder of the 1973 season and never regained his speed as the bones did not heal properly. Two days prior to the injury, Valentine was playing center field when Nolan Ryan threw his first career No-hitter. Valentine would later be Ryan&#x27;s manager in Texas for his last two No-hitters (6th and 7th). In 1974, despite still recovering from his leg injury, Valentine made 414 plate appearances, the second most of his career, and batted .261 with three home runs. On April 4, 1975, the Angels loaned him to the Charleston Charlies, a AAA Pittsburgh Pirates organization where he played in 56 games before returning to the Angels organization on June 20, 1975. He was assigned to the Angels AAA affiliate Salt Lake City Bees and played in 46 games batting .306 before being called back up to the Angels On September 17, 1975, he was traded to the San Diego Padres with Rudy Meoli for Gary Ross. On September 19, 1975, in his first game as a Padre, Valentine homered off Mike Caldwell in a 3–1 loss to the Giants.

===San Diego Padres/New York Mets (1976–1978)===
In 1976, Valentine spent most of the season with Padres AAA affiliate, the Hawaii Islanders, playing in 120 games batting .304 with 13 home runs. On June 15, 1977, after playing 44 games with the Padres, he was part of the New York Mets infamous &quot;Midnight Massacre&quot;, when the Mets traded Dave Kingman to San Diego for minor league pitcher Paul Siebert and Valentine, sent Tom Seaver to the Cincinnati Reds for Pat Zachry, Doug Flynn, Steve Henderson, and Dan Norman, and Mike Phillips to the St. Louis Cardinals for Joel Youngblood.

===Seattle Mariners===
Valentine&#x27;s role with the Mets became even more limited, and he was released in spring training, 1979. He signed with the Seattle Mariners shortly afterwards, and made his debut as a catcher that season. Following the season, he retired from baseball at 29 years of age.

==Managerial career==

===Texas Rangers===
Valentine was serving as a member of the Mets coaching staff when he was selected by the Texas Rangers to take over managing duties from Doug Rader 32 games into the 1985 season. The Rangers went 53–76 the rest of the season, finishing with an overall record of 62–99. In 1986 the Rangers finished second in the American League West with a record of 87–75, and Valentine finished second in voting for the AL Manager of the Year. The Rangers fell back into sixth place the following two seasons, and Valentine was fired by managing partner George W. Bush halfway through the 1992 season with a record of 45–41. Toby Harrah took over as manager, and led the Rangers to a 77–85 record and a fourth-place finish. Valentine finished his Rangers&#x27; managerial career with a record of 581 wins and 605 losses with no post–season appearances.

In 1989, while still managing the Rangers, Valentine worked as an on-the-field analyst for NBC&#x27;s 1989 ALCS coverage alongside Bob Costas and Tony Kubek.

===Norfolk Tides===
In 1994, Valentine managed the Mets&#x27; Triple-A affiliate, the Norfolk Tides, to a 67–75 record, and finished fourth in the five-team West Division of the International League.

===Chiba Lotte Marines===
In 1995, Valentine began his first stint as manager of the Chiba Lotte Marines in the Japanese Pacific League. That season, the team surprised most Japanese baseball fans by finishing in second place (69–58–3); the Marines had not won the Japanese Pacific league pennant since 1974. However, he was fired abruptly due to a personal conflict with general manager Tatsuro Hirooka, despite having a two-year contract.

===New York Mets===
Valentine returned to the Norfolk Tides in 1996, managing them to an 82–59 record and second place in the International League&#x27;s West Division. He then was promoted to manager of the Mets with 31 games left in the 1996 season, and led them to a 12–19 record the rest of the way.

Over the next two seasons, Valentine led a Mets resurgence, finishing 14 games over .500 (88–74) both years. In the 12th inning of a 14-inning marathon against the Toronto Blue Jays on June 9, 1999, Valentine was ejected by home plate umpire Randy Marsh for arguing a catcher&#x27;s interference call against Mike Piazza. Valentine returned to the dugout an inning later disguised with sunglasses and a fake moustache made from eye black. The Mets went on to win the game 4–3, and Major League Baseball fined Valentine $5,000 and suspended him for two games.

Valentine led the Mets to a record of 97–66 and a wild card playoff berth that season. The Mets defeated the Arizona Diamondbacks in four games (3–1) en route to the National League Championship Series, where they eventually lost to their division rival the Atlanta Braves in six games (4–2).

In early 2000, Valentine allegedly mentioned to students at the University of Pennsylvania&#x27;s Wharton School of Business somewhat cynical, insider comments regarding a handful of Mets players and the organization as a whole. The incident was called &quot;The Whartongate Affair&quot;. That year Valentine returned as Mets manager, finishing with a 94–68 record and another wild card playoff berth. This time the Mets were successful in winning the National League pennant, defeating the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2000 National League Championship Series in five games (4–1). The Mets lost the 2000 World Series to their crosstown rivals the New York Yankees in five games (4–1).

On July 14, 2001, Valentine won his 1,000th game as manager, doing so against the Boston Red Sox in his 1,958th game as manager.

Valentine won the 2002 Branch Rickey Award for his donations and personal work with survivors of the September 11 attacks. Valentine had an uneasy, if not volatile relationship with general manager Steve Phillips, who fired three of Valentine&#x27;s coaches at the end of one season and refused to discipline Rickey Henderson and Bobby Bonilla for their actions in 1999 (the two were seen playing cards during the end of the NLCS that year and the latter asked Valentine to a fight in the dugout). At one point, Phillips refused to let Valentine attend the winter meetings. At the end of the 2002 season, with owner Jeff Wilpon seeing no optimism for improvement in 2003, fired Valentine. Valentine described himself as a scapegoat and stated, &quot;Nobody in this organization has done more for the community than I have. Steve Phillips has done nothing in the community. I went to his church for a father-son night, his church, and he was late.&quot;

He finished his Mets managerial career with a record of 536 wins and 467 losses.

===Second stint with the Chiba Lotte Marines===

In 2004, Valentine rejoined the Chiba Lotte Marines as manager, and in 2005 led the Marines to their first Pacific League pennant since 1974 following a close playoff with the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks. On October 26, 2005, the Marines won the Japan Series in a four-game sweep of the Hanshin Tigers. The next day Valentine issued a challenge to the World Series champion Chicago White Sox on behalf of the Marines, calling for a series to be played between the American and Japanese championship teams.

Following their Japan Series championship, the Marines won the inaugural Asia Series by defeating the Samsung Lions of the Korea Baseball Organization in November 2005. Valentine aided in bringing innovative promotions to Japan, which doubled Marine attendance during his tenure. Some of these gimmicks, like allowing children to run the bases after games or dedicated autograph sessions, are common in America but were unseen in Japan; others, such as Valentine hosting dance classes for female fans, played on the manager&#x27;s personal appeal (and his history—Valentine was a competition ballroom dancer in his youth). In 2008, Valentine was the subject of the ESPN Films documentary &quot;The Zen of Bobby V.&quot;, which followed Valentine and his 2007 Marines team. &quot;The Zen of Bobby V.&quot; was an official selection at the 2008 Tribeca Film Festival. The Marines let Valentine go after the 2009 season after an extensive smear campaign led by club president Ryuzo Setoyama, which ironically backfired and resulted in an overflow of support for Valentine by local fans. In the end, Valentine was fired, even though a petition to extend his contract was presented to the organization with 112,000 signatures. This would lead to several members of the Marines&#x27; then ouendan fan club, MVP, to be banned from Chiba Marine Stadium for life, as they wouldn&#x27;t stop chanting obscenities at management to keep Valentine, which also led to MVP&#x27;s disbandment after 2009.

===ESPN===
Valentine accepted a position as a baseball analyst for ESPN. He had previously appeared on the cable network&#x27;s &quot;Baseball Tonight&quot; show in 2003. He made his broadcasting debut for the 2009 American and National League Championship Series and World Series.

In late 2009, Valentine was a candidate to replace Eric Wedge as manager of the Cleveland Indians. The position, however, went to Manny Acta.

Valentine continued working with ESPN for the 2010 MLB season. He was interviewed for the Baltimore Orioles managerial position after manager Dave Trembley was fired in early June; Valentine later withdrew his name from consideration. Valentine was considered a front runner for the Florida Marlins managerial position that opened after manager Fredi González was fired in late June. However, Valentine confirmed he was no longer a candidate for the position after Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria stated that Edwin Rodríguez, the interim manager they summoned to replace Gonzalez, would manage the team through the 2010 season. With the firing of the New York Mets manager Jerry Manuel at the end of the 2010 season, New York sports media speculated that Valentine would return to manage the team. It was also reported that the Toronto Blue Jays and Seattle Mariners had interviewed Valentine for their open managerial positions. Valentine was interviewed by the Milwaukee Brewers for their managerial opening in October 2010. He was believed to be a finalist along with Bob Melvin, Joey Cora, and Ron Roenicke. The Brewers job eventually went to Angels bench coach Ron Roenicke.

On December 1, 2010, Valentine, Orel Hershiser and Dan Shulman were named as ESPN&#x27;s new &quot;Sunday Night Baseball&quot; crew for the 2011 MLB season. In June 2011, news outlets reported that Valentine was once again a candidate for the Florida Marlins managerial position after the ballclub free fell in the standings. That did not come to fruition, however, as the Marlins hired former White Sox manager Ozzie Guillén.

===Boston Red Sox===

On November 21, 2011, Bobby met with the Boston Red Sox for a formal interview for the open manager&#x27;s position, and on November 29, it was reported that he would be the new Red Sox manager and the successor to Terry Francona. Valentine was introduced by Red Sox General Manager Ben Cherington on December 2, 2011, and chose to wear number 25 in honor of the late Tony Conigliaro, with whom he briefly roomed during spring training 1976 with the San Diego Padres.

Valentine&#x27;s first and only season with Boston was marred by undermining from the front office, injuries, public feuds with players, run-ins with the media, and a tumultuous relationship with his coaches. Under Valentine&#x27;s management, the 2012 Red Sox finished last in the AL East at 69–93, their worst record in 47 years.
Valentine was fired by the Red Sox on October 4, 2012, one day after the conclusion of the regular season.

==Managerial record==


==Sacred Heart University==
Valentine took over as athletic director at Sacred Heart University in Fairfield, Connecticut, on July 1, 2013.

During his tenure Valentine helped to raise the visibility of Pioneer athletics, with appearances on ESPN, SNY and other national and regional media outlets. He oversaw the replacement of the playing surface on Campus Field, as well as its surrounding track, in addition to renovations to William H. Pitt Center. Sacred Heart University invested $21.8 million in the construction of the Bobby Valentine Health and Recreation Center, a 57,400-square foot, three-story, fitness facility for the whole student population, which includes an indoor track, a bowling center, an 18-bike spin center, a 45-foot climbing wall and exercise and weight-training rooms. The facility opened in August 2019.

In addition, the Pioneers won their NEC-best eighth Joan Martin Commissioner&#x27;s Cup for excellence in women&#x27;s athletics in 2015, and overall the Pioneers have captured 13 conference championships since he has taken the helm. Programs have garnered national acclaim in that time, with the football team finishing the 2014 season nationally ranked, and the fencing squad finishing 11th in the NCAA at the 2014 championship. In September 2016, Valentine was named the ECAC Division I Administrator of the Year. On June 8 2021, Valentine took a leave of absence from his position, with Judy Ann Riccio becoming the interim director. Three months later, Riccio was named the new athletics director.

*New Jersey Sports Writers Association &quot;Sports Humanitarian of the Year&quot; (2001)

==Beyond baseball==
Since 1980, Valentine has owned and operated Bobby V&#x27;s Restaurant &amp; Sports Bar, a sports bar that is located in his hometown of Stamford, with franchises slated to open in Norwalk, Connecticut, Arlington, Texas, and Middletown, Rhode Island.

In 2010, Valentine started the production company, &quot;Makuhari Media&quot;, with producing partner Andrew J. Muscato. The company produces sports themed documentaries.

In 2011, Mayor Michael Pavia named Valentine Director of Public Safety for the city of Stamford, Connecticut. Valentine was paid a token $10,000 salary for this position, which he pledged to donate to city charities. Valentine left the position 11 months later to manage the Red Sox.

In 2013, on the twelfth anniversary of the September 11 attacks, Valentine made comments that accused the New York Yankees of not contributing support to the New York community in the wake of the attacks. He was widely criticized for the inaccuracy of his comments, as many media sources documented several occasions on which the Yankees visited victims and workers after the attacks, and for the untimeliness of trying to take credit for helping. TBS had originally planned to feature Valentine as a studio analyst during its &quot;MLB on TBS&quot; coverage for the 2013 postseason, but reportedly declined to do so after the negative publicity his comments attracted.

On December 9, 2016, WEEI reported that, on the recommendation of New Jersey governor Chris Christie, Valentine was being considered by Donald Trump&#x27;s presidential transition team for appointment as the United States Ambassador to Japan.

==2021 Stamford mayoral election==
On May 7, 2021, Valentine announced he was running for mayor of Stamford, Connecticut, in the 2021 election. He ran as an unaffiliated candidate.

He was challenged by Democratic state representative Caroline Simmons in the Stamford mayoral election that took place on Tuesday November 2, 2021.

Valentine lost the election to Simmons by 1,505 votes. With her election, Simmons became the first woman mayor of Stamford by taking 52.5% of the vote. Valentine obtained 47.5% of the vote. After the election, Valentine alleged voter fraud, which was disputed by Stamford&#x27;s registrar of voters.

== Personal life ==
Valentine was married to Mary Branca, the daughter of former Brooklyn Dodgers pitcher Ralph Branca and together they have a son. They separated in 2011 and divorced in October 2021. He is currently in a relationship with a Japanese woman, Junko Ogino, whom he met in 1995 and became romantically involved with in 2007 while still married to Mary Branca.

<doc id="1105872" wikidata="Q992668" url="?curid=1105872" title="Michael Walker, Baron Walker of Aldringham">
<text>Field Marshal Michael John Dawson Walker, Baron Walker of Aldringham, (born 7 July 1944) is a retired British Army officer. Commissioned in 1966, he served in Cyprus, Northern Ireland, and in a variety of staff posts in the United Kingdom until 1984. After being given command of a battalion, he was mentioned in despatches for his service during a second tour of duty in Northern Ireland, this time in Derry, and subsequently served a tour on Gibraltar. He was promoted to brigadier, unusually having never held the rank of colonel, and took command of 20th Armoured Brigade in Germany before becoming I Corps chief of staff.

As a major general, Walker was appointed General Officer Commanding, Eastern District, before becoming Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff at the Ministry of Defence. He took command of NATO&#x27;s Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), which deployed to the Balkans in 1995, Walker becoming the first officer to command the land component of the NATO-led Implementation Force. For his service with the multi-national forces in the Balkans, he was awarded the American Legion of Merit. After relinquishing command of the ARRC, Walker spent three years as Commander in Chief, Land Command, before being appointed Chief of the General Staff—the professional head of the British Army—in 2000. In 2003, he was promoted to Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the professional head of all the British Armed Forces. While CDS, Walker attracted controversy during the modernisation of the armed forces, over allegations of prisoner abuse during the Iraq War, and over comments that the media coverage of Iraq may have endangered British troops.

Walker retired in 2006 and was subsequently appointed Governor of the Royal Hospital Chelsea, a post he held until 2011. In 2014, he was promoted to the rank of Field Marshal. He is married and has three children.

==Early and personal life==
Born in Salisbury in the British colony of Southern Rhodesia (modern-day Zimbabwe) to William Hampden Dawson Walker, who was a Senior Assistant Commissioner in the British South Africa Police until 1958, and Dorothy Helena Walker (née Shiach), Walker was educated both in Southern Rhodesia and in Yorkshire, first at Milton School, Bulawayo, and then at Woodhouse Grove School, West Yorkshire. He spent 18 months teaching in a Preparatory School before joining the British Army. Walker married Victoria (&quot;Tor&quot;, née Holme), in 1973 and the couple have three children—two sons and one daughter. He lists his interests as sailing, shooting, tennis, skiing and golf.

==Early military career==
After attending the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, Walker was commissioned into the Royal Anglian Regiment as a second lieutenant on 29 July 1966. He served as a platoon commander with the 1st Battalion and was promoted to lieutenant on 29 January 1968. In 1969 he was posted to Cyprus for a two-year tour, and served in Northern Ireland during The Troubles, before attending the Staff College, Camberley. He was promoted to captain on 29 July 1972.

After serving in a staff position at the Ministry of Defence (MoD), Walker was promoted to major at the end of 1976, and rejoined the 1st Battalion, to become a company commander, based in Tidworth, Wiltshire. In 1979, he took up another staff post at the MoD, after which he was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1982. Until 1985, he served as Military Assistant to the Chief of the General Staff. He was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in the 1985 New Year Honours.

In command of the 1st Battalion from 1985 to 1987, Walker served another tour in Northern Ireland, this time in Derry, and later a tour on Gibraltar. He was mentioned in despatches in 1987 &quot;in recognition of gallant and distinguished service&quot; in Northern Ireland. Unusually, Walker was promoted directly to brigadier at the end of 1987, without having held the rank of colonel. He took command of the 20th Armoured Brigade, based in Germany, from 1987 to 1989, before holding the post of chief of staff, I Corps between 1989 and 1991.

==High command==
Walker attained general officer status with promotion to acting major general in 1991, and took command of the North East District and 2nd Infantry Division. Having served in the Gulf War, he was promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire later in 1991. He was granted the substantive rank of major general on 2 December 1991, with seniority from 14 February 1991, going on to serve as General Officer Commanding of the Eastern District and then as Assistant Chief of the General Staff from 11 December 1992 to 3 October 1994.

On 8 December 1994, Walker was appointed commander of NATO&#x27;s Allied Rapid Reaction Corps, which had its headquarters in Rheindahlen, Germany, and was promoted to acting lieutenant general. He was granted the substantive rank of lieutenant general on 15 March 1995, and knighted in the 1995 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours when he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath. Under Walker&#x27;s command, the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps deployed to the Balkans in December 1995. There, he became the first commander of the land component of the NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR), until his return to the UK in November 1996.

His IFOR command in Bosnia was indirectly criticised by Richard Holbrooke for his refusal to use his &quot;authority&quot; to also perform nonmilitary implementation tasks, including arresting indicted war criminals:

He was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George at the end of 1996.

Succeeded as COMARRC by Sir Mike Jackson, Walker was promoted to acting general and appointed Commander in Chief, Land Command on 27 January 1997. He was granted the substantive rank of general on 2 April 1997. In recognition of his service with IFOR between 1995 and 1996, Walker was awarded the American Legion of Merit (Degree of Commander), and granted unrestricted permission to wear the decoration, in May 1997. In September 1997, he was appointed Aide-de-Camp General (ADC Gen) to Queen Elizabeth II, succeeding General Sir Michael Rose, until he in turn was succeeded by General Sir Richard Dannatt. He was promoted to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in the New Year Honours List at the end of 1999.

Having served just over three years as Commander-in-Chief, Walker was appointed Chief of the General Staff (CGS)—the professional head of the British Army—on 17 April 2000, taking over from General Sir Roger Wheeler. He remained CGS for three years, after which he was promoted to Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the professional head of all the British Armed Forces—on 2 May 2003, succeeding Admiral Sir Michael Boyce (later Lord Boyce). As CDS, Walker criticised some of the media coverage of British deployments in Iraq. In particular, he claimed that attacks on the Black Watch were &quot;enhanced&quot; due to news reports on their location. He went on to say that &quot;[as a result of the media coverage], there could well have been a response by those who wished us ill to go and meet us with something like a bomb&quot;. His comments were rejected by a spokesman for the National Union of Journalists, who retaliated &quot;When generals turn around and start blaming reporters for their own mistakes, it is a sign they aren&#x27;t doing their own jobs properly&quot;. However, the MoD explained that speculation in the press about the timing and movement of military units can put people in danger and editors were &quot;urged to consider the difficulties reports could cause to troops on the ground.&quot; Also in 2004, Walker, along with General Sir Mike Jackson, then Chief of the General Staff, attracted controversy over reforms of the armed forces, which included the amalgamation of several army regiments to form larger regiments, leading to the loss of historic names.

In an interview with the BBC in October 2005, Walker suggested that the army&#x27;s recruitment had been adversely affected by the Iraq War. He also commented on the war in Afghanistan, on which he said &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of work to be done, of which the military is only a very small part. Ten years, 15 years, long-term. This is not going to be solved in a short term&quot;. In the same month, he gave an interview for &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, in which he said that soldiers&#x27; morale had been damaged by the unpopularity of the war among the British public. Later in 2005, Walker was instrumental in drawing up new procedures for the treatment of British service personnel accused of abusing Iraqi prisoners, following claims that the army had abandoned those soldiers charged in connection with the prisoner abuses. In February 2006, Walker headed up a military delegation to Bulgaria to discuss military cooperation between the British and Bulgarian governments.

Walker gave evidence to the Iraq Inquiry on 1 February 2010, in which he spoke about funding for the invasion of Iraq and subsequent planning.

===Honorary roles===
Lord Walker has held a variety of honorary and ceremonial roles in different regiments. He was granted the honorary titles of Colonel Commandant and Deputy Colonel of Queen&#x27;s Division (of which the Royal Anglian Regiment is part) in April 1992 and Honorary Colonel, 3rd Battalion Duke of Wellington&#x27;s Regiment (West Riding) (Yorkshire Volunteers), in October 1993, which he relinquished on 30 June 1999. In 1994, he succeeded General Sir John Learmont as Colonel Commandant of the Army Air Corps and held the title until April 2004, when he was relieved by then Lieutenant General Sir Richard Dannatt (later General Lord Dannatt).

<doc id="1105880" wikidata="Q3257141" url="?curid=1105880" title="Livin' Thing">
<text>&quot;Livin&#x27; Thing&quot; is a song written by Jeff Lynne and performed by Electric Light Orchestra (ELO). It appears on ELO&#x27;s 1976 album &quot;A New World Record&quot; and was also released as a single. Patti Quatro sang uncredited vocals, particularly the &quot;higher and higher&quot; parts.

The original single had &quot;Fire On High&quot; on the flip side, a tune that became the band&#x27;s most popular instrumental piece. The UK version was released in a blue vinyl format.

==Background==
&quot;Livin&#x27; Thing&quot; makes prominent use of augmented chords. Lynne said about that: 

AllMusic&#x27;s writer Stewart Mason described the song structure: &quot;[it] opens with a mock-Spanish orchestral flourish before swinging into a more typical mid-tempo ELO rocker, driven by a battery of acoustic rhythm guitars on the verses and modulating upwards into a falsetto Jeff Lynne vocal on a chorus that’s powered by an even more prominent than usual contribution from the group&#x27;s string section&quot;, adding that it lacks &quot;that impossible-to-dislodge hook that typified Lynne&#x27;s most successful songs from this era, but it&#x27;s still a darn sight better than most of what was at the top of the charts in late 1976&quot;.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; critic Robert Hilburn called it an &quot;extremely catchy record that has all the vocal and instrumental hooks to keep you listening.&quot; &quot;Billboard&quot; said that it &quot;moves through a dark U.K. rock distillation into a soaring, ethereal chorale and a return to the minor-key mode. &quot;Cash Box&quot; said that &quot;a diabolical arrangement hits hard along with some ever ready harmonies which sew this record up into sure hit potential.&quot; &quot;Record World&quot; called it a &quot;Jeff Lynne masterwork&quot; and said that &quot;a savory rock sound makes it happen.&quot;

&quot;Ultimate Classic Rock&quot; critic Michael Gallucci rated it ELO&#x27;s 2nd best song, specifically praising the &quot;string-solo opening, soulful backing vocals, synth waves occasionally crashing into the chorus and a gigantic hook.&quot; &quot;Classic Rock History&quot; critic Brian Kachejian rated it as ELO&#x27;s 6th best song. &quot;Stereogum&quot; contributor Ryan Reed rated it as ELO&#x27;s 5th best song, saying that &quot;From the dramatic classical opening, incorporating pizzicato strings, to the extended chorus fade-out, this one’s pure pop pleasure.&quot;

In August 2006, &quot;Livin&#x27; Thing&quot; was named by the UK&#x27;s &quot;Q&quot; as the number 1 &quot;Guilty Pleasure&quot; single of all time – a list designed to celebrate &quot;uncool&quot; but excellent records, and which received considerable publicity.

==Charts==

===Year-end charts===


==Certifications==

==Jeff Lynne version==
Jeff Lynne re-recorded the song in his own home studio. It was released in a compilation album with other re-recorded ELO songs, under the ELO name.

==Covers==
In 2001, PFR covered the track on the album &quot;Lynne Me Your Ears – A Tribute to the Music of Jeff Lynne&quot;.

In 2004, The Beautiful South covered the track for their covers album &quot;Golddiggas, Headnodders and Pholk Songs&quot;. It reached number 24 on the UK charts and number 26 on the Irish charts.

==Uses in other media==
In 2017, &quot;Livin&#x27; Thing&quot; was featured in Telltale&#x27;s &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; game.

The 1997 feature film &quot;Boogie Nights&quot; includes the track for the final scene and end credits of the movie. Initially, Jeff Lynne refused to release the rights to the song, but changed his mind after viewing a screening of the film with director Paul Thomas Anderson and being impressed.

The song was featured in the film &quot;Cruella&quot;.

<doc id="1105881" wikidata="Q748756" url="?curid=1105881" title="2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup">
<text>The 2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup was the eighth edition of the Gold Cup, the soccer championship of North America, Central America and the Caribbean (CONCACAF). It was contested in the United States in July 2005. The United States emerged victorious in the final against an upstart Panama team led by tournament MVP Luis Tejada. After regulation and 30 minutes of extra time ended scoreless, the U.S. won 3–1 on penalties.

For this edition, the format was switched from four groups of three teams each to the three groups of four teams. As a result, there was one more group stage game for each team, and the likelihood of teams advancing on a coin toss was much less. The top two teams from each group and the two best third-place teams would advance to the quarterfinals.

As usual for the Gold Cup, several of the top teams fielded less than their top squads, including guest teams Colombia and South Africa. Mexico and the United States were missing at least half their usual starters, and a few top name players on smaller nations (Paulo Wanchope and Amado Guevara, among others) also declined to participate. During the tournament, matches in Miami&#x27;s Group A had to be postponed because of Hurricane Dennis.

This was the last edition of the tournament to have guest participants from other confederations until the 2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup.

<doc id="1105886" wikidata="Q628760" url="?curid=1105886" title="Selection (evolutionary algorithm)">
<text>Selection is a genetic operator in an evolutionary algorithm (EA). An EA is a metaheuristic inspired by biological evolution and aims to solve challenging problems at least approximately. Selection has a dual purpose: on the one hand, it can choose individual genomes from a population for subsequent breeding (e.g., using the crossover operator). In addition, selection mechanisms are also used to choose candidate solutions (individuals) for the next generation. The biological model is natural selection. 

Retaining the best individual(s) of one generation unchanged in the next generation is called &quot;elitism&quot; or &quot;elitist selection&quot;. It is a successful (slight) variant of the general process of constructing a new population.

The basis for selection is the quality of an individual, which is determined by the fitness function. In memetic algorithms, an extension of EA, selection also takes place in the selection of those offspring that are to be improved with the help of a meme (e.g. a heuristic).

A selection procedure for breeding used early on may be implemented as follows:
#The fitness values that have been computed (fitness function) are normalized, such that the sum of all resulting fitness values equals 1.
#Accumulated normalized fitness values are computed: the accumulated fitness value of an individual is the sum of its own fitness value plus the fitness values of all the previous individuals; the accumulated fitness of the last individual should be 1, otherwise something went wrong in the normalization step.
#A random number &quot;R&quot; between 0 and 1 is chosen.
#The selected individual is the first one whose accumulated normalized value is greater than or equal to &quot;R&quot;.

For many problems the above algorithm might be computationally demanding. A simpler and faster alternative uses the so-called stochastic acceptance.

If this procedure is repeated until there are enough selected individuals, this selection method is called fitness proportionate selection or &quot;roulette-wheel selection&quot;. If instead of a single pointer spun multiple times, there are multiple, equally spaced pointers on a wheel that is spun once, it is called stochastic universal sampling.
Repeatedly selecting the best individual of a randomly chosen subset is tournament selection. Taking the best half, third or another proportion of the individuals is truncation selection.

There are other selection algorithms that do not consider all individuals for selection, but only those with a fitness value that is higher than a given (arbitrary) constant. Other algorithms select from a restricted pool where only a certain percentage of the individuals are allowed, based on fitness value.

== Methods of selection==
The listed methods differ mainly in the selection pressure, which can be set by a strategy parameter in the rank selection described below. The higher the selection pressure, the faster a population converges against a certain solution and the search space may not be explored sufficiently. This premature convergence can be counteracted by structuring the population appropriately. There is a close correlation between the population model used and a suitable selection pressure. If the pressure is too low, it must be expected that the population will not converge even after a long computing time. For more selection methods and further detail see.

=== Roulette wheel selection ===
In the roulette wheel selection, the probability of choosing an individual for breeding of the next generation is proportional to its fitness, the better the fitness is, the higher chance for that individual to be chosen.
Choosing individuals can be depicted as spinning a roulette that has as many pockets as there are individuals in the current generation, with sizes depending on their probability.
Probability of choosing individual formula_1 is equal to formula_2, where formula_3 is the fitness of formula_1 and formula_5 is the size of current generation (note that in this method one individual can be drawn multiple times).

====Stochastic universal sampling====
Stochastic universal sampling is a development of roulette wheel selection with minimal spread and no bias.

=== Rank selection ===
In rank selection, the probability for selection does not depend directly on the fitness, but on the fitness rank of an individual within the population. The exact fitness values themselves do not have to be available, but only a sorting of the individuals according to quality.
In addition to the adjustable selection pressure, an advantage of rank-based selection can be seen in the fact that it also gives worse individuals a chance to reproduce and thus to improve. This can be particularly helpful in applications with restrictions, since it facilitates the overcoming of a restriction in several intermediate steps, i.e. via a sequence of several individuals rated poorly due to restriction violations.

==== Linear rank selection ====
Linear ranking, which goes back to Baker, is often used. It allows the selection pressure to be set by the parameter formula_6, which can take values between 1.0 (no selection pressure) and 2.0 (high selection pressure). The probability formula_7 for formula_8 rank positions formula_9 is obtained as follows:
:formula_10

Another definition for the probability formula_11 for rank positions formula_1 is:
:formula_13

==== Exponential rank selection ====
Exponential rank selection is defined as follows: 

formula_14

=== Steady state selection ===
In every generation few chromosomes are selected (good - with high fitness) for creating a new offspring. Then some (bad - with low fitness) chromosomes are removed and the new offspring is placed in their place. The rest of population survives to new generation.

=== Tournament selection ===
Tournament selection is a method of choosing the individual from the set of individuals. The winner of each tournament is selected to perform crossover.

=== Truncation selection ===
For truncation selection, individuals are sorted according to their fitness and a portion (10% to 50%) of the top individuals is selected for next generation.

=== Elitist selection ===
Often to get better results, strategies with partial reproduction are used. One of them is elitism, in which a small portion of the best individuals from the last generation is carried over (without any changes) to the next one.

=== Boltzmann selection ===
In Boltzmann selection, a continuously varying temperature controls the rate of selection according to a preset schedule. The temperature starts out high, which means that the selection pressure is low. The temperature is gradually lowered, which gradually increases the selection pressure, thereby allowing the GA to narrow in more closely to the best part of the search space while maintaining the appropriate degree of diversity.

<doc id="1105887" wikidata="Q1063607" url="?curid=1105887" title="Taurus KEPD 350">
<text>The Taurus KEPD-350 is a German-Swedish air-launched cruise missile, manufactured by Taurus Systems and used by Germany, Spain, and South Korea. Taurus Systems GmbH is a partnership between MBDA Deutschland GmbH (formerly LFK) and Saab Bofors Dynamics.

==History==
During the Cold War Germany wanted to buy French Apache missiles, which did not work out. In 1998, Germany funded the development of a powered system to be designated KEPD-350 with the acronym TAURUS (Target Adaptive Unitary and dispensor Robotic Ubiquity System).

=== Taurus leak ===

In February 2024, there was a discussion among Luftwaffe officers as to how the system could be delivered to Ukraine to target the Crimean Bridge. Four officers prepared a briefing for Chancellor Olaf Scholz on the topic at an online meeting. The conversation was conducted via webex. A Russian intelligence service, media suspect the GRU, is reported to have intercepted the conversation and published it on the state controlled channel RT-Deutsch. An English translation of the transcript of the conversation was later posted online, though like various news reports it contains a number of errors.

The leak was followed by a public debate about countering Russian espionage in Germany. MAD started investigations.

==Overview==
The missile incorporates stealth technology and has an official range in excess of . It is powered by a turbofan engine. It can operate at Mach 0.95 and can be carried by Panavia PA-200 Tornado IDS, Eurofighter Typhoon EF-2000, Saab JAS-39C Gripen, McDonnell Douglas EF-18A+ Hornet, and McDonnell Douglas F-15K Slam Eagle aircraft.

The dual stage warhead, called MEPHISTO (multi-effect penetrator highly sophisticated and target optimised), features a precharge and initial penetrating charge to clear soil or enter &quot;hard and deeply buried targets&quot; (HDBT) such as hardened underground bunkers, then a variable delay fuze to control detonation of the main warhead. The missile weighs about and has a maximum body diameter of . Intended targets are hardened bunkers; command, control, and communications facilities; airfield and port facilities; ammunition storage facilities; ships in port or at sea; area target attack; and bridges.

== Operation ==
Mission planners program the missile with the target, air defence locations and planned ground path. The missile uses a terrain-hugging flight path, guided by inertial navigation system (INS), image based navigation (IBN), terrain referenced navigation (TRN), and Global Positioning System (GPS) to the target. It is capable of navigating over long distances without GPS support. 

Upon arrival the missile commences a bunt (climb) manoeuvre to achieve the best probability of target acquisition and penetration. During the cruise portion of the flight, a high resolution thermographic camera (infrared homing) can support navigation by using IBN and for GPS-free target attack. The missile attempts to match a camera image with the planned 3D target model (Digital Scene Matching Area Correlator, DSMAC). If it cannot, it defaults to the other navigation systems, or, to avoid collateral damage, it steers to a pre-designated crash point instead of risking an inaccurate attack.

== Export ==
Spain&#x27;s military bought 45 missiles. Integration of the missile in Spanish Air Force service was certified by completing a dedicated test campaign in South Africa in May 2009.

In 2013 South Korea planned to order 200 missiles to integrate with their F-15K Slam Eagles after it was prevented from acquiring Lockheed Martin&#x27;s AGM-158 JASSM by the United States. The Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) signed the deal in November 2013. The KEPD 350 was the first European missile to be integrated onto a South Korean fighter. In October 2016, South Korea announced it would acquire a further 90 missiles, in addition to the 170 previously ordered, in response to North Korean nuclear and missile provocations. On 12 December 2016, the first 40 Taurus KEPD 350K missiles were delivered to the ROKAF.

In May 2023, the German Federal Ministry of Defence said that Ukraine had requested the missile during the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. In interviews in June and July 2023, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Minister of Defense Boris Pistorius said that Germany would not supply Ukraine with long-range missiles. In January 2024, the German Bundestag voted against the supply of the Taurus missile to Ukraine. In February 2024, the German Bundestag and Chancellor Olaf Scholz again expressly refused Ukraine&#x27;s request while agreeing to deliver longer range weapons.

==Variants==

===KEPD 350K===
The variant for the ROKAF differs from the baseline model by being equipped with a Rockwell Collins GPS receiver with a Selective Availability Anti-Spoofing Module (SAASM) to prevent jamming.

===KEPD 350K-2===
In October 2015, Taurus Systems revealed it was developing a smaller version of the Taurus missile, called the 350K-2, for use on light fighters, particularly the South Korean FA-50 Block 20 variant of the KAI T-50 Golden Eagle. It is shorter at in length and lighter, weighing while matching speed and range.

In December 2016, South Korea&#x27;s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) announced plans to start development on a long-range air-to-ground missile in 2018, based on Taurus. The weapon was to be mounted on the KAI KF-21 Boramae fighter, to be developed by the mid-2020s.

===Taurus Neo===

On 27 October 2024, Boris Pistorius (German Defence Minister) announced a next generation Taurus missile called the Taurus Neo. With plans to purchase 600 units costing some €2.1 billion with deliveries starting in 2029. The Taurus Neo will include a range over 500 kms, a more powerful warhead and better guidance. 300 million euros would be required in 2025 to start the program.

==Operators==
===Current operators===
; : 600 ordered for the Luftwaffe&#x27;s Panavia PA-200 Tornado IDS and Eurofighter Typhoon EF-2000 at a cost of €570 million. Deliveries ended in December 2010.
; : 43 ordered for the Spanish Air Force&#x27;s McDonnell Douglas EF-18A+ Hornets and Eurofighter Typhoon EF-2000. Deliveries ended in August 2010. The program cost €60m.
; : 177 ordered in 2013, delivered in 2016–2017, 90 ordered in 2018, delivered in 2019–2020, and to be operated from the Republic of Korea Air Force&#x27;s McDonnell Douglas F-15K Slam Eagle fighter jets.

===Future operators===

; : On the 24th of February 2025 it was announced that the Swedish Air Force were equipping the multirole JAS 39 Gripen with Taurus. This missile is planned to be operational with the Swedish Airforce by 2028.

<text>Malchus (; , ) was the servant of the Jewish High Priest Caiaphas who participated in the arrest of Jesus as written in the four gospels. According to the Bible, one of the disciples, Simon Peter, being armed with a sword, cut off the servant&#x27;s ear in an attempt to prevent the arrest of Jesus.

==Biblical accounts==

That a disciple cut off the ear of a servant of the high priest is related in all four canonical gospels, in , , , and , but Simon Peter and Malchus are named only in the Gospel of John. Also, Luke is the only gospel that says Jesus healed the servant. This was Jesus&#x27; last recorded miracle prior to his resurrection.

The relevant passages in the Gospels of John and Luke, KJV, read:


James F. McGrath suggests that this account reflects an event that did happen, in that early Christians would hardly have invented a story portraying themselves as violent.

Later in Chapter 18, John records that a relative of Malchus witnessed Peter&#x27;s assault in the Garden of Gethsemane, and identified Peter as a follower of Christ. Peter denied this.

4th century church father Jerome cites a post-resurrection appearance of Jesus to Malchus, quoting a passage from the lost &quot;gospel according to the Hebrews.&quot; &quot;And when the Lord had given the linen cloth to the servant of the priest, he went to James and appeared to him.&quot;

==Literature and arts==

Thornton Wilder wrote a short play entitled, &quot;The Servant&#x27;s Name Was Malchus&quot;; it appears in the collection &quot;The Angel That Troubled the Waters and Other Plays&quot;.

&quot;The Fire Gospel&quot;, a 2008 novel by Michel Faber, centers on the discovery of the fictional lost gospel of Malchus.

Malchus is portrayed by Paul Brightwell in the 2013 TV miniseries &quot;The Bible&quot;.

In the 2004 Mel Gibson film &quot;The Passion of the Christ&quot;, Malchus is represented as an armed member of the temple guard. In this depiction, Jesus heals Malchus&#x27; wounded ear, leaving the latter to stay behind sitting dumbfounded in a state of disbelief, suggesting a possible conversion to Christianity.

Isak Dinesen in &quot;The Deluge at Norderney&quot; (the first of &quot;Seven Gothic Tales&quot;) relates a story about Simon Peter wherein he uses the memory of cutting off Malchus&#x27; ear &quot;to control his temper&quot;.

&quot;Touch&quot; by John Ferguson portrays Malchus as a Roman soldier sent by Pilate to spy on the Sanhedrin. Malchus is then sent by Caiaphas to spy on Jesus and his followers.

==History==
Thoothukudi is also known by the name &#x27;Pearl City&#x27;. It is also called the &quot;Sea Gateway of Tamil Nadu.&quot; Thoothukudi is part of the Pearl Fishery Coast and is known for its pearl fishing and shipbuilding industries.

The ancient town of Korkai, near present-day Thoothukudi, has been a center for maritime trade and pearl fishing for more than 2000 years. Ptolemy&#x27;s geography refers to Korkai as a center of pearl fishing while describing commercial relations between western India and Alexandria, the chief eastern emporium of the Roman Empire. The &quot;Periplus&quot; says that the Pandyan Empire extended from Comari towards the north, including Korkai, where the pearl fisheries were. Eventually, the Vijayanagara Empire took over Thoothukudi. Conducted trade with the Portuguese. The Empire split into Nayak kingdoms, which were overthrown by the Nawab of Arcot. The Nawab eventually ceded the land to the British in 1801.

The Portuguese established ports in Thoothukudi during the 16th century, and the Dutch occupied these ports in the 17th century as evidenced by Pagoda coins. During the 18th century the British overpowered and occupied the town. Being a port town, the town received attention from the rulers for improving their trade, and so it was brought to Municipal status in 1866. Rao Bahadur Cruz Fernandez and J. L. P. Roche Victoria as the chairmen of municipal corporation made significant contributions, laying the foundations for a modern Thoothukudi.

On 20 October 1986, a new district, carved out of the erstwhile Tirunelveli district was born in Tamil Nadu and named after V. O. Chidambaranar, a prominent national leader hailing from Ottapidaram who led the Swadeshi Movement in the south. Since 1997, the district has been named after its headquarters town, Thoothukudi.

Thoothukudi became the citadel of freedom struggles in the early of the 20th century.

===History of the ports===
The major harbour of Thoothukudi is well known as a pearl diving and fishing centre. It is one of the oldest seaports in the world and was the seaport of the Pandyan kingdom after Korkai, near Palayakayal. It was later taken over by the Portuguese in 1548, captured by the Dutch in 1658, and ceded to the British in 1825. The lighthouse built in 1842 marked the beginning of the history of harbour development in the city. Thoothukudi was established as a Municipality in 1866 with J.M.B. Roche Victoria as its first chairman.

It attained the status of corporation on 5 August 2008, after 142 years of being a municipality. Thoothukudi Corporation is divided into 60 wards after its expansion in 2011, and these wards comprise four zones—i.e., East, West, North, and South. East zone has 14–16 and 19–33 wards; West zone has 34–47 wards; North zone has 1–13 and 17, 18 wards; and South zone has 48–60 wards.

The minor port of the Thoothukudi anchorage port with lighter-age facilities has had flourishing traffic for over a century. The first wooden jetty at this port was commissioned in 1864. This port was used for the export of salt, cotton yarn, senna leaves, palmyrah stalks, palmyrah fibers, dry fish, country drugs, and other goods to neighboring countries and for the import of coal, cotton, copra, pulses, and grains.

<text>The Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation () are an Ojibwa (or Anishinaabeg) people located on Georgina Island in Lake Simcoe, Ontario, Canada. In 2008, of the First Nation&#x27;s registered population of 666 people, 181 lived on, and 485 lived outside, their reserve. As of 2020, the band has a total population of 923 members. They are one of a handful of First Nations in the Toronto Census Metropolitan Area.

==Geography==

The First Nation has three reserves: the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation Indian Reserve, the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation 33A Indian Reserve and the shared Chippewa Island Indian Reserve.

The main reserve consists of a small parcel of land near Virginia Beach and three islands on the southern shores of Lake Simcoe:

* Georgina Island
* Snake Island
* Fox Island

The Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation 33A reserve is a parcel of land separated from the mainland portion of the Chippewas of Georgina Island First Nation reserve by Black River Road and the private properties along it.

The Chippewa Island reserve is a reserve consisting of two islands near the Moose Deer Point First Nation in Twelve Mile Bay of Georgian Bay. It is shared with the Chippewas of Rama First Nation and the Beausoleil First Nation.

==Government==

The reserve government consists of a five-member band council with four councillors and a Chief.

Fire and emergencies services consists of a single fire truck and ambulance. The department is staffed by two full time firefighters (one is the chief) and volunteer responders.

Policing is provided by Georgina Island Police Service with assistance from the Ontario Provincial Police. The force has three officers, and replaced the community officers from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (primarily from Orillia Detachment and secondary from Toronto) in 1978. GIPS are part of the First Nations Police Service.

==Transportation==

Access to Georgina Island is by boat to and from the mainland. A marina is located on the southern tip of the island for the ferry and smaller vessels. Built in 1999, the ferry Aazhaawe can carry 18 cars and 50 passengers. Ferry service is seasonal and not provided when Lake Simcoe is frozen over. Fan boats provide access to Georgina (Fox and Snake) during the winter. Georgina Water Taxi&#x27;s Ahneen provides alternate travel to Georgina Island.

There are a few paved roads on Georgina Island (nine in total) with residents using personal vehicles. There are only unpaved roads on Snake Island and no roads on Fox Island. Primary means of transport to Fox and Snake Islands is by vessels docking on private docks around the islands.

Roads are maintained by the band. There is no airport or heliport on any of the islands.

==Economy==

The main employers on the reserve beyond the band are geared to tourism on the island. The island has a driving range, bed and breakfast and marina facilities.

==Education==

Primary education (from kindergarten to Grade 6) is found at a single school, Waabgon Gamig, on Georgina Island. York Region District School Board (YRDSB) provides staffing and assistance. Students from Grades 6 to 12 are required to attend schools on the mainland with YRDSB.

==Health==

Basic health services are provided at the Georgina Island Health Building by local staff and medical staff visiting from York Region.

<text>David Tibet (born David Michael Bunting; 5 March 1960) is an English poet, artist and musician. He is best known for the musical group Current 93, which he founded and is the only consistent member of, along with his contributions to the band Death in June.

==Biography==
David Bunting was born to British parents in Batu Gajah, Perak, Malaysia. His father had fought in World War II and was among the soldiers who liberated the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp. He lived in Malaysia until 1970, when he was sent to England to attend the (at the time all-boys) Red House School, an experience he has spoken poorly of. He attended Newcastle University.

He was given the name &quot;Tibet&quot; by Genesis P-Orridge while working with Psychic TV in the early &#x27;80s. In January 2005 he announced that he would revert to the name David Michael, although he continues to use the well-known &quot;Tibet&quot; in his public career to date.

Around 2000, he suffered a near-fatal case of appendicitis.

In 2009, he completed a MA degree in Coptic Language and Grammar through Macquarie University.

David was married to the musician and artist Andria Degens, known as &quot;Pantaleimon&quot;, who contributed to Current 93 albums between 1996 and 2009. They divorced around 2010. He lives in Hastings with his partner Ania Goszczyńska, an illustrator.

The Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections at the Cornell University Library holds his archives through 2013.

=== Beliefs and influences ===
Tibet was first exposed to Hinduism, Buddhism, and Taoism in Malaysia. He also showed an interest in esoteric Christianity from an early age, and still identifies as a Christian. 

Tibet&#x27;s mysticism is derived from such varied fields as religion, philosophy, witchcraft, poetry and painting. As his stage name suggests, he has Vajrayana Buddhist leanings, and regards the legendary tantric figure Padmasambhava as his own tutor. His album &quot;Buddhist Monks of the Maitri Vihar Monastery&quot; (1997) reflects his interest in Tibetan Buddhism. He also has longstanding interests in Christian mysticism and esoteric Christianity, especially Christian eschatology, and his lyrical subject matter reflects a consistent preoccupation with such apocalyptic imagery as death, loss, and destruction. Other influences include Gnosticism, Austin Osman Spare, and a variety of occult topics.

His interest in Aleister Crowley and Thelema began at age 11 when he purchased &quot;The Diary of a Drug Fiend&quot; at Sultan Abdul Aziz Shah Airport in Kuala Lumpur. Thelemic concepts appear aspects of the covers, lyrics and themes of Current 93 (including the group&#x27;s name itself). The initial recording of Current 93, LAShTAL, was, according to Tibet, &quot;the invocation of &quot;Malkunofath&quot; on the Nightside of Eden, the reverse of the Tree of Life&quot;. Despite his continuing appreciation for Crowley as an individual, Tibet has since distanced himself from Crowleyanity. In April 2006, Ordo Templi Orientis formed the International OTO Cabinet, an advisory, non-voting panel made up of both OTO Initiates and Non-Initiates. Tibet was named among the initial non-member appointments. 

Although collaborators such as Douglas P. and Boyd Rice have alleged neo-Nazi connections, Tibet himself has referred to Hitler as the antichrist and dedicated the Current 93 song &quot;Hitler as Kalki&quot; to &quot;my father who fought Hitler&quot;.

==Music==

After leaving university, he worked with Psychic TV and 23 Skidoo. He is credited on the Psychic TV albums &quot;Force the Hand of Chance&quot; and &quot;Dreams Less Sweet&quot;. Tibet left Psychic TV in 1983 and founded Current 93, of which he is the only constant member. Current 93&#x27;s initial recordings consisted largely of harsh, repetitive industrial noise and dark ambient soundscapes. Under the influence of Death in June, Tibet began incorporating neo-folk elements that would come to dominate Current 93&#x27;s music.

Tibet has had a reciprocal relationship with other musicians and groups. Steven Stapleton of Nurse With Wound appeared on nearly every Current 93 release until 2010, while Tibet has appeared on many Nurse With Wound releases and collaborations with Stapleton. Death in June members Douglas P. and Tony Wakeford appeared on Current 93 releases from 1987 until 1993, while Tibet was a member of Death in June from the mid-&#x27;80s to 1995. Many other mutual collaborators, such as Jhonn Balance of Coil, were also part of the community surrounding Psychic TV.

== Visual arts ==
Tibet is an established visual artist with much of his work in well-known galleries such as the Henry Boxer Gallery and Isis Gallery. His exhibitions include:

* Isis Gallery, London (2008)
* Den Frie Centre Of Contemporary Art, Copenhagen (2009)
* &quot;Magog at the Maypole (Sex of Stars)&quot;, White Columns, NYC (2012)
* &quot;Invocation of Almost&quot;, California State University, Fullerton (2019) 

==Publishing==
Tibet has created a series of record labels and small publishing houses under the names Maldoror (referring to &quot;Les Chants de Maldoror&quot;), Durtro (from the Tibetan word for charnel ground), Jnana Records, Coptic Cat, The Spheres, Ghost Story Press, and Cashen&#x27;s Gap (named for the home of Gef). These businesses publish and release his own work, as well as the work of artists he has collaborated with or has an interest in. The first album by Antony And The Johnsons was released by Durtro. Together with Mark Logan, he curated the 2006 five-CD compilation &quot;Not Alone&quot; to raise funds for Médecins Sans Frontières.

Tibet&#x27;s &#x27;The Moons At Your Door,&#x27; an anthology of &#x27;strange tales that influenced&#x27; Tibet illustrated by his own artwork, was released in Paperback Edition in March 2016. He also was the editor of a follow-up anthology of supernatural short stories, titled &quot;There is a Graveyard that Dwells in Man&quot; published in 2020.

Noseworthy was born in Lewisporte, Newfoundland and grew up working on fishing boats and getting his education when he could. As a teenager he worked as a lumberman before obtaining his teaching certificate at the age of 18. In 1910, he entered Albert College in Belleville, Ontario and paid his tuition by working with Frontier College going into the bush and teaching lumberjacks how to read and continued working for Frontier College when he attended Victoria College in Toronto.

Finishing his education at the age of 30, he sold insurance for a year before joining North Toronto Collegiate Institute as a history teacher. After seven years, he moved to Vaughan Road Collegiate Institute in the suburb of York, Toronto becoming head of the English department. Noseworthy became the President of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers&#x27; Federation in 1938 serving a one year term.

==Politics==
He joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), and was its candidate in the riding of York South in the 1940 federal election where he was defeated.
He stood again for the CCF when a by-election was called after the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) resigned in order to allow the new Conservative leader, former Prime Minister Arthur Meighen, to win a seat in the House of Commons of Canada. It was tradition for the Liberals and Conservatives not to run against the other party&#x27;s leader in by-elections, but the CCF did not accept this convention. William Lyon Mackenzie King and the Liberals were determined to block Meighen&#x27;s return to politics: King didn&#x27;t want the vocally pro-Conscription Meighen back in Parliament (see Conscription Crisis of 1944). The two men also had an intense rivalry dating from the 1920s when Meighen had previously been Tory leader. The Liberals donated money to Noseworthy&#x27;s campaign, and encouraged their members to support his candidacy. Conversely, the Ontario Liberal Party and Premier of Ontario, Mitchell Hepburn, was opposed to King&#x27;s conscription stance, and decided to put their support behind Meighen in the by-election.

The result on February 9, 1942, was a major upset and breakthrough for the CCF, with Noseworthy being elected by a margin of 5,000 votes. The defeat forced Meighen out of public life. Noseworthy was defeated in the subsequent 1945 general election by Alan Cockeram who had held the riding prior to the 1942 by-election, but returned as York South&#x27;s MP in the 1949 election and remained in Parliament until his death.

Noseworthy was an active parliamentarian and defended the rights of immigrants and minorities. At one point, he embarrassed the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Walter Harris, by tabling a letter Harris had written that made it clear that the government intended to use provisions of the new 1952 &quot;Immigration Act&quot; to exclude non-whites.

<text>A spark-gap transmitter is an obsolete type of radio transmitter which generates radio waves by means of an electric spark. Spark-gap transmitters were the first type of radio transmitter, and were the main type used during the wireless telegraphy or &quot;spark&quot; era, the first three decades of radio, from 1887 to the end of World War I. German physicist Heinrich Hertz built the first experimental spark-gap transmitters in 1887, with which he proved the existence of radio waves and studied their properties.

A fundamental limitation of spark-gap transmitters is that they generate a series of brief transient pulses of radio waves called damped waves; they are unable to produce the continuous waves used to carry audio (sound) in modern AM or FM radio transmission. So spark-gap transmitters could not transmit audio, and instead transmitted information by radiotelegraphy; the operator switched the transmitter on and off with a telegraph key, creating pulses of radio waves to spell out text messages in Morse code.

The first practical spark gap transmitters and receivers for radiotelegraphy communication were developed by Guglielmo Marconi around 1896. One of the first uses for spark-gap transmitters was on ships, to communicate with shore and broadcast a distress call if the ship was sinking. They played a crucial role in maritime rescues such as the 1912 RMS &quot;Titanic&quot; disaster. After World War I, vacuum tube transmitters were developed, which were less expensive and produced continuous waves which had a greater range, produced less interference, and could also carry audio, making spark transmitters obsolete by 1920. The radio signals produced by spark-gap transmitters are electrically &quot;noisy&quot;; they have a wide bandwidth, creating radio frequency interference (RFI) that can disrupt other radio transmissions. This type of radio emission has been prohibited by international law since 1934.

==Theory of operation==
Electromagnetic waves are radiated by electric charges when they are accelerated. Radio waves, electromagnetic waves of radio frequency, can be generated by time-varying electric currents, consisting of electrons flowing through a conductor which suddenly change their velocity, thus accelerating. 

An electrically charged capacitance discharged through an electric spark across a spark gap between two conductors was the first device known which could generate radio waves. The spark itself doesn&#x27;t produce the radio waves, it merely serves as a fast acting switch to excite resonant radio frequency oscillating electric currents in the conductors of the attached circuit. The conductors radiate the energy in this oscillating current as radio waves. 

Due to the inherent inductance of circuit conductors, the discharge of a capacitor through a low enough resistance (such as a spark) is oscillatory; the charge flows rapidly back and forth through the spark gap for a brief period, charging the conductors on each side alternately positive and negative, until the oscillations die away.

A practical spark gap transmitter consists of these parts:
*A high-voltage transformer, to transform the low-voltage electricity from the power source, a battery or electric outlet, to a high enough voltage (from a few kilovolts to 75-100 kilovolts in powerful transmitters) to jump across the spark gap. The transformer charges the capacitor. In low-power transmitters powered by batteries this was usually an induction coil (Ruhmkorff coil).
*One or more resonant circuits (tuned circuits or tank circuits) which create radio frequency electrical oscillations when excited by the spark. A resonant circuit consists of a capacitor (in early days a type called a Leyden jar) which stores high-voltage electricity from the transformer, and a coil of wire called an inductor or tuning coil, connected together. The values of the capacitance and inductance determine the frequency of the radio waves produced.
**The earliest spark-gap transmitters before 1897 did not have a resonant circuit; the antenna performed this function, acting as a resonator. However, this meant that the electromagnetic energy produced by the transmitter was dissipated across a wide band, thereby limiting its effective range to a few kilometers at most.
**Most spark transmitters had two resonant circuits coupled together with an air core transformer called a &quot;resonant transformer&quot; or &quot;oscillation transformer&quot;. This was called an &quot;inductively-coupled&quot; transmitter. The spark gap and capacitor connected to the primary winding of the transformer made one resonant circuit, which generated the oscillating current. The oscillating current in the primary winding created an oscillating magnetic field that induced current in the secondary winding. The antenna and ground were connected to the secondary winding. The capacitance of the antenna resonated with the secondary winding to make a second resonant circuit. The two resonant circuits were tuned to the same resonant frequency. The advantage of this circuit was that the oscillating current persisted in the antenna circuit even after the spark stopped, creating long, ringing, lightly damped waves, in which the energy was concentrated in a narrower bandwidth, creating less interference to other transmitters.
*A spark gap which acts as a voltage-controlled switch in the resonant circuit, discharging the capacitor through the coil.
*An antenna, a metal conductor such as an elevated wire, that radiates the power in the oscillating electric currents from the resonant circuit into space as radio waves.
*A telegraph key to switch the transmitter on and off to communicate messages by Morse code

===Operation cycle===
The transmitter works in a rapid repeating cycle in which the capacitor is charged to a high voltage by the transformer and discharged through the coil by a spark across the spark gap. The impulsive spark excites the resonant circuit to &quot;ring&quot; like a bell, producing a brief oscillating current which is radiated as electromagnetic waves by the antenna. The transmitter repeats this cycle at a rapid rate, so the spark appeared continuous, and the radio signal sounded like a whine or buzz in a radio receiver.
#The cycle begins when current from the transformer charges up the capacitor, storing positive electric charge on one of its plates and negative charge on the other. While the capacitor is charging the spark gap is in its nonconductive state, preventing the charge from escaping through the coil.
#When the voltage on the capacitor reaches the breakdown voltage of the spark gap, the air in the gap ionizes, starting an electric spark, reducing its resistance to a very low level (usually less than one ohm). This closes the circuit between the capacitor and the coil.
#The charge on the capacitor discharges as a current through the coil and spark gap. Due to the inductance of the coil when the capacitor voltage reaches zero the current doesn&#x27;t stop but keeps flowing, charging the capacitor plates with an opposite polarity, until the charge is stored in the capacitor again, on the opposite plates. Then the process repeats, with the charge flowing in the opposite direction through the coil. This continues, resulting in oscillating currents flowing rapidly back and forth between the plates of the capacitor through the coil and spark gap.
#The resonant circuit is connected to the antenna, so these oscillating currents also flow in the antenna, charging and discharging it. The current creates an oscillating magnetic field around the antenna, while the voltage creates an oscillating electric field. These oscillating fields radiate away from the antenna into space as an electromagnetic wave; a radio wave.
#The energy in the resonant circuit is limited to the amount of energy originally stored in the capacitor. The radiated radio waves, along with the heat generated by the spark, uses up this energy, causing the oscillations to decrease quickly in amplitude to zero. When the oscillating electric current in the primary circuit has decreased to a point where it is insufficient to keep the air in the spark gap ionized, the spark stops, opening the resonant circuit, and stopping the oscillations. In a transmitter with two resonant circuits, the oscillations in the secondary circuit and antenna may continue some time after the spark has terminated. Then the transformer begins charging the capacitor again, and the whole cycle repeats.

The cycle is very rapid, taking less than a millisecond. With each spark, this cycle produces a radio signal consisting of an oscillating sinusoidal wave that increases rapidly to a high amplitude and decreases exponentially to zero, called a damped wave. The frequency formula_1 of the oscillations, which is the frequency of the emitted radio waves, is equal to the resonant frequency of the resonant circuit, determined by the capacitance formula_2 of the capacitor and the inductance formula_3 of the coil:
:formula_4
The transmitter repeats this cycle rapidly, so the output is a repeating string of damped waves. This is equivalent to a radio signal amplitude modulated with a steady frequency, so it could be demodulated in a radio receiver by a rectifying AM detector, such as the crystal detector or Fleming valve used during the wireless telegraphy era. The frequency of repetition (spark rate) is in the audio range, typically 50 to 1000 sparks per second, so in a receiver&#x27;s earphones the signal sounds like a steady tone, whine, or buzz.

In order to transmit information with this signal, the operator turns the transmitter on and off rapidly by tapping on a switch called a telegraph key in the primary circuit of the transformer, producing sequences of short (dot) and long (dash) strings of damped waves, to spell out messages in Morse code. As long as the key is pressed the spark gap fires repetitively, creating a string of pulses of radio waves, so in a receiver the keypress sounds like a buzz; the entire Morse code message sounds like a sequence of buzzes separated by pauses. In low-power transmitters the key directly breaks the primary circuit of the supply transformer, while in high-power transmitters the key operates a heavy duty relay that breaks the primary circuit.

===Charging circuit and spark rate===
The circuit which charges the capacitors, along with the spark gap itself, determines the &quot;spark rate&quot; of the transmitter, the number of sparks and resulting damped wave pulses it produces per second, which determines the tone of the signal heard in the receiver. The spark rate should not be confused with the &quot;frequency&quot; of the transmitter, which is the number of sinusoidal oscillations per second in each damped wave. Since the transmitter produces one pulse of radio waves per spark, the output power of the transmitter was proportional to the spark rate, so higher rates were favored. Spark transmitters generally used one of three types of power circuits:

====Induction coil====
An induction coil (Ruhmkorff coil) was used in low-power transmitters, usually less than 500 watts, often battery-powered. An induction coil is a type of transformer powered by DC, in which a vibrating arm switch contact on the coil called an interrupter repeatedly breaks the circuit that provides current to the primary winding, causing the coil to generate pulses of high voltage. When the primary current to the coil is turned on, the primary winding creates a magnetic field in the iron core which pulls the springy interrupter arm away from its contact, opening the switch and cutting off the primary current. Then the magnetic field collapses, creating a pulse of high voltage in the secondary winding, and the interrupter arm springs back to close the contact again, and the cycle repeats. Each pulse of high voltage charged up the capacitor until the spark gap fired, resulting in one spark per pulse. Interrupters were limited to low spark rates of 20–100 Hz, sounding like a low buzz in the receiver. In powerful induction coil transmitters, instead of a vibrating interrupter, a mercury turbine interrupter was used. This could break the current at rates up to several thousand hertz, and the rate could be adjusted to produce the best tone.

====AC transformer====
In higher power transmitters powered by AC, a transformer steps the input voltage up to the high voltage needed. The sinusoidal voltage from the transformer is applied directly to the capacitor, so the voltage on the capacitor varies from a high positive voltage, to zero, to a high negative voltage. The spark gap is adjusted so sparks only occur near the maximum voltage, at peaks of the AC sine wave, when the capacitor was fully charged. Since the AC sine wave has two peaks per cycle, ideally two sparks occurred during each cycle, so the spark rate was equal to twice the frequency of the AC power (often multiple sparks occurred during the peak of each half cycle). The spark rate of transmitters powered by 50 or 60 Hz mains power was thus 100 or 120 Hz. However higher audio frequencies cut through interference better, so in many transmitters the transformer was powered by a motor–alternator set, an electric motor with its shaft turning an alternator, that produced AC at a higher frequency, usually 500 Hz, resulting in a spark rate of 1000 Hz.

====Quenched spark gap====
The speed at which signals may be transmitted is naturally limited by the time taken for the spark to be extinguished. If, as described above, the conductive plasma does not, during the zero points of the alternating current, cool enough to extinguish the spark, a &#x27;persistent spark&#x27; is maintained until the stored energy is dissipated, permitting practical operation only up to around 60 signals per second. If active measures are taken to break the arc (either by blowing air through the spark or by lengthening the spark gap), a much shorter &quot;quenched spark&quot; may be obtained. A simple quenched spark system still permits several oscillations of the capacitor circuit in the time taken for the spark to be quenched. With the spark circuit broken, the transmission frequency is solely determined by the antenna resonant circuit, which permits simpler tuning.

====Rotary spark gap====
In a transmitter with a &quot;rotary&quot; spark gap &quot;(below)&quot;, the capacitor was charged by AC from a high-voltage transformer as above, and discharged by a spark gap consisting of electrodes spaced around a wheel which was spun by an electric motor, which produced sparks as they passed by a stationary electrode. The spark rate was equal to the rotations per second times the number of spark electrodes on the wheel. It could produce spark rates up to several thousand hertz, and the rate could be adjusted by changing the speed of the motor. The rotation of the wheel was usually synchronized to the AC sine wave so the moving electrode passed by the stationary one at the peak of the sine wave, initiating the spark when the capacitor was fully charged, which produced a musical tone in the receiver. When tuned correctly in this manner, the need for external cooling or quenching airflow was eliminated, as was the loss of power directly from the charging circuit (parallel to the capacitor) through the spark.

==History==

The invention of the radio transmitter resulted from the convergence of two lines of research.

One was efforts by inventors to devise a system to transmit telegraph signals without wires. Experiments by a number of inventors had shown that electrical disturbances could be transmitted short distances through the air. However most of these systems worked not by radio waves but by electrostatic induction or electromagnetic induction, which had too short a range to be practical. In 1866 Mahlon Loomis claimed to have transmitted an electrical signal through the atmosphere between two 600 foot wires held aloft by kites on mountaintops 14 miles apart. Thomas Edison had come close to discovering radio in 1875; he had generated and detected radio waves which he called &quot;etheric currents&quot; experimenting with high-voltage spark circuits, but due to lack of time did not pursue the matter. David Edward Hughes in 1879 had also stumbled on radio wave transmission which he received with his carbon microphone detector, however he was persuaded that what he observed was induction. Neither of these individuals are usually credited with the discovery of radio, because they did not understand the significance of their observations and did not publish their work before Hertz.

The other was research by physicists to confirm the theory of electromagnetism proposed in 1864 by Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell, now called Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Maxwell&#x27;s theory predicted that a combination of oscillating electric and magnetic fields could travel through space as an &quot;electromagnetic wave&quot;. Maxwell proposed that light consisted of electromagnetic waves of short wavelength, but no one knew how to confirm this, or generate or detect electromagnetic waves of other wavelengths. By 1883 it was theorized that accelerated electric charges could produce electromagnetic waves, and George Fitzgerald had calculated the output power of a loop antenna. Fitzgerald in a brief note published in 1883 suggested that electromagnetic waves could be generated practically by discharging a capacitor rapidly; the method used in spark transmitters, however there is no indication that this inspired other inventors.

The division of the history of spark transmitters into the different types below follows the organization of the subject used in many wireless textbooks.

===Hertzian oscillators===
German physicist Heinrich Hertz in 1887 built the first experimental spark gap transmitters during his historic experiments to demonstrate the existence of electromagnetic waves predicted by James Clerk Maxwell in 1864, in which he discovered radio waves,
 which were called &quot;Hertzian waves&quot; until about 1910. Hertz was inspired to try spark excited circuits by experiments with &quot;Reiss spirals&quot;, a pair of flat spiral inductors with their conductors ending in spark gaps. A Leyden jar capacitor discharged through one spiral, would cause sparks in the gap of the other spiral.


See circuit diagram. Hertz&#x27;s transmitters consisted of a dipole antenna made of a pair of collinear metal rods of various lengths with a spark gap &quot;(S)&quot; between their inner ends and metal balls or plates for capacitance &quot;(C)&quot; attached to the outer ends. The two sides of the antenna were connected to an induction coil (Ruhmkorff coil) &quot;(T)&quot; a common lab power source which produced pulses of high voltage, 5 to 30 kV. In addition to radiating the waves, the antenna also acted as a harmonic oscillator (resonator) which generated the oscillating currents. High-voltage pulses from the induction coil &quot;(T)&quot; were applied between the two sides of the antenna. Each pulse stored electric charge in the capacitance of the antenna, which was immediately discharged by a spark across the spark gap. The spark excited brief oscillating standing waves of current between the sides of the antenna. The antenna radiated the energy as a momentary pulse of radio waves; a damped wave. The frequency of the waves was equal to the resonant frequency of the antenna, which was determined by its length; it acted as a half-wave dipole, which radiated waves roughly twice the length of the antenna (for example a dipole 1 meter long would generate 150 MHz radio waves). Hertz detected the waves by observing tiny sparks in micrometer spark gaps &quot;(M)&quot; in loops of wire which functioned as resonant receiving antennas. Oliver Lodge was also experimenting with spark oscillators at this time and came close to discovering radio waves before Hertz, but his focus was on waves on wires, not in free space.

Hertz and the first generation of physicists who built these &quot;Hertzian oscillators&quot;, such as Jagadish Chandra Bose, Lord Rayleigh, George Fitzgerald, Frederick Trouton, Augusto Righi and Oliver Lodge, were mainly interested in radio waves as a scientific phenomenon, and largely failed to foresee its possibilities as a communication technology. Due to the influence of Maxwell&#x27;s theory, their thinking was dominated by the similarity between radio waves and light waves; they thought of radio waves as an invisible form of light. By analogy with light, they assumed that radio waves only traveled in straight lines, so they thought radio transmission was limited by the visual horizon like existing optical signalling methods such as semaphore, and therefore was not capable of longer distance communication. As late as 1894 Oliver Lodge speculated that the maximum distance Hertzian waves could be transmitted was a half mile.

To investigate the similarity between radio waves and light waves, these researchers concentrated on producing short wavelength high-frequency waves with which they could duplicate classic optics experiments with radio waves, using quasioptical components such as prisms and lenses made of paraffin wax, sulfur, and pitch and wire diffraction gratings. Their short antennas generated radio waves in the VHF, UHF, or microwave bands. In his various experiments, Hertz produced waves with frequencies from 50 to 450 MHz, roughly the frequencies used today by broadcast television transmitters. Hertz used them to perform historic experiments demonstrating standing waves, refraction, diffraction, polarization and interference of radio waves. He also measured the speed of radio waves, showing they traveled at the same speed as light. These experiments established that light and radio waves were both forms of Maxwell&#x27;s electromagnetic waves, differing only in frequency. Augusto Righi and Jagadish Chandra Bose around 1894 generated microwaves of 12 and 60 GHz respectively, using small metal balls as resonator-antennas.

The high frequencies produced by Hertzian oscillators could not travel beyond the horizon. The dipole resonators also had low capacitance and couldn&#x27;t store much charge, limiting their power output. Therefore, these devices were not capable of long distance transmission; their reception range with the primitive receivers employed was typically limited to roughly 100 yards (100 meters).
===Non-syntonic transmitters===

Italian radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi was one of the first people to believe that radio waves could be used for long distance communication, and singlehandedly developed the first practical radiotelegraphy transmitters and receivers, mainly by combining and tinkering with the inventions of others. Starting at age 21 on his family&#x27;s estate in Italy, between 1894 and 1901 he conducted a long series of experiments to increase the transmission range of Hertz&#x27;s spark oscillators and receivers.
He was unable to communicate beyond a half-mile until 1895, when he discovered that the range of transmission could be increased greatly by replacing one side of the Hertzian dipole antenna in his transmitter and receiver with a connection to Earth and the other side with a long wire antenna suspended high above the ground. These antennas functioned as quarter-wave monopole antennas. The length of the antenna determined the wavelength of the waves produced and thus their frequency. Longer, lower frequency waves have less attenuation with distance. As Marconi tried longer antennas, which radiated lower frequency waves, probably in the MF band around 2 MHz, he found that he could transmit further. Another advantage was that these vertical antennas radiated vertically polarized waves, instead of the horizontally polarized waves produced by Hertz&#x27;s horizontal antennas. These longer vertically polarized waves could travel beyond the horizon, because they propagated as a ground wave that followed the contour of the Earth. Under certain conditions they could also reach beyond the horizon by reflecting off layers of charged particles (ions) in the upper atmosphere, later called skywave propagation. Marconi did not understand any of this at the time; he simply found empirically that the higher his vertical antenna was suspended, the further it would transmit.

After failing to interest the Italian government, in 1896 Marconi moved to England, where William Preece of the British General Post Office funded his experiments. Marconi applied for a patent on his radio system 2 June 1896, often considered the first wireless patent. In May 1897 he transmitted 14 km (8.7 miles), on 27 March 1899 he transmitted across the English Channel, 46 km (28 miles), in fall 1899 he extended the range to 136 km (85 miles), and by January 1901 he had reached 315 km (196 miles). These demonstrations of wireless Morse code communication at increasingly long distances convinced the world that radio, or &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot; as it was called, was not just a scientific curiosity but a commercially useful communication technology.

In 1897 Marconi started a company to produce his radio systems, which became the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. and radio communication began to be used commercially around 1900. His first large contract in 1901 was with the insurance firm Lloyd&#x27;s of London to equip their ships with wireless stations. Marconi&#x27;s company dominated marine radio throughout the spark era. Inspired by Marconi, in the late 1890s other researchers also began developing competing spark radio communication systems; Alexander Popov in Russia, Eugène Ducretet in France, Reginald Fessenden and Lee de Forest in America, and Karl Ferdinand Braun, Adolf Slaby, and Georg von Arco in Germany who in 1903 formed the Telefunken Co., Marconi&#x27;s chief rival.

====Disadvantages====
The primitive transmitters prior to 1897 had no resonant circuits (also called LC circuits, tank circuits, or tuned circuits), the spark gap was in the antenna, which functioned as the resonator to determine the frequency of the radio waves. These were called &quot;unsyntonized&quot; or &quot;plain antenna&quot; transmitters.

The average power output of these transmitters was low, because due to its low capacitance the antenna was a highly damped oscillator (in modern terminology, it had very low Q factor). During each spark the energy stored in the antenna was quickly radiated away as radio waves, so the oscillations decayed to zero quickly. The radio signal consisted of brief pulses of radio waves, repeating tens or at most a few hundreds of times per second, separated by comparatively long intervals of no output. The power radiated was dependent on how much electric charge could be stored in the antenna before each spark, which was proportional to the capacitance of the antenna. To increase their capacitance to ground, antennas were made with multiple parallel wires, often with capacitive toploads, in the &quot;harp&quot;, &quot;cage&quot;, &quot;umbrella&quot;, &quot;inverted-L&quot;, and &quot;T&quot; antennas characteristic of the &quot;spark&quot; era. The only other way to increase the energy stored in the antenna was to charge it up to very high voltages. However the voltage that could be used was limited to about 100 kV by corona discharge which caused charge to leak off the antenna, particularly in wet weather, and also energy lost as heat in the longer spark.
A more significant drawback of the large damping was that the radio transmissions were electrically &quot;noisy&quot;; they had a very large bandwidth. These transmitters did not produce waves of a single frequency, but a continuous band of frequencies. They were essentially radio noise sources radiating energy over a large part of the radio spectrum, which made it impossible for other transmitters to be heard. When multiple transmitters attempted to operate in the same area, their broad signals overlapped in frequency and interfered with each other. The radio receivers used also had no resonant circuits, so they had no way of selecting one signal from others besides the broad resonance of the antenna, and responded to the transmissions of all transmitters in the vicinity. An example of this interference problem was an embarrassing public debacle in August 1901 when Marconi, Lee de Forest, and G. W. Pickard attempted to report the New York Yacht Race to newspapers from ships with their untuned spark transmitters. The Morse code transmissions interfered, and the reporters on shore failed to receive any information from the garbled signals.
===Syntonic transmitters===
It became clear that for multiple transmitters to operate, some system of &quot;selective signaling&quot; had to be devised to allow a receiver to select which transmitter&#x27;s signal to receive, and reject the others. In 1892 William Crookes had given an influential lecture on radio in which he suggested using resonance (then called &quot;syntony&quot;) to reduce the bandwidth of transmitters and receivers. Using a resonant circuit (also called tuned circuit or tank circuit) in transmitters would narrow the bandwidth of the radiated signal, it would occupy a smaller range of frequencies around its center frequency, so that the signals of transmitters &quot;tuned&quot; to transmit on different frequencies would no longer overlap. A receiver which had its own resonant circuit could receive a particular transmitter by &quot;tuning&quot; its resonant frequency to the frequency of the desired transmitter, analogously to the way one musical instrument could be tuned to resonance with another. This is the system used in all modern radio.

During the period 1897 to 1900 wireless researchers realized the advantages of &quot;syntonic&quot; or &quot;tuned&quot; systems, and added capacitors (Leyden jars) and inductors (coils of wire) to transmitters and receivers, to make resonant circuits (tuned circuits, or tank circuits). Oliver Lodge, who had been researching electrical resonance for years, patented the first &quot;syntonic&quot; transmitter and receiver in May 1897
 Lodge added an inductor (coil) between the sides of his dipole antennas, which resonated with the capacitance of the antenna to make a tuned circuit. Although his complicated circuit did not see much practical use, Lodge&#x27;s &quot;syntonic&quot; patent was important because it was the first to propose a radio transmitter and receiver containing resonant circuits which were tuned to resonance with each other. In 1911 when the patent was renewed the Marconi Company was forced to buy it to protect its own syntonic system against infringement suits.

The resonant circuit functioned analogously to a tuning fork, storing oscillating electrical energy, increasing the Q factor of the circuit so the oscillations were less damped. Another advantage was the frequency of the transmitter was no longer determined by the length of the antenna but by the resonant circuit, so it could easily be changed by adjustable taps on the coil. The antenna was brought into resonance with the tuned circuit using loading coils. The energy in each spark, and thus the power output, was no longer limited by the capacitance of the antenna but by the size of the capacitor in the resonant circuit. In order to increase the power very large capacitor banks were used. The form that the resonant circuit took in practical transmitters was the inductively-coupled circuit described in the next section.

====Inductive coupling====
In developing these syntonic transmitters, researchers found it impossible to achieve low damping with a single resonant circuit. A resonant circuit can only have low damping (high Q, narrow bandwidth) if it is a &quot;closed&quot; circuit, with no energy dissipating components. But such a circuit does not produce radio waves. A resonant circuit with an antenna radiating radio waves (an &quot;open&quot; tuned circuit) loses energy quickly, giving it high damping (low Q, wide bandwidth). There was a fundamental tradeoff between a circuit which produced persistent oscillations which had narrow bandwidth, and one which radiated high power.

The solution found by a number of researchers was to use two resonant circuits in the transmitter, with their coils inductively (magnetically) coupled, making a resonant transformer (called an &quot;oscillation transformer&quot;); this was called an &quot;&quot;inductively coupled&quot;, &quot;coupled circuit&quot;&quot; or &quot;two circuit&quot; transmitter. See circuit diagram. The primary winding of the oscillation transformer (&quot;L1&quot;) with the capacitor (&quot;C1&quot;) and spark gap (&quot;S&quot;) formed a &quot;closed&quot; resonant circuit which generated the oscillations, while the secondary winding (&quot;L2&quot;) was connected to the wire antenna (&quot;A&quot;) and ground, forming an &quot;open&quot; resonant circuit with the capacitance of the antenna (&quot;C2&quot;). Both circuits were tuned to the same resonant frequency. The advantage of the inductively coupled circuit was that the &quot;loosely coupled&quot; transformer transferred the oscillating energy of the tank circuit to the radiating antenna circuit gradually, creating long &quot;ringing&quot; waves. A second advantage was that it allowed a large primary capacitance &quot;(C1)&quot; to be used which could store a lot of energy, increasing the power output enormously. Powerful transoceanic transmitters often had huge Leyden jar capacitor banks filling rooms &quot;(see pictures above)&quot;. The receiver in most systems also used two inductively coupled circuits, with the antenna an &quot;open&quot; resonant circuit coupled through an oscillation transformer to a &quot;closed&quot; resonant circuit containing the detector. A radio system with a &quot;two circuit&quot; (inductively coupled) transmitter and receiver was called a &quot;four circuit&quot; system.

The first person to use resonant circuits in a radio application was Nikola Tesla, who invented the resonant transformer in 1891. At a March 1893 St. Louis lecture he had demonstrated a wireless system that, although it was intended for wireless power transmission, had many of the elements of later radio communication systems. A grounded capacitance-loaded spark-excited resonant transformer (his &quot;Tesla coil&quot;) attached to an elevated wire monopole antenna transmitted radio waves, which were received across the room by a similar wire antenna attached to a receiver consisting of a second grounded resonant transformer tuned to the transmitter&#x27;s frequency, which lighted a Geissler tube. This system, patented by Tesla 2 September 1897, 4 months after Lodge&#x27;s &quot;syntonic&quot; patent, was in effect an inductively coupled radio transmitter and receiver, the first use of the &quot;four circuit&quot; system claimed by Marconi in his 1900 patent &quot;(below)&quot;. However, Tesla was mainly interested in wireless power and never developed a practical radio &quot;communication&quot; system.

In addition to Tesla&#x27;s system, inductively coupled radio systems were patented by Oliver Lodge in February 1898, Karl Ferdinand Braun, in November 1899, and John Stone Stone in February 1900. Braun made the crucial discovery that low damping required &quot;loose coupling&quot; (reduced mutual inductance) between the primary and secondary coils.

Marconi at first paid little attention to syntony, but by 1900 developed a radio system incorporating features from these systems, with a two circuit transmitter and two circuit receiver, with all four circuits tuned to the same frequency, using a resonant transformer he called the &quot;jigger&quot;. In spite of the above prior patents, Marconi in his 26 April 1900 &quot;four circuit&quot; or &quot;master tuning&quot; patent on his system claimed rights to the inductively coupled transmitter and receiver. This was granted a British patent, but the US patent office twice rejected his patent as lacking originality. Then in a 1904 appeal a new patent commissioner reversed the decision and granted the patent, on the narrow grounds that Marconi&#x27;s patent by including an antenna loading coil &quot;(J in circuit above)&quot; provided the means for tuning the four circuits to the same frequency, whereas in the Tesla and Stone patents this was done by adjusting the length of the antenna. This patent gave Marconi a near monopoly of syntonic wireless telegraphy in England and America. Tesla sued Marconi&#x27;s company for patent infringement but didn&#x27;t have the resources to pursue the action. In 1943 the US Supreme Court invalidated the inductive coupling claims of Marconi&#x27;s patent due to the prior patents of Lodge, Tesla, and Stone, but this came long after spark transmitters had become obsolete.

The inductively coupled or &quot;syntonic&quot; spark transmitter was the first type that could communicate at intercontinental distances, and also the first that had sufficiently narrow bandwidth that interference between transmitters was reduced to a tolerable level. It became the dominant type used during the &quot;spark&quot; era. A drawback of the plain inductively coupled transmitter was that unless the primary and secondary coils were very loosely coupled it radiated on two frequencies. This was remedied by the quenched-spark and rotary gap transmitters&quot; (below)&quot;.

In recognition of their achievements in radio, Marconi and Braun shared the 1909 Nobel Prize in physics.

===First transatlantic radio transmission===

Marconi decided in 1900 to attempt transatlantic communication, which would allow him to dominate Atlantic shipping and compete with submarine telegraph cables. This would require a major scale-up in power, a risky gamble for his company. Up to that time his small induction coil transmitters had an input power of 100 - 200 watts, and the maximum range achieved was around 150 miles. To build the first high power transmitter, Marconi hired an expert in electric power engineering, Prof. John Ambrose Fleming of University College, London, who applied power engineering principles. Fleming designed a complicated inductively-coupled transmitter &quot;(see circuit)&quot; with two cascaded spark gaps &quot;(S1, S2)&quot; firing at different rates, and three resonant circuits, powered by a 25 kW alternator &quot;(D)&quot; turned by a combustion engine. The first spark gap and resonant circuit &quot;(S1, C1, T2)&quot; generated the high voltage to charge the capacitor &quot;(C2)&quot; powering the second spark gap and resonant circuit &quot;(S2, C2, T3)&quot;, which generated the output. The spark rate was low, perhaps as low as 2 - 3 sparks per second. Fleming estimated the radiated power was around 10 - 12 kW.

The transmitter was built in secrecy on the coast at Poldhu, Cornwall, UK. Marconi was pressed for time because Nikola Tesla was building his own transatlantic radiotelegraphy transmitter on Long Island, New York, in a bid to be first (this was the Wardenclyffe Tower, which lost funding and was abandoned unfinished after Marconi&#x27;s success). Marconi&#x27;s original round 400-wire transmitting antenna collapsed in a storm 17 September 1901 and he hastily erected a temporary antenna consisting of 50 wires suspended in a fan shape from a cable between two 160 foot poles. The frequency used is not known precisely, as Marconi did not measure wavelength or frequency, but it was between 166 and 984 kHz, probably around 500 kHz. He received the signal on the coast of St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland using an untuned coherer receiver with a 400 ft. wire antenna suspended from a kite. Marconi announced the first transatlantic radio transmission took place on 12 December 1901, from Poldhu, Cornwall to Signal Hill, Newfoundland, a distance of 2100 miles (3400 km).

Marconi&#x27;s achievement received worldwide publicity, and was the final proof that radio was a practical communication technology. The scientific community at first doubted Marconi&#x27;s report. Virtually all wireless experts besides Marconi believed that radio waves traveled in straight lines, so no one (including Marconi) understood how the waves had managed to propagate around the 300 mile high curve of the Earth between Britain and Newfoundland. In 1902 Arthur Kennelly and Oliver Heaviside independently theorized that radio waves were reflected by a layer of ionized atoms in the upper atmosphere, enabling them to return to Earth beyond the horizon. In 1924 Edward V. Appleton demonstrated the existence of this layer, now called the &quot;Kennelly–Heaviside layer&quot; or &quot;E-layer&quot;, for which he received the 1947 Nobel Prize in Physics.

Knowledgeable sources today doubt whether Marconi actually received this transmission. Ionospheric conditions should not have allowed the signal to be received during the daytime at that range. Marconi knew the Morse code signal to be transmitted was the letter &#x27;S&#x27; (three dots). He and his assistant could have mistaken atmospheric radio noise (&quot;static&quot;) in their earphones for the clicks of the transmitter. Marconi made many subsequent transatlantic transmissions which clearly establish his priority, but reliable transatlantic communication was not achieved until 1907 with more powerful transmitters.

===Quenched-spark transmitters===

The inductively-coupled transmitter had a more complicated output waveform than the non-syntonic transmitter, due to the interaction of the two resonant circuits. The two magnetically coupled tuned circuits acted as a coupled oscillator, producing beats &quot;(see top graphs)&quot;. The oscillating radio frequency energy was passed rapidly back and forth between the primary and secondary resonant circuits as long as the spark continued. Each time the energy returned to the primary, some was lost as heat in the spark. In addition, unless the coupling was very loose the oscillations caused the transmitter to transmit on two separate frequencies. Since the narrow passband of the receiver&#x27;s resonant circuit could only be tuned to one of these frequencies, the power radiated at the other frequency was wasted.

This troublesome backflow of energy to the primary circuit could be prevented by extinguishing (quenching) the spark at the right instant, after all the energy from the capacitors was transferred to the antenna circuit. Inventors tried various methods to accomplish this, such as air blasts and Elihu Thomson&#x27;s magnetic blowout.

In 1906, a new type of spark gap was developed by German physicist Max Wien, called the &quot;series&quot; or &quot;quenched&quot; gap. A quenched gap consisted of a stack of wide cylindrical electrodes separated by thin insulating spacer rings to create many narrow spark gaps in series, of around . The wide surface area of the electrodes terminated the ionization in the gap quickly by cooling it after the current stopped. In the inductively coupled transmitter, the narrow gaps extinguished (&quot;quenched&quot;) the spark at the first nodal point (Q) when the primary current momentarily went to zero after all the energy had been transferred to the secondary winding &quot;(see lower graph)&quot;. Since without the spark no current could flow in the primary circuit, this effectively uncoupled the secondary from the primary circuit, allowing the secondary resonant circuit and antenna to oscillate completely free of the primary circuit after that (until the next spark). This produced output power centered on a single frequency instead of two frequencies. It also eliminated most of the energy loss in the spark, producing very lightly damped, long &quot;ringing&quot; waves, with decrements of only 0.08 to 0.25 (a Q of 12-38) and consequently a very &quot;pure&quot;, narrow bandwidth radio signal. Another advantage was the rapid quenching allowed the time between sparks to be reduced, allowing higher spark rates of around 1000 Hz to be used, which had a musical tone in the receiver which penetrated radio static better. The quenched gap transmitter was called the &quot;singing spark&quot; system.

The German wireless giant Telefunken Co., Marconi&#x27;s rival, acquired the patent rights and used the quenched spark gap in their transmitters.
===Rotary gap transmitters===
A second type of spark gap that had a similar quenching effect was the &quot;rotary gap&quot;, invented by Tesla in 1896 and applied to radio transmitters by Reginald Fessenden and others. It consisted of multiple electrodes equally spaced around a disk rotor spun at high speed by a motor, which created sparks as they passed by a stationary electrode. By using the correct motor speed, the rapidly separating electrodes extinguished the spark after the energy had been transferred to the secondary. The rotating wheel also kept the electrodes cooler, important in high-power transmitters.

There were two types of rotary spark transmitter:
*&quot;Nonsynchronous&quot;: In the earlier rotary gaps, the motor was not synchronized with the frequency of the AC transformer, so the spark occurred at random times in the AC cycle of the voltage applied to the capacitor. The problem with this was the interval between the sparks was not constant. The voltage on the capacitor when a moving electrode approached the stationary electrode varied randomly between zero and the peak AC voltage. The exact time when the spark started varied depending on the gap length the spark could jump, which depended on the voltage. The resulting random phase variation of successive damped waves resulted in a signal that had a &quot;hissing&quot; or &quot;rasping&quot; sound in the receiver.
*&quot;Synchronous&quot;: In this type, invented by Fessenden around 1904, the rotor was turned by a synchronous motor in synchronism with the cycles of the AC voltage to the transformer, so the spark occurred at the same points of the voltage sine wave each cycle. Usually it was designed so there was one spark each half cycle, adjusted so the spark occurred at the peak voltage when the capacitor was fully charged. Thus the spark had a steady frequency equal to a multiple of the AC line frequency, which created harmonics with the line frequency. The synchronous gap was said to produce a more musical, easily heard tone in the receiver, which cut through interference better.
To reduce interference caused by the &quot;noisy&quot; signals of the burgeoning numbers of spark transmitters, the 1912 US Congress &quot;Act to Regulate Radio Communication&quot; required that &quot;the logarithmic decrement per oscillation in the wave trains emitted by the transmitter shall not exceed two tenths&quot; (this is equivalent to a Q factor of 15 or greater). Virtually the only spark transmitters which could satisfy this condition were the quenched-spark and rotary gap types above, and they dominated wireless telegraphy for the rest of the spark era.
==== Marconi&#x27;s timed spark system ====
In 1912 in his high-power stations Marconi developed a refinement of the rotary discharger called the &quot;timed spark&quot; system, which generated what was probably the nearest to a continuous wave that sparks could produce. He used several identical resonant circuits in parallel, with the capacitors charged by a DC dynamo. These were discharged sequentially by multiple rotary discharger wheels on the same shaft to create overlapping damped waves shifted progressively in time, which were added together in the oscillation transformer so the output was a superposition of damped waves. The speed of the discharger wheel was controlled so that the time between sparks was equal to an integer multiple of the wave period. Therefore, oscillations of the successive wave trains were in phase and reinforced each other. The result was essentially a continuous sinusoidal wave, whose amplitude varied with a ripple at the spark rate. This system was necessary to give Marconi&#x27;s transoceanic stations a narrow enough bandwidth that they didn&#x27;t interfere with other transmitters on the narrow VLF band. Timed spark transmitters achieved the longest transmission range of any spark transmitters, but these behemoths represented the end of spark technology.

===The &quot;spark&quot; era===
The first application of radio was on ships, to keep in touch with shore, and send out a distress call if the ship were sinking. The Marconi Company built a string of shore stations and in 1904 established the first Morse code distress call, the letters &quot;CQD&quot;, used until the Second International Radiotelegraphic Convention in 1906 at which &quot;SOS&quot; was agreed on. The first significant marine rescue due to radiotelegraphy was the 23 January 1909 sinking of the luxury liner RMS &quot;Republic&quot;, in which 1500 people were saved.

Spark transmitters and the crystal receivers used to receive them were simple enough that they were widely built by hobbyists. During the first decades of the 20th century this exciting new high tech hobby attracted a growing community of &quot;radio amateurs&quot;, many of them teenage boys, who used their homebuilt sets recreationally to contact distant amateurs and chat with them by Morse code, and relay messages. Low-power amateur transmitters (&quot;squeak boxes&quot;) were often built with &quot;trembler&quot; ignition coils from early automobiles such as the Ford Model T. In the US prior to 1912 there was no government regulation of radio, and a chaotic &quot;wild west&quot; atmosphere prevailed, with stations transmitting without regard to other stations on their frequency, and deliberately interfering with each other. The expanding numbers of non-syntonic broadband spark transmitters created uncontrolled congestion in the airwaves, interfering with commercial and military wireless stations.

The sinking 14 April 1912 increased public appreciation for the role of radio, but the loss of life brought attention to the disorganized state of the new radio industry, and prompted regulation which corrected some abuses. Although the &quot;Titanic&quot; radio operator&#x27;s &quot;CQD&quot; distress calls summoned the which rescued 705 survivors, the rescue operation was delayed four hours because the nearest ship, the SS &quot;Californian&quot;, only a few miles away, did not hear the &quot;Titanic&quot;″s call as its radio operator had gone to bed. This was held responsible for most of the 1500 deaths. Existing international regulations required all ships with more than 50 passengers to carry wireless equipment, but after the disaster subsequent regulations mandated ships have enough radio officers so that a round-the-clock radio watch could be kept. US President Taft and the public heard reports of chaos on the air the night of the disaster, with amateur stations interfering with official naval messages and passing false information. In response Congress passed the 1912 Radio Act, in which licenses were required for all radio transmitters, maximum damping of transmitters was limited to a decrement of 0.2 to get old noisy non-syntonic transmitters off the air, and amateurs were mainly restricted to the unused frequencies above 1.5 MHz and output power of 1 kilowatt.

The largest spark transmitters were powerful transoceanic radiotelegraphy stations with input power of 100 - 300 kW. Beginning about 1910, industrial countries built global networks of these stations to exchange commercial and diplomatic telegram traffic with other countries and communicate with their overseas colonies. During World War I, radio became a strategic defensive technology, as it was realized a nation without long distance radiotelegraph stations could be isolated by an enemy cutting its submarine telegraph cables. Most of these networks were built by the two giant wireless corporations of the age: the British Marconi Company, which constructed the Imperial Wireless Chain to link the possessions of the British Empire, and the German Telefunken Co. which was dominant outside the British Empire. Marconi transmitters used the timed spark rotary discharger, while Telefunken transmitters used its quenched spark gap technology. Paper tape machines were used to transmit Morse code text at high speed. To achieve a maximum range of around 3000 – 6000 miles, transoceanic stations transmitted mainly in the very low frequency (VLF) band, from 50 kHz to as low as 15 – 20 kHz. At these wavelengths even the largest antennas were electrically short, a tiny fraction of a wavelength tall, and so had low radiation resistance (often below 1 ohm), so these transmitters required enormous wire umbrella and flattop antennas up to several miles long with large capacitive toploads, to achieve adequate efficiency. The antenna required a large loading coil at the base, 6 – 10 feet tall, to make it resonant with the transmitter.

===Continuous waves===
Although their damping had been reduced as much as possible, spark transmitters still produced damped waves, which due to their large bandwidth caused interference between transmitters. The spark also made a very loud noise when operating, produced corrosive ozone gas, eroded the spark electrodes, and could be a fire hazard. Despite its drawbacks, most wireless experts believed along with Marconi that the impulsive &quot;whipcrack&quot; of a spark was necessary to produce radio waves that would communicate long distances.

From the beginning, physicists knew that another type of waveform, continuous sinusoidal waves (CW), had theoretical advantages over damped waves for radio transmission. Because their energy is essentially concentrated at a single frequency, in addition to causing almost no interference to other transmitters on adjacent frequencies, continuous wave transmitters could transmit longer distances with a given output power. They could also be modulated with an audio signal to carry sound. The problem was no techniques were known for generating them. The efforts described above to reduce the damping of spark transmitters can be seen as attempts to make their output approach closer to the ideal of a continuous wave, but spark transmitters could not produce true continuous waves.

Beginning about 1904, continuous wave transmitters were developed using new principles, which competed with spark transmitters. Continuous waves were first generated by two short-lived technologies:
*The arc converter (Poulsen arc) transmitter, invented by Valdemar Poulsen in 1904 used the negative resistance of a continuous electric arc in a hydrogen atmosphere to excite oscillations in a resonant circuit.
*The Alexanderson alternator transmitter, developed between 1906 and 1915 by Reginald Fessenden and Ernst Alexanderson, was a huge rotating alternating current generator (alternator) driven by an electric motor at a high enough speed that it produced radio frequency current in the very low frequency range.
These transmitters, which could produce power outputs of up to one megawatt, slowly replaced the spark transmitter in high-power radiotelegraphy stations. However spark transmitters remained popular in two way communication stations because most continuous wave transmitters were not capable of a mode called &quot;break in&quot; or &quot;listen in&quot; operation. With a spark transmitter, when the telegraph key was up between Morse symbols the carrier wave was turned off and the receiver was turned on, so the operator could listen for an incoming message. This allowed the receiving station, or a third station, to interrupt or &quot;break in&quot; to an ongoing transmission. In contrast, these early CW transmitters had to operate continuously; the carrier wave was not turned off between Morse code symbols, words, or sentences but just detuned, so a local receiver could not operate as long as the transmitter was powered up. Therefore, these stations could not receive messages until the transmitter was turned off.

===Obsolescence===

All these early technologies were superseded by the vacuum tube feedback electronic oscillator, invented in 1912 by Edwin Armstrong and Alexander Meissner, which used the triode vacuum tube invented in 1906 by Lee de Forest. Vacuum tube oscillators were a far cheaper source of continuous waves, and could be easily modulated to carry sound. Due to the development of the first high-power transmitting tubes by the end of World War I, in the 1920s tube transmitters replaced the arc converter and alternator transmitters, as well as the last of the old noisy spark transmitters.

The 1927 International Radiotelegraph Convention in Washington, D.C. saw a political battle to finally eliminate spark radio. Spark transmitters were obsolete at this point, and broadcast radio audiences and aviation authorities were complaining of the disruption to radio reception that noisy legacy marine spark transmitters were causing. But shipping interests vigorously fought a blanket prohibition on damped waves, due to the capital expenditure that would be required to replace spark equipment that was still being used on older ships. The Convention prohibited licensing of new land spark transmitters after 1929. Damped wave radio emission, called Class B, was banned after 1934 except for emergency use on ships. This loophole allowed shipowners to avoid replacing spark transmitters, which were kept as emergency backup transmitters on ships through World War II.

===Legacy===
One legacy of spark-gap transmitters is that radio operators were regularly nicknamed &quot;Sparky&quot; long after the devices ceased to be used. Even today, the German verb &quot;funken&quot;, literally, &quot;to spark&quot;, also means &quot;to send a radio message&quot;.

The spark gap oscillator was also used in nonradio applications, continuing long after it became obsolete in radio. In the form of the Tesla coil and Oudin coil it was used until the 1940s in the medical field of diathermy for deep body heating. High oscillating voltages of hundreds of thousands of volts at frequencies of 0.1 - 1 MHz from a Tesla coil were applied directly to the patient&#x27;s body. The treatment was not painful, because currents in the radio frequency range do not cause the physiological reaction of electric shock. In 1926 William T. Bovie discovered that RF currents applied to a scalpel could cut and cauterize tissue in medical operations, and spark oscillators were used as electrosurgery generators or &quot;Bovies&quot; as late as the 1980s.

In the 1950s a Japanese toy company, Matsudaya, produced a line of cheap remote control toy trucks, boats and robots called Radicon, which used a low-power spark transmitter in the controller as an inexpensive way to produce the radio control signals. The signals were received in the toy by a coherer receiver.

Spark gap oscillators are still used to generate high-frequency high voltage needed to initiate welding arcs in gas tungsten arc welding. Powerful spark gap pulse generators are still used to simulate EMPs.

<text>Louis Golding (19 November 1895 – 9 August 1958) was an English writer, famous in his time especially for his novels, though he is now largely neglected; he wrote also short stories, essays, fantasies, travel books, and poetry.

==Life==
Born in Manchester, Lancashire into a Ukrainian-Jewish family, Golding was educated at Manchester Grammar School and Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. He used his Manchester background (as &#x27;Doomington&#x27;) and Jewish themes in his novels, the first of which was published while he was still an undergraduate (his student time was interrupted by service in World War I). Golding described Edgar Allan Poe and Alfred, Lord Tennyson as influences on his poetry.

His novel &quot;Magnolia Street&quot; was a bestseller of 1932; it is based on the Hightown area of Manchester, as it was in the 1920s. It features, authentically enough, a street divided into &#x27;gentile&#x27; and &#x27;Jewish&#x27; sides. It was a 1939 play for Charles B. Cochran in an adaptation by Golding and A. E. Rawlinson, and was also filmed as &quot;Magnolia Street Story&quot;. Magnolia Street was also dramatised by Allan Prior as a BBC Television series of the same name in 1961, which ran for 6 episodes.

Golding described his politics as &quot;strongly to the left&quot;. In 1932, the Hogarth Press published Golding&#x27;s &quot;A Letter to Adolf Hitler&quot;, an attack on anti-Semitism and Nazism. In 1940, Golding also criticized the Soviet Invasion of Finland.

Boucher and McComas named &quot;Honey for the Ghost&quot; the best supernatural novel of 1949, saying it &quot;begins with infinite leisure but builds to an incomparable climactic terror.&quot;

Film screenplays on which Golding collaborated included that of the Paul Robeson film &quot;The Proud Valley&quot; (1940); this work with Robeson may have led to his later visa problems with the U.S. authorities. He also was involved in the script of the 1944 film of his novel &quot;Mr. Emmanuel&quot;.

Golding employed Gillian Freeman as a literary secretary. Freeman later became a novelist and screenwriter, often using her time with Golding as inspiration for her work.

He died from carcinoma of the pancreas at St George&#x27;s Hospital, London, three weeks after an operation.

His first career was in the Colonial Service from 1933 to 1951; he survived imprisonment by the Japanese during the Second World War from 1942 to 1945, when he was stationed in Singapore, to later serve terms from 1949 to 1951, as British Resident in Brunei and then Resident Commissioner in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands colony (now Kiribati and Tuvalu) before retiring in 1952.

== Diplomatic career ==
Peel was the British Resident in Brunei from 1946 to 1948, upon the establishment of civilian authority following Second World War. Peel, who was always helpful to Brunei history students, was also a part of a British Parliamentary delegation visiting the Sultanate in 1959. While in Brunei, he made friends with Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin III (the father of Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah) who later invited old acquaintances to his own suite at the Dorchester; in 1969, he named Peel an honorary member of the Brunei aristocracy. Brunei was politically unstable during the residential era, with British administration in both internal and external affairs. In an August 1995 interview with Peel, he stated:

== Political career ==
Peel was elected as a member of the House of Commons at a by-election in 1957. In July 1959, he provoked angry responses from the House when he reacted to the Mau Mau rebellion in Kenya by stating: &quot;There are obvious risks in dealing with desperate and sub-human individuals.&quot; In the resulting debate, Peel&#x27;s remarks were denounced by Enoch Powell, who commented: &quot;We cannot, we dare not, in Africa of all places, fall below our highest standards in the acceptance of responsibility&quot;. Though Peel&#x27;s tenure of minor government positions was uninterrupted, he never reached the Cabinet.

Peel was a zealous advocate of British involvement in Europe, through the Council of Europe, the Western European Union, and eventually membership—of which he was a leading advocate—in the European Communities. In 1972, he was chosen President of the North Atlantic Assembly. In the following year he was knighted, and also became one of the first British members of the European Parliament.

== Death ==
Peel died on 8 May 2004, at the age of 91, in his London home. He was survived by his widow, three daughters (Joanna, Alethea, and Lynda), one son (Quentin), and numerous grandkids and great-grandchildren. The family funeral was scheduled for 18 May 2004, at Putney Crematorium. He died a wealthy man who left an estate worth £681,057 net. He was the last-surviving former British Resident of Brunei at the time of his death, though not the longest-lived; that honour went to his immediate successor, L. H. N. Davis, who died on 16 June 2003 at the age of 94.

== Personal life ==
Peel married Rosemary Mia Minka Redhead in 1936. His father Sir William Peel had been Governor of Hong Kong.

== Honours ==
In addition to being knighted in 1973, he had two Brunei datoships, the DSNB in 1971 and the DSLJ in 1969.

* Order of Setia Negara Brunei (DSNB; 27 November 1971) – &quot;Dato Setia&quot;
* Order of Paduka Seri Laila Jasa Second Class (DSLJ; 1969) – &quot;Dato Seri Laila Jasa&quot;

<text>Segorbe is a municipality in the mountainous coastal province of Castelló, autonomous community of Valencia, Spain. The former Palace of the Dukes of Medinaceli now houses the city&#x27;s mayor. Segorbe&#x27;s bull-running week (&quot;semana de Toros&quot;) in September attracts 200,000 visitors each year.

== Geography ==

The municipal district area is crossed by the Palancia River from north west to south east. It is located on the natural way from Aragón to Valencian Community, between the Serra d&#x27;Espadà on the north and Serra Calderona on the south.

The urban area is located at 358 m height, placed over two hills emerging from the bank of the river.

==History==

The area of Segorbe was inhabited as early as the mid-Palaeolithic Age, as testified by archaeological remains. Segorbe was once identified as the ancient &quot;Segobriga&quot;, described by Pliny the Elder as the capital of Celtiberia. However, archaeological excavations have uncovered an extensive Roman city in La Mancha which has been identified as Segobriga. During the Visigothic rule in Iberia, it became a diocese seat.

In the 8th century, Segorbe was occupied by Moors from North Africa and its cathedral became a mosque. Segorbe was the residence of Zayd Abu Zayd, the last Almohad governor of Valencia. After his conversion to Christianism, Segorbe became a base for the conquest of Valencia in 1238. In 1435 it became part of the royal estates of the Kingdom of Aragon.
==Main sights==
The Cathedral of Segorbe, consecrated in 1534 and extended in 1795 is connected by a bridge with the old episcopal palace. Its tower and its cloister are built on a trapezoidal ground-plan.

Segorbe&#x27;s ancient castle was perhaps located over an Iberian acropolis. It originated as a Moorish alcazar, and lived its period of highest splendor in the later 15th century; Martin of Aragon held his court here. After the administrative center was moved to the new ducal palace in the city, it declined, and, from the mid-18th century, its materials were used for the construction of the hospital and Casa de Misericordia.

Other sights include:
*Church of St. Martin, built in Baroque style in 1612
*Baroque church of &quot;San Joaquín y Santa Ana&quot; (1695)
*Medieval walls, dating to before the 13th century, including in their last stretch a 14th-century aqueduct. Its features include the Arch of Veronica, the Botxi Tower (with a height of 17.30 m) and the &quot;Cárcel&quot; Tower (14th century)
*Town Hall, begun in the 16th century.
*Cathedral Museum
*Archaeology and Ethnology Museum

Also had former sights, now demolished, in which include:
*Castle Alcázar of Segorbe

==Duchy of Segorbe==
The ducal line, in Valencia kingdom, whose members bear the family name of Aragó, was founded by the king Ferdinand I of Aragon who made his eldest son, Enric I, the first lord of Segorbe, duke of Villena, count of Empúries and count of Alburquerque. His son Enric II was created duke of Segorbe and was also count of Empúries, like his son Alfons I. The son of this last one, Francesc I, inherited from his father the duchy of Segorbe and county of Empúries, and from his mother (Joana of Cardona) the duchy of Cardona. He had no sons and the succession passed through his sister Joana, who was married to Diego Fernández de Córdoba, marquis of Comares. His son Lluis Folc de Cardona-Aragó was count of Prades, but he predeceased his mother in 1596 and the heir was the son (grandson of Joana) Enric III d&#x27;Aragó Folc de Cardona Córdoba. His son Lluis I succeeded him and deceased in 1670 and his son and successor Joaquin I also deceased in 1670. The heir was Pere Antoni, brother of Lluis I. After his death in 1690, the succession was claimed by Caterina, sister of Joaquin, married with Juan Francisco de la Cerda, duke of Medinaceli. The Medinaceli dukes received the duchy of Segorbe, the duchy of Cardona and the county of Empúries.

*Enric I 1436-1445

Dukes:
*Enric II 1455-1522
*Alfons I 1522-1563
*Francesc I 1563-1575

<doc id="1105915" wikidata="Q125207765" url="?curid=1105915" title="Al Key">
<text>Al Key (5 February 1905 – 17 July 1976) was an American aviator who broke a flight endurance record with his brother Fred in 1935.

After a distinguished career in the military, he served as the mayor of Meridian, Mississippi from 1965 to 1973.

==Early life and family==
Algene Earl Key was born on a farm in Kemper County, Mississippi on February 5, 1905. He was the eldest of three sons of Elmore Benjamin (1877-1951), a physician, and Mary Ola Love (Olivier) Key (1879-1970), a homemaker. In the 1920s, Al moved with his family to Meridian.

Al attended Hattiesburg Normal School (later the University of Southern Mississippi) and Mississippi A &amp; M College (later Mississippi State University).

==Career==
In 1926, Key began taking flying lessons at the Nicholas Beazley Flying School in Marshall, Missouri. After obtaining his pilot&#x27;s license, he sparked his brother Fred&#x27;s interest in flying. He and his brother Fred started their own flying school in Sedalia, Missouri.

Returning to Meridian in 1930, Al became the city&#x27;s first licensed pilot. He and Fred started a flying school based at the old Bonita Airport in Meridian.

In 1935, Al and Fred broke an aviation endurance record when they flew a single engine plane 653 hours and 34 minutes. It was their third attempt. In recognition of their achievement the Meridian airport was named Key Field in their honor.

Thirty years later, it was still the official endurance record. However, by that time at least two flights were claimed to be of longer duration.

==Military service==

In 1939, Key formed one of the first Air National Guard units in the United States. Immediately after America entered World War Two, it was also one of the first units called to active duty.

In the early days of the U.S. involvement in World War Two, Key served with distinction as a bomber pilot. One of his many honors was receiving the distinguished service cross in 1943 for flying his severely damaged plane during a raid in France, which was then under the control of Nazi Germany.

Key retired from the military in 1960. At the time of his retirement, he served as deputy commander of Headquarters Continental Airways and Air Communications Service Area located at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma.

==Mayor of Meridian==
Key served two terms as mayor of Meridian from 1965 to 1973.

==Death==
On Saturday, July 3, 1976, just one day before the Bicentennial, Key was involved in an automobile accident. He died two weeks later at Rush Foundation Hospital in Meridian as a result of his injuries.

<doc id="1105935" wikidata="Q1119208" url="?curid=1105935" title="Andregoto Galíndez">
<text>Andregoto Galíndez, of the County of Aragon, was the Queen of Pamplona by marriage to García Sánchez I, prior to being divorced by him before the year 940. She was the mother of Sancho II of Pamplona.

Andregoto was one of two daughters born to Galindo II Aznárez, Count of Aragon, by his second wife, Sancha Garcés of Pamplona, a half-sister of King Sancho I of Pamplona. Her father&#x27;s County of Aragon had been brought into the Kingdom of Pamplona under Sancho I, and following Galindo&#x27;s death in 922 was held by a Count Guntislo, apparently her illegitimate half-brother, Guntislo Galíndez. Her father&#x27;s other County of Sobrarbe went to Andregoto&#x27;s half-sister, Toda Galíndez, in her marriage to Count Bernard I of Ribagorza. Andregoto&#x27;s marriage to Sancho&#x27;s only son, then ruling Pamplona as García Sánchez I, likely occurred sometime in the mid-930s.

Prior to 940, García divorced Andregoto, presumably on the grounds of consanguinity since both were grandchildren of García Jiménez of Pamplona. Together they had a sole son, Sancho II of Pamplona, though she may also have been mother of García&#x27;s two daughters, whose maternity is unknown or disputed: Toda, who is mentioned in 991 as sister of King Sancho, and Urraca, who married firstly Fernán González of Castile, and secondly William II Sánchez of Gascony. 

In 971, she was ruling her own subkingdom, in the area of Lumbier.

It has been suggested that Andregoto remarried and had further children, although details of this have not been discovered. Endregota, wife of 11th-century nobleman Sancho Macerátiz and mother of his son Sancho Sánchez, calls Queen Andregoto &quot;avuncula&quot; (&#x27;maternal aunt&#x27;), probably indicating that Endregota descended from a sister of the queen. Ubierto Arteta suggested a descent from Andregoto&#x27;s full-sister, Velasquita Galíndez.

<text>Electrical wiring is an electrical installation of cabling and associated devices such as switches, distribution boards, sockets, and light fittings in a structure.

Wiring is subject to safety standards for design and installation. Allowable wire and cable types and sizes are specified according to the circuit operating voltage and electric current capability, with further restrictions on the environmental conditions, such as ambient temperature range, moisture levels, and exposure to sunlight and chemicals.

Associated circuit protection, control, and distribution devices within a building&#x27;s wiring system are subject to voltage, current, and functional specifications. Wiring safety codes vary by locality, country, or region. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) is attempting to harmonise wiring standards among member countries, but significant variations in design and installation requirements still exist.

==Wiring methods==
Materials for wiring interior electrical systems in buildings vary depending on:
* Intended use and amount of power demand on the circuit
* Type of occupancy and size of the building
* National and local regulations
* Environment in which the wiring must operate.

Wiring systems in a single family home or duplex, for example, are simple, with relatively low power requirements, infrequent changes to the building structure and layout, usually with dry, moderate temperature and non-corrosive environmental conditions. In a light commercial environment, more frequent wiring changes can be expected, large apparatus may be installed and special conditions of heat or moisture may apply. Heavy industries have more demanding wiring requirements, such as very large currents and higher voltages, frequent changes of equipment layout, corrosive, or wet or explosive atmospheres. In facilities that handle flammable gases or liquids, special rules may govern the installation and wiring of electrical equipment in hazardous areas.

Wires and cables are rated by the circuit voltage, temperature rating and environmental conditions (moisture, sunlight, oil, chemicals) in which they can be used. A wire or cable has a voltage (to neutral) rating and a maximum conductor surface temperature rating. The amount of current a cable or wire can safely carry depends on the installation conditions.

The international standard wire sizes are given in the IEC 60228 standard of the International Electrotechnical Commission. In North America, the American Wire Gauge standard for wire sizes is used.

==Cables==

===Modern wiring materials===
Modern non-metallic sheathed cables, such as (US and Canadian) Types NMB and NMC, consist of two to four wires covered with thermoplastic insulation, plus a wire for Protective Earthing/Grounding (bonding), surrounded by a flexible plastic jacket. In North America and the UK this conductor is usually bare wire but in the UK it is required that this bare Protective Earth (PE) conductor be sheathed in Green/Yellow insulating tubing where the Cable Sheathing has been removed. Most other jurisdictions now require the Protective Earth conductor to be insulated to the same standard as the current carrying conductors with Green/Yellow insulation.

With some cables the individual conductors are wrapped in paper before the plastic jacket is applied.

Special versions of non-metallic sheathed cables, such as US Type UF, are designed for direct underground burial (often with separate mechanical protection) or exterior use where exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV) is a possibility. These cables differ in having a moisture-resistant construction, lacking paper or other absorbent fillers, and being formulated for UV resistance.

Rubber-like synthetic polymer insulation is used in industrial cables and power cables installed underground because of its superior moisture resistance.

Insulated cables are rated by their allowable operating voltage and their maximum operating temperature at the conductor surface. A cable may carry multiple usage ratings for applications, for example, one rating for dry installations and another when exposed to moisture or oil.

Generally, single conductor building wire in small sizes is solid wire, since the wiring is not required to be very flexible. Building wire conductors larger than 10 AWG (or about 5 mm2) are stranded for flexibility during installation, but are not sufficiently pliable to use as appliance cord.

Cables for industrial, commercial and apartment buildings may contain many insulated conductors in an overall jacket, with helical tape steel or aluminium armour, or steel wire armour, and perhaps as well an overall PVC or lead jacket for protection from moisture and physical damage. Cables intended for very flexible service or in marine applications may be protected by woven bronze wires. Power or communications cables (e.g., computer networking) that are routed in or through air-handling spaces (plenums) of office buildings are required under the model building code to be either encased in metal conduit, or rated for low flame and smoke production.
For some industrial uses in steel mills and similar hot environments, no organic material gives satisfactory service. Cables insulated with compressed mica flakes are sometimes used. Another form of high-temperature cable is mineral-insulated cable, with individual conductors placed within a copper tube and the space filled with magnesium oxide powder. The whole assembly is drawn down to smaller sizes, thereby compressing the powder. Such cables have a certified fire resistance rating and are more costly than non–fire-rated cable. They have little flexibility and behave more like rigid conduit rather than flexible cables.

The environment of the installed wires determine how much current a cable is permitted to carry. Because multiple conductors bundled in a cable cannot dissipate heat as easily as single insulated conductors, those circuits are always rated at a lower ampacity. Tables in electrical safety codes give the maximum allowable current based on size of conductor, voltage potential, insulation type and thickness, and the temperature rating of the cable itself. The allowable current will also be different for wet or dry locations, for hot (attic) or cool (underground) locations. In a run of cable through several areas, the part with the lowest rating becomes the rating of the overall run.

Cables usually are secured with special fittings where they enter electrical apparatus; this may be a simple screw clamp for jacketed cables in a dry location, or a polymer-gasketed cable connector that mechanically engages the armour of an armoured cable and provides a water-resistant connection. Special cable fittings may be applied to prevent explosive gases from flowing in the interior of jacketed cables, where the cable passes through areas where flammable gases are present. To prevent loosening of the connections of individual conductors of a cable, cables must be supported near their entrance to devices and at regular intervals along their runs. In tall buildings, special designs are required to support the conductors of vertical runs of cable. Generally, only one cable per fitting is permitted, unless the fitting is rated or listed for multiple cables.

Special cable constructions and termination techniques are required for cables installed in ships. Such assemblies are subjected to environmental and mechanical extremes. Therefore, in addition to electrical and fire safety concerns, such cables may also be required to be pressure-resistant where they penetrate a vessel&#x27;s bulkheads. They must also resist corrosion caused by salt water or salt spray, which is accomplished through the use of thicker, specially constructed jackets, and by tinning the individual wire stands.
In North American practice, for residential and light commercial buildings fed with a single-phase split 120/240 service, an overhead cable from a transformer on a power pole is run to the service entrance point. The cable is a three conductor twisted &quot;triplex&quot; cable with a bare neutral and two insulated conductors, with no overall cable jacket. The neutral conductor is often a supporting &quot;messenger&quot; steel wire, which is used to support the insulated line conductors.

===Copper conductors===

Electrical devices often use copper conductors because of their properties, including their high electrical conductivity, tensile strength, ductility, creep resistance, corrosion resistance, thermal conductivity, coefficient of thermal expansion, solderability, resistance to electrical overloads, compatibility with electrical insulators, and ease of installation. Copper is used in many types of electrical wiring.

===Aluminium conductors===

Aluminium wire was common in North American residential wiring from the late 1960s to mid-1970s due to the rising cost of copper. Because of its greater resistivity, aluminium wiring requires larger conductors than copper. For instance, instead of 14 AWG (American wire gauge) copper wire, aluminium wiring would need to be 12 AWG on a typical 15 ampere lighting circuit, though local building codes vary.

Solid aluminium conductors were originally made in the 1960s from a utility-grade aluminium alloy that had undesirable properties for a building wire, and were used with wiring devices intended for copper conductors. These practices were found to cause defective connections and fire hazards. In the early 1970s new aluminium wire made from one of several special alloys was introduced, and all devices – breakers, switches, receptacles, splice connectors, wire nuts, etc. — were specially designed for the purpose. These newer aluminium wires and special designs address problems with junctions between dissimilar metals, oxidation on metal surfaces, and mechanical effects that occur as different metals expand at different rates with increases in temperature.

Unlike copper, aluminium has a tendency to creep or cold-flow under pressure, so older plain steel screw clamped connections could become loose over time. Newer electrical devices designed for aluminium conductors have features intended to compensate for this effect. Unlike copper, aluminium forms an insulating oxide layer on the surface. This is sometimes addressed by coating aluminium conductors with an antioxidant paste (containing zinc dust in a low-residue polybutene base) at joints, or by applying a mechanical termination designed to break through the oxide layer during installation.

Some terminations on wiring devices designed only for copper wire would overheat under heavy current load and cause fires when used with aluminium conductors. Revised standards for wire materials and wiring devices (such as the CO/ALR &quot;copper-aluminium-revised&quot; designation) were developed to reduce these problems. While larger sizes are still used to feed power to electrical panels and large devices, aluminium wiring for residential use has acquired a poor reputation and has fallen out of favour.

Aluminium conductors are still heavily used for bulk power transmission, power distribution, and large feeder circuits with heavy current loads, due to the various advantages they offer over copper wiring. Aluminium conductors both cost and weigh less than copper conductors, so a much larger cross sectional area can be used for the same weight and price. This can compensate for the higher resistance and lower mechanical strength of aluminium, meaning the larger cross sectional area is needed to achieve comparable current capacity and other features. Aluminium conductors must be installed with compatible connectors and special care must be taken to ensure the contact surface does not oxidise.

==Raceways and cable runs==


Insulated wires may be run in one of several forms between electrical devices. This may be a specialised bendable pipe, called a conduit, or one of several varieties of metal (rigid steel or aluminium) or non-metallic (PVC or HDPE) tubing. Rectangular cross-section metal or PVC wire troughs (North America) or trunking (UK) may be used if many circuits are required. Wires run underground may be run in plastic tubing encased in concrete, but metal elbows may be used in severe pulls. Wiring in exposed areas, for example factory floors, may be run in cable trays or rectangular raceways having lids.

Where wiring, or raceways that hold the wiring, must traverse fire-resistance rated walls and floors, the openings are required by local building codes to be firestopped. In cases where safety-critical wiring must be kept operational during an accidental fire, fireproofing must be applied to maintain circuit integrity in a manner to comply with a product&#x27;s certification listing. The nature and thickness of any passive fire protection materials used in conjunction with wiring and raceways has a quantifiable impact upon the ampacity derating, because the thermal insulation properties needed for fire resistance also inhibit air cooling of power conductors.
Cable trays are used in industrial areas where many insulated cables are run together. Individual cables can exit the tray at any point, simplifying the wiring installation and reducing the labour cost for installing new cables. Power cables may have fittings in the tray to maintain clearance between the conductors, but small control wiring is often installed without any intentional spacing between cables.

Local electrical regulations may restrict or place special requirements on mixing of voltage levels within one cable tray. Good design practices may segregate, for example, low level measurement or signal cables from trays carrying high power branch circuits, to prevent induction of noise into sensitive circuits.

Since wires run in conduits or underground cannot dissipate heat as easily as in open air, and since adjacent circuits contribute induced currents, wiring regulations give rules to establish the current capacity (ampacity).

Special sealed fittings are used for wiring routed through potentially explosive atmospheres.

==Bus bars, bus duct, cable bus==

For very high currents in electrical apparatus, and for high currents distributed through a building, bus bars can be used. (The term &quot;bus&quot; is a contraction of the Latin &quot;omnibus&quot; – meaning &quot;for all&quot;.) Each live (&quot;hot&quot;) conductor of such a system is a rigid piece of copper or aluminium, usually in flat bars (but sometimes as tubing or other shapes). Open bus bars are never used in publicly accessible areas, although they are used in manufacturing plants and power company switch yards to gain the benefit of air cooling. A variation is to use heavy cables, especially where it is desirable to transpose or &quot;roll&quot; phases.

In industrial applications, conductor bars are often pre-assembled with insulators in grounded enclosures. This assembly, known as bus duct or busway, can be used for connections to large switchgear or for bringing the main power feed into a building. A form of bus duct known as &quot;plug-in bus&quot; is used to distribute power down the length of a building; it is constructed to allow tap-off switches or motor controllers to be installed at designated places along the bus. The big advantage of this scheme is the ability to remove or add a branch circuit without removing voltage from the whole duct.
Bus ducts may have all phase conductors in the same enclosure (non-isolated bus), or may have each conductor separated by a grounded barrier from the adjacent phases (segregated bus). For conducting large currents between devices, a cable bus is used.

For very large currents in generating stations or substations, where it is difficult to provide circuit protection, an isolated-phase bus is used. Each phase of the circuit is run in a separate grounded metal enclosure. The only fault possible is a phase-to-ground fault, since the enclosures are separated. This type of bus can be rated up to 50,000 amperes and up to hundreds of kilovolts (during normal service, not just for faults), but is not used for building wiring in the conventional sense.

==Electrical panels==

Electrical panels are easily accessible junction boxes used to reroute and switch electrical services. The term is often used to refer to circuit breaker panels or fuseboxes. Local codes can specify physical clearance around the panels.

==Degradation by pests==

Squirrels, rats, and other rodents may gnaw on unprotected wiring, causing fire and shock hazards. This is especially true of PVC-insulated telephone and computer network cables. Several techniques have been developed to deter these pests, including insulation loaded with pepper dust.

==Early wiring methods==

The first interior power wiring systems used conductors that were bare or covered with cloth, which were secured by staples to the framing of the building or on running boards. Where conductors went through walls, they were protected with cloth tape. Splices were done similarly to telegraph connections, and soldered for security. Underground conductors were insulated with wrappings of cloth tape soaked in pitch, and laid in wooden troughs which were then buried. Such wiring systems were unsatisfactory because of the danger of electrocution and fire, plus the high labour cost for such installations.
The first electrical codes arose in the 1880s with the commercial introduction of electrical power; however, many conflicting standards existed for the selection of wire sizes and other design rules for electrical installations, and a need was seen to introduce uniformity on the grounds of safety.

===Knob and tube (US)===
The earliest standardized method of wiring in buildings, in common use in North America from about 1880 to the 1930s, was &quot;knob and tube&quot; (K&amp;T) wiring: single conductors were run through cavities between the structural members in walls and ceilings, with ceramic tubes forming protective channels through joists and ceramic knobs attached to the structural members to provide air between the wire and the lumber and to support the wires. Since air was free to circulate over the wires, smaller conductors could be used than required in cables. By arranging wires on opposite sides of building structural members, some protection was afforded against short-circuits that can be caused by driving a nail into both conductors simultaneously.

By the 1940s, the labor cost of installing two conductors rather than one cable resulted in a decline in new knob-and-tube installations. However, the US code still allows new K&amp;T wiring installations in special situations (some rural and industrial applications).

===Metal-sheathed wires===

In the United Kingdom, an early form of insulated cable, introduced in 1896, consisted of two impregnated-paper-insulated conductors in an overall lead sheath. Joints were soldered, and special fittings were used for lamp holders and switches. These cables were similar to underground telegraph and telephone cables of the time. Paper-insulated cables proved unsuitable for interior wiring installations because very careful workmanship was required on the lead sheaths to ensure moisture did not affect the insulation.

A system later invented in the UK in 1908 employed vulcanised-rubber insulated wire enclosed in a strip metal sheath. The metal sheath was bonded to each metal wiring device to ensure earthing continuity.

A system developed in Germany called &quot;Kuhlo wire&quot; used one, two, or three rubber-insulated wires in a brass or lead-coated iron sheet tube, with a crimped seam. The enclosure could also be used as a return conductor. Kuhlo wire could be run exposed on surfaces and painted, or embedded in plaster. Special outlet and junction boxes were made for lamps and switches, made either of porcelain or sheet steel. The crimped seam was not considered as watertight as the &quot;Stannos&quot; wire used in England, which had a soldered sheath.

A somewhat similar system called &quot;concentric wiring&quot; was introduced in the United States around 1905. In this system, an insulated electrical wire was wrapped with copper tape which was then soldered, forming the grounded (return) conductor of the wiring system. The bare metal sheath, at earth potential, was considered safe to touch. While companies such as General Electric manufactured fittings for the system and a few buildings were wired with it, it was never adopted into the US National Electrical Code. Drawbacks of the system were that special fittings were required, and that any defect in the connection of the sheath would result in the sheath becoming energised.

===Other historical wiring methods===
Armored cables with two rubber-insulated conductors in a flexible metal sheath were used as early as 1906, and were considered at the time a better method than open knob-and-tube wiring, although much more expensive.

The first rubber-insulated cables for US building wiring were introduced in 1922 with . These were two or more solid copper electrical wires with rubber insulation, plus woven cotton cloth over each conductor for protection of the insulation, with an overall woven jacket, usually impregnated with tar as a protection from moisture. Waxed paper was used as a filler and separator.

Over time, rubber-insulated cables become brittle because of exposure to atmospheric oxygen, so they must be handled with care and are usually replaced during renovations. When switches, socket outlets or light fixtures are replaced, the mere act of tightening connections may cause hardened insulation to flake off the conductors. Rubber insulation further inside the cable often is in better condition than the insulation exposed at connections, due to reduced exposure to oxygen.

The sulfur in vulcanized rubber insulation attacked bare copper wire so the conductors were tinned to prevent this. The conductors reverted to being bare when rubber ceased to be used.
About 1950, PVC insulation and jackets were introduced, especially for residential wiring. About the same time, single conductors with a thinner PVC insulation and a thin nylon jacket (e.g. US Type THN, THHN, etc.) became common.

The simplest form of cable has two insulated conductors twisted together to form a unit. Such non-jacketed cables with two (or more) conductors are used only for extra-low voltage signal and control applications such as doorbell wiring.

Other methods of securing wiring that are now obsolete include:
* Re-use of existing gas pipes when converting gas lighting installations to electric lighting. Insulated conductors were pulled through the pipes that had formerly supplied the gas lamps. Although used occasionally, this method risked insulation damage from sharp edges inside the pipe at each joint.
* Wood mouldings with grooves cut for single conductor wires, covered by a wooden cap strip. These were prohibited in North American electrical codes by 1928. Wooden moulding was also used to some degree in the UK, but was never permitted by German and Austrian rules.
* A system of flexible twin cords supported by glass or porcelain buttons was used near the turn of the 20th century in Europe, but was soon replaced by other methods.
* During the first years of the 20th century, various patented forms of wiring system such as Bergman and Peschel tubing were used to protect wiring; these used very thin fibre tubes, or metal tubes which were also used as return conductors.
* In Austria, wires were concealed by embedding a rubber tube in a groove in the wall, plastering over it, then removing the tube and pulling wires through the cavity.

Metal moulding systems, with a flattened oval section consisting of a base strip and a snap-on cap channel, were more costly than open wiring or wooden moulding, but could be easily run on wall surfaces. Similar surface mounted raceway wiring systems are still available today.

<doc id="1105940" wikidata="Q1059073" url="?curid=1105940" title="Borjigin">
<text>A Borjigin is a member of the Mongol sub-clan that started with Bodonchar Munkhag of the Kiyat clan. Yesugei&#x27;s descendants were thus said to be Kiyat-Borjigin. The senior Borjigids provided ruling princes for Mongolia and Inner Mongolia until the 20th century. The clan formed the ruling class among the Mongols and some other peoples of Central Asia and Eastern Europe. Today, the Borjigid are found in most of Mongolia, Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang, and genetic research has shown that descent from Genghis Khan and Timur is common throughout Central Asia and other regions.

== Origin and name ==

The patrilineage began with Blue-grey Wolf (Börte Chino) and Fallow Doe (Gua Maral). According to &quot;The Secret History of the Mongols&quot;, their 11th generation descendant Dobu Mergen&#x27;s widow Alan Gua the Fair was impregnated by a ray of light. Her youngest son became the ancestor of the later Borjigid. He was Bodonchar Munkhag, who along with his brothers sired the entire Mongol nation. According to Rashid-al-Din Hamadani, many of the older Mongolian clans were founded by members of the Borjigin—Barlas, Urud, Manghud, Taichiut, Chonos, Kiyat, etc. The first Khan of the Mongol was Bodonchar Munkhag&#x27;s great-great-grandson Khaidu Khan. Khaidu&#x27;s grandsons Khabul Khan and Ambaghai Khan (founder of the Taichiut clan) succeeded him. Thereafter, Khabul&#x27;s sons, Hotula Khan and Yesugei, and Khabul&#x27;s grandson Temujin (Genghis Khan, son of Yesugei) ruled the Khamag Mongol. By the unification of the Mongols in 1206, virtually all of Temujin&#x27;s uncles and first cousins had died, and from then on only the descendants of Yesugei Baghatur, his brother Daritai, and nephew Onggur formed the Borjigid.

According to Paul Pelliot and Louis Hambis, Rashid al-Din Hamadani once explained that &quot;&quot;borčïqïn&quot; designated in the Turkic languages a man with dark-blue eyes (), and did so again without mentioning the said language, adding that Yesugei&#x27;s children and the majority of their own children had had such eyes per coincidence, also recalling that the genie which had impregnated Alan Gua after her husband&#x27;s death had had dark-blue eyes (&quot;ašhal čašm&quot;&quot;). Abu al-Ghazi Bahadur later paraphrased Hamadani by relating that Yesugei&#x27;s eyes were dark-blue (&quot; &quot;šahlā&quot;), that the Mongols (&quot;Moɣol&quot;) called such eyes &quot;borǰïɣïn&quot; (بورجغن), that his sons and most of their descendants had dark-blue eyes (&quot;ašhal&quot;), and that one recognized thus in Yesugei&#x27;s lineage the characteristic sign of the genie which had visited Alan Gua and had &quot;borǰïɣïn&quot; eyes, adding that the Arabs called &quot;ašhal&quot; a man whose iris (&quot;bübäčik&quot;) was black, cornea white (&quot;aq&quot;&quot;), and whose limbal ring was red.

== History ==
The Borjigin family ruled over the Mongol Empire from the 13th to 14th century. The rise of Genghis Khan narrowed the scope of the Borjigid-Kiyad clans sharply. This separation was emphasized by the intermarriage of Genghis&#x27;s descendants with the Baarin, Manghud and other branches of the original Borjigid. In the western regions of the Empire, the Jurkin and perhaps other lineages near to Genghis&#x27;s lineage used the clan name Kiyad but did not share in the privileges of the Genghisids. The Borjigit clan had once dominated large lands stretching from Java to Iran and from Indo-China to Novgorod. In 1335, with the disintegration of the Ilkhanate in Iran, the first of numerous non-Genghisid dynasties appeared. Established by marriage partners of Genghisids, these included the Suldus Chupanids, Jalayirids in the Middle East, the Barlas dynasties in the former Chagatai Khanate and India, the Manghud and Onggirat dynasties in the Golden Horde and Central Asia, and the Oirats in western Mongolia.

In 1368, during the reign of Toghun Temür (Emperor Huizong of Yuan), the Yuan dynasty was overthrown by the Ming dynasty but members of the family continued to rule over northern China and the Mongolian Plateau into the 17th century, known as the Northern Yuan dynasty. Descendants of Genghis Khan&#x27;s brothers, Hasar and Belgutei, surrendered to the Ming in the 1380s. By 1470 the Borjigin lines were severely weakened, and the Mongolian Plateau was almost in chaos.

=== Post-Mongol Empire ===
After the breakup of the Golden Horde, the Khiyat continued to rule the Crimea and Kazan until the late 18th century. They were annexed by the Russian Empire and the Chinese. In Mongolia, the Kublaids reigned as Khagan of the Mongols, however, descendants of Ögedei and Ariq Böke usurped the throne briefly.

Under Dayan Khan (1480–1517) a broad Borjigid revival reestablished Borjigid supremacy among the Mongols proper. His descendants proliferated to become a new ruling class. The Borjigin clan was the strongest of the 49 Mongol banners from which the Bontoi clan proper supported and fought for their Khan and for their honor. The eastern Khorchins were under the Hasarids, and the Ongnigud, Abagha Mongols were under the Belguteids and Temüge Odchigenids. A fragment of the Hasarids deported to Western Mongolia became the Khoshuts.

The Qing dynasty respected the Borjigin family and the early emperors married the Hasarid Borjigids of the Khorchin. Even among the pro-Qing Mongols, traces of the alternative tradition survived. Aci Lomi, a banner general, wrote his &quot;History of the Borjigid Clan&quot; in 1732–35. The 18th century and 19th century Qing nobility was adorned by the descendants of the early Mongol adherents including the Borjigin.

Asian dynasties descended from Genghis Khan included the Yuan dynasty of China, the Ilkhanids of Persia, the Jochids of the Golden Horde, the Shaybanids of Siberia and Central Asia, and the Astrakhanids of Central Asia. As a rule, the Genghisid descent played a crucial role in Tatar politics. For instance, Mamai had to exercise his authority through a succession of puppet khans but could not assume the title of khan himself because he lacked Genghisid lineage.

The word &quot;Chingisid&quot; derives from the name of the Mongol conqueror Genghis (Chingis) Khan (c. 1162–1227 CE). Genghis and his successors created a vast empire stretching from the Sea of Japan to the Black Sea.

* The &quot;Chingisid principle&quot;, or golden lineage, was the rule of inheritance laid down in the (Yassa), the legal code attributed to Genghis Khan.
* A &quot;Chingisid prince&quot; was one who could trace direct descent from Genghis Khan in the male line, and who could therefore claim high respect in the Mongol, Turkic and Asiatic world.
* The &quot;Chingisid states&quot; were the successor states or Khanates after the Mongol empire broke up following the death of the Genghis Khan&#x27;s sons and their successors.
* The term &quot;Chingisid people&quot; was used to describe the people of Genghis Khan&#x27;s armies who came in contact with Europeans. It applied primarily the Golden Horde, led by Batu Khan, a grandson of Genghis. Members of the Horde were predominantly Kıpchak— Turkic-speaking people rather than Mongols. (Although the aristocracy was largely Mongol, Mongols were never more than a small minority in the armies and the lands they conquered.) Europeans often (incorrectly) called the people of the Golden Horde &quot;Tartars&quot;.

Babur and Humayun, founders of the Mughal Empire in India, asserted their authority as Chinggisids. Because they claimed descent through their maternal lineage, they had never used the clan name Borjigin.

The Genghisids also include such dynasties and houses as Giray, House of Siberia, Ar begs, Yaushev family and other.

The last ruling monarch of Genghisid ancestry, Maqsud Shah (d. 1930), Khan of Kumul from 1908 to 1930.

=== Modern relevance ===
The Borjigin held power over Mongolia for many centuries (even during Qing period) and only lost power when Communists took control in the 20th century. Aristocratic descent was something to be forgotten in the socialist period. Joseph Stalin&#x27;s associates executed some 30,000 Mongols including Borjigin nobles in a series of campaigns against their culture and religion. Clan association has lost its practical relevance in the 20th century, but is still considered a matter of honour and pride by many Mongolians. In 1920s the communist regime banned the use of clan names. When the ban was lifted again in 1997, and people were told they had to have surnames, most families had lost knowledge about their clan association. Because of that, a disproportionate number of families registered the most prestigious clan name Borjigin, many of them without historic justification. The label Borjigin is used as a measure of cultural supremacy.

In Inner Mongolia, the Borjigid or Kiyad name became the basis for many Chinese surnames adopted by ethnic Inner Mongols. The Inner Mongolian Borjigin Taijis took the surname Bao (, from Borjigid) and in Ordos Qi (, Qiyat). A genetic research has proposed that as many as 16 million men from populations as far apart as Hazaras in the West and Hezhe people to the east may have Borjigid-Kiyad ancestry. The Qiyat clan name is still found among the Kazakhs, Uzbeks and Nogai Karakalpaks

== Yuan dynasty family tree ==
Genghis Khan founded the Mongol Empire in 1206. His grandson, Kublai Khan, after defeating his younger brother and rival claimant to the throne Ariq Böke, founded the Yuan dynasty of China in 1271. The dynasty was overthrown by the Ming dynasty during the reign of Toghon Temür in 1368, but it survived in the Mongolian Plateau, known as the Northern Yuan dynasty. Although the throne was usurped by Esen Taishi of the Oirats in 1453, he was overthrown in the next year. A recovery of the khaganate was achieved by Dayan Khan, but the territory was segmented by his descendants. The last khan Ligden died in 1634 and his son Ejei Khongor submitted himself to Hong Taiji the next year, ending the Northern Yuan regime. However, the Borjigin nobles continued to rule their subjects until the 20th century under the Qing dynasty.

Or in a different version (years of reign over the Northern Yuan dynasty [up to 1388] are given in brackets).

<text>The Iwakura Mission or Iwakura Embassy (, &quot;Iwakura Shisetsudan&quot;) was a Japanese diplomatic voyage to the United States and Europe conducted between 1871 and 1873 by leading statesmen and scholars of the Meiji period. It was not the only such mission, but it is the most well-known and possibly most significant in terms of its impact on the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. The mission was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck, based to some degree on the model of the Grand Embassy of Peter I.

The aim of the mission was threefold: to gain recognition for the newly reinstated imperial dynasty under the Emperor Meiji; to begin preliminary renegotiation of the unequal treaties with the dominant world powers; and to make a comprehensive study of modern industrial, political, military and educational systems and structures in the United States and Europe.

The Iwakura Mission followed several such missions previously sent by the Shogunate, such as the Japanese Embassy to the United States in 1860, the First Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1862, and the Second Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1863.

==Participants==
The mission was named after and headed by Iwakura Tomomi in the role of extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador, assisted by four vice-ambassadors, three of whom (Ōkubo Toshimichi, Kido Takayoshi, and Itō Hirobumi) were also ministers in the Japanese government. The historian Kume Kunitake as private secretary to Iwakura Tomomi, was the official diarist of the journey. The log of the expedition published in 1878 in five volumes as &quot;Tokumei Zenken Taishi Bei-O Kairan Jikki&quot; (特命全権大使米欧回覧実記), provided a detailed account of Japanese observations on the United States and rapidly industrializing Western Europe.

Also included in the mission were a number of administrators and scholars, totaling 48 people. In addition to the mission staff, about 53 students and attendants also joined the outward voyage from Yokohama. Several of the students were left behind to complete their education in the foreign countries, including five young women who stayed in the United States to study, including the then 6-year old Tsuda Umeko, who after returning to Japan, founded the Joshi Eigaku Juku (present day Tsuda University) in 1900, Nagai Shigeko, later Baroness Uryū Shigeko, as well as Yamakawa Sutematsu, later Princess Ōyama Sutematsu.

* Kaneko Kentarō was left in the U.S., too, as a student. In 1890 he was introduced to Theodore Roosevelt. They became friends and their relationship resulted later in Roosevelt&#x27;s mediation at the end of the Russo-Japanese War and the Treaty of Portsmouth.
* Makino Nobuaki, a student member of the mission was to remark in his memoirs: &quot;Together with the abolition of the han system, dispatching the Iwakura Mission to America and Europe must be cited as the most important events that built the foundation of our state after the Restoration.&quot;
* Nakae Chōmin, who was a member of the mission staff and the Ministry of Justice, stayed in France to study the French legal system with the radical republican Emile Acollas. Later he became a journalist, thinker and translator and introduced French thinkers like Jean-Jacques Rousseau to Japan.

==Itinerary==

===United States===
On 23 December 1871 an expedition of 100 Japanese leaders, government officials, and students, set sail for the West, (from Yokohama), on the , bound for San Francisco. Arriving in San Francisco on 15 January 1872, the group travelled by train via Salt Lake City and Chicago eventually reaching Washington, D.C., on 29 February. The mission was to investigate Western nations to understand their socio-economic, political, and economic developments. Japan, like many other nations, was on the precipice of change. Industrialization ushered in technological innovation. It was a period of modernity that Japan embraced. The mission&#x27;s stay in the United States was extended with an attempt to negotiate new treaty rights, a task that necessitated two members of the party to return to Japan to obtain necessary letters of representation. 

Members of the Iwakura Mission were keenly interested in observing schools and learning more about educational policy. Tours to schools, universities and industrial locations in Boston, New York and Washington, D.C., were made as a result. While in Washington, D.C., the Japanese delegation visited Howard University, a Historically Black College and University. As a result, the delegation came away with some degree of analysis of race, education, and class in the United States at the time.

Unsuccessful in their attempts to renegotiate the existing unequal treaties, the party eventually set sail for the United Kingdom in August 1872.

===United Kingdom===
On 17 August 1872 the Iwakura Mission arrived at Liverpool on the Cunard steamer Olympus. Traveling to London via Manchester the party spent much of late August and early September in and around the capital inspecting political, academic and military institutions, visiting the British Museum, travelling on the newly constructed London Underground and attending musical concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. After visits to the Royal dockyards at Portsmouth and a day visit to Brighton, the mission split into smaller groups to visit, among other places, Blair Atholl in the Highlands of Scotland, Edinburgh, the Yorkshire Dales and the industrial centers of Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle upon Tyne and Bradford.

Iwakura Tomomi led the Manchester-Liverpool delegation. A visit that culminated on 7 October in a civic reception and banquet where toasts highlighted the leading role of the region in world manufacturing, technology and municipal administration. In Glasgow, as guests of Lord Blantyre, the delegation stayed at Erskine House and were given tours of shipbuilding and steel fabrication facilities on banks of the River Clyde.

In Newcastle upon Tyne the group arrived on 21 October, staying in the Royal Station Hotel where they met the industrialist Sir William Armstrong. It had been ten years since the Bakufu mission had visited the town, but as a direct result of the visit significant new export orders were obtained for ships and armaments from Tyneside factories.

The gentlemen were attired in ordinary morning costume and except for their complexion and the oriental cast of their features, they could scarcely be distinguished from their English companions.
:— &quot;Newcastle Daily Chronicle&quot;, 23 October 1872

They visited the Elswick Engine and Ordnance Works with Captain Andrew Noble and George Rendell, inspected the hydraulic engines and the boring and turning departments and examined the construction of Armstrong and Gatling guns. They also visited the Gosforth Colliery, descending into the mine itself. Further visits were made to Bolckow and the Vaughan Iron Works in Middlesbrough and iron-ore mines in Cleveland. The Newcastle and Gateshead Chamber of Commerce arranged a river trip on the Tyne, taking in the High Level Bridge, the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Company Hebburn and the Jarrow Chemical Works.

From Newcastle upon Tyne the group travelled to Yorkshire, visiting the open countryside and Bolton Abbey prior to inspecting textile manufacturing facilities at Salts Mill in Saltaire and Dean Clough Mill in Halifax. Accompanied by the British Envoy to Japan, Sir Harry Smith Parkes, the group toured not only manufacturing facilities but also villages, schools, almshouses, hospitals and parks, which had been provided by Sir Titus Salt and Sir John Crossley for their workers.

A visit to Chatsworth House on 30 October was followed by visits to Burton-upon-Trent, Birmingham, Worcester, Stoke on Trent and Chester.

The delegation was presented at an official audience with Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 5 December 1872. Another audience with the Prince of Wales took place at Sandringham on 9 December. The party finally left for France on 16 December.

===Continental Europe, and return voyage to Japan===
France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Italy, and Switzerland were all visited by the mission during the first half of 1873. On the return journey, Egypt, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, and Shanghai were also stopping points en route, although visits in these locations were much shorter. The mission eventually reached Yokohama on 13 September 1873, almost two years after first setting out.

==Purpose and results==
Of the initial goals of the mission the aim of revision of the unequal treaties was not achieved, prolonging the mission by almost four months, but also impressing the importance of the second goal on its members. The attempts to negotiate new treaties under better conditions with the foreign governments led to criticism of the mission that members were attempting to go beyond the mandate set by the Japanese government. Members of the mission were nonetheless favorably impressed by industrial modernization seen in America and Europe and the experience of the tour provided them a strong impetus to lead similar modernization initiatives on their return.

==Commemoration events==
* In 1997 a special celebration marked the 125th anniversary of the mission&#x27;s visit to the north-west of England. Led by the Centre for Japanese Studies at the University of Manchester in collaboration with the Osaka Chamber of Commerce, a delegation of over 70 leading industrialists visited the Manchester Region. A Civic Banquet was held in Manchester Town Hall replicating the 1872 Reception. The Lord Mayor attended and received Ambassadors together with a citation from the Japanese Foreign Minister. A Civic Plaque commemorating the anniversary of the Iwakura Mission to Manchester was also inaugurated at the site of the original Manchester Town Hall.
* On 24th April 2023, Senior business leaders and political figures from the UK and Japan attended the Japan-UK Symposium, celebrating the 150 years of the Iwakura Mission at Japan House London in Kensington High Street, organised by the Institute of Directors’ Japan Business Group in partnership with the Embassy of Japan, the Department of International Trade, Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industries (JCCI), Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO), Japan Society, Japan Exchange Group (JPX), Shimadzu UK Ltd and others. Speakers include The Rt Hon Nigel Huddleston MP, Minister of State for International Trade; The Rt Hon Greg Clark, MP Trade Envoy to Japan; The Rt Hon Anne-Marie Trevelyan MP, Minister of State in the Foreign, Commonwealth &amp; Development Office; Hon. Rajesh Agrawal, Deputy Mayor of London for Business; and His Excellency Hajime Hayashi, Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Japan to the UK.

<text>WCNN (680 AM) is a radio station licensed to North Atlanta and serving the Atlanta-area radio market. It is owned by Dickey Broadcasting and airs a sports radio format. The station is commonly known by the on-air branding as &quot;The Fan&quot;. Local sports shows are heard weekdays with the ESPN Radio Network airing nights and weekends. WCNN is the flagship of the Atlanta Braves Radio Network.

WCNN broadcasts with a power of 50,000 watts during the daytime, and 10,000 watts at night, using a directional antenna at all times to protect other stations on AM 680 including KNBR from San Francisco. WCNN&#x27;s transmitter and towers are located near Norcross, Georgia, northeast of Atlanta. WCNN is also heard on a 250-watt FM translator, W229AG at 93.7 MHz.

The station formerly broadcast the audio portion of the CNN Headline News channel (hence its current call sign), an all-news radio format that the station pioneered in the 1980s and re-appeared on the station later in the station&#x27;s history.

==History==
On September 1, 1965, the station signed on as WRNG, Atlanta&#x27;s first talk radio station. The last three letters of the call sign represented the station&#x27;s branding as &quot;Ring Radio,&quot; as in the ringing of a telephone. The station was originally a daytimer operating at 5,000 watts but having to sign-off at night. It was the first broadcast home of talk radio personality Neal Boortz, who went onto a long career at WSB and syndicated nationally. Other, now well known talk radio personalities were also heard on the station, including Ronn Owens, later at KGO in San Francisco, Southern Humorist Ludlow Porch, and Barry Young, later at KFYI in Phoenix.

In 1982, the station began an experiment by broadcasting the audio feed of CNN Headline News. The call letters were changed to WCNN, a nod to CNN&#x27;s headquarters being in Atlanta.

In February 1987, the station switched to an adult standards radio format and changed its call letters to WGTW. Its call sign was a reference to the Atlanta-based classic movie &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;, which, coincidentally, is the favorite movie of CNN founder Ted Turner. The station went by the branding &quot;Stardust 680&quot; during that time. The radio format failed to gain ratings in the market.

In late 1988, chief engineer Bob Mayben and his staff built elaborate studios in the CNN Center (formerly known as The Omni) and became WCNN &quot;All News 680&quot;, with a 24-hour local news format. The CNN Headline News audio returned in June 1990, when the local all-news format failed to generate sufficient ratings. In 1995, WCNN was leased to Cox Radio for a 5-year term. The radio format was switched to Sports Talk as &quot;680 The Fan&quot;. In 1998, the format switched to news/talk to complement WSB&#x27;s programming. In 2000, when the LMA expired, control of WCNN returned to Dickey Broadcasting. The &quot;680 The Fan&quot; branding and the sports radio format returned to WCNN.

WCNN was the flagship station of the Atlanta Thrashers before the Thrashers moved to Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, and was the flagship of the Atlanta Hawks Radio Network before rival WZGC gained the rights in 2013. It has been the flagship station of the Atlanta Braves Radio Network since 2010. WCNN is also the flagship station of Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football and men’s basketball. In 2019, the station became the flagship of Atlanta Gladiators hockey.

WCNN is now an affiliate of ESPN Radio after years of carrying CBS Sports Radio, NBC Sports Radio and Fox Sports Radio programming.

On November 30, 2010, WCNN got an FM simulcast on broadcast translator W229AG FM 93.7. In 2010, that station was actually assigned to carry WWWQ FM 99.7 HD3. It is located on Sweat Mountain, and for several years previously carried KAWZ FM, a Christian broadcasting station which feeds hundreds of translator stations from Calvary Chapel in Twin Falls, Idaho. It had Sandy Plains and now Atlanta as its community of license. 99X was reportedly set to move to this station, which had a construction permit granted in July 2010 to relocate to the same tower near North Druid Hills as WWWQ and W250BC, and has the same power but somewhat lower height (and therefore broadcast range) as 99X has on W250BC. The station was still owned by Calvary Chapel of Twin Falls, when it filed for the permit in April 2010. After being approved in early July, Calvary applied just a few days later to transfer ownership of the station to Cumulus for $400,000. It is now licensed to Cumulus Licensing LLC and resides on the WWWQ tower.

During the 2021 postseason, the Atlanta Braves Radio Network&#x27;s coverage of their NLDS, NLCS and World Series appearances were carried on its online stream without geo-blocking restrictions. This has since continued into the 2022 season. 

==Programming==
WCNN is also an affiliate of the Performance Racing Network, which owns the Atlanta Motor Speedway in Hampton, Georgia.

<text>The United States embargo against Cuba has prevented U.S. businesses from conducting trade or commerce with Cuban interests since 1958. Modern diplomatic relations are cold, stemming from historic conflict and divergent political ideologies. U.S. economic sanctions against Cuba are comprehensive and impact all sectors of the Cuban economy. It is the most enduring trade embargo in modern history. The U.S. government influences extraterritorial trade with Cuba. The U.S. government first launched an arms embargo against Cuba in 1958, during the U.S.-backed Fulgencio Batista regime. The Cuban Revolution saw to the nationalization of Cuba, high U.S. imports taxes, and forfeiture of U.S.-owned economic assets, including oil refineries, without compensation. The U.S. retaliated in 1960 with total embargo on Cuban trade, with exception for food and medicine. Cuba held nuclear missiles for the Soviet Union during the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis, which led the U.S. to impose a full-scale blockade against the island. The severity of the sanctions brought on by the U.S. has had the United Nations pass annual resolutions to suspend the embargo intermittently since 1992. 

The embargo is enforced mainly through the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Cuban Assets Control Regulations of 1963, the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, the Helms–Burton Act of 1996, and the Trade Sanction Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. Relations remain tense due to stark differences on immigration, counterterrorism, civil and political rights, human rights on the island, electoral interference, disinformation campaigns, humanitarian aid, trade policy, financial claims, fugitive extradition and Cuban foreign policy. 

==History==
===Eisenhower presidency===
The United States imposed an arms embargo on Cuba on March 14, 1958, during the armed conflict of 1953-1959 between rebels led by Fidel Castro and the Fulgencio Batista régime. Arms sales violated U.S. policy which had permitted the sale of weapons to Latin-American countries which had signed the 1947 Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance (Rio Treaty) as long as the weapons were not used for hostile purposes. After the Castro socialist government came to power on January 1, 1959, relations were initially friendly between Castro and the Dwight D. Eisenhower administration but became strained after the Agricultural Reform confiscated land owned by many American businesses and Cuba continued to sponsor revolutionary movements in other parts of the Caribbean. By March 1960 the U.S. government began making plans to help overthrow the Castro administration. 

In April 1960, the U.S. Department of State issued a memorandum acknowledging majority support within Cuba for the Castro administration, the fast spread of communism within the country, and the lack of an effective political opposition. The memorandum stated that the &quot;only foreseeable means of alienating internal support is through disenchantment and disaffection based on economic dissatisfaction and hardship.&quot; It recommended a policy that would be &quot;adroit and inconspicuous as possible&quot; while aiming to deny &quot;money and supplies to Cuba, to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government.&quot; In May 1960 the Cuban government began regularly and openly purchasing armaments from the Soviet Union, citing the U.S. arms embargo. In July 1960 the U.S. reduced the import quota of brown sugar from Cuba to 700,000 tons under the Sugar Act of 1948; and the Soviet Union responded by agreeing to purchase the sugar instead. 

In June 1960, Eisenhower&#x27;s government refused to export oil to the island, leaving Cuba reliant on Soviet crude oil. Cuba and the Soviet Union signed a trade agreement according to which the Soviet Union would provide 900,000 tons of oil to Cuba. The U.S. viewed the agreement as a provocation, and successfully urged Esso, Texaco, and Shell to refuse to process Soviet crude in their Havana and Santiago de Cuba refineries. On June 29 and July 1, 1960, Cuba confiscated the refineries. The U.S. responded by canceling its quota of sugar purchases from Cuba. In turn, on August 30, 1960, the Cuban government nationalized three American-owned oil refineries as well as &quot;Compañía Cubana de Electricidad&quot;, the Cuban Telephone Company, and 36 sugar mills. The refineries became part of the state-run company, &quot;Unión Cuba-Petróleo&quot;. This prompted the Eisenhower administration to launch the first trade embargo—a prohibition against selling all products to Cuba outside of humanitarian aid. 

In October 1960 the Cuban administration responded by nationalizing all American businesses and most American privately owned properties on the island. Castro promised to separate Americans in Cuba from all of their possessions &quot;down to the nails in their shoes&quot;. Cuba&#x27;s nationalization laws required the government to compensate the owners of seized property, but compensation was to be made in Cuban bonds, an offer rejected by American authorities. Payments pursuant to the Cuban bonds were to be paid from the sale of Cuban sugar to the U.S., but the Americans had just canceled its purchases of Cuban sugar. No compensation was paid. Other countries which had their assets nationalised, including Switzerland, Canada, Spain, and France, were more agreeable to Castro’s terms, seemingly convinced that they would not be able to get a better deal.

The second wave of nationalizations prompted the Eisenhower administration, in one of its last actions, to sever all diplomatic relations with Cuba in January 1961. The U.S. partial trade embargo with Cuba continued under the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917. The Cuban government&#x27;s nationalization of U.S. owned property is the “largest uncompensated taking of American property by a foreign government in history.” Assets seized, included vacation homes and bank accounts of wealthy individuals, but most seized property was owned by large American corporations, including sugar factories, mines and oil refineries.

===Kennedy presidency===

At the Bay of Pigs Invasion of 17 to 20 April 1961, an operation devised under Eisenhower but which President John F. Kennedy had approved preceding his presidency, Castro characterized the Cuban revolution and state as &quot;socialist&quot;. It aligned with the Soviet Union. On September 4, 1961, partly in response, Congress passed the Foreign Assistance Act, a Cold War Act that prohibited aid to Cuba and authorized the President to impose a complete trade-embargo against Cuba. On January 21, 1962, Cuba was suspended by the Organization of American States (OAS), by a vote of 14 in favor, one (Cuba) against with six abstentions. Mexico and Ecuador, two abstaining members, argued that the OAS Charter did not authorize expulsion. Multilateral sanctions were imposed by OAS, led by the U.S., on July 26, 1964, but were later rescinded on July 29, 1975. Relations between Cuba and the OAS have since warmed and the suspension was lifted on June 3, 2009.

Kennedy extended measures by executive order, first widening the scope of the trade restrictions on February 8 and then again on March 23, 1962. These measures expanded the embargo to include all imports of products containing Cuban goods, even if the final products had been made or assembled outside Cuba. On August 3, 1962, the Foreign Assistance Act was amended to prohibit aid to any country that provides assistance to Cuba. On September 7, 1962, Kennedy formally expanded the Cuban embargo to include all Cuban trade, except for the non-subsidized sale of food and medicines. Following the Cuban Missile Crisis of October 1962, Kennedy imposed travel restrictions on February 8, 1963, and the Cuban Assets Control Regulations were issued on July 8, 1963, again under the Trading with the Enemy Act, in response to Cuba hosting Soviet nuclear weapons. These measures froze Cuban assets in the U.S. and consolidated existing restrictions.

===Rapprochement with Cuba===

The restrictions on U.S. citizens traveling to Cuba lapsed on March 19, 1977; the regulation was renewable every six months, but President Jimmy Carter did not renew it and the regulation on spending U.S. dollars in Cuba was lifted shortly afterwards. President Ronald Reagan reinstated the trade embargo on April 19, 1982, though it was now only restricted to business and tourist travel and did not apply to travel by U.S. government officials, employees of news or film making organizations, persons engaging in professional research, or persons visiting their close relatives. This has been modified subsequently with the present regulation, effective June 30, 2004, being the Cuban Assets Control Regulations (31 C.F.R. Part 515).

The current regulation does not prohibit travel by U.S. citizens to Cuba &quot;per se&quot;, but it makes it illegal for U.S. citizens to have transactions (spend money or receive gifts) in Cuba under most circumstances without a U.S. government Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) issued license. Since even paying unavoidable airfare ticket taxes into a Cuban airport would violate this transaction law, it is effectively impossible for ordinary tourists to visit Cuba without breaking the monetary transaction rule.

===Increasing legislation===

The embargo was reinforced in October 1992 by the Cuban Democracy Act and in 1996 by the Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act (known as the Helms–Burton Act) which penalizes foreign companies that do business in Cuba by preventing them from doing business in the U.S. The Helms-Burton Act further restricted U.S. citizens from doing commerce in or with Cuba, and mandated restrictions on giving public or private assistance to any successor government unless and until certain claims against the Cuban government were met. The key sponsor of the Cuban Democracy Act, Democrat Robert Torricelli, stated that the legislation would &quot;wreck havoc on that island.&quot; Justification provided for these restrictions was that these companies were trafficking in stolen U.S. properties, and should, thus., be excluded from the United States. President Barack Obama tried to lift the embargo, but Congress did not allow it. The European Union criticized the Helms-Burton Act because it felt that the U.S. was dictating how other nations ought to conduct their trade and challenged it on that basis. The E.U. eventually dropped its challenge in favor of negotiating a solution.

After the Cuban military shot down two airplanes operated by &quot;Hermanos al Rescate&quot; (Brothers to the Rescue) in 1996, killing three Americans and a U.S. resident, a bi-partisan coalition in the U.S. Congress approved the Helms–Burton Act. The Title III of this law also states that any non-U.S. company that &quot;knowingly traffics in property in Cuba confiscated without compensation from a U.S. person&quot; can be subjected to litigation and that company&#x27;s leadership can be barred from entry into the United States. Sanctions may also be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. This restriction also applies to maritime shipping, as ships docking at Cuban ports are not allowed to dock at U.S. ports for six months. This title includes waiver authority, so that the President might suspend its application. The waiver must be renewed every six months and traditionally was until U.S. President Donald Trump in 2019.

In response to pressure from some American farmers and agribusiness, the embargo was relaxed by the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act, which was passed by Congress in October 2000 and signed by President Bill Clinton. The relaxation allowed the sale of agricultural goods and medicine to Cuba for humanitarian reasons. Although Cuba initially declined to engage in such trade (having even refused U.S. food aid in the past, seeing it as a half-measure serving U.S. interests), the Cuban government began to allow the purchase of food from the U.S. as a result of Hurricane Michelle in November 2001. In some tourist spots across the island, American brands such as Coca-Cola can be purchased. Ford tankers refuel planes in airports and some computers use Microsoft software. The origin of the financing behind such goods is not always clear. The goods often come from third parties based in countries outside the U.S., even if the product being dealt originally has U.S. shareholders or investors.

===Cuban thaw===
In April 2009, President Barack Obama first attempted to warm relations by easing the U.S. travel ban, allowing Cuban-Americans to travel freely to Cuba. &quot;Ana Cecilia&quot; became the first officially approved ship to sail in July 2012 from Miami to Cuba. Two years later, in 2014, the Obama administration announced its intention to formally re-establish relations with Cuba and later completed a prisoner exchange. President Obama and Cuban President Raúl Castro met on April 11, 2015, the first meeting in over 50 years. On May 29, 2015, the U.S. removed Cuba from its designated list of state sponsors of terrorism on May 29, 2015, later re-adding it on January 12, 2021. U.S. banks then were temporarily allowed to open accredited accounts in Cuban banks.

Relations officially established on July 20, 2015, with increased travel licenses, amended civil aviation and commercial passenger aircraft regulations, and normalized import-export license requirements announced in September. In February 2016, the U.S. agreed to allow two American men to build a $5-10 million tractor factory. The deal was later disallowed by Cuban authorities because factory ownership is illegal in Cuba. In his final eight days in office, Obama formally discontinued the wet feet, dry feet policy, halting all illegal immigration from Cuba in an effort to promote legal alternatives.

=== Renewed embargo ===
On November 8, 2017, it was announced that President Trump&#x27;s administration had enacted new rules which would re-enforce the business and travel restrictions which were loosened by the Obama administration and would go into effect on November 9. In 2019, ExxonMobil, the largest American energy producer, sued the Cuban government for their theft of U.S. oil assets in the 1960s. In September 2019, the U.S. tightened restrictions on Cuba by limiting U.S. remittances to Cuba and further closing the country&#x27;s access to the U.S. financial system. Immediately following Cuba&#x27;s designation as a state sponsor of terrorism in January 2021, the State Department launched new political sanctions against Cuba&#x27;s support of Venezuela and their president, Nicolás Maduro. That month the U.S. Treasury additionally sanctioned the Cuban Ministry of Interior for human rights abuse in Cuba.

In July 2021, under President Joe Biden, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Cuba&#x27;s domestic police force and on two of Cuba&#x27;s leaders in response to political violence related to the 2021 Cuban protests. Cuba attempted to embargo the U.S. by banning U.S. cash deposits at Cuban banks in 2021 but had to reverse the ban due to economic distress in 2023. The U.S. government eased select financial sanctions against companies that serve Cuban interests but have no link to the Cuban government in 2024. President Biden authorized additional sanctions against Cuba during the 2024 Cuban protests which caused further diplomatic strain with Cuba&#x27;s president Miguel Díaz-Canel. President Díaz-Canel was joined by former president Raúl Castro in a protest with &quot;tens of thousands of Cubans&quot; against the U.S. embargo in December following the re-election of President Trump. 

=== &quot;Total pressure&quot; embargo ===
The U.S. government significantly tightened its economic sanctions against Cuba in January 2025, with the re-election of President Trump, orienting around a &quot;total pressure&quot; strategy, according to the Center for Economic and Policy Research. In addition to re-designating the island as a state sponsor of terrorism for a third time, the State Department announced further sanctions against Cuban military contractors and further restricted Cuba&#x27;s access to the U.S. dollar. U.S. Homeland Security and Coast Guard soon thereafter restricted immigration of economic refugees from Cuba, along with Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela. The U.S. re-activiated Title III of the Helms–Burton Act, an international deterrent against foreign investment in Cuba. 

==Impact==
===Economic impact===

The economic impact of the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba is comprehensive and impacts all sectors of the Cuban economy. The United Nations estimated in 2023 the total economic damage to the Cuban economy to be in the &quot;trillions of dollars&quot; since inception. It assessed the damage to the Cuban economy from 2022 to 2023 to be at $4.87 billion. A 2015 report in Al Jazeera estimated that the embargo had cost the Cuban economy $1.1 trillion in the 55 years since its inception, once inflation is taken into account. The Cuban government assessed the cost in 2018 to be around $933 billion since inception. In 2009, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimated that the embargo costs the U.S. economy $1.2 billion per year in lost sales and exports, while the Cuban government estimates that the embargo has cost the island itself $753 million annually. In 2001, the U.S. International Trade Commission found that, from 1996 and 1998, without the embargo, Cuban imports to the U.S. would be worth $658 million. In 2002, the U.S.-based, anti-embargo Cuba Policy Foundation estimated that the embargo costs the U.S. economy $3.6 billion per year in economic output. 

The U.S. government has pursued extraterritorial measures to enforce its embargo. Cuban ambassador Ricardo Alarcón cited 27 recent cases of trade contracts interrupted by U.S. pressure to the U.N. in 1991. British Petroleum was seemingly dissuaded by U.S. authorities from investing in offshore oil exploration in Cuba despite initially expressing interest. In 1992, the U.S. State Department discouraged firms like Royal Dutch Shell and Clyde Petroleum from investing in Cuba. In 1998, U.S. officials attributed Cuba&#x27;s economic penury not as a result of the embargo, but instead its unwillingness to liberalize its own economy and substantial debts owed to its Japanese, European, and Latin American trading partners.

Economic sanctions against Cuba has had disproportionate effects on its trade. According to a University of Texas at Austin undergraduate dissertation submitted to the Teresa Lozano Long Institute of Latin American Studies, between 1954 and 1959, trade between Cuba and the U.S. was at a higher level than what it was in 2003, with 65% of Cuba&#x27;s total exports sent to the U.S. while American imports totaled 74% of Cuba&#x27;s international purchases. After the formal implementation of the embargo and the passage of Proclamation 3355, there was a 95% decrease in Cuba&#x27;s sugar quota, which canceled roughly 700,000 tons of the 3,119,655 tons previously allotted to the United States. A year later, Cuba&#x27;s sugar quota was reduced to zero when President Eisenhower issued Proclamation 3383. This substantially affected Cuba&#x27;s total exports, as Cuba was one of the world&#x27;s leading sugar exporters at the time.

In 1989, with the collapse of the Soviet bloc, Cuba witnessed its most devastating economic crises. Cuba&#x27;s GDP plummeted 34% and trade between the nations apart from the Council of Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) declined by 56%. Between 1989 and 1992 (the Special Period), the termination of trade partnerships with the Soviet bloc caused the total value of Cuba&#x27;s exports to fall by 61% and imports to drop by approximately 72%. International economists believed the Cuban government would fall along with the Soviet Union but Cuba instituted a campaign of macroeconomic adjustment and liberalization instead, which provided significant economic recovery.

=== Financial impact ===
The U.S. government has implemented significant restrictions on financial activity within Cuba. The U.S. treasury holds over $6 billion worth of financial claims against the Cuban government according to the U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission. The Cuban government is required to pay cash for all food imports from the U.S., as credit is not allowed. Cuba is heavily dependent on U.S. remittances from family members and access to U.S. dollar deposits influences financial decision-making on the island. Limited access to the U.S. dollar and financial system has exacerbated wealth inequality in Cuba and forced involuntary dollarization on the island. Cuban banks are banned from operating within the United States. 

Cuba conducts international financing with many countries, including many U.S. allies; U.S.-based companies, and companies that do business with the U.S. which trade in Cuba do so at the risk of U.S. sanctions. The U.S. has threatened to stop financial aid to other countries if they trade non-food items with Cuba. The U.S.&#x27;s attempts to do so have been vocally condemned by the United Nations General Assembly as an extraterritorial measure that contravenes &quot;the sovereign equality of States, non-intervention in their internal affairs and freedom of trade and navigation as paramount to the conduct of international affairs&quot;.

===Humanitarian impacts===
The embargo has been criticized for its effects on food, clean water, medicine, and other economic needs of the Cuban population. Criticism has come from both Fidel Castro and Raúl Castro, citizens and groups from within Cuba, and international organizations and leaders. U.S. diplomat Lester D. Mallory wrote an internal memo on April 6, 1960, arguing in favor of an embargo to &quot;(make) the greatest inroads in denying money and supplies to Cuba, to decrease monetary and real wages, to bring about hunger, desperation and overthrow of government&quot;.

The embargo has been linked to shortages of medical supplies and soap which have resulted in a series of medical crises and heightened levels of infectious diseases. Medical scholars have also linked the embargo to epidemics of specific diseases, including neurological disorders and blindness caused by poor nutrition. An article written in 1997 suggests malnutrition and disease resulting from increased food and medicine prices have affected men and the elderly in particular, due to Cuba&#x27;s rationing system which gives preferential treatment to women and children. In 1997, the American Association for World Health stated that the embargo contributed to malnutrition, poor water access, lack of access to medicine and other medical supplies and concluded that &quot;a humanitarian catastrophe has been averted only because the Cuban government has maintained a high level of budgetary support for a health care system designed to deliver primary and preventative medicine to all its citizens.&quot; The AAWH found that travel restrictions embedded in the embargo have limited the amount of medical information that flows into Cuba from the United States. Since 2000, the embargo has explicitly excluded the acquisition of food and medicines.

===Political impact===
The severe effects of the U.S. embargo on the economic activity and political affairs of Cuba has led political scientists to classify the effort as a full-scale &quot;blockade&quot;. They claim that violations of the embargo are too harsh, citing the fact that violations often lead to severe sanctions. Academic Nigel White writes, &quot;While the U.S. measures against Cuba do not amount to a blockade in a technical or formal sense, their cumulative effect is to put an economic stranglehold on the island, which not only prevents the U.S. intercourse but also effectively blocks commerce with other states, their citizens and companies.&quot; Political economist Jorge Antonio stated in 2000 that the effects of the embargo on the development of Cuba are likely negligible. His research concluded: &quot;Under the real world of Castroism, however, the answer must be a terse one: none. The embargo has not harmed the Cuban economy. Cooperation between the U.S. and Cuba would have been impossible from the very beginning of the Revolution for legal, political, ideological, strategic, and economic reasons, not to mention others of a philosophical or moral character.&quot;

Former Central Bank of Cuba economist Pavel Vidal said &quot;Reforms in Cuba do not depend on the embargo, and the embargo should be eliminated unilaterally, independently from reforms in Cuba. Both cause problems&quot;. A 2009 report by Amnesty International found that the &quot;Cuban embargo has had an adverse effect on human rights&quot; and said that &quot;states must take into account the effects that [imposed] sanctions may have on the enjoyment of economic, social and cultural rights in the country affected&quot;. In Cuba, the embargo is commonly called (the blockade), especially by the government and its supporters.

=== Food and medicine ===
Since the Trade Sanction Reform and Export Enhancement Act was enacted in 2000, the trade of food and medicine goods is excluded from the embargo. Complex licensing and regulatory requirements severely limit export of medicines, medical equipment and supplies, which contain anything produced or patented by the United States, to Cuba. In 2020, $176.8 million worth of goods were exported to Cuba from the U.S. and $14.9 million imported to the U.S. from Cuba.

===Travel restrictions===

The U.S. embargo has included travel restrictions for American tourists visiting the island since 1961. The U.S. government maintains a Level II Travel Advisory Alert for the island, cautioning citizens against legally traveling through Cuba due to crime. Federal law requires persons subject to U.S. jurisdiction to obtain a license to engage in any travel-related transactions pursuant to travel to, from, and within Cuba. Transactions related solely to tourist travel are not licensable. The U.S. Treasury Department&#x27;s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) considers any visit of more than one day to be &quot;prima facie&quot; proof of violation. OFAC also holds that U.S. citizens may not receive goods or services for free from any Cuban national, eliminating any attempts to circumvent the regulation based on that premise.

Spurred by a burgeoning interest in the assumed untapped product demand in Cuba, a growing number of free-marketers in Congress, backed by Western and Great Plains lawmakers who represent agribusiness, have tried each year since 2000 to water down or lift regulations preventing Americans from traveling to Cuba. President George W. Bush threatened to veto such efforts which stalled the legislation during the 2000s.

==== Violations ====
U.S. nationals have circumvented the ban by traveling to Cuba from a different country, such as Mexico, The Bahamas, Canada, or Costa Rica. The practice opens U.S. citizens to a risk of prosecution and fines by the U.S. government if discovered. In 2006, the U.S. announced the creation of a task force that will more aggressively pursue violations of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba, with severe penalties. Criminal penalties for violating the embargo range up to ten years in prison, $1 million in corporate fines, and $250,000 in individual fines; civil penalties up to $55,000 per violation.

== Criticism ==

=== International ===

The embargo is formally opposed by multiple international organizations including: Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, among others around the world.

The Helms-Burton Act has been the target of criticism from Canadian and European governments in particular, who object to what they say is the extraterritorial pretensions of a piece of legislation aimed at punishing non-U.S. corporations and non-U.S. investors who have economic interests in Cuba. The European Council has criticized the embargo as being extraterritorial and indirectly impacting the economic growth of European countries that have ties to Cuba, recommending WTO dispute settlement.

=== Domestic ===
The embargo has also faced criticism from a select faction of international trade advocates and business leaders. Cato Institute&#x27;s Daniel Griswold called the embargo a failure, saying the economic sanctions have impoverished Cubans and &quot;deprived Americans of their freedom to travel and has cost US farmers and other producers billions of dollars of potential exports.&quot; Business leaders who have opposed the embargo include: James E. Perrella, Dwayne O. Andreas, and Peter Blyth.

It has faced criticism from a variety of U.S. political figures since inception. President Jimmy Carter called for an end to the embargo in 2002 saying the U.S. and Cuba were &quot;trapped in a destructive state of belligerence.&quot; George Shultz, who served as Secretary of State under Reagan, called the embargo &quot;insane&quot; in 2005. Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez criticized the embargo in 2009 calling it &quot;a great farce&quot; later stating that the &quot;U.S. empire [is] alive and well, threatening us.&quot; During this time U.S. President Barack Obama discussed easing the embargo during his 2008 campaign for president, though he promised to maintain it. In December 2014, he called the embargo a failure, asking Congress to enact legislation to lift it. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton publicly shared the view that the embargo helps the Castros stay in power by enabling an anti-American narrative. The Latin America Working Group argues that pro-embargo Cuban-American exiles, whose votes are crucial in the U.S. state of Florida, have swayed many politicians to adopt views similar to their own. In June 2011, George McGovern, the Democratic nominee for president in 1972, blamed &quot;embittered Cuban exiles in Miami&quot; for keeping the embargo alive.

Humanitarian opposition of the embargo has persisted since the 1970s due to the strict restrictions the embargo imposes on Cubans. Pope John Paul II called for the end to the embargo during his 1979 pastoral visit to Mexico. Patriarch Bartholomew I called the embargo a &quot;historic mistake&quot; while visiting the island in 2004. Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rev. Al Sharpton, and Minister Louis Farrakhan have also publicly opposed the embargo. The U.S. bishops called for an end to the embargo on Cuba, after Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s 2012 visit to the island.

Film director Michael Moore challenged the embargo by bringing 9/11 rescue workers in need of healthcare to Cuba to obtain subsidized health care.

Political scientist William LeoGrande summarized that, while the embargo against Cuba is &#x27;the oldest and most comprehensive U.S. economic sanctions regime against any country in the world ... [it] has never been effective at achieving its principal purpose: forcing Cuba&#x27;s revolutionary regime out of power or bending it to Washington&#x27;s will.&#x27;

=== United Nations ===
Since 1992, the UN General Assembly has passed a non-binding resolution every year, except for 2020, condemning the ongoing impact of the embargo and declaring it in violation of the Charter of the United Nations and of international law. There was no voting on this issue in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.&lt;ref name=&quot;A/71/L.3&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Israel is the only country that routinely joins the U.S. in voting against the resolution. Other countries that voted against the resolution in the past include Romania in 1992, Albania and Paraguay in 1993, Uzbekistan from 1995 to 1997, Marshall Islands from 2000 to 2007, Palau from 2004 to 2009 then once in 2012, and Brazil in 2019. 187 countries voted in favor of the resolution in 2024, with only the United States and Israel voting against it and Moldova abstaining.
==Public opinion in the U.S.==
A 2008 &quot;USA Today&quot;/Gallup Poll indicated that Americans believed that diplomatic relations &quot;should&quot; be re-established with Cuba, with 61% in favor and 31% opposed. In January 2012, an Angus Reid Public Opinion poll showed that 57% of Americans called for ending the U.S. travel ban with Cuba, with 27% disagreeing and 16% not sure.

The Cuban Research Institute at Florida International University has conducted thirteen polls (from 1991 to 2020) of Cuban Americans in Dade County, Florida. In 1991, support for the embargo was 67.9% (5.5% don&#x27;t know) shortly after the end of the Cold War, bottoming out at 31.6% (9.4% don&#x27;t know) in 2016 during the Cuban thaw, and back up to 54% (8% don&#x27;t know) in 2020 after relations with Cuba deteriorated. In 2024, the Cuban Research Institute found high levels of support for the embargo among Cuban-American voters in southern Florida, reporting that 55% of Cuban-American voters were in favor of the embargo&#x27;s continuation with 43% preferring a more humanitarian sanctions program.

<text>The Anishinaabe (alternatively spelled Anishinabe, Anicinape, Nishnaabe, Neshnabé, Anishinaabeg, Anishinabek, Aanishnaabe) are a group of culturally related Indigenous peoples in the Great Lakes region of Canada and the United States. They include the Ojibwe (including Saulteaux and Oji-Cree), Odawa, Potawatomi, Mississaugas, Nipissing, and Algonquin peoples. The Anishinaabe speak , or Anishinaabe languages that belong to the Algonquian language family.

At the time of first contact with Europeans they lived in the Northeast Woodlands and the Subarctic, and some have since spread to the Great Plains.

The word means . Another definition is , meaning those who are on the right road or path given to them by the Creator Gitche Manitou, or Great Spirit. Basil Johnston, an Ojibwe historian, linguist, and writer, wrote that the term&#x27;s literal translation is or . The Anishinaabe believe that their people were created by divine breath.

The word is often mistakenly considered a synonym of &quot;Ojibwe&quot;, but it refers to a much larger group of Nations.

==Name==

 has many different spellings. Different spelling systems may indicate vowel length or spell certain consonants differently (, ); meanwhile, variants ending in -&quot;eg/ek&quot; (, ) come from an Algonquian plural, while those ending in an -&quot;e&quot; come from an Algonquian singular.

The name is sometimes shortened to , mostly by Odawa people. The cognate comes from the Potawatomi, a people long allied with the Odawa and Ojibwe in the Council of Three Fires. The Nipissing, Mississaugas, and Algonquin are identified as Anishinaabe but are not part of the Council of Three Fires.

Closely related to the Ojibwe and speaking a language mutually intelligible with (Anishinaabe language) is the Oji-Cree (also known as &quot;Severn Ojibwe&quot;). Their most common autonym is (plural: ), and they call their language .

Among the Anishinaabe, the Ojibwe collectively call the Nipissings and the Algonquins , while those among the Nipissings who identify themselves as Algonquins call the Algonquins proper .

Not all Anishinaabemowin-speakers call themselves Anishinaabe. The Ojibwe people who migrated to what are now Canada&#x27;s prairie provinces call themselves and call their branch of the Anishinaabemowin . (The French ethnonym for the group is &quot;Saulteaux&quot;.) Particular Anishinaabe groups have different names from region to region.

==Clans==
The Anishinaabe use of the clan system represents familial, spiritual, economic and political relations between members of their communities. Often an animal is used to represent a person&#x27;s clan or but plants and other spirit beings are sometimes used as well. The word means . There are different teachings about how many clans there are and which are clans in leadership positions. This is due to the decentralized mode of governance that the Anishinaabe practice. Each person is a self-determining authority, and it is their duty to uphold their own roles and responsibilities for the wellbeing of &quot;all our relations&quot;. This is understood as the &quot;Law of Non-interference&quot;. Nobody can interfere with another being&#x27;s path unless they are causing great harm to another or themselves.

Within the Anishinaabe governance structure there are seven leader clans that each facilitate a specific role and have responsibilities within the community and to the rest of Creation. Within each grouping of clans are seven clans. This means there are a total of 49 total Anishinaabe clans.

The clan system is integral to the Anishinaabe governance structure and to the Anishinaabe way of life as well as to their spiritual practices. People of the same clan are forbidden from marrying or having intimate relations as this would spell doom for the clan as a whole.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
In Anishinaabe cultural tradition it is believed that human beings were created on the earth in four distinct places, in their own way. This is what or the Creator intended. There are many versions and parts to the Creation story that tell about the creation of the cosmos, the earth, the plants, the animals and human beings. To Anishinaabe all life contains the sacred breath of life that was given by and all things are animated through this sacred breath. The Anishinaabe give thanks for this gift of Creation through the burning or offering of tobacco ().

Anishinaabe oral tradition and records of (birch bark scrolls) are still carried on today through the society. These oral and written records contain the Anishinaabe creation stories as well as histories of migration that closely match other Indigenous groups of North America, such as the Hopi. Before the Anishinaabe became Anishinaabe the people migrated from Waubanaukee, an island of the East Coast, which may have been what is now called New England, as the great ice sheet receded at the end of the last ice age. This migrating group split in many different directions as they headed towards the land of the rising sun and became the many Indigenous populations that now exist on North America. After reaching the East Coast seven prophets came to the people. Each prophet delivered a specific prophecy to the people that are known as the seven fires prophecies. After the prophets delivered their messages, groups of people began to migrate westward to find the land where food grows on the water. The fulfilment of this prophecy is understood as when the Anishinaabe found the wild rice () or that grew on the lakes in the Great Lakes region. This is where the Anishinaabe became Anishinaabe. To the Anishinaabe, the land they encompass is still recognized as or Turtle Island.

The ethnic identities of the Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potawatomi did not develop until after the Anishinaabe reached Michilimackinac on their journey westward from the Atlantic coast. Using the scrolls, Potawatomi elder Shop-Shewana dated the formation of the Council of Three Fires to 796 AD at Michilimackinac. In this council, the Ojibwa were addressed as the &quot;Older Brother&quot;, the Odawa as the &quot;Middle Brother&quot;, and the Potawatomi as the &quot;Younger Brother&quot;. Consequently, when the three Anishinaabe nations are mentioned in this specific order: Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi, it implies the Council of Three Fires as well. Each tribe had different functions: the Ojibwa were the &quot;keepers of the faith&quot;, the Odawa the &quot;keepers of trade,&quot; and the Potawatomi are the &quot;keepers/maintainers of/for the fire&quot; (). This was the basis for their exonyms of (Ojibwe spelling) or (Potawatomi spelling)&quot;.&quot; Through the totem system (a totem is any entity which watches over or assists a group of people, such as a family, clan or tribe) and promotion of trade, the Council generally had a peaceful existence with its neighbours. However, occasional unresolved disputes erupted into wars.

The Odawa (also known as Ottawa or Outaouais) are a Native American and First Nations people. Ojibwe, Ojibwa, Chippewa (or in Eastern Ojibwe syllabics) is the third most commonly spoken Native language in Canada (after Cree and Inuktitut), and the fourth most spoken in North America behind Navajo, Cree, and Inuktitut. Potawatomi is a Central Algonquian language. It is spoken around the Great Lakes in Michigan and Wisconsin, as well as in the U.S. state of Kansas. In southern Ontario in Canada, it is spoken by fewer than 50 people. Though the Three Fires had several meeting places, they preferred &quot;Michilimackinac&quot; due to its central location. The Council met for military and political purposes, and maintained relations with other indigenous peoples, including both fellow Anishinaabe: the (Sac), (Meskwaki), (Menominee), and non-Anishinaabe: (Ho-Chunk), (Iroquois Confederacy), (Wyandot), (Sioux), (France), (Britain) and the (the United States). The Anishinaabe communities are recognized as First Nations in Canada.

=== Relations with European settlers ===
The first of the Anishinaabe to encounter European settlers were those of the Three Fires Confederation, within the states of Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, and Pennsylvania in the territory of the present-day United States, and southern Ontario and Quebec of Canada. There were many interactions between the Anishinaabe and the European settlers; the Anishinaabe dealt with Europeans through the fur trade and as allies in European-centered conflicts. Europeans traded with the Anishinaabe for their furs in exchange for goods and also hired the Anishinaabe men as guides throughout the lands of North America. The Anishinaabe women (as well as other Aboriginal groups) occasionally would intermarry with fur traders and trappers. Some of their descendants would later create a &quot;Métis&quot; ethnic group. Explorers, trappers, and other European workers married or had unions with other Anishinaabe women, and their descendants tended to form a Métis culture.

==== Relationship with the French ====

The first Europeans to encounter Native Americans in the Great Lakes region were French explorers. These men were professional canoe-paddlers (voyageurs) who transported furs and other merchandise over long distances in the lake and river system of northern America. Such explorers gave French names to many places in present-day Minnesota, Michigan and Wisconsin. French settlers in the region were primarily trappers and traders and rarely established permanent settlements due to the harsh North American climate. In 1715, French military officer Constant le Marchand de Lignery constructed Fort Michilimackinac, in part to regulate relations with nearby Anishinaabe Indians.

==== Relationship with the British ====

The Anishinaabe came into contact with British colonists in the 17th and 18th centuries as they gradually expanded into the Great Lakes region as well. Since the Iroquois had allied with the British Empire, the Anishinaabe fought numerous conflicts against them in conjunction with their French allies. During the French and Indian War, the majority of the Anishinaabe fought with France against the British and their Indian allies, though after Britain&#x27;s victory most of them sought peace with the British. However, dissatisfaction resulting from new British policies, in particular the cancellation of the annual distribution of gifts to the Indians, led to the formation of a pan-tribal confederation, composed of several Anishinaabe peoples, to counter British control of the Ohio Country. The resulting conflict, known as Pontiac&#x27;s War, resulted in a military stalemate that saw the British eventually adopting more conciliatory policies, issuing the Royal Proclamation of 1763, which forbade further white settlement across the American frontier.

After Pontiac&#x27;s War, the Anishinaabe gradually established the same relationship with the British that they had with the French. During the American Revolution, which partly resulted from opposition in the Thirteen Colonies to the 1763 proclamation, the Anishinaabe (including the Three Fires Confederation) mostly sided against the rebelling colonists. Fighting in conjunction with British and Loyalist forces, the Anishinaabe fought in the Northern and Western theaters of the American Revolutionary War. After the British defeat in the Revolutionary War, the Anishinaabe mostly sought peace with the new United States, though lingering tensions resulting from encroachment by American settlers continued to spill into frequent outbreaks of violence in the frontier.

==== Relationship with the United States ====

During the Northwest Indian War and the War of 1812, the Three Fires Confederacy fought with the British against the United States. Many Anishinaabe refugees from the Revolutionary War, particularly the Odawa and Potawatomi, migrated northwards to British North America. Those who remained east of the Mississippi River were subjected to the Indian removal policy of the United States government; among the Anishinaabe, the Potawatomi were most affected by the removals. The Odawa had been removed from the migration paths of U.S. settlers, so only a handful of communities experienced removal. For the Ojibwa, removal attempts culminated in the Sandy Lake Tragedy, which resulted several hundred deaths. The Potawatomi avoided removal only by escaping into Ojibwa-held areas and hiding from U.S. officials.

William Whipple Warren, an American man of mixed Ojibwe and European descent, became an interpreter, assistant to a trader to the Ojibwe, and legislator of the Minnesota Territory. A gifted storyteller and historian, he collected native accounts and wrote the &quot;History of the Ojibway People, Based Upon Traditions and Oral Statements&quot;, first published by the Minnesota Historical Society in 1885, some 32 years after his early death from tuberculosis. Given his Anglo-American father, Lyman Marcus Warren, and American education, the Ojibwe of the time did not consider Warren one of them. However, they retained friendly relations with him and considered him a half-brother due to his extensive knowledge of the Ojibwe language and culture and the fact that he had Ojibwe ancestry through his mixed Ojibwe-French mother, Marie Cadotte. His work covered much of the culture and history of the Ojibwe, gathered from stories of the Ojibwe Nation.

Warren identified the Crane and Loon clans as the two Chief clans among his mother&#x27;s Anishinaabe people. Crane Clan was responsible for external governmental relationships, and Loon Clan was responsible for internal governance relationships. Warren believed that the policies of the U.S. government led to the destruction of indigenous clan systems along with their modes of governance when they forced indigenous people to adopt representative government and direct elections of chiefs. Furthermore, he claimed that this destruction led to many wars among the Anishinaabe. He also cited the experiences of other indigenous nations in the U.S. (such as the Creek, Fox, and other peoples). His work was a major early work in demonstrating the significance of the clan system. After the Sandy Lake Tragedy, the U.S. government changed its policy to relocating tribes onto reservations, often by consolidating groups of communities. Conflict continued through the 19th century, as Native Americans and the United States had different goals. After the Dakota War of 1862, many Anishinaabe communities in Minnesota were relocated and further consolidated.

=== Relations with their neighbours ===
==== Other indigenous groups ====
There are many Anishinaabe reserves and reservations; in some places, the Anishinaabe share some of their lands with others, such as the Cree, the Dakota, the Delaware, and the Kickapoo, among others. The Anishnabe who &quot;merged&quot; with the Kickapoo tribe may now identify as being Kickapoo in Kansas and Oklahoma. The Prairie Potawatomi were the Ojibwe, Odawa, and Potawatomi of Illinois and Wisconsin who were relocated to Kansas during the 19th century.

The Anishinaabe of Manitoba, particularly those along the east side of Lake Winnipeg, have had longstanding historical conflicts with the Cree people.

==== Canada ====
In addition to other issues shared by First Nations recognized by the Canadian government and other aboriginal peoples in Canada, the Anishinaabe of Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec have opposed the Energy East pipeline of TransCanada. The Chippewas of the Thames First Nation legally challenged the right of the Canadian government to hold a pipeline hearing without their consent. The project was also the basis of a June 2015 declaration of reclaimed sovereignty over the Ottawa River valley by several Anishinaabe peoples.

==== United States ====

The relationship between the various Anishinaabe communities and the United States government has been steadily improving since the passage of the 1934 Indian Reorganization Act. Several Anishinaabe communities still experience tensions with the state governments, county governments, and non-Native American individuals and their groups.

Clan originally meant extended family. In this system originally, clans were represented by a changing cast of spokespeople at yearly meetings. In more recent times, clans have come to align personality characteristics with the animals that represent them. This shifts the focus from extended family governance to groups of people who have a particular kind of strength to offer to the community. For example, the Deer Clan is sometimes understood as having the direction of hospitality toward visitors, whereas the Crane Clan or Eagle Clan, depending on region, may be aligned with leadership qualities. Conversations surrounding how to change current systems of governance to better match how the people governed themselves over millennia are always occurring throughout .

== Culture ==
=== Teachings of the Seven Grandfathers ===

The Teachings of the Seven Grandfathers are among the most commonly shared teachings in Native culture. They hold great significance to the Anishinaabe and are considered to be the founding principles of their way of life. The Seven Grandfather teachings have been around for centuries, passed on from elders through storytelling. These teachings have helped shape the way of life for the Anishinaabe for years and continue to do so. The stories can be adapted to fit specific community values and have been incorporated by organizations, schools, different programs, artists, individualists, and tribes.

==== : Wisdom () ====
According to Anishinaabe culture, to cherish knowledge is to know wisdom. Wisdom is given by the Creator to be used for the good of the people. In Anishinaabemowin, this word expresses not only but also means . In some communities, is used; in addition to , this word can also mean or .

==== : Love () ====
According to Anishinaabe culture, to know peace is to know love. Love must be unconditional. When people are weak they need love the most. In Anishinaabemowin, this word with the reciprocal theme indicates that this form of love is mutual. In some communities, is used, which in most context means but in this context is translated as either or .

==== : Respect () ====
According to Anishinaabe culture, to honor all creation is to have respect. All of creation should be treated with respect. If an individual wants to be respected, they must also show respect. Some communities instead use or .

==== : Bravery () ====
According to Anishinaabe culture, to be brave is to face the foe with integrity. In Anishinaabemowin, the word literally means : to do what is right even when the consequences are unpleasant. Some communities instead use either () or ().

==== : Honesty (/) ====
According to Anishinaabe culture, honesty in facing a situation is to be brave. Individuals should always be honest in word and action. If an individual is honest with themselves first, they will more easily be able to be honest with others. In Anishinaabemowin, the word can also mean .

==== : Humility () ====
According to Anishinaabe culture, humility requires recognizing oneself as a sacred part of Creation, neither better nor worse than any other creation. In Anishinaabemowin, the word can also mean . Some communities instead express this with , which in addition to can also be translated as .

==== : Truth () ====
According to Anishinaabe culture, truth is knowing all of these things. Individuals should speak the truth and not deceive themselves or others.

=== Storytelling ===

The Anishinaabe follow an oral storytelling tradition. Storytelling serves as an integral part of Anishinaabe culture as &quot;stories teach the stock of wisdom and knowledge found in the culture&quot; and &quot;promotes &#x27;respectful individualism,&quot; wherein individuals do not force their thinking upon others. Instead of directly teaching right and wrong, the Anishinaabe often use storytelling to share their history and cultural truths, including but not limited to the Teachings of the Seven Grandfathers. Stories often &quot;provide important lessons for living and give life purpose, value, and meaning.&quot; They can further &quot;include religious teachings, metaphysical links, cultural insights, history, linguistic structures, literary and aesthetic form, and Indigenous &#x27;truths&#x27;.&quot; By understanding traditional stories, individuals can better understand themselves, their world, where they came from, and where they are going.

Storytelling is situational, meaning that storytellers must be mindful of audience, of listener, and [should] keep the oration accessible and real.&quot; When a story is shared, &quot;[t]he teller and the listener are equally activie; the listener is not passive.&quot; Furthermore, stories told are not static: &quot;Once they become public, people will play will them, embellish them, and add to them ... There is no need for any particular story to have any particular form. Nor is it the case that any one story can ever be said to have achieved its final form. Instead, all stories are works in progress.&quot;

Before telling a story, Elders &quot;very often begin by quoting the authority of Elders who have gone before. They do not state the authority as coming from themselves. They will say things like, &#x27;This is what they used to say,&#x27; or &#x27;This is what they said.&#x27;&quot;

Beyond sharing cultural knowledge, storytelling traditions can help provide Anishinaabe children &quot;with the intellectual tools necessary to exercise authority.&quot; The Anishinaabe see the act of allowing children to share stories as &quot;an act of empowerment.&quot; This action &quot;recognizes that even children have something to contribute, and encourages them to do so.&quot;

Stories are typically shared throughout the winter when there is less to do and the animals are sleeping.

==== Trickster ====

The Trickster is a common character in Anishinaabe storytelling and goes by many names, including Coyote, Raven, Wesakejac, Nanabozho, and Glooscap. They appear in many forms and genders. Stories involving the Trickster &quot;often use humour, self-mocking, and absurdity to carry good lessons.&quot;

The Trickster helps teach cultural lessons by &quot;learning lessons the &#x27;hard&#x27; way.&quot; Within such stories, &quot;Trickster often gets into trouble by ignoring cultural rules and practices or by giving sway to the negative aspects of &#x27;humanness&#x27; ... Trickster seems to learn lessons the hard way and sometimes not at all.&quot; Contrary to some depictions of Trickster figures, the Trickster in Anishinaabe stories &quot;has the ability to do good things for others and is sometimes like a powerful spiritual being and [is] given much respect.&quot; Stories involving the Trickster serve to &quot;remind us about the good power of interconnectedness within family, community, nation, culture, and land. If we become disconnected, we lose the ability to make meaning from Indigenous stories.&quot;

=== Before the 1800s ===
Before the arrival of the Europeans, and until at least the 1800s, many Anishinaabe were subsistence farmers. For example, the Odawa, centered in Michilimackinac, grew corn in the summers and generally moved south in smaller family groups in the winters to hunt game. They tapped sugar maples in the spring, and moved back to the main villages to prepare for the lake sturgeon spawning season and planting.

They were &quot;renowned&quot; for their skills at making and using canoes and traded widely.

Their kinship was patrilineal and most Anishinaabe doodemag enforced exogamy, the wife keeping and representing her father&#x27;s doodem while her children would take on their father&#x27;s doodem. For the first few years of a marriage, a husband would live with his wife&#x27;s family, and then they would typically return to the husband&#x27;s people. As a result, many Anishinaabe villages included people speaking different languages not only from different clans, but also from entirely different peoples, such as the Huron and even occasionally Sioux.

===Symbols and flags===
The thunderbird is a common symbol used to represent the Anishinaabe. In the 1970s, Nicholas R. Deleary of Chippewas of the Thames created a logo for what was then the Union of Ontario Indians. This logo features a black thunderbird in profile with an X-shaped body, in a circle. The Union of Ontario Indians later became the Anishinabek Nation. A variant of the logo using a red background was officially adopted in 1980. Both the white background and red background designs have been used as pan-Anishinaabe flags.

Different Anishinaabe political organizations have their own specific flags and emblems. For example, the Menominee use a red thunderbird with a different styling for their great seal, whereas the Ho-Chunk flag depicts a thunderbird like a brown eagle.

==Education==
In June 1994, the Chiefs at the Anishinabek Grand Council gathering at Rocky Bay First Nation, directed that the Education Directorate formally establish the Anishinabek Education Institute (AEI) in accordance with the post-secondary education model that was submitted and ratified with provisions for satellite campuses and a community-based delivery system. (Res. 94/13)

In August 2017 the Anishinabek Nation in Ontario and the government of Canada signed an agreement allowing the Anishinabek Nation to control the classroom curriculum and school resources of its kindergarten-to-grade-12 education system in 23 communities.

Approximately 8% of Anishinabek students attend schools on-reserve.

<text>The National Stadium, locally also referred to as Ta&#x27; Qali, officially known as Grawnd Nazzjonali (Maltese for &quot;National Stadium&quot;), is a stadium located in Ta&#x27; Qali, Malta. The stadium, which also contains the headquarters of the Malta Football Association, seats 16,997 people and is, by far, the largest stadium in the country. It serves as the national football stadium of Malta and is the home stadium of the Malta national football team. The stadium, together with three other stadiums, also hosts the Maltese Premier League.

== History ==

=== Background and early years ===
Although officially the new stadium was inaugurated on 6 December 1981 with a Maltese Premier League encounter between Zurrieq F.C. and Senglea Athletic F.C., certain records suggest that the stadium was already up and running by May 1981. Indeed, newspapers extracts indicate that the stadium hosted the final of the first ever national championship organised by the now defunct Malta Football Federation (not to be confused with the Malta Football Association, which at that time was known as the Main Football Association) between Valletta Vanguards FC and Birkirkara St. Joseph Sports Club on 3 May 1981.

The highest ever attendance at the stadium was during a 1986 World Cup Qualifier encounter between Malta and West Germany played on 16 December 1984, when 35,102 people turned up to watch Malta narrowly lose to the runners-up of the previous World Cup.

=== The Millennium Stand ===
On 3 September 2002, the Malta Football Association inaugurated the Millennium Stand. The Millennium Stand replaced the 5,000 seater East Stand, which had been declared as a dangerous structure for a number of years by then and hence had to be demolished. The construction of the Millennium Stand, which cost Lm3.5 million, was regarded as the &quot;biggest infrastructural project ever undertaken by the Malta Football Association&quot; whereas the stand itself has been described as &quot;the jewel in the Malta FA&#x27;s crown&quot;.

=== Pitch Resurfacing ===
In 2016, the Maltese Football Association announced a €1.5 million project to replace the old grass surface with a modern hybrid grass surface, with the latter having been in service for 35 years. The project was conducted by SIS Pitches who are renowned for other works such as the Vodafone Arena and iPro Stadium. The expenses were partly financed by UEFA and FIFA, with the rest being covered by the MFA.

=== Future ===

In July 2017, during the annual general meeting, the Malta Football Association announced five projects were announced by the association. Two of these projects, which also include the construction of new futsal hall and a parking adjacent to the Enclosure (West Stand), entail the re-development of the North and South Stands. A short clip shared by the association on its Facebook page suggests that the space behind both the goals will be removed and the two stands will be moved closer to the pitch. The re-development also entails removal of the corners, making stadium an &quot;English-style&quot; venue.

== Events ==

=== UEFA European Under-17 Championship ===

The National Stadium was Malta&#x27;s main venue during its hosting of the 2014 UEFA European Under-17 Championship. The stadium hosted 7 matches in all, including the opening ceremony, 3 group stage games, the semi-finals and the final. 9,422 people turned up to watch England win the championship by beating the Netherlands on penalties.

=== Games of the Small States of Europe ===

The Xth edition of the Games of the Small States of Europe was held in Malta and the National Stadium was chosen to hold the Opening Ceremony. The Opening Ceremony was spectacular as colour, dance and fireworks made the evening a memorable one for those present at the stadium.

<doc id="1105976" wikidata="Q972918" url="?curid=1105976" title="Punk (magazine)">
<text>Punk was a music magazine and fanzine created by cartoonist John Holmstrom, publisher Ged Dunn, and &quot;resident punk&quot; Legs McNeil in 1975. Its use of the term &quot;punk rock&quot;, coined by writers for &quot;Creem&quot; magazine a few years earlier to describe the simplistic and crude style of &#x27;60s garage rock bands, further popularized the term. The founders were influenced by their affection for comic books and the music of The Stooges, the New York Dolls, and The Dictators. Holmstrom later called it &quot;the print version of The Ramones&quot;. It was also the first publication to popularize the CBGB scene.

&quot;Punk&quot; published 15 issues between 1976 and 1979, as well as a special issue in 1981 (&quot;The D.O.A. Filmbook&quot;), a 25th anniversary special in 2001 and 3 final issues in 2007.

&quot;Punk&quot; was a vehicle for examining the underground music scene in New York, and primarily for punk rock as found in clubs like CBGB, Zeppz, and Max&#x27;s Kansas City. It mixed &quot;Mad Magazine&quot;-style cartooning by Holmstrom, Bobby London and a young Peter Bagge with the more straightforward pop journalism of the kind found in &quot;Creem&quot;. It also provided an outlet for female writers, artists and photographers who had been shut out of a male-dominated underground publishing scene.

&quot;Punk&quot; magazine was home to (many of whom were being published for the first time) writers Mary Harron, Steve Taylor, Lester Bangs, Pam Brown, artists Buz Vaultz, Anya Phillips, and Screaming Mad George, and photographers Bob Gruen, Barak Berkowitz, Roberta Bayley and David Godlis. After Dunn left in early 1977 and McNeil quit shortly afterwards, Bruce Carleton (art director, 1977–1979), Ken Weiner (contributor, 1977–79), and Elin Wilder, one of few African Americans involved in the early CBGB/punk rock scene, were added to the staff.

Between April 1976 and June 1979, Chris Stein of Blondie was a contributing photographer. Consequently, the band were regularly featured and Debbie Harry would frequently appear as one of the characters in the photo-stories.

<text>Electrical wiring in the United Kingdom is commonly understood to be an electrical installation for operation by end users within domestic, commercial, industrial, and other buildings, and also in special installations and locations, such as marinas or caravan parks. It does not normally cover the transmission or distribution of electricity to them.

Installations are distinguished by a number of criteria, such as voltage (high, low, extra low), phase (single or three-phase), nature of electrical signal (power, data), type and design of cable (conductors and insulators used, cable design, solid/fixed or stranded/flexible, intended use, protective materials), circuit design (ring, radial), and so on.

Electrical wiring is ultimately regulated to ensure safety of operation, by such as the building regulations, currently legislated as the Building Regulations 2010, which lists &quot;controlled services&quot; such as electric wiring that must follow specific directions and standards, and the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989. The detailed rules for end-use wiring followed for practical purposes are those of BS 7671 &quot;Requirements for Electrical Installations. (IET Wiring Regulations&quot;), currently in its 18th edition, which provide the detailed descriptions referred to by legislation.

UK electrical wiring standards are largely harmonised with the regulations in other European countries and the international IEC 60446 standard. However, there are a number of specific national practices, habits and traditions that differ significantly from other countries, and which in some cases survived harmonisation. These include the use of ring circuits for domestic and light commercial fixed wiring, fused plugs, and for circuits installed prior to harmonisation, historically unique wiring colours.

==Common terminology==
=== Regulatory ===
;BS 7671 &quot;Requirements for Electrical Installations. IET Wiring Regulations&quot; (&quot;the regs&quot;, or &quot;wiring regs&quot;): These are detailed rules for the design, installation and sign-off for end-user electrical installations. Compliance with BS 7671 is not mandatory, but official guidance states following BS 7671 is one way to demonstrate compliance with the building regulations.
;xxth edition: Reference to a specific edition of the BS 7671 regulations.
;Building regulations - &quot;Part P&quot;: Section of the Building Regulations for England and Wales addressing electrical wiring and safety in residential situations and outbuildings.
;Local authority building control (LABC; &quot;building control&quot;): Local council department responsible for overseeing and administering building regulations.
;Competent person scheme: Private organizations authorised by the state to supervise, accredit, and control the registration of installers, who, as members of this scheme, may self-certify that any domestic work classed as &quot;notifiable&quot; to a LABC that they have undertaken, is compliant with building regulations, thus avoiding inspection by LABC (or by a member of the &quot;third-party certifier&quot; scheme).
;Minor electrical installation works certificate (MEIWC): Formal certificate for confirming that minor work items, such as the addition of a new socket or light to an existing circuit, have been designed, constructed, inspected and tested in accordance with BS 7671.
;Electrical installation certificate (EIC): Formal certificate for confirming that a major piece of work, such as a completely new installation; complete rewire; addition of a whole new circuit; or replacement of a consumer unit, has been designed, constructed, inspected and tested in accordance with BS 7671.
;Electrical installation condition report (EICR, ICR); previously the periodic inspection report (PIR): Formal report of the condition of an existing wiring installation.
;Permit to work:Formal confirmation that electrical wiring is isolated and fully made safe, prior to working on it, required prior to any high voltage works and other high risk activities.
;Skilled Person (electrically); (formally &quot;Competent Person&quot;): Defined by BS 7671 as &quot;Person who possesses, as appropriate to the nature of the electrical work to be undertaken, adequate education, training and practical skills, and who is able to perceive risks and avoid hazards which electricity can create&quot;. The Electricity at Work Regulations requires persons to be competent to prevent danger and injury.

=== Distribution within premises ===
;Consumer unit, consumer control unit, or consumer distribution unit (CU, CDU, CCU; historically and commonly, &quot;fuse board/box&quot;): Distribution board designed for ordinary low voltage single phase premises, primarily domestic and light commercial wiring. 3-phase power distribution boards are usually known as &quot;distribution boards&quot;.
;Distribution board (DB): Panel that splits power from one main source into separate circuits, each with independent protection.

=== Breakers and safety devices ===
;Fuse: An overcurrent protection device. Prior to the invention of the resettable circuit breaker, distribution boards (then called &quot;fuseboxes&quot;) held fuses to protect individual circuits. The fuses used in fuseboxes were either of the cartridge type, similar to those found in UK plugs, or replaceable fuse-wire held within two-prong enclosures. Other standard use of fuses include those within appliance plugs, and the &quot;main fuse&quot; located on the end of the service (&quot;supply&quot;) cable (at the &quot;service head&quot;).
;Breaker (circuit breaker, CB): Any fixed device that breaks a circuit (that is, while it is drawing current) upon fault condition detection. Unlike a fuse, a circuit breaker can be reset by flipping a switch.
;Miniature circuit breaker (MCB): An overcurrent protection circuit breaker. These have standardised current ratings and tripping characteristics, and can be installed in close proximity in consumer units and distribution boards.
;Residual-current device (RCD), also residual current circuit breaker (RCCB): A circuit breaker triggered by unequal currents in and neutral wires (i.e., electrical power is passing to earth). Mandatory for most circuits as of 17th Edition regulations.
;Residual current circuit breaker with overcurrent protection (RCBO): Combination of RCD and MCB; breaks circuit on being triggered either as an RCD or by overcurrent.
;Surge protection device (SPD): A transient overcurrent or overvoltage protection device; safely diverts away very short-lived spikes of current or voltage. Type 1 devices provide protection from direct lightning strikes to vulnerable structures (those having a conductive structure, a lightning rod, or an overhead power supply). These should always be used in combination with type 2. Type 2 devices protect against indirect strikes. Type 3 devices are supplementary to type 2, installed near sensitive equipment.
;Arc fault detection device (AFDD): A circuit breaker triggered by detection of an electric arc; breaks circuit on detecting an electric arc, which could develop from the likes of loose wires.
;Earth leakage circuit breaker (ELCB): An obsolete circuit breaker triggered by voltage on the earth wiring. This was a precursor to the RCD, with disadvantages of covering fewer fault scenarios, and potentially not working at all in the presence of parallel earth paths (e.g. bonding of gas/water pipes).
;Isolator switch (or &quot;isolator&quot;): Used for isolating a device from its power supply for maintenance or safety reasons. These are commonly being fitted in recent years, alongside fitting of new electricity meters, for the benefit of enabling electricians to replace consumer units without the hassle of arranging for the DNO to temporarily isolate the supply by removing the supply&#x27;s main fuse (or taking on the potential danger and legal risks of doing so themself). There is a very important difference to be aware of between a device categorised as a &quot;switch&quot; vs. an &quot;isolator&quot;, and these devices may commonly be referred to as &quot;isolator/isolation switches&quot; when they may not actually be rated as anything more than isolators. A &quot;switch&quot; is a device capable of safely disconnecting the supply even if devices in the installation were drawing the full maximum load the installation was rated for. An &quot;isolator&quot; is not, it should only be used when the installation is drawing no power, i.e. the main switch in the consumer unit is off. When a supply is switched off under load, some degree of electrical arcing takes place across the contacts. A &quot;switch&quot; is designed to safely handle this. An &quot;isolator&quot; is not and could become weakened or instantly fail in a dangerous way, depending upon the size of the load. Utilising an &quot;isolator&quot; incorrectly as a &quot;switch&quot; is thus a significant hazard and this danger may well be unintuitive for many.

=== Wires and cables (conductors) ===
;Live: A power-carrying conductor. This term is commonly used incorrectly by the general public in place of &quot;&quot;, owing to changes to standard definitions since the 1960s. By definition it applies to any conductor that is intended to be energised during normal use, including a neutral conductor, but not by convention a PEN conductor. I.e and neutral are conductors, but earth is not.
; (L; or phase line) : A power-carrying conductor in a typical low-voltage or domestic installation. Colour-coded brown (pre-2004: red).
;Neutral (N) : A power-carrying conductor in a typical low-voltage or domestic installation, usually bonded to Earth (ground) voltage by the supplier. Colour-coded blue (pre-2004: black).
;Earth (E; or protective earth (PE), or circuit protective conductor (CPC)) : A conductor that provides a connection to Earth for safety and protection purposes, for both end-user devices and metal objects and components in the installation. Colour-coded green/yellow striped, though may be bare (uninsulated) within sheathed cable (pre-1976: solid green).
;Conduit: A form of wire containment comprising plastic or metal tubing. Access points for maintenance and inspection are required at certain intervals of length.
;Trunking: An alternative form of containment to conduit, comprising U-shaped plastic or metal with a removable lid.
;Meter tails (or, &quot;tails&quot;): The single-core cables connected to the electricity meter. On the supply side these connect the meter to the and neutral conductors of the supply cable, via the service head (or &quot;cut out&quot;) located on the end of the supply cable. On the consumer side these conductors are then joined to the distribution board, possibly through an isolator (as is becoming more common).
;Singles: A cable consisting of a single conductor.
;Multi-core: A cable consisting of two or more conductors (not counting any earth conductor).
;Twin and earth (&quot;T&amp;E&quot;): A commonly used type of multi-core cable, characterised by its flat profile and grey-coloured polyvinyl chloride sheath. It contains three conductors, two of which are insulated ( and neutral), and it is from this that the name &quot;twin and earth&quot; derives.
;Steel-wire armoured (SWA): Steel wire protected cable, mandatory for outdoor or buried use unless equivalent protection is provided via containment.
;Flex: Refers to the &quot;flexible&quot; cord of a portable appliance.

=== Voltage and phases ===
;High voltage: Any voltage in excess of &quot;low voltage&quot;. This is usually found only in industrial processes and electricity transmission and distribution networks.
;Low voltage: Exceeding extra-low voltage, but not exceeding 1000 volts AC RMS or 1500 volts DC between conductors, and not exceeding 600 volts AC RMS or 900 volts DC between conductors and Earth.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all domestic; light commercial (e.g., offices) and industrial (for three-phase machinery) power is low voltage for regulation purposes.
;Extra-low voltage (ELV): Not exceeding 50 volts AC RMS or 120 volts ripple-free DC.
;Separated extra-low voltage (SELV): Extra-low voltage system that is also electrically isolated.
;Single phase, three phase: At low voltage electricity may be supplied by the distributor (DNO) as either single or three phase. A single phase supply will comprise a single conductor and a neutral conductor. A three phase supply will comprise three conductors each pair with a phase separation of 120 degrees and (optionally) a neutral conductor. A separate earth conductor will normally be supplied in both cases but may not be present depending on the connection type.

=== Earthing (bonding) ===
;Bonding (including main bonding, supplementary bonding and equipotential bonding): Connection made to Earth, for protective purposes, either for individual components, for other metal objects in the premises (such as gas, water, or oil piping), or for the installation (or some part of it) as a whole.
;Earth/ground rod: A long rod placed into the ground, bonding, with low impedance, the installation to Earth potential. Usually made from copper-clad, galvanised or stainless steel or copper, for corrosion prevention. There are other types of Earth bonding, such as: an Earth plate, an Earth mesh, or an Earth ring.

=== Circuit terminology ===
;Accessory: A switch, socket, ceiling rose, etc., forming part of an electrical installation.
;Load: Something that requires and consumes electricity to function, e.g. a lightbulb, appliance, etc.
;Circuit: A set of electrical wires and connections, forming part of an installation, between a distribution board and a fixed load, or between a distribution board and an accessory or daisy-chained set of accessories for connecting loads (sockets or light fittings), or between two distribution boards, enabling power to be provided. I.e. a final circuit or distribution circuit.
;Distribution circuit: A circuit whereby one distribution board supplies power to another (via a protective device like a breaker).
;Final circuit: A circuit providing power to a set of sockets, light fittings, or fixed equipment, from a single protective device (breaker) in a distribution board. (Not applicable to RCDs in a &quot;split way&quot; configuration which each sit behind a set of MCBs - each MCB would serve an individual final circuit in such a setup). Each final circuit will be arranged in a &quot;radial&quot; or &quot;ring final&quot; form if not simply serving a single fixed appliance. It may also have one or more &quot;fused&quot; or &quot;unfused&quot; &quot;spurs&quot; attached. The use of the word &quot;final&quot; comes from the fact that these circuits are the last piece of the power distribution infrastructure, finally delivering generated power to where it will be consumed.
;Radial: A circuit where the conductors providing the power circuit (and earthing) are simply connected from one accessory (e.g. socket) to the next in a daisy-chain like fashion. You might think of this as the supplied power radiating out from the source to reach each accessory.
;Ring (or &quot;ring final&quot;): A &quot;ring final&quot; circuit is similar to a radial except what would be the end of the circuit instead loops back to the source protective device in the distribution board. Thus each individual conductor, , neutral and earth, actually forms a loop (or &quot;ring&quot;), from the source, out, and back around to the source again. This has long been a standard means for wiring domestic and other light commercial premises in the UK, but is not often seen elsewhere in the world. It allows power between source and accessories to be split between two parallel paths. On the downside though it&#x27;s more difficult to test, and should a break in a connection occur it could go unnoticed leading to one side of the ring potentially taking on an excessive amount of current flow, and increased earth fault loop impedance increasing disconnection times.
;&quot;Loop&quot;: This term applies to radial lighting circuits where junctions are made at ceiling roses with and switched wires. Not to be confused with the loop-like arrangement of a &quot;ring final&quot; circuit.
;(Unfused) spur: A branch off of a final circuit supplying a single accessory, especially from a ring final circuit.
;Fused spur: A spur branched off of a final circuit via a connection protected by a suitable fuse, and thus one that may connect to more than one accessory.
;A de-energized circuit: A circuit that is isolated from power and not at a potential different from Earth, and thus safe to work on.

==Wiring colours==

===Conductor colours===
The standard wiring colours in the UK are () the same as elsewhere in Europe and follow international standard IEC 60446. This colour scheme had already been introduced for appliance flexes in the UK in the early 1970s, however the original red/black colour scheme recommended by the IEE for fixed wiring was retained until 2006, albeit with change to a green/yellow striped earth in 1976. As a result, the international standard blue/brown scheme is as of 2006 found in most appliance flexes. In fixed wiring, the blue/brown scheme is only found in newer (post-2004) installations, and the old IEE red/black scheme is likely to be encountered in existing installations for many more decades.

Earlier in the 20th century, green and blue were used as a neutral alongside black, which became the only neutral colour from 1943. In the 13th edition of the regulations, published in 1955 (and known then as the IEE regulations), black was used for both neutral and earth, although only for fixed wiring. It was changed to green in the 14th edition in 1966 and then a phased change to green/yellow in amendments to the 14th edition over the following decade.

An amendment to the 18th edition changed &quot;functional earth&quot; from cream to pink, which came into effect in September 2020.

The standard colours in fixed wiring were harmonised in 2004 with the regulations in other European countries and the international IEC 60446 standard. For a transitional period (April 2004 – March 2006) either set of colours were allowed (but not both), provided that any changes in the colour scheme were clearly labelled. From April 2006, only the new colours should be used for any new wiring.

====Potential for confusion====
The UK changed colour codes three decades after most other European countries, as in 1977 the change of neutral and phase colours was not considered safe by the IEE. Blue, previously used as a phase colour, is now the colour for neutral. Black, which was previously used for neutral, now indicates a phase.

Household wiring does not usually use three-phase supplies and the clash only occurs in three-phase systems. Wiring to the old standard can be detected by use of a red wire. The new standard colour code does not use red. Where new wiring is mixed with old, cables must be clearly marked to prevent interchange of phase and neutral.

Variation in the earth/ground conductor&#x27;s colour at an earlier date than the remainder of the colours means its colour should &quot;not&quot; be used as an indication of the old vs new standard cable or colour assignment.

====Other colour schemes====
On telecommunications nominal 48 V DC supplies, the live is usually −42 V (flat batteries) to almost −57 V (float charge).

The IEC currently specifies a colour-coding for new local DC distribution. These are:

There is a long history of colour changes; prior to 1964 white was used instead of yellow as the second phase, and before World War II, a black earth and a green third phase in place of green earth and white phase was permitted. The regulations permitted (and still do) the use of any wire colour that is not an earth colour, providing it is unambiguously identified at all connections by clear labelling or by correctly coloured over-sleeving. It was not uncommon on commercial builds of the 1960s with a three phase supply for the phase colours (red, yellow, blue) to be used throughout single phase sub circuits thus indicating the phase origin of the supply, in this case no over-sleeving was used and can give rise to confusion when encountered today.

Direct current mains supplies are only of historical interest in the UK but the colour coding was red for live and black for earthed (regardless of the polarity). Hardly any loads were polarity sensitive when direct current systems were introduced (principally incandescent lighting, heating systems or series direct current motors) and it was considered more important to identify the live wire than the polarity. In later years of direct current supplies, however, much more equipment became sensitive to polarity, such as many domestic radios &amp; television sets. Where all three wires were available, the historical colour code was red (positive), black (middle) and white (negative). The negative line changed to yellow in 1964, and then to blue in 1966.

=== Outer sheath colours ===

The colour of the outer sheath is currently grey, or white for low halogen material. Previously cables from different manufacturers were available variously in grey or white, with no significance attached to the sheath colour. The grey colour was adopted by cable manufacturers to match older lead or silver sheathed flat cables, with some manufacturers using a silver grey polyvinyl chloride. Additionally twin &amp; earth cable was available in red for fire alarms until the early 2000s.

==Circuit design==

UK fixed wiring circuits, unlike those found in almost all other countries, make widespread use of ring circuit designs, as well as radial circuit designs often seen in other countries. (This was one of the recommendations of the Electrical Installations Committee, convened in 1942 as part of the Post War Building Studies programme, which in 1944 determined that the ring final circuit offered a more efficient and lower cost method to support a greater number of sockets.) It continues to be the usual wiring method for domestic and light commercial socket and device wiring in the UK. Lighting circuits, which typically have lower power requirements, are usually radially wired, confusingly sometimes called &quot;loop&quot; wiring.

In both ring and radial circuits, the circuit wiring starts at a consumer unit or distribution board, and traverses in turn a number of sockets or devices (point-to-point style), before terminating. The difference is that a radial circuit simply ends upon reaching the last connected device in any branch, whereas in a ring circuit the termination is made by joining the end of the circuit from the last device back to its starting point. A ring circuit therefore forms a continuous ring, while a radial may be a simple linear chain, though it may split and have several branches. This means that in a ring there are two independent paths from the supply to every device. Ideally, the ring acts like two radial circuits proceeding in opposite directions around the ring, the dividing point between them dependent on the distribution of load in the ring. If the load is evenly split across the two directions, the current in each direction is half of the total, allowing the use of wire with half the current-carrying capacity. In practice, it is impossible to ensure the load does split evenly, so regulations require a thicker wire, of at least 2/3 the current capacity of the fuse or circuit breaker.

The innovation that made ring circuits feasible in the UK was the introduction of plugs that contained their own fuse. There were three competing designs but only one ultimately survived and became the version specified in British Standard 1363. BS1363 plugs, could historically be fitted with a range of fuses up to 13A though only the 3A and 13A are the official choices, though 5A are available and often fitted to small appliances that take a large inrush current. This means that every load plugged in is covered by an appropriate protective device in its plug, so that the whole ring may then be protected by (usually) a 32A breaker at the distribution panel. In contrast, circuits feeding any other kind of socket outlet need to be protected by a breaker that will not allow the socket&#x27;s rating to be exceeded, and so the radial circuits generally used with outlets such as the European Schuko style outlets generally have to be protected by a 16A breaker at the distribution panel; this limits the total load on the circuit and hence such circuits tend to have fewer socket outlets.

Cables are most commonly a single outer sheath containing separately-insulated and neutral wires, and a non-insulated protective earth to which sleeving is added when exposed. Such cable is commonly referred to as twin and earth or simply &quot;T&amp;E&quot;. Standard sizes have a conductor cross sectional area of 1, 1.5, 2.5, 4, 6 and 10 mm2. With most domestic wiring using:
The earthing conductor is uninsulated since it is not intended to have any voltage difference from surrounding earthed articles. Additionally, if the insulation of a or neutral wire becomes damaged, then the wire is more likely to earth itself on the bare earth conductor and in doing so either trip the circuit breaker, RCD, or rupture the fuse by drawing too much current.

==Earthing and bonding==

Earthing and bonding are used together to provide shock protection by avoiding a dangerous combination of magnitude and duration of the voltage to which people may be exposed in the event of a fault within the installation or outside the installation. (Exposure may be from e.g. hand to hand or hand to foot, between simultaneously accessible conductive surfaces, which might include the Earth itself, mildly conductive floors and walls, metal taps, pipes, electrical appliances etc. 
Examples of faults are an insulation failure between a conductor and a metallic frame of an appliance within the installation, a break in a combined protective-earth and neutral conductor in the supply, or an insulation fault in the supply transformer causing the whole low-voltage system to rise in potential.) Conductors for these protective functions of earthing and bonding are insulated with green/yellow (striped) colour coding, which is not permitted for any other conductors.

Earthing connects exposed conductive parts of electrical equipment to a main earthing terminal (MET), which is connected to a &quot;means of earthing&quot; that somehow connects it to the Earth itself (the ground/soil/planet!). In installations fed from low-voltage public supplies in the UK this means of earthing can be any of the methods TN-S, TN-C-S or TT defined in BS 7671. In the event of an insulation fault from a live conductor to an appliance&#x27;s metal frame (an exposed conductive part), the frame could—if not so connected—be dangerous if touched by someone who is also for example standing outside on the ground, or standing inside on a concrete floor, or holding a tap whose pipe connects it electrically into the ground. Protective earthing limits the combination of magnitude and duration of the dangerous voltage that could exist between the exposed conductive part and the Earth itself. In conventional installations in the UK the voltage between an appliance frame and the Earth itself during a zero-impedance fault has a dangerous magnitude: it might be reduced to about half of the 230 V -earth voltage, which is well above the 50 V usually accepted as safe for an AC system, or it might be nearly 230 V in a TT system with a poor earth electrode for the installation. The duration of this voltage must therefore be limited, which is done by &quot;automatic disconnection of supply&quot; (ADS) either by overcurrent protection devices (OCPDs), or by residual current devices (RCDs) that specifically detect the current escaping from the intended circuit, allowing them to have a far lower tripping current. In TT systems it is almost always necessary to have an RCD, as earth electrodes usually have many times higher resistance than a typical supply cable, so earth-fault currents are relatively low. In the TN-S or TN-C-S systems none of the &quot;earth fault&quot; current necessarily passes through the Earth itself, as there is a metallic circuit for the entire earth-fault loop: adequate ADS times may often be achieved by normal OCPDs. However, the connection to the Earth itself is always relevant, since the Earth forms a mildly conductive surface that we cannot easily avoid (e.g. a person standing on the ground and touching a metal appliance or tap or building-framework that is connected with the electrical installation&#x27;s protective earthing system). In TT systems the installation&#x27;s earth electrode needs to have low enough impedance to operate protection if a safe voltage (usually taken as 50 V) between the installation and remote earthing is exceeded; in TN systems the system&#x27;s neutral point needs a low resistance connection to Earth to prevent a fault between a conductor and some unintended earth electrode from displacing the neutral-point potential to a dangerous level compared to the Earth.

Bonding is the connection of conductive parts together, to reduce the voltage between them. This is an important measure for electric shock protection. When this protective function is the purpose of bonding, BS 7671 describes the bonding by the term &quot;protective equipotential bonding&quot;; this does not mean that the bonding guarantees perfect equipotentiality, but just that it reduces the differences of potential. In the following, this formal term is abbreviated to &quot;bonding&quot;. Without adequate bonding, dangerous voltages could arise between conductive parts that can be touched simultaneously, either due to problems outside the installation, or to faults in the installation.

Main bonding connects &quot;extraneous conductive parts&quot; such as mains water / gas supply pipes, structural parts of buildings, communication cable sheaths, lightning protection systems etc., to the main earthing terminal. These parts could otherwise introduce potentials that are different from the potential of the installation&#x27;s earthing system. The main bonding avoids dangerous differences in potential being introduced into the installation, between different extraneous conductive parts (e.g. two different pipework systems), or between extraneous conductive parts and exposed conductive parts.

Supplementary bonding connects simultaneously touchable conductive parts in local parts of an installation: the parts may be a mixture of exposed conductive parts and extraneous conductive parts. This reduces the voltage between them, even in fault conditions. Supplementary bonding is particularly used in situations such as bathrooms, where body resistance is low and therefore requires magnitude and duration of touch voltages to be very limited.

In special circumstances (not domestic installations) bonding with deliberate lack of connection to Earth (earth-free local equipotential bonding) may be used. Bonding, by the IEC 60364 terminology used in BS 7671, should not be seen as just an extra to earthing. In recent US practice, which differs considerably from IEC principles and terminology, &quot;bonding&quot; is used more widely as a term for all the aspects of earthing that are not literally connections with the Earth itself (&quot;grounding&quot;); so the connection of protective earth conductors to the supply neutral (since the TN-C-S system is the only permitted form in their residential installations) is now named bonding rather than earthing. This is not the case in the UK.

== Supply, metering and distribution ==

===Single phase (standard for domestic and light commercial)===
A single phase supply typically consists of an armoured cable connected to a service head (aka. &quot;cut out&quot;), the sealed box containing the main supply fuse. This fuse will typically be rated either 60, 80 or 100 amps. Separate and neutral cables (&quot;tails&quot;) go from here to an electricity meter. More tails proceed from the meter into a consumer unit (or fusebox in older installations), possibly via an isolator. Some installations may have multiple consumer units (or an old fusebox along with one or more consumer units), in which case the meter tails may first go into a junction box from which they split out to each individual unit. Such junction boxes are typically known as &quot;Henley blocks&quot; (a splitter box used in low voltage electrical engineering made by W.T.Henley &amp; Co.), or &quot;Isco&quot; blocks, both names deriving from common brands.

An older property, pre-1960s approximately, if it has not yet been upgraded, may still have a fusebox covering all or part of the installation. Such an old fusebox will contain a main switch and a set of fuses, possibly of the re-wireable kind. A more modern consumer unit will contain at a minimum a main switch and an individual miniature circuit breaker (MCB) for each final circuit. Fuses and MCBs are overcurrent devices providing overload, short-circuit and earth fault protection.

Additionally:
* Since the 17th edition of the wiring regulations new installations are typically required to use a 30 mA residual-current device (RCD) on certain circuits. For installations having a TT earthing system this may be crucial to achieving acceptable disconnection times during short circuit or earth fault conditions. Within a consumer unit RCD protection may be found in the form of either RCBOs (residual current circuit breakers with overcurrent protection) which combine MCB and RCD technology, or a &#x27;split-way&#x27; arrangement in which one or more RCCBs each protect a subset of MCBs that need RCD protection. Reductions in the cost of devices and the principle of least disruption now favour use of RCBOs. Of note not all RCD protection is equal; there are four types of RCD, types AC, A, F and B. As of the 18th edition of the regulations only type A is now permitted for general use. Type AC is likely to be found in older installations.
* Since the 18th edition it has become common practice for many new installations to include a surge protection device (SPD) for protection from direct and/or indirect lighting strikes. Of note, since an SPD could fail in such a way that it forms a short circuit, they may be fitted in combination with a dedicated MCB.
* Also since the 18th edition some installations are now required to use arc fault detection devices (AFDDs).

The ownership of parts of an installation can typically be divided into three as follows: (1) The service cable and service head (&quot;cut out&quot; and its &quot;main fuse&quot;) belong to the regional distribution network operator (DNO). (2) The electricity meter, along with the tails connecting it to the service head, plus if there is a supplier fitted isolator, the isolator and tails between the meter and isolator, belong to the electricity supply company (energy supplier; the company who will bill for any energy consumed). (3) The consumer unit and obviously its final circuits, plus the tails connecting the consumer unit either directly to the meter or to a supplier fitted isolator, belong to the owner of the premises. (If an owner has their own isolator fitted between the meter and consumer unit then naturally they would own it and the tails on both sides of it). The owner of the property may own any Henley blocks between the meter and consumer unit(s), or they could belong to the supplier.

Service heads, meters and energy supplier fitted isolators are always fitted with security tags (though often missing) as both a safety measure and an attempt to stop or deter meter tampering and electricity theft. Interfering with the DNO or energy supplier owned equipment without their authorisation may be a crime.

====Supply voltage====
The supply voltage in single phase installations is nominally 230 V AC (RMS) at 50 Hz. However, in practice it will typically measure at around 240 V. This is so because distributors are not actually required to provide exactly 230 V, but rather a voltage within an asymmetric tolerance of of 230 V, meaning anything between 216.2 and 253.0 V is acceptable; and furthermore because prior to the introduction of this standard the previous standard had been 240 V, or more specifically 240 V ±6% (225.6–254.4 V), which almost perfectly falls within the new standard, so distributors lacked sufficient motivation to change the infrastructure to provide a new typical voltage of 230.

The standard was implemented on 1 January 1995 (Electricity Supply Regulations, SI 1994, No. 3021) following a European-wide agreement reached in 1988 to unify the various national voltages, which had ranged between 220 and 240 V, to a common European standard (CENELEC Harmonization Document HD 472 S1:1988). Though in practice this new standard may have made little difference to the voltage provided to premises by distributors, owing to the allowed tolerance range, there was however a significant change in terms of device manufacturing – in order to get a CE compliance marking devices must correctly operate across a voltage range of 230 V ±10%, enabling pan-European compatibility.

It was proposed that the tolerance of the new 230 V standard be widened to ±10% by around 2003 but this has never transpired.

Note that 240 V AC RMS means a momentary peak voltage of plus or minus 339 volts (see this explanation), occurring 50 (either positive or negative) or 100 (both, opposing) times per second. At the tolerances mentioned above, the peak voltage could be (momentarily) larger still.

===Three-phase supply===

Three phase power is usually supplied as needed, for commercial and industrial premises. While three phase loads take balanced power from the three phases, any single phase loads are distributed to try to ensure equal loading of the three phases, and a neutral may be provided to take any imbalance. Each row of breakers in the distribution board is fed from a different phase (L1, L2, and L3), to allow 3-pole common-trip breakers to have one pole on each phase. The distributor&#x27;s service head will contain a main fuse for each phase. Nominal voltage is usually 230 V AC between phase and neutral, and 400 V AC between phases.

Some very large industrial facilities may instead received power at voltages as high as 132 kV AC RMS (high-voltage).

==Isolating devices==

Single-pole switches are most commonly used to control circuits. These switches isolate only the conductor feeding the load and are used for lighting and other smaller loads. For larger loads like air conditioners, cookers, water heaters and other fixed appliances a double-pole switch is used, which also isolates the neutral for greater safety. A three or four-pole isolator or circuit breaker is used for three-phase loads, for devices with both permanent and switched supplies (such as bathroom extractor fans) and also at the distribution board to isolate all the phases. A three-phase installation with a TT earthing system is an example where four-pole devices would be required.

==Outlets and accessories==
Many accessories for electrical installations (e.g., wall sockets, switches) sold in the UK are designed to fit into the mounting boxes defined in &quot;BS 4662:2006—Boxes for flush mounting of electrical accessories—Requirements, test methods and dimensions&quot;, with an 86 mm × 86 mm square face plate that is fixed to the rest of the enclosure by two M3.5 screws (typ. 25 mm or 40 mm long) located on a horizontal centre line, 60.3 mm apart. Double face plates for BS 4662 boxes measure 147 mm × 86 mm and have the two screws 120.6 mm apart.

Accessories in the BS 4662 format are only available in a comparatively limited range of designs and lack the product diversity and design sophistication found in other European markets. The UK installation-accessory industry is therefore occasionally criticised for being overly conservative. As many modern types of electrical accessories (e.g., home automation control elements from non-UK manufacturers) are not available in BS 4662 format, other standard mounting boxes are increasingly used as well, such as those defined in DIN 49073-1 (60 mm diameter, 45 mm deep, fixing screws 60 mm apart) or, less commonly in the UK, ANSI/NEMA OS-1.

The commonly used domestic wall-mount socket used in the UK for currents up to 13 A is defined in BS 1363-2 and normally includes a switch. For higher currents or three-phase output, IEC 60309 sockets are to be used instead.

Many high load non-UK-sourced appliances need IEC 60309 connectors (or wiring via a British Standard &quot;20 A connection unit&quot;) in the UK because of the lower plug rating.

===Plug and accessory fuses (or, &quot;cartridge fuse&quot;)===
Flexible appliance cords require protection at a lower current than that provided by the final circuit overcurrent protection device. This additional protection device may be contained within either the appliance plug (by far the most common solution) or the connection unit (a fused socket or possibly a fused spur protecting the socket). It is normally a ceramic cartridge fuse to BS 1362:1973, commonly rated at either 3 A (red), 5 A (black), or 13 A (brown), but some accessories and adaptors use a ceramic cartridge fuse to BS 646:1958. (Note that it is not intended that the fuse should protect the appliance itself, for which it is still necessary for the appliance designer to take the necessary precautions).

In the case of permanently connected equipment, a fused connection unit (FCU) to BS 1363-4 is used, this may include an isolator switch and a neon bulb to indicate if the equipment is powered.

==Residential wiring==

===Cable types===
In domestic wiring, the following cable types are typically used:

====Internal wiring====
*Twin and earth, or multiple core, polyvinyl chloride-insulated and -sheathed cables, or
*Single-core polyvinyl chloride-insulated cables in conduit (fixed internal wiring; less common in domestic installations)
*Flexible cords

====Supply side wiring====
*2-, 3-, or 4-core polyvinyl chloride-insulated, steel-wire armoured, polyvinyl chloride-sheathed cables
*Polyvinyl chloride-insulated, polyvinyl chloride-sheathed (unarmoured cables)
*3- and 4-core XLPE-insulated, steel-wire armoured, polyvinyl chloride-sheathed cables

===Selection of conductors and circuit breakers===
The selection of conductors must be made taking into consideration both the maximum voltage drop allowed at the load end and also the current carrying capacity of the conductor. Conductor size and voltage drop tables are available to determine the selection, which will be based on the load current supplied and factors such as building insulation.

The choice of circuit breaker is also based on the normal rated current of the circuit. Modern circuit breakers have overload and short circuit current protection combined. The overload protection is for protection of the equipment against sustained small-to-medium increase in current above the rated current, while short circuit protection is for the protection of the conductors against high over-currents due to short circuits.

For domestic circuits the following choices are typically adopted for selecting conductor and circuit breaker sizes.

For distribution boards the incomer circuit breaker rating depends on the current demand at that board. For this the maximum demand and diversity are taken into consideration, based on which the probable current is calculated. Diversity is the condition that all appliances are not likely to be working all at the same time or at their maximum ratings. From this the maximum demand is calculated and the currents are added to determine the load current and hence the rating of the circuit breaker.

===Special locations===
====Bathrooms====
The installation of electrical devices in bathrooms and shower rooms is regulated in Section 701 of BS 7671:2018, and Part P of the Building Regulations in England and Wales. For such rooms, four special zones are defined, in which additional protection is required for electrical facilities:

*Zone 0 is the smallest cuboid volume that contains the bath, shower basin, etc.
*Zone 1 is the area above zone 0, up to a height of 2.25 m above the floor.
*Zone 2 is the area above zone 1 up to a height of 3 m, as well as the area that is horizontally within 0.6 m from zone 1.
*Older regulations defined zone 3 as the area above zone 2 up to a height of 3 m, as well as the area that is horizontally within 2.4 m from zone 2; from BS 7671:2008, this is replaced by the term &quot;outside the zones&quot;. This includes any space under the bath or shower that can only be accessed with a tool.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within zone 0, no devices are allowed apart from suitable equipment and/or insulated pull cords. Previously, in zone 1, only separated extra-low voltage (SELV) devices were permitted. Any AC transformer supplying such a device must be located outside zones 0–2. Since the introduction of the 17th edition of the IET Wiring Regulations in 2008, 230 V fixtures such as light fittings and extractor fans are permitted in zones 1 and 2, subject to those fixtures meeting the appropriate ingress protection ratings. The minimum required ingress protection rating in zone 0 is IPX7 in zone 1 and IPX4 in zone 2. If water jets are likely to occur, at least IPX5 is required in zones 1–3. Otherwise, in zone 3 and beyond, an ingress protection rating of IP20 is the minimum required. Equipment in zones 1 and 2 must be protected by a 30 mA residual current device (RCD).

Shaving sockets (with isolating transformer) are permitted in zone 2 if direct spray from a shower is unlikely, even if they are only IP20. Before the 2008 regulations, such shaving sockets were the only sockets permitted in a bathroom or shower room. Since BS 7671:2008 normal domestic sockets are permitted, at distances greater than 3 m from the edge of the zones, providing the circuit is RCD protected. As the new regulations require &quot;all&quot; general purpose sockets not for use by skilled or instructed persons to be RCD protected, this effectively permits normal wiring in the larger bathroom. (Earlier British wiring rules in bathrooms used to be far more restrictive, leading to British peculiarities in bathrooms such as the use of cord switches. The 2011 edition of the wiring regulations is more flexible now, placing restrictions on bathroom installations that are now similar to those in other European countries.)

====Swimming pools====
For swimming pools, Section 603 of BS 7671 defines similar zones. In some of these zones, only industrial sockets according to IEC 60309 are permitted, in order to discourage the use of portable domestic appliances with inappropriate ingress protection rating.

====Portable outdoor equipment====
For use outdoors or in other wet locations (but not bathrooms) special sockets are made. These can be divided into three main groups: industrial sockets, which are totally different from the standard sockets; sockets with the same pinout as normal sockets but that will only seal properly when the correct plug and socket are used together (e.g., the 5 A, 13 A, and 15 A variants of Lewden sockets); and sockets that completely enclose a normal plug with a seal around the flex (e.g., MK Masterseal).

Sockets that are outside or can &quot;feasibly supply equipment outside the equipotential zone&quot; (a wording that is fairly ambiguous and the exact interpretation of which is subject to some controversy) should be protected by a 30 mA, or lower, RCD to provide additional safety. Since 2008, all sockets for general use should be RCD protected, removing the questions that used to arise, such as &quot;if a socket by the door might power a lawnmower does it need an RCD?&quot;

==Construction sites==
The risk of electrical shock on construction sites can be reduced by several measures, including reduction of the normal 230-volt distribution voltage to 110 volts for electrical lighting and power tools. By using a centre-tapped transformer, each conductor of the circuit is only at 55 volts with respect to Earth. This reduces the chance of dangerous electrical shock when using power tools in wet locations. Where 230 volts must be used, a residual current device (RCD) can be used to detect small leakage currents and automatically isolate faulty equipment. In sites where hazardous flammable gases or liquids are present, special wiring rules are applied to reduce the probability of a spark igniting a fire or explosion.

== Legal and regulatory ==
===Legal basis===

In England and Wales, the Building Regulations (Approved Document: Part P) require domestic electrical installations to be designed and installed safely according to the &quot;fundamental principles&quot; given in British Standard BS 7671 Chapter 13, most recently updated in July 2018. These are very similar to the fundamental principles defined in international standard IEC 60364-1 and equivalent national standards in other countries. Accepted ways for fulfilling this legal requirement include:

*the BS 7671 regulations, colloquially referred to as &quot;the regs&quot;;
*the rules of an equivalent standard approved by a member of the EEA (e.g., DIN/VDE 0100);
*guidance given in installation manuals that are consistent with BS 7671, such as the IET On-Site Guide and IET Guidance Notes Nos. 1 to 8.

In Scotland, the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 apply.

Installations in commercial and industrial premises must satisfy various safety legislation, such as the Electricity at Work Regulations 1989. Again, recognised standards and practices, such as BS 7671 &quot;Wiring Regulations&quot;, are used to help meet the legislative requirements.

===Regulations===
All new electrical work in England and Wales within a domestic setting must comply with Part P of the Building Regulations first introduced on 1 January 2005, which are legally enforceable. One way of achieving this is to apply British Standard BS 7671 (the &quot;Wiring Regulations&quot;), including carrying out adequate inspection and testing to this standard of the completed works. British Standard BS 7671 (the &quot;Wiring Regulations&quot;) is not statutory, thus someone doing electrical work is allowed to deviate from the wiring regulations to some degree, but it is generally accepted that it is best to follow the wiring regulations to the highest standard possible. Electrical work does not have to be compliant with BS 7671, but if a casualty or fatality occurs as a direct result of that electrical work, and this results in a legal action, then it may be necessary to justify major deviations from the principles of BS 7671 and other appropriate standards.

Some of the restrictions first introduced with the 2005 version of Part P of the Building Regulations were highly controversial, especially the rules surrounding work carried out by unregistered electricians, builders and DIYers. Under the new regulations, commencement of any work other than simple changes became notifiable to the local building control authority; &quot;other than simple&quot; in this context meant any work in a kitchen or bathroom other than like-for-like replacement, work in other areas more than just adding extra lights or sockets to an existing circuit, or meeting certain other criteria, such as outdoor wiring. To coincide with the new regulations, the Government approved several professional bodies to award &quot;competent persons&quot; status to enterprises which meet the minimum agreed criteria for Scheme entry. Scheme membership allows an enterprise to &quot;self-certify&quot; work that they carry out without the requirement to have undergone any formal installation training or to hold relevant qualifications in electrical installation practices - since practical competence can be assessment-based only. The minimum criteria for Scheme entry are set by the EAS Committee, on which all of the commercial enterprises running Competent Persons Schemes are actively represented.

The local authority&#x27;s building control must be informed of any notifiable work carried out by someone who is not registered under this scheme before it is started (unless it is an emergency) and must subsequently be approved by them. Originally, it was widely understood by some local authorities that inspection by a qualified person (leading to authority approval) must be organised and paid for by the home-owner or person responsible for the site and this caused some considerable criticism.

On 6 April 2006, Part P was amended to clarify the requirements around certification of DIY work (or work completed by someone otherwise unable to self-certify) and to &quot;make enforcement more proportionate to the risk&quot;.

The 2006 amendment made it clear that it is the responsibility of the building control authority to issue the necessary certificate (a Building Regulations Completion Certificate) once work has been completed. Any inspection required to safely issue that certificate must be determined by, and paid for by, the building control authority. This can be done &quot;in house&quot; or they may contract the work out to a specialist body. Although any inspections are at the expense of the building authority, notification of building work is a formal process and a building control fee is payable.

In some cases the installation of 12 V downlighters is notifiable whereas the installation of 230 V mains downlighters is not. This is because 12 V downlighters draw high currents, in comparison with a mains voltage lamp with the same power rating, and that combined with the wrong choice of cable could lead to a fire.

Additionally, whilst the Building Regulations apply equally to anyone carrying out electrical work in dwellings, without appropriate knowledge and test equipment it is not possible to ensure that the work carried out is safe. Registered Scheme members must issue appropriate certification for each job.

Another element of confusion is that the term &quot;Special Locations&quot; has different meanings in Part P of the Building Regulations and BS 7671 (the &quot;Wiring Regulations&quot;).

Later revisions of part P (latest is 2013) retain the requirement to work to an appropriate standard, but have relaxed the requirements on both certification and notification for many more types of minor works, and crucially also permit a member of an approved body to inspect and &#x27;sign off&#x27; notifiable aspects of any work of a third party such as DIYer whose work is of a suitable standard. This is intended to free up local authorities, who often do not have suitably qualified building control staff themselves. Due to uncertainty about who then becomes responsible for any hidden wiring, very few electricians are happy to sign off an installation that they have not been party to from the outset, and been able to agree stages to inspect and test before any covering in.

<doc id="1105987" wikidata="Q3298397" url="?curid=1105987" title="Augustana University">
<text>Augustana University is a private Lutheran university in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The university identifies 1860 as the year of its founding, the same as its Rock Island, Illinois, Swedish-heritage sister school, Augustana College. It derives its name from the &quot;Confessio Augustana&quot;, or Augsburg Confession, a foundational document of Lutheranism. Until September 2015, the university was known as Augustana College.

Augustana is South Dakota&#x27;s largest private university and offers more than 100 majors, minors, and pre-professional and graduate programs.

==History==
Augustana traces its origin to 1835 when Scandinavian immigrants established the Hillsboro Academy in Hillsboro, Illinois. In 1846, the academy became the Literary and Theological Institute of the Lutheran Church of the Far West before moving to Springfield, Illinois, under the name Illinois State University. In 1860, after church leaders formed the Scandinavian Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod, Professor Lars Paul Esbjörn and a group of followers moved to Chicago to create their institution. There they established the Augustana College and Seminary, marking the date that the university identifies as the year of its founding.

As the United States expanded westward during and after the American Civil War, pioneers moved the school to Paxton, Illinois, in 1863. There, a split occurred: the Norwegian leadership, desiring to create their school, relocated to Marshall, Wisconsin, in 1869, while the Swedes later moved to Rock Island, Illinois, establishing Augustana College (Illinois). The school at Marshall moved to Beloit, Iowa, in 1881, and then to Canton, South Dakota, in 1888.

The Lutheran Normal School opened in 1889 in Sioux Falls, housed in what is now known as Old Main, to educate teachers. City and business leaders lobbied for Augustana to relocate to Sioux Falls, and church leaders in 1918 merged the Lutheran Normal School and Augustana College in Canton under the name Augustana College and Normal School. In 1926, &quot;and Normal School&quot; was dropped from the name and the Canton site eventually became Augustana Academy. Despite the similarities in name, the academy was no longer affiliated with the college, and closed in 1971. The 2010–11 academic year marked Augustana University&#x27;s sesquicentennial.

Augustana draws its name from the origin of the Lutheran Church in the Augsburg Confession, written in 1530 during the Protestant Reformation. &quot;Augustana&quot; stems from the document&#x27;s Latin name, &quot;Confessio Augustana&quot;. On August 21, 2015, the school announced that it would change its name from Augustana College to Augustana University as of September 1, 2015.

==Academics==
Augustana University offers more than 100 majors, minors, and pre-professional and graduate programs. The top majors declared by Augustana students include nursing, biology, business administration, psychology, exercise science, finance, elementary education, computer science, accounting and marketing.

The university&#x27;s curriculum is based on a calendar divided into two 15-week semesters, separated by an interim period of four weeks during January, as well as an optional summer term of eight weeks. Classes and study-away programs are offered during January. The school has a 12:1 student-to-faculty ratio.

Extensive internship, study abroad, undergraduate research and Civitas, the university&#x27;s honors program, supplement Augustana&#x27;s curriculum. Between 2007 and 2008, 285 students participated in an international educational experience, and 44% of students studied abroad before graduation.

In 2023, Augustana&#x27;s financial endowment surpassed $115 million. Donations have allowed the school to expand its academic facilities, such as the renovation of the Mikkelsen Library, 2015 reconstruction of the Froiland Science Complex (formerly Gilbert Science Center), 2022 addition of Ralph H. Wagoner Hall, 2023 addition of Midco Arena, and ongoing construction of the Morrison Commons.

===Admissions and rankings===
, Augustana&#x27;s student body consisted of 1,825 undergraduates, 99% full-time students and 1% part-time, and 59% female. The acceptance rate is 61%. &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; classified Augustana as a &quot;more selective&quot; school, with 62% of the students enrolled having graduated from high school in the top quartile of their class, the average GPA being 3.7. ACT test score submissions had a 23–28 middle 50% range, with an average ACT composite score of 26. The school&#x27;s retention rate of freshmen returning as sophomores was 80% between 2013 and 2014.
Those enrolled are primarily from South Dakota (42%) and Minnesota (34%), followed by Iowa (12%) and Nebraska (4%). In the fall of the 2010–11 academic year, Augustana reported its largest ever incoming class of international students. Fifty-four new students, representing 20 countries and five continents, joined 25 continuing international students for a total of 79 international students from 23 countries, making up about 4.5% of the student body. Although only 46% of students claim a preference for the school&#x27;s Lutheran religious affiliation, the school is nevertheless composed primarily of students following a Christian denomination, with Catholicism the second largest at 21%; 22% of students are categorized as &quot;other&quot;.
In the 2015 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranking of Midwestern colleges, Augustana placed third. The publication also named it a &quot;Best Buy&quot; school, a designation based on academic quality in relation to cost. The Princeton Review named Augustana one of 159 &quot;Best in the Midwest&quot; schools in 2015. In 2017, &quot;Forbes&quot;″s list of &quot;America&#x27;s Top Colleges&quot; placed Augustana 97th among schools in the Midwest and 423rd overall.

=== Arts ===

Augustana created the Center for Western Studies in 1970, founded by professor Herbert Krause, which serves as a library, repository for special collections of art and artifacts, and academic publisher. The center holds an annual Dakota Conference on the Northern Plains for history, literature, art, and archaeology. It is &quot;the largest annual humanities conference specifically about the Northern Plains&quot;. In addition to shows and galleries of Western, Scandinavian, and Native American art, the Center also hosts the Boe Forum on Public Affairs, which has featured speakers such as Pervez Musharraf, Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor, and Mikhail Gorbachev.

The Augustana Choir and Concert Band tour widely nationally and internationally, including to China, Italy, and Tanzania. While on tour in Egypt during the Revolution of 2011, the band was briefly stranded in Cairo due to anti-government protests.

The Augustana University Theatre Company presents 4 main-stage shows each year, one of which is a musical, as well as 2 student-produced shows by the Augustana Collaborative Theatrical Society. Augustana Theatre sponsors an improv group, Brand Name Improv. The department also hosts the Claire Donaldson New Play Festival (formerly the 8-in-48 Claire Donaldson Short Play Festival), which occurs every other year. It was the first theatre department in the state to host a 24 hour play festival. In 2023, the department collaborated with Lifescapes of Sioux Falls and the Black Hills Playhouse to perform the first all-abilities show, which included a half Augustana cast and a half Lifescapes cast, which Augustana students designing as well.

In 2006, the Center for Visual Arts replaced the old art department buildings, previously used as barracks during World War II. It has artist and professor studios, studio classrooms for design, drawing, printmaking, painting, sculpture, ceramics, an art education lab, and the Eide-Dalrymple Gallery, which hosts several art exhibitions every year.

=== &quot;Civitas&quot; ===
Augustana&#x27;s honors program, &quot;Civitas&quot;, launched in 2007. &quot;Civitas&quot; is Latin for &quot;citizenship&quot; and the program is built upon the work of Dietrich Bonhoeffer, a German Lutheran pastor and theologian who was a founding member of the Confessing Church and a participant in the German resistance movement against Nazism. Bonhoeffer&#x27;s essay &quot;The Structure of Responsible Life&quot; is the program&#x27;s central focus. Emphasizing &quot;Stellvertretung&quot; (roughly translated as &quot;vicarious representative action&quot;), Bonhoeffer participated in the Abwehr plot to assassinate Hitler and subsequently wrote the piece as a justification for his actions. Students examine his work in classes specifically designated for Civitas and in special honors sections of existing courses. 40 students are selected from each graduating class; they must maintain a minimum 3.0 GPA, with entrance priority going to incoming students with an ACT score of at least 27 and a 3.5 cumulative high school GPA.

==Athletics==
The Augustana Vikings participate in NCAA Division II athletics in the Northern Sun Intercollegiate Conference. The Vikings joined the NSIC from the North Central Conference, which folded in 2008. The men&#x27;s basketball team won the NCAA Division II national championship in 2016. The women&#x27;s basketball team advanced to the NCAA Division II Final Four in 2013. The men&#x27;s baseball team won the NCAA Division II national championship in 2018. During both the 2004–05 and 2009–10 school years, Augustana wrestlers finished second in the NCAA Division II championship. The Sanford Pentagon is the home court for the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball teams. The Elmen Center, opened in 1989, is the home court for the volleyball and wrestling teams. On December 13, 2018, President Stephanie Herseth Sandlin announced that Augustana would begin pursuing a transition to Division I as part of the university&#x27;s &quot;Vision 2030&quot; plan. In the fall of 2023, Augustana University launched their Division I men&#x27;s hockey team, a step towards Sandlin&#x27;s goal.

== Media ==
The college used to operate a radio station, 89.1 FM KAUR, that broadcasts 24 hours per day. Until 2009, KAUR broadcast a variety of genres of music and specialized in independent or college rock. KAUR was founded in 1972. Augustana also had a self-constructed AM station, founded in 1945. In 2009, Augustana administrators discontinued KAUR&#x27;s student operations in favor of broadcasting Minnesota Public Radio News.

<doc id="1106005" wikidata="Q5757088" url="?curid=1106005" title="High Spirits (short story collection)">
<text>High Spirits is a collection of short stories by Canadian novelist, playwright, critic, journalist and professor Robertson Davies. It was first published by Penguin Canada in 1982

Robertson Davies was Master of Massey College at the University of Toronto in Toronto, Ontario from 1963 until 1981. Shortly after founding the College, he decided that he would tell a ghost story at the College&#x27;s annual Christmas party — its Gaudy Night — as an entertainment. The telling of a ghost story became a tradition, and for eighteen years Davies wrote a new story, which he read out at the Gaudy Night celebration.

After Davies&#x27; retirement from Massey College, the eighteen stories were collected and published in the book &quot;High Spirits&quot;.

<doc id="1106010" wikidata="Q6397950" url="?curid=1106010" title="Keweenaw Waterway">
<text>The Keweenaw Waterway is a partly natural, partly artificial waterway which cuts across the Keweenaw Peninsula of Michigan; it separates Copper Island from the mainland. Parts of the waterway are variously known as the Keweenaw Waterway, Portage Canal, Portage Lake Canal, Portage River, Lily Pond, Torch Lake, and Portage Lake. The waterway connects to Lake Superior at its north and south entries (upper and lower portage entry lighthouses), with sections known as Portage Lake and Torch Lake in between. The primary tributary to Portage Lake is the Sturgeon River.

==History==

The waterway was dredged in the 1860s, extending a small river previously used by natives for transportation and fishing. The effort was a joint venture between the United States government and several mining corporations. Legislation for construction of the canal was passed in 1861. This legislation created the Portage Lake &amp; Lake Superior Canal Co. The company began construction of the canal in September 1868. The canal starts at the mouth of Boston Creek and continues on to Lake Superior.

The expanded canal allowed freighters to haul copper from the rich copper mines of the Keweenaw Peninsula out through Lake Superior to larger cities. It also enabled supply boats and freighters to reach the cities of Houghton and Hancock, which supplied goods to most of Michigan&#x27;s copper region. The expanded canal and shipping lane has a depth of , deeper in some locations. As the waterway connects Lake Superior to itself, there are no locks needed. The local mines&#x27; stamp mills dumped large quantities of stamp sand (containing traces of copper and chemical leaching agents) into the waterway, causing significant environmental damage near the sand dumps. Stamp mills on the waterway included the Old Atlantic, old Quincy, Pewabic, old Franklin, and the Isle Royale mills.

The area north of the waterway is known locally as Copper Island, because the waterway separates the northern part of the Keweenaw Peninsula from the mainland.

The only land route across the waterway is US 41/M-26 across the Portage Lake Lift Bridge.

==Tourism==
The Keweenaw Waterway is part of the Keweenaw Water Trail, a designated loop route (eliminating the need to spot two vehicles or obtain a shuttle) around and through the Keweenaw Peninsula for canoes and sea kayaks. It was established in 1995 and has been designated “A Superior Sports Port” by National Geographic Adventure Magazine. It is said the trail &quot;exemplifies the Keweenaw Peninsula in the most literal sense.&quot; The Lake Superior coast line is craggy and varied, claimed to be comparable to Isle Royale, but without the ferry. Uninhabited wilderness, occasional nature preserves and parks, are interspersed with sheltered harbors that offer weary paddlers the option for a warm bed, hot meal and shower at a local inn. An average paddler can cover the route in six to eight days, but extra days should be planned &quot;to compensate for being wind-bound.&quot; The circumnavigation of the Copper Island is on its way to becoming &quot;Michigan’s top paddling destination.&quot; Shorter trips are possible.

<doc id="1106031" wikidata="Q6823269" url="?curid=1106031" title="Metatarsophalangeal joint sprain">
<text>A metatarsophalangeal joint sprain is an injury to the connective tissue between the foot and a toe (at a metatarsophalangeal joint, one of the joints in the ball of the foot). When the big toe is involved, it is known as &quot;turf toe&quot;.

==Causes==

Turf toe is named from the injury being associated with playing sports on rigid surfaces such as artificial turf and is a fairly common injury among professional American football players. Often, the injury occurs when someone or something falls on the back of the calf while that leg&#x27;s knee and tips of the toes are touching the ground. The toe is hyperextended and thus the joint is injured. Additionally, athletic shoes with very flexible soles combined with cleats that &quot;grab&quot; the turf will cause overextension of the big toe. This can occur on the lesser toes as well. It has also been observed in sports beyond American football, including soccer, baseball, basketball, rugby, volleyball, and tae kwon do. This is a primary reason why many athletes prefer natural grass to turf, because it is softer.

==Treatment==
The injury can be debilitating for athletes of many sports who need to accelerate, quickly change direction, or jump. Use of the toes is not possible during the healing process. Since the toes are necessary for proper push-off when accelerating, those sorts of athletic activities should be almost completely curtailed. An extended healing period of one or more months is often required.

Because of the anatomy of the distal foot and the unique use of the foot, it is often impossible to properly tape or brace the joint. Although difficult, it is not impossible to tape the toe to limit extension (upward bend of toe). Additionally, wearing a shoe with a rigid sole (often a metal plate) and cushioned innersole will help minimize extension of the joint. Anti-inflammatory medication, as well as physical therapy, is recommended.

Turf toe is usually healed in about 2–3 weeks. It can become more serious if left untreated, and may cause serious problems for the athlete. Treating the injury includes icing of the area, elevating the foot, or possibly the use of custom orthotics.

<doc id="1106032" wikidata="Q276421" url="?curid=1106032" title="Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman">
<text>Mary Eleanor Wilkins Freeman (October 31, 1852 – March 13, 1930) was an American author.

== Biography ==
Freeman was born in Randolph, Massachusetts on October 31, 1852, to Eleanor Lothrop and Warren Edward Wilkins, who originally baptized her &quot;Mary Ella&quot;. Freeman&#x27;s parents were orthodox Congregationalists, bestowing a very strict childhood. Religious constraints play a key role in some of her works.

In 1867, the family moved to Brattleboro, Vermont, where Freeman graduated from the local high school before attending Mount Holyoke College (then, Mount Holyoke Female Seminary) in South Hadley, Massachusetts, for one year, from 1870 to 1871. She later finished her education at Glenwood Seminary in West Brattleboro. When the family&#x27;s dry goods business in Vermont failed in 1873, the family returned to Randolph, Massachusetts. Freeman&#x27;s mother died three years later, and she changed her middle name to &quot;Eleanor&quot; in her memory.

Freeman&#x27;s father died suddenly in 1883, leaving her without any immediate family and an estate worth only $973. Wilkins returned to her hometown of Randolph. She moved in with a friend, Mary J. Wales, and began writing as her only source of income.

During a visit to Metuchen, New Jersey in 1892, she met Dr. Charles Manning Freeman, a non-practicing medical doctor seven years younger than she. After years of courtship and delays, the two were married on January 1, 1902. Immediately after, she firmly established her name as &quot;Mary E. Wilkins Freeman&quot;, which she asked &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; to use on all of her work. The couple built a home in Metuchen, where Freeman became a local celebrity for her writing, despite having occasionally published satirical fictional representations of her neighbors. Her husband suffered from alcoholism and an addiction to sleeping powders. He also had a reputation for driving fast horses and womanizing. He was committed to the New Jersey State Hospital for the Insane in Trenton, and the two legally separated a year later. After his death in 1923, he left the majority of his wealth to his chauffeur and only one dollar to his former wife.

In April 1926, Freeman became the first recipient of the William Dean Howells Medal for Distinction in Fiction from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.

Freeman suffered a heart attack and died in Metuchen on March 15, 1930, aged 77. She was laid to rest in Hillside Cemetery in Scotch Plains, New Jersey.

== Adolescence ==
As an adolescent, Freeman was increasingly caught between the need for her mother&#x27;s love and her instinct to avoid becoming her mother and subsiding into her mother&#x27;s form of passivity. Despite continuous pressure from her mother to participate in domestic chores, no amount of discipline could pull Mary away from her reading to the reality of hated kitchen work. According to Edward Foster&#x27;s biography of Freeman, &quot;Disliking her household duties, she avoided them, nor could she be moved by disciplinary tactics.&quot; It is clear that a growing tension between Mary and her mother centered on her resistance to undertaking the tasks expected of a &quot;good girl.&quot;

As the years passed, the contrast between Mary and her sister, Anna, became apparent. While her sister Anna willingly undertook domestic work and increasingly met her parents&#x27; expectations, Mary quietly began to reject them. She would resist her mother&#x27;s world of domesticity throughout her entire life. Her story, &quot;The Revolt of Mother&quot; is especially significant in this context, for the story seems to have been written as a tribute to her mother&#x27;s work, a form of work she had never valued in her mother&#x27;s lifetime.

==Writing==

Freeman began writing stories and verse for children while still a teenager to help support her family and was quickly successful. Her career as a short story writer launched in 1881 when she took first place in a short story contest with her submission “The Ghost Family.” When the supernatural caught her interest, the result was a group of short stories which combined domestic realism with supernaturalism and these have proved very influential. Her best known work was written in the 1880s and 1890s while she lived in Randolph. She produced more than two dozen volumes of published short stories and novels. She is best known for two collections of stories, &quot;A Humble Romance and Other Stories&quot; (1887) and &quot;A New England Nun and Other Stories&quot; (1891). Her stories deal mostly with New England life. Freeman is also remembered for her novel &quot;Pembroke&quot; (1894), and she contributed a notable chapter to the collaborative novel entitled &quot;The Whole Family&quot; (1908).

Through her different genres of work including children&#x27;s stories, poems, and short stories, Mary Wilkins Freeman sought to demonstrate her values as a feminist. During the time which she was writing, she did this in nonconventional ways; for example, she diverged from making her female characters weak and in need of help which was a common trope in literature. Through characters such as Louisa in her short story: “A New England Nun,” Freeman challenges contemporary ideas concerning female roles, values, and relationships in society. Also, Freeman&#x27;s short story “The Revolt of &#x27;Mother&#x27;&quot; illustrated the struggles of rural women and the role they played within their families. “The Revolt of &#x27;Mother&#x27;” initiated the discussion on the rights of rural woman, went on to inspire many more pieces discussing the lack of control rural woman had over families finances, and looking to improve the structure of farm families in the early twentieth-century.

The one-act opera &quot;The Village Singer&quot; by Stephen Paulus was adapted from a Freeman short story; it was commissioned by Opera Theater of Saint Louis, and was premiered in 1979.

Although she produced a dozen volumes of short stories and as many novels, Freeman is remembered chiefly for the first two collections of stories, &quot;A Humble Romance and Other Stories&quot; (1887) and &quot;A New England Nun and Other Stories&quot; (1891), and the novel &quot;Pembroke&quot; (1894) (Britannica Encyclopedia).

<text>The Nepal Workers Peasants Party (NWPP), also known as the Nepal Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Party and the Nepal Majdoor Kisan Party (; abbr. , ), is a communist political party in Nepal. The party was founded on 23 January 1975 by Narayan Man Bijukchhe and draws most of its support from Bhaktapur. The party is sympathetic to the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea and has declared &quot;Juche&quot; to be a &quot;directional ideology&quot;.

== History ==

=== Foundation and early years (1975–1981) ===
The Nepal Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Party was founded as the Nepal Workers and Peasants Organization (NPWO) in Nepal on 23 January 1975. The NPWO broke away from the Communist Party of Nepal (Pushpa Lal) in protest over Pushpa Lal Shrestha&#x27;s support for Indian intervention in East Pakistan, together with the Proletarian Revolutionary Organisation, Nepal, and the Mazdoor Kisan Sangram Samiti. In 1981, the NWPO split, and two separate parties came into existence. One party was led by Narayan Man Bijukchhe, which later became the Nepal Workers&#x27; and Peasants&#x27; Party and the other was led by Hareram Sharma.

=== Jana Andholan I and II (1990–2007) ===

Bijukchhe&#x27;s NWPO formed part of the United Left Front and took part in the 1990 Jana Andolan uprising. It participated in the formation of the Samyukta Janamorcha Nepal but left shortly before the 1991 election. The group changed its name to the Nepal Workers Peasants Party and contested the election separately. It fielded 30 candidates, out of whom two were elected. The party received a total of 91,335 votes, or 1.25%.

Ahead of the 1992 elections to local bodies, the NWPP formed an electoral coalition with the Samyukta Janamorcha Nepal, Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist-Leninist-Maoist), Communist Party of Nepal (Marxist), and Nepal Communist League.
NWPP was active in the protest movements against repression in Nepal and is a member of the Seven Party Alliance which spearheaded the 2006 Loktantra Andolan. After the restoration of a democratic system, the party decided not to join the government, but stayed in the Seven Party Alliance, which later converted into the Eight Party Alliance. When the interim legislature was formed in January 2007, Bijukchhe was joined by three other nominated MPs.

=== Constituent Assembly and Federal Nepal (2008–present) ===
The party contested the 2008 Constituent Assembly elections and won four seats to the Constituent Assembly. The party also had one nominated member. In the 2013 Constituent Assembly elections, the party again won four seats. The party voted for Khadga Prasad Oli in the prime minister election on 12 October 2015.

In the 2017 local elections, the party won 99 seats across local governments and won one mayoral position, with Sunil Prajapati being elected as the mayor of Bhaktapur Municipality. The party also contested the 2017 legislative and provincial elections, winning one seat in the House of Representatives and two seats to the Provincial Assembly of Province No. 3.

== Ideology ==
The Nepal Workers Peasants Party is a communist party, with the party taking major inspiration from the Chinese Mao Zedong Thought ideology. The guiding economic principle of the party is scientific socialism.

In recent years, the party has incorporated the &quot;Juche&quot; idea as a guiding principle. After visiting North Korea, party leader Narayan Man Bijukchhe has attempted to implement the governing policies of &quot;Juche&quot; into the city of Bhaktapur. Portraits of the Kim family can be found at the party headquarters in Bhaktapur. The party sees political independence and economic self-sufficiency as the cornerstones of development. The party also sees India as an imperialist force working against Nepalese interests.

<text>Anna Alexandrovna Vyrubova (&quot;née&quot; Taneyeva; ; 16 July 1884 – 20 July 1964) was a lady-in-waiting in the late Russian Empire, the best friend and confidante of Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna.

==Early life==
Anna Alexandrovna Taneeva was born in Oranienbaum as the daughter of Aleksandr Taneyev, Chief Steward to His Majesty&#x27;s Chancellery and a noted composer. Her mother, Countess Nadezhda Tolstoy (1860-1937), descended from Field Marshal Mikhail Golenishchev-Kutuzov, Prince of Smolensk. These connections allowed her to become attached to the imperial court at an early age. She had two younger siblings: Sergei and Alexandra.

She was a childhood friend of Felix Yussupov, who later spearheaded the murder of Rasputin. Yussupov found her unattractive: 

==Life at court==
The Tsarina valued Anna&#x27;s devotion to her and befriended her, ignoring women of more distinction at the court. In 1905, at the age of twenty, she was given a position at court for the first time. She went on holidays with the Romanovs in three succeeding years. In 1907, Anna married Alexander Vasilievich Vyrubov (1880-1919), a Russian nobleman and an officer appointed in the Imperial chancellery. A few days before, she was warned by Rasputin that the marriage would be an unhappy one. According to Vyrubova, her husband was mad and went for treatment in Switzerland. The couple divorced within a year and a half. It is said that her husband was upset after he found out she had contacted Rasputin. In her memoirs, Rasputin&#x27;s daughter Maria claimed that Vyrubova was raped on her wedding night and that Vyrubov &quot;pounced upon her as one would another man in a bathroom brawl and proceeded to beat her as he shouted all sorts of obscenities, most of which she didn&#x27;t understand.&quot; Vyrubova&#x27;s mother reportedly told interrogators following the February Revolution that her son-in-law &quot;proved to be completely impotent, with an extremely perverse sexual psychology that manifested itself in various sadistic episodes in which he inflicted moral suffering on her and evoked a feeling of utter disgust.&quot; 

Vyrubova became one of Rasputin&#x27;s adherents and on the order of the Tsarina, she went on a trip to his home village of Pokrovskoye to investigate the rumours about Rasputin. She visited some monasteries in the area. Vyrubova&#x27;s importance grew at the court, as the friendship with Milica of Montenegro and her sister Anastasia deteriorated. &quot;With the death of Father John of Kronstadt, &quot;Father&quot; Grigori became, in her eyes, the only mediator with God, the only man with effective prayers. He was called to replace Father John.&quot; In 1909 she received to hieromonk Iliodor in her house for a meeting with the Tsar. Around Easter 1912 Vyrubova stashed Rasputin on a train to Yalta, so he could visit the Imperial family in the Livadia Palace on the Crimea.

===Rasputin===
In early October 1912, during a grave crisis in Spała, in Russian Poland, the Tsarevich Alexei received the last sacrament. The desperate Tsarina turned to Vyrubova to secure the help of the peasant healer, who at that time was out of favor. (The basis for the denunciation of Rasputin as a Khlyst was his participation in mixed bathing, a perfectly usual custom among the peasants of many parts of Siberia.)

For a long time, she served as a go-between for the Tsarina and Rasputin. In the Summer of 1914, Vyrubova received a cable from Rasputin, recovering from the attack by Khioniya Guseva in a Tyumen hospital. She had to show it directly to the Tsar Nicholas II. Rasputin was fearful of the consequences of war with Germany. Nicholas had been furious, but Anna arranged a reunion. While seldom meeting with Alexandra personally after the debate in the Imperial Duma, Rasputin had become her personal adviser after the Tsar took supreme command of the Russian armies in the field on 23 August 1915 (O.S.), hoping this would lift morale. All contacts between the Tsarina and Rasputin went through Vyrubova; every morning at ten she phoned Rasputin and he came to visit her lemon-yellow house in Tsarskoye Selo to meet Alexandra. The Tsar&#x27;s biggest concern was that Alexandra might share information with others. 

During World War I, she trained as a Red Cross nurse and nursed soldiers along with the Tsarina and the Tsarina&#x27;s two older daughters, The Grand Duchesses Olga and Tatiana. Vyrubova was severely injured in a train accident between the capital and Tsarskoye Selo in January 1915; the convalescent Vyrubova found herself a paraplegic, but credited Rasputin with saving her life with his prayers. In September 1916 she, Lili Dehn and Rasputin went to Tobolsk to pay tribute to John of Tobolsk, who had been glorified.

Vyrubova started a hospital with the money she received from the train company as compensation. Protopopov came to visit the hospital almost every day. She also planned to build a church dedicated to Seraphim of Sarov on her property. (Rasputin would be buried on the spot.) On Friday evening 16 December 1916 Rasputin told Vyrubova, who presented him a small icon, signed and dated at the back by the Tsarina and her daughters, of a proposed midnight visit to Prince Yusupov in his Moika Palace to meet his wife. The next morning Rasputin&#x27;s disappearance was reported by his daughter to Vyrubova. When Vyrubova spoke of it to the Empress, Alexandra pointed out that Irina Aleksandrovna Romanova was absent from Petrograd. An investigation followed and Prince Yusupov and Grand Duke Dmitri were placed under house arrest in the Sergei Palace. The Tsarina had refused to meet the two but was told by Anna they could explain what had happened in a letter. Two days later Rasputin&#x27;s body was found near Bolshoy Petrovsky Bridge. His body was taken to the Chesmensky Almshouse for autopsy. In the middle of the night, Vyrubova and the Tsarina brought some clothes to the almshouse. On 21 December Rasputin&#x27;s body was taken in a zinc coffin from the Chesme Church to be buried in a secret location in a corner on the property of Vyrubova adjacent to the palace. The burial was attended by the Imperial couple with their daughters – the tsesarevich was too ill, Vyrubova, her maid, and a few of Rasputin&#x27;s friends, as Colonel Loman and Lili Dehn. It is unclear if Maria Rasputin was there. On 11 March 1917, following the February Revolution, the coffin with Rasputin was dug up and transported to Saint Petersburg State Polytechnical University, and cremated in the cauldrons of the nearby boiler shop, without leaving a single trace.

==Later life==

Sick with measles, Anna Vyrubova was arrested on 21 March 1917 and underwent five months of prison in the Peter and Paul Fortress, which included a medical examination to prove her virginity. The interrogation on her political role started on 6 May. Vyrubova admitted she saw Rasputin once or twice a week but feigned a childish innocence. The investigator concluded that she was too naïve and unintelligent to have had any influence over the Tsarina.

In Anna&#x27;s own memoirs, she describes her perils in prison and her narrow escape from execution when, miraculously, she met several old friends of her father on a St. Petersburg street who helped her escape. She endured much hardship avoiding the Bolsheviks, and she was able to escape to Finland only in December 1920. Before leaving the Soviet Union, she became friends with the revolutionary writer Maxim Gorky, who urged her to write her memoirs; she followed his advice. She met with Zinaida Gippius, Alexander Blok and Valery Bryusov. Her memories of life at court provided rare descriptions of the home life of the Tsar and his family 
Vyrubova spent the rest of her life first in Viipuri and later in Helsinki. She took vows as a Russian Orthodox nun but was permitted to live in a private home because of her physical disabilities. On 20 July 1964, she died at the age of 80, in Helsinki, where she was buried in the Orthodox section of Hietaniemi cemetery.

<doc id="1106042" wikidata="Q1422356" url="?curid=1106042" title="Reciprocal polynomial">
<text>In algebra, given a polynomial
:formula_1
with coefficients from an arbitrary field, its reciprocal polynomial or reflected polynomial, denoted by or , is the polynomial

:formula_2

That is, the coefficients of are the coefficients of in reverse order. Reciprocal polynomials arise naturally in linear algebra as the characteristic polynomial of the inverse of a matrix.

In the special case where the field is the complex numbers, when

:formula_3

the conjugate reciprocal polynomial, denoted , is defined by,

:formula_4

where formula_5 denotes the complex conjugate of formula_6, and is also called the reciprocal polynomial when no confusion can arise.

A polynomial is called self-reciprocal or palindromic if .
The coefficients of a self-reciprocal polynomial satisfy for all .

== Properties ==
Reciprocal polynomials have several connections with their original polynomials, including:
# .
# is a root of a polynomial if and only if is a root of .
# If then is irreducible if and only if is irreducible.
# is primitive if and only if is primitive.

Other properties of reciprocal polynomials may be obtained, for instance:
* A self-reciprocal polynomial of odd degree is divisible by x+1, hence is not irreducible if its degree is &gt; 1.

== Palindromic and antipalindromic polynomials==
A self-reciprocal polynomial is also called palindromic because its coefficients, when the polynomial is written in the order of ascending or descending powers, form a palindrome. That is, if
:formula_7 
is a polynomial of degree , then is &quot;palindromic&quot; if for . 

Similarly, a polynomial of degree is called antipalindromic if for . That is, a polynomial is &quot;antipalindromic&quot; if .

===Examples===
From the properties of the binomial coefficients, it follows that the polynomials are palindromic for all positive integers , while the polynomials are palindromic when is even and antipalindromic when is odd.

Other examples of palindromic polynomials include cyclotomic polynomials and Eulerian polynomials.

===Properties===
* If is a root of a polynomial that is either palindromic or antipalindromic, then is also a root and has the same multiplicity.
* The converse is true: If for each root of polynomial, the value is also a root of the same multiplicity, then the polynomial is either palindromic or antipalindromic.
* For any polynomial , the polynomial is palindromic and the polynomial is antipalindromic.
* It follows that any polynomial can be written as the sum of a palindromic and an antipalindromic polynomial, since .
* The product of two palindromic or antipalindromic polynomials is palindromic.
* The product of a palindromic polynomial and an antipalindromic polynomial is antipalindromic.
* A palindromic polynomial of odd degree is a multiple of (it has –1 as a root) and its quotient by is also palindromic.
* An antipalindromic polynomial over a field with odd characteristic is a multiple of (it has 1 as a root) and its quotient by is palindromic.
* An antipalindromic polynomial of even degree is a multiple of (it has −1 and 1 as roots) and its quotient by is palindromic. 
* If is a palindromic polynomial of even degree 2, then there is a polynomial of degree such that .
* If is a monic antipalindromic polynomial of even degree 2 over a field of odd characteristic, then it can be written uniquely as , where is a monic polynomial of degree with no constant term.
* If an antipalindromic polynomial has even degree over a field of odd characteristic, then its &quot;middle&quot; coefficient (of power ) is 0 since .

===Real coefficients===
A polynomial with real coefficients all of whose complex roots lie on the unit circle in the complex plane (that is, all the roots have modulus 1) is either palindromic or antipalindromic.

==Conjugate reciprocal polynomials==

A polynomial is conjugate reciprocal if formula_8 and self-inversive if formula_9 for a scale factor on the unit circle.

If is the minimal polynomial of with , and has real coefficients, then is self-reciprocal. This follows because

:formula_10

So is a root of the polynomial formula_11 which has degree . But, the minimal polynomial is unique, hence 
:formula_12
for some constant , i.e. formula_13. Sum from to and note that 1 is not a root of . We conclude that .

A consequence is that the cyclotomic polynomials are self-reciprocal for . This is used in the special number field sieve to allow numbers of the form and to be factored taking advantage of the algebraic factors by using polynomials of degree 5, 6, 4 and 6 respectively – note that (Euler&#x27;s totient function) of the exponents are 10, 12, 8 and 12.

Per Cohn&#x27;s theorem, a self-inversive polynomial has as many roots in the unit disk formula_14 as the reciprocal polynomial of its derivative.

==Application in coding theory==

The reciprocal polynomial finds a use in the theory of cyclic error correcting codes. Suppose can be factored into the product of two polynomials, say . When generates a cyclic code , then the reciprocal polynomial generates , the orthogonal complement of .
Also, is &quot;self-orthogonal&quot; (that is, , if and only if divides .

<doc id="1106055" wikidata="Q772939" url="?curid=1106055" title="Linear no-threshold model">
<text>The linear no-threshold model (LNT) is a dose-response model used in radiation protection to estimate stochastic health effects such as radiation-induced cancer, genetic mutations and teratogenic effects on the human body due to exposure to ionizing radiation. The model assumes a linear relationship between dose and health effects, even for very low doses where biological effects are more difficult to observe. The LNT model implies that all exposure to ionizing radiation is harmful, regardless of how low the dose is, and that the effect is cumulative over lifetime.

The LNT model is commonly used by regulatory bodies as a basis for formulating public health policies that set regulatory dose limits to protect against the effects of radiation. The validity of the LNT model, however, is disputed, and other models exist: the threshold model, which assumes that very small exposures are harmless, the radiation hormesis model, which says that radiation at very small doses can be beneficial, and the supra-linear model. It has been argued that the LNT model may have created an irrational fear of radiation.

Scientific organizations and government regulatory bodies generally support use of the LNT model, particularly for optimization. However, some caution against estimating health effects from doses below a certain level (see ).

== Introduction ==
Stochastic health effects are those that occur by chance, and whose probability is proportional to the dose, but whose severity is independent of the dose. The LNT model assumes there is no lower threshold at which stochastic effects start, and assumes a linear relationship between dose and the stochastic health risk. In other words, LNT assumes that radiation has the potential to cause harm at &quot;any&quot; dose level, however small, and the sum of several very small exposures is just as likely to cause a stochastic health effect as a single larger exposure of equal dose value. In contrast, deterministic health effects are radiation-induced effects such as acute radiation syndrome, which are caused by tissue damage. Deterministic effects reliably occur above a threshold dose and their severity increases with dose. Because of the inherent differences, LNT is not a model for deterministic effects, which are instead characterized by other types of dose-response relationships.

LNT is a common model to calculate the probability of radiation-induced cancer both at high doses where epidemiology studies support its application, but controversially, also at low doses, which is a dose region that has a lower predictive statistical confidence. Nonetheless, regulatory bodies, such as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), commonly use LNT as a basis for regulatory dose limits to protect against stochastic health effects, as found in many public health policies. Whether the LNT model describes the reality for small-dose exposures is disputed, and challenges to the LNT model used by NRC for setting radiation protection regulations were submitted. NRC rejected the petitions in 2021 because &quot;they fail to present an adequate basis supporting the request to discontinue use of the LNT model&quot;.

Other dose models include: the threshold model, which assumes that very small exposures are harmless, and the radiation hormesis model, which claims that radiation at very small doses can be beneficial. Because the current data is inconclusive, scientists disagree on which model should be used, though most national and international cancer research organizations explicitly endorse LNT for regulating exposures to low dose radiation. The model is sometimes used to quantify the cancerous effect of collective doses of low-level radioactive contaminations, which is controversial. Such practice has been criticized by the International Commission on Radiological Protection since 2007.

==Origins==
The association of exposure to radiation with cancer had been observed as early as 1902, six years after the discovery of X-rays by Wilhelm Röntgen and radioactivity by Henri Becquerel. In 1927, Hermann Muller demonstrated that radiation may cause genetic mutation. He also suggested mutation as a cause of cancer. Gilbert N. Lewis and Alex Olson, based on Muller&#x27;s discovery of the effect of radiation on mutation, proposed a mechanism for biological evolution in 1928, suggesting that genomic mutation was induced by cosmic and terrestrial radiation and first introduced the idea that such mutation may occur proportionally to the dose of radiation. Various laboratories, including Muller&#x27;s, then demonstrated the apparent linear dose response of mutation frequency. Muller, who received a Nobel Prize for his work on the mutagenic effect of radiation in 1946, asserted in his Nobel lecture, &quot;The Production of Mutation&quot;, that mutation frequency is &quot;directly and simply proportional to the dose of irradiation applied&quot; and that there is &quot;no threshold dose&quot;.

The early studies were based on higher levels of radiation that made it hard to establish the safety of low level of radiation. Indeed, many early scientists believed that there may be a tolerance level, and that low doses of radiation may not be harmful. A later study in 1955 on mice exposed to low dose of radiation suggests that they may outlive control animals. The interest in the effects of radiation intensified after the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and studies were conducted on the survivors. Although compelling evidence on the effect of low dosage of radiation was hard to come by, by the late 1940s, the idea of LNT became more popular due to its mathematical simplicity. In 1954, the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) introduced the concept of maximum permissible dose. In 1958, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) assessed the LNT model and a threshold model, but noted the difficulty in acquiring &quot;reliable information about the correlation between small doses and their effects either in individuals or in large populations&quot;. The United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy (JCAE) similarly could not establish if there is a threshold or &quot;safe&quot; level for exposure; nevertheless, it introduced the concept of &quot;As Low As Reasonably Achievable&quot; (ALARA). ALARA would become a fundamental principle in radiation protection policy that implicitly accepts the validity of LNT. In 1959, the United States Federal Radiation Council (FRC) supported the concept of the LNT extrapolation down to the low dose region in its first report.

By the 1970s, the LNT model had become accepted as the standard in radiation protection practice by a number of bodies. In 1972, the first report of National Academy of Sciences (NAS) Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation (BEIR), an expert panel who reviewed available peer reviewed literature, supported the LNT model on pragmatic grounds, noting that while &quot;dose-effect relationship for x rays and gamma rays may not be a linear function&quot;, the &quot;use of linear extrapolation ... may be justified on pragmatic grounds as a basis for risk estimation.&quot; In its seventh report of 2006, NAS BEIR VII writes, &quot;the committee concludes that the preponderance of information indicates that there will be some risk, even at low doses&quot;.

The Health Physics Society (in the United States) has published a documentary series on the origins of the LNT model.

== Radiation precautions and public policy==

Radiation precautions have led to sunlight being listed as a carcinogen at all sun exposure rates, due to the ultraviolet component of sunlight, with no safe level of sunlight exposure being suggested, following the precautionary LNT model. According to a 2007 study submitted by the University of Ottawa to the Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, D.C., there is not enough information to determine a safe level of sun exposure.

The linear no-threshold model is used to extrapolate the expected number of extra deaths caused by exposure to environmental radiation, and it therefore has a great impact on public policy. The model is used to translate any radiation release, into a number of lives lost, while any reduction in radiation exposure, for example as a consequence of radon detection, is translated into a number of lives saved. When the doses are very low the model predicts new cancers only in a very small fraction of the population, but for a large population, the number of lives is extrapolated into hundreds or thousands.

A linear model has long been used in health physics to set maximum acceptable radiation exposures.

==Controversy==
The LNT model has been contested by a number of scientists. It has been claimed that the early proponent of the model Hermann Joseph Muller intentionally ignored an early study that did not support the LNT model when he gave his 1946 Nobel Prize address advocating the model.

In very high dose radiation therapy, it was known at the time that radiation can cause a physiological increase in the rate of pregnancy anomalies; however, human exposure data and animal testing suggests that the &quot;malformation of organs appears to be a deterministic effect with a threshold dose&quot;, below which no rate increase is observed. A review in 1999 on the link between the Chernobyl accident and teratology (birth defects) concludes that &quot;there is no substantive proof regarding radiation‐induced teratogenic effects from the Chernobyl accident&quot;. It is argued that the human body has defense mechanisms, such as DNA repair and programmed cell death, that would protect it against carcinogenesis due to low-dose exposures of carcinogens. However, these repair mechanisms are known to be error prone. 

A 2011 research of the cellular repair mechanisms support the evidence against the linear no-threshold model. According to its authors, this study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America &quot;casts considerable doubt on the general assumption that risk to ionizing radiation is proportional to dose&quot;.

A 2011 review of studies addressing childhood leukaemia following exposure to ionizing radiation, including both diagnostic exposure and natural background exposure from radon, concluded that existing risk factors, excess relative risk per sievert (ERR/Sv), is &quot;broadly applicable&quot; to low dose or low dose-rate exposure, &quot;although the uncertainties associated with this estimate are considerable&quot;. The study also notes that &quot;epidemiological studies have been unable, in general, to detect the influence of natural background radiation upon the risk of childhood leukaemia&quot;

Many expert scientific panels have been convened on the risks of ionizing radiation. Most explicitly support the LNT model and none have concluded that evidence exists for a threshold, with the exception of the French Academy of Sciences in a 2005 report. Considering the uncertainty of health effects at low doses, several organizations caution against estimating health effects below certain doses, generally below natural background, as noted below:
* The US Nuclear Regulatory Commission upheld the LNT model in 2021 as a &quot;sound regulatory basis for minimizing the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure to both members of the public and radiation workers&quot; following challenges to the dose limit requirements contained in its regulations.

* In 2004 the United States National Research Council (part of the National Academy of Sciences) supported the linear no threshold model and stated regarding Radiation hormesis:
* In 2005 the United States National Academies&#x27; National Research Council published its comprehensive meta-analysis of low-dose radiation research BEIR VII, Phase 2. In its press release the Academies stated:

* In a 2005 report, the International Commission on Radiological Protection stated: &quot;The report concludes that while existence of a low-dose threshold does not seem to be unlikely for radiation-related cancers of certain tissues, the evidence does not favour the existence of a universal threshold. The LNT hypothesis, combined with an uncertain DDREF for extrapolation from high doses, remains a prudent basis for radiation protection at low doses and low dose rates.&quot; In a 2007 report, ICRP noted that collective dose is effective for optimization, but aggregation of very low doses to estimate excess cancers is inappropriate because of large uncertainties.
* The National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (a body commissioned by the United States Congress), in a 2018 report, &quot;concludes that the recent epidemiological studies support the continued use of LNT model for radiation protection. This is in accord with judgments by other national and international scientific committees, based on somewhat older data, that no alternative dose-response relationship appears more pragmatic or prudent for radiation protection purposes than the LNT model.&quot;
* The United States Environmental Protection Agency endorses the LNT model in its 2011 report on radiogenic cancer risk:
* UNSCEAR stated in Appendix C of its 2020/2021 report:
A number of organisations caution against using the Linear no-threshold model to estimate risk from radiation exposure below a certain level:

* The French Academy of Sciences (&quot;Académie des sciences&quot;) and the National Academy of Medicine (&quot;Académie nationale de médecine&quot;) published a report in 2005 (at the same time as BEIR VII report in the United States) that rejected the linear no-threshold model in favor of a threshold dose response and a significantly reduced risk at low radiation exposure:

* The Health Physics Society&#x27;s position statement first adopted in January 1996, last revised in February 2019, states:

* The American Nuclear Society states that the LNT model may not adequately describe the relationship between harm and exposure and notes the recommendation in ICRP-103 &quot;that the LNT model not be used for estimating the health effects of trivial exposures received by large populations over long periods of time…&quot; It further recommends additional research.

*UNSCEAR stated in its 2012 report: 
==Mental health effects==
It has been argued that the LNT model had caused an irrational fear of radiation, whose observable effects are much more significant than non-observable effects postulated by LNT. In the wake of the 1986 Chernobyl accident in Ukraine, Europe-wide anxieties were fomented in pregnant mothers over the perception enforced by the LNT model that their children would be born with a higher rate of mutations. As far afield as the country of Switzerland, hundreds of excess induced abortions were performed on the healthy unborn, out of this no-threshold fear. Following the accident however, studies of data sets approaching a million births in the EUROCAT database, divided into &quot;exposed&quot; and control groups were assessed in 1999. As no Chernobyl impacts were detected, the researchers conclude &quot;in retrospect the widespread fear in the population about the possible effects of exposure on the unborn was not justified&quot;. Despite studies from Germany and Turkey, the only robust evidence of negative pregnancy outcomes that transpired after the accident were these elective abortion indirect effects, in Greece, Denmark, Italy etc., due to the anxieties created.

The consequences of low-level radiation are often more psychological than radiological. Because damage from very-low-level radiation cannot be detected, people exposed to it are left in anguished uncertainty about what will happen to them. Many believe they have been fundamentally contaminated for life and may refuse to have children for fear of birth defects. They may be shunned by others in their community who fear a sort of mysterious contagion.

Forced evacuation from a radiation or nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, or suicide. Such was the outcome of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine. A comprehensive 2005 study concluded that &quot;the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date&quot;. Frank N. von Hippel, a U.S. scientist, commented on the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, saying that &quot;fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas&quot;.

Such great psychological danger does not accompany other materials that put people at risk of cancer and other deadly illness. Visceral fear is not widely aroused by, for example, the daily emissions from coal burning, although as a National Academy of Sciences study found, this causes 10,000 premature deaths a year in the US. It is &quot;only nuclear radiation that bears a huge psychological burden – for it carries a unique historical legacy&quot;.

<text>The Nepal Revolutionary Students Union (; abbr. NRSU and ) is the student wing of the Nepal Workers Peasants Party, a communist party in Nepal which follows &quot;Juche&quot;. The president of the NRSU is Prakash Gurung

== History ==
The NRSU was established in 1969 against the practices of the student movement of the time, which they saw as defeatist and unprincipled. 

The Sixth National Convention of NWPP (4 to 6 April 2014) adopted the Program of Peoples&#x27; Democracy as its strategic program (where peoples&#x27; democracy is seen as a step towards socialism), which was adopted by the NRSU.

In February 2004, the NRSU won the post of president in the Free Student Union elections at the Bhaktapur Multiple Campus. It won the same post two more times. In the last election, a female student from the NRSU was the first woman to win the post of an FSU chairperson in Nepal. The NRSU won minor posts in several other colleges.

<doc id="1106074" wikidata="Q1267102" url="?curid=1106074" title="Serene Highness">
<text>His/Her Serene Highness (abbreviation: HSH, second person address: Your Serene Highness) is a style used today by the reigning families of Liechtenstein, Monaco and Thailand, apart the Principe of the Crown of Nabatea. Until 1918, it was also associated with the princely titles of members of some German ruling and mediatised dynasties and with a few princely but non-ruling families. It was also the form of address used for cadet members of the dynasties of France, Italy, Russia and Ernestine Saxony, under their monarchies. Additionally, the treatment was granted for some, but not all, princely yet non-reigning families of Bohemia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania and Russia by emperors or popes. In a handful of rare cases, it was employed by non-royal rulers in viceregal or even republican contexts.

In a number of older English dictionaries, &quot;serene&quot; as used in this context means &quot;supreme&quot;; &quot;royal&quot;; &quot;august&quot;; &quot;marked by majestic dignity or grandeur&quot;; or &quot;high or supremely dignified&quot;.

==Belgium==
The following titleholders or families are authorised by the Crown to use the style &quot;Serene Highness&quot; (, )

*Dukes and princes of Arenberg
*Dukes of Beaufort-Spontin
*Dukes and princes of Croÿ
*Princes of Habsburg-Lorraine (archducal cadets resident in Belgium)
*Princes of Lobkowicz (resident in Belgium)
*Dukes and princes of Looz-Corswarem 
*Princes of Stolberg-Stolberg
*Prince of Waterloo

In the lodges of the Grand Orient of Belgium, the latter&#x27;s Grandmaster is styled &quot;Sérénissime Grand Maître&quot;, &quot;Doorluchtige Grootmeester&quot;.

==Francophone dominions==
There is some evidence that in pre-Revolutionary France, unlike Germany, one entitled to be addressed as &quot;Serene Highness&quot; was considered to outrank someone who was addressed as merely &quot;Highness&quot;. Those members of the royal family who were not children or grandchildren of a king, i.e., the &quot;princes du sang&quot;, were entitled to be addressed as &quot;Most Serene Highness&quot; (&quot;Son Altesse Sérénissime&quot;, abbreviated &quot;S.A.S.&quot;). The simple style of &quot;Highness&quot; (&quot;altesse&quot;) was claimed by the &quot;princes étrangers&quot; and the &quot;princes légitimés&quot;. In fact, these formal styles were seldom employed in conversation, since the &quot;princes du sang&quot; used unique styles (e.g. &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Monsieur le Prince&quot;), while the ducal peers, led by the proud Duc de Saint-Simon, avoided conceding the &quot;altesse&quot; to the &quot;princes étrangers&quot; and &quot;bâtards royaux&quot;, prompting nobles of lesser rank to do likewise.

==German-speaking lands==
The current, legal usage of the style in the German-speaking countries is confined to the Princely Family of Liechtenstein, the entirety of which bears the treatment.

The German term is , a translation of the Latin . This is usually translated into English as &quot;Serene Highness&quot;, however, it would be more literal to translate it as &quot;superior to, above, beyond or greater than illustrious&quot;, as it is an augmentation of (&quot;Illustrious Highness&quot;), which was accorded to immediate counts () of the Holy Roman Empire and by mediatised counts of the German Confederation and the German Empire. The 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica wryly observes that a perfectly logical English version might be &quot;Your Transparency&quot;.

In 1375, Emperor Charles IV bestowed the nobiliary style upon the seven Prince-electors designated by the Golden Bull of 1356. As from 1664, Emperor Leopold I vested all Imperial Princes with the title, it became so common that the Electors like the Archdukes of Austria began to use the superlative address . In the German Empire, the style of &quot;Serene Highness&quot; was usually held by princes of lower rank than those who were entitled to &quot;Highness&quot; (exceptions were the Wettin cadets of the Ernestine duchies), &quot;Grand Ducal Highness&quot;, &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, and &quot;Imperial Highness&quot;. Therefore, if a woman entitled to the treatment of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; married a man who was addressed only as &quot;Serene Highness&quot;, the woman usually retained her pre-marital style.

In 1905, Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria granted the style of to members of virtually every family which had held the title of prince in the former Holy Roman Empire, even if the family had never exercised sovereignty.

In the German and Austrian empires of the 19th and 20th centuries, the style &quot;Serene Highness&quot; was also officially borne by:
* Cadet branches of the sovereign Ernestine dukes (i.e., Saxe-Altenburg, Saxe-Meiningen, Saxe-Coburg and Gotha);
* Reigning of the small German realms which survived the collapse of the Holy Roman Empire;
** Hohenzollern (yielded sovereignty to Hohenzollern kinsman, the King of Prussia, in 1848)
** Lippe
** Reuss
** Schaumburg-Lippe
** Schwarzburg 
** Waldeck and Pyrmont
* Mediatised princes (e.g., Fürstenberg, Hohenlohe, Leiningen, Thurn und Taxis) and dukes (e.g., Ratibor), and perhaps their family members;
* Morganatic princes, descended from reigning dynasties;
* Other non-reigning princes of the German nobility, but not (always) their cadets (e.g., Bismarck, Carolath-Beuthen, Pless, Wrede).

By tradition, is still attributed to the princely dynasties which were sovereign until 1917 or had been mediatised under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and German Confederation in 1815, although the usage has been unofficial since 1918.

N.B. The highest form of (adjective) was (absolutely most serene), which was reserved only to the Emperor in his style of address: 

==Hungary==
Before 1947, the style &quot;His/Her Serene Highness&quot;&#x27; (&quot;Őfőméltósága&quot;, literally: &quot;His/Her High Dignity&quot;) was in use in Hungary. Peers with the title of prince were entitled to it, and between 1920 and 1944, the regent, Miklós Horthy, was styled as His Serene Highness the Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary (&quot;Őfőméltósága, a Magyar Királyság kormányzója&quot;).

==Italy==
In the Republic of Venice (697–1797), also called &quot;the Most Serene Republic&quot; , &quot;la Serenìsima Repùblega&quot; in Venetian (&quot;la Serenissima Repubblica&quot; in Italian), the Doge was known as &quot;Serenissimus&quot; (&quot;Most Serene&quot;) as was the Duke of Mantua.

Children of the Savoy kings and crown princes of Italy were entitled to the treatment of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;, but more remote male-line descendants were &quot;Serene Highnesses&quot; by right (although often the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot; was granted to them &quot;ad personam&quot;, e.g., the Dukes of Aosta or the Dukes of Genoa).

The mediatised House of Thurn and Taxis, entitled to the &quot;Serene Highness&quot; treatment in the German Empire, has a non-dynastic cadet branch, the Dukes di Castel Duino, which obtained naturalization in Italy in 1923. When incorporated into the Italian nobility, their use of the &quot;Serene Highness&quot; style was authorised by the Crown.
==Liechtenstein==
See #German-speaking lands

==Mexico==
From 1853 to 1855, the president of Mexico, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, enjoyed the official style of &quot;Most Serene Highness&quot;, a treatment unique in that country.

Agustin I de Mexico gave that title to several members of his family.

==Monaco==
The reigning Prince of Monaco, Albert II, is addressed as &quot;His Serene Highness&quot;. His wife, children and younger sister, Princess Stéphanie, are also referred to as &quot;Serene Highness&quot;. His elder sister, Princess Caroline, was also styled &quot;Her Serene Highness&quot; prior to her 1999 marriage, but is styled &quot;Royal Highness&quot; since then, even during the period when she was officially &quot;The Hereditary Princess of Monaco&quot; as heiress presumptive to the throne. A particularly well known holder of this style of address was Grace Kelly, who was titled, &quot;HSH The Princess of Monaco&quot;. In French, both male and female versions are &quot;Son Altesse Sérénissime&quot; (&quot;S.A.S.&quot;), which translates, literally, as &quot;His/Her &quot;Most&quot; Serene Highness&quot;.

==Poland==
In the First Republic of Poland (1569–1795), also called &quot;the Most Serene Republic of Poland&quot; (&quot;Najjaśniejsza Rzeczpospolita Polska&quot;), His/Her &quot;Serene Reigning Majesty&quot; (SRM) was a style used by the reigning monarchs.
==Portugal==
As the most powerful noble family in Portugal, the Dukes of Braganza had the official treatment of &quot;Serene Highness&quot; until 1640, when they mounted the Portuguese throne, thereby becoming entitled to the style of &quot;Royal Highness&quot;; however, the infantes not in direct line for the throne of Portugal were titled as &quot;His/Her Highness, the Serene Infante(a)&quot;.

==Russia==
After 1886, great-grandchildren of Russian emperors in the male line were &quot;Prince[ss] of Russia&quot;, and were to be granted the treatment of &quot;Highness&quot;, and &quot;Prince[ss] of Russia&quot; with the style of &quot;Serene Highness&quot; if more distantly descended from an emperor, and born from an equal marriage (as opposed to morganatic marriage). An exception was for each eldest son of senior imperial great-grandsons (in the patrilineal descent of each son of the emperor), who retained the higher style of &quot;Highness&quot;.

During the Russian Empire, noble principalities of Khimshiashvili and Palavandishvili, whose titles was recognized by the Romanov family (whose origins are Georgian, Armenian, Ancient Roman), also used the title &quot;Serene Highness&quot; 

The Khimshiashvili family is descended from a lord titled &quot;Magister Equitum&quot; (Master of the Horse) who settled in Georgia during the Caucasus campaign of the great Roman commander Gnaeus Pompeius Magnus in 65 BC.

Strictly, the Russian term, &quot;Svetlost&quot;, was an honorific used in adjectival form (&quot;Светлейший&quot;: &quot;Svetleyshiy&quot;, Most Serene) to refer to members of a select few of Russia&#x27;s princely families (e.g. &quot;The Serene&quot; Prince Anatoly Pavlovich Lieven or &quot;The Serene&quot; Prince Dmitri Vladimirovich Golitsyn). However, when translated into non-Slavic languages and used in reference to a member of the imperial Romanov family, it was usually rendered as &quot;Serene Highness&quot;.

==San Marino==
San Marino is styled as the Most Serene Republic.

==Spain==
In 1807, Manuel de Godoy, Prince de la Paz, was accorded the style of &quot;Most Serene Highness&quot;, a treatment unique in that country at the time. Previous to this grant the style was sometimes used by the Catholic Monarch Isabella and Ferdinand as well as by other houses known anciently as illustrious or serene. A majority of these ancient houses lost the style through prescription.

The honorific () is one of the styles of the &quot;infantes&quot;.

==Thailand==
In Thailand, the title of Serene Highness is the westernized style of the Thai title of Mom Chao (&quot;His/Her Serene Highness Prince/Princess&quot; | Thai: หม่อมเจ้า), denoting the grandchild of a king through one of his princely sons. In present-day Thailand, there are very few Mom Chao left after the royal family discontinued the traditional practice of polygamous marriages, and in Thailand all royal titles and styles decrease one level every generation for those not of the immediate royal family. Therefore, the child of a Mom Chao would only have the aristocratic title of Mom Rajawongse, which would then decrease in the next generation to Mom Luang, which would then decrease further, similar to a British life peerage.
==United Kingdom==
Queen Victoria elevated each of the princes who married her daughters to &quot;Royal Highness&quot; (except for Crown Prince Friedrich of Prussia, husband of Victoria, Princess Royal, who already possessed the HRH). This included, on 30 January 1884, HSH Prince Henry of Battenberg, husband of Princess Beatrice. That couple&#x27;s children were granted the style of &quot;Highness&quot; by their British grandmother by letters patent 4 December 1886.

Several morganatic branches of reigning German dynasties took up residence in the United Kingdom in the 19th century, where their German princely titles and style of &quot;Serene Highness&quot; were recognized by the sovereign. Included in this group were Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar, Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the dukes and princes of Teck and the princes of Battenberg.

During World War I, King George V revoked recognition of the style &quot;Serene Highness&quot;, hitherto used by some relatives of the British Royal Family who used German princely titles but lived in Britain. George V&#x27;s queen consort was born &quot;&quot;Her Serene Highness&quot; Princess Mary of Teck&quot;, and Prince Philip&#x27;s mother had been born &quot;&quot;Her Serene Highness&quot; Princess Alice of Battenberg&quot;. The Tecks (descended from the royal House of Württemberg) and the Battenbergs (descended from the Grand Dukes of Hesse and by Rhine) were compensated with multiple peerages, &quot;viz.&quot; Marquess of Cambridge and Earl of Athlone for the former, and Marquess of Milford Haven and Marquess of Carisbrooke for the latter.

<text>The Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party (, ) was a minor political party in Pakistan formed in 1995 by the unification of the Communist Party of Pakistan (CPP) and the Major Ishaque faction of the Mazdoor Kisan Party (MKP).

In 2015, it merged with the Pakistan Mazdoor Kissan Party, forming the current Mazdoor Kisan Party which is headed by Afzal Khamosh.

==History==
The break-up of the Soviet Union had an enormous impact on the left in Pakistan, as elsewhere in the world. A great number of factions abandoned Marxism and the Communist movement. At this difficult juncture in history the CPP and Major Ishaque&#x27;s MKP group (one of three factions resulting from a split in the MKP in 1978) came together to engage in criticism and self-criticism and form the Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party in 1995.

In 1999, much of the former Communist Party of Pakistan broke away and reconstituted itself as a separate party.

In 2003, after further organizational problems and ideological disagreements, a large section of the Communist Mazdoor Kissan Party separated and reformed the Major Ishaque MKP group, whereas a group led by Sufi Abdul Khaliq Baloch and Taimur Rahman remained aligned with CMKP and its Marxist–Leninist program.

In late 2009, CMKP faced yet another split when several long-time members, including Sufi Abdul Khaliq Baloch, separated from the party and joined the Workers Party of Pakistan, a broad-left political party. CMKP continued as a distinct Marxist–Leninist-Stalinist Party. Taimur Rahman, the former General Secretary of the CMKP, stopped working with and being a part of CMKP. Instead, the party was led by central committee member Mehfoz Khan Shujaat from Multan, with Hkmat Shaw from Hashtnagar as party president.

On 14 February 2015, it merged with Peoples National Congress to form Peoples Mazdoor Kissan Party.

On 20 December 2015, Peoples Mazdoor Kissan Party merged with Pakistan Mazdoor Kissan Party forming a new party named Mazdoor Kissan Party. 

==Politics and influence==

The party&#x27;s politics were based on Major Ishaq&#x27;s philosophy, and were focused on working with the peasantry of Pakistan. It arranged study circles regularly throughout the country and had an official circular named &quot;Awami Morcha&quot;, which was edited by Mehfoz Khan Shujaat and published regularly.

CMKP saw the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor as a neocolonization of Pakistan and believed it would damage the people of Pakistan.

<doc id="1106087" wikidata="Q1114427" url="?curid=1106087" title="Karak District">
<text>Karak District (, ) is a district in Kohat Division of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province in Pakistan. It is situated to the south of Kohat District and on the north side of Bannu and Lakki Marwat districts on the main Indus Highway between Peshawar and Karachi – it is 131 km from the provincial capital Peshawar. It gained a district status in 1982, prior to which it was part of Kohat District.

It is natively inhabited by the Khattak Pashtun tribe who make the majority of the population.

==Demographics==
As of the 2023 census, Karak district has 95,997 households and a population of 815,878. The district has a sex ratio of 106.77 males to 100 females and a literacy rate of 65.36%: 84.12% for males and 45.60% for females. 241,923 (29.68% of the surveyed population) are under 10 years of age. 58,065 (7.12%) live in urban areas. 2,424 (0.30% of the surveyed population) are from religious minorities, almost entirely Christians. Pashto is the predominant language, spoken by 99.78% of the surveyed population.

=== Religion ===
== Resources ==
There are several natural resources that have been discovered in Karak. The salt mines were well known in antiquity and a major source of salt for the Indian subcontinent into British imperial times. More recently oil, gas, and uranium have all been discovered. Oil and gas reservoirs have been found in the towns of Makori, Noshpa Banda, Gurguri and Lachi circle.

Oil and gas reservoirs explored in Karak district are producing 7000 barrels of oil and 2500 cubic feet gas on a daily basis which is a record production from one oil well in the country. The oil and gas reservoirs at Noshapa Banda in district Karak are generating millions of rupees revenue daily. District Karak has mineral resources and many national and international companies and OGDCL are busy in oil and gas exploration in different areas of the district. Vast reservoirs of oil and gas have been explored in Gurguri and Noshpa Banda areas of the district so far whereas exploration is under way in other areas.

According to a serve conducted by International Nuclear Information System
 where Fission Track Technique has been applied for the estimation of uranium in 30 drinking water sources of Tehsil Takht-e-Nasrati ,Shnawa Gudi khill and District Karak, Kpk, Pakistan. These samples have mean, minimum and maximum concentration of uranium of 13.45 +- 3.207, 1.07 +- 0.6, 84.23 +- 15.63 micro g l/sup -1/, respectively. The significant finding was the observation of very high level of uranium in drinking water sources obtained from uranium rich bedrocks than the safe limit of WHO (15 micro g l/sup -1/) for human consumption. On the basis of this study, it was concluded that the origin of uranium is potentially due to one of the Asia richest mineral deposit of uranium in Karak, Pakistan. The results could be of vital concern in diagnosis and prognosis of uranium induced disease in the local population under investigation.

=== Representation in Assemblies ===
==Administrative divisions==
The district of Karak is administratively subdivided into three Tehsils.
Shortly after Annexation by British in 1849 Kohat was District with Three Tehsils, Kohat, Hangu and Teri tehsil. Hangu and Teri tehsils was granted to khan on lease. Teri tesil was subdivided into tappas (equal to today Union council) under tapedars and Villages under following khans:

<text>SBK Records was a record label, owned by Universal Music Group, that is currently part of the Capitol Music Group, where it is in hibernation. The label was founded in 1988 and during its time in activity existed as part of the EMI Group.

==History==
Stephen Swid, Martin Bandier and Charles Koppelman formed SBK Entertainment in 1989 after they purchased the music publishing division of CBS Records, CBS Songs, in 1986 for $125 million. CBS Songs was subsequently renamed to SBK Songs. The name is an acronym incorporating the first letter of the founders&#x27; surnames.

The partners sold the company to EMI Music Publishing (for a reported US$295 million), afterward SBK Songs was renamed EMI Songs and with support of Capitol Records launched SBK Records. It was distributed through the short-lived EMI Records Group North America, or ERG. In 1989, Daniel Glass joined SBK as Senior Vice President of Promotion. In 1990, Glass was promoted to Executive Vice President/General Manager. With the consolidation of SBK, Chrysalis USA, Wild Pitch and EMI Records USA several years later into EMI Records Group North America, he rose to President-CEO.

The label had several hits with Vanilla Ice, Waterfront, Jesus Jones, Boy George, Wilson Phillips, Grayson Hugh, Jon Secada, Ya Kid K, McQueen Street, Technotronic, Blur, Billy Dean and Everyday People.

SBK Records was part of the EMI Group, but became dormant as of 2007, when Martin Bandier left EMI Music Publishing for Sony Corp.&#x27;s Sony Music Publishing. EMI (and SBK Entertainment World assets) was sold in 2012 to two different entities and split up with most of the recorded music division to Universal and music publishing division to Sony-led consortium.

SBK also signed the first Latino MC to a major label, Ray Roll, from the famed Rock Steady Crew, and Selena, the first female crossover Latin artist.

The 1994 album &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot; by Milla Jovovich was released through SBK and was critically acclaimed. The album is still in print since its release.

It also published the first ever &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot; album &quot;Barney&#x27;s Favorites, Volume 1&quot;.

SBK music publishing catalog (SBK/EMI Songs and April Music) is now controlled by Sony Music Publishing, and the recorded music catalog is now controlled by Universal Music Group.

SBK Records was shut down in July 1997, with all of its employees being let go.

<text>Chew Valley Lake () is a reservoir in Chew Stoke, Chew Valley, Somerset, England. It is the fifth-largest artificial lake in the United Kingdom, with an area of . The lake, created in the early 1950s, was opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 1956. It provides much of the drinking water for the city of Bristol and surrounding area, taking its supply from the Mendip Hills. Some of the lake water is used to maintain the flow in the River Chew.

Before the lake was created, archaeological investigations were carried out that showed evidence of occupation since Neolithic times and included Roman artefacts. The lake is an important site for wildlife and has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Protection Area (SPA). It is a national centre for birdwatching, with over 260 species recorded. The lake has indigenous and migrant water birds throughout the year, and two nature trails have been created. The flora and fauna provide habitats for some less common plants and insects.

Some restricted use for recreational activities is permitted by the owner, Bristol Water, including dinghy sailing and fishing, primarily for trout.

== Location ==
Chew Valley Lake is in the Chew Valley at the northern edge of the Mendip Hills, surrounded by meadows and woods and close to the villages of Chew Stoke, Chew Magna and Bishop Sutton. When it was built in the 1950s, its 1,200 acres (4.9 km2) were flooded with 4,500 million imperial gallons (20,000,000 m3) of water from the Mendip hills, with a catchment area of 14,000 acres (57 km2). It is shallow, with an average depth of 14 ft (4 m) at top level and a maximum depth of just 37 ft (11 m). It is fed by small rivers, and it flows into the River Chew for 17 miles (27 km) before it joins the Avon to head out to sea. The deepest part is near the dam and the outlet tower, where the steeply sloping shores of Walley Bank and the north shore result in depths of up to 20 ft (6 m). &quot;Denny Island&quot;, above the surface throughout the year, is wooded and provides a habitat for wildlife.

The lake is owned and operated by Bristol Water, which created it in 1956 when the demand became too large for nearby Blagdon Lake. Working with the Avon Wildlife Trust, Somerset Wildlife Trust and other environmental groups, Bristol Water has encouraged various species of birds and plants, and created a venue for visitors.

It has two landscaped picnic areas. Facilities include a tea shop, with indoor and outdoor seating areas with a view of the lake, and information centre. There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery and two nature trails. The Grebe Trail is a hard-surfaced, all-weather path suitable for pedestrians, pushchairs and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0.75 miles (1.2 km) long, starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area. The Bittern Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy path is often waterlogged in winter, but there is a boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.

== Access and transportation ==

Access to the waterside is restricted in places to reduce the disruption to wildlife. Paths around the lake are generally flat and, where paths are surfaced, wheelchair access is possible.

Visitors are officially invited to use public transport, but overwhelmingly arrive by private car, encouraged by the provision of parking spaces. The &quot;Chew Valley Explorer&quot; bus route 672/674 provides access.

In 2002 a 1.9-mile (3-kilometre) safe cycle route, the Chew Lake West Green Route, was opened along the B3114 on the western part of the lake. It forms part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way, National Cycle Network Route 3. It has all-weather surfacing, providing a smooth off-road facility for ramblers, mobility-challenged visitors and cyclists of all abilities. It was funded by Bath and North East Somerset Council with the support of Sustrans and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association. Minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists.

Bristol Airport is approximately 10 miles (15 km) away. The nearest major road is the A368, which runs along the southern edge of the lake and provides access from Bath and Weston super Mare. The A37 and A38 are slightly further away, providing access from Bristol. The lake is also easily accessible from the M5 motorway at junctions 18 and 22, with visitors instructed to follow signs to Bristol Airport. Car parking is available at the visitor centre and Woodford Lodge, for which a charge is made, and a small amount of parking is available at points around the lake; some of these are restricted to those with fishing permits.

== History ==
The area the lake covers was once rich farmland. Farms and houses had to be removed before the land was flooded, and old roads, hedgerows and tree stumps can reappear when dry summers cause the level of the lake to drop. Prior to the flooding of the reservoir, archaeological excavations were carried out by Philip Rahtz and Ernest Greenfield employed by the Ministry of Works, from 1953 to 1955. The excavations found evidence of people belonging to the consecutive periods known as Upper Palaeolithic, Mesolithic and Neolithic (Old, Middle and New Stone Age), Bronze Age and Iron Age, including implements such as stone knives, flint blades and the head of a mace, along with buildings and graves. The artefacts from this period are held at Bristol Museum &amp; Art Gallery. Further evidence of Neolithic and Bronze Age occupation is provided by the archaeological survey of the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.
Excavations have also uncovered Roman remains, indicating agricultural and industrial activity from the second half of the first century to third century AD. The finds included a villa at Chew Park where wooden writing tablets (the first in the UK) with ink writing were found. The tablets were sent to the British Museum, but other Roman material is on display at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery with the lake&#x27;s other historical artefacts.

Further excavations around the village of Moreton, which has now been totally submerged, found evidence of a thriving community in medieval times and possibly the remains of the Nunnery of Santa Cruz. During the Middle Ages farming was the most important activity in the area covered by the lake, supported by four flour mills powered by the River Chew. Stratford Mill was demolished and re-erected in the grounds of Blaise Castle Museum, in north-west Bristol. The largest settlement was Moreton, which is listed in the Domesday Book of 1086, and survived until the flooding of the lake, when the remains of the Moreton Cross were moved to Chew Stoke Parish Church. There is evidence of lime kilns, which were used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches. Farming, both arable and dairy, continued until the flooding of the lake, with most households also keeping pigs. There were orchards for fruit production, including apples, pears and plums. Moreton was also the site of a gunpowder mill in the 18th century.

=== Reservoir ===
Plans for the building of the reservoir were under discussion before the Second World War, and an act of parliament submitted by the Bristol Waterworks Company was passed in 1939. Following this, farms were bought by the company and farmed by the previous owners as tenancies. Farms and buildings still remaining in private hands were acquired by compulsory purchase. The sanction for construction was given in 1949 and the contract awarded to A.E. Farr, who employed 300 people on the site. The main dam was stabilised by injecting concrete into the cracks in the bedrock. The core of the dam was made of puddled clay mixed with sand. This was the first time the gain in strength brought about by the use of sand drains had been quantified. The lake was inaugurated by Queen Elizabeth II, accompanied by Prince Philip, with the unveiling of a commemorative stone and plaque, which can be seen from the dam, on 17 April 1956, although it was not full until 25 February 1958. Flowers were presented to the Queen at the opening of Chew Valley Lake by Judith Blair Brown, daughter of Kennedy Brown, who worked at Bristol Water Works at the time of construction of the lake.

During the storm of 10 July 1968, the lake gained an extra 471 million imperial gallons (2,140,000 m3) and rose 19 inches (480 mm) in under 12 hours. At one point worried Bristol police issued a warning that the dam might not hold, prompting localised evacuation of populated valley areas downstream including Pensford and Keynsham.

== Ecology ==
The lake is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a Special Protection Area (SPA) (Site Code: UK9010041) largely because of the diversity of species and habitats. Providing further protection, much of the area around the lake also falls within the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB).

The lake appears to have a higher sedimentation rate than would be expected in other similar reservoirs, being in the region of 100–150 t.km−2.yr−1.

=== Geology ===
The main geological outcrops around the lake are mudstone, largely consisting of red siltstone resulting in the underlying characteristic of the gently rolling valley landscape. Bands of sandstone from the Triassic period contribute to the undulating character of the area. There are also more recent alluvial deposits beside the course of the River Chew.

=== Birds ===

Over 270 species of birds have been recorded at Chew, an internationally important site for wintering and migrating wildfowl. From late July to February, up to 4,000 ducks (Anatidae) of twelve different species may be present, including internationally important numbers of northern shoveler (&quot;Anas clypeata&quot;) and gadwall (&quot;Anas strepera&quot;). Up to 600 great crested grebes (&quot;Podiceps cristatus&quot;) gather to moult on the lake in autumn. Data on bird species and their numbers on the lake, dating back to the first &quot;ringing&quot; in 1964, is available from the Chew Valley Ringing Station.

Numerous other birds can be seen, especially during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (&quot;Riparia riparia&quot;) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in the second or third week of March. Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (&quot;Vanellus vanellus&quot;), dunlin (&quot;Calidris alpina&quot;) and common snipe (&quot;Gallinago gallinago&quot;), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (&quot;Chroicocephalus ridibundus&quot;) and common gull (&quot;Larus canus&quot;), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (&quot;Acrocephalus scirpaceus&quot;) and sedge warblers (&quot;A. schoenobaenus&quot;) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (&quot;Fulica atra&quot;).

Much of the management work carried out in the nature reserve is aimed at encouraging ducks to breed, and small numbers of tufted duck (&quot;Aythya fuligula&quot;), common pochard (&quot;Aythya ferina&quot;), common shelduck (&quot;Tadorna tadorna&quot;) and gadwall raise broods most years. Recent breeding successes also include water rail (&quot;Rallus aquaticus&quot;) and Cetti&#x27;s warbler (&quot;Cettia cetti&quot;).

A wetland reserve has been created at Heron&#x27;s Green Pool on the opposite side of the causeway to the lake. A shallow pool fringed with sedges (Cyperaceae), rushes (Juncaceae) and reedgrasses (&quot;Calamagrostis&quot;) and surrounded by lightly grazed, rough grassland may also prove attractive to snipe and lapwings.

=== Fish ===
In late summer large shoals of roach (&quot;Rutilus rutilus&quot;) and perch (&quot;Perca fluviatilis&quot;) fry congregate around the margins and weed beds, which are predated by the brown trout (&quot;Salmo trutta&quot; morpha &quot;fario&quot;) and rainbow trout (&quot;Oncorhynchus mykiss&quot;). Chew Valley also holds a large population of pike (&quot;Esox lucius&quot;), and fishing for these is permitted at certain times of the year. Chew Valley currently holds the UK record at 47lb 5oz.

=== Insects ===
Aquatic midges (Chironomidae) provide the highest proportion of the fly life of the lake. The trout (Salmonidae) will feed at the surface on these and water boatmen (Corixidae), and below the surface on the caddisfly (Trichoptera) larvae and pupae; they will also take the adult caddisflies when they emerge. Other aquatic fauna including &quot;daphnia&quot; and snails are also found in the lake. Large populations of dragonflies, including migrant hawker (&quot;Aeshna mixta&quot;) and significant numbers of ruddy darter (&quot;Sympetrum sanguineum&quot;), occur at the lake. Eleven species of wainscot moth make their home in the reed beds, including the nationally local brown-veined wainscot (&quot;Archanara dissoluta&quot;), twin-spotted wainscot (&quot;Archanara geminipuncta&quot;) and silky wainscot (&quot;Chilodes maritimus&quot;).

=== Vegetation ===
The lake is surrounded with fringing reedbeds, carr woodland and grassland, which are managed by Bristol Water. The water conditions are eutrophic with run off from local fields and streams. Open-water plant communities are rather sparse, largely comprising fennel pondweed (&quot;Potamogeton pectinatus&quot;), lesser pondweed (&quot;Potamogeton pusillus&quot;), opposite-leaved pondweed (&quot;Groenlandia densa&quot;) and water-crowfoot (&quot;Ranunculus spp.&quot;). On neutral soils around the reservoir, pepper-saxifrage (&quot;Silaum silaus&quot;), burnet-saxifrage (&quot;Pimpinella saxifraga&quot;) and devil&#x27;s-bit scabious (&quot;Succisa pratensis&quot;) occur, and on calcareous soils fairy flax (&quot;Linum catharticum&quot;), dwarf thistle (&quot;Cirsium acaule&quot;) and salad burnet (&quot;Sanguisorba minor&quot; subspecies &quot;minor&quot;) are found.

The small and medium-sized fields around the lake are generally bounded by hedges and occasionally by tree belts and woodland, some of which date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Mature oak (&quot;Quercus&quot;) and ash (&quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;) trees are characteristic of the area with occasional groups of Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;) and chestnuts (&quot;Castanea sativa&quot;). Many elm (&quot;Ulmus&quot;) trees have been lost in this area, and dead/dying elms are also evident in the surrounding landscape.

Four areas of woodland containing 157 trees has been planted by The Life for a Life Charity around the lake on the Restaurant side, for the cremated remains of loved ones to be placed beneath them. These forests contain Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;), English oak (&quot;Quercus robur&quot;), rowan (&quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot;) and the silver birch (&quot;Betula pendula&quot;).

== Leisure use ==
The lake is used for a wide variety of leisure pursuits.

=== Birdwatching ===
During 2005–2006 Bristol Water started restoring two artificial islands. These are intended to provide safe nesting and roosting sites for a range of wildfowl. Permits to enter the reservoir enclosure and to use the access roads, paths and bird hides are available (for a fee) only to members of ornithological and naturalist societies recognised by Bristol Water. They can be obtained from Woodford Lodge and include conditions of use imposed by the owners.

=== Sailing ===

Chew Valley Lake Sailing Club has a sailing area, approximately 1.9 miles (3 km) long, for dinghy sailing. The lake is divided into two areas: a restricted summer area which is available during the fishing season (mid-March to mid-October), and the full area which can be used throughout the winter and on Sunday afternoons. The sailing area is marked out by lines of small white buoys. Racing marks are red buoys with flags, although large inflatable marks are used of open events.

The club can cater for fleets of over one hundred boats and it hosts large national events. Normal club racing has fleet starts for the following dinghy classes: Flying Fifteen (keelboat), Laser (dinghy), Solo (dinghy) and Topper (dinghy) as well as a handicap fleet run under the Portsmouth yardstick scheme. Five slipways enable easy launching. Off the water, the clubhouse facilities include large changing rooms, hot showers, hot food at the weekends, a bar and terrace overlooking the lake. The club caters for disabled people with facilities on both floors and a lift. Royal Yachting Association sailing courses are held at the club for members including race training, youth training, powerboat training, race officer training as well as more informal training run within each fleet.

=== Fishing ===

Bristol water control fishing in the lake requiring permits and restricting the areas which can be used. Motor boats can also be booked for fishing.

<doc id="1106101" wikidata="Q10747346" url="?curid=1106101" title="Radiation hormesis">
<text>Radiation hormesis is the hypothesis that low doses of ionizing radiation (within the region of and just above natural background levels) are beneficial, stimulating the activation of repair mechanisms that protect against disease, that are not activated in absence of ionizing radiation. The reserve repair mechanisms are hypothesized to be sufficiently effective when stimulated as to not only cancel the detrimental effects of ionizing radiation but also inhibit disease not related to radiation exposure (see hormesis). It has been a mainstream concept since at least 2009.

While the effects of high and acute doses of ionising radiation are easily observed and understood in humans (&quot;e.g.&quot; Japanese atomic bomb survivors), the effects of low-level radiation are very difficult to observe and highly controversial. This is because the baseline cancer rate is already very high and the risk of developing cancer fluctuates 40% because of individual life style and environmental effects, obscuring the subtle effects of low-level radiation. An acute effective dose of 100 millisieverts may increase cancer risk by ~0.8%. However, children are particularly sensitive to radioactivity, with childhood leukemias and other cancers increasing even within natural and man-made background radiation levels (under 4 mSv cumulative with 1 mSv being an average annual dose from terrestrial and cosmic radiation, excluding radon which primarily doses the lung). There is limited evidence that exposures around this dose level will cause negative subclinical health impacts to neural development. Students born in regions of higher Chernobyl fallout performed worse in secondary school, particularly in mathematics. &quot;Damage is accentuated within families (i.e., siblings comparison) and among children born to parents with low education...&quot; who often don&#x27;t have the resources to overcome this additional health challenge.

Hormesis remains largely unknown to the public. Government and regulatory bodies disagree on the existence of radiation hormesis and research points to the &quot;severe problems and limitations&quot; with the use of hormesis in general as the &quot;principal dose-response default assumption in a risk assessment process charged with
ensuring public health protection.&quot;

Quoting results from a literature database research, the Académie des Sciences – Académie nationale de Médecine (French Academy of Sciences – National Academy of Medicine) stated in their 2005 report concerning the effects of low-level radiation that many laboratory studies have observed radiation hormesis. However, they cautioned that it is not yet known if radiation hormesis occurs outside the laboratory, or in humans.

Reports by the United States National Research Council and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) argue that there is no evidence for hormesis in humans and in the case of the National Research Council hormesis is outright rejected as a possibility. Therefore, estimating linear no-threshold model (LNT) continues to be the model generally used by regulatory agencies for human radiation exposure.

== Proposed mechanism and ongoing debate ==

Radiation hormesis proposes that radiation exposure comparable to and just above the natural background level of radiation is not harmful but beneficial, while accepting that much higher levels of radiation are hazardous. Proponents of radiation hormesis typically claim that radio-protective responses in cells and the immune system not only counter the harmful effects of radiation but additionally act to inhibit spontaneous cancer not related to radiation exposure. Radiation hormesis stands in stark contrast to the more generally accepted linear no-threshold model (LNT), which states that the radiation dose-risk relationship is linear across all doses, so that small doses are still damaging, albeit less so than higher ones. Opinion pieces on chemical and radiobiological hormesis appeared in the journals Nature and Science in 2003.

Assessing the risk of radiation at low doses (&lt;100 mSv) and low dose rates (&lt;0.1 mSv.min−1) is highly problematic and controversial. While epidemiological studies on populations of people exposed to an acute dose of high level radiation such as Japanese atomic bomb survivors () have robustly upheld the LNT (mean dose ~210 mSv), studies involving low doses and low dose rates have failed to detect any increased cancer rate. This is because the baseline cancer rate is already very high (~42 of 100 people will be diagnosed in their lifetime) and it fluctuates ~40% because of lifestyle and environmental effects, obscuring the subtle effects of low level radiation. Epidemiological studies may be capable of detecting elevated cancer rates as low as 1.2 to 1.3 &quot;i.e.&quot; 20% to 30% increase. But for low doses (1–100 mSv) the predicted elevated risks are only 1.001 to 1.04 and excess cancer cases, if present, cannot be detected due to confounding factors, errors and biases.

In particular, variations in smoking prevalence or even accuracy in reporting smoking cause wide variation in excess cancer and measurement error bias. Thus, even a large study of many thousands of subjects with imperfect smoking prevalence information will fail to detect the effects of low level radiation than a smaller study that properly compensates for smoking prevalence. Given the absence of direct epidemiological evidence, there is considerable debate as to whether the dose-response relationship &lt;100 mSv is supralinear, linear (LNT), has a threshold, is &quot;sub-linear&quot;, or whether the coefficient is negative with a sign change, i.e. a hormetic response.

The radiation adaptive response seems to be a main origin of the potential hormetic effect. The theoretical studies indicate that the adaptive response is responsible for the shape of dose-response curve and can transform the linear relationship (LNT) into the hormetic one.

While most major consensus reports and government bodies currently adhere to LNT, the 2005 French Academy of Sciences-National Academy of Medicine&#x27;s report concerning the effects of low-level radiation rejected LNT as a scientific model of carcinogenic risk at low doses.

Using LNT to estimate the carcinogenic effect at doses of less than 20 mSv is not justified in the light of current radiobiologic knowledge.

They consider there to be several dose-effect relationships rather than only one, and that these relationships have many variables such as target tissue, radiation dose, dose rate and individual sensitivity factors. They request that further study is required on low doses (less than 100 mSv) and very low doses (less than 10 mSv) as well as the impact of tissue type and age. The Academy considers the LNT model is only useful for regulatory purposes as it simplifies the administrative task. Quoting results from literature research, they furthermore claim that approximately 40% of laboratory studies on cell cultures and animals indicate some degree of chemical or radiobiological hormesis, and state:

...its existence in the laboratory is beyond question and its mechanism of action appears well understood.

They go on to outline a growing body of research that illustrates that the human body is not a passive accumulator of radiation damage but it actively repairs the damage caused via a number of different processes, including:

* Mechanisms that mitigate reactive oxygen species generated by ionizing radiation and oxidative stress.
* Apoptosis of radiation damaged cells that may undergo tumorigenesis is initiated at only few mSv.
* Cell death during meiosis of radiation damaged cells that were unsuccessfully repaired.
* The existence of a cellular signaling system that alerts neighboring cells of cellular damage.
* The activation of enzymatic DNA repair mechanisms around 10 mSv.
* Modern DNA microarray studies which show that numerous genes are activated at radiation doses well below the level that mutagenesis is detected.
* Radiation-induced tumorigenesis may have a threshold related to damage density, as revealed by experiments that employ blocking grids to thinly distribute radiation.
* A large increase in tumours in immunosuppressed individuals illustrates that the immune system efficiently destroys aberrant cells and nascent tumors.

Furthermore, increased sensitivity to radiation induced cancer in the inherited condition Ataxia-telangiectasia like disorder, illustrates the damaging effects of loss of the repair gene Mre11h resulting in the inability to fix DNA double-strand breaks.

The BEIR-VII report argued that, &quot;the presence of a true dose threshold demands totally error-free DNA damage response and repair.&quot; The specific damage they worry about is double strand breaks (DSBs) and they continue, &quot;error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair in postirradiation cellular response, argues strongly against a DNA repair-mediated low-dose threshold for cancer initiation&quot;. Recent research observed that DSBs caused by CAT scans are repaired within 24 hours and DSBs may be more efficiently repaired at low doses, suggesting that the risk of ionizing radiation at low doses may not be directly proportional to the dose. However, it is not known if low-dose ionizing radiation stimulates the repair of DSBs not caused by ionizing radiation &quot;i.e.&quot; a hormetic response. 
Radon gas in homes is the largest source of radiation dose for most individuals and it is generally advised that the concentration be kept below 150 Bq/m³ (4 pCi/L). A recent retrospective case-control study of lung cancer risk showed substantial cancer rate reduction between 50 and 123 Bq per cubic meter relative to a group at zero to 25 Bq per cubic meter. This study is cited as evidence for hormesis, but a single study all by itself cannot be regarded as definitive. Other studies into the effects of domestic radon exposure have not reported a hormetic effect; including for example the respected &quot;Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study&quot; of Field et al. (2000), which also used sophisticated radon exposure dosimetry. In addition, Darby et al. (2005) argue that radon exposure is negatively correlated with the tendency to smoke and environmental studies need to accurately control for this; people living in urban areas where smoking rates are higher usually have lower levels of radon exposure due to the increased prevalence of multi-story dwellings. When doing so, they found a significant increase in lung cancer amongst smokers exposed to radon at doses as low as 100 to 199 Bq m−3 and warned that smoking greatly increases the risk posed by radon exposure &quot;i.e.&quot; reducing the prevalence of smoking would decrease deaths caused by radon. However, the discussion about the opposite experimental results is still going on, especially the popular US and German studies have found some hormetic effects.

Furthermore, particle microbeam studies show that passage of even a single alpha particle (e.g. from radon and its progeny) through cell nuclei is highly mutagenic, and that alpha radiation may have a higher mutagenic effect at low doses (even if a small fraction of cells are hit by alpha particles) than predicted by linear no-threshold model, a phenomenon attributed to bystander effect. However, there is currently insufficient evidence at hand to suggest that the bystander effect promotes carcinogenesis in humans at low doses.

==Statements by leading nuclear bodies==

Radiation hormesis has not been accepted by either the United States National Research Council, or the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP). In May 2018, the NCRP published the report of an interdisciplinary group of radiation experts who critically reviewed 29 high-quality epidemiologic studies of populations exposed to radiation in the low dose and low dose-rate range, mostly published within the last 10 years. The group of experts concluded:

 The recent epidemiologic studies support the continued use of the LNT model for radiation protection. This is in accord with judgments by other national and international scientific committees, based on somewhat older data, that no alternative dose-response relationship appears more pragmatic or prudent for radiation protection purposes than the LNT model.

In addition, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) wrote in its 2000 report:
 Until the [...] uncertainties on low-dose response are resolved, the Committee believes that an increase in the risk of tumour induction proportionate to the radiation dose is consistent with developing knowledge and that it remains, accordingly, the most scientifically defensible approximation of low-dose response. However, a strictly linear dose response should not be expected in all circumstances.

This is a reference to the fact that very low doses of radiation have only marginal impacts on individual health outcomes. It is therefore difficult to detect the &#x27;signal&#x27; of decreased or increased morbidity and mortality due to low-level radiation exposure in the &#x27;noise&#x27; of other effects. The notion of radiation hormesis has been rejected by the National Research Council&#x27;s (part of the National Academy of Sciences) 16-year-long study on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation. &quot;The scientific research base shows that there is no threshold of exposure below which low levels of ionizing radiation can be demonstrated to be harmless or beneficial. The health risks – particularly the development of solid cancers in organs – rise proportionally with exposure&quot; says Richard R. Monson, associate dean for professional education and professor of epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston.

== Studies of low-level radiation ==

=== Cancer rates and very high natural background gamma radiation at Kerala, India ===

Kerala&#x27;s monazite sand (containing a third of the world&#x27;s economically recoverable reserves of radioactive thorium) emits about 8 microsieverts per hour of gamma radiation, 80 times the dose rate equivalent in London, but a decade-long study of 69,985 residents published in Health Physics in 2009 &quot;showed no excess cancer risk from exposure to terrestrial gamma radiation. The excess relative risk of cancer excluding leukemia was estimated to be −0.13 per Gy (95% CI: −0.58, 0.46)&quot;, indicating no statistically significant positive or negative relationship between background radiation levels and cancer risk in this sample.

=== Cultures ===

Studies in cell cultures can be useful for finding mechanisms for biological processes, but they also can be criticized for not effectively capturing the whole of the living organism.

A study by E. I. Azzam suggested that pre-exposure to radiation causes cells to turn on protection mechanisms. A different study by de Toledo and collaborators has shown that irradiation with gamma rays increases the concentration of glutathione, an antioxidant found in cells.

In 2011, an &quot;in vitro&quot; study led by S. V. Costes showed in time-lapse images a strongly non-linear response of certain cellular repair mechanisms called radiation-induced foci (RIF). The study found that low doses of radiation prompted higher rates of RIF formation than high doses, and that after low-dose exposure RIF continued to form after the radiation had ended. Measured rates of RIF formation were 15 RIF/Gy at 2 Gy, and 64 RIF/Gy at 0.1 Gy. These results suggest that low dose levels of ionizing radiation may not increase cancer risk directly proportional to dose and thus contradict the linear-no-threshold standard model. Mina Bissell, a world-renowned breast-cancer researcher and collaborator in this study stated: &quot;Our data show that at lower doses of ionizing radiation, DNA repair mechanisms work much better than at higher doses. This non-linear DNA damage response casts doubt on the general assumption that any amount of ionizing radiation is harmful and additive.&quot;

=== Animals ===
An early study on mice exposed to low dose of radiation daily (0.11 R per day) suggest that they may outlive control animals. A study by Otsuka and collaborators found hormesis in animals. Miyachi conducted a study on mice and found that a 200 mGy X-ray dose protects mice against both further X-ray exposure and ozone gas. In another rodent study, Sakai and collaborators found that (1 mGy/h) gamma irradiation prevents the development of cancer (induced by chemical means, injection of methylcholanthrene).

In a 2006 paper, a dose of 1 Gy was delivered to the cells (at constant rate from a radioactive source) over a series of lengths of time. These were between 8.77 and 87.7 hours, the abstract states for a dose delivered over 35 hours or more (low dose rate) no transformation of the cells occurred. Also for the 1 Gy dose delivered over 8.77 to 18.3 hours that the biological effect (neoplastic transformation) was about &quot;1.5 times less than that measured at high dose rate in previous studies with a similar quality of [X-ray] radiation&quot;. Likewise it has been reported that fractionation of gamma irradiation reduces the likelihood of a neoplastic transformation. Pre-exposure to fast neutrons and gamma rays from Cs-137 is reported to increase the ability of a second dose to induce a neoplastic transformation.

Caution must be used in interpreting these results, as it noted in the BEIR VII report, these pre-doses can also increase cancer risk:

However, 75 mGy/d cannot be accurately described as a low dose rate – it is equivalent to over 27 sieverts per year. The same study on dogs showed no increase in cancer nor reduction in life expectancy for dogs irradiated at 3 mGy/d.

=== Humans ===

==== Effects of slightly increased radiation level ====

In long-term study of Chernobyl disaster liquidators was found that: &quot;During current research paradoxically longer telomeres were found among persons, who have received heavier long-term irradiation.&quot; and &quot;Mortality due to oncologic diseases was lower than in general population in all age groups that may reflect efficient health care of this group.&quot; Though in conclusion interim results were ignored and conclusion followed LNT hypothesis: &quot;The signs of premature aging were found in Chernobyl disaster clean-up workers; moreover, aging process developed in heavier form and at younger age in humans, who underwent greater exposure to ionizing radiation.&quot;

A study of survivors of the Hirsohima atomic bomb explosion yielded similar results.

====Effects of sunlight exposure====
In an Australian study which analyzed the association between solar UV exposure and DNA damage, the results indicated that although the frequency of cells with chromosome breakage increased with increasing sun exposure, the misrepair of DNA strand breaks decreased as sun exposure was heightened.

====Effects of cobalt-60 exposure====
The health of the inhabitants of radioactive apartment buildings in Taiwan has received prominent attention. In 1982, more than 20,000 tons of steel was accidentally contaminated with cobalt-60, and much of this radioactive steel was used to build apartments and exposed thousands of Taiwanese to gamma radiation levels of up to &gt;1000 times background (average 47.7 mSv, maximum 2360 mSv excess cumulative dose). The radioactive contamination was discovered in 1992.

A seriously flawed 2004 study compared the building&#x27;s younger residents with the much older general population of Taiwan and determined that the younger residents were less likely to have been diagnosed with cancer than older people; this was touted as evidence of a radiation hormesis effect. (Older people have much higher cancer rates even in the absence of excess radiation exposure.)

In the years shortly after exposure, the total number cancer cases have been reported to be either lower than the society-wide average or slightly elevated. Leukaemia and thyroid cancer were substantially elevated. When a lower rate of &quot;all cancers&quot; was found, it was thought to be due to the exposed residents having a higher socioeconomic status, and thus overall healthier lifestyle. Additionally, Hwang, et al. cautioned in 2006 that leukaemia was the first cancer type found to be elevated amongst the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, so it could be decades before any increase in more common cancer types is seen.

Besides the excess risks of leukaemia and thyroid cancer, a later publication notes various DNA anomalies and other health effects among the exposed population:

There have been several reports concerning the radiation effects on the exposed population, including cytogenetic analysis that showed increased micronucleus frequencies in peripheral lymphocytes in the exposed population, increases in acentromeric and single or multiple centromeric cytogenetic damages, and higher frequencies of chromosomal translocations, rings and dicentrics. Other analyses have shown persistent depression of peripheral leucocytes and neutrophils, increased eosinophils, altered distributions of lymphocyte subpopulations, increased frequencies of lens opacities, delays in physical development among exposed children, increased risk of thyroid abnormalities, and late consequences in hematopoietic adaptation in children.

People living in these buildings also experienced infertility.

==== Radon therapy ====

Intentional exposure to water and air containing increased amounts of radon is perceived as therapeutic, and &quot;radon spas&quot; can be found in United States, Czechia, Poland, Germany, Austria and other countries.

==Effects of no radiation==

Given the uncertain effects of low-level and very-low-level radiation, there is a pressing need for quality research in this area. An expert panel convened at the 2006 Ultra-Low-Level Radiation Effects Summit at Carlsbad, New Mexico, proposed the construction of an Ultra-Low-Level Radiation laboratory. The laboratory, if built, will investigate the effects of almost &quot;no radiation&quot; on laboratory animals and cell cultures, and it will compare these groups to control groups exposed to natural radiation levels. Precautions would be made, for example, to remove potassium-40 from the food of laboratory animals. The expert panel believes that the Ultra-Low-Level Radiation laboratory is the only experiment that can explore with authority and confidence the effects of low-level radiation; that it can confirm or discard the various radiobiological effects proposed at low radiation levels e.g. LNT, threshold and radiation hormesis.

The first preliminary results of the effects of almost no-radiation on cell cultures was reported by two research groups in 2011 and 2012; researchers in the US studied cell cultures protected from radiation in a steel chamber 650 meters underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico and researchers in Europe proposed an experiment design to study the effects of almost no-radiation on mouse cells (pKZ1 transgenic chromosomal inversion assay), but did not carry out the experiment.

<text>A concert tour (or simply tour) is a series of concerts by an artist or group of artists in different cities, countries or locations. Often, concert tours are named to differentiate different tours by the same artist and to associate a specific tour with a particular album or product. Especially in the popular music world, such tours can become large-scale enterprises that last for several months or even years, are seen by hundreds of thousands or millions of people, and bring in millions of dollars in ticket revenues. A performer who embarks on a concert tour is called a touring artist.

Different segments of longer concert tours are known as &quot;legs&quot;. The different legs of a tour are denoted in different ways, dependent on the artist and type of tour, but the most common means of separating legs are dates (especially if there is a long break at some point), countries and/or continents, or different opening acts. In the largest concert tours, it has become more common for different legs to employ separate touring production crews and equipment, local to each geographical region. Concert tours are often administered on the local level by concert promoters or by performing arts presenters. Usually, small concert tours are managed by a road manager whereas large concert tours are managed by a tour manager.

==Logistics==
The main challenge in concert tours is how to move the performance&#x27;s logistics from one venue to another venue, especially for a transcontinental tour. Tour logistics should be very organized and everything has to happen on time and in the right order as planned. &quot;Autoweek&quot; magazine estimated 30 to 50 trucks were required by Taylor Swift&#x27;s The 1989 World Tour to bring all the stage, sound equipment, instruments, props, and clothes. 

When Beyoncé visited the United Kingdom with her 2016 The Formation World Tour, it took seven Boeing 747 air freighters and a fleet of more than 70 trucks to get her stage set and other gear to the venues. The logistics phase of that tour did not include transportation of the backstage staff, musicians, performers, and the singer herself.

==Themes==

The majority of concert tours are part of a promotional campaign to support an album release. Hence, new songs from the respective album are included on its tour&#x27;s setlist. Some tours are known as &quot;greatest hits tours&quot; or &quot;reunion tour&quot; without any new material or specific album release, such as Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 2009 Unleashed tour and No Doubt&#x27;s 2009 Summer Tour. Taylor Swift&#x27;s The Eras Tour (2023–2024) is a retrospective of her career to that point, where each act of the concert represents one of her albums. In another case, artists embark on a concert tour to celebrate the anniversary of their past albums, such as U2&#x27;s 2017 tour to mark the 30th anniversary of &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; (1987) and Janet Jackson&#x27;s 2019 tour to commemorate the 30th anniversary of &quot;Janet Jackson&#x27;s Rhythm Nation 1814&quot; (1989).

===Farewell tour===

A farewell tour is a concert tour intended to signal the retirement of a singer, the disbanding of a band, or the end of a show&#x27;s run. Many of the tours end up not being the last tour, with frequent regroupings, or revivals of shows. Luciano Pavarotti&#x27;s 2004 tour and Kenny Rogers&#x27;s 2015–2017 tour are examples of farewell tours which were the last to be staged before their deaths.

==Revenue==

As of October 2024, the highest-grossing concert tour of all time is Taylor Swift&#x27;s Eras Tour, with $2.089 billion earned from 149 shows. It was the first run to collect over $1 and $2 billion in revenue. Coldplay&#x27;s Music of the Spheres World Tour ranks at second place, being the most-attended tour in history and the first by a group to reach $1 billion. At third is Elton John&#x27;s Farewell Yellow Brick Road, with a total gross of $939 million from 2018–2023. At fourth place is Ed Sheeran&#x27;s ÷ Tour, with a gross of $776.2 million. On fifth place is U2&#x27;s 360° Tour, with $736.4 million.

Global touring revenue reported to &quot;Billboard&quot; Boxscore exceeded $5.5 billion in 2016. Due to the collapse of record sales in the 21st century, concert tours have become a major source of income for recording artists. Besides the tickets, touring also generates money from the sales of merchandise and meet-and-greet packages. However, the touring business suffered in the early 2020s because of the COVID-19 pandemic. &quot;Pollstar&quot; estimated the total lost revenue for the industry in 2020 at more than $30 billion.

==Response==
The mobility of concert tours requires a lot of costs, time, and energy. It is very common for musicians to not see family members for over a year during their touring. British singer Adele expressed her unhappiness of concert tours, saying &quot;Touring is a peculiar thing, it doesn&#x27;t suit me particularly well. I&#x27;m a real homebody and I get so much joy in the small things.&quot; A concert residency concept is offered as an alternative to performers who just need to stay in one venue and the fans come to see them. The concept has been revitalized in the 21st century by Canadian superstar Céline Dion with the success of her A New Day... residency (2003–2007). Her residency introduced a new form of theatrical entertainment, a fusion of song, performance art, innovative stage craft, and state-of-the-art technology. She managed to popularize the Las Vegas residency as a desirable way for top artists to essentially tour in place, letting their fans come to them. American singer Lady Gaga, who cancelled the 2018 European leg of her Joanne World Tour, signed for a Las Vegas residency to help manage her fibromyalgia illness, which can be exacerbated by touring.

The 2015 study by charity Help Musicians found that over 60% of musicians suffered from depression or other psychological issues, with touring an issue for 71% of respondents.

<text>The State of South Carolina has a group of protected areas managed by the South Carolina State Park Service (often abbreviated to SCPRT or Park Service). Formed in 1933 in conjunction with the formalization of the federal Civilian Conservation Corps program, the State Park Service is administered by the state&#x27;s Department of Parks, Recreation &amp; Tourism (SCPRT). There are a total of 47 facilities that the State Park Service administers, protecting more than 90,000 acres of sensitive, attractive, and/or historically significant lands in South Carolina. The facilities fall under four types of classifications:

* 38 State Parks
* 8 State Historic Sites
* 1 State Resort Park
* 1 State Recreational Area

Cheraw State Park was the first park to be proposed within the system in 1934 with Myrtle Beach State Park becoming the first park to open in 1936. Within six years, the State of South Carolina and the CCC opened 17 state parks. Originally under the jurisdiction of the South Carolina Forestry Commission, the Park Service has been a unit within the Department of Parks, Recreation &amp; Tourism since its formation in 1967. Hunting Island State Park in Beaufort County is the most popular state park in South Carolina and among the most popular in the United States, attracting 1.2 million visitors per year.

Following the Nukegate scandal, Dominion Energy settled with the South Carolina tax agency on $165 million in unpaid taxes owed due to an unfinished nuclear project in Fairfield County. As part of that settlement, the state agency and Dominion Energy agreed that Dominion would offset approximately a third of the unpaid taxes by turning over more than 2,900 acres of land which will ultimately become six new state parks in the coming years. The first state park expected to open from the settlement is Pine Island on Lake Murray.

<doc id="1106121" wikidata="Q4806145" url="?curid=1106121" title="Ashuwillticook Rail Trail">
<text>The Ashuwillticook Rail Trail is a rail trail that runs north-south through the towns of Cheshire, Lanesborough and Adams, and into the city of Pittsfield, Massachusetts. It is a multi-use trail for biking, walking, roller-blading, and jogging. The trail is managed by the Massachusetts Department of Conservation and Recreation (DCR). It was built on the former Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad.

The Ashuwillticook Rail Trail passes through the Hoosac River Valley, between Mount Greylock and the Hoosac Mountains. Cheshire Reservoir, the Hoosic River, and associated wetland communities flank much of the trail. The word Ashuwillticook is from the American Indian name for the south branch of the Hoosic River and literally means &quot;at the in-between pleasant river,&quot; or in common tongue, &quot;the pleasant river in between the hills.&quot;

==History==

In 1845, the Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad developed this corridor with the goal of extending the Housatonic Railroad north to Rutland, Vermont. While the track was under construction, the company was acquired by the Western Railroad, which later became part of the Boston and Albany Railroad (B&amp;A), as their North Adams Branch. Mineral traffic developed on the line and a number of limestone operations went into business. The New York Central Railroad took over the B&amp;A in 1900, and upgraded the line, which was sold to the Boston and Maine Corporation (B&amp;M) in 1981. As a connection to an existing track in North Adams, the B&amp;M operated the line until 1990.

The first two phases of the trail opened in 2001 and 2004, with a northerly extension added in 2017. A extension south to Crane Avenue in Pittsfield opened in the spring of 2022. Another segment south to Merrill Road opened in 2024 at a cost of $2.3 million.

The state intends to extend the trail north and west to Williamstown for a total length of , with additional potential extension south to the Housatonic village of Great Barrington. These extensions are expected to have higher costs than the existing path, which already covers the full disused length of the rail line. A northern extension to Hodges Cross Road in North Adams is planned to begin construction in 2028. In January 2025, the Berkshire Regional Planning Commission was awarded a $17.3 million federal grant to fund design of the remaining to Williamstown.

<text>The Raduga Kh-15 or RKV-15 (; NATO: AS-16 &quot;Kickback&quot;; GRAU:) is a Russian hypersonic aero-ballistic air-to-ground missile carried by the Tupolev Tu-22M and other bombers. Originally developed as a standoff nuclear air-to-ground missile similar to the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s AGM-69 SRAM, versions with conventional warheads have been developed.

As of early 2019, it was uncertain whether the Kh-15 was in service, with rumors that it had been retired or placed in storage.

==Development==
In 1967, MKB Raduga started developing the Kh-2000 as a replacement for the Kh-22 (NATO reporting name AS-4 Kitchen) heavy anti-shipping missile. Development of the Kh-15 started some time in the early 1970s. The sophistication of the design made it suitable for other roles, and a nuclear-tipped version was developed in tandem with the conventionally armed variant. An upgrade under development was cancelled in 1991, but reports in 1998 suggested an upgraded Kh-15 might be fitted to Su-35 (Flanker-E) tactical aircraft.

==Design==
The Kh-15 climbs to an altitude of about and then dives in on the target, accelerating to a speed of about Mach 5.

==Operational history==
It entered service in 1980. It can be carried by the Su-33, Su-34, Tu-95MS-6 &#x27;Bear-H&#x27;, Tu-22M3 &#x27;Backfire C&#x27;, and Tu-160 &#x27;Blackjack&#x27;.

==Variants==
* Kh-15 (RKV-15) - the original version with nuclear warhead and inertial guidance
* Kh-15P - passive seeker for anti-radar use
* Kh-15S - active radar seeker for anti-shipping use

==Operators==
===Current===

===Former===
* - Passed onto successor states

==Similar weapons==
* KSR-5 (AS-6 &#x27;Kingfish&#x27;) - heavy anti-surface missile carried under the wings of Tu-22M
* Kh-59 (AS-13 &#x27;Kingbolt&#x27;) - ASM for tactical aircraft, up to 285 km range
* Kh-37 (updated version of AS-20 &#x27;Kayak&#x27;) - land attack version of subsonic Kh-35 Anti-Ship missile, 250 km range
* AGM-69 SRAM - 1000 kg US missile with up to 170 km range

<text>The 1990 United States Senate elections were held on Tuesday, November 6, 1990, with the 33 seats of Class 2 contested in regular elections. Special elections were also held to fill vacancies. The Democratic Party increased its majority with a net gain of one seat from the Republican Party. The election cycle took place in the middle of President George H. W. Bush&#x27;s term, and as with most other midterm elections, the party not holding the presidency gained seats in Congress. This was the first time since 1980 that any party successfully defended all their own seats, and the first time Democrats did so since 1958.

These elections, along with 2022, featured the smallest seat change in history since the passage of the Seventeenth Amendment in 1913 with only one seat changing parties. That election featured Democrat Paul Wellstone defeating incumbent Republican Rudy Boschwitz in Minnesota. To date, this is the last cycle in which Democratic candidates won U.S. Senate elections in Oklahoma and Tennessee.

== Alaska ==


Incumbent Republican United States Senator Ted Stevens sought re-election to a fifth term in the United States Senate, which he won easily, besting his opponents in a landslide.






== Arkansas ==

Incumbent Democrat David Pryor won re-election uncontested.



== Colorado ==

Incumbent Republican senator William L. Armstrong did not seek re-election to another term. Republican congressman Hank Brown won the open seat, defeating Democratic nominee Josie Heath, former Boulder County Commissioner




== Delaware ==

Incumbent Democrat Joe Biden won re-election to a fourth term, defeating Republican challenger M. Jane Brady, Deputy Attorney General of Delaware.




== Georgia ==

Incumbent Democrat Sam Nunn won re-election to a fourth term uncontested.




== Hawaii (special) ==

Incumbent Democrat Daniel Akaka was elected to finish the term ending in 1995 over Republican U.S. Representative Pat Saiki. Akaka had been appointed by Governor John Waihee in April 1990 to serve temporarily after the death of Spark Matsunaga.




== Idaho ==


Republican Rep. Larry Craig defeated Democratic former state legislator Ron Twilegar for the seat of U.S. Senator Jim McClure, who did not seek re-election.







== Illinois ==

Incumbent Democrat Paul Simon sought re-election to the United States Senate. Simon was opposed by Republican nominee Lynn Morley Martin, a United States Congresswoman from Illinois&#x27;s 16th congressional district, whom he easily defeated to win a second and final term in the Senate.



== Indiana (special) ==

Incumbent Republican Dan Coats, who was recently appointed to this seat two years prior, won election to serve out the remainder of the term, beating Democratic State Representative Baron Hill.

During the 1988 presidential election, Republican nominee Vice President George H. W. Bush selected U.S. Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana as his vice presidential nominee. The Bush-Quayle ticket defeated the Dukakis–Bentsen ticket in the general election by a 53%-46% margin, capturing 40 states and 426 electoral votes.

In preparation for the pending vacancy, Governor Robert D. Orr appointed four-term U.S. Representative Dan Coats to fill Quayle&#x27;s seat on December 12, 1988. Coats was a former aide to Quayle, whom he had succeeded as U.S. Representative for Indiana&#x27;s 4th congressional district in 1981. Quayle eventually resigned his Senate seat on January 3, 1989, and Coats was immediately sworn into office.

Coats used television commercials that raised questions about Hill&#x27;s consistency in opposing new taxes, and Hill gained notoriety for walking the length of the state to meet voters.



== Iowa ==

Incumbent Democrat Tom Harkin sought re-election to a second term in the United States Senate. Harkin was opposed by Republican United States Congressman Tom Tauke, from Iowa&#x27;s 2nd congressional district, and both Harkin and Tauke won their primaries uncontested. Though Harkin performed slightly worse than he had six years earlier, he was successful in his re-election bid and defeated Tauke.








== Kansas ==

Incumbent Republican Nancy Kassebaum won re-election to her third full term, over Democrat Dick Williams, an educator at Wichita State University



== Kentucky ==

Incumbent Republican Mitch McConnell won re-election to a second term over Democrat Harvey Sloane, former Mayor of Louisville







== Louisiana ==

Incumbent Democrat J. Bennett Johnston Jr. won re-election to a fourth term and avoided a runoff, beating Republican David Duke, State Representative and former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan.

This election was viewed at the onset as potentially competitive, as Senator Johnston was viewed as vulnerable in light of Louisiana&#x27;s economic troubles at the time and Senator Johnston&#x27;s voting record viewed by Republicans as too liberal. The Republican Party leadership endorsed the candidacy of State Senator Ben Bagert, who was picked over Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, State Representative Quentin Dastugue and State Representative David Duke. David Duke, however, continued his candidacy and slowly overtook Bagert in attention and in the polls. Duke attracted national attention to the race with his involvement with white supremacist groups and his appeals to white resentment over affirmative-action programs. With Bagert failing to gain traction, the National Republican Senatorial Committee tried to recruit former Governor David Treen to jump into the race. When Treen passed, the effort turned from supporting Bagert to stopping Duke.

As the election drew near, polls showed Johnston firmly in first place, with Duke in second place and Bagert trailing far behind at third. National Republicans grew fearful that Bagert&#x27;s candidacy would only serve to force a runoff and that a potential runoff election with Duke being the de facto Republican nominee would hurt the national brand. On October 4, eight Republican Senators endorsed Johnston, with Senator John Danforth saying at the press conference that &quot;all of us would be embarrassed and mortified to have to serve in the United States Senate with David Duke masquerading as a Republican.&quot; Bagert dropped out of the race the next day, announcing that &quot;it became more and more apparent, that instead of forcing a runoff between myself and Bennett Johnston, I might very well be forcing a runoff between somebody else and Bennett Johnston.&quot; He announced he would &quot;reluctantly&quot; vote for Johnston. Bagert&#x27;s name remained on the ballot, but under state law his votes could not be counted as part of the official tally. After Bagert dropped out, HUD Secretary Jack Kemp endorsed Johnston, saying &quot;there&#x27;s no place in the Republican Party for someone who has practiced and practices racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism.&quot;





== Maine ==

Incumbent Republican William Cohen won re-election to a third term over Democratic State Representative Neil Rolde.



== Massachusetts ==

Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator John Kerry was re-elected to his second term over Republican real estate developer Jim Rappaport.






== Michigan ==

Incumbent Democrat Carl Levin won re-election to a third term, beating Republican U.S. Representative Bill Schuette.
 



== Minnesota ==

Incumbent Republican Rudy Boschwitz was defeated by Democratic challenger Paul Wellstone in a tight race. Widely considered an underdog and outspent by a 7-to-1 margin, Wellstone, a professor at Carleton College and nominee for Minnesota State Auditor in 1982 was the only candidate to defeat an incumbent senator in the 1990 election cycle and gained national attention after his upset victory.




== Mississippi ==

Incumbent Republican Thad Cochran won re-election to a third term.




== Montana ==

Incumbent United States Senator Max Baucus, who was first elected in 1978 and was re-elected in 1984, ran for re-election. After winning the Democratic primary, he moved on to the general election, where he was opposed by Allen Kolstad, the Lieutenant Governor of Montana and the Republican nominee. Baucus ultimately ended up defeating Kolstad in a landslide, winning his third term with ease.









== Nebraska ==

Incumbent Democrat J. James Exon won re-election to a third term, beating Republican U.S. Representative Hal Daub.




== New Hampshire ==

Incumbent Republican Gordon J. Humphrey decided to retire and not run for re-election to a third term. Republican Bob Smith won the open seat, beating Democratic former Senator John A. Durkin.





== New Jersey ==

Democratic Senator Bill Bradley decided to seek re-election and narrowly edged out little-known Republican Christine Todd Whitman, President of the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities.

Senator Bill Bradley didn&#x27;t realize he was in trouble of winning re-election and the New Jersey voters&#x27; anger over taxes and economy until the week prior to the election.

The senator had a major image problem. In the early part of the campaign Bradley was winning easily in the polls, so his staffers told him to play it safe. He sent out television advertisements of himself walking on the beach, shooting a perfect shot on the court, and sitting back in his office with his basketball shoes onto his desk. The advertisements backfired as voters were turned off and thought that he hadn&#x27;t taken his job as Senator seriously, at a time when New Jersey voters were suffering.

Another major problem with Bradley was how Democratic Governor Jim Florio implemented a $2.8 billion tax increase, hurting the state&#x27;s economy. In addition, Bradley refused to answer questions pertaining to Florio&#x27;s tax policies.

After Bradley realized he was in trouble he released negative advertisements. They attacked Whitman&#x27;s own record on taxes, accusing her of favoring tax increases when she was a Somerset County Freeholder. Bradley&#x27;s image may have been further damaged by his newer advertisements.





== New Mexico ==

Incumbent Republican Pete Domenici won re-election to a fourth term over Democratic State Senator Tom Benavidez.



== North Carolina ==

The election was fought between the Republican incumbent Jesse Helms and the Democratic nominee Mayor of Charlotte Harvey Gantt. Helms won re-election to a fourth term by a slightly wider margin than the close election in 1984.

Helms drew controversy for airing what became known as the &quot;Hands&quot; ad produced by Alex Castellanos. It showed a pair of white hands with the voiceover saying &quot;You needed that job, and you were the best qualified. But they had to give it to a minority because of a racial quota.&quot; The ad prompted allegations of racism.












== Oklahoma ==

Incumbent Democrat David Boren won re-election to a third term over Republican attorney Stephen Jones.



== Oregon ==

Republican Mark Hatfield was re-elected to a fifth term, defeating Democratic businessman Harry Lonsdale.

The front-runners emerged quickly: for the Republicans, Hatfield was in his fourth term and was the 8th most senior U.S. Senator, having previously served as Governor of Oregon for two terms and Oregon Secretary of State. For the Democrats, Harry Lonsdale, who had founded the biotechnology company Bend Research, announced in early 1990 that he intended to aggressively challenge Hatfield over the incumbent&#x27;s ties to special interests, and his positions on abortion rights and timber management.

In the Republican primary, Hatfield received a token challenge from Randy Prince, an environmentalist and former Eugene mayoral candidate who had once protested old-growth forest logging by tree sitting for 40 days. Despite an early miscue by Hatfield in which he missed the deadline for submitting a photograph for the primary voter&#x27;s guide, Hatfield handily defeated Prince to move on to the general election.


U.S. Congressman Ron Wyden considered challenging Hatfield, but decided against it. Lonsdale, who was unknown as a politician, announced his campaign in March, and came out swinging directly at Hatfield and mostly ignored his primary challengers. Lonsdale&#x27;s main campaign themes were abortion rights, which Hatfield opposed; and timber management, in which Lonsdale opposed exporting timber from Oregon forests and wanted to restrict logging in old-growth forests. Lonsdale also criticized Hatfield as being out-of-touch with Oregonians after so many years in the Senate. Lonsdale announced that he would refuse to take special-interest contributions in his campaign, and would finance the campaign himself with the millions he had made from Bend Research. Lonsdale easily defeated his competition: Salem attorney Steve Anderson, Pleasant Hill computer programmer Neale S. Hyatt, Milwaukie retired truck driver Brooks Washburne, Eugene activist Bob Reuschlein, and Frank A. Clough, also of Eugene.




Once the primaries concluded, Hatfield, who had been first elected U.S. Senator in 1966, rolled out his usual campaign honed from his decades of experience: he refused debates, never engaged his opponent directly, and focused on small, friendly campaign appearances that stressed the influence he wielded as a U.S. Senator with seniority and influence.

Lonsdale&#x27;s self-financed campaign made heavy use of TV attack ads, criticizing Hatfield as being out of step with Oregonians on every issue, but primarily in terms of timber and abortion. He also made use of a nationwide anti-incumbency sentiment, and tore into Hatfield for being too closely tied to Washington special interests, and attempted to tie Hatfield to the Savings and loan crisis of the mid-1980s through his advisor Gerry Frank, who had ties to a Salem savings and loan. By early October, polls showed the gap closing from 25 down to about 4 points in an early October poll conducted by &quot;The Oregonian&quot; newspaper, and by the end of October, some polls showed Lonsdale in the lead.

With the polls running against him and time running out, Hatfield, who had not been seriously challenged since first being elected in 1966 and had never lost an election, abandoned his tactic of staying above the fray and not engaging Lonsdale directly. In the media and in television ads, he charged Lonsdale with hypocrisy in his environmental stand, alleging that Lonsdale had allowed his company to illegally dump toxic chemicals into the environment. Lonsdale vigorously denied the charges, which were later shown to have violated no laws, but the tactic may have stalled Lonsdale&#x27;s momentum. Hatfield went on to win in all but Multnomah, Jackson, Baker, and Lincoln counties to win by more than 7 percentage points statewide.



== Rhode Island ==

Democratic Incumbent Claiborne Pell defeated Republican Representative Claudine Schneider in a landslide.



== South Carolina ==

Popular incumbent Republican Strom Thurmond cruised to re-election against Democratic challenger and perennial candidate Bob Cunningham.

Senator Strom Thurmond faced no opposition from South Carolina Republicans and avoided a primary election. The state Democrats saw this as an unwinnable race so when Bob Cunningham sought the Democratic nomination, he was unopposed in his bid.

Cunningham launched his second bid to unseat Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond after switching from the GOP to the Democratic Party in early 1990. Though he faced a formidable opponent, Cunningham planned no fund-raising activities. &quot;I don&#x27;t plan to ask for anything and I won&#x27;t accept any money from PACs&quot;, he said. Cunninghman said his campaign strategy was to &quot;go to places where I was invited and spread out my ideas.&quot; If elected, Cummingham said he would push to limit consecutive congressional service to 12 years and reform the tax system. He supported greater environmental activism. &quot;I think we&#x27;re going at it in much too lukewarm a fashion. I think we should work hard to find a substitute for the internal combustion engine.&quot;

The election was never a serious contest. Thurmond overwhelmingly outspent Cunningham in his re-election campaign.
 



== South Dakota ==

Incumbent Republican Larry Pressler won a narrow re-election battle against Democratic opponent Ted Muenster and Independent candidate Dean Sinclair, in contrast to his easy win in 1984.
 



== Tennessee ==

Democratic Senator Al Gore won re-election to a second term over Republican William R. Hawkins, a conservative author. As of 2023, this is the last Senate election in Tennessee that was won by a Democrat and the last time they won the state&#x27;s Class 2 Senate Seat.







== Texas ==

Incumbent Republican Phil Gramm won re-election to a second term, beating Hugh Parmer, State Senator and former Mayor of Fort Worth

Gramm, a popular incumbent who switched parties a few years prior, had over $5 million on hand.





== Virginia ==

Incumbent Republican John W. Warner won re-election to a third term. No Democrat filed to run against him as he won every single county and city in the state with over 60% of the vote. Independent Nancy B. Spannaus (an affiliate of the controversial Lyndon LaRouche) got 18% of the vote, as she was the only other candidate on the ballot besides Warner.




== West Virginia ==


The 1990 United States Senate election in West Virginia was held November 6, 1990. Incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator Jay Rockefeller won re-election to a second term.



== Wyoming ==

Incumbent Republican Alan Simpson easily won re-election to a third term over Democratic challenger Kathy Helling.

<text>William Forgan Smith (15 April 188725 September 1953) was an Australian politician. He served as Premier of the state of Queensland from 1932 to 1942. He came to dominate politics in the state during the 1930s, and his populism, firm leadership, defence of states&#x27; rights and interest in state development make him something of an archetypal Queensland Premier. He represented the Labor Party.

==Early life==
Forgan Smith was born at Mynefield House, near Invergowrie, Perthshire, Scotland. His father was George Smith, the chief gardener at Airlie Castle. His mother was Mary, née Forgan. Forgan Smith was one of their seven children. He attended local schools before finishing at Dunoon Grammar School.

After his schooling, Forgan Smith apprenticed himself to a painter and decorator in Glasgow. He took an early interest in politics, joined the Scottish Labour Party, probably influenced by his observations of the poor conditions in the Clydeside shipyards and other working-class areas in Glasgow.

==Political career==
===Early career in Queensland===
Forgan Smith emigrated to Queensland in 1912 hoping its warm climate would relieve a chronic bronchial condition. He was sponsored by a cousin in Mackay, where he settled, worked as a painter and decorator, and married a local farmer&#x27;s daughter, Euphemia (Effie) Margaret Wilson (15 January 1913-12 October 1958).

Forgan Smith became involved in trade unionism and Queensland Labor politics. Mackay was then the centre of the sugar industry in Queensland and sugar remained a major priority for Forgan Smith throughout his career. Despite the fact that he was only 28 and had been in Queensland only three years, he was pre-selected to run for the seat of Mackay in the 1915 election as the Labor candidate. The election saw a decisive victory for Labor under T. J. Ryan, and Forgan Smith won the seat and entered Parliament.

Despite his youth and inexperience, it did not take Forgan Smith too long to adjust. When Prime Minister Hughes called for conscription to be introduced, Forgan Smith joined Premier Ryan in opposing it. This gave him recognition in the Queensland Labor Party, but made him a lifelong enemy in Hughes. Hughes misnamed him as &quot;Hogan Smith, an Irishman from Glasgow&quot; and accused him of speaking &quot;Gaelic treason&quot;.

Forgan Smith read heavily on Parliamentary procedure; his knowledge meant he was made a temporary Chairman of Committees in 1917, a position which became permanent in 1920. Soon after, he entered Cabinet as a Minister without portfolio assisting the Premier. Both roles gave him ample opportunity to build a profile in Parliament and the party. In 1922 he became Minister for Public Works, where he administered a new system of unemployment relief and earned the respect of the Unions. In 1923 he was elected to the Queensland Central Executive of the Labor Party, a position which gave him considerable power. In 1925 he became Minister for Agriculture and Stock under Premier Gillies. By the end of 1925 he was Deputy Premier after only ten years in Parliament.

Queensland Labor suffered a surprising election loss in 1929, and Forgan Smith was elected leader of the party unopposed. As the Great Depression deepened, Forgan Smith knew that he had a good chance of victory in the next election. He concentrated on keeping his party held together, while trying to prevent the pro-Lang faction from gaining influence. He concentrated his criticism of the government of A. E. Moore on its decision to closely follow the Premiers&#x27; Plan, which Forgan Smith believed to be only making the depression worse.

===Premiership===

Forgan Smith campaigned furiously in the lead-up to the 1932 election, travelling broadly around the state. He was rewarded when he came into government, as Premier of Queensland with a seven-seat majority.

Not content with the premiership, he also served as treasurer. Caucus elected a cabinet of generally moderate members – the radicalism of the Ryan Government had largely gone from the Queensland ALP by this time.

Forgan Smith&#x27;s immediate challenge was dealing with the problem of how to respond to the Great Depression: in particular, the need to reduce unemployment. Notwithstanding his earlier rebukes of Moore&#x27;s administration, he followed (as Moore had done) the principles of the Premiers&#x27; Plan, while simultaneously insisting that the federal government meet its contractual obligations. Determined to bring jobless figures in Queensland down, he moved to implement something akin to the New Deal of President Franklin D. Roosevelt, although his term of office predated Roosevelt&#x27;s presidency by some nine months. Like Roosevelt, he owed much to the economic theory of John Maynard Keynes.

Forgan Smith was willing to raise taxes, especially on the wealthy and on corporations, in order to fund unemployment relief programs. He was successful in raising revenue from £5.6 million in 1932–33 to £8.6 million in 1938–39; in the process he turned Queensland into Australia&#x27;s highest taxing state. The Commonwealth Bank also paid Queensland £920,000 as part of a program to aid the states. This money was put towards coupons and relief work.

Along with most other Queensland premiers, before and since, Forgan Smith was an advocate of development. He put the relief programs to good use building infrastructure and undertaking other capital works projects. He embarked on a number of ambitious schemes, including the Story Bridge, an upgrade of Mackay Harbour, the Somerset Dam (which was not completed until after the end of his premiership) and a new building for the University of Queensland at St. Lucia that now bears his name. The relief was meant as a stop-gap measure. In some cases, local authorities took advantage of it, while in other cases, communities became dependent on it. For example, at one stage half of the workers of Coolangatta on the Gold Coast were on relief work. In 1938 relief work was abolished in favour of a permanent, long-term capital works program.

Under Forgan Smith&#x27;s rule, the weekly payments received by relief workers were raised to the level of the basic wage (a measure financed by a graduated income tax), while a major public works programme was initiated which boosted job opportunities and provided the state which major constructions of lasting worth. When Minister of Agriculture back in 1926, Forgan Smith had established a faculty of agriculture at the University of Queensland. Now that he was premier, he established new faculties at the same university in Dentistry, Veterinary Science, and Medicine. As noted by Ross McMullin, the establishment of these new faculties &#x27;was part of the co-ordinated development of the university and Queensland&#x27;s health services.&#x27; In 1938, the Premier could say without fear of being contradicted that Queensland enjoyed ‘the highest wage system, the best conditions of labour and the lowest unemployment’ in the country.&#x27;

 Sometimes Forgan Smith incurred criticism for being authoritarian and dictatorial, although he was neither the first nor the last premier of his state to inspire such accusations. He used his strong and forceful personality to dominate the cabinet and parliament, and his government passed a number of controversial pieces of legislation. For instance, he added clauses to the 1936 Racing Bill which made it harder for reporters to find out and divulge information about proposed legislation, which drew heavy criticism from the press. The 1940 Public Safety Bill gave the state government unprecedented powers during wartime. Probably the most authoritarian of his government&#x27;s measures, though, was the Transport Act of 1938, which allowed the Government to declare ‘State of Emergency’ in any part or all of the state, for any time, and for any reason. In such a case, the government&#x27;s actions were effectively beyond legal challenge. Admittedly, these laws were more or less in line with similar ones passed in other jurisdictions (for example, the Official Secrets Act in the United Kingdom). Also, Forgan Smith never declared a state of emergency himself; it would fall to later Queensland leaders to take advantage of that power. He would regularly consult with his Ministers to reach a decision, and while he could be heavy-handed in manner, he sometimes took advice from subordinates.

The doctrine of states&#x27; rights meant a great deal to Forgan Smith, as it did to many of his predecessors and successors in the premiership. For example, he opposed the Uniform Tax Plan of 1942, even though it had been proposed by a federal ALP government under John Curtin. Many people expected Forgan Smith to make a move to federal politics himself, just as Ted Theodore had done. Nothing came of such notions. He seemed satisfied with his secure position in Queensland.

The first Queensland premier to make wide use of radio, Forgan Smith was an effective speaker, and he made a good impression on many of those who listened to him. Radio allowed him to reach a wider audience than he could otherwise have done, and he also travelled throughout the state, especially to turn the first sod on a new public works project. Though never flamboyant (and in fact somewhat dour in manner), he became respected and genuinely popular. Benefiting from a weak and divided parliamentary opposition (Moore being opposition leader 1932–1936, Edward Maher 1936–41, Sir Frank Nicklin thereafter), Forgan Smith easily achieved re-election in 1935, 1938, and 1941. With no overt antagonists inside his cabinet, he was able to depart of his own volition from the premiership, which he did on 16 September 1942, becoming Queensland&#x27;s longest-serving Premier. Three months later Forgan Smith resigned from parliament.

A pragmatic and hard-working politician who rose, step by step, through careful planning, Forgan Smith was not dogmatic, nor did he do anything spectacular, preferring to busy himself with the minutiae of day-to-day administration. He claimed to be a socialist, although he was an ardent critic of communism. By his populism, his interests in education and state development, and his dominance of state politics throughout his time in office, he has sometimes invited comparisons with a later ALP leader of substantial electoral skill, Peter Beattie.

==Post-premiership career==
For most of his remaining years Forgan Smith pursued his other interests, sugar and education. He became a member and then chairman of the Sugar Board and chairman of the Central Sugar Cane Prices Board. Subsequently, he became the Chancellor of the University of Queensland in 1944, occupying this position until his death in 1953.

==Personal life==
Forgan Smith and his wife had two children.

Forgan Smith&#x27;s family recalled him as being warm, humorous, and unpretentious, in contrast to his public image. He was a heavy drinker. Early in his public life, he moved with his family Yeronga, a suburb of the state capital, Brisbane. He lived there for most of the remainder of his life. For recreation, Forgan Smith golfed, played lawn bowls, and attended cricket matches.

Forgan Smith suffered from duodenal ulcers for much of his life. In the early 1940s, his bronchial condition was diagnosed as cancer of the larynx. While in Sydney on Sugar Board business, Forgan Smith died suddenly on 25 September 1953 from a heart condition caused by his cancer.

Forgan Smith was accorded a State funeral, the procession moving from St Andrew&#x27;s Presbyterian Church to his burial place at Toowong Cemetery.

<doc id="1106132" wikidata="Q804018" url="?curid=1106132" title="Birth of the Cool">
<text>Birth of the Cool is a compilation album by the American jazz trumpeter and bandleader Miles Davis, released in February 1957 by Capitol Records. It compiles eleven tracks recorded by Davis&#x27;s nonet for the label over the course of three sessions during 1949 and 1950.

Featuring unusual instrumentation and several notable musicians, the music consisted of innovative arrangements influenced by Afro-American music and classical music techniques, and marked a major development in post-bebop jazz. As the title suggests, these recordings are considered seminal in the history of cool jazz. Most of them were originally released in the 10-inch 78-rpm format and are all approximately three minutes long.

== Background ==

From 1944 to 1948, Miles Davis played in Charlie Parker&#x27;s quintet. Davis recorded several albums worth of material with Parker during this period, including Parker&#x27;s Sessions for the Savoy and Dial labels. Davis&#x27; first records released under his own name were recorded with Parker&#x27;s band, in 1947, and were more arranged and rehearsed than Parker&#x27;s usual approach to recording. By 1948, Davis had three years of bebop playing under his belt, but he struggled to match the speed and ranges of the likes of Gillespie and Parker, choosing instead to play in the mid range of his instrument. In 1948, Davis, becoming increasingly concerned about growing tensions within the Parker quintet, left the group and began looking for a new band to work with.
At the same time, arranger Gil Evans began hosting gatherings of like-minded, forward-looking musicians at his small basement apartment, located on 55th Street in Manhattan, three blocks away from the jazz nightclubs of 52nd Street. Evans had gained a reputation in the jazz world for his orchestration of bebop tunes for the Claude Thornhill orchestra in the mid-1940s. Keeping an open door policy, Evans&#x27; apartment came to host many of the young jazz artists of late-1940s New York. The participants engaged in discussions about the future of jazz, including a proposed group with a new sound. According to jazz historian Ted Gioia: 
[The participants] were developing a range of tools that would change the sound of contemporary music. In their work together, they relied on a rich palette of harmonies, many of them drawn from European impressionist composers. They explored new instrumental textures, preferring to blend the voices of the horns like a choir rather than pit them against each other as the big bands had traditionally done with their thrusting and parrying sections. They brought down the tempos of their music ... they adopted a more lyrical approach to improvisation ...

== Recording ==

The nonet recorded twelve tracks for Capitol during three sessions over the course of nearly a year and a half. Davis, Lee Konitz, Gerry Mulligan and Bill Barber were the only musicians who played on all three sessions, though the instrumental lineup was constant (excepting the omission of piano on a few songs and the addition of Kenny Hagood on &quot;Darn That Dream&quot;). The first session occurred on January 21, 1949, recording four tracks: Mulligan&#x27;s &quot;Jeru&quot; and &quot;Godchild&quot;; as well as Denzil Best&#x27;s &quot;Move&quot; and &quot;Budo&quot; by Bud Powell and Miles Davis, both with John Lewis&#x27;s arrangements. Jazz critic Richard Cook hypothesizes that Capitol, wanting to get a good start, recorded these numbers first because they were the most catchy tunes in the nonet&#x27;s small repertoire. That date Kai Winding replaced Zwerin on trombone, Al Haig replaced Lewis on piano, and Joe Shulman replaced McKibbon on bass.

The second recording date came three months later on April 22, 1949 with Davis filling in for Fats Navarro in Tadd Dameron&#x27;s band with Charlie Parker during the interim. The band returned to the studio with five substitutions in personnel: J. J. Johnson on trombone, Sandy Siegelstein on French horn, Nelson Boyd on bass, and Kenny Clarke on drums, and John Lewis returning to piano. At this session, the nonet recorded Mulligan&#x27;s &quot;Venus de Milo&quot;, Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Rouge&quot;, Carisi&#x27;s &quot;Israel&quot;, and &quot;Boplicity&quot;, a collaboration between Davis and Evans, credited to the pseudonym &quot;Cleo Henry&quot;.

The band did not return to the studio again until March 9, 1950. Davis did not call the band for any rehearsals or live performances between the second and third recording dates. The March 1950 date featured Mulligan&#x27;s arrangement of (Eddie DeLange and Jimmy Van Heusen&#x27;s &quot;Darn That Dream&quot;, &quot;Rocker&quot;, and &quot;Deception&quot;, and Evans&#x27;s arrangement of Chummy MacGregor&#x27;s &quot;Moon Dreams&quot;, which had been released in a jazz arrangement by Glenn Miller and the AAF Band in 1944 on V-Disc. The band saw more substitutions, with Gunther Schuller on French horn and Al McKibbon on bass. Hagood returned for vocals on &quot;Darn That Dream&quot;.

== Composition ==

=== Music and style ===
One of the features of the Davis Nonet was the use of paired instrumentation. An example of this can be heard on the John Lewis arrangement &quot;Move&quot;. In &quot;Move&quot;, Lewis gives the melody to the pairing of trumpet and alto saxophone, baritone saxophone and tuba supply counterpoint, and trombone and French horn provide harmonies. Gerry Mulligan&#x27;s &quot;Jeru&quot; demonstrates another Nonet hallmark: the use of a unison sound and rich harmony throughout the horns. Davis said, &quot;I wanted the instruments to sound like human voices singing ... and they did.&quot; Though the album is seen as a departure from traditional bop, the recordings do feature tunes that are considered close to the bop style, such as &quot;Budo&quot; which has the band bookending solos by Davis, Mulligan, Konitz, and Winding, similar to a bebop head arrangement.

=== Thornhill&#x27;s influence ===
One of the largest stated influences on the sound of &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; was band leader Claude Thornhill and his orchestra. Out of Thornhill&#x27;s band came Lee Konitz, Bill Barber, Junior Collins, Joe Shulman, Sandy Siegelstein, Gerry Mulligan, and Gil Evans, Miles Davis calling the Konitz-Barber-Collins-Shulman-Siegelstein-Mulligan-Evans incarnation &quot;the greatest band&quot;, second only to &quot;the Billy Eckstine band with Bird.&quot; The Thornhill band was known for its impressionistic style, innovative use of instrumentation, such as the use of tuba and French horn, and a non-vibrato playing style, hallmarks that the Miles Davis Nonet adopted for &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;. According to Evans: Miles had liked some of what Gerry and I had written for Claude. The instrumentation for the Miles session was caused by the fact that this was the smallest number of instruments that could get the sound and still express all the harmonies the Thornhill band used. Miles wanted to play his idiom with that kind of sound.
Davis saw the full 18-piece Thornhill orchestra as cumbersome and thus decided to split the group in half for his desired sound. As arrangers, both Evans and Mulligan gave Thornhill credit for crafting their sound. Thornhill&#x27;s band gave Evans the opportunity to try his hand at arranging small-group bebop tunes for big band, a practice few others were participating in. Mulligan recalls Thornhill teaching him &quot;the greatest lesson in dynamics, the art of underblowing.&quot; Thornhill has also been credited with launching the move away from call and response between sections and the move towards unison harmonies.

== Release history ==

The four tracks from the January 1949 session were released soon after recording as two singles. From the April 1949 date, &quot;Israel&quot; and &quot;Boplicity&quot; were doubled together on a 78 and released as well. Of the twelve tracks recorded, Capitol released relatively few. In 1954, after persuasion from Rugolo, Capitol released eight of the tracks on a 10&quot; LP record titled &quot;Classics in Jazz—Miles Davis&quot; (H-459). In 1957 eleven of the tracks (all except for &quot;Darn That Dream&quot;) were released by Capitol as &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;. The final track, &quot;Darn That Dream&quot; (the only song with vocals, by Hagood), was included with the other eleven on a 1972 LP &quot;Capitol Jazz Classics, Vol. 1: The Complete Birth Of The Cool&quot; (M-11026). Subsequent releases have been based on this last compilation. The album has since been reissued many times in various formats. The live recordings of the nonet from its time at the Royal Roost were released as &quot;Cool Boppin&quot; in 1991. In 1998, Capitol Records released &quot;The Complete Birth of the Cool&quot;, which was remastered by Mark Levinson and collected the nonet&#x27;s live and studio tracks onto a single CD.

Note from the 2000 Capitol CD reissue producer Michael Cuscuna:

== Reception and legacy ==
The band&#x27;s debut performance at the Royal Roost received positive, but reserved reactions. Count Basie, the Roost&#x27;s headliner during the Nonet&#x27;s brief tenure, however, was more open to the group&#x27;s sound, saying, &quot;Those slow things sounded strange and good. I didn&#x27;t always know what they were doing, but I listened, and I liked it.&quot; Winthrop Sargeant, classical music critic at &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, compared the band&#x27;s sound to the work of an &quot;impressionist composer with a great sense of aural poetry and a very fastidious feeling for tone color... The music sounds more like that of a new Maurice Ravel than it does like jazz ... it is not really jazz.&quot; Though he did not recognize the record as jazz, Sargeant acknowledged that he found the record &quot;charming and exciting&quot;. 
In the short term the reaction to the band was little to none, but in the long term the recordings&#x27; effects have been great and lasting. They have been credited with starting the cool jazz movement as well as creating a new and viable alternative to bebop.

In 1957, after the release of &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot;, &quot;Down Beat&quot; magazine wrote that the album &quot;[influenced] deeply one important direction of modern chamber jazz.&quot; Several tunes from the album, such as Carisi&#x27;s &quot;Israel&quot;, have gone on to become jazz standards. The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;. &quot;Birth of the Cool&quot; was voted number 349 in Colin Larkin&#x27;s All Time Top 1000 Albums 3rd Edition (2000).
Many members of the Miles Davis Nonet went on to have successful careers in cool jazz, notably Gerry Mulligan, John Lewis, and Lee Konitz. Mulligan moved to California and joined forces with trumpeter Chet Baker in a piano-less quartet, before creating his Concert Jazz Band. Lewis would become music director of the Modern Jazz Quartet, which would become one of the most influential cool jazz groups. Evans would go on to collaborate with Davis again on the Davis albums &quot;Miles Ahead&quot; and &quot;Sketches of Spain&quot;. Capitol Records were at the time disappointed with the sales of the nonet recordings, and did not offer Davis a contract extension. Instead, Davis signed with the new jazz specialty record label, Prestige, for whom he would record his first album in 1951.

<text>Bella Voce (It., &quot;beautiful voice&quot;) is a Chicago-based chamber chorus specializing in classical a cappella music. It has been called &quot;Chicago&#x27;s premier professional chamber choir.&quot;

The group was founded in 1982 by countertenor Richard Childress as &quot;His Majestie&#x27;s Clerkes&quot;. In 1990, His Majestie&#x27;s Clerkes was awarded National Public Radio&#x27;s Lucien Wulsin Award for best small ensemble. The group was renamed in 2001. The group&#x27;s performances are usually of early and contemporary European music. Originally performing music of the English Tudor period, the name &quot;Bella Voce&quot; was chosen as the performances of &quot;His Majestie&#x27;s Clerkes&quot; took on broader interests.

Noted guest conductors of the group have included Sir David Willcocks, Paul Hillier, Simon Preston and Alice Parker. In 1990, HMC was awarded NPR&#x27;s Lucien Wulsin Award for best small ensemble Bela Voce won the Alice Parker-ASCAP-Chorus America Award for adventurous programming in 2004. The group has released many CDs of choral music. It has been described as &quot;an innovative and superbly polished a cappella ensemble.&quot; Like other classical music ensembles, it has experienced funding difficulties, alleviated in part by grants from organizations sponsoring the arts.

The group was led for many years by Anne Heider, artistic director, and Tamara Schupman, managing director. Heider is a choral conductor at the Roosevelt University&#x27;s &quot;Chicago College of Performing Arts&quot;, sings alto with the Chicago Sacred Harp singers and researches shape-note singing related to the Midwest.

Schupman is a Choral Assistant for the Northwest Bach Festival, and a member of the Chamber Singers of Chicago.

Chicago Tribune music critic John von Rhein praised the group&#x27;s &quot;fine musicianship, careful blending of voices, burnished sound and stylistic versatility&#x27; as exhibited on their 2006 CD &quot;American A Capella,&quot; recorded from concerts in 2004 and 2005.

Following Heider&#x27;s retirement, Andrew Lewis became the artistic director, starting with the 2005–06 season. Lewis is musical director of the Elgin Choral Union, a former artistic director of the Lutheran Choir of Chicago, founder and artistic director of The Janus Ensemble, and cantor of Immanuel Lutheran Church of Evanston, Illinois. He also is a member of the conducting faculty at the University of Illinois, Chicago. Chicago Sun Times critic Dorothy Andries described the sound of Bella Voce under Lewis as &quot;like honey, rich and shining, with soprano voices soaring above the altos, tenors and basses, like light through darkness.&quot; Von Rhein praised the group in 2007 as &quot;singing with the pure tone, clear vowels and firm blend of an English cathedral choir&quot; and said that &quot;melodic leaps, intricately laced part-writing and other musical hurdles were met most handsomely by the 23-member chorus.&quot;

<doc id="1106169" wikidata="Q725421" url="?curid=1106169" title="Geoffrey Trease">
<text>Robert Geoffrey Trease FRSL (11 August 1909 – 27 January 1998) was a prolific British writer who published 113 books, mainly for children, between 1934 and 1997, starting with &quot;Bows Against the Barons&quot; and ending with &quot;Cloak for a Spy&quot; in 1997. His work has been translated into 20 languages. He is best known for the children&#x27;s novel &quot;Cue for Treason&quot; (1940).

His grandfather was a historian, and was one of the main influences on his work. 
Trease&#x27;s children&#x27;s historical novels reflect his insistence on historically correct backgrounds, which he meticulously researched. His ground-breaking study &quot;Tales Out of School&quot; (1949) pioneered the idea that children&#x27;s literature should be a serious subject for study and debate. When he began his career, his radical viewpoint was a change from the conventional and often jingoistic tone of most children&#x27;s literature of the time, and he was one of the first authors who deliberately set out to appeal to both boys and girls and to feature strong leading characters of both sexes.

==Life and work==
Trease was born in Nottingham in 1909, third and youngest son of George Trease (1873–1932), a wine merchant, and his wife Florence Dale (1874–1955), a doctor&#x27;s daughter. He won a scholarship to Nottingham High School, where he wrote stories, poems, and a three-act play; awarded a Classics scholarship to Oxford University, he found his tutors dull and after a year, left university without a degree and moved to London. Intent on becoming a writer, he also worked with slum children and joined a left-wing group called the &quot;Promethean Society&quot; whose members included Hugh Gordon Porteus and Desmond Hawkins.

Trease described his own childhood reading as &quot;a diet of classist and racist historical adventure&quot; but in 1933, he came across a translation of a Russian book titled &quot;Moscow has a Plan&quot;, in which a Soviet author dramatised the First five-year plan for young readers. Inspired by this, in 1934 Trease wrote &quot;Bows Against the Barons&quot;, a left-wing update of Robin Hood that showcased a radical approach to historical literature for young people. This included the use of modern English, rather than linguistic mannerisms, strong male and female characters, often from less privileged levels of society and meticulous attention to detail. An enduring belief in equality and fairness is a theme in many of his books, as are links between the historical settings of his novels and contemporary issues.

&quot;Bows Against the Barons&quot; was translated into Russian and sold immensely well there; his next work, &quot;Comrades for the Charter&quot; was less successful but &quot;Cue for Treason&quot; in 1940 proved enduringly popular and remains his best known work. His subjects cover a wide range of historical periods, such as &quot;The Crown of Violet&quot;, set in Ancient Greece, &quot;The Red Towers of Granada&quot;, Middle Ages, &quot;The Hills of Varna&quot;, Renaissance Europe, &quot;Cue for Treason&quot; and &quot;Cloak for a Spy&quot;, Elizabethan England, &quot;Fire on the Wind&quot; and &quot;Popinjay Stairs&quot;, Restoration London, &quot;Thunder of Valmy&quot;, French Revolution, &quot;The White Nights of St Petersburg&quot;, the Bolshevik Revolution and &quot;Tomorrow Is a Stranger&quot;, World War II.

Trease also wrote modern school stories, including the five Black Banner novels set in the Lake District, the first being &quot;No Boats on Bannermere&quot;, as well as a number of adult novels, history, plays for radio and television, and biographies. He authored a guide aimed at teaching creative writing to young adults, &quot;The Young Writer: A Practical Handbook&quot;. He wrote three books of autobiography: &quot;A Whiff of Burnt Boats&quot; (1971), &quot;Laughter at the Door&quot; (1974), and in the last year of his life, the final part, &quot;Farewell the Hills&quot;. This was written for his family and friends, and published privately after his death.

Trease was an acknowledged influence on author Hester Burton and inspired others, including Rosemary Sutcliff and Leon Garfield. While in some ways they outpaced him, he continued to write, and published 113 books before &quot;calling it a day&quot; at the age of 88 because of illness. Many were translated for foreign markets, including Asia and Europe. In the United States he won the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot; Book Award for the Children&#x27;s Spring Festival 1966 for &quot;This is Your Century&quot;.

He married Marian Boyer (1906–1989) in 1933 and they spent most of their marriage in Colwall, near The Downs School, Great Malvern. They had one daughter, Jocelyne, and moved to Bath to be closer to her, shortly before Marian&#x27;s death.

<text>The 1988 United States Senate elections were elections for the United States Senate. Held on November 8, 1988, the 33 seats of Class 1 were contested in regular elections. In spite of the Republican victory by George H. W. Bush in the presidential election, the Democrats gained a net of 1 seat in the Senate. 7 seats changed parties, with 4 incumbents being defeated. The Democratic majority in the Senate increased by one to 55–45. 

This is the last Senate election cycle in which California voted for a Republican, and the last in which Texas and Maine voted for a Democrat, and the last time Arizona voted for a Democrat until 2018. This would also be the last Senate election cycle until 1998 to not have at least one special election during that cycle.

This is also the last Senate election cycle in which no woman was elected to the Senate from either party as all of the winners were men.

== Closest races ==

In eleven races the margin of victory was under 10%.

Ohio was the tipping point state with a margin of 13.95%.

== Arizona ==


Incumbent Democrat Dennis DeConcini was reelected to a third term over Republican Keith DeGreen, Marine veteran and financial advisor.




== California ==


Incumbent Republican Pete Wilson won re-election to a second term over Democrat Leo T. McCarthy, Lieutenant Governor of California and former Speaker of the California State Assembly. As of 2020, this is the last Senate election in California won by a Republican.




== Connecticut ==


Incumbent Republican Lowell P. Weicker Jr. ran for re-election to a fourth term, but was defeated by Democratic candidate Joe Lieberman, the Connecticut Attorney General and eventual 2000 nominee for Vice President of the United States, who would remain in office until his retirement in 2013.





== Delaware ==


Incumbent Republican William Roth won re-election to a fourth term, beating Democrat Shien Biau Woo, Lieutenant Governor of Delaware





== Florida ==


Incumbent Democrat Lawton Chiles decided to retire instead of seeking a fourth term. Republican U.S. Representative Connie Mack III won the open seat over Democratic Congressman Buddy Mackay.

This senate election was heavily targeted by both parties. U.S. Representative Mack announced his candidacy back in October 1987. President Ronald Reagan endorsed Mack in June 1988 to allow Mack to focus on the general election, and easily won the September 6 Republican primary against U.S. Attorney Robert Merkle. In May 1988, then-Congressman MacKay announced he would run for the open seat, and defeated Insurance Commissioner Bill Gunter in a close October 4 runoff election.

The general election soon became nasty, with Mackay portraying Mack as &quot;extremist.&quot; Mack also attacked his opponent in television ads by connecting him to liberal Massachusetts Governor and Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis. Mack had help from vice presidential candidate Dan Quayle. The election was so close there was a recount until Mackay conceded eight days after election day.












== Hawaii ==

Incumbent Democrat Spark Matsunaga won re-election to a third term, beating Republican cattle rancher Maria Hustace.




== Indiana ==

Incumbent Republican Richard Lugar was re-elected to a third term over Democratic attorney Jack Wickes.

Lugar, a popular incumbent, had token opposition in this election. An April 1988 poll showed that Lugar lead 65% to 23%. By June, Lugar raised over $2 million, while Wickes raised just over $100,000. Lugar agreed to debate Wickes on September 10, 1988.

Lugar won overall with two-thirds of the vote and won 91 of Indiana&#x27;s 92 counties, Wickes won only the Democratic stronghold of Lake County.



== Maine ==

Incumbent Democrat George J. Mitchell won re-election to a second full term over Republican Jasper Wyman, leader of Maine Christian Civic League and businessman. As of 2020, this is the last Senate election in Maine won by a Democrat.



== Maryland ==


Incumbent Democratic Paul Sarbanes was reelected to a third term over Republican Alan Keyes, former Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs.





== Massachusetts ==


Incumbent Democrat Ted Kennedy won re-election to his sixth (his fifth full) term over Republican Joseph D. Malone.





== Michigan ==


Incumbent Democrat Don Riegle won re-election to a third term over Republican U.S. Congressman James Whitney Dunn.




== Minnesota ==


Incumbent Republican David Durenberger won re-election to his second full term, beating Democrat Skip Humphrey, the Minnesota Attorney General and former state senator.





== Mississippi ==

Incumbent Democrat John C. Stennis decided to retire instead of seeking an eighth term (and his seventh full term). Republican Trent Lott won the open seat, beating Democrat Wayne Dowdy, U.S. Congressman from the 4th district.



== Missouri ==


Incumbent Republican John Danforth won re-election over Democratic state senator and future Governor Jay Nixon.





== Montana ==


Incumbent John Melcher, who was first elected to the Senate in 1976 and was re-elected in 1982, ran for re-election. After winning the Democratic primary, he faced Yellowstone County Commissioner Conrad Burns in the general election, and in the general election a grueling campaign followed. Ultimately, Melcher was narrowly defeated in his bid for re-election by Burns.








== Nebraska ==


Republican David Karnes decided to seek election to his first complete term after being appointed to the seat of the late Edward Zorinsky in March 1987, but was soundly defeated by Democratic former governor Bob Kerrey in the November general election.






== Nevada ==


Incumbent Republican Chic Hecht ran for re-election to a second term, but lost to Democratic governor Richard Bryan.





== New Jersey ==

Incumbent Democrat Frank Lautenberg won re-election to a second term with a margin of 8.37% over Republican Pete Dawkins, military veteran and CEO of Primerica Financial Services, Inc.

The campaign was full of political mudslinging, with Lautenberg accusing Dawkins of being a carpetbagger, noting his very brief residency in the state, and also accusing Dawkins&#x27; campaign of lying about his war record. Dawkins accused Lautenberg of running a smear campaign against, called him a &quot;swamp dog&quot;, and criticized him for saying he voted eight times against a senatorial pay raise without mentioning the fact that he did vote once for the pay raise.




== New Mexico ==

Incumbent Democrat Jeff Bingaman won re-election to a second term, beating Republican New Mexico State Senator Bill Valentine.




== New York ==


Incumbent Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan won re-election to a third term, over Republican Robert R. McMillan, business executive of Avon Products and Reagan Administration advisor.






== North Dakota ==


The incumbent, Quentin Burdick of the North Dakota Democratic NPL Party, sought and received re-election to his sixth term, defeating Republican candidate Earl Strinden.

Only Burdick filed as a Dem-NPLer, and the endorsed Republican candidate was Earl Strinden of Grand Forks, North Dakota, who was President of the University of North Dakota Alumni Association. As in the Burdick&#x27;s previous re-election campaign, the senator&#x27;s age became an issue for voters as he was 80 years old during the campaign. However, challenger Strinden commented that he did not want to raise the age issue. Burdick and Strinden won the primary elections for their respective parties.

The Burdick campaign hired high-profile Washington, D.C. campaign consultant Bob Squire of Squire Eskew Communications. To counter the potential age issue, Burdick successfully focused the message on the &quot;clout&quot; he had earned over decades in the Senate, as well as his Chairmanship of Senate Agricultural Appropriations sub-committee and his Chairmanship of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.

One independent candidate, Kenneth C. Gardner, also filed before the deadline, officially calling himself a libertarian. Gardner had previously run for North Dakota&#x27;s other United States Senate seat an independent in 1974, challenging Milton Young. He only received 853 votes in that election.




== Ohio ==

Incumbent Democrat Howard Metzenbaum won re-election over George Voinovich, Mayor of Cleveland and former Lieutenant Governor of Ohio.




== Pennsylvania ==

Incumbent Republican H. John Heinz III successfully sought re-election to another term, defeating Democratic nominee Joe Vignola, Philadelphia City Controller.

Joe Vignola was not expected by Democratic Party leaders to have a substantial chance at defeating the popular incumbent John Heinz, even predicting that Vignola would become &quot;Heinz&#x27;s 58th variety,&quot; referring to an advertising slogan of the H. J. Heinz Company. Heinz, knowing this, ran a low-profile re-election campaign and was safely ahead in polling. Vignola traveled across Pennsylvania promoting an increase in domestic spending, including education and healthcare, while decreasing the defense budget to compensate. Vignola ran a positive campaign, in contrast with Cyril Wecht six years previously, although many Democratic ward leaders and committee members had given up on the campaign and had stopped campaigning for Vignola.

Heinz easily defeated Vignola to win the election and another term in the Senate, carrying every Pennsylvania county except Philadelphia, Vignola&#x27;s home town, and by a comfortable 1.49 million vote margin. Heinz performed well in suburban areas, as well as the central, southwestern and northeastern portions of the state. Outside of Philadelphia, Vignola&#x27;s best county-wide showing was in Mercer County, where he won 36% of the vote, and his poorest county-wide performance was in Snyder County, where he won 12% of the vote. Although Heinz&#x27;s landslide victory was largely expected among Democratic leaders, Heinz won by a wide margin despite the Democrats&#x27; 551,000-voter registration advantage statewide.

Heinz died in an airplane crash on April 4, 1991, in Lower Merion Township, Pennsylvania. Democrat Harris Wofford was appointed on May 8 to fill the vacancy caused by Heinz&#x27;s death, and subsequently won a special election in November 1991. In the 1994 election, however, Wofford was defeated by Republican Rick Santorum.




== Rhode Island ==


Incumbent Republican John Chafee won re-election to a third term, beating Democratic lieutenant governor and former state senator Richard Licht.



== Tennessee ==


Incumbent Democrat Jim Sasser won re-election to a third term over Republican Bill Anderson.





== Texas ==


Incumbent Democrat Lloyd Bentsen won re-election to a fourth term defeating Republican Representative Beau Boulter.

Bentsen easily won the Democratic nomination for another term, while Boulter came through a run-off in the Republican primary defeating Wes Gilbreath. After being nominated for the senate Bentsen was chosen by Michael Dukakis as his vice-presidential running mate and therefore ran for both the Senate and the vice-presidency at the same time. Bentsen was always the favorite for the senate election and won with 59.2% of the vote, compared to 40% for Boulter.

As of 2024, this was the last time a Democrat won a United States Senate election in Texas.

In the Democratic primary Democratic senator Lloyd Bentsen defeated the same opponent he had beaten in 1982, Joe Sullivan, a psychology professor from San Antonio.

Bentsen had been senator from Texas since first winning election in 1970 and had been re-elected in 1976 and 1982. He was also Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and the clear favourite for re-election in 1988. Sullivan stood on a platform calling for reduced spending by the federal government, but had been easily defeated by Bentsen in the 1982 Democratic primary. This was repeated in 1988 with Bentsen winning the primary with over 80% of the vote.



Four candidates competed for the Republican nomination; U.S. representative Beau Boulter, former state representative Milton Fox, millionaire Houston businessman Wes Gilbreath and businessman Ned Snead. Boulter was a two-term representative for the 13th district, while Gilbreath was competing in his first election, but spent $500,000 on the primary.

Wes Gilbreath led in the March primary with 36.7%, but as no candidate won a majority, went into a run-off election against Beau Boulter who came second with 30.5%.



There were few policy differences between Boulter and Gilbreath, with both candidates being conservatives who opposed abortion and called for reduced government spending. Gilbreath spent about one million dollars of his money in his contest for the primary, while Boulter spent about $250,000. However Boulter won endorsements from many Texas Republican leaders, including the candidates who had come third and fourth in the March primary, as well as from anti-abortion groups.

Boulter won the April run-off for the Republican nomination with just over 60% of the vote.



In July 1988 the Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis chose Lloyd Bentsen to be the Democratic vice-presidential candidate. As the Texas Democrats had already had their primary for senate candidate, Bentsen could not be replaced on the ballot. Bentsen was however able to run both for the Senate and for vice-president as Lyndon Johnson had gotten Texas law changed in 1960 to allow Johnson to do the same at the 1960 election.

Lloyd Bentsen won the senate election by a clear margin over Beau Boulter, at the same time as he and Michael Dukakis lost the presidential race, with George Bush winning Texas with 56% of the vote compared to 43% for Dukakis. Bentsen&#x27;s vote total in the senate election was reported to be at the time the highest vote total in any Texas statewide election. Bentsen then returned to the Senate and remained until the next four years when he was appointed the Secretary of the Treasury under President Bill Clinton. Had the Dukakis–Bentsen ticket won, Bentsen would have become U.S. Vice President and forced to resign his Senate seat, which would have led to a 1990 special election. It would also have led Republican Governor Bill Clements to temporarily appoint an interim replacement.




== Utah == 

Incumbent Orrin Hatch easily won re-election to a third term over Democrat Brian Moss.



== Vermont ==

Incumbent Republican Robert Stafford did not run for re-election to another term in the United States Senate. Republican candidate Jim Jeffords defeated Democratic candidate Bill Gray to succeed him.









== Virginia ==


Former Democratic governor Chuck Robb replaced Republican Senator Paul S. Trible Jr., who opted not to run for re-election. Robb beat Republican Maurice A. Dawkins, minister and black activist.




== Washington ==

Incumbent Republican Daniel J. Evans decided to retire instead of running for re-election to a full term, after being appointed to the seat in 1983, and won election to a partial term that same year. Republican former U.S. Senator Slade Gorton, who had just lost a re-election bid in 1986, won the open seat over congressman Mike Lowry.



== West Virginia ==

Incumbent Democrat Robert Byrd won re-election to a sixth term over Republican, State Senator Jay Wolfe.



== Wisconsin ==


Incumbent Democrat William Proxmire decided to retire, instead of running for re-election to a sixth full term. Democratic businessman Herb Kohl won the open seat, beating Republican state senator Susan Engeleiter.




== Wyoming ==


Incumbent Republican Malcolm Wallop ran for re-election to a fourth term, and was narrowly re-elected, defeating the Democratic state senator John Vinich by a margin of a little over 1,300 votes.

Despite being a reliably Republican state, Vinich, a Democrat, was able to impressively compete with Wallop. During the campaign, Wallop attacked Vinich as being a tax-and-spend liberal who was beholden to labor and anti-business. Vinich, in turn, cited his &quot;A&quot; score he got from the National Rifle Association of America due to his votes in the Wyoming Legislature to counter Wallop&#x27;s attacks, and possibly attract conservative voters.

<text>Edward Stillingfleet (17 April 1635 – 27 March 1699) was an English Christian theologian and scholar. Considered an outstanding preacher as well as a strong polemical writer defending Anglicanism, Stillingfleet was known as &quot;the beauty of holiness&quot; for his good looks in the pulpit, and was called by John Hough &quot;the ablest man of his time&quot;.

==Life==
Edward Stillingfleet was born at Cranborne, Dorset, seventh son of Samuel Stillingfleet (d. 1661), of Cranborne Lodge, Dorset, a member of a landowning family originally of Yorkshire, and his wife Susanna, daughter of Edward Norris, of Petworth, West Sussex. He went at the age of thirteen to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating B.A. in 1652, and became vicar of Sutton, Bedfordshire in 1657.

In 1665, after he had made his name as a writer, Stillingfleet became vicar at St Andrew, Holborn. He preached at St Margaret, Westminster on 10 October 1666, the &#x27;day of humiliation and fasting&#x27; after the Great Fire of London, with such an attendance that there was standing room only. Samuel Pepys recorded that he could not get in to hear the sermon, eating a meal of herrings in a pub instead.

Stillingfleet then held many preferments, including a Royal Chaplaincy, and the Deanery of St Paul&#x27;s (1678), the latter involving him in work connected with the building of the new St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He became Bishop of Worcester in 1689. He was a frequent speaker in the House of Lords, and had considerable influence as a churchman.

He supported Richard Bentley, who lived in his household as a tutor for a number of years, from shortly after his graduation in 1693. Bentley would later be his chaplain and biographer, and describe him as &quot;one of the most universal scholars that ever lived&quot;.

In 1691, at Stillingfleet&#x27;s request, Queen Mary II wrote to the magistrates of Middlesex, asking for stronger enforcement of the laws against vice. This was an early move in the campaign of the Society for the Reformation of Manners.

At his death Stillingfleet left a library of some 10,000 printed books, which were purchased by Narcissus Marsh and today are part of Marsh&#x27;s Library in Dublin, Ireland. His manuscript collection was purchased by Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer (1661–1724), and passed with the Harleian Manuscripts to the British Museum in 1753 as one of the foundation collections.

==Patronage, politics and views==
Stillingfleet had to wait many years for a bishopric, a fact linked to his disfavour at Court in the 1680s. He never, though, lacked for well-connected patrons. The first was Sir Roger Burgoyne, 2nd Baronet, a barrister and MP in the Long Parliament, in whose gift was Sutton, Bedfordshire, his living; followed by Francis Pierrepont, a Parliamentarian colonel and younger brother of Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester (a Royalist) and William Pierrepont (like Francis a Parliamentarian). These both offered him tutoring positions. He was also supported by Harbottle Grimstone, who as Master of the Rolls gave him a preaching position in the Rolls Chapel.

The transition at the Restoration was certainly problematic. Earl of Southampton presented Stillingfleet to St Andrew, Holborn. Humphrey Henchman, Bishop of London, employed him to write a vindication of William Laud&#x27;s answer to John Percy (&quot;alias&quot; Fisher). According to Jon Parkin,

Stillingfleet was a leader within the Church of England of the &quot;latitudinarians&quot;, the group of Anglicans thus defined pejoratively. Latitudinarism as doctrine was considered to have grown from the teaching of the Cambridge Platonists, but in practical terms conditions at the Restoration did not favour it. Quite a number of its Cambridge adherents left an unpromising career in religion for the law, or had to rely for patronage on those who had done so.

Stillingfleet was most closely associated, in his attitudes, with such as Isaac Barrow, Robert South and John Tillotson. They agreed, for example, on a literal interpretation to Biblical exegesis, discarding allegorical readings. With Tillotson he favoured the so-called Erastian view, that the ruler had great powers over the Church, from the days of 1660; after the Glorious Revolution they became Low Church moderates. With Gilbert Burnet, Benjamin Hoadly, Simon Patrick, William Powell and William Whiston, he held some High Church views also.

With Thomas Tenison, Stillingfleet and Tillotson preached on behalf of reason and natural religion. They are described as influential Arminian Anglicans. They adopted an Arminian scheme of justification in opposition to the Calvinist&#x27;s one, and took the stock of core beliefs to be a small set of fundamentals. In Stillingfleet&#x27;s case, it supported reconciliation with Presbyterians. Stillingfleet and Tillotson

In 1674 they met with Richard Baxter and Thomas Manton, in an attempt to draft a reconciliation with the nonconformists.

They were largely sympathetic with the new science of their times. Stillingfleet did draw the line at the materialist tendency in the views of Edmond Halley, whom he examined with the help of Richard Bentley in 1691, when Halley applied for the Savilian Chair of Astronomy.

==Works==
A keen controversialist, he wrote many treatises, with a general but learned concern to defend Anglican orthodoxy.

===Doctrine and the Church===
His first book was &quot;The Irenicum&quot; (1659) advocating compromise with the Presbyterians; following a Latitudinarian approach, he there shows the influence of John Selden and takes a close interest in the synagogue as a model of church structure. The philosophical basis was natural law and the state of nature. The arguments of the &quot;Irenicum&quot; were still live in the 1680s, when Gilbert Rule produced a &quot;Modest Answer&quot;.

It was followed by &quot;Origines Sacrae, Or, A Rational Account of the Grounds of Christian Faith, as to the Truth and Divine Authority of the Scriptures, and Matters Therein Contained&quot; (1662) and &quot;A Rational Account of the Grounds of Protestant Religion&quot; (1664). It included an attack on Catholicism, and Edward Meredith replied on the Catholic side. &quot;A Discourse Concerning the Idolatry Practised in the Church of Rome&quot; (1671) formed part of a controversy with the recusant Catholic Thomas Godden and noted Church scholar Serenus de Cressy.

&quot;The Mischief of Separation&quot; (1687) originally a sermon, was followed up by &quot;The Unreasonableness of Separation: Or, An Impartial Account of the History, Nature and Pleas of the Present Separation from the Communion of the Church of England&quot; (1680). These attacks on the separatists among non-conformists prompted a large-scale response from dissenters, many of whom were disappointed with the harsher line from an Anglican who had in the past held out an olive branch. His opponents included Richard Baxter and John Owen. John Howe took the line that &quot;latitude&quot; was not compatible with a &quot;mean narrow&quot; approach. Stillingfleet was also criticised from the conforming side, for coming too close to the arguments of Thomas Hobbes.

&quot; An Answer to Some Papers&quot; (1685) attempted to deal with the embarrassing publication of papers, allegedly written by the King, Charles II, arguing that one true church was that of Roman Catholicism. In the ensuing controversy, he issued &quot;A Vindication of the Answer to some Late Papers&quot; (1687) attacking John Dryden, whom he called a &quot;grim logician&quot;. Dryden retaliated, and incorporated the &quot;grim logician&quot; phrase as self-description in his poem &quot;The Hind and the Panther&quot; (1687), which alludes to Stillingfleet.

===Philosophical controversy===
&quot;A Letter to a Deist&quot; (1677) was the first prolonged attack on deism to appear in English. It also engaged with the thought of Baruch Spinoza, in &quot;Tractatus Theologico-Politicus&quot;, though he was named only as a &quot;late author mightily in vogue&quot;.

In 1697, Stillingfleet issued &quot;A Discourse in Vindication of the Doctrine of the Trinity&quot; (1697)

It had three intentions: repelling the Unitarians, shoring up the unity of the orthodox trinitarians, and doctrinal defence of the Trinity. Under the third heading, Stillingfleet took on John Locke, and his &quot;Essay on Human Understanding&quot;. He wrote &quot;Three Criticisms of Locke&quot; (1697)

Stillingfleet engaged in a debate through correspondence (later published) with Locke. He argued in favor of dualism, and claimed that Locke&#x27;s &quot;Essay&quot; argued against dualism as he understood it. He also considered that the epistemology of the &quot;Essay&quot; opened the door to Unitarianism. Locke himself had taken an interest in Stillingfleet (with James Tyrrell and Sylvester Brounower) from 1681.

The controversy drew in the playwright Catherine Cockburn, who wrote in defence of Locke, but to the detriment of her career as author.

===Antiquarian scholarship===
&quot;Origines Sacrae&quot; (1663) began with a comprehensive analysis of flaws in ancient historians, as a way of defending the account in the &quot;Book of Genesis&quot;. It argued against the Pre-Adamite theories of Isaac La Peyrère, and took a very critical line with the older theories of ancient British origins, and the writings of Annius of Viterbo.

Another work going back to the roots was &quot;Origines Britannicae: Or, The Antiquities of the British Churches&quot; (1685).

The &quot;Discourse of the True Antiquity of London&quot; appeared in 1704 bundled with &quot;The Second Part of Ecclesiastical Cases&quot;. It was a work of high scholarship on Roman London; it however ignored the new archaeological evidence that was available but not yet in literary form.
