<text>Wind River Systems, Inc., also known as Wind River (trademarked as Wndrvr), is an Alameda, California–based company, subsidiary of Aptiv PLC. The company develops embedded system and cloud software consisting of real-time operating systems software, industry-specific software, simulation technology, development tools and middleware.

== History ==
Wind River Systems was formed by a partnership of Jerry Fiddler and Dave Wilner. Until 1981, Fiddler had worked at Berkeley Lab writing software for control systems, and wanted to pursue a career in computer generated music, which he funded through a consultancy business focused on real-time operating systems. His early clients included the National Football League and film director Francis Ford Coppola, for whom he designed a unique film editing system. Wilner, a former colleague at Berkeley Lab, joined Fiddler to form Wind River Systems in 1983.

In 2009, Wind River was acquired by Intel. In 2018, Intel spun out its Wind River division, which was then acquired by TPG Capital. On January 11, 2022, Wind River announced that it was acquired by Aptiv, an auto parts company, for $4.3 billion in cash.

The company&#x27;s key milestones include:
* 1983: Wind River is incorporated in 1983 with each partner contributing $3,000 and a desk to the business. The company was named for Wind River, Wyoming, where Fiddler had vacationed that year
* 1987: Wind River introduces VxWorks, a leading real-time operating system for embedded devices.
* 1995: VxWorks launches into space on the NASA Clementine moon probe. Also, the Tornado integrated development environment is launched and wins EDN&#x27;s Embedded Development Software Innovation of the Year award as the first graphically oriented development environment for embedded
* 1997: VxWorks, the real-time operating system for NASA&#x27;s Mars Pathfinder mission, lands on Mars
* 1999: Acquisition of one of their major competitors, Integrated Systems Inc., makers of pSOS. Wind River has since discontinued the pSOS product line and has recommended existing pSOS customers move to VxWorks.
* 2001: Wind River Systems acquired Belgian software company Eonic Systems, the developer of Virtuoso RTOS for DSPs. In November 2015, Wind River Systems renamed the operating system to Rocket, made it open-source and royalty-free. In 2016, Rocket was incorporated into Zephyr RTOS hosted by Linux Foundation.
* 2004: Wind River officially enters the embedded Linux market, with a Carrier Grade Linux platform targeting the networking &amp; communications infrastructure industry. Also, NASA&#x27;s Mars Exploration Rovers, Spirit and Opportunity, powered by VxWorks, land on Mars. Wind River helped in manufacturing the IntelliStar for The Weather Channel. The IntelliStar is used at Cable Headends to insert Local Weather into The Weather Channel&#x27;s national programming.
* 2007: Wind River joins Google&#x27;s Open Handset Alliance as an original Linux commercialization partner.
* 2008: Wind River establishes the embedded Linux market share lead with greater than 30 percent of total market revenue, four years after entering the market.
* 2009: Intel acquires Wind River for approximately $884 million and it becomes a wholly owned subsidiary of Intel. Wind River launches a commercial Android software platform. Wind River becomes a founding member of the GENIVI Alliance, now called COVESA (Connected Vehicle Systems Alliance).
* 2010: Wind River adds Simics, a full system simulator, to its product portfolio. VxWorks becomes the first RTOS to be certified under Wurldtech&#x27;s Achilles certification program, a standard for industrial cyber security. Wind River partners with Intel and the Linux Foundation to create the Yocto Project, an open source collaboration project providing templates, tools and methods to help developers create embedded Linux-based systems.
* 2012: NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) successfully lands Mars Science Laboratory rover Curiosity, powered by Wind River technology. Wind River debuts software platform targeted at gateways and hubs for the Internet of things.

* 2014: Wind River introduces its software for network functions virtualization (NFV) applications, as well as its next-generation VxWorks platform reinvented for the Internet of Things.
* 2014: Wind River fined $750,000 by Bureau of Industry and Security for exporting encryption technology to countries including Israel and South Korea.
* 2015: the company was accused of repeated trademark and licensing violations of the Grsecurity project, which as response has restricted its code to commercial partners only.
* 2016: Intel announced that it intended to fully integrate Wind River into one of its divisions (thus ending Wind River&#x27;s status as a wholly owned subsidiary,) although the scheduled completion date of this action has not been made public. Barry Mainz left the company to become president and CEO of MobileIron and Jim Douglas assumes the position of President.
* 2018: Intel divested Wind River Systems to alternative asset fund manager TPG under undisclosed terms.

== Products ==
Among the company&#x27;s products are the VxWorks real-time operating system, the Wind River Linux operating system, and the Eclipse-based Wind River Workbench IDE. VxWorks began as an add-on to the VRTX operating system in the early 1980s. Wind River Workbench superseded the previous &quot;Tornado&quot; environment.

=== VxWorks ===

VxWorks is the original flagship product of Wind River. It is a real-time operating system (RTOS) intended for embedded and critical infrastructure devices and systems. It supports multicore processors, 32-bit and 64-bit, for several architectures including ARM, Intel, and Power and has over one hundred board support packages (BSPs) for different hardware systems. VxWorks is a real time and deterministic operating system.

=== Wind River Linux ===
Wind River&#x27;s Linux product is source code and a build system that generate runtime images suitable for embedded devices.

Historically, Wind River Linux has supported a variety of architectures, including ARM, MIPS, PowerPC, IA32 and SPARC.

The current release of Wind River Linux supports a variety of ARM, IA32, and IA64 platforms with both standard and realtime (PREEMPT RT) kernels.

Wind River charges a subscription to provide commercial bug and CVE fixes for their Linux products. Pricing is project-based, with a flat fee for each solution built on top of Wind River Linux. There is no per-device subscription or royalty.

The key capabilities for Wind River Linux are 10 year commercial support life, complete customization including kernel changes, reproducible customizations, wide range of hardware support through Board Support Packages (BSP) that are ported, maintained, and tested by Wind River.

==== Early history ====
In 2004, Wind River announced a partnership with Red Hat to create a new Linux-based distribution for embedded devices. Wind River has since ended its partnership with Red Hat and now ships its own Linux distribution optimized for embedded Linux development.

Wind River released the first version of its embedded Linux distribution, Platform for Network Equipment - Linux Edition (PNE-LE) 1.0 in 2005. It was registered against the Carrier Grade Linux 2.0 specification and supported IA32 and PPC architectures. They added other platforms in subsequent releases, General Purpose Platform - Linux Edition (GPP-LE) and Platform for Consumer Devices - Linux Edition PCD-LE) starting in version 1.4. In 2013 Wind River announced Wind River Linux 6.0.

Wind River Systems acquired FSMLabs embedded technology in February 2007 and made a version available as Wind River Real-Time Core for Wind River Linux. As of August 2011, Wind River has discontinued the Wind River Real-Time Core product line, effectively ending commercial support for the RTLinux product.
On August 7, 2007, Palm Inc. announced it would use Wind River Systems Linux for its (later aborted) Palm Foleo.

In 2008, Wind River announced cooperation with BMW, Intel and Magneti Marelli for development of a Linux-based open-source platform to control in-car electronics, which was extended in the GENIVI Alliance in 2009.

==== Yocto Project ====
In 2012, Wind River introduced a version of Linux that was developed from the Yocto Project open source development infrastructure and achieved Yocto project compatible registration. All subsequent releases of Wind River Linux are based on the Yocto Project.

==== Wind River Linux release history ====
Wind River has historically released a new Wind River Linux LTS (Long Term Support) about every year that are generally based on the then current Linux Kernel LTS release and the latest Yocto Project release.
=== Wind River Linux Distro ===
In 2022, Wind River launched a new product, Wind River Linux Distro, that is a binary Linux distribution based on the Wind River Linux source-based product.

The Distro is intended for embedded solution developers that need a commercially supported Linux for their project, but do not need the extensive customization capabilities of the Yocto Project-based Wind River Linux. The key features are quick time to value, customization via tools such as the Linux Assembly Tool &amp; an RPM package feed, and updates via OSTree.

Developers can download a free version of the Wind River Linux Distro by going to https://www.windriver.com/products/linux/download

A number of hardware platforms are enabled by the Distro. Commercial support is currently available for a subset of the enabled platforms. 
=== Simics ===
Simics is a full-system simulator used by software developers to simulate the hardware of complex electronic systems.

=== Wind River Studio ===
Wind River Studio is a cloud-native platform for the deployment and servicing of mission-critical intelligent edge systems.

<text>Shrinkwrap contracts or shrinkwrap licenses are boilerplate contracts packaged with products; use of the product is deemed acceptance of the contract.

Web-wrap, [[clickwrap|click-wrap]] and [[Browse wrap|browse-wrap]] are related terms which refer to license agreements in software which is downloaded or used over the internet.

A software license agreement is commonly called an end user license agreement (or EULA).

The term &#x27;shrink wrap&#x27; describes the shrink wrap plastic wrapping which coats software boxes or the terms and conditions which comes with products on delivery.

Shrink wrap assertions are unsigned permit understandings which state that acknowledgement on the client of the terms of the assertion is demonstrated by opening the shrink wrap bundling or other bundling of the product, by utilisation of the product, or by some other determined instrument.

==United States==

The legal status of shrink wrap contracts in the US is somewhat unclear. In the 1980s, software license enforcement acts were enacted by Louisiana and Illinois in an attempt to address this issue, but parts of the Louisiana act were invalidated in &quot;Vault Corp. v. Quaid Software Ltd.&quot;, and the Illinois act was quickly repealed. Case history also fails to clear up the confusion. One line of cases follows &quot;ProCD v. Zeidenberg&quot; which held such contracts enforceable (see, e.g., &quot;Bowers v. Baystate Technologies&quot;) and the other follows &quot;Klocek v. Gateway, Inc.&quot;, which found the contracts at hand unenforceable (e.g., &quot;Specht v. Netscape Communications Corp.&quot;), but did not comment on shrink wrap contracts as a whole. These decisions are split on the question of consent, with the former holding that only objective manifestation of consent is required while the latter require at least the possibility of subjective consent. In particular, the Netscape contract was rejected because it lacked an express indication of consent (no &quot;I agree&quot; button) and because the contract was not presented directly to the user (users were required to click on a link to access the terms). However, the court in this case did make it clear that &quot;Reasonably conspicuous notice of the existence of contract terms and unambiguous manifestation of assent to those terms by consumers are essential if electronic bargaining is to have integrity and credibility.&quot;

<doc id="1085452" wikidata="Q2002511" url="?curid=1085452" title="Vidura">
<text>Vidura (), plays a key role in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. He is described as the prime minister of the Kuru kingdom and is the paternal uncle of both the Pandavas and the Kauravas.

==Legend==

===Mandavya&#x27;s Curse===
The rishi Mandavya cursed Yama that he would be born as a maid&#x27;s son for getting him impaled without a valid reason. He was born in the mortal world as Vidura.

=== Birth and early life ===
Vidura was born through Niyoga between the sage Vyasa and Parishrami, a handmaiden to the queens Ambika and Ambalika. Ambika first mated with Vyasa through the niyoga process but kept her eyes closed during the process because his appearance and power frightened her. As a result she gave birth to the blind Dhritarashtra. Later her sister Ambalika followed the same process with Vyasa, and knew to keep her eyes open. But she was pale with fear during the niyoga, and so gave birth to the albino Pandu. Finally the queens sent their maiden Parishrami in their place, who behaved appropriately during niyoga process and gave birth to the exceptional Vidura. But because his mother was a handmaiden rather than a queen, his status was always lower than his two half brothers. The queens were wives of king Vichitravirya – the grandfather to the Kauravas and Pandavas who eventually fought each other in the Battle of Kurukshetra, the climax of the Mahabharata on the threshold of which the Bhagavad Gita was given by Krishna to the Pandava prince Arjuna. King Vichitravirya was also the adopted father of Dhritarashtra and Pandu. After Krishna, Vidura was the most respected as an adviser by the Pandavas, whom he forewarned on various occasions of Duryodhana&#x27;s plots to exterminate them, such as Duryodhana&#x27;s plan to burn them alive in the house of lac or lacquer.

=== Game of dice ===
Vidura tried to stop Yudhishthira from playing the game of dice, but his efforts were of no use. Except the prince Vikarna, Vidura was the only one who protested against the humiliation of Draupadi in the Kaurava court. In that moment, Duryodhana viciously rebuked Vidura, calling him ungrateful. Dhritarashtra moved to rebuke Duryodhana for insulting their uncle, but, remembering Vidura saying that a blind man cannot be king, holds his tongue, and instead reprimanded Duryodhana for insulting the prime minister. It is that incident that Vidura brought up years later when he severed ties with the Kurus and sided with the Pandavas at the onset of the Kurukshetra war. Unlike Bhishma, Dronacharya, Kripacharya, and Karna, Vidura did not have an obligation to Hastinapura or Duryodhana, but to his family. Hearing Dhritarashtra not acknowledge that relationship, Vidura felt compelled to side with dharma and the Pandavas.

=== Krishna&#x27;s visit ===
According to Krishna, Vidura was considered as Dharmaraja, which means the king of righteousness. Krishna respected Vidura for his devotion to people&#x27;s welfare and his proficiency in every sphere of knowledge. When Krishna visited Hastinapura as a peace emissary of the Pandavas, he shunned Duryodhana&#x27;s offer to stay in the royal palace, preferring instead the home of Vidura, on account of him being the only neutral man in the Kaurava court. The reason Krishna stayed in Vidura&#x27;s chambers for the night instead of Duryodhana&#x27;s is due to the thoughts which were running through their heads and the difference between them. Duryodhana&#x27;s intention was to heave luxury upon Krishna and convince him to join the Kaurava side. Sensing this intention, Krishna refused. Krishna knew the food that Vidura and his wife presented was presented with love and affection with no ulterior motive.

=== Kurukshetra War ===
In the &quot;Sanatsujatiya&quot; section of the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, shortly before the Kurukshetra War began, Vidura invoked the sage Sanatsujata to answer Dhritarashtra&#x27;s questions about death.

During Krishna&#x27;s visit, Vidura repeatedly advised everyone in the Court to heed the messenger. Continuously irritated, Duryodhana bursts out, blaming the low-born mother of Vidura as the cause for him betraying the Kauravas who have been feeding him. In protest against verbal assault, Vidura resigned on the spot from the post of Prime minister and broke his bow, vowing not to take part in the Kurukshetra War. Lesser known versions of Mahabharatha praise Vidura as an archer so great that if he had participated on the side of Kauravas in the war, the Pandavas would have been crushed. Vidura&#x27;s bow was crafted by Vishnu himself, and it was destroyed at the behest of Vishnu&#x27;s visit.

===Death===
After the Kurukshetra War, Yudhishthira became the emperor and upon his request, Vidura resumed his post as Prime minister. After many years, Vidura accompanied Dhritarashtra, Gandhari and Kunti who retired to the forests to live a simple life. Sanjaya also accompanied them. When Yudhishthira went to forest after two years to visit them, he found Vidura&#x27;s body to be lifeless. When he went near to the body, Vidura&#x27;s spirit entered Yudhishthira&#x27;s body and Yudhishthira realised that he and Vidura belonged to same entity, Yama. Yudhishthira left Vidura&#x27;s body in the wood as a heavenly voice told Yudhishthira not to cremate Vidura&#x27;s body.

== Vidura Niti ==
In Chapters 33 through 40 of Udyoga Parva in the Mahabharata, Vidura outlines things wise people and leaders should do, and things they should not. Collectively, these are known as &quot;Vidura Niti&quot; (Vidura&#x27;s Statecraft). Some examples of his recommendations for leaders:

# He should wish for the prosperity of all, and should never set heart on inflicting misery on any group.
# He should pay attention to those who have fallen in distress and adversity. He should not ignore persistent sufferings of those that depend on him, even if the suffering is small.
# He should show compassion to all creatures, do what is good for all creatures rather than a select few.
# He should never impede the development and growth of agriculture and economic activity by anyone.
# He should be always be prepared to protect those that depend on him for their safety and security.
# He should be fair and accessible to his people. By means of virtue should he attain success, by means of virtue should he sustain it.
# He should consider the welfare of his people as his personal responsibility.
# He should encourage learning and transmission of knowledge.
# He should encourage profit and virtue. Prosperity depends on good deeds. Good deeds depend on prosperity.
# He should avoid friendship with the sinful.
# He should never misuse wealth, use harsh speech nor inflict extreme or cruel punishments.
# He should only appoint those as ministers (senior positions in his staff) whom he has examined well for their history of virtue, dispositions, activity and whether they give others their due.

Vidura Niti also includes a few hundred verses with suggestions for personal development and the characteristics of a wise person. For example, in Chapter 33, Vidura suggests a wise person refrains from anger, exultation, pride, shame, stupefaction and vanity. He has reverence and faith, he is unhampered in his endeavors by either adversity or prosperity. He believes virtue and profit can go together, exerts and acts to the best of his ability, disregards nothing. He understands quickly, listens carefully, acts with purpose. He does not grieve for what is lost, and does not lose his sense during crisis. He is constantly learning, he seeks enlightenment from everything he experiences. He acts after deciding, and decides after thinking. He neither behaves with arrogance, nor with excessive humility. He never speaks ill of others, nor praises himself. He does not exult in honours to himself, nor grieves at insults; he is not agitated by what others do to him just like a calm lake near river Ganges.

==In popular culture==
Vidura is considered as the &quot;Mahachohan&quot; in the &quot;Theosophical world&quot;. Mahachohan is said to be the chief of a Social Hierarchy of the trans-Himalayan mystics.
Most characters in the Mahabharata were reincarnations of one God or the other. Vidura was the reincarnation of Dharmaraja, more popularly known as Yamadharmaraja, who was born as a maid&#x27;s son due to the curse of sage Mandavya.When Vishnu decided to take birth as Krishna, other deities also incarnated along with him. This is seen both in the Mahabharata and in the Ramayana. For example, in the Ramayana, the sage Narada was born as Vibhishana.

&quot;Vidura Niti&quot;, or Vidura&#x27;s Statecraft, narrated in the form of a dialogue between Vidura and King Dhritarashtra, is considered the precursor in some ways of Chanakya Neeti by Chanakya.

Vidura is held to be a paragon of truth, dutifulness, impartial judgement and steadfast &quot;dharma&quot;. He is considered the embodiment of the inner consciousness of the Mahabharata. The curse carried by Narada was also transferred to Vidura. The curse that though he being bestowed with ultimate knowledge and wisdom about the past, the present and the future, he would not be believed.

Kaka Vidura, a Hindi minor poem by Rambhadracharya, has Vidura and his wife Sulabha as central characters.

Vidura Bhiksha is a Malayalam poetry work by Ullur S. Parameswarayyar.

<text>Ambalika () is the queen of Kuru Kingdom in the Hindu epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. The youngest daughter of Kashya, the King of Kashi and Kausalya, Ambalika is abducted by Bhishma during her svayamvara ceremony, and becomes the wife of Vichitravirya, the King of Hastinapura. She is the mother of Pandu and the grandmother of Pandavas.

==Legend==

Along with her sisters, Amba and Ambika, Ambalika was taken by force by Bhishma during their svayamvara, the latter having challenged and defeated the assembled royalty. He presented them to Satyavati for marriage to Vichitravirya. Ambalika and her sister spent seven years in their husband&#x27;s company. Vichitravirya was afflicted with tuberculosis, and died from the disease.

After Vichitravirya&#x27;s death, since he left no heirs, his mother Satyavati sent for her first born, the sage Vyasa. She asked him to father children with the widowed queens of Vichitravirya, according to the prevalent custom of niyoga. Vyasa had come from years of intense meditation and as a result, he looked tremendously unkempt. When he approached Ambika, she closed her eyes in fear. As a result, the blind Dhritrashtra was born. When he approached Ambalika, she turned pale in fear. Her son Pandu, as the result of the &quot;niyoga&quot;, was born with a pale appearance.

Her son Pandu was married to Kunti and Madri. She is the grandmother of Pandavas – Yudhishtira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva, who were the central characters of the epic.

After the death of Pandu, Ambalika accompanied her mother-in-law Satyavati, and sister Ambika, to the forest, and spent the rest of her days in spiritual retreat.

== In popular culture ==
*In B. R. Chopra&#x27;s 1988 series &quot;Mahabharat&quot;, Ambalika was portrayed by Menaka Babbar.
* In the 2013 Star Plus&#x27;s series &quot;Mahabharat&quot; (2013), Ambalika was portrayed by Mansi Sharma.

<doc id="1085466" wikidata="Q991481" url="?curid=1085466" title="Waddington, Lincolnshire">
<text>Waddington is a village and civil parish in the North Kesteven district of Lincolnshire, England, situated approximately south of Lincoln on the A607 Grantham Road. The village is known for its association with RAF Waddington. At the 2001 Census Waddington had a population of 6,086, increasing to 6,122 at the 2011 census. It grew to 12,622 and this included the village of Bracebridge Heath,

==History==
The name &#x27;Waddington&#x27; means &#x27;farm/settlement of the people of Wada&#x27;.

The village is a documented settlement in the &quot;Domesday Book&quot; of 1086 and was mainly an agricultural community until the late 19th century. Horseracing also took place on the heathland areas, which are now part of the RAF station. At various times other activities including malting, brick-making and stone-quarrying have taken place in the village.

Richard de Soham, a senior judge and Crown official in Ireland, was appointed parish priest of Waddington in 1303, and apparently retired there in 1305.

In 1790 Mary Farmery and Susanna Locker both laid claim to the affections of a young man; this produced a challenge from the former to fight for the prize, which was accepted by the latter. Proper sidesmen were chosen, and every matter conducted in form. After several knock-down blows on both sides, the boxing battle ended in favour of Mary Farmery.

Around 1830, George Boole, the mathematician, taught at Waddington Academy Boarding School in the village, run by Robert Hall. From 1838 to 1840, Boole lived in the village and became headmaster of the academy.

Enemy action during 1941 severely damaged 71 houses in the village, as well as the Horse &amp; Jockey pub and the NAAFI building on the RAF station. The damage was mainly caused by two aerial mines; large bombs dropped by parachute and fused to explode before hitting the ground. Eleven people were killed, among them the NAAFI manager, Mrs Constance Raven, after whom the All-Ranks Club on the RAF station is still named.

The village 12th-century St Michael and All Angels church was rebuilt in 1721 and destroyed in a Second World War air raid on the night of 8 May 1941. It was replaced by the present-day Anglican parish church of St Michael on High Street, a modern stone building consecrated in 1954.
The original Great War memorial was also destroyed and replaced by the current memorial.

==Geography==
High Dyke, the road that runs between the main RAF station and the service married quarters, lies on the line of the Roman road Ermine Street. There is only minor evidence that High Dyke is Ermine Street, but the alignment is so exact that it is unlikely to be a coincidence. Ermine Street, as it passes Byards Leap to the south, is also called High Dyke. The traceable line of Ermine Street peters out in the adjacent village of Harmston and does not reappear until the other side of Lincoln.

Waddington Low Fields lies to the west of the village. Historically an area of open downland, some residential development has taken place in the 20th and 21st centuries.

===Topography===
Waddington is known as a Lincolnshire Cliff Village, as it is situated on a ridge of Jurassic limestone called the Lincoln Edge or Lincoln Cliff Waddington lies south of Lincoln and north-northwest of Sleaford.

During the Ice Age, most of the region surrounding Waddington was covered by ice sheets and this has influenced the topography and nature of the soils. Waddington&#x27;s cliff-top position means it is above sea level, giving it commanding views over the River Witham valley.

The Viking Way enters the village from the north on Far Lane and passes south along High Street then briefly along Millers Road.

==Community facilities==
The parish council office is located on High Street. There is a medical practice on Grantham Road, and a chiropody practice on Bar Lane. The Lincolnshire Fire Brigade premises are situated on Mere Road.

The village shops are mainly located in the Bar Lane area of the upper part of the village and the Redwood Drive Shopping Centre in the lower part of the village. There is an Indian takeaway outlet and a fish and chip shop. A post office and library are incorporated within the Co-operative Pharmacy premises on Bar Lane. Zoo Ceramics pottery workshop and gallery are situated next to the post office.

There are three village public houses: the Horse and Jockey (now closed) which faces onto the old village square at the centre of the village, the Three Horse Shoes, adjacent to St Michael&#x27;s Church on High Street, and the Wheatsheaf, at the crossroads of the Lincoln to Grantham road (A607) and Mere Road, the main access road to RAF Waddington. There is also a pub restaurant, the Crow&#x27;s Nest.

The village is also home to Foss Dyke Band who became one of the few brass bands in the UK to gain promotion from fourth section to championship section over a period of seven years and in 2013 established a new brass band in the village, Witham Brass.

The village is served by bus links to Lincoln and Grantham, operated by the Stagecoach Group.

==Buildings==
The older part of the village primarily consists of buildings built of the local limestone along with some brick-built houses built after brick-making began to take place on the lower slopes of the village. Newer residential areas are located in the Brant Road part of the village (which is at the bottom of the Lincoln Edge and has merged with the Lincoln suburb of Bracebridge), and are of modern brick and tile construction. The more modern areas of the village have developed down the steep hill towards Lincoln.

==Education==
There are two primary schools within the parish of Waddington. All Saints&#x27; Primary School is in the upper part of the village on Mere Road, and Waddington Redwood Academy is in the lower part of the village off Brant Road.

==RAF Waddington==
RAF Waddington is a British airfield east of the village&#x27;s centre. It is one of the oldest airfields in the UK, founded in November 1916 for the Royal Flying Corps. RAF Waddington is the RAF&#x27;s main ISTAR airfield, operating amongst others the E-3D Sentry (a.k.a. AWACS) reconnaissance aircraft. Previous to this, the station had been home to part of the Avro Vulcan nuclear bomber force.

RAF Waddington is now home to 13 Sqn who operate the MQ-9 Reaper Remotely Piloted Air Vehicles (RPAS), although the aircraft are not physically based there.

Two Commonwealth air force personnel of the First World War and 33 of the Second World War buried from this airfield have war graves in a plot St Michael&#x27;s Churchyard.

==Climate==
According to the Köppen classification, the British Isles experience a maritime climate characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Compared with other parts of the country, Lincolnshire – and Waddington – are slightly warmer and sunnier in the summer and colder and frostier in the winter. Owing to Waddington&#x27;s inland position, far from the landfall of most Atlantic depressions, it is one of the driest places to live in the UK, receiving, on average, less than of rain per year. The mean annual daily duration of bright sunshine is four hours and 12 minutes.

In the July 2022 heatwave, Waddington jointly recorded the new record high with nearby Coningsby at on the 19th. However, the Met Office does not officially recognise the joint record due to unstated &quot;non-standard practices&quot;, and Coningsby is solely credited with the July 2022 all-time record. Waddington&#x27;s records are in line with other stations and there is no known reason for why the record could be anomalous.

<text>The Sinclair Wetlands (Te Nohoaka o Tukiauau) are an internationally renowned wetlands located to the south west of Dunedin, New Zealand, at the southern edge of the Taieri Plains. They are on the western side of Lake Waipori and approximately equidistant between Mosgiel and Milton. The protected area covers a little over 315 Ha 3 km2.

The wetlands are home to many species of birds including scaup, swans and many more wetland waterfowl including the fernbird and rare bittern. A number of birds such as white herons and spoonbills occasionally frequent the area also.

The wetlands are named for Horace &quot;Horrie&quot; Sinclair, a local farmer who donated land to the wetlands scheme in 1984. An education centre opened in the late 1980s is located at the wetlands. The wetlands contain a small island (Whakaraupuka / Ram Island), which was in ancient times the location of a Māori settlement, Tukiauau Pā.

In the 1986 New Year Honours, Horace Sinclair was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire, for services to conservation.

<text>USS &quot;Lapon&quot; (SS-260), a , was the first ship of the United States Navy to be named after the lapon, a scorpionfish of the Pacific coast of the United States.

==Construction and career==
Her keel was laid down by the Electric Boat Company, Groton, Connecticut 21 February 1942. She was launched on 27 October 1942, sponsored by Mrs. J. B. Oldendorf, wife of Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf. &quot;Lapon&quot; was commissioned on 23 January 1943.

=== First and second war patrols, June – November 1943 ===

Completing trials and training in Long Island Sound, &quot;Lapon&quot; departed New London for the Pacific 4 May 1943. She reportedly was mistakenly machine-gunned by friendly forces at New London Sanctuary on 5 June, but continued her voyage and arrived at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 1 June 1943. She departed 24 June for her first war patrol which was spent in the Sea of Okhotsk and Sea of Japan. On 3 July, &quot;Lapon&quot;, along with and became the first U.S. submarines to slip through a mined strait into the Sea of Japan.

The entire time &quot;Lapon&quot; operated in the Sea of Japan, she was surrounded by thick fog and had problems with her radar. After she exited the Sea of Japan through La Perouse Strait, she patrolled off the east coast of Hokkaidō and Honshū. There she saw an aircraft carrier and a pair of destroyers. The escorts kept &quot;Lapon&quot; pinned down with the assistance of aircraft, and the carrier escaped.

The submarine departed 26 September for a close inshore patrol off the south coast of Honshū. After sinking cargo ship &quot;Taichu Maru&quot; 18 October, &quot;Lapon&quot; returned to Pearl Harbor 4 November 1943 and departed for the West Coast 7 November for an overhaul at Mare Island Navy Yard.

===Third, fourth, and fifth war patrols, January – August 1944 ===
Refitted with four new engines, the submarine departed for the South China Sea via Pearl Harbor in February 1944. &quot;Lapon&quot; sought out torpedo targets and inflicted heavy damage on the enemy. She sank the cargo ship &quot;Toyokuni Maru&quot; on 8 March, &quot;Nichirei Maru&quot; on 9 March, and &quot;Hokuroku Maru&quot; (8359 tons) on 18 March, and inflicted heavy damage to several small craft. &quot;Lapon&quot; terminated this patrol in Fremantle, Australia, arriving 1 April 1944.

Departing 25 April, &quot;Lapon&quot; arrived in the South China Sea and on 23 May detected and tracked a convoy. During the early hours of 24 May, the submarine sank the cargo ships &quot;Wales Maru&quot; and &quot;Bizen Maru&quot;. &quot;Lapon&quot; cleared the area at flank speed chased by an escort and returned to Fremantle 6 June for refit.

Underway for the eastern part of the South China Sea 29 June, &quot;Lapon&quot; spotted a cruiser and destroyer, the latter escaping at high speed. Four days later she sent cargo ship &quot;Kyodo Maru No. 36&quot; to the bottom. In the early evening of 31 July 1944, a convoy was sighted in Palawan Passage. &quot;Lapon&quot; closed in for a night submerged radar attack and sunk the tanker &quot;Tinshin Maru&quot; and damaged two other vessels. &quot;Lapon&quot; then headed for Australia and moored at Fremantle 10 August.

=== Sixth and seventh war patrols, September 1944 – January 1945 ===
&quot;Lapon&quot; sailed for the South China Sea on 4 September, Lieutenant Commander (LCDR) Donald G. Baer in command. She rendezvoused with submarines and and became a member of a wolfpack. Early in the morning of 21 September, the submarine contacted an enemy hospital ship and allowed the ship to pass unharmed. That afternoon, while rounding Palauic point, &quot;Lapon&quot; spotted smoke and commenced closing. As she neared attack position U.S. carrier-based planes attacked the convoy, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy. &quot;Lapon&quot; attacked remnants of the convoy 22 September and sank the cargo ship &quot;Shun Yuan&quot;. The next day &quot;Flasher&quot; and &quot;Lapon&quot; made a coordinated attack on several ships, &quot;Lapon&quot; sinking the tanker &quot;Hokki Maru&quot;. Patrolling off the coast of Luzon 10 October 1944, &quot;Lapon&quot; intercepted a Manila-bound convoy and sank the cargo ship &quot;Ejiri Maru&quot;. Assigned to lifeguard duty, the submarine was on station during the air attacks preliminary to the invasion of the Philippines; and 21 October departed for Australia, arriving at Fremantle 31 October.

&quot;Lapon&quot; left port for her seventh patrol 23 November and took position on a scouting line to prevent enemy reinforcements from reaching Mindoro and Leyte. Aircraft contacts were many and ship contacts few. &quot;Lapon&quot; was the last submarine to prowl Lingayen Gulf before the invasion of Luzon, and was ordered out of the area at high speed the day of the first landings. She headed for Pearl Harbor, arriving 21 January 1945. Departing for the West Coast 4 days later, she moored at Mare Island Navy Yard 31 January.

=== Eighth war patrol, April – July 1945 ===
Bound for her last patrol, &quot;Lapon&quot; arrived at Pearl Harbor 22 April, stayed there for a month, then headed for Guam, arriving 5 June. Next day she sailed on a special mission of lifeguarding for a British carrier strike force and for B-24 and B-29 bombers striking the Japanese homeland. Returning to Guam 20 June, she headed for Saipan 4 days later to join submarines for a picket boat sweep ahead of Admiral Halsey’s forces which were to attack Tokyo area targets. Upon completion of sweeps, &quot;Lapon&quot; went on lifeguard duty off Tori Shima until 7 July when she steamed for Midway Atoll, briefly stopping at Saipan for temporary repairs, mooring 23 July.

The day she was to sail for another war patrol, hostilities ended. Instead, &quot;Lapon&quot; departed for the Atlantic coast 26 August and arrived at New Orleans, Louisiana, 20 September 1945. She remained there until she departed 24 October for the Texas coast, arriving Galveston 25 October. Two days later she berthed at Houston. &quot;Lapon&quot; got underway for Staten Island, New York on 30 October, arriving 4 November. She remained at New York until 8 January 1946, when she sailed for New London, arriving the same day. &quot;Lapon&quot; was placed out of commission in reserve 25 July 1946.

=== Greek service ===


Recommissioned at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, 13 April 1957, &quot;Lapon&quot; remained in the Portsmouth vicinity until 10 August, when she was decommissioned and struck from the Navy list. On 8 August 1957 she was transferred to Greece by Captain Samuel Francis under the Military Assistance Program and served the Greek Navy as &quot;Poseidon&quot; (S-78) (originally carrying pennant number Y-16). 

&quot;Poseidon&quot; was purchased outright by Greece in April 1976 and stricken from active duty for use as spare parts for sister ships. SS-260 was stricken from the US Navy Register on 31 December 1975. 

==Honors and awards==
* Navy Unit Commendation
* Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal with four battle stars for World War II service

&quot;Lapon&quot; was credited with sinking 53,443 tons of Japanese shipping. She was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for her brilliantly successful third, fourth, fifth, and sixth patrols.

<doc id="1085490" wikidata="Q4386913" url="?curid=1085490" title="New Brunswick Equal Opportunity program">
<text>The New Brunswick Equal Opportunity Program () was a government program that transformed social services in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. It was begun in 1967 under the leadership of premier Louis Robichaud.

The program was one of a series of progressive reforms brought by Robichaud&#x27;s Liberal Party government.

By the early 1960s New Brunswick had become a province with deep regional inequalities. The cause of this was that municipalities and counties were responsible for providing a wide range of services to their populations, but did not have an adequate tax base to pay for them. These services included health, welfare, education, and justice. In 1962 the Royal Commission on Finance and Municipal Taxation was formed. It proposed major services be operated by the province, funded by a market value assessment of property tax. 

Parts of the report were implemented as the Equal Opportunity Program on 1 January 1967. The province took responsibility for health, welfare, education, and justice. The poll tax was abolished, the number of school districts was reduced to 34 from over 400, and property tax was imposed.

Municipalities remained geographically unchanged, although they no longer provided social services. Local government in New Brunswick&#x27;s extensive rural areas, outside of municipalities, had been provided by county councils. These were abolished, leaving the county with no political role, although the old county and parish borders are still used to define the local service districts that replaced county councils, and for the census subdivisions of Census Canada.

<text>Mount Mirador is a mountain situated in the city of Baguio in the Cordillera Central mountain range, Luzon Island in the Philippines. A meteorological station was established in September 1909 and was the second highest station during that time with the first being the meteorological station in Mount Fuji. Said station was also equipped with a time ball and a typhoon signal for the benefit of Baguio city.

The mountain provided pockets of Japanese resistance against the USAFIP-NL military and guerrilla regiment during the liberation of Baguio city.

<doc id="1085495" wikidata="Q2973853" url="?curid=1085495" title="Division of Stirling">
<text>The Division of Stirling was an Australian electoral division in the inner northern and beachside suburbs of Perth, Western Australia, which included a large portion of the local government area of the City of Stirling.

==History==

The electorate was created in the Western Australia redistribution of 10 August 1955, and was named after Sir James Stirling, the 19th-century founding lieutenant governor and governor of Western Australia. Stirling covered a demographically diverse area, including several affluent beachside suburbs, as well as working class areas further inland. As a result, Stirling was often a marginal seat, alternating between the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party of Australia.

Unlike some marginal seats on the east coast, such as Eden-Monaro, Stirling was not often seen as a reliable barometer for winning government. For example, longtime Labor member Harry Webb survived the massive Coalition landslide of 1966, only to become one of two Labor MPs from the state to be defeated in 1972 even as Labor ended 23 years of Coalition rule. While it elected five government MPs, all but three of its members have spent at least one term in opposition.

Besides Webb, who held the seat for all but one term from its creation in 1955 until his defeat in 1972, the seat&#x27;s most prominent member was Labor&#x27;s Ron Edwards, who was Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives from 29 August 1989 to 8 February 1993. It had been expected that if the 1993 election had not been called so soon after Leo McLeay&#x27;s resignation as Speaker or if Edwards had held his seat in the election upon the re-election of the Keating government, Edwards would have been elected Speaker.

Opinion polls in the leadup to the 2004 election had suggested a close result in Stirling, leaning towards the possibility of sitting Labor member Jann McFarlane retaining her seat. This was thought to have been more likely after Paul Afkos, the original Liberal candidate, was forced to resign after he was revealed to have borrowed money from a convicted drug dealer. A local businessman, Michael Keenan, was brought in as his replacement, and maintained the close difference in polling. However, on election day, the swing to the Liberal Party both statewide and nationwide was stronger than expected, and Keenan was ultimately successful in unseating McFarlane. The &quot;Stirling Times&quot;, a local newspaper, speculated in October 2006 that McFarlane, at that time a Stirling councillor, might contest the seat again in 2007. On 28 November 2006, former SAS officer and outspoken opponent of the Iraq War Peter Tinley accepted an offer from Kim Beazley to run as the ALP candidate in the 2007 election. Ahead of the 2010 election, Labor preselected Louise Durack, a social worker and executive director of People With Disabilities (WA) and past candidate for the state seat of Ocean Reef, to run for the seat. Keenan was re-elected at the 2010 federal election.
It was confirmed in June 2021 that this division would be abolished at the 2022 federal election, with its area redistributed to the neighbouring divisions of Cowan, Curtin, Moore and Perth.

==Geography==
Since 1984, federal electoral division boundaries in Australia have been determined at redistributions by a redistribution committee appointed by the Australian Electoral Commission. Redistributions occur for the boundaries of divisions in a particular state, and they occur every seven years, or sooner if a state&#x27;s representation entitlement changes or when divisions of a state are malapportioned.

The division included the northern majority of the City of Stirling and a small portion of the City of Bayswater. Suburbs included

In the redistribution that resulted in Stirling&#x27;s abolition, the suburbs it contained west of the Mitchell Freeway were divided into two. In the north, the suburbs of Carine and Watermans Bay and the northern areas of Gwelup, Karrinyup and Trigg were allocated to Moore, while in the south, the remaining southern portions of Gwelup, Karrinyup and Trigg, along with Stirling&#x27;s portion of Scarborough, were allocated to Curtin. East of the Mitchell Freeway, the southern fringe of the electorate, containing the suburbs of Joondanna, Tuart Hill and Yokine, along with the southern portion of Dianella, the south-east of Osborne Park, and Stirling&#x27;s section of Morley, were allocated to Perth. The remainder of the electorate, approximately half of its total area, and including the suburbs of Balcatta, Balga, Hamersley, Mirrabooka, Nollamara, Stirling, and Westminster, along with the northern sections of Dianella and Morley and the north-east of Osborne Park, were allocated to Cowan.

<doc id="1085508" wikidata="Q336445" url="?curid=1085508" title="Lat (cartoonist)">
<text>Dato&#x27; Mohammad Nor bin Mohammad Khalid (; born 4 March 1951), more commonly known as Lat, is a Malaysian cartoonist. Winner of the Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 2002, Lat has published more than 20 volumes of cartoons since he was 13 years old. His works mostly illustrate Malaysia&#x27;s social and political scenes, portraying them in a comedic light without bias. Lat&#x27;s best known work is &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot; (1979), which has been published in several countries across the world. In 1994, the Sultan of Perak bestowed him the honorific title of &quot;datuk&quot;, in recognition of the cartoonist&#x27;s work in helping to promote social harmony and understanding through his cartoons. Lat also works for the government to improve the city&#x27;s social security.

Born in a village, Lat spent his youth in the countryside before moving to the city at the age of 11. While in school, he supplemented his family&#x27;s income by contributing cartoon strips to newspapers and magazines. He was 13 years old when he achieved his first published comic book, &quot;Tiga Sekawan&quot; (&quot;Three Friends Catch a Thief&quot;). After failing to attain the grades that were required to continue education beyond high school, Lat became a newspaper reporter. In 1974, he switched careers to be an editorial cartoonist. His works, reflecting his view about Malaysian life and the world, are staple features in national newspapers such as &quot;New Straits Times&quot; and &quot;Berita Minggu&quot;. He adapted his life experiences and published them as his autobiographies, &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot; and &quot;Town Boy&quot;, telling stories of rural and urban life with comparisons between the two.

Lat&#x27;s style has been described as reflective of his early influences, &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot;. He has, however, come into his own way of illustration, drawing the common man on the streets with bold strokes in pen and ink. A trademark of his Malay characters is their three-loop noses. Lat paid attention to family life and children because of his idolisation of Raja Hamzah, a senior cartoonist who was also popular in the 1960s with his comics about swashbuckling heroes. Rejabhad, a well-respected cartoonist, was Lat&#x27;s mentor, and imbued the junior cartoonist with a preference to be sensitive to the subjects of his works. Lat&#x27;s attention to details gained him popularity, endearing his works to the masses who find them believable and unbiased.

Aside from writing and publishing cartoons, Lat has ventured into the fields of animation, merchandising, and theme parks with his creations. His name and works are recognised internationally; foreign cartoonists, such as Matt Groening and Sergio Aragonés, admire his art, and foreign governments invite Lat to tour their countries, hoping to gain greater exposure for their countries through Lat&#x27;s cartoons of his experiences in them. After 27 years of living and working in Kuala Lumpur, Lat moved back to Ipoh for a more sedate lifestyle in semi-retirement.

== Early life and education ==

Mohammad Nor Mohd Khalid was born on 4 March 1951 in Kota Bharu, a small settlement located in Gopeng, Perak, Malaysia. His father, Mohd Khalid Mohd Noh (1923–1975) was a government clerk with the Malaysian Armed Forces and his mother, Nor Azian Said (1921–2011), a housewife. Khalid was a stocky boy with a cherubic face, which led his family to nickname him &quot;bulat&quot; (round). His friends shortened it to &quot;Lat&quot;; it became the name by which he was more commonly known in his &quot;kampung&quot; and later in the world. Lat was the eldest child in his family, and he often played in the jungles, plantations, and tin mines with his friends. Their toys were usually improvised from everyday sundries and items of nature. Lat liked to doodle with materials provided by his parents, and his other forms of recreation were reading comics and watching television; Lat idolised local cartoonist Raja Hamzah, who was popular with his tales of swashbuckling Malay heroes. Malaysian art critic and historian Redza Piyadasa believes Lat&#x27;s early years in the &quot;kampung&quot; ingrained the cartoonist with pride in his &quot;kampung&quot; roots and a &quot;peculiarly Malay&quot; outlook—&quot;full of [...] gentleness and refinement&quot;.

Lat&#x27;s formal education began at a local Malay-medium &quot;kampung&quot; (village) school (one of the two precursors of today&#x27;s national government predominantly Malay-medium schools, the other being the English-medium vernacular school, before both schools merged due to educational reforms in 1970-75 as well as post-independence decolonisation); these institutions often taught in the vernacular and did not aspire to any such academic attainment. The boy changed schools several times; the nature of his father&#x27;s job moved the family from one military base to another across the country, until they settled back at his birthplace in 1960. A year later, Lat passed the Special Malay Class Examination, qualifying him to attend an English-medium boarding feeder primary school, then known as the GES Pasir Puteh, or its current name, Cator Road National Primary School (SK Cator Avenue) in the state&#x27;s capital, Ipoh. His achievement helped his father make the decision to sell their &quot;kampung&quot; estate and move the family to the town; society in those days considered education at an English-medium school a springboard to a good future. Lat then continued his secondary education at Anderson School, Perak&#x27;s &quot;premier non-missionary English-medium school&quot;. Redza highlights Lat&#x27;s move to Ipoh for higher schooling as a significant point in the cartoonist&#x27;s development; the multi-racial environment helped establish his diverse friendships, which in turn broadened his cultural perspectives.

At the age of nine, Lat began to supplement his family&#x27;s income through his artistic skills by drawing comics and selling them to his friends. Four years later, in 1964, the young cartoonist achieved his first published work: a local movie magazine—&quot;Majalah Filem&quot;—printed his comic strips, paying him with movie tickets. Lat&#x27;s first comic book publication, &quot;Tiga Sekawan Menangkap Penchuri&quot; (&quot;Three Friends Catch a Thief&quot;), was published by Sinaran Brothers that year. The company had accepted Lat&#x27;s submission, mistaking him for an adult and paying him 25 Malaysian ringgits (RM) for a story about three friends who band together to catch thieves. In 1968, at the age of 17, Lat started penning &quot;Keluarga Si Mamat&quot; (&quot;Mamat″s Family&quot;), a comic strip for &quot;Berita Minggu&quot; (the Sunday edition of &quot;Berita Harian&quot;). The series ran in the paper every week for 26 years. Although still a schoolboy, Lat was earning a monthly income of RM100, a large sum in those days, from his cartoons. His education finished two years later at the end of Form 5; his Third Grade in the Senior Cambridge examinations was not enough for him to advance to Form 6. Graduating with an education equivalent to that of high school, Lat started looking for a job and had his sights set on becoming an illustrator.

== Reporter to cartoonist ==

Moving to the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, Lat applied for a cartoonist&#x27;s position at &quot;Berita Harian&quot;. He was told there was no vacancy, but the paper&#x27;s editor, Abdul Samad Ismail, offered him the post of a crime reporter. Lat accepted, a decision he explained was borne from necessity rather than choice: &quot;It was a question of survival. I had to earn money to help support the family.&quot; At that time, Lat&#x27;s father had fallen seriously ill and could not work which led to his premature death at the age of 52 in 1975, when Lat was 24 years old; Lat had to become the breadwinner of his family. Aside from taking the job, he continued contributing cartoons to other publications. Lat was later transferred to &quot;Berita Harian&quot;″s parent publication, &quot;New Straits Times&quot;. Moving throughout the city to report on crimes gave Lat opportunities to observe and interact with the myriads of lives in the urban landscape, enabling him to gather material for his cartoons and increasing his understanding of the world. Nevertheless, he felt he lacked the persistently inquisitive nature needed to succeed as a crime reporter. Furthermore, his &quot;breathtakingly detailed, lurid and graphically gory descriptions&quot; of the aftermaths of crimes had to be frequently toned down by his seniors. Lat became convinced that he was a failure at his job, and his despondency led him to tender his resignation. Samad, believing Lat had a bright future with the press, furiously rejected the letter.

Lat&#x27;s career took a turn for the better on 10 February 1974; &quot;Asia Magazine&quot;, a periodical based in Hong Kong, published his cartoons about &quot;Bersunat&quot;—a circumcision ceremony which all Malaysian boys of the Islamic faith have to undergo (primarily from the Malay, Orang Asli, Kadazan-Dusun, Bisaya, Indian, Melanau, Rungus, Tidung, Bajau, Murut, Suluk and Orang Sungai communities; for the minority remainder of Malaysia&#x27;s majority Muslim population originate from the Dayak, Orang Ulu and Chinese ethnicities). The cartoons impressed Tan Sri Lee Siew Yee, editor-in-chief of the &quot;New Straits Times&quot;. Lee found Lat&#x27;s portrayal of the important ceremony humorous yet sensitive, and grumbled that the newspaper should have hired the artist. He was surprised to be told that Lat was already working within his organisation. Lat was called to Lee&#x27;s office to have a talk, which raised the reporter&#x27;s profile in the company. He became the paper&#x27;s column cartoonist, taking up a position created for him by Samad, now deputy editor of the &quot;New Straits Times&quot;. His first duty was to document Malaysian culture in a series of cartoons titled &quot;Scenes of Malaysian Life&quot;. The newspaper also sent him to study for four months at St Martin&#x27;s School of Art in London, where he was introduced to English editorial cartoons and newspapers. Returning to Malaysia full of fascination with his experience, Lat transformed &quot;Scenes of Malaysian Life&quot; into a series of editorial cartoons. His approach proved popular, and at the end of 1975 he was appointed full-time cartoonist with total freedom in his work.

Lat produced a steady stream of editorial cartoons that entertained Malaysian society. By 1978, two collections of his works (&quot;Lots of Lat&quot; and &quot;Lat&#x27;s Lot&quot;) had been compiled and sold to the public. Although Malaysians knew of Lat through &quot;Scenes of Malaysian Life&quot;, it was his next work that propelled him into national consciousness and international recognition. In 1979, Berita Publishing Sdn. Bhd.–a print publication subsidiary of the New Straits Times Press–published Lat&#x27;s &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot;, an autobiographical cartoon account of his youth. The book was a commercial hit; according to Lat, the first printing—60,000 to 70,000 copies—sold out within four months of the book&#x27;s release. Readers of the book were captivated by his &quot;heart-warming&quot; portrayal of Malaysian rural life, rendered with &quot;scribbly black-and-white sketches&quot; and accompanied by &quot;simple but eloquent prose&quot;. By 2012, the book has been reprinted 18 times and published in several other countries in various languages, including Portuguese, French, and Japanese. The success of &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot; established Lat as the &quot;most renowned cartoonist in Malaysia.&quot;

== After &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot; ==

In 1981, &quot;Town Boy&quot; was published. It continued &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot;″s story, telling of the protagonist&#x27;s teenage life in an urban setting. Two more compilations of Lat&#x27;s editorial cartoons (&quot;With a Little Bit of Lat&quot; and &quot;Lots More Lat&quot;) were published and the number of people who recognised him continued to grow. In 1984, partly from a desire to step away from the limelight, Lat resigned from the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; to become a freelancer, but continued to draw &quot;Scenes of Malaysian Life&quot; for the newspaper. He set up his own company, Kampung Boy Sendirian Berhad (Village Boy private limited), to oversee the merchandising of his cartoon characters and publishing of his books. In 2009, Kampung Boy partnered Sanrio and Hit Entertainment in a project to open an indoor theme park which would later be called as Puteri Harbour Family Theme Park in Nusajaya, Johor in August 2012. One of the park&#x27;s attractions will be the sight of performers dressed up as &quot;Kampung Boy&quot; characters beside those in Hello Kitty and Bob the Builder costumes and also reported in August 2012 will be a Lat-inspired diner called &quot;Lat&#x27;s Place&quot;. It will be designed in a Malaysian village setting, coupled with animations for patrons to interact with.

Lat has experimented with media other than paper. In 1993 he produced a short animated feature, &quot;Mina Smiles&quot;, for Unesco; the video, featuring a female lead, was for a literacy campaign. In conjunction with 30th anniversary of his cartooning career, Lat, through his company, Kampung Boy Sdn. Bhd. published a book titled &quot;Lat: 30 Years Later&quot;. Released in November 1994, a 166-page hardcover and softcover book features his selected newspaper and magazine drawings dates back from 1964 as well as excerpts from &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot; and his other notable works. He also wrote his biography in a section called &quot;Lat on Lat&quot;. Personal concerns motivated Lat for his next foray into animation; judging that Western animation of the 1980s and 90s had negative influences, he wanted to produce a series for Malaysian children that espoused local values. The result was &quot;Kampung Boy&quot; the television series (1997), an adaptation of his trademark comic. The 26-episode series received positive reviews for technical details and content. There were comments on its similarities to &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and on its English which was not entirely local. His most recent involvement with animation was in 2009; &quot;Lat&#x27;s Window to the World&quot;, a musical animated feature, played at the Petronas Philharmonic Hall. Lat had been commissioned to help create three animated vignettes based on &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot; to accompany the instruments of the Malaysian Philharmonic Orchestra. The scores, composed by Carl Davis, complemented Lat&#x27;s visuals, capturing the spirit of &quot;kampung&quot; childhood in a &quot;simple, idyllic past&quot;.

In 1999, after 27 years of living in Kuala Lumpur, Lat moved back to Ipoh with his family. Aside from retreating slightly from the cartooning scene, he wanted to be close to his old &quot;kampung&quot; and let his children experience life in a small town or village; he had married in 1978, and the couple have four children—two daughters and two sons. Lat said that raising his children has helped him cope with the pressures of his fame and made him realise that he might be losing touch with the new generation of Malaysians who have different tastes in cartoons. His wife helps him in his work, scanning his completed cartoons and emailing them to the newspaper offices in Kuala Lumpur. Lat still draws with his usual pens and inks, avoiding the use of computers except to read his emails. In 1999, he set up his official website called Lat House (www.lathouse.com.my), however, the website went defunct in 2004. From August to September 2003, Lat exhibited 59 of his works on aviation at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA), in Sepang, Selangor in an exhibition called Lat@KLIA. The exhibition&#x27;s objective was to provide a chance for KLIA passengers and visitors to enjoy his unique perspective of the airport since it started operations. Lat released his coffee table book, &quot;Lat: The Early Series&quot; on 27 April 2009. Published by the NSTP through its Resources Centre, the 204-page hardcover contains his selected works that compiled into 8 categories as well as his never before seen photos and personal items. In 2011–12, he is to join other artists from around the world in Italy for the Civitella Ranieri Fellowship programme. During their one-month stay, they are encouraged to share ideas in an environment fostered to stimulate their creativity.

Lat&#x27;s new editorial comic, &quot;Forever Lat&quot; was released in August 2014 by MPH Publishing. It contains a compilation of all his published works in the &quot;New Straits Times&quot; as well as unpublished and new works. His autobiographical memoir, &quot;Lat: My Life and Cartoons&quot; was launched on November 19, 2016. Published by Editions Didier Millet (EDM), the book was co-written by Lat and former NST senior editor, Syed Nadzri Syed Harun. In 2019, Lat partnered with Faber-Castell for the Grip X Celebrates The Diversity of Malaysia with Lat campaign to promote the Grip X pen and his artworks that were drawn using the pen. In April 2021, Lat announced that he would publish a sequel to his 1989 graphic novel, &quot;Mat Som&quot; after a three-decade hiatus with its focus on younger generation were in the midst of trying to find their purpose in life. According to Lat, the idea to publish a second book of &quot;Mat Som&quot; was first mooted in March 2017 while he was in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Though the book was expected to be released in July 2021, however, as of 2024, the anticipated publication is yet to be materialized. His art gallery, Galeri Rumah Lat (Lat&#x27;s House Gallery) was opened to public in July 8, 2023 and officiated by Sultan of Perak, Sultan Nazrin Shah. The gallery exhibits some of his works, awards and accolades as well as his personal items.

== Art style ==
Lat covers various genres in his works. His portfolio is diverse; John A. Lent, a scholar of Asian cartoons, found it to difficult to classify the cartoonist into any particular field. In his &quot;Keluarga Si Mamat&quot; series, Lat drew slapsticks and satires that examined the encounters between traditional and modern values. Humorous stories of children at play also populated the series. Jennifer Rodrigo Willmott, writer for &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, stated that: 

Using a large cast of characters—a wide assortment of personalities and cultures—allows Lat to comment on a wider range of topics than is possible with a small group of characters. Malaysian comics scholar Muliyadi Muhamood commented that the humour in Lat&#x27;s cartoons is evoked through graphical and textual means; &quot;short, compact dialogues&quot; and puns form the text while &quot;facial expressions and actions&quot; of the characters help to bring out the funny side of things. Muliyadi further stated that Lat&#x27;s works offer many levels of interpretation; one reader would laugh at Lat&#x27;s cartoon for its slapstick, while another would find the same work hilarious for its subtle critique of society. As an example, Muliyadi referred to a &quot;Keluarga Si Mamat&quot; strip published in 1972. Malaysia was facing a shortage of qualified physical education teachers then, and such duties were often placed on the shoulders of teachers of other faculties. Lat illustrated an obese teacher who conducted a physical education session to his eventual collapse. Muliyadi suggested that the cartoon could be interpreted as a simple tease of the teacher&#x27;s plight, a suggestion to examine the curriculum taught (change physical education to an informal session), a remark on the shortage of teachers, or more extremely, a criticism of the government&#x27;s failure to prevent the situation from happening.

The narration of Lat&#x27;s early cartoons, such as &quot;Tiga Sekawan&quot; and &quot;Keluarga Si Mamat&quot;, was in Malay. His later works, however, were mostly in English; &quot;Scenes of Malaysian Life&quot; ran only in the English-language &quot;New Straits Times&quot;. The English idiom in his works reflects the local pidgin form—&quot;Malglish&quot;—containing smatterings of Malay words and a simpler grammatical structure. After a string of successful English publications, Lat worried he had neglected Malaysians who were not proficient in English. He drew &quot;Mat Som&quot;, a story of a &quot;kampung&quot; boy who moved to the city to work as a writer and courted a pretty city girl. The comic was in Malay and a commercial hit; its first print of 30,000 copies sold out in three months. &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot; journalist Suhaini Aznam remarked that Lat&#x27;s strength was his ability to portray the plight of the common man in a satiric light without any form of bias.

=== Early style ===
Lat&#x27;s artistic skills were cultivated from youth and self-taught. The cartoonist believes he inherited the talent and interest from his father, who doodled as a hobby and was notorious for his sense of humour as the &quot;village jester&quot;. Lat says his siblings were also gifted in drawing, but they never bothered to develop their talents. His parents actively encouraged him to develop his artistic skills, although his father occasionally told him not to make a career of it. He also received encouragement from outside his family; Lat&#x27;s primary school teacher Mrs Moira Hew (the inspiration for one of his characters, the Butterfly-Glassed Lady), helped nurture his gift, frequently asking him to illustrate lessons in class. Her teachings expanded Lat&#x27;s mind and made him more receptive to ideas that looked beyond his &quot;kampung&quot;.
The early influences on his art style were from the West. Like most of the Malaysian children in the 1950s, Lat watched Hanna-Barbera cartoons (&quot;The Flintstones&quot; and &quot;The Jetsons&quot;) on television and read imported British comics, such as &quot;The Dandy&quot; and &quot;The Beano&quot;. He studied them and used their styles and themes in his early doodles. After the foreign influences in his works were noticed by a family friend, Lat was advised by his father to observe and draw upon ideas from their surroundings instead. Heeding the advice, the young cartoonist intimated himself with local happenings. &quot;Tiga Sekawan&quot; was conceived as a humorous crime-fighting story of a local flavour. &quot;Keluarga Si Mamat&quot; and its protagonist were named after his youngest brother Mamat, its stories based on Lat&#x27;s observations of his fellow villagers and schoolmates. The inspiration for his cartoons about &quot;Bersunat&quot; came about when he was on assignment at a hospital. As he was taking breaks from investigating the dead victims of crime brought to the morgue, Lat chanced upon the circumcisions performed by the hospital on ethnic Malay boys. He found their experiences clinical, devoid of the elaborate and personal ceremonies that celebrated his own rite to manhood in the village. Lat felt compelled to illustrate the differences between life in his &quot;kampung&quot; and the city.

When Lat formally entered the cartooning industry, he was not totally unfamiliar with the profession. He had the benefit of the mentorship of Rejabhad, an experienced political cartoonist. Rejabhad was well respected by his countrymen, who titled him the &quot;&quot;penghulu&quot; (chief) of Malay cartoonists&quot;. After noticing Lat&#x27;s submissions to newspapers and magazines, he corresponded with the young cartoonist. When Rejabhad was requested by Lat&#x27;s mother to take care of her 15-year-old son in the cartooning industry, he accepted. He gave advice and influenced Lat&#x27;s growth as a cartoonist. Lat treated Rejabhad with great respect, holding up his mentor as a role model. The affection and admiration was mutual. Thirty-six years after taking Lat under his wing, Rejabhad recounted their relationship in these words:
Rejabhad was not the first local figure to have exerted an influence on Lat. Raja Hamzah, popular with his action comics and ghost stories, was Lat&#x27;s &quot;hero&quot; in his childhood. It was Raja Hamzah&#x27;s cartoons of local swashbuckling adventurers that inspired Lat to become a cartoonist. &quot;Tiga Sekawan&quot; was the culmination of that desire, the success after numerous failed submissions and an affirmation to Lat that he could become a cartoonist like his idol. Raja Hamzah also had success with comic strips on family life, such as &quot;Mat Jambul&#x27;s Family&quot; and &quot;Dol Keropok and Wak Tempeh&quot;. These cartoons imbued Lat with a fascination of family life and the antics of children, which served him well in his later works. Lat was interested in studying the details of his surroundings and capturing them in his works. &quot;Keluarga Si Mamat&quot; and &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot; faithfully depicted their characters&#x27; appearances and attitudes. Their narrations were written in a style that was natural to the locals. Thus, Lat was able to make his readers believe his stories and characters were substantially &quot;Malay&quot;.

=== Later style ===
After his study trip to London in 1975, Lat&#x27;s works exhibited the influences of editorial cartoonists such as Frank Dickens, Ralph Steadman, and Gerald Scarfe. In 1997, Ron Provencher, a professor emeritus at Northern Illinois University, reported that Lat&#x27;s style reminded his informants on the Malaysian cartooning scene of &quot;The Beano&quot;. Muliyadi elaborated that &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot;″s &quot;theme of a child&#x27;s world&quot; is evident in Lat&#x27;s &quot;Keluarga Si Mamat&quot;. Others commented that Lat&#x27;s art stood out on its own. Singaporean cartoonist Morgan Chua believed that Lat &quot;managed to create an impressively local style while remaining original&quot;, and although comics historian Isao Shimizu found Lat&#x27;s lines &quot;somewhat crude&quot;, he noted that the cartoonist&#x27;s work was &quot;highly original&quot; and &quot;full of life&quot;. Redza&#x27;s judgement was that &quot;The Beano&quot; and &quot;The Dandy&quot; were &quot;early formative [influences]&quot; on Lat before he came into his own style. Lent gave his assessment in 1999:
Lat&#x27;s work with pen and ink so impressed Larry Gonick that the American cartoonist was tempted into experimenting with this medium for part of his &quot;The Cartoon History of the Universe&quot;. Gonick tried to use the medium as he did his regular brushes; however, the results proved unsatisfactory. Lat occasionally colours his works, such as those in his &quot;Kampung Boy: Yesterday and Today&quot; (1993), using watercolour or marker pens. According to Lent, Redza judged that Lat had &quot;elevated cartooning to the level of &#x27;high visual arts&#x27; through his social commentary and &#x27;construction of the landscape&#x27;&quot;. The art critic was not alone in having a high regard for Lat&#x27;s works. Jaafar Taib, cartoonist and editor of Malaysian satirical magazine &quot;Gila-Gila&quot;, found Lat&#x27;s cartoons retained their humour and relevance throughout time. He explained that this quality arose from the well-thought-out composition of Lat&#x27;s works, which helped to clearly express the ideas behind the cartoons.

=== Sensitive topics ===

At the time that Lat started drawing for the &quot;New Straits Times&quot;, local political cartoonists were gentle in their treatment of Malaysian politicians; the politicians&#x27; features were recreated faithfully and criticisms were voiced in the form of subtle poems. Lat, however, pushed the boundaries; although he portrayed the politicians with dignity, he exaggerated notable features of their appearances and traits. Lat recalled that in 1974, he was told to change one of his works, which portrayed Malaysian Prime Minister Abdul Razak from the back. Lee refused to print the work unchanged, and pointedly asked the cartoonist &quot;You want to go to jail?!&quot; In 1975, however, Lat&#x27;s next attempt at a political cartoon won Lee&#x27;s approval. The satire featured a caricature of Razak&#x27;s successor—Hussein Onn—on the back of a camel, travelling back to Kuala Lumpur from Saudi Arabia; its punchline was Hussein&#x27;s hailing of his mount to slow down after reading news that a pay raise for the civil service would be enacted on his return.

Malaysia&#x27;s political class grew comfortable with Lat&#x27;s caricatures, and like the rest of the country, found them entertaining. Muliyadi described Lat&#x27;s style as &quot;subtle, indirect, and symbolic&quot;, following traditional forms of Malaysian humour in terms of ethics and aesthetics. The cartoonist&#x27;s compliance with tradition in his art earned him the country&#x27;s respect. When Lat was critical of politicians, he portrayed them in situations &quot;unusual, abnormal or unexpected&quot; to their status or personalities, using the contrast to make the piece humorous. Mahathir Mohamad, Malaysia&#x27;s fourth Prime Minister, was Lat&#x27;s frequent target for much of his political career, providing more than 20 years worth of material to the cartoonist—enough for a 146-page compilation &quot;Dr Who?!&quot; (2004). Lat&#x27;s political wit targeted not only local politicians, but also Israeli actions in the Middle East and foreign figures such as prominent Singaporean politician Lee Kwan Yew. Despite his many works of political nature, Lat does not consider himself a political cartoonist and openly admits that there are others better than he is in this field.

Lat prefers to portray his ideas with as little antagonism as possible. He heeds the advice of his mentor, Rejabhad, and is aware of sensitivities, especially those of race, culture, and religion. As he devises the concept for his cartoon, he eliminates anything he believes to be malicious or insensitive. At the Fourth Asian Cartoon Exhibition in Tokyo, Lat revealed that when it came to making religious comments in his work, he only did so on his own religion (Islam). In such cases, Lat uses his art to help educate the young about his faith. Lat trusts his editors to do their jobs and cull what is socially unacceptable for print. In an interview, he revealed his discomfort with the concept of self-publishing, believing that unadulterated or unsupervised cartoon drawing could lead to &quot;rubbish&quot;. He prefers to be assertive in areas with which he is comfortable or competent. Lat is adamant on not changing what he has already drawn; several pieces of his cartoons remain unpublished because editors refused to print them unchanged. When that happens, the editors spike (blank) the space for his regular cartoon in the newspaper. Lat admitted of his unprinted works: &quot;Okay, maybe I&#x27;ve pushed the line a little bit, but I&#x27;ve never got into trouble and, frankly, only a handful of my cartoons were ever spiked.&quot;

== Interests and beliefs ==

Music has played a crucial part in Lat&#x27;s life since his youth; he revealed in an interview that listening to songs such as Peggy March&#x27;s &quot;I Will Follow Him&quot; and Paul &amp; Paula&#x27;s &quot;Hey Paula&quot; helped him learn English. Listening to music had also become an important ritual in his work, providing him with inspiration in his art. When he sketches &quot;fashionable girls&quot;, he puts on Paul McCartney&#x27;s tracks, and switches to Indonesian gamelan when he needs to draw intricate details. He enjoys pop music, particularly rock music of the 1950s and 60s, listening to The Beatles, Bob Dylan, and Elvis Presley. Lat is also partial to country music, and to singers such as Hank Williams and Roy Rogers because he finds their tunes &quot;humble&quot;. His enjoyment of music is more than a passive interest; he is proficient with the guitar and piano, and can play them by ear.

Malaysian society used to look down on cartoonists, assuming that those who practised the trade were intellectually inferior to writers, or were lesser artists; Lat was not the only cartoonist to be paid with movie tickets in the 1950s; Rejabhad once received one ticket for ten cartoons, and many others were likewise recompensed, or were paid very little money. Despite the lowly reputation of his profession at that time, Lat is very proud of his choice of career; he once took umbrage with an acquaintance&#x27;s girlfriend for her presumption that the words and ideas in his cartoons were not his own. Drawing cartoons is more than a career to him:
The elongated &quot;L&quot; in Lat&#x27;s signature was born from his joy in completing a work. He professes that his primary aim in drawing cartoons is to make people laugh; his role as a cartoonist is &quot;to translate the reaction of the people into humorous cartoons&quot;. He has no intentions to preach his beliefs through his art, believing that people should be free to make up their own minds and that the best he can do is to make readers ponder the deeper meanings behind a humorous scene. The reward he has sought from drawing since his youth is simple:
Lat&#x27;s pride in cartooning pushed him to promote the art as a respectable career. In 1991, he banded together with fellow cartoonists Zunar, Rejabhad, and Muliyadi to set up &quot;Pekartun&quot; (Persatuan Kartunis Selangor dan Kuala Lumpur). This association holds exhibitions and forums, to raise public awareness of cartooning and to build relationships among its members. It also helps to clarify legal issues such as copyrights to its members, and acts as an intermediary between them and the government. In the previous year, Lat&#x27;s company, Kampung Boy, had organised the first Malaysian International Cartoonists Gathering, bringing together cartoonists from several countries across the world to exhibit their art and participate in conferences to educate others in their work. In Redza&#x27;s opinion, Lat played a great role in making cartooning respectable among his fellow Malaysians.

Aside from promoting the rights of fellow cartoonists, Lat developed an interest in encouraging conservation of the natural environment. Several of his works caricature the consequences of pollution and over-exploitation of resources. Invited to give a speech at the 9th Osaka International Symposium on Civilisation in 1988, Lat talked about the environmental problems associated with overpopulation and heavy industrialisation. He further reminisced about the simple cleaner life he had enjoyed as a child in the &quot;kampung&quot;. In 1977, when a protest was organised against logging activities in the Endau-Rompin Reserves, Lat helped gain support for the movement by drawing cartoons in the newspapers that highlighted the issue. Lat is also particularly concerned over what he sees as the negative side of urban development. He believes that such developments have contributed to the loss of the traditional way of life; people forget the old culture and values as they ingratiate themselves with the rapid pace and sophistication of urban lifestyles. His defence and fondness of the old ways are manifested in his &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot;, &quot;Town Boy&quot;, &quot;Mat Som&quot;, and &quot;Kampung Boy: Yesterday and Today&quot;, which champion the old lifestyles as spiritually superior.

== Influence and legacy ==

Recognised globally, and widely popular in his country, Lat has been styled &quot;cultural hero&quot;, &quot;his nation&#x27;s conscience in cartoon form&quot; and &quot;Malaysian icon&quot; among other effusive titles. The Malaysian Press Institute felt Lat had &quot;become an institution in [his] own right&quot;, honouring him with their Special Jury Award in 2005. Cartoonists in the Southeast Asian region, such as Muliyadi, Chua, and Rejabhad, have given high praise to Lat, and his admirers further abroad include North American cartoonists Matt Groening and Eddie Campbell. Groening, creator of &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, gave a testimonial for the United States version of &quot;The Kampung Boy&quot;, praising Lat&#x27;s signature work as &quot;one of the all-time great cartoon books&quot;. Sergio Aragonés, the creator of &quot;Groo the Wanderer&quot;, is another of Lat&#x27;s American fans. After visiting Malaysia in 1987, Aragonés used the experience to create a story for Groo in which the bumbling swordsman chances on the isle of Felicidad, whose inhabitants and natural habitat were modelled after those of the Southeast Asian country. Aragonés drew the noses of the islanders in Lat&#x27;s distinctive style, and named one of the prominent native characters—an inquisitive boy—after the Malaysian cartoonist.

Lent and Shimizu both suggest that the Malaysian comic industry began to boom after Lat joined the profession on a full-time basis in 1974. Lent further hazards that the cartoonist profession was made more respectable in Malaysia by the award to Lat in 1994 of a &quot;datuk&quot; title (equivalent to a knighthood). Bestowed on Lat by the Sultan of Perak, the title was Malaysia&#x27;s highest recognition of the cartoonist&#x27;s influence on his countrymen and his contributions to the country. Before Lat&#x27;s emergence, Malaysian cartooning was largely unappreciated by the public, despite the popular works of Raja Hamzah and Rejabhad. Lat&#x27;s successes showed Malaysians that they could thrive and succeed as cartoonists, and inspired them to look to the cartooning profession for potential careers. Several younger artists imitated his style in the hopes of capturing equivalent rewards. Zambriabu and Rasyid Asmawi copied the distinctive three loop noses and hairstyles of Lat&#x27;s characters. Others, such as Reggie Lee and Nan, incorporated Lat&#x27;s detailed &quot;thematic and stylistic approaches&quot; in their works. Muliyadi dubbed Lat the &quot;Father of Contemporary Malaysian Cartoons&quot;, for being the first Malaysian cartoonist to achieve global recognition and for helping to improve the industry&#x27;s image in their country.

The effects of Lat&#x27;s works were not confined to the artistic sector. In the period before his debut, Malaysian cartoonists supported calls for national unity. The characters in a cartoon were often of one race, and negative focus on the foibles of particular races or cultures worked its way into the mainstream. Such cartoons did not help to soothe racial tensions that were simmering then. The situation erupted with the racial riots of 1969, and for several years after these incidents relationships among the races were raw and fragile. According to Redza, Lat soothed the nation&#x27;s racial woes with his works. Drawing members of various races in his crowd scenes and showing their interactions with one another, Lat portrayed Malaysians in a gentle and unbiased comic manner. Redza pointed out although one may argue that Lat was forced into the role of racial and cultural mediator (because of his employment with his country&#x27;s &quot;leading English-language newspaper serving a multi-racial readership&quot;), he possessed the necessary qualities—intimate knowledge of various races and culture—to succeed in the job. Lat&#x27;s fans recognised the trademark of his oeuvre as &quot;a safe and nice humour that made everyone feel good and nostalgic by appealing to their benevolent sides rather than by poking at their bad sides&quot;. It proved to be a successful formula; more than 850,000 copies of his books were sold in the twelve years after the first compilation of his editorial cartoons went on sale in 1977. The comfort that readers sought from his works was such that when in September 2008 Lat deviated from his usual style, to draw a cartoon about racially charged politicking in his country, it shocked journalist Kalimullah Hassan. She found the illustration of a group of Malaysians huddled under an umbrella, taking shelter from a rain of xenophobic phrases, full of profound sadness.
Lat&#x27;s works have been used in academic studies—the fields of which are diverse, spanning law, urban planning, and diets. The academics use his drawings to help them illustrate their points in a humorous yet educational manner. Foreign embassy officials have sought Lat for his insight into the cultures of their societies. They have invited him to tour their countries, in the hope that he will record his experiences in cartoon form to share with the world. The first country to do so was the United States, followed by others such as Australia, Germany, and Japan. In 1998, Lat became the first cartoonist to be made an Eisenhower Fellow and revisited the United States; his research programme was the study of relationships among the many races in United States society. In 2007, the National University of Malaysia awarded him an honorary Doctorate in Anthropology and Sociology. Lat&#x27;s works are recognised as visual records of Malaysia&#x27;s cultural history; he was awarded a Fukuoka Asian Culture Prize in 2002 for preserving Malay rural culture in his works. In 2018, Lat was awarded the Tokoh Ar Ridzuan at the Perak state level of the &quot;Tokoh Maal Hijrah&quot; award. In 2019, the Taylor&#x27;s University honoured him a Honorary Doctorate in Arts during the university&#x27;s 18th convocation ceremony for his contribution to the development of the Malaysia&#x27;s visual arts. Lat was awarded the 2023 National Journalists&#x27; Day Award for his contribution in conveying information and educating the communities on various issues through his works that is done with humour and prudence with a dash of sarcasm. He also awarded the Royal Artist by the Sultan of Perak, Sultan Nazrin Shah, making him the first Perakian to receive a such award. In December 2023, he receives the Cai Zhizhong Comic Prize at the 3rd Cai Zhizhong Comic Prize Awards in Guangzhou, China. At the 2024 National Arts Award ceremony on 13 November 2024, Lat conferred the 9th National Artist Award by the Raja Permaisuri Agong, Raja Zarith Sofiah.

In 1986, Lat became the first cartoonist to exhibit his work at the National Museum in Kuala Lumpur; the event drew a record number of 600,000 visitors in two months. He is treated as a celebrity, and his cartoon characters decorate stamps, financial guides, and aeroplanes. When &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot; asked Malaysians in 2010 to rank which of 50 local personalities was most worthy of trust, Lat was returned fourth on the list. According to Jaafar, &quot;100% of Malaysians respect and admire Lat, and see a Malaysian truth, whether he is drawing a policeman, teachers, or hookers.&quot;

<text>West Kingsdown is a village and civil parish in the Sevenoaks district of Kent, England, on the A20 5 miles (8 km) southeast of Swanley, 5.5 miles (9 km) northeast of Sevenoaks and from London.

==The area==
The parish was part of Axstane Hundred and later Dartford Rural District. The village, because of its situation near London, grew considerably after the First World War from a relatively small farming community to a commuter village of around 5000 residents, expanding mainly on the northeast side of the A20. To the southwest of the main village are the rural housing developments of Knatts Valley and East Hill. To the north of the village lies the Brands Hatch motor racing circuit. There are four churches in the village: the parish church of St Edmund King and Martyr; West Kingsdown Baptist Church; the Roman Catholic church of St Bernadette; and Kings Church, an Evangelical church established in 1996.

==History==
;Village
Kingsdown, the former name of West Kingsdown village, traces its origins back to Anglo-Saxon settlements in the woods above the Darenth Valley. Farmers carved out pockets of land for arable farming. The Saxons also provided the name – &#x27;the King&#x27;s own hill pasture&#x27;. There is evidence that the parish church, St Edmund King and Martyr, was originally of Saxon construction. It appears that Edward the Confessor owned Kingsdown and the property passed into the ownership of William I following the Norman Conquest in 1066.

From 1066 to 1630 the ownership of the land in and around Kingsdown passed into the possession of a series of landlords, including Edward IV. From 1630 until 1784 there were absentee landlords. Records from 1664 show there were around 30 houses in the parish, so the population may have been around 150 people, a third of whom were too poor to pay tax. A census in 1676 recorded 90 people aged over 16. No-one was, or admitted to being – a Roman Catholic or a nonconformist. In this period roads through the village grew in importance and a turnpike was set up on what is now the A20 to provide income. Around 1780 the route was realigned, making it easier to travel through the village.

At the first national census in 1801 the population was recorded as 337. By 1901 the population had only risen to 506, falling to 407 in 1911 and 427 in 1927. In 1874 a National School was built on what is now School Lane. Post the First World War the relatively stable farming community became a scattering of holiday homes, garages, shacks and smallholdings as commuters settled outside London and found homes in the countryside. In 1918 there were two shopkeepers in the village. By 1938 there were six garages, nine shops and ten cafes.

Between 1921 and 1981 the number of Kingsdown residents grew substantially to nearly 5000. Cul-de-sac construction added to the existing roads and several park home estates were built for older residents. A new primary school on Fawkham Road was built to take the growing number of children. Electricity was introduced in 1937 but mains drainage was only installed in 1968. During this period Brands Hatch Farm opened its land to cyclists for racing, the precursor to Brand Hatch Racing Circuit. The A20 was widened to a dual carriageway (subsequently reduced to single carriageway) and the trees that lined the road lost to the village. The construction of the M20, taking traffic to Dover, meant that the village was no longer a major thoroughfare for cars, coaches and lorries.

In 1948 Kingsdown changed its name at the request of the Post Office to avoid confusion with other villages in east Kent with the same name and became West Kingsdown.

;Churches
A mention of a church at Kingsdown – the present St Edmund King and Martyr Church of England church – is found in tax records of 1287. The original construction, a Saxon church, was possibly constructed just before 1066, perhaps around 1030. It is possible that the church was the chapel built for the lord of the manor and served a small number of Saxon families who lived in huts around the church. The early building was a relatively simple structure built in stone and flint, comprising a nave, chancel and square tower. Extensions to the church were made in the twelfth century but these proved something of a disaster, weakening the building, and in the thirteenth century these were either demolished or fell down. The repairs were subsequently hidden by rendering, which was in turn later removed in the early 1900s. One of the interesting features of the church is the depiction of the story of Cain and Abel around one of the windows, which is dated around 1100.

In a census carried out in 1676 to establish how many Roman Catholics and nonconformists there were in the village no-one was, or admitted to being, a Roman Catholic or a nonconformist. In 1861 a toolshed was brought from the railway junction at Swanley to the site of the present Baptist Church on Fawkham Road and the Baptist Church was established as a visible part of the community. Based on other evidence it is reasonable to assume that there had been a Baptist community in the village from the 1830/1840s onwards, possibly as a result of a revival in North Kent at the beginning of the century. There are records of a congregation of 76 people meeting in 1851. The new &#x27;toolshed church&#x27; was erected on Fawkham Road, close to the junction with the London-Dover Road (A20). It opened officially on Wednesday, 11 December 1861. The toolshed was demolished in 1980 and a new Baptist church and church hall erected on the site by the church members, opening officially on 4 July 1981. The entrance to the church was refurbished in 2010.

Both the Roman Catholic church of St Bernadette and Kings Church, closed in 2015, were established in the village in the late 1900s.

;Windmill
West Kingsdown Windmill is a Grade II listed smock mill that was built in the early nineteenth century at Farningham. The windmill was marked on Greenwoods map of 1821 and the Farningham Tithe Map of 1840. In 1880, it was moved to Kingsdown, where there was already a post mill. The post mill burnt down in May 1909. The windmill is located on the east side of the village, off Pells Lane.

==Sport==
Brands Hatch motor racing circuit is located off the A20 on the north side of West Kingsdown. The circuit was used in 1926 as a grass track for bike riding and the first race held there in 1928 – a race between competitors riding bicycles and cross-country runners. The track hosted Formula 1 racing between 1964 and 1986 and runs major motor sport events during the year. In 2012 Brands Hatch was the venue for the Paralympic Games road cycling.

<text>Christianity is the third-largest religion in Malaysia. In the 2020 census, 9.1% of the Malaysian population identified themselves as Christians. About two-thirds of Malaysia&#x27;s Christian population lives in East Malaysia, in the states of Sabah and Sarawak. Adherents of Christianity represent a majority (50.1%) of the population in Sarawak, which is Malaysia&#x27;s largest state by land area. Christianity is one of four major religions, including Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism, that have a freedom protected by the law in Malaysia based on &quot;diversity law&quot; especially in East Malaysia. 

In 2020, half of Malaysian Christians were Catholic, 40% were Protestant and 10% belonged to other denominations.

In 2008, the major Christian denominations in the country included Catholics, Anglicans (represented by the Church of the Province of South East Asia, which also covers Anglicans in Singapore and Brunei), Baptists, Brethren, non-denominational churches, independent Charismatic churches, Lutherans, Methodists, Presbyterians and Sidang Injil Borneo.

==History==
Early Christian presence in the Malay Archipelago can be traced to Persian and Turkic traders with Nestorian origins from as early as the 7th century and to early Arab Christian, Persian and Nestorian traders in Malacca prior to the Portuguese conquest in 1511. The British acquired Penang in 1786, and in 1795 took over Malacca, which had been conquered by the Dutch in 1641. Catholic priests from Thailand established the Major Seminary in Penang in 1810. The LMS was based in Malacca and Penang from 1815, but most Protestant missions collapsed after 1842 when it became possible to enter China. Catholic leadership remained, but was divided between Portuguese and French. Open Brethren ministry dates from 1860 and Methodist from 1885. Presbyterianism grew through Chinese churches in Johore and expatriate congregations in Penang, Ipoh and Kuala Lumpur. Mission to Sengoi indigenous people began in 1932. Pentecostalism became a larger influence through the Charismatic Movement of the 1970s, but North American and Ceylon Pentecostal Mission missionaries (Pentecostal Church of Malaysia) had been active from 1935.

Anglicanism and Catholicism came to North Borneo in 1882 after the establishment of British North Borneo, albeit there were earlier attempts such as the Catholic mission led by a Spanish mariner turned priest, Carlos Cuarteroni in 1857 in Labuan, with stations established in Brunei and Looc Porin (now Kota Kinabalu), however with lesser success. A more extensive missionary movement, for example the Catholic Mill Hill Missionaries started in 1882, focused mainly on the Chinese and indigenous communities, such as the Kadazan-Dusun people. Migration was also an important factor in the spread of Christianity. The Basel Mission also worked in Sabah in 1882 among migrant Hakka Chinese, many of whom were Christian. Tamil migrants to Malaya included Catholics, Lutherans, Anglicans, and Methodists. Migration increased after the Boxer Rebellion, particularly to Sitiawan and Sibu, still strong Chinese Methodist centres. Mar Thoma and Syriac Orthodox Churches were established in the 1930s following migration from the Kerala Coast of India.

In Sarawak the rule of Rajah Brooke included support for an Anglican ministry from 1847 and Catholics were later admitted. In 1928 the Australian Borneo Evangelical Mission began work with modest resources which nevertheless resulted in the largest indigenous church in Malaysia today, the Sidang Injil Borneo (&quot;Borneo Evangelical Church&quot;).

World War II saw the removal of expatriate leadership and a path towards an indigenous church was more clearly set. The Malayan Christian Council (MCC), founded in 1948, coordinated mission groups during the Malayan Emergency. Chinese relocated into &#x27;New Villages&#x27; were served by missionaries, sometimes ex-China, who worked alongside local Christians in social and medical work. However, after independence in 1957, many churches were overdependent on expatriates. In the 1970s churches developed structures independent of Singapore as well as of overseas support. Recent growth in independent churches is another sign of a desire to establish a Malaysian Christian identity.

Christian commitment to education has been strong through Anglican, Catholic and Methodist schools, now part of the government education system. Social concern is expressed through medical work, and organisations such as Malaysian CARE. The Salvation Army and YMCA/YWCAs make distinctive contributions.

Since 1983 the National Evangelical Christian Fellowship (NECF) has provided a focus for evangelical and independent congregations. The Christian Federation of Malaysia incorporating the Christian Council of Malaysia (formerly MCC), Catholics, and the NECF was formed in 1986. The Sabah Council of Churches and Association of Churches of Sarawak fulfil similar functions in East Malaysia.

Malaysia is a multi-religious context where Western theological preoccupations are not always relevant. Lay leadership has developed strongly in most churches. Although there are many challenges through changing political and economic circumstances, like Malaysia itself, the churches are beginning to see that they have a contribution to make on a larger stage.

==Church buildings==
Churches are allowed in Malaysia, though there are restrictions on construction of new churches through discriminatory zoning laws. No pre-existing churches have been closed down by the government and no standing congregations have been disbanded. However, it is difficult to build new churches. For instance, it took more than twenty years for the local council in Shah Alam to allow a church to be built there, with an additional condition that the church must look like a factory and not a more conventional church appearance. However, new churches is allowed and easy to apply a new land in East Malaysia due to the 67.9% people living in East Malaysia is a Christians (&quot;based on diversity and harmony law in East Malaysia&quot;). Most of the time, new churches are started in a clandestine manner as ordinary businesses in shops, especially in major cities like Kuala Lumpur.

Some of Malaysia&#x27;s notable current churches include St. John&#x27;s Cathedral in Kuala Lumpur, St. Joseph&#x27;s Cathedral in Kuching, Sacred Heart Cathedral in Kota Kinabalu, St. Michael&#x27;s Church in Penampang and Christ Church in Malacca City.

==Evangelism==
The freedom to practice and propagate religion is guaranteed under the Article 11 of the Constitution of Malaysia and this is generally respected. The Constitution however allows for the restriction of the propagation of religions other than Islam to the Muslim community and the ambiguity of these provisions has resulted in some problems.

It has been the practice of the church in Malaysia to not actively proselytise to the Muslim community. Christian literature are required by law to carry a caption &quot;for non-Muslims only&quot;. Article 11(4) of the Federal Constitution of Malaysia allows the states to prohibit the propagation of other religions to Muslims, and most (with the exception of Penang, Sabah, Sarawak and the Federal Territories) have done so. There is no well researched agreement on the actual number of Malaysian Muslim converts to Christianity in Malaysia. According to the latest population census released by the Malaysian Statistics Department, there are none, according to Ustaz Ridhuan Tee, there are 135 and according to Tan Sri Dr Harussani Zakaria, there are 260,000. See also Status of religious freedom in Malaysia.

There are, however, cases in which a Muslim will adopt the Christian faith without declaring his/her apostasy (in the eyes of Islamic authorities) openly. In effect, they are practising Christians, but legally Muslims.

Muslims showing interest in the Christian faith or other faith practices not considered orthodox by state religious authorities are usually sent either by the police or their family members to state funded &quot;Faith Rehabilitation Centres&quot; () where they are counselled to remain faithful to Islam and some states have provisions for penalties under their respective Shariah legislations for apostasy from Islam.

==Bible translation and literature==

Portions of the Bible had been translated into the Malay language as early as 1612 and was published in the Netherlands in 1629. The Malay language was one of the first Eastern Asian languages to have the Bible translated. Due to the linguistic and cultural similarities of both Malaysia and Indonesia, a lot of early language and literature work was shared by the two territories and the legacy remains today.

As a Muslim majority country, opinions on whether the Indonesian-language Bible and Malay-language Bible, both known by the name &quot;Alkitab&quot;, should be banned, are polarised. The word rendered &#x27;Lord&#x27; in English translations is given in Malay as &#x27;Tuhan&#x27; while the word &#x27;God&#x27; in English is translated as &#x27;Allah&#x27;. It was claimed that there is no closer translation from the original Hebrew since both Arabic and the Hebrew word for God come from the same Semitic root, and Arabic-speaking Christians and Maltese-speaking Christians also use the word &#x27;Allah&#x27; for God.

Other Christian materials in the Malay language have been banned at various times for similar reason. However, the Prime Minister clarified in April 2005 that there was no ban on Bibles translated into Malay, although they are required to be stamped with a disclaimer &quot;Not for Muslims&quot;.

A lawsuit was filed by the Archdiocese of Kuala Lumpur against the Government of Malaysia at the High Court of Malaya to seek a declaratory relief that the archdiocesan newspaper, The Herald, was entitled to use the word Allah and that the word should not exclusive to Islam.

The Iban Bible named &quot;Bup Kudus&quot; was also banned for using the term &quot;Allah Taala&quot; for God. Eventually, it was explained to the government that there was no other comparable term in Iban. As such, the ban was not enforced further, although neither was it officially repealed. The ban was later lifted only for usage by the Iban people, after protests from various Christian leaders.

==Education==
Christian Missionary schools are part of education system in Malaysia today and administered by Ministry of Education with little interference by the churches where they belong to. Missionary schools are partially government-funded while teachers and administration staff are provided by the government. Most of the missionary schools were constructed before Malaysia was formed. Christian religious symbols such as crucifixes are visible to many Christian missionary schools. However, display of crucifixes to non-missionary schools are normally disallowed.

There are no official school subjects for Christian students. However, Christian and other non-Muslim students are allowed to take Bible Knowledge subject, the only Christian-related subject in SPM (Sijil Pelajaran Malaysia or Malaysia Certificate of Education) for secondary school. There are various non-official Christian school subjects, but it mostly caters for Christians and non-Muslims.

==Music==
There are many Christian songwriters in Malaysia, but the market is still fresh and not widespread. A network called the Malaysian Christian Songwriters Network, has been set up to promote the Malaysian Christian music scene.

==Films==
Mel Gibson&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;The Passion of The Christ&quot; saw a restricted release in Malaysia. Officially, the movie was open only to Christians. Attendance was discouraged as tickets were not carried by the usual box offices. Christian groups such as the National Evangelical Christian Fellowship arranged block bookings of cinemas and distributed tickets to various churches. An initial run of two-months was extended, making it appear doubtful that only Christians viewed the film.

The Daughters of St. Paul is a Christian film advertiser that makes investments in Malaysia. Their work in advertising includes The Passion of the Christ and Maria Goretti, both films are only available on DVD in Malaysia, and are most popular in Sabah and Sarawak. The Daughters of St. Paul has locations in Malaysia in Petaling Jaya, Kuala Lumpur, Kota Kinabalu, and Kuching. They are allowed to advertise Christian news, films, and music since they also contribute to the states&#x27; economy. However in Peninsular Malaysia they have the limitations to do their work whilst in East Malaysia they have no limitations due to the Keningau Oath Stone and also the &quot;Diversity and Harmony&quot; that is protected by law in both Sabah and Sarawak.

==Activities==

Actual modes of worship such as the liturgy used and the sermons are not actively censored or controlled by the government. Occasional surveillance of worship by clandestine operatives does occur.

It has been reported that several public secondary schools and universities have unofficially banned on-campus Christian activities, such as Christian Fellowship (CF).

==Holidays==
===Christmas===
Christmas is a public holiday in Malaysia, though much of the public celebration is commercial in nature and has no overt religious overtones. Occasionally, Christians do buy newspaper adverts on Christmas or Easter, but this is largely only allowed in English-language newspapers and permission is not given every year. The adverts themselves are usually indirect statements.

In 2004 the government organised a national-level Christmas celebration but allegedly imposed an unofficial ban on all Christian religious symbols and hymns that specifically mention Jesus Christ. The event was jointly organised by the Arts, Culture and Heritage ministry, the government of the state of Selangor and the Christian Federation of Malaysia (CFM). It was reported in advance that the Prime Minister, the Sultan of Selangor and his consort, as well as assorted cabinet ministers would be in attendance, and that the event would be televised.

O.C. Lim, a former lawyer turned Jesuit priest and director of the Catholic Research Centre (also assistant parish priest of St Francis Xavier&#x27;s Church) lodged a formal complaint. He also stated that &quot;To exclude (such) carols and to use (Christmas) for political gain is outrageous, scandalous and sacrilegious.&quot; He also said &quot;To call it a cultural event (as rationalised by Christian politicians who are more politician than Christian) is to downgrade Jesus to a cultural sage such as Confucius.&quot;

CFM general secretary Rev. Dr. Hermen Shastri stated that the government wanted &quot;nothing that insults Islam&quot; during the open house.

Arts, Culture and Heritage Minister Dr Rais Yatim later denied that any such ban had been &quot;issued officially or unofficially&quot;. He also added that there is &quot;nothing wrong in singing songs such as &#x27;Silent Night&#x27; and &#x27;Merry Christmas&#x27;&quot; as they are &quot;joyous songs for the festival.&quot;

Lee Min Choon, legal adviser to the CFM and the National Evangelical Christian Fellowship issued a statement which said &quot;It means that churches can celebrate Christmas as they have been doing all along. Otherwise, the very meaning of the occasion will be lost.&quot; &quot;Now, everybody should take the government at its word and celebrate Christmas the way they normally celebrate and express their religious faith.&quot;

===Good Friday===
Good Friday is not a federal public holiday, but is a state public holiday in Sabah, and also in Sarawak, where Christianity is the largest religion; both states were granted some level of greater autonomy than other states in the Federation, as they were considered polities on par with Malaya when they merged with it and Singapore to form Malaysia. But it is a school holiday for some schools (or specifically, non-Muslim-majority schools).

However, there is no evidence that this theological objection plays any role in the non-inclusion of Good Friday as a holiday. On the contrary, Good Friday is probably not a public holiday because, as a whole in the federation, Christians constitutes 9.2% of the population according to the 2010 Census. The other two significant religious minorities in Malaysia, Buddhists and Hindus, also receive just one federal public holiday each - Wesak Day and Deepavali respectively. Deepavali however, is not federal holiday in the state of Sarawak.

===Independence Day/Malaysia Day fasting===
Malaysian Christians sometimes hold fasts ending on Independence Day or Malaysia Day and pray for Muslims. A number of explanations have been given for doing so including a desire to show patriotism, promoting religious harmony, and celebrating freedom of religion. Since 2000 the National Evangelical Christian Fellowship, with 2,800 member churches, has organised these fasts and they are ongoing event as of 2010. All previous fasts have ended on Independence Day but the 2010 fast was followed by Malaysia Day and thus for the first time coincided with Ramadan.

==Distribution of Christians==

According to the 2020 census, there were 2,941,049 people self-identifying as Christians (representing 9.1% of total Malaysian population). 

===By gender===
The 2020 Population and Housing Census Report gives the following statistics:
===By ethnic group===

===By state or federal territory===
Malaysian Population and Housing Census Report from 1970 to the recent 2020 census gives the following statistics, showing the number of Christians in each states and their percentage out of the total population of each states.

===By urban-rural strata===
The 2000 Population and Housing Census Report indicates that approximately 11.5% of the rural population and 7.6% of the urban population are adherents to Christianity making Christians the 2nd largest and 4th largest faith community in their respective population strata.

==Freedom of religion==
The freedom of religion for Christianity and other religions in Malaysia was written in the Keningau Oath Stone (&quot;protected by Malaysia Borneo government&quot;), however it is only mentioned and confirmed by the two states of Malaysia located in Borneo (East Malaysia).

In 2023, the country was ranked as the 43rd worst country in the world to be a Christian, but it was recorded only in West Malaysia (&quot;due to political intervene on religion&quot;) meanwhile in East Malaysia still not the worst to be a Christian (&quot;not included in rank&quot;) because of diversity and harmony tradition protected by both the Sabah and Sarawak governments that also written in Keningau Oath Stone.

<doc id="1085526" wikidata="Q1573076" url="?curid=1085526" title="Otago gold rush">
<text>The Otago gold rush (often called the Central Otago gold rush) was a gold rush that occurred during the 1860s in Central Otago, New Zealand. This was the country&#x27;s biggest gold strike, and led to a rapid influx of foreign miners to the area – many of them veterans of other hunts for the precious metal in California and Victoria, Australia. The number of miners reached its maximum of 18,000 in February 1864.

The rush started at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully but spread throughout much of Central Otago, leading to the rapid expansion and commercialisation of the new colonial settlement of Dunedin, which quickly grew to be New Zealand&#x27;s largest city. Only a few years later, most of the smaller new settlements were deserted, and gold extraction became more long-term, industrialised-mechanical process.

==Background==
===Previous gold finds in New Zealand===

Previously gold had been found in small quantities in the Coromandel Peninsula (by visiting whalers) and near Nelson in 1842. Commercial interests in Auckland offered a £500 prize for anyone who could find payable quantities of gold anywhere nearby in the 1850s, at a time when some New Zealand settlers were leaving for the California and Australian gold rushes. In September 1852, Charles Ring, a timber merchant, claimed the prize for a find in Coromandel. A brief gold rush ensued around Coromandel township, Cape Colville and Mercury Bay but only £1500 of gold was accessible in river silt, although more was in quartz veins where it was inaccessible to individual prospectors. The rush lasted only about three months.

A find in the Aorere Valley near Collingwood in 1856 proved more successful, with 1500 miners converging on the district and removing about £150,000 of gold over the next decade, after which the gold was exhausted. The presence of gold in Otago and on the West Coast during this time was known, but the geology of the land was different from that of other major gold-bearing areas, and it was assumed the gold would amount to little.

===Previous gold finds in Otago===
Māori had long known of the existence of gold in Central Otago, but had no use for the ore. For a precious material they relied on greenstone for weaponry and tools, and used greenstone, obsidian and bone carving for jewellery.

The first known European Otago gold find was at Goodwood, near Palmerston in October 1851. The find was of a very small amount with no ensuing &quot;rush&quot;. Instead, the settlement of Dunedin was just three years old, and more practical matters were of higher importance to the young town.

Other finds around the Mataura River in 1856 and the Dunstan Range in 1858 stirred minimal interest. A find near the Lindis Pass in early 1861 started producing flickers of interest from around the South Island, with reports of large numbers of miners travelling inland from Oamaru to stake their claims. It was two months later that the gold strike was made that would prompt a major influx of prospectors.

==Main rush==
===Gabriel&#x27;s Gully===

Gabriel Read, an Australian prospector who had hunted gold in both California and Victoria, Australia, found gold in a creek bed at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully, close to the banks of the Tuapeka River near Lawrence on 20 May 1861. &quot;At a place where a kind of road crossed on a shallow bar I shovelled away about two and a half feet of gravel, arrived at a beautiful soft slate and saw the gold shining like the stars in Orion on a dark frosty night&quot;.

The public heard about Read&#x27;s find via a letter published in the &quot;Otago Witness&quot; on 8 June 1861, documenting a ten-day-long prospecting tour he had made. There was little reaction at first until John Hardy of the Otago Provincial Council stated that he and Read had prospected country &quot;about 31 miles long by five broad, and in every hole they had sunk they had found the precious metal.&quot; With this statement, the gold rush began.

===Arrival of prospectors===

By Christmas, 14,000 prospectors were on the Tuapeka and Waipori fields. Within a year, the region&#x27;s population swelled greatly, growing by 400 per cent between 1861 and 1864, with prospectors swarming from the dwindling Australian goldfields. Gabriel&#x27;s Gully led to the discovery of further goldfields within Central Otago. A second gold strike in 1862, close to the modern town of Cromwell, did nothing to dissuade new hopefuls, and prospectors and miners staked claims from the Shotover River in the west through to Naseby in the north.
In November 1862 Thomas Arthur and Harry Redfern sneaked off from shearing for William Rees at Queenstown and looked for gold on the banks of the Shotover River armed with a butcher&#x27;s knife and pannikin. The Arthur&#x27;s Point strike led to the largest rush that occurred in Otago. Historic buildings at Queenstown such as Eichardt&#x27;s Hotel, the Lake Lodge of Ophir (now Artbay Gallery), the Queenstown Police Station, and stone Courthouse were all begun as a response to the rapid influx.
By the end of 1863, the real gold rush was over, but companies continued to mine the alluvial gold. The number of miners reached its maximum of 18,000 in February 1864.

== Life in mining communities ==
Read&#x27;s find of gold sparked the interest of people in Dunedin; people travelled long distances in the hope of striking it rich. These goldfields all gave rise to mining towns and communities of temporary shops, hotels and miners&#x27; huts made from canvas or calico fabric-covered timber frames. As the scope of the goldfields developed, communities became more permanent with buildings constructed in timber and concrete. Evidence such as material artefacts, foundations of huts and buildings, and photographs from the Central Otago goldfields provide us with information about the labour and social roles of men and women in the 19th century. A restored Chinese Village at Arrowtown is a popular tourist attraction.

===Men in mining communities===

The news of gold at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully reached the inhabitants of Dunedin and the rest of the world, prospectors immediately left their homes in search of gold. The majority of these perspective prospectors were labourers and tradesmen, in their late teens and twenties.
The incoming population included entrepreneurial, skilled and technical people that established services for the miners, such as shops, post offices, banks, pubs, hotels and hardware stores. The owners of these businesses could make more money than the miners.

====Evidence====
Historical evidence of male miners or businessmen in the 19th-century Central Otago goldfields is readily available in literature by and about the experiences of inhabitants at the various gold strikes. Census statistics and photographs are also available, all of which provide inferential evidence about the labour roles in these communities. This in turn provides information about labour and social roles within the community. Such information includes that of the ownership and management of stores and hotels, such as the bank and gold office at Maori Point (&quot;Bank of New Zealand&quot;) in the 1860s, managed by &quot;G. M. Ross&quot;.

Archaeological evidence is also readily available. Excavations at various sites throughout Otago show evidence of an array of mining techniques, including ground sluicing, hydraulic sluicing and hydraulic elevating. Tailings (the materials left over after the removal of the uneconomic fraction (gangue) of the ore) also provide some of the archaeological evidence from Otago gold mine sites. Midden analysis from camp and settlement sites provides information about diet, with evidence of a preference for beef and lamb in the European camps, and a preference for pork within the Chinese camps.

Artefactual evidence found during excavations includes blue and white ceramics, cooking and eating utensils, metal objects, such as buttons, nails and tin boxes (flint boxes, tobacco boxes) and an exceedingly high number of alcohol glass bottles. It is possible these glass bottles were recycled, so archaeologists cannot draw definite conclusions as to alcohol consumption. Within the Chinese camps (such as the Lawrence Chinese camp) artefacts include gambling tokens and Chinese coins as well as celadon earthwares.

Although diaries and memoirs about the lives of males in the mining communities exist, little mention or information is known about the significance of female labour and social roles. Archaeological evidence, however, suggests that many females in the goldfields took significant roles in mining and the general community.

===Women in mining communities===
In the 19th-century goldfields, women played significant familial, labour and entrepreneurial roles, such as wives, mothers, prostitutes, business owners and service providers and &#x27;Colonial Helpmeets&#x27; (wives who worked alongside their husbands). Women within these communities were young and single, or married with a family, although the community was predominantly male, female family never having intended to move to the goldfields until towns developed with hotels, stores and schools. Yet, there was a female presence in this environment from the start of the gold find in 1861, at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully. An example is Janet Robertson, who lived with her husband in a small cottage in Tuapeka. It was here in her cottage, where Gabriel Read wrote his &quot;discovery&quot; letter of gold to the Otago Provincial Council. As the news of this goldfield in Gabriel&#x27;s Gully spread, prospectors engaged in the area, and Janet opened up her home, cooked meals and tended to the miners, as they passed through.

Another significant woman present on the 19th-century Central Otago goldfields was Susan Nugent-Wood, a well-known writer in the 1860s and 1870s. Nugent-Wood, her husband John, and their children moved to Otago in 1861, as prospectors of gold. Nugent-Wood worked on the goldfields of Central Otago in several official positions. She wrote stories based on her life and roles on the Central Otago goldfields, which provide accounts of labour and social aspects of mining and gender in the 19th century.

Harriet Heron also lived on the goldfields, most notably at Fourteen-Mile Beach where she and her husband Henry lived in a tent for three years – Heron was the only woman in the mining camp at the time. They later built a cottage in the area, which is known today as &quot;Mrs Heron&#x27;s Cottage&quot; and maintained by Heritage New Zealand.

As the majority of women within these mining communities were married, many became widows, as their husbands died during mining related activities or diseases. These women, whose husbands owned stores or hotels, adopted ownership rights. Many became well known throughout the communities, amongst visitors, passing miners and local citizens. Archaeological evidence of a widow who took over ownership rights following her husbands&#x27; death, was Elizabeth Potts. Potts was given a licence for the Victoria Hotel in Lawrence in 1869. This was recorded and published in the &quot;Tuapeka Times&quot;, 11 December 1869. This archaeological evidence provides information which suggests that women played significant labour and social roles within mining communities.

====Excavation evidence====
An excavation report from the Golden Bar Mine between the Macraes Flat and Palmeston, Otago, shows that located in front of the main mine workings of ca.1897, archaeological material was found. This material was a small heart-shaped brooch with 13 glass (paste) diamonds. This archaeological evidence suggests that women were present at this site, and within the Golden Bar goldfield. The exact occupation of women from this evidence is unknown, but indicates that women were present on the goldfields during the 19th-century gold rush in Otago.

Another excavation report by Petchey from the Macraes Flat mining area, presents items of children&#x27;s toys such as marbles, and a china doll&#x27;s leg amongst ruins of a house site. This evidence is also useful to suggest men and their families engaged in mining activities and social life on the goldfields in the 19th century. Archaeological artefacts from 19th-century mining communities in Central Otago suggest that women and children were on site of the goldfields. It is unknown whether these artefacts belonged to women who were miners or women who were domestic wives and mothers.

==Aftermath==

===Results===
The city of Dunedin reaped many of the benefits, for a period becoming New Zealand&#x27;s largest town even though it had only been founded in 1848. Many of the city&#x27;s stately buildings date from this period of prosperity. New Zealand&#x27;s first university, the University of Otago, was founded in 1869 with wealth derived from the goldfields.

However, the rapid decline in gold production from the mid-1860s led to a sharp drop in the province&#x27;s population, and while not unprosperous, the deep south of New Zealand never rose to such relative prominence again.

===Later gold rushes===
The Wakamarina River in Marlborough proved to have gold in 1862, and 6,000 miners flocked to the district. Although they found alluvial gold, there were no large deposits.

The West Coast of the South Island was the second-richest gold-bearing area of New Zealand after Otago, and gold was discovered in 1865–6 at Okarito, Bruce Bay, around Charleston and along the Grey River. Miners were attracted from Victoria, Australia where the gold rush was near an end. In 1867 this boom also began to decline, though gold mining continued on the coast for a considerable time after this. In the 1880s, quartz miners at Bullendale and Reefton were the first users of grid electricity in New Zealand.

Southland also had a number of smaller scale gold rushes during the later half of the 19th century. The first goldmining in Southland took place in 1860 on the banks of the Mataura River and its tributaries (and later would help settlements such as Waikaia and Nokomai flourish). However the first &quot;gold rush&quot; wasn&#x27;t until the mid-1860s when fine gold was discovered in the black sands of Orepuki beach. Miners followed the creeks up into the foothills of the Longwoods to where the richest gold was to be had. This activity led to the founding of mining settlements such as Orepuki and Round Hill (the Chinese miners and shop owners essentially ran their own town known colloquially to Europeans as &quot;Canton&quot;).

Gold was long known to exist at Thames, but exploitation was not possible during the New Zealand Wars. In 1867 miners arrived from the West Coast, but the gold was in quartz veins, and few miners had the capital needed to extract it. Some stayed on as workers for the companies which could fund the processing.

===Commercial extraction===
After the main gold rush, miners began laboriously reworking the goldfields. About 5,000 European miners remained in 1871, joined by thousands of Chinese miners invited by the province to help rework the area. There was friction not only between European and Chinese miners, which contributed to the introduction of the New Zealand head tax, but also between miners and settlers over conflicting land use.

Attention turned to the gravel beds of the Clutha River, with a number of attempts to develop a steam-powered mechanical gold dredge. These finally met with success in 1881 when the &quot;Dunedin&quot; became the world&#x27;s first commercially successful gold dredge. The &quot;Dunedin&quot; continued operation until 1901, recovering a total of 17,000 ounces (530 kg) of gold.

The mining has had a considerable environmental impact. In 1920 the Rivers Commission estimated that 300 million cubic yards of material had been moved by mining activity in the Clutha river catchment. At that time an estimated 40 million cubic yards had been washed out to sea with a further 60 million in the river. (The remainder was still on riverbanks). This had resulted in measured aggradation of the river bottom of as much as 5 metres.

Gold is still mined by OceanaGold in commercial quantities in Otago at one site – Macraes Mine inland from Palmerston, which started operations in 1990. Macraes Mine, an opencast hard rock mining operation, processes more than 5 million tonnes of ore per year and from 1990 through 2014, gold production has totaled about 4 million ounces.

===The Otago gold rush in popular culture===
Numerous folk songs, both contemporary and more recent, have been written about the gold rush. Of contemporary songs, &quot;Bright Fine Gold&quot;, with its chorus of &quot;Wangapeka, Tuapeka, bright fine gold&quot; (sometimes rendered &quot;One-a-pecker, two-a-pecker&quot;) is perhaps the best known. Most well-known of more recent songs are Phil Garland&#x27;s songs &quot;Tuapeka Gold&quot;. and &quot; Daniel&#x27;s Gold &quot;.

Martin Curtis wrote a folk-style song about the gold rush called &quot;Gin and Raspberry.&quot; The lyrics are written in the voice of an unsuccessful gold prospector who envies the success of the largest gold mine in the Cardrona valley at the time, the &quot;Gin and Raspberry&quot; (supposedly so named because the owner would call out, &quot;Gin and raspberry to all hands!&quot; whenever a bucket of mined material yielded an ounce of gold. The singer laments, &quot;an ounce to the bucket and we&#x27;d all sell our souls/For a taste of the gin and raspberry.&quot; The song has had several recordings, particularly by Gordon Bok.

Paul Metsers&#x27; song &quot;Farewell to the Gold&quot; is based loosely on a flood in July 1863, which killed 13 miners on the Shotover River. The song has been recorded by many, including Nic Jones, The Black Family, James Keelaghan, and Nancy Kerr and James Fagan.

1976 New Zealand children&#x27;s television drama series &quot;Hunter&#x27;s Gold&quot; was set during the Central Otago gold rush.

The Otago Goldfields Cavalcade has annually since 1991 retraced the routes of wagons across country to the Dunstan goldfields around Cromwell. The original route, which established Cobb &amp; Co.&#x27;s coach service left Dunedin&#x27;s Provincial Hotel on 22 November 1862. Cavalcade routes vary each year in late February so as to finish in a different host town. In 2008 plans were made for a heritage trail including Arrowtown, Kawarau Gorge, Lawrence and the Dunedin Chinese Garden.

==Archives==

The Ng New Zealand Chinese Heritage Collection is a document archive held at the Presbyterian Research Centre at Knox College, Dunedin, which became a UNESCO New Zealand Memory of the World Register in 2017. Much of the archive is sourced from records made by reverend Alexander Don, in his mostly unsuccessful attempts to convert Chinese goldmining communities to Christianity. Don&#x27;s archives includes detailed documentation of 3,500 individuals associated with Chinese goldrush communities in Otago. Other documents included in the archive were collected by James Ng, a historian and general practitioner, began collecting further documents in 1959, using many of these as the basis for his book series &quot;Windows on a Chinese Past&quot;.

<doc id="1085537" wikidata="Q3512714" url="?curid=1085537" title="Tabarin">
<text>Tabarin was the street name of Anthoine Girard (c. 1584 – August 16, 1633), the most famous Parisian street charlatan of his day, who amused his audiences in the Place Dauphine by farcical dialogue with his brother Philippe (as Mondor), with whom he reaped a golden harvest by the sale of quack medicines for several years after 1618. Street theatre was popular theatre, on an improvised stage with a curtain backdrop, to the music of a hurdy-gurdy and a set of viols. More formal contemporary performances were confined to the royal court or to the Hotel de Bourgogne, overseen by the medieval guild that had the monopoly of theatrical performances in Paris.

A contemporary woodcut shows Tabarin in the dress of a clown, but with a gallant moustache and pointed beard, carrying a wooden sword, like his distant puppet descendant Mr. Punch, — which would trip him up— and wearing a soft grey felt hat capable of assuming countless amusing shapes in his deft fingers. &quot;Tabarin&quot; from French &quot;tabard&quot; denotes a short cloak of the kind the &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; figure Scaramouche wears.

In more elaborate weekly performances others appeared, notably his wife. In these he based his bawdy jokes on the stock situations of &quot;commedia dell&#x27;arte&quot; troupes, which were amusing the French court at the time, brought up to date for Parisians by running banter of topical allusions and knowing local jokes, based on his original gifts for improvisation. The Girard brothers retired about 1628, purchased a &quot;seigneurie&quot; and lived out their retirement as country gentlemen near Orléans.

Numerous farces and dialogues were credited to him, and long series of cheap leaflets purporting to be his complete works began to appear as early as 1622. Stock characters besides Tabarin, with his famous felt hat Le Chapeau de Tabarin that could be rolled into a variety of shapes to aid his characterizations (see &quot;Chapeaugraphy&quot;), were two old men Lucas and Piphagne whose echoes still resound in the &quot;Barber of Seville&quot;, and the witty and self-reliant ladies Francisquine and Isabella. A Falstaffian old soldier (based on the &quot;miles gloriosus&quot; of Roman comedy) named Capitaine Rodomonte, gave his name to the &quot;rodomontade&quot; of French theater, an extravagantly inflated and drawn-out tirade of deluded self-confidence, vain threats and invective. Both Molière and La Fontaine, who praised him, were influenced by the Tabarin tradition of coarse quick repartee, and he was also well spoken of, long after he was gone, by Boileau and Voltaire.

&quot;Tabarin&quot; became the French eponym of any comic performer of a street booth. It was taken up as a cabaret that was made immortal by a Paul Colin poster which epitomized the 1920s.

<text>Acer nigrum, the black maple, is a species of maple closely related to &quot;A. saccharum&quot; (sugar maple), and treated by some authors as a subspecies of it, as &quot;Acer saccharum&quot; subsp. &quot;nigrum&quot;.

Identification can be confusing due to the tendency of the two species to form hybrids. The simplest and most accurate method for distinguishing between the two trees is the generally three-lobed leaves of the black maple versus the generally five-lobed leaves of the sugar maple. The leaves of the black maple also tend to have a appearance. Other differences that are not as pronounced include darker, more deeply grooved bark, slightly smaller seeds, a downy underside, and thicker petioles. Hybrids are intermediate in their characteristics.

==Distribution==
The geographic range of &quot;A. nigrum&quot; is slightly more limited than the sugar maple, encompassing much of the Midwestern United States, portions of the Eastern United States, and the southeast of Canada in southern Ontario.

==Description==
The black maple&#x27;s mature height ranges from 21 to 34 meters (70 to 110 feet).

==Uses==
This species is used similarly to the &quot;A. saccharum&quot;, for timber as hard maple, for landscaping, and for maple syrup production.

<text>Gabriel Luke Reid (born 24 February 1969) is a New Zealand director, screenwriter and producer working in television, film and theatre. His doctoral thesis examines the impact of digital technologies on film production.

==Education==

Reid holds a PhD in Film, Television and Media Studies from the University of Auckland. His thesis, titled &quot;The Impact of Digital Technologies on Feature Film Production&quot;, presents a history of digital film production technologies as they have been developed and applied, primarily in the mainstream American cinema. It includes case studies of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;, interpreted as instances of film making that are at once consequential for the development of digital production techniques and as ambiguously positioned between the local (N.Z.) and the global. Other case studies centre on projects for which all images are computer generated (i.e. animated feature films) and projects for which live action images are captured digitally. Reid conducted research at renowned studios and visual effects companies including Animal Logic, Blue Sky Studios, Industrial Light &amp; Magic, Park Road Post, Pixar and Weta Digital. His interviewees included Andrew Adamson, Matt Aitken, Pete Docter, Bill George, Donald McAlpine, Tim Johnson, Barrie M. Osborne, Chris Wedge and Dean Wright.

Prior to securing his doctorate, Reid earned a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts (First Class Honours). His MA thesis, titled &quot;Mr. Shakespeare Goes to Hollywood&quot; and supervised by Professor MacDonald P. Jackson, examines film adaptations of works by Shakespeare. Conducting research at the Royal Shakespeare Company, Royal National Theatre and Renaissance Films, Reid interviewed notable directors, actors and producers, including John Barton, Hugh Cruttwell, Adrian Noble, Trevor Nunn, David Parfitt and Imogen Stubbs.

Dr Reid has lectured on Film History and New Zealand Cinema at Unitec Institute of Technology.

==Career==

As a grandson of Mercury Theatre founder Professor John Reid, Reid&#x27;s interest in the performing arts was nurtured from an early age. Before hitting his teens, he secured representation with New Zealand&#x27;s first professional talent agency, founded by former wrestler Robert Bruce. Reid acted on stage and television alongside such stalwarts as Deryck Guyler, George Henare and Billy T. James. At Auckland Grammar he was president of the Senior Film Society and a member of Bel Canto choir, led by David Hamilton. At sixteen he directed a season of &quot;Godspell&quot;. Five years later, his work as a theatre director was garnering excellent reviews. Of his production of &quot;Amadeus&quot;, The New Zealand Herald wrote: &quot;The multi-talented Mr Reid...directs with scrupulous care and refreshing confidence.&quot; Reviewing his production of &quot;The Crucible&quot;, The Strip magazine wrote: &quot;Gabriel Reid is a clever, tightly disciplined, diligent director, with a bold and clear eye for design. This totally satisfying production coaxed new subtleties from the script — which could become far too dramatic for its own good in the hands of a less questioning director — yet diluted none of its power. It was craft and precision that fused this production into an example which could inspire even more experienced directors.&quot;

As vice-chair of Theatre Workshop, Reid oversaw productions of &quot;Salome&quot;, &quot;The Revenger&#x27;s Tragedy&quot; and &quot;As You Like It&quot;, which featured Toa Fraser, Oliver Driver and Brown Nation star Rajeev Varma. Soon after, he was invited to join the staff of Auckland Metropolitan Opera (now known as New Zealand Opera) for the company&#x27;s inaugural production, &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; starring Dame Malvina Major at the newly opened Aotea Centre. Over a period of years he worked on numerous opera seasons. These productions featured such renowned artists as Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and Sir Donald McIntyre. Subsequently, Reid was an assistant director and production assistant on notable television and film projects, including &quot;&quot;, &quot;Bridge to Terabithia&quot;, &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; and &quot;Kiwi Christmas&quot;. As an actor he has appeared in television series and films, including &quot;Shortland Street&quot;, &quot;Street Legal&quot;, &quot;Jackson&#x27;s Wharf&quot;, &quot;Outrageous Fortune&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re Here To Help&quot; and &quot;American Playboy: The Hugh Hefner Story&quot;.

His 2004 short film, &quot;As Dreams Are Made On&quot; starring Raymond Hawthorne, was invited to screen at Rhode Island International Film Festival, Melbourne International Film Festival and the New Zealand International Film Festival. His 2015 short film, &quot;Every Moment&quot;, won four awards at Tropfest N.Z., including Best Film and Best Actress (Bree Peters). Reid and his writing partner, Maile Daugherty, were awarded Best Short Film Screenplay at the New Zealand Writers Guild Awards, the SWANZ. The short was nominated in three categories at the New Zealand Film Awards. In 2019 the New Zealand Film Commission made Reid a recipient of Catalyst He Kauahi; a substantial grant facilitating feature film development via the production of high-end, narrative shorts. The grant was applied to &quot;Impossible&quot;, a short film, written and directed by Reid, produced by Karpal Singh and Belindalee Hope, starring Paul Norell and Diamond Langi. Post-produced at Sir Peter Jackson&#x27;s Park Road Post, the short was mixed by two-time Academy Award winner Michael Hedges. At its 2023 ceremony, the New Zealand Cinematographers Society (NZCS) awarded Gold to director of photography Andrew McGeorge for his work on &quot;Impossible&quot;. 

In 1999 Reid founded Pageant Films. The company has produced several thousand promos and numerous industry-acclaimed campaigns for New Zealand&#x27;s largest television broadcasters; TVNZ, MediaWorks and their subsidiary networks (TV One, TV2, TVNZ6, TVNZ7, TVNZ Heartland, TV3 and C4). Reid&#x27;s work has earned nominations at PromaxBDA Australia, winning Gold in 2010, and has featured some of New Zealand&#x27;s most notable artists, including Temuera Morrison, Karl Urban, Robyn Malcolm, Angela Bloomfield and Oscar Kightley. Pageant is developing a slate of feature film projects including adaptations of classic works, the Wall Street drama &quot;Division&quot;, executive produced by David Parfitt and Matthew Metcalfe, and the romantic dramedy &quot;Misspelt&quot;, for which the producing team includes Mark Johnson.

Commencing in 2012, Dr Reid served ten years on the board of the Directors and Editors Guild of Aotearoa New Zealand (DEGANZ), including two terms as vice president. Commencing in 2017, he served five years on the board of Film Auckland Incorporated (FAI). On occasion, he has discussed in the media the state of the New Zealand screen industry.

<text>William Lansing Downing (born August 1, 1949) is a former judge of the Superior Court of Washington for King County (Seattle) and a former prosecutor. He retired following 28 years of distinguished service as a judge on the King County Superior Court bench. He is recognized for his landmark ruling legalizing same-sex marriage in Washington.

Before embarking on a career in law, Downing graduated from Vassar College, worked in a psychiatric hospital as a conscientious objector during the Vietnam War, and made a living working on fishing boats in Bellingham, Washington. While at Vassar, he met his wife, Laura; after graduating, the two moved to Seattle where they raised their son.

After earning a Doctor of Jurisprudence degree from the University of Washington School of Law in 1978, he served as a prosecutor in King County for 11 years. During his tenure, he successfully prosecuted the individuals responsible for the 1983 Wah Mee massacre.

<text>Nicola Salerno (11 March 1910 – 22 May 1969), often known as Nisa, was an Italian lyricist. He formed a famous songwriting duo with Renato Carosone.

==Life and career==
Nicola Salerno was born in Naples in 1910.

His first hit was &quot;Eulalia Torricelli&quot; of 1947, about the unhappy love story between a wealthy girl from Forlì and a guy named Giosuè. Salerno put the whole team of songwriters (including himself, Gino Redi and Dino Olivieri) in the lyrics as heirs to each of Eulalia&#x27;s three castles.

Salerno met Renato Carosone in 1955. It was Mariano Rapetti, Ricordi record company&#x27;s director – and father of lyricist Mogol – who suggested that they should work together to enter a radio contest. Nisa brought Carosone three texts to be set to music. One of them was titled &quot;. Carosone had an instant inspiration and started composing a boogie-woogie on the piano keyboard. It took just fifteen minutes to create Carosone&#x27;s most famous song, that became a worldwide success. Other famous hits by the duo include &quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Caravan Petrol&quot;, &quot; and &quot;.

Salerno worked also with other songwriters. Among his best-known lyrics are &quot;, winning song of the Naples Song Festival in 1956, and &quot;, with which Gigliola Cinquetti won both the Sanremo Music Festival and the Eurovision Song Contest in 1964.

Besides writing lyrics, Nicola Salerno was also an illustrator. He was the author, for example, of cover designs for some Neapolitan music scores published between the 1920s and 1930s.

He died in Naples in 1969. His son Alberto Salerno would also become a successful lyricist.

<text>Çetin İnanç (Born in Ankara on 12 September 1941) is a Turkish film director who has directed movies for the past five decades. He is infamously known as the director of &quot;Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam (1982), aka&quot; &quot;Turkish Star Wars&quot;

== Biography ==
Inanç spent his youth pursuing a career in Law, and later abandoned his career. He began his cinema career as the assistant of well-known Turkish director Atıf Yılmaz. In 1967 he made his first movie &quot;Çelik Bilek&quot; based on an Italian comics character. He quickly moved into the niche market of producing erotica, but was dissuaded from that path as military took over in Turkey and passed several censorship laws against adult movies. Among his erotic films, the most notorious is &quot;Bal Badem&quot; (1978), starring Zerrin Egeliler, one of the most famous Turkish actresses of the 1970s.

His next venture was action movies, including his most famous work &quot;Dünyayı Kurtaran Adam&quot; (English: &quot;The Man Who Saved The World&quot;), a low-budget space saga infamously dubbed the &quot;Turkish &quot;Star Wars&quot;&quot;.

Today, Çetin İnanç continues to direct, although his passion has since been funnelled into Turkish television programmes likes &quot;Çılgın Bediş&quot; and the more recent &quot;Karaoğlan&quot;.

He was nicknamed as &quot;jet director&quot; in Turkish cinema circles since he shot most of his films in around 10 days.

<text>Protein splicing is an intramolecular reaction of a particular protein in which an internal protein segment (called an intein) is removed from a precursor protein with a ligation of C-terminal and N-terminal external proteins (called exteins) on both sides. The splicing junction of the precursor protein is mainly a cysteine or a serine, which are amino acids containing a nucleophilic side chain. The protein splicing reactions which are known now do not require exogenous cofactors or energy sources such as adenosine triphosphate (ATP) or guanosine triphosphate (GTP). Normally, splicing is associated only with pre-mRNA splicing. This precursor protein contains three segments—an N-extein followed by the intein followed by a C-extein. After splicing has taken place, the resulting protein contains the N-extein linked to the C-extein; this splicing product is also termed an extein.

==History==
The first intein was discovered in 1988 through sequence comparison between the &quot;Neurospora crassa&quot; and carrot vacuolar ATPase (without intein) and the homologous gene in yeast (with intein) that was first described as a putative calcium ion transporter. In 1990 Hirata &quot;et al.&quot; demonstrated that the extra sequence in the yeast gene was transcribed into mRNA and removed itself from the host protein only after translation. Since then, inteins have been found in all three domains of life (eukaryotes, bacteria, and archaea) and in viruses.

Protein splicing was unanticipated and its mechanisms were discovered by two groups (Anraku and Stevens) in 1990. They both discovered a &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; VMA1 in a precursor of a vacuolar H+-ATPase enzyme. The amino acid sequence of the N- and C-termini corresponded to 70% DNA sequence of that of a vacuolar H+-ATPase from other organisms, while the amino acid sequence of the central position corresponded to 30% of the total DNA sequence of the yeast HO nuclease.

Many genes have unrelated intein-coding segments inserted at different positions. For these and other reasons, inteins (or more properly, the gene segments coding for inteins) are sometimes called &quot;selfish genetic elements&quot;, but it may be more accurate to call them parasitic. According to the gene centered view of evolution, most genes are &quot;selfish&quot; only insofar as to compete with other genes or alleles but usually they fulfill a function for the organisms, whereas &quot;parasitic genetic elements&quot;, at least initially, do not make a positive contribution to the fitness of the organism.

As of December 2019, the UniProtKB database contains 188 entries manually annotated as inteins, ranging from just tens of amino acid residues to thousands. The first intein was found encoded within the VMA gene of &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot;. They were later found in fungi (ascomycetes, basidiomycetes, zygomycetes and chytrids) and in diverse proteins as well. A protein distantly related to known inteins containing protein, but closely related to metazoan hedgehog proteins, has been described to have the intein sequence from Glomeromycota. Many of the newly described inteins contain homing endonucleases and some of these are apparently active. The abundance of intein in fungi indicates lateral transfer of intein-containing genes. While in eubacteria and archaea, there are 289 and 182 currently known inteins. Not surprisingly, most intein in eubacteria and archaea are found to be inserted into nucleic acid metabolic protein, like fungi.

Inteins vary greatly, but many of the same intein-containing proteins are found in a number of species. For example, pre-mRNA processing factor 8 (Prp8) protein, instrumental in the spliceosome, has seven different intein insertion sites across eukaryotic species. Intein-containing Prp8 is most commonly found in fungi, but is also seen in Amoebozoa, Chlorophyta, Capsaspora, and Choanoflagellida. Many mycobacteria contain inteins within DnaB (bacterial replicative helicase), RecA (bacterial DNA recombinase), and SufB (FeS cluster assembly protein). There is remarkable variety within the structure and number of DnaB inteins, both within the mycobacterium genus and beyond. Interestingly, intein-containing DnaB is also found in the chloroplasts of algae. Intein-containing proteins found in archaea include RadA (RecA homolog), RFC, PolB, RNR. Many of the same intein-containing proteins (or their homologs) are found in two or even all three domains of life. Inteins are also seen in the proteomes encoded by bacteriophages and eukaryotic viruses. Viruses may have been involved as vectors of intein distribution across the wide variety of intein containing organisms.

== Mechanism ==

The process for class 1 inteins begins with an N-O or N-S shift when the side chain of the first residue (a serine, threonine, or cysteine) of the intein portion of the precursor protein nucleophilically attacks the peptide bond of the residue immediately upstream (that is, the final residue of the N-extein) to form a linear ester (or thioester) intermediate. A transesterification occurs when the side chain of the first residue of the C-extein attacks the newly formed (thio)ester to free the N-terminal end of the intein. This forms a branched intermediate in which the N-extein and C-extein are attached, albeit not through a peptide bond. The last residue of the intein is always an asparagine (Asn), and the amide nitrogen atom of this side chain cleaves apart the peptide bond between the intein and the C-extein, resulting in a free intein segment with a terminal cyclic imide. Finally, the free amino group of the C-extein now attacks the (thio)ester linking the N- and C-exteins together. An O-N or S-N shift produces a peptide bond and the functional, ligated protein.

Class 2 inteins have no nucleophilic first side chain, only an alanine. Instead, the reaction starts directly with a nucleophilic displacement, with the first residue of the C-extein atticking the peptide carboxyl on the final residue of the N-extein. The rest proceeds as usual, starting with Asn turning into a cyclic imide.

Class 3 inteins have no nucleophilic first side chain, only an alanine, yet they have an internal noncontiguous &quot;WCT&quot; motif. The internal C (cysteine) residue attacks the peptide carboxyl on the final residue of the N-extein (nucleophilic displacement). Transesterification occurs when the first residue of the C-extein attacks the newly formed thioester. The rest proceeds as usual.

The mechanism for the splicing effect is a naturally occurring analogy to the technique for chemically generating medium-sized proteins called native chemical ligation.

==Intein==
An intein is a segment of a protein that is able to excise itself and join the remaining portions (the exteins) with a peptide bond during protein splicing. Inteins have also been called protein introns, by analogy with (RNA) introns. 
===Naming conventions===
The first part of an intein name is based on the scientific name of the organism in which it is found, and the second part is based on the name of the corresponding gene or extein. For example, the intein found in &quot;Thermoplasma acidophilum&quot; and associated with Vacuolar ATPase subunit A (VMA) is called &quot;Tac VMA&quot;.

Normally, as in this example, just three letters suffice to specify the organism, but there are variations. For example, additional letters may be added to indicate a strain. If more than one intein is encoded in the corresponding gene, the inteins are given a numerical suffix starting from 5 to 3 or in order of their identification (for example, &quot;Msm dnaB-1&quot;).

The segment of the gene that encodes the intein is usually given the same name as the intein, but to avoid confusion the name of the intein proper is usually capitalized (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Pfu RIR1-1), whereas the name of the corresponding gene segment is italicized (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Pfu &quot;rir1-1&quot;). A different disambiguating convention is to place a lowercase &quot;i&quot; after the source protein name, &quot;e.g.&quot; &quot;Msm DnaBi1&quot;.

===Types of inteins===
Inteins can be classified on many criteria.
* Based on how they splice themselves out, they can be classified into &quot;cis-splicing&quot; (which means that they splice themselves out) or &quot;trans-splicing&quot; (which means they need outside help). Most studied inteins are cis-splicing. Split inteins (see below) usually involves two halves helping each other out, so they are &quot;trans-splicing&quot;.
* Based on whether they contain the endonuclease domain. Ones that have an endonuclease domain is called a &quot;maxi-intein&quot;, otherwise a &quot;mini-intein&quot;.
* Based on their splicing mechanism, which can be partially inferred based on the sequence. Class 1 intein is the most-studied type and are marked by a cysteine or serine as the first residue. Class 2 intein, or &quot;alanine intein&quot; has alanine as the first residue and no WCT motif. Class 3 intein has alanine as the first residue and a noncontiguous &quot;WCT&quot; motif. It has also been proposed that inteins that start with a serine and contain a &quot;WCT&quot; motif should be also classed as class 3.

==== Full and mini inteins ====
Inteins can contain a homing endonuclease gene (HEG) domain in addition to the splicing domains. This domain is responsible for the spread of the intein by cleaving DNA at an intein-free allele on the homologous chromosome, triggering the DNA double-stranded break repair (DSBR) system, which then repairs the break, thus copying the intein-coding DNA into a previously intein-free site. The HEG domain is not necessary for intein splicing, and so it can be lost, forming a &quot;minimal&quot;, or &quot;mini&quot;, &quot;intein&quot;. Several studies have demonstrated the modular nature of inteins by adding or removing HEG domains and determining the activity of the new construct.

==== Split inteins ====
Sometimes, the intein of the precursor protein comes from two genes. In this case, the intein is said to be a &quot;split intein&quot;. For example, in cyanobacteria, DnaE, the catalytic subunit α of DNA polymerase III, is encoded by two separate genes, &quot;dnaE-n&quot; and &quot;dnaE-c&quot;. The &quot;dnaE-n&quot; product consists of an N-extein sequence followed by a 123-AA intein sequence, whereas the &quot;dnaE-c&quot; product consists of a 36-AA intein sequence followed by a C-extein sequence.

==Applications in biotechnology==
Inteins are very efficient at protein splicing, and they have accordingly found an important role in biotechnology. There are more than 200 inteins identified to date; sizes range from 100–800 AAs. Inteins have been engineered for particular applications such as protein semisynthesis and the selective labeling of protein segments, which is useful for NMR studies of large proteins.

Pharmaceutical inhibition of intein excision may be a useful tool for drug development; the protein that contains the intein will not carry out its normal function if the intein does not excise, since its structure will be disrupted.

It has been suggested that inteins could prove useful for achieving allotopic expression of certain highly hydrophobic proteins normally encoded by the mitochondrial genome, for example in gene therapy. The hydrophobicity of these proteins is an obstacle to their import into mitochondria. Therefore, the insertion of a non-hydrophobic intein may allow this import to proceed. Excision of the intein after import would then restore the protein to wild-type.

Affinity tags have been widely used to purify recombinant proteins, as they allow the accumulation of recombinant protein with little impurities. However, the affinity tag must be removed by proteases in the final purification step. The extra proteolysis step raises the problems of protease specificity in removing affinity tags from recombinant protein, and the removal of the digestion product. This problem can be avoided by fusing an affinity tag to self-cleavable inteins in a controlled environment. The first generation of expression vectors of this kind used modified &quot;Saccharomyces cerevisiae&quot; VMA (Sce VMA) intein. Chong et al. used a chitin binding domain (CBD) from &quot;Bacillus circulans&quot; as an affinity tag, and fused this tag with a modified Sce VMA intein. The modified intein undergoes a self-cleavage reaction at its N-terminal peptide linkage with 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT), β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME), or cystine at low temperatures over a broad pH range. After expressing the recombinant protein, the cell homogenate is passed through the column containing chitin. This allows the CBD of the chimeric protein to bind to the column. Furthermore, when the temperature is lowered and the molecules described above pass through the column, the chimeric protein undergoes self-splicing and only the target protein is eluted. This novel technique eliminates the need for a proteolysis step, and modified Sce VMA stays in column attached to chitin through CBD.

Recently inteins have been used to purify proteins based on self aggregating peptides. Elastin-like polypeptides (ELPs) are a useful tool in biotechnology. Fused with target protein, they tend to form aggregates inside the cells. This eliminates the chromatographic step needed in protein purification. The ELP tags have been used in the fusion protein of intein, so that the aggregates can be isolated without chromatography (by centrifugation) and then intein and tag can be cleaved in controlled manner to release the target protein into solution. This protein isolation can be done using continuous media flow, yielding high amounts of protein, making this process more economically efficient than conventional methods. Another group of researchers used smaller self aggregating tags to isolate target protein. Small amphipathic peptides 18A and ELK16 (figure 5) were used to form self cleaving aggregating protein.

== Applications in Antimicrobial Development ==
Over the last twenty years, there has been increasing interest in leveraging inteins for antimicrobial applications. Intein splicing is found exclusively in unicellular organisms, with a particularly high abundance in pathogenic microorganisms. Furthermore, inteins are commonly found within housekeeping proteins and/or proteins involved in the survival of the organism within a human host. Post-translational intein removal is necessary for the protein to properly fold and function. For example, Gaëlle Huet &quot;et al.&quot; demonstrated that in &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;, unspliced SufB prevents the formation of the SufBCD complex, a component of the SUF machinery. As such, the inhibition of intein splicing may serve as a powerful platform for the development of antimicrobials.

Current research on intein splicing inhibitors has focused on developing antimycobacterials (&quot;M. tb.&quot; has three intein-containing proteins), as well as agents active against pathogenic fungi &quot;Cryptococcus&quot; and &quot;Aspergillus.&quot; Cisplatin and similar platinum-containing compounds inhibit splicing of the &quot;M. tb.&quot; RecA intein through coordinating to catalytic residues. Divalent cations, such as copper (II) and zinc (II) ions, function similarly to reversibly inhibit splicing. However, neither of these methods are currently suitable for an effective and safe antibiotic. The fungal Prp8 intein is also inhibited by divalent cations and cisplatin through interfering with the catalytic Cys1 residue. In 2021, Li &quot;et al.&quot; showed that small molecule inhibitors of Prp8 intein splicing were selective and effective at slowing the growth of &quot;C. neoformans and &quot;C. gattii&quot;, providing exciting evidence for the antimicrobial potential of intein splicing inhibitors.

<text>Remedy Entertainment Oyj, trading internationally as Remedy Entertainment Plc, is a Finnish video game developer based in Espoo. Notable games the studio has developed include the first two entries in the &quot;Max Payne&quot; franchise, &quot;Alan Wake&quot;, &quot;Quantum Break&quot; and &quot;Control&quot;. Sam Lake, Remedy&#x27;s creative director, has represented the company on numerous occasions.

Founded in August 1995 by members of demoscene group Future Crew, Remedy Entertainment created their first game, &quot;Death Rally&quot;, in a team member&#x27;s basement. Apogee Software served as the game&#x27;s publisher, and continued to be involved in the production of their next title, &quot;Max Payne&quot;, which received critical acclaim upon release. The game was followed by a sequel, &quot;Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne&quot;, released by Rockstar Games. After spending seven years working on the &quot;Max Payne&quot; franchise, the developer decided to create a new intellectual property called &quot;Alan Wake&quot;. This title was once suspected to be vaporware because of the length of time it took to produce and release. It gained a cult following when it was released in 2010, by Microsoft Game Studios, though at the time its sales were not enough to justify the production of a sequel. Remedy decided to pursue a new project named &quot;Quantum Break&quot;, which further expanded the live-action component of &quot;Alan Wake&quot;. The team had transitioned to become a multi-project studio since 2016, and had three projects in development, including &quot;Control&quot; and the single-player portions of &quot;CrossfireX&quot;. Remedy&#x27;s latest title, &quot;Alan Wake 2&quot;, was released on 27 October 2023. They are currently developing &quot;Control 2&quot; and a remake of their original &quot;Max Payne&quot; titles.

Remedy Entertainment has specialised in making cinematic single-player action games featuring a strong central character. With their roots in the demo scene Remedy have a strong history in developing their own game engines for their titles, most notably Northlight for &quot;Quantum Break&quot;. The studio underwent rapid expansion during the 2010s. It became a public company in 2017, and moved into a larger office in Espoo in 2018. Remedy opened their second studio in Stockholm in 2022.

== History ==

=== Background and founding (1995–1998) ===
 The company was founded by members of different demoscene groups that worked on creating demos for personal computers (PCs) and Commodore International&#x27;s Amiga PCs. In 1994, inspired by Bloodhouse and Terramarque, Finland&#x27;s first commercial video game developers, members of the Future Crew demogroup realised that their group would not evolve into a commercial developer by itself, and they would have to set up a new company. They decided to found the company they called Remedy to produce video games and began recruiting other like-minded individuals with a demoscene background. Remedy&#x27;s founding members were Samuli Syvähuoko, Markus Mäki, Sami Nopanen, John Kavaleff and Sami Vanhatalo. The company was officially established on 18 August 1995. At the time the company was founded, most members were only in their early twenties. They produced their first video game in the basement of Syvähuoko&#x27;s parents&#x27; house in Espoo&#x27;s Westend district.

The team began developing a racing game, initially known as &quot;HiSpeed&quot;, based on the first idea the team pitched. Scott Miller, the founder of Apogee Software, provided creative input and suggested the racing game should introduce vehicular combat elements. Renamed &quot;Death Rally&quot;, Apogee Software released the game in 1996. Needing dialog for the game, Remedy&#x27;s Petri Järvilehto contacted a long-time friend Sam Lake, who was studying English literature at University of Helsinki at the time, to help; Lake subsequently remained at Remedy and would eventually become the studio&#x27;s creative director.

In 1997, Remedy also created a benchmarking tool, Final Reality, with the team later spinning off as a new sister company, Futuremark. In a letter dated 9 July 1998, LucasArts, through attorney John Sullivan, approached Remedy and threatened legal action, claiming the Remedy logo was copied from the top part of LucasArts&#x27; logo. By that time, Remedy had already been in the process of redesigning their logo, as their logo at the time did not properly reflect Remedy as a company. The old logo was taken off Remedy&#x27;s website in July, and was replaced by a question mark. The new logo, designed by Kiia Kallio, was unveiled on 29 April 1999.

=== &quot;Max Payne&quot; series (1999–2005) ===
Following the release of &quot;Death Rally&quot;, Remedy began pitching their next project to Miller. One was a space flight simulation game like &quot;&quot;, one was a racing game, while another was an isometric shooter named &quot;Dark Justice&quot;. Miller decided to fund the shooter&#x27;s development, on the condition the game had a strong central character like Duke Nukem, 3D graphics, and a better name. He felt &quot;Dark Justice&quot; was too &quot;dark&quot; and &quot;adult&quot;. The team proposed different possibilities, ranging from &quot;Dick Justice&quot; to &quot;Max Heat&quot;, a name the company trademarked for $20,000, before settling on the name &quot;Max Payne&quot;. The game&#x27;s lead designer was Petri Järvilehto. He wanted bullet time and slow motion, a hallmark of Hong Kong action films, to be the core mechanic for their game. They decided to position it as a resource for players to use. With an expertise in computing because of their demoscene background, the team crafted their own game engine for the game. Sam Lake was appointed as the game&#x27;s writer. He introduced elements commonly found in crime fiction and film noir into the game. The team wanted to use real-life photos for the game&#x27;s texture, though this was initially met with heavy resistance by the artists. In 1999, the designers travelled from Finland to New York to research the city and get ideas for environments. Accompanied by two former New York Police Department bodyguards, they took thousands of photographs for mapping. The company spent most of its time in 2000 further refining the game&#x27;s graphics. Having delayed its release twice, &quot;Max Payne&quot; received critical acclaim when it was released in July 2001. It was noted for its heavy focus on story and atmosphere as an action game, which was traditionally more gameplay oriented. The game was a commercial success, selling more than seven million copies.

Apogee outsourced the development of &quot;Max Payne&quot;″s console versions to Rockstar Games, whose parent company Take-Two Interactive spent $10 million to purchase the intellectual property rights to the franchise; Rockstar still holds the rights to &quot;Max Payne&quot; as of 2021. As part of the acquisition agreement, Remedy would return to develop a sequel for the game. Take-Two gave Remedy plenty of creative freedom. The development cycle for the sequel game was much shorter than the original. The team made use of most of the existing gameplay mechanics and expanded them. Lake returned to write the game&#x27;s script. He went to the Theatre Academy of Finland to study screenwriting to be able to write a more &quot;ambitious&quot; story. Lake&#x27;s script had more than 600 pages, five times that of the original. &quot;Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne&quot; received critical acclaim when it was released in October 2003, 27 months after &quot;Max Payne&quot;″s release. However, it sold poorly. Take-Two cited the game&#x27;s &quot;continued disappointing sales&quot; as one of the reasons for the company&#x27;s forecast of a drop in sales revenue for 2004. Remedy was no longer involved with the franchise after &quot;Max Payne 2&quot;, but Rockstar consulted them when &quot;Max Payne 3&quot; reached its final stage of production.

=== Partnership with Microsoft (2006–2016) ===
After working for seven years on the &quot;Max Payne&quot; series, the team wanted to develop something new. They began prototyping and experimenting with different gameplay mechanics with the intention of making a sandbox game. However, due to limited resources, the team found that developing an open world was not feasible and decided to refocus the game as a linear experience. The company was inspired by Stephen King&#x27;s novels, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, ghost towns in the American Northwest, and tornado patterns, and they invited a landscape architect to serve as the game&#x27;s consultant. The team organised a field trip to the Northwest and Crater Lake and took more than 40,000 photographs for use creating the game&#x27;s environment. The game was in pre-production for more than three years, while full development only lasted for approximately two years. During this period, the studio increased the number of employees from 30 to 45. Some media outlets suspected the game had become vapourware as it disappeared from the public spotlight for a considerable time after its announcement. Microsoft Game Studios acted as the game&#x27;s publisher after securing an exclusivity deal with Remedy. The title, &quot;Alan Wake&quot; was released for Microsoft&#x27;s Xbox 360 to generally positive reviews in May 2010. Remedy pushed for a PC version after the game&#x27;s launch, and Microsoft greenlit its production in mid-2011. The PC version, developed with Nitro Games, was released in February 2012. The game sold more than 3.2 million copies, but Remedy explained in 2013 that it was not financially successful enough for them to raise the funds needed to continue developing a sequel. Unlike &quot;Max Payne&quot;, &quot;Alan Wake&quot;″s narrative was written to accommodate the release of multiple sequels. The company began developing different prototypes for &quot;Alan Wake 2&quot;. Some of its elements were reintegrated into &quot;Alan Wake&#x27;s American Nightmare&quot;, a 2012 standalone Xbox Live Arcade game which had a much shorter development cycle. Collectively, both games sold more than 4.5 million copies as of March 2015.

The company showed the prototype it had developed for &quot;Alan Wake 2&quot; to different publishers. Microsoft was not interested in pursuing a sequel to &quot;Alan Wake&quot;, but they were keen on working with Remedy again on an original intellectual property. The company had experimented with transmedia storytelling in &quot;Alan Wake&quot;, and Microsoft hoped Remedy would further expand the live-action component in their next project, &quot;Quantum Break&quot;. Pre-production of the game began in 2011; approximately 100 people worked on it. The idea of quantum physics originated with &quot;Alan Wake&quot;″s TV show called &quot;Quantum Suicide&quot;. The team thought time travel was the best way to accommodate the storytelling structure. Described as a &quot;transmedia action-shooter video game and television hybrid&quot;, Lake directed the game, while Lifeboat Productions produced the TV component, with Ben Ketai as director. The company built a new game engine for the game known as Northlight. &quot;Quantum Break&quot; received generally positive reviews from critics when it was released in 2016. Microsoft declared it the best-selling original property released by the firm since the release of the Xbox One. As of 2021, the rights to &quot;Quantum Break&quot; remain with Microsoft.

During this period, Remedy began experimenting with mobile games. The studio began developing a remake of &quot;Death Rally&quot; for iOS and Android. The game took eight months to develop, and it was a collaborative effort between Remedy, Mountain Sheep and Cornfox &amp; Brothers. Remedy spent only $10,000 marketing the game, but it proved to be a commercial success for them. More than 11 million players downloaded the game and the development team recouped their budget in three days. Seeing the success of &quot;Death Rally&quot;, Lake claimed it was only the company&#x27;s &quot;first step&quot; into the mobile gaming space and they were looking at creating more titles for mobile platforms. In 2013, Remedy expanded its board of directors, adding Mike Capps, former president of Epic Games, and Christian Fredriksson, chief executive of security firm F-Secure to the board. In late 2013, the company announced their next mobile game, &quot;Agents of Storm&quot;, a tower defence game for iOS. They collaborated with German publisher Flaregames on the project, which was released in late 2014.

=== Diversifying portfolio (2016–present) ===
Remedy underwent several management changes from 2015 to 2016. Chief executive officer (CEO) Matias Myllyrinne left Remedy to join Wargaming, with former CEO of RedLynx, Tero Virtala, replacing him and the interim CEO Markus Mäki. Virtala&#x27;s appointment was made to help Remedy transition into a multi-project studio, so that each game would have a shorter development cycle. In 2017, Remedy launched an initial public offering to raise funds to develop projects concurrently, and became a public company listed on the NASDAQ First North Finland exchange. The company announced they were working on the single-player component of Smilegate&#x27;s free-to-play first-person shooter &quot;Crossfire 2&quot; (later renamed as &quot;CrossfireX&quot;). Its predecessor, &quot;Crossfire&quot;, was one of the highest-grossing video games of all time by 2016. Remedy is also working on a new version of the original &quot;Crossfire&quot;, called &quot;Crossfire HD&quot;. After the announcement, Remedy began teasing its next project, codenamed &quot;P7&quot;. 505 Games provided support in marketing and publishing in addition to a fund of €7.75 million to assist in the game&#x27;s development. The game, titled &quot;Control&quot;, was released for PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One on 27 August 2019, and was the first game developed by Remedy for a Sony platform since &quot;Max Payne 2&quot;. &quot;Control&quot; sold over two million units by March 2021 and won several gaming awards, and has since had ports to the Nintendo Switch (via cloud streaming).

An unnamed third project has also been in development in tandem with &quot;CrossfireX&quot; and &quot;Control&quot;. A small 15-person team dedicated to creating multiplayer and live titles known as &quot;Vanguard&quot;, was established in 2018.

A television show based on &quot;Alan Wake&quot; was announced in September 2018 with Lake attached as its executive producer. Remedy fully acquired the publishing rights to &quot;Alan Wake&quot; in July 2019 from Microsoft, including a one-time royalty payment from the series&#x27; performance.

In March 2020, Remedy and Epic Games announced that they had established a two-game publishing deal with plans for release in the next few years, both within the same franchise. One was a larger, AAA-style game that was already in pre-production. while the second was a smaller-scale project yet to be started. Under the terms of the deal, Remedy would retain full creative control of the development process and intellectual property, while Epic will fully back development costs; following release, once Epic has recouped its backing Epic and Remedy will split profits 50/50. The larger game is part of Remedy&#x27;s &quot;shared universe&quot; between &quot;Alan Wake&quot; and &quot;Control&quot;. Lake said they have had the idea of developing for ten years, even as far back with &quot;Max Payne&quot; references within &quot;Alan Wake&quot;, and &quot;Quantum Break&quot; teasing elements of &quot;Alan Wake&quot;. The smaller title was &quot;Alan Wake Remastered&quot;, released in October 2021; the larger title, &quot;Alan Wake 2&quot;, entered full production in Aug 2021 and was released in October 2023.

In May 2021, it was announced that Tencent acquired a minority stake of 3.8% in the company from sales of shares from Accendo Capital, which still otherwise held 14% ownership in Remedy. Remedy and Tencent announced in December 2021 that Remedy was working on a new online game to be published by Tencent under the code name &quot;Vanguard&quot;. While &quot;Vanguard&quot; was originally planned as a free-to-play title, Remedy announced in November 2023 that they shifted the game to be a premium-price title, and was now developing it under the codename &quot;Kestrel&quot;. However, by May 2024, Remedy and Tencent agreed to cancel further development of &quot;Kestrel&quot; in favor of Remedy focusing on its existing IP.

Remedy announced plans to open a new studio in Sweden in the first half of 2022, as based on their experience from working during the COVID-19 pandemic, they found a need for a hybrid work model for their Sweden-based staff.

In April 2022, Remedy announced that with funding from Rockstar Games, they were remaking &quot;Max Payne&quot; and &quot;Max Payne 2&quot; in the Northlight engine for PlayStation 5, Windows, and Xbox Series X/S.

In February 2024, Remedy purchased all rights for &quot;Control&quot; from 505 Games for €17 million in February 2024. In May, it was announced that CFO Terhi Kauppi would be leaving the company at the end of the following month.

In August, Remedy announced a &quot;strategic cooperation agreement&quot; with Annapurna Pictures which brings Annapurna in to co-produce &quot;Control 2&quot; as well as provide 50% of the development costs, and provides options for film and television projects involving &quot;Alan Wake&quot; and &quot;Control&quot;. The following month, Tencent agreed to give the company a €15 million convertible loan, pending approval, which could ultimately be converted into around 6% of the company, thus increasing Tencent&#x27;s stake to 20%.

Canceled games

===Northlight Engine===
In addition to its games, Remedy developed Northlight Storytelling Engine, a multi-platform game engine which was first used in &quot;Quantum Break&quot;. According to Lake, they had considered narrative elements to be key to their prior games of &quot;Max Payne&quot; and &quot;Alan Wake&quot;, but felt it was necessary to develop their own technology to better support this facet. Part of this decision came about when Remedy had been working on the cancelled &quot;Alan Wake 2&quot; prototype around 2013, at the time based on the same engine used in &quot;Alan Wake&quot; which had limited their abilities for storytelling. Building on the tech created for &quot;Alan Wake 2&quot;, Remedy fleshed out various features that support the studio&#x27;s narrative goals such as highly detailed and realistic human faces and bodies that can be animated through motion capture and a physically based renderer that supports global illumination, ray tracing and particle lighting. A real-time deterministic physics system that can calculate environmental physics effects, play them back in real-time or rewind to create large scale interactive destruction was also used.

== Facilities ==
The team used a basement in the Westend district of Espoo, Finland, as a workspace for the production of their first games. According to Lake, there were mattresses strewn across the basement floor because team members sometimes slept there. Before 2018, Remedy was using a four-story office in Espoo which offered various facilities including a café, a sauna, a bar and a gym. It also had a &quot;development warehouse&quot;, which housed many items once used by the studio such as photos and graphic novels (for &quot;Max Payne&quot;) and clothes (for &quot;Alan Wake&quot;), as well as old computers, design documents, demo video tapes, and early scripts. As the studio underwent significant expansion, it relocated to a newer and bigger office, also in Espoo, in May 2018. The new office allows Remedy to accommodate a motion capture studio floor that is four times larger than the original.

As of December 2019, Remedy has more than 250 employees from 30 different countries.

== Culture and philosophy ==
The studio has specialised in making cinematic single-player action games. According to managing director Matias Myllyrinne, the studio&#x27;s games always have a strong lead character (as evidenced by Max Payne and Alan Wake), and their games must be &quot;approachable&quot; and relatable and appeal to the largest possible audience. The team hoped players would be immersed fully in the world they created. He added that themes like &quot;World War II, dragons, hardcore sci-fi, or women with tight leather outfits&quot; are something the studio would avoid. The team also aimed for &quot;movie realism&quot;, where real-world believability was important. However, the team usually took inspiration from movies, TV shows and books rather than video games as they wanted to create something unique for the video game industry. When they were developing games, they always began by creating the story, which informed and guided other aspects of development such as gameplay. Most of the company&#x27;s games are linear, but Remedy began exploring ideas like multiplayer gaming and open-ended gameplay around 2015. The studio typically used their own in-house technology, including the Northlight Engine, to power their game, and invested a lot in motion capture. It partnered with Nvidia to streamline the motion capture process.

Starting from 2016, the company began to transform itself into a multi-project studio, with each title having a shorter development cycle. This enabled the team to become more financially secure and allowed team members to choose which projects they wanted to work on. The team also began taking on work-for-hire projects; Remedy developed the single-player portion of &quot;CrossfireX&quot;. This is part of a strategy adopted by Remedy to expand into new genres and boost its popularity in different parts of the world. Although the company plans to release games more frequently, Virtala insisted that game quality would not be compromised and that a Remedy game launch would still be &quot;rare&quot;.

== Recognition ==
&quot;GamesIndustry.biz&quot; named Remedy one of its 2019 People of the Year in its successful launch of &quot;Control&quot;, its first title after their IPO. Also Hideo Kojima, known as the father of the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series, has expressed that he is a huge fan of &quot;Control&quot;, and visited Remedy&#x27;s studio during his visit to Finland in 2019.

<text>Barking &amp; Dagenham College is a general further education college in East London, England. It has three campuses across the London Borough of Barking and Dagenham with its main campus being located in Rush Green less than a mile from the Romford town centre. Their other campuses are located in Barking town center at the Technical Skills Academy, and Barking Learning Centre. 

The College is also home to the East London Institute of Technology. Institutes of Technology (IoT) were established by the Department for Education (DfE) to deliver world-class higher technical education - helping to increase the supply of high-skilled technicians across key industries that our economy needs.

Each IoT is awarded a license by DfE that outlines its role and objectives and is signed by all partners in the IoT. The Network has access to a £300 million capital funding pot to create state-of-the-art industry-standard facilities and infrastructure in which to deliver this learning. 

==History==
Originally known as Barking College, it became Barking &amp; Dagenham College in 2010.

In 2015 the College became a Digital &amp; Creative Industries Career College.

In February 2018, the College was awarded a £5m share of £25.7m funding by the Mayor, Sadiq Khan to complete its Centre for Advanced Technologies.

In 2021 the college opened the Idris Elba Studio, named after one of its famous alumni. The fully working, professional-standard television and film studio features five cameras and a gallery, a large digital production (green) screen, two broadcast video edit suites, an audio edit suite and the Foley Room which houses recording equipment for voices and sound effects.

==Courses==
The college provides intermediate, advanced and higher apprenticeship training in London. Specialisms include Construction, Project Management, Human Resources Management, Business and Pharmacy. The college has 12,500 students and an annual turnover of £36 million (Source: Audited Accounts 2015/2016).

In October 2017 the College and Huawei, a Chinese multinational technology corporation, launched a Huawei Authorized Information Network Academy.

<text>FreeJ is a modular software vision mixer for Linux systems. It is capable of real-time video manipulation, for amateur and professional uses. It can be used as an instrument in the fields of dance theater, VJing and television. FreeJ supports the input of multiple layers of video footage, which can be filtered through special-effect-chains, and then mixed for output.

== History ==
Denis Rojo (aka Jaromil) is the original author, and as of 2013 is the current maintainer. Since 0.7 was released, Silvano Galliani (aka kysucix) joined the core development team, implementing several new enhancements.

== Features ==
FreeJ can be operated in real-time from a command line console (S-Lang), and also remotely operated over the network via a Secure Shell (SSH) connection. The software provides an interface for behavior-scripting (currently accessible through JavaScript). Also, it can be used to render media to multiple screens, remote setups, encoders, and live Internet stream servers.

FreeJ can overlay, mask, transform, and filter multiple layers of footage on the screen. It supports an unlimited number of layers that can be mixed, regardless of the source. It can read input from varied sources: movie files, webcams, TV cards, images, renders and Adobe Flash animations.

FreeJ can produce a stream to an icecast server with the video being mixed and audio grabbed from soundcard. The resulting video is accessible to any computer able to decode media encoded with the theora codec.

The console interface of FreeJ is accessible via SSH and can be run as a background process. The remote interface offers simultaneous access from multiple remote locations.

<text>Yining (), also known as Ghulja () or Kulja (Kazakh: ), is a county-level city in northwestern Xinjiang, China. It is the administrative seat and largest city of Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture. Historically, Yining is the successor to the ruined city of Almaliq in neighbouring Huocheng County. Yining is the third largest city in Xinjiang after Ürümqi and Korla.

== Area and population ==
The city of Yining is a county-level administrative unit located along Ili River. As of 2015, it has an estimated population of 542,507, with a total land area of . It is the most populous city in the Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture.

The land area and population of the City of Yining saw an increase in 2003; the increase resulted from the transfer of two villages with some of land from the adjacent Yining County, which is a separate administrative unit from the city.

Yining&#x27;s population is primarily Uyghur, Han, Hui, and Kazakh, along with smaller numbers of people of Mongolian, Xibe, Uzbek, Russian, or other ethnicity.

== History ==
=== Note on historical place names ===
From the 13 to 15th century it was under the control of Chagatai Khanate. Another Mongol empire—the Zunghar Khanate—established around Ili area. In the 19th and early 20th century, the word Kuldja (from ) or Ghulja was often used in Russia and in the West as the name for the entire Chinese part of the Ili River basin as well as for its two main cities. The usage of 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica is fairly characteristic; it defines Kulja as a &quot;territory in north-west China&quot; bounded by the Russian border and the mountains that surround the Ili basin. It also talks about two major cities of the region:
* &quot;Kulja&quot; (i.e. today&#x27;s Yining) or more specifically &quot;Old Kulja&quot; (elsewhere, also called &quot;Taranchi Kulja&quot;), which was the commercial center of the region.
* &quot;Suidun&quot; (i.e. Suiding, now called Shuiding) or more specifically &quot;New Kulja&quot;, &quot;Manchu Kulja&quot; or &quot;Ili&quot; (elsewhere, also &quot;Chinese Kulja&quot;), the Chinese fortress and the regional capital.
Until the 1860s, Huiyuan to the south of Suiding was the regional capital.

=== Qing dynasty ===
The fort of Ningyuan () was built in 1762 to accommodate new settlers from southern Xinjiang. The forts of Huining () and Xichun () built later in 1765 and 1780 were also located within the modern Yining City.

The Sino-Russian Treaty of Kulja 1851 opened the area for trade.

In 1864–66, the city suffered severely from fighting during the Dungan Revolt. The city and the rest of the Ili River basin were seized by the Russians in 1871 during Yakub Beg&#x27;s independent rule of Kashgaria. It was restored to the Chinese under the terms of the Treaty of Saint Petersburg (1881). In 1888, the Ningyuan County was established.

&quot;The Geographical Magazine&quot; in 1875 by Sir Clements Robert Markham stated:
What little industry Kulja possesses is all due to the Chinese, who transplanted the taste for art, assiduity and skilfulness of their pigtailed race, even to these western outskirts of &quot;the celestial flowery dominion of the Middle.&quot; Had the Taranjis and Kalmuks been left to themselves, or had they remained in a preponderating majority, Kulja would not be a bit farther advanced than either Yarkand or Aksu. The principal trades are the following:— founders, manufacturing kettles, plates, and other implements of a very primitive form; paper-makers, whose productions do not seem to be superior to the paper manufactured at the present time after Chinese patterns at Khokand and Samarkand. There are, moreover, some confectionaries in which cakes of all shapes are baked of rice and millet, overlaid with sugar; also maccaroni-makers, the Taranjis being notoriously very fond of dried farinaceous food. In Eastern Turkistan there still exist many similar trades, and although their products are not equal to European articles of the same kind—I mean here the fabrics of the formerly western Chinese provinces— they are still said to be profitable. Finally among the tradesmen we may mention millers, vinegar manufacturers and potters. The number of factories amount to-day at Kulja to 38, wherein over 131 hands are occupied. To this of course other tradespeople have to be added, such as 169 boot-makers, 50 blacksmiths, 48 carpenters, 11 brass-founders, 3 silversmiths, 26 stone-cutters, and 2 tailors.
=== Republic of China ===
In 1914, the Ningyuan County was renamed Yining County to avoid confusion with other places in China named Ningyuan.

=== People&#x27;s Republic ===
Yining became a separate city from Yining County in 1952. In 1962, major Sino-Soviet clashes took place along the Ili River.

In 1997, in what came to be known as the Gulja Incident or massacre, the city was rocked by two days of demonstrations or riots followed by a Chinese Communist Party government crackdown resulting in at least 9 deaths following the execution of 30 Uyghur activists.

== Geography ==

Yining is located on the northern side of the Ili River in the Dzungarian basin, about east of the border with Kazakhstan and about west of Ürümqi. The Ili River valley is far wetter than most of Xinjiang and has rich grazing land.

The City of Yining borders on Huocheng County in the west and the Yining County in the east; across the river in the south is Qapqal Xibe Autonomous County.

=== Climate ===
Yining (Gulja) has a semi-arid climate (Köppen &quot;BSk&quot;), without the strong variation in seasonal precipitation seen across most of China. Dry and sunny weather dominates year-round. Winters are cold, with a January average of . Yet the influence of the Dzungarian Alatau to the northwest and Borohoro Mountains to the northeast helps keep the city warmer than more easterly locales on a similar latitude. Summers are hot, with a July average of . Diurnal temperature ranges tend to be large from April to October. The annual mean temperature is . With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 53% in December to 73% in August and September, sunshine is abundant and the city receives 2,834 hours of bright sunshine annually. Extremes since 1951 have ranged from on 29 January 1969 to on 30 July 2024.

==Administrative divisions==
The administrative divisions of Yining include eight subdistricts, 4 towns, and 5 townships:

== Economy ==
The city&#x27;s nominal GDP was approximately 20.9 billion RMB (US$3.1 billion) as of 2015 with an annual increase of 7.6%.The nominal GDP per capita was approximately 38,805 RMB (US$5976). Yining is the chief city and the agricultural and commercial center of the Ili valley. It is an old commercial center trading in tea and cattle and it is still an agricultural area with extensive livestock raising. It has fruit orchards. Iron, coal and uranium are mined nearby.

==Transportation==
* Regular bus service is available to other cities in the region and taxis are available locally.
* Ili Yining International Airport is located several kilometers north of the city.
* The Jinghe-Yining-Horgos Railway, an electrified railway from Ürümqi to Yining to Khorgos on the China-Kazakhstan border was finished in the late 2009. Daily passenger service – an overnight Ürümqi-Yining train service began on July 1, 2010.
* China National Highway 218
* China National Highway 312

==Demographics==
As of 2014, Yining had a population of 559,700. The city is inhabited by 38 ethnic groups, including 269,700 Uyghur
people, 204,000 Han people, 26,200 Kazakhs and 39,600 Hui people, accounting for 48.19%, 36.45%, 4.68% and 7.08% of gross population respectively.

== Culture ==
Ili Kazak Autonomous Prefecture Museum, opened in Yining in 2004, is one of Xinjiang&#x27;s most important museums. In fact, at the time it opened it became, in the words of a Western scholar, the &quot;only modern museum&quot; in Xinjiang. (Xinjiang of course also has the provincial museum in Ürümqi; but at that time point, its old building had been demolished, while its replacement was still under construction.) The museum houses archaeological and ethnological artefacts from throughout the prefecture.

Batul Mosque (for Uyghur people), Tatar Mosque (for Tatar people) and Shaanxi Grand Mosque (for Hui people) are considered the three main mosques in Ili.

<text>Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand (1984) is a science fiction novel by Samuel R. Delany. It is part of what would have been a &quot;diptych&quot;, in Delany&#x27;s description, of which the second half, &quot;The Splendor and Misery of Bodies, of Cities&quot;, remains unfinished.

==Plot summary==

=== Setting ===
The novel takes place in a distant future in which diverse human societies have developed on some 6,000 planets. Many of these worlds are shared with intelligent nonhumans, although only one alien species (the mysterious Xlv) also possesses faster-than-light travel. In an attempt to find a stable defense against the phenomenon known as Cultural Fugue (a process where &quot;socioeconomic pressures [reach] a point of technological recomplication and perturbation where the population completely destroys all life across the planetary surface&quot;), many human worlds have aligned themselves with one of two broad factions: the Sygn, which promotes and celebrates social diversity, and the Family, which promotes adherence to an idealized norm of human relations modeled on the nuclear family.

=== Prologue: A World Apart ===
The novel opens with a prologue set on the planet Rhyonon. Korga, a tall, &quot;ugly&quot;, misfit youth, undergoes the Radical Anxiety Termination, or RAT, procedure, a form of psychosurgery, after which he &quot;will be a slave&quot; &quot;but [he] will be happy&quot;. From then on he will be known as Rat Korga. After he has lived under a number of masters, all life on the surface of Rat Korga&#x27;s world is destroyed by a conflagration.

=== Monologues: Visible and Invisible Persons Distributed in Space ===
It is left up to debate whether Rat&#x27;s world was destroyed by &quot;Cultural Fugue&quot; or by the mysterious Xlv spacecraft who were present in the Rhyonon system when the disaster occurred. At the time of the disaster, Rat Korga was deep underground inside a refrigerated room, allowing him to survive (though badly injured) and making him the only known being to survive his world&#x27;s destruction and possible Cultural Fugue. According to Reid-Pharr, Rat Korga represents the remnants of disaster. Thus, he serves as a reminder of the possibility of Cultural Fugue and the destruction of a planet, which is part of what makes him so appealing to the inhabitants of Velm.

The action then moves to Velm, a Sygn-aligned world that humanity shares with its native three-sexed intelligent species, the evelm, and where sexual relationships take many forms — monogamous, promiscuous, anonymous, and interspecies. Resident Marq Dyeth, an &quot;industrial diplomat&quot; who helps manage the transfer of technology between different societies, is informed that Rat Korga is her perfect sexual match by an associate in the powerful and mysterious Web, an organization that manages information flows between worlds. Equipping him with a prosthesis (the rings of Vondramach Okk, a tyrant who once ruled ten planets and employed of one of Marq&#x27;s ancestors) that restores the initiative he lost due to the RAT procedure, the Web sends Rat Korga to Velm under the pretext that he is a student, and he and Marq begin a romantic and sexual affair.

During their time together, Korga and Marq go dragon hunting, a process which initially Korga mistakes to involve catching and killing dragons. However, when he hits a dragon with his bow, Korga can see through the dragon&#x27;s eyes and experience what the dragon is experiencing, prompting Rat to announce &quot;I was a dragon!&quot;, and the realisation that no dragons are going to be killed. As they return to the city of Morgre, in which Dyethsome, Marq&#x27;s ancestral home presides, they notice a large gathering of people. They seek shelter from the crowd, who appear to be gathering to see Rat Korga, with acquaintances of Marq&#x27;s friend Santine. One of the people they are with called JoBonnot informs them that Marq&#x27;s sister Black Lars&#x27; planned &quot;informal supper&quot; has been cancelled. However, later Marq discovers that the gathering was not cancelled but changed to a &quot;formal supper&quot;.

They return to Dyethshome where they attend the dinner party which involves everyone participating in hand-feeding one another. The dinner is held in the honour of the Thants, a family from the ice planet Zetzor. The Thants are considering moving to Nepiy in order to become a &quot;Focus Unit&quot;, through which they will act as representatives of the values held by The Family. The dinner soon becomes chaotic due to the disruptive presence of the Thants and the ever-growing group gathering outside to show their interest in Rat Korga. Marq overhears the Thants making derogatory comments toward the evelmi, and calling the people of the South of Velm &quot;lizard-loving perverts&quot;. Soon after, Rat Korga is forced to leave Velm and be permanently separated from Marq. According to Avilez, Rat represents the hidden secret of what happened to Rhyanon, a fact which has caused an upheaval of society and poses a threat to the Web.

=== Epilogue: Morning ===
Marq contemplates his loss of Rat Korga. She learns from Japril, a friend of hers in the Web who set up her initial meeting with Korga, that their &quot;experiment didn&#x27;t work&quot; and that it was &quot;too dangerous&quot; to leave Korga on Velm, due to the threat of Cultural Fugue. The reader learns more about the nuances of Marq&#x27;s sexual attraction and her desire for Korga. According to Avilez, Marq&#x27;s desire for Korga disrupts the power held by the Web.

==Major themes==

=== Fractured subjectivity ===

Thomas Foster argues that &quot;Stars in My Pocket&quot; treats &quot;fractured subjectivity&quot; as a natural condition by representing &quot;nonnormative racial, sexual, and familiar formations and practices&quot; as normal within Marq&#x27;s world. Quoting directly from the novel, Foster claims that &quot;[t]he utopian project of this novel resides in its attempt to imagine a future setting in which &#x27;the &#x27;fragmented subject&#x27; is at its healthiest, happiest, and most creative because society and economics contrive... to make questions of unity and centerness irrelevant&#x27;&quot; This theme of fractured identity is part of Delany&#x27;s own postmodern critique of identity that treats social categories like race, sexuality, gender, and class as absolute and static.

=== Cleansing ===

In his essay &quot;Clean&quot;, Robert F. Reid-Pharr argues that what Delany achieves in &quot;Stars&quot; &quot;is a thematization of the complex ways the spectacle of gay male identity is established through a set of essentially ritualistic practices wherein the gay man is figured clean or more precisely cleansing.&quot; The character of Korga, and his movement through RAT procedures into liberation and then to corporate slavery exemplifies this process in &quot;Stars&quot;, and Reid-Pharr also suggests a connection in this method of identity construction between the gay male subject and the subject position of the African-American slave.

=== Gender and Sexuality ===
Dr. Paivi Väätänen argues that Delany changes the logic of gender, sexuality, and language, confusing the reader, but perpetuating a liberal rejection of heteronormativity. Sexual identity is extremely liberal in Morgre due to the South of Velm&#x27;s political alignment with the Sygn. Although, homosexuality is not overly prevalent, it is accepted, normalised, and spoken about freely amongst the people there. Marq discusses how in the city in Morgre there are “more varied kinds of sex” than on the outskirts. In Morgre, every person, including evelmi, is labelled a woman and the use of the pronouns ‘she/her’ are most common. For those of whom one finds to be sexually desirable, one uses the pronouns ‘he/him’. When Korga remarks that on Rhyanon, people spoke of both women and men, Marq replies, &#x27;I know the word &quot;man&quot;...It&#x27;s an archaic term. Sometimes you&#x27;ll read over it in some old piece or other.&#x27; However, humans are referred to as male or female, depending on their sex organs, even though most of the time, the reader is left without an explanation of whether a human is male or female. The reader is told that evelmi can be male, female or neuter (all of which can become pregnant) but particular evelmi are never identified as such. This sexual and gender ambiguity and fluidity deconstructs binary structures of identity.

On Rhyanon, not only were sexual relationships between two men illegal until age twenty seven, but it was illegal at all times for a short person (like Marq) and a tall person (like Korga) to have sexual contact with one another. Slavery and radical regulations of sexual proclivity are two examples of the extremely conservative nature of Rhyanon. According to Väätänen, because these laws are largely left unexplained, the reader is forced to think about real laws which regulate sexuality, in our society.

== Genre of science fiction ==
&quot;Stars in My Pocket like Grains of Sand&quot; is about the distant future but the ideas that Delany writes about are reflections of the contemporary world. Delany himself has said, &quot;Science fiction is not ‘about the future.’ Science fiction &quot;is in dialogue with the present&quot;…[the science fiction writer] indulge[s] in a significant distortion of the present that sets up a rich and complex dialogue with the reader’s here and now.&quot; While &quot;Stars in My Pocket like Grains of Sand&quot; provides an alternative and unconventional relationship between humanity and the natural world, Delany reminds the reader to be critical about the extent in which the social distortions in the novel are actually “distant” from the current social order. As a result, &quot;Stars in My Pocket like Grains of Sand&quot; critiques and disrupts contemporary understandings of the world. These ruptures occur in from Delany’s use of third-person gender pronouns, to the redefinition of family and kinship, to the concept of technicity (technologically driven modes of social differentiation and belonging). By forcing the reader to constantly go through these breaks and fissures in their social understandings, Delany reveals &quot;the arbitrariness of these signifiers, their contingency and openness to recontextualization…as they move across worlds, literally and figuratively.&quot;

==Connections to Delany&#x27;s other work==

&quot;Stars&quot; has a number of plot elements that are similar to certain elements in &quot;Triton&quot;. Most notable is the presence in both novels of the &quot;General Information&quot; service, although it is more sophisticated in &quot;Stars&quot; (one need merely think a question for GI to place the knowledge in one&#x27;s mind, as opposed to &quot;Triton&#x27;s&quot; GI which takes questions on machines similar to modern computers). Both novels also feature aboveground and institutionalized versions of gay male cruising spaces, although open to all genders and sexual preferences; in &quot;Triton&quot; the protagonist visits such a space in the form of an indoor club, while in &quot;Stars&quot; the protagonists visit one of their city&#x27;s many parklike &quot;runs&quot; set aside for that purpose. Finally, the Family/Sygn conflict in &quot;Stars&quot; is similar to the conflict between the social systems of Earth and the Outer Satellites in &quot;Triton&quot;; a &quot;Sygn&quot; is present in Triton, but is a minor religious cult mentioned very briefly.

Delany&#x27;s short story &quot;Omegahelm&quot; (found in &quot;Aye, and Gomorrah, and other stories&quot;) is set in the same universe as &quot;Stars&quot;; it concerns Vondramach Okk (see above) and her one attempt to have a child.

Times Square Red, Times Square Blue, two nonfiction essays written by Delany, also include descriptions of cross-class, cross-ethnic, non-monogamous sexual encounters similar to those explored by Marq and Korga in the &quot;Stars.&quot;

==&quot;The Splendor and Misery of Bodies, of Cities&quot;==

All editions of &quot;Stars&quot; contain an author&#x27;s note stating that it is the first half of a diptych, the second half of which is the novel &quot;The Splendor and Misery of Bodies, of Cities.&quot; Delany took this title from the translator&#x27;s foreword to Richard Howard&#x27;s translation of Baudelaire&#x27;s &quot;Les Fleurs du Mal.&quot; An excerpt from &quot;Splendor&quot; was printed in the &quot;Review of Contemporary Fiction&quot; in September, 1996. In a 2001 interview, Delany gave this brief summary:

&quot;The book was conceived of as a city novel. For the bulk of it, the main characters, Rat and Marq, try to make their home in a city on the other side of the planet Velm from the one Marq was born and raised in. Then they have to journey back to Dyethshome, in an educational trip across Marq&#x27;s world. In the course of it, a number of things that once looked pretty fair in volume one turn out not to be so pleasant in volume two.&quot;

&quot;Splendor&quot; is unfinished, and is unlikely to ever be finished. Delany has stated two reasons for this in various writings and public appearances. First, much of the creative impetus for &quot;Stars&quot; came from his relationship with his then-partner, Frank Romeo (to whom the novel is dedicated); this relationship ended soon after the novel was published, removing much of Delany&#x27;s creative energy related to the project. Second, the novel was published just as AIDS was becoming an epidemic in the gay culture Delany was immersed in, changing it in a way that shifted Delany&#x27;s writing priorities.

In fact, &quot;Stars&quot; was the last of Delany&#x27;s major science fiction projects until 2012&#x27;s &quot;Through the Valley of the Nest of Spiders&quot;. As seen in &quot;1984: Selected Letters,&quot; at the time &quot;Stars&quot; was published his relationship with his publisher, Bantam, underwent a major rupture, with Bantam declining to print the final volume of the Return to Nevèrÿon series, &quot;Return to Nevèrÿon&quot; (eventually published by Arbor House as &quot;The Bridge of Lost Desire&quot;). Delany&#x27;s works largely went out of print in the immediately following years, and he turned to academia for his living, taking up the first of his professorial posts in 1988, at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

==Reception==
Dave Langford reviewed &quot;Stars in My Pocket Like Grains of Sand&quot; for &quot;White Dwarf&quot; #81, and stated that &quot;Neither mystery nor romance is resolved, all that being kept for Book Two – fearfully titled &quot;The Splendour and Misery of Bodies, of Cities&quot;. Book One is brilliant, uneven, insufferable, an important piece of SF.&quot;

Carl Freedman referred to it as being &quot;one of the most assured masterworks of modern American fiction.&quot;

<doc id="1085606" wikidata="Q556957" url="?curid=1085606" title="Hypervalent molecule">
<text>In chemistry, a hypervalent molecule (the phenomenon is sometimes colloquially known as expanded [[Octet rule|octet]]) is a molecule that contains one or more main group elements apparently bearing more than eight electrons in their valence shells. Phosphorus pentachloride (), sulfur hexafluoride (), chlorine trifluoride (), the chlorite () ion in chlorous acid and the triiodide () ion are examples of hypervalent molecules.

==Definitions and nomenclature==
Hypervalent molecules were first formally defined by Jeremy I. Musher in 1969 as molecules having central atoms of group 15–18 in any valence other than the lowest (i.e. 3, 2, 1, 0 for Groups 15, 16, 17, 18 respectively, based on the octet rule).

Several specific classes of hypervalent molecules exist:
* Hypervalent iodine compounds are useful reagents in organic chemistry (e.g. Dess–Martin periodinane)
* Tetra-, penta- and hexavalent phosphorus, silicon, and sulfur compounds (e.g. PCl5, PF5, SF6, sulfuranes and persulfuranes)
* Noble gas compounds (ex. xenon tetrafluoride, XeF4)
* Halogen polyfluorides (ex. chlorine pentafluoride, ClF5)

===N-X-L notation===
N-X-L nomenclature, introduced collaboratively by the research groups of Martin, Arduengo, and Kochi in 1980, is often used to classify hypervalent compounds of main group elements, where:
* N represents the number of valence electrons
* X is the chemical symbol of the central atom
* L the number of ligands to the central atom
Examples of N-X-L nomenclature include: 
* XeF2, 10-Xe-2
* PCl5, 10-P-5
* SF6, 12-S-6
* IF7, 14-I-7

==History and controversy==
The debate over the nature and classification of hypervalent molecules goes back to Gilbert N. Lewis and Irving Langmuir and the debate over the nature of the chemical bond in the 1920s. Lewis maintained the importance of the two-center two-electron (2c-2e) bond in describing hypervalence, thus using expanded octets to account for such molecules. Using the language of orbital hybridization, the bonds of molecules like PF5 and SF6 were said to be constructed from sp3dn orbitals on the central atom. Langmuir, on the other hand, upheld the dominance of the octet rule and preferred the use of ionic bonds to account for hypervalence without violating the rule (e.g. &quot; 2F−&quot; for SF6).

In the late 1920s and 1930s, Sugden argued for the existence of a two-center one-electron (2c-1e) bond and thus rationalized bonding in hypervalent molecules without the need for expanded octets or ionic bond character; this was poorly accepted at the time. In the 1940s and 1950s, Rundle and Pimentel popularized the idea of the three-center four-electron bond, which is essentially the same concept which Sugden attempted to advance decades earlier; the three-center four-electron bond can be alternatively viewed as consisting of two collinear two-center one-electron bonds, with the remaining two nonbonding electrons localized to the ligands.

The attempt to actually prepare hypervalent organic molecules began with Hermann Staudinger and Georg Wittig in the first half of the twentieth century, who sought to challenge the extant valence theory and successfully prepare nitrogen and phosphorus-centered hypervalent molecules. The theoretical basis for hypervalency was not delineated until J.I. Musher&#x27;s work in 1969.

In 1990, Magnusson published a seminal work definitively excluding the significance of d-orbital hybridization in the bonding of hypervalent compounds of second-row elements. This had long been a point of contention and confusion in describing these molecules using molecular orbital theory. Part of the confusion here originates from the fact that one must include d-functions in the basis sets used to describe these compounds (or else unreasonably high energies and distorted geometries result), and the contribution of the d-function to the molecular wavefunction is large. These facts were historically interpreted to mean that d-orbitals must be involved in bonding. However, Magnusson concludes in his work that d-orbital involvement is not implicated in hypervalency.

Nevertheless, a 2013 study showed that although the Pimentel ionic model best accounts for the bonding of hypervalent species, the energetic contribution of an expanded octet structure is also not null. In this modern valence bond theory study of the bonding of xenon difluoride, it was found that ionic structures account for about 81% of the overall wavefunction, of which 70% arises from ionic structures employing only the p orbital on xenon while 11% arises from ionic structures employing an formula_1hybrid on xenon. The contribution of a formally hypervalent structure employing an orbital of sp3d hybridization on xenon accounts for 11% of the wavefunction, with a diradical contribution making up the remaining 8%. The 11% sp3d contribution results in a net stabilization of the molecule by mol−1, a minor but significant fraction of the total energy of the total bond energy ( mol−1). Other studies have similarly found minor but non-negligible energetic contributions from expanded octet structures in SF6 (17%) and XeF6 (14%).

Despite the lack of chemical realism, the IUPAC recommends the drawing of expanded octet structures for functional groups like sulfones and phosphoranes, in order to avoid the drawing of a large number of formal charges or partial single bonds.

== Hypervalent hydrides ==
A special type of hypervalent molecules is hypervalent hydrides. Most known hypervalent molecules contain substituents more electronegative than their central atoms. Hypervalent hydrides are of special interest because hydrogen is usually less electronegative than the central atom. A number of computational studies have been performed on chalcogen hydrides and pnictogen hydrides. Recently, a new computational study has showed that most hypervalent halogen hydrides XHn can exist. It is suggested that IH3 and IH5 are stable enough to be observable or, possibly, even isolable.

==Criticism==
Both the term and concept of hypervalency still fall under criticism. In 1984, in response to this general controversy, Paul von Ragué Schleyer proposed the replacement of &#x27;hypervalency&#x27; with use of the term hypercoordination because this term does not imply any mode of chemical bonding and the question could thus be avoided altogether.

The concept itself has been criticized by Ronald Gillespie who, based on an analysis of electron localization functions, wrote in 2002 that &quot;as there is no fundamental difference between the bonds in hypervalent and non-hypervalent (Lewis octet) molecules there is no reason to continue to use the term hypervalent.&quot;

For hypercoordinated molecules with electronegative ligands such as PF5, it has been demonstrated that the ligands can pull away enough electron density from the central atom so that its net content is again 8 electrons or fewer. Consistent with this alternative view is the finding that hypercoordinated molecules based on fluorine ligands, for example PF5 do not have hydride counterparts, e.g. phosphorane (PH5) which is unknown.

The ionic model holds up well in thermochemical calculations. It predicts favorable exothermic formation of from phosphorus trifluoride PF3 and fluorine F2 whereas a similar reaction forming is not favorable.

==Alternative definition==
Durrant has proposed an alternative definition of hypervalency, based on the analysis of atomic charge maps obtained from atoms in molecules theory. This approach defines a parameter called the valence electron equivalent, γ, as “the formal shared electron count at a given atom, obtained by any combination of valid ionic and covalent resonance forms that reproduces the observed charge distribution”. For any particular atom X, if the value of γ(X) is greater than 8, that atom is hypervalent. Using this alternative definition, many species such as PCl5, , and XeF4, that are hypervalent by Musher&#x27;s definition, are reclassified as hypercoordinate but not hypervalent, due to strongly ionic bonding that draws electrons away from the central atom. On the other hand, some compounds that are normally written with ionic bonds in order to conform to the octet rule, such as ozone O3, nitrous oxide NNO, and trimethylamine N-oxide , are found to be genuinely hypervalent. Examples of γ calculations for phosphate (γ(P) = 2.6, non-hypervalent) and orthonitrate (γ(N) = 8.5, hypervalent) are shown below.

==Bonding in hypervalent molecules==
Early considerations of the geometry of hypervalent molecules returned familiar arrangements that were well explained by the VSEPR model for atomic bonding. Accordingly, AB5 and AB6 type molecules would possess a trigonal bi-pyramidal and octahedral geometry, respectively. However, in order to account for the observed bond angles, bond lengths and apparent violation of the Lewis octet rule, several alternative models have been proposed.

In the 1950s an expanded valence shell treatment of hypervalent bonding was adduced to explain the molecular architecture, where the central atom of penta- and hexacoordinated molecules would utilize d AOs in addition to s and p AOs. However, advances in the study of &quot;ab initio&quot; calculations have revealed that the contribution of d-orbitals to hypervalent bonding is too small to describe the bonding properties, and this description is now regarded as much less important. It was shown that in the case of hexacoordinated SF6, d-orbitals are not involved in S-F bond formation, but charge transfer between the sulfur and fluorine atoms and the apposite resonance structures were able to account for the hypervalency (See below).

Additional modifications to the octet rule have been attempted to involve ionic characteristics in hypervalent bonding. As one of these modifications, in 1951, the concept of the 3-center 4-electron (3c-4e) bond, which described hypervalent bonding with a qualitative molecular orbital, was proposed. The 3c-4e bond is described as three molecular orbitals given by the combination of a p atomic orbital on the central atom and an atomic orbital from each of the two ligands on opposite sides of the central atom. Only one of the two pairs of electrons is occupying a molecular orbital that involves bonding to the central atom, the second pair being non-bonding and occupying a molecular orbital composed of only atomic orbitals from the two ligands. This model in which the octet rule is preserved was also advocated by Musher. 
=== Molecular orbital theory ===
A complete description of hypervalent molecules arises from consideration of molecular orbital theory through quantum mechanical methods. An LCAO in, for example, sulfur hexafluoride, taking a basis set of the one sulfur 3s-orbital, the three sulfur 3p-orbitals, and six octahedral geometry symmetry-adapted linear combinations (SALCs) of fluorine orbitals, a total of ten molecular orbitals are obtained (four fully occupied bonding MOs of the lowest energy, two fully occupied intermediate energy non-bonding MOs and four vacant antibonding MOs with the highest energy) providing room for all 12 valence electrons. This is a stable configuration only for S&quot;X&quot;6 molecules containing electronegative ligand atoms like fluorine, which explains why SH6 is not a stable molecule. In the bonding model, the two non-bonding MOs (1eg) are localized equally on all six fluorine atoms.

===Valence bond theory===
For hypervalent compounds in which the ligands are more electronegative than the central, hypervalent atom, resonance structures can be drawn with no more than four covalent electron pair bonds and completed with ionic bonds to obey the octet rule. For example, in phosphorus pentafluoride (PF5), 5 resonance structures can be generated each with four covalent bonds and one ionic bond with greater weight in the structures placing ionic character in the axial bonds, thus satisfying the octet rule and explaining both the observed trigonal bipyramidal molecular geometry and the fact that the axial bond length (158 pm) is longer than the equatorial (154 pm).

For a hexacoordinate molecule such as sulfur hexafluoride, each of the six bonds is the same length. The rationalization described above can be applied to generate 15 resonance structures each with four covalent bonds and two ionic bonds, such that the ionic character is distributed equally across each of the sulfur-fluorine bonds.

Spin-coupled valence bond theory has been applied to diazomethane and the resulting orbital analysis was interpreted in terms of a chemical structure in which the central nitrogen has five covalent bonds;

This led the authors to the interesting conclusion that &quot;Contrary to what we were all taught as undergraduates, the nitrogen atom does indeed form five covalent linkages and the availability or otherwise of d-orbitals has nothing to do with this state of affairs.&quot;

==Structure, reactivity, and kinetics==

===Structure===

====Hexacoordinated phosphorus====
Hexacoordinate phosphorus molecules involving nitrogen, oxygen, or sulfur ligands provide examples of Lewis acid-Lewis base hexacoordination. For the two similar complexes shown below, the length of the C–P bond increases with decreasing length of the N–P bond; the strength of the C–P bond decreases with increasing strength of the N–P Lewis acid–Lewis base interaction.

====Pentacoordinated silicon====
This trend is also generally true of pentacoordinated main-group elements with one or more lone-pair-containing ligand, including the oxygen-pentacoordinated silicon examples shown below.

The Si-halogen bonds range from close to the expected van der Waals value in A (a weak bond) almost to the expected covalent single bond value in C (a strong bond).

===Reactivity===

====Silicon====
Corriu and coworkers performed early work characterizing reactions thought to proceed through a hypervalent transition state. Measurements of the reaction rates of hydrolysis of tetravalent chlorosilanes incubated with catalytic amounts of water returned a rate that is first order in chlorosilane and second order in water. This indicated that two water molecules interacted with the silane during hydrolysis and from this a binucleophilic reaction mechanism was proposed. Corriu and coworkers then measured the rates of hydrolysis in the presence of nucleophilic catalyst HMPT, DMSO or DMF. It was shown that the rate of hydrolysis was again first order in chlorosilane, first order in catalyst and now first order in water. Appropriately, the rates of hydrolysis also exhibited a dependence on the magnitude of charge on the oxygen of the nucleophile.

Taken together this led the group to propose a reaction mechanism in which there is a pre-rate determining nucleophilic attack of the tetracoordinated silane by the nucleophile (or water) in which a hypervalent pentacoordinated silane is formed. This is followed by a nucleophilic attack of the intermediate by water in a rate determining step leading to hexacoordinated species that quickly decomposes giving the hydroxysilane.

Silane hydrolysis was further investigated by Holmes and coworkers in which tetracoordinated (Mes = mesityl) and pentacoordinated were reacted with two equivalents of water. Following twenty-four hours, almost no hydrolysis of the tetracoordinated silane was observed, while the pentacoordinated silane was completely hydrolyzed after fifteen minutes. Additionally, X-ray diffraction data collected for the tetraethylammonium salts of the fluorosilanes showed the formation of hydrogen bisilonate lattice supporting a hexacoordinated intermediate from which is quickly displaced leading to the hydroxylated product. This reaction and crystallographic data support the mechanism proposed by Corriu &quot;et al.&quot;.

The apparent increased reactivity of hypervalent molecules, contrasted with tetravalent analogues, has also been observed for Grignard reactions. The Corriu group measured Grignard reaction half-times by NMR for related 18-crown-6 potassium salts of a variety of tetra- and pentacoordinated fluorosilanes in the presence of catalytic amounts of nucleophile.

Though the half reaction method is imprecise, the magnitudinal differences in reactions rates allowed for a proposed reaction scheme wherein, a pre-rate determining attack of the tetravalent silane by the nucleophile results in an equilibrium between the neutral tetracoordinated species and the anionic pentavalent compound. This is followed by nucleophilic coordination by two Grignard reagents as normally seen, forming a hexacoordinated transition state and yielding the expected product.
The mechanistic implications of this are extended to a hexacoordinated silicon species that is thought to be active as a transition state in some reactions. The reaction of allyl- or crotyl-trifluorosilanes with aldehydes and ketones only precedes with fluoride activation to give a pentacoordinated silicon. This intermediate then acts as a Lewis acid to coordinate with the carbonyl oxygen atom. The further weakening of the silicon–carbon bond as the silicon becomes hexacoordinate helps drive this reaction.

====Phosphorus====
Similar reactivity has also been observed for other hypervalent structures such as the miscellany of phosphorus compounds, for which hexacoordinated transition states have been proposed.
Hydrolysis of phosphoranes and oxyphosphoranes have been studied and shown to be second order in water. Bel&#x27;skii &quot;et al.&quot;. have proposed a prerate determining nucleophilic attack by water resulting in an equilibrium between the penta- and hexacoordinated phosphorus species, which is followed by a proton transfer involving the second water molecule in a rate determining ring-opening step, leading to the hydroxylated product. 
Alcoholysis of pentacoordinated phosphorus compounds, such as trimethoxyphospholene with benzyl alcohol, have also been postulated to occur through a similar octahedral transition state, as in hydrolysis, however without ring opening.

It can be understood from these experiments that the increased reactivity observed for hypervalent molecules, contrasted with analogous nonhypervalent compounds, can be attributed to the congruence of these species to the hypercoordinated activated states normally formed during the course of the reaction.

===Ab initio calculations===
The enhanced reactivity at pentacoordinated silicon is not fully understood. Corriu and coworkers suggested that greater electropositive character at the pentavalent silicon atom may be responsible for its increased reactivity. Preliminary ab initio calculations supported this hypothesis to some degree, but used a small basis set.

A software program for ab initio calculations, Gaussian 86, was used by Dieters and coworkers to compare tetracoordinated silicon and phosphorus to their pentacoordinate analogues. This ab initio approach is used as a supplement to determine why reactivity improves in nucleophilic reactions with pentacoordinated compounds. For silicon, the 6-31+G* basis set was used because of its pentacoordinated anionic character and for phosphorus, the 6-31G* basis set was used.

Pentacoordinated compounds should theoretically be less electrophilic than tetracoordinated analogues due to steric hindrance and greater electron density from the ligands, yet experimentally show greater reactivity with nucleophiles than their tetracoordinated analogues. Advanced ab initio calculations were performed on series of tetracoordinated and pentacoordinated species to further understand this reactivity phenomenon. Each series varied by degree of fluorination. Bond lengths and charge densities are shown as functions of how many hydride ligands are on the central atoms. For every new hydride, there is one less fluoride.

For silicon and phosphorus bond lengths, charge densities, and Mulliken bond overlap, populations were calculated for tetra and pentacoordinated species by this ab initio approach. Addition of a fluoride ion to tetracoordinated silicon shows an overall average increase of 0.1 electron charge, which is considered insignificant. In general, bond lengths in trigonal bipyramidal pentacoordinate species are longer than those in tetracoordinate analogues. Si-F bonds and Si-H bonds both increase in length upon pentacoordination and related effects are seen in phosphorus species, but to a lesser degree. The reason for the greater magnitude in bond length change for silicon species over phosphorus species is the increased effective nuclear charge at phosphorus. Therefore, silicon is concluded to be more loosely bound to its ligands.

In addition Dieters and coworkers show an inverse correlation between bond length and bond overlap for all series. Pentacoordinated species are concluded to be more reactive because of their looser bonds as trigonal-bipyramidal structures.

By calculating the energies for the addition and removal of a fluoride ion in various silicon and phosphorus species, several trends were found. In particular, the tetracoordinated species have much higher energy requirements for ligand removal than do pentacoordinated species. Further, silicon species have lower energy requirements for ligand removal than do phosphorus species, which is an indication of weaker bonds in silicon.

<doc id="1085616" wikidata="Q316278" url="?curid=1085616" title="Psamtik III">
<text>Psamtik III (Ancient Egyptian: , pronounced ), known by the Graeco-Romans as Psammetichus or Psammeticus (Ancient Greek: ), or Psammenitus (Ancient Greek: ), was the last Pharaoh of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty of Egypt from 526 BC to 525 BC. Most of what is known about his reign and life was documented by the Greek historian Herodotus in the 5th century BC. Herodotus states that Psamtik had ruled Egypt for only six months before he was confronted by a Persian invasion of his country led by King Cambyses II of Persia. Psamtik was subsequently defeated at the Battle of Pelusium, and fled to Memphis where he was captured. The deposed pharaoh was carried off to Susa in chains, and later committed suicide.

==Family==

Psamtik III was the son of the pharaoh Amasis II and one of his wives, Queen Tentkheta. He succeeded his father as pharaoh in 526 BC, when Amasis died after a long and prosperous reign of some 44 years. According to Herodotus, he had a son named Amasis and a wife and daughter, both unnamed in historical documents.

==Defeat and imprisonment==

Psamtik ruled Egypt for no more than six months. A few days after his coronation, rain fell at Thebes, which was a rare event that frightened some Egyptians, who interpreted this as a bad omen. The young and inexperienced pharaoh was no match for the invading Persians. After the Persians, under Cambyses, had crossed the Sinai desert with the aid of the Arabians, a battle was fought near Pelusium, a city on Egypt&#x27;s eastern frontier, in the spring of 525 BC and the Egyptians were defeated. Consequently, Psamtik and his army were compelled to withdraw to Memphis. The Persians captured the city after a long siege, and, subsequently Psamtik himself. Shortly thereafter, Cambyses ordered the public execution of two thousand of the principal citizens, including (according to some sources) a son of the fallen pharaoh.

==Captivity and suicide==

Psamtik&#x27;s captivity and subsequent suicide are described in &quot;The Histories&quot; by Herodotus, Book III, sections 14 and 15. Psamtik&#x27;s daughter and the daughters of all the Egyptian noblemen were enslaved. Psamtik&#x27;s son and two thousand other sons of noblemen were sentenced to death, in retaliation for the murder of the Persian ambassador and the two hundred crew of his boat. An &quot;old man who had once been the king&#x27;s friend&quot; was reduced to beggary. All these people were brought before Psamtik to test his reaction, and he only became upset after seeing the state of the beggar.

Psamtik&#x27;s compassion for the beggar caused him to be spared, but his son had already been executed. The deposed pharaoh was then raised up to live in the entourage of the Persian King. After a while, however, Psamtik attempted to raise a rebellion among the Egyptians. When Cambyses learned of this, Psamtik is reported by Herodotus to have drunk bull&#x27;s blood and immediately died.

<text>Günter Theodor Netzer (born 14 September 1944) is a German former professional football player, executive and pundit. He achieved great success in Germany with Borussia Mönchengladbach in the early 1970s and, after moving to Spain in 1973, with Real Madrid. A technically gifted playmaker, Netzer played as an attacking midfielder or as a deep-lying playmaker and is considered one of the greatest passers in the game&#x27;s history. He was voted German Footballer of the Year twice, in 1972 and 1973. 

Netzer was the general manager for Hamburger SV during much of the team&#x27;s golden period from the late 1970s through the early 1980s, when the club won three league titles and the 1983 European Cup.

== Club career ==

=== Borussia Mönchengladbach ===
Netzer, the son of a greengrocer, played for 1. FC Mönchengladbach from the age of eight until 19 before switching to city rivals Borussia Mönchengladbach in 1963. He scored on his debut against Rot-Weiß Oberhausen, and quickly established himself as a first team regular, helping the club win promotion to the Bundesliga in 1965.

Netzer played for Borussia, managed by Hennes Weisweiler, until 1973. In his 230 Bundesliga games for them, he scored 82 goals. The era also saw one of the most competitive rivalries in the Bundesliga&#x27;s history between Borussia Mönchengladbach and Bayern Munich. Bayern Munich had stars Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller, Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck, Paul Breitner and Sepp Maier on their side while Mönchengladbach had Berti Vogts, Herbert Wimmer, Jupp Heynckes, Rainer Bonhof and Netzer. When they achieved their first successes the average age of both teams was 21.

With Borussia Mönchengladbach he won the Bundesliga in 1970 and 1971 (the first Bundesliga club to win back-to-back championships), and the DFB-Pokal in 1973. The final was a famous match against 1. FC Köln in which he started as a sub – it is said because he had told his manager of his intention to move to Spain after the season – and went onto the pitch during extra time on his own authority, simply telling the coach &quot;I&#x27;ll go and play now&quot; whilst removing his tracksuit. He then went on to score the winning goal three minutes later, with only his second possession of the ball. By then Netzer had achieved a certain pop star-like popularity because of his good looks, flowing blond hair, and perceived rebel personality and playboy lifestyle. Netzer was voted German Footballer of the Year twice, in 1972 and 1973, by the country&#x27;s football journalists. 

=== Real Madrid ===

When Johan Cruyff joined FC Barcelona in 1973, Real Madrid needed to respond in kind. So Santiago Bernabéu signed him and Paul Breitner a year later. Netzer was the first German player to play for the club. He played in Spain until 1976, winning La Liga in 1975 and 1976 and the Copa del Rey in 1974 and 1975. After his three-year spell in the Spanish capital, Netzer joined Grasshopper Club Zürich, where in 1977 he finished his playing career.

== International career ==
Netzer made his debut for the West Germany national team in October 1965 in a friendly against Austria. He represented West Germany 37 times from 1965 to 1975, scoring six goals (some from the penalty spot) and playing a vital role in the country&#x27;s victory at UEFA Euro 1972. He also appeared briefly (for 21 minutes against East Germany) in the 1974 FIFA World Cup, during which time the only goal of the match was scored against his team. At the tournament, Wolfgang Overath was the central figure in Germany&#x27;s midfield; Netzer, despite being friends with Overath, considered the pair as not being able to play together effectively. Although he did not play in the final, Netzer is nonetheless considered the first World Cup winner to, at the time of winning, play for a club that was based outside his country.

== Style of play ==
A classic playmaker known for his technique and passing ability, Netzer is considered one of the best midfielders of all time. Positioned as a midfielder in front of the defence, Netzer often dropped back between the back line. From there, he organised the game from deep and served his team-mates with precise long balls. During his time at Mönchengladbach, Netzer was also deployed as a libero at times. Apart from his superior ball skills, his natural authority made him the undisputed leader of his team. As a player for Borussia Mönchengladbach, he enjoyed a lot of freedom from the management and the coach Hennes Weisweiler, even off the pitch. On the field the way he orchestrated the team&#x27;s midfield play earned him the nickname &#x27;Karajan&#x27;, after the conductor Herbert von Karajan.

== Managerial career ==

After his career as a player Netzer offered to publish Hamburger SV&#x27;s stadium magazine. The president, Paul Benthien, agreed on the condition that he also became general manager. Netzer spent eight successful years in Hamburg, during which time he completely transformed Hamburg&#x27;s team, managed to sign famous coaches like Branko Zebec and later Ernst Happel, and led the club to three Bundesliga titles (1979, 1982, 1983). In 1983, Hamburg reached the final of the European Cup. With Horst Hrubesch, Felix Magath and Manfred Kaltz, Hamburg pulled off one of the biggest upsets in European Cup history by beating a Juventus side packed with Italian players who had won the World Cup a year earlier and two star import players – Michel Platini and Zbigniew Boniek. The years with Günter Netzer are today considered the most successful period in Hamburg&#x27;s history.

== Media businessman and football expert ==
After the end of his playing career, Netzer founded an advertising agency in Zürich, Switzerland, where he continues to live. He also deals in TV rights and is currently &quot;executive director&quot; of the Swiss sports rights managing agency Infront Sports &amp; Media AG, a partner company of the German Football Association.

Apart from that, Netzer worked as a reporter and football pundit on TV. For his work with the German TV channel ARD and host Gerhard Delling, commenting on games of the Germany national team, both received the prestigious Adolf Grimme Award in 2000.

Despite their frequent arguments on TV, which they have developed into a kind of iconic skit, Netzer and Delling are said to be close friends. Netzer was Delling&#x27;s best man at his wedding in May 2003.

It was the duo&#x27;s harsh criticism of the Germany national side&#x27;s poor performance that triggered Rudi Völler&#x27;s famous eruption on 6 September 2003, immediately after the international match against Iceland. The then &quot;Bundestrainer&quot; (manager) harshly criticized Netzer, some considered it abusively, in a live interview after the goalless draw.

Following the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Netzer announced he was leaving the ARD after 13 years.

Netzer is married and has one daughter. Having lived in Switzerland since the end of his football career, he has also acquired Swiss citizenship.

<text>Karamay (also spelled Karamai) is a prefecture-level city in the north of the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is surrounded on all sides by Tacheng Prefecture. The name of the city comes from the Uyghur language and means &quot;black oil&quot;, referring to the oil fields near the city. 

Karamay was the site of one of the worst disasters in modern Chinese history, the 1994 Karamay fire, when 324 people, including 288 school children, lost their lives in a cinema fire on 8 December 1994.

==History==
==Subdivisions==
Karamay City has jurisdiction over four districts (). They are not contiguous as Dushanzi District is located south of the Lanxin Railway and forms an exclave, separated from the rest of Karamay City by Kuytun City. Together with Kuytun City, Karamay City forms an enclave surrounded on all sides by Tacheng Prefecture.

==Geography==
Karamay is located in the northwest of the Dzungarian basin, with an average elevation of . Its administrative area ranges in latitude from 44° 07&#x27; to 46° 08&#x27; N and in longitude from 80° 44&#x27; to 86° 01&#x27; E and has a maximal north–south extent and reaches in east–west width. It borders Hoboksar Mongol Autonomous County to the northeast, Shawan County to the southeast, Toli County and Wusu to the west and Kuytun to the south.

The naturally available water supply in the Karamay area is limited: it mostly consists of two small rivers (the Baiyang River and the Da&#x27;erbute River () flowing into the Dzungarian Basin from the mountains of its northwestern rim. In addition, the city receives water from the Irtysh River, over the Irtysh–Karamay Canal, which was officially opened in 2008.

A number of natural (Ailik Lake) and artificial (Fengcheng, Huangyangquan) reservoirs are located in Karamay&#x27;s northeastern Urho District; they all are replenished, directly or indirectly, by water from the Irtysh–Karamay Canal.

=== Climate ===
Karamay has an extremely continental desert climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;BWk&quot;, Trewartha &quot;BWac&quot;), typified by great seasonal extremes in temperature, varying by ; with long, very hot summers (for its latitude) and long, severely cold winters with brief spring and autumn in between. The monthly 24-hour average temperature is in January and soars to in July and the annual mean is , warmer than most places at the corresponding latitude, due to the long summers. Annual precipitation is and the summer months record the most rainfall, despite relative humidity levels averaging around 30%. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 37% in December to 71% in September, sunshine is generous, only occurring less than 50% of the time in November and December and the annual average total is 2,694 hours.

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 census, over 80% of Karamay&#x27;s population are Han Chinese, with minorities such as Uighur, Kazakhs, Mongols and Hui making up the rest. The population of 2010 is 391,008, a rise from the 270,232 of 2000 census. The population density is 50.6 inhabitants per km2. The 2015 population estimate is 401,468.

;Population by ethnicity (2010)
==Economy==
In 1955, one of the largest oil fields in China was discovered there. Since then, the city has grown into an oil-producing and refining center.

In 2008, the GDP reached ¥66.1 billion and GDP per capita reached ¥242,391 (US$34,901), ranking first among 659 cities in mainland China.

== Transport ==
*Kuytun–Beitun Railway. There are passenger stations in Karamay itself and in Wuwu New Town (), south of central Karamay.
*Karamay–Tacheng Railway (under construction as of 2017)
*Kelamayi Guhai Airport
*China National Highway 217

<text>Mahébourg is a small town on the south-eastern coast of the island of Mauritius, having a population of 15,457 as of 2015. It is considered the main town of the Grand Port District.

== Overview ==
Mahébourg is named after Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais, one of the most successful governors of the French colonial period. The town was originally built by the Dutch during their brief period of colonisation of the island. It was close to their landing port, had ample water supply from many rivers and streams and had a scenic view of the large bay area. Mahébourg underwent major development around 1806, during the French colonisation era.
The well-planned wide streets in the old section of Mahébourg still bear testimony to this Dutch and French colonial past. After the French chose Port Louis as the main port, Mahébourg declined into a sleepy coastal city. The past is still preserved today in the Historical Naval Museum which also recounts the epic naval battles of the past between the French Navy and the Royal Navy. The Frederik Hendrik museum in Vieux Grand Port recounts the history of the early Dutch settlement of the island.

Nowadays, Mahébourg is a bustling centre of local trade. The new waterfront complex offers memorable walks along the seaside. The town has a casino, mark of a developing tourism industry. There is a growing number of small inns in the city itself and the surrounding districts which cater to local and foreign visitors. Mahébourg is well known for its lagoon (the biggest in Mauritius) and for its fishing industry.

The town has three primary schools, namely Willoughby Government School, Dupérré Government School and Notre Dame des Anges Roman Catholic Aided (RCA), and four secondary schools: Emmanuel Anquetil State Secondary School, Hamilton College Boys, Hamilton College Girls and Loretto Convent of Mahébourg.

== Companies ==
The largest company and the main employer for the Mahebourg area is Omnicane. Omnicane&#x27;s sugarcane mill is based at La Baraque which annually produces around 135,000 tonnes of Plantation White Sugar for the refinery, 400,000 tonnes of bagasse for its main cogeneration power plant, and 45,000 tonnes of molasses for the bioethanol distillery. Using energy-saving diffuser technology for juice extraction, Omnicane&#x27;s sugarcane mill processes 1.3 million tonnes of sugarcane a year and has a daily milling capacity of 8,500 tonnes.

<doc id="1085643" wikidata="Q8001473" url="?curid=1085643" title="Wildmat">
<text>wildmat is a pattern matching library developed by Rich Salz. Based on the wildcard syntax already used in the Bourne shell, wildmat provides a uniform mechanism for matching patterns across applications with simpler syntax than that typically offered by regular expressions. Patterns are implicitly anchored at the beginning and end of each string when testing for a match.

In June 2019, Rich Salz released the original version of the now-defunct library on GitHub under a public domain dedication.

==Pattern matching operations==
There are five pattern matching operations other than a strict one-to-one match between the pattern and the source to be checked for a match.
* Asterisk (*) to match any sequence of zero or more characters.
* Question mark (?) to match any single character.
* Set of specified characters. It is specified as a list of characters, or as a range of characters where the beginning and end of the range are separated by a minus (or dash) character, or as any combination of lists and ranges. The dash can also be included in the set as a character if it is the beginning or end of the set. This set is enclosed in square brackets. The close square bracket (]) may be used in a set if it is the first character in the set.
* Negation of a set. It is specified the same way as the set with the addition of a caret character (^) at the beginning of the test string just inside the open square bracket. (NNTP specifies an alternative !. The implementation can be configured to do either.)
* Backslash (\) character to invalidate the special meaning of the open square bracket ([), the asterisk, backslash or the question mark. Two backslashes in sequence will result in the evaluation of the backslash as a character with no special meaning.

===Examples===
* &quot;*foo*&quot; matches string containing &quot;foo&quot;.
* &quot;mini*&quot; matches anything that begins with &quot;mini&quot; (including the string &quot;mini&quot; itself).
* &quot;???*&quot; matches any string of three and more letters.
* &quot;[0-9a-zA-Z]&quot; matches every single alphanumeric ASCII character.
* &quot;[^]-]&quot; matches a character other than a close square bracket or a dash.

==Usage==
wildmat is most commonly seen in NNTP implementations such as Salz&#x27;s own INN, also in unrelated software such as GNU tar and Transmission. GNU tar replaced wildmat with the POSIX fnmatch glob matcher in September 1992. The early version contained a potential out-of-bound access on unclosed .

The original byte oriented wildmat implementation is unable to handle multibyte character sets, and poses problems when the text being searched may contain multiple incompatible character sets. A simplified version of wildmat oriented toward UTF-8 encoding has been developed by the IETF NNTP working group. It is a part of (section 4), the 2006 standard for NNTP.

In the newer INN which supports UTF-8, a &quot;uwildmat&quot; was added which supports all the features of wildmat. This 2000 rewrite, performed by Russ Allbery, fixes the OOB in the original implementation. Tightly-wound C loops were written out into smaller statements.

Rsync includes a GPLv3-licensed wildmat descendant known as wildmatch, modified by Wayne Davison. The Git version control system imports and makes use of it. It does not support UTF-8, but has the OOB fixed and has additional support for character classes and star globs (** for arbitrary-depth).

<doc id="1085647" wikidata="Q173465" url="?curid=1085647" title="David Richards (motorsport executive)">
<text>David Pender Richards is the chairman of Prodrive and chairman of Motorsport UK. He is former chairman of Aston Martin and a former team principal of the BAR and Benetton Formula One teams.

==Rally driving==
Richards won the 1981 World Rally Championship as a co-driver to Ari Vatanen.

==Prodrive circuit racing==
In 1987 Prodrive entered into what was to become a long-standing partnership with BMW in the British Touring Car Championship. They took the Class B title three times, from 1988 to 1990, winning outright in 1988 with Frank Sytner.

==Formula One==

Richards became chief executive of Benetton Formula in , replacing Flavio Briatore. He left after just a year in his post and was replaced by Rocco Benetton for .

When the British American Racing (BAR) team was restructuring after the departure of Craig Pollock in 2001, the owners, British American Tobacco (BAT), brought in Prodrive to run the team with Richards as its team principal. Under his direction there was an immediate improvement in performance, ultimately leading to the team taking second place in the 2004 F1 Constructors&#x27; Championship. Richards also brought Jenson Button to the team and made him lead driver, providing the majority of their championship points in 2004. This success led to BAT selling a 45% share of the team to Honda in late 2004. With Prodrive having completed its management contract with BAT, Richards stood down as team principal and Prodrive&#x27;s then managing director Nick Fry assumed this role.

His Prodrive company entered a bid to enter a Formula One team for the 2008 season and on 28 April 2006, Prodrive were officially granted entry when the FIA announced the list of entrants to the 2008 Formula One World Championship. However, on 22 November 2007, he was forced to announce that Prodrive F1 would not be competing in the 2008 Formula One World Championship after a lack of clarity over the legality of &#x27;customer cars&#x27; and the threat of possible legal action.

==Aston Martin==
On 12 March 2007, Richards led a consortium of investors including Investment Dar and Adeem Investment, raising $925 million to finance the purchase of Aston Martin from Ford. Richards subsequently became chairman of the car company. He stepped down from this role at the end of 2013.

==Personal life==
On 16 September 2007 Richards and his wife, Karen, survived a forced landing in their helicopter in Essex whilst returning from the 2007 Belgian Grand Prix, less than 24 hours after his former WRC driver, Colin McRae, perished in a similar accident along with his son and two others. Based on Prodrive&#x27;s statement after the incident, Richards was piloting Prodrive&#x27;s Eurocopter EC 135. Both Richards and his wife Karen walked away unharmed.

In the 2005 New Year Honours, Richards was appointed a CBE for his services to motorsport. In 2017, he was inducted into the Motor Sport Hall of Fame and received the Spirit of Le Mans award from the Automobile Club de l’Ouest (ACO). In 2019 he received the Autocar Outstanding Leader Award. Cranfield School of Management awarded Richards an Honorary Doctor of Science degree in 2008.

<text>Richard Michael Beem (born August 24, 1970) is an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour and is best known for his upset victory at the 2002 PGA Championship.

== Career ==

Beem was born in Phoenix, Arizona, grew up in El Paso, Texas, and played college golf at New Mexico State University in Las Cruces.

Beem turned professional in 1994. His early career was broken up by a spell in Seattle selling car stereos and cell phones. He later regained interest after J. P. Hayes won the 1998 Buick Classic .

This changed in 1999 when Beem won the Kemper Open as a rookie. His career took a further leap forward in 2002 with a victory at The International in Castle Rock, Colorado.

Two weeks later, Beem won the 2002 PGA Championship at Hazeltine National, one of golf&#x27;s four major tournaments. He shot a par 72 in the first round, but followed that with a six-under 66 in the second round to pull into a five-way tie for first place. In the third round, he again shot 72 and was the second place player, three strokes behind leader Justin Leonard. In the fourth round, Beem fended off Tiger Woods, who birdied his last four holes but finished one shot behind Beem, who shot a final round 68 to Woods&#x27; 67. This victory helped establish Beem in the top 20 of the Official World Golf Ranking.

Until this win, Beem was best known for the book &quot;Bud, Sweat and Tees: A Walk on the Wild Side of the PGA Tour&quot; by Alan Shipnuck, which profiled his rookie year on the PGA Tour and the often wild lifestyle of him and his caddie, Steve Duplantis.

At the 2007 Nissan Open at Riviera, Beem made a hole-in-one at the 14th hole on live television on Saturday to win a new red Altima coupe, which he immediately ascended, embraced, and sat atop of in triumph. The sequence was later made into a Nissan commercial. Beem credited Peter Jacobsen for inspiring his reaction; Jacobsen aced the same hole in 1994 and hopped into the nearby 300ZX convertible and pretended to drive it.

Beem was sidelined in 2010 after undergoing back surgery to repair damage to his C6 and C7 vertebrae. While Beem was expected to only miss six weeks, rehabilitation issues caused the layoff to encompass the remainder of the 2010 season. Beem played the 2011 season on a medical exemption that required him to make $658,100 in 17 events. He missed the first six cuts of the 2011 season before making the cut at the Valero Texas Open. He finished tied for 15th. Beem made just five cuts in 21 events. As a result, he lost his tour card and played the remainder of the season out of the &quot;past champions&quot; category in 2012. He played on the European Tour in 2012, the last year of his ten-year exemption on that tour for winning the 2002 PGA Championship.

In 2015, Beem joined Sky Sports as a television commentator and golf analyst. He also planned to play at the UBS Hong Kong Open, but gave up his sponsor exemption to allow Ian Poulter to keep his European Tour card. In 2020, Beem was a color commentator for the video game PGA Tour 2K21. Two years later, he returned in the same role for the PGA Tour 2K23.

Beem resides in Austin, Texas.

<doc id="1085659" wikidata="Q967540" url="?curid=1085659" title="Leon Schuster">
<text>Leon Ernest &quot;Schucks&quot; Schuster (born 21 May 1951) is a South African filmmaker, comedian, actor, prankster and singer.

==Early life==
Schuster was drawn to the filmmaking process at an early age. As a child he and his brother would play practical jokes on his family and film it. He explained, in a 2010 interview about his early life in Bloemfontein, &quot;I remember running down the aisle of the Ritz Theatre, playing cowboys &amp; crooks, which was all the rage at the time. I also remember loving Laurel and Hardy, Charlie Chaplin and the Three Stooges. I was always acting things out, and pulling pranks. I used to fool my grandma into thinking I’d shot myself in the foot with my pellet gun… tomato sauce everywhere, me squealing like a wild pig. Pranking is just in my nature, but I’d never thought I’d become a movie star… no, I’m not a movie star, I’m just a local outjie that likes to entertain people.&quot;

Schuster studied for a BA degree at the University of the Orange Free State, where he played rugby for the first team. He returned to Jim Fouché as a teacher for two years.

==Career==
Schuster began working for the South African Broadcasting Corporation. During his time at the SABC, he created the Afrikaans radio series &quot;Vrypostige&quot; &quot;Mikrofoon&quot; with Fanus Rautenbach – which involved disguising his voice and playing phone pranks on unsuspecting victims.

===Music===
In 1982, Schuster was approached by Decibel Records to compile a series of sports songs which resulted in his first record entitled, &quot;Leon Schuster&quot;, having sold 10,000 units. His second album, &quot;Broekskeur&quot; (&#x27;trouser-tearing&#x27; literal translation, broekskeur means that things are difficult - you are having a difficult time), sold in excess of 40,000 units. This was then followed by &quot;Briekdans and Leon Schuster – 20 Treffers&quot;, which sold more than 270,000 copies.

His hit CD &quot;Hier Kom Die Bokke&quot; (&#x27;Here Come The Boks&#x27;) garnered an FNB Sama Music Award for Biggest Selling CD of 1995. His following CD, &quot;Gatvol in Paradise&quot;, sold in more than 125,000 units and gave rise to the unofficial Gauteng anthem &quot;Gautengeleng&quot;.

===Film===
Schuster&#x27;s first feature, &quot;You Must Be Joking!&quot;, produced in collaboration with Johan Scholtz and Elmo de Witt, became popular with South African audiences and gave rise to the sequel &quot;You Must be Joking! Too&quot;.

These films were candid camera sketches and Schuster made many more of these films as well as slap-stick films, including &quot;Mr Bones&quot;, his most successful film, which earned more than R33 million at the South African box office.

On 16 September 2011 it was reported that Schuster&#x27;s next movie, &quot;Mad Buddies&quot;, would be partly financed by the Walt Disney Company, which would also handle the distribution and marketing of the film. The film was released in 2012 and starred Schuster opposite funnyman Kenneth Nkosi. It received poor reviews, and garnered R4.5 million in the opening weekend from a budget of R20 million.

==Comedic style==
According to Schuster, his appeal to the public stems from him making &quot;them used to a certain style of comedy that they seem to like. They like trouble, and they know when Schuster is there, there is trouble. They also like me to rip off the topical stuff be risky and take chances...and get &#x27;!&quot;. 

In 2018, the comedian was &quot;unapologetic about playing on every racial stereotype in his films&quot;, but openly admitted that he &quot;does have some regrets about having profited from blackface&quot;. He further stated: &quot;I&#x27;m so sorry that I can&#x27;t make &quot;Mama Jack 2&quot;. If I had a dream come true, my next movie would be &quot;Mama Jack 2&quot;. But especially on Twitter they said stay away from the blackface, it&#x27;s not on. It was black people talking to me and you&#x27;ve got to listen. I can&#x27;t do it because I&#x27;ll be heavily criticised. In the olden days it troubled nobody. But I won&#x27;t go blackface now, I can&#x27;t do it. There&#x27;s not one actor in the world that will. It&#x27;s just racist&quot;.

===Showmax film removals===
On 19 June 2020, South African streaming service Showmax removed over six of Schuster&#x27;s films, citing his content as being &quot;racially insensitive&quot;, considering he has used blackface in many of his films for &quot;comedic effect&quot;. This came during the heightened Black Lives Matter protests. Schuster reacted, saying he was &quot;shocked&quot; and &quot;can&#x27;t believe that the content of his films does any harm&quot;. He said his work is &quot;innocent&quot; and just him &quot;pranking people&quot;.

&quot;Frank and Fearless&quot; (2018) was returned to the circuit after review.

<text>Turkix was a live Linux distribution, capable of self-installing on hard disk using a graphical wizard. The main goal of Turkix was to provide a very user-friendly Linux environment. Turkix was based on the Mandriva distribution. In visual style Turkix was similar to Windows XP.

First two releases of Turkix (1.0 and 1.9) were in Turkish and Azerbaijani only, but later releases had more language support, especially English.

Latest stable release of Turkix was 3.0, and the last unstable release was 10.0 Alpha. At this point the project was aborted.

<doc id="1085675" wikidata="Q3623255" url="?curid=1085675" title="Slavica Ecclestone">
<text>Slavica Ecclestone (&#x27;Radić; born 2 June 1958) is a Croatian former model and the ex-wife of former Formula 1 CEO Bernie Ecclestone.

== Early life ==
Ecclestone was born in Rijeka, where her Serb parents—Jovan &quot;Jovo&quot; Radić and Ljubica Malić from Maglajani and Riječani, respectively, both villages within the Laktaši municipality, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina—had settled shortly before her birth in search of expanded job opportunities. The family soon moved back to northern Bosnia to her father&#x27;s village, meaning Slavica would spend the majority of her childhood in Maglajani. After her parents divorced when she was seven years old, being raised by her mother Ljubica, Slavica was taught to &quot;not do to someone else what you wouldn&#x27;t want to be done to yourself.&quot;

== Career ==
In her early career, Slavica worked as a fashion model, modelling for a number of clients, including the designer Armani. While working on a Formula One promotional event for Armani at the 1982 Italian Grand Prix in Monza, the twenty-four-year-old model met fifty-two-year-old Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone.

== Personal life ==

From her marriage, Slavica has two daughters, Tamara (born 1984) and Petra (born 1988).

In November 2008, Slavica filed for divorce after 23 years of marriage. The divorce was granted on 11 March 2009. She ranked 194 in &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;&#x27; Rich List after she was awarded an estimated £740 million from her divorce.

In December 2019, she put her Chelsea mansion up for sale for more than £100m after daughter Tamara&#x27;s home in Kensington Palace Gardens was raided and jewels worth £50m were stolen.

<doc id="1085678" wikidata="Q185426" url="?curid=1085678" title="Blackfin">
<text>Blackfin is a family of 16-/32-bit microprocessors developed, manufactured and marketed by Analog Devices. The processors have built-in, fixed-point digital signal processor (DSP) functionality performed by 16-bit multiply–accumulates (MACs), accompanied on-chip by a microcontroller. It was designed for a unified low-power processor architecture that can run operating systems while simultaneously handling complex numeric tasks such as real-time H.264 video encoding.

==Architecture details==
Blackfin processors use a 32-bit RISC microcontroller programming model on a SIMD architecture, which was co-developed by Intel and Analog Devices, as MSA (Micro Signal Architecture).

The architecture was announced in December 2000, and first demonstrated at the Embedded Systems Conference in June, 2001.

It incorporates aspects of ADI&#x27;s older SHARC architecture and Intel&#x27;s XScale architecture into a single core, combining digital signal processing (DSP) and microcontroller functionality. There are many differences in the core architecture between Blackfin/MSA and XScale/ARM or SHARC, but the combination was designed to improve performance, programmability and power consumption over traditional DSP or RISC architecture designs.

The Blackfin architecture encompasses various CPU models, each targeting particular applications. The BF-7xx series, introduced in 2014, comprise the Blackfin+ architecture, which expands on the Blackfin architecture with some new processor features and instructions.

==Architecture features==
===Core features===
What is regarded as the Blackfin &quot;core&quot; is contextually dependent. For some applications, the DSP features are central. Blackfin has two 16-bit hardware MACs, two 40-bit ALUs and accumulators, a 40-bit barrel shifter, and four 8-bit video ALUs; Blackfin+ processors add a 32-bit MAC and 72-bit accumulator. This allows the processor to execute up to three instructions per clock cycle, depending on the level of optimization performed by the compiler or programmer. Two nested zero-overhead loops and four circular buffer DAGs (data address generators) are designed to assist in writing efficient code requiring fewer instructions. Other applications use the RISC features, which include memory protection, different operating modes (user, kernel), single-cycle opcodes, data and instruction caches, and instructions for bit test, byte, word, or integer accesses and a variety of on-chip peripherals.

The ISA is designed for a high level of expressiveness, allowing the assembly programmer (or compiler) to optimize an algorithm for the hardware features present. The standard Blackfin assembly language is written using an algebraic syntax: instead of prefix commands used in many other assembly languages.
===Memory and DMA===
The Blackfin uses a byte-addressable, flat memory map. Internal L1 memory, internal L2 memory, external memory and all memory-mapped control registers reside in this 32-bit address space, so that from a programming point of view, the Blackfin has a Von Neumann architecture.

The L1 internal SRAM memory, which runs at the core-clock speed of the device, is based on a Harvard architecture. Instruction memory and data memory are independent and connect to the core via dedicated memory buses, designed for higher sustained data rates between the core and L1 memory.

Portions of instruction and data L1 SRAM can be optionally configured as cache independently.

Certain Blackfin processors also have between 64KB and 256KB of L2 memory. This memory runs slower than the core clock speed. Code and data can be mixed in L2.

Blackfin processors support a variety of external memories including SDRAM, DDR-SDRAM, NOR flash, NAND flash and SRAM. Some Blackfin processors also include mass-storage interfaces such as ATAPI and SD/SDIO. They can support hundreds of megabytes of memory in the external memory space.

Coupled with the core and memory system is a DMA engine that can operate between any of its peripherals and main (or external) memory. The processors typically have a dedicated DMA channel for each peripheral, which is designed for higher throughput for applications that can use it, such as real-time standard-definition (D1) video encoding and decoding.

===Microcontroller features===
The architecture of Blackfin contains the usual CPU, memory, and I/O that is found on microprocessors or microcontrollers. These features enable operating systems.

All Blackfin processors contain a Memory Protection Unit (MPU). The MPU provides protection and caching strategies across the entire memory space. The MPU allows Blackfin to support operating systems, RTOSs and kernels like ThreadX, μC/OS-II, or NOMMU Linux. Although the MPU is referred to as a Memory Management Unit (MMU) in the Blackfin documentation, the Blackfin MPU does not provide address translation like a traditional MMU, so it does not support virtual memory or separate memory addresses per process. This is why Blackfin currently can not support operating systems requiring virtual memory such as WinCE or QNX.

Blackfin supports three run-time modes: supervisor, user and emulation. In supervisor mode, all processor resources are accessible from the running process. However, when in user mode, system resources and regions of memory can be protected (with the help of the MPU). In a modern operating system or RTOS, the kernel typically runs in supervisor mode and threads/processes will run in user mode. If a thread crashes or attempts to access a protected resource (memory, peripheral, etc.) an exception will be thrown and the kernel will then be able to shut down the offending thread/process. The official guidance from ADI on how to use the Blackfin in non-OS environments is to reserve the lowest-priority interrupt for general-purpose code so that all software is run in supervisor space.

Blackfin uses a variable-length RISC-like instruction set consisting of 16-, 32- and 64-bit instructions. Commonly used control instructions are encoded as 16-bit opcodes while complex DSP and mathematically intensive functions are encoded as 32- and 64-bit opcodes. This variable length opcode encoding is designed for code density equivalence to modern microprocessor architectures.

===Media-processing features===
The Blackfin instruction set contains media-processing extensions to help accelerate pixel-processing operations commonly used in video compression and image compression and decompression algorithms.

==Peripherals==

Blackfin processors contain an array of connectivity peripherals, depending on the specific processor:

* ATAPI
* CAN: A wide-area, low-speed serial bus used in some automotive and industrial electronics
* DMA with support for memory-to-memory DMA and peripheral DMA
* EMAC (Ethernet Media Access Controller) with MII and RMII
* External memory: the EBIU (External Bus Interface Unit) can include a controller for SDRAM, Mobile SDRAM, DDR1, DDR2, or LPDDR, and an asynchronous memory controller for SRAM, ROM, flash EPROM, and memory-mapped I/O devices
* GPIO including level-triggered and edge-triggered interrupts
* I²C, also known as TWI (Two-Wire Interface): a lower speed, shared serial bus
* MXVR: a MOST Network Interface Controller
* NAND flash
* PPI: A parallel input/output port that can be used to connect to LCDs, video encoders (video DACs), video decoders (video ADCs), CMOS sensors, CCDs and generic, parallel, high-speed devices. The PPI can run up to 75 MHz and can be configured from 8 to 16-bits wide.
* PWM and timers/counters
* Real-time clock
* SD/SDIO
* SPI: a fast serial bus used in some high-speed embedded electronics applications
* SPORT: A synchronous, high speed serial port that can support TDM, I²S and a number of other configurable framing modes for connection to ADCs, DACs, other processors, FPGAs, etc.
* UART: allows for bi-directional communication with RS-232 devices (PCs, modems, PC peripherals, etc.), MIDI devices, IRDA devices
* USB 2.0 OTG (On-The-Go)
* Watchdog timer

All of the peripheral control registers are memory-mapped in the normal address space.

==Development tools==

ADI provides its own software development toolchains. The original VisualDSP++ IDE is still supported (its last release was 5.1.2 in ), but is approaching end of life and has not had support added for the new BF6xx and BF7xx processors. The newer toolchain is CrossCore Embedded Studio, which uses supports all Blackfin and Blackfin+ processors using upgraded versions of the same compiler and tools internally, but with a UI based on Eclipse CDT. No free version of either tool is available; a single-user license for VisualDSP++ costs $3500 USD, and CrossCore Embedded Studio $995 USD.

Other options include Green Hills Software&#x27;s MULTI IDE and the GNU GCC Toolchain for the Blackfin processor family. However, like VisualDSP++, these have not been updated to support the newer BF6xx and BF7xx processors. Moreover, neither support all BF5xx processors. Green Hills MULTI lacks support for BF50x, BF51x, some BF52x, BF547, and BF59x. GCC lacks support for BF50x, BF566, and BF59x, and has incomplete support for BF561.

Blackfin is also supported by National Instruments&#x27; LabVIEW Embedded Module, which requires VisualDSP++.

==Supported operating systems, RTOSs and kernels==

Several commercial and open-source operating systems support running on Blackfin.

Blackfin was previously supported by μClinux and later by Linux with the NOMMU feature, but as it was not ever widely used and no longer had a maintainer, support was removed from Linux on April 1, 2018; 4.16 was the last release to include Blackfin support.

<text>Canberra Airport is an international airport situated in the district of Majura, Australian Capital Territory. It serves Australia&#x27;s capital city, Canberra, as well as the nearby city of Queanbeyan and regional areas of the Australian Capital Territory and southeastern New South Wales. Located approximately from the city centre, within the North Canberra district, it is the ninth-busiest airport in Australia.

The airport has direct flights to all Australian state capitals, as well as to many regional centres across the Australian East coast, and international services to Nadi, Fiji. International flights have at various times operated from Canberra to Denpasar, Doha, Singapore and Wellington.

Canberra Airport handled 3.2 million passengers in the 2018–19 financial year. Major redevelopment work completed in 2013 included the demolition of the old terminal, replacing it with a new facility designed to handle up to eight million passengers annually.

In addition to serving airline traffic, the airport is also the only public general aviation facility within the Australian Capital Territory. As a former Royal Australian Air Force base, Defence Establishment Fairbairn is located within Canberra Airport and supports government VIP flying operations by 34 Squadron as well as ground handling for itinerant military aircraft and visiting heads of state.

==Corporate management==
The airport&#x27;s controlling entity is Capital Property Finance Pty Ltd, The airport is managed and operated by the Canberra Airport Group Pty Ltd. The current CEO of the airport and property group is Terry Snow&#x27;s step-son, Stephen Byron.

==History==
===Early years===

The airport was built up from an old airstrip that was first laid down in the 1920s, not long after the National Capital site was decided. In 1939 it was taken over by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), with an area leased out for civil aviation.

On 13 August 1940, in what became known as the Canberra air disaster, a RAAF Lockheed Hudson flying from Melbourne crashed into a small hill to the east of the airport. Four crew and six passengers, including the Chief of the General staff and three Federal Government ministers, were killed in the accident. James Fairbairn, Minister for Air and Civil Aviation, was one of those killed and Fairbairn Airbase, the eastern component of the airport, was subsequently named after him. In 1962 the military side of the airport was renamed RAAF Base Fairbairn. The north-east quadrant of the airport still retains the Fairbairn name.

The terminal facilities on the western side were upgraded in 1988. By 1994, Canberra Airport was the seventh busiest in Australia, handling 1.4 million passengers annually. Prior to privatisation, the Government of the Australian Capital Territory recommended further development of the airport as an international gateway, capable of limited widebody operations to destinations in South-East Asia and the Pacific region, but noted there was little appetite from Australian airlines to establish such services In May 1997, Canberra handled its first international flight when a charter for the ACT Brumbies to New Zealand was operated by a Qantas Boeing 737 with temporary immigration facilities set up. 

The Australian Government then leased the airport to Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd in May 1998 for 99 years, and the RAAF area was sub-leased back to the Department of Defence. It was decommissioned as a RAAF base in 2003, (although No. 34 Squadron RAAF remains based there), and the RAAF area was renamed Defence Establishment Fairbairn.

In July 2004, Air Pacific launched twice weekly services between Canberra and Nadi, the first direct scheduled International link; however, these flights proved unsuccessful, prompting further investment in facilities to support international operations. In 2006 the main runway was upgraded to cater for heavier aircraft, allowing visiting dignitaries and heads of state to fly direct to the capital.

The airport&#x27;s 2005 masterplan was criticised by the Federal government for not providing enough detail about planned expansion, while a further draft master plan was rejected by Federal Transport Minister Anthony Albanese in November 2008. The draft did not provide enough detail on a proposal to develop the airport into a freight hub, while that the airport&#x27;s community consultation had also been insufficient. In the second half of 2008, Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd started referring to itself as &quot;Canberra Airport&quot;.

===Redevelopment and international flights===
In early December 2007, plans were announced to construct a new terminal, to be completed by September 2010. This new terminal would have increased the number of aerobridges from two to six, doubled the number of check in counters and car parking and provided additional baggage processing capacity and lounge space. These plans were placed on hold in late 2008 due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

With financial outlooks improving, in April 2009, the airport announced that $350 million would be spent towards a new terminal and key infrastructure projects, including:
* three new jet aircraft parking positions and a total of ten aerobridges
* an increase in check-in counters from 17 to 44
* two multi-story car parks connected to the terminal
* a split-level roadside drop off and pick up system
* dedicated customs, immigration and quarantine facilities to support International flights
* an indoor taxi rank and waiting area – a first for an Australian airport
The terminal&#x27;s Southern concourse was completed in late 2010, while the Western concourse was partially open in March 2013 and complete by November of that year. Overall, floor space was increased by 65%, with significantly expanded baggage capacity and also expanded the airline lounges by four times compared to the previous building.

In November 2012, a national petition was started by 10-year-old Eve Cogan to name the new extensions after David Warren, inventor of the blackbox. The petition was supported by Sully Sullenberger.

In 2010, 8 Brindabella Circuit, a building located in the administration area of the Airport precinct, won the 5 Green Stars Australian Excellence Award.

In January 2016, Singapore Airlines announced it would launch flights from Singapore to Wellington via Canberra with Boeing 777-200ER aircraft, dubbed the &quot;Capital Express&quot; service. The ACT Government and Canberra Airport had been attempting for years to attract foreign airlines, or persuade Qantas or Virgin Australia to commence international flights from Canberra, with a population catchment of 900,000. The airport is underserviced compared to Adelaide which has 42 weekly international services with a population catchment only 25% larger. Canberra&#x27;s status as Australia&#x27;s capital city and the above average income of residents in the surrounding area provide arguments in favour of more international services at the airport. Qatar Airways began daily flights between Canberra and Doha, via Sydney, in February 2018. The product offering was upgraded in November 2019, replacing the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft used on the route with new Airbus A350-1000s

On 24 January 2018, Singapore Airlines announced that it was ending its Canberra to Wellington service on 30 April 2018, altering its Canberra operations to a daily Singapore-Sydney-Canberra-Singapore service from 1 May 2018 using the Boeing 777-300ER aircraft.

===COVID-19 pandemic===
Interstate travel restrictions as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic dramatically impacted operations at Canberra Airport. By August 2020, the airport reported a 99% reduction in passengers and closed the terminal on Saturdays as a cost saving measure, while management criticised State governments for enforcing border closures with the ACT, despite there being no active community transmission of the virus in the Territory. In September, Singapore Airlines announced the permanent suspension of its Canberra operations. Easing of travel restrictions in late September saw resumption and increased frequency on some interstate routes, avoiding further reduction to five days per week operations. This increased demand was followed by the announcement of several new leisure focussed, regional routes.

Canberra Airport received three one-off repatriation flights to bring home Australians stranded overseas, including a Qantas flight from New Delhi, a Nepal Airlines flight piloted by film star Vijaya Lama and a Singapore Airlines flight with 150 passengers.

On 17 July 2020, Qantas carried passengers on a scenic flight aboard its final Boeing 747 from Canberra Airport over the capital and surrounding region. The special flight, touted as a public farewell for the 747 long-haul fleet, had originally been planned over Melbourne, but it was changed to Canberra due to Victorian lockdowns. The aircraft performed low fly-pasts of the airport and the city landmarks.
Singapore Airlines and Qatar Airways cancelled their flights to Canberra in 2020 due to the pandemic. As of January 2023, Qatar had postponed the resumption of these flights on several occasions and there was no date for them to return. Singapore Airlines had also not announced a date by which it would resume servicing Canberra. The airport and ACT government have sought to attract flights to New Zealand without success.

===Post pandemic recovery===
In April 2023 Fiji Airways announced it would resume flights between Canberra and Nadi beginning July 2023, marking the return to international flights to Canberra. This was followed up with flights to Bali with Batik Air, which launched in June 2024 but were &quot;suspended&quot; until further notice in October 2024.

In May 2024, the airport unveiled their five-year Route Development Plan, outlining the Airport&#x27;s desire to resume services to Doha, Singapore and New Zealand, as well as to serve new destinations in China and Vietnam. Domestically, the Airport expects to resume services to Coffs Harbour, Townsville and Cairns, as well as start new services to Launceston and Geelong&#x27;s Avalon Airport. In July 2024, Qantas revealed they are interested in flying between Canberra and Singapore using a A321XLR aircraft.

==Facilities==

The Canberra Spatial Plan released by the ACT Government in March 2004 identified the airport and surrounding areas as being an important centre for future industrial and related development. The airport precinct is currently divided into four areas, catering to aviation and non-aviation activities:

*The passenger terminal and general aviation facilities are in the south western quadrant formed by runways 17/35 and 12/30. This area also contains long and short term parking and a four-star hotel.
*The Brindabella Business Park is south of the passenger terminal. A heavy maintenance facility for QantasLink Boeing 717 aircraft is located adjacent to the business park.
*Fairbairn, a former RAAF base is on the eastern side of the main runway. In addition to military and VIP aircraft operations, this area contains the Air Traffic Control tower, aircraft rescue and firefighting (ARFF) facilities and remote parking for visiting heavy aircraft and diverted passenger flights.
*A retail and mixed use area north of runway 12/30, on Majura Road which has been named Majura Park. Tenants include Majura Park Shopping Centre, Costco, IKEA, and some office buildings.

===Passenger terminals===
Before the airport&#x27;s redevelopment in 2009, there was a single building made up of two terminals. The former Qantas Terminal was located on the western side of the building. All Qantas and QantasLink flights and related services, such as lounges, now operate from the new Southern Concourse Terminal. The old terminal was demolished in 2011 to make way for the second Western Concourse Terminal.

The former Common User Terminal was located on the far eastern side of the building. The terminal served Virgin Australia and briefly Tigerair Australia. Also until 2001 the terminal was the home of Ansett Australia&#x27;s operations from the airport. However, after the construction of the new Southern Concourse, only the terminal&#x27;s departure lounge and gates 5 and 6 were in use. The Common User terminal was demolished in June 2013 after the opening of new Southern Concourse.

====Southern Concourse====
Construction of the Southern Concourse was completed in late 2010 and came into service on 14 November. Qantas uses its check-in counters and departure gates. The Southern Concourse also includes The Qantas Club, The Qantas Business Class Lounge and The Qantas chairman&#x27;s Lounge. The building&#x27;s two wings, the Southern Concourse and the Western Concourse, are separated by an atrium, the centrepiece of the terminal.

====Western Concourse====
The Western Concourse opened in March 2013 and conjoins onto the Southern Concourse Terminal. Virgin Australia uses its check-in counters and departure gates. The Western Concourse also includes the 300-seat Virgin Lounge and Virgin&#x27;s invitation-only The Club.

The western concourse was built with space for customs, immigration and quarantine facilities next to the Virgin lounge on the upper floor and on the ground floor. These areas were fitted out and opened when Singapore Airlines began its Canberra services to Wellington and Singapore. International flights arrive at and depart from gate 5.

====General Aviation Terminal====
The General Aviation Terminal in Canberra Airport is a small separate building located on the far west side of the Terminal Precinct. Brindabella Airlines had its head office and maintenance facility located near this terminal prior to the airline&#x27;s collapse in 2013.

==Airlines and destinations==

Qantas formerly operated dedicated &#x27;flightseeing&#x27; services over Antarctica from Canberra. These flights, which used a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, departed Canberra from the international/domestic terminal, and provided a guided aerial tour of Antarctica before returning to Australia. These flights were about thirteen hours in total.

Notes
==Controversies==
During the COVID-19 pandemic, Canberra Airport announced that runway 12/30 would be closed. As noted in the 2014 Canberra Airport Master plan, this runway is primarily used by general aviation and was considered by the Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association (AOPA) to be a thinly veiled attempt to unlock a larger area of the site for non-aviation purposes. There has also been a significant and ongoing criticism that the ongoing property development activities have been pursued to the detriment of aviation safety. For Canberra Airport, Airservices Australia has been obliged to put the following warning in its En Route Supplement Australia: &quot;During strong westerly winds TURB may be experienced in touch down area LDG RWY 35.&quot; Pilots have been warned of potential safety issues arising from turbulence caused by mostly non-aviation related development encroaching close to the runway. This development restricts the options available to pilots of smaller aircraft in an emergency.

==Second airport==
Canberra is the only capital city in Australia that does not have a secondary airport (with the exception of Darwin). In 1955, the Commonwealth Government recommended that a second airport be built to separate slower and smaller aircraft from much faster turboprop airliners as passenger traffic grew. In 2011, the ACT Government considered a proposal to develop a small airport on a site in Williamsdale, south of Canberra that would be support general aviation and emergency services users The Government declined to proceed after conducting a cost–benefit analysis that anticipated marginal returns on the required investment, despite demand for a secondary airport. The Canberra Regional Aviators Association formed in 2009 to advocate for a second airport. The association has criticised rising costs following the privatisation of Canberra Airport, pointing out that since 1997, many flying schools and maintenance providers ceasing to operate and far fewer light aircraft are based at the airport. They argue that establishment of a secondary airport will boost the city&#x27;s economy through the creation of maintenance and engineering jobs and provide facilities for Canberra&#x27;s universities to expand flight training programs.

==Advertising==
While billboards have been barred in Canberra since the 1930s, an amendment of the National Capital Plan in 2000 allowed them to be displayed at Canberra Airport. Subsequently, the airport has hosted advertisements promoting defence hardware. A community group said the airport should not be promoting weapons manufacturers. The airport defended the ads and said the airport would continue to accept defence industry advertising. In 2015 the airport was lit up in rainbow colours, and in 2017 electronic and 3D message boards were used to support marriage equality. In August 2017 Canberra Airport awarded Qatar Media Services (QMS) the concession for all internal and external advertising. The first advertising project will be a double-sided &quot;landmark digital billboard&quot;, being the only installation of this type in the ACT.

==Environment==
Approach and departure corridors lie over largely rural and industrial areas, although the instrument approach path (from the south) passes near the New South Wales suburb of Jerrabomberra, the city of Queanbeyan, and the Royal Australian Navy base, HMAS Harman, which has some barracks and housing.

Proposals have been made to the NSW Planning Minister by various developers to approve housing estates that are under the southern flight paths in New South Wales. Canberra International Airport Pty Ltd has been vigorous in advertising its opposition to these plans on the basis of a general increase in noise levels over a wide corridor which is currently free of aircraft noise, and concern that this will lead to the imposition of a curfew on the hours-of-operation of the airport.

==Ground transport==

Access to the city from the airport is via Morshead Drive and Parkes Way and Pialligo Avenue to Queanbeyan. A major junction, which connects the Majura Parkway and Monaro Highway with Canberra&#x27;s east-west arterial road network, is located adjacent to the airport. Travel time to Canberra from the airport is generally around 10 minutes. The road approaches to the airport and business parks have historically been prone to traffic congestion in peak times. In 2007, the Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope controversially attributed the congestion to the Federal Government permitting construction of office buildings on airport land. A report commissioned by the ACT Government, however, identified a range of factors contributing including population growth in Gungahlin and Queanbeyan and the expansion of the airport itself, calling for a staged approach to road improvements in the area. Major investment in upgrades aimed at improving access have progressively been completed since 2008 through joint funding from both Canberra Airport Group and the Government of the Australian Capital Territory.

Canberra Cabs and partner taxi companies provide services to the airport taxi rank. An enclosed waiting area was opened in November 2013, aiming to improve the experience for arriving passengers who would otherwise wait outside in Canberra&#x27;s relative climate extremes. Hire car companies maintain a presence in the terminal and Uber pick-up and drop offs are permitted with a $3 fee charged to drivers.

ACTION commenced operating services to Canberra Airport&#x27;s passenger terminal from the City Interchange with route 11 in 2017. Route 11 has since been replaced by route R3 to and from Spence. Canberra Airport Express provides daytime mini-bus services to Canberra City, connecting to regional and Interstate coach services at the West Row bus station. Other local bus services operate through the airport precinct and Brindabella Business park, but do not stop at the terminal including former ACTION route 792 (peak hours) to/from Woden and CDC Canberra route 834 to Queanbeyan (weekdays only).

On 10 February 2009, Canberra Airport released its preliminary draft master plan which announced that a high-speed rail link between Sydney, Canberra and Melbourne was being considered. The plan was shortlisted in December 2008 by Infrastructure Australia for further consideration; however, it was the most expensive project shortlisted, and has not attracted any funding from any government. The decision to build the Second Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek has made a fast rail link to Canberra Airport unlikely in the foreseeable future.

==Accidents and incidents==
* In October 2003, the runway was damaged by Air Force One, a Boeing VC-25, carrying President of the United States George Bush.
* On 12 August 2022, 63 year-old Ali Rachid Ammoun walked into the departures area at Canberra Airport, sat down and fired five rounds from a handgun into glass window panels. While nobody was hit by the gunshots, a number of people were injured during the panicked evacuation that immediately followed, many fearing a terrorist attack. Ammoun, who was on parole after serving a 14 year sentence for the attempted murder of his wife in Western Australia, surrendered to police and was taken into custody. The incident disrupted flights for several hours as the airport was shut down, with passengers not permitted to disembark from recently arrived flights. During his trial, Ammoun stated that he believed he had been wrongfully convicted and travelled to the capital to make a political statement to draw attention to this injustice. He said he deliberately fired only at the windows as he never intended to hurt anyone. After undergoing a psychological assessment, Ammoun was sentenced to three years in prison in March 2023.
* On 10 November 2022, a Link Airways Saab 340B, registered VH-VEQ operating on behalf of Virgin Australia as flight VA-633 from Canberra to Sydney made an emergency landing shortly after takeoff. A ratchet strap used to secure the left-hand propeller while the aircraft is on the ground was not removed by the crew before starting the engines. While accelerating on the runway, it penetrated the side of the fuselage into the passenger cabin as the aircraft became airborne. The aircraft landed safely seven minutes after departure and the airline reported no injuries to passengers. However, after landing the Australian Federal Police and Australian Transport Safety Bureau (ATSB) reported that between one and three passengers had sustained minor injuries. The ATSB classified the occurrence as a serious incident and opened an investigation, which subsequently confirmed one passenger was injured by debris that penetrated the cabin and identified four safety issues. These related to ground handling and flight preparation procedures by both Link Airways and contracted service provider Swissport. 
* On 2 November 2023, a woman was arrested by Australian Federal Police after having opened a secured door, and walked onto the tarmac in an attempt to flag down a QantasLink flight that she had missed boarding for. Flights were delayed 10 minutes and resumed after.

<doc id="1085692" wikidata="Q6423534" url="?curid=1085692" title="Knox College, Otago">
<text>Knox College is a selective residential college, founded and operated by the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand and affiliated with University of Otago in Dunedin, New Zealand. The college is set in a landscaped site in Opoho on the opposite side of the Dunedin Botanic Gardens from the university.

As the second oldest residential college in New Zealand, Knox is also one of the more traditional colleges, having been founded in the mould of those at Oxbridge. Throughout the last century, Knox managed to maintain much of its distinctively collegiate institutional character while continually evolving to promote and maintain a welcoming and inclusive academic community for its student body, which has been co-educational since 1983. The college has produced 18 Rhodes Scholars, as well as several Gates Scholars and Fulbright Scholars.

==History and function==
Knox College was established in 1909 to provide residence for male students and to house an existing seminary for Presbyterian ministers. It became co-educational in 1983. It also houses the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s Knox Centre for Ministry and Leadership and the Presbyterian Research Centre (comprising the Hewitson Library and Presbyterian Archives). The college is named after John Knox, a sixteenth century leader of the Scottish Reformation, whose efforts in establishing a universal system of free education comprising both academic learning and character formation had a profound influence, not just in Scotland, but internationally, as subsequent generations of Scottish settlers, products of the Scottish Enlightenment, emigrated to far-flung corners of the globe, including New Zealand, taking with them a deep-seated belief in the benefits of applied knowledge and a broad and liberal education.

Knox&#x27;s valuing of tradition is evident in some of the names and titles still used in the college. For example, the head of college is known as the Master, and the deputy head the Deputy Master; residential assistants are called Sub-masters; and the college has a ceremonial officer called the beadle. As of late 2022, the beadle is held by resident Ilaria Old, the 23nd beadle of Knox College.
Academic support for residents takes the form of tutorials, the monitoring of individual academic performances, and progress interviews as needed. In addition, the college benefits from an on-campus library, the Hewitson Library, which provides continuous access for students to study space and the library&#x27;s various collections of books and journals, some of which are of historical significance. Knox College counts among its alumni eighteen Rhodes Scholars.

Upon entry into Knox College, undergraduate residents become part of the Junior Common Room (JCR), which is distinct from the Senior Common Room (SCR). The latter largely consists of post-graduates, (non-resident) academics, and leading figures within the academic and ecclesiastical the community who are elected as fellows on a quinquennial basis. The list of College Fellows currently includes both the Chancellor and the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Otago. Other members of the SCR include postgraduate students in residence, including the Ross Fellow, and the college&#x27;s Sub-master team. The Ross Fellowship, established in 1920, is the oldest such award in the university.

Until the 1990s, certain Chairs in Theology were held at Knox College. These were disestablished when the University of Otago assumed responsibility (from the then Theological Hall) for teaching the university&#x27;s Theology programme.

The Visitor is the Moderator of the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand.

==Knox College Students&#x27; Club==
The Knox College Students&#x27; Club (KCSC) was an incorporated society and the oldest college organisation of its kind in New Zealand. The majority of student social events and intercollegiate events were organised through the KCSC Executive Committee, or student nominated club members, and used to form a broad range of activities throughout the year, including the annual Ball held at Larnach Castle, the Concert on the Stairwell, and the various sporting and cultural events that compose the Cameron Shield and Nevill Cup competitions against Selwyn College. The KCSC Executive consisted of a president, vice president, secretary, treasurer, cultural representative, male and female sports representative, and social representative.

Three former presidents of the Students&#x27; Club later became masters of Knox College: the Rev Dr Hubert Ryburn (KCSC president, 1921), the Rev Peter Marshall (1962) and Mr. Bruce Aitken (1971). Other notable names on the list of KCSC presidents are Professor Sir David Skegg (1969), who later served as vice-chancellor of the university (2004–11), Judge E.O.K. Blaikie (1967), and Mr Joel Amosa (2009), winner of New Zealand&#x27;s top singing prize, the Lexus Song Quest (2018).

A distinguishing characteristic of Knox, courtesy of it being independently owned, is the freedom it has to accept students back for a second, or even third, year. Students are not obliged to leave the college at the end of their first year. Returners play a role in setting the tone of the college, passing on traditions, and making incoming students feel welcome. In recent years, the male:female ratio has approximated 40:60, which is reflective of the male:female student ratio throughout the university.

In October 2023, the Knox College Students&#x27; Club ceased to exist after failing to meet quorum at the Annual General Meeting (AGM).

===Centennial celebrations===

The college achieved its centenary in 2009, with approximately 600 guests attending a variety of events over the celebration weekend in early August. The oldest returning resident (res. 1938–1943) planted a Centennial Oak in the college grounds to commemorate the occasion.

==Relationships with other colleges==
Knox College shares its site with Salmond College. Although the two colleges are mostly autonomous in regards to their daily operations, they are governed by the same body, the Board of Knox College and Salmond College, and, being part of the same organisation, they share several staff, including an Operations Manager, a Food Services Manager, a Property Manager and a Groundsman.

Knox College enjoys a close relationship with its Anglican equivalent and arch-rival Selwyn College. The two colleges compete annually for the Nevill Cup (cultural events) and Cameron Shield (sporting events). The eighth Master of Knox College, the Very Rev Dr Graham Redding (2015–2021), was a former Warden of Selwyn College (1989–1991).

==Building history==
The college buildings are an imposing group representing a persistent and successful effort to carry out an architectural idea over an extended time which saw considerable change.

===Initial outlay===
The Presbyterian Church of Otago and Southland opened a seminary for Ministers, its Theological Hall, in Dunedin in 1876. Early in the 20th century it acquired the core of the site in Opoho, above North East Valley, intending to re-house the seminary and to provide accommodation for its students and others attending the University of Otago. It established a brief and conducted an architectural competition won in 1906 by the 21-year old William Gray Young of Wellington. J. Louis Salmond (1868–1950) came second.
Young&#x27;s plans envisaged development well beyond the college&#x27;s immediate requirements taking the form of four ranges surrounding a central quadrangle. After the first stage was completed he was retained as architectural adviser and remained responsible for the buildings&#x27; design for more than forty years. His successors remained true to his conception through challenging circumstances.

The construction contract for the main accommodation block was won by Fletcher Brothers at a price of £9120. The chairman of the project was Rev Andrew Cameron and the contract winner was his son-in-law James Fletcher.

Because Young was based in Wellington and perhaps also because of his youth, Salmond was appointed supervising architect. The plan called for a principal range facing west with a large, square, central tower. It had subordinate ranges reaching forward at either extremity in a generally symmetrical composition. Behind the west range there were to be others at right angles to it, extending east, forming the north and south sides of the quadrangle.

The first building stage was the tower and the northward parts of the west range together with the range behind that trending east on the north side of the intended quadrangle (the &quot;North Wing&quot;). This part, the range on the north side of the quadrangle, included not only provision for teaching but a dining hall and servants&#x27; accommodation.
The foundation stone was laid on 6 April 1908 and the building was opened on 23 June 1909 having cost £19,307. The foundations were Port Chalmers breccia. The walls were finished in brick with Oamaru stone trims and the roofs were red clay tiles.

The building was in the Jacobethan style, a late form of the Gothic revival still vigorous in the early 20th century. Knox has the characteristic Tudor arches, oriel windows and battlements and the elaboration of forms and details, if not to the extent of Harlaxton Manor, sometimes pointed to as the type, or template, of the style.

===Early development===
The second stage was the southern part of the west range, including the forward projecting chapel. Behind this part of the west range the first part of the quadrangle&#x27;s southern range was also to be built. A tender was accepted in September 1912 and completed by March 1914. Construction had cost £10,525.

At this point the College Council&#x27;s ambitions and those of their architect were becoming clear. On their high site the buildings are very visible. The council had insisted on raising the architect&#x27;s four-storeyed tower to five storeys. The three storeyed ranges and the forward thrusting subordinate reaches present a complex, but legible and imposing face to the world.

The interiors were spacious and finished with period detailing, including panels and hammer beams in the Dining Hall and stained glass and elaborate plasterwork, notably in the chapel. Even so, the college, as Young had conceived it, was far from complete.

Plans to extend the southern range, known as the &quot;South Wing&quot;, were prepared by him in enough detail to be estimated by 1929 but the Depression and the Second World War prevented their execution. In 1952 with plans and funding almost complete the project was suspended.

===Post-war progress===
Meanwhile, the combination of seminary and residential hall was proving difficult to accommodate in the existing space. In 1945 a fund was established to provide additional room. Young was getting old. He oversaw the drafting of the plans but advised the committee of his resignation in 1952. Salmond had died in 1950. His son, Arthur Salmond, (1906–1994) now in partnership with Harry Burt, took over the project. A contract was signed in 1953, building commenced the next year and the new Theological Hall was opened on 12 November 1955 for a cost of £80,000.
The new building, to become known as the Hewitson Wing, was set parallel to the main west range, behind it, forming the east flank of the quadrangle. With a library as its front, facing the quadrangle, and with a hall behind, this structure is very deep. It is linked by an arch to the north range, closing the quadrangle&#x27;s corner at that point.

Building methods and codes had changed. This structure, the first of the second building phase, incorporated reinforced concrete while retaining the forms and materials of the earlier buildings. It too is decorated inside in period fashion, the library, for example, managing to make the reference to an Elizabethan interior with a plausible degree of conviction.

The former provision for the Theological Hall in the north range was now made into additional accommodation for residents. This meant the Dining Hall was now too small for the numbers. That had been anticipated in the Gray Young era but in 1953 the council commissioned Salmond &amp; Burt to prepare plans to extend the hall, estimated at £2,500. The work was completed by July 1957.

The extension reaches into the quadrangle courtyard, terminating in a crenellated bay window with stained lead lights. Inside it provides the space for the dais for the hall&#x27;s high table and seems a natural enlargement of the room.
In 1959 the College Council resumed its effort to extend the &quot;South Wing&quot;. Money was raised, the plans revised, tenders were called in August 1961. The building was opened on 21 April 1963 for a cost of £44,501. This was another structure with a reinforced concrete frame, styled and dressed to match the building it joined. It extended the &quot;South Wing&quot; eastward, taking the southern range to its present extent, further closing the quadrangle. It stopped short of the line of the east range which at that time had not reached its full extent. It was named the &quot;Ross Wing&quot;.

The quadrangle was still not completed and with the centennial of the Theological Hall approaching the College Council decided in August 1974 to mark it by extending the library. Fund raising was difficult but work began in August 1983. The extension was opened on 30 May 1984 for a cost of $463,000.

This is another structurally modern building dressed to complement the context. By this time Arthur Salmond had retired but his son John (1940–2008) was in practice. The addition extends the east range southwards, taking it to the line of the south range but leaving an open space between. With this the quadrangle was all but complete.

===Post-millennial contributions===
In 2008, the Hewitson Building was modified to house offices and teaching spaces for the newly formed Knox Centre for Ministry and Leadership (previously the School of Ministry), and to provide a purpose-built facility for the Presbyterian Archives.

In the summer of 2012–13, the main residential building was earthquake-strengthened to comply with the latest building code. At the same time, 40 rooms were added to the college. Some of these were the result of the reconfiguration of rooms and offices at the northern end of the ground floor of the main building; others were the result or rebuilding the area of the college known as The Close. Opportunity was also taken to refurbish the main building from top to bottom, and to open up the Great Hall to the Junior Common Room to facilitate dining for the increased numbers at the college on formal occasions. In the summer of 2019–2020, the area of the college known as Somerville Close, comprising Mackay, Marshall, Glendining and Wilson Houses, underwent an extensive refurbishment.

== Presbyterian Research Centre ==

Knox College is home to the Presbyterian Research Centre, located in the Hewitson Library. The centre was established in January 2013, following the merger of the Hewitson Library and the Presbyterian Archive, and is tasked with preserving the history and records of the Presbyterian Church in New Zealand. The collection has its origins in the Historical Records Committee, which was established in 1927 to ensure the survival of church records.

The Presbyterian Research Centre collections include archives of the General Assembly and General Assembly committees, records of Presbyterian youth and women&#x27;s organisations, local parishes, records of Knox College, and personal papers of prominent Presbyterian ministers and laypeople. Additionally, two archives held by the Presbyterian Research Centre have been inscribed on the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register: the Ng New Zealand Chinese Heritage Collection, and the PCANZ Deaconess Collection. The Ng New Zealand Chinese Heritage Collection was added to the register in November 2017, and includes material collected by historian James Ng from 1958 until the 2010s, documenting the early history of Chinese communities in New Zealand. Much of the collection also includes the records of Alexander Don, a late 19th century reverend who kept extensive notes on Chinese families in the South Island, in his attempt to convert Chinese goldmining communities to Christianity. The PCANZ Deaconess Collection was added in November 2018, and documents the history of the 175 Presbyterian women in New Zealand who became deaconesses between 1901 to 1975, during the period when the Presbyterian Church of New Zealand did not allow women to be ordained. The collection includes handwritten memoirs and personal effects of the deaconesses.

== Changes in governance and leadership ==
In February 2012, a commission was appointed by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand to assume responsibility for the governance and management of Knox and Salmond Colleges, instead of the Council of Knox College and Salmond College. The General Assembly took this action following two reviews of the college in 2011 – one by the University of Otago, and the other by the Presbyterian Church of Aotearoa New Zealand – each of which raised significant concerns about certain aspects of the culture of the college, especially in regards to alcohol and student welfare. The six-person commission comprised an equal number of church and university appointees. It saw numerous changes being put into effect immediately and other changes being proposed, some of which proved controversial among staff, students and alumni. The former master of the college, Bruce Aitken, offered his resignation on 20 July 2012. The protests of alumni attracted national press attention.

In 2015, the commission was discharged, and a new Board of Knox College and Salmond College was established to replace the former Council of Knox College and Salmond College. By that time, the Presbyterian Church&#x27;s Council of Assembly was satisfied that the commission had done its work, the management of change was complete, and the process of cultural change at Knox was well under way. In 2017, the board articulated its vision for Knox College: &quot;To be a world-class residential college where students are part of a community that affirms and empowers every resident, expands thought and outlook, encourages service, fosters leadership, and builds strong bonds of friendship.&quot;

The first female head of college, Caroline Hepburn-Doole, was appointed in 2021. She was the college&#x27;s deputy master for the previous five years.

== Controversy ==
In 2019, an article published in the Otago University Students&#x27; Association magazine, Critic Te Arohi, unveiled that the college had a culture of misogyny that normalised sexual misconduct against females. The article included the testimonies of several female residents who had been sexually harassed or assaulted at the college between 2015 and 2017, many of whom claimed that the college&#x27;s leadership ignored or dismissed their claims when they were reported to them. The article received widespread media attention.

==Notable alumni==

While many of those above have been resident at the college, some of those who attended as Divinity students may have received tuition while living in private accommodation.

For further details of on the alumni above, see the college&#x27;s centennial history. Years provided are of initial entry, rather than of any returning periods.

==Coat of arms==
The strong Scottish Presbyterian roots of Knox are reflected in its coat of arms, which takes the form of a blue St Andrew&#x27;s Cross; superimposed on the St Andrew&#x27;s Cross is the image of a white dove in flight, carrying an olive branch in its mouth, a symbolic depiction of the flood myth in Genesis 8, wherein the olive-branch-bearing dove is a symbol of life and peace. The college motto, &quot;Gratia et Veritas&quot; (Latin), or Grace and Truth (English), comes from the Prologue to the Gospel according to Saint John (John 1:).

<doc id="1085698" wikidata="Q3294058" url="?curid=1085698" title="The One with the Prom Video">
<text>&quot;The One with the Prom Video&quot; is the fourteenth episode of the second season, and the 38th episode overall, of the American television situation comedy &quot;Friends&quot;, which first aired on NBC on February 1, 1996. The episode focuses on the main characters watching Monica (Courteney Cox) and Rachel (Jennifer Aniston) getting ready for their high-school prom in the titular video. A subplot sees Joey (Matt LeBlanc) having increased income, buying roommate Chandler (Matthew Perry) an unusual gift.

The episode was directed by James Burrows and written by Alexa Junge and features guest stars Elliott Gould and Christina Pickles as Jack and Judy Geller, Michael Ray Bower as Monica&#x27;s date, and Patrick Kerr as the restaurant manager.

==Plot==
Joey, earning substantial money after landing a role on &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, gives Chandler a gaudy gold bracelet as thanks for paying for head shots and food in the past. Chandler mocks it when it scares off a potential date, upsetting Joey when he overhears. Chandler promises to never take it off again but discovers it slipped off his wrist at some point and is missing. He buys a replacement, but the original is found by Rachel shortly afterwards at Central Perk. He gives one to Joey, repairing their friendship.

Monica struggles to find a job after being fired. After a disastrous restaurant interview where the manager has a food play fetish, she relents to Ross&#x27; prodding to ask for money from their parents Jack and Judy, who have visited the apartment to bring boxes of her possessions. Though Judy is disappointed she was fired, Jack encourages her to use her savings from her bank account and assures her that they will be there to lend money to her whenever she needs it. Despite this encouragement, Ross ends up writing her a check.

Ross continues to seek forgiveness from Rachel after insulting her, but she tells him that they as a couple will never happen. Whilst looking through the box her parents brought, Monica finds a video of her and Rachel getting ready for their senior prom. The friends decide to watch the video, although Ross objects to everyone seeing the tape. On the video, Rachel&#x27;s date, Chip Matthews, has not arrived, and Monica refuses to go to the prom without her. Judy convinces Ross to wear Jack&#x27;s tuxedo and take Rachel to the prom himself. Ross reluctantly agrees, but by the time he is dressed and ready to go, Chip has arrived and the girls leave. The video ends with Ross looking disappointed and dejected. Rachel, touched by Ross&#x27; gesture, gets up and passionately kisses him, forgiving him for what happened between them.

Monica later watches the video alone which features her and Jack dancing before the prom. It suddenly cuts to Jack and Judy making love in bed, which disgusts her.

==Production==

The producers had kept Ross and Rachel from being together throughout the first season, eventually bringing them together in the second-season episode &quot;The One Where Ross Finds Out&quot;, only to split them up in the following episode. Writer Alexa Junge incorporated many of her own experiences into the script, in particular Phoebe&#x27;s line about Ross and Rachel being &quot;lobsters&quot;, something Junge&#x27;s husband once said. Aniston wore a false nose for the scenes in the video while Cox wore a &quot;fat suit&quot;. While a previous episode had already established Monica as being overweight as a child, this was the first on-screen appearance of &quot;Fat Monica&quot; (the fat suit made frequent return appearances). Rachel&#x27;s large nose was added because Junge believed that the characters &quot;were so good-looking, you wanted to feel they had some realness in their past&quot;.

At first, Schwimmer did not want to wear the afro wig and mustache because he thought he would look like Gabe Kaplan in &quot;Welcome Back, Kotter&quot; (a similarity referenced in the episode). He relented because it enabled him to &quot;tap into a part of himself that was very vulnerable and shy&quot; and incorporate it into his performance. An early script draft featured a scene in the prom video in which an episode of &quot;All My Children&quot; is on in the background. The scene was intended to feature the character &quot;Bryce&quot;, played by Gunther (as revealed in &quot;The One Where Eddie Won&#x27;t Go&quot;).

==Reception==
In 1997, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ranked this episode number 100 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Episodes of All Time&quot;.

&quot;The One with the Prom Video&quot; received acclaim from critics. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; rates the episode &quot;A&quot;, welcoming the return of Burrows as director and calling the prom video &quot;witty character development disguised as a standard flashback.&quot; The authors of &quot;Friends like Us: The Unofficial Guide to Friends&quot; write that it is &quot;a watershed in the history of the show&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s the sign of a good show that they can switch so effortlessly from comedy to pathos to romance in one short scene.&quot; Robert Bianco wrote in &quot;USA Today&quot; in 2004, &quot;If any one outing can take credit for moving Friends from good to great, it&#x27;s &quot;Prom Video&quot;&quot; and describes the resolution as an &quot;ingenious, unexpected twist.&quot;

The episode is popular among fans of the series. It appeared on one of the first region 1 &quot;best of&quot; DVD releases and is one of the two episodes to feature an audio commentary on the region 1 DVD release of the complete second season. In a poll conducted shortly before the series finale, &quot;The One with the Prom Video&quot; was voted the best episode of &quot;Friends&quot;, with 1.6 million people polling on the Internet. The episode is the favorite of Schwimmer, who liked the comedic and emotional origins of the Ross/Rachel relationship, as well as the exchange between Monica and Chandler as she defends her weight on the video.

In 2014, Gawker published a list of every episode of Friends ranked from No. 236 through No. 1. &quot;The One With The Prom Video&quot; was ranked as the No. 1 best episode on the list.

<text>&quot;Light My Fire&quot; is a song by the American rock band the Doors. Although it was principally written by the band&#x27;s guitarist, Robby Krieger, songwriting was credited to the entire band. Recognized as one of the earliest examples of psychedelic rock, it was recorded in August 1966 and released in January 1967 on their eponymous debut album. Due to its erotic lyrics and innovative structure, the track has come to be regarded as synonymous with the 1960s psychedelic and sexual revolutions.

Issued as an edited single on April 24, 1967, the song spent three weeks at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart; it re-entered the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1968 following the success of José Feliciano&#x27;s cover version (which charted at number three), peaking at number 87. The song also spent one week on the &quot;Cash Box&quot; Top 100, nearly a year after its recording. At the 11th Annual Grammy Awards in 1969, the cover by Feliciano won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Male Pop Vocal Performance. Feliciano also won the Grammy Award for Best New Artist.

==History==

&quot;Light My Fire&quot; originated in early 1966 as a composition by Robby Krieger, who said that he was inspired by the melody of &quot;Hey Joe&quot; and the lyrics of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;Play with Fire&quot;. On taking his initial composition to the band, John Densmore suggested that it should have more of a Latin rhythm, Jim Morrison wrote the second verse and part of the chorus (&quot;Try to set the night on fire&quot;), while Ray Manzarek added the Bach-influenced introductory organ motif; Densmore also suggested that it should open with a single snare drum hit.
The band started playing the song in performances in April 1966, and extended it with a jazzy improvisation. When the Doors performed the song at live concerts, Manzarek played the song&#x27;s bass line with his left hand on a Fender Rhodes Piano Bass, while performing the main keyboard lines on a Vox Continental using his right hand. When they came to record the song later in the year, producer Paul A. Rothchild brought in session musician Larry Knechtel to overdub a Fender Precision Bass guitar to double the keyboard bass line. Rothchild also suggested that the recording repeat the introductory motif at the end of the track.

Although the album version was just over seven minutes long, it was widely requested for radio play, notably by Los Angeles DJ Dave Diamond, and Elektra Records owner Jac Holzman asked that a shorter version be released as a single. Despite the band&#x27;s reluctance, Rothchild edited a single version, cut down to under three minutes with nearly all the instrumental break removed for airplay on AM radio.

===&quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;===
The band appeared on various TV shows, such as &quot;American Bandstand&quot;, miming to a playback of the single. &quot;Light My Fire&quot; was also performed live by the Doors on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; broadcast on September 17, 1967. The Doors were asked by producer Bob Precht, Ed Sullivan&#x27;s son-in-law, to change the line &quot;girl, we couldn&#x27;t get much higher&quot;, as the sponsors were uncomfortable with the possible reference to drugs. However, the meaning of the line was confirmed to be literal, as in &quot;high in the sky&quot;. The band agreed to do so, and did a rehearsal using the amended lyrics, &quot;girl, we couldn&#x27;t get much &quot;better&quot;&quot;. However, during the live performance, lead singer Jim Morrison sang the original, unaltered lyrics. Sullivan did not shake Morrison&#x27;s hand as he left the stage. The band had been negotiating a multi-episode deal with the producers; however, after violating the agreement not to perform the offending line, they were informed they would never perform on the show again. Morrison&#x27;s response was &quot;Hey man. We just &quot;did&quot; the Sullivan show.&quot;

This performance was portrayed in Oliver Stone&#x27;s 1991 biopic film, but with Morrison singing &quot;higher&quot; more emphatically and without his subsequent retort to Sullivan and the show&#x27;s producer.

===Buick TV commercial===
Drummer John Densmore recalled that Buick offered $75,000 in October 1968 to adapt the song for use in a Buick TV commercial (&quot;Come on, Buick, light my fire&quot;). Morrison, however, was still in London after a European tour had just ended on September 20, and could not be contacted by the other band members, who agreed to the deal in his absence. As the band had agreed in 1965 to both equal splits and everyone having veto power in decisions, Morrison consequently called Buick and threatened to personally smash a Buick with a sledgehammer on television, should the commercial be aired.

==Musical structure==
&quot;Light My Fire&quot; is notated in the key of A minor. Ray Manzarek&#x27;s keyboard playing descends from G to D Major, then goes to F and B-flat major; continuing onto the pitches of E-flat and A-flat major, before returning to the initial key of A Major. This alternation was based on Johann Bach&#x27;s &quot;Two and Three Part Inventions&quot;, but author Philip Clark has suggested that it may have been inspired by Dave Brubeck&#x27;s compositions. The extended solo arrangement is performed throughout the keys of A Minor and B Minor, the same chord progression used by John Coltrane on his cover version of &quot;My Favorite Things&quot;. According to Manzarek, the instrumental sections were an homage to John Coltrane whom the band admired. Parts of the solos are polyrhythmic. Some observers noticed baroque pop influences in the song.

===Speed discrepancy===
The 40th Anniversary mix of the debut album presents a stereo version of &quot;Light My Fire&quot; in speed-corrected form for the first time. The speed discrepancy (being about 3.5% slow) was brought to Bruce Botnick&#x27;s attention by Brigham Young University professor Michael Hicks, who noted that all video and audio live performances of the Doors performing the song, the sheet music, and statements of band members show the song in a key almost a half step higher (key of A) than the stereo LP release (key of A♭/G♯). Until the 2006 remasters, only the original 45 RPM singles (&quot;Light My Fire&quot; and &quot;Break On Through&quot;) were produced at the correct speed.

==Release and legacy==
A live version was released in 1983 on their live album &quot;Alive, She Cried&quot;, the first of several live albums released in subsequent decades to include the song. &quot;Light My Fire&quot; achieved modest success in Australia, where it peaked at number 22 on the ARIA chart. The single originally reached number 49 in the UK in 1967, but experienced belated success in that country in 1991, when a reissue peaked at number seven. This reissue was more successful in Ireland, peaking atop the IRMA chart for two weeks in June. The reissue occurred due to revived interest in the band following Oliver Stone&#x27;s film biopic &quot;The Doors&quot;.

The single was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America in September 1967 for exceeding one million units shipped. As of December 1971, it was the band&#x27;s best-selling single with over 927,000 copies sold.
It was also certified 2× Platinum by the RIAA in November 2024 for reaching 2,000,000 digital units. &quot;Billboard&quot; described the single as a &quot;top discotheque offering&quot; with an &quot;infectious beat&quot; that &quot;really grooves from start to finish.&quot; &quot;Cash Box&quot; called the single a &quot;potent, pounding foot-stomper with unlimited potential.&quot;

&quot;Light My Fire&quot; has been widely considered as the Doors&#x27; signature song, and a quintessential work of the psychedelic rock genre. In 2004 and 2010, the song was ranked at number 35 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;&#x27;s 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, then it was re-ranked at number 310 on the 2021 list. It was included in RIAA&#x27;s Songs of the Century list, at number 52. In 2014 &quot;NME&quot; ranked the song 199th in its 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list. Feliciano&#x27;s cover won the 1969 Grammy Award for Best Male Pop Vocal Performance, the same year he also won the Grammy for Best New Artist. In 1998, the track was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame under the category Rock (single). Artists such as Brian Wilson, Jean-Jacques Burnel, and Feliciano himself, among others, are admirers of the song.

The house on Alma Real Drive where Robby Krieger wrote &quot;Light My Fire&quot; was destroyed in the wildfires which devastated the Pacific Palisades in January 2025.

==José Feliciano version==
The Puerto Rican vocalist and guitarist José Feliciano enjoyed significant international success when he released his version of &quot;Light My Fire&quot; in 1968 as a single on the RCA Victor label. It is perhaps the best known cover of this song, peaking at number 3 on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 charts for the three consecutive weeks of August 31 and September 7 and 14, only a year after the original had been a number-one hit on the same chart. His version became the bigger hit in Australia and also in Canada, where it reached number one.

Feliciano&#x27;s remake blended Latin influences, including a mixture of classic Spanish guitar, and soul, with American pop. It contains &quot;proto-Latin rock&quot; stylings, and a slower tempo than the Doors original version. In a 1969 interview, Feliciano said that he liked the song when he first heard it, but felt that he should wait a year before releasing the song. He also said that &quot;California Dreamin&quot; was the original A-side of the single.

The single helped to spur the worldwide success of its album, &quot;Feliciano!&quot;, which was nominated for multiple Grammy Awards in 1969. Feliciano&#x27;s arrangement of &quot;Light My Fire&quot; has influenced several subsequent versions, including that by Will Young. Songwriter Robby Krieger said in an interview about the cover: &quot;It&#x27;s really a great feeling to have written a classic. I think I owe a big debt to Jose Feliciano because he is actually the one, when he did it, everybody started doing it. He did a whole different arrangement on it.&quot;

Feliciano revisited the song, performing a duet with Minnie Riperton on her 1979 album &quot;Minnie&quot;.

In 1979, Amii Stewart released a disco version of &quot;Light My Fire&quot;, together with a medley titled &quot;137 Disco Heaven&quot;. It was a big hit in the UK, where it reached No. 5, and a mild hit in West Germany, peaking at No. 26. In the U.S., the song peaked at No. 69 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and No. 36 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot Soul Singles chart.

It reached the top 10 in the UK a second time in 1985, in remixed form together with &quot;Knock on Wood/Ash 48&quot;. This release peaked at No. 7.

==Will Young version==

English singer and &quot;Pop Idol&quot; series 1 winner Will Young covered &quot;Light My Fire&quot; in 2002. He originally performed a piano version of the song in the final 50 of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, and again, with a backing track, in the final 10. A studio version, recorded in the style of Puerto Rican musician José Feliciano&#x27;s version, was later released as his second single. The song went straight to the number one spot in the UK Singles Chart, selling 177,000 copies in its first week of release, while staying at number one for two weeks. Young also performed the song on &quot;World Idol&quot;, where he came in fifth place.

<doc id="1085711" wikidata="Q492054" url="?curid=1085711" title="Unspecified feeding or eating disorder">
<text>Unspecified feeding or eating disorder (UFED) is a DSM-5 category of eating disorders that, along with other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED), replaced eating disorder not otherwise specified (EDNOS) in the DSM-IV-TR.

UFED is an eating disorder that does not meet the criteria for anorexia nervosa, bulimia nervosa, binge eating disorder, or other eating disorders. People with UFED can have similar symptoms and behaviors to those with anorexia and bulimia, and can face the same risks associated with those disorders.

== Signs and symptoms ==

UFED is a disorder that&#x27;s characterized by a disturbance or alteration in eating behaviors that leads to a significant impairment in physical or mental functioning, but cannot be defined under another specified feeding and eating disorder diagnosis. 

== Diagnosis ==

UFED is diagnosed when a clinician chooses not to specify the reason that criteria aren&#x27;t met for a specific eating and feeding disorder. This also includes situations where a clinician does not have sufficient information to make a specific diagnosis, such as an emergency room scenario. 

== Epidemiology ==
Although EDNOS (formerly called atypical eating disorder) was originally introduced in the DSM-III to capture unusual cases, it accounts for up to 60% of cases in eating disorder specialty clinics. EDNOS is an especially prevalent category in populations that have received inadequate research attention such as young children, males, ethnic minorities, and non-Western groups. 

== Treatment ==
When treating any eating disorder, including unspecified disorders, it is important to include a registered dietician or nutritionist working with the treatment team. Even though eating disorders are a psychological diagnosis, psychologists are not certified or licensed in dietetics or nutrition, so it is important that psychologists are not practicing outside their bounds of competence. Medical Nutrition Therapy is vital in the treatment and management of eating disorders. The dietician assists the patient by creating a meal plan that is tailored to their individual needs and treatment goals. The dietician will also provide psychoeducation that challenges nutrition misinformation and will ideally create a space where the patient feels comfortable asking questions.

<text>Demasduit ( 1796 – January 8, 1820) was a Beothuk woman, one of the last of her people on Newfoundland.

==Biography==
Demasduit was born around 1796, near the end of the 18th century. It was once believed that the Beothuk population had been decimated by conflict with European settlers. However, the most reliable research today suggests instead that the Beothuk population was very small, between 500 and 1,000 people at the time of European contact, and when European settlers arrived permanently, the Beothuk were cut off from their traditional coastal hunting grounds. Furthermore, there was no one to promote peaceful relations between the Beothuk and the settlers. As Newfoundland&#x27;s population was small, a missionary effort could not be supported, and the European governments were mainly interested in marine resources, so no agents were appointed to liaise with the native population. Further contributing to the Beothuk&#x27;s demise was the arrival of European diseases in North America.

In the fall of 1818, a small group of Beothuks had captured a boat and some fishing equipment near the mouth of the Exploits River. The governor of the colony, Sir Charles Hamilton, authorized an attempt to recover the stolen property. On March 1, 1819, John Peyton Jr. and eight armed men went up the Exploits River to Beothuk Lake in search of the Beothuks and their equipment. A dozen Beothuk fled the campsite, Demasduit among them. Bogged down in the snow, she exposed her breasts, a nursing mother, begging for mercy. Nonosabasut, her husband and the leader of the group, was killed while attempting to negotiate for Demasduit’s release. Her infant son died two days after she was taken.

Peyton and his men were absolved of the murder of Nonosabasut by a grand jury in St. John&#x27;s, the judge concluding that &quot;[there was] no malice on the part of Peyton&#x27;s party to get possession of any of [the Indians] by such violence as would occasion bloodshed&quot;.

Demasduit was taken to Twillingate and for a time lived with the Anglican priest there, Rev. John Leigh. He learned that she was also called Shendoreth and Waunathoake, but he renamed her Mary March, after the Virgin Mary and the month in which she was kidnapped. 
Demasduit was brought to St. John&#x27;s and spent much of the spring of 1819 in St. John&#x27;s, brought there by Leigh and John Peyton Jr. While there, Lady Hamilton painted her portrait.

During the summer of 1819, a number of attempts were made to return her to her people, without success. Captain David Buchan was to go overland to Beothuk Lake with Demasduit in November, the people of St. John&#x27;s and Notre Dame Bay having raised the money to return the Beothuk to her home. However, she was taken ill and died of tuberculosis at Ship Cove (now Botwood) aboard Buchan&#x27;s vessel &quot;Grasshopper&quot;, on 8 January 1820. Her body was left in a coffin on the lakeshore, where it was found by members of her tribe and returned to her village in February. Demasduit’s body was initially placed in a burial hut beside her husband and child, before her remains and her husband&#x27;s were later removed by William Cormack and brought to Scotland, where eventually their remains were held in the National Museum of Scotland.

There were only thirty-one of the Beothuk remaining at that time.

==Legacy==
In 2020, the remains of Demasduit and her husband Nonosabasut were repatriated from Scotland after years of advocacy. Chief Mi&#x27;sel Joe of the Miawpukek First Nation in Conne River first began the push for repatriation in 2015, and he was joined by other Indigenous leaders. Premier of Newfoundland and Labrador Dwight Ball and Heritage Minister Mélanie Joly made formal requests to National Museums Scotland in 2016, with Ball crediting Chief Mi&#x27;sel Joe specifically for beginning the process by bringing the issue to public attention. Their remains had been in Scotland for 191 years when they were returned to Newfoundland and were stored at The Rooms, a provincial museum and archive in St. John&#x27;s. This return was praised and recognized by Canadian politicians including Premier Ball and Minister of Canadian Heritage Steven Guilbeault, as well as by leaders from the Miawpukek First Nation, Innu Nation, Nunatsiavut, NunatuKavut, and Qalipu First Nation. In 2022, CBC News reported that the government of Newfoundland and Labrador was planning a new cultural centre at Beothuk Lake to serve as a final resting place for the remains.

Demasduit&#x27;s niece, a young woman named Shanawdithit (1801–1829), was the last known Beothuk.

The song &quot;Demasduit Dream&quot;, recorded by Newfoundland band Great Big Sea, is named after Demasduit and alludes to her life and capture.

The Demasduit Regional Museum, formerly known as the Mary March Provincial Museum, in the town of Grand Falls-Windsor, Newfoundland and Labrador, is named after her. The museum&#x27;s exhibits &quot;look at the history of the Beothuk, early European settlers, and the stories of a thriving, vibrant Mi’kmaq population in this area.&quot; In May 2006, a group of local grade 2 students, led by student Conor O&#x27;Driscoll, helped collect more than 500 signatures on a petition to rename the museum to Demasduit&#x27;s original identity, rather than the name she was given after her capture. The director of The Rooms, which owns and operates in the museum, announced in December 2021, that they would rename it using Demasduit&#x27;s original name rather than Mary March. They considered multiple options for renaming the museum, including the Demasduit Regional Interpretation Centre, before deciding on the new name of Demasduit Regional Museum.

In November of 2022, the governments of Canada and Newfoundland and Labrador announced plans for a commemoration project recognizing 200 years since the death of Demasduit. The project was delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The plans include a bronze statue of Demasduit, Nonosabasut, and their child, as well as a surrounding healing garden, to be located in Botwood. Funding from this project was contributed by the federal and provincial governments through the Department of Canadian Heritage, as well as additional funding from the Town of Botwood, Miawpukek First Nation, Botwood Heritage Society, Botwood Mural Arts Society and the United Church of Canada.

==Genetic testing==
In 2007, DNA testing was conducted on material from the teeth of Demasduit and her husband Nonosabasut. The results assigned them to Haplogroup X (mtDNA) and Haplogroup C (mtDNA), respectively, which are also found in current Mi&#x27;kmaq populations in Newfoundland.

<text>William Gray Young (21 June 1885 – 21 April 1962) was a New Zealand architect in the early 20th century, designing buildings such as Knox College in Dunedin, the Wellington railway station and Wellington&#x27;s Elliott House. He was president of the New Zealand Institute of Architects from 1935 to 1937.

==Life==

Born in Oamaru, the son of a Scottish watchmaker and jewellery retailer, he moved with his family to Wellington in the 1890s. He attended the Terrace School and Wellington College, and went on to be articled to the architects Crichton and McKay. He won the competition for Knox College in Dunedin in 1906 when he was only 21 and became an associate of the New Zealand Institute of Architects (NZIA) in 1907.

Prior to the First World War, he worked in collaboration with Stanley Fearn and Austin Quick. Gray Young and his partners designed and oversaw the construction of an average of six houses a year between 1907 and 1962.

He was judged unfit for military service in the First World War and continued in practice through it. With John Swan he designed Wellington Technical College in 1919. The same year his Scots College building was opened and in 1928 the Wellesley Club which earned him the NZIA gold medal. He designed the new Wellington railway station in 1930.

Gray Young was one of the architects invited to work with the government architect designing the prototype state house. He designed a new railway station for Christchurch in 1938 but it was not built until 1960. He also designed the Easterfield building at Victoria University of Wellington in 1951.

As architectural adviser to Knox College, Gray Young presided over its slow elaboration until 1952. Later architects continued to work to realise and elaborate his original idea for decades after his death, an unusual outcome in New Zealand, even for a highly emblematic building.

He was elected a Fellow of the New Zealand Institute of Architects in 1913, served on the executive committee from 1914 to 1935 and was its president from 1935 to 1937. In 1935, he was awarded the King George V Silver Jubilee Medal.

He was president of the Wellington Rotary Club from 1935 to 1936 but did not care for public life, preferring the company of colleagues and a group of yachting friends. He died in Wellington in April 1962.

<doc id="1085722" wikidata="Q1342264" url="?curid=1085722" title="Virgil Donati">
<text>Virgil Donati (born 22 October 1958) is an Australian drummer, composer and producer. He holds the drum sticks in the traditional style and is also proficient at the keyboard. Donati formed Planet X with Derek Sherinian and was the band&#x27;s principal composer on all their albums. He also performed in Melbourne with Jack Jones (Irwin Thomas) in a Van Halen tribute band known as Hans Valen before inviting Jones into Donati&#x27;s own bands The State and Southern Sons. Donati is widely regarded as one of the most technically advanced drummers of all time.

==Early life and career==
Virgil Donati was born in Melbourne, Victoria of Italian descent. He got his first drumset at age 2. He started playing soon after with his father&#x27;s showband, and kept on doing these shows until he was around 6 years old. At age 6 he started taking piano lessons. He joined his first major rock band and signed with his first major record label at the age of 15. The band was first called &quot;Cloud Nine&quot;, but was later renamed Taste, with whom he recorded 3 albums. Soon after at age 16, Donati left school focusing mainly on the drums, but also piano. At age 19 Donati travelled to the U.S. to study with Philly Joe Jones, and at Dick Groves School in Los Angeles. He also took lessons from snare drum specialist Murray Spivack and Rob Carson.

==Success and bands==
Donati returned to Australia at the age of 21. He then performed jazz with Allan Zavod and Brian Brown, and played with Peter Cupples&#x27; band. Before moving to Los Angeles, Donati furthered his success by performing with the likes of Tommy Emmanuel, Tina Arena, Jon Stevens and visiting international acts like Melissa Etheridge, Branford Marsalis, and Tribal Tech. Virgil also recorded and toured with his own bands Southern Sons, Loose Change and On The Virg. From the late 1990s and onwards Donati recorded and toured with acts like Derek Sherinian (with whom he formed the progressive fusion outfit Planet X), Steve Vai, Allan Holdsworth, Michel Polnareff and Soul SirkUS. In 2024, he is touring with Asia.

===Influences===
With his father&#x27;s choice of records, including Louie Bellson and Buddy Rich albums, Donati quickly became a fan of those great jazz drummers, trying to emulate their solos. The first rock drummer to make a big impact on him was Ian Paice of Deep Purple. Donati said, &quot;I was blown away with his playing, his clarity. Back in the early &#x27;70s he seemed to be an articulate drummer with a lot of soul in his playing. I loved his power and strength and the way he articulated his phrasing. I loved his approach.&quot; In a &quot;Modern Drummer&quot; magazine article of June 1999, Donati prefers playing with traditional grip. He says there, &quot;I grew up playing traditional grip and persevered with it even under the physical duress of rock bands. I decided that it&#x27;s just how I wanted to play. Now it&#x27;s very natural for me. Besides, I&#x27;ve surmounted all the problems of being able to play with enough power. Traditional grip does not limit me in any way. There are certain movements around the drumset that feel good with traditional, and believe it or not, there&#x27;re certain things I&#x27;ll play that feel better in my left hand than in my right. That said, I would not necessarily recommend traditional grip. Frankly, I think the disadvantages involved with traditional grip outweigh the advantages. It is a far more difficult grip to maintain and to develop power with. Any student starting out would be better off focusing on matched. But for some reason, maybe just because it isn&#x27;t used as much anymore, traditional grip seems to be more hip.&quot;

=== Reception ===
Virgil Donati is widely regarded as one of the most technically advanced drummers of all time. Bassist Bryan Beller, after performing with Donati and Mike Keneally, described him in a blog post with the following words: &quot;Imagine the technical accuracy of Mike Mangini, the off-the-rails phrasing of Vinnie Colaiuta, the beat-displacement of Dave Weckl, and the rock sensibility of Tommy Aldridge, and that&#x27;s pretty much Virgil Donati—all of it, all at once, all the time. Talk about being taken along for a ride&quot;. Dream Theater drummer Mike Portnoy called Donati &quot;super, super technical&quot; and cited him as a drummer he &quot;can&#x27;t replicate&quot;, saying that &quot;[he] does things that I physically can&#x27;t do.&quot;

Donati&#x27;s piano playing can be heard on his 2016 album &#x27;The Dawn of Time&#x27; as well as in various online videos where he&#x27;s playing the like of Debussy and Ravel.

<doc id="1085726" wikidata="Q3156744" url="?curid=1085726" title="J. D. Beresford">
<text>John Davys Beresford (17 March 1873 – 2 February 1947) was an English writer, now remembered mainly for his early science fiction and some short stories of the horror story and ghost story genres. Beresford was a great admirer of H. G. Wells, and wrote the first critical study of Wells in 1915. His Wellsian novel &quot;The Hampdenshire Wonder&quot; (1911) was a major influence for the author Olaf Stapledon. His other science-fiction novels include &quot;The Riddle of the Tower&quot;, about a dystopian, hive-like society.

==Life==
His father, John James Beresford (1821 – 1897), was a clergyman in Castor, now in Cambridgeshire near Peterborough. His mother was Adelaide Elizabeth Morgan (1837 – 1902). J. D. Beresford was affected by infantile paralysis, which left him partially disabled. He was educated at Oundle.

After training to become an architect, he became a professional writer, first as a dramatist, and journalist. During early adulthood, he rejected his father&#x27;s theism and became a &quot;determined but defensive&quot; agnostic. In 1903 Beresford read the book &quot;Human Personality and Its Survival of Bodily Death&quot; by the psychical researcher Frederic W. H. Myers, which Beresford later stated had an enormous influence on his thought. He combined a life in Edwardian literary London with time spent in the provinces, in particular Cornwall, where D. H. Lawrence had an extended stay in his Porthcothan cottage. During the period around the First World War Beresford befriended several British writers, including Dorothy Richardson, Walter de la Mare, Naomi Royde-Smith and May Sinclair. Later in life Beresford abandoned his earlier agnosticism and described himself as a Theosophist and a pacifist.

Beresford was also interested in psychology, and attended several meetings organised by Alfred Richard Orage to discuss psychological issues. Other attendees at these meetings included Havelock Ellis, Clifford Sharp, David Eder and Maurice Nicoll.

Beresford also contributed to numerous publications; in addition to being a book reviewer for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot;, he also wrote for the &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;The Spectator&quot;, &quot;Westminster Gazette&quot;, and the Theosophist magazine &quot;The Aryan Path&quot;. At one time, Beresford was offered the editorship of the pacifist magazine &quot;Peace News&quot; but refused because he claimed he &quot;would be a bad editor&quot;.

Beresford&#x27;s interest with spiritualism and philosophy may be illustrated best by the publisher&#x27;s notes to his novel, &quot;On A Huge Hill&quot;:

&quot;Mr Beresford&#x27;s readers have long known that that for him there are more things in heaven or earth than are dreamt of in official medical philosophy. He has used his novelist&#x27;s skill to convince the sensitive reader that the age of miracles is not over, and that, in certain circumstances, the spirit may exercise what seem to us miraculous powers over the substance of the body. This he did in &#x27;The Camberwell Miracle&#x27; and &#x27;Peckover&#x27;; and in this absorbing novel, he returns to the theme, with the study of a man fitting himself to become a great healer.&quot;

Elisabeth Beresford (1926–2010), children&#x27;s writer and creator of The Wombles, was his daughter. Through his son, writer Marc Brandel (Marcus Beresford), he is the great-grandfather of American actors Griffin Newman and James Newman.

He was married twice, first to Florence Linda Brown (1870 – 1916) and then to Eveline &quot;Trissy&quot; Beatrice Auford Roskams (1880 – 1975)

==Reception and influence==
Upon publication in 1911, &quot;The Hampdenshire Wonder&quot; was lauded by George Bernard Shaw.

Reviewing Beresford&#x27;s novel 1921 &quot;Revolution&quot;, Virginia Woolf criticised the novel&#x27;s characterisations, but praised its &quot;intellectual efficiency&quot;.
In 1924, the French writer Abel Chevalley lauded Beresford as a writer &quot; most equally endowed with that intelligence and that imagination of life which make good writers of fiction.&quot;

Dorothy L. Sayers quotes from Beresford&#x27;s book &quot;Writing Aloud&quot; in her book on theology, &quot;Mind of the Maker&quot; ;Sayers calls &quot;Writing Aloud&quot; &quot;an extraordinarily fascinating book.&quot; She also mentions him in passing in &quot;Whose Body?&quot;.

John Betjeman, reviewing &quot;The Riddle of the Tower&quot; for the &quot;Daily Herald&quot;, called the book &quot;a great feat of the imagination.&quot;

George Orwell in 1945 described him as a &quot;natural novelist&quot;, whose strength, particularly in &quot;A Candidate For Truth&quot;, was his ability to take seriously the problems of ordinary people.

In 1971 Graham Greene wrote that &quot;&quot;The Hampdenshire Wonder&quot; remains one of the finest and most neglected novels of this period between the great wars.&quot;

<text>Frederick IV (1382 – 24 June 1439), also known as Frederick of the Empty Pockets (), a member of the House of Habsburg, was Duke of Austria from 1402 until his death. As a scion of the Habsburg Leopoldian line, he ruled over Further Austria and the County of Tyrol from 1406 onwards.

==Biography==
Frederick was the youngest son of Duke Leopold III (1351–1386) and his wife Viridis (d. 1414), a daughter of Bernabò Visconti, Lord of Milan. According to the 1379 Treaty of Neuberg, his father ruled over the Habsburg Inner Austrian territories of Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, as well as over Tyrol and the dynasty&#x27;s original Further Austrian possessions in Swabia. After the early death of Duke Leopold in the 1386 Battle of Sempach, Frederick and his elder brothers William, Leopold IV and Ernest initially remained under the tutelage of their uncle Duke Albert III of Austria.

As an inheritance dispute arose upon Duke Albert&#x27;s death in 1395, the young Leopoldian dukes insisted on their rights: the next year, William went on to rule the Inner Austrian lands and Leopold IV ascended as Count of Tyrol. When Frederick came of age in 1402, he was formally assigned to administer his father&#x27;s inheritance in the scattered Habsburg territories in Swabia, referred to collectively as Further Austria (&quot;Vorderösterreich&quot;) and took his residence in Freiburg im Breisgau. Another division of the Leopoldian territories took place after William&#x27; death in 1406: Duke Leopold IV, now eldest heir, ceded Tyrol to Frederick; however, he did not become sole ruler in Further Austria until Leopold&#x27;s death in 1411. 

The early years of Frederick&#x27;s reign were marked by external and internal conflicts. He had to overcome the opposition of Tyrolean nobles (who gave him the title &quot;of the Empty Pockets&quot;) in 1406/1407 and a rebellion in the Bishopric of Trent. He also had to deal with the independence movement in the Swabian Appenzell lands, where the conflict with the Prince-Abbots of St Gall had escalated in 1401, sparking the Appenzell Wars. Frederick had to withstand in a series of longstanding military conflicts, until a peace was concluded in 1410. However, the Appenzell area became a protectorate of the Old Swiss Confederacy in 1411. Back in Tyrol, he had to face the invading forces of Duke Stephen III of Bavaria, whom he defeated in the Lower Inn Valley.

Upon the death of Duke Leopold IV in 1411, the surviving younger brothers Frederick and Ernest again divided the Leopoldian possessions. With Further Austria, Frederick became undisputed ruler over the Habsburg territories in the Alsace region and of the Burgau margraviate. In 1417 he also inherited the former Kyburg estates from the extinct comital Habsburg-Laufenburg branch. Several border conflicts with the Republic of Venice led to the loss of Rovereto in the Lagarina Valley.

Under the terms of the Western Schism, Duke Frederick sided with Antipope John XXIII, whom he helped on his flight from the Council of Constance in March 1415. The Luxembourg king Sigismund had John arrested in Breisgau and placed Frederick under the Imperial ban. Thanks to the support of the local populace he managed to keep Tyrol, though he lost the western Aargau, the Freiamt and County of Baden estates, in the old homeland of the Habsburgs, to the Swiss.
In 1420, Frederick also moved his Tyrolean court from Meran to Innsbruck. After several rebellions by local nobles, his rule over Tyrol had stabilized, partially due to the successful beginning of silver mining that brought an increase in prosperity to the region. After the death of his brother Ernest on 10 June 1424, Duke Frederick also took over the regency over Inner Austria for his minor nephews Frederick V (the later Emperor Frederick III) and Albert VI. In his later years, however, he again had to cope with another rebellion against his Tyrolean rule, instigated by Prince-Bishop Alexander of Trent.

Frederick died at his court in Innsbruck, despite his nickname, a rich man. His son and heir Sigismund was called &quot;der Münzreiche&quot; (&quot;Rich in Coin&quot;). Frederick was buried in the Cistercian abbey of Stams, Tyrol.

==Marriage and issue==

On 24 December 1407, Frederick married Elizabeth of the Palatinate (1381–1408), daughter of King Rupert of Germany, in Innsbruck. They had one daughter, Elizabeth, but both mother and child died shortly after the birth on 27 December 1408.

On 11 June 1411, Frederick married Anna (d. 1432), daughter of the Welf duke Frederick I of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel; they had:
* Margaret (14231424)
* Hedwig (14241427)
* Wolfgang (1426)
* Sigismund (14271496).
Only Sigismund survived until adulthood. He succeeded his father in Tyrol and Further Austria.

<doc id="1085743" wikidata="Q5422235" url="?curid=1085743" title="Extraordinary general meeting">
<text>An extraordinary general meeting, commonly abbreviated as EGM, is a meeting of members of an organisation, shareholders of a company, or employees of an official body that occurs at an irregular time.&quot;&quot; The term is usually used where the group would ordinarily hold an annual general meeting (AGM) but where an issue arises that requires the input of the entire membership and is too serious or urgent to wait until the next AGM. Members and/or shareholders must be informed of the purpose of the EGM so that they may attend in a position where they can discuss and exercise intelligent judgment, or else any resolutions passed are invalid.&quot;&quot;

==Procedure==

Before the EGM the board of the organisation will have agreed upon one or more resolutions that will be put to the shareholders or members for approval at the EGM. The wording of the resolution is sent to the shareholders with a note about its importance. The theory is that the board has a better knowledge of the situation, and the resolution is in effect their ideal solution, but it may not be in the interests of individual shareholders. Usually, the chairman of the EGM reads out and recommends the resolution to those present for approval, takes questions about the resolution from those present, supervises the vote and declares the result. The rules for conducting an EGM and the options for altering a resolution at an EGM or for taking proxy votes will vary from one organisation to another.

In some settings, this is known as a special general meeting or an emergency general meeting.

In the United Kingdom, the directors of a public company must convene an EGM if the net assets fall to half or less of the amount of its called-up share capital (section 656 of the Companies Act 2006). Shareholders who meet certain criteria can requisition a general meeting: within 21 days from the date of receipt of requisition, the directors must send out a notice to convene a meeting within 28 days after the date of giving the notice.

<doc id="1085764" wikidata="Q812889" url="?curid=1085764" title="Beacon Hill, Boston">
<text>Beacon Hill is a historic neighborhood in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is also the location of the Massachusetts State House. The term &quot;Beacon Hill&quot; is used locally as a metonym to refer to the state government or the legislature itself, much like Washington, D.C.&#x27;s Capitol Hill does at the federal level.

Federal-style rowhouses, narrow gaslit streets and brick sidewalks run through the neighborhood, which is generally regarded as one of the more desirable and expensive in Boston. As of the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of Boston&#x27;s Beacon Hill neighborhood was 9,023.
==Etymology==

Like many similarly named areas, the neighborhood is named for the location of a former beacon atop the highest point in central Boston. The beacon was used to warn the residents of an invasion.

==Geography==
Beacon Hill is bounded by Storrow Drive, and Cambridge, Bowdoin, Park and Beacon Streets. It is about 1/6 of a square mile in size, and situated along the riverfront of the Charles River Esplanade to the west, just north of Boston Common and the Boston Public Garden. The block bound by Beacon, Tremont and Park Streets is included as well. Beacon Hill has three sections: the south slope, the north slope and the &quot;Flat of the Hill&quot;, which is a level neighborhood built on landfill, located west of Charles Street and between Beacon and Cambridge streets.

Located in the center of the Shawmut Peninsula, the area originally had three hills, Beacon Hill and two others nearby, Pemberton Hill and Mount Vernon, which were leveled for Beacon Hill&#x27;s development. The name trimount later morphed into &quot;Tremont&quot;, as in Tremont Street.

Between 1807 and 1832, Beacon Hill was reduced from 138 feet in elevation to 80 feet. The shoreline and bodies of water such as the Mill Pond had a &quot;massive filling&quot;, increasing Boston&#x27;s land mass by 150%. Charles Street was one of the new roads created from the project.

Before the hill was reduced substantially, Beacon Hill was located just behind the current site of Massachusetts State House.

==Demographics==
According to the 2010 U.S. Census, the population of Boston&#x27;s Beacon Hill neighborhood is 9,023. This reflects a slight (0.3% or 29 individuals) decrease from the 2000 Census. The racial/ethnic make-up of the neighborhood&#x27;s population is as follows: 86.8% of the population is white, 2% black or African American, 4.1% Hispanic or Latino, 0.1% American Indian or Alaska Native, 5.3% Asian, 0.4% some other race/ethnicity, and 1.3% two or more races/ethnicities.

According to 2007–2011 American Community Survey estimates, of the 5,411 households in Beacon Hill, 27.3% were family households and 72.7 were non-family households (with 55.7% of those female householders). Of the 1,479 family households 81.6% were married couple families. 36.6% of married couple families were with related children under the age of 18 and 63.4% were with no related children under age 18. Other family types make up 18.4% of Beacon Hill&#x27;s population, with 90.8% being female householders with no husband present and a majority of these households included children under 18 present.

===Ancestry===
According to the 2012–2016 American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates, the largest ancestry groups in ZIP Codes 02108 and 02114 are:

==History==
===17th century===
The first European settler was William Blaxton, also spelled Blackstone. In 1625 he built a house and orchard on Beacon Hill&#x27;s south slope, roughly at the location of Beacon and Spruce street. The settlement was a &quot;preformal arrangement&quot;. In 1630 Boston was settled by the Massachusetts Bay Company. The southwestern slope was used by the city for military drills and livestock grazing. In 1634 a signal beacon was established on the top of the hill. Sailors and British soldiers visited the north slope of Beacon Hill during the 17th and 18th centuries. As a result, it became an &quot;undesirable&quot; area for Boston residents. &quot;Fringe activities&quot; occurred on &quot;Mount Whoredom&quot;, the backslope of Beacon Hill.

===18th century===
Beacon Street was established in 1708 from a cow path to the Boston Common. John Singleton Copley owned land on the south slope for pasture for his cows and farmland.

In 1787 Charles Bulfinch designed the Massachusetts State House. Its construction was completed in 1795, replacing the Old State House in the center of Boston.

The Mount Vernon Proprietors group was formed to develop the trimount area, The name trimount later morphed into &quot;Tremont&quot;, as in Tremont Street. when by 1780 the city&#x27;s neighborhoods could no longer meet the needs of the growing number of residents. Eighteen and a half or 19 acres of grassland west of the State House was purchased in 1795, most of it from John Singleton Copley. The Beacon Hill district&#x27;s development began when Charles Bulfinch, an architect and planner, laid out the plan for the neighborhood. Four years later the hills were leveled, Mount Vernon Street was laid, and mansions were built along it. One of the first homes was the Harrison Gray Otis House on Cambridge Street.

===19th century===

====Development====
Construction of homes began in earnest at the turn of the century, such as: freestanding mansions, symmetrical pairs of houses, and row houses. Between 1803 and 1805, the first row houses were built for Stephen Higginson.

In the 1830s, residential homes were built for wealthy people on Chestnut and Mt. Vernon Streets. Some affluent people moved, beginning in the 1870s, to Back Bay with its &quot;French-inspired boulevards and mansard-roofed houses that were larger, lighter, and airier than the denser Beacon Hill.&quot;

In the early 19th century, there were &quot;fringe activities&quot; along the Back Bay waterfront, with ropewalks along Beacon and Charles Streets.

====South slope====
The south slope &quot;became the seat of Boston wealth and power.&quot; It was carefully planned for people who left densely populated areas, like the North End. The residents of opulent homes, called the Boston Brahmins, were described by Oliver Wendell Holmes as a &quot;harmless, inoffensive, untitled aristocracy&quot;. They had &quot;houses by Charles Bulfinch, their monopoly on Beacon Street, their ancestral portraits and Chinese porcelains, humanitarianism, Unitarian faith in the march of the mind, Yankee shrewdness, and New England exclusiveness.&quot;

Literary salons and publishing houses were founded in the 19th century. &quot;Great thinkers&quot; lived in the neighborhood, including Daniel Webster, Henry Thoreau and Wendell Phillips.

====Flat of the Hill====
Development began in the early 19th century. Single family homes often had stores on the first floor for retailers, carpenters and shoemakers. Today, many of the 19th century waterfront landmarks, such as the Charles Street Meeting House, are found far from the water due to the filling that has taken place since then.

=====North slope=====

The north slope was the home of African Americans, sailors and Eastern and Southern European immigrants. The area around Belknap Street (now Joy Street) in particular became home to more than 1,000 blacks beginning in the mid-1700s. While this community is often described as arising from domestic workers in the homes of white residents on the south slope of the Hill, property records indicate that the black community on the north slope was already well-established by 1805, before the filling-in of the south slope was completed, and so before that slope of Beacon Hill came to be considered an affluent area.

Many blacks in the neighborhood attended church with the whites but did not have a vote in church affairs and sat in segregated seating. A Baptist congregation, built the African Meeting House in 1806 and by 1840 there were five black churches. The African Meeting House on Joy Street was a community center for members of the black elite. Frederick Douglass spoke there about abolition, and William Lloyd Garrison formed the New England Anti-Slavery Society at the Meeting House. It became a &quot;hotbed and an important depot on the Underground Railroad.&quot;

Blacks and whites were largely united on the subject of abolition. Beacon Hill was one of the staunchest centers of the anti-slavery movement in the Antebellum era.

One of the earliest black Republican legislators in the United States was Julius Caesar Chappelle (1852–1904), who served as a legislator in Boston from 1883 to 1886 and whose district included the Beacon Hill area. Chappelle was a popular, well-liked politician and was covered by many of the black newspapers in the United States.

Blacks migrated to Roxbury and Boston&#x27;s South End after the Civil War.

=====Immigrants=====
In the latter part of the 19th century, Beacon Hill absorbed an influx of Irish, Jewish and other immigrants.

Many homes built of brick and wood in the early 19th century were dilapidated by the end of the Civil War and were razed for new housing. Brick apartment buildings, or tenements, were built. Yellow brick townhouses were constructed, generally with arched windows on the first floor and a low ceiling on the top, fourth floor. Residential homes were also converted to boarding houses.

The north slope neighborhood transitioned as blacks moved out of the neighborhood and immigrants, such as Eastern European Jews, made their homes in the community. The Vilna Shul was established in 1898, and the African Meeting House was converted into a synagogue.

===20th century===

Better transportation service to the suburbs and other cities led a boom to the city&#x27;s economy at the beginning of the 20th century. New buildings, &quot;compatible with the surroundings&quot;, were built and older buildings renovated. To ensure that there were controls on new development and demolition, the Beacon Hill Association was formed in 1922. Into the 1940s there were attempts to replace brick sidewalks, but the projects were abandoned due to community resistance.

Banks, restaurants and other service industries moved into the &quot;Flat of the Hill&quot;, with a resulting transformation of the neighborhood.

Red-light districts operated near Beacon Hill in Scollay Square and the West End until a 1950s urban renewal project renovated the area. To prevent urban renewal projects of historically significant buildings in Beacon Hill, its residents ensured that the community obtained historic district status: south slope in 1955, Flat of the Hill in 1958, and north slope in 1963. The Beacon Hill Architectural Commission was established in 1955 to monitor renovation and development projects. For instance, in 1963, 70-72 Mount Vernon Street was to be demolished for the construction of an apartment building. A compromise was made to maintain the building and its exterior and build new apartments inside.

====Historic district and national landmark====
In 1955, state legislation Chapter 616 created the Historic Beacon Hill District. It was the first such district in Massachusetts, created to protect historic sites and manage urban renewal. Supporting these objectives is the local non-profit Beacon Hill Civic Association. According to the Massachusetts Historical Commission, the historic districts &quot;appear to have stabilized architectural fabric&quot; of Beacon Hill.

Beacon Hill was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 19, 1962.

===21st century===
Wealthy Boston families continue to live at the Flat of the Hill and south slope. Inhabitants of the north slope include Suffolk University students and professionals.

==Sites of interest==

===Black Heritage Trail===
The Boston African American National Historic Site is located just north of Boston Common. The historic buildings along today&#x27;s Black Heritage Trail were the homes, businesses, schools and churches of the black community. Charles Street Meeting House was built in 1807, the church had seating that segregated white and black people. The Museum of African American History, New England&#x27;s largest museum dedicated to African American history, is located at the African Meeting House, adjacent to the Abiel Smith School. The meeting house is the oldest surviving Black church built by African Americans. The Robert Gould Shaw Memorial and the 54th Massachusetts Regiment Memorial are located at Beacon Street and Park Street, opposite the Massachusetts State House.

===Massachusetts State House===
The Massachusetts State House, located on Beacon Street, is the home of the Commonwealth&#x27;s government. The gold-domed state capitol building was designed by Charles Bulfinch and was completed in 1798. Many of the country&#x27;s state capitol buildings were modeled after the State House.

===Organizations===

====Community====
The Beacon Hill Civic Association has a long history as a community resource for the Beacon Hill neighborhood. Founded in 1922 by neighbors with the goal of preventing home building and other construction, today it continues as a volunteer advocacy organization focused on improving quality of life in the neighborhood. It was first founded to fight city plans to replace the neighborhood&#x27;s brick sidewalks. Since then its efforts have been instrumental in preserving Beacon Hill as a historic district, and have expanded to include such initiatives as: working to become the first neighborhood to receive resident parking permits, streamlining trash service, and creating a virtual retirement community serving the neighborhood&#x27;s elderly.

====Non-religious====
The Club of Odd Volumes, a historic organization on Mount Vernon Street, serves as a Bibliophiles club, library, and archive. The Headquarters House, also known as William Hickling Prescott House, is a museum run by the Society of Colonial Dames. The country&#x27;s oldest legal organization, the Boston Bar Association, is on Beacon Street. Beacon Hill Village was the first formal Elder Village in the United States.

====Religious====
Religious organizations include the Vilna Shul, an Orthodox Jewish synagogue, and the Unitarian Universalist Association headquarters. Church of the Advent is a Victorian Gothic Church, faced in brick with 8 massive change ringing bells and a 172-foot spire. The Park Street Church, nicknamed &quot;Brimstone Corner&quot; in the 19th century, was used to store gunpowder during the War of 1812. Samuel Francis Smith first sang his song &quot;America the Beautiful&quot; at this church in 1831. Two years earlier William Lloyd Garrison spoke to the congregation about abolishing slavery. One of the few outposts of the small Protestant group the Swedenborgian Church is on Bowdoin Street, and was embroiled in controversy in 2013 over alleged extortion by a former mafioso. While home to a Paulist chapel, Beacon Hill is currently one of only two neighborhoods in Boston that does not contain a Catholic parish church.

===Neighborhoods===
Beacon Hill is predominantly residential, known for old colonial brick row houses with &quot;beautiful doors, decorative iron work, brick sidewalks, narrow streets, and gas lamps&quot;. Restaurants and antique shops are located on Charles Street.

Louisburg Square is &quot;the most prestigious address&quot; in Beacon Hill. Its residents have access to private parking and live in &quot;magnificent Greek Revival townhouses.&quot; Nearby is Acorn Street, often mentioned as the &quot;most frequently photographed street in the United States.&quot; It is a narrow lane paved with cobblestones that was home to coachmen employed by families in Mt. Vernon and Chestnut Street mansions.

The Harrison Gray Otis House on Cambridge Street was built in 1796. Charles Bulfinch designed this house, and two additional houses, for the businessman and politician who was instrumental in Beacon Hill&#x27;s development and Boston becoming the state capital. The Otis House also houses the headquarters of Historic New England, previously known as Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities. Other notable houses are the Francis Parkman House and an 1804 townhouse, now the Nichols House Museum. The Nichols House &quot;offers a rare glimpse inside [the] Brahmin life&quot; of Rose Standish Nichols, a landscape artists.

===Suffolk University===

Suffolk University and its Law School are adjacent to the Massachusetts State House and the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. The Suffolk University Law School was founded in 1906.

<text>The Valley of the Squinting Windows is a 1918 novel by Brinsley MacNamara (born John Weldon), set in the fictional village of Garradrimna, in central Ireland.

==Setting==
While MacNamara insisted that Garradrimna could represent any village in Ireland, geographical landmarks mentioned in the book and correspondences between its characters and his neighbours suggest that Garradrimna is based on the author&#x27;s hometown Delvin, County Westmeath; most notably, a de Lacy castle located at one end of the town. Also, a train from the region to Dublin passes through County Meath.

==Plot==

The novel is set in central Ireland c. 1914–16. Garradrimna is a tiny village where everyone is interested in everyone else&#x27;s business and wishes them to fail. Twenty years before the events of the book, Nan Byrne has a relationship with a local man, Henry Shannon, hoping to marry him for his wealth. She falls pregnant but Henry refuses to marry her. After a miscarriage, the baby is buried at the bottom of the garden. Henry marries another woman and later dies, while Nan emigrates to England and marries Ned Brennan. They later move back to Garradrimna, where the villagers rejoice in telling Ned about his wife&#x27;s past.

Ned is now an alcoholic, brought low by the humiliation of his wife&#x27;s past promiscuity. He makes a little as a labourer, whereas Nan works every day at sewing to support their only child, John, studying in England to become a Catholic priest. However, she has become as cruel, petty and jealous as the rest of Garradrimna, and connives with the postmistress to sabotage Myles Shannon&#x27;s chance at romance with an English girl, to get revenge on the Shannon family for rejecting her.

John returns to Garradrimna for a holiday, where he befriends Ulick Shannon (son of Henry) and falls for Rebecca Kerr, a schoolteacher. Ulick and Rebecca have a relationship, however, and when Rebecca becomes pregnant she is disgraced and expelled from the village. Ulick abandons her and John murders him, weighting the body with lead and hiding it in the lake. Rebecca leaves for Dublin and an uncertain future. An old gossip informs Nan and John that she was there the night Nan gave birth to Henry&#x27;s child — in reality, the child was born alive and was given to Henry and his wife — who they raised as their son, Ulick Shannon.

==Reception==

Hostility toward the work in MacNamara&#x27;s native Delvin led to the book&#x27;s burning shortly after its publication. The stir caused the author&#x27;s schoolmaster father, James, to be boycotted. In response, Weldon, snr., initiated a high-profile court case against those who thought that they had been described in the novel.

MacNamara&#x27;s novel has been reprinted several times, particularly when interest in the topic re-emerges. &quot;Valley of the squinting windows&quot; has become a colloquial term in Ireland to refer to a place where judgmental gossip is common.

<text>A 4-6-0 steam locomotive, under the Whyte notation for the classification of steam locomotives by wheel arrangement, has four leading wheels on two axles in a leading bogie and six powered and coupled driving wheels on three axles with the absence of trailing wheels.

In the mid-19th century, this wheel arrangement became the second-most-popular configuration for new steam locomotives in the United States, where this type is commonly referred to as a ten-wheeler. As locomotives pulling trains of lightweight all-wood passenger cars from the 1890 to the 1920s, they were exceptionally stable at near speeds on the New York Central&#x27;s New York-to-Chicago Water Level Route and on the Reading Railroad&#x27;s line from Camden to Atlantic City, New Jersey. 
==Overview==

===Tender locomotives===
During the second half of the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth centuries, the was constructed in large numbers for passenger and mixed traffic service. A natural extension of the 4-4-0 American wheel arrangement, the four-wheel leading bogie gave good stability at speed and allowed a longer boiler to be supported, while the lack of trailing wheels gave a high adhesive weight.

The primary limitation of the type was the small size of the firebox, which limited power output. In passenger service, it was eventually superseded by the 4-6-2 Pacific type whose trailing truck allowed it to carry a greatly enlarged firebox. Prussia and Saxony however went directly to the 2-8-2 Mikado type (pr. P10(39) / sax. XX HV(19) class); Karl Gölsdorf reversed the 2′C1 Pacific type to the 2-6-4 Adriatic type to accommodate an even larger firebox and better curve performance (type 310). For freight service, the addition of a fourth driving axle created the 4-8-0 Mastodon type, which was rare in North America, but became very popular on Cape gauge in Southern Africa.

===Tank locomotives===
The locomotive version was a far less common type. It was used for passenger duties during the first decade of the twentieth century, but was soon superseded by the 4-6-2T Pacific, 4-6-4T Hudson and 2-6-4T Adriatic types, on which larger fuel bunkers were possible. During the First World War, the type was also used on narrow-gauge military railways.

==Usage==

===Angola===

====Cape gauge====

In 1907, five 6th Class locomotives of the Cape Government Railways were sold to the Benguela Railway (CFB). These included one of the Dübs-built locomotives of 1897 and two each of the Neilson and Company and Neilson, Reid and Company-built locomotives of 1897 and 1898. (Also see South Africa - Cape gauge)

In the mid-1930s, in order to ease maintenance, modifications were made to the running boards and brake gear of the CFB locomotives. The former involved mounting the running boards higher, thereby getting rid of the driving wheel fairings. This gave the locomotives a much more American rather than British appearance.

====Narrow gauge====
In April 1951, three Class NG9 locomotives were purchased from the South African Railways for the &quot;Caminhos de Ferro de Moçâmedes&quot; (CFM). They were placed in service on the &quot;Ramal da Chibía&quot;, a gauge branch line across from Sá da Bandeira to Chiange. The locomotives were observed dumped at the Sá da Bandeira shops by 1969 and the branch line itself was closed in 1970. (Also see South Africa - Narrow gauge)

===Bechuanaland===
In 1897, three Class 6 locomotives were ordered by the Cape Government Railways (CGR) from Neilson and Company for use on the new Vryburg to Bulawayo line of the fledgling Bechuanaland Railway Company (BR). The line through Bechuanaland Protectorate was still under construction and was operated by the CGR on behalf of the BR at the time. The locomotives were eventually returned to the CGR.

===Canada===
Around 1912, the Algoma Eastern Railway in Ontario, Canada, acquired Baldwin Locomotive Works #20272, a 4-6-0, which had been built in 1902. The locomotive was scrapped in 1927.

Besides several of the country&#x27;s smaller railroads, Canada&#x27;s two largest railroads, the Canadian National Railway and Canadian Pacific Railway also rostered examples of 4-6-0s, some of which have been preserved. Among the more modern examples for both railroads were the Canadian National H-6 and the Canadian Pacific D10.

===Denmark===

In 1912, DSB or Danish state railways (Danske statsbaner) would receive the first 2 of 30 R class steam locomotives. 2 versions of the class would be built. 
* R (I): 20 of this type would be built. They had a 2-cylinder layout.
* R (II): 10 of this type would be built. They had a 3-cylinder layout.

After WWII, DSB would end up with 3 Prussian P8 class 4-6-0 steam locomotives. They would eventually take ownership of them, classifying them as the T class.

===Finland===
The Finnish State Railways (&quot;Suomen Valtion Rautatiet&quot; or SVR, later the &quot;Valtionrautatiet&quot; or VR) operated the Classes Hk1, Hk2, Hk3, Hk5, Hv1, Hv2, Hv3, Hv4, Hr2 and Hr3 locomotives with a wheel arrangement.

The Class Hk1, numbers 232 to 241, was built by Baldwin Locomotive Works in 1898. The ten Baldwin locomotives were originally designated H1 class.

Numbers 291 to 300 and 322 to 333 were built by the Richmond Locomotive Works in 1900 and 1901. The 22 Richmond locomotives were originally designated H2 class and were nicknamed &quot;Big-Wheel Kaanari&quot;. One of them, No. 293, the locomotive that brought Lenin from exile in August–September 1917 prior to the Russian Revolution, was presented by Finland to the Soviet Union on 13 June 1957 and is preserved at the Finland Station in St. Petersburg, Russia.

Another 100 of these locomotives were manufactured in Finland from 1903 to 1916, numbered in the range from 437 to 574 and initially designated H3 to H8 classes.

The Class Hk5 was numbered from 439 to 515. One, No. 497, is preserved at Haapamäki.
The Class Hv1 was built from 1915 by Tampella and Lokomo. They were nicknamed &quot;Heikki&quot; and were numbered 545 to 578 and 648 to 655. The class remained in service until 1967. One, No. 555 named &quot;Princess&quot;, is preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum.
The Class Hv2 was built by Berliner Maschinenbau and Lokomo in the years between 1919 and 1926. They were numbered 579 to 593, 671 to 684 and 777 to 780. One, No. 680, is preserved at Haapamäki.

The Class Hv3 was built by Berliner, Tampella and Lokomo in the years from 1921 to 1941. They were numbered 638 to 647, 781 to 785 and 991 to 999. Three Class Hv3 locomotives were preserved, No. 781 at Kerava, No. 995 at Suolahti and No. 998 at Haapamäki.

The Class Hv4 was built by Tampella and Lokomo in the years from 1912 to 1933 and were numbered 516 to 529, 742 to 751 and 757 to 760. Two, numbers 742 and 751, are preserved at Haapamäki.

The Swedish State Railways (&quot;Statens Järnvägar&quot; or SJ) sold its Class Ta and Tb locomotives to Finland in 1942. At the time, they were not in traffic in Sweden and, since they were purchased by Finland, they were not considered as war assistance. The Class Ta was designated Class Hr2 in Finland while the Class Tb was designated Class Hr3.
* The Class Hr2 was numbered from 1900 to 1906 and had been built by Swedish builders NOHAB (&quot;Nydqvist &amp; Holm AB&quot;) and Motala Verkstad in the years from 1901 to 1905. They were withdrawn from service in Finland between 1950 and 1953.
* The Class Hr3 was numbered from 1907 to 1919 and had been built in Sweden by NOHAB, Motala, the &quot;Vagn &amp; Maskinfabriks AB&quot; in Falun and &quot;Nya AB Atlas&quot; in Stockholm in the years from 1906 to 1908. The Class Hr3 was withdrawn from service in Finland between 1952 and 1953.

===France===

Two 4-6-0 tank locomotive types saw service in France.

The Réseau Breton tank locomotives were a class of locomotives of which five were built in 1904 for the Réseau Breton railway by Société Franco-Belge at its Raismes factory. A further seven locomotives were built by Société Alsacienne de Constructions Mécaniques (SACM) at its Belfort plant in France in 1909.

The Baldwin Class 10-12-D gauge pannier tank locomotives were built in the United States by Baldwin Locomotive Works for the British War Department Light Railways, for service in France in 1916 and 1917 during the First World War. A further batch was built by the American Locomotive Company. After the war, many of these locomotives were sold to work in France, Britain and India.

===Germany===

The wheel arrangement was very popular on the railroads of German states from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, when they gradually replaced American type locomotives, initially especially on hilly terrain. In 1925, after the creation of the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG), express passenger locomotives were classified under group 17, while regular passenger locomotives were classified under group 38.

====Baden====
In 1894, Baden adopted its IVe class passenger locomotives of Alfred de Glehn design, the first four-cylinder compound locomotive ever. Altogether 83 were built and later became the DRG class 3870.

====Bavaria====
Bavaria acquired three express passenger locomotive classes. All were Maffei-built four-cylinder compound locomotives.
* The C V class, of which 43 were built from 1899, later the DRG class 173.
* The S 3/5N class, of which 39 were built from 1903, later the DRG class 174.
* The superheated steam S 3/5H class, of which thirty were built from 1906, later the DGR class 175.

Bavaria only began using passenger locomotives in 1905.
* The first was the P 3/5 N class, of which 36 were built, later the DRG class 380.
* After a long break, Bavaria ordered a superheated steam P 3/5 H class in 1921. Eighty of these were built and later became the DRG class 384.

====Prussia====
In 1899, Prussia ordered a short series of 18 De Glehn passenger locomotives that were designated S 7 class.

The most numerous series in the world was the Prussian P 8 passenger locomotive, later the DRG class 3810-40, of which 3,556 were built for the Prussian state railways and German railways between 1906 and 1923. Of these, 627 locomotives were given to other countries after the First World War. When exports and licensed production in Romania are included, their number reached almost 4000. (Also see )

Prussia only started to operate express locomotives of its S 10 family from 1910. While they were externally similar, they differed in engine arrangement.
* The S 10 quadruple (4-cylinder, single expansion) of which 202 were built from 1910, later the DRG class 170-1.
* The S 101 4-cylinder compound, of which 237 were built in two batches from 1911 and 1914 (with pre-heater), later the DRG class 1710-12.
* The S 102 3-cylinder, of which 124 were built from 1914, later the DRG class 172.

====Saxony====
From 1906, Saxony used express service locomotive classes XII H, XII HV and XII H1, of which 6, 42 and 7 were built respectively. They later became the DRG classes 176, 177 and 178 respectively. All were superheated steam locomotives, differing mostly in engine arrangements.

More numerous were the Saxon XII H2 class passenger locomotives, of which 169 were built from 1910. They later became the DRG class 382-3.

====Württemberg====
From 1898, the Royal Württemberg State Railways used D class passenger locomotives. It was also a four-cylinder compound locomotive, of which fourteen were built.

=== Indonesia ===
 &quot;Nederlandsch-Indische Spoorweg Maatschappij&quot; (NIS) received 10 units of the first superheated 4-6-0 long-range runner for 3 ft 6 in (1,067 mm) from Beyer, Peacock and Company, Manchester. These locos were come in 1913, and classified as NIS Class 370 (371-380). After arriving in Java, these locomotives worked as an effort to pursue the target of taking the Gundih–Surabaya with a travel time of approximately 7 hours. 4 units worked on Batavia (Jakarta)–Buitenzorg (Bogor) for express trains. While the rest of the 6 were used on Soerabaia NIS (Surabaya Pasar Turi)–Gundih line and allocated in Cepu depot, Central Java. The NIS 370 class locomotives also underwent technical and design improvements so that it was able to reach a maximum speed of 75 kilometres per hour (47 miles per hour) which was much faster than the original speed of only around 60 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour). 

Apart from being used to pull express trains, the NIS 370s were also used to haul freight trains. This freight train contains petroleum from &quot;Koloniale Petroleum Verkoop Mij.&quot; (KPVM). KPVM was a part of the NKPM company (&quot;Nederlandsche Koloniale Petroleum Maatschappij&quot;). Not quite a long, NIS also imported 20 more 4-6-0 locomotives with similar characteristics to the NIS Class 370 but with some improvements from 3 different builders. At first batch, they received 5 units from Werkspoor, N.V. (Netherlands) in 1918-1919. Then, the second batch consisting 5 units from Henschel &amp; Son (Germany) in 1921. At last, 10 units from Werkspoor and Beyer, Peacock and Company finally came in 1922 to serve the increase of passenger traffics. Soon, the new upgraded 4-6-0 superheater locomotives were classified as NIS Class 381 (381-400) and worked on Semarang Tawang–Cepu–Soerabaia NIS and Semarang Tawang–&quot;Vorstenlanden&quot; (Surakarta and Jogja Lempuyangan) lines. In 1935, NIS received the concession to upgrade their mainline from Soerabaia to Semarang which was tram line becoming 2nd class railway line. NIS 381–400 once reached a speed of up to 105 kilometres per hour (65 miles per hour) during some series of tests, making it the fastest locomotive fleet owned by NIS at that time. During Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies in 1942, all of Dutch East Indies private / state-owned railway locomotives were renumbered based on Japanese numberings. The NIS 370s were renumbered to C51, while the NIS 380s became C52. It could be said that C52s were the missing class of locomotives because almost all of them were sent by Japanese and Dutch to various countries in the Indochina and Malay Peninsula regions during war period and were never operated again after Indonesian independence and they also lack of documentations. Many were sent to Malaya, Cambodia, Thailand and had been scrapped in 1949-1950s because they had been re-gauged to 1,000 mm. From 20 of them, only C52 17 (ex-NIS 397) is preserved in Army Engineering Museum, Ratchaburi, Thailand. While the C51s were so lucky because they remained in service in Java during the war. From 10 of them, only C51 01 is preserved in Ambarawa Railway Museum, Central Java.
On the other hand, &quot;Samarang–Cheribon Stoomtram Mij.&quot; (SCS) or Samarang–Cheribon Steam Tramway imported 19 units of superheated 4-6-0s, consisting 13 from Hartmann, Chemnitz and 6 from Beyer, Peacock and Company, Manchester in 1922, classified as SCS Class 200 (201–219) and worked both for freight and express trains on north coastline of Semarang–Cheribon which was connected to &quot;Staatsspoorwegen&#x27;s&quot; (SS) line to Batavia. This line was completed on November 1, 1914 to support the transportation of passengers and freights, especially on the north coast of Java. Some cities like Semarang, Pekalongan, Tegal and Cheribon, there were 54 sugar mills operating at that time. The completion of this line construction was also made an increase in the volume of freights and number of passengers transported. By 1912-1921, just before receiving 4-6-0 engines, SCS had improved the quality of their line, especially on the Cirebon–Semarang which is 226 kilometres (140 miles) away with the aim to increase the speed limits of their trains. Speed limit for trains on the Cirebon–Semarang route had been changed from 59 kilometres per hour (37 miles per hour) to 75 kilometres per hour (47 miles per hour). With the improvement in the quality of this rail line, the SCS 200s with express trains could serve passengers traveling from Batavia to Semarang in just 7 hours. Passengers first have a transit at Cheribon which owned by SS, then they continue using SCS trains to Semarang. During Japanese occupation, all SCS Class 200 were renumbered to C54 class and around 4 units of them were moved to Sumatra to serve the Muaro (West Sumatra)–Pekanbaru (Riau) train transport line. This locomotive was tested to haul the transport coal train from coal mines in West Sumatra. Of the 19 units of C54, there are currently 2 remaining, a C54 with unknown individual number and C5417, C5417 (from Beyer Peacock) is preserved at the Ambarawa Railway Museum, Central Java. Meanwhile, the unidentified C54 locomotive is abandoned in the forest in Tutup Kain Selatan, Kampar Regency, Riau with its incomplete physical condition.

===Ireland===
The only Irish railways to use the 4-6-0 type were the Great Southern &amp; Western Railway (GS&amp;WR) and its larger successor, Great Southern Railways (GSR). The GS&amp;WR had 4-6-0s for both fast freight and express passenger service. The culmination of Irish 4-6-0 design was the GSR Class 800 or B1a class, introduced in 1939. Three of these locomotives were built for top express passenger work on the Dublin-Cork mainline, coincidentally resembling the United Kingdom&#x27;s &quot;Royal Scot&quot; Class as rebuilt. They were the last new steam locomotives to be built for the GSR.

===New Zealand===
The New Zealand Railways Department built its first home-built tender locomotives in 1894, using the 4-6-0 wheel arrangement. Designated as the &quot;U&quot; class their production run lasted for a decade and produced only nine locomotives. Lack of colonial capacity resulted in an order for units built in the United Kingdom - but production delays led to a batch of ten Baldwin-built locomotives being ordered - which were promptly delivered. When the half-dozen Sharp Stewart examples entered service the designation in the annual locomotive returns became the &quot;Colonial U&quot;, &quot;American U&quot;, and &quot;English U&quot; even though the Sharp Stewarts were built in Scotland.

Another Baldwin batch and Sharp Stewart batch arrived into service in 1901, along with a sample from Richmond and another sample from Brooks - although the ALCO merger occurred before delivery. With the proliferation of batches the classification became &quot;U&quot; for the colonial-built examples, &quot;Ua&quot; for the early Sharp Stewarts, &quot;Ub&quot; for all American-built locomotives, and &quot;Uc&quot; for the second batch of Sharp Stewarts.

The Baldwins were considered free steamers and were for a time the best locomotives in the colony. The Brooks was highly regarded. The Richmond was not successful. The Sharp Stewarts and colonial locomotives were more finely built than the Baldwins - but poorer steamers. The colonial locomotives were never successful in mainline work - they subsequently became a useful branchline locomotive. 

By 1901 the introduction of &quot;Pacific&quot; types began to push the Ten-Wheelers into second-tier service. The combination of standardisation and the Great Depression saw the Ua, early Ub, and the sample locomotives scrapped. The later Ub and Uc classes lasted until 1957 - but were scrapped whenever uneconomic repairs were needed, and also because dieselisation had begun to displace more modern steam locomotives into what had been their territory. Even in their last years, the Sharp Stewarts did primarily passenger duty because they didn&#x27;t have the hauling ability for freight work when compared to the Baldwins.  

The privately owned Wellington and Manawatu Railway purchased two Ten-Wheelers from Baldwin in 1904. In 1908 they were acquired by the Government and became the Ud Class. They were also a victim of standardisation and were scrapped when repairs were required - the last being written off in 1931.  In all, NZGR had forty-nine of 4-6-0 locomotives, from five manufacturers, built over eleven years to nine different standards.

===Norway===

In 1879, the Norwegian State Railways, the &quot;Smaalensbanen&quot; and &quot;Merakerbanen&quot;, received four ten-wheelers with three-axled tenders from Baldwin Locomotive Works which were the first 4-6-0s in Europe.

===Poland===

The Polish State Railways (PKP) used several classes of Prussian and other German locomotives. The most significant of these was the Prussian P 8, classified in Poland as the PKP class Ok1. After the First World War, Poland received as reparations and also bought altogether 257 of these locomotives. After the Second World War, their number rose to 429 locomotives, which made it the most numerous passenger locomotive in Poland. A few were preserved and kept in working condition, including Class Ok1 No. 359. (Also see Germany - Prussia)

A significant number of the Prussian S 10 family of express passenger locomotives were also used in Poland. There were 52 in total, classified as Pk1, Pk2 and Pk3.

During the inter-war period, a PKP class Ok22 locomotive was designed in cooperation with German builders Hanomag. It was basically an improved class Ok1 with a more efficient boiler. Altogether 190 of them were produced for the PKP, of which all but five were manufactured in Poland.

===Romania===
After WWI, Romania received as war reparations 18 Prussian P 8 locomotives (classified as the &quot;CFR 230.000 Class&quot;), and then imported other 127 units for Căile Ferate Române (CFR), in 1921–1930. Further 226 locomotives were licence-manufactured in Romania by Reșița works (between 1932 and 1936), and Malaxa (1932-1939).

===Russia===
 passenger locomotives became quite popular in Russia at the turn of the 20th century. While the locomotives originally had separate class designations on each Russian railroad, common Russian class designations were introduced in 1912. The Russian were the A, V, Zh, Z, G, U, K, B and classes.
* The first and most numerous class was the Vladicaucasian Railway&#x27;s A class, in the and, the most numerous, series. It was a Kolomna factory design, of which 533 were built for several railroads in several Russian and German factories from 1892 until 1907. All were two-cylinder compound locomotives with diameter coupled wheels.
* In 1896, 88 Baldwin-built four-cylinder Vauclain compound locomotives were introduced, designated V class (V for Vauclain, В in Russian).
* Also from 1896, Henschel-designed locomotives were introduced. Altogether 210 were built from 1896 to 1909, fourteen by Henschel and the rest in Russia. They were two-cylinder compound locomotives with diameter coupled wheels and were regarded as a more successful design than the A class. These locomotives were later designated as the Zh class (Ж in Russian). A development of the Zh class was the superheated Z class (З in Russian), of which 24 were built from 1902. 
* From 1901 to 1903, stronger passenger locomotives were built, the G class (Г in Russian). These locomotives were of Vladicaucasian Railway and Bryansk factory design. Of these, 39 were built for the Vladicaucasian Railway and another 85 for Eastern Chinese railroads. They were two-cylinder compound locomotives with diameter coupled wheels. Some of these locomotives were later retrofitted with superheaters.
* The class U (У in Russian) was a four-cylinder oil-burning De Glehn compound locomotive which first appeared in 1906, initially on the Ryazan-Ural railroad. Of these, 62 were built at the Kirov Plant between 1906 and 1916. By the beginning of 1940, the inventory still listed 47 U class locomotives and the last of them were withdrawn in 1952. Lenin&#x27;s locomotive, U class No. U-127 that was used during his funeral, is preserved at the Museum of the Moscow Railway.
* Altogether 145 heavier superheated K-class (К in Russian) passenger locomotives were built between 1907 and 1912. They were of Kolomna factory design and were two-cylinder simple expansion (simplex) locomotives with diameter coupled wheels.
* At the same time, the Briansk factory designed an improved superheated development of the G class that was produced between 1907 and 1914 as the B class (Б in Russian). Altogether 252 were built in Briansk and Lugansk. They were two-cylinder simplex locomotives with diameter coupled wheels that were quite successful in express work.
* Between 1911 and 1914, Kolomna built 39 stronger class locomotives ( in Russian) with diameter coupled wheels for faster trains.

===South Africa===
Eighteen classes of locomotives saw service in South Africa, sixteen on and two on narrow gauge. Of these, only two were conventional tank locomotives, while two others were delivered as tank-and-tender locomotives with optional tenders.

====Cape gauge====

Between 1879 and 1885, the Natal Government Railways (NGR) placed 37 tank locomotives in service. Of these, 18 were built by Kitson and Company and 19 by Stephenson. On the NGR they were designated Class G. When the SAR was established in 1912, the 15 unmodified survivors were designated Class C. The last one was withdrawn from service in the mid-1980s, after more than 105 years in service.

In 1880 and 1881, the Cape Government Railways (CGR) placed 18 4th Class tank-and-tender locomotives in mainline service on its Midland System working out of Port Elizabeth and Eastern System working out of East London. Four of these locomotives were still in service when the South African Railways was established in 1912.
In 1882 and 1883, the CGR placed 68 tank-and-tender locomotives in mainline service on all three systems. It was an improved version of the 4th Class locomotives of 1880 with larger coupled wheels, built by two manufacturers. Robert Stephenson and Company built 33 with Stephenson valve gear, while Neilson and Company built 35 with Joy valve gear. Of these locomotives, 26 were still in service when the South African Railways was established in 1912.
Four tank-and-tender locomotives of the CGR&#x27;s Experimental 4th Class were supplied by Neilson in 1884, built to the design of J.D. Tilney, Locomotive Superintendent of the Cape Eastern System at the time, to be able to use low-grade local coal. They had Joy valve gear and unusual six-wheeled tenders, with the leading axle mounted in a rigid frame and the other two axles mounted in a bogie. One of the locomotives survived until 1912 and was designated SAR Class 04 as an obsolete locomotive.

The first twenty of the CGR 5th Class tender locomotives were delivered from Dübs and Company in 1890. In 1891, the CGR placed a second batch of thirty  tender locomotives in mainline service on all three Cape Systems. They were similar to the previous batch of 1890, but differed in respect of the diameter of their coupled wheels, the length of their smokeboxes and their tractive effort. In 1912, when the South African Railways (SAR) was established, the survivors were considered obsolete and designated Class 05. Nevertheless, some of the Class 05 locomotives survived as shunting engines in SAR service for another four decades. They were the last obsolete locomotives to be still in service when they were eventually withdrawn in 1953.

The Cape 6th Class passenger locomotive was designed at the Salt River works of the CGR according to the specifications of Michael Stephens, then Chief Locomotive Superintendent of the CGR, and under the supervision of H.M. Beatty, then Locomotive Superintendent of the Cape&#x27;s Western System. It was to become one of the most useful classes to see service in South Africa. In 1912, when they came into SAR stock, the 6th Class family was reclassified into twelve separate classes.

* In 1893 and 1894, the CGR placed forty 6th Class locomotives in service, built by Dübs. Ten of them, sold to the &quot;Oranje-Vrijstaat Gouwerment-Spoorwegen&quot; (OVGS) in 1897, eventually became the Class 6-L1 on the CSAR. In 1912, all forty were assimilated into the SAR and retained their Class 6 designation. (Also see Sudan)
* In 1896 and 1897, the CGR acquired a second batch of fifty, built by Dübs and Sharp, Stewart and Company. These locomotives differed from the previous order in having slightly larger boilers with an increased heating surface and higher coal capacity tenders. In 1907, one was sold to the Benguela Railway in Angola. The remaining 49 locomotives were designated Class 6A on the SAR in 1912. (Also see Angola - Cape gauge and Sudan)
* Between 1896 and 1898, the OVGS placed 24 new Cape Class 6 locomotives in service, built by Dübs, Neilson and Sharp, Stewart. During the Second Boer War, these locomotives were taken over by the Imperial Military Railways (IMR) and after the war they became the CSAR Class 6-L2. All but one were assimilated into the SAR in 1912 and were designated Class 6C. (Also see Sudan)
* In 1897 and 1898, the CGR placed a third batch of 55 in service, built by Dübs, Neilson and Company and Neilson, Reid and Company. They were virtually identical to the previous fifty, except that they had bogie-wheeled tenders. In 1907, four were sold to the Benguela Railway in Angola. The remaining 51 locomotives were designated Class 6B in 1912. (Also see Angola – Cape gauge and Sudan)

* In 1898, a fourth batch of 33 were placed in service by the CGR, built by Neilson, Reid. These represented a further advance on earlier 6th Class locomotives, with a greater heating surface and a larger grate area. In 1912, they were designated Class 6D on the SAR. (Also see Sudan)
* Also in 1898, the OVGS ordered its final six new Cape 6th Class locomotives from Sharp, Stewart. These were delivered with larger cabs than their predecessors and with bogie-wheeled tenders. They were also taken over by the IMR and, after the war, came into the CSAR as Class 6-L3. In 1912, they became Class 6E on the SAR.
* In 1900, two redesigned 6th Class locomotives entered service on the CGR, built by Sharp, Stewart. They had bar frames, larger cabs and bogie-wheeled tenders, and their larger heating surfaces and grate areas allowed a higher boiler pressure rating of . In visual appearance, they differed from all previous 6th Class locomotives by having higher running boards without driving wheel fairings. In 1912, they were classified as Class 6F on the SAR.

* In 1901, eight 6th Class locomotives entered service, redesigned and built by the Schenectady Locomotive Works to the specifications of the CGR. Also built on bar frames like the previous two and similar in appearance, they were larger, with larger boilers and diameter cylinders compared to the of all earlier 6th Class locomotives. In 1912, they became Class 6G on the SAR.
* Also in 1901, a batch of 21 entered service on the CGR, built by Neilson, Reid to the older plate frame design, but with a larger cab. These also reverted to the diameter cylinders of the previous British-built locomotives, with the lower running boards with driving wheel fairings. One of them was experimental, being equipped with Drummond cross-water tubes in the firebox. However, since the tubes were inclined to leak and were difficult to maintain, they were soon removed. In 1912, these locomotives became the Class 6H on the SAR.
* Ten bar-framed locomotives were placed in service, also in 1901, designed and built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works to the specifications of the CGR. They were larger than any of the previous 6th Class locomotives, with larger boilers, large cabs, cylinders of bore, bar frames, stovepipe chimneys, large domes and high running boards without driving wheel fairings. In 1912, they became Class 6K on the SAR.

* In 1902, fourteen bar-framed 6th Class locomotives entered service on the CGR, built by Neilson, Reid. They were practically identical to the two bar-framed locomotives built by Sharp, Stewart in 1900, with high running boards without driving wheel fairings. In 1912, they were designated Class 6J on the SAR.
* In 1904, the CGR placed its last two 6th Class bar-framed locomotives in service, built by the North British Locomotive Company (NBL). They were experimental and were the first South African locomotives to have piston valves and superheaters. The pistons, with a diameter of , were the largest yet used on the 6th Class. The Schmidt superheater was of the smokebox type, but the arrangement was extremely complicated and not very successful. In 1912, they became the Class 6L on the SAR and in 1915, when they were reboilered, the superheaters were removed to convert them to saturated steam locomotives. At the same time the piston-valve cylinders were replaced with smaller slide-valve cylinders of bore.

In 1897, the Pretoria-Pietersburg Railway in the Zuid-Afrikaansche Republiek (Transvaal Republic) purchased a tank locomotive with a wheel arrangement from the Lourenco Marques, Delagoa Bay and East Africa Railway in Mozambique. The locomotive was not classified, but named &quot;Portuguese&quot; and referred to by name.

====Narrow gauge====

In 1903, the CGR placed six Type B locomotives with eight-wheeled bogie tenders in service on the Avontuur narrow gauge line in the Langkloof. They were built by W. G. Bagnall and had bar frames, copper fireboxes and Stephenson valve gear. In 1912, they came into SAR stock and, in 1914, a further three locomotives with slightly longer boilers were acquired by the SAR. One of these was also built by Bagnall while the other two were built by Kerr, Stuart and Company. These three were commonly referred to as the Improved B. When a system of grouping narrow gauge locomotives into classes was eventually introduced somewhere between 1928 and 1930, they were to be classified as Class NG8 but had already been withdrawn from service.

During 1915 and 1916, the SAR placed six locomotives in service in the Langkloof, built by Baldwin Locomotive Works. They were very similar to the Bagnall built Type B, except that they were equipped with Walschaerts valve gear. They were later designated Class NG9. Three of them survived in SAR service until April 1951, when they were sold to the &quot;Caminhos de Ferro de Moçâmedes&quot; (CFM) of Angola. (Also see Angola - Narrow gauge)

===Sudan===
During the Second World War, sixteen of the South African Railways (SAR) Classes 6 to 6D were transferred to the Middle East to assist with the war effort during the North African Campaign. The group consisted of seven Class 6, four Class 6A, two Class 6B, one Class 6C and two Class 6D locomotives. They were sold to the Sudan Railways Corporation in 1942. (Also see South Africa - Cape gauge)

===Sweden===

The Swedish class of B locomotives were of this arrangement they were used for both goods trains and high speed passenger services being built 1909-19 the locomotive was so successful three more locomotives were built in 1943-44 all locomotives were built by NOHAB. A relatively large number of the locomotives are preserved as it was one of the last steam locomotives in the strategic reserve and was kept in mothball storage until the 1990s.

===Switzerland===

The Swiss Class A 3/5 locomotives built by the Swiss Locomotive and Machine Works between 1902 and 1922 for the Jura–Simplon Railway, and the Gotthard Railway was of type 4-6-0.

=== Thailand ===

The Royal State Railway of Siam/Thailand (RSR(S)), later the State Railway of Thailand (SRT) had three classes of 4-6-0 type locomotives in their fleet:
* The first class of Thai 4-6-0 locomotives was designated as their class E, built by the North British Locomotive Company (NBL) in three batches of 12, 5 and 24 in 1913, 1915 and 1919 respectively. The E class were based on a standardised design outlined by the British Engineering Standards Committee (BESC, later the British Engineering Standards Association (BESA)) of a mixed-traffic metre-gauge locomotive for service on British Indian railways, as delivered to the Madras and Southern Mahratta Railway (MSMR).
* The second class of Thai 4-6-0 locomotives were 7 4-6-0s of the Nederlands-Indische Spoorweg (NIS) 381-400 number series, later the C52 class locomotives. These were captured by the Japanese occupation forces in the Dutch East Indies during WWII and hauled trains on the Burma Railway. Other locomotives from the same class were sent to Indochina.

* The third class of Thai 4-6-0 locomotives was a single Burma Railways (BR) Ks class locomotive, no. 396, also derived from the aforementioned BESC design (with superheating applied), and also captured by Japanese occupation forces in Burma and taken to Thailand.

Six out of the twelve locomotives from the first batch of Es were given Caprotti valve gear in 1930. Five E class locomotives were donated to Cambodia in the 1970s, then considered surplus by the SRT. The remaining members of the E class were in service with the Thai railways until 1974.

Several E class locomotives are preserved at various locations in Thailand.

One of the Thai C52s was lost either to an accident or to cannibalisation. The remaining members of the class were later purchased from the NIS and taken into SRT stock. No. 751 of the ex-NIS 4-6-0s is preserved at the Army Engineering Museum, Ratchaburi.

The single ex-Burmese Ks was withdrawn and scrapped in 1954 after the Thai railways recovered from the war.

===United Kingdom===

The first locomotive to be introduced in the United Kingdom was the Highland Railway&#x27;s &quot;Jones Goods&quot; class of 1894, the first of which (No. 103) survives. Within five years, however, the wheel arrangement was being used primarily on passenger service, since British heavy freight trains were generally too slow to require a locomotive with a four-wheel leading bogie. Between 1906 and 1925, the became the most common express passenger locomotive type in everyday use in the United Kingdom, as a logical development from the 4-4-0 type that was previously used. The type continued to be used as mixed traffic locomotive until the end of steam in the United Kingdom in 1968.

====Pre-grouping era====

During the pre-grouping era, from 1899 to 1923, Wilson Worsdell of the North Eastern Railway (NER) used the type for his express passenger locomotives, the S and S1 classes of 1899 and 1900 that became the B13 and B14 classes of the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) in 1923. Soon afterwards, these were followed by the appearance of other designs.
* John G. Robinson of the Great Central Railway (GCR) designed the Class 8 &quot;Fish Engines&quot; of 1902.
* In 1902 and 1903, George Jackson Churchward produced the 2900 &quot;Saint&quot; Class, which was the first in a long line of classes operated by the Great Western Railway (GWR).
* In 1903, Francis Webb of the London and North Western Railway (LNWR) followed with his unsuccessful four-cylinder compound locomotives of the 1400 &quot;Bill Bailey&quot; class.
* Between 1905 and 1910, altogether 105 locomotives of George Whale&#x27;s &quot;Experiment&quot; Class were built for the LNWR.

Two notable express passenger designs appeared in 1906. One was the Caledonian Railway&#x27;s &quot;Cardean&quot; Class which was, at the time, the most powerful locomotive in Britain. The other was Churchward&#x27;s four-cylinder GWR &quot;Star&quot; Class, which was developed and enlarged by Charles Collett as the GWR 4073 &quot;Castle&quot; class in 1923 and later also as the GWR 6000 &quot;King&quot; class in 1927.

Other significant early express designs included:
* The LNWR&#x27;s &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; Class, with 246 locomotives built between 1911 and 1921.
* The LNWR&#x27;s &quot;Claughton&quot; Class, with 130 locomotives built between 1913 and 1924.
* The Class S69 of the Great Eastern Railway (GER), with 81 locomotives produced between 1912 and 1928.
Robert Urie of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) introduced three successful classes, the H15 class mixed traffic locomotives, introduced in 1914 and built until 1924, the N15 &quot;King Arthur&quot; class, with 74 locomotives built between 1919 and 1926, and the S15 class, with 45 locomotives built between 1920 and 1936.

In 1907, Wilson Worsdell of the NER built ten W class T tank locomotives. These were all rebuilt to NER Class W1 4-6-2T Pacific between 1914 and 1917.

====Post-grouping era====
During the post-grouping era from 1923 to 1948, the wheel arrangement was used extensively by all of the Big Four British railway companies, especially by the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), who continued to develop new designs.

However, from the early 1930s, demands for more power and improved performance from express passenger locomotives led to the widespread introduction of 4-6-2 Pacific locomotives, where the trailing axle could support a larger firebox. Since the reduced traction of the driving wheels was not a big disadvantage with relatively light passenger trains, the was displaced from top-rank express services on most of the railways where they had been used, with the exception of the GWR who continued to build both mixed-traffic and express passenger s until nationalisation in 1948. The GWR&#x27;s 4073 &quot;Castle&quot; Class eventually consisted of 171 express passenger locomotives, built between 1923 and 1950. The design was enlarged as the GWR&#x27;s 6000 &quot;King&quot; Class, with thirty locomotives built between 1927 and 1930.

Several new mixed traffic were also introduced:
* The Southern Railway improved the LSWR&#x27;s &quot;King Arthur&quot; class and introduced the &quot;Lord Nelson&quot; class, which was briefly the most powerful class in Britain. Sixteen locomotives were built between 1926 and 1929.
* The LMS introduced the 7P &quot;Royal Scot&quot; class, with 71 locomotives built between 1927 and 1930, and the 6P &quot;Patriot&quot; class, with 52 locomotives built between 1930 and 1934. All of the &quot;Royal Scots&quot; and 18 of the &quot;Patriots&quot; were subsequently rebuilt in line with Stanier&#x27;s practice and were very successful in this form.
* The largest and most successful British class was the LMS Class 5 &quot;Black Five&quot;, designed by William Stanier and consisting of 842 locomotives, built between 1934 and 1951. Stanier also designed the LMS 6P &quot;Jubilee&quot; class, with 191 locomotives built between 1934 and 1936.
Charles Collett of the GWR developed Churchward&#x27;s 1902 &quot;Saint&quot; class design into three further classes:
* The GWR 4900 &quot;Hall&quot; class, with 259 locomotives built between 1928 and 1943.
* The GWR 6800 &quot;Grange&quot; class, with eighty locomotives built between 1936 and 1939.
* The GWR 7800 &quot;Manor&quot; class, with thirty locomotives built between 1938 and 1950.

Frederick Hawksworth later developed the &quot;Saint&quot; class design further, first with his GWR 6959 &quot;Modified Hall&quot; Class, with 71 locomotives built between 1944 and 1950, and then with his GWR 1000 &quot;County&quot; Class, with thirty locomotives built between 1945 and 1947.

The LNER inherited large numbers of locomotives from its constituent companies, many of which were subsequently rebuilt, so that the company ultimately had sixty different classes and sub-classes with this wheel arrangement. In addition, the company also introduced two new classes.
* The B17 class, designed by Nigel Gresley, of which 73 were built between 1928 and 1937.
* The B1 class, designed by Edward Thompson, of which 410 locomotives were built between 1942 and 1952.
====British Railways era====
Following the formation of British Railways in 1948, two further classes were introduced, both in 1951.
* The BR Standard Class 5 was based on Stanier&#x27;s successful LMS &quot;Black Five&quot; of 1934. Altogether 172 locomotives were built by 1957.
* A lighter and less powerful design was the BR Standard Class 4. Eighty of these were built by 1957.

===United States===
The first locomotive built in the United States was the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, built by Norris Locomotive Works for the Philadelphia and Reading railroad in March 1847. There are still conflicting opinions as to who the original designer of this type was. Many authorities attribute the design to Septimus Norris of Norris Locomotive Works, but in an 1885 paper, George E. Sellers attributes the design to John Brandt who worked for the Erie Railroad between 1842 and 1851.
* According to Sellers, the Erie&#x27;s own management didn&#x27;t feel it in their best interests to pursue construction, so Brandt approached Baldwin Locomotive Works and Norris with the design. Baldwin was similarly uninterested, but Norris liked the idea. James Millholland of the Reading also saw the design and ordered one from Norris for the Reading. However, Sellers may have misinterpreted some of the information since Millholland did not work for the Reading until 1848, a year after the locomotive was built. Furthermore, Sellers refers to the first to be constructed as the &quot;Susquehanna&quot;, which was the Erie railroad&#x27;s first , not the Reading&#x27;s.
* The attribution to Septimus Norris stems from a patent, allegedly filed in 1846, that many sources cite for this locomotive type. However, such a patent has not yet been found in searches at the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). Septimus Norris did file a patent in 1854 for running gears, and the patent application showed a wheel arrangement in the drawing. Norris&#x27; wording in the 1854 patent was vague with regard to the wheel arrangement and the filing did not specifically claim invention of the configuration.

A few days after William Norris completed the &quot;Chesapeake&quot;, Hinkley Locomotive Works completed their first locomotive, the &quot;New Hampshire&quot;, for the Boston and Maine Railroad. The first from Rogers Locomotive and Machine Works was the already-mentioned &quot;Susquehanna&quot; for the Erie Railroad. Baldwin&#x27;s first locomotive did not appear until 1852.

Through the 1860s and into the 1870s, demand for locomotives of the wheel arrangement grew as more railroad executives switched from purchasing a single, general-purpose type of locomotive such as the 4-4-0 American at that time, to purchasing locomotives designed for a specific purpose. Both the Pennsylvania Railroad (PRR) and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad (B&amp;O) were early adopters of the , using them for fast freight as well as heavy passenger trains.

There were also two 3 ft narrow gauge steam locomotives, No. 72 (No. 274) and No. 73 (No. 275), built by the Baldwin Locomotive Works in May 1925 for the United Railways of Yucatán in Mexico, where they operated until being retired in the 1960s and were eventually purchased by Disney imagineers Roger E. Broggie and Earl Vilmer for $8,000 each to operate on the Walt Disney World Railroad circling the Magic Kingdom in Bay Lake, Florida. No. 274 became No. 1 &quot;Walter E. Disney&quot; and No. 275 became No. 3 &quot;Roger E. Broggie&quot;. Both locomotives have since been overhauled at the Strasburg Rail Road. No. 1 was overhauled between 2016 and 2020 and returned to service upon the reopening of the WDWRR on December 23, 2022, while No. 3 was overhauled between 2019 and 2023 and returned to service on February 21, 2024.

Sierra No. 3 is a built 1891 by Rogers, which after many years of service on the Prescott and Arizona Central and the Sierra Railway, found new life beginning in 1920 on screen. Sierra No. 3 has appeared in more motion pictures, documentaries and television shows than any other locomotive, and has a career ranging from &quot;The Virginian&quot; (1929) to &quot;High Noon&quot; (1952) to &quot;Back to the Future Part III&quot; (1990).
A notable American ten-wheeler is the Illinois Central Railroad&#x27;s No. 382, the locomotive driven by Casey Jones in a train wreck Vaughan, Mississippi, on April 30, 1900, that killed him instantly. But after an eventful career with 6 accidents, she was scrapped in July 1935 at the age of 37, the same age of her driver Casey Jones when he died. A Clinchfield Railroad locomotive of the type No. 99 replaced her in 1956 and is on display at the Casey Jones museum in Jackson, Tennessee.

As far as is known, the heaviest ever built was Southern Pacific No. 2371. According to R&amp;LHS Bulletin No. 94, its engine weight was . The heaviest class of &#x27;s ever put into series production was the Pennsylvania Railroad class G5 with 90 examples completed in the mid-1920s, which were some lighter.

One of the B&amp;O&#x27;s s, built in 1869, is preserved at the B&amp;O Railroad Museum in Baltimore. Another is at the National Museum of Transportation in St. Louis. A third, The Great Northern Railway&#x27;s GN 1355, built in 1909 as a but rebuilt to a 4-6-2 Pacific in 1924, is in Sioux City, Iowa.

Nevada Northern Railway&#x27;s No. 40 a 1910 built has been preserved on the railroad and is known by the nickname &quot;The Ghost Train of Ely&quot;. Due to its long history of operating in the state, in 2009 No. 40 was recognized as the official Nevada State Steam Locomotive.

The only surviving locomotive of the narrow gauge East Tennessee and Western North Carolina Railroad (ET&amp;WNC) is No. 12, a coal-fired built in 1917 by the Baldwin Locomotive Works. It was originally used to haul passengers and freight over the ET&amp;WNC&#x27;s line running from Johnson City over the Appalachian Mountains to Boone, North Carolina, from 1918 to 1940. Since 1957, it has been in operation at the Tweetsie Railroad theme park in Blowing Rock, North Carolina.

<text>Established in 1889, the Scottish Mountaineering Club is a club for climbing and mountaineering in Scotland.
==History==
The Scottish Mountaineering Club (SMC) was formed in Glasgow, Scotland, in March 1889, as one of Scotland&#x27;s first mountaineering clubs. The club was initially proposed by William Wilson Naismith, a Scottish accountant and mountaineer, who published a letter in the &quot;Glasgow Herald&quot; in January 1889 that suggested establishing a Scottish version of the Alpine Club. According to club records, the object of the SMC was: The purpose of the SMC was to document the exploration of the Scottish Highlands and its local flora and fauna. Soon after its inception, the SMC began publishing the &quot;Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal&quot; in 1890. The Journal provided their members and other alpine groups with lists of accommodations, guidebooks and maps of climbing areas.

In 1945, the SMC joined the British Mountaineer Council, a coalition of 25 alpine climbing clubs. The Club was responsible for overseeing the whole of Scotland.

==Affiliations==
In addition to climbing, the SMC promotes the wider interests of mountaineering in Scotland. 3 May 1963, the Club established the Scottish Mountaineering Trust (SMT), a charity, to promote and support health, education and recreation in the mountains of Scotland and elsewhere. The SMT is supported by the proceeds of guidebooks and other publications and donates back to groups, projects and individuals with the scientific or educational objectives of wildlife conservation and management. As of 2019 the Trust recontributed over 1.5 million euros.

SMT also operates and maintains five mountain huts which can be booked by members and other clubs from the UK and abroad. These huts are strategically placed near scenery in mountaineering areas in Scotland.

A subsidiary of the SMT is the Scottish Mountaineering Press (SMP), a publishing company, launched in 2020, that prints previous and current publications of the SMC. In 2022, the Press released the Scottish Mountaineering Press Creatives, a nonprofit, digital publication that produces online content for artists and authors. All profits from these publications are disbursed by the Trust as grants. The largest area of expenditure has been in supporting footpath repair and maintenance in the Scottish Mountains, although substantial support is also given to mountain rescue teams for equipment, facilities, mountaineering education and training, especially that aimed at young people.

==Membership==
Original membership to the club was strictly limited to elite male society. There were less than 100 founding members of the club. According to the 1894 Scottish Mountaineering Club Journal, to qualify for membership, a candidate had to list their Scottish ascents as proof of their climbing accomplishment, submit a statement of their &quot;contributions to science, art or literature in connection with Scottish mountains&quot;, and be sponsored by two members.

Women were first admitted to the Club in 1990.

Today, the SMC consists of competent climbers and mountaineers, both men and women, who have a commitment to climbing in Scotland. According to their official website, the criteria for membership in the SMC includes documented experience climbing in Scotland, in all seasons, over various types of terrains, with 50 or more ascents over . The application encourages participation in SMC projects or charities as well as a list of personal contributions to the arts and sciences. It must contain the sponsorship of a current member along with three other member references. There are around 500 members currently.

Some members are at the forefront of Scottish mountaineering developments:

* W. H. Murray was one of the preeminent mountaineers of the 1930s and wrote many books on climbing and mountaineering in Scotland. His book, &quot;Mountaineering in Scotland&quot;, published in 1947, is considered a classic of the genre. 
* Percy Unna, a keen conservationist, raised the funds to purchase Glen Coe and other highland areas, ultimately presenting them to the National Trust for Scotland in order to safeguard them for future generations. Percy conceived of &quot;The Unna Rules&quot; for the National Trust in 1937, detailing a guide for land conservation reform that continues to be influential today.
* Dougal Haston and Doug Scott were the first from the UK to successfully summit Mount Everest in 1975.
* Sir Hugh Munro catalogued the distinct 3000 foot mountains of Scotland, publishing his tables in the SMC journal in 1891. These mountains are now known as &quot;The Munros&quot; and &quot;Munro Baggers&quot; are people who focus on climbing them all.

==Compleators==
&quot;Compleator&quot; is the term that is bestowed upon someone by the SMC who has climbed all of the Munro mountains by the &quot;Clerk of the Lists&quot;. Compleat is an archaic spelling of the word complete. While complete means having all the required elements or skills, compleat has come to have its own distinct meaning, that of quintessential or perfectly representative. The usage of the designation &quot;Compleators&quot; by the SMC is traditional.

The SMC keeps a list of those who wish to record their compleation of the Munros and, As of 9 October 2023, there are 7,581 who have compleated. It also maintains Hill Lists for the Munro Tops, Furths, Corbetts and Donalds.

==Publishing==
Through the Trust and its imprint, Scottish Mountaineering Press, the Club produces and publishes the definitive Climbers&#x27; Guides to Scotland&#x27;s mountains and outcrops (17 books), the authoritative guides for hill-walkers and scramblers in Scotland (12 books) and a further 12 books on the Scottish mountain environment, its history and its culture, plus an annual Journal, copies of which are free to download from the Club&#x27;s website. The Munros Guide is the bestseller.

==Library==
The Club&#x27;s library is held within the Andersonian Library at the University of Strathclyde Archives and Special Collections. It contains historical and current publications by the Scottish Mountaineering Club and Scottish Mountaineering Trust from 1707 to date. In addition, there is a large collection of historical images relating to early SMC members and mountaineering in Scotland. According to SMC, the collection includes &quot;books on: technical and philosophical aspects of mountaineering, climbing, skiing, hill walking and other outdoor pursuits; fiction and literature; biographies and autobiographies; travel and exploration from across the world which includes an extensive collection of Scottish texts; history of mountaineering; antiquarian collection of 18th century Scottish travel and tour books&quot;.

Extensive archives can also be found at the National Library of Scotland.

<doc id="1085778" wikidata="Q2122861" url="?curid=1085778" title="Lamberhurst">
<text>Lamberhurst ( is a village and civil parish in the borough of Tunbridge Wells in Kent, England. The parish contains the hamlets of The Down and Hook Green. At the 2001 Census it had a population of 1,491, increasing to 1,706 at the 2011 Census.

==History==

The place-name &#x27;Lamberhurst&#x27; is first attested in the Textus Roffensis of circa 1100 AD, where it appears as &quot;Lamburherste&quot;. The name means &#x27;lambs&#x27; hill or wood&#x27;.

Prior to the Industrial Revolution, Lamberhurst was a centre for the Wealden iron industry, which was established in Roman times. Since then it has had some importance for hop-growing; been a weekend home to Margaret Thatcher; been controversially by-passed; and played a major role in English wine production.

Lamberhurst civil parish on formation, when such parishes first became possible in the 19th century, was in both Kent and East Sussex. The line of the county boundary was adjusted following the Local Government Act 1894, which required that parish boundaries be aligned with counties. The redrawing of the county boundary included transferring part of Bayham Lake so its entirety was in Kent.

==Geography and topography==
The village lies in the valley of the River Teise, one of the main tributaries of the River Medway. The valley of one of its tributaries, the River Bewl, was dammed and flooded between 1973 and 1975 creating the Bewl Water reservoir. The village itself has a large conservation area with many 17th- and 18th-century buildings, and the Strict Baptist Church, established in the village since the 18th century.

==Historically significant buildings and gardens==
To the west of the high street, The Broadway, are the ruins of Bayham Old Abbey, owned by English Heritage, and its replacement listed gardens and house, while to the east is the 14th-century Scotney Castle, a property of the National Trust. The moat and lake in the grounds of the latter are the result of a dam on the Sweetbourne stream.

St Mary&#x27;s Church is east of the village. It is a Grade I listed building and includes stained glass by John Piper.

==Transport==
The village was bypassed to the east in 2005 by the A21, which previously ran through the village. The decision caused some controversy due to its location in the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

The closest railway stations (both about 3 miles (4.8 km) distant) are Frant and Wadhurst on the north-south London to Hastings line. Most bus services are provided by Autocar with Hams Travel, with Hams Travel operating school service 2. Many services were operated by Countryliner until the operator ceased trading in 2013.

<text>Baldwin Street, in Dunedin, New Zealand, is located in the residential suburb of North East Valley, northeast of Dunedin&#x27;s central business district. &quot;Guinness World Records&quot; calls it the steepest street in the world, meaning no street gains more altitude in 10 horizontal metres (33 ft), measured along the street&#x27;s centreline.

==Description==

A straight street slightly under long, Baldwin Street runs east from the valley of the Lindsay Creek up the side of Signal Hill towards Opoho, rising from above sea level at its junction with North Road to above sea level at the top, an average slope of slightly more than 1:5. The lower reaches are only moderately steep, and the surface is asphalt, but the upper reaches are steeper and surfaced in concrete ( long) for ease of maintenance (bitumen—in either chip seal or asphalt—would flow down the slope on a warm day) and for safety in Dunedin&#x27;s frosty winters.

The top section climbs vertically, an average gradient of 1:3.41. At its maximum, about from the top, the slope of Baldwin Street is about 1:2.86 (19° or 35%); in travelled horizontally, the elevation changes by .

For cars it is a dead-end street, but Baldwin Street is linked across the top by Buchanan Street, a footpath following an otherwise unformed (i.e. unpaved) road linking it with Calder Avenue and Arnold Street, which are unformed in their upper reaches where Baldwin is steepest. The streets running parallel to Baldwin are all steep: Arnold Street (1:3.6 or 27.77%), Dalmeny Street (1:3.7 or 27%), and Calder Avenue (1:5.4 or 13%).

==History==

The street&#x27;s steepness was unintentional. As with many other parts of early Dunedin, and indeed New Zealand at large, streets were laid out in a grid pattern with no consideration for the terrain, usually by planners in London. In the case of Baldwin Street (and much of the Dunedin street plan), the layout was surveyed by Charles Kettle in the mid-19th century. The street is named after William Baldwin, an Otago Provincial Councillor and newspaper founder, who subdivided the area.

In 1987, Baldwin Street was recognised as the world&#x27;s steepest street by the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; following a two-year campaign by the broadcaster Jim Mora. At the time, Baldwin Street topped two competing streets in San Francisco, which hitherto had held the title of being the steepest streets in the world.

On 16 July 2019, Baldwin Street lost its title of World&#x27;s Steepest Street to Ffordd Pen Llech, with Baldwin Street being at a gradient of 35%, while Ffordd Pen Llech being classified at a gradient of 37.45%. Mayor of Dunedin Dave Cull said that the Dunedin City Council could consider altering the signage wording from the world&#x27;s steepest street to the southern hemisphere&#x27;s steepest street. 

On 8 April 2020, after an extensive review of an appeal to return the title to Baldwin Street filed by several Dunedin residents led by surveyor Toby Stoff, Guinness decided that the steepness of the street must be based on the central axis, which meant that Ffordd Pen Llech had a gradient of 28.6% compared to Baldwin Street&#x27;s 34.8%. This meant that the title of Steepest Street was returned to Baldwin Street.

== Resident reception ==
After recognition as the world&#x27;s steepest street, especially with the rise of social media, tourism activity and events at Baldwin Street have greatly increased. The street is a popular destination on tourist buses and travel guides.

Residents have mixed reception to tourist activity on the street. Many residents reported issues with some tourists being disruptive by walking in residents&#x27; gardens, lying down on the street, and being unable to turn their vehicles. Other residents have more positive thoughts, enjoying the busy activity and excitement of living on the street.

On Ffordd Pen Llech temporarily being named the world&#x27;s steepest street, and a predicted decline in tourists to Baldwin Street, Otago Chamber of Commerce chief executive Dougal McGowan remarked that &quot;it might be a blessing in disguise for some residents fed up with crowds of visitors, trampled gardens and bad driving decisions on the street.&quot;

==Associated events and vehicle stunts==

Baldwin Street has attracted a lot of record hunters and daredevils attempting to either ascend or descend the street on different kinds of vehicles. Some of these attempts have been sanctioned, while others have not, including at least one fatality from misadventure. In March 2001, a 19-year-old University of Otago student was killed when she and another student attempted to travel down the street inside a wheelie bin. The bin collided with a parked trailer, killing her instantly, and causing serious head injuries for the other student.

Additionally, the street is the venue for an annual event in Dunedin, the &quot;Baldwin Street Gutbuster&quot;. Every summer since 1988, this exercise in fitness and balance involves athletes running from the base of the street to the top and back down again. The event attracts several hundred competitors annually, and the race record is 1 minute and 56 seconds, set in 1998.

Since 2002, a further charity event has been held annually in July, which involves the rolling of over 30,000 Jaffas (spherical confectionery-coated chocolate confectionery). Each Jaffa is sponsored by one person, with prizes to the winner and funds raised going to charity. This event follows a tradition started in 1998 when 2,000 tennis balls were released in a sponsored event raising money for Habitat for Humanity.

On 2 January 2010, Cardrona stuntman Ian Soanes rode down Baldwin Street on a motorcycle on one wheel. He then did a victory lap doing a wheelie up the hill one-handed while giving a thumbs-up gesture to the spectating crowd.

In April 2015, under controlled conditions, a trio of drift trike riders—Harley Jolly, 23; Tyson Barr, 18; and Nic Roy, 18—made headlines when they descended the street with speeds estimated to be up to 100 km/h (62 mph) to promote the sport. The estimated speed was approximately twice Baldwin Street&#x27;s 50 km/h (31 mph) legal speed limit.

In 2017, Wyn Masters (also known as Wyn TV) performed a wheelie (in the form of a manual—that is, gravity power instead of pedalling) down the hill on a bicycle.

On 26 January 2018, 11-year-old Harry Willis raised over NZD$11,000 for the Ronald McDonald House in Christchurch by ascending the street on a pogo stick. The climb took around ten minutes. Willis&#x27;s effort has since been commemorated with a plaque at the top of the street.

On 10 January 2019, a man rode a Lime scooter down Baldwin Street the same day that the scooters had been introduced to Dunedin and a week after Dunedin&#x27;s mayor at the time, Dave Cull, had said he was relying &quot;on people&#x27;s common sense&quot; not to take the scooters down the world&#x27;s steepest street.

In August 2022, under controlled conditions, Australian downhill skater Zak Mills-Goodwin became the first person captured on video to hill bomb the street on a skateboard (i.e. not doing slides, which reduce speed).

After many years of ideation and attempts, an attempt at cycling up the street was made by American YouTuber and cyclist Mitch Boyer circa April 2023 after hearing about a New Zealand TV news report (which aired on the programme &quot;Seven Sharp&quot;) on his filmed ascent on the then-current street steepness world record holder of Ffordd Pen Llech. One of the show&#x27;s co-hosts, Hilary Barry, said: &quot;If you can cycle up it, it&#x27;s not the world&#x27;s steepest street&quot;. Upon learning that Boyer was making the 30-hour trip to attempt the challenge and playfully make Barry regret her words, she offered to help film the attempts for their show. After two failed attempts, Boyer managed to scale the street, sometimes deploying a zigzagging technique (a self-imposed restriction he later discarded after the second attempt due to difficulty). He used a chainring of 52–36 and a cassette of 11–34 to get a minimum gear ratio of 1.058, including optimising the tyres for weight.

Other steep streets include:
*A street in Stilfs in South Tyrol (Italy) has a 40% gradient as indicated by the street sign. This is a residential street and a cul-de-sac.
*The Côte St-Ange in Chicoutimi, Quebec, Canada, with an alleged 33% gradient (about 18°). However, this again appears to be down to confusion between slope angle and percentage grade; the street is signed as having an 18% grade.
*Canton Avenue, in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States; it is officially measured to be a 37% grade. However, that angle of 37% only extends about , whereas Baldwin Street&#x27;s steepest part stretches considerably farther.
*Eldred Street in Los Angeles, United States; one of three streets in Los Angeles between 32% and 33.3%.
*Filbert and 22nd Streets in San Francisco, California, United States, each have 31 to 31.5% (17°) for . Several short pieces of San Francisco streets are steeper, including a 9-metre section of Bradford street paved in 2010 that averages 39–40% grade.
*Waipio Valley Road () on the island of Hawaii. As measured by Stephen Von Worley, the road has long sections that measure 30% with peak gradients much higher; some areas up to 45%. This is a paved public road but it is not a residential street and is open only to 4 wheel drive vehicles.
* Ffordd Pen Llech in Harlech, Wales, has a reported slope of 36.6% (rounded to 40% on the warning sign).
* Muro di Sormano (&quot;Wall of Sormano&quot;) is a well-known cycling stage in Northern Italy, with a maximum gradient of 27%, included in the Giro di Lombardia cycling race.
* Paso Florentino in Mexico City has a reported slope of 45%. Car accidents happen frequently on the street because of the inclination.

Many streets in the west of England and in Wales have reported slopes of 33% and higher. Vale Street in Bristol is often also reported as the steepest street in Britain (21.81°/40.02%) and hence may have a slope even steeper than 36.6%. However, these roads are mostly shorter roads than those listed above, with far more frequent turns as opposed to the straight path of Baldwin.

<text>John Weldon (6 September 1890 – 4 February 1963; alternatively &quot;A. E. Weldon&quot;), known by his pen- and stage-name Brinsley MacNamara, was an Irish writer, playwright, and the registrar of the National Gallery of Ireland. He is the author of several novels, the most well-known of which was his first, &quot;The Valley of the Squinting Windows&quot; (1918). His acting career with the Abbey Theatre began in September 1910 with a role in R. J. Ryan&#x27;s &quot;The Casting-out of Martin Whelan&quot;.

MacNamara is still best known for his first novel, &quot;The Valley of the Squinting Windows&quot;, set in a fictional village called Garradrimna, which caused a furore in his native Westmeath on its publication. He continued to write for many years after this controversial first work, and located most of his later fiction in Garradrimna, in the Irish Midlands. Among his plays are &quot;The Glorious Uncertainty&quot; (1923) and &quot;Look at the Heffernans!&quot; (1926). His work was part of the literature event in the art competition at the 1924 Summer Olympics.

MacNamara married Helena Degidon, a schoolteacher, in 1920. He died at his home on Gilford Drive in Sandymount, County Dublin in February 1963.

<text>The Yamnaya culture or the Yamna culture, also known as the Pit Grave culture or Ochre Grave culture, is a late Copper Age to early Bronze Age archaeological culture of the region between the Southern Bug, Dniester, and Ural rivers (the Pontic–Caspian steppe), dating to 3300–2600 BC. It was discovered by Vasily Gorodtsov following his archaeological excavations near the Donets River in 1901–1903. Its name derives from its characteristic burial tradition: (romanization: ) is a Russian adjective that means &#x27;related to pits ()&#x27;, as these people used to bury their dead in tumuli (kurgans) containing simple pit chambers. Research in recent years has found that Mykhailivka, on the lower Dnieper River, Ukraine, formed the core Yamnaya culture (c. 3600–3400 BC).

The Yamnaya economy was based upon animal husbandry, fishing, and foraging, and the manufacture of ceramics, tools, and weapons. The people of the Yamnaya culture lived primarily as nomads, with a chiefdom system and wheeled carts and wagons that allowed them to manage large herds. They are also closely connected to Final Neolithic cultures, which later spread throughout Europe and Central Asia, especially the Corded Ware people and the Bell Beaker culture, as well as the peoples of the Sintashta, Andronovo, and Srubnaya cultures. Back migration from Corded Ware also contributed to Sintashta and Andronovo. In these groups, several aspects of the Yamnaya culture are present. Yamnaya material culture was very similar to the Afanasievo culture of South Siberia, and the populations of the two cultures are genetically indistinguishable. This suggests that the Afanasievo culture may have originated from the migration of Yamnaya groups to the Altai region or, alternatively, that both cultures developed from an earlier shared cultural source.

Genetic studies have suggested that the people of the Yamnaya culture can be modelled as a genetic admixture between a population related to Eastern European Hunter-Gatherers (EHG) and people related to hunter-gatherers from the Caucasus (CHG) in roughly equal proportions, an ancestral component which is often named &quot;Steppe ancestry&quot;, with additional admixture from Anatolian, Levantine, or Early European farmers. Genetic studies also indicate that populations associated with the Corded Ware, Bell Beaker, Sintashta, and Andronovo cultures derived large parts of their ancestry from the Yamnaya or a closely related population. Recent genetic analyses indicate that the Anatolian component in the Yamnaya comes via the Caucasus Neolithic population and not Anatolia-derived European farmers.

The Yamnaya culture is of particular interest to researchers, as the widely-accepted Kurgan hypothesis posits that the people that produced the Yamnaya culture spoke a stage of the Proto-Indo-European language. The speakers of the Proto-Indo-European language embarked on the Indo-European migrations, that gave rise to the Indo-European languages of today.

== Origins ==
The Yamnaya culture was defined by Vasily Gorodtsov in order to differentiate it from the Catacomb and Srubnaya cultures that existed in the area, but were considered to be of a later period. Due to the time interval to the Yamnaya culture, and the reliance on archaeological findings, debate as to its origin is ongoing. In 1996, Pavel Dolukhanov suggested that the emergence of the Pit-Grave culture represents a social development of various different local Bronze Age cultures, thus representing &quot;an expression of social stratification and the emergence of chiefdom-type nomadic social structures&quot; which in turn intensified inter-group contacts between essentially heterogeneous social groups.

The origin of the Yamnaya culture continues to be debated, with proposals for its origins pointing to both the Khvalynsk and Sredny Stog cultures. The Khvalynsk culture (4700–3800 BC) (middle Volga) and the Don-based Repin culture (–3300 BC) in the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe, and the closely related Sredny Stog culture (–3500 BC) in the western Pontic-Caspian steppe, preceded the Yamnaya culture (3300–2500 BC).

Further efforts to pinpoint the location came from Anthony (2007), who suggested that the Yamnaya culture (3300–2600 BC) originated in the Don–Volga area at , preceded by the middle Volga-based Khvalynsk culture and the Don-based Repin culture (–3300 BC), arguing that late pottery from these two cultures can barely be distinguished from early Yamnaya pottery. Earlier continuity from eneolithic but largely hunter-gatherer Samara culture and influences from the more agricultural Dnieper–Donets II are apparent.

He argues that the early Yamnaya horizon spread quickly across the Pontic–Caspian steppes between and 3200 BC:
Alternatively, Parpola (2015) relates both the Corded ware culture and the Yamnaya culture to the late Trypillia (Tripolye) culture. He hypothesizes that &quot;the Tripolye culture was taken over by PIE speakers by c. 4000 BC,&quot; and that in its final phase the Trypillian culture expanded to the steppes, morphing into various regional cultures which fused with the late Sredny Stog (Serednii Stih) pastoralist cultures, which, he suggests, gave rise to the Yamnaya culture. Dmytro Telegin viewed Sredny Stog and Yamnaya as one cultural continuum and considered Sredny Stog to be the genetic foundation of the Yamna. Telegin&#x27;s view has been recently confirmed by genetic analyses.
The Yamnaya culture was succeeded in its western range by the Catacomb culture (2800–2200 BC); in the east, by the Poltavka culture (2700–2100 BC) at the middle Volga. These two cultures were followed by the Srubnaya culture (18th–12th century BC).

== Characteristics ==

The Yamnaya culture was nomadic or semi-nomadic, with some agriculture practiced near rivers, and a few fortified sites, the largest of which is Mikhaylivka.

Characteristic of the culture are the burials in pit graves surmounted by kurgans (tumuli), often accompanied by animal offerings. Some graves contain large anthropomorphic stelae, with carved human heads, arms, hands, belts, and weapons. The bodies were placed in a supine position with bent knees and covered in ochre. Some kurgans contained &quot;stratified sequences of graves&quot;. Kurgan burials may have been rare, and were perhaps reserved for special adults, who were predominantly, but not necessarily, male. Status and gender are marked by grave goods and position, and in some areas, elite individuals are buried with complete wooden wagons. Grave goods are more common in eastern Yamnaya burials, which are also characterized by a higher proportion of male burials and more male-centred rituals than western areas.

The Yamnaya culture had and used two-wheeled carts and four-wheeled wagons, which are thought to have been oxen-drawn at this time, and there is evidence that they rode horses. For instance, several Yamnaya skeletons exhibit specific characteristics in their bone morphology that may have been caused by long-term horseriding. The evidence is disputed by archaeozoologist William T. Taylor, who argues that domestication of the horse long postdates the Yamnaya culture. Recent genetic studies indicate that horse domestication in Eurasia happened after ca. 2700 BCE.

Metallurgists and other craftsmen are given a special status in Yamnaya society, and metal objects are sometimes found in large quantities in elite graves. New metalworking technologies and weapon designs are used.

Stable isotope ratios of Yamnaya individuals from the Dnipro Valley suggest the Yamnaya diet was terrestrial protein based with insignificant contribution from freshwater or aquatic resources. Anthony speculates that the Yamnaya ate meat, milk, yogurt, cheese, and soups made from seeds and wild vegetables, and probably consumed mead.

Mallory and Adams suggest that Yamnaya society may have had a tripartite structure of three differentiated social classes, although the evidence available does not demonstrate the existence of specific classes such as priests, warriors, and farmers.

== Archaeogenetics ==

According to Jones et al. (2015) and Haak et al. (2015), autosomal tests indicate that the Yamnaya people were the result of a genetic admixture between two different hunter-gatherer populations: distinctive &quot;Eastern Hunter-Gatherers&quot; (EHG), from Eastern Europe, with high affinity to the Mal&#x27;ta–Buret&#x27; culture or other, closely related people from Siberia and a population of &quot;Caucasus hunter-gatherers&quot; (CHG) who probably arrived from the Caucasus or Iran. Each of those two populations contributed about half the Yamnaya DNA. This admixture is referred to in archaeogenetics as Western Steppe Herder (WSH) ancestry.

Admixture between EHGs and CHGs is believed to have occurred on the eastern Pontic-Caspian steppe starting around 5,000 BC, while admixture with Early European Farmers (EEF) happened in the southern parts of the Pontic-Caspian steppe sometime later. More recent genetic studies have found that the Yamnaya were a mixture of EHGs, CHGs, and to a lesser degree Anatolian farmers and Levantine farmers, but not EEFs from Europe due to lack of WHG DNA in the Yamnaya. This occurred in two distinct admixture events from West Asia into the Pontic-Caspian steppe.

Haplogroup R1b, specifically the Z2103 subclade of R1b-L23, is the most common Y-DNA haplogroup found among the Yamnaya specimens. This haplogroup is rare in Western Europe and mainly exists in Southeastern Europe today. Additionally, a minority are found to belong to haplogroup I2. They are found to belong to a wider variety of West Eurasian mtDNA haplogroups, including U, T, and haplogroups associated with Caucasus Hunter-Gatherers and Early European Farmers. A small but significant number of Yamnaya kurgan specimens from Northern Ukraine carried the East Asian mtDNA haplogroup C4.

People of the Yamnaya culture are believed to have had mostly brown eye colour, light to intermediate skin, and brown hair colour, with some variation. 

Some Yamnaya individuals are believed to have carried a mutation to the KITLG gene associated with blond hair, as several individuals with Steppe ancestry are later found to carry this mutation. The Ancient North Eurasian Afontova Gora group, who contributed significant ancestry to Western Steppe Herders, are believed to be the source of this mutation. A study in 2015 found that Yamnaya had the highest ever calculated genetic selection for height of any of the ancient populations tested. It has been hypothesized that an allele associated with lactase persistence (conferring lactose tolerance into adulthood) was brought to Europe from the steppe by Yamnaya-related migrations.

A 2022 study by Lazaridis et al. found that the typical phenotype among the Yamnaya population was brown eyes, brown hair, and intermediate skin colour. None of their Yamnaya samples were predicted to have either blue eyes or blond hair, in contrast with later Steppe groups in Russia and Central Asia, as well as the Bell Beaker culture in Europe, who did carry these phenotypes in significant proportions. 

The geneticist David Reich has argued that the genetic data supports the likelihood that the people of the Yamnaya culture were a &quot;single, genetically coherent group&quot; who were responsible for spreading many Indo-European languages. Reich&#x27;s group recently suggested that the source of Anatolian and Indo-European subfamilies of the Proto-Indo-European (PIE) language may have been in west Asia and the Yamnaya were responsible for the dissemination of the latter. Reich also argues that the genetic evidence shows that Yamnaya society was an oligarchy dominated by a small number of elite males. Recent (2024 and 2025) publications confirmed the tight clustering of most of Yamnaya genetic profiles, but shifted the origins of PIE towards the Caucasus-Lower Volga (CLV) region.

The genetic evidence for the extent of the role of the Yamnaya culture in the spread of Indo-European languages has been questioned by Russian archaeologist Leo Klejn and Balanovsky et al., who note a lack of male haplogroup continuity between the people of the Yamnaya culture and the contemporary populations of Europe. Klejn has also suggested that the autosomal evidence does not support a Yamnaya migration, arguing that Western Steppe Herder ancestry in both contemporary and Bronze Age samples is lowest around the Danube in Hungary, near the western limits of the Yamnaya culture, and highest in Northern Europe, which Klejn argues is the opposite of what would be expected if the geneticists&#x27; hypothesis is correct.

== Language ==
Marija Gimbutas identified the Yamnaya culture with the late Proto-Indo-Europeans (PIE) in her Kurgan hypothesis. In the view of David Anthony, the Pontic-Caspian steppe is the strongest candidate for the &quot;Urheimat&quot; (original homeland) of the Proto-Indo-European language, citing evidence from linguistics and genetics which suggests that the Yamnaya culture may be the homeland of the Indo-European languages, with the possible exception of the Anatolian languages. On the other hand, Colin Renfrew has argued for a Near Eastern origin of the earliest Indo-European speakers.

According to David W. Anthony, the genetic evidence suggests that the leading clans of the Yamnaya were of EHG (Eastern European hunter-gatherer) and WHG (Western European hunter-gatherer) paternal origin and implies that the Indo-European languages were the result of &quot;a dominant language spoken by EHGs that absorbed Caucasus-like elements in phonology, morphology, and lexicon.&quot; It has also been suggested that the PIE language evolved through trade interactions in the circum-Pontic area in the 4th millennium BC, mediated by the Yamnaya predecessors in the North Pontic steppe.

Guus Kroonen et al. 2022 found that the &quot;basal Indo-European stage&quot;, also known as Indo-Anatolian or Pre-Proto-Indo-European language, largely but not totally, lacked agricultural-related vocabulary, and only the later &quot;core Indo-European languages&quot; saw an increase in agriculture-associated words. According to them, this fits a homeland of early core Indo-European within the westernmost Yamnaya horizon, around and west of the Dnieper, while its basal stage, Indo-Anatolian, may have originated in the Sredny Stog culture, as opposed to the eastern Yamnaya horizon. The Corded Ware culture may have acted as major source for the spread of later Indo-European languages, including Indo-Iranian, while Tocharian languages may have been mediated via the Catacomb culture. They also argue that this new data contradicts a possible earlier origin of Pre-Proto-Indo-European among agricultural societies South of the Caucasus, rather &quot;this may support a scenario of linguistic continuity of local non-mobile herders in the Lower Dnieper region and their genetic persistence after their integration into the successive and expansive Yamnaya horizon&quot;. Furthermore the authors mention that this scenario can explain the difference in paternal haplogroup frequency between the Yamnaya and Corded Ware cultures, while both sharing similar autosomal DNA ancestry.

== Yamnaya-related migrations ==

=== Western Europe ===

Genetic studies have found that Yamnaya autosomal characteristics are very close to the Corded Ware culture people, with up to 75% Yamnaya-like ancestry in the DNA of Corded Ware skeletons from Central and Eastern Europe. Yamnaya–related ancestry is found in the DNA of modern Central, and Northern Europeans (c. 38.8–50.4 %), and is also found in lower levels in present-day Southern Europeans (c. 18.5–32.6 %), Sardinians (c. 2.4–7.1 %), and Sicilians (c. 5.9–11.6 %).

However, according to Heyd, et al. (2023), the specific paternal DNA haplogroup that is most commonly found in male Yamnaya specimens cannot be found in modern Western Europeans, or in males from the nearby Corded Ware culture. This makes it unlikely that the Corded Ware culture can be directly descended from the Yamnaya culture, at least along the paternal line.

Autosomal tests also indicate that the Yamnaya are the vector for &quot;Ancient North Eurasian&quot; admixture into Europe. &quot;Ancient North Eurasian&quot; is the name given in literature to a genetic component that represents descent from the people of the Mal&#x27;ta–Buret&#x27; culture or a population closely related to them. That genetic component is visible in tests of the Yamnaya people as well as modern-day Europeans.

=== Eastern Europe and Finland ===

In the Baltic, Jones et al. (2017) found that the Neolithic transition – the passage from a hunter-gatherer economy to a farming-based economy – coincided with the arrival en masse of individuals with Yamnaya-like ancestry. This is different from what happened in Western and Southern Europe, where the Neolithic transition was caused by a population that came from Anatolia, with Pontic steppe ancestry being detected from only the late Neolithic onward.

Per Haak et al. (2015), the Yamnaya contribution in the modern populations of Eastern Europe ranges from 46.8% among Russians to 42.8% in Ukrainians. Finland has the highest Yamnaya contributions in all of Europe (50.4%).

=== Central and South Asia ===


There is a significant presence of Yamnaya descent in the nations of South Asia, especially in groups that are referred to as Indo-Aryans. Lazaridis et al. (2016) estimated (6.5–50.2 %) steppe-related admixture in South Asians, though the proportion of Steppe ancestry varies widely across ethnic groups. According to Pathak et al. (2018), the &quot;North-Western Indian &amp; Pakistani&quot; populations (PNWI) showed significant Middle-Late Bronze Age Steppe (Steppe_MLBA) ancestry along with Yamnaya Early-Middle Bronze Age (Steppe_EMBA) ancestry, but the Indo-Europeans of Gangetic Plains and Dravidian people only showed significant Yamnaya (Steppe_EMBA) ancestry and no Steppe_MLBA. The study also noted that ancient south Asian samples had significantly higher Steppe_MLBA than Steppe_EMBA (or Yamnaya). According to Narasimhan et al. (2019), the Yamnaya-related ancestry, termed Western_Steppe_EMBA, that reached central and south Asia was not the initial expansion from the steppe to the east, but a secondary expansion that involved a group possessing ~67% Western_Steppe_EMBA ancestry and ~33% ancestry from the European cline. This group included people similar to that of Corded Ware, Srubnaya, Petrovka, and Sintashta. Moving further east in the central steppe, it acquired ~9% ancestry from a group of people that possessed West Siberian Hunter Gatherer ancestry, thus forming the Central Steppe MLBA cluster, which is the primary source of steppe ancestry in South Asia, contributing up to 30% of the ancestry of the modern groups in the region.

According to Unterländer et al. (2017), all Iron Age Scythian Steppe nomads can best be described as a mixture of Yamnaya-related ancestry and an East Asian-related component, which most closely corresponds to the modern North Siberian Nganasan people of the lower Yenisey River, to varying degrees, but generally higher among Eastern Scythians.

<text>The Indian People&#x27;s Front (IPF) was a mass front organisation founded in Delhi between 24–26 April 1982. It was conceptualised by Vinod Mishra and it was operated as the open mass front of the CPIML Liberation between 1982–1994. The front primarily worked for the social and economic upliftment of Adivasis, Dalits and impoverished sections of society and mobilised them through the means of unions, rallies and conventions.

It had a significant presence in the state of Bihar (including present day Jharkhand) and also operated in the states of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Punjab and West Bengal attempting to project itself as a national party. It was disbanded when the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation began contesting elections on its own, inheriting its organisation.

The leadership of the front included Nagbhushan Patnaik and Dipankar Bhattacharya. The chairperson of the Autonomous State Demand Committee, Jayanta Rongpi was also a member of the central committee. The central committee also included Rameshwar Prasad and Ganauri Azad Harijan, among others.

== History ==

=== Foundation ===
In 1979, the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation held a conference which sanctioned the formation of an open mass organisation. The idea was conceptualized by the general secretary Vinod Mishra to enable the party to organise with other democratic forces on the lines of a &quot;popular, democratic and patriotic programme&quot; and participate in electoral politics. The party had been underground since the imposition of the Emergency in India. The Indian People&#x27;s Front was launched in a conference organised by the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation which was held in Delhi between 24–26 April 1982. The conference was attended by the splinter factions of the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) led by Nagbhushan Patnaik and Chandra Pulla Reddy. It was intended to project itself as a &quot;national alternative&quot; to the Indira Gandhi led Indian National Congress. In the beginning, the front was projected as a united front of different revolutionary groups but most other factions dropped out during its formation and it effectively became a mass organisation of the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation. Satyanarayan Singh publicly denounced and ridiculed the notion of the front becoming a &quot;national alternative&quot;. On 15 October 1982, the front organised a mass rally against the Bihar Press Bill which witnessed a participation of 100,000 people according to mainstream media sources.

=== Second conference ===
The Indian People&#x27;s Front (IPF) held its second conference in Kolkata between 4–6 November 1984, in midst of the turmoil following the assassination of Indira Gandhi. It contested 49 seats in the 1985 Bihar Legislative Assembly election but failed to win a single seat. On 19 April 1986, the police opened fire on a protest gathering of landless farmers (primarily dalits) which resulted in the deaths of 23 people in Arwal, Bihar. Civil rights activists described the massacre as part of a systematic eradication of the moblisation of impoverished people by branding them as &quot;Naxalite&quot; and killing them in police encounters in collaboration with private armies and militias of rich &quot;zamindars&quot; (landlords) such as the Ranvir Sena. In August, the IPF organised an armed &quot;gherao&quot; (picketing) of the Bihar Legislative Assembly in protest of the massacre. The protest is claimed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation, to mark a new phase in the assertiveness of revolutionary democratic forces. In the same year, the front organised a &quot;national convention of women&quot; in Kolkata which saw a participation of around 1000 women. The convention took the initiative of giving attention to women&#x27;s issues while attempting to foster cooperation and synthesis between communist women&#x27;s organisations and autonomous women&#x27;s groups. In an address to the convention, the president of the women&#x27;s cell of the front stated that feminism and Marxism were complementary ideologies. The front also organised an &quot;all India worker&#x27;s convention&quot; in Ambernath, near Mumbai in November 1987, with trade union leader Datta Samant as the convener.

=== Mandal commission &amp; Economic liberalisation ===
In the 1989 Indian general election, the Indian People&#x27;s Front (IPF) was able to win the Arrah constituency in Bihar with Rameshwar Prasad as the candidate. It was also able to win 7 seats and secure the second highest vote share in 14 constituencies in the 1990 Bihar Legislative Assembly election. Over the years, the front had acquired a large share of the Scheduled Caste voters from the Indian National Congress in Bihar. It took the position of supporting reservations solely on the basis of social and educational backwardness and supported the implementation of the recommendations of the Mandal Commission. In the 1990 election, the IPF had contested 82 seats and received a vote share of 10.56% on the contested seats. During the economic liberalisation in India, it launched campaigns against price hikes and for the right to work, adopting a traditional leftist discourse. On 8 October 1990, a national rally with the slogan of &quot;dam bandho kaam do&quot; (check prices and give jobs) was organised in Delhi by the front. In the same month, it organised a mass rally in Patna which was noted to be the largest rally in the recorded history of the city.

In the 1991 Indian general election, the IPF lost the seat of Arrah constituency but was able to send a member to the parliament (Jayanta Rongpi) through the Autonomous State Demand Committee in the Karbi Anglong constituency. In the same year, four of its members in the Bihar Legislative Assembly defected to the Janata Dal under the leadership of Lalu Prasad Yadav at the height of polarisation on the Mandal issue. In Uttar Pradesh, the party publication &quot;Liberation&quot; accused the Samajwadi Party of targeting the cadre and lower caste support base of the Indian People&#x27;s Front with state violence and then providing them with protection if they defected preventing it from successfully organising the way it had in Bihar. On 14 February 1992, in the wake of rising Hindu nationalism in India, the Bharatiya Kisan Sangh (farmer&#x27;s union affiliated to the Bharatiya Janata Party) killed 14 Scheduled caste landless labourers for supporting the Indian People&#x27;s Front in Tikshora village near Patna. At the same time, the front was able to expand its footprint in Punjab when its candidate Surjan Singh Joga won the Joga constituency in the 1992 Punjab Legislative Assembly election.

=== Disbandment ===
In December 1992, the Communist Party of India (Marxist–Leninist) Liberation held its fifth congress in Kolkata. Following which the party came out of the underground and eventually disbanded the Indian People&#x27;s Front in 1994. The &quot;Samajik Parivartan Rally&quot; (Social Change Rally) on 18 March 1994, was the last rally called by the front. The rally was reported to been a gathering of tens of thousands of bare-footed and starving workers who had marched to Patna from all over Bihar; some having traveled over on foot to reach the venue. At the time, political observers described the front to be the fastest growing leftist movement in India. From 1995 onward the party began contesting elections on its own, substituting the role of the former front.

==Affiliated organisations==
The Indian People&#x27;s Front (IPF) had a number of unorganised sector unions in Bihar.

* Rickshaw-Thela Chalak Mazdoor Sangha (RTCMS): a union of rickshaw and handcart drivers. Ganauri Azad Harijan was the president of the union and a member of the national executive of the Indian People&#x27;s Front.
* Bihar Jhuggi-Jhopri Bashi Sangha (BJJBS): an organisation of slum dwellers in Patna. Dinesh Singh was a fish seller and the president of the BJJBS.
*Uttarakhand Popular Anti-Liquor Movement: The movement for the restriction and regulation of liquor sales in Uttarakhand was also affiliated to the IPF from the founding conference.

<text>Larnach Castle (also referred to as &quot;Larnach&#x27;s Castle&quot;) is a mock castle on the ridge of the Otago Peninsula within the limits of the city of Dunedin, New Zealand, close to the small settlement of Pukehiki. It is one of a few houses of this scale in New Zealand. The house was built by the prominent entrepreneur and politician, William Larnach. Since 1967, the castle has been privately owned by the Barker family, and opened as a tourist attraction, as &quot;New Zealand&#x27;s only castle&quot;.

The castle and grounds are open daily to members of the public. The Larnach Castle gardens are one of only five gardens nationwide to have been given the rating of &quot;Garden of International Significance&quot; by the New Zealand Gardens Trust. These were the first gardens in the South Island to receive the title. In 2018, Larnach Castle was designated a New Zealand Landmark by Heritage New Zealand.

== History ==

=== Construction and style ===
Larnach Castle was built as the private residence of William James Mudie Larnach. Land for the construction of Larnach Castle was purchased in 1870, and prominent Dunedin architect R.A. Lawson was selected to design the Gothic Revival mansion. The site was clear-felled and levelled, allowing construction to begin in 1871. To level the construction site, workers jammed pegs into the layers of volcanic rock before pouring cold salt water to split the surface. Approximately 200 workmen were used to complete the main structure, using imported materials from around the world. Much of the stone used for the Castle came from a basalt quarry nearby. Other materials included yellow brick, Glasgow brick, Oamaru stone, Port Chalmers basalt, Cornwall blackstone, Italian marble, Marseilles cobbles, Catlins timber, North Island Kauri and local Caversham sandstone for the ballroom. The Godfrey family carved many of the building&#x27;s intricate ceilings; a single ceiling in the main foyer took six and half years to complete. In 1875, twenty tonne of glass was imported from Venice, in an effort to enclose exposed verandahs unsuitable for Dunedin winters. The addition of the 3000 square foot ballroom was completed in 1887 as a 21st birthday present for Larnach&#x27;s eldest daughter Kate. The resulting complex eventually contained 43 rooms and required a staff of 46 servants. The complex included 35 acres reserved for grounds, including a vinery, and a home farm of 300 acres with its own farmstead including a cow byre for 300 cows, stables, and quarters for farm workers.

=== Home of the Larnach family ===

The building, which Larnach himself simply called &quot;The Camp&quot;, was coined a &quot;castle&quot; by local press on 8 December 1874, a few days after William and wife Eliza moved in. After a series of personal and financial setbacks he died by suicide in New Zealand&#x27;s Parliament Buildings in October 1898. Following bitter legal battles over Larnach&#x27;s will, the Larnach family sold the house in 1906.

=== Reputation as haunted house ===
Larnach Castle has a reputation as one of New Zealand&#x27;s most haunted buildings, with accounts of sightings of the ghost of a bearded Victorian gentleman (presumably Larnach himself), unexplained smells of cigar smoke and port in unoccupied rooms, and visitors and workers at the castle feeling as if they have been suddenly pushed in the back. These tales have drawn paranormal investigators from both New Zealand and overseas, with the location appearing on various &quot;ghost hunter&quot; television programmes from both New Zealand and the United States.

== Modern history ==

=== Restoration ===

Throughout the twentieth century Larnach Castle went through constant changes of ownership and usage. The building fell into disrepair, and in 1967 was bought by Barry and Margaret Barker. Norcombe Barker became Larnach Castle Executive Director in 1990. Significant restoration work has since been carried out by the Barker family, along with retrieval of original furniture to refurnish the house. The gardens were not an original feature of William Larnach&#x27;s home, and have been awarded &quot;Garden of International Significance&quot; status by the New Zealand Gardens Trust. Funded by its tourism operation, upkeep of the building is a continuous operation—in 2015 the music room underwent a $100,000 refurbishment.

In 2013, a direct descendant of William Larnach proposed to her spouse at the Castle.

=== Tourism ===

Larnach Castle operates as a significant tourist attraction in Dunedin, receiving approximately 120,000 guests per annum. The castle is open to the public 365 days a year; offering guided and self-guided tours, events and accommodation. The Castle regularly hosts in-house events; notably their annual Winter Ball. Larnach Castle Ltd operates three accommodation types; Larnach Castle Stables, Larnach Castle Lodge and the nearby luxury accommodation Camp Estate. Guests staying in accommodation are offered the opportunity to dine inside the Castle.

=== Appearances ===

In 1985 it was used as a location for the filming of the TVNZ Dunedin production &quot;Hanlon&quot;. The same year, it was used in the introductory scenes in the US-New Zealand film co-production, &quot;Shaker Run&quot;.

In 1994, a play about the Larnach family tragedies, titled &quot;Castle of Lies&quot;, was performed by Dunedin&#x27;s Fortune Theatre before 100 invited guests in the castle ballroom.

Larnach Castle and the Camp Estate were used as locations for the 2022 Netflix film, &quot;The Royal Treatment&quot;. They represented the residence of the royal family of the fictional country Lavania.

The building has been visited by paranormal investigators and featured on local New Zealand television shows such as &quot;Ghost Hunt&quot; and &quot;Spookers&quot; as well as international television shows such as the American &quot;Ghost Hunters International&quot;.

<text>Milburn is a small settlement about three kilometres north of Milton, New Zealand.

Milburn has since 2007 been home to the Otago Corrections Facility. This low to high-medium security men&#x27;s prison, at the northern end of Milburn, is the largest in the Otago region, housing up to 485 inmates and employing 201 staff.

==History==

Milburn is also locally famous for its limeworks. Many thousands of tonnes of crushed limestone are trucked out of the hills separating the Tokomairaro Plain and Lake Waihola annually to be used in fertilizers.

A large whale fossil can be found in a display at a lookout over the limeworks, Tokomairaro Plains and Lake Waihola.

Milburn was named after Morris Milburn, who came to New Zealand from Sunderland, North East of England in The United Kingdom in 1858. He arrived at Lyttelton harbour aboard The Zealandia. &quot;He journeyed overland to Dunedin doing the greater part of the trip by foot. In Otago he followed the goldfields with varying fortune incidental to a miners life. Working successfully at Gabriel&#x27;s Gully at Molyneux and at Milburn, the last mentioned place being named after him&quot; (Excerpt from Morris Milburn&#x27;s Obituary from The Lyttelton Times December 1906, accessed from Papers Past).

<doc id="1085894" wikidata="Q919777" url="?curid=1085894" title="Golf ball">
<text>A golf ball is a ball designed to be used in golf. Under the rules of golf, a golf ball has a mass no more than , has a diameter not less than , and performs within specified velocity, distance, and symmetry limits. Like golf clubs, golf balls are subject to testing and approval by The R&amp;A (formerly part of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews) and the United States Golf Association, and those that do not conform with regulations may not be used in competitions &quot;(Rule 5–1)&quot;.

==History==
===Early balls===
It is commonly believed that hard wooden, round balls, made from hardwoods such as beech and box, were used for golf from the 14th through the 17th centuries. 
Though wooden balls were no doubt used for other similar contemporary stick and ball games, there is no definite evidence that they were actually used in golf in Scotland. It is equally likely, if not more so, that leather balls filled with cows&#x27; hair were used, imported from the Netherlands from at least 1486 onward.

===Featherie===
Then or later, the &quot;featherie&quot; ball was developed and introduced. A featherie, or feathery, is a hand-sewn round leather pouch stuffed with chicken or goose feathers and coated with paint, usually white in color. A standard featherie used a gentleman&#x27;s top hat full of feathers. The feathers were boiled and softened before they were stuffed into the leather pouch. Making a featherie was a tedious and time-consuming process. An experienced ball maker could only make a few balls in one day, so they were expensive. A single ball would cost , which is equivalent to US$10–20 today.

===Guttie===
In 1848, the Rev. Dr. Robert Adams Paterson (sometimes spelled Patterson) invented the gutta-percha ball (or &quot;guttie&quot;, &quot;gutty&quot;). The guttie was made from dried sap of the Malaysian sapodilla tree. The sap had a rubber-like feel and could be made spherical by heating and shaping it in a mold. Because gutties were cheaper to produce, could be re-formed if they became out-of-round or damaged, and had improved aerodynamic qualities, they soon became the preferred ball for use.

Accidentally, it was discovered that nicks in the guttie from normal use actually provided a ball with a more consistent ball flight than a guttie with a perfectly smooth surface. Thus, makers began intentionally making indentations into the surface of new balls using either a knife or hammer and chisel, giving the guttie a textured surface. Many patterns were tried and used. These new gutties, with protruding nubs left by carving patterned paths across the ball&#x27;s surface, became known as &quot;brambles&quot; due to their resemblance to bramble fruit (blackberries).

===Wound golf ball===
The next major breakthrough in golf ball development came in 1898. Coburn Haskell of Cleveland, Ohio, had driven to nearby Akron, Ohio, for a golf date with Bertram Work, the superintendent of the B.F. Goodrich Company. While he waited in the plant for Work, Haskell picked up some rubber thread and wound it into a ball. When he bounced the ball, it flew almost to the ceiling. Work suggested Haskell put a cover on the creation, and that was the birth of the 20th-century wound golf ball that would soon replace the guttie bramble ball. The new design became known as the rubber Haskell golf ball.

For decades, the wound rubber ball consisted of a liquid-filled or solid round core that was wound with a layer of rubber thread into a larger round inner core and then covered with a thin outer shell made of balatá sap. The balatá is a tree native to Central and South America and the Caribbean. The tree is tapped and the soft, viscous fluid released is a rubber-like material similar to gutta-percha, which was found to make an ideal cover for a golf ball. Balatá, however, is relatively soft. If the leading edge of a highly lofted short iron contacts a balatá-covered ball in a location other than the bottom of the ball a cut or &quot;smile&quot; will often be the result, rendering the ball unfit for play.

==== Addition of dimples ====
In the early 1900s, it was found that dimpling the ball provided even more control of the ball&#x27;s trajectory, flight, and spin. David Stanley Froy, James McHardy, and Peter G. Fernie received a patent in 1897 for a ball with indentations; Froy played in the Open in 1900 at the Old Course at St. Andrews with the first prototype.

Players were able to put additional backspin on the new wound, dimpled balls when using more lofted clubs, thus inducing the ball to stop more quickly on the green. Manufacturers soon began selling various types of golf balls with various dimple patterns to improve the length, trajectory, spin, and overall &quot;feel&quot; characteristics of the new wound golf balls. Wound, balatá-covered golf balls were used into the late 20th century.

===Modern resin and polyurethane covered balls===
In the mid-1960s, a new synthetic resin, an ionomer of ethylene acid named Surlyn was introduced by DuPont as were new urethane blends for golf ball covers, and these new materials soon displaced balatá as they proved more durable and more resistant to cutting.

Along with various other materials that came into use to replace the rubber-wound internal sphere, golf balls came to be classified as either two-piece, three-piece, or four-piece balls, according to the number of layered components. These basic materials continue to be used in modern balls, with further advances in technology creating balls that can be customized to a player&#x27;s strengths and weaknesses, and even allowing for the combination of characteristics that were formerly mutually-exclusive.

Titleist&#x27;s Pro V1, Taylormade TP5, and Callaway Supersoft exemplify modern advancements in golf ball aerodynamics. The Titleist Pro V1 boasts a tightly wound 388-dimple design, minimizing gaps between dimples for better aerodynamics. On the other hand, the Taylormade TP5 features a combination of circular and hexagonal dimples to reduce drag. Lastly, Callaway balls showcase a sleek, completely hexagonal design for straighter ball flights.

Liquid cores were commonly used in golf balls as early as 1917. The liquid cores in many of the early balls contained a caustic liquid, typically an alkali, causing eye injuries to children who happened to dissect a golf ball out of curiosity. By the 1920s, golf ball manufacturers had stopped using caustic liquids, but into the 1970s and 1980s golf balls were still at times exploding when dissected and were causing injuries due to the presence of crushed crystalline material present in the liquid cores.

In 1967, Spalding purchased a patent for a solid golf ball from Jim Bartsch. His original patent defined a ball devoid of the layers in earlier designs, but Bartsch&#x27;s patent lacked the chemical properties needed for manufacturing. Spalding&#x27;s chemical engineering team developed a chemical resin that eliminated the need for the layered components entirely. Since then, the majority of non-professional golfers have transitioned to using solid core (or &quot;2-piece&quot;) golf balls.

The specifications for the golf ball continue to be governed by the ruling bodies of the game; namely, The R&amp;A, and the United States Golf Association (USGA).

===Biodegradable golf balls===
The early wood, featherie, and guttie balls were made from biodegradable materials. However, as a result of the Industrial Revolution and the invention of vulcanization, balls increasingly became made from non-biodegradable materials. During the late 2000s, a few new biodegradable golf balls came into the market, including some made from wood, lobster shells, or cornstarch.

==Regulations==

The Rules of Golf, jointly governed by the R&amp;A and the USGA, state in Appendix III that the diameter of a &quot;conforming&quot; golf ball cannot be any smaller than , and the weight of the ball may not exceed . The ball must also have the basic properties of a spherically symmetrical ball, generally meaning that the ball itself must be spherical and must have a symmetrical arrangement of dimples on its surface. While the ball&#x27;s dimples must be symmetrical, there is no limit to the number of dimples allowed on a golf ball. Additional rules direct players and manufacturers to other technical documents published by the R&amp;A and USGA with additional restrictions, such as radius and depth of dimples, maximum launch speed from test apparatus (generally defining the coefficient of restitution) and maximum total distance when launched from the test equipment.

In general, the governing bodies and their regulations seek to provide a relatively level playing field and maintain the traditional form of the game and its equipment, while not completely halting the use of new technology in equipment design.

Until 1990, it was permissible to use balls of less than 1.68 inches in diameter in tournaments under the jurisdiction of the R&amp;A, which differed in its ball specifications rules from those of the USGA. This ball was commonly called a &quot;British&quot; ball, while the golf ball approved by the USGA was simply the &quot;American ball&quot;. The smaller diameter gave the player a distance advantage, especially in high winds, as the smaller ball created a similarly smaller &quot;wake&quot; behind it.

==Aerodynamics==
When a golf ball is hit, the impact, which lasts less than a millisecond, determines the ball&#x27;s velocity, launch angle and spin rate, all of which influence its trajectory and its behavior when it hits the ground.

A ball moving through air experiences two major aerodynamic forces: lift, and drag. Dimpled balls fly farther than non-dimpled balls due to the combination of these two effects.
First, the dimples on the surface of a golf ball cause the boundary layer on the upstream side of the ball to transition from laminar to turbulent. The turbulent boundary layer is able to remain attached to the surface of the ball much longer than a laminar boundary with fewer eddies and so creates a narrower low-pressure wake and hence less pressure drag. The reduction in pressure drag causes the ball to travel further.

Second, backspin generates lift by deforming the airflow around the ball, in a similar manner to an airplane wing. This is called the Magnus effect. The dimples on a golf ball deform the air around the ball quickly causing a turbulent airflow that results in more Magnus lift than a smooth ball would experience.

Backspin is imparted in almost every shot due to the golf club&#x27;s loft (i.e., angle between the clubface and a vertical plane). A backspinning ball experiences an upward lift force which makes it fly higher and longer than a ball without spin.

Curvature of the ball flight occurs when the clubface is not aligned perpendicularly to the club direction at impact, leading to an angled spin axis that causes the ball to curve to one side or the other based on difference between the face angle and swing path at impact. Because the ball&#x27;s spin during flight is angled, and because of the Magnus effect, the ball will take on a curved path during its flight. Some dimple designs claim to reduce the sidespin effects to provide a straighter ball flight.

Other effects can change the flight behaviour of the ball. Factors such as dynamic lie (the angle of the shaft at impact relative to the ground and its manufactured neutral angle), strike location if the player is using a wood due to the curved face, and external factors such as wind and debris.

To keep the aerodynamics optimal, the golf ball needs to be clean, including all dimples. Thus, it is advisable that golfers wash their balls whenever permissible by the rules of golf. Golfers can wash their balls manually using a wet towel or using a ball washer of some type.

==Design==
Dimples first became a feature of golf balls when English engineer and manufacturer William Taylor, co-founder of the Taylor-Hobson company, registered a patent for a dimple design in 1905. William Taylor had realized that golf players were trying to make irregularities on their balls, noticing that used balls were going further than new ones. Hence he decided to make systematic tests to determine what surface formation would give the best flight. He then developed a pattern consisting of regularly spaced indentations over the entire surface, and later tools to help produce such balls in series.
Other types of patterned covers were in use at about the same time, including one called a &quot;mesh&quot; and another named the &quot;bramble&quot;, but the dimple became the dominant design due to &quot;the superiority of the dimpled cover in flight&quot;.

Most modern golf balls have about 300–500 dimples, though there have been balls with more than 1000 dimples. The record holder was a ball with 1,070 dimples—414 larger ones (in four different sizes) and 656 pinhead-sized ones.

Officially sanctioned balls are designed to be as symmetrical as possible. This symmetry is the result of a dispute that stemmed from the Polara, a ball sold in the late 1970s that had six rows of normal dimples on its equator but very shallow dimples elsewhere. This asymmetrical design helped the ball self-adjust its spin axis during the flight. The USGA refused to sanction it for tournament play and, in 1981, changed the rules to ban aerodynamic asymmetrical balls. Polara&#x27;s producer sued the USGA and the association paid US$1.375 million in a 1985 out-of-court settlement.

Golf balls are traditionally white, but are commonly available in other colors, some of which may assist with finding the ball when lost or when playing in low-light or frosty conditions. As well as bearing the maker&#x27;s name or logo, balls are usually printed with numbers or other symbols to help players identify their ball.

==Behavior==
Today, golf balls are manufactured using a variety of different materials, offering a range of playing characteristics to suit the player&#x27;s abilities and desired flight and landing behaviours.

A key consideration is &quot;compression&quot;, typically determined by the hardness of the ball&#x27;s core layers. A harder &quot;high-compression&quot; ball will fly further because of the more efficient transfer of energy into the ball, but will also transmit more of a shock through the club to the player&#x27;s hands (a &quot;hard feel&quot;). A softer &quot;low-compression&quot; ball will do just the opposite. Golfers typically prefer a softer feel, especially in the &quot;short game&quot;, as the softer ball typically also has greater backspin with lofted irons. However, a softer ball reduces drive distance, as it wastes more energy in compression. This makes it more difficult for players to get a birdie or eagle, as it can take more strokes to get on the green.

Another consideration is &quot;spin&quot;, affected by compression and by the cover material – a &quot;high-spin&quot; ball allows more of the ball&#x27;s surface to contact the clubface at impact, allowing the grooves of the clubface to &quot;grip&quot; the ball and induce more backspin at launch. Backspin creates lift that can increase carry distance, and also provides &quot;bite&quot; which allows a ball to arrest its forward motion at the initial point of impact, bouncing straight up or even backwards, allowing for precision placement of the ball on the green with an approach shot. However, high-spin cover materials, typically being softer, are less durable which shortens the useful life of the ball, and backspin is not desirable on most long-distance shots, such as with the driver, as it causes the shot to &quot;balloon&quot; and then to bite on the fairway, when additional rolling distance is usually desired.

Lastly, the pattern of dimples plays a role. By regulation, the arrangement of the dimples on the ball must be as symmetrical as possible. However, the dimples do not all have to be the same size, nor be in a uniform distribution. This allows designers to arrange the dimple patterns in such a way that the resistance to spinning is lower along certain axes of rotation and higher along others. This causes the ball to &quot;settle&quot; into one of these low-resistance axes that (golfers hope) is close to parallel with the ground and perpendicular to the direction of travel, thereby eliminating &quot;sidespin&quot; induced by a slight mishit, which will cause the ball to curve off its intended flight path. A badly mishit ball will still curve, as the ball will settle into a spin axis that is not parallel with the ground which, much like an aircraft&#x27;s wings, will cause the shot to bank either to the left or to the right.

==Selection==
There are many types of golf balls on the market, and customers often face a difficult decision. Golf balls are divided into two categories: recreational and advanced balls. Recreational balls are oriented toward the ordinary golfer, who generally have low swing speeds ( or lower) and lose golf balls on the course easily. These balls are made of two layers, with the cover firmer than the core. Their low compression and side spin reduction characteristics suit the lower swing speeds of average golfers quite well. Furthermore, they generally have lower prices than the advanced balls, lessening the financial impact of losing a ball to a hazard or out of bounds.

Advanced balls are made of multiple layers (three or more), with a soft cover and firm core. They induce a greater amount of spin from lofted shots (wedges especially), as well as a sensation of softness in the hands in short-range shots. However, these balls require a much greater swing speed and thus greater physical strength to properly compress at impact. If the compression of a golf ball does not match a golfer&#x27;s swing speed, either 
a lack of compression or over-compression will occur, resulting in loss of distance. Other choices consumers must make include brand and color, with colored balls and better brands generally being more expensive.

===Practice/range balls===
A practice ball or range ball is similar to a recreational golf ball, but is designed to be inexpensive, durable and have a shorter flight distance, while still retaining the principal behaviors of a &quot;real&quot; golf ball and so providing useful feedback to players. All of these are desirable qualities for use in an environment like a driving range, which may be limited in maximum distance, and must have many thousands of balls on-hand at any time that are each hit and mis-hit hundreds of times during their useful life.

To accomplish these ends, practice balls are typically harder-cored than even recreational balls, have a firmer, more durable cover to withstand the normal abrasion caused by a club&#x27;s hitting surface, and are made as cheaply as possible while maintaining a durable, quality product. Practice balls are typically labelled with &quot;PRACTICE&quot; in bold lettering, and often also have one or more bars or lines printed on them, which allow players (and high-speed imaging aids) to see the ball&#x27;s spin more easily as it leaves the tee or hitting turf.

Practice balls conform to all applicable requirements of the Rules of Golf, and as such are legal for use on the course, but as the hitting characteristics are not ideal, players usually opt for a better-quality ball for actual play.

===Recycled balls===

Players, especially novice and casual players, lose a large number of balls during the play of a round. Balls hit into water hazards, penalty areas, buried deeply in sand, and otherwise lost or abandoned during play are a constant source of litter that groundskeepers must contend with, and can confuse players during a round who may hit an abandoned ball (incurring a penalty by strict rules). An estimated 1.2 billion balls are manufactured every year and an estimated 300 million are lost in the US alone.

A variety of devices such as nets, harrows, sand rakes etc. have been developed that aid the groundskeeping staff in efficiently collecting these balls from the course as they accumulate. Once collected, they may be discarded, kept by the groundskeeping staff for their own use, repurposed on the club&#x27;s driving range, or sold in bulk to a recycling firm. These firms clean and resurface the balls to remove abrasions and stains, grade them according to their resulting quality, and sell the various grades of playable balls back to golfers through retailers at a discount.

Used or recycled balls with obvious surface deformation, abrasion or other degradation are known informally as &quot;shags&quot;, and while they remain useful for various forms of practice drills such as chipping, putting and driving, and can be used for casual play, players usually opt for used balls of higher quality, or for new balls, when playing in serious competition. Other grades are typically assigned letters or proprietary terms, and are typically differentiated by the cost and quality of the ball when new and the ability of the firm to restore the ball to &quot;like-new&quot; condition. The &quot;top grade&quot; balls are typically balls that are considered the current state of the art and, after cleaning and surfacing, are indistinguishable externally from a new ball sold by the manufacturer.

===Markouts/X-outs===
In addition to recycled balls, casual golfers wishing to procure quality balls at a discount price can often purchase &quot;X-outs&quot;. These are &quot;factory seconds&quot; – balls which have failed the manufacturer&#x27;s quality control testing standards and which the manufacturer therefore does not wish to sell under its brand name. To avoid a loss of money on materials and labor, however, the balls which still generally conform to the Rules are marked to obscure the brand name (usually with a series of &quot;X&quot;s, hence the most common term &quot;X-out&quot;), packaged in generic boxes and sold at a deep discount.

Typically, the flaw that caused the ball to fail QC does not have a significant effect on its flight characteristics (balls with serious flaws are usually discarded outright at the manufacturing plant), and so these &quot;X-outs&quot; will often perform identically to their counterparts that have passed the company&#x27;s QC. They are thus a good choice for casual play. However, because the balls have been effectively &quot;disowned&quot; for practical and legal purposes by their manufacturer, they are not considered to be the same as the brand-name balls on the USGA&#x27;s published Conforming Golf Ball List. Therefore, when playing in a tournament or other event that requires the ball used by the player to appear on this list as a &quot;condition of competition&quot;, X-outs of any kind are illegal.

==Marking and personalization==

Golfers need to distinguish their ball from other players&#x27; to ensure that they do not play the wrong ball. This is often done by making a mark on the ball using a permanent marker pen such as a Sharpie. A wide number of markings are used; a majority of players either simply write their initial in a particular color, or color in a particular arrangement of the dimples on the ball. Many players make multiple markings so that at least one can be seen without having to lift the ball. Marking tools such as stamps and stencils are available to speed the marking process.

Alternatively, balls are usually sold pre-marked with the brand and model of golf ball, and also with a letter, number or symbol. This combination can usually (but not always) be used to distinguish a player&#x27;s ball from other balls in play and from lost or abandoned balls on the course. Companies, country clubs and event organizers commonly have balls printed with their logo as a promotional tool, and some professional players are supplied with balls by their sponsors which have been custom-printed with something unique to that player (their name, signature, or a personal symbol).

==Radio location==
Golf balls with embedded radio transmitters to allow lost balls to be located were first introduced in 1973, only to be rapidly banned for use in competition. More recently RFID transponders have been used for this purpose, though these are also illegal in tournaments. This technology can however be found in some computerized driving ranges. In this format, each ball used at the range has an RFID with its own unique transponder code. When dispensed, the range registers each dispensed ball to the player, who then hits them towards targets in the range. When the player hits a ball into a target, they receive distance and accuracy information calculated by the computer. The use of this technology was first commercialized by World Golf Systems Group to create TopGolf, a brand and chain of computerized ranges now owned by Callaway Golf.

==World records==
Canadian long drive champion Jason Zuback broke the world ball speed record on an episode of &quot;Sport Science&quot; with a golf ball speed of . The previous record of was held by José Ramón Areitio, a Jai Alai player.

<doc id="1085895" wikidata="Q1051614" url="?curid=1085895" title="Remixes 81–04">
<text>Remixes 81–04 is a remix album by English electronic music band Depeche Mode, released on 25 October 2004. It was the band&#x27;s first release since Daniel Miller&#x27;s independent label Mute Records was acquired by industry major EMI in 2002. It features well-known remixes from the band&#x27;s back catalogue, as well as previously unavailable mixes.

There are three versions of &quot;Remixes 81–04&quot;. The main version has two CDs. The limited-edition version has the same two CDs, plus a bonus CD with mostly new remixes. There is also a one-CD release with selections from all three discs.

The booklet, found in all three versions, features an essay by Paul Morley. A special &quot;secret website&quot; (now offline) could be unlocked with the CDs.

During the promotion of the limited three-CD edition of &quot;Remixes 81–04&quot;, the above-mentioned site was launched for fans who bought the bundle, which featured exclusive goodies. There was a special digital download-only bundle titled &quot;Remixes 81···04 Rare Tracks&quot;, which is now offline for all songs. It was accompanied with official artwork (also download-only). Users who bought the entire bundle could burn the tracks to a 90-minute CD-R (the whole album lasts 88:32) and print the artwork.

It was followed by a second remix album, &quot;Remixes 2: 81–11&quot;, released on 3 June 2011.

==Track listing==
All songs written by Martin L. Gore, except &quot;Shout!&quot;, &quot;Just Can&#x27;t Get Enough&quot; and &quot;Photographic&quot; by Vince Clarke, and &quot;Route 66&quot; by Bobby Troup.

<doc id="1085901" wikidata="Q1193049" url="?curid=1085901" title="Towa Tei">
<text>is a Japanese artist, record producer, and DJ. Born in Yokohama, Japan, Towa was a member of Deee-Lite, from the US label Elektra Records in 1990 and shot to fame via their international hit single, &quot;Groove Is In the Heart&quot;. He made his solo debut with the album &quot;Future Listening!&quot; in 1994. He has since relocated from New York to rural Nagano Prefecture in Japan.

Towa&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Sound Museum&quot; (1997), became his highest charting effort at number 17 on the &quot;Oricon&quot; charts. Its single, &quot;GBI (German Bold Italic)&quot; featuring Kylie Minogue and Haruomi Hosono, reached number 50 and 63 in Australia and the United Kingdom, respectively. He saw continued success with 1999&#x27;s &quot;Last Century Modern&quot; as its single, &quot;Let Me Know&quot; featuring Chara, peaked at number 34 in Japan, his highest entry.

Towa has collaborated with Ryuichi Sakamoto, Yukihiro Takahashi, Akiko Yano, Ringo Sheena, and Arto Lindsay, among others. His concept party, &quot;Hotel H&quot;, started in 2009 as a social spot for music industry people in Tokyo.

==Biography==
Towa is a third-generation Korean-Japanese. Towa began making demo tapes at the age of 16 having bought his first synthesizer, a Korg MS-10. While studying at Musashino Art University Junior College of Art and Design, he sent his tape to a radio program of Ryuichi Sakamoto titled &quot;Sound Street&quot;.

In 1987, Towa moved to the U.S. to study graphic design and joined house act Deee-Lite, a trio with Supa DJ Dimitry and Lady Miss Kier, enjoying almost instant success after debuting in 1990 with their album &quot;World Clique&quot; and the single &quot;Groove Is In the Heart&quot;.

In 1991, Towa collaborated with his idol Ryuichi Sakamoto on Sakamoto&#x27;s album &quot;Heartbeat&quot;. He also appeared on Sakamoto&#x27;s follow up album &quot;Sweet Revenge&quot;.

In 1994, Towa returned to Japan after seven years in New York. He sustained a back injury falling from a stage during a performance with Deee-Lite in Brazil. While recovering, he began to drift toward other musical styles. He debuted as a solo act with &quot;Future Listening!&quot; that same year, incorporating an array of styles, including electronic, bossa nova, house, jazz and pop. It featured collaborations with Joi Cardwell, Bebel Gilberto, MC Kinky, Hiroshi Takano, Ryuichi Sakamoto, Haruomi Hosono, Toshihiko Mori, Satoshi Tomiie, Yuichi Oki of Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra and Pizzicato Five vocalist Maki Nomiya.

&quot;Sound Museum&quot; followed in 1997, then &quot;Last Century Modern&quot; in 1999. 2002 brought the album &quot;Towa Tei&quot;, under the pseudonym Sweet Robots Against the Machine. &quot;Flash&quot; surfaced in 2005 by which time Towa was DJing regularly in Japan. He has admitted, though, that he does not enjoy performing and prefers producing and using computers.

&quot;Big Fun&quot;, featuring Verbal and Mademoiselle Yulia, was released in 2009 and was the third album to feature the artwork of San Franciscan painter and graffiti artist Barry McGee. For the album, Towa utilized MySpace to collaborate with artists from around the world, even if he didn&#x27;t know them, such as with German act Taprikk Sweezee. Another collaborator he worked with for &quot;Big Fun&quot; was Miho Hatori of Cibo Matto, though they also met only on MySpace.

Towa has established his own creative company, hug inc, which, among other things, manufactures his trademark sunglasses.
